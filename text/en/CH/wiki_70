<text>Chester Greenwood (December 4, 1858 – July 5, 1937) was an American engineer and inventor, known for inventing the earmuffs in 1873. He reportedly came up with the idea while ice skating and he asked his grandmother to sew tufts of fur between loops of wire. His patent was for improved ear protectors. He manufactured these ear protectors, providing jobs for people in the Farmington area for nearly 60 years.

== Career ==
In 1873, aged 15, while he was testing a new pair of ice skates, he got frustrated as he tried to protect his ears from the cold. He then wrapped his head with a scarf, but was too itchy to wear. Later, he designed two ear-shaped loops made by wire. He then asked his grandmother to sew fur on the loops. It successfully kept the cold away from his ears. He later improved the prototype earmuffs using a steel band which held them in place, and he named these earmuffs &quot;Greenwood&#x27;s Champion Ear Protectors&quot;. 

Greenwood also patented a tea kettle, a variation of the steel-toothed rake, an advertising matchbox, and a machine used to produce wooden spools for wire and thread. He invented, but did not patent, an umbrella holder for mail carriers. The total number of patents Greenwood held seems to be contested: Some claim only a handful, while others claim over 100. The memory of the latter helps boost Greenwood&#x27;s historical legacy.

In addition to being an inventor, Greenwood was the owner of a bicycle business and a business involving an improved heating system. He also introduced one of the first telephone systems in Farmington. He was an accomplished machinist, an active member of the community, a business developer, a member of the Unitarian Church and a family man. His wife, Isabel (née Whittier), was a supporter of woman suffrage. He and Isabel were parents of four children.

== Chester Greenwood Day ==

In 1977, the State of Maine declared December 21 to be Chester Greenwood Day. Farmington continues to celebrate &quot;Chester Greenwood Day&quot; with a parade on the first Saturday of December.

The Chester Greenwood House in Farmington is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Mamadou Diallo (born 28 August 1971) is a Senegalese former professional footballer who played as a forward. He played in twelve countries across four continents: United States, Senegal, Morocco, Switzerland, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, South Africa, Mali, Germany, Turkey, Sweden and Norway. A prolific scorer almost everywhere he played, he became a regular for the Senegal national team.

== Club career ==
Diallo was born in Dakar, Senegal.

=== Major League Soccer ===
Major League Soccer signed Diallo in 2000 and allocated him to the Tampa Bay Mutiny. Diallo exploded on the MLS scene in his first season, combining well with midfield general Carlos Valderrama. Diallo scored 26 goals, the best in the league since Roy Lassiter had 27 in 1996; he was named to the MLS Best XI and was the league Scoring Champion.

However, Diallo is also remembered for the incident on 16 August 2000 in a game against the MetroStars, where he collided with and stepped on Metro goalie Mike Ammann, breaking his ribs and puncturing his lung. The referee saw the collision as unintentional contact, and he was neither fined nor carded for the incident. However, there were those (including Ammann himself) that considered the contact was intentional.

In 2001, with Valderrama traded in mid-season, Diallo had a down year, slipping to nine goals. The Mutiny was contracted after the season and Diallo was selected by the New England Revolution in the 2002 MLS Allocation Draft. He only spent seven games in New England, and was sent over to the MetroStars in a six-player deal on 24 May. He had a four-goal game against the Los Angeles Galaxy in only his second match with the team, but his scoring tapered off and the Metros missed the playoffs.

=== Later career ===
Diallo moved to Saudi Arabian club Al-Ahli on 7 October 2002, but was dropped in November after failing to impress. His globetrotting ways took him to the former UEFA Cup winners, the Swedish club IFK Göteborg, then Malaysian club Pahang, then Jomo Cosmos of South Africa and finally with Djoliba AC until he retired.

== International career ==
Diallo won 46 caps for Senegal, scoring 21 goals, in a career which saw him represent his country at the African Cup of Nations in 1994. He played for Senegal at the 2007 Beach Soccer World Cup, scoring one goal and receiving one red card.

== Personal life ==
Diallo&#x27;s son, Boubacar Diallo, currently plays for FC Tulsa.

== Honors ==
Individual
* MLS Best XI: 2000
* MLS All-Star: 2000

<text>Keith William Twort Raffan (born 21 June 1949) is a former British politician. From 1983 to 1992, he served in the British House of Commons as the Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for the Delyn constituency in Wales. Then from 1999 to 2005, he was a Scottish Liberal Democrat Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the Mid Scotland and Fife region.

==Early life==
Raffan was born in Aberdeen and educated at Robert Gordon&#x27;s College, Trinity College, Glenalmond, and Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. Prior to entering parliament he was a parliamentary sketchwriter for the &quot;Daily Express&quot;.

==Conservative MP, 1983–1992==
Originally a Conservative, Raffan was in the early 1970s a chairman of Pressure for Economic and Social Toryism (a precursor of the Tory Reform Group), thus placing him on the left of the party. At this time he stood unsuccessfully for parliament in two general elections, at Dulwich in February 1974 and East Aberdeenshire in October 1974.

He was elected as Conservative MP for the Welsh seat of Delyn from 1983 to 1992, but his views on issues like drugs put him out of favour with the prevailing leadership of Margaret Thatcher, and he was never made a Minister. Raffan was one of the few Conservative MPs to support the &#x27;stalking horse&#x27; leadership challenge of Anthony Meyer (his constituency neighbour in north Wales) against Thatcher in 1989, and he then supported Michael Heseltine&#x27;s challenge to Thatcher the following year.

==Scottish parliament, 1999–2005==
Raffan stood down from the House of Commons at the 1992 general election and abandoned the Tories, in part because of his strong support for Scottish and Welsh devolution. He joined the Liberal Democrats that same year, and after working as a broadcaster and public relations consultant in New York and for Welsh TV channel HTV moved to Scotland. In 1998 he stood as the Liberal Democrat candidate in the European Parliament by-election for North East Scotland, and soon afterwards was appointed the Scottish party&#x27;s chief spokesman on home affairs.

In the 1999 Scottish Parliament election Raffan was elected as a regional list MSP to represent Mid Scotland and Fife. He was one of three Liberal Democrat MSPs – along with Donald Gorrie and John Farquhar Munro – who opposed the coalition with the Labour Party in the Scottish Parliament, and was alone among his Liberal Democrat colleagues in not backing Donald Dewar for First Minister (he abstained from the vote). Noted for his flamboyant and theatrical manner when participating in debate, early in the parliament&#x27;s first term he gained notoriety for tabling 38 written questions in one day.

Raffan was re-elected at the 2003 Scottish Parliament election, and became a Vice Convener of the Scottish Liberal Democrats. However, in December 2004 he was subject to wide criticism for claiming abnormally large expense costs from the Scottish Parliament, including travel in his Fife constituency at times when he was known to be in Parliament in Edinburgh. The following month he resigned as an MSP, citing ill-health (and not the controversy his expense claims had caused or the accusations of inappropriate sexual and bullying behaviour towards his staff) as the reason.

He faced further criticism after his resignation for working at ITV Wales despite being &quot;too sick to work&quot;. He was replaced in his seat by Andrew Arbuckle, who had been next on the Liberal Democrat list for Mid Scotland and Fife in 2003. The Scottish Liberal Democrats have confirmed to the press that Raffan is no longer a party member.

==After politics==
In the run up to the 2018 local elections, Raffan wrote a letter to the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; declaring that he was going to vote for the Labour Party in Kensington, where he was living.

He has subsequently left his third political party and now considers himself an independent.

<text>Hiram George Runnels (December 15, 1796 – December 17, 1857) was a U.S. politician from the states of Mississippi and Texas.

He was a Democrat who served as the ninth governor of Mississippi from November 20, 1833, to December 3, 1835.

== Biography ==
Runnels was born in Hancock County, Georgia, on December 15, 1796, to Harmon M. and Hester (Hubert) Runnels. A poor frontier family, the Runnels relocated to Mississippi when Hiram was a child. The family descended from English colonists. The Runnels were the first white people to build a house in what would become Monticello, Mississippi. He married Obedience Smith in 1823.

Although he received a limited education, Runnels worked as a schoolteacher before serving as the state&#x27;s auditor and treasurer from 1822 to 1830. Runnels also served as a volunteer in the army during various conflicts with Native Americans. He was elected in the Mississippi House of Representatives in 1830. After an unsuccessful run for governor in 1831, Runnels was elected in May 1833 by only 558 votes. Due to the closeness of the result, he did not take office until the following November.

During his tenure as governor, Runnels secured funding for a new statehouse in Jackson, restructured the state militia, signed a ban on the importation of enslaved people for auction and oversaw the formation of sixteen new counties in the land seized from the Chickasaw Indians. A devoted Jacksonian Democrat, Runnels angered his political allies when he refused to order the state militia to support and arm vigilantes who killed and maimed dozens of white and black people suspected of inciting a slave rebellion during the summer of 1835. On the other hand, more conservative voters and Whigs accused Runnels of verbally condoning vigilantism and preventing the militia and local law enforcement officials from suppressing extralegal violence. Facing criticism from Whigs and many Democrats over the affair, Runnels narrowly lost his reelection bid and left office in November 1835.

In 1838, Runnels was appointed president of the newly chartered Union Bank in Jackson, placing him in deeper conflict with other Democrats. When Union Bank collapsed in 1840, the new governor of Mississippi, Alexander McNutt, accused Runnels and others of corruption. Runnels responded by canning the governor in the streets of Jackson. Debates related to the state&#x27;s central banking system also led to a duel between Runnels and Volney E. Howard, a director at Union Bank, that same year. Despite these conflicts, Runnels was reelected to represent Hinds County in the state legislature in 1841.

Runnels moved to Texas in 1842 and purchased a cotton plantation located on the Brazos River near Houston. He represented Brazoria County during the Convention of 1845. He was elected to the Texas State Senate in 1855 but failed to qualify for office. He was elected to the Senate again in 1857 but died before taking office. The Texas Senate passed a memorial resolution in his honor, and Benjamin F. Tankersly was sworn into office in his stead.

Runnels died in Houston on December 17, 1857, and was buried in Glenwood Cemetery.

== Personality ==
The son of a man who &quot;would fire up and fight anybody and at any time,&quot; Runnels&#x27;s personality reflected the rough-hewn violence of his frontier upbringing. Described as excitable and volatile, his narrow defeat in the 1835 Mississippi gubernatorial race was partially attributed to an emotional outburst against one of his opponents during which he used some very harsh and unparliamentary language.

== Legacy ==

Runnels County, Texas, was named in his honor.

Runnels was the uncle of Texas Governor Hardin Richard Runnels, and William R. Baker, a Texas State Senator was married to Runnels&#x27;s niece, Hester.

<text>Tarsila de Aguiar do Amaral (; 1 September 1886 – 17 January 1973) was a Brazilian painter, draftswoman, and translator. She is considered one of the leading Latin American modernist artists, and is regarded as the painter who best achieved Brazilian aspirations for nationalistic expression in a modern style. As a member of the &quot;Grupo dos Cinco&quot;, Tarsila is also considered a major influence in the modern art movement in Brazil, alongside Anita Malfatti, Menotti Del Picchia, Mário de Andrade, and Oswald de Andrade. She was instrumental in the formation of the aesthetic movement, &quot;Antropofagia&quot; (1928–1929); in fact, Tarsila was the one with her celebrated painting, &quot;Abaporu&quot;, who inspired Oswald de Andrade&#x27;s famous &quot;Manifesto Antropófago&quot;.

== Early life and education ==
Tarsila do Amaral was born in Capivari, a small town in the countryside of the state of São Paulo. She was born to a wealthy family of farmers and landowners who grew coffee, two years before the end of slavery in Brazil. At that time in Brazil women were not encouraged to seek higher education, especially if they came from affluent families. Despite coming from an upper class family, Tarsila had her family&#x27;s support in obtaining higher education. As a teenager, Tarsila and her parents traveled to Spain, where Tarsila caught people&#x27;s eyes by drawing and painting copies of the artwork she saw at her school&#x27;s archives. Tarsila attended school in Barcelona, and later trained privately in her hometown under painter Pedro Alexandrino Borges (1864-1942). She also attended the Académie Julian in Paris and studied with other prominent artists (1920-1923).

== Career ==
Beginning in 1916, Tarsila do Amaral studied painting in São Paulo. Later she studied drawing and painting with the academic painter Pedro Alexandrino. These were all respected but conservative teachers. Because Brazil lacked a public art museum or significant commercial gallery until after World War II, the Brazilian art world was aesthetically conservative and exposure to international trends was limited.

It is believed that around this time (1913-1920) Amaral composed a song in A minor for voice and piano named &quot;Rondo D&#x27;Amour&quot;. The song remained unknown until November 2021, when its sheet music was discovered at her grandniece&#x27;s house in Campinas. On 25 January 2022, the song was recorded at the theater of the School of Music of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte by three professors of the institution: pianist Durval Cesetti, soprano Elke Riedel and tenor Kaio Morais.

==Brazilian modernism==

Returning to São Paulo from Paris in 1922, Tarsila was exposed to many things after meeting Anita Malfatti, Oswald de Andrade, Mário de Andrade, and Menotti Del Picchia. These fellow artists formed a group that was named the Grupo dos Cinco. Prior to her arrival in São Paulo from Europe, the group had organized the Semana de Arte Moderna (&quot;Modern Art Week&quot;) during the week of February 11–18, 1922. The event was pivotal in the development of modernism in Brazil. The participants were interested in changing the conservative artistic establishment in Brazil by encouraging a distinctive mode of modern art. Tarsila was asked to join the movement and together they became the Grupo dos Cinco, which sought to promote Brazilian culture, the use of styles that were not specifically European, and the inclusion of things that were indigenous to Brazil.

During a brief return to Paris in 1929, Tarsila was exposed to Cubism, Futurism, and Expressionism while studying with André Lhote, Fernand Léger, and Albert Gleizes. European artists in general had developed a great interest in African and primitive cultures for inspiration. This led Tarsila to utilize her own country&#x27;s indigenous forms while incorporating the modern styles she had studied. While in Paris at this time, she painted one of her most famous works, &quot;A Negra&quot; (1923). The principal subject matter of the painting is a large figure of a black woman with a single prominent breast. Tarsila stylized the figure and flattened the space, filling in the background with geometric forms.

Excited about her newly developed style and feeling ever more nationalistic, she wrote to her family in April 1923:

==Pau-Brasil period==
Tarsila spent much of 1923 in Europe with poet Oswald de Andrade. Upon returning to Brazil in December 1923, Tarsila and Andrade then traveled throughout Brazil to find inspiration for their nationalistic art in folk religion and popular ritual. In March 1924, they spent Carnaval in Rio de Janeiro, and in April 1924, they traveled to baroque mining towns in Minas Gerais during Holy Week as part of the &quot;caravana modernista&quot; (modernist caravan). During this period, Tarsila made drawings of the various places they visited, which became the basis for many of her upcoming paintings. Paintings created during this period include &quot;São Paulo&quot; (1924), &quot;Morro de Favela&quot; (1924), and &quot;Lagoa Santa&quot; (1925).

She also illustrated the poetry that Andrade wrote during their travels, including his pivotal book of poems entitled &quot;Pau Brasil&quot;, published in 1924. In the manifesto of the same name, Andrade emphasized that Brazilian culture was a product of importing European culture and called artists to create works that were uniquely Brazilian in order to &quot;export&quot; Brazilian culture, much like the wood of the Brazil tree had become an important export to the rest of the world. In addition, he challenged artists to use a modernist approach in their art, a goal they had strived for during the Semana de Arte Moderna in São Paulo. In works by both Andrade and Tarsila, the Pau-Brasil movement was a concept that sought to establish a modern art particular to Brazil.

During this time, Tarsila&#x27;s colors became more vibrant. In fact, she wrote that she had found the &quot;colors I had adored as a child. I was later taught they were ugly and unsophisticated.&quot; Her initial painting from this period was &quot;E.C.F.B.(Estrada de Ferro Central do Brasil)&quot;, (1924). Furthermore, at the time, she had an interest in industrialization and urbanization, and their impacts on society. Tarsila painted several representations of large cities, like São Paulo, that combined small aspects of the city, like gas pumps, with broader urban scenes. Building on the ideas of the earlier Pau-Brasil movement, she appropriated European styles similar to those of her former teacher, Fernand Léger, but adapted them to the local cityscapes in order to develop modes and techniques that were uniquely Brazilian.

In 1926, Tarsila married Andrade and they continued to travel throughout Europe and the Middle East. In Paris, in 1926, she had her first solo exhibition at the Galerie Percier. The paintings shown at the exhibition, which marked the culmination of her Pau Brasil period, as well as her earlier stay in Paris, included &quot;São Paulo&quot; (1924), &quot;A Negra&quot; (1923), &quot;Lagoa Santa&quot; (1925), and &quot;Morro de Favela&quot; (1924). Her works were praised and called &quot;exotic&quot;, &quot;original&quot;, &quot;naïve&quot;, and &quot;cerebral&quot;, and her use of bright colors and tropical images was commented on.

==Antropofagia period==

While in Paris in the mid-1920s, Tarsila encountered surrealism. After returning to Brazil, Tarsila began a new period of painting where she departed from urban landscapes and scenery, and began incorporating surrealist style into her nationalistic art. This shift also coincided with a larger artistic movement in São Paulo and other parts of Brazil which focused on celebrating Brazil as the country of the big snake, as part of a broader rediscovery of Amerindian mythology and history.

Tarsila&#x27;s first painting during this period was &quot;Abaporu&quot; (1928), which had been given as an untitled painting to Andrade for his birthday. The subject is a large stylized human figure with enormous feet sitting on the ground next to a cactus with a lemon-slice sun in the background. Andrade selected the eventual title, &quot;Abaporu&quot;, which is a Tupi-Guarani for &quot;man who eats&quot;, in collaboration with the poet Raul Bopp. This was related to the then current ideas regarding the melding of European style and influences. Soon after, Andrade wrote his &quot;Anthropophagite Manifesto&quot;, which literally called Brazilians to devour European styles, ridding themselves of all direct influences, and to create their own style and culture. Colonialism played a role in her work; Tarsila incorporated this concept into her art. Instead of being devoured by Europe, they would devour Europe themselves. Andrade used &quot;Abaporu&quot; for the cover of the manifesto as a representation of his ideals. The following year the manifesto&#x27;s influence continued, Tarsila painted &quot;Antropofagia&quot; (1929), which featured the &quot;Abaporu&quot; figure together with the female figure from &quot;A Negra&quot; from 1923, as well as the Brazilian banana leaf, cactus, and again the lemon-slice sun.

In 1929, Tarsila had her first solo exhibition in Brazil at the Palace Hotel in Rio de Janeiro, and it was followed by another at the Salon Gloria in São Paulo. In 1930, she was featured in exhibitions in New York and Paris. Unfortunately, 1930 also saw the end of Tarsila and Andrade&#x27;s marriage. This brought an end to their collaboration.

==Later career and death==
In 1931, Tarsila traveled to the Soviet Union. While there, she had exhibitions of her works in Moscow at the Museum of Occidental Art, and she traveled to various other cities and museums. Upon her return to Brazil in 1932, she became involved in the São Paulo Constitutional Revolt against the dictatorship in Brazil, led by Getúlio Vargas. Along with others who were seen as leftist, she was imprisoned for a month because her travels made her appear to be a communist sympathizer.

The remainder of her career she focused on social themes. Representative of this period is the painting &quot;Segunda Classe&quot; (1931), which has impoverished Russian men, women and children as the subject matter. She also began writing a weekly arts and culture column for the &quot;Diario de São Paulo&quot;, which continued until 1952.

In 1938, Tarsila finally settled permanently in São Paulo, where she spent the remainder of her career painting Brazilian people and landscapes. In 1950, she had an exhibition at Museum of Modern Art, São Paulo, where a reviewer called her &quot;the most Brazilian of painters here, who represents the sun, birds, and youthful spirits of our developing country, as simple as the elements of our land and nature…&quot;. She died in São Paulo in 1973. Tarsila&#x27;s life is a mark of the warm Brazilian character and an expression of it tropical exuberance.&quot;

==Legacy==
Besides the 230 paintings, hundreds of drawings, illustrations, prints, murals, and five sculptures, Tarsila&#x27;s legacy is her effect on the direction of Latin American art. Tarsila moved modernism forward in Latin America, and developed a style unique to Brazil. Following her example, other Latin American artists were influenced to begin utilizing indigenous Brazilian subject matter, and developing their own style. The Amaral Crater on Mercury is named after her.

In 2018 MoMA opened a solo exhibition of her work, the eighth retrospective on Latin America artists following exhibitions on Diego Rivera, Cândido Portinari, Roberto Matta, Manuel Álvarez Bravo, Armando Reverón, José Clemente Orozco and Joaquín Torres García.

In August 2022 several of her paintings were recovered in Brazil from criminals who had gained them from an art dealer and collector&#x27;s widow by deception and force. This included &quot;Sol poente,&quot; &quot;O sono&quot; and &quot;Pont-neuf&quot;.

<text>In computer programming, an inline assembler is a feature of some compilers that allows low-level code written in assembly language to be embedded within a program, among code that otherwise has been compiled from a higher-level language such as C or Ada.

== Motivation and alternatives ==
The embedding of assembly language code is usually done for one of these reasons:

* Optimization: Programmers can use assembly language code to implement the most performance-sensitive parts of their program&#x27;s algorithms, code that is apt to be more efficient than what might otherwise be generated by the compiler.
* Access to processor-specific instructions: Most processors offer special instructions, such as Compare and Swap and Test and Set instructions which may be used to construct semaphores or other synchronization and locking primitives. Nearly every modern processor has these or similar instructions, as they are necessary to implement multitasking. Examples of specialized instructions are found in the SPARC VIS, Intel MMX and SSE, and Motorola Altivec instruction sets.
* Access to special calling conventions not yet supported by the compiler.
* System calls and interrupts: High-level languages rarely have a direct facility to make arbitrary system calls, so assembly code is used. Direct interrupts are even more rarely supplied.
* To emit special directives for the linker or assembler, for example to change sectioning, macros, or to make symbol aliases.

On the other hand, inline assembler poses a direct problem for the compiler itself as it complicates the analysis of what is done to each variable, a key part of register allocation. This means the performance might actually decrease. Inline assembler also complicates future porting and maintenance of a program.

Alternative facilities are often provided as a way to simplify the work for both the compiler and the programmer. Intrinsic functions for special instructions are provided by most compilers and C-function wrappers for arbitrary system calls are available on every Unix platform.

== Syntax ==

=== In language standards ===
The ISO C++ standard and ISO C standards (annex J) specify a conditionally supported syntax for inline assembler:
&lt;poem&gt;
An asm declaration has the form
 &quot;asm-declaration&quot;:
 ( &quot;string-literal&quot; ) ;
The asm declaration is conditionally-supported; its meaning is implementation-defined.
&lt;/poem&gt;

This definition, however, is rarely used in actual C, as it is simultaneously too liberal (in the interpretation) and too restricted (in the use of one string literal only).

=== In actual compilers ===
In practical use, inline assembly operating on values is rarely standalone as free-floating code. Since the programmer cannot predict what register a variable is assigned to, compilers typically provide a way to substitute them in as an extension.

There are, in general, two types of inline assembly supported by C/C++ compilers:
* (or ) in GCC. GCC uses a direct extension of the ISO rules: assembly code template is written in strings, with inputs, outputs, and clobbered registers specified after the strings in colons. C variables are used directly while register names are quoted as string literals.
* in Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC), Borland/Embarcadero C compiler, and descendants. This syntax is not based on ISO rules at all; programmers simply write ASM inside a block without needing to conform to C syntax. Variables are available as if they are registers and some C expressions are allowed. ARM Compiler used to have a similar facility.

The two families of extensions represent different understandings of division of labor in processing inline assembly. The GCC form preserves the overall syntax of the language and compartmentizes what the compiler needs to know: what is needed and what is changed. It does not explicitly require the compiler to understand instruction names, as the compiler is only needed to substitute its register assignments, plus a few operations, to handle the input requirements. However, the user is prone to specifying clobbered registers incorrectly. The MSVC form of an embedded domain-specific language provides ease of writing, but it requires the compiler itself to know about opcode names and their clobbering properties, demanding extra attention in maintenance and porting. It is still possible to check GCC-style assembly for clobber mistakes with knowledge of the instruction set.

GNAT (Ada language frontend of the GCC suite), and LLVM uses the GCC syntax. The D programming language uses a DSL similar to the MSVC extension officially for x86_64, but the LLVM-based LDC also provides the GCC-style syntax on every architecture. MSVC only supports inline assembler on 32-bit x86.

The Rust language has since migrated to a syntax abstracting away inline assembly options further than the LLVM (GCC-style) version. It provides enough information to allow transforming the block into an externally-assembled function if the backend could not handle embedded assembly.

== Examples ==

=== A system call in GCC ===

Calling an operating system directly is generally not possible under a system using protected memory. The OS runs at a more privileged level (kernel mode) than the user (user mode); a (software) interrupt is used to make requests to the operating system. This is rarely a feature in a higher-level language, and so wrapper functions for system calls are written using inline assembler.

The following C code example shows an x86 system call wrapper in AT&amp;T assembler syntax, using the GNU Assembler. Such calls are normally written with the aid of macros; the full code is included for clarity. In this particular case, the wrapper performs a system call of a number given by the caller with three operands, returning the result.

To recap, GCC supports both &quot;basic&quot; and &quot;extended&quot; assembly. The former simply passes text verbatim to the assembler, while the latter performs some substitutions for register locations.
extern int errno;

int syscall3(int num, int arg1, int arg2, int arg3)
 int res;
 __asm__ (
 &quot;int $0x80&quot; /* make the request to the OS */
 : &quot;=a&quot; (res), /* return result in eax (&quot;a&quot;) */
 &quot;+b&quot; (arg1), /* pass arg1 in ebx (&quot;b&quot;) [as a &quot;+&quot; output because the syscall may change it] */
 &quot;+c&quot; (arg2), /* pass arg2 in ecx (&quot;c&quot;) [ditto] */
 &quot;+d&quot; (arg3) /* pass arg3 in edx (&quot;d&quot;) [ditto] */
 : &quot;a&quot; (num) /* pass system call number in eax (&quot;a&quot;) */
 : &quot;memory&quot;, &quot;cc&quot;, /* announce to the compiler that the memory and condition codes have been modified */
 &quot;esi&quot;, &quot;edi&quot;, &quot;ebp&quot;); /* these registers are clobbered [changed by the syscall] too */

/* The operating system will return a negative value on error;
 * wrappers return -1 on error and set the errno global variable */
 if (-125 &lt;= res &amp;&amp; res &lt; 0) {
 errno = -res;
 res = -1;
 return res;


=== Processor-specific instruction in D ===
This example of inline assembly from the D programming language shows code that computes the tangent of x using the x86&#x27;s FPU (x87) instructions.
// Compute the tangent of x
real tan(real x)
 asm
 fld x[EBP] ; // load x
 fxam ; // test for oddball values
 fstsw AX ;
 sahf ;
 jc trigerr ; // C0 = 1: x is NAN, infinity, or empty
 // 387&#x27;s can handle denormals
SC18: fptan ;
 fstp ST(0) ; // dump X, which is always 1
 fstsw AX ;
 sahf ; // if (!(fp_status &amp; 0x20)) goto Lret
 jnp Lret ; // C2 = 1: x is out of range, do argument reduction
 fldpi ; // load pi
 fxch ;
SC17: fprem1 ; // reminder (partial)
 fstsw AX ;
 sahf ;
 jp SC17 ; // C2 = 1: partial reminder, need to loop
 fstp ST(1) ; // remove pi from stack
 jmp SC18 ;
trigerr:
 return real.nan;
Lret: // No need to manually return anything as the value is already on FP stack
}
The followed by conditional jump idiom is used to access the x87 FPU status word bits C0 and C2. stores the status in a general-purpose register; sahf sets the FLAGS register to the higher 8 bits of the register; and the jump is used to judge on whatever flag bit that happens to correspond to the FPU status bit.

<doc id="1031966" wikidata="Q329337" url="?curid=1031966" title="Gonville Bromhead">
<text>Major Gonville Bromhead VC (29 August 1845 – 9 February 1891) was a British Army officer and recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for valour in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to members of the British armed forces. He received the medal for his part in the defence of Rorke&#x27;s Drift in January 1879, in which a small British garrison of 139 soldiers successfully repulsed an assault by some 4,000 Zulu warriors. Bromhead was portrayed by Michael Caine in the film &quot;Zulu&quot;, which depicted the battle.

Born into a notable military family, Bromhead was brought up in Thurlby, Lincolnshire. He entered the 24th Regiment of Foot as an ensign in 1867 and was promoted to lieutenant in 1871. Bromhead&#x27;s battalion was deployed to southern Africa in 1878 and subsequently served in the Ninth Cape Frontier War and the Anglo-Zulu War. He spent most of the remainder of his career in south Asia, where he was promoted to major in 1883 and saw service in the Third Anglo-Burmese War. He died in 1891 in Allahabad, India, at the age of 45.

==Early life==
Gonville Bromhead was born on 29 August 1845 in Versailles, France. He was the youngest child born to Maj. Sir Edmund de Gonville Bromhead, 3rd Baronet, and his wife Judith. He came from a notable military family: his great-grandfather, Boardman Bromhead, fought under Major General James Wolfe at Quebec; his grandfather, Sir Gonville Bromhead, was a lieutenant general who fought in the American Revolutionary War; his father was a veteran of the Battle of Waterloo; and his three older brothers were officers in the British Army.

His family resided at Thurlby Hall in Thurlby, Lincolnshire, and he was educated at Magnus Grammar School in Newark-on-Trent. After purchasing an ensign&#x27;s commission he entered the 2nd Battalion 24th Regiment of Foot on 20 April 1867, and was promoted to lieutenant on 28 October 1871. Nicknamed &quot;Gunny&quot; by his colleagues, Bromhead was an accomplished boxer and cricketer for the regimental team, and was popular with the men under his command. During his career he developed hearing problems which became progressively worse. However, according to historian Ian Knight, contrary to popular belief, Bromhead&#x27;s deafness did not affect his ability to command his men. Nevertheless, Bromhead was not highly regarded by his commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Henry James Degacher, who privately described him as &quot;hopeless&quot;.

On 1 February 1878, Bromhead&#x27;s battalion was dispatched to the British Cape Colony in response to a request for reinforcements to assist in the Ninth Cape Frontier War. Arriving at East London on 9 March, Bromhead&#x27;s B Company took part in several offensive operations at the conclusion of the war. During an assault on a Xhosa position in May, the company&#x27;s commanding officer, Captain A.G. Godwin-Austen, was wounded by a shot accidentally fired by one of his own men. He was consequently sent back to England to recover, and command of the company temporarily passed to Bromhead. In August the battalion was sent to Pietermaritzburg, Natal, to prepare for the invasion of Zululand.

==Rorke&#x27;s Drift==

At the outbreak of the Anglo-Zulu War, Bromhead&#x27;s battalion was assigned to Lord Chelmsford&#x27;s main invasion column which entered Zulu territory on 11 January 1879. The column crossed the border on the Buffalo River near an isolated mission station named Rorke&#x27;s Drift, which was used as a staging post, and advanced to the east where it set up camp at Isandlwana. However, along with a large contingent of Natal Native Contingent (NNC) troops, Bromhead&#x27;s company was ordered to stay behind and guard the mission station until they were replaced by a detachment from the 2nd Battalion 4th Regiment which was en route from the rear.

At noon on 22 January the garrison&#x27;s senior officer, Major Henry Spalding (Chelmsford&#x27;s quartermaster general), received news of a Zulu presence in the area, and departed from Rorke&#x27;s Drift in order to ascertain the whereabouts of reinforcements due from Helpmekaar. Consequently, Lieutenant John Chard, a Royal Engineer who had been given the task of maintaining the cable ferry across the river, was left as the senior officer. At around 15:00 a small number of dishevelled horsemen appeared with news that the camp at Isandlwana had been overwhelmed by a Zulu army that was probably on its way to attack Rorke&#x27;s Drift. Acting Assistant Commissary James Dalton, an experienced former sergeant in the 85th Regiment, persuaded Bromhead and Chard that the best option was to remain at the station rather than make a fighting retreat. Rorke&#x27;s Drift comprised two single-storey buildings approximately apart: the western building was being used as a makeshift hospital and the eastern building had been converted into a storehouse. Moving swiftly, the garrison erected a defensive perimeter between the two buildings using mealie bags from the storehouse while the hospital walls were loopholed.
The appearance of some 4,000 Zulu warriors approaching the station just after 16:00 caused the contingent of NNC troops to panic and flee, reducing the number of defenders to approximately 139 men. Armed primarily with assegais the Zulus charged at the garrison but were cut down by the British volley fire. Nevertheless, the Zulus pressed on with repeated charges, particularly along a weak point to the north of the hospital where Bromhead and his men became embroiled in fierce hand-to-hand combat with their opponents. At around 18:00, with the thinly manned perimeter becoming increasingly difficult to defend, Chard ordered the defenders to abandon the perimeter around the hospital and withdraw to a smaller second line of defence by the storehouse.

Bromhead took up a position alongside Private Frederick Hitch at the corner of the barricade most exposed to Zulu sniper fire, and used &quot;his rifle and revolver with deadly aim&quot; while encouraging his men &quot;not to waste one round&quot;. At this point Bromhead had a near miss when, unbeknownst to him, a Zulu warrior jumped the barrier intending to spear him. However, his attacker threw himself back over the wall when Hitch presented his unloaded rifle. Hitch was later shot through the shoulder and after he was bandaged up Bromhead gave him his revolver which enabled Hitch to continue shooting with one arm. Waves of Zulu attacks continued during the night but, by the early hours of the morning, their enthusiasm for battle waned and they departed from the area. British reinforcements arrived later that morning.

===Aftermath===
Bromhead and the other uninjured survivors remained at Rorke&#x27;s Drift for several weeks after the battle. Wary of another Zulu attack, the garrison constructed crude stone walls around the perimeter and named the fortification &quot;Fort Bromhead&quot;. During this time Bromhead became withdrawn and lethargic, possibly experiencing psychological trauma from the battle. Major Francis Clery, who was garrisoned at Rorke&#x27;s Drift with Bromhead after the battle wrote, &quot;the height of [Bromhead&#x27;s] enjoyment seemed to be to sit all day on a stone on the ground smoking a most uninviting looking pipe. The only thing that seemed equal to moving him in any way was an allusion to the defence of Rorke&#x27;s Drift. This used to have a sort of electrical effect upon him, for he would jump up and off he would go, not a word could be got out of him. When I told him he should send me an official report on the affair it seemed to have a most distressing effect on him.&quot;

After news of the disastrous defeat at Isandlwana, the successful defence of Rorke&#x27;s Drift was celebrated by the British press and public. As the officers in command, Chard and Bromhead were singled out for particular praise. However, some of their fellow officers resented the plaudits bestowed on the pair, believing that they merely performed their duty by defending the outpost. Chelmsford&#x27;s successor, Lieutenant-General Sir Garnet Wolseley, described the praise as &quot;monstrous&quot;. A bemused Clery remarked that &quot;Reputations are being made and lost here in an almost comical fashion... [Bromhead is a] capital fellow at everything except soldiering&quot; while Lieutenant Henry Curling, who was also at Rorke&#x27;s Drift with Bromhead after the battle, wrote &quot;It is very amusing to read the accounts of Chard and Bromhead... Bromhead is a stupid old fellow, as deaf as a post. Is it not curious how some men are forced into notoriety?&quot; Nevertheless, on 2 May it was announced that as a result of the action Bromhead had been promoted to captain and brevet major, and he had been awarded the Victoria Cross, the highest decoration for gallantry that could be awarded to British troops. The citation for the award was published in the &quot;London Gazette&quot;:

==Later career and death==
On Bromhead&#x27;s return to England, the villagers of Thurlby presented him with an illuminated address and a revolver, and the citizens of Lincoln awarded him a sword in recognition of his services in the Zulu campaign. He and Chard were invited to dine with Queen Victoria at Balmoral, but Bromhead was fishing in Ireland and did not receive the invitation until the date had passed. The Queen did not invite him again, but instead sent him a photograph of herself. Bromhead was posted to Gibraltar in 1880, and in August was dispatched to India, where he remained until March 1881. He then returned to England, where he attended the School of Musketry, Hythe, between October and December 1882, and gained a First Class Extra Certificate. He returned to India in 1883 with his battalion, which was based at Secunderabad, and was promoted to full major on 4 April that year. From 27 October 1886 to 24 May 1888 he served in Burma, where the battalion took part in the Third Anglo-Burmese War, being used to pacify the north of the region. The battalion was subsequently posted to Allahabad, India, where Bromhead died of typhoid fever on 9 February 1891.

==Legacy==
Bromhead was buried in the New Cantonment Cemetery in Allahabad. His Victoria Cross medal is owned by his family, and is displayed at the Regimental Museum of The Royal Welsh in Brecon in Wales.

Michael Caine, in his first major film role, portrayed Bromhead in the 1964 film &quot;Zulu&quot;, which was based on the Battle of Rorke&#x27;s Drift. In the film Caine depicts him as a foppish aristocrat who fought well when the battle began. Bromhead is a main character in Peter Ho Davies&#x27;s story &quot;Relief&quot;, which appeared first in &quot;The Paris Review&quot; and was later published in Davies&#x27;s 1997 collection &quot;The Ugliest House in the World&quot;.

<doc id="1031971" wikidata="Q637164" url="?curid=1031971" title="Baby Einstein">
<text>Baby Einstein, stylized as baby einstein, is an American franchise and line of multimedia products, including home video programs, CDs, books, flash cards, toys, and baby gear that specialize in interactive activities for infants and toddlers under three years old, created by Julie Aigner-Clark. The franchise is produced by The Baby Einstein Company (formerly known as I Think I Can Productions).

The videos show babies, toddlers and preschoolers under three years simple patterns, puppet shows, and familiar objects, such as everyday items, animals, and toys that are often accompanied by reorchestrated classical music written by composers such as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Ludwig van Beethoven, Johann Sebastian Bach, Antonio Vivaldi, Johannes Brahms, George Frideric Handel, and many others, as well as some traditional rhymes. The video series is also known for its puppets, which are all animals who seldom speak, mostly communicating in simple sounds and their respective animal noises.

The Baby Einstein Company has also released a companion series aimed at preschoolers, called &quot;Little Einsteins&quot;, and made a new sister show called &quot;WeeSchool&quot; in 2016, which was also created by Clark.

Baby Einstein was introduced to the public in 1996, and remained a small company until Clark sold it to Disney. Between November 7, 2001, and October 13, 2013, Disney owned and operated the Baby Einstein brand. Starting on October 14, 2013, Kids II, Inc. owns and operates the Baby Einstein brand.

==History==
The Baby Einstein Company was founded in 1996 by former teacher and stay-at-home mom Julie Aigner-Clark at her home in suburban Alpharetta, Georgia, as I Think I Can Productions. According to an interview with Julie Dunn, she wanted her babies to be exposed to classical music, poetry, colors, shapes, and more. Aigner-Clark and her husband borrowed video equipment and invested $15,000 of their own savings to produce the initial product, a VHS cassette they named &quot;Baby Einstein&quot; and later sold as &quot;Language Nursery&quot; in 2002 to avoid confusion with the Baby Einstein brand as a whole.

The original video shows a variety of toys and visuals interspersed with music, stories, numbers, and words spoken in seven different languages: English, French, Spanish, Japanese, German, Hebrew, and Russian. Eventually, the video was marketed across the United States, Europe, Asia, and Australia. It even won the 1997 Parenting Magazine award for Best Video of the Year. Other videos followed like Baby Mozart and Baby Bach,

some featuring the Clarks&#x27; two daughters, Aspen and Sierra, as well as other children.

It quickly became a multimillion-dollar franchise; its revenue grew from $1 million in 1998 to $25 million in 2001. Julie Aigner-Clark renamed the company as Aigner-Clark Productions in 1998, then the Baby Einstein Company the following year, and on February 10, 2000, Artisan Entertainment announced they had acquired a minority stake in the company in exchange for a North American home video distribution agreement under the FHE Kids sub-label of Family Home Entertainment.

On November 6, 2001, The Walt Disney Company announced they had acquired The Baby Einstein Company for an undisclosed amount. Julie Aigner-Clark stepped down from directing Baby Einstein videos after Baby Beethoven in 2002. Disney rereleased the Baby Einstein videos previously distributed by FHE Kids in 2002-2003, then produced re-edited versions of the Aigner-Clark videos in 2004. These changes were mainly done with the toys and some titular changes in the credits. 

The concept and popularity of Baby Einstein expanded as a Disney property. Educational toys and additional videos were developed. Baby Einstein was also the source of inspiration for a preschool-aimed television series called &quot;Little Einsteins&quot;, created by the Disney-owned Baby Einstein Company and animated by Curious Pictures. The series began with a direct-to-video film in August 2005, with regular episodes airing on Playhouse Disney starting in October of that year. Reruns of the show continued on Disney Junior well after it ended in 2009.

The success of Baby Einstein was estimated to be nearly $400 million based on revenues. Julie was named &quot;Entrepreneur of the Year&quot; and won various awards, and one in three U.S. households with babies were found to own at least one Baby Einstein product. It received positive media and Aigner-Clark appeared on the &quot;Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;, &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, &quot;The Today Show&quot;, and &quot;USA Today&quot;, among others. President George W. Bush mentioned the Baby Einstein Company in his 2007 State of the Union address, which Aigner-Clark was invited to attend.

In 2008, Clark, along with actress Jennifer Garner, hosted a tenth anniversary party for &quot;Baby Einstein&quot;. Clark had also announced plans to launch a toddler brand called &quot;Einstein Pals&quot;, including a line Baby Einstein video, but it was all abandoned for reasons unknown.

As a result of Baby Einstein being named after Albert Einstein, royalties had to be paid to Corbis which compensates the Einstein estate. This made Einstein one of the top five earning dead celebrities.

On October 14, 2013, The Walt Disney Company announced they had sold the &quot;Baby Einstein&quot; brand to Kids II, Inc., a longtime licensee of the property. While Kids II Inc. produces baby toys for Baby Einstein, the videos have been out of print since their acquisition. However, the videos are available on YouTube officially. 

==Controversy==

===FTC complaint===
In May 2006, the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood (CCFC) filed a complaint with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) against the Baby Einstein Company and similar companies for false advertising. The CCFC alleged false advertising based on an American Academy of Pediatrics recommendation that children under two should be discouraged from watching television. It also cited studies showing that only 6% of parents were aware of that recommendation, whereas 49% thought educational videos were very important in children&#x27;s intellectual development. 
In December 2007, the FTC closed the complaint, noting that some of the CCFC&#x27;s claims did not raise issues under the FTC&#x27;s substantiation rules. The FTC also considered the redesign of the Baby Einstein website, which removed certain product testimonials and product descriptions, as well as the company&#x27;s promise to make sure that advertising claims about products&#x27; educational and developmental value would be properly substantiated.

===Language development===
A 2010 study published in &quot;Psychological Science&quot; demonstrated that children who viewed the videos regularly for one month, with or without their parents, &quot;showed no greater understanding of words from the program than kids who never saw it&quot;. On the other hand, children who were taught by their parents improved the most; researchers speculated that this was probably because children learn best &quot;through meaningful gestures and interactive communication with parents&quot;. In response to these new findings, Disney offered refunds to parents whose children did not see improvement, even though Bob Iger, CEO of the Walt Disney Company, demanded a retraction (of the press release) when a similarly unsupportive study was announced in 2007.

The 2007 study, based on telephone interviews with parents, had been published in the &quot;Journal of Pediatrics&quot; and resulted in a lawsuit by the company&#x27;s founders due to widespread negative media coverage stemming from the article. The press release announcing the study explained that for each hour spent watching baby DVDs/videos, infants understood on average six to eight fewer words than infants who did not watch them. The University of Washington researchers Frederick Zimmerman, Dimitri Christakis, and Andrew Meltzoff had claimed that, among infants aged 8 to 16 months, exposure to &quot;baby DVDs/videos&quot; such as &quot;Baby Einstein&quot; and &quot;Brainy Baby&quot; was strongly associated with lower scores on a Communicative Development Inventory, a standard language development test. The Baby Einstein Company expressed &quot;serious concerns about the many contradictions&quot; in the study. Although University of Washington President Mark Emmert rejected Disney&#x27;s claims, in 2010, the university settled with the founders, paying out $175,000 in back legal fees and turned over the study&#x27;s data to the Baby Einstein founders.

In March 2008, the &quot;Journal of Pediatrics&quot; released a study by Harvard University and the Boston Children&#x27;s Hospital&#x27;s Center on Media and Child Health showing that television viewing is, “neither beneficial nor deleterious to child cognitive and language abilities” for children under 2, in a study that examined all television rather than just education DVDs for babies. In January 2010, the founders requested that a judge order the University of Washington to release records for the 2007 study, saying, “Given that other research studies have not shown the same outcomes, we would like the raw data and analytical methods from the Washington studies so we can audit their methodology, and perhaps duplicate the studies&quot;. In 2013, the original dataset was reanalyzed by independent scholars who concluded that it was safest to suggest that baby videos had minimal impact on language development and that linking baby videos to decreased language development was not well supported by the data.

<doc id="1031978" wikidata="Q2045302" url="?curid=1031978" title="Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr (1894–1948)">
<text>Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr (20 March 1894 – 3 December 1948) was a South African politician and intellectual in the years preceding apartheid. In his lifetime he was regarded as one of the cleverest men in the country, and it was widely expected that he would eventually become Prime Minister of South Africa. He came from a well-known Afrikaner family; his uncle, also Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr but known affectionately as &quot;Onze Jan&quot; among fellow Afrikaners, was a famous figure in the Afrikaans language movement.

== Early life ==

Hofmeyr was born in Cape Town on 20 March 1894. He was baptised Jan Frederick Hendrik Hofmeyr, but the middle-name Frederick fell into disuse quickly. Later in his life he would be known to many as &quot;Hoffie&quot;, this diminutive form of his surname even being used in cartoons of Hofmeyr published in South African newspapers. He was raised by his widowed mother Deborah, a cousin to Christiaan Beyers, after his father Andries Brink Hofmeyr died when Jan was three years old. Deborah had another son who was five years older than Jan, his brother Andries Beyers Hofmeyr. Jan also had two half-sisters from his father&#x27;s previous marriage. Deborah devoted most of her energies to Jan, and he was the child with whom she had by far the strongest bond. This strong relationship was probably formed when Jan fell ill with hydrocephaly at age two; he soon recovered and according to the medical wisdom of the day it was felt that he would either become a genius or an idiot. As it turned out he would be a genius.
Jan was first educated at the illustrious South African College Schools, which he entered in January 1902. A child prodigy, he progressed rapidly through its grades so that he matriculated four years later in 1906. He went on to study classics at the University of Cape Town (then still known as the South African College) and in 1909 graduated B.A. with first-class Honours at the age of 15. At this time he was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship to study at Oxford. He accepted the award but only made use of it a few years later when he was older. In the meanwhile he took another B.A. in the sciences in 1910 and an M.A. in classics in 1911, when he was just seventeen years old. Apart from his studies, Hofmeyr also became active in the university&#x27;s Debating Society (succeeding Oliver Schreiner as its president), worked as treasurer in its college magazine, and volunteered in its Students&#x27; Christian Association.

In 1911, when he was just seventeen, Hofmeyr was commissioned to write a biography of his uncle, &quot;Onze Jan&quot; Hofmeyr. The project was undertaken with the supervision of former President of the Orange Free State, F. W. Reitz. The project was completed within a year, the younger Hofmeyr having written it in English and then translated it into Dutch.

== Oxford ==

In September 1913, Hofmeyr sailed from Cape Town and finally went to Balliol College, Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar. He again studied classics, and in his first year became friends with John Macmurray and debated at the Oxford Union against Harold Laski, Harold Macmillan, and others. The First World War soon emptied the colleges there, but Hofmeyr stayed on, not being obliged to fight on either side. Once he had finished with his studies at Oxford, Hofmeyr considered joining the YMCA as a non-combatant, which would have meant serving the South African troops that were stationed in East Africa. Again Hofmeyr distinguished himself in his academic efforts, coming first in Classical Moderations and Greats. In later years he became an Honorary Fellow of Balliol.

At Oxford he participated in student religious activities once more, and became a member of the Student Christian Union, at one point even becoming an evangelical; but he probably found his greatest happiness in Oxford when he joined the Balliol Boys&#x27; Club. He would hold this commitment to voluntary youth service throughout his life, attending Student Christian Association camps back home in South Africa, even when he was the Administrator of the Transvaal Province, at one time even donating to the society a camp site which was located in Anerley, in Natal and is still running to this day. At one of these camps he met the author Alan Paton, and they formed a lasting friendship.

== Teaching ==

On his return from Oxford in June 1916, Hofmeyr was appointed to lecture Classics at his alma mater, the South African College, Cape Town. He moved on quickly, applied for and got a professorship in Classics at the South African School of Mines. The city of Johannesburg had wanted its own university for some time and had created nine new departments in the arts and sciences. He still lived with his mother, and they took a house together in the Johannesburg suburb of Yeoville.

Thanks to his prodigious intellect and his achievements, Hofmeyr had become quite famous, and was in demand as a public speaker. He spoke mainly about Afrikaner history, specifically the desires of Afrikaner nationalism as opposed to British imperialism. Hofmeyr&#x27;s own line was that the two need not have been mutually exclusive, that Afrikaners could have a national identity without separating their country from the British Empire as the republicanists were clamouring to do. In this attitude, Hofmeyr was emulating his famous uncle. Onze Jan Hofmeyr believed in bridging the divides between English and Afrikaans South Africans, a divide that had been fuelled by the British annexation of the diamond fields in 1871, the annexation of the Transvaal in 1877, and the concentration camps of the Anglo-Boer War. It was a political compromise that did not always endear either man to their audiences.

Hofmeyr was not only an intellectual. He also had a prolific capacity for administration. These talents came to the fore when the young professor was appointed to sub-committees of the university senate. But at the end of 1918 he chose to move back to Cape Town, taking up the new Chair of Greek at the newly named University of Cape Town. The School of Mines was disappointed to lose him so soon and their Council decided in March 1919 to offer him the principalship of their fledgling university, after the previous Principal had died. After some misgivings about being suited for the job he accepted.

The principal was given the enormous task of expanding the university which then only had 301 students, a corps that could easily have been 10 times bigger in a city as big as Johannesburg. One of the first steps was to change the name from South African School of Mines into the University of the Witwatersrand. At his inaugural address, Hofmeyr discussed the nature of a university, its desired function in a democracy. One specific topic he addressed was the so-called &quot;Native problem&quot; that was facing South Africa:

They [South African universities] have not, to any great extent, applied themselves to the solution of our South African problems... Biggest of all is the Native problem, most difficult and yet most specially South African of them all – in essence the eternal problem of the reconciliation of justice and apparent expediency – a problem in regard to which our colleges have been almost entirely silent.

Hofmeyr was of the opinion that universities &quot;should know no distinctions of class, wealth, race or creed&quot;.

One of his first duties entailed selling the Mine School&#x27;s original Plein Square site and developing the university&#x27;s newer Milner Park site. His administrative duties were carried out smoothly, but the young principal was having less ease in earning the respect and co-operation of some staff. The situation reached an impasse when Council and Senate of the university disagreed on Hofmeyr&#x27;s (apparently unfair) dismissal of the Dean of the Faculty of Medicine. It dragged on for more than a year and caused a deadlock in the university&#x27;s administration that was only fully resolved once the trajectory of Hofmeyr&#x27;s own career took him away from the university and propelled him into politics.

In 1921 he published, in collaboration with Prof. T. J. Haarhoff, a pamphlet entitled &quot;Studies in Ancient Imperialism&quot;, an analysis of the later Roman empire. Hofmeyr admired the emperor Augustus in particular. He regarded Augustus, John Bright, and his uncle Onze Jan as models for his own political views.

== Administratorship of the Transvaal ==
Hofmeyr had flirted with the possibility of pursuing politics as a career for some time. Already in January 1919 the acting Prime Minister F.S. Malan had approached the young Hofmeyr, trying to sway him to join the South African Party as its Chief Organising Secretary. Hofmeyr declined. The offer was repeated the following year, but this time by the party&#x27;s leader, General Jan Smuts. Again Hofmeyr declined. His hesitation was apparently due to an unwillingness of committing himself to party politics; he wanted to be of service to his country but did not want to &quot;give up for party what was meant for mankind&quot;. It was thus that he became administrator of the Transvaal province. Hofmeyr did not have to campaign in an election to get this job, the position of provincial administrator was strictly acquired through appointment by a sitting Prime Minister, who at that time was Jan Smuts. Still reluctant to join a party on either side of the political spectrum, Hofmeyr felt rather that the position of administrator did not entail loyalty to the agenda of a specific party, but an unbiased loyalty to the entire province.

He began working as Transvaal administrator on 1 March 1924 yet, due to contractual obligations, remained on as principal of the University of the Witwatersand for another five months. Hofmeyr stayed on in the University Council after relinquishing the principalship.

There were efforts to unseat Hofmeyr during his five-year-long tenure as provincial administrator; these came from members inside the national caucus of the provincial council who doubted Hofmeyr&#x27;s professed impartiality. Soon after occupying his seat he was faced with a curious situation – the South African Party was defeated in a national election by the National Party, which meant that a new Prime Minister replaced the man who had appointed Hofmeyr. Constitutionally Hofmeyr was under no obligation to resign and he conveyed his willingness of staying on to the country&#x27;s new leader, General J.B.M. Hertzog, citing that he did not view his job as party-political in its nature. Hertzog allowed him to stay on, even when Hofmeyr appointed an Englishman as Director of Education in the Transvaal while National Party&#x27;s politicians were urging him in the strongest terms to appoint an Afrikaner.

It was a time when language policy was shaping the political landscape in South Africa. The National platform was to elevate Afrikaans and Afrikaners as a political force, with the eventual desire of creating a South African republic; while the South African Party wanted to create a &quot;fusion government&quot;, which meant unifying English speaking South Africans with Afrikaners who were willing to remain loyal to the British Crown. This was nothing new to Hofmeyr; his uncle Onze Jan had been active in this sphere throughout his career and had always had sympathy with English as language medium, and with the British Empire. On 31 May 1928 – the 18th celebration of Union Day and the first hoisting of a newly designed South African flag – Hofmeyr addressed the nation by radio broadcast, urging for &quot;the coming together of the two larger parties in South Africa, and the formation of a great new party of all those who have the same general outlook&quot;. He was choosing sides and would soon enter the arena of party-politics.

== Active politician ==

Hofmeyr chose to oppose the government of the day and entered parliament in 1929 as the South African Party&#x27;s member for Johannesburg North. For his maiden speech he chose to speak out against an Immigration Quota Bill that had been tabled by D.F. Malan to restrict Jewish immigration into South Africa. The National Party was already espousing antisemitic policies that would eventually make them sympathetic to Adolf Hitler and to Nazi Germany. Though delivered from memory Hofmeyr&#x27;s speech was not a success; he was too long-winded and too academic, so that even though he championed the rights of his many Jewish constituents he appeared to be fence-sitting. Hofmeyer was a supporter of Zionism.

During the 1930s the South African parliament spent an enormous effort in legislating various issues surrounding what was called &quot;the Native Problem&quot;. In effect, the cornerstone of what later became known as apartheid was already being laid. This resulted in a series of Bills discriminating against indigenous peoples such as the Riotous Assemblies Bill, the Native Service Contract Bill, an abortive Mixed Marriages Bill, the Representation of Natives Bill, the Native Trust and Land Bill, and the Native Laws Amendment Bill. There was also discriminatory legislation being tabled with regards to South Africa&#x27;s growing Indian population: the Asiatic Bill, the Provincial Legislative Powers Extension Bill, and the European Women&#x27;s Restriction of Employment Bill were all meant to prevent the Indian business owners from having white people in their employ. Hofmeyr spoke out against most of these discriminatory laws, progressively becoming more liberal as the two governments of that decade became more reactionary. A notable blemish on his record is his silence regarding the Native Laws Amendment Bill, which proposed to control the migration of black workers from rural areas into cities and towns, and also to control where the black workers inside cities and towns were allowed to live. Nevertheless, his attitudes towards non-whites was at the vanguard of liberal opinion for that time. Whenever he recognised injustice in parliament and in his country, he was one of only a handful of leaders who did not hesitate to speak out against it.

National politicians had hoped that Hofmeyr would sympathise with their aspirations for Afrikaner supremacy. They were disappointed; even though Hofmeyr always remained cordial to Hertzog, the Prime Minister, he was a staunch critic of D.F. Malan, who was then the Minister of Education. When Malan introduced his Higher Education Control Bill into parliament, hoping to gain for himself a rigid control of university appointments and budgets throughout the nation, Hofmeyr attacked the Bill as a curtailment of academic freedom, saying that Malan was hoping to become &quot;the Grand Inquisitor of institutions of higher education&quot;.

Long before his election Hofmeyr had been in demand as a public speaker. When speaking about politics he was always asking for a realignment of South African politics away from the crass divides that polarised Afrikaners and English South Africans. Thus in 1933 he helped negotiate a coalition between J.B.M. Hertzog and Jan Smuts, along with a fusion of their two parties. Consequently, he spent the rest of his life as a member of the United Party.

Whilst a Cabinet Minister, Hofmeyr was the inaugural Patron of the Transvaal Inter-Race Cricket Board from 1936.

== Minister ==

Hertzog became leader of the new party and thus remained Prime Minister. Smuts was his deputy. As a compromise the two men split their new cabinet down the middle. Hofmeyr was one of six who Smuts nominated for the cabinet. As it turned out, Hofmeyr was awarded the portfolios for Education, Interior, and Public Health. Before fusion these exact portfolios had belonged to D.F. Malan, but the latter had refused to be a part of Fusion and broke away from Hertzog to form a Purified National Party.
Smuts did a great deal to hold the fusion government together. This involved a great show of capitulation towards Hertzog&#x27;s legislative agenda. Hofmeyr was not inclined to behave in this manner and showed an almost inflexible adherence to principle. So when other cabinet members leant over backwards in the interests of staying in government, Hofmeyr stood alone to oppose destructive legislation such as the laws aimed at removing the black franchise. Any patience that he had wore out when Hertzog appointed A. P. J. Fourie to the Senate as a senator specially &quot;acquainted with the reasonable wants and wishes of the Coloured people of South Africa&quot;. Hofmeyr protested that the new senator had none of these qualifications and he resigned from the Cabinet. Later he also left the party caucus because of his opposition to the Asiatics Bill, which restricted Indians from buying land except in defined areas. In 1938 it looked as if Hofmeyr might form his own party; there was encouragement for him to form a Liberal Party. Any such designs were nipped in the bud when Britain declared war on Germany after Hitler invaded Poland.

== Second World War ==

The United Party finally split over the war. Hertzog was not prepared to declare war on Germany, as Britain had done in September 1939. At that time South Africa was a Dominion and also a member of the then British Commonwealth. Many expected fully that South Africa would throw her full weight behind Britain in that new year. Governor General Sir Patrick Duncan asked Parliament to vote on the issue and—after a convincing show of support for Britain—Hertzog resigned, leaving Smuts to become Prime Minister once more. Hofmeyr was approached to rejoin the cabinet and accepted the offer without hesitation.

He became the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Education, and soon he became the closest advisor of Jan Smuts. He acted as Prime Minister during the Second World War, in which Smuts was heavily involved. This multi-tasking of jobs had become a habit continued throughout Hofmeyr&#x27;s career. In cabinet he could at times handle six or seven ministerial portfolios simultaneously, even while acting as prime minister in Smuts&#x27;s absence. This work ethic would lead to burnout and was catastrophic for Hofmeyr&#x27;s health.

== Death ==
Hofmeyr died in Johannesburg on 3 December 1948, almost six months after the National Party came to power with their slogan of apartheid. He was buried two days later from the Dutch Reformed Church in Bosman Street. His funeral procession was two miles long, of which the streets were lined by thousands of people, an estimated 10,000 present in total. General Jan Smuts paid tribute to Hofmeyr both at the graveside, and on the evening before in a national radio broadcast. Of Hofmeyr he said:

:: Here was the wonder child of South Africa, with a record with which South Africa shows no parallel, who from his youngest years beat all records, whose achievement in a comparatively brief life shows no parallel in this land, and whose star at the end was still rising ...
He has passed on, but his service and the high spirit in which he sought to serve his country and his fellow-men of all races remain our abiding possessions.
This is a better and richer country for his service, and his message will not be forgotten.

His death was premature and to some extent caused by the heavy burden of all the work that Smuts had entrusted to him. Smuts may have helped to win the war in Europe, but at home he lost not only an election, but also the best and most likely candidate to continue his legacy. South Africa lost one of the clearest liberal voices in its politics.

== Legacy ==

Hofmeyr&#x27;s insight into racial issues was captured in many statements that Hofmeyr made, particularly concerning the rights of non-white people in South Africa. Honorary degrees were conferred on him by the University of Cape Town (D.Sc.), Witwatersrand (LLD) and Oxford (D.C.L.).

The University of the Witwatersrand has turned the one-time administrator&#x27;s house into a museum and restaurant, called Hofmeyr House. His papers are housed at the University of Natal as part of its Alan Paton collection. Paton&#x27;s seminal novel &quot;Cry, the Beloved Country&quot; is dedicated to his friend Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr. In 1964, Paton published a Hofmeyr biography. A suburb in the city of Johannesburg, Jan Hofmeyr, was named after him. The grand hall at the South African College High School is named in his honour.

<text>Wang Shiwei (; March 12, 1906 – July 1, 1947) was a Chinese journalist and literary writer. He became famous for his contribution to the Chinese history of modern revolution and to Chinese modern literature. Wang joined the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in 1926, but later wrote critically of some aspects of the Chinese Communist Revolution. Under order from Mao Zedong, he was expelled from the CCP, and executed in 1947.

== Biography ==
=== Family ===
Wang Shiwei, originally named Wang Sidao (王思禱), was born in Guangzhou (光州, now Huangchuan County 潢川) in Henan Province, China on March 12, 1906. His courtesy name was Shuhan (叔翰). His father was a scholar who worked as a teacher in a local school. Wang was the third eldest child in a family of eight brothers and sisters. His father&#x27;s income as a teacher was not sufficient to sustain the large family.

=== Education ===
Wang received his initial education in Chinese classics from his father, which began the development of his knowledge of Chinese literature. In 1914, he entered Huangchuan Second Higher Primary school () for primary three education. Later, he went to Henan Seventh Secondary School located in Huangchuan (now Huangchuan 2nd Middle School, 潢川第二中學). He eventually left his hometown and entered the Fundamental School of Europe. He was forced to leave this school a year later, as his family could no longer afford the costly fees. Determined to further his studies, he worked in a post office to save money; at the age of 17, he joined the American Exchange Studies program in Henan Province.

In 1925, Wang got a chance to study arts at Peking University. There he actively participated in the university&#x27;s student campaigns. However, he was once again forced to quit in 1927, but was again able to start studying during the late 1920s and early 1930s, this time at the Marx-Engels Institute in Moscow. While at Peking University, his schoolmates included communist activists Chen Qichang and Wang Fanxi, Chen possibly being the one who introduced the Chinese Communist Party to Wang Shiwei. Chen and Wang Fanxi, however, broke with the CCP and joined Trotskyists. Wang Shiwei&#x27;s early association with the two later became part of the accusation by Kang Sheng that he was a crypto-Trotskyist.

=== Involvement in politics ===
Wang was an active participant in political activity. In 1919, Wang and his classmates joined the May Fourth Movement demonstrations in support of Beijing students. Entering Beijing University in 1925, he participated in student politics and joined the CCP in 1926. Leaving a year later, for the criticism of his love affair with Li Fen (), who was also a communist member. However, he rejoined the CCP when Mao Zedong became the chairman. During his studies in Moscow, Wang formed the Twenty-Eight Bolsheviks together with other Chinese students such as Wang Ming and Ding Ling.

==Imprisonment and execution==
By 1942, Wang was working for the &quot;Liberation Daily&quot; () where he wrote the essay &quot;Wild Lilies&quot; (), criticizing Mao Zedong&#x27;s taste for beautiful women, as well as what he called the unjustified privileges enjoyed by members of the CCP. It discussed the &quot;ugliness and indifference&quot; of Yan&#x27;an; also criticizing some &quot;big men&quot; in the CCP whom Wang thought were responsible for the &quot;growth of darkness&quot; in China.

The article caused significant backlash. Mao&#x27;s Talks at the Yan&#x27;an Forum in May laid down the official line demanding that art serve politics. On 27 May 1942, the Central Committee held a seminar to discuss whether Wang was guilty. On 23 October, under the orders of Mao, Wang was expelled from the CCP on the oncharge that he was one of the &quot;Five Member Anti-Party Gang&quot; of Trotskyites () who were alleged to have sought to take over the Chinese Communist Party, and that he was disrupting party unity.

Wang&#x27;s defense was that he was not involved in any Trotskyist activities, except for helping his friends Wang Wenyuan () and Chen Qichang (who at the time was known as &quot;Chen Qingchen&quot; ) to translate two prose pieces in &quot;Autobiography of Leon Trotsky&quot; (), activities which he had already informed the CCP of.

Wang&#x27;s &quot;trial,&quot; which took the form of a series of struggle sessions held over sixteen days, ended in June 1942 with Wang found guilty and imprisoned. During the trial, he was denounced by figures such as Ding Ling, Chen Boda, and Ai Qing. He remained imprisoned until his execution five years later.

On 1 July 1947, Wang was reportedly chopped to pieces and his remains were thrown down a dry well. Chinese journalist Dai Qing states that Mao did not order the execution, but told his guards: &quot;Neither release nor execute Wang Shiwei.&quot;

Fifteen years later, in 1962, Mao said that Wang was an agent of the Guomindang, but that he shouldn&#x27;t have been executed, and Mao claimed that the decision to kill Wang was made by local security organs, not the central leadership.

Dai Qing&#x27;s seminal work in exhuming the case of the writer Wang Shiwei brings into focus perhaps the single most important case for gauging repressive dimensions of the movement.

== Wang as a writer ==
Wang began writing at the age of 19, when he was studying at Beijing University. He took the pen name of &quot;Shiwei&quot; (), and his talent was greatly appreciated by Xu Zhimo, a contemporary Chinese poet. Xu often ran Wang&#x27;s writings in the Features section of the Morning Post when he was editor-in-chief.

From 1930 onwards he started to use other pen names, still pronounced &quot;Shiwei&quot; but using different characters (詩薇 and 石巍). His novella &quot;Xiuxi&quot; (休息, meaning &quot;rest&quot;), talked about how young people should fight against the darkness of a country and was published in Xu Zhimo&#x27;s &quot;New Literary Collection&quot; in 1930. His work outlined an &quot;ideal society&quot; where equality of opportunity was emphasized; he also incorporated some Marxist thought.

=== &quot;Wild Lilies&quot; ===
Wang attempted to demonstrate two basic elements of journalism in &quot;Wild Lilies.&quot;

The first was that &quot;its practitioners must be allowed to exercise their personal conscience.&quot; An example used to illustrate this is how one day Wang overheard two girls criticizing the apparently inconsiderate behavior of senior leaders towards the public. He later wrote that he was shocked after overhearing the dialogue, and took note of it, later referring to it to make known his concern about the state of the country. He was supposed to have &quot;finally realized&quot; what was lacking in everybody&#x27;s life at that time, and attempted to dig further to what was behind the complaints.

The second was that &quot;it must provide a forum for public criticism.&quot; Wang explained that his piece of work was called &quot;Wild Lilies&quot; because wild lilies grew abundantly in Yan&#x27;an, could stand symbolically for the place and because they had higher medical value than other lilies, though they were bitter to taste, and in this connection criticized unhealthy phenomena in society so remedies could be found. This was also not so discreetly attempting to turn a remark from Mao Zedong on its head. Explaining the crackdown on freedom of expression, Mao said that the CCP&#x27;s actions were &quot;like that of a doctor curing a disease. The whole purpose is to save people, not to cure them to death.&quot; His work was criticised by others and between April and May 1942 &quot;Wild Lilies&quot; was attacked in the newspapers.

=== &quot;Arrow and Target&quot; ===
&quot;Arrow and Target&quot; () was a wall poster newspaper series posted outside the southern gate of Yan&#x27;an City. Wang used the series to elaborate on the concept of journalism that &quot;Its first loyalty is to citizens.&quot; Wang uses the spaces provided in the newspaper series to attack Li Weihan (also known as Luo Mai), the director of the Central research Institute. He told every citizen that injustices were present. This act certainly destroyed the image of the institute. Instead of defending the institute, which he was quite closely connected with, in his column, he alleged to tell the citizens things that they wanted to know, things that were beneficial to them. He is loyal to citizens more than the business owners and advertisers. Therefore, Wang&#x27;s first loyalty was to citizens.

=== Influence ===
Wang&#x27;s works allowed readers, particularly those of Yan&#x27;an, to gain a better understanding of issues like the relationship between politics and literature. Partly as a reaction against the Chinese literature that focused too much on the rules of the CCP in the 1940s, Wang&#x27;s work alerted some to the fact that the education on the rules of the CCP were not practical. He was the first writer in Yan&#x27;an who gave a theoretical reflection on reality in his works; in his &quot;Wild Lilies&quot;, for example, the bureaucracy and hierarchy of Yan&#x27;an were described in vivid detail.

&quot;While it is tempting to characterize the trial of Wang Shiwei as an illustration of the fate awaiting free-thinking intellectuals in a repressive state, it is clear from the questions raised in the first session that the Wang Shiwei trial epitomizes the difficulty of voicing a minority opinion, especially when that opinion is pitted against a more powerful entity such as the state.&quot;

Apart from that, literature in that period emphasized on the skills of writing. There was little concern about the reality. Western literatures were very much appreciated. However, because of the successful and interesting reflection of reality in Wang&#x27;s works, people started to appreciate Chinese literature. Many Chinese writers also began to write more about the reality, examining on the local arts and the Marxist ideas.

Wang&#x27;s eagerness to voice out the inequalities and his critical mind contributed to his success as one of the most representative writers in the period. He also stimulated other writers to think about what they should write about from that onwards.

<doc id="1031984" wikidata="Q1197115" url="?curid=1031984" title="UKUSA Agreement">
<text>The United Kingdom – United States of America Agreement (UKUSA, ) is a multilateral agreement for cooperation in signals intelligence between Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The alliance of intelligence operations is also known as the Five Eyes. In classification markings this is abbreviated as FVEY, with the individual countries being abbreviated as AUS, CAN, NZL, GBR, and USA, respectively.

Emerging from an informal agreement related to the 1941 Atlantic Charter, the secret treaty was renewed with the passage of the 1943 BRUSA Agreement, before being officially enacted on 5 March 1946 by the United Kingdom and the United States. In the following years, it was extended to encompass Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Other countries, known as &quot;third parties&quot;, such as West Germany, the Philippines, and several Nordic countries, also joined the UKUSA community in associate capacities, although they are not part of the mechanism for automatic sharing of intelligence that exists between the Five Eyes.

Much of the sharing of information is performed via the ultra-sensitive STONEGHOST network, which has been claimed to contain &quot;some of the Western world&#x27;s most closely guarded secrets&quot;. Besides laying down rules for intelligence sharing, the agreement formalized and cemented the &quot;Special Relationship&quot; between the UK and the US.

Due to its status as a secret treaty, its existence was not known to the Prime Minister of Australia until 1973, and it was not disclosed to the public until 2005. On 25 June 2010, for the first time in history, the full text of the agreement was publicly released by the United Kingdom and the United States, and can now be viewed online. Shortly after its release, the seven-page UKUSA Agreement was recognized by &quot;Time&quot; magazine as one of the Cold War&#x27;s most important documents, with immense historical significance.

The global surveillance disclosure by Edward Snowden has shown that the intelligence-sharing activities between the First World allies of the Cold War are rapidly shifting into the digital realm of the Internet.

==History==

=== Origins (1940s–1950s) ===

The agreement originated from a ten-page 1943 British–US Communication Intelligence Agreement, BRUSA. The UKUSA Agreement connected the signal intercept networks of the UK Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) and the US National Security Agency (NSA) at the beginning of the Cold War. The document was signed on 5 March 1946 by Colonel Patrick Marr-Johnson for the UK&#x27;s London Signals Intelligence Board and Lieutenant General Hoyt Vandenberg for the US State–Army–Navy Communication Intelligence Board. Although the original agreement states that the exchange would not be &quot;prejudicial to national interests&quot;, the United States often blocked information sharing from Commonwealth countries. The full text of the agreement was released to the public on 25 June 2010.

The &quot;Five Eyes&quot; term has its origins as a shorthand for a &quot;AUS/CAN/NZ/UK/US EYES ONLY&quot; classification level.

=== Onset of the Cold War (1950s–1960s) ===
Under the agreement, the GCHQ and the NSA shared intelligence on the Soviet Union, the People&#x27;s Republic of China, and several Eastern Bloc countries (known as Exotics). The network was expanded in the 1960s into the Echelon collection and analysis network.

The treaty was extended to include Canada (1948), Australia (1956) and New Zealand (1956). In 1955, the agreement was updated to designate Canada, Australia and New Zealand as &quot;UKUSA-collaborating Commonwealth countries&quot;. Other countries that joined as &quot;third parties&quot; were Norway (1952), Denmark (1954) and West Germany (1955).

=== Investigations (1970–90s) ===

In the aftermath of the 1973 Murphy raids on the headquarters of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO), the existence of the UKUSA Agreement was revealed to Australia&#x27;s Prime Minister Gough Whitlam. After learning about the agreement, Whitlam discovered that Pine Gap, a secret surveillance station close to Alice Springs, Northern Territory, had been operated by the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).

At the height of the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis, the use and control of Pine Gap by the CIA was strongly opposed by Whitlam, who fired the chief of the ASIO before being dismissed as prime minister.

The existence of several intelligence agencies of the Five Eyes was not revealed until the following years:
; 1974: In Canada, an investigative television report on CBC News&#x27;s newsmagazine program &quot;The Fifth Estate&quot; revealed the existence of the Communications Security Establishment Canada (CSEC).
; 1975: In the United States, the Church Committee of the Senate revealed the existence of the National Security Agency (NSA).
; 1976: In Britain, an investigative article in &quot;Time Out&quot; magazine revealed the existence of the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ).
; 1977: In Australia, the Hope Commission revealed the existence of Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS) and the Defence Signals Directorate (DSD).
;1980: In New Zealand, the existence of the Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB) was officially disclosed on a &quot;limited basis&quot;.

In 1999, the Australian government acknowledged that it &quot;does co-operate with counterpart signals intelligence organisations overseas under the UKUSA relationship.&quot;

The existence of the UKUSA Agreement, however, was not publicly revealed until 2005. The contents of the agreement were officially disclosed to the public on 25 June 2010. Four days later, the agreement was described by &quot;Time&quot; magazine as one of the &quot;most important documents in the history of the Cold War.&quot;

=== Recent media leaks ===

In July 2013, as part of the 2013 Edward Snowden revelations, it emerged that the NSA is paying GCHQ for its services, with at least £100 million of payments made between 2010 and 2013.

On 11 September 2013, &quot;The Guardian&quot; released a leaked document provided by Edward Snowden which reveals a similar agreement between the NSA and Israel&#x27;s Unit 8200.

According to &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, Australia operates clandestine surveillance facilities at its embassies &quot;without the knowledge of most Australian diplomats&quot;. These facilities are part of an international espionage program known as STATEROOM.

== Security and intelligence agencies ==
Although the UKUSA alliance is often associated with the ECHELON system, processed intelligence is reliant on multiple sources of information and the intelligence shared is not restricted to signals intelligence. The following table provides an overview of the government agencies involved and their respective responsibilities within the &quot;Five Eyes&quot; community:

== Global coverage ==
Although precise assignments are classified, it is generally known that each member of the UKUSA alliance takes lead responsibility for intelligence collection and analysis in different parts of the globe.

=== Five Eyes ===

The &quot;Five Eyes&quot; (often abbreviated as &quot;FVEY&quot;) are an intelligence alliance comprising Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States. These countries are bound by the multilateral UKUSA Agreement, a treaty for joint cooperation in signals intelligence.

====Australia====
Australia monitors South Asia and East Asia.

====Canada====
Canada&#x27;s geographical proximity to the Soviet Union provided considerable eavesdropping advantages during the Cold War. Canada continues to monitor the Russian and Chinese interior while managing intelligence assets in Latin America.

====New Zealand====
In addition to Southeast Asia, New Zealand is responsible for the western Pacific and maintains listening posts in the South Island at Waihopai Valley just south-west of Blenheim, and on the North Island at Tangimoana.

====United Kingdom====
Europe, European Russia, Middle East, and Hong Kong.

====United States====
The US is focused on the Middle East, Russia, and China, in addition to the Caribbean and Africa.

=== 9 Eyes, 14 Eyes, and other &quot;third parties&quot; ===

The &quot;Five Eyes&quot; community is part of an extensive alliance of Western countries sharing signals intelligence with each other. These allied countries include NATO members, other European countries such as Sweden, and allies in the Pacific, in particular Singapore and South Korea.

In the 1950s several Nordic countries joined the community as &quot;third party&quot; participants. They were soon followed by Denmark (1954) and West Germany (1955).

According to Edward Snowden, the NSA has a &quot;massive body&quot; called the Foreign Affairs Directorate that is responsible for partnering with other Western allies such as Israel.

Unlike the &quot;second party&quot; members (that is, the Five Eyes themselves), &quot;third party&quot; partners are not automatically exempt from intelligence targeting. According to an internal NSA document leaked by Snowden, &quot;We (the NSA) can, and often do, target the signals of most 3rd party foreign partners.&quot;

The Five Eyes are cooperating with various 3rd Party countries in at least two groups:
* The &quot;Nine Eyes&quot;, consisting of the Five Eyes plus Denmark, France, the Netherlands, and Norway.
* The &quot;Fourteen Eyes&quot;, consisting of the same countries as the Nine Eyes plus Germany, Belgium, Italy, Spain, and Sweden. The actual name of this group is SIGINT Seniors Europe (SSEUR) and its purpose is coordinating the exchange of military signals intelligence among its members.

Germany is reportedly interested in moving closer to the inner circle: an internal GCHQ document from 2009 said that the &quot;Germans were a little grumpy at not being invited to join the 9-Eyes group.&quot; Germany may even wish to join Five Eyes. Referring to Five Eyes, former French President François Hollande has said that his country is &quot;not within that framework and we don&#x27;t intend to join.&quot; According to a former top US official, &quot;Germany joining would be a possibility, but not France – France itself spies on the US far too aggressively for that.&quot;

==Controversy==
During the 2013 NSA leaks Internet spying scandal, the surveillance agencies of the &quot;Five Eyes&quot; have been accused of intentionally spying on one another&#x27;s citizens and willingly sharing the collected information with each other, allegedly circumventing laws preventing each agency from spying on its own citizens.

The 2013 NSA leaks are not entirely new, but rather, they are a confirmation of earlier disclosures about the UK-US espionage alliance. For example, the British newspaper &quot;The Independent&quot; reported back in 1996 that the US National Security Agency &quot;taps UK phones&quot; at the request of the British intelligence agency MI5, thus allowing British agents to evade restrictive limitations on domestic telephone tapping.

The mutual surveillance and sharing of information between allies of the UK and US resurfaced again during the 2013 mass surveillance disclosures. As described by the news magazine &quot;Der Spiegel&quot;, this was done to circumvent domestic surveillance regulations:

Britain&#x27;s GCHQ intelligence agency can spy on anyone but British nationals, the NSA can conduct surveillance on anyone but Americans, and Germany&#x27;s BND (Bundesnachrichtendienst) foreign intelligence agency can spy on anyone but Germans. That&#x27;s how a matrix is created of boundless surveillance in which each partner aids in a division of roles.

They exchanged information. And they worked together extensively. That applies to the British and the Americans, but also to the BND, which assists the NSA in its Internet surveillance.

In 2013, Canadian federal judge Richard Mosley strongly rebuked the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) for outsourcing its surveillance of Canadians to overseas partner agencies. A 51-page ruling says that the CSIS and other Canadian federal agencies are illegally enlisting US and British allies in global surveillance dragnets, while keeping domestic federal courts in the dark.

<text>Colonel John Rouse Merriott Chard (21 December 1847 – 1 November 1897) was a British Army officer who received the Victoria Cross, the highest military decoration for valour &quot;in the face of the enemy&quot; that can be awarded to members of the British armed forces. He earned the decoration for his role in the defence of Rorke&#x27;s Drift in January 1879 where he assumed command of the outpost and a small garrison of 139 soldiers and successfully repulsed an assault by some 3,000 to 4,000 Zulu warriors. The battle was recreated in the film &quot;Zulu&quot; (1964), in which Chard was portrayed by Stanley Baker.

Born near Plymouth, Chard attended the Royal Military Academy in Woolwich and was commissioned into the Royal Engineers in July 1868. He was involved with the construction of fortifications in the Bermuda Garrison (three years) and at Malta (two years) before he was deployed to southern Africa at the start of the Anglo-Zulu War. 

At the end of the war, he returned to a hero&#x27;s welcome in the UK and was invited to an audience with Queen Victoria. After a series of overseas postings, he took up his final position in Perth, Scotland. He retired from the army as a colonel in 1897 after he was diagnosed with terminal cancer. He died at his brother&#x27;s home in Somerset later that year.

==Early life==
Chard was born at Boxhill near Plymouth on 21 December 1847 to William Wheaton Chard and his wife Jane Brimacombe. He had two brothers and four sisters. His elder brother William Wheaton Chard served with the Royal Fusiliers, rising to the rank of colonel, and his younger brother Charles Edward Chard became rector of a parish church in Hatch Beauchamp, Somerset. He was educated at Cheltenham Grammar School and Plymouth New Grammar School. After a period of private tuition, he enrolled at the Royal Military Academy in Woolwich.

On 14 July 1868, Chard received a commission as a lieutenant in the Royal Engineers and continued his training at Chatham for the next two years. He was posted to Bermuda, along with Lieutenant HP Knacker, in 1870 to construct fortifications at the Naval Dockyard near Hamilton. He returned to England four years later for his father&#x27;s funeral. 

He was assigned to Malta to assist with the improvement of the island&#x27;s sea defences. He returned to England in 1876, where he was based at Aldershot and Chatham, and was assigned to the 5th Company Royal Engineers.

==Rorke&#x27;s Drift==

On 2 December 1878, the 5th Company Royal Engineers were sent to the Colony of Natal in response to a request from Lord Chelmsford, commander of the British forces in southern Africa, for an additional unit of engineers to assist with preparations for the invasion of the Zulu Kingdom. After their arrival on 5 January, Chard was dispatched with a small group of sappers to repair and maintain the punts at one of the few crossings of the Buffalo River, which ran along the border of Natal and the Zulu Kingdom. 

A short distance downstream was Rorke&#x27;s Drift, an isolated mission station used as a staging post for the British invasion force. It consisted of two thatched bungalows about apart—the western building was used as a hospital, and the eastern building had been converted into a storehouse. Garrisoned at the Drift were Chelmsford&#x27;s quartermaster general, Major Henry Spalding, a company of the 2nd Battalion 24th Regiment of Foot commanded by Lieutenant Gonville Bromhead, and a large company of the 3rd Natal Native Contingent (NNC).

Chard&#x27;s group arrived on 19 January and set up camp near the crossing. On the morning of 22 January, he received an order that his sappers were required at Isandlwana to the east, where Chelmsford had set up an advanced camp for his main invasion column, which had marched into Zulu territory two weeks before. However, when he arrived, Chard was informed that only his men were required and that he should return to Rorke&#x27;s Drift. While at Isandlwana, Chard had witnessed a Zulu army approaching the camp in the distance and upon his return to the Drift at about 1 pm, he informed Spalding of the situation. 

Spalding decided to depart the Drift to hurry British reinforcements en route from Helpmekaar, but before he left, he checked a copy of the Army List, which confirmed that Chard was senior to Bromhead. Therefore, Chard, a &quot;notoriously relaxed&quot; man with no combat experience, was unexpectedly placed in command of the small garrison.
Unconcerned by the presence of the Zulus nearby, Chard returned to his tent by the river crossing. He was soon after disturbed by two NNC officers on horseback who informed him that the camp at Isandlwana had been overwhelmed and annihilated by the Zulus.

Returning to the station, Chard found Bromhead and Assistant Commissary James Dalton had already instructed the troops to use mealie bags to construct a defensive perimeter between the storehouse and hospital. Chard consented and by 4 pm the hastily constructed perimeter was complete. Soon afterwards, the Zulu &quot;impi&quot;, which contained some 3,000–4,000 men, was sighted advancing on their position. This caused the NNC troops to panic and desert the station, reducing the number of defenders from around 350 to approximately 140 (including 30 sick and wounded). Chard immediately ordered an additional barricade of biscuit boxes to be built across the inner perimeter to provide a smaller fall-back area should the Zulus overwhelm a part of the thinly manned perimeter.

The first waves of Zulu assault were repulsed by British volley fire, but the attackers pushed on relentlessly, particularly along a vulnerable section of the British perimeter by the hospital, which became the centre of fierce hand-to-hand combat. With British casualties mounting, Chard ordered his troops to withdraw behind the biscuit boxes, which left the western half of the station in Zulu hands, including the hospital, which was subsequently set alight by the attackers. Once inside, Chard ordered the construction of a redoubt made from a tall pyramid of mealie bags to provide shelter to the wounded and form the last line of defence. The Zulus continued to attack in intermittent waves during the night, but they were illuminated by the burning thatch, which enabled the defenders to spot their advances. By 5 am, the exhausted Zulus had abandoned the attack. After British reinforcements arrived later that morning, Chard counted 351 dead Zulus scattered around the perimeter. The British suffered 17 killed and 10 wounded.

==Victoria Cross, later career and death==
Chard remained at Rorke&#x27;s Drift for several weeks after the battle and assisted with the construction of a new stone perimeter wall. However, conditions at the camp were poor; Chard became ill with fever and was taken to Ladysmith for treatment. Once recovered he was attached to Colonel Evelyn Wood&#x27;s column for the second invasion of the Zulu kingdom. Meanwhile, Chard&#x27;s report of the battle had been dispatched to England and received with enthusiasm by the British press and public. 

The War Office subsequently promoted Chard to captain and brevet major and awarded him and 10 other defenders of the station with Victoria Crosses, the highest decoration for valour that could be awarded to British troops. The citation for the award was published in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; on 2 May 1879:


Some of Chard and Bromhead&#x27;s superiors, however, were resentful of the adulation bestowed on the pair. Wood took a particular dislike to his new subordinate. Unimpressed with his temperament and sceptical of his role in the battle, he denounced Chard as a &quot;useless officer&quot; and &quot;a dull, heavy man, scarcely able to do his regular work&quot;. Lieutenant-General Sir Garnet Wolseley, who thought the desperate defence of the Rorke&#x27;s Drift was merely a case of &quot;rats [fighting] for their lives which they could not otherwise save&quot;, presented Chard with his VC on 16 July. Likely influenced by Wood, he subsequently said of Chard that a &quot;more uninteresting or more stupid-looking fellow I never saw&quot;.

Chard was present in the British square during the decisive victory at the Battle of Ulundi and remained in Africa until the end of the war. 

His arrival back in Portsmouth in October 1879 was greeted with celebration. In addition to a series of presentations and dinners bestowed in his honour, he attended Balmoral Castle to dine with Queen Victoria, who was impressed by his modest and unassuming demeanour. 

Chard returned to duty at Devonport in January 1880 and was posted to Cyprus in December 1881. His brevet majority was substantiated on 17 July 1886 and he returned to England in March 1887 to take up a position in Preston. He was ordered to Singapore in December 1892 and received a promotion to lieutenant colonel. He returned to England in 1896 and took up his final post as Commanding Royal Engineer at Perth, Scotland, and was promoted to colonel on 8 January 1897.

While stationed in Perth, Chard—a lifelong pipe smoker—was diagnosed with cancer of the tongue. He underwent two operations: the second—which took place in March 1897—resulted in the removal of his tongue but despite this it was reported that he could still converse clearly. However, by August it was discovered the cancer was terminal and Chard retired to his brother Charles&#x27; rectory at Hatch Beauchamp, Somerset. 

After two weeks of &quot;terrible suffering&quot;, Chard died on 1 November 1897. He was unmarried. He was buried in the churchyard by the south east transept of The Church of St John the Baptist in Hatch Beauchamp, Somerset.

==Legacy==

Among the numerous messages of sympathy and floral tributes was a wreath of laurel leaves sent by the Queen, who had remained in contact with Chard and frequently enquired about his health. The wreath bore the handwritten inscription &quot;A mark of admiration and regard for a brave soldier from his sovereign&quot;. In 1899 a stained glass memorial window dedicated to Chard was installed in the south wall of the church&#x27;s chancel. Another memorial donated by the Royal Engineers was placed in Rochester Cathedral. A display at the Royal Engineers Museum in Gillingham, Kent, commemorates Chard&#x27;s leadership at Rorke&#x27;s Drift and includes the Webley Revolver he used in the battle.

Welsh actor Stanley Baker portrayed Chard in the 1964 film &quot;Zulu&quot;, which depicted the defence of Rorke&#x27;s Drift. Baker acquired Chard&#x27;s campaign medal and a &quot;cast copy&quot; of his Victoria Cross at an auction in 1972; they were sold by his family after his death in 1976. However, in 1996 the Victoria Cross was discovered to be the original rather than a copy after its metallic characteristics were compared with the bronze ingot from which all Victoria Crosses are cast. The medal was subsequently acquired by Lord Ashcroft, owner of the world&#x27;s largest collection of VCs, and is on display at the Imperial War Museum, London.

Chard was commemorated by the South African military with the John Chard Decoration and the John Chard Medal, which were awarded to members of the Citizen Force. Instituted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1952, the Medal and the Decoration were awarded for 12 years and 20 years service, respectively, until 2003, when they were superseded by the Medalje vir Troue Diens and the Emblem for Reserve Force Service.

<text>The Loktantrik Samajwadi Party is a minor political party in India. It was founded on 9 January 1994 in Patna by three senior MPs from the Janata Dal Party. These were Ram Sundar Das, Rasheed Masood, and Upendra Nath Verma.

== Electoral performance ==
The party contested 14 seats in the 1998 Lok Sabha (national parliament) elections. They also stood in the 1999, 2004, 2009, and 2014 elections, steadily dropping the number of seats contested. By 2014 they were contesting only two seats. They lost their deposits in every constituency contested in every election over that period.

The party won a seat in the 2008 state assembly election in Rajasthan.

<text>Breach of promise is a common-law tort, abolished in many jurisdictions. It was also called breach of contract to marry, and the remedy awarded was known as heart balm.

From at least the Middle Ages to the early 20th century, many jurisdictions regarded a man&#x27;s promise of engagement to marry a woman as a legally binding contract. If the man subsequently changed his mind, he would be said to be in &quot;breach&quot; of this promise and could be subject to litigation for damages.

The converse of that was seldom true. The concept that &quot;it&#x27;s a woman&#x27;s prerogative to change her mind&quot; had at least some basis in law (though a woman might pay a high social price for exercising this privilege). Unless a dowry of money or property had changed hands, or the woman could be shown to have become engaged to a man only to enable her use of his money, a man could rarely recover in a &quot;breach of promise&quot; suit against a woman if he was even allowed to file one.

Changing social attitudes toward morals have led to a decline in the number of legal actions in response to &quot;&quot;. Most jurisdictions, at least in the English-speaking common-law world, have become increasingly reluctant to intervene in cases of personal relationships not involving the welfare of children or actual violence. Many of them have repealed all laws regarding such eventualities, and in others, the statute allowing such an action may technically remain on the books, but the action has become very rare and unlikely to be pursued with any probability of success. Arising in its stead are judicial opinions and/or statutes permitting a breach-of-contract action for wedding expenses incurred when the nuptials are called off or for loss of employment, moving and living expenses incurred by one party as a result of an engagement, which is later broken.

==Cause of action==
A breach of promise suit required a legally valid marriage engagement. Under Nevada law, this need not be in writing (as a prenuptial agreement is required to be), but may have been made orally by both parties. All that is required is that each have promised the other to marry the other at some future time (no date certain is required). Generally, promises made by—but not to—people who had not reached the age of majority could be broken at any time, without penalty, as could the promise made by a married person (e.g., conditional upon the death of the current spouse), so long as the other party knew that the person was married at the time. Similarly, an engagement between people who were not legally permitted to marry (e.g., because of consanguinity laws) was invalid.

Valid engagements could be broken without penalty by either party upon discovery of significant and material facts, such as previously unknown financial state (if completely concealed, rather than partially revealed; the Shell case in Georgia in 2008 permitted a jury award to the woman of $150,000 although the man breaking the engagement stated that he did so after paying $30,000 of her debts when he discovered she still owed more), bad character, fraud, too-close blood relations, or the absolute physical or mental incapacity of the betrothed. In South Africa, engagements could be dissolved by mutual agreement. Impotence, sterility, criminality, and alcoholism also formed valid reasons to end an engagement. Additionally, the person refusing to marry was unable to sue for breach of promise.

Some of the original theory behind this tort was based on the idea that a woman would be more likely to give up her virginity to a man if she had his promise to marry her. If he seduced her and subsequently refused marriage, her lack of virginity would make her future search for a suitable husband more difficult or even impossible.

However, in the 18th and 19th centuries, the main factors were compensation for the denial of the woman&#x27;s expectations of becoming &quot;established&quot; in a household (supported by her husband&#x27;s wealth) and possible damage to her social reputation, since there were a number of ways that the reputation of a young never-married woman of the genteel classes could be damaged by a broken engagement, or an apparent period of intimacy which did not end in a publicly announced engagement, even if few people seriously thought that she had lost her virginity. She might be viewed as having broken the code of maidenly modesty of the period by imprudently offering up her affections without having had a firm assurance of future marriage.

During the early 20th century, social standards changed so that a woman who had pre-marital sex was no longer considered to be &quot;ruined&quot;. During that time, half of American women lost their virginity during their marriage engagements. Compensation was based on emotional distress and the woman&#x27;s reduced opportunity for a future marriage. Damages were greatly increased if the couple had engaged in pre-marital sexual intercourse.

==Laws in different countries==
=== England and Wales ===
In England and Wales until 1970 a woman whose fiancé broke off their engagement could sue him for breach of promise, whilst a woman was permitted to change her mind without penalty. The last prominent case was in 1969, when Eva Haraldsted sued George Best, a prominent footballer, for breach of promise. England and Wales undertook legal reforms in 1970 that generally made property disputes related to engagements to be handled like property disputes between married couples.

On 1 January 1971 the tort was abolished in England and Wales by section 1 of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1970.

===Asia===
In Hong Kong, similar to the situation in England and Wales, engagements to marry are not enforceable at law by legislation, damages for distress caused and reliance on the breach of promise are claimable, if the plaintiff suffers sufficiently serious consequences in light of the specific circumstances, for instance in &quot;Cheung Suk Man v So Shek Keung&quot; [1965] HKLR 485.

In 2019, the Supreme Court of India ruled that sex on false promise of marriage constitutes rape.

=== North America ===
In Canada, the common law action has been abolished in some provinces by legislation. For example, in Saskatchewan, the action for breach of promise was formally abolished by legislation in 2010.

The first known lawsuit for breach of promise in colonial America and the first in which the defendant was a woman was &quot;Cecily Jordan v. Greville Pooley&quot;. This case was tried in the chambers of the Virginia Company and never went to a civil court, as the plaintiff withdrew his complaint. The first successful case was &quot;Stretch v Parker&quot; in 1639.

In 1915, Louis A. Merrilat, an American football end and military officer active in the early 20th century, was sued by Helen Van Ness for breach of promise after breaking off an engagement. Merrilat hired the noted Chicago attorney Clarence Darrow to defend him against the charges, which were eventually dismissed.

In the United States, most states repealed breach-of-promise laws or limited them, beginning in 1935. Partly as a result, expensive diamond engagement rings, previously uncommon, began to become commonplace, and formed a sort of financial security for the woman.

South Carolina is one of the states that still recognizes a breach of promise action: &quot;Campbell v Robinson&quot;, 398 S.C. 12, 726 S.E. 2d 221 (Ct. App. 2012). About one-half of U.S. states still permit such lawsuits, according to the National Paralegal College. Examples of such suits include a jury award of $150,000 in the 2008 Shell case in Georgia, and $130,000 in a North Carolina jury trial December 17, 2010, in the case of &quot;Dellinger v. Barnes&quot; (No. 08 CVS 1006). Laws vary by state. In Illinois, for example, documented wedding expenses can be recovered, but damages for emotional distress are prohibited, and notice of an intent to sue must be provided within three months of the engagement being dissolved.

==Determining damages==
Damages were generally permitted for expenses incurred on the expectation of a marriage, such as property transferred or wedding expenses. In some jurisdictions, emotional distress, loss of social standing, and loss of virginity were also possible sources of damages.

Some countries also allowed the woman to sue for loss of future income, that is, for money that she would have had, if her very wealthy fiancé had not broken off the engagement. In 20th-century reforms, this was generally abolished over fears of gold digging.

One challenge in settling disputes for breach of promise was determining whether a gift made during the engagement was an absolute gift—one given permanently, with no strings attached—or a conditional gift, given in the expectation of the marriage taking place. If an engagement gift was given on a holiday, such as Valentine&#x27;s Day or Christmas, the gift could be considered to be non-contingent, and given partially for reasons other than marriage, and thus does not have to be returned. Christmas presents are generally taken to be absolute gifts, and thus cannot be recovered if the engagement dissolves, but engagement rings are generally taken to be conditional gifts, at least under most circumstances, which means that they must be returned if the recipient no longer chooses to go through with the marriage. Whether an engagement ring must be returned if the giver breaks off the engagement varies.

==Similar actions in law==

Criminal conversation was a similar tort, arising from adultery, in which a married person could sue the person with whom his or her spouse had engaged in adultery. Alienation of affections was another similar tort against a third party who encouraged the adultery, or who was otherwise responsible for the breakdown of the marriage.

===Non-common-law jurisdictions===
France nominally did not permit breach of promise actions, holding that marriage must involve free consent from both parties, and if the engagement is legally binding, then free consent is not possible. However, any party may sue for losses as a result of improper behavior by an engaged person.

In Scots law before 1812, damages were limited only to actual financial losses.

After World War II, German, Spanish, and Italian law allowed for the recovery of actual damages incurred as a result of a failed engagement.

==In popular culture==

===Literature===
The social damage from receiving attention from a man is discussed in a passage from the 1801 novel &quot;Belinda&quot; by Maria Edgeworth, where an older woman is urging Miss Belinda Portman to give a suitor more time to attach her affections, though Belinda is worried that even by just passively accepting his attentions for a certain time, she might find herself &quot;entangled, so as not to be able to retract&quot;, even &quot;if it should not be in my power to love him at last&quot;:

Breach-of-promise actions were part of the standard stock-in-trade of comic writers of the 19th century (such as Charles Dickens in &quot;Pickwick Papers&quot;, or Gilbert and Sullivan in &quot;Trial by Jury&quot;) and in the 20th century as a frequent plot device by P. G. Wodehouse, but most middle- and upper-class families were reluctant to use them except in rather extreme circumstances (such as when a daughter became pregnant by a man who then refused to marry her), since they led to wide publicity being given to a scrutiny of personal concerns, something which was strongly repugnant to the family feeling of the period (especially where young women were concerned).

===Media===
&quot;Trial by Jury&quot; is an 1875 curtain-raiser and comic opera that enacts a satirical trial for breach of promise. The successful musical launched the careers of librettist W.S. Gilbert and composer Arthur Sullivan.

In the 1935 film &quot;We&#x27;re in the Money&quot;, Joan Blondell and Glenda Farrell play two process servers trying to serve a rich playboy, Ross Alexander, with a breach of promise suit.

At the start of the 1946 film &quot;Easy to Wed&quot;, newspaperman Warren Haggerty (Keenan Wynn) has abandoned his planned wedding to Gladys Benson (Lucille Ball) for the umpteenth time when his paper is faced with a libel suit. When Benson storms in to confront him, she threatens him with a breach of promise suit, to which Haggerty replies &quot;Breach of promise suits have been outlawed!&quot;

The episode &quot;A Woman&#x27;s Privilege&quot; of the featurette series &quot;The Scales of Justice&quot; recounts the unusual case of a man who sues a woman for breach of promise following a cruise ship romance engagement.

In the film &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; (1964), Paul McCartney&#x27;s (fictional) grandfather is pursued by young women who want to sue him for breach of promise.

In the 1998 series &quot;Berkeley Square&quot;, Captain Mason is forbidden from marrying Isobelle by her chaperone Aunt Effie due to his outstanding bills and social indiscretion. He threatens to sue for breach of promise, forcing Effie to accept their engagement to avoid family scandal.

In season 8 of the TV show &quot;Frasier&quot;, Donny files a suit against Daphne for running away with Niles on the day of their wedding.

<doc id="1032007" wikidata="Q507776" url="?curid=1032007" title="Pig-Pen">
<text>Pig-Pen is a fictional character in the comic strip &quot;Peanuts&quot; by Charles M. Schulz, syndicated in daily and Sunday newspapers in numerous countries all over the world. While amiable, he is a young boy who is, except on rare occasions, extremely dirty and attracts a permanent cloud of dust.

==History==
&quot;Pig-Pen&quot; is a nickname. In a 2000 Gallup Poll, Pig-Pen was found to be the fifth most popular &quot;Peanuts&quot; character. In strips up through 1980, Schulz spelled the character&#x27;s name &quot;Pig-Pen&quot;, with a hyphen; since 1981, the name has been spelled &quot;Pigpen&quot;. He is also mocked by other characters because of his dirtiness.

Pig-Pen is known for his perpetually filthy overalls and the cloud of dirt and dust that surrounds him everywhere he goes. When he takes a deep breath (to sing, for example), the dust rises briefly around him. He has proudly referred to his personal cloud as &quot;the dust of ancient civilizations&quot;. He cannot seem to rid himself of the dust for more than the very briefest of periods — indeed, in spite of his best efforts, it appears that he &quot;cannot&quot; stay clean. He is referred to in an early strip as the only person who can get dirty while walking in a snowstorm. Nevertheless, on rare occasions he has briefly appeared clean, and hence unrecognizable. Once this was in order to impress Violet, of whom he was a bit fond. On another occasion (September 6, 1954), he managed to keep one side of his body clean and presented this clean side to Patty, causing her to believe that he was completely clean. In &quot;The Peanuts Movie&quot; (2015), Patty seems to have a crush on Pig-Pen and he seems to return these feelings.

Once, after bathing and dressing in clean clothes, Pig-Pen stepped outside his house and instantaneously became dirty and disheveled, whereupon he declared to Charlie Brown, &quot;You know what I am? I&#x27;m a dust magnet!&quot; On another occasion, Pig-Pen decided it was important to have clean hands, but after failing to wash them, realized that he had &quot;reached a point of no return.&quot;

One notable exception is an earlier strip where he gets caught in a brief but heavy rainfall, and while trying to seek shelter, the storm ends, revealing him to be clean. He responds with disdain, stating that, &quot;In one minute the rain has washed away what took me all day to accomplish&quot;.

Though Pig-Pen is proud of his uncleanliness, Charlie Brown is the only other &quot;Peanuts&quot; character to unconditionally accept Pig-Pen for who he is, even defending his uncleanliness in one strip (which was re-used in &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot; and &quot;Peanuts&quot;):

Charles Schulz admitted that he came to regret Pig-Pen&#x27;s popularity, given the character&#x27;s essentially one-joke nature; he utilized the character very rarely in the later years of the strip&#x27;s run; Pig-Pen was featured in just over 100 of the 17,897 &quot;Peanuts&quot; comic strips that Schulz created (though still appearing commonly in the TV specials and movies of the franchise).
Like most of Schulz&#x27;s characters, Pig-Pen has (both with and without lines) appeared in many of the animated &quot;Peanuts&quot; television specials beginning in the 1960s, as well as all five movies. One time, his clean self was shown in a miniseries titled &quot;This Is America, Charlie Brown&quot;, where he is an astronaut aboard a futuristic space station, demonstrating how personal hygiene would apply in zero gravity. True to form, the clean Pig-Pen is immediately dirtied again when dirt is attracted to him magnetically. In the 1990s, he appeared (in an animated overlay against a live-action backdrop) in a series of television commercials for Regina vacuum cleaners where all the dirt is sucked off his body and filthy trousers by one of the company&#x27;s products, arguably one of the few times where Pig-Pen remains clean. In 2015, Pig-Pen appeared in a commercial for All laundry detergent for a tie-in with &quot;The Peanuts Movie&quot;. In the commercial, Snoopy, dressed as a magician, puts a cloth over Pig-Pen and instantly makes him clean, causing Snoopy to get dirty. This is also one of the few times where he remains clean.

Geoffrey Ornstein first voiced Pig-Pen in the 1965 movie &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot;. Although he also later played the role in &quot;Charlie Brown&#x27;s All Stars!&quot;, other various actors have voiced him ever since.

He last appeared in the &quot;Peanuts&quot; comic strip on September 8, 1999. That strip was very uncharacteristic of him in that it showed him embarrassed to the point of shame in his dirtiness, with none of the pride or sense of destiny that he expressed in earlier strips.

Pig-Pen is evidently a talented musician, as he is shown playing the double bass, notably in &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot;, and later in the 1971 special &quot;Play It Again, Charlie Brown&quot; he easily takes to a set of drums brought out by Snoopy. 

He plays third base on Charlie Brown&#x27;s baseball team, and is likely the best player; in a March 1997 strip, when asked by Lucy why he doesn&#x27;t look as neat as the others, he answers that his previous year&#x27;s batting average was .712, adding &quot;Neatness doesn&#x27;t bat .712&quot;.

<text>Darwin was a suggested ESA Cornerstone mission which would have involved a constellation of four to nine spacecraft designed to directly detect Earth-like planets orbiting nearby stars and search for evidence of life on these planets. The most recent design envisaged three free-flying space telescopes, each three to four metres in diameter, flying in formation as an astronomical interferometer. These telescopes were to redirect light from distant stars and planets to a fourth spacecraft, which would have contained the beam combiner, spectrometers, and cameras for the interferometer array, and which would have also acted as a communications hub. There was also an earlier design, called the &quot;Robin Laurance configuration,&quot; which included six 1.5 metre telescopes, a beam combiner spacecraft, and a separate power and communications spacecraft.

The study of this proposed mission ended in 2007 with no further activities planned. To produce an image, the telescopes would have had to operate in formation with distances between the telescopes controlled to within a few micrometres, and the distance between the telescopes and receiver controlled to within about one nanometre. Several more detailed studies would have been needed to determine whether technology capable of such precision is actually feasible.

==Concept==
The space telescopes were to observe in the infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum. As well as studying extrasolar planets, the telescopes would probably have been useful for general purpose imaging, producing very high resolution (i.e. milliarcsecond) infrared images, allowing detailed study of a variety of astrophysical processes.

The infrared region was chosen because in the visible spectrum an Earth-like planet is outshone by its star by a factor of a billion. However, in the infrared, the difference is less by a few orders of magnitude. According to a 2000 ESA bulletin, all spacecraft components in the optical path would have to be passively cooled to 40 kelvins to allow infrared observations to take place.

The planet search would have used a nulling interferometer configuration. In this system, phase shifts would be introduced into the three beams, so that light from the central star would suffer destructive interference and cancel itself out. However, light from any orbiting planets would not cancel out, as the planets are offset slightly from the star&#x27;s position. This would allow planets to be detected, despite the much brighter signal from the star.

For planet detection, the telescopes would operate in an imaging mode. The detection of an Earth-like planet would require about 10 hours of observation in total, spread out over several months. A 2002 design which would have used 1.5 metre mirrors was expected to take about 100 hours to get a spectrum of a possibly Earth-like planet.

Were the Darwin spacecraft to detect a suitable planet, a more detailed study of its atmosphere would have been made by taking an infrared spectrum of the planet. By analyzing this spectrum, the chemistry of the atmosphere could be determined, and this could provide evidence for life on the planet. The presence of oxygen and water vapour in the atmosphere could be evidence for life. Oxygen is very reactive so if large amounts of oxygen exist in a planet&#x27;s atmosphere some process such as photosynthesis must be continuously producing it.

The presence of oxygen alone, however, is not conclusive evidence for life. Jupiter&#x27;s moon Europa, for example, has a tenuous oxygen atmosphere thought to be produced by radiolysis of water molecules. Numerical simulations have shown that under proper conditions it is possible to build up an oxygen atmosphere via photolysis of carbon dioxide. Photolysis of water vapor and carbon dioxide produces hydroxyl ions and atomic oxygen, respectively, and these in turn produce oxygen in small concentrations, with hydrogen escaping into space. When O2 is produced by H2O photolysis at high altitude, hydrogenous compounds like H+, OH− and H2O are produced which attack very efficiently O3 and prevent its accumulation. The only known way to have a significant amount of O3 in the atmosphere is that O2 be produced at low altitude, e.g. by biological photosynthesis, and that little H2O gets to high altitudes where UV is present. For terrestrial planets, the simultaneous presence of O3, H2O and CO2 in the atmosphere appears to be a reliable biosignature, and the Darwin spacecraft would have been capable of detecting these atmospheric components.

==Candidate planets==
Planet Gliese 581 d, discovered in 2007, was considered a good candidate for the Darwin project. It orbits within the theoretical habitable zone of its star, and scientists surmise that conditions on the planet might be conducive to supporting life.

==Similar initiatives==
The interferometric version of NASA&#x27;s Terrestrial Planet Finder mission is similar in concept to Darwin and also has very similar scientific aims. According to NASA&#x27;s 2007 budget documentation, released on February 6, 2006, the project was deferred indefinitely, and in June 2011 the project was reported as cancelled. Antoine Labeyrie has proposed a much larger space-based astronomical interferometer similar to Darwin, but with the individual telescopes positioned in a spherical arrangement and with an emphasis on interferometric imaging. This Hypertelescope project would be much more expensive and complex than the Darwin and TPF missions, involving many large free-flying spacecraft.

<text>Nancy Ling Perry (September 19, 1947 – May 17, 1974, born Nancy Ling) was also known as Nancy Devoto, Lynn Ledworth, and Fahizah while a founding member of the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA), a small leftist terrorist group based in northern California. Considered one of its chief theorists and activists, she died in a shootout with the Los Angeles Police Department at an SLA safehouse in that city.

==Background==
Nancy Ling was born in San Francisco in 1947 to an upper-middle-class family. She attended Montgomery High School in Santa Rosa, where she was a cheerleader. She also served as a Sunday school teacher at her church. In 1964, while in high school, she was a campaign worker for Barry Goldwater. While in high school, Ling was also involved in Job&#x27;s Daughters (Bethel #16) and served as their Honored Queen.

She began university at Whittier College. After a few semesters at Whittier, however, she transferred to the University of California, Berkeley. At Berkeley she majored in English.

Ling met Black jazz musician Gilbert Perry when he was working for a state employment office, and the couple were married December 26, 1967. Married for six years, they had a relationship described as a &quot;love-hate affair&quot;. It ended when Gilbert left Nancy, but she remained deeply interested in black culture.

Retaining her married name, Ling Perry worked as a topless blackjack dealer in San Francisco. During this period, she was deeply involved in using psychedelic drugs and amphetamines.

==Symbionese Liberation Army==

Perry became politically active and joined other students serving in a university-sponsored prisoner outreach program through the Black Cultural Association (BCA) at Vacaville Prison. The program was organized by Colston Westbrook, a professor at University of California, Berkeley. At Vacaville, Perry formed a relationship with black inmate Donald DeFreeze, who was active at the prison. He was given permission to see her in conjugal visits. This was unusual, as authorities generally authorized such visits only for married couples.

DeFreeze was transferred to Soledad Prison for good behavior. He escaped from there in March 1973 and made his way to Oakland, where he contacted Russ Little and some other white associates he had met through the BCA at Vacaville. Little put him in touch with Patricia Soltysik, and he started living at her apartment. They formed a sexual relationship and were co-founders of what became the Symbionese Liberation Army. Perry is also considered a co-founder.

Others in the small group were Thero Wheeler, a black convict who escaped from Vacaville in August 1973; Chicano Joe Remiro (classified as white by the &quot;New York Times&quot;), and Angela Atwood, another white woman. They were soon joined by a white married couple, Emily Harris and her husband William. All but DeFreeze, Wheeler and Remiro were white and mostly educated, from middle and upper-class families.

With Soltysik, Perry is considered to have been a chief theorist and driver of the SLA. She was the only one to identify publicly as SLA, and wrote a five-page letter to &quot;The San Francisco Chronicle&quot; in 1974 affirming this.

Initially Wheeler and Remiro, a veteran, began training the whites in the use of weapons. None had any experience with them. Wheeler was increasingly opposed to the radical plans for violence formed by SLA leaders. He believed it was the wrong direction, and withdrew in October 1973 with his heiress girlfriend Mary Alice Siem. After the two separated, he lived as a fugitive for two years before being apprehended.

The SLA first made headlines by claiming credit for the murder on November 6, 1973, of Marcus Foster, Superintendent of Oakland Public Schools. He was the first black superintendent of any major urban school system. This act outraged the black community, which had strongly admired him. In a public statement, the unknown group SLA claimed that the bullets used were tipped with the poison cyanide. This was confirmed by the city coroner and the police realized they had a new group to monitor.

Perry narrowly avoided arrest a few days later on November 11. A serial rapist appeared at the front door of her house and attempted to assault her. She stopped this and talked to police on the front lawn after they were alerted by neighbors. She managed to prevent the police from entering her house and finding the many SLA materials inside. The rapist was later apprehended.

In an effort to evade police attention after the attack on Foster and his deputy, Perry rented a house for the SLA under a false name in Concord, California, east of the Berkeley hills. Little and Remiro were stopped in that area in early January 1974 by police and exchanged shots with them. They were both arrested.

In an effort to destroy evidence linked to the SLA, Perry set the house on fire and fled. But the fire was discovered and put out, and police found numerous documents, illegal weapons, lists of target public figures, and other materials connected to the SLA. Little and Remiro were both charged and convicted of the murder of Foster and wounding of his deputy. They were sentenced to prison and assigned to San Quentin. Little&#x27;s conviction was overturned on appeal, but Remiro remained in prison in 2023, the only member of the SLA still incarcerated. Parole has been repeatedly denied.

During the next several months, the SLA undertook increasingly risky actions, including kidnapping heiress Patty Hearst in February. In April they conducted an armed robbery of a bank. By this time Hearst had publicly declared she had joined the SLA; she was filmed in videos at the bank brandishing an assault weapon.

In May 1974 Nancy Ling Perry, DeFreeze, Patricia Soltysik and two other founding members of the SLA had taken refuge at a safe house in south central Los Angeles, at 1466 East 54th Street. On May 17, 1974, the Los Angeles Police Department surrounded the house with a SWAT team and a shootout began. The house accidentally caught on fire. and the group hid in a crawlspace.

As the hideout burned, Perry and SLA member Camilla Hall exited the house. Police claimed that Perry was the first to come out. When police ordered her to freeze, Perry turned and began firing a revolver; police fatally shot her in response. Perry was shot twice; one shot hit her right lung, the other shot severed her spine. Camilla Hall emerged after Perry, and police said she was brandishing a pistol. She was fatally shot once in the forehead. Angela Atwood pulled Hall&#x27;s body back inside the house. Investigators working for Perry&#x27;s parents later claimed that Perry had left the house intending to surrender. DeFreeze died by self-inflicted gunshot in the house as the fire raged. Soltysik and Atwood also died in the house.

<doc id="1032031" wikidata="Q1412588" url="?curid=1032031" title="Scaled Composites Proteus">
<text>The Scaled Composites Model 281 Proteus is a tandem-wing high-altitude long-endurance aircraft designed by Burt Rutan to investigate the use of aircraft as high-altitude telecommunications relays. The Proteus is a multi-mission vehicle able to carry various payloads on a ventral pylon. The Proteus has an extremely efficient design and can orbit a point at over 19,800 m for more than 18 hours. It is currently owned by Northrop Grumman.

==Design and development==
Proteus has an all-composite airframe with graphite-epoxy sandwich construction. Its wingspan of is expandable to with removable wingtips installed. Proteus is an &quot;optionally piloted&quot; aircraft ordinarily flown by two pilots in a pressurized cabin. However, it also has the capability to perform its missions semi-autonomously or flown remotely from the ground. Under NASA&#x27;s Environmental Research Aircraft and Sensor Technology (ERAST) project, NASA&#x27;s Dryden Flight Research Center assisted Scaled Composites in developing a sophisticated station-keeping autopilot system and a satellite communications (SATCOM)-based uplink-downlink data system for Proteus&#x27; performance and payload data. The Proteus wing was adapted for use on the Model 318 White Knight carrier aircraft, which is the launch system for Rutan&#x27;s Tier One spacecraft and the DARPA X-37.

Flight testing of the Proteus began with its first flight on July 26, 1998, at the Mojave Airport and continued through the end of 1999. In June, Proteus was deployed internationally for the first time, debuting at the Paris Air Show. It was flown non-stop from Bangor, Maine to Paris. During the week-long show, it flew each day, demonstrating its capabilities as a telecommunications platform.

The Proteus is the current holder of a number of FAI world records for altitude (class: C1-e: landplanes 3,000–6,000 kg, Group: 3, turbojet), set in cooperation with NASA Dryden. The highest altitude achieved was in October 2000.

Proteus was included in the list of the &quot;100 Best of 1998 Design&quot;, by &quot;Time&quot; magazine, December 21, 1998.

==Operational history==

Due to the multimission nature of the aircraft, it has been involved in a number of significant research projects and missions. Scaled Composites, a wholly owned subsidiary of Northrop Grumman, actively markets the aircraft as a research platform, and has published a user&#x27;s guide for planning proposed missions.

===Angel Technologies HALO===
Proteus was originally conceived as a high-altitude, long operation (HALO) telecommunications platform. Proteus was to be the first of a series of aircraft built by Scaled Technology Works of Montrose, Colorado (a proposed spinoff of Scaled Composites which was later cancelled). The aircraft was intended to carry a antenna, which was flight tested in the autumn of 1999 and the summer of 2000, including the relay of a video conference while the aircraft orbited over Los Angeles. The project failed to move forward, however, and the subsequent series of aircraft were not built.

===ARTIS camera===
A small Airborne Real-Time Imaging System (ARTIS) camera, developed by HyperSpectral Sciences, Inc., under NASA&#x27;s ERAST project, was demonstrated during the summer of 1999 when it took visual and near-infrared photos from Proteus while it was flying high over the Experimental Aircraft Association&#x27;s AirVenture 99 Airshow at Oshkosh, Wisconsin. The images were displayed on a computer monitor at the show only moments after they were taken.

===NAST validation===
Proteus&#x27; first science mission was to carry the National Polar-Orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System Airborne Sounder Testbed – Interferometer (NAST-I) instrument in March 2000 during the Cloud-Intensive Operating Period over the Department of Energy Cloud and Radiation Testbed (CART) site. The flights, based out of Stilwell, Oklahoma, encompassed 30 flight hours over a week and a half, characterizing cloud properties and validating the instrument.

Then, in September and October 2000, during the Water-Vapor Intensive Operating Period, Proteus and NAST flew validation flights studying upper tropospheric water vapor and performing underflights of the Terra satellite.

===ARM-FIRE AFWEX project===
In November–December 2000, Proteus flew as part of the DOE&#x27;s Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program and their water vapor experiments. Flights were essentially the same as was flown for the NAST Water-Vapor Intensive Operating Period validation flights.

===NASA TRACE-P===
As part of the TRACE-P (Transport and Chemical Evolution over the Pacific) mission, Proteus once again carried the NAST pod during March 2001. The aircraft logged 126 flight hours, and was variously based out of Alaska, Hawaii and Japan, gathering data in coordination with ground, balloon and satellite sensor packages over the North Pole in March 2001.

===NASA CLAMS===
Proteus took part in the NASA Chesapeake Lighthouse &amp; Aircraft Measurements for Satellites (CLAMS) program in July and August 2001, flying out of NASA&#x27;s Wallops Flight Facility. The project used a number of different aircraft to develop methods of measuring ocean characteristics, and estimates of aerosols.

===Airborne laser target===
In February 2002, Proteus carried a pod which served as a target for development of the Boeing YAL-1 Airborne Laser system. The pod housed an array of over 2000 small holes containing optical sensors to detect the laser system. Due to scheduling constraints with other Proteus customers, the Airborne Laser never conducted an actual flight test with the Proteus target system. A target system was designed and integrated into the NKC-135 Big Crow aircraft and used for the majority of Airborne Laser testing.

===ERAST DSA system===
In March 2002, NASA Dryden, in cooperation with New Mexico State University&#x27;s Technical Analysis and Applications Center (TAAC), the FAA and several other entities, conducted flight demonstrations of an active detect, see and avoid (DSA) system for potential application to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) out of Las Cruces, New Mexico. This was a part of the NASA ERAST Project. Proteus was flown as a surrogate UAV controlled remotely from the ground, although safety pilots were aboard to handle takeoff and landing and any potential emergencies. Three other aircraft, ranging from general aviation aircraft to a NASA F/A-18, served as &quot;cooperative&quot; target aircraft with an operating transponder. In each of 18 different scenarios, a Goodrich Skywatch HP Traffic Advisory System (TAS) on the Proteus detected approaching air traffic on potential collision courses, including several scenarios with two aircraft approaching from different directions. The remote pilot then directed Proteus to turn, climb or descend as needed to avoid the potential threat.

In April 2003, a second series of flight demonstrations focusing on &quot;non-cooperative&quot; aircraft (those without operating transponders), was conducted in restricted airspace near Mojave, California, again using the Proteus as a surrogate UAV. Proteus was equipped with a small Amphitech OASys 35 GHz primary radar system to detect potential intruder aircraft on simulated collision courses. The radar data was sent directly to the ground station as well as via an Inmarsat satellite system installed on Proteus. A mix of seven intruder aircraft, ranging from a sailplane to a high-speed jet, flew 20 scenarios over a four-day period, one or two aircraft at a time. In each case, the radar picked up the intruding aircraft at ranges from 2.5 to , depending on the intruder&#x27;s radar signature. Proteus&#x27; remote pilot on the ground was able to direct Proteus to take evasive action if needed.

===IHOP 2002===
The International H2O Project (IHOP 2002) was a field experiment which took place over the Southern Great Plains of the United States from May 13 to June 25, 2002. The chief aim of IHOP 2002 was improved characterization of the four-dimensional (4-D) distribution of water vapor and its application to improving the understanding and prediction of convection. The NASA Holographic Airborne Rotating Lidar Instrument Experiment was flown as a part of this project. Flights were performed in coordination with Lockheed P-3 and DC-8 aircraft.

===NASA Crystal-FACE===
In July 2002, Proteus participated in Crystal-FACE, measuring tropical cirrus clouds, operating from Key West, Florida, flying as far south as Belize. For this phase of the project, the aircraft was configured with canards and -foot wingtip extensions.
===ARM-UAV===
Proteus has been used in a number of deployments as a part of a project sponsored by the DOE&#x27;s Atmospheric Radiation Measurement program and the Sandia National Laboratories to study cirrus clouds in the upper atmosphere.

===Space trapeze===
In May and June 2005, Transformational Space Corp., or t/Space, flight tested their rocket release concept utilizing Scaled Composites&#x27; Proteus. A captive-carry test flight was performed on May 13, and the rocket mockup was dropped three times, on May 24, June 7 and June 14, over Edwards AFB. The mockup was a 23% scale model of a proposed four-person crew capsule (called the CXV) and its AirLaunch LLC-produced QuickReach II booster. These particular flight tests were to demonstrate the concept of t/Space&#x27;s Trapeze/Lanyard (TLAD) air drop system.

===Model 395 development===

Northrop Grumman is using the Proteus to research new UAV technologies, as it can be controlled from the cockpit, a ground control station, or operate semi-autonomously. Scaled, in partnership with Northrop Grumman, is offering a fully uncrewed version of the Proteus, labeled Model 395, as part of the competition for the USAF Hunter-Killer competition. If selected, that product would have been flown in 2007.

On February 24, 2005, Proteus became Scaled&#x27;s first bomber with the release of an inert 500-pound weapon over Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada.

===Global Hawk radar===
On April 27, 2006, Proteus flight tested a large pod designed to house a developmental version of the Multi-Platform Radar Technology Insertion Program, or MP-RTIP. This is a long range, high resolution air-to-ground and air-to-air synthetic aperture radar system being developed for use on the RQ-4 Global Hawk. This pod is, by function of its length and frontal area, one of the largest payloads carried by Proteus to date. Actual flight testing of the MP-RTIP system began in late September 2006, with initial flight reaching and altitude.

==World records==
Proteus has set several world altitude records in FAI Class C-1e (Landplanes: takeoff weight ), Group 2, turbojet, including:

*Altitude: piloted by Mike Melvill and Robert Waldmiller, , October 25, 2000.
*Altitude in horizontal flight: piloted by Mike Melvill and Robert Waldmiller, , October 25, 2000.
*Altitude with payload: piloted by Mike Melvill and Robert Waldmiller, , October 27, 2000.

<text>The Orenburg Cossack Host () was a part of the Cossack population in pre-revolutionary Russia, located in the Orenburg province (today&#x27;s Orenburg Oblast, part of the Chelyabinsk Oblast and Bashkortostan).

==History==

After having constructed fortifications around the future town of Orenburg in 1734, they officially founded it in 1735. For the purpose of defending the city and colonizing the region, the Russian government relocated the Cossacks from Ufa, Iset, Samara and other places and created the Orenburg non-regular corps in 1748. In 1755, a part of it was transformed into the Orenburg Cossack Host with 2,000 men.

In 1773–1774, the Orenburg Cossacks took part in Yemelyan Pugachev&#x27;s insurrection. In 1798, all of the Cossack settlements in the Southern Urals were incorporated into the Orenburg Cossack Host (except for the Ural Cossacks). A decree of 1840 established the borders of the Host and its composition (10 cavalry regiments and 3 artillery battalions). In the mid-19th century, the Cossack population of this region equaled 200,000 people.

The Orenburg Host participated in the Russo-Swedish War of 1788–1790, and later in the campaigns that Russia waged in order to conquer Central Asia.

==Organisation==

The Orenburg Host consisted of 2 districts, or &quot;okrugs&quot; (after 1878 - 3 departments, or &quot;otdels&quot;). By 1916, the Cossack population of this region had grown to 533,000 people occupying a territory of 7,45 million desyatinas. One desyatina equaled 2,7 acres (11,000 m2). In the early 19th century, the Orenburg Cossack Host supplied 6 cavalry regiments, 3 artillery battalions, 1 cavalry battalion, 1 sotnia (100 men) of guards and 2 detached sotnias. During World War I, the Orenburg Cossack Host supplied 18 cavalry regiments, 9,5 artillery battalions, 1 cavalry battalion, 1 sotnia of guards, 9 unmounted sotnias, 7,5 reserve sotnias and 39 detached and special sotnias (to a total of about 27,000 men). 

==Post revolution==
After the October Revolution of 1917, the leadership of the Orenburg Cossack Host, under the command of Ataman Alexander Dutov, fought against the Turkestan Red Army. The poorer Cossacks joined the ranks of the Red Army. The 1st Orenburg Cossack Socialist Regiment took part in the Ural Army Campaign of 1918.

In 1920, the Orenburg Cossack Host ceased to exist.

== Distinctions ==

The distinguishing colour of the Orenburg Cossack Host was light blue; worn on the cap bands, shoulder straps and wide trouser stripes of a dark green uniform, of the loose-fitting cut common to the Steppe Cossacks. High fleece hats were worn on occasion with light blue cloth tops. Officers wore silver epaulettes and braiding. After 1907, a khaki-grey service uniform of standard Imperial Cavalry pattern was introduced, but the light blue distinctions were retained until 1920.

<doc id="1032041" wikidata="Q2354647" url="?curid=1032041" title="Max Factor">
<text>Max Factor is a line of cosmetics from Coty, founded in 1909 as Max Factor &amp; Company by Maksymilian Faktorowicz.

Max Factor specialized in movie make-up. Until its 1973 sale for US$500 million (approximately $ billion in 2017 dollars), Max Factor &amp; Company was owned by several generations of the family, becoming an international company during that time. Procter &amp; Gamble purchased it in 1991.

==History==
Max Factor was born Maksymilian Faktorowicz in Congress Poland, and later moved to Moscow where he was employed as a wig maker. After immigrating to the United States in 1904, Factor moved his family and business to Los Angeles, California, seeing an opportunity to provide made-to-order wigs and theatrical make-up to the growing film industry. Besides selling his own make-up products he soon became the West Coast distributor of both Leichner and Minor, two leading theatrical make-up manufacturers.

When the film industry was beginning to evolve, stick greasepaint (although the accepted make-up for stage use) could not be applied thinly enough, nor did the colors work satisfactorily on the screen. Factor began experimenting with various compounds to develop a suitable make-up for the new film medium. By 1914 he had perfected his first cosmetic product. With this major achievement to his credit, Max Factor became the authority on cosmetics in film-making. Soon movie stars were eager to sample his &quot;flexible greasepaint&quot;.

For the first few years of the business, Factor personally applied his products to actors and actresses. He developed a reputation for being able to customize makeup to present film stars in the best possible light on screen. Among his most notable clients were Mabel Normand, Ben Turpin, Gloria Swanson, Mary Pickford, Pola Negri, Jean Harlow, Claudette Colbert, Bette Davis, Norma Shearer, Joan Crawford, Lucille Ball and Judy Garland. 

In 1918, Max Factor completed development of his &quot;Color Harmony&quot; face powder which, due to its wide range of shades, allowed him to customize and provide more consistent make-up for each actor. He created many unique looks for notable actresses, such as Clara Bow&#x27;s heart-shaped/pierrot lips. Years later, he exaggerated Joan Crawford&#x27;s naturally full lips to distinguish her from the many would-be stars copying the Clara Bow look. He also created specific shades: Platinum (Jean Harlow), Special Medium (Joan Crawford), Dark (Claudette Colbert) and Light Egyptian (Lena Horne). For Rudolph Valentino, he created makeup to complement the actor&#x27;s complexion and mask the darkness of his skin on screen.

In 1920, Max Factor accepted his son Frank&#x27;s suggestion and officially began referring to his products as &quot;make-up,&quot; based on the verb phrase &quot;to make up&quot; (one&#x27;s face). Until then the term &quot;cosmetics&quot; had been used; &quot;make-up&quot; was considered vulgar, to be used only by people in the theater or of dubious reputation and not in polite society.

In 1922, while on holiday in Europe with his wife, Factor visited the Leichner headquarters in Germany. He was by then the biggest retailer of their theatrical stick greasepaint, yet Factor was snubbed and kept waiting at reception. Upset at this treatment, he left and immediately cabled his sons to begin selling his own brand of greasepaint. Until then, Factor had made his own greasepaint for his clients, but had made no attempt to market it while he was representing other brands. Now he concentrated on his own products, which he offered in a collapsible tube instead of in stick form. His tube greasepaint was not only more hygienic, but could be applied thinly and evenly. Soon Max Factor&#x27;s version was the leading brand.

By the 1920s, his sons Davis and Frank were heavily involved in the business, with Davis the general manager and Frank assisting his father in the development of new products. In 1925, the company received its biggest order to date when it had to complete a rush order to supply 600 gallons of light olive makeup for the movie &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; to ensure the skin color of the extras used in filming undertaken in America would match that of the darker-skinned Italian extras in the scenes filmed in Italy.

For the 1926 film &quot;Mare Nostrum&quot;, Max and Frank Factor developed the first waterproof theatrical make-up.

By the 1920s, Max Factor was becoming known outside the film community, which led to the company developing an in-house PR department in the early 1930s.

In 1935, Max Factor opened the Max Factor Salon, which was frequented by virtually all of Classic Hollywood&#x27;s greatest starlets.

==National distribution==
While Max Factor was satisfied to remain a specialized supplier of products to the film community, his children were convinced they could grow the company into a much larger enterprise. National distribution began in 1927 when Sales Builders, an established distribution company, obtained the rights to advertise, distribute and sell Factor&#x27;s products. Due to his strong connection with the film industry, Max Factor was able to use celebrity endorsements in advertising. In return for a nominal payment of US$1 to the actor, the advertising would also promote the star&#x27;s latest film.

==Development of Panchromatic==
The introduction of sound-on-film led to the replacement of the old noisy carbon arc lights by tungsten lights, which were less hot and created a softer light. At the same time the orthochromatic film, which until that time had been used by the industry, was replaced by super-sensitive faster Panchromatic film which noticeably darkened skin colors. These developments required six months of intensive development to create make-up compatible with the new environment. Because they had been designed for black and white film the existing products were unsuitable for everyday use. This new Panchromatic make-up was trademarked in October 1929.

==Development of Pan-Cake==
The development of Technicolor film required the company to develop a new line of products as its existing Panchromatic make-up left a slight sheen on the skin which reflected surrounding colors. As a result of how bad they looked in color many actors and actresses refused to appear in color films. Because Max Factor was recovering from being hit by a delivery van at the time, Frank Factor took the lead in the two years it took to develop a suitable make-up, initially called the &quot;T-D&quot; and then renamed the &quot;Pan-Cake&quot; series. It was sold in a solid cake form and applied with a damp sponge which offered the advantage of concealing skin imperfections under a transparent matte finish. Its first appearance was in the film &quot;Vogues of 1938&quot;. The Pan-Cake make-up was made for on-screen looks but was wearable for day-to-day looks.

It was an immediate hit and its advantages led to women stealing it from the film sets and using it privately. Its only disadvantage for everyday use was that it could not be used at night as it made the skin too dark under all but the powerful lights used in film studios. While Max Factor wanted to reserve the product for film use, Frank Factor was open to the commercial possibilities and began developing lighter shades. At the time the company was only able to produce enough to meet studio demand, which delayed commercial release until production could be increased. The company used the release of &quot;Vogues of 1938&quot; in August 1937 and five months later &quot;The Goldwyn Follies&quot;, the second film to use the make-up, to commercially release Pan-Cake to the public, backed by a color-based national advertising campaign. It immediately became the fastest and largest selling single make-up item to date, as well as the standard make-up used in all Technicolor films.

==Beauty micrometer==

In the 1930s, Factor helped to develop a mask-like device to measure the contours of subjects&#x27; faces. He called it the &quot;Beauty Micrometer&quot;. Its purpose was to detect even barely-visible structural flaws, that might be magnified and more-noticeable on camera. A technician could then apply makeup to mask the problem.

==Max Factor&#x27;s death==
After Max Factor&#x27;s death in 1938, Frank Factor took the name Max Factor, Jr., and expanded the still private cosmetics firm, along with members of the immediate family including Sidney Factor, Louis Factor, Davis Factor and Max Firestein.

In 1939 Max Factor, Jr., began development of a smear-proof lipstick which would also both be non-irritating and not change color. A kissing machine was constructed to test the formula&#x27;s resistance to fading. The result was released in 1940 as &quot;Tru-Color&quot; in six shades of red.

During World War II, Max Factor developed make-up shades for use by the US Marine Corps in camouflaging faces.

In 1947 after 26 months of development by Max Factor, Jr., the company released &quot;Pan-Stik&quot;, a cream make-up supplied in stick form and designed to take advantage of the latest changes in studio lighting and film stock. This product was quick to apply as well as non-greasy. It was released to the public in 1948 and was immediately commercially successful.

In 1951 the company expanded their range to offer a range of male shampoo, aftershave lotion, deodorant and shaving foams.

The introduction of color television lead the company to develop Max Factor Color TV Make-up, which became the standard for use in color television.

In 1955 the company released &quot;Electrique&quot;, its first fragrance and three years later &quot;Primitif&quot;.

In 1956 Max Factor inc. purchased Sales Builders, which had until that time handled all of their national sales and distribution. This led to a complete reorganization of the company&#x27;s American markets, advertising, sales and distribution division.

By the 1960s, Max Factor, Jr., Max Firestein, and grandsons Donald Factor, Alfred Jay Firestein and Chester Lee Firestein were still involved. Under his leadership, in 1965 Max Factor, Jr., established &quot;Geminesse&quot;, a line of makeup, skincare and perfume products that were sold only by uniformed clerks in department stores. The packaging and products were different; many of the containers were designed to resemble Greek sculptures.

The early 1960s saw the company become a public company and list its Class A stock on the New York Stock Exchange. This period also saw the third generation of the Factor family, Barbara Factor, Davis Jr. Factor, Donald Factor, Alfred Firestein, and Chester Firestein rising to senior positions within the company. His place of work is now a museum located in downtown Hollywood.

==Merger with Norton Simon==
By the early 1970s Sidney Factor had retired from the board, and Barbara Factor, Donald Factor and Davis Jr. Factor from the third generation had also left the company to pursue other interests. As a result, there was decreasing family involvement. Davis Factor was still board chairman while Alfred Jay Firestein was president and CEO when in 1973 the company agreed to merge with Norton Simon. This event was marred weeks later by the sudden death of Alfred Jay Firestein at the age of 48. Chester Firestein succeeded him as president of the company, only to resign three years later in 1976, to devote his time to his personal interests; he was replaced by a non-family member. His departure, together with that of Max Factor, Jr., in the same year, meant that there were now no members of Max Factor&#x27;s immediate family working for the company.

During Chester Firestein&#x27;s time in charge the company expanded overseas and launched many new products including Musk For Men, UltaLucent Waterproof make-up and, in 1975, the successful Halston line of fragrances, which quickly became the second best-selling designer fragrance in the world, trailing Chanel No. 5.

It was under Norton Simon that Max Factor launched &quot;Maxi&quot;, a line of makeup aimed at a younger, more savvy consumer. Maxi sold products aimed at adolescent tastes, such as lip gloss, color rubs and &quot;mood&quot; lipsticks. Maxi was priced to compete with market leaders Bonne Bell and CoverGirl. Neither Maxi, Geminesse, nor Max Factor were able to lift the company&#x27;s declining profits and market share.

In 1983 Norton Simon was taken over by Esmark, by which time no one in the Factor family was involved in the company&#x27;s day-to-day operations. A year later Esmark merged with Beatrice Foods, which lumped Max Factor into their Playtex beauty division and moved the Max Factor headquarters from Los Angeles to Stamford, Connecticut. In 1986, Ronald Perelman of Revlon bought the Playtex beauty division for $500 million. In 1991, Revlon sold Max Factor to Procter &amp; Gamble for $1.5 billion.

By the first quarter of 2010, Procter &amp; Gamble had discontinued Max Factor in the United States, instead focusing its marketing efforts on the more successful CoverGirl cosmetics line. Max Factor continued to be marketed overseas.

In June, 2015, Max Factor was one of a number of beauty brands purchased from P&amp;G by Coty for $12 billion. Coty relaunched Max Factor in 2018.

==Innovations==
Max Factor is credited with many cosmetic innovations, among which are:
* 1914: Released the first cosmetic made specifically for motion pictures, a thinner greasepaint made in 12 shades. It was in cream form and packaged in jars, as opposed to the thicker stick grease paints used for theater.
* 1917: Released &quot;Supreme Liquid Whitener&quot; which provided the means of obtaining an alabaster smoothness on the neck, shoulder, arms and hands.
* 1918: Released &quot;Color Harmony&quot;, a range of face powder which due to its wide range of shades allowed the customizing of consistent make-up for an individual actor or actress.
* 1925: Released &quot;Max Factor&#x27;s Supreme Nail Polish,&quot; a metal pot of beige-colored powder that was sprinkled on the nails and buffed with a chamois buffer, to give nails shine and some tint.
* 1927: Released &quot;Society Nail Tint,&quot; a small porcelain pot containing rose colored cream. Applied to the nail and buffed, it gave a natural rose color. &quot;Society Nail White&quot; was also released. This was a tube of chalky white liquid that was applied under nail tips and left to dry. The result resembled the modern French manicure.
* 1928: Developed cosmetics specifically for use in black-and-white films. Max Sr. was awarded an Oscar award for this innovation.
* 1930: Invented lip gloss.
* 1932: Developed a line of &quot;Television Make-up,&quot; specifically to meet the needs of television.
* 1934: Released Liquid Nail Enamel, forerunner of today&#x27;s nail polishes.
* 1935: Opened the Max Factor Make-up Salon in Los Angeles.
* 1935: Released &quot;Pan-Cake&quot;, forerunner of modern cake makeup, originally developed for color films.

* 1948: Released &quot;Pan-Stik&quot; makeup.
* 1954: Released &quot;Erace&quot;, the original concealer, and developed a line of cosmetics specifically for color television&#x27;s needs. (This line remained the standard for TV cosmetics until the arrival of HDTV.)
* 1971: Released the first &quot;waterproof&quot; make-up.
* 1980: Japanese subsidiary acquired an antioxidant derived from sake wine, called &quot;Pitera&quot;. Subsequently, launched &quot;Max Factor Secret Key with Pitera&quot;, which would later be renamed SK-II.
* 1988: Launched the world&#x27;s first clear colorless mascara
* 2000: Launched the first 12-hour long-lasting non-transfer lip color, &quot;Lipfinity&quot; lipstick
* 2008: Launched &quot;False Lash Effect mascara&quot;

<text>Fartura is a municipality in the state of São Paulo in Brazil. The population is 16,070 (2020 est.) in an area of 429 km2. The elevation is 516 m.

== History ==

Historically inhabited by the Caiová Indians of the Guarani macro-family, the fertile lands of Fartura began to attract settlers in the late 19th century, a time when large settlements were carried out under the leadership of Frei Pacífico de Montefalco and financed by João da Silva Machado, the Baron of Antonina.

In 1880, fulfilling a promise made by his father, Manoel Remígio Viana donated land to Luís Ribeiro Salgado and Vicente de Oliveira Trindade with the obligation to build a chapel in honor of Our Lady of Sorrows, the patron saint of the municipality. The completion of the work was only possible with the efforts of the local families, who had recently built a wooden cross under which they prayed on Sundays and holy days. The strong religiosity of the early inhabitants of Fartura is represented by the vivid red cross on the municipality&#x27;s coat of arms, a symbol of high Christian faith according to traditional heraldry.

In 1881, the newly inaugurated Municipal Chamber of Piraju sent tax inspector Manuel Martins to Fartura with the aim of collecting the taxes due from the growing settlement, thus beginning its struggle to prevent the village from being elevated to the status of a District and, subsequently, the construction of a new parish. However, on February 7, 1884, Domingos Antônio Raiol, then president of the province, sanctioned Law No. 5 of the Province of São Paulo, elevating the village of Capela Nossa Senhora das Dores de Fartura to the category of Freguesia de Fartura, detaching it from Piraju and annexing it to Itaporanga.

On March 31, 1891, the year of the first republican Constitution, after facing much political resistance, Américo Brasiliense de Almeida Melo issued decree no. 145/1891 of the State of São Paulo, elevating the newly formed Freguesia de Fartura to the status of a municipality. This date is considered the foundation of the municipality, celebrated by the townspeople with EXPOFAR, commonly known as the Fartura Festival. The traditional city anniversary celebration provides residents and visitors from neighboring cities with various artistic and cultural attractions, such as traditional and contemporary country music shows, a festival of country-style guitar, an amusement park, open-air markets, and more.

Interestingly, the disagreement over the name of the municipality was already present among the early inhabitants, but the most accepted version is that Fartura is due to the abundance of fish in the stream that bathes the city.

== Media ==
In telecommunications, the city was served by Telecomunicações de São Paulo. In July 1998, this company was acquired by Telefónica, which adopted the Vivo brand in 2012. The company is currently an operator of cell phones, fixed lines, internet (fiber optics/4G) and television (satellite and cable).

<text>King crabs are decapod crustaceans of the family Lithodidae that are chiefly found in deep waters and are adapted to cold environments. They are composed of two subfamilies: Lithodinae, which tend to inhabit deep waters, are globally distributed, and comprise the majority of the family&#x27;s species diversity; and Hapalogastrinae, which are endemic to the North Pacific and inhabit exclusively shallow waters. King crabs superficially resemble true crabs but are generally understood to be closest to the pagurid hermit crabs. This placement of king crabs among the hermit crabs is supported by several anatomical peculiarities which are present only in king crabs and hermit crabs, making them a prominent example of carcinisation among decapods. Several species of king crabs, especially in Alaskan and southern South American waters, are targeted by commercial fisheries and have been subject to overfishing.

==Taxonomy==
The phylogeny of king crabs as hermit crabs who underwent secondary calcification and left their shell has been suspected since the late 1800s. They are believed to have originated during the Early Miocene in shallow North Pacific waters, where most king crab genera – including all Hapalogastrinae – are distributed and where they exhibit a high amount of morphological diversity.

In 2007, the king crabs were moved from their classification among the hermit crabs in the superfamily Paguroidea into a separate superfamily, Lithodoidea. This was not without controversy, as there is widespread consensus in the scientific community that king crabs are derived from hermit crabs and closely related to pagurid hermit crabs; therefore, a separate superfamily in the classification poorly reflected the phylogenetic relationship of this taxon. In 2023, king crabs were folded back into Paguroidea, with Lithodoidea being considered superseded. The king crab&#x27;s relationship to other hermit crabs as well as the family&#x27;s internal phylogeny can be seen in the following two cladograms:

, there are 15 known genera of king crabs across two subfamilies. These include:

=== Hapalogastrinae ===
=== Lithodinae ===
== Description ==

King crabs are distinctive among hermit crabs for their superficial similarity to true crabs. They are a morphologically diverse group, but they all have in common the functionalities of their five pairs of legs, called pereopods: the first and anteriormost set are chelipeds whose right side is generally noticeably more robust than the left; the second, third, and fourth are walking legs tipped with sharp dactyli; and the fifth, used for cleaning, are very small and generally sit inside the branchial chamber. On their underside, they have a short abdomen – composed of calcified plates – which is asymmetrical in females. This abdomen (sometimes called a pleon) is folded against the underside of the cephalothorax and is composed of six segments – called somites or pleonites – and a telson. In Hapalogastrinae, this abdomen is soft, while it is hard and calcified in members of Lithodinae. Lithodids lack any sort of uropod seen in some decapods.

== Distribution ==
King crabs are typically found in deep waters, especially in polar and subpolar regions and near hydrothermal vents and cold seeps. Members of Lithodinae can be found in all five of the world&#x27;s oceans, namely the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern, and Arctic, while members of Hapalogastrinae are only found in the North Pacific. Members of Hapalogastrinae exhibit a tolerance for higher temperatures than Lithodinae; whereas Lithodinae tend to live exclusively in deep waters or – less commonly – high-latitude shallow waters, Hapalogastrinae are found only in shallow waters (&lt;).

== Fisheries ==

Because of their large size, the taste of their meat, and their status as a delicacy, some species of king crabs are caught and sold as food. Red (&quot;Paralithodes camtschaticus&quot;) and blue (&quot;Paralithodes platypus&quot;) king crabs are heavily targeted by commercial fisheries in Alaska and have been for several decades. However, populations have fluctuated in the past 25 years, and some areas are currently closed due to overfishing. Alaskan fisheries additionally target the golden king crab (&quot;Lithodes aequispinus&quot;). In South America, both the southern king crab (&quot;Lithodes santolla&quot;) and several species of &quot;Paralomis&quot; are targeted by commercial fisheries, and as a result, the population of &quot;L. santolla&quot; has seen a dramatic decline.

== Symbionts and parasites ==
Juveniles of species of king crabs, including &quot;Neolithodes diomedeae&quot;, use a species (&quot;Scotoplanes Sp. A&quot;) of sea cucumber (often known as &quot;sea pigs&quot;) as hosts and can be found on top of and under &quot;Scotoplanes&quot;. The &quot;Scotoplanes&quot; reduce the risk of predation for the &quot;N. diomedeae&quot;, while the &quot;Scotoplanes&quot; are not harmed from being hosts, which supports the consensus that the two organisms have a commensal relationship. Endosymbiotic microorganisms of the order Eccrinida have been found in &quot;Paralithodes camtschaticus&quot; and &quot;Lithodes maja&quot;, living in their hindgut between molts.

Some species of king crab, including those of the genera &quot;Lithodes&quot;, &quot;Neolithodes&quot;, &quot;Paralithodes&quot;, and likely &quot;Echidnocerus&quot;, act as hosts to some parasitic species of careproctus fish. The careproctus lays eggs in the gill chamber of the king crab which serves as a well-protected and aerated area for the eggs to reside until they hatch. On occasion king crabs have been found to be host to the eggs of multiple species of careproctus simultaneously. King crabs are additionally parasitized by rhizocephalan genus &quot;Briarosaccus&quot;, a type of barnacle. The barnacle irreversibly sterilizes the crab, and over 50% of some king crab populations are affected.

<text>Blastoids (class Blastoidea) are an extinct type of stemmed echinoderm, often referred to as sea buds. They first appear, along with many other echinoderm classes, in the Ordovician period, and reached their greatest diversity in the Mississippian subperiod of the Carboniferous period. However, blastoids may have originated in the Cambrian. Blastoids persisted until their extinction at the end of Permian, about 250 million years ago. Although never as diverse as their contemporary relatives, the crinoids, blastoids are common fossils, especially in many Mississippian-age rocks.

==Description==
Like most echinoderms, blastoids were protected by a set of interlocking plates of calcium carbonate, which formed the main body, or &quot;theca&quot;. In life, the theca of a typical blastoid was attached to a stalk or column made up of stacked disc-shaped plates. The other end of the column was attached to the ocean floor by a holdfast, very much like stalked crinoids. The stalk was usually relatively short, and in some species, was absent, with the holdfast being attached directly to the base of the theca.

The mouth was at the summit of the theca. Radiating like flower petals from the center were five food grooves, or &quot;ambulacra&quot;. Each ambulacrum had many long thin fine structures called &quot;brachioles&quot;, which were used to trap food particles and bring them to the mouth. Brachioles were delicate structures, and in fossils are not usually preserved in place. A series of five spiracle plates surrounded the star-shaped mouth, which included the anus, mouth and entrances to a set of five complex, folded respiratory organs known as &quot;hydrospires&quot;. These spiracles prevented mixing of the various fluids. Waste elimination was through the &quot;anispiracle&quot;, an opening formed by the fusing of anus and adjacent spiracles.
Like crinoids, blastoids were high-level stalked suspension feeders (feeding mainly on planktonic organisms) that inhabited clear-to-silty, moderately agitated ocean waters from shelf to basin. The food gathering system of blastoids consisted of several types of ambulacra. Food entered the brachiolar ambulacra, was transferred to the side ambulacra through the brachiolar pit, then transferred to the main (median) ambulacra, and finally entered the mouth. Each of these ambulacra was roofed by cover plates. The cover plates of the brachiolar groove were movable and could open, allowing food to enter, or close as needed. Other cover plates may also have been movable.

==Taxonomy==

Blastoids are assumed to have evolved from the Cystoids. Blastoids are subdivided into two orders: Fissiculata, which are characterized by direct entrance to the individual hydrospires by way of slits; and Spiraculata, which are characterized by indirect entrance to the hydrospires through canals by way of pores. The earliest blastoid yet found, &quot;Macurdablastus&quot; from the Middle Ordovician of Tennessee, cannot be classified as either order.

<text>The 2001 Gujarat earthquake, also known as the Bhuj earthquake, occurred on 26 January at . The epicentre was about 9 km south-southwest of the village of Chobari in Bhachau Taluka of Kutch district in Gujarat, India. The earthquake had a maximum Mercalli intensity of XII (&quot;Extreme&quot;).

The intraplate earthquake measured 7.6 on the moment magnitude scale and occurred at a depth of . The earthquake killed at least 20,023 people, injured another 166,000 and destroyed about 400,000 buildings in Gujarat, India and Sindh, Pakistan. The vast majority of deaths and damage were observed in Kutch district, while nearly 1,600 additional deaths occurred in the cities of Ahmedabad, Rajkot, Jamnagar, Surendranagar, Surat, Gandhinagar and Vadodara.
==Tectonic setting==

Gujarat lies 300–400 km from the plate boundary between the Indian plate and the Eurasian plate, but the current tectonics are still governed by the effects of the continuing continental collision along this boundary. During the break-up of Gondwana in the Jurassic, this area was affected by rifting with a roughly west–east trend. During the collision with Eurasia the area has undergone shortening, involving both reactivation of the original rift faults and development of new low-angle thrust faults. The related folding has formed a series of ranges, particularly in central Kutch.

The focal mechanism of most earthquakes is consistent with reverse faulting on reactivated rift faults. The pattern of uplift and subsidence associated with the 1819 Rann of Kutch earthquake is consistent with reactivation of such a fault.
==Earthquake==
The earthquake was caused by movement on a previously unknown south-dipping fault, trending parallel to the inferred rift structures. No major surface ruptures were associated with the shock, classifying it as a blind thrust earthquake. Lateral spreading was widely reported and strike-slip faulting was observed at Bharodia and Manfara. On the moment magnitude scale, the International Seismological Centre said it measured a magnitude of 7.6, while the United States Geological Survey put it at 7.7.
===Seismology===
A finite fault model from the USGS estimated that the earthquake rupture had an area of x , lasting approximately 25 seconds. Slip was mostly concentrated around the northern patches of the rupture, with a maximum slip of recorded in the village of Chobari. The full rupture also extended through the cities of Bhuj and Rapar, although slip in these areas was extremely minor. Despite the large magnitude and rupture area, no visible surface ruptures could be identified in the epicentral area.
===Geological effects===
The earthquake had a maximum Modified Mercalli intensity of IX-XII (&quot;Violent&quot;-&quot;Extreme&quot;). It also registered X (&quot;Devastating&quot;) on the Medvedev–Sponheuer–Karnik scale, with the maximum intensity observed over an east-northeast elongated zone of approximately ; much of Gujarat recorded tremors of VII (&quot;Very Strong&quot;) or higher. Ahmedabad recorded a maximum peak ground acceleration of 0.11 &quot;g&quot;. Shaking from the earthquake lasted several minutes, with stronger ground motion lasting at least 85 seconds. Numerous rockfalls and landslides occurred in the Bhuj and Bhachau areas. There was extensive evidence of soil liquefaction at the Rann of Kutch, Banni Grasslands Reserve, coastal areas of the Gulf of Kutch and numerous sand boils in dry lakebeds northeast of Bhuj. After the earthquake, these sand boils had fountains of saline groundwater rising . Widespread subsidence and lateral spreading also occurred at Kandla and Navlakhi ports.
===Aftershocks===
By 31 December 2001, there were 107 aftershocks exceeding which were recorded by the USGS, including 9 events measuring or higher; most aftershocks occurred south of the epicenter near Bhachau. The largest aftershock occurred on 28 January, had a magnitude of and was located west-southwest of Rapar.

==Impact==
The death toll varies greatly, with the United States Geological Survey&#x27;s PAGER-CAT catalog reporting 20,023 fatalities while earlier estimates had placed the death toll at approximately 125,000. Additionally, 166,836 injuries were recorded, a total of 28 million people across Gujarat were affected, and 442 villages lost at least 70% of houses. In Kutch District, 90% of homes were damaged or destroyed, with 24% of the housing stock affected overall in Gujarat; most affected buildings were non-engineered, unreinforced stonemasonry, although many reinforced concrete buildings also collapsed. Water outages were widespread due to liquefaction and soil compaction, with many pumping stations and two water towers collapsing in the affected area. However, damage to highways and bridges was relatively minor. 

Bhuj, one of the closest cities to the epicenter, was devastated, with roughly 10,000 people killed and 95% of buildings destroyed or uninhabitable after the quake; 38,653 homes partially or fully collapsed in the city. The quake also destroyed eight schools, two hospitals and 4 km of road in Bhuj, and partly destroyed the historic Swaminarayan temple and historic forts, Prag Mahal and Aina Mahal. The Indian National Trust for Arts and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) inspected more than 250 heritage buildings in Kutch and Saurashtra and found that about 40% of them either collapsed or were seriously damaged; only 10% were undamaged. Bhuj&#x27;s district hospital collapsed, killing about 193 people inside, while at the city&#x27;s main telephone exchange building, 50% of its walls collapsed, damaging interior electrical controls and resulting in many casualties.

Over 1.2 million houses in 8,000 villages and 490 towns were damaged or destroyed, as well as 12,000 schools, 2,000 health facilities, many historic buildings and tourist attractions; 400,000 of the damaged homes completely collapsed. Across Bhachau, over 5,000 people died and 9,000 houses were damaged or destroyed. In Chobari, the closest settlement to the epicenter, all 3,200 houses were razed and 648 residents were killed. Over 400 were also feared dead in Rapar. Adhoi village lost 354 residents, including 25 students at a school. Much of Vondh was also razed and 400 people died there. All 208 houses in the village of Visnagar were also destroyed. In Anjar, over 2,000 people died, including 204 who were killed at a Republic Day parade. There were also nearly 2,000 deaths in Gandhidham, where 30 high-rise buildings collapsed, and in nearby Kandla, roads and facilities at the Port of Kandla were badly affected. At the Navlakhi, extensive subsidence caused the main access road and port to drop below sea level at high tide, preventing goods from being imported; lateral spreading caused a newly built reinforced concrete wharf to collapse into the sea. Ten people were killed and all 940 homes were badly damaged in Dhori village, including 914 which were completely razed by the quake, along with multiple health centers, schools, a water tower, the mosque and three Hindu temples. In Khavda, 240 people died, thousands more were injured, 20% of homes collapsed and 40% of others were moderately damaged. There were also 225 deaths in Ratnal.

In Ahmedabad, 1,021 apartments and 82 houses collapsed, and 752 people were killed. Collapsing multistory buildings also caused deaths in Morbi and Surat. Total property damage was estimated at $7.5 billion. The Indian military provided emergency support which was later augmented by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Society. A temporary Red Cross hospital remained in Bhuj to provide care while a replacement hospital was built.

There were also 19 deaths in Pakistan. The Badin-Tharparkar area recorded 12 deaths, 115 injuries, 1,989 collapsed homes and 43,643 damaged homes. Liquefaction from the earthquake resulted in sugarcane farms being flooded, affecting crops in the village of Kadhan.

== Reconstruction ==
Four months after the earthquake the Gujarat government announced the Gujarat Earthquake Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Policy. The policy proposed a different approach to urban and rural construction with the estimated cost of rebuilding to be US$1.77 billion.

The main objectives of the policy included repairing, building, and strengthening houses and public buildings. Other objectives included the revival of the economy, health support, and reconstruction of the community and social infrastructure.

=== Housing ===
The housing policies focused on the removal of rubble, setting up temporary shelters, full reconstruction of damaged houses, and the retrofitting of undamaged units. The policy established a community-driven housing recovery process. The communities affected by the earthquake were given the option for complete or partial relocation to in-situ reconstruction. The total number of eligible houses to be repaired was 929,682 and the total number of eligible houses to be reconstructed was 213,685. By 2003, 882,896 (94%) houses were repaired and 113,271 (53%) were reconstructed.

=== City planning ===
The Environmental Planning Collaborative (EPC) was commissioned to provide a new city plan for the city of Bhuj. The plan focused on creating a wider roadway network to provide emergency access to the city. The EPC used land readjustment (LR) in the form of eight town planning schemes. This was implemented by deducting land from private lot sizes to create adequate public land for the widening of roadways. The remaining land was readjusted and given back to the original owners as final plots.

== Relief ==

The Government of Gujarat created four assistance packages worth up to US$1 billion to support the reconstruction and rehabilitation of the city. These packages assisted about 300,000 families. The government also announced a US$2.5 million package to revive small, medium, and cottage industries. The World Bank and Asian Development Bank also provided loans worth $300 million and $500 million, respectively.

Assistance was offered from many countries and organisations. 

==Memorials==

Smritivan, a memorial park and museum dedicated to victims of the earthquake was built on top of Bhujia Hill in Bhuj, Kutch and opened in 2022. Spread over an area of 470 acres, it has more than 13,805 trees, each dedicated to a victim, planted in the garden and 108 small water reservoirs created on the hill.

Veer Balak Smarak in Anjar is a memorial dedicated to 185 school children and 20 teachers who died during the earthquake.

<doc id="1032081" wikidata="Q2556511" url="?curid=1032081" title="Scrameustache">
<text>The Scrameustache is a fictional character in a science-fiction Franco-Belgian comics series of the same name. He was created by the Belgian artist Gos. Gos has written and drawn all the Scrameustache&#x27;s adventures since 1972. Since the mid-1980s he has been assisted by his son Walt. Another son, Benoit has contributed as colourist. It is a popular, ongoing series.

==Background==

===Premise===
The adventures of the Scrameustache first started in issue 1806 of &quot;Spirou&quot; magazine in November 1972 under the title &quot;Khéna et le Scrameustache&quot; (&quot;Khena and the Scrameustache&quot;). The story tells of how Khena, a young Peruvian boy living in Europe, meets a cat-like alien who has come to Earth in his own flying saucer. Khena lives with his adoptive father Uncle Georges in the small town of Chambon-Les-Roses and the Scrameustache moves in with them.

What made it a little different from most Earth-kid-meets-alien stories was that a certain amount of mystery surrounded Khena himself. As a toddler he had been found in the remains of an earthquake in Peru. He was then adopted by Georges Caillau, a European scholar, archaeologist and ethnologist. Some ten years later, Khena met the Scrameustache and proved himself resistant to the alien&#x27;s (non-lethal) weapons and other technology. This resistance made the Scrameustache curious and he stuck around hoping that time would provide an explanation.

===Title and Names===
Khena&#x27;s name was later dropped from the title of the series which is now just called &quot;Le Scrameustache&quot;. He does however remain a leading character, some of the stories looking at his development from a boy in his early teens to an actual teenager.

The name &quot;Khena&quot; is taken from the word Quena which is an Inca flute.

The name &quot;Scrameustache&quot; does not appear to be based on any puns or wordplays. Gos claims that he simply came up with strange names as part of a game with friends. The same could be said about the &quot;Smurfs&quot;, or &quot;Schtroumpfs&quot;, created by Peyo, and which Gos worked on for a while. However, in &quot;D&#x27;où viens-tu, Scrameustache&quot;, p. 12, it seems that &quot;Scrameustache&quot; is a backronym for &quot;Sujet Créé par Radiations Artificielles et Manipulations Extra-Utérines Sans Toucher Aux Chromosomes Héréditaires Endogènes&quot; (&quot;Subject created by artificial radiations and extra-uterine manipulations without touching to hereditary endogenic chromosomes&quot;).

Khena&#x27;s adoptive father is Uncle Georges Caillau. &quot;Caillau&quot; sounds like &quot;caillou&quot; which is the French for &quot;stone&quot;. In &quot;Le dilemme de Khéna&quot; (&quot;Khena&#x27;s Dilemma&quot;), the young man indicates that George is descended from an aristocratic family called de la Roche (&quot;Roche&quot; being the French for &quot;rock&quot;)

==The World of the Scrameustache==
Over the years, Gos has expanded the Scrameustache&#x27;s universe, with him and Khena travelling to other planets and mixing with other aliens, above all the Galaxians.

Using his saucer, he and Khena divide their time between Earth, planet Aktarka and its two neighbouring moons. Aktarka has at least two continents and a variety of archipelagos in its oceans. Due to the orbit of its moons, both can be seen from one continent, while the other continent only sees one; the continent with view on both moons is referred to as the Continent of the Two Moons. While referred to the other continent is so far not been visited in the series.
Aktarka does not have cities like Earth, instead its human populations lives in towns and villages where each person has a bit of land to cultivate food.
Aktarka is mostly tropical, with temperate zones existing near its poles.

It is hinted in later albums that the citizens of Aktarka are descendants of Atlantians who managed to flee before the destruction of their continent on Earth.
In the series the destruction is the result of falling debris of Earth smaller moon, when the Atlantians had changed its orbit as a technological boast towards the inhabitants of the continent Mü, they inadvertently placed it in the path of a comet which smashed the moon.

Uncle Georges lives on Earth; some human friends live on Aktarka; the friendly Galaxians live on one of the moons (the smaller of the two); and the warlike Kromoks live on the other.

==Characters==

===The Scrameustache===
The Scrameustache is a genetically-created hybrid alien who resembles an upright cat. His feet are furry and hand-like and he can use them to grasp hold of handrails and other similar supports, in a way similar to a monkey. He was created by Najboul, a human scientist of planet Aktarka, who used elements of his planet&#x27;s various species.

Aktarka&#x27;s biggest mainland is known as the Continent of the Two Moons, and that is where the Scrameustache was trained as an astronaut. He later went to Earth on an undefined mission. It is hinted that the Aktarkian leaders feared his superior intelligence would turn against them and thus sent him into some kind of unofficial exile.

He now lives on Earth with Khena and Uncle Georges Caillau and is known to some of the locals.

The Scrameustache is a highly intelligent and charming character, always willing to go out of his way to help his friends. But he can also be cheeky and mischievous at times, especially towards Uncle Georges.

===Clothing and Equipment===
The Scrameustache wears a blue jumpsuit and an anti-gravity belt which slows down his falls. He does not wear shoes, except in winter time.

His main article is a bright red helmet with a brainwave-activated lamp that can be used to illuminate at will. It can also shoot a laser which paralyses people, turning then into pillars of salt for a short time. This is quite harmless unless they happen to be near water, in which case parts of their bodies may shrink as a result.

The aerials on the helmet can be used for communicating or listening into radio-emitted conversations, but this requires a certain amount of concentration on the part of the wearer.

His flying saucer is for intergalactic exploration and, by applying theories and calculations based on faster-than-light travel, can go back in time. He also has a two-seater wheel-less car-like vehicle called the Passe-partout which can fly within a breathable atmosphere.

Tobor is a robot owned by the Scrameustache. His &quot;mouth&quot; has the same functions as the Scrameustache&#x27;s helmet &quot;lamp&quot;: i.e. he can turn people temporarily into salt. He is also capable of flight.

===Khena===
Khena was found as a toddler in the remains of an earthquake in Peru. He was adopted by Georges Caillau. He first met the Scrameustache when he was in his early teens.

A later adventure established that Khena was himself an alien who came from Aktarka, the same planet as his cat-like friend. (There are hints in the earlier storyline that Gos intended this from the start.)

Khena and the Scrameustache now spend much of their time travelling to Aktarka and other planets to visit friends and relatives. But their main home is still on Earth where they loyally stick by Uncle Georges.

===Uncle Georges===
Uncle Georges Caillau is a European scholar, archaeologist and ethnologist. He adopted Khena while on an archaeological dig in Peru. He refrains from space travelling if he can avoid it and finds journeys back in time a bit nerve-racking. Although a very decent man he is quick-tempered at times, and especially finds his son&#x27;s alien friends a bit of a handful. (On one occasion the Scrameustache unintentionally produced a clone of himself: &quot;As if one wasn&#x27;t enough !&quot; groaned Uncle Georges.)

===The Galaxians===
The Galaxians are friendly, little green people who live on one of the moons that orbit planet Aktarka. Khena and the Scrameustache frequently visit them.

Galaxian society is very democratic, even in the sharing of tasks: for example, while away on missions, the crew members of a space ship take it in turn to be the ship&#x27;s captain, or Chief-of-the-Day. The annual head of state is called the Prince-of-the-Year and is the Galaxian who received the most merit points over the past year.

In overall charge is the Council of Elders which is made up of five older long-bearded Galaxians. However, they are not as wise as they would like to make out and one or two of them are quite senile; in fact a lot of their time is spent arguing between each other. The younger Galaxians are quite aware of their deficiencies and often enjoy a good laugh at the Elder&#x27;s expense (in one story a young Galaxian lawyer did warn the Elders in their faces that he could cause them to &quot;lose what little credit for wisdom you have left&quot;.)

(From the early-1980s to the late-1990s, many one-page gags and short stories were published in &quot;Spirou&quot; magazine under the title &quot;Les Galaxiens&quot;, giving humorous descriptions of Galaxian society. Some of the longer stories, such as &quot;Le prince des Galaxiens&quot; (&quot;The Galaxian Prince&quot;) or &quot;L&#x27;oeuf astral&quot; (&quot;The Astral Egg&quot;) could be described as actual Galaxian adventures with Khena and the Scrameustache appearing simply because they were the stars of the series.)

The Galaxians are not native to the moon they inhabit, in the album [The Children of the Rainbow]. Khena, Scrameustache and friends are stuck on an island where a strange meteorite blocks their technology. They discover a &#x27;temple&#x27; with the story of the first colony ship of the Galaxians, having crash landed on the island due to the same reasons our friends are stuck. The Galaxians left their world cause it was heating up without them knowing why. They later discover a ship sent by the descendants of those who stayed is also stuck on the island. Eventually the meteorite disrupting all the technology is found and neutralized. The colony ship is also found and its passengers awakened set to integrate into the new Galaxian society.

===Khena&#x27;s other family===
Khena&#x27;s actual parents are Torcal, an eminent scientist from planet Aktarka, and his wife. They were sent to Earth on a mission to Peru and took their baby son Gari with them. However, an enemy had sabotaged their spaceship and, while testing it, they were sent to an unknown period of time and space leaving Gari behind. He was found by local Peruvian Indians and named Khena. Adjusting to life in another period of Earth&#x27;s past (the European 16th Century), Torcal and his wife had two more children, son Thibaut and a daughter Berengere. They were eventually found and returned to Aktarka. Khena knew that the local laws restricted families to two children each and used this in order to stay on Earth with Uncle Georges. During the school holidays he uses the Scrameustache&#x27;s saucer to visit them on Aktarka.

Other Aktarkians include Torcal&#x27;s brother Yamouth and his daughter Pilili.

===The Ramouchas===
Ramouchas are bear-like creatures from planet Aktarka. They live on an island separated from the main continent. One of them played an important role in the Scrameustache&#x27;s upbringing. They are intelligent beings, though they are not capable of speaking. They are friendly and fun-loving but give off electric shocks as a form of humour.

===Falzar, the Wizard of the Great Bear (Ursa Major)===
Falzar, the Wizard of the Great Bear (Ursa Major), is the nearest the Scrameustache has to a sworn enemy. He is a powerful and power-crazed wizard. At one stage he was turned into a menhir by undetermined aliens and placed on Earth amongst the Carnac stones in Brittany, France. Falzar occasionally manages to break free of his imprisonment and gets up to all sorts of devilish plots, such as turning people into animals. In the end though, he usually ends up as a menhir again and is returned to the alignments. The word &quot;Falzar&quot; is French slang for &quot;trousers&quot;.

===The Kromoks and the Stixes===
Another set of enemies are the Kromoks and the Stixes. Planet Aktarka has two moons: the friendly Galaxians live on one of the moons; and the warlike Kromoks on the other.
While the Stixes often visit Aktarka and its moons, there are no indications that they are native to either.
The ape-like Kromoks aim to conquer Aktarka but being naturally stupid does not make it easy. The Stixes, yellow-skinned with pointed heads, are, on the other hand, ingenious and conniving characters and it is they who come up with the plans that the Scrameustache and his friends have to face.

==Story Summaries==
The Scrameustache&#x27;s adventures have not been published in English. Below is a list of the French titles, their year of publication, an English translation of the titles and a brief description. They are listed in order of publication. All the stories have been written and drawn by Gos. Since 1985, his son Walt has assisted in the drawing.

<doc id="1032084" wikidata="Q756203" url="?curid=1032084" title="Atlanta Silverbacks FC">
<text>The Atlanta Silverbacks FC were an American professional soccer club based in Atlanta, Georgia. Founded in 1998 as Atlanta Ruckus, the club played in many leagues over the years before folding after the 2015 season. The team played its home games at Atlanta Silverbacks Park, a large soccer complex featuring a 5,000-seat soccer-specific stadium in Atlanta, 15 miles northeast of downtown. The team&#x27;s colors were red, black, grey, and white.

The club had 2 independent supporter groups, Westside 109 and the Atlanta Ultras. The Ultras were established in 2011 &amp; were known to support both the Silverbacks men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s side. The Ultras were also to be known for their fanatical support at Silverbacks Park, as well as away matches. They had a reputation for their unfriendly or challenging attitude towards fans from opposing clubs.

The team had a Women&#x27;s Premier Soccer League counterpart in the Atlanta Silverbacks Women from 2005 through 2016.

==History==

===Atlanta Ruckus (1994–1998)===
In July 1994, the American Professional Soccer League announced it had accepted the Atlanta Magic, owned by Sam Chase, as a new franchise for the 1995 season. At the time, the Magic played in the USISL. In October 1994, the team, still referred to as the Atlanta Magic, signed national team forward Bruce Murray. However, by November 1994, Chase had decided to enter an entirely new team, to be named the Atlanta Ruckus, in the APSL. Despite this decision, several Magic players moved to the Ruckus, including Bill Andracki, Chris Hellenkamp, Brian Moore and Mo Suri. Even after the creation of the Ruckus, the Atlanta Magic continued to play in the USISL, losing to the Baltimore Bays in the 1995–96 USISL indoor season championship.

The Ruckus nearly failed even before it had played a game. Six weeks before the 1995 season, Chase experienced financial difficulties and failed to post the required $100,000 letter of credit with the league by the March 1 deadline. The league nearly revoked the franchise, but, South African businessman Johnny Imerman quickly stepped in and bought the team. The Ruckus, under former U.S. national team coach Lothar Osiander, began its competitive existence on May 5, 1995, when it defeated the Vancouver Whitecaps in the first game of the newly renamed A-League. The Ruckus experienced a mid-season loss of form, but the addition of several new players, including Justin Fashanu, led to a resurgence. Atlanta made it to the championship series, only to lose to the Seattle Sounders in three games. After losing nearly $600,000 in 1995 and continuing to lose money in 1996, Imerman arranged for the league to take over team operations in June 1996. In August 1996, Vincent Lu purchased the franchise. In June 1998, the league suspended the team after Lu refused to sign a renewed franchise agreement with the league. The A-League continued to operate the team, now known as the A-League Atlanta. At the time Umbro had a promotional contract with the A-League and it contacted a local Atlanta law firm, Alston &amp; Bird, about the possibility of litigation against the league and Lu. However, this contact resulted in Alston &amp; Bird lawyer John Latham purchasing the team along with his friend Bobby Glustrom. In September 1998, Latham and Glustrom hired Mike Balson as general manager. Balson then hired 1996 USISL Coach of the Year Nuno Piteira as head coach.

===Atlanta Silverbacks FC (1998–2015)===
In a September 1998 press conference at Zoo Atlanta, the two partners also announced the team would be known as the Atlanta Silverbacks in honor of Willie B., a silverback gorilla who was a star attraction at the zoo. The team also moved to DeKalb Memorial Stadium for the 1999 season. From at least 1999 to at least 2001, the Silverbacks were affiliated with the Dallas Burn of Major League Soccer. In January 2000, David Cormack joined Latham and Glustrom as owners of the Silverbacks, but left in September to become the Chief Executive of Aberdeen F.C. In 2000, Atlanta and Tennessee Rhythm began an annual competition for the Willie B. Cup. Between 2000 and 2007, when the cup was discontinued, the Silverbacks won it four times. Despite the new ownership group, coach and stadium, the Silverbacks continued to struggle on the field. From 1996 through 2001, the team went through seven coaches and missed the playoffs six consecutive seasons. In 2002, the Silverbacks, under head coach Brett Mosen, made the playoffs and went to the third round of the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup. In 2003, Atlanta began another string of poor seasons, failing to make the playoffs for four seasons. Finally in 2007, for the first time since its inaugural season in 1995, Atlanta made it to the league championship, falling to the Seattle Sounders.

In November 2009, the Silverbacks announced their intent to leave the USL First Division to become the co-founders of a new North American Soccer League, which would begin play in 2010. The league, which at the time had yet to be sanctioned by the United States Soccer Federation or the Canadian Soccer Association, would also comprise the Carolina RailHawks, Crystal Palace Baltimore, Miami FC, Minnesota Thunder, Montreal Impact, FC Tampa Bay, Vancouver Whitecaps and a brand new team led by St. Louis Soccer United. However, the NASL was not sanctioned by the United States Soccer Federation and the Silverbacks did not play during the 2010 season. On November 20, 2010, the USSF sanctioned the NASL and the Atlanta Silverbacks immediately re-joined for the 2011 season.

On May 22, 2012, the Atlanta Silverbacks created controversy when they became the first team to sell the rights to host a 2012 U.S. Open Cup match to Seattle Sounders FC.

On July 2, 2012, the Silverbacks announced former United States men&#x27;s national soccer team star Eric Wynalda would take over as the club&#x27;s interim head coach and Director of Soccer, replacing Alex Pineda Chacón and Rodrigo Rios respectively. Wynalda appointed Brian Haynes as the team&#x27;s permanent head coach, while Wynalda remained on the Silverbacks&#x27; staff as technical director. Under the leadership of Haynes and Wynalda, the team enjoyed a remarkable turnaround and captured the 2013 NASL Spring season title, thus earning the right to host the 2013 Soccer Bowl, which the Silverbacks lost 1–0 to the New York Cosmos. Haynes posted a regular season record of 13 wins, 10 losses, and 10 draws and won the 2013 NASL Coach of the Year trophy, but team leadership ultimately decided not to retain him as head coach, citing poor results during the 2013 fall season.

At the 2014 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup, the Silverbacks defeated MLS teams Real Salt Lake and Colorado Rapids to reach quarterfinals, where they lost to Chicago Fire.

On December 2, 2014, the NASL licensed the Silverbacks name from Boris Jerkunica and Henry Hardin and continued to operate the team through the 2015 season. The league was not successful in finding new ownership, and the club ceased operations on January 11, 2016.

===Legacy===
The Silverbacks&#x27; reserve side in the amateur National Premier Soccer League adopted the Silverbacks name after the NASL club folded. Jerkunica maintained ownership of the name, and was part of the NPSL ownership group. In January 2019, the club announced that it had parted ways with Jerkunica, and consequently lost the right to use the Silverbacks name, choosing to be known as Atlanta SC.

==Colors and badge==
The Silverbacks official colors were red, black, silver, and white, and the club logo featured those four colors prominently. On January 23, 2013, a new logo was announced. The club&#x27;s name was inspired by Willie B., a gorilla who was a main attraction of Zoo Atlanta until his death in February 2000.

In September 2012, a poll was posted on the Silverbacks&#x27; official website relating to a potential rebrand. The options were: to retain the Silverbacks name, a rebrand to Atlanta Chiefs to recall the team from the original NASL or a third write-in option. The name Atlanta FC was later added to the poll after receiving a &quot;significant&quot; number of the write-in votes.

==Stadium==
* DeKalb Memorial Stadium; Clarkston, Georgia (2003–2005)
* Atlanta Silverbacks Park; Atlanta (2006–2015)

The Silverbacks played their home games at Atlanta Silverbacks Park, a 5,000-seat soccer-specific stadium built in 2006 for use specifically by the team. Prior to the 2006 season the Silverbacks played at various municipal stadiums in the Greater Atlanta area, most notably DeKalb Memorial Stadium in Clarkston.

<text>The Rentenmark (; RM) was a currency issued on 15 November 1923 to stop the hyperinflation of 1922 and 1923 in Weimar Germany, after the previously used Papiermark had become almost worthless. It was subdivided into 100 &quot;Rentenpfennig&quot; and was replaced in 1924 by the Reichsmark.

==History==
After the Occupation of the Ruhr in early 1923 by French and Belgian troops, referred to as the &quot;Ruhrkampf&quot;, the German government of Wilhelm Cuno reacted by announcing a policy of passive resistance. This caused the regional economy of the Ruhr, the industrial heartland of Germany, to almost stop. The occupation authorities reacted to strikes and sabotage with arrests and deportations. Those displaced and left without income by the &quot;Ruhrkampf&quot; and their families fell back on public income support. Tax revenues plunged as economic activity slowed. The government covered its need for funds mainly by printing money. As a result, inflation spiked and the Papiermark went into freefall on the currency market. Foreign currency reserves at the Reichsbank dwindled.

As hyperinflation took hold, the cabinet of Cuno resigned in August 1923 and was replaced by the cabinet of Gustav Stresemann. After Stresemann reshuffled his cabinet in early October, Hans Luther became Minister of Finance. Working with Hjalmar Schacht at the Reichsbank, Luther quickly came up with a stabilization plan for the currency which combined elements of a monetary reform by economist Karl Helfferich with ideas of Luther&#x27;s predecessor in office Rudolf Hilferding. With the help of the emergency law (&quot;Ermächtigungsgesetz&quot;) of 13 October 1923 which gave the government the power to issue decrees on financial and economic matters, the new Rentenbank was established that same day, 15 October 1923.

The newly created &quot;Rentenmark&quot; replaced the old &quot;Papiermark&quot; on 15 November. Because of the economic crisis in Germany after the First World War, there was no gold available to back the currency. Luther thus used Helfferich&#x27;s idea of a currency backed by real goods. The new currency was backed by the land used for agriculture and business. This was mortgaged (&quot;Rente&quot; is a technical term for mortgage in German) to the tune of 3.2 billion Goldmarks, based on the 1913 wealth charge called &quot;Wehrbeitrag&quot; which had helped fund the German war effort from 1914 to 1918. Notes worth RM 3.2 billion were issued. The Rentenmark was introduced at a rate of one Rentenmark to equal one trillion (1012) old marks, with an exchange rate of one United States dollar to equal 4.2 Rentenmarks.

The Act creating the Rentenmark backed the currency by means of twice yearly payments on property, due in April and October, payable for five years. Although the Rentenmark was not initially legal tender, it was accepted by the population and its value was relatively stable. The Act prohibited the recently privatised Reichsbank from continuing to discount bills and the inflation of the Papiermark immediately stopped. The monetary policy spearheaded by Schacht at the Reichsbank and the fiscal policy of Finance Minister Hans Luther brought the period of hyperinflation in Germany to an end. The &quot;Reichsmark&quot; became the new legal tender on 30 August 1924, equal in value to the Rentenmark. This marked a return to a gold-backed currency in connection with the implementation of the Dawes Plan. The Rentenbank continued to exist after 1924 and the notes and coins continued to circulate. The last Rentenmark notes were valid until 1948.

==Coins==

Coins were issued dated 1923, 1924 and 1925 in denominations of 1 Rpf, 2 Rpf, 5 Rpf, 10 Rpf and 50 Rpf. Only small numbers of Rentenpfennig coins were produced in 1925. A few 1 Rpf coins were struck dated 1929. The 1 Rpf and 2 Rpf were minted in bronze, with the 5 Rpf, 10 Rpf, and 50 Rpf coins in aluminium-bronze. These coins had the same design features and motifs as coins of the Reichsmark from the Weimar and early Third Reich periods.

==Banknotes==
The first issue of banknotes was dated 1 November 1923 and was in denominations of RM 1, RM 2, RM 5, RM 10, RM 50, RM 100, RM 500 and RM 1000. Later issues of notes were RM 10 and RM 50 (1925), RM 5 (1926), RM 50 (1934) and RM 1 and RM 2 (1937).

<doc id="1032092" wikidata="Q1807615" url="?curid=1032092" title="Republic XF-103">
<text>The Republic XF-103 was an American project to develop a powerful missile-armed interceptor aircraft capable of destroying Soviet bombers while flying at speeds as high as Mach 3. Despite a prolonged development, it never progressed past the mockup stage.

==Development==

In 1949, the USAF issued a request for an advanced supersonic interceptor to equip the Air Defense Command. Known formally as Weapon System WS-201A, but better known informally as the 1954 interceptor, it called for a supersonic aircraft with all-weather capability, powerful aircraft interception radar, and air-to-air missile armament. Republic was one of six companies to submit proposals. On 2 July 1951, three of the designs were selected for further development, Convair&#x27;s scaled-up XF-92 that evolved into the F-102, a Lockheed design that led to the F-104, and Republic&#x27;s AP-57. AP-57 was an advanced concept to be built almost entirely of titanium and capable of Mach 3 at altitudes of at least .

A full-scale mock-up of the AP-57 was built and inspected in March 1953. A contract for three prototypes followed in June 1954. Work on the prototypes was delayed by continued problems with the titanium construction, and more by continuing problems with the proposed Wright J67 engine. The contract was later reduced to a single prototype. In the end, the J67 never entered production and the aircraft it had been chosen for were forced to turn to other engine designs, or were cancelled outright. Republic suggested replacing the J67 with the Wright J65, a much less powerful engine. The project was eventually cancelled on 21 August 1957 with no flying prototypes ever being completed.

The design was given a brief reprieve as part of the Long-Range Interceptor – Experimental (LRI-X) project that ultimately led to the North American XF-108 Rapier. Part of this project was the development of the advanced Hughes AN/ASG-18 pulse-doppler radar and the GAR-9 missile. Republic proposed adapting the F-103 as a testbed for these systems with additional fuel tanks taking up much of the original weapon bay spaces, although it wouldn&#x27;t be able to come close to meeting the range requirements of LRI-X. Some work was carried out adapting the mockup to house the 40 inch antenna, which required the nose section to be scaled up considerably. Nothing ever came of the proposal, and testing of the ASG-18/GAR-9 was carried out on a modified Convair B-58 Hustler instead.

==Design==
===Propulsion===
Mach 3 performance in the 1950s was difficult to achieve. Jet engines compress incoming air, then mix it with fuel and ignite the mixture. The resulting expansion of gases produces thrust. The compressors generally can ingest air only at subsonic speeds. To operate supersonically, aircraft use advanced intakes to slow the supersonic air to a usable speed. The energy lost in this process heats the air, which means the engine has to operate at ever-higher temperatures to provide net thrust. The limiting factor in this process is the temperature of the materials in the engines, in particular, the turbine blades just behind the combustion chambers. Using materials available at the time, speeds much beyond Mach 2.5 were difficult to achieve.

The solution to this problem is the removal of the turbine. The ramjet engine consists mostly of a large tube, and is relatively easy to air-cool by forcing extra air around the engine. Experimental ramjet aircraft of the era, like the Lockheed X-7, were reaching speeds as high as Mach 4. There are numerous problems with the ramjet engine, however. Fuel economy, or thrust specific fuel consumption in aircraft terms, is extremely poor. This makes general operations like flying from one airbase to another expensive propositions. More problematic is the fact that ramjets rely on forward speed to compress the incoming air, and only become efficient above Mach 1.

Alexander Kartveli, Republic&#x27;s Chief Designer, devised a solution to these problems. He proposed using a Wright J67 turbojet (a license-built derivative of the Bristol Olympus) supplemented by an RJ55-W-1 ramjet behind it. Connecting the two were a series of movable ducts that could route air between the engines. At low speeds the aircraft would be powered by the J67, with the RJ55 acting as a traditional afterburner, producing a total of about 40,000 lbf (180 kN) thrust. At high speeds, starting above Mach 2.2, the jet engine would be shut down and the airflow from the intake would be routed around the jet engine and directly into the RJ55. Although the net thrust was reduced by shutting down the jet, operating on the ramjet alone allowed the aircraft to reach much higher speeds.

Both engines were located behind a single very large ventral Ferri-type intake, which used a prominent, swept-forward lip, a configuration also used for the wing-root inlets on the F-105 Thunderchief. The J67 was installed just behind the intake, angled with its intake below the centerline of the aircraft. The RJ55 was installed inline with the fuselage in the extreme rear, as if it were the exhaust of a conventional engine installation. There was a significant empty space above the J67 for ducting.

===Wings and control surfaces===
All of the control surfaces were pure delta wings. The main wing was swept at 55 degrees, and could be rotated around the spar to provide variable incidence. For takeoff and landing, the wing was tilted upwards to increase the angle of incidence while keeping the fuselage nearly horizontal. The length of the fuselage made it difficult to achieve the same end by tilting the entire aircraft upwards, which would have required a very long extension on the landing gear. The system also allowed the fuselage to fly flat to the airflow at various speeds, setting the angle of incidence independent of the aircraft as a whole. This decreased trim drag, thus improving range.

The wing was split at about two-thirds of the span. The portion outside of this line able to rotate independently of the rest of the wing. These movable portions acted as large ailerons, or as Republic called them, &quot;tiperons&quot;. To keep the surface area in front and behind the pivot point somewhat similar, the split line was closer to the fuselage in front of the pivot. Large conventional flaps ran from the fuselage to the tiperons. Hard points for drop tanks were available at about of the way out from the wing root.

The horizontal stabilizers were seemingly undersized, and mounted below the line of the wing. The larger vertical fin was supplemented by a ventral fin for high-speed stability. This fin folded to the right, as seen from behind, during takeoff and landing to avoid hitting the ground. Two petal-style air brakes were mounted directly behind the horizontal surfaces, opening out and up at about a 45° angle into the gap between the horizontal and vertical surfaces. A provision for a braking parachute is not evident on the mock-up or the various artwork, although this was common for aircraft of the era.

===Fuselage===
The fuselage was completely smooth, with a high fineness ratio for low drag at supersonic speeds. The design was developed prior to the discovery of the area rule, and does not display any of the wasp waisting common to aircraft primarily developed after 1952. The fuselage contours were mainly cylindrical, but blended into the intake starting around the wing root, giving it a rounded, rectangular profile through the middle, before reverting to a pure cylinder shape again at the engine nozzle.

===Cockpit===
The cockpit design originally featured a canopy, but low drag requirements for high speed suggested that it be removed. The idea of using a periscope arrangement for forward viewing on high speed aircraft was then in vogue, the Avro 730 selecting a very similar system. The Air Force demanded that it be used on the F-103. Kartveli was opposed to this layout, and continued to press for the use of a &quot;real&quot; canopy. Design documents throughout the program continued to include this as an optional feature, along with performance estimates that suggested the difference would be minimal.

The system shown on mockups used two large oval windows on the cockpit sides, and a periscope system projecting an image onto a Fresnel lens arrangement directly in front of the pilot. In 1955, the periscope concept was tested on a modified F-84G, which was flown on a long, cross-country flight with the pilot&#x27;s forward vision blocked.

A unique supersonic escape capsule was designed for the XF-103. The pilot&#x27;s seat was located in a shell with a large movable shield in front that was normally slid down into the area in front of the pilot&#x27;s legs. In the case of depressurization, the shield would slide up in front of the pilot, sealing the seat into a pressurized pod. Basic flight instruments inside the capsule allowed the aircraft to be flown back to base, and a window in the front of the shield allowed the periscope system to be used. In an emergency, the entire capsule would be ejected downward, along with a small portion of the aircraft fuselage that provided a stable aerodynamic shape. To enter and exit the aircraft, the ejection module was lowered on rails out of the bottom of the aircraft, allowing the pilot to simply walk into the seat, sit down, and raise the module into the aircraft. The capsule was fully pressurized, allowing the pilot to continue operating the aircraft without a pressure suit when the capsule was locked up.

===Avionics and armament===
The entire nose of the aircraft was taken up by the large Hughes radar set, which (at the time) offered long detection ranges. Guidance and fire control were to be provided by the same MX-1179 package being developed for all of the WS-201 designs. Hughes had won this contract with their Hughes MA-1 fire control system, which was under development. Weapons were carried in bays located on the sides of the fuselage behind the cockpit, which opened by flipping upward, thereby rotating the missiles out of their bays. It was to be armed with six GAR-1/GAR-3 Falcon (then known as MX-904), with a likely arrangement of three or four each GAR-1s and GAR-3s, fired in pairs (one each radar and infrared guided) to improve the odds of a hit. The XF-103 also was to feature 36 2.75-inch &quot;Mighty Mouse&quot; FFARs.

<doc id="1032098" wikidata="Q459517" url="?curid=1032098" title="Eupolis">
<text>Eupolis (; 446 411 BC) was an Athenian poet of the Old Comedy, who flourished during the time of the Peloponnesian War.

==Biography==
Very little is known about Eupolis&#x27; life. His father was named Sosipolis. There are few sources on when he first appeared on the stage. A short history of Greek Comedy, written by an anonymous writer of antiquity, reported that Eupolis first produced a play in the year when Apollodorus was the Eponymous archon, which would be 430/429 BC. The same source claims Phrynichus also had his debut that year. However, the Chronicon of Eusebius of Caesarea places Eupolis&#x27; debut in 428–27 BC and adds that Aristophanes also produced a play that year. This is the version preserved in the Latin translation by Jerome. But the Armenian translation places the event in 427/426 BC.

Cyril of Alexandria placed the debut of Eupolis at some point between 428 and 424 BC, and placed the debuts of Aristophanes and Plato the comic poet during that same period. George Syncellus gives the same dates, but merely states that Eupolis and Aristophanes were becoming prominent, not when they had their debuts. Syncellus also includes Sophocles. Sophocles had actually become the pre-eminent playwright in Athens 456 BC, around when Aeschylus died.

Based on the primary sources above, modern historians conclude that Eupolis had his debut as a playwright during the 420s BC, probably in 429 BC. His first production was probably at the Lenaia, the lesser theatrical festival of his time. The Lenaia are thought to have allowed novices to compete, so they could prove themselves before presenting plays at the Dionysia festival. His first known play was either &quot;Prospaltioi&quot; or &quot;Heilotes&quot;. Surviving fragments from the &quot;Prospaltioi&quot; include allusions to, and near-quotations of, Sophocles&#x27; &quot;Antigone&quot; (442 BC). Scholars are convinced the play targeted Pericles, due to a famous reference to Aspasia. This makes it likely that Pericles, who died in 429 BC, was still alive when Eupolis was working on the text.

The Suda claims Eupolis was only 17 years old when he started his career. (This would place his birth around 447/446 BC.) Sources also claim Aristophanes and Menander were adolescents (epheboi) at the start of their own careers. This suggests a tradition concerning the precociousness of poets.

Although he was at first on good terms with Aristophanes, their relationship subsequently became strained, and they accused each other, in most virulent terms, of imitation and plagiarism. In the parabasis of his play &quot;The Clouds&quot;, Aristophanes publicly accused Eupolis&#x27; play &quot;Maricas&quot; of being a copy of fellow comic Phrynichus and his own &quot;Knights&quot;:
Eupolis, indeed, first of all craftily introduced his &quot;Maricas&quot;, / having basely, base fellow, spoiled by altering my play of the &quot;Knights&quot;, / having added to it, for the sake of the cordax, a drunken old woman, whom / Phrynichus long ago poetized, whom the whale was for devouring. —(Chorus [leader], in &quot;The Clouds&quot;, line 553–556, transl. William James Hickie, 1871)

==Works==
Eupolis obtained first prize seven times, but only fragments remain of the 19 titles attributed to him. Of these, the best known are: 
* &quot;Kolakes&quot; (&quot;Flatterers&quot;), in which he pilloried the spendthrift Callias, who wasted his money on sophists and parasites. This play won first prize in the City Dionysia of 421 BC, defeating Aristophanes&#x27; &quot;Peace&quot;.
* &quot;Maricas&quot;, an attack on Hyperbolus, the successor of Cleon, under a fictitious name.
* &quot;Baptai&quot; (&quot;Dippers,&quot; Latinization: Baptae), against Alcibiades and his groups, at which profligate foreign rites were practised. The word &quot;Baptai&quot; was a name given to the priests of the Thracian goddess Cotytto.
* &quot;Demoi&quot; (&quot;Demes&quot;) and &quot;Poleis&quot; (&quot;Cities&quot;) were political plays, dealing with the desperate condition of the state and with the allied (or tributary) cities.

Other people he attacked in his plays were Socrates, Cimon, and Cleon. The following 14 titles (with associated fragments) are also ascribed to Eupolis:
Ian Storey estimates a total output of 14 or 15 works for Eupolis, noting the doubtful paternity of some of the works attributed to the poet. He considers his career to have lasted from 429 to 411 BC, a period of 18 years.

==Death and burial==
Ian Storey notes that there are &quot;four ancient traditions&quot; on the manner of death and burial of Eupolis, each with details impossible to reconcile to each other. The first tradition is &quot;the well-known story&quot; concerning Alcibiades. Eupolis targeted that politician in his play &quot;Baptai&quot;, but then found himself serving under Alcibiades in the Sicilian Expedition. Alcibiades retaliated by having the poet drowned on the way to Sicily. This would place Eupolis&#x27; death in &quot;the late spring or early summer&quot; of 415 BC. The story, with small variations, can be found in the writings of Juvenal, Aelius Aristides, Themistius, Platonios, John Tzetzes and the Anonymus Crameri. The latter two add two new details. First, that Eupolis made fun of Alcibiades&#x27; rhotacism. Second, that soldiers dunked the poet repeatedly in the sea, making it unclear if the poet drowned or survived the experience. The story was reported in several ancient sources, but it also had its detractors. Eratosthenes pointed out that there were works by Eupolis which were produced following the Sicilian Expedition. Cicero quoted Eratosthenes and considered him a reliable source on the matter.

The second tradition is recorded by Pausanias the geographer. He reported that Eupolis was buried away from Athens, his tomb being located in the vicinity of Sicyon and the river Asopus. Pausanias never explains the reason for a burial away from home. But it might point to Eupolis having a family connection with Sicyon. Storey notes that there was one Athenian family with known connections to this city: the Alcmaeonidae.

The third tradition is recorded by Claudius Aelianus. He first narrates a tale concerning Augeas, a Molossus dog owned by Eupolis, and how it protected the property of its master from a thief. He then mentions that Eupolis eventually died and was buried in Aegina. Augeas maintained a constant vigil and lamented over the grave of its master until passing away himself. The location was reportedly named &quot;Dog&#x27;s Lament&quot; (Ancient Greek: ) following that event. Modern scholars have pointed out that this account follows a familiar pattern in ancient literary biography of adding in a tale concerning a faithful dog and how its presence benefited its master (the said master invariably being the subject of the biography). Storey suggests that the story may have started as a tale mentioned in a comedy. Then later writers might have mistaken it for a historical account. He finds more intriguing the connection of Eupolis with Aegina. Verses 652–655 of &quot;The Acharnians&quot; imply that Aristophanes was also connected with this island.

The fourth tradition can be found in the Suda. It claims Eupolis was one of the casualties of the Peloponnesian War, dying &quot;in a shipwreck&quot; within the Hellespont (the Dardanelles). The source for the information is not given. Neither is the death associated with any particular naval battle. Storey notes that the death might be connected to any of three major battles in the region: the Battle of Cynossema (411 BC), the Battle of Arginusae (406 BC) or the Battle of Aegospotami (405 BC).

==Reputation==
Horace listed Eupolis, Cratinus, and Aristophanes (in that order) as the most prominent writers of Old Comedy, noting how they would &quot;single out&quot; the immoral in their comedies. Persius addressed his works to those inspired by &quot;bold Cratinus&quot;, &quot;angry Eupolis&quot;, and &quot;the grand old man&quot; (Aristophanes). The Saturnalia by Macrobius mentions: &quot;Everyone knows Eupolis, who must be considered among the elegant poets of Old Comedy.&quot;

Eupolis combined a lively and fertile imagination with sound practical judgement. He was reputed to equal Aristophanes in the elegance and purity of his diction, and Cratinus in his command of irony and sarcasm.

<text>Nehemiah Mayo Dyer (aka. N. Mayo Dyer; February 19, 1839 – January 27, 1910) was a rear admiral in United States Navy, who served during the American Civil War and Spanish–American War. He was one of the few individuals to have served in both the Battle of Mobile Bay during the Civil War and the Battle of Manila Bay during the Spanish–American War.

==Biography==
Nehemiah Mayo Dyer was born in Provincetown, Massachusetts, to Henry and Sally (Mayo) Dyer. He was educated in the public schools. He &quot;followed the sea&quot; from 1854 to 1859. He had mercantile employment from 1859 to 1861.

On June 30, 1864, Mayo, in command of the , forced blockade-running steamer &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; to run aground near Fort Morgan at Mobile Bay. Because the steamer was protected by the fort&#x27;s guns, Rear Admiral Farragut attempted at first to destroy her by long-range fire from the &quot;Metacomet&quot; and the USS &quot;Monongahela&quot;. When this proved unsuccessful, Farragut authorized his flag lieutenant, J. Crittenden Watson, to lead a boat expedition to burn &quot;Ivanhoe&quot;. Under the cover of darkness and the ready guns on board USS &quot;Metacomet&quot; and the USS &quot;Kennebec&quot;, Watson led four boats directly to the grounded steamer and fired her in two places shortly after midnight July 6.

Mayo was promoted to acting master for gallant service aboard USS &quot;Metacomet&quot; during the Battle of Mobile Bay, August 4–5, 1864. 

After the war, he joined the Massachusetts Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States and was assigned insignia number 8854.

==Post–Civil War career==
In April 1866, he was ordered to report to the Bureau of Navigation in Washington and remained there on special duty until May 1868. On March 12, 1868, he was promoted to lieutenant, and on August 27, joined the at Valparaiso, Chile. He was promoted to lieutenant-commander on December 28, 1868, and from September 1869, to March 1870, commanded the USS &quot;Cyane&quot; at Sitka, Alaska. He then joined the USS &quot;Pensacola&quot; at San Francisco, and was soon transferred to the USS &quot;Ossipee&quot;, with which he cruised to lower California and Mexico. He received a medal from the Massachusetts humane society for saving the life of a sailor by jumping overboard from the &quot;Ossipee&quot; during a gale in the Pacific Ocean. 

In September 1870, he was ordered to the South Pacific station and was sent home on August 22, 1871. In October 1871, he was assigned to the Charlestown Navy Yard. He took command of the dispatch boat at Norfolk, Virginia, on November 24, 1873, and on April 10, 1874, was transferred to the . In February 1876, he was ordered as executive officer of the USS &quot;New Hampshire&quot;, fitting out at Norfolk, to be the permanent flagship at Port Royal. A few months later he was assigned to equipment duty at the Charlestown Navy Yard, and in 1879 was transferred to the receiving ship USS &quot;Wabash&quot;. In 1881 he joined the USS &quot;Tennessee&quot;, in 1883 became lighthouse inspector, and in the same year was promoted to the rank of commander. He commanded the on the Asiatic station from 1887 to 1890. 

He then served at the Portsmouth Navy Yard from 1890 to 1893 and was on special duty from 1893 to 1894. He returned to the Boston Navy Yard from 1895 to 1896 and served as light-house inspector for the 1st District at Portland, Maine, from 1896 to 1897.

He was promoted to the rank of captain on July 13, 1897, and assigned to command the cruiser USS &quot;Philadelphia&quot; in the Pacific squadron. He was at Mare Island, California on August 31, 1897, when he was ordered to the command of the cruiser USS &quot;&quot;, with which ship he went to Honolulu and thence to Hong Kong, China where the &quot;Baltimore&quot; became part of the Asiatic Squadron under Commodore George Dewey.

He commanded the &quot;Baltimore&quot; at the Battle of Manila Bay on May 1, 1898. For eminent and conspicuous conduct in this battle he was advanced seven numbers in rank, which allowed him to be promoted sooner than he would have otherwise. For his service at Manila Bay, the Baltimore city council presented him an elaborate sword.

His final assignment was as second in command of the Boston Navy Yard, under Rear Admiral William T. Sampson, from February 1900. He reached the mandatory retirement age of 62 on February 19, 1901, and was retired in the rank of rear admiral in recognition of his service during the Civil War. 

In retirement, he served as chairman of the board of commissioners of the Massachusetts Nautical Training School (forerunner of the Massachusetts Maritime Academy) from 1903 to 1904.

Rear Admiral Dyer died in Melrose, Massachusetts, on January 27, 1910. He is buried in the Wyoming Cemetery in Melrose, Massachusetts.

Admiral Dyer was one of the very few individuals who served with Admiral Farragut at the Battle of Mobile Bay and also with Commodore Dewey at the Battle of Manila Bay.

<doc id="1032100" wikidata="Q833787" url="?curid=1032100" title="Grunewald Tower">
<text>The Grunewald Tower or is a historical tower in the Grunewald forest of southwestern Berlin, Germany, built in 1897-99 according to plans designed by Franz Heinrich Schwechten. The viewing platform offers a view over the Havel at a height of .

==Overview==
In 1897 Teltow, a rural district of the Province of Brandenburg, mandated the construction of a memorial tower to mark the 100th birthday of the German Emperor Wilhelm I (d. 1888). On June 9, 1899 the landmark was opened to the public as &quot;Kaiser-Wilhelm-Turm&quot; (), though the inscription on the eastern facade reads &quot;Koenig Wilhelm I zum Gedaechtniss&quot; (to King William I, in memory), as he was also king of Prussia. A second inscription, on the western facade, facing the Havel river, reads: &quot;Der Kreis Teltow baute mich 1897&quot; (The district of Teltow built me in 1897). 

Elizabeth of Wied, queen consort of Romania, visited the top of the tower in March 1916, during World War I. She was elderly and it took her over two and a half hours to make it to the top, from which she waved at a crowd of about 350 people below. Elizabeth, who was an accomplished writer and translator, died the following day.

In 1948, following World War II, the tower was renamed Grunewaldturm, after the surrounding forest, near the Havel River. A comprehensive renovation of the tower then took place in 1953. It was later closed in October 2007 due to significant structural damage to the staircase. The necessary renovation cost 1.5 million euros and lasted until Easter 2011, reopening on April 22.

Since the 1990s, the tower has also doubled as a cell tower.

== Architecture ==

The tower, built in Brick Gothic Revival style and designed by Franz Schwechten, stands high and is located on the high Karlsberg hill of the Teltow plateau on the eastern shore of the Havel. The building contains a domed memorial hall with a marble statue of Wilhelm I by sculptor Ludwig Manzel, and four iron reliefs depicting Albrecht von Roon, Helmuth von Moltke, Otto von Bismarck and Prince Frederick Charles of Prussia. The neo-Byzantine ceiling mosaics in the hall are early works by the church painter and mosaic artist August Oetken, executed by the company Puhl &amp; Wagner.

A decorative band, wraps around the tower. Inscriptions are on the east and west sides, with two coats of arms located above them. The coat of arms on the side facing the river shows the red Brandenburg eagle, while the one facing the forest has the black Prussian eagle.

204 steps lead to a platform offering a panoramic view over the Havelland region and the Grunewald forest. The building has a restaurant and a beer garden.

<text>Franca is a municipality in the state of São Paulo, Brazil. The city is located in the northeastern portion of the state, distant 401 km (249 mi) from the state capital São Paulo, and 676 km (420 mi) from Brasilia. It covers a total area of 605.679 km2 of which 86.92 km2 comprises the urban area. As of the 2022 Census, the city&#x27;s population was 352,537. 

It is recognized as the &quot;National Capital of Footwear&quot; and &quot;National Basketball Capital&quot; in Brazil, serving as the industrial and economic hub for a region of 19 municipalities, with a combined population of 672,053, between the states of São Paulo and Minas Gerais.

In 2018, the city was ranked as the fifth best place to live in Brazil, and in 2023, as the sixth safest medium sized city in the country. It has also maintained its position as one of the Brazilian cities with the best urban sanitation ratios.

Franca was founded as a parish in 1805, initially part of Mogi Mirim until 1824. Its city status was granted in 1856.

==History==

The history of Franca begins with the bandeiras of Bartolomeu Bueno da Silva (The Anhanguera) in the 18th century. 

During the opening of the route known as &quot;Caminho de Goiás&quot; (route to Goiás), new settlements were established along the route to serve as resting / stopping points for the entourages travelling along the way from São Paulo to Goiás, in search of gold. 

The settlement where the city is now located was formerly known as &quot;Pouso dos Bagres&quot; (stop of the catfishes).

In 1819, Franca was visited by French naturalist &quot;Auguste de Saint-Hilaire&quot; who dedicated the following message:

&quot;&quot;The village of Franca, where I landed, is pleasantly in the midst of vast pastures, in an uncovered region, sown by bushes and cut by deep valleys. This charming village occupies the center of a path of land, wide and rounded, on each side. bathed by a small stream. At the time of my voyage, there were only about fifty houses there, but the sites for the construction of a large number of them were already marked, and it was easy to see that Franca would not take long to acquire greatness.&quot;

The parish of Franca was founded on December 03, 1805, being part of the territory of &quot;Vila de Mogi Mirim&quot; until 1824, when it was emancipated by João VI and named &quot;Vila Franca do Imperador&quot; in honor of the &quot;Emperor Pedro I of Brazil&quot;. It received the status of city on April 24, 1856.

Around 1890, Franca was served by the &quot;Estrada de Ferro Mogiana&quot;, however, the railroad branch was deactivated after the construction of a new branch connecting Ribeirão Preto to Uberaba. Due to the expansion of coffee production between the XIX and XX centuries, many italian immigrants settled in Franca, and the first shoe factory emerged in the late 1920s.

Franca took part in the &quot;Constitutionalist Revolution of 1932&quot;, losing six residents who fought to death for São Paulo.

<text>The Leland River is a short river in the U.S. state of Michigan. Located in the unincorporated community of Leland, the river is long and connects Lake Leelanau with Lake Michigan, winding past historic Fishtown, a dam and two restaurants. The dam was built in 1854 and it raised the water level in the river and in Lake Leelanau as much as . As the dam prevents boat traffic, launches are provided on both sides.

<doc id="1032104" wikidata="Q1435950" url="?curid=1032104" title="Food Lion">
<text>Food Lion is an American regional supermarket chain headquartered in Salisbury, North Carolina, that operates over 1,000 supermarkets in 10 states: Delaware, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia. The chain employs over 82,000 people. It was founded in 1957 as Food Town, a single grocery store in Salisbury. It later expanded to many locations across North Carolina. It was independently operated until it was acquired by the Belgium-based conglomerate Delhaize Group in 1974. In 1983, the company changed its name and branding to Food Lion to allow it to expand into regions where &quot;Food Town&quot; was already in use by unrelated stores. Following further mergers and acquisitions, Food Lion, LLC is currently owned by Ahold Delhaize, established in the Netherlands. The mascot’s name has been Leo the Food Lion since January 17, 1997.

==History==
Food Lion was founded in 1957 in Salisbury, North Carolina, as Food Town by Wilson Smith, Ralph Ketner, and Brown Ketner. The Food Town chain was acquired by the Belgium-based Delhaize Group grocery company in 1974. Due to Ralph Ketner&#x27;s savvy business sense and ever-growing grocery store endeavors, initial investors of Ketner&#x27;s &#x27;Food-Town&#x27; virtually all became millionaires. At one point, after a large addition to his quickly growing chain of stores, Rowan County North Carolina was shown &#x27;per capita&#x27; to contain &#x27;the highest number of millionaires&#x27; in the United States (all attributed to those initial and early investments). His implementation of weekly (sales) flyers advertising the noticeably low-prices (as compared to other stores), in combination with literally &#x27;plastering&#x27; nearly every square inch of each storefront with neon colored hand-lettered signage proved extremely effective. In the store, every item in the weekly sales were &#x27;again&#x27; broadcast by custom, hand-lettered cardstock signage. The low-prices were very &#x27;real&#x27;. while the profit per item was minimal, the amount of products, meats, fresh fruits and vegetables more than made-up for the minimal profit-per-item on sales items. Ketner continually took advantage of supplier&#x27;s small price fluctuations and continually made volume deals. Furthermore, the convenience of offering non-grocery &amp; OTC items not usually found in grocery stores, allowed the corporation to make a healthy profit on those offerings.


The Food Lion name was adopted in 1983; as &#x27;Food Town&#x27; expanded into Virginia, the chain encountered several stores called Foodtown in the Richmond area. Expansion into Maryland would have been a bigger problem since about 100 independent, but affiliated, stores were called &quot;Food Town&quot;. Because Delhaize had a lion in its logo, &quot;Food Town&quot; asked to use it on product labels and new store signs. Ralph Ketner realized &quot;lion&quot; needed only two new letters and the movement of another in the chain&#x27;s signs. On December 12, 1982, Ketner announced the name change to &quot;Food Lion,&quot; and by the end of March 1983, all stores had been rebranded. The name change, while puzzling for American customers, made economic and historic sense, as Delhaize was once known as &quot;Delhaize Le Lion.&quot;

Throughout the 1980s, Food Lion expanded throughout the Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern United States. The company continued their expansion throughout the late 1980s, opening hundreds of stores in existing markets such as the Carolinas and the Virginias, and entering new markets such as Georgia and Maryland.

In the early 1990s, Food Lion stores appeared in new markets such as Delaware and southern Pennsylvania; Orlando, Florida; Oklahoma City and Tulsa, Oklahoma; Shreveport, Louisiana; Dallas/Fort Worth; and Houston, Texas. (Of these eight markets Food Lion penetrated in the 1990s, the only ones that still have stores are Delaware and parts of southern Pennsylvania, such as Hanover). During this time, the chain was the fastest-growing supermarket company in the U.S., as they opened over 100 new stores each year. In November 1992, a critical &quot;PrimeTime Live&quot; report that showed unsanitary handling of meat and seafood hurt the chain as they attempted to enter new markets in the Northeast and Southwest. (See ABC PrimeTime Live section, below.)

According to some industry sources, the new stores in Texas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma were already operating below sales projections. The small, lackluster Food Lion stores were beginning to compete with national retail leaders, such as Albertsons, Kroger, Tom Thumb, and Jewel-Osco, all of which were already well-respected in the Southwest and which operated larger stores with more features, but the effects of the devastating ABC report could not be denied, and sales and revenue plummeted. In the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex, widespread reports were given of stores sending half of their staff home early due to lack of business and of other stores with &quot;virtually zero meat sales&quot;. In the fiscal quarter that included the Thanksgiving holiday of 1992, Delhaize America reported company-wide same-store sales declines of 9.5%. As a result, Food Lion was forced to greatly scale back its expansion plans in Texas and Oklahoma, as well as delay, then cancel its planned entry into new markets in Missouri, Kansas, and Illinois.
In 1993, Food Lion agreed to pay $16.2 million to settle claims that they violated federal laws regulating unpaid overtime, minimum wage, and child labor, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. In the agreement, which at the time was the largest settlement ever from a private employer accused of violating the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), the grocery chain agreed to ensure that all employees would be well-informed about their rights. Additionally, the Labor Department said Food Lion top management provided assurances that no retaliatory action would be taken against employees who filed complaints about unpaid overtime or other potential FLSA violations. On January 7, 1994, Delhaize announced the first major round of store closings in what would become a yearly event. The stores to be closed included 47 of its brand-new stores in Texas and Oklahoma, as well as stores in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Virginia.

Throughout the mid-1990s, the company canceled leases for new stores and closed scores of its newly built outlets in recently established markets such as Dallas/Fort Worth, Houston, and Oklahoma City. Citing double-digit same-store sales declines for the quarter ending in September 1997, Delhaize announced that it was canceling its Midwest expansion, exiting all markets in Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana, and closing its 6-year-old distribution center in Roanoke, Texas. Struggling, Food Lion was forced to recede back to the East Coast, where it faced increasing competition from competitors with larger stores, better customer service, and more variety and amenities; these included regional winners such as Ingles, Harris Teeter, and Publix; newcomers such as specialty retailer Whole Foods Market; and expanding national chains such as Kroger, Target, and Wal-Mart.

Beginning in 2003, Food Lion became active in &quot;market renewals&quot; in which every year Food Lion picks certain cities in their operating area where they remodel stores and update the product offerings. That same year, Food Lion remodeled 68 stores in the Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina market, followed by 65 stores in the Charlotte area in 2004. In 2006, Food Lion advanced their market renewals program by using demographic and geographic data to figure out whether certain stores should be branded as Food Lion, Bloom, or Bottom Dollar. If the data supported that an already existing Food Lion was adequate for a certain community, the location would simply be remodeled. Should the data support otherwise, the Food Lion store would be remodeled and rebranded as either Bloom or Bottom Dollar. In early 2012, Food Lion closed 113 stores. These were in Georgia, North and South Carolina, Kentucky, and Tennessee as well as all the stores in Florida.

===New concept, mergers and acquisitions===

In late 2013, Food Lion introduced a new concept and decor at a store in Concord, North Carolina. The first official remodel began in late 2014 to 76 of their stores in the greater Wilmington and Greenville, North Carolina markets. In March 2015, plans were announced for remodeling of its 162 locations in the Raleigh, North Carolina, market. The Raleigh market remodels were expected to be completed in stores on a rolling basis between April and October 2015. In June 2015, it was announced that Food Lion&#x27;s parent company, the Delhaize Group, and Ahold would merge into Ahold Delhaize. This merger was completed in July 2016. In March 2016, the company announced that they would make a $215 million investment in its greater Charlotte-area stores and western NC stores. This included remodeling 142 stores, additional price investments, and investments in associates and the community through its &quot;Food Lion Feeds&quot; initiatives.
In July 2016, as part of the corporate merger between Delhaize and Ahold, Food Lion was required to divest 61 locations to a variety of competitors including Supervalu and Weis Markets in Delaware, Pennsylvania, Maryland, West Virginia, and Virginia to satisfy the Federal Trade Commission&#x27;s review of the two parent companies&#x27; merger. Later that year, Food Lion began remodeling 93 of their stores in the Piedmont Triad region. Remodeling in the Piedmont Triad was completed in the summer of 2017. Richmond, Virginia stores began getting the concepts implemented in 2017. On March 14, 2018, Supervalu announced that Food Lion was purchasing three Farm Fresh locations in Elizabeth City, North Carolina and Hampton and Virginia Beach, Virginia as part of a larger deal to close down the Farm Fresh brand. On April 27, 2018, Food Lion announced plans to acquire four BI-LO locations in Florence, Myrtle Beach, Surfside Beach, and Columbia, South Carolina. Furthermore, on June 3, 2020, Food Lion announced the purchase of 62 Southeastern Grocers stores in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. These stores have been rebranded to Food Lion between February and May 2021.

Food Lion stores can currently be found in Delaware, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia.

Food Lion&#x27;s sister chains include Giant-Carlisle, Giant-Landover, Hannaford Brothers, Martin&#x27;s Food Markets and Stop &amp; Shop.

Food Lion spent seven years attempting to establish a presence in Bangkok, Thailand, starting in 1997. Operated locally by Bel-Thai Supermarket Co, in 2004 it withdrew from the country, selling all branches to Tops Supermarkets.

===Environmental initiatives===
For 20 consecutive years, Food Lion has been named Energy Star Partner of the Year and has received the Sustained Excellence Award for 18 consecutive years for its sustainability efforts. In partnership with parent company Ahold Delhaize USA, Food Lion aims to commit to heightened sustainability efforts, which include greater food transparency by 2025; reducing food waste by 50% by 2030 via composting, recycling and animal feed; and a 50% reduction in carbon emissions from its operations and 15% reduction for its supply chains by 2030. Since 2000, Food Lion and Feeding America have partnered to reduce food waste by donating more than 300 million meals to Food Lion&#x27;s communities through their food rescue initiative. Retailers nationwide implement the food program within their local communities.

=== Promotions and deals ===
Every Wednesday Food Lion renews its deals and promotions in a weekly ad.

=== Brand partnerships ===
On October 6, 2021, Food Lion announced the release of Mountain Dew Uproar, a berry-kiwi flavored version of the drink, as a limited-time collaboration with PepsiCo. The product was created with the Leo the Food Lion mascot in mind, and was available exclusively at Food Lion Stores. Uproar was discontinued in July 2023.

==Former banners==
===Bloom===

Bloom was Food Lion&#x27;s upscale grocery model that opened on May 26, 2004.

As of December 2009, 65 Bloom stores were in North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland, and Virginia.

On March 14, 2011, Delhaize announced that all Bloom supermarkets in North and South Carolina would close or be converted to the Food Lion banner.

On January 11, 2012, Delhaize announced that the Bloom brand would be discontinued and that all Bloom supermarkets would either convert to Food Lion or permanently close.

===Bottom Dollar Food===
Bottom Dollar Food was Food Lion&#x27;s discount grocery model that focused on offering a limited selection of both national brands and private label products. These stores had no bakeries or delis and more items were packaged. Customers bought the bags used to sack their own groceries at Bottom Dollar Food. Stores also used alternative display and stocking techniques such as cut cases on shelves, and using pallets and dump bins to reduce costs. Food Lion opened the first Bottom Dollar Food model in High Point, North Carolina, on September 21, 2005.

As of December 2009, Bottom Dollar Food had 28 stores in North Carolina, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. In January 2012, Delhaize announced that it would close six Bottom Dollar stores and convert 22 others to Food Lion supermarkets as part of a restructuring. In August 2014, it was reported that Delhaize was putting the entire portfolio of Bottom Dollar Food locations up for sale. Ultimately Bottom Dollar Food was shuttered and the stores sold to Aldi in early 2015.

===Harveys Supermarket===

Harveys stores are mainly located in rural markets within the Deep South. In May 2013, all Harveys stores were sold to BI-LO LLC.

===Reid&#x27;s===
Reid&#x27;s was a small chain of stores located in various rural South Carolina communities. The chain&#x27;s history can trace back to 1972, when its namesake founder Reid Boylston opened his first store in Barnwell, South Carolina. Most of these stores were all formerly branded as Food Lion stores and continue to carry Food Lion branded goods and use the Food Lion infrastructure. In May 2013, Reid&#x27;s was sold along with its sister supermarket chains Harveys and Sweetbay to BI-LO LLC for $265 million. BI-LO subsequently retired the Reid&#x27;s name, rebranding the Reid&#x27;s stores as BI-LO.

==Store brand==
Delhaize America stores use common private brands called Home 360, Nature&#x27;s Promise, CHA-CHING, and Taste of Inspirations. Sister supermarkets Hannaford and Sweetbay were the last two stores to make the switch, doing so in 2010 and 2011. The move is designed to simplify the company&#x27;s store-brand products line. Food Lion stores have the My Essentials brand, as well as the Hannaford brand.
At the end of 2014, the My Essentials, as well as the Home 360 names, were retired and the more traditional Food Lion brand name was used as a replacement.

==Slogans==

* &quot;LFPINC (LFPISC or LFPIVA)&quot;: During the Food Town era, the slogan stood for &quot;Lowest Food Prices In North Carolina&quot;. Also, it was used in South Carolina, Virginia, and Georgia stores.
*&quot;6800 Low Prices&quot;: late 1970s–1985
* &quot;Extra Low Prices&quot;: 1985–2004
* &quot;Good Neighbors, Great Prices&quot;: 2004–2011
* &quot;Get Your Lion&#x27;s Share&quot;: 2011–2014
* &quot;Easy, fresh and affordable... You can count on Food Lion... Every day&quot;: 2014–2015
* &quot;Life&#x27;s Better with the Lion&quot;: 2015–2016
* &quot;How Refreshing&quot;: 2016–2019
* &quot;This is Our Home. That&#x27;s Our Food Lion&quot;: 2019–present

==Controversies==
===Union organizing===
During the late 1980s and early 1990s, the United Food and Commercial Workers Union Local 400 alleged that Food Lion had underpaid its workers and engaged in unfair labor practices for many years. Food Lion spokesman Michael Mozingo denied the allegations, stating that &quot;We don&#x27;t pay less. Our wages are comparable in every market we operate.&quot; In 1990, labor leaders in Virginia called for a boycott of Food Lion, accusing the chain of paying workers substandard wages and blocking attempts by store workers to unionize. In Belgium, labor organizers observed the American Labor Day as a statement of solidarity with Food Lion labor organizers.

===&quot;Primetime Live&quot; controversy===
In the 1990s, Food Lion gained a degree of notoriety when it was the subject of an ABC News investigation. ABC had received a tip about unsanitary practices at Food Lion. Two ABC reporters had posed as Food Lion employees, and witnessed the unsanitary practices at Food Lion. Much of what they had seen was videotaped with cameras hidden in wigs that they were wearing. The footage was then featured in a segment on the news magazine &quot;Primetime Live&quot;, in which Food Lion employees described unsanitary practices, which included bleaching discolored, expired pork with Clorox and repackaging expired meats with new expiration dates, and the use of nail polish remover to remove the expiration dates from dairy item packages.

The company responded by suing ABC for fraud, claiming that the ABC employees misrepresented themselves; for trespassing, because the ABC employees came on to Food Lion property without permission; and for breach of duty of loyalty, because the ABC employees videotaped nonpublic areas of the store and revealed internal company information. During the court battles between Food Lion and ABC, over 40 hours of unused footage were released that helped Food Lion&#x27;s case. In the unused footage, two undercover producers are seen trying to encourage violations of company policy; however, employees resisted and correctly followed sanitary practices.

Food Lion was awarded US$5.5 million by a jury in 1997. The award was later reduced by a judge to $316,000. The verdict was then largely overturned by the U.S. Court of Appeals Fourth Circuit in Richmond, Virginia. According to the court: even though ABC was wrong to do what they had done, Food Lion was not suing for defamation, but rather for tort as a way to get around the strict First Amendment standards for defamation. Food Lion did this because the company was not contesting the truth of anything ABC reported in the broadcast. However, the appellate court upheld the finding that the producers involved breached their duty of loyalty as employees to Food Lion, and had trespassed, awarding a nominal $2 fine.

===Religious discrimination===
In 2014, Food Lion was sued for religious discrimination by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission after a meat cutter at a Winston-Salem Food Lion was fired for declining to work on Sundays or Thursdays evenings. The meat cutter was a Jehovah&#x27;s Witness minister who was required to attend religious services and meetings on those days. The EEOC sought back pay and compensatory and punitive damages. Food Lion agreed to pay the worker $50,500.

<doc id="1032113" wikidata="Q903056" url="?curid=1032113" title="Portable Application Description">
<text>PAD or Portable Application Description is a machine-readable document format and specification designed by the Association of Software Professionals and introduced in 1998. The PAD specification is utilized by more than 6,000 software publishers of downloadable applications covering the Windows, OS X, and Linux operating systems. PAD is a worldwide registered trademark of the Association of Software Professionals and managed by the ASP PAD Committee.

PAD allows software authors to provide standardized product descriptions and specifications to online sources in a standard way, using a simple XML schema that allows webmasters and program librarians to automate new program listings and update existing listings in their catalog. PAD saves time for both authors and webmasters, while allowing the specification to support the latest changes to operating systems and hardware.

PAD files most commonly have .XML or .PAD file name extension. PAD uses a simplified XML syntax that does not use name/value pairs in tags. All tags are attribute-free. The official PAD specification uses unique tags. To extract the fields in the official specification, it is not necessary to descend through the tag path. If multiple languages are represented in a single PAD file, then correct parsing does require descending through the tag path because leaf tags are duplicated for each language supported.

Each field in the specification has a regular expression associated with it. The regular expression acts as a constraint on the field: if it matches, the field value is legal and if it fails to match, the field and the PAD file as a whole do not conform to specification. Only files where all fields in the file pass validation are properly called PAD files.

The most current specification, version 4.00, was announced on December 1, 2012, replacing the prior version, 3.11 which was previously announced on June 12, 2010.

==Update to V4.0==
The current version of PAD v4.0 was developed with the input and feedback of supporting members of the Association of Software Professionals, as it has been since 1998.

As part of the major upgrade to v4.0, ASP withdrew all its free tools while also formally requesting that all PAD editing, submission and related third-party software, be removed or eliminated. In place of these prior third party and freeware tools, a new web-based platform was developed for PAD Specification by AppVisor.com. AppVisor allowed publishers to upgrade their v3.1 PAD files to v4.0. 
However, the generated PAD file could not be exported, but only submitted directly to some directories. Submitting the XML Pad to websites cost $150 and approving the application/submission cost $36 per year. AppVisor.com has been inaccessible since March 2024.

ASP stopped accepting new members in mid-2020 and formally ceased operations on December 31, 2021. As of April 2024 AppVisor.com ceased operations too.

Some software download and directory sites (BrotherSoft.com, Softonic.com, CNET Download.com, Softpedia.com) accept the PAD v4.0 format in addition to the older formats.

<text>Lake Leelanau ( ) is a lake that is located in the Leelanau Peninsula of the U.S. state of Michigan. The lake is divided into two basins, usually referred to as &quot;North Lake Leelanau&quot; and &quot;South Lake Leelanau&quot;, which are divided by the Lake Leelanau Narrows in the community of Lake Leelanau. The entire lake covers about . The lake is drained by the Leland River, which flows to Lake Michigan in the community of Leland. 

Lake Leelanau is also occasionally referred to as Carp Lake.

==Location==
Lake Leelanau connects on the northwest to the Leland River, which runs for one mile (1.6 km) to Lake Michigan. Between North Lake Leelanau and South Lake Leelanau the water narrows for about a mile near the unincorporated community of Lake Leelanau. 
A bridge crosses the narrows on M-204. Just south of the bridge is Fountain Point, a historic and scenic landmark as well as a popular summer resort.

On the southern end, South Lake Leelanau ends in a marshy area fed by several small creeks, and the waters access the community of Cedar in Solon Township.

Lake Leelanau runs through the middle of the Leelanau Peninsula; it is about at its widest. The south lake includes , the north lake includes , and the lakes have a total shoreline of about . The south lake has an average depth of , and a maximum depth of ; the north lake has an average depth of and a maximum depth of .

==History==
Indigenous people who first inhabited the area called this land &quot;ke-ski-bi-ag,&quot; which means &quot;narrow body of water,&quot;.

Henry Rowe Schoolcraft, an Indigenous agent for the territory, was credited with formally naming the county, and was said to use &quot;Leelinau&quot; as a character in his writing. See Leelanau County for a more complete discussion of the etymology of the name.

Scholars have established, however, that &quot;Leelinau&quot; was first used as a pen name by Schoolcraft&#x27;s wife Jane Johnston Schoolcraft in writings for The Literary Voyager, a family magazine which she and her husband wrote together in the 1820s. Jane Johnston was of Ojibwa and Scots-Irish descent, and wrote in Ojibwe and English. While her writing was not published formally in her lifetime (except as Schoolcraft appropriated it under his own name), Jane Johnston Schoolcraft has been recognized as &quot;the first Native American literary writer, the first known Indian woman writer, the first known Indian poet, the first known poet to write poems in a Native American language, and the first known American Indian to write out traditional Indian stories.&quot; In 2008 Jane Johnston Schoolcraft was inducted into the Michigan Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

<doc id="1032121" wikidata="Q1231824" url="?curid=1032121" title="Viminacium">
<text>Viminacium (also &quot;Viminatium)&quot; was a major city, military camp, and the capital of the Roman province of Moesia (modern-day Serbia). Following the division of Moesia in 87, following Domitian&#x27;s Dacian War, it became the capital of Moesia Superior. As of 2018, only 3-4% of the site has been explored.

The site is located from the modern town of Kostolac in Eastern Serbia. The city dates back to the 1st century AD, and at its peak it is believed to have had 40,000 inhabitants, making it one of the biggest cities in the Balkans of that time. It lies on the Roman road &quot;Via Militaris&quot;. Viminacium was devastated by Huns in the 5th century, but was later rebuilt by Justinian. It was completely destroyed with the arrival of Slavs in the 6th century. Today, the archaeological site occupies a total of , and contains remains of temples, streets, squares, amphitheatres, palaces, hippodromes and Roman baths.

Viminacium holds the distinction of having the largest number of graves discovered in any Roman archaeological site. As of 2023, 16,000 graves have been discovered.

== History ==


The remains of Viminacium, the capital of the Roman province of Moesia Superior, are located in the territories of the villages of Stari Kostolac and Drmno, about 12 km from the town of Kostolac and about 90 miles southeast of modern Belgrade. Viminacium was one of the most important Roman cities and military camps in the period from the 1st to the 4th centuries. Its exceptional strategic importance was reflected in its roles both in the defense of the Limes Moesiae (northern border) of the Roman empire and, resulting from this, as a major communications and commercial hub. 

No less appealing to the Romans was its hinterland in the Mlava river valley, which is rich in ore and grains. In Roman times, the defenses of the town on the northern side directly faced on a southern branch of the Danube, and on the western side, the Mlava river – though later on, Viminacium spread onto the left bank of the Mlava. Thanks to the location, land and waterways, Viminacium represented one of those areas where the encounter of cultures between East and West was inevitable. Although the primary functions of its roads and other transport links were military and strategic, they also provided very lively traffic throughout antiquity, and certainly contributed to the way in which Viminacium became prosperous and an important trading and business center.

The town began as a military camp. A legion may have been stationed here as early as Augustus (27 BC–14 AD). In 33/34 AD a road was built, linking Viminacium and Ratiaria, in modern-day Bulgaria. Emperor Claudius (41–54 AD) garrisoned Viminacium, Oescus and Novae as camps for the Moesian legions.

The first legion attested at Viminacium was the Legio VII Claudia that came from Dalmatia in 52 AD. A nearby civilian settlement emerged from the military camp. 

In 117 AD, during the reign of Hadrian, it received city status. Hadrian visited Viminacium and organized hunting parties. In the camp itself some 6,000 soldiers were stationed, with around 30,000–40,000 people living nearby. In the earlier half of the 3rd century, the city was in full development, evidenced by the fact that at that time it acquired the status of a Roman colony, and the right to mint local money. It was here in 196 AD that Septimius Severus declared his son Caracalla as his successor and the next &quot;Caesar&quot;.

Emperor Trajan (98–117 AD) was headquartered here during the Dacian Wars between 101 and 106. It became a &quot;colonia&quot; with minting privilege in 239 AD, during the rule of Gordian III (238–244), and housed the Legion VII and Legion IV. Other Roman emperors who visited Viminacium include Philip the Arab, Trebonianus Gallus, Constantine the Great and Julian the Apostate.

The crypt in the mausoleum is believed to be the imperial tomb of the emperor Hostilian, who briefly ruled and died in 251. Hostilian was the son of the emperor Decius, who was killed in an ambush near the ancient city of Abrutus located in present-day Bulgaria. According to 5th-century Greek historian Zosimus, emperor Hostilian and his mother Herennia Etruscilla had come to Viminacium to supervise the organization of defense of the empire&#x27;s northern borders, but both died there due to the Plague of Cyprian which ravaged the empire in the 250s. Because of the far distance from Rome, and the fear of spreading the plague, his body was buried with all honors in Viminacium, rather than transported to Rome.

Viminacium was the provincial capital of Moesia Superior. In the late spring of 293–294, Diocletian journeyed through his realm, and he re-organized Viminacium as the capital of the new province of &quot;Moesia Superior Margensis&quot;. He registered that the people here wrote in Latin, as opposed to Greek in the southern provinces. Viminacium was the base camp of Legio VII &quot;Claudia&quot;, and hosted for some time the Legio IIII &quot;Flavia Felix&quot;. At the time, the city had an amphitheatre with capacity for 12,000 people.

In 382 the city was the meeting place between Theodosius and Gratian amidst the Gothic War. Per &quot;Notitia Dignitatum&quot;, Viminacium hosted the section of the Roman Danube fleet.

Viminacium was destroyed in 441 by Attila the Hun, but rebuilt by Justinian I (527–565). During Maurice&#x27;s Balkan campaigns in the late 6th century, Viminacium saw destruction by the Avars in 582 and a crushing defeat of Avar forces on the northern Danube bank in 599, which destroyed Avar reputation for invincibility. Despite its strategic position, and generally good conditions of living (wide streets, villas, multi-storey buildings, large and numerous public buildings (thermae, temples, amphitheater), river port), Viminacium was never repopulated.

== Location and excavation ==
Viminacium is located in &quot;Stari Kostolac&quot; (Old Kostolac) a Serbian town on the Danube river, east of Belgrade. The site spans 450 hectares. It is estimated that approximately 5% has been excavated.

Viminacium was the location of the first archaeological excavation in Serbia, which started in 1882, by Mihailo Valtrović, founder of archaeology in Serbia and the first professor of archeology at the college in Belgrade, but himself a non-professional archaeologist (he was an architect). The only help he received was from twelve prisoners for manual work, because the state did not have enough resources to provide him with a better work force.
His research was continued by Miloje Vasić, the first Serbian trained archaeologist, in the mid 1890s. Serbian Queen Draga Obrenović visited the site and donated 100 gold ducats for further excavations, which is considered the first donation in Serbia given to the exploration of the Antiquity. It has intensified in the last ten years in the area of the Roman city of the Roman legionary camps and cemeteries. Many studies suggest that the military camp at Viminacium had a rectangular plan, measuring , and that is not far from its western wall of civilian settlement in an area of approximately . The Legionary camp in Viminacium is now in an area of arable land, so that Viminacium is easily accessible to researchers, but unfortunately also to robbers.

Over 700 artefacts made of silver and gold have been uncovered in the tombs. The National Museum in Belgrade and Požarevac have a total of 40,000 items found in Viminacium. Among them are many objects that are rare and invaluable.

The tombstones and sarcophagi are often decorated with relief representations of scenes from mythology or daily life. We have found numerous grave masonry construction. Especially interesting are the frescoes of the 4th-century tombs. The frescos of young women have high artistic value as examples of Roman art. During the excavation, an amphitheater was discovered, which with its 12,000 seats was one of the largest in the Balkans.

One specific fresco of a young woman is labeled the jewel of Viminacium and the most beautiful fresco of the Late Antiquity. The fresco resembles somewhat a famous Mona Lisa and local archaeologists named it &quot;Divina&quot;. The woman is dressed in a gold-hemmed dress, indicating high social status. &quot;Divina&quot; is the centerpiece of the tomb and probably represents the woman who was buried in it.

Tomb No. 5517 has an unusual representation of the Heavenly Rider and the Christogram. In front of the rider there is a turquoise panther with wide open jaws. Behind the rider is a running dog, colored in dark red, with the dark blue contour. The trees are painted in the dark and light blue colors, in the manner of the Garden of Eden. Though purportedly depicting a hunting scene, it actually symbolically shows the transformation of paganism into Christianity. The rider is placed between a panther, which in Christian iconography depicts sin, cruelty, and the Antichrist, and a dog, which symbolizes justice, grace, peace, and truth. The Pagan is depicted in red color, climbing to the heaven, and then transform in the rider which is blue. It is estimated to be painted in the 3rd century.

Artisan shops with the furnaces for baking bricks were discovered, so as the thermae. Six pools were uncovered, which were decorated with the floral and animal motifs. It was a steambath, with hot air circulating between the colonnettes and warming the bricks below the floor slabs. Massage rooms occupied the central section of the thermae. Lanterns were discovered in the facility, pointing that the night bathing was possible. The water was conducted using the natural fall via an aqueduct. of aqueduct have been explored so far. The water was not naturally thermal, so it was heated. Floors and walls were luxuriously crafted, including the dressing rooms. Children were prohibited from entering. However, the water in the pools was not being changed and water chlorination was unknown at the time, so the thermae and the unhygienic public toilets were source of diseases.

=== Archeological site ===
* 1 million years old mammoth skeleton was uncovered in the Viminacium site in June 2009. A large specimen, over tall and weighing , it is one of some 20 complete mammoth skeletons discovered so far. It was named Vika, and is estimated to be 60 years old at the time of death. She was discovered at the depth of in the lignite mine. Remains of other mammoths have been excavated in the swampy Pleistocene layers. They are exhibited in the Viminacium&#x27;s Paleontology Park section.
* A remarkable find of a jade sculpture. The work shows the possibility of a workshop existent under the Roman era.

In 1980 the Sevso Treasure affair broke out, when Hungary, Yugoslavia and Lebanon contested the ownership over the silver objects hoard which appeared on the market. Yugoslav journalists began an investigation which lasted for years. It was discovered that numerous artifacts were smuggled and illegally sold outside of Yugoslavia. Though the Sevso Treasure itself was not from this site, Viminacium, due to the poor maintenance and low protection at the time, was specifically named as the find which &quot;enriched many foreign collections with the valuable artifacts, sold below their true value&quot;.

The chief manager of the Viminacium project, archaeologist Miomir Korać stated in April 2018 that only 3 to 4% of the site had been explored so far. Viminacium has been geophysically explored since the mid-1990s. Thanks to this, the existence of numerous objects was confirmed, but as of 2018 they were still not uncovered: hippodrome, forum, imperial palace, several temples, theater, etc.

There is evidence that from the 1st to the 3rd century a wide medical network existed in the camp as hospitals in the military camps were regulated by the law. Remains of the surgical instruments and equipment for the medication production were discovered (vessels, mortars). In one of such bowls, discovered in the office of an eye doctor in 1985, the pastilles survived and had an imprinted inscription which explained that the medication contains saffron extract. There were 8 instruments in the bronze box (tweezers, scalpels, needles, cataract needles, stone palette, glass balsamarium). The pastilles were kept in the arch-shaped cartridges, and themselves were round, flat and spindle. The instruments barely differ from the modern ones and based on that, and the composition of the medicaments, it is believed that the doctors were treating cataract and trachoma. This discovery is considered the most important medical-pharmaceutical find in Serbia and it shows that the science-based medicine and pharmacy developed before Galen, who is considered the father of scientific medicine. Additionally, there are only four other findings of the survived Roman medicaments in Europe (Lyon and Rheims in France, Morlungo locality at Padua in Italy, Cologne in Germany). Chemical examination of the medicines began in 2019 by the experts from the Sorbonne&#x27;s Laboratory for the Molecular and Structural Archaeology. After its completion, the lab will try to recreate two written medical recipes discovered in Viminacium: &quot;collyria crocodes&quot; and &quot;collyria stactum&quot;. Additionally, there is also evidence of trepanation, surgical procedure of skull opening.

* In June 2012, excavation revealed a gladiator arena with many wild animals remains – those of a bear and of a camel. The skeleton of a bear dates from the 2nd century AD when many competitive games were held in amphitheatre. The bear almost certainly died during a spectacle, either fighting with another animal or with a man. A camel died about a century after. Only foundations remained of the amphitheatre, but the sitting tiers have been partially reconstructed. Gladiator shows were held often, though gladiators were fed with large quantities of grain porridge and were obese, &quot;nothing like Russell Crowe in &quot;Gladiator&quot;&quot;.
* On 21 June 2012 archaeologists discovered Roman graveyard from 2nd and 3rd centuries AD with extremely valuable pieces of fine jewelry as well as oil lamps which served to illuminate the way to the other world for the deceased ones. Not far from this necropolis, an &quot;industrial complex&quot; was discovered with remains of enormous furnaces whose purpose is yet to be determined.
* In 2012 a figurine of female deity, 4,000 years old, was discovered.
* In 2013 an altar dedicated to the nymphs was uncovered.
* On 19 April 2018 the discovery of a mausoleum was announced. It was built in the 3rd century and was a resting place of someone very important. It is located on the northern necropolis, north of Hostilian&#x27;s mausoleum. The stone sculptures and ornaments discovered in it were described as &quot;remarkable&quot;. They include head of a Roman emperor, a young man holding a sword and parts of another sword, so as fragments of the eagle wings. The mausoleum covers an area of , while the central room is . It probably had a ritual use and from 3 sides is encircled with 11 graves. One grave is of the cremated deceased in the grave pit, two are wooden grave vaults, one is made of bricks with an arch and the rest are made of the plain brick. Most of the graves were looted. The object is made of large slabs of crushed crystal shale, with four layers of hydraulic plaster thick. When built, the mausoleum was already dug into the ground. It was destroyed twice. First time in the Antiquity when it was thoroughly destroyed, probably as part of the &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot;. In later periods damage occurred mostly as the building material was being taken away for reuse. In this period most of the damages happened on the fence wall which was made of massive cuboid-shaped slabs. Excavations continue in the northern section where the entrance should be located. Across the mausoleum another arched grave site is also being explored.
* On 31 May 2018 report on two sarcophagi was published. They were intact, containing two skeletons and were full of gold and silver. One skeleton is of a tall, middle-aged man in his 50s, with a silver belt buckle and remnants of shoes next to him. The other skeleton is of a slim, younger woman, in her 20s. Next to her three fine glass bottles holding perfumes were discovered, so as a silver mirror. Body itself was decorated with the golden earrings, several expensive hair pins and a necklace. All of this points to the members of a higher class. They were both placed in one sarcophagus, holding each other, while an urn was placed in the other sarcophagus. The man was tall, while a woman had . The condition of the male skeletons shows that he wasn&#x27;t doing any hard, physical work. Female gown was apparently gold-woven, with embedded beads made of pearl, gold and glass and small golden rings with gemstones. She also had a unique waist silver kit. Two hair pins were made of bone and two of jet, while the mirror has a handle in the shape of Hercules knot. Golden engagement ring with the inscription SIMP, which is presumed to be the initials of the fiancé, is also found.
* In February 2019 a discovery of the well preserved grave was announced. The person was tall and the objects found in the grave include a long two-bladed sword with bronze hilt, in the, still noticeable, wooden scabbard, large bone comb beneath the left shoulder in the case also made of bones and the iron-made belt across the pelvis. The grave was dated to the period of the Great Migration and, based on the artifacts, it was concluded that the person was member of the Germanic Gepid tribe, which populated the area in the 6th century. So far, 106 Gepid graves were found scattered through Viminicaium, but not in this area so the excavations continued to determine is it an isolated burial site or part of the necropolis. Out of 106, 31 Gepid people had characteristic deformation of the skull, a custom they took from the Huns.
* A large and well preserved war ship was found in March 2020 and it is announced that it will become a part of permanent archaeological exhibit. Later in the summer, several lead sarcophagi from the 2nd to the 4th century were discovered, which are rarely found. One contained silver parchment with inscription in Ancient Greek.
* Principium of the Roman castrum (at least in total) along with a number of Roman coins and other artifacts was found in November 2020. The Principium was the main headquarters of the Legio VII Claudia. The massive object, which covers and has 40 rooms, hosted offices, armories, shrine, vault, basilica, and room for keeping military flags and insignia. Central section is an inner yard with peristyle. Water storage and fountain are also within the complex, which is from all sides surrounded by the colonnades. Strong walls point to the existence of upper floors. Interior remains show paving of the floor with decorative tiles (glass hour or butterfly ornaments), while the walls were decorated with red and white patterns, floral motifs, inscriptions and bordures. In the vault the denarius and antoninianus coins were found, mostly depicting the 3rd century emperors Gallienus, Claudius Gothicus and Aurelian.

=== Viminacium port ===

According to the Roman document &quot;Notitia Dignitatum&quot;, part of the Roman Danube fleet was anchored at Viminacium. As the locality is not situated on any modern watercourse, either the Danube was flowing further to the south than it does today, or some large arm was separating from the main flow in this direction, leaving the modern fossil riverbed which yields numerous navy artifacts. In 2019, at the old mouth of the Mlava into the Danube (today Drmno coal surface mine) a large iron anchor was discovered, but was stolen the same night it was dug it up. In February 2020, a hewn boat (monoxyl) was found at the same locality.

Just a month later, the discovery of the buried ship in the same former riverbed was announced. It was located west of the previous discovery. The ship was discovered at the depth of . It was partially embedded into the sand, alluvial sediment of the river, and partially into the marshy clay sediment, when the river changed its course and the remaining oxbow lake turned into the swamp. Layers above the ship were also mixed, including loess brought by the wind, and solidified mud from frequent flooding.

It was excavated, and partially damaged, by the large excavator, when the planks were spotted in its bucket. The ship is extremely well preserved thanks to the specific conditions and high moisture. It is the flatbed ship, built for the shallow waters. The casing for the mast of the auxiliary sail also survived, so as the rudder, stern and the square rowlock for the stern oar. Preserved part of the ship is long, but it is estimated that the entire ship was long and wide. It was definitely a war ship as it has remains of the &quot;rostrum&quot;. Two monoxyls were discovered next to it.

Exact dating will be conducted applying the C4 carbon fixation technique. The geologist will survey the dug to establish the timeline when the river was flowing through here. Though suggested that the ship may be even prehistoric, everything points to the Roman type of ship (Roman, Byzantine, early medieval). The ship is the only such find in Serbia. It will be fully reconstructed, including the missing parts, and exhibited with two monoxyls.

In April 2021, discovery of other vessels was announced. They were discovered in the former arm of the Danube, buried deep into the clay sediments, which indicated a period older than Viminacium&#x27;s golden age. The largest ship is long, and the total of seven vessels was discovered, in various shapes and sizes. Some pottery was found, too. Carbon dating showed that the oldest ships were from the 1st century B.C., while some originate from the 15th and 17th century. They were all made of oak, and the iron cramps used to bind the wood survived. The recent ship discoveries point to the former, apparently abundant, oak forests in the area, and over a millennium old, previously unrecorded, shipbuilding tradition which both predated and survived Viminacium.

Even larger ship, estimated to be over long, was dredged by an excavator in the Danube&#x27;s fossil riverbed in July 2023. It was located in the sand silt. at the depth of . It was partially damaged by the excavator, but the remains were in excellent condition. With growing number of discovered vessels, the construction of the Museum of Ships within the complex began.

=== Domus scientiarum Viminacium ===

Domus scientiarum Viminacium is a new scientific, research and tourist center built on the edge of the Archaeological park. The Domus was constructed in the manner of a Roman villa, with rooms and laboratories grouped around several atria. The Domus hosts an archaeological museum, a scientific library, laboratories for processing archaeological finds, an information center, conference rooms, a restaurant with dining hall and SPA center in the form of a Roman bath. There are also bedrooms available for researchers, students and visitors. One of the most spectacular features is a large conference room decorated by a Serbian mosaicist who installed mosaics based on Late Antique style.

The bedrooms are styled after the Roman military barracks and have six beds in one room. The complex became an archaeological congressional center, labeled the &quot;congressional (military) camp&quot; which includes the central plaza, two debating halls and the large dining room patterned after the Roman military mess halls. When not used for the scientific gatherings, the part of the complex adapts into the &quot;Roman children camp&quot;, with the adjoining adventure park partially made after the Roman training grounds for the legionaries. Some of the experiments include attempts to recreate other practices done in the &quot;Roman way&quot;, like cremations or planting grapevines. The Limes Park, a recreated Roman training ground was finished in September 2018 while the adjoining adventure park was open in December 2018. It covers an area of and consists of 48 attractions.

In 2017 Viminacium had 100,000 visitors, the largest number of tourists in its history. Of that number, 17,000 came via boats as the pier for the tourists have been constructed. The international passenger port &quot;Kostolac&quot; is under construction in the nearby town, and should be finished by the late 2021 or early 2022. In July 2021, the Archaeological Park Viminacium was given the administration over the port. The port became operational on 1 April 2022.

Since 2018, an annual theatrical festival &quot;Viminacijum Fest&quot; is being held in Kostolac and Viminacium Archaeological Park.

== Inhabitants ==

It is estimated that the city had 40,000 inhabitants at its peak. Human remains show mixture of different people. Facial reconstruction has been performed on several skulls for the purpose of the 2018 exhibition &quot;Roman Limes and cities in Serbia&quot; in the gallery of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts prepared by the archaeologist and forensic anthropologist Ilija Mikić. Remains show that the population belonged to the various types, like the Mediterranean, but also the unusual for this region like Nordics or an East African. Some of this different faces were reconstructed.

Other important findings include the skulls with the full sets of teeth or the elongated skulls. Though immediately labeled &quot;alien&quot; by the public, they are actually product of the special technics for the artificial cranial deformation, which would start with the tying up of children&#x27;s heads. The elongation was deemed very beautiful and desirable. Mikić also stated that, based on the numerous skeletons, the average life span in Viminacium was 35 years, while the average height was for men and for women.

== Ecclesiastical history ==
As provincial capital of Moesia Prima, Viminacium also became a Metropolitan archbishopric, presumably from about 300 to circa 400.

The Serbian Orthodox Eparchy of Braničevo is considered the successor of both Viminacium and Horreum Margi.

<text>Edward Richard Buxton Shanks (11 June 1892 – 4 May 1953) was an English writer, known as a war poet of World War I, then as an academic and journalist, and literary critic and biographer. He also wrote some science fiction.

He was born in London, and educated at Merchant Taylors&#x27; School and Trinity College, Cambridge. He passed his B.A. in history in 1913. He was editor of &quot;Granta&quot; from 1912 to 1913. He served in World War I with the British Army in France, but was invalided out in 1915, and did administrative work until war&#x27;s end.

He was later a literary reviewer, working for the &quot;London Mercury&quot; (1919–22) and for a short while a lecturer at the University of Liverpool (1926). He was the chief leader-writer for the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; from 1928 to 1935.

&quot;The People of the Ruins&quot; (1920) was a science-fiction novel in which a man wakes after being put into suspended animation in 1924, to discover a devastated Britain 150 years in the future. &quot;The People of the Ruins&quot; has an anti-communist subtext (the future 1924 is devastated by Marxist revolutionaries).

<text>Desenzano del Garda () is a town and &quot;comune&quot; in the province of Brescia, in Lombardy, Italy, on the southwestern shore of Lake Garda. It borders the communes of Castiglione delle Stiviere, Lonato, Padenghe sul Garda, and Sirmione.

==History==
The area was settled in the Bronze Age and sometime in the first century BCE, the area around Lake Garda, including what is now Desenzano del Garda, became a favourite vacation spot for the Veronese élite, Verona being one of the largest Roman cities in northeastern Italy. 

The toponym Desenzano is supposed to derive from the Latin name of persona Decentius, the alleged owner of the fourth-century Roman farm and villa of which the excavations can be visited. There is also an etymology of popular origin: since the village stretches along the hilly slope, the toponym is connected with the word &#x27;descent&#x27;.

The Villa Romana is one of the most important Roman villas in the north of Italy, covering an area of 11,000 square metres. Built in the first century BCE it was occupied through to the fifth century. Discovered in the 1920’s it is believed that the final stage was built by Flavius Magnus Decentius, brother of Emperor Magnentius.

The Castello was built around 1000 CE to protect the populace from raids by bandits and incursions by Hungarians. The fortifications follow the old Roman ‘castrum’ layout and was enlarged in 15th century.

When the Venetians controlled this part of Italy they rebuilt the Old Port in 1454 to make Desenzano a commercial hub for the wider area with such localities as Brescia, Mantova and Verona.

The baroque cathedral, dedicated to St Mary Magdalene, was designed by Giulio Todeschini and built on the remains of the parish church between 1586 and 1611. 

On 24 June 1859, four divisions of Sardinian infantry fought a gruesome battle with elements of the Austrian Eighth corps, under Feldzeugmeister Ludwig von Benedek, in an engagement encompassing Madonna della Scoperta, Pozzolengo, and San Martino (as Desenzano del Garda was known). This action was part of the greater battle centered on Solferino, during the Second Italian War of Independence, and was a vital step in achieving Italian unification – unification that was gained only eleven years later. During the Third Italian War of Independence, Desenzano was bombarded by the Austrian navy.

==Notable residents==
The Italian poet and librettist Angelo Anelli, who collaborated with Rossini in revising &quot;L&#x27;italiana in Algeri&quot; (&quot;The Italian Girl in Algiers&quot;) from an earlier text by Luigi Mosca, and whose libretto for &quot;Ser Marcantonio&quot; by Stefano Pavesi became the basis for Donizetti’s &quot;Don Pasquale&quot;, was born in Desenzano del Garda in 1761. 

Olympic gold medalist, sprinter Marcell Jacobs grew up in Desenzano del Garda. Italian cyclist Sonny Colbrelli and Italian volleyball player Alessandro Michieletto were also born in the town.

==Main sights==

* The Cathedral of St Mary Magdalene
* The House of St Angela Merici
* The Tower of St Martin (&quot;Torre di San Martino&quot;)
* The Museum of Archaeology (&quot;Museo Civico Archeologico&quot;)
* Old Port (&quot;Porto Vecchio&quot;)
* Roman Villa Densenzano (&quot;La Villa Romana&quot;)
* The Castle (&quot;Castello di Densenzano&quot;)

==Tourism==

The city is a holiday destination in Southern Europe. It attracts tourists from the immediate area owing to its views of the Alps from the southern shore of Lake Garda, its three large beaches (Desenzanino Beach, Spiagga d&#x27;Oro, and Porto Rivoltella Beach), and its 27 major hotels.

Desenzano is the heart of nightlife on the southern shore of Lake Garda, with several discos and pubs. In the summer, its main squares, Piazza Malvezzi and Piazza Matteotti, are crowded with people.

At the center of the city are a series of interconnected piazze that house open-air cafés, shops, gelaterie (ice-cream parlours), and bars.

==Transport==

The city has a main port near the Piazza Giacomo Matteotti, from where several ferries operate. On the south-western outskirts of the city is a large railway station, the Desenzano del Garda-Sirmione railway station (Stazione Ferroviaria), which connects the city to the European railway system. Desenzano also has its own exit from the A4 motorway, the main road between Milan and Venice.

==World Heritage Site==
It is home to one or more prehistoric pile-dwelling (or stilt house) settlements, which are part of the Prehistoric Pile dwellings around the Alps UNESCO World Heritage Site.

==Municipal government==
Desenzano is headed by a mayor (&#x27;) assisted by a legislative body, the &#x27;, and an executive body, the &#x27;. Since 1994 the mayor and members of the &#x27; are directly elected together by resident citizens, while from 1946 to 1994 the mayor was chosen by the legislative body. The &#x27; is chaired by the mayor, who appoints others members, called &#x27;. The offices of the &#x27; are housed in a building usually called the &#x27; or &quot;&quot;.

Since 1994 the mayor of Desenzano is directly elected by citizens, originally every four, then every five years. The current mayor is Guido Malinverno (FI), elected on 26 June 2017.

<text>See You Next Wednesday is a recurring gag in most of the films directed by John Landis, usually referring to a fictional film that is rarely seen and never in its entirety. Each instance of &quot;See You Next Wednesday&quot; in Landis&#x27;s films seems to be a completely different film.

Landis got the title &quot;See You Next Wednesday&quot; from the 1968 film &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;. It is the last line spoken by Frank Poole&#x27;s father during Poole&#x27;s video letter from his parents.

==References in Landis&#x27;s works==

* In Landis&#x27;s first film, &quot;Schlock&quot; (1973), &quot;See You Next Wednesday&quot; is mentioned twice and is also shown as a poster. Brief casting and plot descriptions are given each time that it is mentioned, making it clear that this is in fact two different films, both titled &quot;See You Next Wednesday.&quot;

* In the sketch comedy film &quot;The Kentucky Fried Movie&quot; (1977), the film is a melodrama presented in &quot;Feel-Around,&quot; a technique where an usher stands behind each movie patron and does things to them as they occur in the film, enhancing the movie-going experience, at least until the scene where the woman puts a knife to the man&#x27;s throat.

* In &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot; (1980), &quot;See You Next Wednesday&quot; is glimpsed on a billboard which also features a huge gorilla. It also appears on the cinema sign behind where the Nazi Pinto crashes through the road. It also says under the title on the marquee &quot;Starring Donald Sutherland&quot;. Since Sutherland took $50,000 cash for his role in the Landis film &quot;Animal House&quot; instead of the offered 15%, he missed out on millions when the film became a huge hit. The film is directed by the fictional Carl La Fong, a reference to the W. C. Fields comedy &quot;It&#x27;s a Gift&quot; (1934) and a character name that Landis has used as an anonymous credit on some of his other films.

* In &quot;An American Werewolf in London&quot; (1981), &quot;See You Next Wednesday&quot; is a porn film being shown in a seedy London pornographic theater. Advertised as &quot;A Non-Stop Orgy&quot;, scenes from the movie are actually shown as the characters talk in the theater. A poster of &quot;See You Next Wednesday&quot; can also be seen on the wall in the Tube station.

* In &quot;Trading Places&quot; (1983), a poster for &quot;See You Next Wednesday&quot; is glimpsed in Ophelia&#x27;s (Jamie Lee Curtis) apartment. On this poster it is directed by William Wyler and stars Laurence Olivier, Merle Oberon and David Niven (the real director and stars of the 1939 version of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;). The poster features the quote &quot;L&#x27;un des 10 meilleurs Films du Monde&quot; (&quot;One of the 10 Best Movies in the World&quot;).

* At the end of &quot;Coming Soon&quot; (1982) there is a series of clips from recent Universal Studios film trailers with the final being watercolor poster art for &quot;See You Next Wednesday&quot;, followed by Jamie Lee Curtis giggling at the inside joke.

* In the Michael Jackson music video &quot;Thriller&quot; (1983), the phrase is spoken by a deputy in the werewolf film that Michael and his girlfriend are watching. It is also visible as a poster on the outside of the cinema as they leave.

* In the &quot;Time Out&quot; segment in &quot;Twilight Zone: The Movie&quot; (1983), an SS officer says &quot;see you next Wednesday&quot; in German.

* In &quot;Spies Like Us&quot; (1985), a U.S. Army recruiting poster can be seen behind Colonel Rhumbus (Bernie Casey) right after the vertical impact simulation scene that says &quot;The army can teach you a skill. See You Next Wednesday.&quot;

* In &quot;Into the Night&quot; (1985), posters for the movie are shown.

* In &quot;Coming to America&quot; (1988), a poster for &quot;See You Next Wednesday&quot; is shown on a New York City Subway station. It stars Dan Aykroyd, Sybil Danning, Jamie Lee Curtis, Moe Howard, James Brown, and Kara Young.

* In the first episode of the 1990 TV series &quot;Dream On&quot; (which Landis directed), Martin (Brian Benben) says to his maid (Marianne Muellerleile), &quot;See you next Thursday&quot;. She corrects him saying, &quot;Wednesday&quot;.

* In the music video &quot;Black or White&quot; (1991), Michael Jackson throws a garbage can through the window of &quot;See You Next Wednesday Storage Co.&quot;

* In &quot;Innocent Blood&quot; (1992), &quot;See You Next Wednesday&quot; is shown on a marquee.

* In &quot;The Stupids&quot; (1996), the phrase is seen on the back of the bus to which the kids chain their bikes.

* In the &quot;Masters of Horror&quot; episode &quot;Family&quot; (2006), the phrase is spoken by a cartoon character on TV.

* In the &quot;Video Pirates&quot; segment of &quot;Amazon Women on the Moon&quot; (1987), pirates find a treasure chest filled with golden video cassettes; among the numerous in-jokes visible on the tapes, one of the cassette cases is labeled &quot;See You Next Wednesday&quot; (while Landis directed several segments of the film, the &quot;Video Pirates&quot; segment was directed by frequent Landis collaborator Robert K. Weiss). The movie poster of the &quot;An American Werewolf in London&quot; version of SYNW (the Non-Stop Orgy) is in the Tower Records store in the last sketch of the movie.

<doc id="1032150" wikidata="Q7351163" url="?curid=1032150" title="Robert Wilson Lynd">
<text>Robert Wilson Lynd (; 20 April 1879 – 6 October 1949) was an Irish writer, editor of poetry, urbane literary essayist, socialist and Irish nationalist.

==Early life==
Lynd was born at 3 Brookhill Avenue in Cliftonville, Belfast to Robert John Lynd, a Presbyterian minister, and Sarah Rentoul Lynd, the second of seven children. Lynd&#x27;s paternal great-grandfather emigrated from Scotland to Ireland.

Lynd was educated at Royal Belfast Academical Institution, where he befriended James Winder Good and Paul Henry, and studied at Queen&#x27;s University. His father served a term as Presbyterian Church Moderator as one of a long line of Presbyterian clergy in the family. A 2003 essayist on Lynd recounts that his &quot;maternal grandfather, great-grandfather and great-great-grandfather had all been Presbyterian clergymen.&quot;

==Literary career==
Lynd began as a journalist, with James Winder Good, on &quot;The Northern Whig&quot; in Belfast. He moved to London in 1901, via Manchester, sharing accommodation with Paul Henry who was establishing himself as an artist. Firstly he wrote drama criticism, for &quot;Today&quot;, edited by Jerome K. Jerome. He also wrote for the &quot;Daily News&quot; (later the &quot;News Chronicle&quot;), being its literary editor 1912–47.

The Lynds were literary hosts, in the group including J. B. Priestley. They were on good terms also with Hugh Walpole. Priestley, Walpole and Sylvia Lynd were founding committee members of the Book Society. Irish guests included James Joyce and James Stephens. On one occasion reported by Victor Gollancz in Reminiscences of Affection, p. 90, Joyce intoned &quot;Anna Livia Plurabelle&quot; to his own piano accompaniment.

He used the pseudonym Y.Y (Ys, or &quot;wise&quot;) in writing for the &quot;New Statesman&quot;. According to C. H. Rolph&#x27;s &quot;Kingsley&quot; (1973), Lynd&#x27;s weekly essay, which ran from 1913 to 1945, was &quot;irreplaceable&quot;. In 1941, editor Kingsley Martin decided to alternate it with pieces by James Bridie on Ireland, but the experiment was not at all a success.

==Political activism==
Attendance at a performance in London of John Millington Synge&#x27;s play &quot;Riders to the Sea&quot; aroused Lynd&#x27;s Irish Nationalist sympathies. These were further radicalised by the Home Rule crisis of 1912–14. He was appalled at the threat of the use of violence to deliver Ulster from Home Rule and the later decision to postpone the implementation of the Third Home Rule Bill. He later wrote: &quot;Then came August 1914 and England began a war for the freedom of small nations by postponing the freedom of the only small nation in Europe which it was within her power to liberate with the stroke of a pen.&quot;

Of James Connolly, Lynd was to write: &quot;among the sixteen men who were executed after the failure of the Irish Insurrection of 1916 there was no nobler or more heroic figure than James Connolly&quot;. He described Connolly as &quot;a working-class leader and a Nationalist in almost equal Proportions. He was at once as patriotic as Garibaldi and as revolutionary as Lenin&quot;. At the request of the Irish Transport and General Workers&#x27; Union, Lynd wrote an introduction to a new edition of James Connolly&#x27;s Labour in Irish history, first published in 1910.

He became a fluent Irish speaker, and Gaelic League member. As a Sinn Féin activist, he used the name Robiard Ó Flionn/Roibeard Ua Flionn. He nonetheless rejected an ethnic definition of what it is to be Irish:The &#x27;Real irishman&#x27; is neither essentially a Celt nor essentially a Catholic. He is merely a man who has the good or bad fortune to be born in Ireland or of Irish parents, and who is interested in Ireland more than any other country ... the Orange labourer of the north whose ancestors may have come from Scotland, has all the attributes of an Irishman no less than the Catholic labourer of the west, whose ancestors may have come from Greece, or from Spain, or from anywhere you care to speculate.In Belfast he was a member both of the republican Dungannon Clubs and of the Belfast Socialist Society.

==Personal life and death==
Lynd married the writer Sylvia Dryhurst on 21 April 1909. They had met at Gaelic League meetings in London. Their daughters Máire and Sigle became close friends of Isaiah Berlin. Máire married communist lawyer Jack Gaster and had three children. Sigle&#x27;s son, born in 1941, is artist Tim Wheeler.

In March 1924, Robert and Sylvia moved to what was to be their long-term married home, the elegant Regency house of 5 Keats Grove in the leafy suburb of Hampstead, north-west London. The house had been lived in by various members of Sylvia&#x27;s (Dryhurst) family.

James Joyce and his wife Nora Barnacle held their wedding lunch at the Lynds&#x27; house after getting married at Hampstead Town Hall on 4 July 1931.

Lynd died in Hampstead in 1949. He is buried in Belfast City Cemetery. Seán MacBride, Minister for External Affairs, attended the funeral as the representative of the government of the Republic of Ireland.

<doc id="1032151" wikidata="Q3792963" url="?curid=1032151" title="Unknown Soldier (DC Comics)">
<text>Unknown Soldier is a fictional war comics character in the DC Comics Universe. The character was created by Joe Kubert, Robert Kanigher and Irv Novick, first appearing in &quot;Our Army At War&quot; #168 (June 1966). The character is named after The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery, Virginia (which occasionally makes appearances in the series). The character of the Unknown Soldier is symbolic of the nameless soldiers that have fought throughout the United States&#x27; wars; as stated in his first featured story &quot;They Came From Shangri-La!&quot; (&quot;Star Spangled War Stories&quot; #151, June–July 1970), he is the &quot;man who no one knows — but — is known by everyone!&quot; Another nickname for the character used in the series is &quot;The Immortal G.I.&quot;

==Publication history==
=== First ongoing series ===
The Unknown Soldier&#x27;s first appearance in &quot;Our Army At War&quot; #168 was in a Sgt. Rock story, &quot;I Knew The Unknown Soldier!&quot;, written by Robert Kanigher and drawn by Joe Kubert. Kubert, who also edited the DC Comics line of war comics at the time, decided that the character was interesting enough to be featured in his own series, which began some years later in &quot;Star Spangled War Stories&quot;, running from issues #151 (June–July 1970) to 204 (February 1977). Eventually, &quot;Star Spangled War Stories&quot; began featuring the Soldier exclusively. With issue #205 (May 1977), the book changed its title to &quot;The Unknown Soldier&quot;, continuing the numbering and running for another 64 issues, ending with #268 (October 1982).

The series takes place during World War II, and focuses on the missions of a United States intelligence agent code-named &quot;The Unknown Soldier&quot;, whose head and face are so severely disfigured that he typically has it completely wrapped in heavy bandages. Despite this, he is a master of disguise who can assume the identity of almost any man using latex masks and make-up. However, his disguises occasionally itch where they meet the scar tissue of his face, forcing him to be conscious not to give himself away by scratching. He is also prone to loss of temper at enemy atrocities and has been seen to blow his cover in this manner.

Other writers contributing stories to the original run included Bob Haney, Frank Robbins, Archie Goodwin and David Michelinie. Artists also included Dick Ayers, Doug Wildey, Dan Spiegle, Jack Sparling and Gerry Talaoc. Back-up features included &quot;Enemy Ace&quot; by Robert Kanigher and John Severin, and &quot;Captain Fear&quot; by David Michelinie and Walt Simonson.

=== 1988 12-issue limited series ===
In 1988 and 1989, DC published a 12-issue limited series, also titled &quot;The Unknown Soldier&quot;, written by Jim Owsley and drawn by Phil Gascoine. Its depiction of this Soldier is radically different from the original one, with him being literally immortal and more cynical about the United States than the patriotic character of the original series. &quot;Unknown Soldier&quot; was a top vote-getter for the Comics Buyer&#x27;s Guide Fan Award for Favorite Limited Series for 1988.

=== 1997 4-issue limited series ===
In 1997 Garth Ennis wrote &quot;Unknown Soldier&quot;, a four-issue mini-series under the Vertigo imprint, featuring art by Kilian Plunkett. A much darker portrayal of the Soldier, the story is about a CIA agent tracing the post-war activities of the Soldier and the Soldier searching for a replacement for himself. This story appeared to ignore the 1988–89 limited series, and was collected into a trade paperback in 1998.

=== Second ongoing series ===
A new &quot;Unknown Soldier&quot; series from Vertigo, set in Uganda, was written by Joshua Dysart, with art by Alberto Ponticelli. It began publication in October 2008. In 2009 this run was nominated for an Eisner Award for &quot;Best New Series of the Year&quot;. The series started in October 2008, planned as an ongoing series, but was canceled in May 2010 due to low readership. Writer Dysart had this to say on the cancellation:
In total, the series ran for two years and 25 issues. Issues #13-14 were given a 2010 Glyph Comics Award for &quot;Story of the Year&quot;. In addition, issues #1 (cover illustrated by Igor Kordey) and 5 (cover illustrated by Dave Johnson) were given Glyph Comics Awards for &quot;Best Cover&quot;.

=== Later appearances ===
A figure similar in appearance to the original Unknown Soldier appears to exit the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in &quot;Blackest Night&quot; #3 and is seen again in issue #4 battling Wonder Woman.

The &quot;New 52&quot; iteration of the Unknown Soldier appeared in back-up stories in &quot;G.I. Combat&quot; from its launch in 2012 to its cancellation in 2013. He was also the focus of the series&#x27; issue #0 in November 2012. He later appeared in issues of &quot;Suicide Squad&quot;.

==Fictional character biography==
===Eddie Ray===
In &quot;Star Spangled War Stories&quot; #153 (reprinted from issue #36 with a new framing sequence), by Robert Kanigher and Irv Novick, a soldier named &quot;Eddie Ray&quot; is introduced. His Serial Number is 32891681 which can be read on pages 5–6. Although he is not confirmed as the identity of the Unknown Soldier, it is strongly hinted at because his face is never shown. The origin story in &quot;Star Spangled War Stories&quot; #154 (December–January 1970 – 1971) reveals that the Unknown Soldier is an unnamed young man who joins the United States Army together with his brother Harry less than two months before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Assigned to the Philippines when the Pacific War breaks out, he and Harry are present when the Japanese sweep across the islands. In their foxhole, Harry tells his brother not to lose hope even though they are outnumbered, because &quot;one guy can affect the outcome of a whole war! One guy in the right place... at the right time...&quot;

The two are fighting off wave after wave of invading Japanese soldiers when a hand grenade lands near their foxhole. Harry throws himself on the grenade and is killed instantly, but the explosion also injures the unnamed soldier&#x27;s face. In a rage, the soldier defeats the remaining Japanese single-handedly, but his face has been obliterated by the grenade and doctors are unable to restore it. Turning down a Medal of Honor for his actions, the soldier instead volunteers to be that &quot;one man in the right place&quot; that Harry spoke of. His previous identity is erased and he undergoes intensive training to become an intelligence operative code-named &quot;The Unknown Soldier&quot;.

The series does not take place linearly, but has individual stories scattered throughout all the years of the war and in various theaters. Over the course of the series, the Unknown Soldier also builds up a supporting cast, including Sergeant Chat Noir, an African American soldier and former French Resistance leader whom the Soldier first encounters a few days prior to D-Day. The Soldier also occasionally uses the services of an informant known only as Sparrow, who works behind enemy lines.

The last issue of the first series, &quot;The Unknown Soldier&quot; #268, &quot;A Farewell to War&quot; relates how during the Battle of Berlin, the Unknown Soldier is sent on a mission to stop a Nazi super-weapon, vampiric octopuses called &quot;Nosferatu&quot;. During the course of the story both Sparrow and Chat Noir are killed. On April 29, 1945, the Soldier infiltrates Adolf Hitler&#x27;s bunker, killing him and assuming the dictator&#x27;s identity to call off the weapon&#x27;s deployment. He then makes Hitler&#x27;s death look like a suicide so people will assume Hitler took the coward&#x27;s way out. As the Soldier makes his way to the Allied lines, he saves the life of a civilian girl from a bomb blast, apparently being killed himself. However, the last panel, taking place on May 7, 1945 after the city&#x27;s surrender, shows an American staff sergeant scratching his face in the Soldier&#x27;s distinctive manner, suggesting that he survived.

In &quot;DC Comics Presents&quot; #42 (February 1982), &quot;The Specter of War!&quot;, Superman&#x27;s alter-ego Clark Kent receives a mysterious note from an unidentified soldier that leads him to uncover a plan by a renegade Army officer to cause a nuclear holocaust. Throughout, Superman is assisted at key moments by the mysterious soldier, whom he later believes could be the legendary immortal G.I. It is left ambiguous if the Unknown Soldier is still alive or a ghost. At the end of the story, Kent visits the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, while a gardener in the background is seen scratching his face as the Soldier used to do.

In &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; #82 (January 1989), &quot;Brothers In Arms Part Two&quot;, it is revealed that the Soldier did survive World War II, but his continued existence is kept top secret, having been officially declared dead by his superiors.

During the &quot;Blackest Night&quot; event, the Soldier is depicted as one of the Black Lanterns, attacking his tomb in Washington proclaiming &quot;I have a name&quot;. The Unknown Soldier appears in the Arlington National Cemetery, alongside the Black Lantern Maxwell Lord, and is attacked by Wonder Woman. Wonder Woman uses her Lasso to reduce Unknown Soldier, Max, and the soldiers to dust. However, as she leaves, the dust begins to regenerate.

In the backup story &quot;Snapshot: Remembrance&quot; in the retrospective mini-series &quot;DC Universe: Legacies&quot; #4, set during a reunion on July 4, 1976, it is implied that the Soldier did survive the war, when the bartender at the reunion vanishes, leaving behind a mask. The other attendees are Jeb Stuart of the Haunted Tank, the Losers, Gravedigger and Mademoiselle Marie.

===Jack Helfer===
This modern version of the &quot;Unknown Soldier&quot;, created by Christopher Priest and Phil Gascoine, is a bitter soldier, who has made a career of doing what he was told, that has changed, becoming disillusioned. He is the benefactor of a bio-restorative formula that increases muscle density and accelerates the healing process, giving him immunity to most poisons and diseases. The Soldier claims to be immortal, and is believed that he may in fact be, because it also retards his aging process.

===Moses Lwanga===
&quot;Unknown Soldier&quot; was re-imagined by writer Joshua Dysart in 2008, under DC&#x27;s Vertigo imprint. This new version moves the story to Africa, set against the backdrop of the ongoing Lord&#x27;s Resistance Army insurgency of Uganda in 2002.
The series features artwork by Alberto Ponticelli, Pat Masioni, Oscar Celestini, José Villarrubia, Dave Johnson; and lettering by Clem Robins.

Dr. Moses Lwanga is a philanthropic-minded doctor. Born in Uganda, his family fled to the United States when he was a child, escaping the rule of Idi Amin. A born pacifist, Moses excelled academically in America, eventually becoming a medical doctor in Harvard with his parents&#x27; support. In 2000, Moses returned to Uganda to work with the disadvantaged people of his native land. There, he met his wife, Sera, a Christian doctor from the Ganda people. Moses and Sera work together to help the Acholi people of Northern Uganda, refugees caught in the middle of the Lord&#x27;s Resistance Army insurgency in Acholiland. As the series progresses, Moses continues struggling to do what is right, his two personalities constantly battling. While he wants to do good and protect the innocent from those who would seek to exploit and harm them, he cannot repress his violent thoughts upon seeing how low mankind can sink.

Moses is constantly haunted by dreams of him killing the people around him easily and brutally, including his wife. Disturbed by these nightmares, the violence surrounding the field hospital and his treatment of various injuries caused by the fighting strip away his deteriorating moral compass. He finally breaks, running from a hospital camp in response to the alleged rape of a girl, where he comes in to contact with child rebel fighters. He disarms and kills one, finally shattering his pacifist beliefs, which causes him to take a rock and self-mutilate his face in a violent delirium. He is taken in by a local Catholic convent that is attempting to shelter girls from rebel groups that come to take them as wives, and his face is bandaged. As he is coming to grips with his violent killing, the convent is attacked and the girls are all captured, with the rebel leader only giving up ten to the convent&#x27;s Australian nun who comes begging for their freedom. Moses takes it upon himself to rescue the remaining twenty, and ends up murdering even more child militants in the process, using some innate combat skills that he fails to understand the source of. These events attract the attention of the CIA, who coerce an AWOL operative in the area, Jack Lee Howl, to track him down.

The convent is ultimately destroyed despite Moses&#x27; efforts, and the nun returns to her home country. Moses&#x27; violent alter ego comes to light as a violent man that is highly deft at using close combat and modern firepower to kill scores of enemy forces, and manifests itself as a voice in his head, which he eventually self-diagnoses as multiple personality disorder. Despite his alter ego&#x27;s influence on his actions, it can not do anything Moses himself does not want to do. Moses&#x27; rage at the corrupt systems at play in Uganda cause him to seek to destroy the Lord&#x27;s Resistance Army and kill Joseph Kony, and the alter ego seizes upon this as a war for him to fight. He begins carrying out one-man raids and directs all child soldiers that give up their arms to rehabilitation centers across the country—one of whom is Paul, a child conscripted in to the LRA as a pack mule and radio operator. Moses does manage to return to his old camp once to Sera, and they are able to spend a night together. However, rebels attack and the two are separated in the chaos.

Jack, despite running in to Moses a couple times and establishing a connection with Moses&#x27; now estranged wife Sera, is unable to manipulate him for the CIA. It is only when a group seeking to assassinate a famous American actress and humanitarian, Margaret Wells, reaches Moses through Jack do the two finally cooperate. Moses, despite acknowledging her good intentions, agrees to carry out the assassination &quot;for the greater good&quot;, but his use of landmines ends up killing a convoy of innocent herders. In the confusion, Wells&#x27; UN escort intercept Moses, who was injured in his attempt to stop the convoy. Moses discovers that Wells is coordinating a benefit dinner &quot;in the memory of Moses Lwanga&quot;, and eventually is exiled from the group due to his angry outburst when he accuses Wells of trying to use rich people&#x27;s money to solve Uganda&#x27;s problems. Meanwhile, his failure to assassinate her convinces the group to do it themselves at the benefit dinner. Moses, realizing the group&#x27;s twisted actions would not pin the blame and thus the world&#x27;s attention on the LRA, thwarts the assassination with Jack&#x27;s help and connections to the would-be assassins. Though Moses&#x27; operation is successful, he is unable to reconcile his killing of innocent civilians with Sera and his past life, and leaves her behind once again to continue his battle against the LRA.

Moses finds Paul waiting for him at one of his old campsites, where he reveals that the center he was sent to is not free of the effects of the war. Moses finally agrees to take the child back to his home village, which turns out to have turned in to a refugee camp. There, Moses undergoes a traditional ritual that he thinks has cleaned him of his sins, and thus his &quot;alter ego&quot;. Right after their arrival, the local doctor is murdered—through an investigation in to an elaborate arms deal for stolen medicine plot, Moses finds that it was his alter ego who murdered the doctor due to his own subconscious desire to take the doctor&#x27;s place and be &quot;Dr. Lwanga&quot; once again. Moses kills the local garrison&#x27;s corrupt army official and his soldiers, thwarts the official&#x27;s arms deal plot, and finds the stolen medicine, which his alter ego had hidden away from the reaches of the army. To escape the wrath of the herders, who had expected the weapons in the deal, he leaves Paul and the village, entrusting the medicine to the next village doctor.

After smuggling out a family besieged by raiders from their hiding spot on a hill, Moses makes a last stand there, fighting against scores of armed herders. He is rescued by American forces in helicopters, who are finally able to capture him and return him to the CIA, which wishes to use him as a supersoldier.

In a flashback, it is revealed that the persona of Dr. Moses Lwanga is a fabrication resulting from an unknown psychological experiment overseen by the original Unknown Soldier. The man who would assume the identity of Moses Lwanga is a Ugandan-American man who came to the United States at the age of six, orphaned at thirteen, raised in foster care, and later served in the military to avoid prison, experiencing combat in South America and the Middle East. &quot;Lwanga&quot;, who has been brainwashed of all these experiences, is shown speaking with the original Unknown Soldier in a secret government facility. The Unknown Soldier tells &quot;Lwanga&quot; his story, detailing his exploits as a black operations operative for over a fifty-year period after a tortured service in the Pacific front of World War 2. He goes on to tell &quot;Lwanga&quot; that there have been numerous psychological experiments conducted in order to recreate the perfect soldier but none have been successful; all of the candidates went insane, except for &quot;Lwanga&quot;. He then announces that instead of creating another operative whose sole purpose is to fight, he wishes to do the opposite; take a man who has known conflict for most of his life and make him an instrument of peace, dedicated to doing good for the rest of his life. &quot;Lwanga&quot; agrees, becoming Dr. Moses Lwanga. However, Moses&#x27; exposure to violence in his medical camp effective triggered his combat conditioning, and his alter ego emerged as the next &quot;Unknown Soldier&quot;, discarding morality to engage in eternal warfare. This Unknown Soldier, seeing parallels in his past life as a 20th-century black ops operative to Kony&#x27;s actions in orchestrating the suffering of millions, seizes on the opportunity to kill Kony as a form of redemption. Upon discovering his alter ego is indeed no less false than his &quot;true&quot; one, Moses gives the Unknown Soldier full reign over his body. He is able to escape the CIA with the help of Jack, who tips off Sera to his location. The Unknown Soldier, still locked in to war with Joseph Kony, confronts Sera once last time, finally telling her the man that she knew as Moses was completely gone.

In the final issue, the Unknown Soldier infiltrates Kony&#x27;s camp, intending to kill him once and for all. Although a child soldier guarding Kony&#x27;s personal tent shoots him, he shrugs off the bullets and enters the tent. After he finally plants his knife in Kony&#x27;s eye, the dead man&#x27;s subordinates and wives celebrate his demise. Sera appears, telling the Soldier/Moses that no matter who he is, she always loved him, and the two embrace; however, this pleasant vision is a dream, and it is shown that he had actually been shot in the head before ever reaching Kony. In a symbolic conclusion of his morality arc, it turns out that he didn&#x27;t kill a single person in Kony&#x27;s camp, instead throwing its garrison of child soldiers in to disarray, who assume there is a much larger force due to a huge amount of diversionary gunfire and explosives. In a pacifistic bliss, he is only killed in a standoff after he refuses to shoot the child soldier guarding Kony&#x27;s tent. Though his final mission is a failure, he dies at peace reunited with Sera, finally taking on his previous identity as Moses Lwanga.

In the epilogue, Sera remarries to a Muslim journalist who had covered the exploits of her husband as the Unknown Soldier: the two have several children and live as a family. Jack continues to live in Africa, finally having escaped the CIA&#x27;s grasp on him. Kony, true to events at the end of the story&#x27;s publishing in 2010, is shown to have been pushed out of Northern Uganda, but still active in certain areas in Africa. The story then cuts to Tumbura, Sudan in 2010, where several child soldiers are gearing up for combat against Kony&#x27;s LRA. One of the children wraps his face in bandages like the Unknown Soldier.

===The New 52===
In 2011, &quot;The New 52&quot; rebooted the DC universe. The Unknown Soldier has appeared in the comic &quot;GI Combat&quot; written by Justin Gray and Jimmy Palmiotti where he is in Afghanistan and is fighting for the Americans. After the cancellation of &quot;GI Combat&quot; in 2012, The Unknown Soldier appeared in the Suicide Squad, brought in by Amanda Waller to be a new team leader.

In the pages of &quot;The New Golden Age&quot;, a flashback to July 1, 1944 on the Western Front has the Unknown Soldier presenting Easy Company with information on Per Degaton&#x27;s Nazi experiments where he stated that a lot of soldiers died to get this information.

<text>In mathematics, an all one polynomial (AOP) is a polynomial in which all coefficients are one. Over the finite field of order two, conditions for the AOP to be irreducible are known, which allow this polynomial to be used to define efficient algorithms and circuits for multiplication in finite fields of characteristic two. The AOP is a 1-equally spaced polynomial.

==Definition==
An AOP of degree &quot;m&quot; has all terms from &quot;x&quot;&quot;m&quot; to &quot;x&quot;0 with coefficients of 1, and can be written as

:formula_1

or

:formula_2

or

:formula_3

Thus the roots of the all one polynomial of degree &quot;m&quot; are all (&quot;m&quot;+1)th roots of unity other than unity itself.

==Properties==
Over GF(2) the AOP has many interesting properties, including:

*The Hamming weight of the AOP is &quot;m&quot; + 1, the maximum possible for its degree
*The AOP is irreducible if and only if &quot;m&quot; + 1 is prime and 2 is a primitive root modulo &quot;m&quot; + 1 (over GF(&quot;p&quot;) with prime &quot;p&quot;, it is irreducible if and only if &quot;m&quot; + 1 is prime and &quot;p&quot; is a primitive root modulo &quot;m&quot; + 1)
*The only AOP that is a primitive polynomial is &quot;x&quot;2 + x + 1.

Despite the fact that the Hamming weight is large, because of the ease of representation and other improvements there are efficient implementations in areas such as coding theory and cryptography.

Over formula_4, the AOP is irreducible whenever &quot;m&quot; + 1 is a prime &quot;p&quot;, and therefore in these cases, the &quot;p&quot;th cyclotomic polynomial.

<doc id="1032156" wikidata="Q6050" url="?curid=1032156" title="Anna de Noailles">
<text>Anna, Comtesse Mathieu de Noailles (Anna Elisabeth Bibesco-Bassaraba de Brancovan) (15 November 1876 – 30 April 1933) was a French writer of Romanian, Greek and Bulgarian descent, a poet and a socialist feminist.

==Biography==
===Personal life===
Born Princess Anna Elisabeth Bibesco-Bassaraba de Brancovan in Paris, she was a descendant of the Bibescu and Craioveşti families of Romanian boyars. Her father was Prince Grégoire Bibesco-Bassaraba, a son of Wallachian Prince Gheorghe Bibesco and Zoe Mavrocordato-Bassaraba de Brancovan. Her Greek mother was the former Ralouka (Rachel) Mussurus, a musician, to whom the Polish composer Ignacy Paderewski dedicated several of his compositions. Via her mother, Anna de Noailles was a great-great-granddaughter of Sophronius of Vratsa, one of the leading figures of the Bulgarian National Revival, through his grandson Stefan Bogoridi, caimacam of Moldavia.

In 1897 she married Mathieu Fernand Frédéric Pascal de Noailles (1873–1942), the fourth son of the 7th Duke de Noailles. The couple soon became the toast of Parisian high society. They had one child, a son, Count Anne-Jules de Noailles (1900–1979).

===Career===
Anna de Noailles wrote three novels, an autobiography, and many collections of poetry. She had friendly relations with the intellectual, literary and artistic elite of the day including Marcel Proust, Francis Jammes, Colette, André Gide, Frédéric Mistral, Robert de Montesquiou-Fezensac, Rainer Maria Rilke, Paul Valéry, Jean Cocteau, Pierre Loti, Paul Hervieu, and Max Jacob.

A &quot;New York Times&quot; writer in 1929 wrote that she was &quot;one of the finest poets of present-day France.&quot;

She died in 1933 in Paris, aged 56, and was interred in the Père Lachaise Cemetery. She was a cousin of Prince Antoine Bibesco and Princess Marthe Bibesco.
===In fine art===
So popular was Anna de Noailles that various notable artists of the day painted her portrait, including Antonio de la Gandara, Ignacio Zuloaga, Kees van Dongen, Jacques Émile Blanche, and the British portrait painter Philip de László. In 1906 her image was sculpted by Auguste Rodin; the clay model can be seen today in the Musée Rodin in Paris, and the finished marble bust is on display in New York&#x27;s Metropolitan Museum.

==Awards==

Anna de Noailles was the first woman to become a Commander of the Legion of Honour, the first woman to be received in the Royal Belgian Academy of French Language and Literature, and she was honored with the &quot;Grand Prix&quot; of the Académie Française in 1921.

Countess de Noailles served as a juror with Florence Meyer Blumenthal in awarding the Prix Blumenthal, a grant given between 1919 and 1954 to painters, sculptors, decorators, engravers, writers, and musicians.

<text>Christopher Anton Rea ( ; born 4 March 1951) is a British rock and blues singer-songwriter and guitarist from Middlesbrough. Known for his distinctive voice and his slide guitar playing, Rea has recorded twenty five studio albums, two of which topped the UK Albums Chart, &quot;The Road to Hell&quot; in 1989 and its successor, &quot;Auberge&quot;, in 1991. He had already become &quot;a major European star by the time he finally cracked the UK Top 10&quot; with the single &quot;The Road to Hell (Part 2)&quot;. 

Over the course of his long career, Rea&#x27;s work has at times been informed by his struggles with serious health issues. His many hit songs include &quot;I Can Hear Your Heartbeat&quot;, &quot;Stainsby Girls&quot;, &quot;Josephine&quot;, &quot;On the Beach&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot;, &quot;Driving Home for Christmas&quot;, &quot;Working on It&quot;, &quot;Tell Me There&#x27;s a Heaven&quot;, &quot;Auberge&quot;, and &quot;Julia&quot;. He also recorded a duet with Elton John, &quot;If You Were Me&quot;. Rea was nominated three times for the Brit Award for Best British Male Artist: in 1988, 1989 and 1990.

Rea has never toured the United States, where he is best known for the 1978 single &quot;Fool (If You Think It&#x27;s Over)&quot;, which reached No. 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and spent three weeks at No. 1 on the Adult Contemporary chart, earning him a Grammy nomination as Best New Artist in 1978. A decade later, &quot;Working On It&quot; topped the Mainstream Rock chart. He has sold more than 40 million records worldwide.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Christopher Rea was born on 4 March 1951 in Middlesbrough in the North Riding of Yorkshire to an Italian father, Camillo Rea (died December 2010) originating from Arpino in the Province of Frosinone, and an Irish mother, Winifred K. Slee (died September 1983), as one of seven children. His family were of the Roman Catholic faith. The name Rea was well known locally thanks to his father&#x27;s ice cream factory and café chain. When he was twelve, he worked clearing tables in the coffee bar and making ice cream in the factory. He wanted to improve the business, but his ideas got no support from his father. After leaving, he was replaced by one of his brothers. At that time he wanted to be a journalist and attended St Mary&#x27;s College, Middlesbrough.

Rea bought his first guitar in his early twenties, a 1961 Höfner V3 and 25-watt Laney amplifier He played primarily &quot;bottleneck&quot; guitar, also known as slide guitar. Rea&#x27;s playing style was inspired by Charlie Patton whom he had heard on the radio. He had initially thought Patton&#x27;s playing sounded like a violin. Rea was also influenced by Blind Willie Johnson and Sister Rosetta Tharpe as well as by the playing of Ry Cooder and Joe Walsh. He was also listening to Delta blues musicians like Sonny Boy Williamson II and Muddy Waters, gospel blues, and opera to light orchestral classics to develop his style. He recalls that &quot;for many people from working-class backgrounds, rock wasn&#x27;t a chosen thing, it was the only thing, the only avenue of creativity available for them&quot;, and that &quot;when I was young I wanted most of all to be a writer of films and film music. But Middlesbrough in 1968 wasn&#x27;t the place to be if you wanted to do movie scores&quot;. Due to his late introduction to music and guitar playing, Rea commented that when compared to Mark Knopfler and Eric Clapton, &quot;I definitely missed the boat, I think&quot;. He was self-taught, and soon tried to join a friend&#x27;s group, The Elastic Band, as the first choice for guitar or bass. Heeding his father&#x27;s advice he did not join as his potential earnings would not be enough to cover the costs of being in the group. As a result, he found himself working casual labouring jobs, including working in his father&#x27;s ice cream business. Rea commented that, at that time, he was &quot;meant to be developing my father&#x27;s ice-cream cafe into a global concern, but I spent all my time in the stockroom playing slide guitar&quot;.

===1973–1982: Early career and &quot;Fool (If You Think It&#x27;s Over)&quot;===
In 1973 he joined the local Middlesbrough band, Magdalene, which earlier had included David Coverdale who had left to join Deep Purple. He began writing songs for the band and took up singing only because the singer in the band failed to show up for a playing engagement. Rea then went on to form the band The Beautiful Losers which received &quot;Melody Maker&quot;&#x27;s Best Newcomers award in 1973. He secured a solo recording deal with independent Magnet Records, and released his first single entitled &quot;So Much Love&quot; in 1974. The band itself split up in 1977. He guested on Catherine Howe&#x27;s EP &quot;The Truth of the Matter&quot;. He recorded his first album that same year, but according to Michael Levy (co-founder of Magnet) the recordings were burned and started over again because it did not capture his whole talent.

====Debut album====

&quot;Whatever Happened to Benny Santini?&quot;, Rea&#x27;s debut studio album, was released in June 1978, produced by Gus Dudgeon. The title referred to a stage name that Rea had suggested when the record label insisted that his given name did not sound &quot;croony&quot; enough. It peaked at No. 49 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 200, and charted for 12 weeks. The lead single, &quot;Fool (If You Think It&#x27;s Over)&quot;, was Rea&#x27;s biggest hit in the US, reaching No. 1 on the Adult Contemporary Singles chart, and No. 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. As Rea gave Magnet Records its first major breakthrough and its first US Top-10, he was their biggest artist, the more so when he was nominated at the 21st Annual Grammy Awards as Best New Artist. Levy remembers him as &quot;more of a thoughtful, introspective poet than a natural pop performer&quot; which Levy felt stopped Rea from becoming a bigger star. Few of Rea&#x27;s early singles charted in the UK. &quot;Fool&quot; performed modestly on its second release in late 1978, prompted by its strong performance in the US, and that stateside success also led to Rea being categorized as a piano-playing singer-songwriter, similar to Elton John and Billy Joel, rather than the guitar player he is. For several years, Magnet marketed him based on this misconception. Rea says that it &quot;is still the only song I&#x27;ve ever not played guitar on, but it just so happened to be my first single&quot;. Rea has &quot;always had a difficult relationship with fame, even before my first illness. None of my heroes were rock stars. I arrived in Hollywood for the Grammy Awards once and thought I was going to bump into people who mattered, like Ry Cooder or Randy Newman. But I was surrounded by pop stars&quot;. Throughout his career Rea has emphatically rejected the label of &quot;rock star&quot;.

====Subsequent early albums====
Dudgeon also produced Rea&#x27;s second album &quot;Deltics&quot; (1979). Rea recorded his self-produced third album, &quot;Tennis&quot; (1980), with musicians from Middlesbrough, and it received positive reviews. As both albums had failed commercially, Magnet rejected the artwork Rea wanted for the cover of his fourth album, 1981&#x27;s &quot;Chris Rea&quot; (produced by Jon Kelly, who later oversaw Rea&#x27;s most successful albums). None of these albums reached the Top 50 in the UK, with his singles also delivering lacklustre performances. &quot;Diamonds&quot; reached No. 44 in the US, and &quot;Loving You&quot; went to No. 88 on the Billboard Hot 100. Rea had a difficult working relationship with Dudgeon and the other &quot;men in suits&quot; who he felt &quot;smoothed out&quot; the blues-influenced elements of his music. Rea &quot;always thought that [producers] knew best. I never thought for a minute that they might have another agenda&quot;, but &quot;all of a sudden I was the goose that laid the golden egg, and it was hell for me&quot;. He ruefully acknowledges, &quot;I can&#x27;t blame anyone but myself. I gave them what they wanted rather than what I wanted&quot;.

===1983–1988: European breakthrough===
====&quot;Water Sign&quot; and &quot;Shamrock Diaries&quot;====

From 1983, Rea&#x27;s music began to better reflect his wishes and capabilities, despite pressure from his record company due to the accumulated costs of the production for his first four albums. To keep costs low, the label decided to release the demo tapes of his fifth studio album &quot;Water Sign&quot;. It was the first of several successful albums on which Rea collaborated with producer David Richards. He also changed managers and went on a UK club tour, followed by a 60-date tour as a support act for Canadian band Saga. &quot;Water Sign&quot; performed far better than Rea or his team expected in Ireland and Europe, selling over half a million copies in just a few months. The single &quot;I Can Hear Your Heartbeat&quot; charted in Europe. With the album&#x27;s success along with that of the subsequent &quot;Wired to the Moon&quot; (1984), which was his first Top 40 album in the UK (reaching No. 35), Rea began to focus his attention on touring continental Europe and building up a fan base. He established a loyal following in West Germany, and believes this audience saved his career as there was no &quot;image-led market&quot;, but only &quot;by music and by word of mouth&quot;. It was not until 1985&#x27;s million-selling &quot;Shamrock Diaries&quot;, with its hit singles &quot;Stainsby Girls&quot; and &quot;Josephine&quot;, written for his wife and daughter respectively, that UK audiences began to take notice of him.

====&quot;On the Beach&quot; and &quot;Dancing with Strangers&quot;====
His international fame grew with the million-selling studio albums &quot;On The Beach&quot; (1986), and &quot;Dancing with Strangers&quot; (1987) which reached No. 2 on the UK albums chart, behind Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Bad&quot;, and which included his first Top 20 UK single, &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot;, which reached No. 12. In 1986, Rea was a support act along with The Bangles and The Fountainhead for Queen at Slane Concert for an estimated 80,000 audience. He also performed at Milano Suono festival at stadium San Siro, Italy. By 1987, Rea was finally in a position to pay off the £320,000 debt he owed to the record company, and started to make significant earnings. He signed with Warners, who also bought Magnet Recordings. That year, the &quot;Dancing with Strangers&quot; world tour sold out stadium-sized venues, including two shows at Wembley Arena, and included Rea&#x27;s first concerts in Australia and Japan. Rea&#x27;s American label, Tamla Motown, had told him that he should go to America and tour there for three years. Out of deference to his family, he did not do so. He commented that at the time he realized that &quot;I could be as big as I liked, if I was prepared to do the touring&quot;.

====&quot;New Light Through Old Windows&quot;====
Rea&#x27;s next album was his first compilation - albeit an unconventional one, as most songs were new versions of older releases. &quot;New Light Through Old Windows&quot; (1988) was another million seller, climbing to No. 5 in the UK. The album included re-workings of some of his charting singles, as well as a reworking of his recent single &quot;Driving Home for Christmas&quot;. Some of the tracks were successful in the US, including &quot;Working On It&quot;, which reached No. 73 on Billboard Hot 100 and topped the Mainstream Rock chart. The re-recorded version of &quot;On the Beach&quot; reached the Top 10 on the US Adult Contemporary chart, and No. 12 in the UK. The album&#x27;s release and success was followed by an international tour with over 45 dates.

===1989–1994: Chart dominance, &quot;The Road to Hell&quot; and &quot;Auberge&quot;===
Rea&#x27;s tenth studio album was his major breakthrough. &quot;The Road to Hell&quot; (1989) enjoyed massive success and became his first No. 1 album in the UK, being certified 6× Platinum by the BPI in 2004. While the album peaked at No. 107 in the US, the single &quot;The Road to Hell (Part 2)&quot; climbed to No. 11 on the US Mainstream Rock chart, and was Rea&#x27;s first and only UK Top 10 single. The song &quot;Texas&quot; achieved extensive radio airplay in the state itself. In December 1989, Rea performed on the Band Aid II single &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; In 1991, &quot;Auberge&quot; repeated its predecessor&#x27;s success, reaching No. 1 in the UK albums chart, and was another hit across Europe. The single of the same title made the UK Top 20. Even at the peak of his success, Rea refused to mount an American tour or perform on &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot;, although he was a guest on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;, and also performed on the show. Rea said his neglect of the US market was one of his biggest mistakes because &quot;every time I see a car that&#x27;s too much money, I definitely regret it, just for five minutes&quot;.

After &quot;Auberge&quot;, Rea released &quot;God&#x27;s Great Banana Skin&quot; (1992) which reached No. 4 in the UK, while the single &quot;Nothing to Fear&quot; gave him another Top 20 hit. A year later the album &quot;Espresso Logic&quot; made the Top 10 and &quot;Julia&quot;, written about his second daughter, gave him his sixth and last Top 20 single. The album was partly promoted by Rea&#x27;s taking part in the non-Championship &quot;TOCA Shootout&quot; round of the 1993 British Touring Car Championship, although he was eliminated in the first round. In 1994 another compilation album, &quot;The Best of Chris Rea&quot;, was released which peaked at No. 3 in UK. That July, Rea performed with Peter Gabriel and others at Sonoria festival in Milan.

===1995–2005: Recovery from illness, return to blues roots and &quot;Blue Guitars&quot;===
In 1994 Rea had developed stomach ulcers The following year, he &quot;got peritonitis and nearly died. Facing the prospect of never singing, touring or performing in public again, he characteristically embarked on a radical career shift and went into movies.&quot; 1996 saw the release of the soundtrack album for &quot;La Passione&quot;, which Rea also wrote and produced. Two years later in 1998 &quot;The Blue Cafe&quot;, his fourteenth studio album, followed. It reached the UK Top Ten and received extremely positive reviews and a tour named The Blue Cafe Tour followed to promote the album. In 1999, ten years after &quot;The Road to Hell&quot;, the dance and electronica infused &quot;The Road to Hell: Part 2&quot; failed to reach the UK Top 40. Rea rebounded in 2000, when &quot;King of the Beach&quot; made it to the UK Top 30.

Rea was first &quot;diagnosed with pancreatic cancer at the age of just 33&quot;. In 2000, he underwent a Whipple procedure, which resulted in the removal of the head of the pancreas and part of the duodenum, bile duct, and gall bladder. Since having this surgery Rea has had problems with diabetes and a weaker immune system, necessitating the need to take thirty-four pills and seven injections a day. He has undergone several subsequent operations. Nevertheless, he found greater appreciation for life, his family, and the things he loves.

In an interview, he said, &quot;it&#x27;s not until you become seriously ill and you nearly die and you&#x27;re at home for six months, that you suddenly stop, to realize that this isn&#x27;t the way I intended it to be in the beginning. Everything that you&#x27;ve done falls away and you start wondering why you went through all that rock business stuff.&quot; A record company offered him millions of dollars to do a duets album with notable artists. Having promised himself that if he recovered he would return to his blues roots, he started the record label Jazzee Blue to free himself from his then current company&#x27;s expectations. The first album under this label, &quot;Dancing Down the Stony Road&quot; (2002), reached No. 14 and was certified Gold by the BPI. He wanted the label to be a place &quot;where musicians came and made a record&quot; of this style of music. Jazzee Blue released several blues and jazz albums mostly by members of his then current band. He was disappointed with the music business when Michael Parkinson, who supported him to do &quot;Dancing Down the Stony Road&quot;, told him songs longer than three minutes were not played as often on radio anymore.

In 2003, Rea released &quot;Blue Street (Five Guitars)&quot; and &quot;Hofner Blue Notes&quot;, and &quot;The Blue Jukebox&quot; the following year. 2005 saw the release of &quot;Blue Guitars&quot;, a box set of 11 CDs containing 137 blues-inspired tracks with Rea&#x27;s paintings as album covers, which is a once in a lifetime ambitious project about the history of blues music. Rea said, &quot;I was never a rock star or pop star and all the illness has been my chance to do what I&#x27;d always wanted to do with music [...] the best change for my music has been concentrating on stuff which really interests me&quot;.

===2006–2015: Continuation of blues albums and tours===

In February 2008, Rea released &quot;The Return of the Fabulous Hofner Bluenotes&quot;, dedicated to the 1960s Höfner guitars, with 38 tracks on three CDs and two 10&quot; vinyl records - the vinyl replicated the tracks contained on the first CD of the set. The box set also included a hardback book of his paintings along with period photos. The release of the album was followed by a European tour, visiting various venues across the UK, including the Royal Albert Hall in London. Part of the tour was recorded and released as a live DVD and his first live album, &quot;The Road to Hell &amp; Back&quot;, to positive reviews.

Rea released the compilation &quot;Still So Far to Go&quot; in October 2009 which contained some of his best known (and lesser known) hits over the last thirty years as well as songs from his &quot;blues&quot; period. Two new songs were included, &quot;Come So Far, Yet Still So Far to Go&quot; and the ballad &quot;Valentino&quot;. The album reached No. 8 and was certified Gold by the BPI. Rea started the European tour called &quot;Still So Far to Go&quot; in January 2010. His special guest on stage was Irish musician Paul Casey. The tour ended on 5 April at Waterfront Hall in Belfast. In September 2011 &quot;Santo Spirito Blues&quot; box set was released. The set contained two feature-length films on one DVD written and directed by Rea along with three accompanying CDs - two of which featured the music from the DVDs and the third being a stripped back version of the related studio album. Shortly after this release, in October and November, Rea underwent two surgical procedures. On 3 February 2012 the Santo Spirito Tour started at Congress Center Hamburg in Hamburg, Germany, with additional visits to Poland, Russia, Ukraine, Hungary, Switzerland, Netherlands, Belgium and France. The United Kingdom part of the tour commenced in the middle of March and finished on 5 April at Hammersmith Apollo in London.

November 2014 saw Rea embark on a European tour called The Last Open Road Tour, with the UK part of the tour commencing on 1 December in Manchester and ending on 20 December in London. He also performed at the 2014 Montreux Jazz Festival.

===2016–present: Further illness, recovery, and retrospectives===
Rea suffered a stroke in 2016 which left him with slurred speech and reduced movement in his arms and fingers. Soon afterwards he quit smoking to deter further strokes and recovered enough to record and tour. In September 2017, he released his twenty-fourth album, &quot;Road Songs for Lovers&quot;, and embarked on a European tour starting in October until December. On 9 December, Rea collapsed during a performance at the New Theatre Oxford, the 35th concert of the tour. He was taken to hospital where his condition was stabilized. This health issue caused the last two concerts of the tour to be cancelled. In December 2020, Rea guest starred on the Christmas edition of &quot;Mortimer &amp; Whitehouse: Gone Fishing&quot;, where he discussed his health issues over the years.

On 18 October 2019, Rhino released 2CD deluxe editions of five of Chris Rea&#x27;s most commercially successful albums, &quot;Shamrock Diaries&quot;, &quot;On The Beach&quot;, &quot;Dancing With Strangers&quot;, &quot;The Road To Hell&quot;, and &quot;Auberge&quot;. Each contains a remastered version of the original album on the first disc, and remixes, rare and previously unreleased live tracks, single edits, and extended versions on the bonus disc. On 4 October, &quot;One Fine Day&quot; had been released, limited to 1000 numbered copies. The album contains tracks recorded in 1980 at Chipping Norton Recording Studios, most of which had never been released. On 20 November 2020, the triple CD compilation &quot;Era 1: 1978 - 1984&quot; was released. It contains a mix of A-sides, B-sides, foreign language versions and different mixes, as well as all of &quot;One Fine Day&quot; on disc 2.

==Musicianship==
===Guitars===
Rea&#x27;s first guitar was a Höfner V3 or 173 which he bought in a second-hand shop because, at the time, there were not that many shops in Middlesbrough where one could purchase a guitar. He played the V3 until 1979, although, by Rea&#x27;s reckoning, it was a &quot;dreadful guitar with an appalling action, but playing slide it didn&#x27;t matter&quot;. During his career the guitar most associated with him was a 1962 Fender Stratocaster which he called &quot;Pinky&quot;. Rea bought the instrument after seeing a Ry Cooder concert at the City Hall in Newcastle. The guitar once was submerged in water for three months and was more mellow in sound compared to the classic hard Stratocaster sound. Since 2002 &quot;Dancing Down the Stony Road&quot;, his main guitar was an Italia Maranello he named &quot;Bluey&quot;.

===Filmography===
One of his childhood dreams was to become a film writer and film music composer. Rea wrote the title track and music score for the 1993 drama film &quot;Soft Top Hard Shoulder&quot;. He wrote and produced the 1996 film &quot;La Passione&quot;, partially inspired by Rea&#x27;s childhood experience of falling in love with motor racing and F1 Ferrari&#x27;s driver Wolfgang von Trips. Rea was the lead actor in the 1999 comedy film &quot;Parting Shots&quot;, alongside Felicity Kendal, John Cleese, Bob Hoskins and Joanna Lumley. Rea, ironically, played a character who was told that cancer gave him six weeks to live and decided to kill those people who had badly affected his life. Afterwards, two feature-length films were made for the &quot;Santo Spirito Blues&quot; project, just &quot;so that I could do the music&quot;.

===References in lyrics===
Rea has acknowledged that several of his songs were &quot;born out of Middlesbrough&quot;, his hometown. The verse &quot;I&#x27;m standing by a river, but the water doesn&#x27;t flow / It boils with every poison you can think of&quot; from &quot;The Road to Hell&quot;, the songs &quot;Steel River&quot; which refers to a nickname for the River Tees, and &quot;Windy Town, reflect Rea&#x27;s feelings about the industrial decline of Middlesbrough and the re-development of the town centre while he was out of the country touring through the years:

==Personal life==

=== Health ===
In 1994, Rea was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and underwent a life-saving operation to remove his pancreas, gallbladder, and a portion of his liver. As a result, he has type 1 diabetes.

===Family life===
Rea is married to Joan Lesley, with whom he has been in a relationship since they met as teenagers on 6 April 1968 in their native Middlesbrough. They have two daughters, Josephine, born 16 September 1983, and Julia Christina, born 18 March 1989. Josephine lectures on Renaissance art in Florence and Julia studied at the University of St Andrews. Rea used to live at Cookham, Berkshire, where he owned Sol Mill Recording Studios and produced some of his later albums. When he is not writing songs, other interests particularly include painting. Rea says that he likes to &quot;read a lot and even though I chose music, journalism was my first passion. I wanted to be a journalist and write about car racing [...] somewhere deep down I believe I could have been a decent journalist&quot;.

===Cars and motor racing===

Rea is a fan of historic motor racing and races a Ferrari Dino, a Ferrari 328, and a 1955 Lotus 6. In 1993, he participated in the 1993 British Touring Car Championship ToCa shootout as a guest driver. He owned and raced the 1964 Lotus Elan 26R, and the well known Caterham 7 from the &quot;Auberge&quot; album cover, until it was sold in 2005 with all proceeds (£11,762) going to the charity NSPCC. He also owned the Ferrari 330 which was used as a donor car for the replica of Ferrari 250 Le Mans used in the 1996 movie &quot;La Passione&quot;. In 2014, he was completing a 22-year restoration of an original replica of a Ferrari 156 Sharknose Formula One racing car. He also joined Historic Racing Drivers Club, where he drives a 1957 Morris Minor 1000 police car.

He has taken the opportunity to get involved in Formula One on a few occasions, including as a pit lane mechanic for the Jordan team during the 1995 Monaco Grand Prix. He recorded a song, &quot;Saudade&quot;, in tribute to three-time Formula One world champion Ayrton Senna. It featured prominently in the BBC documentary movie.

===Politics===
In a 2017 interview, amid the 2017 general election, Rea supported Jeremy Corbyn and even wrote a song called &quot;What&#x27;s So Wrong With A Man Who Tells The Truth?&quot;, saying &quot;in the old way, Corbyn is useless. Because he says the wrong things. But the young people have had enough&quot;. Rea considers that the politicians and government of the UK and EU became out of touch with the common people. He is sceptical about the idea of unification of Europe because with a common European market &quot;you [...] force different people to live together [when] they simply do not want to&quot;, recalling the downfall of Yugoslavia.

<text>An equally spaced polynomial (ESP) is a polynomial used in finite fields, specifically GF(2) (binary).

An &quot;s&quot;-ESP of degree &quot;sm&quot; can be written as:

:formula_1 for formula_2

or

:formula_3

==Properties==
Over GF(2) the ESP - which then can be referred to as all one polynomial (AOP) - has many interesting properties, including:
* The Hamming weight of the ESP is &quot;m&quot; + 1.

A 1-ESP is known as an all one polynomial (AOP) and has additional properties including the above.

<doc id="1032176" wikidata="Q313190" url="?curid=1032176" title="René Clément">
<text>René Clément (; 18 March 1913 – 17 March 1996) was a French film director and screenwriter. He is known for directing the films &quot;The Battle of the Rails&quot; (1946), &quot;Forbidden Games&quot; (1952), &quot;Gervaise&quot; (1956), &quot;Purple Noon&quot; (1960), and &quot;Is Paris Burning&quot; (1966). He received numerous accolades including five prizes at the Cannes Film Festival and the Honorary César in 1984.

==Early life==
Clément studied architecture at the École des Beaux-Arts where he developed an interest in filmmaking. In 1936, he directed his first film, a 20-minute short written by and featuring Jacques Tati. Clément spent the latter part of the 1930s making documentaries in parts of the Middle East and Africa. In 1937, he and archaeologist Jules Barthou were in Yemen making preparations to film a documentary, the first ever of that country and one that includes the only known film image of Imam Yahya.

== Career ==
Almost ten years passed before Clément directed a feature but his French Resistance film, &quot;La Bataille du rail&quot; (1945), gained much critical and commercial success. From there Clément became one of his country&#x27;s most successful and respected directors, garnering numerous awards including two films that won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, the first in 1950 for &quot;The Walls of Malapaga&quot; (&quot;Au-delà des grilles&quot;) and the second time two years later for &quot;Forbidden Games&quot; (&quot;Jeux interdits&quot;). Clément had international success with several films but his star-studded 1966 epic &quot;Is Paris Burning?&quot;, written by Gore Vidal and Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Paul Graetz was a costly box office failure.

He began directing &quot;Play Dirty&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Written in the Sand&quot;) but quit early in production due to disputes with the film&#x27;s producer Harry Saltzman. He directed the thriller &quot;Joy House&quot; (1964) with Jane Fonda and Alain Delon. 

In May 2023 On &quot;Watch What Happens Live!&quot; with Andy Cohen, Fonda alleged that Clément sexually harassed her during the film&#x27;s production telling her that the film involved a love scene and that she needed to sleep with him so that he could judge her orgasm. During the production he was 51 and she was 27.

In 1973 he was a member of the jury at the 8th Moscow International Film Festival. Clément continued to make a few films until his retirement in 1975, including an international success with &quot;Rider on the Rain&quot; that starred Charles Bronson and Marlène Jobert. In 1984 the French motion picture industry honored his lifetime contribution to film with a special César Award.

== Personal life ==
Clément&#x27;s second wife was Irish screenwriter Johanna Harwood whom he had met on the set of his 1954 film &quot;Monsieur Ripois&quot;.

== Death ==
Clément died on 17 March 1996, a day before his 83rd birthday, and was buried in the local cemetery in Menton on the French Riviera where he had spent his years in retirement.

<doc id="1032177" wikidata="Q218862" url="?curid=1032177" title="Kōzō Okamoto">
<text>is a Japanese communist and member of the Japanese Red Army (JRA), responsible for the massacre of 26 passengers at Ben-Gurion International Airport in Israel.

==Biography==
Kozo Okamoto is the youngest child of a school principal. His older brother is Takeshi Okamoto, a member of the Red Army Faction, which hijacked an airliner in March 1970 to North Korea. He was a 24-year-old botany student when he was recruited to the Japanese Red Army. He was later detained in Lebanon. During his stay in Lebanon, Okamoto converted to Islam. He later requested to convert to Judaism while he was in an Israeli prison.

==Lod Airport massacre==

On May 30, 1972, Kōzō Okamoto along with Yasuyuki Yasuda, and Tsuyoshi Okudaira, landed at Israel&#x27;s Lod Airport via Air France Flight 132 from Rome. The name in Okamoto&#x27;s forged passport was Daisuke Namba, Crown Prince Hirohito&#x27;s would be assassin. After disembarking from the plane the three members of the JRA proceeded to the baggage claim area. Upon retrieving their luggage, they took out automatic weapons packed inside the suitcases and opened fire on other passengers in the baggage claim area.

The attack was a joint operation of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – External Operations (PFLP-EO), and the Japanese Red Army. The idea behind the joint effort was for the JRA to carry out attacks for the PLFP, and &quot;vice versa&quot;, in order to reduce suspicion. The plan worked, as Okamoto and his comrades attracted little attention prior to their attack.

Okamoto and his comrades killed 26 people and wounded 80 more. Seventeen of the victims were Christian pilgrims from Puerto Rico.

Yasuyuki Yasuda was accidentally shot dead by one of the other attackers. Tsuyoshi Okudaira was killed by one of his own grenades, either due to premature detonation or a suicide. Kōzō Okamoto was wounded and captured trying to escape the terminal.

==Trial and release==
Okamoto was put on trial in an Israeli military court under the 1948 Emergency Regulations. His court-appointed lawyers were Max Kritzman and David Rotlevy; Kritzman, who was chief lawyer, had experience defending Israelis charged under the Emergency Regulations. Of Okamoto, he complained that &quot;this man will not cooperate&quot;. Okamoto pleaded guilty, ensuring that he did not get sentenced to death. He also protested his attorneys&#x27; requests for a psychiatric evaluation. In his final statement Okamoto told the court: &quot;When I was a child, I was told that when people died they became stars...We three Red Army soldiers wanted to become Orion when we died&quot;.

Okamoto was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment in Israel. During the incarceration, he requested to convert to Judaism and tried to circumcise himself with nail clippers. He stated that he was tortured during his imprisonment, being &quot;forced to eat like a dog&quot; and emerged from imprisonment emaciated. 

On July 20, 1973, PFLP and JRA operatives hijacked Japan Air Lines Flight 404, demanding Okamoto&#x27;s release in exchange for the hostages on board; Israel refused to comply. Okamoto was released in 1985 after 13 years in prison, as part of the Jibril Agreement, a prisoner exchange with Palestinian militant factions for captive Israeli soldiers. After his release from prison in Israel, Kōzō Okamoto moved to Libya, then Syria, and finally to Lebanon where he reunited with other members of the Japanese Red Army. As of 2012 Okamoto was believed to be living in Lebanon.

==Asylum in Lebanon==
On February 15, 1997, Lebanon detained five Red Army members, Haruo Wakō, Masao Adachi, Mariko Yamamoto, Kazuo Tohira and Okamoto for using forged passports and visa violations. They were sentenced to three years in prison. The sentence was passed by Judge Soheil Abdul-Shams on July 31, 1997. After their prison term was completed, the four other members of the JRA were forcibly deported to Jordan and from Amman, Jordan via a chartered Russian plane to Japan. The Lebanese government, however, granted political asylum to Okamoto because, according to the Lebanese government, he &quot;had participated in resistance operations against Israel and had been tortured in Israeli jails&quot;.

Okamoto is still wanted by the Japanese police and Japan has requested his extradition. , he was reported to be living in a refugee camp near Beirut.

In May 2017, Okamoto gave an interview to the &quot;Mainichi Shimbun&quot; in Beirut. He said &quot;I want to return to Japan once&quot;.

On May 30, 2022, Okamoto appeared at a ceremony in Beirut marking the 50th anniversary of the attack, laying a wreath on the graves of his fellow JRA militants and posing for photos with PFLP supporters.

<doc id="1032180" wikidata="Q965064" url="?curid=1032180" title="Picture Transfer Protocol">
<text>Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) is a protocol originally developed by the Photographic and Imaging Manufacturers Association (PIMA) (later known as the International Imaging Industry Association) to allow the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripheral devices without the need for additional device drivers. The protocol was standardized by the ISO in 2005. The current version of the standard is ISO 15740:2013.

It is further standardized for USB by the USB Implementers Forum as the &quot;still image capture device class&quot;. USB is the default network transport media for PTP devices. USB PTP is a common alternative to the USB mass-storage device class (USB MSC), as a digital camera connection protocol. Some cameras support both modes.

==Description==
PTP specifies a way of creating, transferring and manipulating &quot;objects&quot; which are typically photographic images such as a JPEG file. While it is common to think of the objects that PTP handle as files, they are abstract entities identified solely by a 32-bit object ID. These objects can however have &quot;parents&quot; and &quot;siblings&quot; so that a file-system–like view of device contents can be created.

==History==
Until the standardization of PTP, digital camera vendors used different proprietary protocols for controlling digital cameras and transferring images to computers and other host devices. In an earlier but unrelated project, the term &quot;Picture Transfer Protocol&quot; and the acronym &quot;PTP&quot; were both coined by Steve Mann, summarizing work on the creation of a Linux-friendly way of transferring pictures to and from home-made wearable computers, at a time when most cameras required the use of Microsoft Windows or Mac OS device drivers to transfer their pictures to a computer.

PTP was originally standardized as PIMA 15470 in 2000, while it was developed by the IT10 committee. Key contributors to the standard included Tim Looney and Tim Whitcher (Eastman Kodak Company) and Eran Steinberg (Fotonation).

==Storage==
PTP does not specify a way for objects to be stored – it is a communication protocol. Nor does it specify a transport layer. However, it is designed to support existing standards, such as Exif, TIFF/EP, DCF, and DPOF, and is commonly implemented over the USB and FireWire transport layers.

Images on digital cameras are generally stored as files on a mass storage device, such as a memory card, which is formatted with a file system, most commonly FAT12, FAT16 or FAT32, which may be laid out as per the Design rule for Camera File system (DCF) specification. But none of these are required as PTP abstracts from the underlying representation.

By contrast, if a camera is mounted via USB MSC, the physical file system and layout are exposed to the user.

==Device control==
Many modern digital cameras from Canon and Nikon can be controlled via PTP from a USB host enabled computing device (smartphone, PC or Arduino for example). As is the norm for PTP, the communication takes place over a USB connection. When interacting with the camera in this manner, it is expected that the USB endpoints are in (synchronous) Bulk Transfer Mode, for getting/setting virtually all the camera&#x27;s features/properties (such as ISO, Aperture, Shutter speed and focus). Events raised by the camera, in response to specific actions performed by the host device, are sent back to the host via the USB asynchronous Interrupt endpoint.

In addition to changing the camera&#x27;s settings and operating mode, it is possible to receive a through-the-lens view using &quot;Live View&quot;. As described above, the storage objects of the camera&#x27;s memory cards can be manipulated too.

By controlling a camera in this way it is possible to augment its capabilities. For example, if the controlling software was running on a smartphone with GPS functionality, it would be possible to add the GPS coordinates to an image&#x27;s Exif data, at the time of image capture — even if the camera itself had no GPS functionality.

==Extensions==
A number of protocols have been developed that extend PTP. PTP/IP, developed by FotoNation and first implemented in a round of Wi-Fi digital cameras by Nikon, Canon, and Eastman Kodak, allows data transfer over any IP-based network. A vendor extension registry for PTP is maintained by the Society for Imaging Science and Engineering (IS&amp;T).

Media Transfer Protocol (MTP), developed by Microsoft, allows for transfer over wireless or wired networks based in part on FotoNation&#x27;s PTP/IP, but also allows users to transfer other media aside from pictures, as well as for tagging objects with extended metadata (such as title, artist and similar metadata).

==Operating system support==
Microsoft Windows has supported PTP from Windows ME onwards (excluding Windows CE). Microsoft implements PTP on Windows through Windows Image Acquisition. A disadvantage of PTP on Windows as compared to USB mass storage is that Windows does not assign drive letters to PTP devices, so image files on them cannot be manipulated by scripts or standard Windows programs, only by Windows Explorer or applications with specially written PTP support. Also, Windows Explorer does not display file modification timestamps (though these are available via the file Properties popup).

PTP on Linux and other free and open-source operating systems is supported by a number of libraries, such as libgphoto and libptp, used by applications such as digiKam and F-Spot. As on Microsoft Windows there is no native support on Linux, but by means of GVfs the devices can easily be mounted and made available to applications that use standard POSIX commands and library functions.

Android supports PTP, so that software programs that support grabbing photos from a digital camera will support grabbing photos from an Android phone when you select the PTP mode. As with MTP, a limitation is that when transferring photos from a computer to the Android device, file timestamps are replaced with the time of the copy. For copies from the Android device to a computer however, the timestamps are preserved.

==Version 1.11==
PTP v1.11 (ISO 15740:2013) is a minor revision to PTP v1.1 (ISO 15740:2008). Both the 2008 and 2013 versions of PTP are fully backward-compatible with PTP v1.0 (ISO 15740:2005), and offer optional performance, compatibility, and feature enhancements including:
* A mechanism for handling streaming content
* A mechanism to support multiple vendor extension sets
* Support for objects larger than the 4GiB size limit set by PTP v1.0, by requiring 64 bits (8 bytes) for object size
* Support for retrieval of &quot;ObjectHandles&quot; in enumerated chunks. This may reduce long response times for some devices that possess large numbers of objects
* Support for arbitrary resizing prior to image transmission (responder scaling). In PTP v1.0, image sizes might be requested in full-resolution or thumbnail size only
* Support for arrays of datasets. This can be used to reduce the number of required transactions necessary for device characterization from being a function of the number of objects on the device down to one
* A fast file characterization operation that exploits dataset arrays to request, in a single transaction, only the minimum data required to characterize a typical filesystem
* A new standard &quot;ObjectFormatCode&quot; to support the Digital Negative (DNG) file format

==Drawbacks==
* Renaming file objects directly is not possible without copying or rewriting them
* Modification of file contents is not supported (the file needs to be re-transferred completely)
* Some drawbacks are OS-specific — see

<doc id="1032186" wikidata="Q645118" url="?curid=1032186" title="Phanariots">
<text>Phanariots, Phanariotes, or Fanariots (, , ) were members of prominent Greek families in Phanar (Φανάρι, modern &quot;Fener&quot;), the chief Greek quarter of Constantinople where the Ecumenical Patriarchate is located, who traditionally occupied four important positions in the Ottoman Empire: Hospodar of Moldavia, Hospodar of Wallachia, Grand Dragoman of the Porte and Grand Dragoman of the Fleet. Despite their cosmopolitanism and often-Western education, the Phanariots were aware of their Greek ancestry and culture; according to Nicholas Mavrocordatos&#x27; &quot;Philotheou Parerga&quot;, &quot;We are a race completely Hellenic&quot;.

They emerged as a class of wealthy Greek merchants (of mostly noble Byzantine descent) during the second half of the 16th century, and were influential in the administration of the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s Balkan domains in the 18th century. The Phanariots usually built their houses in the Phanar quarter to be near the court of the Patriarch, who (under the Ottoman millet system) was recognized as the spiritual and secular head (&quot;millet-bashi&quot;) of the Orthodox subjects—the Rum Millet, or &quot;Roman nation&quot; of the empire, except those under the spiritual care of the Patriarchs of Antioch, Jerusalem, Alexandria, Ohrid and Peć—often acting as archontes of the Ecumenical See. They dominated the administration of the patriarchate, often intervening in the selection of hierarchs (including the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople).

==Overview==
Many members of Phanariot families (who had acquired great wealth and influence during the 17th century) occupied high political and administrative posts in the Ottoman Empire. From 1669 until the Greek War of Independence in 1821, Phanariots made up the majority of the dragomans to the Ottoman government (the Porte) and foreign embassies due to the Greeks&#x27; higher level of education than the general Ottoman population. With the church dignitaries, local notables from the provinces and the large Greek merchant class, Phanariots represented the better-educated members of Greek society during Ottoman rule until the 1821 start of the Greek War of Independence. During the war, Phanariots influenced decisions by the Greek National Assembly (the representative body of Greek revolutionaries, which met six times between 1821 and 1829). Between 1711–1716 and 1821, a number of Phanariots were appointed Hospodars (voivodes or princes) in the Danubian Principalities (Moldavia and Wallachia) (usually as a promotion from the offices of Dragoman of the Fleet and Dragoman of the Porte); the period is known as the Phanariot epoch in Romanian history.

==Ottoman Empire==

After the fall of Constantinople, Mehmet II deported the city&#x27;s Christian population, leaving only the Jewish inhabitants of Balat, repopulating the city with Christians and Muslims from throughout the whole empire and the newly conquered territories. Phanar was repopulated with Greeks from Mouchlion in the Peloponnese and, after 1461, with citizens of the Empire of Trebizond.

The roots of Greek ascendancy can be traced to the Ottoman need for skilled, educated negotiators as their empire declined and they relied on treaties rather than force. During the 17th century, the Ottomans began having problems in foreign relations and difficulty dictating terms to their neighbours; for the first time, the Porte needed to participate in diplomatic negotiations.

With the Ottomans traditionally ignoring Western European languages and cultures, officials were at a loss. The Porte assigned those tasks to the Greeks, who had a long mercantile and educational tradition and the necessary skills. The Phanariots and other Greek as well as Hellenized families primarily from Constantinople, occupied high posts as secretaries and interpreters for Ottoman officials.

===Diplomats and patriarchs===
As a result of Phanariot and ecclesiastical administration, the Greeks expanded their influence in the 18th-century empire while retaining their Greek Orthodox faith and Hellenism. This had not always been the case in the Ottoman realm. During the 16th century, the South Slavs—the most prominent in imperial affairs—converted to Islam to enjoy the full rights of Ottoman citizenship (especially in the Eyalet of Bosnia; Serbs tended to occupy high military positions.

A Slavic presence in Ottoman administration gradually became hazardous for its rulers, since the Slavs tended to support Habsburg armies during the Great Turkish War. By the 17th century the Greek Patriarch of Constantinople was the religious and administrative ruler of the empire&#x27;s Orthodox subjects, regardless of ethnic background. All formerly-independent Orthodox patriarchates, including the Serbian Patriarchate renewed in 1557, came under the authority of the Greek Orthodox Church. Most of the Greek patriarchs were drawn from the Phanariots.

Two Greek social groups emerged, challenging the leadership of the Greek Church: the Phanariots in Constantinople and the local notables in the Helladic provinces (&quot;kodjabashis&quot;, &quot;dimogerontes&quot; and &quot;prokritoi&quot;). According to 19th-century Greek historian Constantine Paparrigopoulos, the Phanariots initially sought the most important secular offices of the patriarchal court and could frequently intervene in the election of bishops and influence crucial decisions by the patriarch. Greek merchants and clergy of Byzantine aristocratic origin, who acquired economic and political influence and were later known as Phanariots, settled in extreme northwestern Constantinople (which had become central to Greek interests after the establishment of the patriarch&#x27;s headquarters in 1461, shortly after Hagia Sophia was converted into a mosque).
====Patriarchate====
After the 1453 fall of Constantinople, when the Sultan replaced &quot;de jure&quot; the Byzantine Emperor for subjugated Christians, he recognized the Ecumenical Patriarch as the religious and national leader (&quot;ethnarch&quot;) of the Greeks and other ethnic groups in the Greek Orthodox &quot;Millet&quot;. The Patriarchate had primary importance, occupying this key role for Christians of the Empire because the Ottomans did not legally distinguish between nationality and religion and considered the empire&#x27;s Orthodox Christians a single entity.

The position of the Patriarchate in the Ottoman state encouraged Greek renaissance projects centering on the resurrection and revitalization of the Byzantine Empire. The Patriarch and his church dignitaries constituted the first centre of power for the Greeks in the Ottoman state, which infiltrated Ottoman structures and attracted the former Byzantine nobility.

===Merchant middle class===
The wealth of the extensive Greek merchant class provided the material basis for the intellectual revival featured in Greek life for more than half a century before 1821. Greek merchants endowed libraries and schools. On the eve of the Greek War of Independence, the three most important centres of Greek learning (schools-cum-universities) were in the commercial centres of Chios, Smyrna and Aivali. The first Greek millionaire of the Ottoman era was Michael &quot;Şeytanoğlu&quot; Kantakouzenos, who earned 60,000 ducats a year from his control of the fur trade from Muscovy.

===Civil servants===
During the 18th century, the Phanariots were a hereditary clerical−aristocratic group who managed the affairs of the patriarchate and the dominant political power of the Ottoman Greek community. They became a significant political factor in the empire and, as diplomatic agents, played a role in the affairs of Great Britain, France and the Russian Empire.

The Phanariots competed for the most important administrative offices in the Ottoman administration; these included collecting imperial taxes, monopolies on commerce, working under contract in a number of enterprises, supplying the court and ruling the Danubian Principalities. They engaged in private trade, controlling the crucial wheat trade on the Black Sea. The Phanariots expanded their commercial activities into the Kingdom of Hungary and then to the other Central European states. Their activities intensified their contacts with Western nations, and they became familiar with Western languages and cultures.

Before the beginning of the Greek War of Independence, the Phanariots were firmly established as the political elite of Hellenism. According to Greek historian Constantine Paparrigopoulos, this was a natural evolution given the Phanariots&#x27; education and experience in supervising large parts of the empire. According to Nikos Svoronos argued, the Phanariots subordinated their national identity to their class identity and tried to peacefully co−exist with the Ottomans; they did not enrich the Greek national identity and lost ground to groups which flourished through their confrontation with the Ottoman Empire (the &quot;klephts&quot; and &quot;armatoloi&quot;).

==Danubian Principalities==

A Greek presence had established itself in both Danubian Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia, resulting in the appointment of Greek princes before the 18th century. After the Phanariot era, some Phanariot families in Wallachia and Moldavia identified themselves as Romanian in Romanian society (including the Rosetti family; C. A. Rosetti represented the radical, nationalist cause during and after the 1848 Wallachian revolution.).

Phanariot attention focused on occupying the most favorable offices the empire could offer non-Muslims and the principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia, which were still relatively rich and—more importantly—autonomous (despite having to pay tribute as vassal states). Many Greeks had found favorable conditions there for commercial activities, in comparison with the Ottoman Empire, and an opportunity for political power; they entered Wallachian and Moldavian boyar nobility by marriage.

Reigns of local princes were not excluded on principle. Several hellenized Romanian noble families, such as the Callimachis (originally &quot;Călmașul&quot;), the Racovițăs and the Albanian Ghicas penetrated the Phanar nucleus to increase their chances of occupying the thrones and maintain their positions.

Most sources agree that 1711 was when the gradual erosion of traditional institutions reached its zenith, but characteristics ascribed to the Phanariot era had made themselves felt long before it. The Ottomans enforced their choice of hospodars as far back as the 15th century, and foreign (usually Greek or Levantine) boyars competed with local ones since the late 16th century. Rulers since Dumitraşcu Cantacuzino in Moldavia and George Ducas (a prince of Greek origin) in Wallachia, both in 1673, were forced to surrender their family members as hostages in Constantinople. The traditional elective system in the principalities, resulting in long periods of political disorder, was dominated by a small number of ambitious families who competed violently for the two thrones and monopolized land ownership.

===1711–1715===
A change in policy was indicated by the fact that autonomous Wallachia and Moldavia had entered a period of skirmishes with the Ottomans, due to the insubordination of local princes associated with the rise of Imperial Russia&#x27;s power under Peter the Great and the firm presence of the Habsburg Empire on the Carpathian border with the principalities. Dissidence in the two countries became dangerous for the Turks, who were confronted with the attraction on the population of protection by a fellow Eastern Orthodox state. This became obvious with Mihai Racoviță&#x27;s second rule in Moldavia, when the prince plotted with Peter to have Ottoman rule overthrown. His replacement, Nicholas Mavrocordatos, was the first official Phanariot in his second reign in Moldavia and replaced Ștefan Cantacuzino in Wallachia as the first Phanariot ruler of that country.

A crucial moment was the Russo−Turkish War of 1710−1713, when Dimitrie Cantemir sided with Russia and agreed to Russian tutelage of his country. After Russia experienced a major defeat and Cantemir went into exile, the Ottomans took charge of the succession to the throne of Moldavia. This was followed by similar measures in Wallachia, prompted by Ștefan Cantacuzino&#x27;s alliance with Habsburg commander Prince Eugene of Savoy in the closing stages of the Great Turkish War.

===Rulers and retinues===
The person raised to the office of prince was usually the chief dragoman of the Porte, well-versed in contemporary politics and Ottoman statecraft. The new prince, who obtained his office in exchange for a generous bribe, proceeded to the country he was selected to govern (whose language he usually did not know). When the new princes were appointed, they were escorted to Iași or Bucharest by retinues composed of their families, favourites and creditors (from whom they had borrowed the bribes). The prince and his appointees counted on recouping these in as short a time as possible, amassing an amount sufficient to live on after their brief time in office.

Thirty-one princes, from eleven families, ruled the two principalities during the Phanariot epoch. When the choice became limited to a few families due to princely disloyalty to the Porte, rulers would be moved from one principality to the other; the prince of Wallachia (the richer of the two principalities) would pay to avert his transfer to Iaşi, and the prince of Moldavia would bribe supporters in Constantinople to appoint him to Wallachia. Constantine Mavrocordatos ruled a total of ten times in Moldavia and Wallachia. The debt was owed to several creditors, rather than to the Sultan; the central institutions of the Ottoman Empire generally seemed determined to maintain their rule over the principalities and not exploit them irrationally. In an early example, Ahmed III paid part of Nicholas Mavrocordatos&#x27; sum.

===Administration and boyars===
The Phanariot epoch was initially characterized by fiscal policies driven by Ottoman needs and the ambitions of some hospodars, who (mindful of their fragile status) sought to pay back their creditors and increase their wealth while in a position of power. To make the reigns lucrative while raising funds to satisfy the needs of the Porte, princes channeled their energies into taxing the inhabitants into destitution. The most odious taxes (such as the &quot;văcărit&quot; first imposed by Iancu Sasul in the 1580s), mistakenly identified with the Phanariots in modern Romanian historiography, were much older.

The mismanagement of many Phanariot rulers contrasts with the achievements and projects of others, such as Constantine Mavrocordatos (who abolished serfdom in Wallachia in 1746 and Moldavia in 1749) and Alexander Ypsilantis, who were inspired by Habsburg serf policy. Ypsilantis tried to reform legislation and impose salaries for administrative offices in an effort to halt the depletion of funds the administrators, local and Greek alike, were using for their own maintenance; it was, by then, more profitable to hold office than to own land. His &quot;Pravilniceasca condică&quot;, a relatively modern legal code, met stiff boyar resistance.

The focus of such rules was often the improvement of state structure against conservative wishes. Contemporary documents indicate that, despite the change in leadership and boyar complaints, about 80 percent of those seated in the Divan (an institution roughly equivalent to the estates of the realm) were members of local families. This made endemic the social and economic issues of previous periods, since the inner circle of boyars blocked initiatives (such as Alexander Ypsilantis&#x27;) and obtained, extended and preserved tax exemptions.

== Russian influence ==
The Phanariots copied Russian and Habsburg institutions; during the mid-18th century they made noble rank dependent on state service, as Peter I of Russia did. After the Treaty of Kuchuk-Kainarji (1774) allowed Russia to intervene on the side of Ottoman Eastern Orthodox subjects, most of the Porte&#x27;s tools of political pressure became ineffective. They had to offer concessions to maintain a hold on the countries as economic and strategic assets. The treaty made any increase in tribute impossible, and between 1774 and the 1820s it plummeted from about 50,000 to 20,000 gold coins (equivalent to Austrian gold currency) in Wallachia and to 3,100 in Moldavia.

Immediately afterward, Russia forcefully used its new prerogative. The deposition of Constantine Ypsilantis (in Wallachia) and Alexander Mourousis (in Moldavia) by Selim III, called on by French Empire&#x27;s ambassador to the Ottoman Empire Horace Sébastiani (whose fears of pro−Russian conspiracies in Bucharest were partially confirmed), was the &quot;casus belli&quot; for the 1806–1812 conflict, and Russian general Mikhail Andreyevich Miloradovich swiftly reinstated Ypsilantis during his military expedition to Wallachia.

Such gestures began a period of effective Russian supervision, culminating with the Organic Statute administration of the 1830s. The Danubian principalities grew in strategic importance with the Napoleonic Wars and the decline of the Ottoman Empire, as European states became interested in halting Russian southward expansion (which included the 1812 annexation of Bessarabia). New consulates in the two countries&#x27; capitals, ensuring the observation of developments in Russian−Ottoman relations, had an indirect impact on the local economy as rival diplomats began awarding protection and &quot;sudit&quot; status to merchants competing with local guilds. Nicholas I of Russia pressured Wallachia and Moldavia into granting constitutions (in 1831 and 1832, respectively) to weaken native rulers.

The boyars began a petition campaign against the princes in power; addressed to the Porte and the Habsburg monarchy, they primarily demanded Russian supervision. Although they referred to incidents of corruption and misrule, the petitions indicate their signers&#x27; conservatism. The boyars tend to refer to (fictitious) &quot;capitulations&quot; which either principality would have signed with the Ottomans, demanding that rights guaranteed through them be restored. They viewed reform attempts by princes as illegitimate; in alternative proposals (usually in the form of constitutional projects), the boyars expressed desire for an aristocratic republic.

==Greek War of Independence and legacy==

The active part taken by Greek princes in revolts after 1820 and the disorder provoked by the Filiki Eteria (of which the Ghica, Văcărescu and Golescu families were active members after its uprising against the Ottoman Empire in Moldavia and Tudor Vladimirescu&#x27;s Wallachian uprising) led to the disappearance of promotions from the Phanar community; the Greeks were no longer trusted by the Porte. Amid tense relations between boyars and princes, Vladimirescu&#x27;s revolt was primarily the result of compromise between Oltenian pandurs and the regency of boyars attempting to block the ascension of Scarlat Callimachi (the last Phanariot ruler in Bucharest). Ioan Sturdza&#x27;s rule in Moldavia and Grigore IV Ghica&#x27;s in Wallachia are considered the first of the new period, although the new regime abruptly ended in Russian occupation during another Russo−Turkish War and the subsequent period of Russian influence.

Most Phanariots were patrons of Greek culture, education and printing. They founded academies which attracted teachers and pupils from throughout the Orthodox commonwealth, and there was awareness of intellectual trends in Habsburg Europe. Many of the Phanariot princes were capable, farsighted rulers. As prince of Wallachia in 1746 and Moldavia in 1749, Constantine Mavrocordatos abolished serfdom and Alexander Ypsilantis of Wallachia (reigned 1774–1782) initiated extensive administrative and legal reforms. Ipsilanti&#x27;s reign coincided with subtle shifts in economic and social life and the emergence of spiritual and intellectual aspirations which pointed to the West and reform.

Condemnation of the Phanariots is a focus of Romanian nationalism, usually integrated into a general resentment of foreigners. The tendency unifies pro− and anti−modernisation attitudes; Phanariot Greeks are painted as reactionary elements (by Communist Romania) and agents of brutal, opportunistic change (as in Mihai Eminescu&#x27;s &quot;Scrisoarea a III-a&quot;).

<text>Fan Changjiang (; 6 October 1909 – 23 October 1970), born Fan Xitian (范希天), was a Chinese journalist, war correspondent, and writer. One of the most famous wartime reporters during World War II, he had become well known for his reporting during the 1936 battles in Inner Mongolia and his interview with Mao Zedong in 1937. Fan was persecuted during the Cultural Revolution and committed suicide in 1970.

==Biography==

=== Early life ===
Fan was born in Sichuan Province and educated at Peking University.

=== Journalism career ===
Fan started his career as a journalist in 1933. He was sent to the northwest of China by &quot;Ta Kung Pao&quot; as a string correspondent in 1935. At that time, he editorialized a series of news which sensationalized the public. These pieces of news were later anthologized in a book called &quot;Northwest China&quot; (). In this book, he described the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), the activities of Red Army and the Long March. Besides that, Fan Changjiang showed his determination and strong animosity towards feudalism warlords, rich landowners and bad scholars in this book. Meanwhile, he concerned with the development of China&#x27;s future and also sympathized those who suffered from the political turmoil.

In 1936, when the political scene became chaotic and the Chinese Civil War began, he went to the Inner Mongolia. In December, when the famous Xi&#x27;an Incident broke out, Fan grasped the opportunity to interview Zhou Enlai at the risk of his life. Zhou was amazed by his studies and analyses when he read his journals.

Later on, he went to Shaanxi province Yan&#x27;an to have a personal conversation with Mao Zedong. This interview paved the way for Fan&#x27;s future career as a journalist. When he returned to Shanghai, he published his viewpoints on the anti-Japanese movement and it was well accepted by the public. At that time, he was the first journalist who reported on the Red Terror in China.

On November 8, 1937, Fan established the Chinese Young Journalists Association () with Yang Zao () and Xu Maijin () and was elected as the chief executive officer of the association. In the same year, he co-founded the International News Association (國際新聞社) with Hu Yuzhi in Changsha.

In 1939, he joined the CCP and was one of the people who established &quot;Hua Shang Daily&quot; (華商) in Hong Kong. He also took up the posts of the principal of Huangzhong Journalism College (), chairman of Huangzhong Branch of the Xinhua News Agency and Huangzhong Post of &quot;Xinhua Daily&quot;.

In July 1949, he established the All-China Journalists Association with Hu Qiaomu and many other famous journalists. He was the chief editor of the Xinhua News Agency, chairman of &quot;Jiefang Daily&quot; and People&#x27;s Daily.

In 1991, the &quot;Fan Changjiang Journalism Awards&quot; were established by the Chinese Journalists Association Committee in order to encourage young journalists in China.

===Fan&#x27;s posts and his careers===
In addition to being an award-winning journalist, Fan was also considered a good leader by others. He held various official posts, such as:

# President of Huangzhong Journalism College in 1939
# Chairman of Huangzhong Branch of Xinhua News Agency in 1939
# Chairman of Huangzhong Post of &quot;Xinhua Daily&quot; in 1939
# Chief editor of Xinhua News Agency in 1949
# President of &quot;Jiefang Daily&quot; and &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; in 1949
# Vice-chancellor of the General Administration of Press and Publication
# Vice-secretary of the State Council Committee of Culture and Education (政務院文化教育委員會副秘書長)
# Second director of office of the State Council of the People&#x27;s Republic of China
# Vice minister in charge of the Commission for Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense

==Ideology==
===Ideology in newspaper aspect===
In the book, &quot;Communication and essay&quot;, Fan believed that newspaper was a political tool. It was the basic principle of journalism. A journalist should not fear to discuss politics, should not tend to avoid politics. More importantly, journalist should not violate era. In addition, Fan suggested that if there were correct politics to make instructions, the news work would be an important power to accelerate the advancement of the society.

===Obligation to tell the truth===
Fan had a clear political and journalistic stand. When he was young, he was greatly influenced by the revolutionary movement and joined series of anti-imperialism movements. He was almost sent to death in the Chongqing Massacre. But this experience further strengthened his ideology which was to seek and report the truth. He believed that honesty should be the most important element of being a journalist.

===Political views===
Fan believed that journalists should support the reforms and determine to be loyal to the CC. The public should not fear danger and harshness but have incentive to learn and think. He even became a communist journalist and joined CCP after he left &quot;Ta Kung Pao&quot;. He was strongly against the capitalist class and supported communism.

===Loyalty to citizens===
As described before, Fan wrote a series of articles disclosing the north-west rotten policy, the secret agreements and the hidden side of the red army. What he wanted to show to the people was the urgent need for revolution. He insisted that all his reports and articles should let the people know what was happening in their country.

===Views on journalism===
Fan claimed that a reporter who intended to write excellent journal articles, one must get himself involved in the public. He thought that journalism was the fact of what people want to know and what people should know but had not known. Fan said &quot;This is a thought which is not very across the board, but it does penetrate a spirit to serve the public. As a reporter or journalist, we should always learn to examine the problems and issues raised up by the public and citizens which means to learn what you report. We should also learn the technique of writing by being aware of the response of the public. If the article is not related to the public, there is always no response or voice. Public is considered as the source of journalism, so newspaper should always think of ways to let reporters and journalists get connected to it.&quot;

==Fan and journalism in China==

As the president of the Chinese Journalists Association Committee, Fan focused on the overall development of journalism in China. He once said, &quot;A telegraph, a letter or a news article influence the attitude of the readers towards the war. It influences the feeling of soldiers in the frontier and the morale of workers at the back.&quot; Fan emphasized that journalism played an extremely important role during war. He requested all the journalists to have respectable personality, important sense of responsibility and outstanding quality in news reporting. Fan also pointed out the importance of strengthening self-education as well as the promotion of noble-quality with combinations of present political, social and journalistic environment for young journalists.

===Famous journals of Fan===
After his journey to Xi&#x27;an and Yan&#x27;an, he was employed by &quot;Da Gong Bao&quot; as a reporter. At that period of time, he wrote a lot of articles such as 
* &quot;Cong Jiayushuo Dao Shanhaiguan&quot; (&quot;From Jiayu Pass to Shanhai Pass&quot;《從嘉峪說到山海關》 )
* &quot;Bailingmiao Zhan Hou Hang&quot; (&quot;The War in Bailingmiao&quot; 《百靈廟戰後行》)
* &quot;Yi Xi Meng&quot;《憶西蒙》
On 7 July 1937, the Marco Polo Bridge Incident broke out. Fan went there to investigate the event. He went to Lugouqiao, Changxindian, etc. Fan wrote plenty of battlefield communications including 
* &quot;Beside the Lugouqiao&quot;《盧溝橋畔》
* &quot;Xi Xian Feng Yun&quot;《西線風雲》
* &quot;Shiue Bo Ping Jin&quot;《血泊平津》
After &quot;China Young Journalists Association&quot; was founded, Fan went to the Tianjin–Pukou railway, where the Second Sino-Japanese War was the most fiercest, to report the event. He wrote a lot of communications to reveal the war situation and front tactical situation in Tai&#x27;erzhuang. Those communications were compiled and printed under the headline &quot;Breakthrough at Xuzhou&quot; (徐州突圍).

===China Young Journalists Association===
It was established by Fan and other journalists at Shanghai in 1937. The aim of this association was to unite all journalists at that time and to spread the message of protecting China against the Japanese. This association later became the All-China Journalists Association. The day of its establishment, November 8, has been proclaimed by the Central government and the CCP as &quot;Journalists&#x27; day&quot; (記者節) since 2000. This day serves as a reminder to Chinese people of the devotion and dedication of the former journalists.

===International News Association===
During the Sino-Japanese War, Fan Changjiang, Hu Yuzhi and other journalists founded the &quot;International News Association&quot; at Changsha in 1936. Fan was the president of this association at that time. It was a left-leaning press agency during the period that China was still under the ruling of Kuomintang. It had a legal news gathering and the right of reporting to release the news and reviews of the Sino-Japanese War to the newspaper publishers in mainland China and the rest of the world, especially the news of the CCP, the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army.

===Fan Changjiang Journalism Award===
The &quot;Fan Changjiang Journalism Award&quot; is one of the three national journalists awards (the other two are the Taofen Journalism Award and Top 100 Journalists) issued by the All-China Journalists Association (ACJA). This is a prize for middle-aged and young journalists. It is named after Fan for his bold and objective coverage of the Chinese Revolution led by the CCP against the Kuomintang regime. The award started in 1991. Since 2000, the award is issued by the ACJA every two years (with the other two awards simultaneously). In the first three &quot;Fan Changjiang Journalism Awards&quot;, 10 reporters would receive the award and 30 reporters would receive the nominated award each time. But the nominated awards were cancelled starting from the fourth Awards. The nominee should age below 50 and work in the field of formal journals, public newspapers, national press agency, authorized radio stations, television stations and other news agency, with a minimum of 10-years successive reporter experience.

==Fan and literature in China==
Fan Changjiang is considered as one of the most prominent journalists in Chinese history. He had written a huge number of outstanding news articles and taken up a lot of leading positions in this field. His style of writing are considered as very modern, righteous and vivid.

===&quot;Sai Shang Xing&quot;===
&quot;Sai Shang Xing&quot; (塞上行) is a book written by Fan Changjiang in 1937. The Xi&#x27;an Incident was a turning point in Chinese political history. At that time, Fan&#x27;s journey to Xi&#x27;an and Yan&#x27;an as a reporter had changed his political standpoint from a patriotic [journalist to a communist who fought for the proletariat. The release of his book &quot;The Journey to Northern Shaanxi&quot; (陝北之行) facilitated the understanding of Chinese citizens from different classes about the CCP and Red Army. It also spread out the idea of unity of the nation against Japan. It was the first time Fan got direct contact with the CCP and his mind got changed after talking to Mao Zedong overnight. Later, Mao even wrote two letters to Fan answering his questions concerning the topic about the unity of the nation against Japan. Mao also affirmed Fan&#x27;s news article on Xiabei. &quot;Sai Shang Xing&quot; is a book and a record of Fan&#x27;s change of his mind.

===&quot;Northwest China&quot;===
This book revealed the rotten policy in the north-west side. It also showed the hidden side of the red army and exposed all the secret agreements made among the leaders at that time. Fan definitely told people the truth. He wasn&#x27;t afraid of the pressures from the government and reported it in the book to express his concerns on the country. Hu Yuzhi commented that “it is an excellent work which shocks all the Chinese.”

===&quot;Communication and Essay&quot;===
In this book, Fan described the use of communications and essays clearly which not only gave a format and spirit to the youth journalists for reporting, but also for the writers have the sense of persuasive communication.

&quot;Collection of Fan Changjiang&#x27;s News Article&quot; was published in 1989. It contains some parts of the news articles written by Fan without editing. It focuses and respects on the original face of those records, just like Fan said in the preface that &quot;Journalists must respect history, must respect the reality&quot;.

==Fan and the Xi&#x27;an Incident in China==

On December 12, 1936, Xi&#x27;an Incident broke out in China during the invasion of Japan and nationalist-communist confrontation (1927-1936), which had great effects on political and military aspects. Fan Changjiang, as a reporter, headed to Xi&#x27;an in order to unveil the situation to the public. He said, &#x27;I determined to go to Xi&#x27;an to unveil the truth of China&#x27;s politics at all costs.&#x27; He gained the insight into the current affairs. Fan went there alone to find out the mysteries of Xi&#x27;an Incident.

On February 4, 1937, Fan was finally permitted to interview CCP negotiator Zhou Enlai, who would become the first premier of People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1954. Zhou told him all the details about Xi&#x27;an Incident, such as the reasons of the incident, the ideas of the CCP and the important issues about defensing the country against Japan. All these information had made Fan&#x27;s articles even more accurate and in-depth.

Later, with the permission of Zhou, Fan went to Yan&#x27;an with great welcome for further details or even investigation. In Yan&#x27;an, he visited the &quot;Red Army University&quot; (紅軍大學) and interviewed some senior and important officers in the CCP, for example, Lin Biao, Liao Chengzhi and Zhu De, especially the first chairman of People&#x27;s Republic of China, Mao Zedong on February 9.

Fan told Mao that he wanted to stay in northern Shaanxi; in order to get more information about CCP, so that he could write a few book on them to propagate the party ideology. However, Mao pointed out that the most important thing was to utilize the important position of &quot;Ta Kung Pao&quot; in the public to propagate the ideas and policies of CCP, so the co-operation between the CCP and Kuomintang could be facilitated.

After returning to Shanghai, Fan wrote the news article &quot;Turmoil in the Northwest&quot; (動盪中之西北大局) on the &quot;Ta Kung Pao&quot; on February 16. This article finally shocked the public and embarrassed Chiang Kai-shek, the leader of Nationalist Government by unveiling the truth in Xi&#x27;an. Mao was glad after reading his article and even wrote a letter to Fan to appreciate his efforts.

Fan had written a lot of exclusive articles about Red Army March and Xi&#x27;an Incident, which acted as a forwarding power to the Chinese history. He was an initial reporter writing about the details of Red Army March in his two articles called &quot;&quot;Minshan Nanbei Jiaofei Zhi Xianshi&quot; (岷山南北剿匪軍事之現勢) and &quot;Chenglan Jixing&quot;&quot; (成蘭紀行).

<doc id="1032191" wikidata="Q1191884" url="?curid=1032191" title="List of destroyer classes of the United States Navy">
<text>The first automotive torpedo was developed in 1866, and the torpedo boat was developed soon after. In 1898, while the Spanish–American War was being fought in the Caribbean and the Pacific, Assistant Secretary of the Navy Theodore Roosevelt wrote that the Spanish torpedo boat destroyers were the only threat to the American navy, and pushed for the acquisition of similar vessels. On 4 May 1898, the US Congress authorized the first sixteen torpedo boat destroyers and twelve &quot;seagoing torpedo boats&quot; for the United States Navy.

In World War I, the U.S. Navy began mass-producing destroyers, laying 273 keels of the and destroyers. The peacetime years between 1919 and 1941 resulted in many of these flush deck destroyers being laid up. Additionally, treaties regulated destroyer construction. The 1500-ton destroyers built in the 1930s under the treaties had stability problems that limited expansion of their armament in World War II. During World War II, the United States began building larger 2100-ton destroyers with five-gun main batteries, but without stability problems.

The first major warship produced by the U.S. Navy after World War II (and in the Cold War) were &quot;frigates&quot;—the ships were originally designated destroyer leaders but reclassified in 1975 as guided missile cruisers (except the became guided missile destroyers). These grew out of the last all-gun destroyers of the 1950s. In the middle 1970s the s entered service, optimized for anti-submarine warfare. A special class of guided missile destroyers was produced for the Shah of Iran, but due to the Iranian Revolution these ships could not be delivered and were added to the U.S. Navy.

The , introduced in 1991, has been the U.S. Navy&#x27;s only destroyer class in commission since 2005; construction continued through 2012 and was restarted in 2015. A further class, the , is entering service; the first ship was launched in 2013. The &quot;Zumwalt&quot; class will number three ships.

== Pre–World War I ==

In 1864, US Navy Lt. William B. Cushing sank the ironclad using a &quot;spar torpedo&quot;—an explosive device mounted on a long pole and detonated underwater. Two years later in Austria, the British engineer Robert Whitehead developed a compressed air &quot;automotive&quot; torpedo; capable of over a distance of . The threat a small, fast, torpedo–delivering ship could pose to the battle line became clear to navies around the world; giving birth to the torpedo boat, including of the United States Navy.

During the Spanish–American War, Assistant Secretary of the Navy Theodore Roosevelt wrote Spanish torpedo boat destroyers (such as the 370-ton ) were &quot;the only real menace&quot; to the fleet blockading Santiago, and pushed for the acquisition of torpedo boats and torpedo boat destroyers. As President, Theodore Roosevelt continued to pay close attention to naval affairs, including the expansion of the Navy&#x27;s fleet of destroyers.

In 1898 Congress authorized 16 torpedo boat destroyers, which would join the fleet by 1903. The first torpedo boat destroyers, the , featured two torpedo tubes and two guns, displacing . The subsequent and classes displaced , the reason these classes were nicknamed &quot;flivvers&quot; (lightweights, after the Model T Ford). By the time the United States entered World War I, destroyers displaced and burned oil instead of coal. These &quot;1000 tonners&quot; were armed with eight to twelve torpedo tubes, four /50 caliber guns; and had a complement of approximately 100 officers and men. The 1000 tonners were the through classes, and were also called &quot;broken deckers&quot;, due to their high forecastles.

== World War I ==

Prior to entering World War I in 1917, the United States began producing destroyers to a new design with a continuous sheer strake, collectively referred to as &quot;flush deckers&quot;. Six prototypes of the were dissimilar: three had three stacks; two of these also had three screws. The others of this and the 267 ships of the mass-production and classes that followed all had two screws. As built, they also had four stacks, which gave rise to the nicknames &quot;four stackers&quot; or &quot;four pipers&quot;.
Eleven shipyards participated in their construction, which peaked in 1917 and 1918. By the time of the Armistice of 11 November 1918, keels for 177 ships had been laid and 41 had joined the fleet. Though the remaining ships were not needed in peacetime, the building program continued and by the end of May 1921, all but four of the 273 flush-deckers had been placed in commission. The final two did not follow until August 1922.

While the flush-deckers&#x27; freeboard fore and aft were designed to match preceding classes, the new ships differed in other respects. The waist guns were moved to a platform amidships, the galley beneath them; and a bulwark added between the galley and the bridge.

The standard displacement of the flush deck destroyers was , the length approximately , the beam measured approximately , and the draft approximately . A typical flush deck destroyer had a normal crew of 105 officers and men, and was armed with four 4-inch deck guns, one 3-inch anti-aircraft gun, 12 torpedo tubes, two stern-mounted depth charge racks, along with .50-caliber machine guns and small arms. The mass-produced classes also had four boilers providing steam to a pair of steam turbines, each of which drove a screw at a combined for a top speed of about . Destroyers quickly acquired the anti-submarine warfare mission against U-boats in the Atlantic and Mediterranean, being equipped with depth charge racks, hydrophones, and eventually Y-gun depth charge throwers. However, it was very difficult to successfully attack a U-boat with World War I technology, and US anti-submarine forces only scored two kills in that war.

== Between the World Wars ==

After the end of World War I, there was little need for the destroyers built, so many were laid up, and fourteen had their torpedo tubes removed and were converted to minesweepers. On 8 September 1923, seven of the ships ran aground off the coast of California in the U.S. Navy&#x27;s worst ever peacetime disaster.

In 1922, the Washington Naval Treaty was signed by the United States, the British Empire, the Empire of Japan, France, and Italy. The treaty called for a freeze in the size and composition of the world&#x27;s major navies, including the U.S. Navy, which ceased production of large capital ships and destroyers. The London Naval Treaty, a 1930 agreement between the same parties (except France), established total destroyer tonnage limits for the navies. The treaty also defined two categories: destroyer and destroyer leader; along with the maximum tonnage of each category, and the allowable ratio of one category to another.

In the London Naval Treaty, destroyers were established as &quot;surface vessels of war the standard displacement (S.D.) of which does not exceed 1,850 tons and with a gun not above 5.1 inch caliber&quot;, as published in &quot;Ship’s Data for U.S. Naval Vessels&quot;. The “total completed tonnage not to be exceeded on December 31, 1936” was 150,000 S.D., but “not more than 16% of the allowed tonnage... shall be employed in vessels over 1,500 tons S.D.”. The new, higher limits rendered the existing flush-deckers obsolete, and the General Board soon moved to replace them. Since Japan was considered a probable adversary and was building destroyers through the 1920s, the General Board replaced the four-stackers with ships that could carry large quantities of fuel, ammunition, and supplies as needed to conduct operations across the vast Pacific Ocean.

The U.S. Navy resumed destroyer construction in 1932 with the . For the next seven years, the United States Navy constructed &quot;1500 tonners&quot;, or &quot;goldplaters&quot;. The goldplaters earned this name because of the &quot;over–lavish facilities&quot;, which drew comment from seasoned destroyermen. The armament of the &quot;Farragut&quot; and &quot;Mahan&quot; class destroyers initially included five 5 inch dual purpose guns, a number later reduced to four due to stability problems and a desire for a larger torpedo armament. With the introduction of the dual purpose main guns, destroyers acquired an anti-aircraft mission. The 1500-ton , , , , and classes, the 1570-ton , and the 1850-ton and destroyer leaders were all laid down in quick succession following the original goldplaters.

The and es were similar in design to the &quot;Sims&quot; class, but had two stacks and a &quot;split&quot; or echeloned powerplant for extra endurance against torpedo attacks.

== World War II ==

On 7 December 1941, the day the United States entered World War II, the United States Navy had 100 destroyers seven years old or newer. This number included 27 &quot;Benson&quot; and &quot;Gleaves&quot;-class destroyers. However, none were equipped with torpedoes comparable to the (then unknown) Type 93 torpedoes (&quot;Long Lance torpedo&quot;) of the Imperial Japanese Navy, and only destroyer leaders had more than four main guns—inferior to the six guns on a Japanese destroyer (the first 24 ships of the &quot;Benson&quot;/&quot;Gleaves&quot; class were built with five guns, but excessive topweight led to one being removed).

In 1940, fifty &quot;flush deckers&quot; were transferred to the British Royal Navy and the Royal Canadian Navy under the Destroyers for Bases Agreement. Other &quot;flush deckers&quot; were converted as high speed transports (APD), seaplane tenders (AVD), minelayers (DM), minesweepers (DMS), and other roles (AG), while some were retained as destroyers. Most remaining in US service were rearmed with varying numbers of 3 inch dual purpose guns.

After the 1500 ton limit on destroyers was changed to a 3000 ton limit with the Second London Naval Treaty, the United States Navy began sketches for a five-gun ship— on an enlarged hull. Introduced in 1942, the 175 &quot;2100 tonners&quot;. became the U.S. Navy&#x27;s signature destroyer in the Pacific War. By the end of World War II, the U.S. Navy had also commissioned 112 six-gun destroyers derived from the &quot;Fletcher&quot; design; 67 2200 tonners and 45 2250 tonners. The &quot;Allen M. Sumner&quot; class&#x27; hull was slightly wider than the &quot;Fletcher&quot; class&#x27;, while the &quot;Gearing&quot;-class design was a lengthened version of the &quot;Allen M. Sumner&quot;s. By 1945, as the threat from &quot;kamikaze&quot;s increased and the threat from the Japanese surface fleet decreased, torpedoes and guns were partially (or completely in the case of torpedoes on some ships) removed from most US destroyers in favor of light anti-aircraft guns. Destroyers had acquired the hazardous radar picket mission by this time. Collectively, these destroyer designs are sometimes regarded as the most successful of World War II.


== Cold War and beyond ==

The first major warship the U.S. Navy constructed after World War II was an all-weather, anti-submarine hunter-killer, designated &quot;destroyer leader&quot; (DL) but referred to as a &quot;frigate&quot;. The majority of these carried long-range surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) to escort carrier and amphibious task forces and were designated &quot;guided missile destroyer leaders&quot;; some were nuclear-powered (DLG or DLGN). In 1975, the 12 remaining - and ships were reclassified as guided-missile destroyers (DDGs 35-46), and the other classes were reclassified as guided-missile cruisers (CG or CGN).

Derived from the &quot;Fletcher&quot; concept, the all-gun destroyer was the successor to the &quot;Fletcher&quot;, &quot;Allen M. Sumner&quot;, and &quot;Gearing&quot; classes. The following added a short-range SAM launcher on an enlarged hull and were classified as DDGs.

The was designed to serve as all-weather anti-submarine escorts for aircraft carrier task forces, as their anti-air missile complement was only sufficient for point defense. The &quot;Spruance&quot;-class destroyers were the first ships in the United States Navy powered with gas turbines—four marine turboshaft (jet-type) engines driving two shafts with reversible-pitch propellers. The 31 &quot;Spruance&quot;-class ships began service in September 1975 through the 1990s, when 24 members of the class were upgraded with vertical launching systems, and the last was decommissioned in 2005. The was based on the &quot;Spruance&quot; class, but designed as more advanced multi-purpose ships with a significant SAM armament, intended for the Iranian Navy. In 1979, a revolution took place in Iran; the Shah was dethroned, but instead of cancelling the four ships, they were acquired by the U.S. Navy, where they were nicknamed the &quot;Ayatollah&quot; or &quot;dead Admiral&quot; class.

, the lead ship of the , was the first destroyer named after a living person—World War II Admiral Arleigh Burke. At her commissioning, USS &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot; was extolled as the most powerful surface warship ever built. &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot; is one-third longer and correspondingly heavier than the &quot;Fletcher&quot;-class destroyers of the squadron Burke commanded in World War II, but of about the same complement. The &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;-class destroyers were based around the Aegis Combat System, like the larger s. The &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot; class comprises four &quot;Flights&quot;: Flight I, composed of 21 ships; Flight II, composed of 7 ships; Flight IIA, to be composed of 47 ships; and Flight III, to enter Initial operating capability in 2023.

 destroyer production was limited to three ships due to burgeoning costs. Including research, the program costs reached $22.5 billion for the three ships. The first was commissioned in 2016, and the last is expected to be commissioned in 2024.

==Production summary==
Production of United States Navy destroyers, broken out by shipyard and class of destroyer.


A decade passes, during which some of the previously produced destroyers are scrapped to comply with treaty limitations. In the early 1930s, the Navy begins to modernize its destroyer fleet. is the point in time where U.S. destroyers start carrying 5-inch main guns that can shoot at aircraft with a high rate of fire and good accuracy (in contrast to previous single purpose destroyer guns and much less capable contemporary dual purpose guns) as well as many other improvements. The Destroyer design basically starts from scratch. Production during this period is a cold arms race where each nation tries to make the most of the limited tonnage that the international treaties allow.

There are 3 production periods covered in the following table.

# 6 &quot;Benson&quot; and 18 &quot;Gleaves&quot; in FY38, FY39, FY40 (8 per year)
# 24 &quot;Benson&quot; and 48 &quot;Gleaves&quot; roughly in a vastly extended FY41 covering the regular FY41 approriations act of 11 June (8 ships) and the first and second supplemental appropriations acts of 26 June and 9 September (64 ships), in addition most of the Fletchers in the same 1940 acts
# the remaining Fletchers, all Sumners, Smiths and Gearings covered by later legislation, continuing the expansion of production initiated in 1940, carried out starting during 1941, slowing down by 1944 and lasting into 1946

The &quot;Consolidated Steel&quot; yard in Orange, the &quot;Seattle-Tacoma&quot; plant in Seattle and &quot;Bethlehem San Pedro&quot; were essentially purpose-built to produce destroyers between the fall of 1940 and the spring of 1941.

&quot;Gulf Shipbuilding&quot; was reactivated from essentially nothing, but had a primary focus of merchant ship production.

The other yards were significantly expanded during the same time period.

<doc id="1032195" wikidata="Q3784808" url="?curid=1032195" title="Heneage Finch, 1st Earl of Nottingham">
<text>Heneage Finch, 1st Earl of Nottingham, PC (23 December 162018 December 1682), Lord Chancellor of England, was descended from the old family of Finch, many of whose members had attained high legal eminence, and was the eldest son of Sir Heneage Finch, Recorder of London, by his first wife Frances Bell, daughter of Sir Edmond Bell of Beaupre Hall, Norfolk.

==Early career==

In the register of Oxford University, he is entered as born in Kent, and probably at the Finch ancestral seat Eastwell Park in that county. He was the son of Sir Heneage Finch, younger son of Sir Moyle Finch, 1st Baronet and Elizabeth Finch, 1st Countess of Winchilsea (&quot;née&quot; Heneage).

He was educated at Westminster and at Christ Church, Oxford, where he remained until he became a member of the Inner Temple in 1638. He was called to the bar in 1645, and soon obtained a lucrative practice.

==Career==
In April 1660, he was elected Member of Parliament for Canterbury and Mitchell in the Convention Parliament and chose to sit for Canterbury. Shortly afterwards he was appointed Solicitor General, in which capacity he served as the prosecutor of the regicides of Charles I, and was created a baronet the day after he was knighted. In May 1661 he was elected MP for Oxford University in the Cavalier Parliament. In 1665 the university created him a D.C.L. In 1670 he became Attorney General, and in 1675 Lord Chancellor. He was created Baron Finch in January 1673 and Earl of Nottingham in May 1681.

===Popish Plot===

During the Popish Plot, he played an active part in the interrogation of witnesses and preparation of the Crown&#x27;s evidence. He is said to have been sceptical about the credibility 
of much of the evidence, and drew up a private report referring to the difficulties with Titus Oates&#x27; testimony. In general he behaved with moderation and restraint during the Plot, as shown most notably in his impartial conduct, as Lord High Steward, of the trial of William Howard, 1st Viscount Stafford, (apart from a curious remark that it was now clear that the Great Fire of London was a Catholic conspiracy). Kenyon notes that during the examination of the informer Miles Prance, Finch threatened him with the rack, but such a lapse was most uncharacteristic of Finch, who was a humane and civilised man; in any case, the threat could hardly have been serious since the use of the rack had been declared illegal in 1628.

===Finch and Nottingham House, now Kensington Palace===

The original early 17th-century building was constructed in the village of Kensington as Nottingham House for the Earl of Nottingham. It was acquired from his heir, who was Secretary of State to William III, in 1689, because the King wanted a residence near London but away from the smoky air of the capital, because he was asthmatic. At that time Kensington was a suburban village location outside London, but more accessible than Hampton Court, a water journey on the Thames. A private road was laid out from the Palace to Hyde Park Corner, broad enough for several carriages to travel abreast, part of which survives today as Rotten Row. The Palace was improved and extended by Sir Christopher Wren with pavilions attached to each corner of the central block, for it now needed paired Royal Apartments approached by the Great Stairs, a council chamber, and the Chapel Royal. Then, when Wren re-oriented the house to face west, he built north and south wings to flank the approach, made into a proper cour d&#x27;honneur that was entered through an archway surmounted by a clock tower. Nevertheless, as a private domestic retreat, it was referred to as Kensington House, rather than &quot;Palace&quot;. The walled kitchen gardens at Kensington House supplied fruits and vegetables for the Court of St. James&#x27;s.

==Personal life==
On 30 July 1646, he was married to Elizabeth Harvey, daughter of William Harvey&#x27;s younger brother Daniel, and his wife Elizabeth Kinnersley. Together, Elizabeth and Heneage were the parents of six children, including:

* Daniel Finch, 2nd Earl of Nottingham (1647–1730), who married Lady Essex Rich.
* Margaret Finch (1648–1700), who married Denis MacCarthy of the MacCarthy Reagh.
* Heneage Finch, 1st Earl of Aylesford (–1719), who had a distinguished career as a lawyer and politician and was Solicitor General 1679–86.
* Elizabeth Finch (1650–1675), who married Sir Samuel Grimston, 3rd Baronet. 
* William Finch
* Charles Finch

Lord Nottingham died in Great Queen Street, London on 18 December 1682. He was buried in the church of Ravenstone in Buckinghamshire. His son Daniel inherited his earldom, and would later also inherit the Earldom of Winchilsea.

===Character===
According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition, his contemporaries on both sides of politics agree in their high estimate of his integrity, moderation and eloquence, while his abilities as a lawyer are sufficiently attested by the fact that he is still spoken of as the father of equity. His most important contribution to the statute book is &quot;The Statute of Frauds&quot;. While attorney-general he superintended the edition of &quot;Sir Henry Hobart&#x27;s Reports&quot; (1671). He also published &quot;Several Speeches and Discourses in the Tryal of the Judges of King Charles 1.&quot; (1660); &quot;Speeches to both Houses of Parliament&quot; (1679); &quot;Speech at the Sentence of Viscount Stafford&quot; (1680). He left &quot;Chancery Reports&quot; in MS., and notes on &quot;Coke&#x27;s Institutes&quot;.

<text>The Bombardier Badge was a military badge of the United States military which was issued between the years of 1918 and 1949. The decoration was intended to recognize the military training and qualification required by those servicemen who were bombardiers on board military aircraft.

Originally known as the Bombing Aviator Badge, the Bombardier Badge was first issued by the United States Army Air Service during the First World War. The badge consisted of a standard observer badge, centred upon which was a downward facing bomb. The badge remained unchanged until the late 1930s, at which time it was redesignated the Bombardier Badge. This change was primarily made due to the rapid advances in aircraft (and aircraft bombing technology) that took place between 1920 and 1939.

During World War II, the Bombardier Badge was a common aeronautical badge of the United States Army Air Forces. The badge was issued to all military bombardiers upon completion of basic flight training and advanced bomber instruction.

With the creation of the United States Air Force in 1947, the Bombardier Badge was gradually phased out and none were issued after 1949. The modern-day Navigator Badge is considered the U.S. Air Force successor to the Bombardier Badge.

Physically the badge had stamped sterling silver wings, a bomb like look in the middle, and a pin on the back.

<text>1089 is the integer after 1088 and before 1090. It is a square number (33 squared), a nonagonal number, a 32-gonal number, a 364-gonal number, and a centered octagonal number. 1089 is the first reverse-divisible number. The next is 2178 , and they are the only four-digit numbers that divide their reverse.

==In magic==
1089 is widely used in magic tricks because it can be &quot;produced&quot; from any two three-digit numbers. This allows it to be used as the basis for a Magician&#x27;s Choice. For instance, one variation of the book test starts by having the spectator choose any two suitable numbers and then apply some basic maths to produce a single four-digit number. That number is always 1089. The spectator is then asked to turn to page 108 of a book and read the 9th word, which the magician has memorized. To the audience it looks like the number is random, but through manipulation, the result is always the same. 

In base 10, the following steps always yield 1089:
# Take any three-digit number where the first and last digits differ by more than 1.
# Reverse the digits, and subtract the smaller from the larger one.
# Add to this result the number produced by reversing its digits.

For example, if the spectator chooses 237 (or 732):

: 732 − 237 = 495
: 495 + 594 = 1089

as expected. On the other hand, if the spectator chooses 102 (or 201):

: 201 − 102 = 99
: 99 + 99 ≠ 1089

contradicting the rule. However, if we amend the third rule by reading 99 as a three-digit number 099 and take its reverse, we obtain:

: 201 − 102 = 099
: 099 + 990 = 1089

as expected.

===Explanation===
The spectator&#x27;s 3-digit number can be written as 100 × A + 10 × B + 1 × C, and its reversal as 100 × C + 10 × B + 1 × A, where 1 ≤ A ≤ 9, 0 ≤ B ≤ 9 and 1 ≤ C ≤ 9. Their difference is 99 × (A − C) (For convenience, we assume A &gt; C; if A &lt; C, we first swap A and C.). If A − C is 0, the difference is 0, and we do not get a 3-digit number for the next step. If A − C is 1, the difference is 99. Using a leading 0 gives us a 3-digit number for the next step.

99 × (A − C) can also be written as 99 × [(A − C) − 1] + 99 = 100 × [(A − C) − 1] − 1 × [(A − C) − 1] + 90 + 9 = 100 × [(A − C) − 1] + 90 + 9 − (A − C) + 1 = 100 × [(A − C) − 1] + 10 × 9 + 1 × [10 − (A − C)]. (The first digit is (A − C) − 1, the second is 9 and the third is 10 − (A − C). As 2 ≤ A − C ≤ 9, both the first and third digits are guaranteed to be single digits.)

Its reversal is 100 × [10 − (A − C)] + 10 × 9 + 1 × [(A − C) − 1]. The sum is thus 101 × [(A − C) − 1] + 20 × 9 + 101 × [10 − (A − C)] = 101 × [(A − C) − 1 + 10 − (A − C)] + 20 × 9 = 101 × [−1 + 10] + 180 = 1089.

===Other properties===
Multiplying the number 1089 by the integers from 1 to 9 produces a pattern: multipliers adding up to 10 give products that are the digit reversals of each other:

: 1 × 1089 = 1089 ↔ 9 × 1089 = 9801
: 2 × 1089 = 2178 ↔ 8 × 1089 = 8712
: 3 × 1089 = 3267 ↔ 7 × 1089 = 7623
: 4 × 1089 = 4356 ↔ 6 × 1089 = 6534
: 5 × 1089 = 5445 ↔ 5 × 1089 = 5445

Also note the patterns within each column:

: 1 × 1089 = 1089
: 2 × 1089 = 2178
: 3 × 1089 = 3267
: 4 × 1089 = 4356
: 5 × 1089 = 5445
: 6 × 1089 = 6534
: 7 × 1089 = 7623
: 8 × 1089 = 8712
: 9 × 1089 = 9801

Numbers formed analogously in other bases, e.g. octal 1067 or hexadecimal 10EF, also have these properties.

<text>The National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) is a research and development initiative which provides a framework to coordinate nanoscale research and resources among United States federal government agencies and departments.

== History ==

Mihail C. Roco proposed the initiative in a 1999 presentation to the White House under the Clinton administration. The NNI was officially launched in 2000 and received funding for the first time in FY2001.

President Bill Clinton advocated nanotechnology development. In a 21 January 2000 speech at the California Institute of Technology, Clinton stated that &quot;Some of our research goals may take twenty or more years to achieve, but that is precisely why there is an important role for the federal government.&quot;

President George W. Bush further increased funding for nanotechnology. On 3 December 2003 Bush signed into law the 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act (), which authorizes expenditures for five of the participating agencies totaling $3.63 billion over four years.. This law is an authorization, not an appropriation, and subsequent appropriations for these five agencies have not met the goals set out in the 2003 Act. However, there are many agencies involved in the Initiative that are not covered by the Act, and requested budgets under the Initiative for all participating agencies in Fiscal Years 2006 – 2015 totaled over $1 billion each.

In February 2014, the National Nanotechnology Initiative released a Strategic Plan outlining updated goals and &quot;program component areas&quot; ,&quot; as required under the terms of the Act. This document supersedes the NNI Strategic Plans released in 2004 and 2007.

The NNI&#x27;s budget supplement proposed by the Obama administration for Fiscal Year 2015 provides $1.5 billion in requested funding. The cumulative NNI investment since fiscal year 2001, including the 2015 request, totals almost $21 billion. Cumulative investments in nanotechnology-related environmental, health, and safety research since 2005 to 2015 total nearly $900 million. The Federal agencies with the largest investments are the National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation, Department of Energy, Department of Defense, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

The NNI received increased support for emerging technologies during the Trump administration and a special focus on clean energy and mitigating climate change during the Biden administration. NNI cumulative investment by 2023 inclusive reached $40 billion, and nanotechnology has become pervasive in material, energy and biosystem related discoveries and applications.

== Goals ==
The four primary goals of NNI are:

# Advance a world-class nanotechnology research and development program;
# Foster the transfer of new technologies into products for commercial and public benefits;
# Develop and sustain educational resources, a skilled workforce, and a dynamic infrastructure and toolset to advance nanotechnology;
# Support responsible development of nanotechnology.

== Initiatives ==

=== Nanotechnology Signature Initiatives ===
Nanotechnology Signature Initiatives (NSIs) spotlight areas of nanotechnology where significant advances in nanoscale science and technology can be made with the focus and cooperation of participating agencies. NSIs accelerate research, development, and application of nanotechnology in these critical areas.

As of December 2020, the current NSIs are:
* NSI: Water Sustainability through Nanotechnology – Nanoscale Solutions for a Global-Scale Challenge,
* NSI: Nanotechnology for Sensors and Sensors for Nanotechnology – Improving and Protecting Health, Safety, and the Environment,
* NSI: Sustainable Nanomanufacturing - Creating the Industries of the Future,
* NSI: Nanoelectronics for 2020 and Beyond.

NSIs are dynamic and are retired as they achieve their specified goals or develop an established community they no longer require the spotlight provided as a NSI. Retired NSIs are:
* NSI: Nanoelectronics for 2020 and Beyond,
* NSI: Nanotechnology for Solar Energy Collection and Conversion - Contributing to Energy Solutions for the Future,
* NSI: Nanotechnology Knowledge Infrastructure - Enabling National Leadership in Sustainable Design.

=== Nanotechnology-Inspired Grand Challenges ===
A nanotechnology-inspired grand challenge (GC) is an ambitious goal that utilizes nanotechnology and nanoscience to solve national and global issues. The first and current GC was announced in October 2015 after receiving input and suggestions from the public. As of December 2020, the grand challenge is:
* A Nanotechnology-Inspired Grand Challenge for Future Computing: Create a new type of computer that can proactively interpret and learn from data, solve unfamiliar problems using what it has learned, and operate with the energy efficiency of the human brain.

== Participating Federal Agencies and Departments ==
&quot;Departments and agencies with nanotechnology R&amp;D budgets:&quot;

&quot;Other participating departments and agencies:&quot;

== Results and Effects ==
Only a very small number of studies attempted to evaluate the effects of the NNI objectively. A study of Corporate and University Nanotechnology patenting published in 2023, looked at patent grants since the launch of the NNI in 2000 through 2009 and maintenance events on those patents through 2021. US-invented nanopatents with US assignees, were somewhat more apt to renew at least once (14.5% vs. 11.7%) compared to the US -assignees on average, but somewhat less inclined to pay for full maintenance of 20 years from filing (40.5% vs. 52.5%). The lower propensity to renew could be attributed to a quickly changing technology-landscape.

<doc id="1032230" wikidata="Q5154514" url="?curid=1032230" title="Communist Workers' Party (United States)">
<text>The Communist Workers&#x27; Party (CWP) was a far-left Maoist group in the United States. It had its origin in 1973 as the Asian Study Group (renamed the Workers&#x27; Viewpoint Organization in 1976) established by Jerry Tung, a former member of the Progressive Labor Party (PLP) who had grown disenchanted with the group and disagreed with changes taking place in the party line. The party is mainly remembered as being associated with victims of the Greensboro massacre of 1979.

The CWP followed the policies of Mao Zedong. The CWP also incorporated aspects of the CPUSA&#x27;s anti-racist pre-Popular Front program. In particular the CWP emphasized unionization and self-determination for African Americans.

== History ==
===Origins===

The CWP enjoyed some success in textile cities of North Carolina. The new party established branches in New York, Boston, Los Angeles, San Francisco Bay Area, Philadelphia, Chicago, Detroit, Greensboro, West Virginia, Colorado and other locations. Before forming itself into a party in October 1979 (the founding congress was held in the backroom of a discothèque in New York City), the group was known as the Workers Viewpoint Organization. Under its umbrella, it directed groups as the Revolutionary Youth League, the African Liberation Support Committee, and the Trade Union Education League.

===1979 Greensboro Massacre===
Confrontations with the Ku Klux Klan (&quot;Klan&quot; or &quot;KKK&quot;) were particularly acute in Greensboro, North Carolina, where the Klan sought to disrupt the CWP&#x27;s effort to unionize poor, black mill workers in the Greensboro area. In July 1979, the Klan held a rally and viewing of &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; in China Grove, near Charlotte, which was disrupted by CWP members who burned a Confederate flag and taunted members of the KKK. CWP leader Paul Bermanzohn taunted the Klan in the press, saying &quot;The KKK is one of the most treacherous scum elements produced by the dying system of capitalism&quot; and inviting further confrontation with &quot;We challenge you to attend our rally in Greensboro.&quot; 

On November 3, 1979, members of the KKK, including a police informant, and the American Nazi Party drove up to the &quot;Death to the Klan&quot; rally organized by the CWP. The KKK were armed and opened fire on the anti-Klan rally, killing four members of the CWP and one non-affiliated participant. These deaths became known as the &quot;Greensboro Massacre.&quot; Two subsequent trials of KKK and ANP members resulted in acquittals. In response to the acquittals of the accused killers, the CWP attempted to storm the 1980 Democratic National Convention and succeeded in setting off firecrackers in Madison Square Garden.

===Ideology===
From its earliest phase as the Workers&#x27; Viewpoint Organization, the CWP had considered itself as Maoist and supported the so-called Gang of Four after Mao&#x27;s death. Following the line of Mao, it considered the Soviet Union and its bloc as restored capitalist countries. For some time after the arrest of the Gang of Four, the group remained silent about the events in China but later accused China also of having taken the capitalist road.

An article published in the &quot;Workers Viewpoint&quot; in 1976 criticised a social liberal and libertine view of sexuality as &quot;the bourgeoisie’s attempts to dope us with degenerate culture and fascist ideology.&quot; The article opposed pornography as representing anti-woman American bourgeois hedonism (it singled out the film &quot;Snuff&quot;) and argued that homosexuality &quot;is a form of social sickness, a form of social perversion. It is a form of bourgeois ideology which appeals especially to the petty bourgeoisie because of its appearance as sexual freedom.&quot;

In 1980, there was a dramatic reversal of this line. In his book &quot;The Socialist Road&quot;, CWP Chairman Jerry Tung announced that both the Soviet Union and China were socialist, although an unhealthy bureaucracy had taken shape in the governments of both countries.

===Demise===
Subsequent to the Greensboro massacre, the group gave up its Leninist structure and moved towards a social democratic formation that would work for peaceful transition to socialism; it dissolved the Communist Workers&#x27; Party and formed the New Democratic Movement in 1985. The New Democratic Movement lasted only a few years. The most important remnant of the CWP/NDM can be found in the Greensboro Justice Fund, which continues to this day and promotes groups struggling for social justice.

<text>The Marxist–Leninist Party, USA (MLP) was an anti-revisionist Marxist–Leninist communist party arising out of a series of communist and workers&#x27; groups that began in 1967 and lasted until 1993 when it dissolved. It was founded as the American Communist Workers Movement (Marxist–Leninist) in the 1960s as a Maoist organization allied with the Canadian Communist Party of Canada (Marxist–Leninist), CPC (M-L). During its history, it became a Hoxhaist group, before turning away from backing Albania, then rejecting Maoism and subsequently Stalinism as being revisionist. After its dissolution, the majority of its members who remained active formed the Communist Voice Organization. Its main publication was the paper &quot;Workers Advocate&quot;.

== History ==
The group&#x27;s origins lie in a small, predominantly African American, group founded in early 1967 called the Cleveland Draft Resistance Union. In 1968, they reorganized as the Workers Action Committee and broadened their focus from anti-war activities to community organizing, strike support, and the study of Marxism. They embraced Maoism and developed a close relationship with the Canadian Communist Movement (Marxist–Leninist) led by Hardial Bains. In May 1969, the WAC attended a Marxist–Leninist conference in Regina, Canada and established the American Communist Workers&#x27; Movement (Marxist-Leninist). It has &quot;just 100 members.&quot;

The ACWM emulated some of the strategy expounded by Communist Party of Canada (Marxist–Leninist) leader Hardial Bains, including attempting to launch a daily newspaper. This experiment — the only Maoist daily ever published in the United States — was the &quot;People&#x27;s America Daily News&quot; which lasted for 77 issues.

In about 1973, the group was renamed the Central Organization of US Marxist–Leninists. and militantly opposed the police and fascism, as well as socialists and communists they considered &quot;revisionist&quot;. The group continued to move with the CPC (M-L) from Maoism to Hoxhaism until in 1980 they adopted the name &quot;Marxist–Leninist Party USA&quot; and split with the Canadian group the following year, with those remaining loyal to the CPC (M-L) becoming the U.S. Marxist–Leninist Organization.

The break with the CPC (M-L) led to the MLP beginning a reassessment of its politics, partially in an attempt to draw other anti-revisionists towards it, as many groups claiming anti-revisionism were moving to the right-wing. By the late 1980s, the MLP had come to the conclusion that anti-revisionism meant that they had to reject the traditional support of the communist movement&#x27;s positions from the time of the 1935 Congress of the Comintern onwards. This decision, however, led to an ideological impasse in the MLP, and at its fifth Congress in November 1993, it voted to dissolve itself. A number of activists in the MLP have continued work as the Communist Voice Organization.

<text>The Communist Party USA (Marxist–Leninist) was a small American Maoist group founded in 1965 by Los Angeles members of the Provisional Organizing Committee to Reconstitute a Marxist–Leninist Party (POC) around Michael Laski. 
Laski stated in a 1968 interview that this split was motivated by dissatisfaction with the POC&#x27;s response to the Watts riots.

== History ==
In 1967 Detective James C. Harris of the Los Angeles district attorney&#x27;s office testified before the House Un-American Activities Committee about the group. He stated that the &quot;intent of the CPUSA-ML has been to aggravate&quot; the African-American population in Los Angeles &quot;to the point of civil disobedience and to attempt to condition their minds to respond in a rebellious way in the event of a contact with a police officer.&quot; 

General Secretary Laski was expelled after gambling away nearly all of the party&#x27;s funds in Nevada in an attempt to raise more funds. After the expulsion, two groups existed with the name Communist Party USA (Marxist–Leninist), one led by Arnold Hoffman, which continued to publish &quot;People&#x27;s Voice&quot;; and one led by Laski, which started a new paper, &quot;The New Worker&quot;. In 1969, the Laski group merged with the Proletarian Revolutionary Party led by Jonathan Leake.

Laski was the subject of a 1967 essay by Joan Didion (later collected in &quot;Slouching Towards Bethlehem&quot;), entitled &quot;Comrade Laski, C.P.U.S.A. (M.-L.).&quot; She described him as having constructed a personal world &quot;of labyrinthine intricacy and immaculate clarity, a world made meaningful not only by high purpose but by external and internal threats, intrigues and apparatus, an immutably ordered world in which things mattered.&quot;

<text>The administrative division reform of 1708 was carried out by Russian Tsar Peter the Great in an attempt to improve the manageability of the vast territory of Russia. Prior to the reform, the country was subdivided into uyezds and volosts, and in the 17th century the number of the uyezds was 166.

==Creation==
On , 1708, Peter issued an edict dividing Russia into eight governorates (&quot;guberniyas&quot;). The edict established neither the borders of the governorates nor their internal divisions; instead, their territories were defined as the sets of cities and the lands adjacent to those cities. Some older subdivision types also continued to be used.
