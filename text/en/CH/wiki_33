<text>Sébastien Olivier Bourdais (; born 28 February 1979) is a French professional racing driver who currently races in the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship for Cadillac Chip Ganassi Racing in the GTP category. He is one of the most successful drivers in the history of American open-wheel car racing, having won 37 races. He won four successive championships in the Open-Wheel Racing Series-sanctioned Champ Car World Series from 2004 to 2007. Later he competed at the IndyCar Series from 2011 to 2021. He also entered 27 races in Formula One for the Toro Rosso team during and the start of .

Bourdais has raced sports cars throughout his career, with spells at the Rolex Sports Car Series, American Le Mans Series, Le Mans Series, Intercontinental Le Mans Cup, FIA World Endurance Championship. He was a Peugeot Sport factory driver from 2007 to 2011, finishing runner-up three times at his home race, the 24 Hours of Le Mans. The Frenchman was a Ford Performance factory driver from 2016 to 2019, winning the GTE-Pro class at the 2016 24 Hours of Le Mans. He became a Cadillac factory driver in 2022. To date (January 2025) he won 76 races in total.

==Early years==

===Karting===
Born into a racing family in Le Mans (his father Patrick raced in touring cars, hill climbs and sports cars), Bourdais began his racing career at age 10 in karts. During the early 1990s, he competed in a variety of karting championships, winning the Maine Bretagne League in 1991 and the Cadet France championship in 1993. Bourdais was part of the winning Sologne Karting team which won the 1996 24-hour Le Mans kart race at the Circuit Alain Prost on a Merlin chassis with Atomic motors.

===Junior formulae===
Bourdais progressed to single-seater racing in 1995, finishing 9th in the Formula Campus by Renault and Elf Championship. He then spent two years in the French Formula Renault Championship, ultimately finishing second in points in 1997 after winning four races and five pole positions. In 1998, he won five races to become Rookie of the Year (6th overall) in French F3. He won the series outright in 1999, with eight wins and three poles.

===Formula 3000===
Following his success in the lower formulae, Bourdais joined the Prost Junior Team in the International F3000 Championship. He finished ninth in the series with one pole and a best finish of second. In 2001, Bourdais moved to the DAMS team in Formula 3000 and took his first win in the series at Silverstone. He changed teams again for 2002, taking his Super Nova Racing car to three victories and seven pole positions. He beat Giorgio Pantano to the championship by two points after Tomáš Enge, who had scored the most points, was penalised for failing a drug test.

===DTM===
After his Formula 3000 career and with no prospects for graduation to Formula 1, Bourdais signed with Opel to race in the DTM in 2003. His manager, David Sears, inserted a clause in his contract which allowed him to break his contract without penalties in the event that he managed to secure a drive in Formula 1, CART or the Indy Racing League. Bourdais tested for Opel but did not drive in a DTM race because he managed to secure a drive in CART for 2003. Bourdais was to be paid €250,000 for his 2003 season with Opel.

==Champ Car career==
Following in the footsteps of recent F3000 graduates such as Juan Pablo Montoya and Bruno Junqueira, Bourdais moved to Champ Car racing in the United States and joined Newman/Haas Racing for the 2003 CART season. At St. Petersburg, Florida, Bourdais became the first rookie since Nigel Mansell to claim pole position for his very first race. However, he did not finish higher than 11th until his fourth race, when he led 95 laps en route to his first Champ Car victory at Brands Hatch.

He followed this up with another victory at the Lausitzring. By the end of the season, he had earned five more podium finishes, including a win from the pole at Cleveland. With a runner-up finish in Mexico City, he clinched the Rookie of the Year title and finished 4th in the overall standings.

Bourdais was paid US $70,000 to drive for Newman/Haas Racing in 2003.

Staying with Newman-Haas for 2004, Bourdais dominated the Champ Car series with seven wins and eight poles in his McDonald&#x27;s-sponsored Lola, beating his teammate Junqueira by 28 points. His record also included podium finishes in 10 out of 14 events and qualifying results no lower than third all season.

Bourdais successfully defended his Champ Car title in 2005 with five wins in six races towards the end of the season, again with the Newman-Haas/Lanigan team. That May, he also finished 12th in his first Indianapolis 500.

Bourdais won a third consecutive Champ Car title in 2006. His season began with four consecutive victories at Long Beach, Houston, Monterrey, and Milwaukee, although his winning streak was ended by the emergence of A. J. Allmendinger, who won three races in a row through the middle of the season. Bourdais responded with a commanding victory from pole at San Jose, leaving him leading the Champ Car points standings.

However, an incident with his arch-rival Paul Tracy that knocked him out on the final lap of the following race in Denver, and a subsequent win by Allmendinger narrowed the gap between the two. Bourdais&#x27;s win in Montreal and Allmendinger&#x27;s DNF had widened his points lead to 62 points with three races left, and Bourdais clinched the championship at the next race in Surfers Paradise despite a weak performance in that race. Bourdais became the first Champ Car driver to win three consecutive titles since Ted Horn achieved the hat trick in 1948.

Bourdais won a fourth consecutive Champ Car title in 2007 with victory at Lexmark Indy 300 on 21 October.

==Formula One career==

===Pre-champ car===
In 2002, Bourdais got his first F1 test with the Arrows team and was signed on to drive for the team but the team was on the verge of bankruptcy. In December he tested for Renault at Jerez but fellow Frenchman Franck Montagny secured the test drive instead of Bourdais.

===Toro Rosso===

Bourdais returned to F1 in 2007 after being given several tests with Scuderia Toro Rosso. On 10 August 2007 it was announced Bourdais would replace Vitantonio Liuzzi at Red Bull&#x27;s b-team, Toro Rosso, as team-mate to Sebastian Vettel. On 16 March 2008 Bourdais competed in his first Formula One Championship race, the 2008 Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne. After qualifying in 17th position he took advantage of mistakes made by other drivers, in the first Formula One race since the 2001 San Marino Grand Prix without traction control, and worked his way up to fourth. However, with three laps remaining an engine problem forced Bourdais to retire, but he was still classified 8th having completed more than 90% of the race distance. He later inherited seventh place (and two Championship points) after the disqualification of Rubens Barrichello.

Bourdais qualified ninth for the Belgian Grand Prix. During the race he quickly gained places and held on to fifth place for much of the distance, getting as high as 3rd and was on course for a podium position. As the rain fell harder on the last lap he was overtaken by several cars on wet tyres and finished 7th. After the race, an emotional Bourdais was close to tears following the result. This marked his best weekend of the season and his first World Championship points since Melbourne.

Bourdais qualified in fourth place for the 2008 Italian Grand Prix. However, his car would not select first gear on the grid and had to start from the pit lane, a lap down (as the race started behind the safety car, there was no warm-up lap). Although he eventually finished a lap behind the race winner, team-mate Vettel, he set the second-fastest lap of the race; only Ferrari&#x27;s Kimi Räikkönen went faster. At the 2008 Japanese Grand Prix he was 6th on the road but received a 25-second penalty for causing an avoidable accident with Felipe Massa dropping him to 10th. Few agreed with the decision – ITV Sport&#x27;s Martin Brundle had stated during live TV coverage of the race that he felt Massa might receive a penalty, whilst his colleague James Allen stated that 99% of experts he spoke to felt that Bourdais did not deserve a penalty; the FIA were under such public scrutiny at the time following a string of controversial decisions that they made the unprecedented step of releasing publicly &quot;stewards only&quot; footage of the incident, to justify the decision.

Bourdais tested significantly for the Toro Rosso team during the winter, though he was uncertain of a drive heading into the new year. On 6 February 2009 however he was confirmed as a Toro Rosso driver for a second year, partnering Swiss rookie Sébastien Buemi. Despite two points finishes in the year at the Australian Grand Prix and in Monaco, Bourdais struggled to match his less experienced team-mate. In Spain Bourdais struck Buemi&#x27;s car as the field attempted to avoid a spun Jarno Trulli on the first lap, ending the race for both drivers. At the British Grand Prix Bourdais collided with McLaren driver Heikki Kovalainen, again ending the race for both. At the German Grand Prix he suffered a mechanical failure after qualifying last by over a second.

On 16 July 2009, Toro Rosso announced that Bourdais would no longer be driving for the team. Toro Rosso&#x27;s Franz Tost said the partnership had not met up to his expectations, and Bourdais would be replaced as of the Hungarian Grand Prix. Bourdais was advised by counsel to file suit for breach of contract by Toro Rosso, as he had a viable case. Toro Rosso settled the matter with a $2.1 million payment to Bourdais to avoid litigation.

==24 Hours of Le Mans==

Bourdais has frequently contested the famous 24-hour race of his hometown, entering for the first time in 1999 (aged only 20) in a Porsche 911 GT2 run by Larbre Compétition. The car, which he shared with Pierre de Thoisy and Jean-Pierre Jarier, retired after 134 laps with engine failure.

He returned in 2000, finishing fourth with Emmanuel Clérico and Olivier Grouillard for the Pescarolo team behind the three dominant Audis.

His next three appearances did not go so well. He shared a Courage C60 with Jean-Christophe Boullion and Laurent Rédon in 2001 but it retired after 271 laps. He drove the same model the next year and finished ninth in the LMP900 class with Bouillon and Franck Lagorce. He missed the 2003 race and returned in 2004, only for the car he shared with Nicolas Minassian and Emmanuel Collard to retire after 282 laps.

Bourdais&#x27; next assault on Le Mans would come at the wheel of a factory-backed Peugeot 908 HDi FAP in 2007. The car he shared with Stéphane Sarrazin and Pedro Lamy finished the race second behind the winning Audi R10 TDi, despite an embarrassing slide on the first lap in wet conditions that cost Bourdais a place to one of the Audis, and car problems forcing him to park the car for the last minutes of the race, waiting for the lead R10 to cross the line. In his second Le Mans as part of the Peugeot factory team, in 2009, he finished in second place, one lap behind the winning Peugeot. Bourdais was to drive the pole-winning No. 3 Peugeot in 2010, but a suspension failure halted co-driver Pedro Lamy before Bourdais could turn one lap in the race.

==Superleague Formula==
After leaving Formula One, Bourdais signed up to drive the Sevilla FC car in the Superleague Formula series. He won on his debut weekend at the 2009 Estoril round in the Super Final. Bourdais won again at the next round, winning race 1 of the 2009 Monza round. He returned for the 2010 season racing for Olympique Lyonnais.

==Sports and touring car racing career==

While racing in the junior formulae and Champ Cars, Bourdais made several appearances in other championships. He won the Spa 24 Hours in 2002 with Christophe Bouchut, David Terrien and Vincent Vosse in a Larbre Compétition Chrysler Viper GTS-R. He also won his class at the 2006 12 Hours of Sebring in a Panoz Esperante. In 2005 he also competed in the International Race of Champions, winning his first stock car race at Texas Motor Speedway. In 2009, he set the official lap record at Sebring International Raceway, during the 12 Hours of Sebring. In 2010, Bourdais raced with Scott Tucker, Christophe Bouchut, Emmanuel Collard and Sascha Maassen for Crown Royal in a Level 5 Motorsports prepared Daytona Prototype in the prestigious Rolex 24 at Daytona, held at Daytona International Speedway in Florida. Bourdais recorded incredibly fast laps before the car retired due to an engine failure with Collard at the wheel.

In October 2010, Bourdais drove with Jonathon Webb in the Mother Racing Ford Falcon V8 Supercar in the Gold Coast 600. In October 2011, Bourdais drove with Jamie Whincup in the Team Vodafone Holden Commodore V8 Supercar in the Gold Coast 600, winning Saturday&#x27;s opening race and finishing second in the second race landed Bourdais the inaugural Dan Wheldon Memorial Trophy, awarded to the international driver who scored the most points over the Gold Coast weekend. Wheldon had been set to contest the event but lost his life in the 2011 IndyCar season finale just a week earlier. Winning the V8 Supercar race meant that he is the only driver to have won a race at the Surfers Paradise Street Circuit in both Champcar/Indycar, as well as V8 Supercar. He has also participated in the Bathurst 1000 once, finishing ninth with Lee Holdsworth in 2015.

In July 2012, Bourdais won the inaugural Brickyard Grand Prix Rolex Sports Car Series race at Indianapolis Motor Speedway, teaming with Alex Popow in the No. 2 Starworks Motorsport Riley-Ford Daytona Prototype. In October, Bourdais teamed up again with Jamie Whincup in the Team Vodafone Holden Commodore V8 Supercar for the Gold Coast 600, again taking the victory on Saturday and scoring enough points on Sunday to win the event. This also awarded him the Dan Wheldon Memorial Trophy for the second time.

He won the Rolex 24 at Daytona in 2014 in the Action Express Corvette DP with João Barbosa and Christian Fittipaldi. In 2015 he finished second at the 24 Hours of Daytona and claimed the win at the 12 Hours of Sebring, both with an Action Express Corvette DP.

On 22 November 2019, the day it was announced he had lost his IndyCar series ride, Bourdais was announced as one of the drivers for the No. 5 Mustang Sampling Racing/JDC-Miller Motorsports entry, alongside Joao Barbosa.

==IndyCar career==

Bourdais made his IRL debut at the 2005 Indianapolis 500. In his first full-time season in the IRL (2011) with Dale Coyne, Bourdais wound up 23rd in the championship, scoring the fastest race lap at Edmonton.

A switch to Dragon Racing Team for 2012–13, first with the ill-fated Lotus, then with improved Chevrolet power, he finished 25th and 12th, respectively, in the IndyCar championship. By 2014, Bourdais broke through for two pole positions and one victory. By midpoint in the 2015 season, his second year driving for Jimmy Vasser&#x27;s KV Racing team alongside teammate Stefano Coletti, Bourdais&#x27;s stock steadily rose, to top 20 status in the world drivers&#x27; ranking.

On 20 July 2014, having won the 1st heat race in Toronto, Sébastien Bourdais joined Al Unser Jr. and Ryan Hunter-Reay as the third driver in the history of organised motorsport to score open-wheel Championship Racing victories, under three sanctioning bodies (e.g., CART, and CCWS, and IRL sanction), in North America. Against stiff opposition, Bourdais finished 2014 scoring 5 top-5s and 10th overall in the 2014 IRL championship.

On 31 May 2015, in the second heat race at Belle Isle, Detroit, in a drive from far back on the grid harkening back to Stefan Bellof at Monaco in 1984, effortlessly carving his way by lesser drivers on a tight, composite street circuit, in heavy rain, breaking through with an impressive, high-profile victory and fastest race lap, Bourdais recorded his 33rd victory in American Championship car racing, just behind Al Unser Jr. with 34.

On 12 July 2015, at the Milwaukee Mile, Bourdais dominated the field and had the entire field a lap down at one point and won, his second of the 2015 season. He finished 10th in points. After KV Racing went down to one team for 2016, Bourdais struggled with a lone win again at Detroit. He finished in 14th in points for 2016. In October 2016, it was announced that Bourdais would make the change to Dale Coyne Racing to drive the number 18 for the 2017 season. His KVSH race engineer Olivier Boisson would also follow him to DCR.

In his first race back to DCR, Bourdais won the Firestone Grand Prix of St. Petersburg to start the 2017 season coming from last after a qualifying crash, on 12 March 2017. He backed this up with another recovery drive at the Long Beach race, starting from ninth and making an early rear wing change, to finish second, extending his lead in the series standings.

On 20 May 2017, Bourdais was involved in a single-car accident while qualifying for the Indianapolis 500. He suffered multiple fractures to his pelvis and a fracture to his right hip. The surgery was successful but Bourdais was forced to sit out for most of the season to recover. Bourdais would return at Gateway and run the final three races of the season.

In 2018, Bourdais returned to the Dale Coyne Racing Team now partnered with investors James &quot;Sulli&quot; Sullivan and former driver Jimmy Vasser as Dale Coyne Racing with Vasser Sullivan. The team also found steady sponsorship in the form of SealMaster and SportClips Haircuts. Bourdais started The Firestone St. Petersburg Grand Prix in 14th place. He ended up losing a tire on the opening lap but the misfortunes of Will Power and Tony Kanaan saved him from going a lap down. He went on an off sequence pit strategy and found himself 3rd with a handful of laps to go. On the final restart, Alexander Rossi divebombed the first corner and got his tires locked up on the slick airport runway paint and got into race leader Robert Wickens who had led 67 laps that day and Bourdais snuck by to win. It was his first win since last year at St. Petersburg and his first since the injury. Bourdais was emotional in victory lane and said &quot;he never doubted that he would run in IndyCar again&quot;. Bourdais went on to win pole at the very next race in Phoenix, his first on an oval since 2006. Bourdais was also the only driver to lead laps at each of the first four races of the 2018 Verizon IndyCar Series season.

On 22 November 2019, Dale Coyne Racing announced that Bourdais would not return to the team in 2020.

On 4 February 2020, it was announced that Bourdais joined A. J. Foyt Racing to drive part-time in the 2020 IndyCar Series season, running the races at St. Petersburg, Barber Motorsports Park, Long Beach and Portland. He finished fourth in the rescheduled St. Petersburg finale, an effort that kept the entry in the Leaders&#x27; Circle program for 2021. On 15 September, Bourdais was confirmed as a full-time driver for Foyt in 2021. At the season finale at Long Beach Bourdais announced that 2021 would be his last year competing full time in the IndyCar Series and that he intended to focus his efforts on sports car racing in the future. Bourdais however did not rule out racing in a select number of IndyCar events in 2022 and beyond, including the Indianapolis 500.

==Other racing==
In 2005, Bourdais competed in the 29th season of the International Race of Champions, racing stock cars against a field of 12 drivers from 8 different US-based racing series, winning 1 race in the 4 race season and finishing 5th in the overall standings.

<text>Emmaboda () is a locality and the seat of Emmaboda Municipality, Kalmar County, Sweden. It had 4,824 inhabitants in 2010.

==History==
Until 1875, Emmaboda was called Gantesbo. Back then there were only two houses in Gantesbo, which both remain to this day. The houses are called Gantesbo A and Gantesbo B. One of the houses is located on Bökön located west of Emmaboda&#x27;s sports ground. The second stands on a hill between Emmaboda parish hall and the Bjurbäck school. In 1874, Emmaboda railway station was established for the Coast-to-Coast Line (&quot;Kust till kust-banan&quot;) and in 1875 Karlskrona-Växjö railway was connected to the station in Emmaboda.

==Culture==
The musical &quot;Kristina från Duvemåla&quot; written by former members of the Swedish music group ABBA; Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus, is a story based on a series of books by author Vilhelm Moberg (1898–1973). &quot;The Emigrants series&quot; was about people living in Dufvemåla homestead (which is 3 km outside of Emmaboda) who emigrated to the United States. Moberg was born in Emmaboda Municipality, more specifically at Moshultamåla in Algutsboda parish. Many of his novels were written about the people in the Emmaboda area.
&quot;Emmabodafestivalen&quot; was an indie-pop festival annually held in Emmaboda from 1988 until 2018, when the police announced they would not grant further permits to the festival due to drug use at the site. It attracted pop fans from all over Sweden. Other events taking place in Emmaboda include the car race &quot;A Day On the Strip&quot; and &quot;End of Summer Big Power Meet&quot;, a classic car show which attracts veteran cars from all over Sweden and other Nordic countries.

==Geography==
Emmaboda is located in the middle of the tri-city region of Växjö, Kalmar and Karlskrona. All three places are 60 kilometers from Emmaboda.
==Emmaboda Church==
Emmaboda Church (&quot;Emmaboda kyrka&quot;) was built in 1926 after drawings by architect Göran Pauli (1891-1940) and was originally a parish home. In 1941, a remodeling was carried out, after drawings by architect Paul Boberg (1884-1947) when the parish home was converted to church. The tower and the current choir party were then added. The altarpiece is painted by artist Gunnar Theander (1894-1975) in 1935. The bell tower houses two bells which were cast by the foundry, Bergholtz klockgjuteri.

==Sports==
There is a football club called Emmaboda IS, with women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s teams in the 2nd respectively 3rd division. The three football brothers Viktor, David and Rasmus Elm are from the village Broakulla, which is located near Emmaboda.

Badminton player Henri Hurskainen, who has represented Sweden in the Summer Olympics and won various international medals, was born in Emmaboda.

==Industry==
Emmaboda has two large companies, Xylem Water Solutions (located on the brink of Linde) and Emmaboda Glass Works (&quot;Emmaboda Glasverk&quot;) which was founded in 1919. Emmaboda also has many medium-sized businesses.

<text>John Richard Hegley (born 1 October 1953) is an English performance poet, comedian, musician and songwriter. He has a reputation for wry and surreal humour, mostly performance-oriented or designed for younger audiences, and often sung or accompanied by music he himself plays; his material incorporates &quot;a mix of anecdotes, jokes, idiosyncratic observations, confessions and surreal narratives&quot;.

==Early life==
Hegley was born in the Newington Green area of Islington (north London, UK) into a Roman Catholic household. He was brought up in Luton and later Bristol, where he attended Rodway School (now Mangotsfield School). After school he worked as a bus conductor and civil servant before attending the University of Bradford, where he gained a BSc in European Literature and the History of Ideas and Sociology. Hegley has French ancestry (his father&#x27;s name was René) and claims he is descended from the composer Jean-Philippe Rameau. His paternal grandmother was a dancer with the Folies Bergère.

==Career==
Hegley began his performing career at London&#x27;s Comedy Store in 1980, and toured as one half of The Brown Paper Bag Brothers with Otiz Cannelloni. He received national exposure when he appeared with his backing band the Popticians on &quot;Carrott&#x27;s Lib&quot; in 1983, and recorded two sessions for John Peel in 1983 and 1984.

Hegley published his first poetry collection in 1984, &quot;Visions of the Bone Idol (Poems about Dogs and Glasses)&quot; 
– pieces from which were later incorporated into &quot;Glad to Wear Glasses&quot;. Further collections followed whose subject matter ranges from the surreal and the humorous through to the personal and emotional. There are several recurring themes in his work, including oddities such as glasses, dogs or Romans, along with self-targeted pathos and ribbing, and reminiscences of his childhood in Luton.

He was presenter of the Border Television series &quot;Word of Mouth&quot; – in which numerous contemporary poets performed their work – in 1990, and the BBC Radio series &quot;Hearing with Hegley&quot; from 1996 to 1999. His other television appearances include &quot;Wogan&quot; and &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot;. In 1998, Hegley&#x27;s poem &quot;Malcolm&quot; came second in a BBC survey to find Britain&#x27;s most popular comic poem. In 1999 he starred in a Simon Callow-directed revival of the musical &quot;The Pajama Game&quot; in London&#x27;s West End.

In September 1999, together with Simon Munnery, he wrote and performed in a comedy series for BBC Radio 4 entitled &quot;The Adventures of John and Tony&quot;.
Hegley frequently performs live and is a regular at the Edinburgh Festival. His stage act includes elements of poetry, music (he plays the mandolin and is often accompanied by a double bassist), comedy and references to Luton Town Football Club. He also likes to utilise audience participation in his shows, for example by having a dog drawing competition during the interval, or by asking his audience to try writing poetry themselves.

The University of Luton awarded him an honorary LL.D. in 2000, and he has also led creative writing courses at the university.

Hegley launched &quot;&quot;, a project using comedy to increase awareness of mental illness. He performed these shows in 2010 with other performers, including comic Mackenzie Taylor, talking about mental illness.

<doc id="1019071" wikidata="Q331570" url="?curid=1019071" title="Hopman Cup">
<text>The Hopman Cup is an international tennis tournament that plays mixed-gender teams on a country-by-country basis. It was first held in Perth, Western Australia each year from 1989 to 2019, played on indoor hardcourt, before being replaced on the calendar in 2020 by the now defunct ATP Cup. The tournament was played in an eight-team format, with the exception for the years 1990-1995, with twelve teams competing. It returned in July 2023 in Nice, France, played on outdoor clay, with six teams invited to participate.

==Format==
Unlike other major international team tennis tournaments such as the Davis Cup and the Fed Cup, which are for men or women only, the Hopman Cup is a mixed competition in which male and female players are on combined teams and represent their countries. Players are invited to attend and national coaches are not involved in selecting teams.

The tournament is a sanctioned official event in the calendar of the International Tennis Federation (ITF) but, while individual player results are tallied, they are not regarded as official ATP matches or included in the calculation of ATP or WTA rankings.

Eight nations are selected annually to compete in the Hopman Cup. The &quot;last&quot; team may be decided by play-offs between several nations before competition begins. For the 2007 Hopman Cup however, this did not occur, due to the Asian Qualifying Tournament creating the eighth team.

Each team consists of one male player and one female player. Each match-up between two teams at the event consists of:
*one women&#x27;s singles match
*one men&#x27;s singles match
*one mixed doubles match

The eight competing teams are separated into two groups of four (with two teams being seeded) and face-off against each of the other three teams in their group in a round-robin format. The seedings ensure that each group has approximately similar strength. The top team in each group then meet in a final to decide the champions.

If a player is injured then a player of a lower ranking of that nation may be the substitute.

The winning team receives a silver cup perpetual trophy and through 2013 the winning team members were presented with distinctive individual trophies in the shape of a tennis ball.

==History==
The Hopman Cup was created in 1989. The championship is named in honour of Harry Hopman (1906–1985), an Australian tennis player and coach who guided the country to 15 Davis Cup titles between 1938 and 1969. From the time the Hopman Cup was founded in 1989, it was attended each year by Hopman&#x27;s widow, his second wife Lucy, who travelled to the tournament from her home in the United States until she died in 2018. 

The 2005/06 Hopman Cup was the first elite-level tennis tournament in which the system was introduced allowing players to challenge point-ending line calls similar to that in clay court tournaments. The challenged calls are immediately reviewed on a large monitor using Hawk-Eye technology. Up to and including 2012, the venue was the Burswood Dome at the Burswood Entertainment Complex. The 20th Hopman Cup, in 2008, was intended to be the last held at the Burswood Dome, however this was extended until 2012 when the new Perth Arena was due for completion. From 2013 to 2019, it was played at the Perth Arena.

From 2014 to 2019, the Hopman Cup tournament director was Paul Kilderry after the resignation of Steve Ayles. Previously, the former Australian tennis player Paul McNamee, who played a key role in the founding of the championships, was the tournament director.

In 2019 for the 31st edition of the tournament, a record crowd of 14,064 witnessed the 2019 Hopman Cup match between United States and Switzerland. Roger Federer and Belinda Bencic won, with Federer becoming the first player to win the tournament three times. He and Belinda Bencic became the first pairing to successfully defend the title, having won it the previous year.

The Hopman Cup was not held in 2020 (it was replaced in the tennis calendar until 2022 by the now defunct ATP Cup). ITF president David Haggerty later announced the tournament would return in 2021. After the tournament was unable to be held in 2021, he announced it would return in 2022 instead. In December 2021, it was announced that the tournament would return, and will be played in Nice in 2023. The 2023 and 2024 editions would contract to six teams before expanding back to the original eight-team format in 2025.

In March 2024, it was decided that the Hopman Cup would not be held that year due to the 2024 Summer Olympics and would return in 2025. In February 2025, the tournament&#x27;s Twitter page announced that the event would be held from July 16-20 at a to-be-determined venue.

==Telecasts==
The Hopman Cup was originally broadcast by the Seven Network until 1994, then by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (1995–2010). From 2011, a five-year deal to broadcast the competition was signed by Network Ten, a deal that ended abruptly in November 2013. The Seven Network&#x27;s 7mate channel subsequently picked up the telecasting rights. The Nine Network broadcast the tournament in 2019.

<text>Bromölla () is a locality and the seat of Bromölla Municipality, Skåne County, Sweden with 7,595 inhabitants in 2010.

The town of Bromölla only consisted of a few houses until it began to grow about 100 years ago around a newly established limestone quarry, leading to the establishment of several ceramics industries. The area has grown up around the entailed estate of Årup and the pertaining parish of Ivetofta. As the railroad between Kristianstad and Sölvesborg established a station in 1886, the first ceramic industri - Ifö - was opened in 1887.

<text>Kristianstad (, ) is a city and the seat of Kristianstad Municipality, Scania County, Sweden with 40,145 inhabitants in 2016. During the last 15 years, it has gone from a garrison town to a developed commercial city, today attracting visitors in the summertime mainly from Germany, Denmark and The Netherlands.

==History==
The city was founded in 1614 by King Christian IV of Denmark (the city&#x27;s name literally means &#x27;Town of Christian&#x27;) as a planned city after the burning of the nearby town of Vä and moving the city rights of the neighbouring town of Vå and Åhus to the new town. The purpose of the town was to safeguard the eastern half of the Danish province of Scania against any future raids from Sweden in the north, but also as a symbol of the power of Christian himself. One of these raids had sacked the nearby town of Vä in 1612. Vä then lost its charter and the people were relocated to the new, better fortified city. The king also founded the town of Kristianopel in eastern Blekinge to serve a similar purpose.

Construction of the towns was a great prestige project for the king, and Kristianstad&#x27;s church is considered by many to be one of the most beautiful buildings constructed by King Christian IV, or even northern Europe&#x27;s most beautiful Renaissance church. This meant that the church was built considerably larger than there was initially use for. The king also wanted a castle or fortress constructed inside the town but shortage of funds made this impossible, of the intended castle only an arsenal was constructed which today serves as the main building of the local museum. Also in Christianstad the town planning of the Renaissance could be laid down for the first time at the foundation of the town. This makes the Kristianstad town centre of today exceptionally well-kept and easy to get around in.

In 1658 Scania, Kristianstad and the eastern third of Denmark was ceded to Sweden following the Treaty of Roskilde.

Pylyp Orlyk was after 1709 chosen as a Hetman in exile by the cossacks and the Swedish king Charles XII. While in Bender Orlyk wrote one of the first state constitutions in Europe. This Constitution of Pylyp Orlyk was confirmed by Charles XII and it also names him as &quot;the protector of Ukraine&quot;. After 1714 Orlyk now together with several other cossacks followed the Swedish king Charles XII to Sweden. Orlyk with his family and about 40 other Cossacks arrived in Ystad, Sweden in late November 1715. After some months in Ystad they lived in the city of Kristianstad for some years. Orlyk wrote numerous proclamations and essays about Ukraine including the 1710 Constitution of Pylyp Orlyk.

Kristianstad served as capital of Kristianstad County between 1719 and 1997. It now houses the administration and the regional parliament of the Skåne Regional Council. For a long time Kristianstad also was a very important garrison town, the Wendes Artillery Regiment (A 3) and the North Scanian Regiment (P 6) being the town&#x27;s most prominent military units. Also the town housed for many years the so-called Scanian Fortification Brigade. The Wendes Artillery Regiment served with distinction in the Napoleonic Wars. One of Sweden&#x27;s higher courts of appeal was located in Kristianstad before being moved to Malmö in 1917.

Until 1996, Kristianstad was a city of residence in Kristianstad County, but in 1997 merged with Skåne County. Since the county councils were also merged into Region Skåne, the city became the seat of its regional council from 1999. The County Administrative Court in Skåne County was also located in Kristianstad until 2008.

In Kristianstad, seven countries have maintained honorary consulates during different periods. A Royal Danish Vice Consulate was established in 1855 and elevated to a consulate in 2002, but was withdrawn in 2012. A North American consular agency existed 1873 — 1887 (the same man was the Danish deputy consul and North American consular agent). The independent Kingdom of Norway established a deputy consulate in 1907, which was, however, withdrawn in 1937, to be re-established in 1946 and elevated to a consulate in 1988, but it is now revoked. Argentina had a vice consulate 1911 — 1935. Finland also had a vice consulate in Kristianstad 1923 — 1925 and 1931 — 1967. Lithuania established a consulate in 1995 and it is the only consulate left in Kristianstad today. Germany established a consulate in 1996, but it is now withdrawn.

==Geography==
Sweden&#x27;s lowest point, at 2.41 meters below mean sea level, is located in Kristianstad. Because of this, parts of the city have to be protected from flooding by a system of levees and water pumps. To expand the city, large areas of low-lying wetlands have had to be walled in, especially to the east. To prevent future flooding of the city center, the existing levees are in the process of being reinforced and new levees against both Helge å and Hammarsjön are under construction. An extensive system of ponds and dams is also under construction. The threat of flooding became substantial during late winter 2002, when the greater part of the public park Tivoliparken was under water. However, the wetlands around the city are starting to be regarded more as an asset, not least thanks to the creation of Kristianstads Vattenrike Biosphere Reserve. Today the Vattenriket is a Unesco biosphere reserve.

==Climate==
Kristianstad has a humid continental climate.
Summers are warm and comparatively long by Swedish standards.

==Environmental==
Kristianstad has by now crossed a vital threshold, as the city and adjacent municipality, with a population of 80,000, in essence use no oil, natural gas or coal to warm homes and businesses, even throughout the extensive chilly winters. It is an absolute turnaround from 20 years ago, when all of its heating came from fossil fuels.

==Industry==
Absolut Vodka, owned by Pernod Ricard, is produced by the town of Åhus located within the municipality. Kristianstad was the main military seat in Scania for a long time, boosting military camps and trainings. After the reforms and military cutbacks of the 1990s all of these have been closed, although a new military presence is being established in nearby Rinkaby which holds an old military training ground. Also in and around Kristianstad are numerous enterprises concerned with agriculture and it is usually said that every Swede everyday eats something produced from Kristianstad. At the old garrison ground for the I6 North Scanian Infantry Regiment (later mechanized as Pansar Regiment 6) there is today the local Kristianstad Högskola which is specialized in educating teachers and nurses.

==Culture==
The Swedish Film industry (Svensk Filmindustri) commenced its activities in Kristianstad in the 1910s, before moving to Stockholm in 1920. Today the old studio is a museum where you can visit Sweden&#x27;s very first film studio, preserved and restored to its original condition from 1909. The pioneering days of film in Kristianstad with &#x27;Svenska bio&#x27; are the prelude to the heyday of Swedish film and its international breakthrough.

Kristianstad Art Gallery is located in the old post office building from 1917, designed by architect Erik Lallerstedt, and shares an entrance with the Kristianstad Regional Museum. Kristianstad Art Gallery is run by the cultural heritage organization Regionmuseet Skåne on behalf of Kristianstad Municipality and was inaugurated in December 2001. The focus is on contemporary art.

==Coat of arms==
The city&#x27;s coat of arms depicts two lions holding the King Christian IV&#x27;s crowned insignia, the monogram C4. The coat of arms was only slightly modified after the Swedish takeover following the 1658 Treaty of Roskilde in which the eastern third of Denmark was ceded to Sweden. Since 1971, the coat of arms is used by Kristianstad Municipality. A reason for the Swedes to continue using the old coat of arms could be its colours – blue and yellow.
At the end of the 19th century, Christianstads Enskilda Bank (founded in 1865) issued banknotes with portraits of Christian IV instead of the Swedish king (the individual banks&#x27; right to issue banknotes ceased in 1898).

==Events==
In 2011, Sweden hosted the 22nd World Scout Jamboree of the International Scout Movement. The Jamboree had about 40 000 participants from 144 countries and was organized at Rinkabyfältet, Kristianstad.

Also every summer there is a major beach handball tournament taking place in the seaside resort of Åhus in the municipality. The Åhus Beach handball Festival is Europe&#x27;s largest beach handball tournament. During 10 days over 1000 teams, 10000 players and 2300 leaders gather on the beach to compete in the sport. The festival was founded in 1997.

<text>Osby () is a locality and the seat of Osby Municipality, Scania County, Sweden with 7,157 inhabitants in 2010 and 13,238 inhabitants in 2022. It is the birthplace of the toy manufacturer BRIO, whose museum, the BRIO Lekoseum, remains in the town.

Osby&#x27;s history is tied to the arrival of the Southern Main Line railway in 1862. This development transformed Osby from a small farming village into a growing industrial hub, with sawmills, metal foundries, and other enterprises driving its expansion during the late 19th century and early 20th century.

== History ==
Osby&#x27;s transformation from a rural village into a town is closely tied to the arrival of the Southern Main Line railway in 1862, a pivotal moment in the town&#x27;s history. Before the railway, Osby was a quiet area dominated by farmland, with its center located northeast of the Osby church in what is now known as Gamleby. The village housed around 300 residents, with Marklunda, a neighboring settlement to the east, serving as a hub for travel and trade along the Växjö–Kristianstad road. Agriculture and livestock farming were the main activities, with ironmongery acting as a second source of income for many farmers.

With the railway&#x27;s opening, market activity shifted from Marklunda to Osby, and the town began to grow around the station. Early industries such as sawmills, a steam-powered tannery, and a metal foundry emerged, taking advantage of the region&#x27;s abundant natural resources, including timber. By the late 19th century, Osby’s sawmills were thriving, with timber floating along the Helge River to supply local and regional markets.

The townscape featured houses with ornate woodwork and gardens lining new streets like Jernvägsgatan and Storgatan. By 1900, Osby&#x27;s population had surpassed 1,000 residents, marking its transition into an urban center.

The entrepreneurial spirit of Osby’s residents played a key role in its growth. Innovators like Per Persson, who founded a metal foundry and even built a steamship for Osby Lake, exemplified this resourcefulness. This led to the establishment of numerous industries in the early 20th century, including the toy company BRIO, a torvströfabrik (peat moss factory), a foundry with a mechanical workshop, a steam sawmill, a gasworks and even educational institutions.

Some of this industrial development disappeared after World War I and gradually the landscape around Osby started changing. Previously open fields, pastures, and meadows have been replanted with coniferous forests. Many farmsteads have been shut down, with their buildings either abandoned or repurposed as holiday homes.
== Climate ==
Osby has an oceanic climate that retains a four-season characteristic. It has resemblances of moderate continental, with summers sometimes being very warm and winter lows dropping below freezing with regularity for a few months. Its southerly inland position has rendered it to be one of the few locations in the country that has reached in May. In spite of this summer averages are rather cool when compared with adjacent coastal areas.

== Transport ==
Osby is connected to the rest of Scania and to Småland by train and bus services provided by Skånetrafiken and . By car, Osby is accessible by the national road 15 from the east and west and by road 23 from the north and south.

<text>Elend is a dark ambient/neoclassical band formed in France in 1993 by composers and multi-instrumentalists Iskandar Hasnawi of France and Renaud Tschirner of Austria. The band&#x27;s name is German for &quot;misery.&quot; Their music can be described as a combination of contemporary classical music and gothic.

==Stylistic overview==
Early Elend albums utilized samplers and synthesizers to create a dense and horrifying orchestral sound. In their last three albums for the &quot;Winds Cycle&quot;, Elend&#x27;s sound was broadened; they did now rely almost entirely on acoustic instruments and chamber orchestras instead of synthesizers, giving them a more full and natural sound. They did also include electronic and industrial elements in some of their pieces.

Elend&#x27;s sound tended toward the aggressive, containing harsh dissonance, screaming and growled vocals in a manner associated with certain types of contemporary classical music. Vocalists, spoken-word passages and occasional rock-like song structures lend the music elements from art rock and gothic rock. Though Elend&#x27;s music is not any form of metal, Elend&#x27;s members are associated with numerous metal acts and the metal record label Holy Records, and their harsh sound has led to Elend&#x27;s music being embraced by a metal-listening audience.

The &quot;Winds Cycle&quot; was originally intended to consist of five albums, however it was changed to a trilogy prior to the release of &quot;A World in Their Screams&quot;. In an interview with a French magazine posted in June 2007 on their website, Iskander Hasnawi indicated that the costs and difficulties of recording the orchestral music associated with Elend have made it impossible to continue with the Elend project. Both composers will be continuing with personal projects, including L&#x27;Ensemble Orphique. In January 2019, a message was posted on the Elend Facebook page promising new music in 2019-2020.

<doc id="1019091" wikidata="Q1482034" url="?curid=1019091" title="Combat stress reaction">
<text>Combat stress reaction (CSR) is acute behavioral disorganization as a direct result of the trauma of war. Also known as &quot;combat fatigue&quot;, &quot;battle fatigue&quot;, &quot;operational exhaustion&quot;, or &quot;battle/war neurosis&quot;, it has some overlap with the diagnosis of acute stress reaction used in civilian psychiatry. It is historically linked to shell shock and is sometimes a precursor to post-traumatic stress disorder.

Combat stress reaction is an acute reaction that includes a range of behaviors resulting from the stress of battle that decrease the combatant&#x27;s fighting efficiency. The most common symptoms are fatigue, slower reaction times, indecision, disconnection from one&#x27;s surroundings, and the inability to prioritize. Combat stress reaction is generally short-term and should not be confused with acute stress disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, or other long-term disorders attributable to combat stress, although any of these may commence as a combat stress reaction. The US Army uses the term/initialism COSR (combat stress reaction) in official medical reports. This term can be applied to any stress reaction in the military unit environment. Many reactions look like symptoms of mental illness (such as panic, extreme anxiety, depression, and hallucinations), but they are only transient reactions to the traumatic stress of combat and the cumulative stresses of military operations.

In World War I, shell shock was considered a psychiatric illness resulting from injury to the nerves during combat. The nature of trench warfare meant that about 10% of the fighting soldiers were killed (compared to 4.5% during World War II) and the total proportion of troops who became casualties (killed or wounded) was about 57%. Whether a person with shell-shock was considered &quot;wounded&quot; or &quot;sick&quot; depended on the circumstances. Soldiers were personally faulted for their mental breakdown rather than their war experience. The large proportion of World War I veterans in the European population meant that the symptoms were common to the culture.

In World War II it was determined by the US Army that the time it took for a soldier to experience combat fatigue while fighting on the front lines was somewhere between 60 and 240 days, depending on the intensity and frequency of combat. This condition isn&#x27;t new among the combat soldiers and was something that soldiers also experienced in World War I as mentioned above, but this time around the military medicine was gaining a better grasp and understanding of what exactly was causing it. What had been known in previous wars as &quot;nostalgia&quot;, &quot;old sergeant&#x27;s disease&quot;, and &quot;shell shock&quot;, became known as &quot;combat fatigue&quot;.
==Signs and symptoms==
Combat stress reaction symptoms align with the symptoms also found in psychological trauma, which is closely related to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). CSR differs from PTSD (among other things) in that a PTSD diagnosis requires a duration of symptoms over one month, which CSR does not.

===Fatigue-related symptoms===
The most common stress reactions include:
*The slowing of reaction time
*Slowness of thought
*Difficulty prioritizing tasks
*Difficulty initiating routine tasks
*Preoccupation with minor issues and familiar tasks
*Indecision and lack of concentration
*Loss of initiative with fatigue
*Exhaustion
===Autonomic nervous system – autonomic arousal===

*Headaches
*Back pains
*Inability to relax
*Shaking and tremors
*Sweating
*Nausea and vomiting
*Loss of appetite
*Abdominal distress
*Frequency of urination
*Urinary incontinence
*Heart palpitations
*Hyperventilation
*Dizziness
*Insomnia
*Nightmares
*Restless sleep
*Excessive sleep
*Excessive startle
*Hypervigilance
*Heightened sense of threat
*Anxiety
*Irritability
*Depression
*Substance abuse
*Loss of adaptability
*Attempted suicides
*Disruptive behavior
*Mistrust of others
*Confusion
*Extreme feeling of losing control
====Battle casualty rates====
The ratio of stress casualties to battle casualties varies with the intensity of the fighting. With intense fighting, it can be as high as 1:1. In low-level conflicts, it can drop to 1:10 (or less).
Modern warfare embodies the principles of continuous operations with an expectation of higher combat stress casualties.

The World War II European Army rate of stress casualties of 1 in 10 (101:1,000) troops per annum is skewed downward from both its norm and peak by data by low rates during the last years of the war.

==Diagnosis==
The following PIE principles were in place for the &quot;not yet diagnosed nervous&quot; (NYDN) cases:
* Proximity – treat the casualties close to the front and within sound of the fighting.
* Immediacy – treat them without delay and not wait until the wounded were all dealt with.
* Expectancy – ensure that everyone had the expectation of their return to the front after a rest and replenishment.

United States medical officer Thomas W. Salmon is often quoted as the originator of these PIE principles. However, his real strength came from going to Europe and learning from the Allies and then instituting the lessons. By the end of the war, Salmon had set up a complete system of units and procedures that was then the &quot;world&#x27;s best practice&quot;. After the war, he maintained his efforts in educating society and the military. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal for his contributions.

Effectiveness of the PIE approach has not been confirmed by studies of CSR, and there is some evidence that it is not effective in preventing PTSD.

US services now use the more recently developed BICEPS principles:
* Brevity
* Immediacy
* Centrality or contact
* Expectancy
* Proximity
* Simplicity

===Between the wars===
The British government produced a &quot;Report of the War Office Committee of Inquiry into &quot;Shell-Shock&quot;&quot;, which was published in 1922. Recommendations from this included:

Part of the concern was that many British veterans were receiving pensions and had long-term disabilities.

By 1939, some 120,000 British ex-servicemen had received final awards for primary psychiatric disability or were still drawing pensions – about 15% of all pensioned disabilities – and another 44,000 or so were getting pensions for &#x27;soldier&#x27;s heart&#x27; or effort syndrome. There is, though, much that statistics do not show, because in terms of psychiatric effects, pensioners were just the tip of a huge iceberg.&quot;

===World War II===

====American====
At the outbreak of World War II, most in the United States military had forgotten the treatment lessons of World War I. Screening of applicants was initially rigorous, but experience eventually showed it to lack great predictive power.

The US entered the war in December 1941. Only in November 1943 was a psychiatrist added to the table of organization of each division, and this policy was not implemented in the Mediterranean Theater of Operations until March 1944. By 1943, the US Army was using the term &quot;exhaustion&quot; as the initial diagnosis of psychiatric cases, and the general principles of military psychiatry were being used. General Patton&#x27;s slapping incident was in part the spur to institute forward treatment for the Italian invasion of September 1943. The importance of unit cohesion and membership of a group as a protective factor emerged.

John Appel found that the average American infantryman in Italy was &quot;worn out&quot; in 200 to 240 days and concluded that the American soldier &quot;fights for his buddies or because his self respect won&#x27;t let him quit&quot;. After several months in combat, the soldier lacked reasons to continue to fight because he had proven his bravery in battle and was no longer with most of the fellow soldiers he trained with. Appel helped implement a 180-day limit for soldiers in active combat and suggested that the war be made more meaningful, emphasizing their enemies&#x27; plans to conquer the United States, encouraging soldiers to fight to prevent what they had seen happen in other countries happen to their families. Other psychiatrists believed that letters from home discouraged soldiers by increasing nostalgia and needlessly mentioning problems soldiers could not solve. William Menninger said after the war, &quot;It might have been wise to have had a nation-wide educational course in letter writing to soldiers&quot;, and Edward Strecker criticized &quot;moms&quot; (as opposed to mothers) who, after failing to &quot;wean&quot; their sons, damaged morale through letters.

Airmen flew far more often in the Southwest Pacific than in Europe, and although rest time in Australia was scheduled, there was no fixed number of missions that would produce transfer out of combat, as was the case in Europe. Coupled with the monotonous, hot, sickly environment, the result was bad morale that jaded veterans quickly passed along to newcomers. After a few months, epidemics of combat fatigue would drastically reduce the efficiency of units. Flight surgeons reported that the men who had been at jungle airfields longest were in bad shape:
::Many have chronic dysentery or other disease, and almost all show chronic fatigue states. ... They appear listless, unkempt, careless, and apathetic with almost mask-like facial expression. Speech is slow, thought content is poor, they complain of chronic headaches, insomnia, memory defect, feel forgotten, worry about themselves, are afraid of new assignments, have no sense of responsibility, and are hopeless about the future.

====British====
Unlike the Americans, the British leaders firmly held the lessons of World War I. It was estimated that aerial bombardment would kill up to 35,000 a day, but the Blitz killed only 40,000 in total. The expected torrent of civilian mental breakdown did not occur. The Government turned to World War I doctors for advice on those who did have problems. The PIE principles were generally used. However, in the British Army, since most of the World War I doctors were too old for the job, young, analytically trained psychiatrists were employed. Army doctors &quot;appeared to have no conception of breakdown in war and its treatment, though many of them had served in the 1914–1918 war.&quot; The first Middle East Force psychiatric hospital was set up in 1942. With D-Day for the first month there was a policy of holding casualties for only 48 hours before they were sent back over the Channel. This went firmly against the expectancy principle of PIE.

Appel believed that British soldiers were able to continue to fight almost twice as long as their American counterparts because the British had better rotation schedules and because they, unlike the Americans, &quot;fight for survival&quot; – for the British soldiers, the threat from the Axis powers was much more real, given Britain&#x27;s proximity to mainland Europe, and the fact that Germany was concurrently conducting air raids and bombarding British industrial cities. Like the Americans, British doctors believed that letters from home often needlessly damaged soldiers&#x27; morale.

====Canadian====
The Canadian Army recognized combat stress reaction as &quot;Battle Exhaustion&quot; during the Second World War and classified it as a separate type of combat wound. Historian Terry Copp has written extensively on the subject. In Normandy, &quot;The infantry units engaged in the battle also experienced a rapid rise in the number of battle exhaustion cases with several hundred men evacuated due to the stress of combat. Regimental Medical Officers were learning that neither elaborate selection methods nor extensive training could prevent a considerable number of combat soldiers from breaking down.&quot;

====Germans====
In his history of the pre-Nazi Freikorps paramilitary organizations, &quot;Vanguard of Nazism&quot;, historian Robert G. L. Waite describes some of the emotional effects of World War I on German troops, and refers to a phrase he attributes to Göring: men who could not become &quot;de-brutalized&quot;.

In an interview, Dr Rudolf Brickenstein stated that:

However, as World War II progressed there was a profound rise in stress casualties from 1% of hospitalizations in 1935 to 6% in 1942. Another German psychiatrist reported after the war that during the last two years, about a third of all hospitalizations at Ensen were due to war neurosis. It is probable that there was both less of a true problem and less perception of a problem.

====Finns====
The Finnish attitudes to &quot;war neurosis&quot; were especially tough. Psychiatrist Harry Federley, who was the head of the Military Medicine, considered shell shock as a sign of weak character and lack of moral fibre. His treatment for war neurosis was simple: the patients were to be bullied and harassed until they returned to front line service.

Earlier, during the Winter War, several Finnish machine gun operators on the Karelian Isthmus theatre became mentally unstable after repelling several unsuccessful Soviet human wave assaults on fortified Finnish positions.

===Post-World War II developments===
Simplicity was added to the PIE principles by the Israelis: in their view, treatment should be brief, supportive, and could be provided by those without sophisticated training.

====Peacekeeping stresses====
Peacekeeping provides its own stresses because its emphasis on rules of engagement contains the roles for which soldiers are trained. Causes include witnessing or experiencing the following:
* Constant tension and threat of conflict.
* Threat of land mines and booby traps.
* Close contact with severely injured and dead people.
* Deliberate maltreatment and atrocities, possibly involving civilians.
* Cultural issues.
* Separation and home issues.
* Risk of disease including HIV.
* Threat of exposure to toxic agents.
* Mission problems.
* Return to service.

==Pathophysiology==

===SNS activation===

Many of the symptoms initially experienced by people with CSR are effects of an extended activation of the human body&#x27;s fight-or-flight response. The fight-or-flight response involves a general sympathetic nervous system discharge in reaction to a perceived stressor and prepares the body to fight or run from the threat causing the stress. Catecholamine hormones, such as adrenaline or noradrenaline, facilitate immediate physical reactions associated with a preparation for violent muscular action. Although the flight-or-fight-response normally ends with the removal of the threat, the constant mortal danger in combat zones likewise constantly and acutely stresses soldiers.

===General adaptation syndrome===

The process whereby the human body responds to extended stress is known as general adaptation syndrome (GAS). After the initial fight-or-flight response, the body becomes more resistant to stress in an attempt to dampen the sympathetic nervous response and return to homeostasis. During this period of resistance, physical and mental symptoms of CSR may be drastically reduced as the body attempts to cope with the stress. Long combat involvement, however, may keep the body from homeostasis and thereby deplete its resources and render it unable to normally function, sending it into the third stage of GAS: exhaustion. Sympathetic nervous activation remains in the exhaustion phase and reactions to stress are markedly sensitized as fight-or-flight symptoms return. If the body remains in a state of stress, then much more severe symptoms of CSR as cardiovascular and digestive involvement may present themselves. Extended exhaustion can permanently damage the body.

==Treatment==
=== 7 Rs ===
The British Army treated Operational Stress Reaction according to the 7 Rs:
*Recognition – identify that the individual has an Operational Stress Reaction
*Respite – provide a short period of relief from the front line
*Rest – allow rest and recovery
*Recall – give the individual the chance to recall and discuss the experiences that have led to the reaction
*Reassurance – inform them that their reaction is normal and they will recover
*Rehabilitation – improve the physical and mental health of the patient until they no longer show symptoms
*Return – allow the soldier to return to their unit

===Predeployment preparation===

====Screening====
Historically, screening programs that have attempted to preclude soldiers exhibiting personality traits thought to predispose them to CSR have been a total failure. Part of this failure stems from the inability to base CSR morbidity on one or two personality traits. Full psychological work-ups are expensive and inconclusive, while pen and paper tests are ineffective and easily faked. In addition, studies conducted following WWII screening programs showed that psychological disorders present during military training did not accurately predict stress disorders during combat.

====Cohesion====
While it is difficult to measure the effectiveness of such a subjective term, soldiers who reported in a WWII study that they had a &quot;higher than average&quot; sense of camaraderie and pride in their unit were more likely to report themselves ready for combat and less likely to develop CSR or other stress disorders. Soldiers with a &quot;lower than average&quot; sense of cohesion with their unit were more susceptible to stress illness.

====Training====
Stress exposure training or SET is a common component of most modern military training. There are three steps to an effective stress exposure program.

*Providing knowledge of the stress environment

Soldiers with a knowledge of both the emotional and physical signs and symptoms of CSR are much less likely to have a critical event that reduces them below fighting capability. Instrumental information, such as breathing exercises that can reduce stress and suggestions not to look at the faces of enemy dead, is also effective at reducing the chance of a breakdown.

*Skills acquisition

Cognitive control strategies can be taught to soldiers to help them recognize stressful and situationally detrimental thoughts and repress those thoughts in combat situations. Such skills have been shown to reduce anxiety and improve task performance.

*Confidence building through application and practice

Soldiers who feel confident in their own abilities and those of their squad are far less likely to develop combat stress reaction. Training in stressful conditions that mimic those of an actual combat situation builds confidence in the abilities of themselves and the squad. As this training can actually induce some of the stress symptoms it seeks to prevent, stress levels should be increased incrementally as to allow the soldiers time to adapt.

Narcosynthesis

A technique that was used to treat PTSD disorders during World War II by using sodium pentothal was created by psychiatrists Roy Grinker and John Spiegel. During the treatment, they offered soldiers an opportunity to abreact their trauma by re-experiencing it in a hospital environment in the presence of supportive, protective, and understanding therapists. The therapists induced a dream state or twilight sleep by injecting sodium pentothal, after which most soldiers spontaneously started to express their anxiety. While the psychiatrist fulfilled the soldier&#x27;s need for protection, the soldier&#x27;s ego was nurtured, and the soldier was encouraged to abreact his trauma. 

==Prognosis==
Figures from the 1982 Lebanon war showed that with proximal treatment, 90% of CSR casualties returned to their unit, usually within 72 hours. With rearward treatment, only 40% returned to their unit. It was also found that treatment efficacy went up with the application of a variety of front line treatment principles versus just one treatment. In Korea, similar statistics were seen, with 85% of US battle fatigue casualties returned to duty within three days and 10% returned to limited duties after several weeks.

Though these numbers seem to promote the claims that proximal PIE or BICEPS treatment is generally effective at reducing the effects of combat stress reaction, other data suggests that long term PTSD effects may result from the hasty return of affected individuals to combat. Both PIE and BICEPS are meant to return as many soldiers as possible to combat, and may actually have adverse effects on the long-term health of service members who are rapidly returned to the front-line after combat stress control treatment. Although the PIE principles were used extensively in the Vietnam War, the post traumatic stress disorder lifetime rate for Vietnam veterans was 30% in a 1989 US study and 21% in a 1996 Australian study. In a study of Israeli Veterans of the 1973 Yom Kippur War, 37% of veterans diagnosed with CSR during combat were later diagnosed with PTSD, compared with 14% of control veterans.

==Controversy==
There is significant controversy with the PIE and BICEPS principles. Throughout a number of wars, but notably during the Vietnam War, there has been a conflict among doctors about sending distressed soldiers back to combat. During the Vietnam War this reached a peak with much discussion about the ethics of this process. Proponents of the PIE and BICEPS principles argue that it leads to a reduction of long-term disability but opponents argue that combat stress reactions lead to long-term problems such as post-traumatic stress disorder.

The use of psychiatric drugs to treat people with CSR has also attracted criticism, as some military psychiatrists have come to question the efficacy of such drugs on the long-term health of veterans. Concerns have been expressed as to the effect of pharmaceutical treatment on an already elevated substance abuse rate among former people with CSR.

Recent research has caused an increasing number of scientists to believe that there may be a physical (i.e., neurocerebral damage) rather than psychological basis for blast trauma. As traumatic brain injury and combat stress reaction have very different causes yet result in similar neurologic symptoms, researchers emphasize the need for greater diagnostic care.

<text>Omphalotus illudens, commonly known as the eastern jack-o&#x27;lantern mushroom, is a large, orange mushroom that is often found in clumps on decaying stumps, buried roots, or at the base of hardwood trees in eastern North America. Its gills often exhibit a weak green bioluminescence when fresh. This green glow has been mentioned in several journal articles, which state that the phenomenon can persist up to 40–50 hours after the mushroom has been picked. It is believed that this display serves to attract insects to the mushroom&#x27;s gills during nighttime, which can then distribute its spores across a wider area.

&quot;Omphalotus illudens&quot; is sometimes confused with edible chanterelles, but can be distinguished by its thicker, fleshier appearance, tendency to form large clusters, and clearly separated caps when young. Unlike chanterelles, the Eastern jack-o&#x27;-lantern is poisonous to humans when eaten, whether raw or cooked, and typically causes vomiting, cramps, and diarrhea. Although some older literature claims the name is synonymous with &quot;Omphalotus olearius&quot;, phylogenetic analysis confirms the two as distinct species.

==Toxicity==
The poisonous chemical compounds illudin S and illudin M were isolated from &quot;Omphalotus illudens&quot;. In addition to their antibacterial and antifungal effects, illudins appear to be the cause of human toxicity when these mushrooms are eaten raw or cooked. Muscarine has also been indirectly implicated in toxicity, but modern studies to demonstrate its presence in &quot;O. illudens&quot; are needed.

The cytotoxic effect of illudin is of interest for treating some cancers, but illudin itself is too poisonous to use directly so it must first be chemically modified. Inside human cells, illudin S reacts with DNA and creates a type of DNA damage that blocks transcription. This block can only be relieved by a repair system called nucleotide excision repair. Damage in non-transcribed DNA areas is left unrepaired by the cell. This property was exploited by the company MGI Pharma to develop an illudin-derivative called Irofulven for use as a cancer treatment. Its application is still in the experimental phase.

<doc id="1019093" wikidata="Q1263223" url="?curid=1019093" title="Luciferianism">
<text>Luciferianism is a belief system that venerates the essential characteristics that are affixed to Lucifer, the name of various mythological and religious figures associated with the planet Venus. The tradition usually reveres Lucifer not as the Devil, but as a destroyer, a guardian, liberator, light bringer or guiding spirit to darkness, or even the true god. According to Ethan Doyle White of the Britannica, among those who &quot;called themselves Satanists or Luciferians&quot;, some insist that Lucifer is an entity separate from Satan, while others maintain &quot;the two names as synonyms for the same being&quot;.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;Lucifer&quot; is taken from the Latin Vulgate, which translates הֵילֵל as &quot;lucifer&quot;. The Biblical Hebrew word הֵילֵל, which occurs only once in the Hebrew Bible, has been transliterated as &quot;hêlêl&quot;, or &quot;heylel&quot;. The Septuagint renders הֵילֵל in Greek as ἑωσφόρος (&quot;heōsphoros&quot;), a name, literally &quot;bringer of dawn&quot;, for the morning star.

According to both Christian and Jewish exegesis, in Chapter 14 of the Book of Isaiah, the King of Babylon (Nebuchadnezzar II), conqueror of Jerusalem, is condemned in a prophetic vision by the prophet Isaiah and is called the &quot;Morning Star&quot; (planet Venus). The Hebrew text in this chapter says, . &quot;Helel ben Shahar&quot; may refer to the Morning Star, but the text in Isaiah 14 gives no indication that Helel was a star or planet.

Later Christian tradition came to use the Latin word for &quot;morning star&quot;, &quot;lucifer&quot;, as a proper name (&quot;Lucifer&quot;) for the Devil; as he was before his fall. As a result, &quot;Lucifer&quot; has become a by-word for Satan or the Devil in the church and in popular literature&quot;, as in Dante Alighieri&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot;, Joost van den Vondel&#x27;s &quot;Lucifer&quot; and John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; (1667). However, the Latin word never came to be used almost exclusively, as in English, in this way, and was applied to others also, including Jesus. The image of a morning star fallen from the sky is generally believed among scholars to have a parallel in Canaanite mythology.

==History==

===Medieval===
The Luciferian label—in the sense of Lucifer-worshipper—was first used in the &quot;Gesta Treverorum&quot; in 1231 for a religious circle led by a woman named Lucardis (Luckhardis). It was said that in private she lamented the fall of Lucifer (Satan) and yearned for his restoration to heavenly rule. The sect was exposed by the Papal Inquisition. In 1234, Pope Gregory IX issued the bull &quot;Vox in Rama&quot; calling for a crusade against the Stedinger, who were accused of Luciferianism. The bull contains a detailed description of supposed rites and beliefs. This description was repeated and occasionally expanded in the following centuries, but &quot;modern historiography agrees on their entirely fictitious nature&quot;. The actual identity of the heretics accused of Luciferianism is often difficult to ascertain. Those of the 13th-century Rhineland appear to have been Cathars (Alexander Patschovsky) or a distinct off-shoot of the Cathars (Piotr Czarnecki).

In the 14th century, the term Luciferians was applied to what appear to have been Waldensians. They were persecuted under the Luciferian label in Schweidnitz in 1315 and in Angermünde in 1336. In 1392–1394, when some four hundred Luciferians from Brandenburg and Pomerania were brought before the inquisitor Peter Zwicker, he exonerated them of devil-worship and correctly identified them as Waldensians. At the same time, the inquisitor Antonio di Settimo in Piedmont believed the local Waldensians to be Luciferians.

===Early modern===

&quot;Lucifer the Lightbearer&quot; was an individualist anarchist journal published in the United States by Moses Harman in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It has been reported that &quot;the title was selected, stated Harman, because it expressed the paper&#x27;s mission. Lucifer, the name given to the morning star by the people of the ancient world, served as the symbol of the publication and represented the ushering in of a new day. He declared that freethinkers had sought to redeem and glorify the name Lucifer while theologians cursed him as the prince of the fallen angels. Harman suggested that Lucifer would take on the role of an educator. &#x27;The God of the Bible doomed mankind to perpetual ignorance,&#x27; wrote Harman, &#x27;and [people] would never have known Good from Evil if Lucifer had not told them how to become as wise as the gods themselves.

&quot;Lucifer&quot; was a publication edited by the influential occultist Helena Blavatsky. The journal was first published by Blavatsky. From 1889 until Blavatsky&#x27;s death in May 1891, Annie Besant was a co-editor. Rudolf Steiner&#x27;s writings, which formed the basis for anthroposophy, characterised Lucifer as a spiritual opposite to Ahriman, with Christ between the two forces, mediating a balanced path for humanity. Lucifer represents an intellectual, imaginative and otherworldly force which might be associated with visions, subjectivity, psychosis and fantasy. He associated Lucifer with the religious and philosophical cultures of Egypt, Rome, and Greece. Steiner believed that Lucifer, as a supersensible Being, had incarnated in China about 3000 years before the birth of Christ.

In what is known as the Taxil hoax, Léo Taxil (1854–1907) claimed that Freemasonry is associated with worshipping Lucifer. He alleged that leading Freemason Albert Pike had addressed &quot;[t]he 23 Supreme Confederated Councils of the world&quot; (an invention of Taxil), instructing them that Lucifer was God, and was in opposition to the evil god Adonai. Supporters of Freemasonry contend that, when Albert Pike and other Masonic scholars spoke about the &quot;Luciferian path&quot; or the &quot;energies of Lucifer&quot;, they were referring to the Morning Star, the light bearer, the search for light, the very antithesis of dark, Satanic evil. Taxil promoted a book by Diana Vaughan (actually written by himself, as he later confessed publicly) that purported to reveal a highly secret ruling body called the Palladium, which controlled the organization and had a Satanic agenda. As described by &quot;Freemasonry Disclosed&quot; in 1897:
Taxil&#x27;s work and Pike&#x27;s address continue to be quoted by anti-Masonic groups.

In &quot;Devil-Worship in France&quot;, Arthur Edward Waite compared Taxil&#x27;s work to what today would be called a tabloid story, replete with logical and factual inconsistencies.

Madeline Montalban was an English astrologer and witch. She co-founded the esoteric organisation known as the Order of the Morning Star (OMS), through which she propagated her own form of Luciferianism. In 1952, she met Nicholas Heron, with whom she entered into a relationship. An engraver, photographer, and former journalist for the &quot;Brighton Argus&quot;, he shared her interest in the occult and together they developed a magical system based upon Luciferianism, the veneration of the deity Lucifer, or Lumiel, whom they considered to be a benevolent angelic deity. In 1956, they founded the Order of the Morning Star, or &quot;Ordo Stella Matutina&quot; (OSM), propagating it through a correspondence course. The couple sent out lessons to those who paid the necessary fees over a series of weeks, eventually leading to the twelfth lesson, which contained &quot;The Book of Lumiel&quot;, a short work written by Montalban that documented her understanding of Lumiel, or Lucifer, and his involvement with humankind. The couple initially lived together in Torrington Place, London, from where they ran the course; but in 1961 moved to the coastal town of Southsea in Hampshire, where there was greater room for Heron&#x27;s engraving equipment.

In Anton LaVey&#x27;s &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot;, Lucifer is one of the four crown princes of hell, particularly that of the East, the &quot;lord of the air&quot;, and is described as the bringer of light, the morning star, intellectualism, and enlightenment. The title &quot;lord of the air&quot; is based upon Ephesians 2:2, which uses the phrase &quot;prince of the power of the air&#x27;&quot; to refer to Satan.

In &quot;Rules for Radicals&quot; (his final work, published in 1971 one year before his death), the prominent American community organizer and writer Saul Alinsky wrote at the end of his personal acknowledgements:

Author Michael W. Ford has written on Lucifer as a &quot;mask&quot; of the adversary, a motivator and illuminating force of the mind and subconscious.

==Notable organizations==
=== Fraternitas Saturni ===

Stephen Flowers, in his book on the German magical order Fraternitas Saturni (FS), says that &quot;the FS is (or was) the most unabashedly Luciferian organization in the modern Western occult revival&quot;.

===Greater Church of Lucifer===

The one known brick and mortar church having some connection to Lucifer, &quot;The Greater Church of Lucifer&quot;, located in Old Town Spring, Texas, opened 30 October 2015 and closed less than one year later.
In 2014, Luciferians founded a worldwide organization for Luciferians from Houston, Texas, known as the Greater Church of Lucifer (GCoL) under the leadership of church founder Jacob McKelvy, co-presidents Michael W. Ford and Jeremy Crow, founder of the Luciferian Research Society. In 2017 McKelvy converted to Christianity. Michael W. Ford and his wife have described their religion as &quot;Luciferian witchcraft&quot;.

In 2015, the GCoL opened a house of worship in Old Town Spring, Texas, with several dozen members. (They had previously contacted online.) Over a hundred local residents, mainly Catholic, protested the opening of the church.

The town of Old Town Spring suffered from a boycott in response to the church, The church itself had windows smashed and its roof damaged after someone sawed off the branch of a 200-year-old pecan tree hanging over the church in the middle of the night. Ford stated that The Greater Church of Lucifer was forced to shut down one year later because their landlord refused to renew their lease after receiving death threats.

As of 2024 a website called the Assembly of Light Bearers stated that it is &quot;the successor guild&quot; for the Greater Church of Lucifer, following the church&#x27;s &quot;(at least temporarily)&quot; closing, and that &quot;the ALB is drastically different in structure and purpose from the GCOL&quot;.

<doc id="1019096" wikidata="Q68012161" url="?curid=1019096" title="Moral nihilism">
<text>Moral nihilism (also called ethical nihilism) is the meta-ethical view that nothing is morally right or morally wrong and that morality does not exist.

Moral nihilism is distinct from moral relativism, which allows for actions to be wrong relative to a particular culture or individual. It is also distinct from expressivism, according to which when we make moral claims, &quot;We are not making an effort to describe the way the world is ... we are venting our emotions, commanding others to act in certain ways, or revealing a plan of action&quot;.
Holding nihilism does not necessarily imply that one should give up using moral or ethical language; some nihilists contend that it remains a useful tool. In fact Mackie and other contemporary defenders of Error Theory, such as Richard Joyce, defend the use of moral or ethical talk and action even in knowledge of their fundamental falsity. The legitimacy of this activity is a subject of debate in philosophy.

==Forms of nihilism==
Moral nihilists agree that all claims such as &#x27;murder is morally wrong&#x27; are not true. But different nihilistic views differ in two ways.

Some may say that such claims are neither true nor false; others say that they are all false.

Nihilists differ in the &quot;scope&quot; of their theories. Error theorists typically claim that it is only distinctively moral claims which are false; practical nihilists claim that there are no reasons for action of any kind; some nihilists extend this claim to include reasons for belief.

=== Ethical language: false versus not truth-apt ===
J. L. Mackie argues that moral assertions are only true if there are moral properties, but because there are none, all such claims are false. Under such a view moral propositions which express beliefs are then systematically in error. For under Mackie&#x27;s view, if there are to be moral properties, they must be &quot;objective&quot; and therefore not amenable to differences in subjective desires and preferences. Moreover any claims that these moral properties, if they did exist would need to be &quot;intrinsically&quot; motivating by being in some primitive relation to our consciousness. They must be able of guiding us morally just by the fact of being in some clear awareness of their truth.

Other versions of the theory claim that moral assertions are not true because they are neither true nor false. This form of moral nihilism claims that moral beliefs and assertions &quot;presuppose&quot; the existence of moral facts that do not exist. Consider, for example, the claim that the present king of France is bald. Some argue that this claim is neither true nor false because it presupposes that there is currently a king of France, but there is not. The claim suffers from &quot;presupposition failure&quot;. Richard Joyce argues for this form of moral nihilism under the name &quot;fictionalism&quot;.

===The scope question===
Error theory is built on three principles:

# There are no moral features in this world; nothing is right or wrong.
# Therefore, no moral judgments are true. 
# However, our sincere moral judgments try, but always fail, to describe the moral features of things.

Thus, we always lapse into error when thinking in moral terms. We are trying to state the truth when we make moral judgments. But since there is no moral truth, all of our moral claims are mistaken. Hence the error. These three principles lead to the conclusion that there is no moral knowledge. Knowledge requires truth. If there is no moral truth, there can be no moral knowledge. Thus moral values are purely chimerical.

==Applied ethics==
A pressing question is how one might apply the belief that there are no objective morals. Perhaps the most common response, and the position which Mackie adopts, is to view moralizing as an inherently useful practice, and that everyone is better off behaving in a moralistic manner.

On the other hand, Richard Garner advocated for the idea of “moral abolitionism”. He argues that, if one were to believe that there are no objective morals, then to engage in moralism is a deceptive behavior. It is wrong because it harms one’s epistemological integrity. Furthermore, by refusing to make moral judgements generally, people would be more likely to engage with others in a more genuine fashion. The social benefit is that “we will find that there will be less to argue about, and that our conflicts and disagreements with others, at last seen for what they are, can be addressed and resolved”. Garner encouraged people to adhere to an alternative to traditional normative morality: &quot;informed, compassionate amoralism,&quot; a blend of compassion, non-duplicity, and clarity of language that he believed would nurture our capability for tolerance, creation, and cooperation.

== Arguments for nihilism==
=== Argument from queerness ===
The most prominent argument for nihilism is the argument from queerness.

J. L. Mackie argues that there are no objective ethical values, by arguing that they would be queer (strange):If there were objective values, then they would be entities or qualities or relations of a very strange sort, utterly different from anything else in the universe.

For all those who also find such entities queer (&quot;prima facie&quot; implausible), there is reason to doubt the existence of objective values.

In his book &quot;Morality without Foundations: A Defense of Ethical Contextualism&quot; (1999), Mark Timmons provides a reconstruction of Mackie&#x27;s views in the form of the two related arguments. These are based on the rejection of properties, facts, and relationships that do not fit within the worldview of philosophical naturalism, the idea &quot;that everything—including any particular events, facts, properties, and so on—is part of the natural physical world that science investigates&quot; (1999, p. 12). Timmons adds, &quot;The undeniable attraction of this outlook in contemporary philosophy no doubt stems from the rise of modern science and the belief that science is our best avenue for discovering the nature of reality&quot;.

There are several ways in which moral properties are supposedly queer:
* our ordinary moral discourse purports to refer to intrinsically prescriptive properties and facts &quot;that would somehow motivate us or provide us with reasons for action independent of our desires and aversions&quot;—but such properties and facts do not comport with philosophical naturalism.
* given that objective moral properties supposedly supervene upon natural properties (such as biological or psychological properties), the relation between the moral properties and the natural properties is metaphysically mysterious and does not comport with philosophical naturalism.
* a moral realist who countenances the existence of metaphysically queer properties, facts, and relations must also posit some special faculty by which we have knowledge of them.

==== Responses and criticisms ====
Christine Korsgaard responds to Mackie by saying:

Other criticisms of the argument include noting that the very fact that such entities would have to be something fundamentally different from what we normally experience, therefore assumably outside our sphere of experience, we cannot &quot;prima facie&quot; have reason to either doubt or affirm their existence. Therefore if one had independent grounds for supposing such things to exist (such as a &quot;reductio ad absurdum&quot; of the contrary) the argument from queerness cannot give one any particular reason to think otherwise. An argument along these lines has been provided by, e.g., Akeel Bilgrami.

Also, quantum phenomena have been shown to share several of the unusual characteristics of ethical entities. The observer effect, quantum entanglement, the wave-particle duality of light, and other phenomena have been shown to mirror aspects of ethics, providing a response to both the epistemological and meta-ethical puzzles raised by Mackie.

=== Argument from explanatory impotence ===
Gilbert Harman argued that we do not need to posit the existence of objective values in order to explain our &#x27;moral observations&#x27;.

<doc id="1019101" wikidata="Q2924139" url="?curid=1019101" title="Bravo (British TV channel)">
<text>Bravo was a British and Irish television channel owned by Living TV Group, a subsidiary of BSkyB. Its target audience was males in their 20s to early 40s. It broadcast a variety of both archive programming (such as &quot;Knight Rider&quot; and &quot;MacGyver&quot;) and original productions.

The Bravo channel closed down on 1 January 2011, with the most popular programmes moved to other Sky channels.

== History ==

=== Early history ===
Bravo was launched on 20 December 1985 as a cable-only channel, created by United Artists Programming broadcasting black &amp; white B-movies from the 1950s and 1960s and vintage TV series. Initially, the channel was a cassette-delivered service provided to cable headends for automatic play-out.

In 1991, United Artists merged with their largest shareholder TCI ( Liberty Media), to form the largest cable operator in the United States. TCI and US West announced a joint venture and, in 1992, the joint venture company became Telewest Communications. In 1993, talks were held with Tele-Communications Inc. which resulted in Flextech acquiring TCI&#x27;s European programming business in exchange for shares. By January, the deal was complete with TCI, allowing it to acquire 60.4% of Flextech while Flextech acquired 100% of Bravo, 25% of UK Gold, 31% of UK Living, and 25% of the Children&#x27;s Channel which increased its share in that channel.

On 22 July 1993, Bravo launched on the Astra 1C satellite in anticipation of the launch of Sky Multichannels in September 1993. With the launch on Astra, the channel started broadcasting between noon and midnight (as opposed to 3 pm to 3 am).

Its programming output was altered around the same time, when the channel obtained many of the ITC Entertainment productions and other cult TV series including &quot;The Avengers&quot;. In 1990, it upgraded its onscreen image with an elaborate station identifier of a modernist skyscraper under rolling thunderclouds and promoted itself as &#x27;Timewarp Television&#x27;. It used both Roger Moore and Tony Curtis to feature in speciality shot trails. Armstrong and Miller made their first broadcast television appearance on Bravo in a series of presentation promotions during its Cult Weekend on 5 August 1995.

=== Reinvention as young-adult channel (1996–2000s) ===
In 1996, a policy change to withdraw the black &amp; white shows contributed to the channel moving on to specialise in science fiction and horror with movies from the Troma Entertainment catalogue. It then became known for showing crime documentaries by day and adult programming at night.

On 3 February 1997, Flextech launched Trouble, which took over the channel&#x27;s afternoon and early evening broadcast hours, meaning Bravo would broadcast between 8 pm to 6 am. During mornings, European Business News time shared with the channel on weekdays and Living on weekends until 2001. With the change in hours, Bravo was given a refreshed look, being branded as &quot;an altered species of television&quot;, applying to the increased number of adult-focused programmes. The channel began to air Extreme Championship Wrestling&#x27;s show &quot;ECW Hardcore TV&quot; around this time; as well as ECW&#x27;s biggest events, including what were pay-per-views in the US, up to January 2001.

=== Addition of sports and acquired programming ===
Over the later years, Bravo decreased the adult content shown and increased sports and imported shows such as &quot;Alias&quot;. Bravo aired World Championship Wrestling&#x27;s flagship show &quot;Nitro&quot; during WCW&#x27;s final year in business (2000–2001).

On 28 August 2005, the channel started showing Serie A Italian football, bringing back the Channel 4 format &quot;Football Italia&quot;.

On 2 March 2006, a sister channel called Player was launched, which originally aired as a late-night block on fellow-Flextech channel Challenge. Player aired programming aimed at a similar audience to Bravo, alongside the addition of gambling-related shows.

On 28 September 2006, Bravo introduced a brand new graphics package to memorate its 21st birthday, which coincided with the full rebranding of Player as Bravo 2.

Poor viewing figures resulted first in the cancellation of the weekly &quot;Gazetta Football Italia&quot; show, then the announcement that Bravo would stop showing Italian Football altogether after 23 December 2006. The channel&#x27;s other highest-profile sports coverage was Ultimate Fighting Championship archives, for which it held exclusive UK rights, as well as recent events (live rights are now held by BT Sport), as well as the related reality TV show &quot;The Ultimate Fighter&quot;.

From January 2007, Bravo&#x27;s sister channel Bravo 2, which had launched three months earlier, had the exclusive UK rights to broadcast Total Nonstop Action Wrestling programming, a two-day delay from the American broadcast of TNA&#x27;s weekly show &quot;TNA iMPACT!&quot; and a three-day delay for TNA&#x27;s monthly Pay Per Views. (On 3 February 2011, this programming moved to Challenge, and is now known as &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;.) On 5 January 2008, &quot;TNA iMPACT&quot; was moved to Bravo with replays of the show on Bravo 2. Bravo&#x27;s original contract for TNA Wrestling programming was for eighteen months and was distributed by RDA TV; the deal, which was once again negotiated by RDA TV, was extended on 1 July 2008 for an additional eighteen months.

From 3 June 2008, Bravo, along with the other VMT-owned channels began broadcasting in widescreen (16:9). This was coupled with a redesign of the on-screen graphic; the word &quot;BRAVO&quot; was shown rather than the logo.

=== &quot;Home of the Brave&quot; and closure (2010/2011) ===

On 25 May 2010, Virgin Media Television unveiled new channel branding for Bravo to coincide with a major new series &quot;Spartacus: Blood and Sand&quot;. It involved a new logo to &quot;match the premium content and ambition of the channel&quot; along with a new strapline, &quot;Bravo: Home of the Brave&quot;.

On 15 September 2010, BSkyB announced that it would close Bravo as well as its sister channel &quot;Bravo 2&quot;.

For November 2010, Bravo rebranded as Brav-Mo to celebrate Movember.

From 24 to 31 December 2010, Bravo celebrated its final week with a marathon of its most popular shows called &quot;Bravo, We Salute You&quot;.

On the morning of 1 January 2011, Bravo ceased broadcasting on all platforms. The last programme aired was &quot;World&#x27;s Most Amazing Videos&quot;. Following the closure, the Bravo programmes (as well as the Channel One programmes) were moved to Pick TV in May 2012.

As of August 2013, BSkyB had registered the trademark for &#x27;Sky Bravo&#x27;.

<text>d20 Future is an accessory for the &quot;d20 Modern&quot; role-playing game written by Christopher Perkins, Rodney Thompson, and JD Wiker. It facilitates the playing of campaigns in the far future, using elements such as cybernetics, mecha, mutations, robotics, space travel, starships, and xenobiology. &quot;d20 Future&quot; is one of the most extensive of science-fiction d20 games and has its own SRD, which is a source for many other sci-fi d20 games.

==New rules==
&quot;d20 Future&quot; introduced a number of new elements to &quot;d20 Modern&quot;, including:
* New classes, occupations, feats, and skill applications
* New equipment, include cybernetics and mecha
* Rules for robot player characters
* Rules for mutations
* Rules for scientific engineering, spaceships, and constructs
* Hazards and environments, including vacuum and radiation
* Progress levels, describing global levels of technological development

== Campaigns ==
The book presented a number of campaign models, which provided a framework for building a full campaign setting but did not include a full-scale setting. Campaign models introduced include:

* &quot;Bughunters&quot;, an adventure game and bug hunt setting inspired by &quot;Aliens&quot;, &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;, and its predecessor in &quot;Amazing Engine&quot;.
* &quot;Dimension X&quot;, an adventure game setting based on the concept of parallel universes, which are referred to as dimensions.
* &quot;From the Dark Heart of Space&quot;, a Fifth Element style setting inspired by the eternal struggle between good and evil, with a touch of the Cthulhu Mythos.
* &quot;Genetech&quot;, apparently an uncredited adaptation of the background of the Moreau series of books by S. Andrew Swann. It originally appeared as a mini-game in &quot;Polyhedron&quot; #155.
* &quot;Mecha Crusade&quot;, an anime-inspired (primarily &quot;Gundam&quot;-inspired) setting taking place in the 2050s that focuses on the war between Earth and the Colonists, with giant fighting robots (mecha) being used on both sides. It originally appeared as a mini-game in &quot;Polyhedron&quot; #154. Mecha Crusade uses a different system than the Guardians of Order-published &quot;d20 Mecha&quot;.
* &quot;Star*Drive&quot;, a political space opera taking placed in the 26th century. It is a remake of &quot;Alternity&quot; campaign setting of the same name.
* &quot;Star Law&quot;, a remake of the popular 1980s &quot;Star Frontiers&quot; space opera-based role-playing game. The mini-setting is cited to use material from &quot;Star Frontiers Alpha Dawn&quot; and &quot;Zebulon&#x27;s Guide to Frontier Space&quot;.
* &quot;The Wasteland&quot;, a somewhat western-flavored post-apocalyptic fiction setting inspired by its predecessors in &quot;Metamorphosis Alpha&quot; and &quot;Gamma World&quot;.

==Expansions==

===&quot;d20 Cyberscape&quot;===

d20 Cyberscape is an expansion for the &quot;d20 Future&quot; supplement of &quot;d20 Modern&quot;. It adds more Cybernetics to accompany those found in &quot;d20 Future&quot;, as well as alternate forms of cybernetics, such as cybernetics in fantasy. It also includes a cyberpunk campaign model called &quot;CyberRave&quot;, in which the world has become a collection of corporation-owned and run countries.
===&quot;d20 Future Tech&quot;===
d20 Future Tech is a 96-page supplement for the &quot;d20 Modern&quot; role-playing game and the &quot;d20 Future&quot; supplement. This supplement contains rules which expand on various weaponry and gadgets from &quot;d20 Future&quot;.

The book contains additional material expands of the following topics already established in &quot;d20 Future&quot;: Weapons/Personal Gear, Starships, Mecha, and Robotics. There is a chapter on how future technology affects life, and one on integrating different types of combat (Mecha vs Vehicle, Starship vs. Mecha, etc.).

<text>Ambert (; Auvergnat: &quot;Embèrt&quot;) is a commune in the Puy-de-Dôme department in Auvergne in central France.

==Administration==
Ambert is the seat of the canton of Ambert and the arrondissement of Ambert. It is a sub-prefecture of the department. The &quot;arrondissement&quot; consists of eight cantons (before March 2015).

==Geography==
Ambert lies on the river Dore, a tributary of the Allier.

==Population==
==Sights==
Ambert is famous for its fourme d&#x27;Ambert cheese - &quot;Fourme d&#x27;Ambert&quot;, its paper mills - &quot;Le moulin Richard de Bas&quot; - (the first edition of Diderot&#x27;s &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; was printed on paper made in Ambert) and its circular town market hall - &quot;La Mairie&quot; - (popularized by Jules Romains in his novel &quot;Les copains&quot;).

The Agrivap Chemin de Fer Touristique operates out of Ambert. There is a steam engine that makes a local run, but to see the line in full a ride on the Panoramique Autorail is not to be missed.

There is an industrial museum with an interesting collection of tractors and small steam engines.

In the town the Museum of Cheese is worth a visit, as is the old paper mill a few kilometres outside the main town.

==Personalities==
Ambert was the birthplace of the mathematician Michel Rolle (1652–1719), composer Emmanuel Chabrier (1841–1894), and anthropologist Henri Pourrat (1887–1959), who collected the oral traditions of the Auvergne. It is also the birthplace of actor and director Pierre-Loup Rajot (1958–).

==International relations==
Ambert is twinned with:
* Annweiler, Germany, since 1988
* Higashichichibu, Saitama, Japan, since 1989
* Gorgonzola, Italy, since 2002. Both cities, known for their blue cow&#x27;s-milk cheeses (cheese and Fourme d&#x27;Ambert), have almost the same latitude: 45° 32&#x27; N for Gorgonzola, 45° 33&#x27; N for Ambert.

== Touristic places near Ambert ==
Some semi-famous places to go when visiting Ambert, France are:
* La Mairie (a round town hall, fun when the farmer&#x27;s market is there)
* Le Moulin Richard-de-Bas (a paper mill, with a great tour for all ages, workshops, activities and a nice little garden)

<doc id="1019114" wikidata="Q127605350" url="?curid=1019114" title="Canal pound">
<text>A canal pound (from impound), reach, or level (American usage), is the stretch of level water impounded between two canal locks. Canal pounds can vary in length from the non-existent, where two or more immediately adjacent locks form a lock staircase, to many kilometres/miles.

The longest canal pound in the United Kingdom is between the stop lock on the Trent and Mersey Canal at Preston Brook (Dutton Stop Lock No 76) and the start of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal near Leigh (Poolstock Bottom Lock No 2), a distance of . Another long pound is on the Kennet and Avon Canal between Wootton Rivers Bottom Lock and Caen Hill top lock. The longest level on the Erie Canal in New York was the 60 mile level (actually ) between Henrietta and Lockport.

==History==
Pounds came into being with the development of pound locks to replace the earlier flash locks. A key feature of pound locks was that the intervening level between locks remained largely constant, as opposed to the variable levels created by the opening of flash locks.

On some American canals, some pounds acquired nicknames due to the mileage between locks, e.g. the &quot;Eight Mile Level&quot; on the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal was between Riley&#x27;s Lock (Lock 24) and Edward&#x27;s Ferry (Lock 25), a distance of about .

===Engineering considerations===
Making a channel that would not leak water is not easily done. Gravel soil or light soil will leak for a few years until it settles and hardens. Puddle or clay would be used to line the channel, but that was not foolproof. The Union Canal and the Schuylkill canal where the canal prism (the shape of the canal as seen in cross section) was blasted through limestone leaked so badly, they had to line the channel with timber. The Chesapeake and Ohio canal had frequent cave-ins due to limestone sinkholes near Shepherdstown, near Two Locks above Dam No. 4, around Four Locks, Big pool, and Roundtop Hill near Dam No. 6. requiring expensive repairs. After some years, the canal bed would settle and harden, and puddling would no longer be needed.

====Water supply====

One main concern to the engineer was the canal&#x27;s water supply. Pumping would contribute greatly to operating expense, especially at the summit level, hence gravity fed water is preferred. Feeder canals could be to in length, if needed. The canal bed would have to slope so that the water would not flow too fast down the canal and impede the progress of upstream boats.

Rivers were often dammed to raise the water&#x27;s height so that the canal could be fed, for instance, the Chesapeake and Ohio canal had seven dams built to feed water.

If a dam was not built, often water had to be pumped. The Chesapeake and Ohio put a steam pump near the South Branch, near mile 174, which had a capacity of about , since the water from Dam No. 8 was insufficient. This problem is particularly acute on summit pounds (see below).

On the Delaware Division canal, the Delaware River was made to pump its own water into the canal, using an undershot water wheel which was connected to another wheel which had buckets attached, thereby lifting the river water up to the canal.

===Winter===

Where ice would form during winter, the canal prism would usually be closed and drained. During this time, sand bars would be dug out, locks and other structures would be fixed. Exceptions to this would include wartime necessities, i.e. the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal was left open in the winters of 1861–1862 because of the American Civil War.

===Level walkers and repairs===
American canals often had a man called a &quot;level walker&quot; (Chesapeake and Ohio Canal), &quot;bank watchman&quot; (Erie Canal), towpath walker or inspector whose job was to walk along the pound (level) with a shovel, checking for leaks and repairing minor ones before the leak could cause major damage, and calling the section work crew for major ones. His rounds were about 20 to 24 miles daily. Muskrats would cause leaks by burrowing in the canal, as well as competitors such as stage coach lines or teamsters who would sabotage the canal by digging holes in the bank. Other duties included checking the waste weir gates to see if they were letting out the correct amount of water, checking aqueducts for damage, as well as being called in the night to search for missing persons supposedly drowned in the canal.

If a break or leak was discovered and the level walker could not do repair it himself, he sent a message to the section superintendent or headquarters, and the section crew with a repair scow would come. These boats carried clay straw, takes, rope, wooden boards, and tools (picks &amp; shovels). For culverts and flood gates, a row of heavy planks, interlocked with tongue and groove, would be driven across the canal (similar to a cofferdam) above and below the break, and would swell when wet. After the water drained out through the break, it would be repaired. If the break was in the bank or berm of the canal, the crew would drive two rows of stakes, about a foot apart, across the breach, then weaving rope between them. Straw was put in it, and that would slow or stop the water flow. A row of planks were then driven to stop the flow, and then the break would be filled with dirt and rocks.

Burrowing animals, such as muskrats, would cause leaks by digging holes. Indiana canals had leaks from burrowing crawfish. Canal companies would often post bounties for muskrats, e.g. the Middlesex Canal.

==Types of pound==
Pounds can be described in various ways according to their situation;

===Summit pound===

A summit pound is formed at a summit on the canal, and where all the defining locks descend from the pound. Summit pounds are particularly important in canal design, as every boat entering or leaving the pound causes a loss of water. Summit pounds therefore need an independent form of water supply, which may take the form of weirs on adjacent rivers, reservoirs or pumping stations. Common practice during canal design was to make summit pounds as large as practically possible, in order that losing a lockful of water would not lower the water level too significantly.

The Rochdale Canal is a good example of a canal with a relatively short summit pound, which requires restrictions on lock workings at certain times. The canal, which is one of three which cross the Pennines, is long, but the summit pound is just . To the north and east, 36 locks descend to Sowerby Bridge, while to the south and west, another 56 locks descend to Castlefield Junction, on the edge of Manchester. The summit pound is above sea level, and is one of the highest summit pounds in Britain. In order to keep it in water, the company built a total of eight reservoirs near the summit pound. Hollingworth Reservoir was at a lower level than the summit, and so a steam engine was installed to pump the water up to a feeder, which delivered it to the summit pound. One reason for the present restriction on boat movements over the summit is that the water rights and associated works were sold to various local authorities in 1923 under the terms of the Oldham and Rochdale Corporations Water Act, as the subsequent increase in leisure traffic was not anticipated. The first canal to be constructed with a summit pound in the United Kingdom was the Newry Canal, completed in 1741, which linked Newry to Lough Neagh. The summit pound was long, between Poyntz Pass and Terryhoogan, but its water supply was a cause of problems over many years.

Pennsylvania&#x27;s Union Canal suffered likewise on its summit level for lack of water. To rectify that, engineers had to put three large dams across Swartara creek, a mile long dam over Cattail Creek, and the water then passed to a powerhouse where the water was pumped (using water wheels and additional steam pumps if needed) 95 feet up, whereupon it flowed 4 miles through an aqueduct.

The Morris Canal in New Jersey used Lake Hopatcong to feed its summit pound through a feeder canal. The lake was large enough, that traffic could enter the lake from the canal. Lock 1E was east of the summit pound, and Lock 1W was west of the summit pound. The Panama Canal also uses a lake (Lake Gatun) as its summit pound.

===Sump pound===
The inverse of a summit pound is a sump pound. In contrast to a summit pound, a sump pound is a point where every boat entering or leaving the pound causes an addition of water. The longest one is the Fenny Stratford pound on the Grand Union Canal, between Cosgrove Lock, which starts the ascent to the Braunston summit to the north, and Fenny Stratford lock, which starts the ascent to the Bulborne summit to the south. Every sump pound needs somewhere to discharge the surplus water, and in this case, a large viaduct and aqueduct immediately to the south of Cosgrove Lock carries the canal over the River Great Ouse, which serves that function.

===Lock pound===
A lock pound lies between two locks which are only a short distance apart. Water levels in the pound are liable to fluctuate as the locks are used. Boats entering the pound from the lower level remove a lockful of water from the pound, while those using the upper lock add a lockful of water. Because the maximum level in the pound is normally controlled by a bywash weir at the lower lock, some of the water from the upper lock may be lost over it, and if the lower lock has a deeper fall, there is a net loss of level when a boat passes through the pound.

===Side pound===

A side pound is a particular type of extremely short lock pound, which is extended sideways to make up for the short distance between locks so as to avoid excessive level fluctuations. An example of this is the Caen Hill locks on the Kennet and Avon Canal. Climbing the hill that leads to Devizes requires 29 locks. The first seven and the last six have conventional pounds, but the middle sixteen have large side pounds, enabling all 16 to be fitted into a distance of around .

Serving a similar function are the side ponds on lock flights such as the Foxton flight. The ten locks are organised as two staircases of five chambers each, where each lock can discharge water into the pond below it and receive water from the one above it. Although connected to the locks by sluices, they are still often called side pounds, as they are maintained at the level at which an intermediate pound would be if one were present. The term side pond is also used to refer to a water saving basin, which is maintained at a level between the upper and lower level of a single lock. Most of the locks on the Grand Union Canal between Whilton Locks and lock 45 at Bulbourne, the junction with the Wendover Arm, were built with two such side ponds, although they are currently disused.

==Regulating water level==
Canals have several devices used to keep the water level from rising too high in the pounds, causing floods, washouts, and other damage.

===Waste weirs===

Waste weirs are used to regulate the height of the water in the canal. Any water higher than the highest board in the waste weir would flow over the board, and out of the canal pound. Boards could be added or taken out to adjust the height of water. Waste weirs often had paddle valves at the bottom, allowing the canal to be completely drained for repairs, emergencies, or at the end of the boating season for winter. On some canals (e.g. the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal) with the exception of short levels, almost every level had a waste weir between the locks.

At locks, there was often a bypass weir which fed water to the flume, allowing water to bypass the lock into the lower pound. This could be adjusted, similar to the waste weir by adding or removing boards to control the water level.

===Spillways and informal overflows (mule drinks)===

Spillways were also used, allowing the water to spill over and into the surrounding rivers. These may be positioned over the towpath or on the berm side of the canal.

An &quot;informal overflow&quot; on American canals is a dip in the towpath which functions as a spillway, but usually lacking concrete or formal structure. The boatmen sometimes called these &quot;mule drinks&quot;, since the mules would drink from the water flowing over the towpath. Informal overflows were often replaced by a waste weir or lined with concrete or masonry to make a more &quot;permanent&quot; spillway.

===Stop gates===
If the pound was many miles long, sometimes the canal would be designed with stop gates, so that if there was a break in the canal the whole pound would not lose all its water. Isolating the break would allow the company to make repairs sooner. For instance, on the 14 mile level of the Chesapeake and Ohio canal, there were stop gates put before and after Big Pool so that it (the Big Pool lake) would not have to be drained in case of breaks or repairs.

==Animal escape==

On the Erie Canal, in the three mile long rock cut above Lockport, if a mule or horse fell into the canal pound, there were some escape &quot;holes&quot; cut in the towpath, a depression covered over by wooden boards, so that the animal could go into the &quot;hole&quot; and then be rescued. This was as a result of the bank being practically vertical, making it impossible to retrieve one that fell into the canal.

Ramps at the side of canals next to the towpath are quite common in England particularly where horses were known to fall in. For example there is one on the Hanwell Lock Flight of locks on the Grand Union Canal.

==Sand bars and obstructions==

Canal levels sometimes have sand bars or shallow areas where the boat will get stuck. It is common on English canals for boaters to carry a barge pole to help punt the boat off an obstruction.

Some boats carried long iron-tipped poles to push themselves off, although some canals forbade their use. Sometimes boatmen would ask the lockkeeper of the lock above for a swell, to raise the water in the level, so that they could get off the sand bar.

<doc id="1019118" wikidata="Q1462809" url="?curid=1019118" title="Crown group">
<text>In phylogenetics, the crown group or crown assemblage is a collection of species composed of the living representatives of the collection, the most recent common ancestor of the collection, and all descendants of the most recent common ancestor. It is thus a way of defining a clade, a group consisting of a species and all its extant or extinct descendants. For example, Neornithes (birds) can be defined as a crown group, which includes the most recent common ancestor of all modern birds, and all of its extant or extinct descendants.

The concept was developed by Willi Hennig, the formulator of phylogenetic systematics, as a way of classifying living organisms relative to their extinct relatives in his &quot;Die Stammesgeschichte der Insekten&quot;,
and the &quot;crown&quot; and &quot;stem&quot; group terminology was coined by R. P. S. Jefferies in 1979. Though formulated in the 1970s, the term was not commonly used until its reintroduction in 2000 by Graham Budd and Sören Jensen.

==Contents of the crown group==
It is not necessary for a species to have living descendants in order for it to be included in the crown group. Extinct side branches on the family tree that are descended from the most recent common ancestor of living members will still be part of a crown group. For example, if we consider the crown-birds (i.e. all extant birds and the rest of the family tree back to their most recent common ancestor), extinct side branches like the dodo or great auk are still descended from the most recent common ancestor of all living birds, so fall within the bird crown group. One very simplified cladogram for birds is shown below:

In this diagram, the clade labelled &quot;Neornithes&quot; is the crown group of birds: it includes the most recent common ancestor of all living birds and its descendants, living or not. Although considered to be birds (i.e. members of the clade Aves), &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot; and other extinct groups are not included in the crown group, as they fall outside the Neornithes clade, being descended from an earlier ancestor.

An alternative definition does not require any members of a crown group to be extant, only to have resulted from a &quot;major cladogenesis event&quot;. The first definition forms the basis of this article.

Often, the crown group is given the designation &quot;crown-&quot;, to separate it from the group as commonly defined. Both birds and mammals are traditionally defined by their traits, and contain fossil members that lived before the last common ancestors of the living groups or, like the mammal &quot;Haldanodon&quot;, were not descended from that ancestor although they lived later. Crown-Aves and Crown-Mammalia therefore differ slightly in content from the common definition of Aves and Mammalia. This has caused some confusion in the literature.

==Other groups under the crown group concept==
The cladistic idea of strictly using the topology of the phylogenetic tree to define groups necessitates other definitions than crown groups to adequately define commonly discussed fossil groups. Thus, a host of prefixes have been defined to describe various branches of the phylogenetic tree relative to extant organisms.

===Pan-group===
A pan-group or total group is the crown group and all organisms more closely related to it than to any other extant organisms. In a tree analogy, it is the crown group and all branches back to (but not including) the split with the closest branch to have living members. The Pan-Aves thus contain the living birds and all (fossil) organisms more closely related to birds than to crocodilians (their closest living relatives). The phylogenetic lineage leading back from Neornithes to the point where it merges with the crocodilian lineage, along with all side branches, constitutes pan-birds. In addition to non-crown group primitive birds like &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot;, &quot;Hesperornis&quot; and &quot;Confuciusornis&quot;, therefore, pan-group birds would include all dinosaurs and pterosaurs as well as an assortment of non-crocodilian animals like &quot;Marasuchus&quot;.

Pan-Mammalia consists of all mammals and their fossil ancestors back to the phylogenetic split from the remaining amniotes (the Sauropsida). Pan-Mammalia is thus an alternative name for Synapsida.

===Stem groups===

A stem group is a paraphyletic assemblage composed of the members of a pan-group or total group, above, &quot;minus&quot; the crown group itself (and therefore minus all living members of the pan-group). This leaves primitive relatives of the crown groups, back along the phylogenetic line to (but not including) the last common ancestor of the crown group and their closest living relatives. It follows from the definition that all members of a stem group are extinct. The &quot;stem group&quot; is the most used and most important of the concepts linked to crown groups, as it offers a means to reify and name paraphyletic assemblages of fossils that otherwise do not fit into systematics based on living organisms.

While often attributed to Jefferies (1979), Willmann (2003) traced the origin of the stem group concept to Austrian systematist Othenio Abel (1914), and it was discussed and diagrammed in English as early as 1933 by A. S. Romer.

Alternatively, the term &quot;stem group&quot; is sometimes used in a wider sense to cover any members of the traditional taxon falling outside the crown group. Permian synapsids like &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; or &quot;Anteosaurus&quot; are stem mammals in the wider sense but not in the narrower one.

Often, an (extinct) grouping is identified as belonging together. Later, it may be realized other (extant) groupings actually emerged within such grouping, rendering them a stem grouping. Cladistically, the new groups should then be added to the group, as paraphyletic groupings are not natural. In any case, stem groupings with living descendants should not be viewed as a cohesive group, but their tree should be further resolved to reveal the full bifurcating phylogeny.

====Examples of stem groups (in the wider sense)====
Stem birds perhaps constitute the most cited example of a stem group, as the phylogeny of this group is fairly well known. The following cladogram, based on Benton (2005), illustrates the concept:

The crown group here is Neornithes, all modern bird lineages back to their last common ancestor. The closest living relatives of birds are crocodilians. If we follow the phylogenetic lineage leading to Neornithes to the left, the line itself and all side branches belong to the stem birds until the lineage merges with that of the crocodilians. In addition to non-crown group primitive birds like &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot;, &quot;Hesperornis&quot; and &quot;Confuciusornis&quot;, stem group birds include the dinosaurs and the pterosaurs. The last common ancestor of birds and crocodilians—the first crown group archosaur—was neither bird nor crocodilian and possessed none of the features unique to either. As the bird stem group evolved, distinctive bird features such as feathers and hollow bones appeared. Finally, at the base of the crown group, all traits common to extant birds were present.

Under the widely used total-group perspective, the Crocodylomorpha would become synonymous with the Crocodilia, and the Avemetatarsalia would become synonymous with the birds, and the above tree could be summarized as

An advantage of this approach is that declaring Theropoda to be birds (or Pan-aves) is more specific than declaring it to be a member of the Archosauria, which would not exclude it from the Crocodilia branch. Basal branch names such as Avemetatarsalia are usually more obscure. However, not so advantageous are the facts that &quot;Pan-Aves&quot; and &quot;Aves&quot; are not the same group, the circumscription of the concept of &quot;Pan-Aves&quot; (synonymous with Avemetatarsalia) is only evident by examination of the above tree, and calling both groups &quot;birds&quot; is ambiguous.

Stem mammals are those in the lineage leading to living mammals, together with side branches, from the divergence of the lineage from the Sauropsida to the last common ancestor of the living mammals. This group includes the synapsids as well as mammaliaforms like the morganucodonts and the docodonts; the latter groups have traditionally and anatomically been considered mammals even though they fall outside the crown group mammals.

Stem tetrapods are the animals belonging to the lineage leading to tetrapods from their divergence from the lungfish, our nearest relatives among the fishes. In addition to a series of lobe-finned fishes, they also include some of the early labyrinthodonts. Exactly what labyrinthodonts are in the stem group tetrapods rather than the corresponding crown group is uncertain, as the phylogeny of early tetrapods is not well understood. This example shows that crown and stem group definitions are of limited value when there is no consensus phylogeny.

Stem arthropods constitute a group that has seen attention in connection with the Burgess Shale fauna. Several of the finds, including the enigmatic &quot;Opabinia&quot; and &quot;Anomalocaris&quot; have some, though not all, features associated with arthropods, and are thus considered stem arthropods. The sorting of the Burgess Shale fauna into various stem groups finally enabled phylogenetic sorting of this enigmatic assemblage and also allowed for identifying velvet worms as the closest living relatives of arthropods.

Stem priapulids are other early Cambrian to middle Cambrian faunas, appearing in Chengjiang to Burgess Shale. The genus &quot;Ottoia&quot; has more or less the same build as modern priapulids, but phylogenetic analysis indicates that it falls outside the crown group, making it a stem priapulid.

===Plesion-group===
The name &quot;plesion&quot; has a long history in biological systematics, and plesion group has acquired several meanings over the years. One use is as &quot;nearby group&quot; (plesion means &quot;close to&quot; in Greek), i.e. sister group to a given taxon, whether that group is a crown group or not. The term may also mean a group, possibly paraphyletic, defined by primitive traits (i.e. symplesiomorphies). It is generally taken to mean a side branch splitting off earlier on the phylogenetic tree than the group in question.

==Palaeontological significance of stem and crown groups==
Placing fossils in their right order in a stem group allows the order of these acquisitions to be established, and thus the ecological and functional setting of the evolution of the major features of the group in question. Stem groups thus offer a route to integrate unique palaeontological data into questions of the evolution of living organisms. Furthermore, they show that fossils that were considered to lie in their own separate group because they did not show all the diagnostic features of a living clade, can nevertheless be related to it by lying in its stem group. Such fossils have been of particular importance in considering the origins of the tetrapods, mammals, and animals.

The application of the stem group concept also influenced the interpretation of the organisms of the Burgess shale. Their classification in stem groups to extant phyla, rather than in phyla of their own, is thought by some to make the Cambrian explosion easier to understand without invoking unusual evolutionary mechanisms; however, application of the stem group concept does nothing to ameliorate the difficulties that phylogenetic telescoping poses to evolutionary theorists attempting to understand both macroevolutionary change and the abrupt character of the Cambrian explosion. Overemphasis on the stem group concept threatens to delay or obscure proper recognition of new higher taxa.

==Stem groups in systematics==
As originally proposed by Karl-Ernst Lauterbach, stem groups should be given the prefix &quot;stem&quot; (i.e. Stem-Aves, Stem-Arthropoda), however the crown group should have no prefix. The latter has not been universally accepted for known groups. A number of paleontologists have opted to apply this approach anyway.

<doc id="1019119" wikidata="Q3234461" url="?curid=1019119" title="Klang Valley">
<text>Klang Valley () is an urban agglomeration in Malaysia that is centered in the federal territories of Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya, and including their adjoining cities and towns in the state of Selangor. It is the urban area of the much larger Kuala Lumpur metropolitan area, known as Greater Kuala Lumpur.

The Klang Valley is geographically delineated by the Titiwangsa Mountains to the east and the Strait of Malacca to the west. It extends to Rawang in the northwest, Semenyih in the southeast, and Klang and Port Klang in the southwest. The conurbation is the heartland of Malaysia&#x27;s industry and commerce. As of 2022, the Klang Valley is home to roughly 9 million people.

==Origin==
The valley is named after the Klang River, the principal river that flows through it that starts at Klang Gates Quartz Ridge in Gombak and flows into the Straits of Malacca in Port Klang, The river is closely linked to the early development of the area as a cluster of tin mining towns in the late 19th century. Development of the region took place largely in the East-West direction (between Gombak and Port Klang) but the urban areas surrounding Kuala Lumpur have since grown north and south towards the border with Perak and Negeri Sembilan respectively.

==Regions==
There is no official designation of the boundaries that make up the Klang Valley but it is often assumed to comprise the following areas and their corresponding local authorities:

*Federal Territory of Putrajaya
** Putrajaya Corporation
*Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur
**Kuala Lumpur City Hall
* Selangor district of Petaling
**Shah Alam City Council
**Petaling Jaya City Council
**Subang Jaya City Council
*Selangor district of Klang
**Klang Royal City Council
*Selangor district of Gombak
**Selayang Municipal Council
*Selangor district of Hulu Langat
**Ampang Jaya Municipal Council
**Kajang Municipal Council
*Selangor district of Sepang
**Sepang Municipal Council
*Selangor district of Kuala Langat
**Kuala Langat Municipal Council

==Transport==
Even though the Klang Valley officially consists of separate cities and suburbs, integration between these cities is very high, with a highly developed road network and an expanding integrated rail transit system. Many expressways criss-cross the metropolis making cars the most convenient way to get around. However, this has led to the Klang Valley&#x27;s notorious traffic jams which span whole kilometres of expressways and make driving during peak hours exhausting. Since the 1990s, new rail systems, such as Rapid KL&#x27;s light rapid transit (LRT), mass rapid transit (MRT), KTM Komuter, ERL&#x27;s airport rail links and a monorail have been developed. Most of these systems have gone through extensive expansion as a superproject. The Klang Valley Integrated Transit System, as of now, is currently being upgraded to include a new MRT line and LRT line, as well as a monorail serving Putrajaya. Buses that operate around Klang Valley are also extensive.

In 2024, National Defence University of Malaysia associate professor Wu Chai Bin believed that the traffic jams in Klang Valley would be relieved in 10 years by improving the public transportation network.

<text>The RD350 is a two-stroke motorcycle produced by Yamaha from 1973 to 1975. It evolved directly from the piston port (pre-reed valve intake tract), front drum-braked, five-speed Yamaha 350 cc &quot;R5&quot;.

The engine is an air-cooled, parallel twin, six-speed (in some markets, such as the UK, the first model was sold in five-speed form), reed valve-equipped intake tract two-stroke engine. The bike is usually referred to as a sport bike.

All models were equipped with &quot;Autolube&quot; automatic oil injection, relieving the user from the need to mix gasoline and two-stroke oil.

Rim sizes are 18&quot; WM2 (1.85&quot;) front and 18&quot; WM3 (2.15&quot;) rear, both being of chromed, wire spoked steel construction. In the UK, rim sizes were 1.60 front and 1.85 rear.

Brakes are: single front disc brake and a rear drum brake, a combination described by &quot;Cycle Magazine&quot; as the best in its class.

The frame dimensions of the street &quot;350&quot; are very similar to the Yamaha TZ 250 and TZ 350 series factory road race bikes, differing mainly in weight and front fork rake – the RD being ~27 degrees and the TZ being ~25 degrees. The frames appear similar, side by side, with the street frame adorned with many brackets for the street equipment. The weight difference is substantial though, with the street-going RD frame weighing almost twice as much as the &quot;TZ&quot; roadrace race frame.

The stock bike made ( at the back wheel) at 7500 rpm – very fast for the time. A contemporary of the RD is the Kawasaki H2 750cc Triple that produced 74 hp.

The 350 evolved into the more refined and cleaner running RD400C in 1976, the &quot;D&quot; and &quot;E&quot; in 77–78 and the final model, the white 1979 RD400F.

==The RD350B in India==

A licensed version of the RD350B was assembled in India between 1983 and 1990 by Escorts group under the brand name Rajdoot 350. It did not repeat the success of the RD350B in the Indian market, which some attribute to a high purchase price and poor fuel efficiency. However, it established Rajdoot/Yamaha as a performance bike manufacturer in India. There were two models for the Rajdoot 350 - High Torque and Low Torque. Compared to the Yamaha RD350B that made at the crankshaft, the &#x27;High Torque&#x27; version made and the later &#x27;Low Torque&#x27; made only , the engine being detuned in the quest for better fuel economy. By the time the production ended in 1990, the bike was nearly 100% sourced in India, with very little Japanese parts content.

Brakes are: 180mm dia drum brakes front internal expansion (twin leading type) and rear single internal expansion.

The RD350 was the first sporting motorcycle built in India, and it still enjoys cult status, with many RD clubs around the country. Around 7000 were made at the end of 1990.

<text>James Laughlin (October 30, 1914 – November 12, 1997) was an American poet and literary book publisher who founded New Directions Publishing.

== Early life ==

He was born in Pittsburgh, the son of Henry Hughart and Marjory Rea Laughlin. Laughlin&#x27;s family had made its fortune with the Jones and Laughlin Steel Company, founded three generations earlier by his great grandfather, James H. Laughlin, and this wealth would partially fund Laughlin&#x27;s future endeavors in publishing. As Laughlin once wrote, &quot;none of this would have been possible without the industry of my ancestors, the canny Irishmen who immigrated in 1824 from County Down to Pittsburgh, where they built up what became the fourth largest steel company in the country. I bless them with every breath.&quot; Laughlin&#x27;s boyhood home is now part of the campus of Chatham University.

== Education ==
At The Choate School (now Choate Rosemary Hall) in Wallingford, Connecticut, Laughlin showed an early interest in literature. An important influence on Laughlin at the time was the Choate teacher and translator Dudley Fitts, who later provided Laughlin with introductions to prominent writers such as Gertrude Stein and Ezra Pound. Harvard University, where Laughlin matriculated in 1933, had a more conservative literary bent, embodied in the poet and professor Robert Hillyer, who directed the writing program. According to Laughlin, Hillyer would leave the room when either Pound or Eliot was mentioned.

== Career ==
In 1934, Laughlin traveled to France, where he met Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas. Laughlin accompanied the two on a motoring tour of southern France and wrote press releases for Stein&#x27;s upcoming visit to the U.S. He proceeded to Italy to meet and study with Ezra Pound, who famously told him, &quot;You&#x27;re never going to be any good as a poet. Why don&#x27;t you take up something useful?&quot; Pound suggested publishing. Later, Laughlin took a leave of absence from Harvard and stayed with Pound in Rapallo for several months. When Laughlin returned to Harvard, he used money from his father to found New Directions, which he ran first from his dorm room and later from a barn on his Aunt Leila Laughlin Carlisle&#x27;s estate in Norfolk, Connecticut. (The firm opened offices in New York soon after, first at 333 Sixth Avenue and later at 80 Eighth Avenue, where it remains today.) With funds from his graduation gift, Laughlin endowed New Directions with more money, ensuring that the company could stay afloat even though it did not turn a profit until 1946.

The first publication of the new press, in 1936, was &quot;New Directions in Prose &amp; Poetry&quot;, an anthology of poetry and writings by authors such as William Carlos Williams, Ezra Pound, Elizabeth Bishop, Henry Miller, Marianne Moore, Wallace Stevens, and E. E. Cummings, a roster that heralded the fledgling company&#x27;s future as a preeminent publisher of modernist literature. The volume also included a poem by &quot;Tasilo Ribischka,&quot; a pseudonym for Laughlin himself. &quot;New Directions in Prose and Poetry&quot; became an annual publication, issuing its final number in 1991.

Within just a few years New Directions had become an important publisher of modernist literature. Initially, it emphasized contemporary American writers with whom Laughlin had personal connections, such as William Carlos Williams and Pound. A born cosmopolitan, though, Laughlin also sought out cutting-edge European and Latin American authors and introduced their work to the American market. One important example of this was Hermann Hesse&#x27;s novel &quot;Siddhartha&quot;, which New Directions initially published in 1951. Laughlin often remarked that the popularity of &quot;Siddhartha&quot; subsidized the publication of many other money-losing books of greater importance.

Although of draft age, Laughlin avoided service in World War II due to a 4-F classification. Laughlin, like several of his male ancestors and like his son Robert, suffered from depression. Robert committed suicide in 1986 by stabbing himself multiple times in the bathtub. Laughlin later wrote a poem about this, called &quot;Experience of Blood&quot;, in which he expresses his shock at the amount of blood in the human body. Despite the horrific mess left as a result, Laughlin reasons that he cannot ask anyone else to clean it up, &quot;because after all, it was my blood too.&quot;

A natural athlete and an avid skier, Laughlin traveled the world skiing and hiking. With money from his graduation gift, he founded the Alta Ski Area in Utah and was part-owner of the resort there for many years. Laughlin also spearheaded the surveying of the Albion-Sugarloaf ski area, along with Alta notables Chic Morton, Alf Engen, and fellow Ski Enthusiast and Painter Ruth Rogers-Altmann. At times Laughlin&#x27;s skiing got in the way of his business. After publishing William Carlos Williams&#x27; novel &quot;White Mule&quot; in 1937, Laughlin left for an extended ski trip. When reviewers sought additional copies of the novel, Laughlin was not available to give the book the push it could have used, and as a result Williams nursed a grudge against the young publisher for years. Laughlin&#x27;s outdoor activities helped other literary friendships, though; for many years he and Kenneth Rexroth took an annual camping trip together in the Sierra Nevada mountains of California. In the 1960s, Laughlin published Rexroth&#x27;s friend, the poet and essayist Gary Snyder, also an avid outdoorsman.

In the early 1950s, Laughlin took part in what has come to be known as the Cultural Cold War against the Soviet Union. With funding from the Ford Foundation and with the assistance of poet and editor Hayden Carruth, Laughlin founded a nonprofit called &quot;Intercultural Publications&quot; that sought to publish a quarterly journal of American arts and letters, &quot;Perspectives U.S.A.&quot;, in Europe. Sixteen issues of the journal eventually appeared. Although Laughlin wished to continue the journal, the Ford Foundation cut off funding, asserting that &quot;Perspectives&quot; had limited impact and that its money would be better spent on the more effective Congress for Cultural Freedom. Following the dissolution of Intercultural Publications, Laughlin became deeply involved in the activities of the Asia Society.

Pound&#x27;s advice to Laughlin to give up poetry didn&#x27;t stick. He published his first book of poetry, &quot;Some Natural Things&quot;, in 1945, and continued to write verse until his death. Although he never enjoyed the acclaim that the writers he published received, Laughlin&#x27;s verse (which is plainspoken and focused on everyday experience, reminiscent of Williams or even the Roman poet Catullus) was well-respected by other poets, and in the 1990s &quot;The New Yorker&quot; published six of his poems. Among his other books are &quot;In Another Country&quot;, &quot;The Country Road&quot;, and the posthumous autobiographical poem &quot;Byways&quot;.

Laughlin won the 1992 Distinguished Contribution to American Letters Award from the National Book Awards Program. The Academy of American Poets&#x27; James Laughlin award, for a poet&#x27;s second book, is named in his honor.

== Personal life ==
Laughlin married three times. He was first married to Margaret Keyser for a decade; the couple had two children. In 1955, Laughlin married Anne Clark Resor, and with her also had two children. Laughlin met Gertrude Huston in 1945 at a Halloween dance party. Huston worked as a book designer and art director for New Directions. The pair married on December 5, 1990. He corresponded with literary critic and poet M. Bernetta Quinn.

Laughlin died of complications related to a stroke in Norfolk, Connecticut, at age 83.

<doc id="1019142" wikidata="Q778609" url="?curid=1019142" title="Expenditure function">
<text>In microeconomics, the expenditure function represents the minimum amount of expenditure needed to achieve a given level of utility, given a utility function and the prices of goods.

Formally, if there is a utility function formula_1 that describes preferences over &quot;n &quot;goods, the expenditure function formula_2 is defined as:

:formula_3

where formula_4 is the price vector formula_5 is the desired utility level, formula_6 is the set of providing at least utility formula_5.

Expressed equivalently, the individual minimizes expenditure formula_8 subject to the minimal utility constraint that formula_9 giving optimal quantities to consume of the various goods as formula_10 as function of formula_5 and the prices; then the expenditure function is

:formula_12

== Properties ==
Suppose formula_1 is a continuous utility function representing a locally non-satiated preference relation on formula_14. Then formula_2 is
# Homogeneous of degree one in p: for all and formula_16, formula_17
# Continuous in formula_18 and formula_19
# Nondecreasing in formula_18 and strictly increasing in formula_21 provided formula_22
# Concave in formula_23
# If the utility function is strictly quasi-concave, there is Shephard&#x27;s lemma
=== Proofs ===

(1) As in the above proposition, note that 

formula_24 formula_25 formula_26

(2) Continue on the domain formula_27: formula_28 

(3) Let formula_29 and suppose formula_30. Then formula_31, and formula_32 . It follows immediately that formula_33. 

For the second statement, suppose to the contrary that for some formula_34, formula_35 Than, for some formula_36, formula_37, which contradicts the &quot;no excess utility&quot; conclusion of the previous proposition 

(4) Let formula_38 and suppose formula_39. Then, formula_40 and formula_41, so formula_42formula_43. 

(5) formula_44

== Expenditure and indirect utility ==
The expenditure function is the inverse of the indirect utility function when the prices are kept constant. I.e, for every price vector formula_4 and income level formula_46:
:formula_47
There is a duality relationship between the expenditure function and the utility function. If given a specific regular quasi-concave utility function, the corresponding price is homogeneous, and the utility is monotonically increasing expenditure function, conversely, the given price is homogeneous, and the utility is monotonically increasing expenditure function will generate the regular quasi-concave utility function. In addition to the property that prices are once homogeneous and utility is monotonically increasing, the expenditure function usually assumes

# Is a non-negative function, i.e., formula_48
# For P, it is non-decreasing, i.e., formula_49;
# E(Pu) is a concave function. That is, formula_50 formula_51

Expenditure function is an important theoretical method to study consumer behavior. Expenditure function is very similar to cost function in production theory. Dual to the utility maximization problem is the cost minimization problem 

==Example==

Suppose the utility function is the Cobb-Douglas function formula_52 which generates the demand functions 
:formula_53
where formula_46 is the consumer&#x27;s income. One way to find the expenditure function is to first find the indirect utility function and then invert it. The indirect utility function formula_55 is found by replacing the quantities in the utility function with the demand functions thus: 

:formula_56 

where formula_57 Then since formula_58 when the consumer optimizes, we can invert the indirect utility function to find the expenditure function: 
:formula_59 

Alternatively, the expenditure function can be found by solving the problem of minimizing formula_60 subject to the constraint formula_61 This yields conditional demand functions formula_62 and formula_63 and the expenditure function is then 
: formula_64

<text>Crofton Pumping Station, near the village of Great Bedwyn in Wiltshire, England, supplies the summit pound of the Kennet and Avon Canal with water.

The steam-powered pumping station is preserved and operates on selected weekends. It contains an operational Boulton &amp; Watt steam engine dating from 1812, making it the oldest working beam engine in the world in its original engine house and capable of doing the job for which it was installed.

== Description ==

When the canal was built, no reliable water sources were available to fill the summit by normal gravitational means. However, a set of usable springs were found adjacent to the canal route about east of the summit pound, and about below it. Arrangements were made for these springs to feed the pound below lock 60 at Crofton Locks. Some years later a reservoir (Wilton Water) was created to improve the supply to this pound, and this can now be seen across the canal from the pumping station.

Water from below lock 60 was taken by a culvert to the foot of a well sunk from the pumping station, which is built on the hillside more than above the canal. The pumps take the water from this well and discharge it into a feeder channel next to the pumping station. The water flows along this channel under the force of gravity until it reaches the summit pound about to the west.
For day-to-day operation, the pumping station now uses electric pumps, automatically controlled by the water level in the summit pound. However, the original steam driven pumping equipment has been preserved and is still operational. A single operable Lancashire boiler provides steam to the engines.

Number 1 engine, built by Boulton and Watt in 1812 and rebuilt as a Cornish engine in the 1840s, is a single-acting, condensing engine with a bore of , a stroke of and indicated power of . It drives a lift pump capable of lifting , or approximately one ton of water, per stroke, at a rate of 11 strokes a minute.

Number 2 engine, built by Harvey and Co. of Hayle in 1846 as a double-acting Sims patent combined cylinder engine and rebuilt in 1903 to a Cornish Engine, is a single-acting, condensing engine with a bore of , a stroke of and indicated power of . It drives a force pump capable of lifting , or approximately one ton of water, per stroke, at a rate of 10.2 strokes a minute.

When the Great Western Railway built its railway line through the area, it passed very close to the station and between it and the canal. Access between the canal side and the pumping station is now via a very low roofed tunnel.

== History ==

The pumping station was built between 1807 and 1809 in time for the opening of the canal in 1810. The station was built to house two pumping engines, but only one, a bore engine bought second-hand from the West India Dock Company, was initially installed.

In 1810 a second engine was ordered from Boulton and Watt. This engine, which started work in 1812, is the current number 1 engine, and has been the main engine throughout the steam-driven life of the station.

In 1846 the original 1809 engine was replaced by a new engine supplied by Harvey and Co. and built as a double-acting Sims patent combined cylinder engine. However, this engine proved troublesome and eventually fell into disuse.

In 1903 the 1846 engine was rebuilt as a simple single-acting engine and thus became the current number 2 engine. Both engines then continued in regular use until the 1950s, when the state of the chimney forced the removal of the top . The reduced height chimney was unable to provide sufficient draught for the boiler, and it proved cheaper to retire the steam engines and install electric pumps.

In 1968 the pumping station was bought by the Kennet and Avon Canal Trust with restoration in mind. The building and both engines were restored, and the existing irreparable boiler replaced with another of the same type acquired second hand. Number 1 engine was first successfully steamed on 4 April 1970 and the pumping station was officially reopened on 21 August the same year by John Betjeman. Number 2 engine was first successfully steamed on 15 November 1971.

The pumping station was designated as Grade I listed in 1985.

Initially the problem of the shortened chimney was overcome by the use of an electric fan to improve draught, but between 1996 and 1997 the chimney was repaired and restored to its full original height of .

In July 2009, the modern electric pumps at Crofton failed. While awaiting repair, British Waterways contacted the Kennet and Avon Canal Trust who put Crofton into steam.

In 2012 the Boulton and Watt engine celebrated its 200th birthday. Several special steamings were held, including a visit from the Duke of Gloucester.

== Visiting ==
The pumping station opens to visitors and the engines are in steam on designated days.

<text>SpaceDev, a part of the &quot;Space Systems Business&quot; of Sierra Nevada Corporation, is prominent for its spaceflight and microsatellite work. It designed and built components for the hybrid rocket motors for Paul Allen&#x27;s Tier One suborbital SpaceShipOne space program operated by Scaled Composites. It is also developing micro- and nano-satellites, a small expendable launch vehicle, the SpaceDev Streaker, and has designed a piloted suborbital and orbital spaceship of its own, the SpaceDev Dream Chaser, in collaboration with NASA.

SpaceDev is based near San Diego in Poway, California. Its objective is to make routine commercial spaceflight possible and to help open space for all of humanity.

Previously a publicly traded company (OTCBB:SPDV), on 20 October 2008 SpaceDev officials announced that the company would be acquired by Sierra Nevada Corporation, a privately owned company. The announced acquisition price was 38 million dollars. The role of SpaceDev will be melded into another of Sierra Nevada&#x27;s subsidiary companies, MicroSat, to create a more complete space technology unit. On December 16, 2008, SpaceDev announced its acquisition by Sierra Nevada Corporation had been completed.

== History ==

SpaceDev was founded in 1997 by Jim Benson, who acquired Integrated Space Systems of Southern California and then acquired a dormant publicly traded Colorado corporation through a reverse acquisition to create the publicly traded SpaceDev. For a while, SpaceDev also owned UK-based Space Innovations Limited. In August 1998 SpaceDev acquired all patents, intellectual property, test results, and documents that had been produced by the out of business American Rocket Company (AMROC).

On August 6, 1998, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission filed an administrative proceeding alleging securities fraud against Spacedev Inc. According to the SEC, Spacedev promotes itself extensively on the Internet. The SEC alleged that the company made false and misleading statements over the Internet and via other media in violation of U.S. securities laws in an attempt to increase its stock value. The SEC was seeking cease and desist orders against Spacedev and its chairman, James W. Benson. A settlement was reached between the SEC, Spacedev and James W. Benson. The settlement states that the SEC was founded in its allegations and SpaceDev cease and desist from committing or causing violations or future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; and Mr. Benson cease and desist from committing or causing violations or future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The company&#x27;s first big project was to be the Near Earth Asteroid Prospector, or NEAP, a small innovative commercial spacecraft mission that would have rendezvoused with and landed on a Near Earth Asteroid (NEO), conducted scientific experiments, and claimed the asteroid as private property. As it turned out however, the company&#x27;s first success would come a little closer to home, in the form of CHIPSat , the Cosmic Hot Interstellar Plasma Spectrometer microsatellite. SpaceDev built and conducted early orbit operations of the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) microsat, the first to use only the Internet for its communications, for University of California at Berkeley under NASA&#x27;s University Explorer Program (UNEX). This was followed one year later by supplying the rocket motors that propelled SpaceShipOne into the history books by creating the world&#x27;s first civilian astronauts and helping Paul Allen win the $10 million Ansari X Prize.

On October 26, 2005, SpaceDev announced that the Starsys Research Corporation of Boulder, Colorado, would merge with SpaceDev, which would provide SpaceDev with additional expertise and experience with microsatellite technologies. The acquisition of Starsys on January 31, 2006, put the number of SpaceDev employees over 200, located in three states. The Starsys division is being groomed to become a center of space robotics for SpaceDev. Over 18 years Starsys developed and delivered 2,000 space mechanisms that have flown on over 200 missions, all successfully. SpaceDev has most or all of the moving parts on Mars at this time, had mechanisms on Deep Impact, is supplying the separation system and docking mechanism for the soon to be launched Orbital Express, and has mechanisms on the way to Pluto.

On September 28, 2006, SpaceDev announced that founder and CEO Jim Benson was stepping down to start a new space tourism venture, The Benson Space Company (BSC). BSC was expected to be one of SpaceDev&#x27;s largest customers, purchasing multiple Dream Chaser spaceships for use in personal spaceflight.

On November 16, 2005, SpaceDev announced its Dream Chaser concept for a four-passenger sub-orbital and a six-passenger orbital vehicle, both based on NASA&#x27;s HL-20 &quot;Personnel Launch System&quot; or &quot;Space Taxi&quot;. SpaceDev&#x27;s suborbital Dream Chaser will use internal hybrid rocket motors similar to those SpaceDev developed for Paul Allen&#x27;s SpaceShipOne, while the orbital version will use the internal motors plus larger external hybrid motors. SpaceDev&#x27;s hybrid rocket technology was pioneered by the American Rocket Company.

On May 5, 2006, SpaceDev announced it was selected as a finalist in NASA&#x27;s $500 million Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) demonstration program. SpaceDev has been working with NASA Ames to design a modern version of the NASA HL-20 Personnel Launch System, called the SpaceDev Dream Chaser. However, on August 18, 2006, it was revealed that SpaceDev did not win the contract.

On December 18, 2006, SpaceDev announced that it has been awarded a $330,000 Phase I study contract from Benson Space Company to further the SpaceDev Dream Chaser spaceship program. The study will contribute to the ongoing development of the spaceship and will result in space vehicle and rocket motor designs ready for Phase II vehicle fabrication and testing. The SpaceDev Dream Chaser spaceship is based on NASA&#x27;s design of the ten passenger orbital HL-20 Personnel Launch System, and will launch vertically and land horizontally in direct sight of viewers.

On April 10, 2007, SpaceDev announced that it had finalized a Memorandum of Understanding with United Launch Alliance on exploring the potential of launching the SpaceDev Dream Chaser spaceship using an Atlas V 431, (having a four-meter diameter fairing, three solid rocket boosters, and a single Centaur engine in the second stage). Destinations could include the International Space Station (ISS) and other commercial orbital destinations as well as for commercial orbital space tourism flights.

On February 1, 2010, NASA announced a $20 million award to Sierra Nevada, to go toward development of the SpaceDev Dream Chaser, which could be ready for launch by 2014 on United Launch Alliance&#x27;s Atlas V rocket, according to Mark Sirangelo, corporate vice president for Sierra Nevada&#x27;s space systems division.

On August 3, 2012, NASA announced new agreements with the Sierra Nevada Corporation and two other companies to design and develop the next generation of U.S. human spaceflight capabilities, enabling a launch of astronauts from U.S. soil in the next five years. Advances made by these companies under newly signed Space Act Agreements through the agency&#x27;s Commercial Crew Integrated Capability (CCiCap) initiative are intended to ultimately lead to the availability of commercial human spaceflight services for government and commercial customers. As part of this agreement, Sierra Nevada Corporation was awarded $212.5 million, ostensibly to continue development and testing of its Dream Chaser spacecraft.

== Trailblazer ==

SpaceDev manufactured the Trailblazer satellite selected by the Operationally Responsive Space Office for its Jumpstart mission. Trailblazer was a microsatellite developed under a Missile Defense Agency contract. After being launched Trailblazer would have collected image data and communicated with a ground station.

Trailblazer was the primary payload for the third attempted flight of a Falcon 1 launch vehicle. The launch was attempted on August 3, 2008, and ended in failure, with loss of both vehicle and payload.

TrailBlazer was researched, designed, assembled, tested and packed for shipping almost entirely at the Poway SpaceDev location. With a team of about 25 employees working around the clock, the satellite was assembled and ready for launch in just under 4 months, thus meeting their advanced deadline, winning their opportunity for launch and as far as anyone else is able to substantiate, now holds the record for assembly of a launched spacecraft.

==Streaker==

The Streaker was a family of rockets conceptualized by SpaceDev with the goal of a low-cost, low complexity launch vehicle. Planned to first launch in 2007-8, it has more likely then not been abandoned by the company as little to no information is available.

<doc id="1019157" wikidata="Q317374" url="?curid=1019157" title="Viscera (wrestler)">
<text>Nelson Frazier Jr. (February 14, 1971 – February 18, 2014) was an American professional wrestler, best known for his appearances with the World Wrestling Federation/World Wrestling Entertainment (WWF/WWE) in the 1990s and 2000s under the ring names Mabel, Viscera, and Big Daddy V. A former WWF World Tag Team Champion and WWF Hardcore Champion, he won the 1995 King of the Ring tournament and consequently challenged for the WWF Championship in the main event of that year&#x27;s SummerSlam.

==Professional wrestling career==

===Early career (1991–1993)===

Frazier began his professional wrestling career under the ring name &quot;Nelson Knight&quot;, one half of tag team the &quot;Harlem Knights&quot; with his partner and storyline brother, Bobby (Robert Horne). They wrestled in the United States Wrestling Association (USWA) and the Pro Wrestling Federation (PWF), twice winning the PWF Tag Team Championship in 1992, before signing with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in July 1993.

===World Wrestling Federation (1993–1996)===
==== Debut, Tag Team Champion (1993–1994) ====

Upon coming to the WWF, The Harlem Knights were given a new gimmick: Nelson became Mabel, Bobby became Mo, and they were given a rapping manager named Oscar. The new team, dubbed Men on a Mission, was introduced to the WWF audience through vignettes portraying them as three African American men trying to make a positive change in inner city neighborhoods in June 1993. Clad in purple and yellow, sometimes pink and turquoise; they debuted as solid faces. At WrestleMania X, Men on a Mission defeated the WWF Tag Team champions, The Quebecers, by countout, but did not win the belts. On March 29, 1994, they won the title at a house show in London, England. The Quebecers regained the title two days later in Sheffield, England. In mid-1994, Mabel began wrestling more singles matches; he was seen as the spectacle of Men on a Mission due to his size, the &quot;special attraction&quot; that got used to make rising stars look good. He competed in the 1994 King of the Ring tournament, defeating Pierre of the Quebecers in the qualifying round before losing to IRS in the quarterfinals. He then had a match that pit &quot;Rap vs. Country&quot; against Jeff Jarrett at SummerSlam, which Jarrett won.

==== King of the Ring, departure (1995–1996) ====
In March 1995, Men on a Mission lost a title match against the reigning tag team champions Smoking Gunns. Mabel and Mo brutally assaulted them afterward, but offered an apology and brought Billy and Bart Gunn out after a match a few weeks later for a handshake. It proved to be a ruse, however, as Mabel and Mo not only beat up Billy and Bart, but also turned on Oscar and became heels. Mabel dropped his fun-loving, positive personality in favor of adopting a more thuggish image and received a push as a singles wrestler, winning the King of the Ring tournament in June. After that, Mabel became known as King Mabel, with Mo becoming &quot;Sir Mo&quot;, his manager. King Mabel was awarded a championship belt, designed and created by belt maker Reggie Parks. The belt, engraved with &quot;King of the Ring&quot;, is one of a kind, as the World Wrestling Federation had not before or since created a belt for the King of the Ring. This belt was never seen on WWF television. After his victory King Mabel became the top heel in the company and challenged WWF Champion Diesel at August&#x27;s SummerSlam. Just before SummerSlam, the WWF turned Davey Boy Smith, one of the company&#x27;s more popular wrestlers, against the fans, replacing King Mabel as the company&#x27;s top villain. The turn occurred on the August 21, 1995 edition of &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot;, where Men on a Mission were to wrestle Smith and Lex Luger, who were then known as The Allied Powers. Luger was not at the event, so Smith convinced Diesel to be his partner. Smith then attacked Diesel during the match and joined King Mabel and Sir Mo in assaulting him. The attack was called the &quot;Royal Plan&quot; and at least for a period it appeared that Smith, King Mabel, Sir Mo, and Jim Cornette were going to be aligned in the future; this never came to pass. At SummerSlam, Diesel defeated King Mabel to retain the WWF Championship. Frazier was very nearly handed his release from the company after injuring Diesel&#x27;s back during the match. However, Diesel (real name Kevin Nash), later talked McMahon out of firing Frazier.

Although he was no longer the main villain in the WWF, the company moved Frazier to another high-profile feud involving The Undertaker. The rivalry started after Mabel helped Yokozuna, another wrestler managed by Jim Cornette, attack a downed Undertaker. During the course of the attack, Mabel was to hit a series of leg drops on the fallen Undertaker. Mabel repeatedly struck Undertaker in the face; this resulted in Undertaker suffering a legitimate fracture of his orbital bone, which put him out of action for two months. The Undertaker returned wearing a Phantom of the Opera-style mask and, a month later, defeated King Mabel in a Casket match at In Your House 5: Seasons Beatings. After this match, Frazier&#x27;s push came to an end and within several weeks both he and Horne were fired. His last three matches were on the New Year&#x27;s Day edition of &quot;Raw&quot; when he was buried in an eight-second loss to Diesel, on the January 6, 1996 edition of &quot;WWF Superstars&quot; when he lost a rematch to The Undertaker in a casket match, and in the 1996 Royal Rumble match where he was the third wrestler eliminated by his former rival Yokozuna.

===Various promotions (1995–1998)===
Frazier then wrestled for the Puerto Rico-based World Wrestling Council (WWC) from 1995 to 1996. There, he feuded with Carlos Colón. The Universal Heavyweight Championship was held up after a match between the two. Mabel soon after won the championship and held it for a month defeating Colon on January 7, 1996. He also returned to Tennessee to wrestle for the United States Wrestling Association, which went through a number of administration changes during his stay, and was rebranded Memphis Championship Wrestling and Memphis Wrestling. He captured the USWA Heavyweight Championship in March 1996 and the North American Heavyweight Championship in February 1998. These were each the top title in the promotion at the time. On December 1, 1996, he went to Tokyo, Japan and lost to Koji Kitao at Inoki Festival in Yoyogi. Mable left USWA in March 1997 before the company folded in November 1997. He was inactive for the rest of 1997. On November 1, 1998, Mabel made a one-night-only surprise appearance at Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW)&#x27;s November to Remember, as a Full Blooded Italians member with Ulf Herman, attacking Tommy Rogers and Chris Chetti until Spike Dudley made the save. He later divulged that ECW had &quot;the best locker room of all time&quot; and said he was paid several thousand dollars for his appearance.

===Return to WWF (1998–2000)===
==== Ministry of Darkness and Corporate Ministry (1998–1999) ====

On July 6, 1998, Mabel made a one-night-only surprise (taped June 30) return to the WWF to unsuccessfully challenge the new King of the Ring, Ken Shamrock.

On January 24, 1999, Frazier made his full-time return, first appearing at the pre-show for the Royal Rumble as Mabel, then on the show itself. He eliminated five competitors; Droz, Steve Blackman, Dan Severn, Tiger Ali Singh and The Blue Meanie. Later he was eliminated (kidnapped) by The Undertaker, his Acolytes (Bradshaw and Faarooq) and Mideon. The next night on &quot;Raw is War&quot;, he was reintroduced as Viscera, he began acting as the Ministry of Darkness&#x27; enforcer, adopting a gothic look in the process, including white-out contact lenses, a bleached mohawk and a black bodysuit.

==== Hardcore Champion and departure (1999–2000) ====
The Ministry of Darkness would break up in July 1999, and Viscera floated around the mid-card, frequently teaming with fellow former Ministry member Mideon and becoming part of the burgeoning hardcore division, winning the WWF Hardcore Championship on April 2, 2000, at WrestleMania 2000, and losing it minutes later, in the same Battle Royal-style match. He also feuded with Mark Henry after body splashing Henry&#x27;s girlfriend, Mae Young in February 2000. He was taken off the WWF main roster in April and was sent to the development territory Memphis Championship Wrestling (MCW) before he was released from his WWF contract in August 2000.

===Independent circuit (2000–2004)===
Following his release from the WWF, Frazier returned to the independent circuit. He wrestled in the United Kingdom for a while. He then started working for Memphis Wrestling in 2003, and feuded with Jerry Lawler once again. He would later lose to Rocky Johnson in a boxing match on November 29, 2003. On Valentine&#x27;s Day 2004, he won a 15-man battle royal.

===Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2003)===
In March 2003, Frazier, as Nelson Knight, made a surprise appearance at a monthly Total Nonstop Action Wrestling pay-per-view, at the side of Ron Killings. He appeared once more the next week.

===Second return to WWE (2004–2008)===
==== World&#x27;s Largest Love Machine (2004–2007) ====

Frazier, as Viscera, returned to the former WWF (by then renamed World Wrestling Entertainment) as a surprise in September 2004, him and Gangrel attacking former Ministry of Darkness leader, The Undertaker, at the command of former Ministry Acolyte, the WWE Champion John &quot;Bradshaw&quot; Layfield (JBL). After two weeks on SmackDown!, he was moved to the Raw brand. In his first three months on the Raw brand, Viscera mainly wrestled on &quot;Raw&#x27;s&quot; sister show &quot;Heat&quot;, only making sporadic appearances on &quot;Raw&quot;. His first major storyline there started in April 2005, when he aligned with Trish Stratus as part of her feud with Lita and Lita&#x27;s husband, Kane. While working together, Viscera and Stratus appeared in a segment in which he attempted to seduce her, only to be rebuffed. Stratus implied he would first need to &quot;take care&quot; of Kane. That segment began a gimmick change for Viscera, who transformed into &quot;The World&#x27;s Largest Love Machine&quot;. After losing to Kane at Backlash on May 1, he injured Stratus with his Big Splash finishing move, angry about her constant belittling of him, turning face in the process for the first time since 1995.

Viscera began wrestling in pajamas and making overtly sexual gestures in the ring. He became smitten with &quot;Raw&quot; ring announcer Lilian Garcia and tried different tactics to seduce her every week. At Vengeance on June 26, Garcia finally reciprocated, proposing to him in the center of the ring, only to be turned down and left crying in the ring when The Godfather arrived with many of his hos to show Viscera what he would be leaving behind if he got married. At the Royal Rumble on January 29, 2006, Viscera competed in the Royal Rumble match where he was eliminated by Carlito and Chris Masters. Viscera then teamed with Val Venis to form V–Squared. They teamed together for nearly nine months, mainly on &quot;Heat&quot;. They challenged for the World Tag Team Championship on several occasions, but never held the title. When Venis was sidelined with a legitimate injury in April, Viscera returned to singles wrestling. He attempted to reconcile with Garcia, but was interrupted and attacked by Umaga during his proposal. Two weeks later, when Garcia was legitimately and accidentally knocked from the ring apron by Charlie Haas and sprained her wrist, the incident was worked into a storyline of Haas and Viscera fighting over Garcia. After Garcia declared she wanted to be just friends, Haas seemingly raked Viscera in the eye, with Viscera feigning to accidentally Samoan slam Garcia. After Viscera gave Garcia the Samoan slam, both men laughed about the incident, resulting in Viscera and Haas turning heel in the process. The team split up when Haas reunited with Shelton Benjamin to reform The World&#x27;s Greatest Tag Team.
==== Big Daddy V (2007–2008) ====
On June 17, 2007, Viscera was drafted to the ECW brand in the supplemental section of WWE&#x27;s draft. Three weeks later, he debuted on &quot;ECW&quot;, repackaged as Big Daddy V, a &quot;hired muscle&quot; character in the employ of Matt Striker, arriving just in time to help Striker in his rivalry with The Boogeyman. After disposing of The Boogeyman, Big Daddy V defeated Tommy Dreamer on the October 2 episode of &quot;ECW&quot; in the finals of the Elimination Chase to become the number one contender for the ECW Championship at No Mercy on October 7. At No Mercy, he lost to CM Punk by disqualification, when Striker interfered in the match. He then feuded with SmackDown!&#x27;s Kane. At Survivor Series on November 18, Big Daddy V competed in a Survivor Series elimination match where his team lost. At Armageddon on December 16, Big Daddy V and Mark Henry defeated CM Punk and Kane. Big Daddy V was an entrant in the Royal Rumble match at the Royal Rumble on January 27, 2008 where he was eliminated by Triple H. His last PPV appearance was when he participated in the SmackDown Elimination Chamber match at No Way Out on February 17, but was eliminated by Batista. He wrestled his last WWE match on the March 11 episode of &quot;ECW&quot;, losing to CM Punk in a Money in the Bank qualifying match. He was inactive due to an injury. In the 2008 WWE Supplemental Draft, he was drafted to the SmackDown brand. Frazier was released from his WWE contract on August 8, 2008.

===Later career (2008–2013)===

After leaving WWE for the final time, Frazier joined the National Wrestling Alliance, as King V. On October 3, 2008, defeated Rob Conway in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The next night in Corpus Christi, Texas, King V defeated Andy Dalton and Joey Spector in a handicap match. On August 8, 2009, at Juggalo Championship Wrestling (JCW)&#x27;s 10th Annual Gathering of the Juggalos, Viscera defeated 2 Tuff Tony in a &quot;Loser Leaves JCW&quot; match, with WWE Hall of Famer Terry Funk as special guest referee. After the match, Frazier, Funk, and Balls Mahoney (who had interfered earlier in the match) all attacked Tony. From this time he also wrestled in Mexico, Canada, and Germany. On March 31, 2012, he defeated Shad Gaspard at Wrestling In The Rest Of The World WrestleRama event in Georgetown, Guyana. In September 2012, Big Daddy V appeared for the Japanese promotion Inoki Genome Federation at their GENOME 22 event, losing to Atsushi Sawada. Frazier performed at three Family Wrestling Entertainment shows in 2012 as Big Daddy V, first defeating Malta the Damager in a tables match in February. Frazier&#x27;s final match, as Big Daddy V, was a win over René Duprée on Qatar Pro Wrestling&#x27;s inaugural tour, on October 5, 2013.

===All Japan Pro Wrestling (2010–2011)===
Frazier wrestled for All Japan Pro Wrestling, as Big Daddy Voodoo (later just Big Daddy), and held the All Asia Tag Team Champion with TARU from April 29 to August 29, 2011. He was part of the Voodoo Murders stable. He left AJPW in late 2011, after competing in the World&#x27;s Strongest Tag Determination League with Joe Doering.

== Reception ==
During his stint as Mabel, Frazier gained notoriety for his stiff and unsafe in-ring performances. In an interview with Kayfabe Commentaries, Kevin Nash implied that his decline from the top of the card was due to his wrestling style. Nash said that Frazier&#x27;s style was very reckless and he had little regard for the safety of his fellow wrestlers. He said that entering their match at SummerSlam, Frazier had already injured &quot;six or eight&quot; of his colleagues in the ring. Nash said that one of the injuries was to one of the Samoans on the roster (Fatu), which he implied was not easy to do and should have raised a red flag. He pointed to Frazier&#x27;s use of a frequently utilized move by wrestlers of comparable size, the sitdown splash. Most wrestlers who perform this move, like Frazier, are super heavyweights, such as the aforementioned Fatu (who adopted the move later in his career), Yokozuna, and Earthquake. These wrestlers usually do so without incident, as they perform it in such a manner that very little of their body weight actually comes in contact with the opponent&#x27;s body, resulting in the wrestler landing on the opponent&#x27;s chest. Frazier kicked his legs out while performing the move and thus did not allow himself to stop before impact. Nash said that this caused all of Frazier&#x27;s 500-plus pound mass to shift to his backside and thus he would drop onto the opponent full force. Nash requested Frazier to leave the move out of their SummerSlam match, due to a pre-existing back injury. Frazier disregarded the request and performed the sitdown splash on Nash anyway, crashing into his lower back with enough force to cause Nash&#x27;s spine to compress and his core muscles to stretch out. Nash later was diagnosed with a badly strained abdomen that affected his performance the rest of the match, as he could barely feel his legs, and he believed that he had suffered some sort of permanent damage to his spine. Backstage, Nash recounted that a furious Vince McMahon was ready to fire Frazier immediately after the match and was about to hand him his release papers, but Nash stepped in and convinced McMahon otherwise as he did not feel Frazier should lose his job over the incident.

Frazier&#x27;s continued perceived recklessness would eventually result in him being released from the WWF. During his feud with The Undertaker, Frazier once again found himself in trouble due to his inability to perform the leg drop correctly. Instead of landing his leg across The Undertaker&#x27;s chest as in a normal leg drop, Mabel repeatedly struck The Undertaker in the face; this resulted in The Undertaker suffering a legitimate fracture of his orbital bone, which put him out of action for two months. Although King Mabel was to wrestle The Undertaker once he returned, Frazier&#x27;s days in the WWF were numbered after this incident as he had injured yet another of the company&#x27;s top stars.

==Personal life==
Frazier was married to Cassandra Frazier until his death in 2014. Due to obesity, Frazier had high blood pressure and diabetes. His wife Cassandra stated that he had been planning on being more healthy before his death, as doctors told him his blood pressure was way too high, and it was affecting his type 2 diabetes. He reacted by removing salt and sugar from his diet, which resulted in him losing over 100 pounds, with his high blood pressure dropping to a healthy level.

==Death and lawsuit==
On February 18, 2014, Frazier died of a heart attack, just four days after his 43rd birthday. He was cremated, and his widow divided the ashes into 500 pendants as gifts for his loved ones.

On the one-year anniversary of Viscera&#x27;s death, his widow filed a wrongful death lawsuit against WWE, alleging that the company had concealed information, misrepresented research, and misinformed Viscera and other wrestlers on performance risks relating to concussions and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), which the suit claimed left him with severe short-term memory loss, migraines, and depression, which contributed to his death. WWE attorney Jerry McDevitt responded in an interview with the &quot;Boston Herald&quot;, explaining that the company was considering pursuing action against Cassandra Frazier&#x27;s attorney, Konstantine Kyros, who has been involved in other lawsuits against WWE. McDevitt called Viscera&#x27;s death &quot;tragic&quot;, but added: &quot;It&#x27;s ridiculous that someone can ... try to blame someone because a gentleman with a weight problem died of a heart attack in the shower eight years after he last performed.&quot; The lawsuit was dismissed by US District Judge Vanessa Lynne Bryant, who ruled that they failed to show that his death was linked to CTE.

<text>Ficus citrifolia, also known as the shortleaf fig, giant bearded fig, Jagüey, wild banyantree and Wimba tree, is a species of banyan native to southern Florida, the Caribbean, Mexico, Central America, and northern South America south to Paraguay. It is distinguished from the closely related Florida strangler fig (&quot;Ficus aurea&quot;) mainly by the finer veining in the leaves.

==Description==

 &quot;Ficus citrifolia&quot; trees typically grow 15 m (50 ft) tall, and may cover a wide area due to their ability to drop aerial roots from branches and spread horizontally, fusing with the parent tree as they grow. They have a broad top, light grey bark, some aerial roots and milky sap. The leaves of &quot;F. citrifolia&quot; are dark green. They are oval shaped with a rounded base and pointed tip. Small flowers are enclosed in open ended fruit. The fruit appears on the ends of long stalks protruding from the leaf axils. Fruit turn from yellow to dark-red when ripe. This fruit is sweet and can be eaten raw.

== Ecology ==

New trees begin their life as an epiphyte, a strategy which allows them to avoid competition for light and land. &quot;F. citrifolia&quot; commonly attacks palms, bald cypress, oaks and other trees, strangling them as it grows.

&quot;Ficus citrifolia&quot; is under strong selective pressure to flower and produce fruit year round due to its mutualistic relationship with its pollinating agaonid wasp. Agaonid wasps have a symbiotic relationship with figs such that a given agaonid species acts as a pollinator for just one species of fig, and a particular fig species is pollinated by just one species of wasp. &quot;F. citrifolia&quot; is pollinated by &quot;P. assuetus&quot;. After pollination, figs ripen quickly. The growth rate of figs is slower during the cold dry months in comparison to hot and rainy months were fruit growth is concentrated. Fruit bearing figs are heavily laden; a single tree may produce up to 1,000,000 fruits with a diameter of 1–2.5 cm. The fruit of &quot;F. citrifolia&quot; tends to have a purgative effect on the digestive systems of many animals; ripe fruits are eaten and seeds are spread widely through dung.

The invertebrates within &quot;F. citrifolia&quot; syconia in southern Florida include a pollinating wasp, &quot;P. assuetus&quot;, up to eight or more species of non-pollinating wasps, a plant-parasitic nematode transported by the pollinator, a parasitic nematode attacking the pollinating wasp, mites, a midge, and a predatory rove beetle whose adults and larvae eat fig wasps. Nematodes: &quot;Schistonchus laevigatus&quot; (Aphelenchoididae) is a plant-parasitic nematode associated with the pollinator &quot;Pegoscapus assuetus&quot; and syconia of &quot;F. citrifolia&quot;. &quot;Parasitodiplogaster laevigata&quot; is a parasite of the pollinator &quot;Pegoscapus assuetus&quot;. Mites: belonging to the family Tarsonemidae (Acarina) have been recognized in the syconia of &quot;F. aurea&quot; and &quot;F. citrifolia&quot;, but they have not been identified even to genus, and their behavior is undescribed. Midges: &quot;Ficiomyia perarticulata&quot; (Cecidomyiidae) oviposits in the walls of syconia of &quot;F. citrifolia&quot;, and the developing larvae induce the plant to form galls there. Rove beetles: &quot;Charoxus spinifer&quot; is a rove beetle (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae) whose adults enter late-stage syconia of &quot;F. aurea&quot; and &quot;F. citrifolia&quot;. Adults eat fig wasps; larvae develop within the syconia and prey on fig wasps, then pupate in the ground.

== Keystone species ==

&quot;Ficus citrifolia&quot; is considered a tropical keystone species. Figs are a major component of the diets of more species of animals than any other tropical perennial fruit. Since &quot;F. citrifolia&quot; fruits year round many primates, birds and other species, feed exclusively on figs during seasons when other fruit is scarce. Additionally, the knobby, hollow, lattice-like trunk of this tree provides a home for thousands of invertebrates, rodents, bats, birds and reptiles.

&quot;F. citrifolia&quot; is considered common and is not in danger of extinction.

== Genetic mosaics ==

&quot;F. citrifolia&quot; may fuse with figs of other species types, creating a cumulate tree that is a genetic mosaic. Research suggests that the frequency of genetic mosaicism among strangler figs may be quite high; it is unknown how this variation effects flowering in mosaic figs. (Thomson et al., 1995). Thomson et al. suggest that if genetically different segments of a single tree flower asynchronously, agaonid wasp populations may be more resistant to low host population sizes that previously thought. Alternatively, genetic mosaicism could mean that the number of certain varieties of fig in an ecosystem may be far lower than biologists have previously thought, and given populations may not have enough trees to maintain their symbiotic relationship with their pollinating wasps.

== History ==

One theory is that the Portuguese name for &quot;F. citrifolia&quot;, &quot;Os Barbados&quot;, gave Barbados its name. It appears on the coat of arms of Barbados, and the removal of one specimen, over 100 years old, was enough to draw attention.

== Medicine ==

An extract of &quot;F. citrifolia&quot; may have therapeutic value for chemotherapy patients.

<doc id="1019165" wikidata="Q475494" url="?curid=1019165" title="Dream Chaser">
<text>Dream Chaser is an American reusable lifting-body spaceplane developed by Sierra Space. Originally intended as a crewed vehicle, the Dream Chaser Space System is set to be produced after the Dream Chaser Cargo System cargo variant is operational. The crewed variant is planned to carry up to seven people and cargo to and from low Earth orbit. Sierra plans to manufacture a fleet of the spaceplane.

The Dream Chaser was originally started in 2004 as a project of SpaceDev, a company that was later acquired by the Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC) in 2008. In April 2021 the project was taken over by the Sierra Space Corporation (SSC), spun off from the Sierra Nevada Corporation as its own fully independent company.

The cargo Dream Chaser is designed to resupply the International Space Station with both pressurized and unpressurized cargo. It is intended to be launched vertically on the Vulcan Centaur rocket and autonomously land horizontally on conventional runways. A proposed version to be operated by European Space Agency (ESA) would launch on an Arianespace vehicle.

The Dream Chaser concept and design is a descendant of NASA&#x27;s HL-20 Personnel Launch System.

==Spacecraft==

The Dream Chaser spaceplane is designed to be launched on the top of a typical rocket and land like an airplane on a runway. The design has heritage going back decades. Currently, the Dream Chaser will resupply the ISS with cargo. Per the company&#x27;s website, a crew version is planned for a later date.

Sierra Space is currently contracted under CRS-2 to perform resupply missions to the ISS over the next few years.

=== Propulsion ===
On-orbit propulsion of the Dream Chaser was originally proposed to be provided by twin hybrid rocket engines capable of repeated starts and throttling. At the time, the SSC&#x27;s predecessor, the SNC was also developing a similar hybrid rocket for Virgin Galactic&#x27;s SpaceShipTwo. In May 2014, SNC involvement in the SpaceShipTwo program ended.

After the acquisition of Orbitec LLC in July 2014, Sierra Nevada Corporation announced a major change to the propulsion system. The hybrid rocket engine design was dropped in favor of a cluster of Orbitec&#x27;s Vortex engines. The new unit would be a pressure-fed three-mode engine. At low- and mid-power regimes it uses monopropellant fuel hydrogen peroxide and in high-power demand, the engine adds injection of RP-1 fuel. This increased thrust will be useful to shorten the de-orbit burn duration of the Dream Chaser.

=== Thermal protection system ===
Its thermal protection system (TPS) is made up of silica-based tiles (for most of the belly and upper portion of the heat shield), and a new composite material called Toughened Unipiece Fibrous Reusable Oxidation Resistant Ceramic (TUFROC) to cover the nose and leading edges.

===Shooting Star module===
In 2019, it was announced that an expendable Shooting Star cargo module would be part of the Dream Chaser cargo system for CRS-2 flights. The module is a attachment to Dream Chaser that will allow the spacecraft to carry an additional of pressurized and unpressurized cargo to ISS. The module supports disposal of unwanted cargo by burning up upon re-entry.

In addition to carrying cargo, the Shooting Star module includes solar panels that supply up to 6 kW of electrical power. It also supplies active and passive thermal management; provides Dream Chaser translation and rotation capability via six mounted thrusters; and supports berthing or docking (in different configurations) to the ISS. Access from ISS to Dream Chaser will involve crew passing through Shooting Star (which supports a shirt-sleeve environment) and through a hatch that separates Shooting Star from Dream Chaser. Sierra Nevada says the module is capable of additional types of missions in LEO or to cis-lunar destinations; they have developed a free-flying variant with additional capabilities.

In July 2020, Sierra Nevada announced a contract with the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) to use its Shooting Star expendable cargo vehicle as a possible commercial solution for a high-powered uncrewed orbital outpost.

=== Technology partners ===
In 2010, the following organizations were named as technology partners for the original passenger Dream Chaser:
* Aerojet – reaction control system technology
* AdamWorks – composites
* Charles Stark Draper Laboratory – guidance, navigation, and control
* Lockheed Martin – airframe construction and human rating of the spaceplane
* MDA – systems engineering
* University of Colorado – human-rating

==History==
The Dream Chaser design is derived from NASA&#x27;s HL-20 Personnel Launch System spaceplane concept, which in turn is descended from a series of test vehicles, including the X-20 Dyna-Soar, Northrop M2-F2, Northrop M2-F3, Northrop HL-10, Martin X-24A and X-24B, and Martin X-23 PRIME.

The name &quot;Dream Chaser&quot; had been previously used for two separate space vehicle concepts. The first was planned to be an orbital vehicle based on the HL-20, with the second suborbital vehicle proposed by the Benson Space Company for the purposes of space tourism.

The Dream Chaser was publicly announced on September 20, 2004. In April 2007, SpaceDev announced that it had partnered with the United Launch Alliance to pursue the possibility of using the Atlas V booster rocket as the Dream Chaser&#x27;s launch vehicle. In June 2007, SpaceDev signed a Space Act agreement with NASA.

On October 21, 2008, SpaceDev with Dream Chaser was acquired by the Sierra Nevada Corporation for US$38 million.

===CCDev phase 1===
On February 1, 2010, Sierra Nevada Corporation was awarded $20 million in seed money under NASA&#x27;s Commercial Crew Development (CCDev) program for the development of the Dream Chaser. SNC completed the four planned milestones on time, including hybrid rocket test fires and the preliminary structure design. Further initial Dream Chaser tests included the drop test of a 15% scaled version at the NASA Dryden Flight Research Center.

===CCDev phase 2===
Sierra Nevada proposed Dream Chaser for the CCDev phase 2 solicitation by NASA in October 2010, with an estimated project cost of less than $1 billion. On 18 April 2011, NASA awarded $80 million to Sierra Nevada Corporation for Dream Chaser. Since then, nearly a dozen further milestones have been completed under that Space Act Agreement. Some of these milestones included testing of an improved airfoil fin shape, integrated flight software and hardware, landing gear, a full-scale captive carry flight test, and a Systems Requirement Review (SRR).

By February 2012, Sierra Nevada Corporation stated that it had completed the assembly and delivery of the primary structure of the first Dream Chaser flight test vehicle. With this, SNC completed all 11 of its CCDev milestones that were scheduled up to that point. SNC stated in a press release that it was &quot;on time and on budget.&quot;

On May 29, 2012, the Dream Chaser Engineering Test Article (ETA) was lifted by an Erickson Skycrane helicopter in a captive carry test to better determine its aerodynamic properties. In May 2013, the ETA was shipped to the Dryden Flight Research Center in California for a series of ground tests and aerodynamic flight tests. A second captive carry flight test was completed on August 22, 2013.

On June 12, 2012, SNC announced the commemoration of its fifth year as a NASA Langley partner in the design and development of Dream Chaser. The NASA/SNC team had worked on aerodynamic and aerothermal analysis of Dream Chaser, as well as guidance, navigation, and control systems. Together with ULA, the NASA/SNC team performed buffet tests on the Dream Chaser and Atlas V stack.

On July 11, 2012, SNC announced that it successfully completed testing of the nose landing gear for Dream Chaser. This milestone evaluated the impact to the landing gear during simulated approach and landing tests as well as the impact of future orbital flights. The main landing gear was tested in a similar way in February 2012. The nose gear landing test was the last milestone to be completed before the free flight approach and landing tests scheduled for later in 2012. In August 2012, SNC completed CCiCap Milestone 1, or the &#x27;Program Implementation Plan Review&#x27;. This included creating a plan for implementing design, development, testing, and evaluation activities through the duration of CCiCap funding. By October 2012 the &quot;Integrated System Baseline Review&quot;, or CCiCap Milestone 2, had been completed. This review demonstrated the maturity of the Dream Chaser Space System as well as the integration and support of the Atlas V launch vehicle, mission systems, and ground systems.

===CCiCap===
On August 3, 2012, NASA announced the award of $212.5 million to Sierra Nevada Corporation to continue work on the Dream Chaser under the Commercial Crew Integrated Capability (CCiCap) Program. On January 30, 2013, SNC announced a new partnership with Lockheed Martin. Under the agreement, SNC will pay Lockheed Martin $10 million to build the second airframe at its Michoud facility in New Orleans, Louisiana. This second airframe is slated to be the first orbital test vehicle, with orbital flight testing planned to begin within the next two years.

In January 2013, Sierra Nevada announced that the second captive carry and first unpowered drop test of Dream Chaser would take place at Edwards Air Force Base, California in March 2013. The spaceplane release would occur at altitude and would be followed by an autonomous robotic landing.

On March 13, 2013, NASA announced that former Space Shuttle commander Lee Archambault was leaving the agency in order to join SNC. Archambault, a former combat pilot and 15-year NASA veteran who flew on &quot;Atlantis&quot; and &quot;Discovery&quot;, will work on the Dream Chaser program as a systems engineer and test pilot.

On October 26, 2013, the first free-flight occurred. The test vehicle was released from the helicopter and flew the correct flightpath to touchdown less than a minute later. Just prior to landing, the left main landing gear failed to deploy resulting in a crash landing. The vehicle skidded off the runway in a cloud of dust, but was found upright with the crew compartment intact and all systems inside still in working order.

In January 2014, SNC announced it had signed a launch contract to fly the first orbital test vehicle on a robotically controlled orbital test flight in November 2016.
In early 2014, Sierra Nevada completed its wind tunnel testing as part of its CCiCAP Milestone 8. The wind tunnel testing involved analyzing the flight dynamics characteristics that the vehicle will experience during orbital ascent and re-entry. Wind tunnel testing was also completed for the Dream Chaser Atlas V integrated launch system. These tests were completed at NASA Ames Research Center at Moffett Field, California, CALSPAN Transonic Wind Tunnel in New York, and at NASA Langley Research Center Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel in Hampton, Virginia.

On August 1, 2014, the first completed piece of the orbital Flight Test Article (FTA) composite airframe was unveiled at a Lockheed Martin facility.

===CCtCap===
On September 16, 2014, NASA did not select the Dream Chaser for CCtCap, the next phase of the Commercial Crew Program. This occurred despite previous Commercial Crew Development awards in every phase since 2009, due to lack of maturity.

On September 26, Sierra Nevada filed a protest to the US Government Accountability Office (GAO). On October 22, 2014, a Federal Judge ruled the contract awards to Boeing and SpaceX valid, allowing NASA to proceed.

On September 29, 2014, Sierra Nevada introduced the &quot;Dream Chaser Global Project&quot; which would provide customized access to low Earth orbit to global customers.

Despite not being selected to continue forward under NASA&#x27;s Commercial Crew transportation Capability (CCtCap) phase of the effort to send crews to orbit via private companies, SNC completed the milestones assigned under earlier phases of the CCP. On December 2, 2014, SNC announced that it completed NASA&#x27;s CCiCap Milestone 5a related to propulsion risk reduction for the Dream Chaser space system.

By late December, details had emerged that &quot;a high-ranking agency official&quot;—&quot;William Gerstenmaier, the agency&#x27;s top human exploration official and the one who made the final decision&quot;—&quot;opted to rank Boeing&#x27;s proposal higher than a previous panel of agency procurement experts.&quot; More specifically, Sierra Nevada asserted in their filings with the GAO that Gerstenmaier may have &quot;overstepped his authority by unilaterally changing the scoring criteria.&quot;

On January 5, 2015, the GAO denied Sierra Nevada&#x27;s CCtCap challenge, stating that NASA made the proper decision when it decided to award Boeing $4.2 billion and SpaceX $2.6 billion to develop their vehicles. Ralph White, the GAO&#x27;s managing associate counsel, announced that NASA &quot;recognized Boeing&#x27;s higher price but also considered Boeing&#x27;s proposal to be the strongest of all three proposals in terms of technical approach, management approach and past performance, and to offer the crew transportation system with most utility and highest value to the government.&quot; Furthermore, the agency found &quot;several favorable features&quot; in SNC&#x27;s proposal &quot;but ultimately concluded that SpaceX&#x27;s lower price made it a better value.&quot;

===CRS-2 selection===

In December 2014, Sierra Nevada proposed Dream Chaser for CRS-2 consideration. In January 2016, NASA announced that Dream Chaser had been awarded one of the CRS-2 contracts and committed to purchasing a minimum of six resupply missions to the ISS. The cargo spacecraft will fly alongside spacecraft from the existing CRS-1 contract holders SpaceX and Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems.

In October 2015, the thermal protection system was installed on the Engineering Test Article (ETA) for the next phase of atmospheric flight testing. The orbital cabin assembly of the Flight Test Article (FTA) was also completed by contractor Lockheed Martin.

In 2015, the ETA had reportedly been given the name Eagle, while the FTA was originally named Ascalon before being changed to Ascension.

On November 11, 2017, the Dream Chaser ETA was released from an altitude of 3,700 m and successfully landed at Edwards AFB.

In March 2019, completion of NASA&#x27;s Integrated Review Milestone 5 (IR5) confirmed that development was still on schedule. In August 2019, SNC announced the first ISS flight of the Dream Chaser, known as SNC Demo-1, was planned for 2021. However, on November 17, 2020, SNC announced it would be delayed until early 2022. 

In April 2021 SNC spun off its Dream Chaser division, creating the fully independent Sierra Space Corporation, which assumed responsibility for the further development of the Dream Chaser space vehicle system. 

In May 2022, it was announced by the deputy manager of ISS, Dana Weigel, that the mission was scheduled for February 2023. 

In May 2024, it was announced that Dream Chaser &quot;Tenacity&quot; completed initial flight testing and was headed next to Kennedy Space Center to prepare for launch. It arrived later that month for launch preparation. The Vulcan Centaur to be used for the launch arrived to KSC in late June 2024. However, the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; reports, June 26, &quot;Dream Chaser dropped from next Vulcan launch as ULA targets national security certification&quot;. The mission has since been delayed to no earlier than May 2025.

== Variants ==

===Crewed version===
The originally planned Dream Chaser Space System is a human-rated version designed to carry from three to seven people and cargo to orbital destinations such as the International Space Station. It was to have a built-in launch escape system and could fly autonomously if needed. Although it could use any suitable launch vehicle, it was planned to be launched on a human-rated Atlas V N12 rocket. The vehicle will be able to return from space by gliding (typically experiencing less than 1.5 g on re-entry) and landing on any airport runway that handles commercial air traffic. Its reaction control system thrusters burned ethanol-based fuel, which is not an explosively volatile material, nor toxic like hydrazine, allowing the Dream Chaser to be handled immediately after landing, unlike the Space Shuttle.

 the Sierra Nevada Corporation said it still planned to produce a crewed version of the spacecraft within the next 5 years. The company said it &quot;never stopped working&quot; on the crewed version and fully intended to launch it after the cargo version, and is still committed to the crewed version 

In November 2021, Sierra Space Corporation reported that it received a $1.4 billion investment in Series A funding, which it would use to develop a crewed version of Dream Chaser and fly astronauts by 2025. On October 25, 2021, Blue Origin and Sierra Space, released their plan for a commercial space station. The station, called Orbital Reef, is intended as a &quot;mixed-use business park&quot;. Sierra Space Corporation&#x27;s Dream Chaser was chosen as one of the commercial spacecraft to transport commercial crew to and from the space station, along with Boeing&#x27;s Starliner.

===CRS-2 cargo version===
The cargo version of the SSC Dream Chaser is called the Dream Chaser Cargo System (DCCS) and after development is completed, will fly resupply flights to the ISS under NASA&#x27;s Commercial Resupply Services-2 program. Featuring an expendable cargo module mounting solar panels, the spacecraft will be capable of returning to Earth while undergoing maximum re-entry forces of 1.5G.

To meet CRS-2 guidelines, the cargo Dream Chaser will have folding wings and fit within a 5 m diameter payload fairing, in contrast to the Crewed Dream Chaser, which is intended to launch without a fairing. The ability to fit into a payload fairing allows the cargo version to launch on any sufficiently capable vehicle, such as the (retired) Ariane 5 as well as the (soon to be retired) Atlas V. An expendable cargo module will launch attached to the back of the spacecraft, expanding the cargo uplift capacity and supporting the disposal of up to of trash. Total uplift is planned for pressurized and unpressurized, with a downlift of contained within the spaceplane. The expendable cargo module is called &quot;Shooting Star&quot;.

On August 14, 2019, it was announced that all six Dream Chaser CRS-2 flights would be carried into orbit by ULA&#x27;s Vulcan launch vehicle, with the first Dream Chaser flight being the second Vulcan flight in late 2021. However, on February 9, 2022, Ken Shields, Sierra Space&#x27;s Director of Commercial Market Development, announced that the first flight would be pushed to January 2023. The launch has been further delayed; it is scheduled for no earlier than May 2025.

===National Security version===
On November 19, 2021, Sierra Space announced that it is considering a third Dream Chaser version specialized for National Security missions, though it declined to comment on what the differences compared with other versions would be.

==Dream Chaser Global Project==
In December 2013, the German Aerospace Center (DLR) announced a funded study to investigate ways in which Europe might take advantage of the Dream Chaser crewed spaceplane technology. Named the DC4EU (Dream Chaser for European Utilization), the project will study using it for sending crews and cargo to the ISS and on missions not involving the ISS, particularly in orbits of substantially greater altitude than the ISS can reach.

In January 2014, the European Space Agency (ESA) agreed to be a partner on the DC4EU project, and will also investigate whether the Dream Chaser can use ESA avionics and docking mechanisms. ESA will also study launching options for the &quot;Europeanized&quot; Dream Chaser, particularly whether it can be launched from the Guiana Space Centre, within the Ariane 5&#x27;s large aerodynamic cargo fairing – or, like the Atlas V, without it. In order to fit within the fairing, the Dream Chaser&#x27;s wing length will have to be reduced slightly, which is thought to be easier than going through a full aerodynamic test program to evaluate and prove it along with the Ariane for flight without the fairing. The Ariane 5 launch vehicle was designed from its inception to be crew rated, in order to launch the Hermes Spaceplane, an ESA crewed vehicle which was proposed in the 1980s and 1990s, but was cancelled.

In late January 2014, it was announced that the Dream Chaser orbital test vehicle was under contract to be launched on an initial orbital test flight, using an Atlas V rocket, from Kennedy Space Center in November 2016. This was a privately arranged commercial agreement, and was funded directly by Sierra Nevada and was not a part of any existing NASA contract.

In September 2014, SNC announced that it would, with global partners, use the Dream Chaser as the baseline spacecraft for orbital access for a variety of programs, specializing the craft as needed.

On November 5, 2014, SNC&#x27;s Space Systems team publicly presented the challenges and opportunities related to landing the Dream Chaser spacecraft at public-use airports. Dream Chaser uses standard landing aids and non-toxic propellants that require no special handling.

===Dream Chaser for European Utilization===
On February 3, 2015, the Sierra Nevada Corporation&#x27;s (SNC) Space Systems and OHB System AG (OHB) in Germany announced the completion of the initial Dream Chaser for European Utilization (DC4EU) study. The study found that Dream Chaser is suitable for a broad range of space applications and could be used to advance European interests in space. The cooperation was renewed in April 2015 for an additional two years. 

===United Nations===
The United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA) selected the cargo Dream Chaser for its first space launch. This launch is intended to last for at least two weeks in freeflight to provide space access to United Nations member states that have no space programs of their own, and carry up to 35 payloads. The United States will pay for the mission and provide all support facilities.

<text>Fritz Klatte (28 March 1880, Diepholz – 11 February 1934) was a German chemist and the discoverer of polyvinyl acetate, with German patent (GP 281687 1912) for its preparation from acetylene gas.

Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was discovered by French physicist Henri Victor Regnault, and German physicist Eugen Baumann. Klatte designed the production process, although never successfully commercialised it. Klatte is sometimes incorrectly attributed to be the discoverer or inventor of PVC. In 1912/13, together with the chemists Emil Zacharias and Adolf Rollett, he invented the production process for polyvinyl chloride (PVC)

<doc id="1019169" wikidata="Q518654" url="?curid=1019169" title="Daisuke Asakura">
<text>is a Japanese musician, songwriter and producer who is known for his compositional work and skill at keyboards.

== Early life and career ==
Asakura&#x27;s childhood consisted of piano and electronic organ lessons, though he was expected to follow the family trade of plumbing. He started working with Yamaha keyboards and synthesizers in his early teens. Asakura began his career with a job at Yamaha right after finishing high school. While at Yamaha, Asakura worked on the EOS synthesiser, and was also featured in the instructional video for the SY77. His talent was discovered by Tetsuya Komuro of TM Network and Asakura was pulled from Yamaha to work under Komuro as his protégé. Subsequently, Asakura played the bass synthesizer during TM Network&#x27;s 1990–91 Rhythm Red tour. In 1992, Asakura met the vocalist Hiroyuki Takami and featured him in some of his solo work. The two eventually formed Access (or &quot;AXS&quot;) in 1992, after Asakura broke away from TM Network. He and Takami went on to achieve great success before splitting up in 1995.

The breakup of Access left Asakura open to pursue different projects that included composing and producing songs for new artists; one of the most successful acts he created was J-pop idol Takanori Nishikawa under the title of T.M.Revolution (also known as &quot;TMR&quot;). In the middle of 1996, Asakura started a three-man unit titled Iceman which brought Kenichi Ito (guitar) and Michihiro Kuroda (vocals) to the spotlight. After a few years, Iceman ended activity.

== Other projects ==
During and after his years with Iceman Asakura built his wealth and reputation as a composer taking after his idol and teacher, Tetsuya Komuro. He produced singles and albums for various J-Pop vocalists. He was also the featured music composer for the anime series Gravitation. Examples of Asakura&#x27;s past projects includes vocalists such as Yosuke Sakanoue, Kinya Kotani, Daichi Kuroda, Akiko Hinagata, Yuki Kimura, FayRay, Takashi Fujii and groups such as, Onapetz, Pool Bit Boys, Lazy Knack, Run&amp;Gun and The Seeker. He also composed songs for artists such as the visual kei rock band Shazna.

In 1999, Asakura and Takanori Nishikawa formed their own official two-man unit, The End of Genesis T.M.R. evolution Turbo Type D (or &quot;TMR-e&quot;, for short). They produced three singles and one album together, with Asakura performing alongside Nishikawa and appearing in their music videos. The project was officially ended in April 2000 when Nishikawa reverted to his original stage name of T.M.Revolution. Asakura is still TMR&#x27;s primary songwriter.

In 2001, Asakura produced his first solo album in five years and worked with Iceman guitarist Kenichi Ito in Mad Soldiers; a sort of comedic spin-off from Iceman in which both men&#x27;s &quot;sinister&quot; alter egos &quot;Scorpion&quot; (Asakura) and &quot;Snake&quot; (Ito) produced music for Kinya Kotani, amongst others, and performed officially unrecorded cover versions of famous songs such as &quot;Lemon Tea&quot; by Sheena &amp; The Rokkets and &quot;Hungry Like the Wolf&quot; by Duran Duran. The name of Asakura&#x27;s alter ego is a reference to his zodiac sign, Scorpio.

In 2002, he reunited with Hiroyuki Takami and reformed access.

Asakura went off on a solo project in 2004 titled &quot;Quantum Mechanics Rainbow&quot;, in which he released multiple CDs for a year, and each CD title referenced both a color and math property. The project featured multiple live performances and subsequent DVD releases. In 2006–2007, Asakura produced two singles for new J-pop idol Kimeru, hit the road with TM Network for 2007&#x27;s TMN Tribute tour and created new songs for the newest version of the popular dance-step game, &quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot;. In November 2007, access released a memory/discography book, alongside highly coveted access plushies, to commemorate their 15th anniversary. In 2012, access celebrated their 20th anniversary. In 2008, Asakura started a new solo project entitled &quot;DA Metaverse ~100 Songs for 1000 Days,&quot; in which he would release 100 new songs over the course of 1000 days exclusively through iTunes. The project was launched on June 25, 2008. In 2009 he composed and produced the soundtrack for the anime adaptation of Chrome Shelled Regios. Also in 2009, Asakura composed and arranged the soundtrack for a musical rendition of Goodbye Charlie in which Hiroyuki Takami played one of the lead roles.

Asakura has worked with J-pop artists such as Daisy x Daisy (for the opening theme song to Chrome Shelled Regios), On/Off, and May&#x27;n as a composer and/or producer. He was also featured as an MC/performer for the event concert series, &quot;Girl&#x27;s Factory&quot;, alongside Mayu Watanabe of AKB48 and various guest artists. Since 2006, Asakura has been a member of the Domoto Bros. Band on the music TV series &quot;Shin Domoto Kyoudai&quot; (&quot;New Domoto Brothers&quot;), hosted by the duo of KinKi Kids, as a keyboardist. Asakura formed a group with other musicians from the show&#x27;s band in 2009 called &quot;Sugar and the Honey Tones&quot;, and they have produced one album. Asakura and Tetsuya Komuro formed the unit PANDORA in 2017, having produced one mini album including a track featuring the artist Beverly, &quot;Be the One&quot; for the Japanese tokusatsu show Kamen Rider Build.

Asakura was featured in his own radio talk show, &quot;Neo Age Circuit&quot;, which aired every Saturday at 11pm (JST) on FM Nack5 79.5 until it ended in March 2021. His official fanclub, &quot;Smile&quot;, was temporarily the official fanclub for access until their breakup in 1995. It was active in relation to Asakura&#x27;s activities until March 2021.

<text>The Therapeutae were a religious sect which existed in Alexandria and other parts of the ancient Greek world. The primary source concerning the Therapeutae is the &quot;De vita contemplativa&quot; (&quot;The Contemplative Life&quot;), traditionally ascribed to the Jewish philosopher Philo of Alexandria (c. 20 BCE – 50 CE). The author appears to have been personally acquainted with them. The author describes the Therapeutae as &quot;philosophers&quot; (cf. I.2) and mentions a group that lived on a low hill by the Lake Mareotis close to Alexandria in circumstances resembling lavrite life (cf. III.22). They were &quot;the best&quot; of a kind given to &quot;perfect goodness&quot; that &quot;exists in many places in the inhabited world&quot; (cf. III.21). The author was unsure of the origin of the name and derives the name Therapeutae/Therapeutides from Greek θεραπεύω in the sense of &quot;cure&quot; or &quot;worship&quot; (cf. I.2).

Philo&#x27;s description of the doctrines and practices of the Therapeutae leaves great ambiguity about what religion they are associated with.

==Name==

The term &quot;Therapeutae&quot; (plural) is Latin, from Philo&#x27;s Greek plural &quot;Therapeutai&quot; (Θεραπευταί). The term therapeutes means one who is attendant to the gods although the term, and the related adjective &quot;therapeutikos&quot; carry in later texts the meaning of attending to heal, or treating in a spiritual or medical sense. The Greek feminine plural &quot;Therapeutrides&quot; (Θεραπευτρίδες) is sometimes encountered for their female members. The term &quot;therapeutae&quot; may occur in relation to followers of Asclepius at Pergamon, and &quot;therapeutai&quot; may also occur in relation to worshippers of Sarapis in inscriptions, such as on Delos.

== &quot;De vita contemplativa&quot; account ==
Philo described the Therapeutae in &quot;De vita contemplativa&quot; (&quot;On the contemplative life&quot;), written in the first century CE. The origins of the Therapeutae were unclear, and Philo was even unsure about the etymology of their name, which he explained as meaning either physicians of souls or servants of God. The opening phrases of his essay establish that it followed one that has been lost, on the active life. Philo was employing the familiar polarity in Hellenic philosophy between the active and the contemplative life, exemplifying the active life by the Essenes, another severely ascetic sect, and the contemplative life by the desert-dwelling Therapeutae.

According to &quot;De Vita Contemplativa&quot;, the Therapeutae were widely distributed in the Ancient world, among the Greeks and beyond in the non-Greek world of the &quot;barbarians&quot;, with one of their major gathering points being in Alexandria, in the area of the Lake Mareotis:

=== Teachings and lifestyle ===

====Temperance and simplicity====
They lived chastely with utter simplicity; they &quot;first of all laid down temperance as a sort of foundation for the soul to rest upon, proceed to build up other virtues on this foundation&quot; (Philo). They renounced property and followed severe discipline:
====Six days per week of solitude, meeting on seventh day, with teaching and hymns====
They were dedicated to the contemplative life, and their activities for six days of the week consisted of ascetic practices, fasting, solitary prayers and the study of the scriptures in their isolated cells, each with its separate holy sanctuary, and enclosed courtyard:

On the seventh day the Therapeutae met in a meeting house, the men on one side of an open partition, and the women on the other, to hear discourses. Once in seven weeks they meet for a night-long vigil after a banquet where they served one another, for &quot;they are not waited on by slaves, because they deem any possession of servants whatever to be contrary to nature. For she has begotten all men alike free&quot; (&quot;De Vita Contemplativa&quot;, para.70) and sing antiphonal hymns until dawn.

==Testament of Job==
The pseudepigraphic &quot;Testament of Job&quot; is seen as possibly a Therapeutae text.

==Early Christian interpretations==
The 3rd-century Christian writer Eusebius of Caesarea (c. 263–339), in his &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot;, identified Philo&#x27;s Therapeutae as the first Christian monks, identifying their renunciation of property, chastity, fasting, and solitary lives with the cenobitic ideal of the Christian monks.

The 4th-century Christian heresiologist Epiphanius of Salamis (c. 315–403), bishop of Salamis in Cyprus, author of the &quot;Panarion,&quot; or &quot;Medicine Chest against Heresies&quot;, misidentified Philo&#x27;s Therapeuate as &quot;Jessaens&quot; and considered them a Christian group.

The 5th-century Christian writer Pseudo-Dionysius, following Philo, interprets that &quot;Some people gave to the ascetics the name &#x27;Therapeutae&#x27; or servants while some others gave them the name monks&quot;. Pseudo-Dionysius interprets Philo&#x27;s group as a highly organized Christian ascetic order, and the meaning of the name &quot;Therapeutae&quot; as &quot;servants&quot;.

== Theory of Buddhist influence ==
Some authors have pointed out similarities between the Therapeutae and early Buddhist monasticism, a tradition that is several centuries older. As described in the 1st century CE text &quot;Periplus of the Erythraean Sea&quot;, Egypt had intense trade and cultural contacts with India during the period which, combined with evidence in the Indian Edicts of Ashoka of Buddhist missionary activity to the Mediterranean around 250 BCE, has led to the hypothesis that Therapeutae might have been a Buddhist sect composed of descendants of Ashoka&#x27;s emissaries.

Linguist Zacharias P. Thundy suggests that the word &quot;Therapeutae&quot; may represent a Hellenistic corruption of &quot;Theravada&quot;, the Indian Pali word for traditional Buddhists.

<text>The Blantyre mining disaster, which happened on the morning of 22 October 1877, in Blantyre, Scotland, was Scotland&#x27;s worst ever mining accident. Pits No. 2 and No. 3 of William Dixon&#x27;s Blantyre Colliery were the site of an explosion which killed 207 miners, possibly more, with the youngest being a boy of 11. It was known that firedamp was present in the pit and it is likely that this was ignited by a naked flame. The accident left 92 widows and 250 fatherless children.

Blantyre was also the scene of two further disasters in 1878 and 1879. There was a succession of lesser fatalities, some of which—particularly in the earlier years—were caused by firedamp.

==Background==
===Seams===
The Lanarkshire coalfield in the vicinity of Blantyre had three seams of coal being worked in the 1870s. They were the ell coal, thick at ; the main coal, thick at and the splint coal, thick at . Precise depths vary with the elevation of the top of the various shafts.

The Blantyre colliery had five shafts:
* No. 1, by working the ell and main coals.
* No. 2. by working the splint coal.
* No. 3. by working the splint coal.
* No. 4. by working the splint coal. At the time of the explosion No. 4 had not yet connected with the rest of the colliery.
* No. 5. diameter used as the upcast for numbers 1, 2 and 3.

Numbers 2 and 5 shafts were close to each other, within . Number 3 shaft was away. Number 1 shaft was between the two but only reached the ell and main coals. &quot;Blind pits&quot;, that is shafts that do not extend to the surface, connected the ell and main coals to the splint coal. The main coal ceased to be worked in November 1878 and the passages from shaft 1 bricked up. Shaft 1 continued to work the ell coal.

Four main districts were formed in the splint coal:
*A smaller area with workings to the north and south of number 3 pit.
*An area lying in the north-west quadrant from number 2 pit.
*An area lying in the south-west quadrant from number 2 pit.
*An area lying in the south east quadrant from number 2 pit close to, and in communication with, the workings from number 3 pit.

Conditions in the mine were held to be poor by the colliers. The previous year the miners had sought a wage rise to compensate for the poor safety and been refused. They went on strike and were immediately sacked. Since the miners lived in tied cottages they were therefore evicted by force. The mine owners then brought in Irish Catholics to work the mine.

===Workings===
Most of the coal was worked using the Newcastle system, also known as &quot;pillar and stall&quot; or &quot;stoop and room&quot;. A heading was driven into the coal and at intervals along it rooms were excavated, around wide. As the rooms got deeper another heading was driven from room to room to leave pillars (or stoops) about square behind. During this stage only around 30% of the coal was extracted. Eventually the whole district consisted of a grid pattern of passageways around stoops. The final stage in extraction was &quot;stooping&quot;. The furthermost roof was supported by pit props and the stoops removed. Once a complete row of stoops had gone the props were removed from the furthest part which would collapse into the space (&quot;goaf&quot; or &quot;gove&quot;) behind. During this process settlement and fracturing of the roof and seams above could occur, potentially releasing larger quantities of gas.

The alternative method of working the coal was the longwall system. Two headers were driven forward to the far end of the district and an interconnecting passageway excavated. The passageway was supported by props and the long wall on the shaft side of the passage excavated. As this wall retreated the roof was propped and the furthermost props removed, allowing the overburden to collapse into the goaf. With longwall the same fracturing and gas release that stooping could cause was always present.

The ell coal was mainly worked by stoop and room, with longwall in the southern part only. The main was exclusively worked by longwall and the splint (apart from a trial section) worked by stoop and room.

===Ventilation===
In collieries at that time air circulation was induced by a furnace at the base of the upcast pit. Hot air rising up the pit, as if up a chimney, drew the exhausted and contaminated air out of the galleries. Downcast pits let the fresh air in to replace it. The route the air took was carefully controlled by doors and partitions. At Blantyre pit, number 5 was the upcast shaft for pits 1, 2 and 3. About 5 tons of coal were burnt per day in two out of three grates, each by .

Air for the ell coal was drawn down pit number 1. At the base it split north and south then after passing around the respective parts of the workings it was led to the upcast pit.

Ventilation in the splint coal was more complex. Air from number 3 pit was split in two and passed along the north and south levels. After passing through the respective workings the two currents passed through the north and south headings before recombining on the &quot;rise&quot; (west) side and passing into the workings of number 2 pit. On average the air circuit was in number 3 pit.

Air was drawn down number 2 and split in two. The larger portion went north, circulated around the north-west workings for before returning to the upcast pit. The smaller part was led to the south, circulated around the south-western area for and then back to the upcast. The air from number 3 pit entered the workings associated with number 2 pit in the east and circulated around number 2 pit&#x27;s south-eastern portion before finally reaching the upcast. The air circuit at might not be considered excessive, but when both pits are added the total circuit was . After the disaster this policy of using the air from number 3 workings to ventilate number 2 workings was roundly condemned in the trade press: &quot;It is a very dangerous system, and should be abandoned at once&quot;.

==Disaster==

===Explosion===

On the morning of 22 October 1877 nothing was thought to be amiss. The officials seemed to think that the workings were in their normal state. At 04:40 four firemen inspected number 2 pit. At 05:30 the regular workmen started to descend. The firemen assured the workers all was well and ascended to sign reports and have breakfast. Having received these assurances the workforce went about their various tasks.

At around 09:00 a blast was heard on the surface and flame and steam rushed up number 3 pit for a few minutes. Smoke was seen from the upcast pit and air came from number 2. Nothing was seen from number 1 pit, but below ground the miners felt the blast and at once ascended. The smoke was seen in the surrounding area so miners and managers hurried to the pithead. Shortly after 10:00 the Inspector of Mines, Mr Moore, and the Assistant Inspector, Mr Robson, were alerted by telegraph. They arrived at the colliery at noon.

===Rescue attempts===

Number 3 pit was blocked by debris falling from the damaged shaft and by tubs and similar being blown up the shaft. The cages and ropes had been damaged, so an attempt at descending was made in a &quot;kettle&quot;, basically a large bucket. Air was still travelling down the shaft and voices could be heard at the bottom, below the blockage. Number 2 pit was relatively undamaged; normal winding operations could continue. Moore, Robson and some engineers went down number 2 pit but were stopped by falls and afterdamp. The route to number 3 pit (&quot;More&#x27;s dook&quot;) appeared to be free of falls but was full of chokedamp.

A brattice was constructed to divert the air passing from number 3 pit directly to the upcast, and by this means More&#x27;s dook became passable by 22:00. Four survivors were found, all badly injured. One of them, a boy, died shortly afterwards. The remaining three were brought to the surface through number 2 pit and sent to Glasgow Infirmary, but all died within the month. Rescue parties explored number 3 pit as far as they could, but were limited by chokedamp and firedamp. Seventeen bodies were found and brought to the foot of the blocked number 3 shaft for later retrieval. The shaft was unstable, and if it closed up the rescuers would be deprived of air so they retreated until the shaft could be secured from above. All hope of finding more survivors was abandoned.

===Recovery phase===

The following day, Tuesday 23 October, an underground engine at the upcast was adapted to assist the ventilation. The slide valve was removed and steam sent down. The escaping hot steam rising up the upcast drew the air around the mine in the same way that the furnaces would. By this means 70% of the normal air supply was restored and recovery work could commence. All the men in the northern part of the colliery had left their work and headed for number 2 pit, only to be overcome by chokedamp before reaching safety. Ventilation continued until Saturday 27 when the debris at the foot of number 3 shaft could be cleared. By Sunday the first bodies could be brought up number 3 shaft, but it was not until Thursday 1 November that the mine was free of gas and recovery could be carried on from both downcast pits.

===Investigation===
The investigations commenced as soon as the air was safe. Significant damage had been done in both the number 2 and number 3 workings, though particularly in number 3 pit. Damage in number 2 pit was mainly in the south eastern part, that in communication with, and ventilated from, pit 3. This was the area where stooping was occurring, so that the place most likely to be liberating firedamp was being ventilated with firedamp laden air from number 3 pit. The official report notes that naked flames and blasting were allowed throughout the colliery, except in the area around the stooping. Near there no blasting was permitted and all lamps had to be &quot;gauze lamps&quot;.

The report states: &quot;These gauze or safety lamps were not Davy lamps, but of a kind in common use throughout Scotland. They are much larger than the Davy lamp and give a better light. Mr Moore [the lead inspector] has frequently tested them in gas, and on no occasion has the gas been exploded outside&quot;. Lupton, writing 15 years later, inveighs against modifications to the Davy lamp including: &quot;The larger the lamp the greater the force of the explosion, and if the lamp were too large, the explosion would force the flame through the gauze; for that reason the diameter of the gauze must never be larger than 1 inch&quot;. In addition, the Blantyre explosion was before Trimdon Grange (1882) and the Bedford Colliery Disaster of 1886 and so the shielding of gauzes from direct currents of air had not yet been introduced. Notwithstanding Moore&#x27;s claims for the Scottish safety lamp, the report&#x27;s conclusions call for the banning of naked lights and the introduction of locked Davy lamps which &quot;are better than the present safety lamps&quot;.

The report also roundly criticises poor discipline (including shots being fired by unauthorised workers), poor ventilation around old or incomplete stoops and the whole method of ventilating one pit from another. The report does not come to a firm conclusion about how the explosion started.

===Aftermath===
It is reported that, six months after the accident, Dixon&#x27;s raised summonses against 34 widows whose husbands had been killed and who had not left the tied cottages which they and their husbands had rented from the mining company. They were evicted two weeks later, on 28 May 1878.

==Further incidents==
===1878 lift crash===
On 5 March 1878 at No. 3 Pit, six men were killed when the cage they were in was drawn up past the top of the pit and into the pithead wheels. The cage was wrecked and overturned, throwing six men to the bottom of the shaft. A seventh man (James Gerrity) managed to hold on until he was assisted down and, apart from being shaken, was unhurt.

At the time of the accident, Mr J T Robson (Assistant Government Inspector for the district) and Mr Robert Robson (his assistant) were in the colliery office with Mr Watson, the manager. Robert Robson descended number 2 pit and went to the bottom of the number 3 shaft to supervise the recovery of the bodies from a flooded sump. Meanwhile, several men descended number 3 pit in a &quot;kettle&quot; to examine the shaft for damage. The shaft itself being undamaged, the bodies were recovered that way.

The engine keeper, Arthur Cleland, stated that &quot;something had gone wrong&quot; with the indicator to the colliery engineer, James Patterson, was in the vicinity at the time of the accident. Patterson examined the indicator which showed the cage&#x27;s position and found it registered from the pit head, about a quarter of the shaft&#x27;s total depth. Cleland was advised to stay but left shortly afterwards. After going home to clean up and change Cleland was observed heading across the fields towards Glasgow but was overtaken by a policeman and arrested. After helping down Gerrity, Patterson had returned to the engine house and seen that the indicator now showed although the cage had not moved in the meantime.

Cleland was charged with culpable homicide and tried at the High Court in Glasgow on 24 April. At the trial Patterson said that when he touched the indicator it was &quot;very loose. He had never noticed it so loose before&quot;. Two engineers called for the defence at the trial also criticised the method of attaching the indicator as &quot;not proper&quot; and &quot;not ... to be the best mode known to engineers&quot;. Michael Flanagan, a furnaceman at the pithead, reported that Cleland said &quot;the indicator was wrong&quot; and Flanagan observed that the indicator was further down than it should have been. The manager, Watson, admitted under cross-examination that it was the duty of the oversman to examine the indicator but he did not do so. Most witnesses also gave Cleland a good character reference. After a short retirement, the jury returned a verdict of not proven.

===1879 explosion===
The 1879 disaster occurred in the ell coal, the shallowest of the three seams. The coal was worked from number 1 pit which was the downcast. There was a &quot;blind pit&quot; down to the main coal, which was no longer being worked, and a communication mine down to the splint coal at the foot of pit number 3. Air came down number 1 pit and the current was split to ventilate the north and south workings respectively. The south current passed along the south level for to the southern extremity. It passed through the longwall workings there and returned via the older stoop and room workings before joining the north current return and passing up the upcast, number 5 pit. The inspectors report concluded &quot;1 That the arrangements for the ventillation of this pit were sufficient, and that the quantity of air sent in was ample under ordinary conditions&quot;.

Although the owners banned the men from opening lamps or from taking smoking materials below ground, several prosecutions had occurred for breaches of the rules. The last such was the day before the explosion when a miner was fined £2 () for opening his lamp.

The explosion was first noticed on the surface as a &quot;sharp retort&quot; at 21:00 on Wednesday 2 July 1879. Once John White, the oversman, had been summoned an attempt was made to lower the cage, but it stuck. White then descended number 3 pit and found that the men there were unaware of the explosion. He, a group of men, and shortly afterwards Mr Watson (the manager) proceeded up the communication mine into number 1 pit&#x27;s workings. Parties descended the blind pit into the main coal and other parties searched the north workings and both reported all was well. Exploration of the south workings was stopped by falls and afterdamp. Various attempts were made to recover the bodies during the Thursday, but it was 04:00 on Friday before the whole workings could be reached and recovery completed.

Not all the safety lamps were found; however, one was found that was unlocked. Smoking materials including matches were found in the clothes of the deceased, one man was found with a half full pipe in his hand. Several men had unofficial (and therefore illegal) lamp-keys on them. In the immediate vicinity of the seat of the explosion little burning was seen, the supposition was that a firedamp explosion had raised dust in the passageways and the coal dust had exploded. The official investigation tentatively suggested that shot firing had displaced the gas towards the area where men were smoking and that a naked flame there triggered off the explosion.

===Memorial===

The mine owner erected a 5.5-metre-tall granite monument to mark the two explosion disasters. An engraved dedication reads: &quot;William Dixon Ltd—in memory of 240 of their workmen who were killed by explosions in Blantyre Colliery on 22 October 1877 and 2 July 1879 and many of whom are buried here&quot;. There is also a memorial to the Catholic miners killed in the disaster of October 1877 which is located in Dalbeath Cemetery, London Road, Glasgow. In addition a memorial commemorating the centenary is located at Blantyre Cross, Blantyre. An incomplete list of the deaths is given in .

===Music===
Irish folk artist Christy Moore recorded a song called &quot;Blantyre Explosion&quot;. It appears on his 1985 album &quot;Ordinary Man&quot;. It had previously been recorded by Ewan MacColl and Dick Gaughan. The exact origin of the song is unknown, but it is thought to have been collected by A. L. Lloyd from an unnamed local singer. The text first appears in LLoyd&#x27;s 1951 book &quot;coaldust ballads&quot;.

<text>The Right Honourable the Lord Mayor of Sydney is the head of the Council of the City of Sydney, which is the local government area covering the central business district of Sydney in the State of New South Wales, Australia. The Lord Mayor has been directly elected since 1995, replacing the previous system of being internally elected annually by the Councillors, and serves a four-year term. The most recent election was held on 14 September 2024, at which the incumbent Lord Mayor, Clover Moore, was re-elected to a sixth term. The Lord Mayor is assisted in their work by a Deputy Lord Mayor, who is elected on an annual basis by the elected councillors.

==Office history==
The office of the Mayor of Sydney along with the City of Sydney was created on 20 July 1842 pursuant to the &quot;Sydney City Incorporation Act 1842&quot; by Governor Sir George Gipps. Prior to the first municipal election, the governor nominated magistrate Charles Windeyer to serve as interim mayor. The first council, consisting of 24 aldermen elected across six wards, was declared elected on 3 November 1842 and first met in the George Street Market Building (now the site of the Queen Victoria Building) on 9 November and elected John Hosking as the first elected mayor of Sydney.

The title of Mayor (in full: &quot;The Right Worshipful the Mayor&quot;) was elevated to &quot;Lord Mayor&quot; on 23 November 1902 by King Edward VII, and as part of this process received the honorific &quot;The Right Honourable&quot;, a title which attaches to the title of Lord Mayor and not to the individual holding the office. In December 1915, the Parliament of New South Wales passed the &quot;Sydney Corporation (Election of Mayor) Act, 1915&quot; which amended the 1902 act to allow for the governor to appoint the lord mayor should the council be unable to elect a candidate on or before 30 December of any year. This occurred three times, in 1916, 1920 and 1934.

The office of lord mayor, along with the City of Sydney, was governed by the &quot;Sydney Corporation Act, 1932&quot; until the passing of the &quot;Local Government (Areas) Act 1948&quot;, which placed Sydney under the terms of the &quot;Local Government Act 1919&quot;, which governed all other local governments in the state. This meant that the election of lord mayor (until 1971 in December of each year, and then in September) marked the beginning of the term, instead of the previous system, where the lord mayoral term began on 1 January and expired on 31 December. When the &quot;City of Sydney Act 1988&quot; was passed, the City of Sydney was once again governed under a separate law, but the election of lord mayor did not change until the &quot;Local Government Legislation Amendment Act 1995&quot;, which allowed for popular direct elections from 1995.

===Vestments of office===
As head of the council, the lord mayor is entitled to wear the chains and robes of office, as befitting the ancient status of lord mayor of a large city. In 1902 the Sydney Chamber of Commerce commissioned the first link of a mayoral chain. In 1903, the governor of New South Wales, Sir Harry Rawson presented the first lord mayor, Thomas Hughes, with the chain of office. It features the coat of arms of the Sydney Chamber of Commerce and the Stock Exchange and a pendant depicting the coat of arms of Sydney. Successive mayors each added a medallion, on which was embossed their term of office. By 1945, this practice had ended because of the size and weight of the chain. Today, the chain is worn with the robes of office only for rare civic ceremonies, a smaller collar being worn for most civic duties.

The original civic robe for the mayor of Sydney in 1842 was purple, trimmed with ermine and worn with a court dress hat. The current robes worn by the lord mayor and deputy lord mayor are black, trimmed with ermine, and worn with bicorne hat, lace jabot and white gloves. They are worn rarely and only at major civic functions. Recently, it has become the custom not to wear the robes.

==List of town clerks, general managers, and chief executive officers==
The first Town Clerk of Sydney was appointed on 3 September 1842 on a provisional basis by the Governor, pending the election of aldermen. When the council was dismissed in December 1853 and replaced by a board of three commissioners, the post of town clerk was left vacant. The &quot;Local Government Act, 1993&quot; removed the requirement that the administrative head of a council be a &quot;Town or Shire Clerk&quot; and specified that the head was to be known as the general manager. The Sydney City Council had previously recognised the changing nature of role in appointing their first general manager in December 1992. In May 2005, the title of general manager was changed to chief executive officer (CEO).

==Election results==
In 1995, the &quot;Local Government Legislation Amendment Act 1995&quot; amended the &quot;City of Sydney Act 1988&quot;, to allow for popular direct elections of the Lord Mayor from September 1995.

<text>OCBC Bank (Hong Kong) Limited, formerly Wing Hang Bank Limited and OCBC Wing Hang Bank Limited, is a licensed bank with its head office in Hong Kong. Since 15 October 2014, Wing Hang Bank has been a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation (OCBC) headquartered in Singapore. The acquisition of Wing Hang has given OCBC a network of about seventy branches spanning Hong Kong, Macau and mainland China to add to OCBC&#x27;s existing operations in Hong Kong and China.

== History ==

Y K Fung established Wing Hang Ngan Ho in 1937 in Guangdong to engage in money changing. Its early years were difficult due to the turbulent political and economic conditions in China. In 1941, the firm established a subsidiary, Banco Weng Hang, in Macau.

In 1945, Wing Hang Ngan Ho re-established itself in Hong Kong with a capital of HK$300,000 and a staff of nineteen. The firm prospered during the post-war boom and was incorporated in 1960 as Wing Hang Bank.

In 1973, the Irving Trust Company of New York acquired a majority interest in Wing Hang. In 1979, the Head Office Building was re-developed to provide modern facilities for its operations.

In 1988, the Bank of New York merged with Irving Bank Corporation after a year-long takeover bid by the Bank of New York. In July 1993, Wing Hang Bank listed its shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. In August 2004, Wing Hang completed the merger with Chekiang First Bank. In January 2007, the bank acquired Inchroy Credit Corporation, a major financial institution engaged in the hire purchase and lease financing business.

In July 2007, The Bank of New York Company Inc. merged with Mellon Financial Corporation to form The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation. That same year, Wing Hang established Wing Hang Bank (China).

===Acquisition by OCBC===

Singapore&#x27;s OCBC Bank acquired Wing Hang in 2014 for S$6.23 billion. Under the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance, OCBC Bank, with 97.52 percent of Wing Hang&#x27;s shares, compulsorily acquired the bank on 29 July 2014. OCBC Wing Hang was subsequently delisted after the acquisition was completed.

On 1 October 2014, Wing Hang Bank was re-branded as OCBC Wing Hang to reflect its integration into the OCBC family. On 3 July 2023, OCBC unveiled a unified brand across its core markets, including Hong Kong and Macau, solidifying OCBC&#x27;s One Group approach to capitalize on the ASEAN-Greater China opportunity. In Hong Kong, &quot;OCBC Wing Hang Bank Limited&quot; has changed its name to &quot;OCBC Bank (Hong Kong) Limited&quot; and in Macau, &quot;Banco OCBC Weng Hang, S.A.&quot; has changed its name to &quot;Banco OCBC (Macau), S.A.&quot;. &quot;Wing Hang&quot; is no longer in the legal names of both OCBC&#x27;s Hong Kong and Macau subsidiaries.

OCBC has also launched a new unified logo for its banking entities. The logo retains the classic Chinese junk ship, which has been featured in every iteration of its logo since the bank was founded in 1932. The bank has also launched a new tagline: For now, and beyond (心所向, 行致远 / 心所向, 行致遠).

<doc id="1019188" wikidata="Q8021247" url="?curid=1019188" title="Williamson amplifier">
<text>The Williamson amplifier is a four-stage, push-pull, Class A triode-output valve audio power amplifier designed by D. T. N. Williamson during World War II. The original circuit, published in 1947 and addressed to the worldwide do it yourself community, set the standard of high fidelity sound reproduction and served as a benchmark or reference amplifier design throughout the 1950s. The original circuit was copied by hundreds of thousands amateurs worldwide. It was an absolute favourite on the DIY scene of the 1950s, and in the beginning of the decade also dominated British and North American markets for factory-assembled amplifiers.

The Williamson circuit was based on the 1934 &quot;Wireless World Quality Amplifier&quot; by Walter Cocking, with an additional error amplifier stage and a global negative feedback loop. Deep feedback, triode-connected KT66 power tetrodes, conservative choice of standing currents, and the use of wide-bandwidth output transformer all contributed to the performance of the Williamson. It had a modest output power rating of but surpassed all contemporary designs in having very low harmonic distortion and intermodulation, flat frequency response throughout the audible frequency range, and effective damping of loudspeaker resonances. The 0.1% distortion figure of the Williamson amplifier became the criterion for high fidelity performance that remains valid in the 21st century.

The Williamson amplifier was sensitive to selection and matching of passive components and valves, and prone to unwanted oscillations at infrasonic and ultrasonic frequencies. Enclosing four valve stages and an output transformer in a negative feedback loop was a severe test of design, resulting in a very narrow phase margin or, quite often, no margin at all. Attempts to improve stability of the Williamson could not fix this fundamental flaw. For this reason, and due to high costs of required quality components, manufacturers soon abandoned the Williamson circuit in favour of inherently more stable, cheaper and efficient three-stage, ultralinear or pentode-output designs.

== Background ==
In 1925 Edward W. Kellogg published the first comprehensive theory of audio power amplifier design. Kellogg proposed that the permissible level of harmonic distortion can reach 5%, provided that distortion rises smoothly rather than abruptly, and that it generates only low-order harmonics. Kellogg&#x27;s work became the de facto industry standard of the interwar period, when most amplifiers were employed in cinemas. Early sound film and public address requirements were low, and customers were content with crude but efficient and affordable transformer-coupled, class B amplifiers. The best theatre amplifiers, built by Western Electric around their 300A and 300B power triodes, far exceeded the average level but were expensive and rare.

By the middle of the 1930s Western Electric and RCA improved performance of their experimental audio equipment to a level approaching modern understanding of high fidelity, but none of these systems could be commercialized yet. They lacked sound &quot;sources&quot; of matching quality. Industry leaders of the 1930s agreed that the improvement of commercial amplifiers and loudspeakers would make sense only after the introduction of new physical media surpassing low-quality AM broadcasting and shellac records. The Great Depression, World War II and the post-war television boomconsecutively delayed this goal. Development of commercial audio equipment came to a standstill; the few enthusiasts seeking higher level of fidelity had to literally do it themselves. American DIYers experimented with novel beam tetrodes. Australians preferred traditional push-pull circuits built around directly-heated triodes and complex, expensive interstage transformers.

British school of thought led by Walter Cocking of &quot;Wireless World&quot; leaned to push-pull, class A, RC-coupled triode output stages. RC coupling, as opposed to transformer coupling, argued Cocking, extended the amplifier&#x27;s bandwidth beyond the required minimum of 10 kHz and improved its transient response. Tetrodes and pentodes were undesirable due to higher harmonic distortion and higher output impedance that failed to control fundamental resonance of the loudspeaker. Cocking wrote that Kellogg&#x27;s 5% distortion limit was too high for quality amplification, and outlined a different set of requirements - the first definition of high fidelity. Instead of Kellogg&#x27;s single figure of merit (harmonic distortion), Cocking set three simultaneous targets - low frequency distortion, low harmonic distortion, and low phase distortion. In 1934 Cocking published his first &quot;Quality Amplifier&quot; design - a two-stage, RC-coupled triode class A amplifier that achieved no more than 2–3% maximum distortion without using feedback. Feedback appeared in his 1943 &quot;Wartime Quality Amplifier&quot;, built around American 6V6 beam tetrodes; however, both the input stage and the output transformer were placed outside the feedback loop. Cocking&#x27;s &quot;Quality Amplifier&quot; family became the foundation of post-war British and Australian audio industry, including the Williamson amplifier.

== Development ==
In 1943, in the middle of World War II, twenty-year-old Scotsman Theo Williamson failed mathematics exam and was discharged from the University of Edinburgh. Theo was not physically fit for military service, so instead the authorities drafted him for mandatory civilian work at Marconi-Osram Valve. In April 1944 Williamson transferred from production line to Applications Laboratory of the company, where he had enough free time for his own DIY projects. Management did not object, and by the end of 1944 Williamson had conceived, built and tested the amplifier that would soon be known as the &quot;Williamson amplifier&quot;. Another wartime projects, a novel magnetic cartridge, would be commercialized in 1948 as the Ferranti ribbon pickup.

=== Design targets ===
Following Cocking&#x27;s ideas, Williamson devised a different, much stricter set of fidelity requirements:
# Negligible non-linear distortion (sum of harmonic distortion and intermodulation products) up to the maximum rated output, at all audible frequencies from 10 to 20000 Hz;
# Linear frequency response and constant output power at all audible frequencies;
# Negligible phase shift within the audible frequency range;
# Good transient response which, in addition to above frequency and phase requirements, demands perfectly constant gain when handling complex waveforms and transients;
# Low output impedance and, inversely, high damping factor. At the very least, output impedance of an amplifier must be lower than the loudspeaker impedance;
# Output power of 15–20W for reproduction of orchestral music via a dynamic loudspeaker, or for a horn loudspeaker.

Williamson reviewed contemporary amplifier configurations, and, just like Cocking, settled on a low distortion push-pull, class A, triode output stage. Unlike Cocking, Williamson believed that such a stage can deliver high fidelity sound only when the amplifier is governed by 20–30dB deep negative feedback loop (and thus the complete amplifier must have 20–30dB higher open loop gain to compensate the effect of feedback). Deep feedback inevitably causes sudden, harsh onset of distortion at overload but Williamson was content with this flaw. He argued that it is a price worth paying for an improvement in linearity at medium and high power levels. On the contrary, wrote Williamson, slow but steady rise of distortion to 3–5%, as advocated by Kellogg, is distinctly unwanted in a high fidelity system.

=== Prototypes and tests ===

Valve complement of the original Williamson amplifier was determined by scarce supply in wartime Britain. The two suitable and available output valves were either the PX25 triode, or a triode-connected KT66 beam tetrode. Williamson initially used the PX25, an already obsolete directly-heated triode introduced in 1932. In his second prototype, Williamson used the more efficient KT66, which became the valve of choice in post-war period. Powered from +500 V power supply, the KT66 prototype delivered 20 Watts at no more than 0.1% distortion. A less costly +425V power supply enabled 15 Watt output power at no more than 0.1% distortion; this arrangement became standard for the Williamson amplifier and defined its physical layout. The complete prototype system, including the amplifier, the experimental magnetic pickup and a Goodmans full-range speaker in an acoustical labyrinth enclosure, has proven to Williamson that a low distortion, deep feedback amplifier, indeed, sounded superior to amplifiers without feedback. The difference was particularly audible with the best available shellac records, despite the physical limitations of this low-fidelity format.

The prototypes impressed the Marconi management, who granted Williamson unlimited access to the company&#x27;s test facilities and introduced him to the people from Decca Records. The latter provided Williamson with precious, exclusive test material - sample records of the experimental Decca ffrr system, the first true high fidelity medium in the United Kingdom. These records, which exceeded any preexisting media in sound quality, helped Williamson with fine-tuning his prototypes. He was certain that he was now firmly on the right track, but neither Marconi, nor its parent the General Electric Company were willing to invest in mass production of amplifiers for the civilian market. The design was not interesting to company lawyers either, because it did not contain anything patentable. Williamson merely put together well-known circuits and solutions.

=== Publication ===

In February 1946 Williamson left Marconi, moved to Edinburgh and joined Ferranti. A few months later a senior Marconi salesman, who sought new means of promoting the KT66 to general public, noticed Williamson&#x27;s 1944 report about his amplifier prototypes, and sent it for publication to &quot;Wireless World&quot;. Chief editor H. F. Smith knew Williamson for his earlier contributions; he contacted the author directly and requested a detailed article written specifically for the DIY readers. Williamson promptly responded, but for unknown reasons the publication, originally slotted for 1946, was delayed until April–May 1947. While the paper was waiting for print, the magazine had published the new version of Cocking&#x27;s &quot;Quality amplifier&quot;. Cocking, as the technical editor of &quot;Wireless World&quot;, certainly had precedence; according to Peter Stinson, he was sceptical about the Williamson amplifier, believing that his own design needed no further improvements.

By 1947 British industry had already released two amplifiers of comparable sound quality. Harold Leak announced production of his Leak Point One in September 1945;
 later in the same year Peter Walker published the first sketch of his distributed-load output stage that would become the Quad II production model. Leak and Walker tried to commercialize their ideas on the meagre post-war British market; their achievements were practically unknown outside of the United Kingdom. Williamson did the opposite: he donated his design to worldwide DIY community, thus securing lasting popular following.

In August 1949 Williamson, responding to letters from the readers, published the &quot;New Version&quot; of this amplifier. The article dealt extensively with construction, tuning and troubleshooting issues, however, its main objective was to address stability issues reported in letters from the readers. Apart from the additional frequency compensation network, a biasing potentiometer and a new, indirectly-heated rectifier valve that was not available in 1947, the circuit remained the same. In October 1949 – January 1950 and May 1952 Williamson published a series of articles on matching preamplifier stages and brief &quot;Replies to Queries&quot; concerning assembly and testing. A collection of articles published by Williamson in 1947–1950 was printed as a standalone 36-page brochure in 1952, with a second edition in 1953. The Williamson amplifier itself, as described in the August 1949 issue of &quot;Wireless World&quot;, remained unchanged.

=== Reception ===

The Williamson amplifier was an instant success. The publication coincided with the resumption of television broadcasting, the beginning of FM broadcasting, the release of the first high fidelity gramophone records (Decca &quot;ffrr&quot; and the LP record), and the &quot;discovery&quot; of the captured German &quot;Magnetophon&quot;. The high fidelity media that did not exist in the 1930s became a reality, and the public wanted playback equipment of matching quality. Off-the-shelf amplifiers available in 1947 were not fit for the task. At the same time, electronic components markets were flooded with military surplus, including cheap American 6L6 and 807 power valves. For a while, DIY construction was the only way to obtain high fidelity amplification. Thousands of amateurs began copying the Williamson design; the required transformers and chassis were soon provided by industry.

In September 1947 Australians R. H. Astor and Fritz Langford-Smith adapted the Williamson circuit for American 6SN7 and 807 valves; a 6L6 variant followed soon. British and Australian press was unanimously enthusiastic: &quot;by far the best we have ever tested ... extraordinary linearity and lack of harmonic and intermodulation distortion&quot;, &quot;amplifier to end [all] amplifiers&quot;, &quot;absolute tops for obtaining natural reproduction&quot; and so on. America lagged behind by about two years: first reviews appeared in the second half of 1949, and were just as complimentary. American companies adapted the circuit to locally available components, and soon began importing &quot;premium&quot; British valves and transformers, thus launching the market for British hi-fi in the United States. By the end of 1949 the Williamson amplifier became a universally recognized reference design, and a starting point for all valve designs employing global feedback.

The spread of DIY construction and the abundance of publications addressed to the amateurs had a solid economic reason: factory-made electronics of the 1940s were too expensive. The industry has not yet reorganized for mass production of affordable consumer products. Home construction of valve electronics was relatively simple and promised considerable savings. The number of home-made Williamson amplifiers is estimated at least in hundreds of thousands; they absolutely dominated the DIY scene in English-speaking countries. Stereo has not been commercialized yet; almost all surviving Williamson amplifiers are monaural. Each one differs in minor details, assembly quality is usually inferior to factory-made models. In the 21st century these monaural amplifiers are commonly sold at online auctions, but finding a matching pair is almost impossible.

Small-scale factory production in the United Kingdom began in February 1948; first big manufacturer, Rogers, announced production in October 1948. In the early 1950s the Williamson amplifier dominated factory production in both the United Kingdom and the United States; John Frieborn of Radio-Electronics wrote in 1953 that &quot;since Williamson published the first description of his &quot;High-Quality Audio Amplifier&quot;, other audio designers had two apparent choices, beating him [Williamson] or joining him.&quot;

=== Topology ===

The Williamson amplifier is a four-stage, push-pull, class A triode valve amplifier built around a high quality, wideband output transformer. Its second (concertina-type phase splitter, V1B), third (driver, V2A and V2B) and fourth (output, V3 and V4) stages follow Cocking&#x27;s &quot;Quality Amplifier&quot; circuit. The added first stage (V1A) is a dedicated error amplifier, which compensates for the loss of gain caused by negative feedback. Williamson optimized operating points of each stage for best linearity with sufficient overload reserve. The output stage is biased into pure class A; traditionally it used triode-connected beam tetrodes or pentodes. With American 807 or British KT66 valves (Williamson recommended the latter type) and specified power supply the amplifier delivered 15 watts of output power. Further increase in output, according to Williamson, required use of four output valves; his 1947 article mentions construction of a 70-watt prototype.

The plate of the first stage and the grid of the phase splitter are connected directly. This configuration, known since 1940, was still uncommon in 1947; American designers considered it a novelty even in the early 1950s. Phase splitter, driver and output stage are capacitively coupled. Cathode bypass capacitors are absent: Williamson, like Cocking before him, tried to linearize open-loop performance of each stage, and deliberately sacrificed gain for linearity; he was also concerned with potential low-frequency instability introduced by added capacitances. The circuit in either 1947 or 1949 variant contains no electrolytic capacitors; its power supply uses a CLC π-filter with two 8 μF paper capacitors, with a further LC filter feeding the first three stages.

Derivative designs of the 1950s often deviated from Williamson&#x27;s recommendations while retaining his four-stage topology. According to Peter Stinson, this alone is not sufficient to be called a Williamson amplifier. A true Williamson amplifier must meet five criteria simultaneously:
# All four stages must use triodes; the output stage may use triode-connected tetrodes or pentodes;
# Output stage must operate in class A;
# Phase splitter must be directly coupled to the input stage;
# High-quality output transformer must conform to the original Williamson specification;
# Global negative feedback loop must be connected from transformer secondary to the cathode of the input triode, and be exactly 20 dB deep.

=== Feedback ===

The 20 dB (ten-to-one) feedback loop of the Williamson amplifier wraps around all four stages and the output transformer. According to Richard C. Hitchcock, &quot;this is a severe test of design and is one of the outstanding features of the Williamson circuit.&quot; Williamson wrote that the depth of feedback can be easily increased from 20 to 30 dB, but the audible improvements of deeper feedback will be diminishingly low.

All frequency compensation components are located in the first and second stages of the circuit: their local smoothing RC filters subtly alter frequency response at infrasonic frequencies. An additional RC-filter in the first stage, introduced by Williamson in the 1949 version, prevents oscillations at ultrasonic frequencies. Feedback voltage divider is connected to the transformer secondary, thus feedback depth is dependent on loudspeaker impedance, and setting it at precisely 20 dB requires altering the divider ratio. The voltage divider is purely resistive, with no capacitive or inductive frequency compensation components. According to Williamson, a capacitor shunting the upper leg of the divider is only necessary for inferior-quality transformers; if the transformer matches requirements set by Williamson, the capacitor is useless.

=== Transformer ===

Williamson was confident that the output transformer is the most critical component in any valve amplifier. Even before applying global feedback, the transformer is liable for at least four types of distortion. Their causes cannot be addressed simultaneously, and the designer must make a compromise between conflicting requirements. Global feedback partially suppresses distortion, but also tightens requirements to the bandwidth of the transformer.

Stability theory predicted that an amplifier built to Williamson&#x27;s specifications could only be stable if the bandwidth of its output transformer was no less than 2.5...160000 Hz. This was impractically wide for an audio amplifier, requiring an exceptionally large, complex and expensive transformer. Williamson, seeking a working solution, had to decrease phase margin to a bare minimum; even then, the required bandwidth had to be no less than 3,3...60000 Hz. Such a transformer, driven by a pair of triode-connected KT66, had to have primary winding inductance of at least 100 H, and leakage inductance of no more than 33 mH. These were extremely demanding specifications for the period, far exceeding anything available on the consumer market. The &quot;Williamson transformers&quot; had to be heavier, larger, more complex and more expensive than typical audio transformers, and yet they could only guarantee minimally acceptable stability. A wider phase margin, wrote Williamson, was highly desirable but required absolutely impractical values of primary inductance.

=== Overload behaviour ===

Valve amplifiers with capacitive coupling between the driver stage and the output stage do not &quot;clip&quot; in the same manner as transistor amplifiers (e.g. clamping output voltage to one of the supply rails). Instead, they &quot;choke&quot; when large signal swings intermittently attempt to bias the grids of the output valves above zero. Positively-biased grids begin conducting, but the coupling capacitors cannot delivered required current. Grid voltages do not reach target values, output waveform flattens.

Feedback attempts to overcome choking by increasing driver voltage swing, but fails because coupling capacitors cannot physically pass direct current. Resulting distortion pattern, as Williamson proved with photocopies of oscillograms and Lissajous curves, is &quot;of the desirable type&quot;, i.e. with abrupt onset of distortion at the extremes of otherwise highly linear response curves.

=== Stability problem ===


The first attempts to build the Williamson amplifier revealed its tendency to oscillate due to very narrow phase margin. Astor and Langford-Smith, who gave the Williamson excellent ratings, reported that &quot;for fairly large outputs at low frequencies a high frequency oscillation about 60 kC/s [kHz] would commence and be accompanied by a pulsed output of some other frequency&quot;. The Australians, armed with first-class test equipment, suppressed the 60 kHz oscillation with small capacitors on screen grids, but could not identify and suppress the cause of &quot;some other&quot; oscillations.
Later, technicians of the United States Naval Research Laboratory examined seven different commercially available Williamson amplifiers, and found that all of them oscillated at infrasonic frequencies of 2...3 Hz. Replacement of output transformers affected stability only at audio and ultrasonic frequencies. The best transformers displayed perfectly flat frequency response from 10 to 100,000 Hz, but were also prone to infrasonic &quot;breathing&quot;. The worst transformers displayed prominent ultrasonic resonances that, however, did not cause sustained oscillations. Some &quot;ringed&quot; at relatively low frequencies of 30 to 50 kHz, others extended into 500...700 kHz range.

Custom-built &quot;Williamson transformers&quot; were imperfect, but general-purpose, off-the-shelf transformers used by amateurs were far worse. Their resonances could only be tamed by narrowing the amplifier&#x27;s bandwidth. The extent of stability problem in the DIY community remains unknown: the editors of &quot;Wireless Worlds&quot; were flooded with readers&#x27; letters, but preferred to redirect them to Williamson. What is known is that the inventor was compelled to revise and improve the design; he took a leave from his job at Ferranti and presented the second version of the Williamson in 1949. Williamson could not fix the fundamental stability problem; the &quot;New version&quot; was just barely stable. Independent analysis published in December 1950 proved that the revised Williamson amplifier remained prone to both infrasonic and ultrasonic oscillations.

According to the analysis, infrasonic open-loop response of the Williamson amplifier is shaped by three high-pass filters: two interstage RC filters, each with a cutoff frequency of 6 Hz, and the output stage RL filter, formed by the valves&#x27; output impedances and the transformer&#x27;s primary inductance. At zero input signal, the nonlinear RL filter has a cutoff frequency of 3 Hz. This combination of cutoff frequencies, wrapped inside a 2030dB frequency loop, is unstable. Williamson tried to suppress it with a compensation network, also serving as a smoothing filter. The transformer&#x27;s nonlinearity also improved stability: at high signal currents effective inductance of the primary increased, causing a decrease in cutoff frequency and a rise in phase margin. The simplest solution was to spread apart cutoff frequencies of the RC filters, provided that the output transformer conforms to the Williamson specification. For example, the 1952 &quot;Ultralinear Williamson&quot; by David Hafler and Herbert Keroes had these frequencies set at 1.3 and 6 Hz.

Precise analysis at ultrasonic frequencies is impossible due to the asymmetry of the phase splitter stage, and unknown parasitics and nonlinearities of the output stage. Depending on the chosen analysis model, open-loop response can be roughly approximated with a combination of either four or five low-pass filters. Different authors used different approaches and estimated somewhat different cutoff points of these filters, but in each case at least three of four or five cutoff frequencies were dangerously close to each other, which was a certain sign of instability. Williamson, again, fixed the problem with an RC compensation network, but even then phase margin remained dangerously low. DIYers had to tackle oscillations themselves: some added shunting capacitors to the screen grids, others tweaked layout and wiring, or deliberately narrowed the amplifier&#x27;s bandwidth, negating the benefits of the original circuit.

=== Component problem ===
The Williamson amplifier was very sensitive to the quality and parameters of passive components and valves. Carbon and composition-type resistors generated excessive noise and caused harmonic distortion; American valves used as substitutes for the British types specified by Williamson, could not match their performance. Williamson warned that the KT66 has no direct substitutes, and should be preferred over any alternatives.

Amateurs who copied the Williamson amplifier were unable to identify and fix its critical weak points. An amateur armed with an analogue multimeter could &quot;see&quot; infrasonic oscillations by watching the instrument needle, but fixing high-frequency issues required an oscilloscope with bandwidth of at least 1 or 2MHz bandwidth. In the 1950s bandwidths of many commercial oscilloscopes were too narrow for the task, and even these models were too expensive for the DIYers.

Articles by professional engineers dealing with analysis and fine tuning of the Williamson amplifier were published relatively late, when the original DIY enthusiasm had already faded - in 1952, 1957, 1961. Martin Kiebert, who built professional-grade Williamson amplifiers for his laboratory at Bendix Corporation, identified five sources of distortion caused by inferior components other than the transformer:

# Excessive noise and electromagnetic interference caused by noisy carbon or composition-type resistors and incorrect layout of the first stage. Replacement of resistors specified by Williamson with wirewound resistors could improve signal-to-noise ratio by . Replacement of 6SN7 with low-noise 12AY7 could gain another ;
# Frequency and harmonic distortion caused by asymmetry of passive components in two sides of a push-pull circuit. Typical components of the 1950s had 20% tolerances, which was unacceptably high for the Williamson;
# The 6SN7 driver stage was often unable to properly swing the KT66 grids, causing excessive distortion. According to Kiebert, the American 5687 dual triode was clearly superior. According to Talbot Wright, the 6SN7 was not at fault - distortion was caused by incorrectly set standing current, and could be improved by a simple increase in bias voltage;
# Distortion in the feedback voltage divider. This critical function required low-distortion wirewound resistors;
# Distortion was clearly influenced by the choice of output valves, however, Kiebert could not identify any specific rules.

Kiebert rated the design positively but warned the readers that following Williamson&#x27;s instructions is possible only in a laboratory environment. The amplifier reveals its potential only with expensive, properly matched components that were out of reach of an average amateur. Even a perfectly built and tested Williamson amplifier would sooner or later need valve replacement, which would very likely cause an unexpected rise in distortion.

== Variants and derivatives ==
After 1950 the industry produced numerous derivatives of the Williamson amplifier, often deviating significantly from the principles outlined by its creator. In 1950 Herbert Keroes shunted common cathode resistor of his 807 amplifier with a large electrolytic capacitor which, according to Keroes, significantly reduced distortion at high output power. Contrary to recommendations by Cocking and Williamson, Keroes and his partner David Hafler used cathode shunt capacitors in most of their designs; by 1956 this approach became de facto industry standard. In the same 1956 Hafler used fixed bias in his EL34 Williamson. Later, fixed bias became a staple of Soviet and Russian Williamson-like designs that employed exotic output valves like the 6C4C directly-heated triode, the GU-50 generator pentode or the 6P45S horizontal deflection tetrode.

Throughout the 1950s, as prices of capacitors decreased, designers steadily increased their values. The original Williamson amplifier used paper capacitors; by 1952 Kiebert uses electrolytics; the 1955 reference design by Keroes used at least bypass capacitors; the 1961 budget amplifier by Wright employed a total of . Designers of the commercial Bell2200 amplifier (1953) replaced direct coupling of the first two stages with capacitive coupling; the Stromberg-CarlsonAR-425 (also 1953) use a tetrode-mode output stage in an otherwise familiar Williamson topology. Both Bell and Stromberg-Carson modifications further worsened stability, and required additional frequency compensation. Designers of the BogenDB20 (1953) went even further, and combined global and local negative feedback loops with positive feedback in the output stage.

In December 1951 Hafler and Keroes began promoting the ultralinear stage - a method of distributing load between anode and screen grid of a pentode or tetrode, invented by Alan Blumlein in the 1930s. An ultralinear stage delivered 50% to 100% more output power than the same stage in triode connection, at roughly the same distortion, and cost less than a pure pentode or tetrode stage (the latter required a separate screen grid supply, the ultralinear did not need it). The first &quot;Ultralinear Williamson&quot;, employing a pair of 6L6 in a Williamson-like topology, delivered ; their second model, built around more powerful 807 tetrodes, delivered . Very soon the American public acquired taste to high-power amplification, and the industry launched the &quot;race for Watts&quot;. By 1955 Hafler and Keroes, now working separately, were offering 60-Watt models employing pairs of 6550 tetrodes or quartets of KT66s. Thus in less than a decade, step by step, the industry abandoned the principles set by Williamson, but continued to use his name as a convenient free trademark. In the 21st century it is even used for amplifiers without global negative feedback; the only thing they have in common with the true Williamson amplifier is the four-stage topology.

Following the success of Hafler and Keroes, American manufacturers like Eico, The Fisher, Harman/Kardon and Marantz disposed with &quot;obsolete&quot; power triodes and switched to ultralinear designs. Mullard, Britain&#x27;s largest valve manufacturer and provider of reference designs to the European industry, publicly supported the novelty. Williamson&#x27;s former employer, General Electric Company, followed suit and published a reference &quot;30-Watt Williamson&quot; design built around a pair of ultralinear-connected KT88. The original Williamson amplifier lost the race, just like alternative designs by Peter Walker and Frank McIntosh. In September 1952 Williamson and Walker (then business partners in the development of the Quad Electrostatic Loudspeaker) agreed that the ultralinear stage was, indeed, preferable in mass production. Williamson gradually stepped aside from audio engineering. He made his living by designing milling machines and flexible manufacturing systems, which later earned him election to the Royal Society, and never considered audio design a serious occupation for himself.

In 1956 most production amplifiers in North America followed the &quot;Ultralinear Williamson&quot; template, but in the next few years it was retired, too. The new three-stage reference design combined phase splitter and driver functions in one valve, and thus cost proportionally less than four-stage amplifiers. Hafler&#x27;s Dynaco Stereo 70, which followed this topology, became the most produced valve amplifier in history. North American consumer market was flooded with millions of similar, almost identical amplifiers and receivers claiming 25 to 20W per channel, as well as clones of less powerful British designs like the Mullard 5-10. Advertisements claimed that these models performed as well as the original Williamson, with higher output power and with guaranteed stability. The customers could not verify these claims, and had to rely to listening tests, hearsay and expert advice. The problem was partially addressed by the concept of subjective listening, advanced by Hafler and Keroes back in 1951: &quot;Excellent measurements are a necessary but not a sufficient condition for the quality of sound. The listening test is one of most importance... the most stringent test of all&quot;. By the end of the 1960s subjectivist approach was adopted by the audiophiles and marketing people, who eagerly forgot about the objective principles devised by Williamson in the 1940s.

Objectively, many deep-feedback valve designs of the 1950s matched or exceeded the 0.1% distortion rating of the Williamson amplifier, but none could significantly improve on this figure. Williamson had found that valve amplifier performance was limited mostly by the output transformer. Transistor amplifiers did not have this limitation, and yet it took around 15 years to bring their performance to the level attained by Williamson in 1947.

<doc id="1019192" wikidata="Q4886584" url="?curid=1019192" title="T-Bolan">
<text>T-Bolan is a Japanese rock band which debuted in 1991. Its members are vocal Arashi Moritomo, drummer Kazuyoshi Aoki, guitarist Takeshi Gomi, and bassist Hirofumi Ueno. The name of this band was inspired by T. Rex and its vocalist Marc Bolan.

==Biography==
The band was formed in 1990. Their 1991 song &quot;Hanashitaku wa Nai&quot; (lit. &quot;I do not want to release you&quot;) became a hit song in the cable broadcast. After this success, the band released several hit songs and albums. Their 1993 song &quot;Osaekirenai Kono Kimochi&quot; (lit. &quot;Inextinguishable This Heart&quot;) was used for the ending theme of &quot;Ichigo Hakusho&quot; (in which then-unknown Namie Amuro played a role). The single reached number 1 on the Japanese Oricon weekly charts, becoming their first number-one single. However, Moritomo suffered throat problems so his doctor advised that he should give up singing. Despite this, he was forced to perform a live concert on March 26, 1995. It became their last concert for the decade. After a long hiatus, the band officially disbanded in December 1999. In 2009, after nearly decade of treatment, Moritomo finally regained his voice, then started a solo career not under the band&#x27;s same label, but by Avex. After hearing fans wishing for the group to reform however, Moritomo and the rest of T-Bolan agreed to reunite in late 2012 and are set to go on a nationwide tour of 16 cities beginning in October 2012. However the first attempt of reunion did not go well and the band went on hiatus for reasons of &quot;each individual member walking their own paths&quot;. In 2017 the band has announced full resume of their music activities. They are active as of 2023.

<doc id="1019194" wikidata="Q862435" url="?curid=1019194" title="Lockheed EC-121 Warning Star">
<text>The Lockheed EC-121 Warning Star is an American airborne early warning and control radar surveillance aircraft operational in the 1950s in both the United States Navy (USN) and United States Air Force (USAF).

The military version of the Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation was used to serve as an airborne early warning system to supplement the Distant Early Warning Line, using two large radomes (a vertical dome above and a horizontal one below the fuselage). It replaced the TBM-3W used by the USN. Some EC-121s were also used for signal intelligence gathering. The EC-121 was introduced in 1954 and phased out in 1978, although a single specially modified EW aircraft remained in USN service until 1982.

The USN versions when initially procured were designated WV-1 (PO-1W), WV-2, and WV-3. The USAF Warning Stars served during the Vietnam War both as electronic sensor monitors and as a forerunner to the Boeing E-3 Sentry AWACS. USAF aircrews adopted its civil nickname, &quot;Connie&quot; (diminutive of Constellation) as reference, USN aircrews used the nickname &quot;Willie Victor&quot;.

==Development==
Since 1943, the Lockheed Constellation had been in USAAF service as the C-69. The use of the Constellation by the USN for patrol and airborne early warning duties was first investigated in 1949, when the USN acquired two Lockheed L-749 Constellations. First flown on 9 June 1949, the PO-1W carried large, long-range radars in massive radomes above and below the fuselage. As the radomes possessed considerably more side area, the vertical stabilizers of the PO-1W had to be enlarged. After the PO-1W (redesignated WV-1 in 1952) had proved that operating large radars on aircraft was possible, the USN ordered the WV-2 based on the L-1049 Super Constellation. The WV-1s were transferred to the Federal Aviation Agency in 1958–1959.

The WV-2/EC-121D was initially fitted with a dorsal AN/APS-45 height finder and a ventral AN/APS-20 search radar. These were later upgraded to AN/APS-103 and AN/APS-95 radars, although not simultaneously. The crew commonly numbered 18, six officers (two pilots, two navigators, and two weapons controllers) and 12 enlisted (two flight engineers, one radio operator, two crew chiefs, five radar operators, and two radar technicians). However, when North Korea shot down a Navy EC-121 in 1969, a crew of 31 was on board.

Orders were placed totaling 142 PO-2W Constellations based on the Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation, with deliveries beginning in 1953. The PO-2W was redesignated WV-2 in 1954. In 1962, with standardization of aircraft designations within the Department of Defense, the WV-2 then became the EC-121K. In total, 13 of these were converted to WV-2Q electronic intelligence (ELINT) aircraft (becoming EC-121M in 1962). Nine were converted to WV-3 weather reconnaissance aircraft (WC-121N in 1962). The EC-121K was also operated by Training Squadron 86 (VT-86) at NAS Glynco, Georgia, for training of student naval flight officers destined to fly both the EC-121 and the Grumman E-2 Hawkeye. At NAS Glynco&#x27;s closure, VT-86 transferred to NAS Pensacola, Florida, in 1973, the squadron&#x27;s last EC-121 was also flown to NAS Pensacola, being stored in the collection of the National Museum of Naval Aviation, where it still remains. A single aircraft became an NC-121K, the electronic warfare variant assigned to Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron 33 (VAQ-33) at NAS Key West, Florida. The aircraft was the last EC-121 in operational service, flying until 25 June 1982.

The USAF received 10 RC-121C and 74 EC-121D Warning Stars also based on the L-1049, beginning with diversions from the Navy contracts in October 1953. The 10 RC-121Cs became trainers, designated TC-121C. Between 1966 and 1969, 30 retired USN EC-121s were transferred to USAF and converted in EC-121Rs as sensor-monitoring aircraft. Of the 74 EC-121s, 42 were converted to the EC-121H upgrade beginning in 1962, and in 1969, 15 of the remaining EC-121Ds and seven of the EC-121Hs were further upgraded into the final operational variant, the EC-121T, serving as an AWACS prototype in Southeast Asia in 1972. Five EC-121Ds were modified to be broadcasting aircraft for psychological warfare operations, the predecessors of the EC-130 Commando Solo.

==Operational service==

===USN===

WV-2s, redesignated EC-121s in 1962, served from 1954 to 1965 in two &quot;barrier&quot; forces, one off each coast of the North American continent. The barrier forces consisted of five surface picket stations each manned by radar destroyer escorts and an air wing of WV-2s/EC-121s that patrolled the picket lines at 1,000–4,000 m (3,000–12,000 ft) altitude in 6- to 20-hour missions. Their objective was to extend early warning coverage against surprise Soviet bomber and missile attacks as an extension of the DEW Line.

In April 1954, the first Lockheed Super Constellation (Model 1049C), WV-2 BuNo. 128323, was received at NAS Barbers Point by Airborne Early Warning Squadron One (VW-1).

The Atlantic Barrier (BARLANT) consisted of two rotating squadron detachments sourced from AEW Squadron Thirteen (VW-13) and AEW Squadron Fifteen (VW-15) from NAS Patuxent River, Maryland and one squadron, AEW Squadron Eleven (VW-11), permanently based at Naval Station Argentia, Newfoundland. Their mission was to fly orbits to the Azores and back. An additional AEW training unit was based at NAS Patuxent River for training flight crews and maintenance personnel.

BARLANT became operational on 1 July 1956, and flew continuous coverage until early 1965. The barrier was shifted to cover the approaches between Greenland, Iceland, and the United Kingdom (GIUK) barrier in June 1961. Aircraft from Argentia were staged through NAS Keflavik, Iceland, to extend coverage times.

The Pacific Barrier (BARPAC) received the first operational AEW squadron, Airborne Early Warning Squadron One (VW-1) and the first EC-121K aircraft. AEW Squadron Three followed with AEW Squadrons Twelve, Fourteen, and Sixteen. In January 1958 VW-1 and VW-3 relocated to NAS Agana, Guam, M.I. where VW-1 continued its AEW commitments and VW-3 operational commitment was divided between AEW and weather. BARPAC became operational with AEW Squadron Twelve (VW-12) based at NAS Barbers Point, Hawaii, operating from a deployment base at NAS Midway on 1 July 1958 and later expanded to include AEW Squadrons Fourteen (VW-14) and Sixteen (VW-16). Their orbits overlapped the radar picket stations of the ships of Escort Squadron Seven, from roughly Adak Island to Midway. Normally, five WV-2s/EC-121s were required at any single time to provide coverage over the entire line.

The Hawaiian barrier force operations were discontinued by September 1965, and their EC-121K aircraft were placed in storage. However, VW-1 continued operating until 1972, flying weather ops and supplying AEW to naval forces in the Gulf of Tonkin. USN C-121, EC-121, WC-12,1 and NC-121 operations continued until 1975 in seven other squadrons and until 1982 in an eighth. Some EC-121s were used in Vietnam, mirroring USAF EC-121 missions, but orbiting the Gulf of Tonkin, as that was the USN&#x27;s assigned area.

Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron One (VQ-1) and Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron Two (VQ-2) operated EC-121M ELINT gathering aircraft at NAF Atsugi, Japan, and Naval Station Rota, Spain, respectively, until they transitioned to the EP-3B Orion and EP-3E Aries aircraft.

Weather Reconnaissance Squadron Four (VW-4) operated WV-3-&quot;cum&quot;-WC-121s between 1954 and 1975 as Hurricane Hunters, with its primary base at NAS Jacksonville, Florida, and a forward base at Naval Station Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico. Its Pacific counterpart, Weather Reconnaissance Squadron Three (VW-3) Typhoon Trackers was the operational weather squadron in the Pacific, flying from NAS Agana, Guam, tracking typhoons from 1955 to 1960. On June 30, 1960 Weather Reconnaissance Squadron Three, VW-3, disbanded and many of its aircraft (8 - BuNo. 145 series) and crews were absorbed by VW-1, which retained AEW designation and took on the weather commitments and the Title of &quot;Typhoon Trackers&quot; of VW-3. VW-4 later transitioned to WP-3A Orion.

Also operating C-121 and EC-121 aircraft was Oceanographic Development Squadron Eight (VXN-8) at NAS Patuxent River, Maryland, which employed the aircraft for specific projects (e.g., Project BIRDSEYE, MAGNET, ASWEPS etc.) for the Office of Naval Research until they were replaced by RP-3A and RP-3D Orion aircraft. VXN-8 also operated four additional NC-121 aircraft called the &quot;Blue Eagles&quot;. These specially modified aircraft were equipped with complete radio and television transmitting equipment and studios for simultaneous broadcast of American and Vietnamese television and radio programs prior to the installation of ground stations during the Vietnam War. The aircraft flew nightly 7 days per week broadcasting such American TV programs as &quot;Combat&quot;, &quot;Have Gun-Will Travel&quot;, and &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, along with other popular programs of the time in addition to Vietnamese programs recorded prior to each flight . Nightly American news broadcasts were transmitted live using an onboard TV studio and an Air Force newscaster bringing the latest news from home and the world. The &quot;Blue Eagles&quot; operated out of Saigon and Danang Air Bases for around 5 years commencing in 1965. 

Air Development Squadron Six (VX-6, based at NAS Quonset Point, Rhode Island, also operated R7V aircraft, redesignated C-121J, in support of United States Antarctic Program operations until replaced by LC-130F Hercules aircraft.

The EC-121 was also operated by Training Squadron 86 (VT-86) at NAS Glynco, Georgia, for training student naval flight officers destined for the E-2 Hawkeye and by Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron 33 (VAQ-33) for the Fleet Electronic Warfare Systems Group (FEWSG) at NAS Norfolk, Virginia, and later, following a squadron homeport change, at NAS Key West, Florida. At the time of its retirement on June 25, 1982, VAQ-33&#x27;s NC-121K aircraft, Buno 141292 was the last NC-121K and the last of its type operated by the USN.

===USAF===
The USAF operated EC-121s between 1954 and 1978, with three wings at maximum employment and three independent squadrons as operations wound down. Until the Vietnam War, their primary mission was to provide complementary early warning radar coverage to the Pacific and Atlantic barriers by flying orbits offshore from the continental United States in what were termed &quot;contiguous barriers&quot;. The coverage orbits overlapped those of land-based early warning radars.

Initial deployment of EC-121Cs began with 551st Airborne Early Warning and Control Wing, based at Otis Air Force Base, Massachusetts. Operational on 21 December 1954, 551st AEWCW subsequently upgraded to EC-121D and later EC-121H Warning Stars.

Its Pacific counterpart was 552d Airborne Early Warning and Control Wing (AEWCW), based at McClellan Air Force Base, California, becoming operational on 1 July 1955. After the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, 552nd AEWCW also had administrative control of the 966th AEWCS, based at McCoy Air Force Base, Florida. The 966th had a dual mission - monitoring activity in Cuban airspace and flying Gold Digger missions (continuous tracks of U-2 surveillance missions).

The third air wing to operate EC-121s was 553rd Reconnaissance Wing, a Vietnam war organization activated in 1967 and based in Thailand until inactivation in 1970 (See BatCat below). In 1966, Lockheed modified 30 ex-USN Super Constellations (two EC-121P/WV-3 and 28 EC-121K/WV-2) aircraft to EC-121Rs for the specialized reconnaissance mission flown by the 553rd. Aircraft were delivered during the course of 1967. The 553rd RW flew over land and off the coast of Vietnam, over Laos and Cambodia, monitoring and retransmitting low-power signals. Usually, they orbited the Ho Chi Minh Trail in 8-hour shifts. As it was expensive to operate and it exposed a large crew to enemy fire, it was replaced in December 1970 by the much smaller (and eventually unmanned drone) QU-22 Pave Eagle sensor monitor.

The 551st AEWCW inactivated in 1969, while the 552d was reduced by a squadron in 1971. In July 1974, USAF redesignated 552d Airborne Early Warning and Control Wing as 552d Airborne Warning and Control Group when it was downsized to a single squadron. It inactivated in April 1976.

As the USAF prepared for deploying the E-3 Sentry in the later 1970s, it phased out EC-121 operations by the end of 1975. All remaining EC-121s transferred to Air Force Reserve, which formed the 79th AEWCS at Homestead Air Force Base, Florida, in early 1976. The active duty force continued providing personnel to operate the EC-121s on a 24-hour basis, assigning Detachment 1, 20th Air Defence Squadron to Homestead AFB as associate active duty crews to fly the AFRES-owned aircraft. Besides monitoring Cuban waters, these last Warning Stars also operated from NAS Keflavik. Final EC-121 ops ended in September 1978. Detachment 1 dissolved and 79th AEWCS was redesignated a fighter squadron on 1 October 1978.

In 1967, five EC-121s became operational with the 193rd Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron of the Pennsylvania Air National Guard, responsible for psychological operations missions under project Coronet Solo. From July 1970 to January 1971, they rotated on 30- to 90-day temporary-duty deployments to Korat Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand, under the name &quot;Commando Buzz&quot;.

==Vietnam War==
EC-121s were used extensively in Southeast Asia between 16 April 1965, and 1 June 1974, particularly in support of Operation Rolling Thunder and Operation Linebacker/Linebacker II, providing radar early warning and limited airborne control of USAF fighter forces engaging MiG interceptors. Flying orbits over the Gulf of Tonkin and later over Laos, they were the forerunners of AWACS aircraft. The USN used a variant, the NC-121, in their Blue Eagle unit from 1965–1972. Blue Eagles were television- and radio-broadcasting airplanes. The Blue Eagles were based at NAS Patuxent River and were part of oceanographic squadron VXN-8.

===Big Eye===
At the onset of Rolling Thunder, the North Vietnamese had an advantage in that their radar coverage could detect most US strike aircraft flying at or above virtually anywhere in the country, using a system that was difficult to jam. US forces countered with radar ships (&quot;Crown&quot;) in the Gulf of Tonkin and a ground site at Nakhon Phanom RTAFB, Thailand, but both systems were line-of-sight and suffered coverage gaps.

To increase coverage, the Seventh Air Force (7 AF) requested airborne radar support and the Air Defense Command (redesignated Aerospace Defense Command in 1968) was directed to set up the &quot;Big Eye Task Force&quot;. Five EC-121Ds and 100 support personnel of the 552nd AEWCW at McClellan AFB were deployed to Tainan Air Station, Taiwan, with four of the EC-121s sent on to a forward operating location at Tan Son Nhut Air Base, near Saigon, South Vietnam.

The EC-121s were designed for detection of aircraft flying over water, so ground clutter (spurious signal returns off of terrain features such as mountains) caused interference with their radar pictures. The crews, however, were experienced in tracking Soviet aircraft over Cuba and had developed a technique whereby an EC-121 flying at to above water could bounce a signal from its bottom-mounted APS-95 Search radar off the surface of the water and detect aircraft at medium altitudes out to . Operating in pairs, one Big Eye EC-121 flew a race track pattern approximately offshore (Alpha orbit), with the orbit&#x27;s center at . The second one flew a track at (Bravo orbit) farther from the coast, acting as a spare for the Alpha EC-121.

This provided a practical detection range of , enough to cover the Hanoi urban area and the main MiG base at Phúc Yên. A major disadvantage of this arrangement, however, was that most MiG contacts were beyond the range of the Big Eye&#x27;s APS-45 Height Finder radar, so that they were unable to provide this data to USAF strike forces. Furthermore, technical shortcomings in the EC-121D&#x27;s systems precluded either controlling a fighter intercept or identifying a specific flight under attack.

The missions from Tan Son Nhut AB began 21 April 1965, using callsigns Ethan Alpha and Ethan Bravo, which became standard. After refueling at Danang Air Base, Ethan Alpha made a wave-top approach to its orbit station, where it remained for five hours. Because of the threat of MiG interception, EC-121s were protected by a Lockheed F-104 Starfighter MiGCAP. If, for any reason, the MiGCAP could not rendezvous, the EC-121s cancelled their mission. Air-conditioning systems aboard the EC-121 were virtually useless in this profile, and the heat produced by the electronics, combined with the threat of being shot down, made Alpha orbit missions in particular very stressful. On 10 July 1965, in its first airborne-controlled interception, an EC-121 provided warning to a pair of USAF F-4C fighters, resulting in the shooting down of two MiG-17s.

The Big Eye Task Force remained at Tan Son Nhut until February 1967, when the threat of Viet Cong ground attacks prompted a move to Thailand.

===College Eye===
In March 1967, Big Eye was renamed &quot;College Eye Task Force&quot; (CETF) and relocated at Ubon Royal Thai Air Force Base. Because of the complexity of the aircraft and its systems along with the large support group it required, CETF could not be supported at the relatively small Thai bases. It moved to Udon RTAFB in July and to its final station at Korat RTAFB in October 1967. Seven of 26 EC-121s deployed from Otis AFB and arrived at Korat, on the 19th.

From April 1965 to early 1966 and beginning again in late 1967, the EC-121Ds also controlled a flight of MiGCAP fighters for unarmed support aircraft operating over the Tonkin Gulf. The EC-121Ds also served as an airborne communications relay center for strike aircraft to transmit mission results and position reports to Danang Air Control Center; directed operations of fighter escorts, MiGCAPs, Lockheed C-130 Hercules flare ships and A-26 strike aircraft along the North Vietnamese-Laotian border; provided radar and navigational assistance for combat search and rescue missions; and assisted fighters in finding tankers for emergency refueling.
In May 1966, the government of China formally protested an incursion by a Republic F-105 Thunderchief pursuing a North Vietnamese MiG it subsequently shot down inside Chinese territory. A US board of inquiry recommended that College Eye also had to monitor the &quot;no-fly zone&quot; inside the North Vietnamese border with China, to provide alerts to US aircraft nearing the buffer zone and to report border crossing violations by US aircraft. This could not be done from the gulf, so a third orbit, Ethan Charlie, was created in Laos. After tests in June and August, regular missions began 24 August. Not enough EC-121s or crews were available to support three orbits twice daily, so the Laotian orbit was only flown every third day, with Ethan Bravo missions cancelled on those days. After 13 October 1966, the Charlie orbit was flown every day and the Bravo orbit suspended altogether. In April 1967, four more EC-121s were deployed, to Thailand on 29 May, making for a total strength of three College Eyes in Taiwan and six in Thailand.

In April 1967, USAF began fitting its entire EC-121 fleet with QRC-248 IFF transponder interrogators. QRC-248 had been developed to follow Soviet-export aircraft flown by the Cuban Air Force. The SRO-2 transponders installed in Soviet export MiGs enabled Cuban ground-controlled interception (GCI) radars to identify and control their fighters. A testbed EC-121 called &quot;Quick Look&quot; had flown with College Eye in January 1967 to test QRC-248 and found that North Vietnamese MiGs used the same transponder. QRC-248 accurately discriminated MiG radar returns from the myriad returns picked up during a mission and extended the range of low-altitude detection to more than , covering virtually all important North Vietnamese target areas.

By May, all College Eyes had been fitted with QRC-248. Ethan Bravo&#x27;s mission was changed from that of a backup for Ethan Alpha to being the primary QRC-248 listener, but College Eye was prohibited by the Joint Chiefs of Staff from actively &quot;interrogating&quot; MiG transponders, following a National Security Agency security policy protecting its &quot;intelligence sources&quot; (of which the QRC-248 was one), thus was restricted to waiting for North Vietnamese GCI to interrogate its aircraft. QRC-248 began regular use in July 1967, but by then North Vietnam&#x27;s MiG force, which had suffered serious losses in May, had suspended its combat operations.

In the last week of August, however, after a period of intensive training and revision of tactics, the MiGs began engaging US strike forces again, scoring a number of kills. Then, Seventh Air Force finally obtained permission for the new Ethan Bravo mission EC-121 to actively interrogate with QRC-248 on 6 October. By 4 December, its success outweighed any value in flying the Ethan Alpha orbit, which was discontinued until July 1972.

On 1 March 1968, College Eye callsigns changed to Ethan 01, 02, 03 and 04. Ethan 03 (Laotian orbit) began &quot;positive control&quot; (airborne direction) of C-130 flareship flights and A-26 Invader night interdiction missions along the Ho Chi Minh Trail in Laos on 19 April 1968.

The task force was scaled back in July 1968, to four EC-121Ds and the &quot;Rivet Top&quot; testbed aircraft to allow for the basing of another College Eye detachment at Itazuke AB, Japan. The name of the task force was discontinued in October 1968, when it was redesignated a final time as Detachment 1 (Rotational), 552nd AEWCW. EC-121 deployments to Southeast Asia were discontinued in June 1970 in the expectation that they would no longer be used.

===Rivet Top===

In August 1967, while the College Eye Task Force was still based at Udon RTAFB, another prototype EC-121 variation began operations testing new equipment as Detachment 2 of the Tactical Air Warfare Center. Known as &quot;Rivet Top&quot;, this modified EC-121K (later redesignated EC-121M) carried the QRC-248 newly installed in the College Eye aircraft and also had electronic interrogators capable of reading two additional Soviet transponders, the SRO-1 and SOD-57. Its electronics were custom built rather than off-the-shelf. Its most important upgrade was the top-secret &quot;Rivet Gym&quot; installation. This consisted of the addition to the crew of Vietnamese-speaking intelligence specialists manning four voice communications intercept stations able to monitor all communications between the MiGs and their GCI controllers.

Despite this advantage, Rivet Top experienced two problems, reducing its effectiveness. Its operators did not have radar scopes to correlate intercepted conversations with specific flights of MiGs, thus could not determine which US aircraft might be under attack. Secondly, like QRC-248, Rivet Gym was an NSA SIGINT asset and subject to even more stringent rules protecting knowledge of its existence. Even when real-time warnings to US aircraft were finally permitted in mid-1972, fighter crews were not made aware of the source of the warnings and because EC-121 radio communications were poor, mandating the use of a radio relay aircraft that often failed, they tended to disregard the credibility of the source.

The Rivet Top prototype moved to Korat RTAFB along with the College Eye Task Force in October 1967. Originally scheduled to return to the USA in February 1968, because of its value, it remained at Korat until 1969. Flying daily missions through its testing period, it began flying every-other-day missions over the Gulf of Tonkin after 31 March 1968, when Rolling Thunder operations were sharply scaled back. Rivet Gym installations were back-fitted to all College Eye EC-121s by the end of May 1968.

===Operation Kingpin===
Two EC-121Ds, newly modified with the Southeast Asia Operational Requirement 62 (SEAOR-62) electronics suite, but not yet operational as EC-121Ts, were ordered to Korat RTAFB in October 1970. Under the guise of being field tested, they were accompanied by a C-121G carrying additional crew members, the most experienced 552nd AEWCW technicians, and equipment necessary to maintain the new electronics. The SEAOR-62 package was supported by a digital data receiver ground terminal and by radio relay equipment transshipped by separate classified airlift. The EC-121Ts arrived in Thailand from McClellan AFB on 12 November.

The purpose of the deployment was to provide an integrated tactical data display with real-time inputs (similar to the Navy Airborne Tactical Data System equipping E-1B Tracer platforms of Task Force 77) in support of Operation Kingpin, a mission to rescue US prisoners of war held at Son Tay prison. Once at Korat, some equipment was tested for the first time because of emission restrictions in US airspace and the only available manuals and checklists were notes from early flight tests. Even so, both aircraft were operational by 17 November.

On 20 November 1970, two Warning Stars, using the callsigns Frog 01 and 02, respectively, took off 10 minutes apart at 22:00 from Korat to take station at the low-altitude Alpha orbit over the Gulf of Tonkin, with Frog 02 as a backup. The 17-man crews were advised in the air of the nature of the rescue mission and their role, providing MiG warning and directing USAF F-4 Phantom CAP intercepts. As Frog 01 began its climb to the higher Bravo orbit, it experienced a ruptured oil line forcing shutdown of one engine. As planned, Frog 02 became the primary aircraft when Frog 01 made an emergency landing at Danang.

The new equipment failed to function properly aboard Frog 02. The ground receivers at the command post in Danang failed to receive data and the APX-83 IFF processors would not display aboard the aircraft, despite repeated repairs. Their own radar monitors experienced excessive electronic noise and the jamming of North Vietnamese radars by nearby EKA-3B Skywarriors hindered efforts of the radar technicians to correct the problems. While unable to provide vectoring information to the F-4s escorting the mission, Frog 02 remained on station and relied on its Rivet Top voice intercept capability to provide supplementary data.

===Disco===

In October 1971, North Vietnamese MiGs, operating from forward bases opened after the end of Rolling Thunder, began a campaign to intercept Boeing B-52 Stratofortress missions over southern Laos. On 20 November, a MiG-21 launched air-to-air missiles at a B-52 that evaded by dropping flares. As a result, Warning Stars of Det. 1 returned to Korat RTAFB to provide radar support by flying the Laotian orbit again, using callsign &quot;Disco&quot;. Seven EC-121Ts, replacement aircraft for the earlier series, were based in Thailand and contained both QRC-248 and Rivet Top electronic suites.

When Operation Linebacker began on 10 May 1972, Disco was one of two principal GCI radars used by US forces, although it continued to be handicapped by poor radio communications. In addition, its slow-turning radar limited its value as a controller of fighters during MiG engagements, while the size of USAF raids during Linebacker nearly saturated its capabilities. Improvements made in the systems since 1968 enabled the operators to distinguish MiG types and a color code system for them entered the air operations vernacular: &quot;Red Bandits&quot; (Mig-17s); &quot;White Bandits&quot; (MiG-19s); &quot;Blue Bandits&quot; (MiG-21s), and &quot;Black bandits&quot; (MiGs low on fuel).

On 6 July 1972, as the result of seven F-4 Phantoms shot down in a two-week period, a second Disco track was initiated. Flown near the former Alpha orbit over the Gulf of Tonkin, its purpose was to gain better low-altitude coverage in the Hanoi area. At the end of the month, Disco was also integrated into &quot;Teaball&quot; control center, a highly classified system established to collate all signal intelligence on North Vietnamese air activity gathered by all sources, including nonmilitary. Disco was used as a conduit through which warnings and control vectors were given, but the delay in Teaball acquiring the information and relaying it through Disco (often using an unreliable radio relay KC-135A Combat Lightning aircraft operating under callsign Luzon) cancelled out its value for use in &quot;real time&quot;, and the fact that its existence was kept from US aircrews damaged its credibility. Teaball received direct communications capability, but experienced transmission failures with frustrating frequency. Disco remained the primary backup controller, but its usefulness remained limited because it directly controlled only MiGCAP missions and could only provide its information to strike, chaff, and escort forces via the &quot;Guard&quot; frequency.

On 15 August 1973, Disco EC-121s flew their final combat mission and on 1 June 1974, Det.1 was permanently withdrawn from Southeast Asia. Between 1965 and 1973, the EC-121s flew 13,921 combat missions, more than 98,000 accident-free flying hours, assisted in the shoot-down of 25 MiGs, and supported the rescue of 80 downed flyers. No Big Eye, College Eye, or Disco aircraft were lost.

===Batcat===

During the Vietnam War, some 40 EC-121s were modified from USN WV-2 and WV-3 early warning Constellations for use with ground sensors to detect enemy troop movements along the Ho Chi Minh Trail and 25 were deployed to Korat RTAFB as a part of Operation Igloo White. The resulting EC-121R configuration was nicknamed the Batcat. Two Batcats were lost during the war, with the loss of 22 crewmen, one in a takeoff accident during a thunderstorm in April 1969, the other in September 1969, in a landing accident which also killed four Thai civilians.

Batcat EC-121s were camouflaged in standard tree-color Southeast Asia scheme, while the College Eye/Disco early warning aircraft were not. BatCat missions were 18 hours in length, with 8 hours on station at one of 11 color-coded orbits used during their five-year history, three of which were over South Vietnam, six over Laos, one over Cambodia, and one over the Gulf of Tonkin.

EC-121Rs were operated by the 553d and 554th Reconnaissance Squadrons of the 553d Reconnaissance Wing, between October 1967 and December 1970, with about 20 Batcats on hand at any time. The wing activated in December 1970 and the 554th RS relocated to Nakhon Phanom RTAFB to fly QU-22 sensor monitors nicknamed &quot;Baby Bats&quot;. Initially with 11 aircraft, the 553rd RS continued operations for another year, gradually returning aircraft and crews to the USA. The final Batcat mission was in December 1971. The last remaining administrative and support personnel returned to Otis AFB in January 1972.

== and incidents==

A total of 20 Navy EC-121s were destroyed in accidents, with 113 aircrew deaths:
* 15x WV-2/EC-121K; 3x WV-2Q/EC-121M and 2x WV-3/WC-121N

Another unarmed EC-121M was destroyed in one-sided combat. In April 1969, North Korean Air Force MiG-21 fighter-interceptors shot down an EC-121 in international airspace off the country&#x27;s east coast, killing all of the crew of 31 on board.

The USAF had a total of 11 Warning Stars destroyed in accidents, killing 66 aircrew:

* 2x RC-121C/TC-121C; 2x RC-121D; 3x EC-121H; 3x EC-121R and 1x EC-121T

Three EC-121Hs from the 551st AEWCW were lost—on 11 July 1965, 11 November 1966 and 25 April 1967—resulting in a total of 50 deaths (16, 19, and 15, respectively), including wing commander Col James P. Lyle in the 1967 crash.

The two Batcat EC-121R crashes resulted in 22 killed.

==Surviving aircraft==
;EC-121T
;;On Display

* AF Ser. No. 52-3418 – on display at the Combat Air Museum at Forbes Field (former Forbes AFB) in Topeka, Kansas. The aircraft was delivered to USAF in October 1954 as an RC-121D and redesignated an EC-121D in 1962. It was converted to an EC-121T, but the upper radome has been removed.

* AF Ser. No. 52-3425 – on display at the Peterson Air and Space Museum at Peterson AFB in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Previously assigned to the 966th AEWCS at McCoy AFB, Florida and then the 79th AEWCS at Homestead AFB, Florida. It was delivered to Peterson AFB in October 1978.
* AF Ser. No. 53-0548 – on display at the Yanks Air Museum in Chino, California. It was stored at Camarillo Airport (former Oxnard AFB) while the Yanks Air Museum was working to get it restored and to complete FAA paperwork for a ferry flight. The final maintenance efforts by Yanks Air Museum Restoration Director Frank Wright included a rebuild of engine #4 in early January 2012. 53-0548 departed Camarillo at 12:10PM on Saturday, 14 January 2012 for the 90-minute flight to Chino, where it will become a static display.
* AF Ser. No. 53-0552 – on display at Tinker AFB, Oklahoma.
* AF Ser. No. 53-0554 – on display at the Pima Air &amp; Space Museum, adjacent to Davis-Monthan AFB in Tucson, Arizona.

* AF Ser. No. 53-0555 – on display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio. The College Eye EC-121D is fully restored and on display indoors. This aircraft was nicknamed &quot;Triple Nickel&quot; because of its serial number (53-555). On 24 October 1967, while operating over the Gulf of Tonkin, it guided a U.S. fighter by radar into position to destroy a North Vietnamese Air Force enemy fighter aircraft, a MiG-21. This was the first time a weapons controller aboard an airborne radar aircraft had ever directed a successful attack on an enemy aircraft. &quot;Triple Nickel&quot; was retired to the USAF Museum in 1971.
* AF Ser. No. 52-3417 – in storage at the University of Montana – Helena College of Technology in Helena, Montana.

<doc id="1019195" wikidata="Q5253365" url="?curid=1019195" title="Expenditure minimization problem">
<text>In microeconomics, the expenditure minimization problem is the dual of the utility maximization problem: &quot;how much money do I need to reach a certain level of happiness?&quot;. This question comes in two parts. Given a consumer&#x27;s utility function, prices, and a utility target,
* how much money would the consumer need? This is answered by the expenditure function.
* what could the consumer buy to meet this utility target while minimizing expenditure? This is answered by the Hicksian demand function.

==Expenditure function==
Formally, the expenditure function is defined as follows. Suppose the consumer has a utility function formula_1 defined on formula_2 commodities. Then the consumer&#x27;s expenditure function gives the amount of money required to buy a package of commodities at given prices formula_3 that give utility of at least formula_4,

:formula_5

where

:formula_6

is the set of all packages that give utility at least as good as formula_4.

==Hicksian demand correspondence==
Hicksian demand is defined by
: formula_8 
: formula_9.
Hicksian demand function gives the cheapest package that gives the desired utility. It is related to Marshallian demand function by and expenditure function by
:formula_10
The relationship between the utility function and Marshallian demand in the utility maximization problem mirrors the relationship between the expenditure function and Hicksian demand in the expenditure minimization problem. It is also possible that the Hicksian and Marshallian demands are not unique (i.e. there is more than one commodity bundle that satisfies the expenditure minimization problem); then the demand is a correspondence, and not a function. This does not happen, and the demands are functions, under the assumption of local nonsatiation.

<text>A strange particle is an elementary particle with a strangeness quantum number different from zero. Strange particles are members of a large family of elementary particles carrying the quantum number of strangeness, including several cases where the quantum number is hidden in a strange/anti-strange pair, for example in the Φ meson. The classification of particles, as mesons and baryons, follows the quark/anti-quark and three quark content respectively. Murray Gell-Mann recognized the group structure of elementary particle classification introducing the flavour SU(3) and strangeness as a new quantum number.

<text>Second-in-command (2i/c or 2IC) is a title denoting that the holder of the title is the second-highest authority within a certain organisation.

==Usage==
In the British Army or Royal Marines, the second-in-command is the deputy commander of a unit, from battalion or regiment downwards. This terminology is also used in many other Commonwealth armies and other nations. The equivalent appointment in the United States Army is the executive officer.

The second-in-command of a battalion or regiment is usually a major. The second-in-command of a company, squadron, or artillery battery (in which they are called the battery captain) is usually a captain (although infantry company second-in-commands were usually lieutenants until after the Second World War), the second-in-command of a platoon or troop is the platoon or troop sergeant, and the second-in-command of a section is usually a lance corporal.

In the Royal Navy and Commonwealth navies, the second-in-command of a vessel, regardless of rank, is known as the first lieutenant or executive officer.

== Other uses ==
In common usage, the term refers to a deputy. Its basic meaning is &quot;someone who relieves a commander&quot;.

<doc id="1019222" wikidata="Q3141097" url="?curid=1019222" title="Z-pinch">
<text>In fusion power research, the Z-pinch (zeta pinch) is a type of plasma confinement system that uses an electric current in the plasma to generate a magnetic field that compresses it (see pinch). These systems were originally referred to simply as pinch or Bennett pinch (after Willard Harrison Bennett), but the introduction of the θ-pinch (theta pinch) concept led to the need for clearer, more precise terminology.

The name refers to the direction of the current in the devices, the Z-axis on a Cartesian three-dimensional graph. Any machine that causes a pinch effect due to current running in that direction is correctly referred to as a Z-pinch system, and this encompasses a wide variety of devices used for an equally wide variety of purposes. Early uses focused on fusion research in donut-shaped tubes with the Z-axis running down the inside of the tube, while modern devices are generally cylindrical and used to generate high-intensity x-ray sources for the study of nuclear weapons and other roles. It is one of the first approaches to fusion power devices, along with the stellarator and magnetic mirror.

==Physics==
The Z-pinch is an application of the Lorentz force, in which a current-carrying conductor in a magnetic field experiences a force. One example of the Lorentz force is that, if two parallel wires are carrying current in the same direction, the wires will be pulled toward each other. In a Z-pinch machine the wires are replaced by a plasma, which can be thought of as many current-carrying wires. When a current is run through the plasma, the particles in the plasma are pulled toward each other by the Lorentz force, thus the plasma contracts. The contraction is counteracted by the increasing gas pressure of the plasma.

As the plasma is electrically conductive, a magnetic field nearby will induce a current in it. This provides a way to run a current into the plasma without physical contact, which is important as a plasma can rapidly erode mechanical electrodes. In practical devices this was normally arranged by placing the plasma vessel inside the core of a transformer, arranged so the plasma itself would be the secondary. When current was sent into the primary side of the transformer, the magnetic field induced a current into the plasma. As induction requires a &quot;changing&quot; magnetic field, and the induced current is supposed to run in a single direction in most reactor designs, the current in the transformer has to be increased over time to produce the varying magnetic field. This places a limit on the product of confinement time and magnetic field, for any given source of power.

In Z-pinch machines the current is generally provided from a large bank of capacitors and triggered by a spark gap, known as a Marx Bank or Marx generator. As the conductivity of plasma is fairly good, about that of copper, the energy stored in the power source is quickly depleted by running through the plasma. Z-pinch devices are inherently pulsed in nature.

==History==
===Early machines===

Pinch devices were among the earliest efforts in fusion power. Research began in the UK in the immediate post-war era, but a lack of interest led to little development until the 1950s. The announcement of the Huemul Project in early 1951 led to fusion efforts around the world, notably in the UK and in the US (see Perhapsatron, a z-pinch machine at LANL). Small experiments were built at labs as various practical issues were addressed, but all of these machines demonstrated unexpected instabilities of the plasma that would cause it to hit the walls of the container vessel. The problem became known as the &quot;kink instability&quot;.

===Stabilized pinch===
By 1953 the &quot;stabilized pinch&quot; seemed to solve the problems encountered on earlier devices. Stabilized pinch machines added external magnets that created a toroidal magnetic field inside the chamber. When the device was fired, this field added to the one created by the current in the plasma. The result was that the formerly straight magnetic field was twisted into a helix, which the particles followed as they traveled around the tube driven by the current. A particle near the outside of the tube that wanted to kink outward would travel along these lines until it returned to the inside of the tube, where its outward-directed motion would bring it back into the centre of the plasma.

Researchers in the UK started construction of ZETA in 1954. ZETA was by far the largest fusion device of its era. At the time, almost all fusion research was classified, so progress on ZETA was generally unknown outside the labs working on it. However US researchers visited ZETA and realized that they were about to be outpaced. Teams on both sides of the Atlantic rushed to be the first to complete stabilized pinch machines.

ZETA won the race, and by the summer of 1957 it was producing bursts of neutrons on every run. Despite the researchers&#x27; reservations, their results were released with great fanfare as the first successful step on the path to commercial fusion energy. However, further study soon demonstrated that the measurements were misleading, and none of the machines were near fusion levels. Interest in pinch devices faded, although ZETA and its cousin Sceptre served for many years as experimental devices.

===Fusion-based propulsion===

A concept of Z-pinch fusion propulsion system was developed through collaboration between NASA and private companies. The energy released by the Z-pinch effect would accelerate lithium propellant to a high speed, resulting in a specific impulse value of 19400 s and thrust of 38 kN. A magnetic nozzle would be required to convert the released energy into a useful impulse. This propulsion method could potentially reduce interplanetary travel times. For example, a mission to Mars would take about 35 days one-way with a total burn time of 20 days and a burned propellant mass of 350 tonnes.

===Tokamak===
Although it remained relatively unknown for years, Soviet scientists used the pinch concept to develop the tokamak device. Unlike the stabilized pinch devices in the US and UK, the tokamak used considerably more energy in the stabilizing magnets, and much less in the plasma current. This reduced the instabilities due to the large currents in the plasma, and led to great improvements in stability. The results were so dramatic that other researchers were skeptical when they were first announced in 1968. Members of the still-operational ZETA team were called in to verify the results. The tokamak became the most studied approach to controlled fusion.

=== Sheared-flow stabilized ===
Sheared-flow stabilizing uses one or more high speed annular flowing plasma layers, surrounding a plasma filament, to stabilize the filament against kink and pinch instabilities.

In 2018, a sheared-flow stabilized Z-pinch demonstrated neutron generation. It was built by a fusion company, Zap Energy, Inc., a spin-off from the University of Washington, and funded by strategic and financial investors and grants from the Advanced Research Projects Agency – Energy (ARPA-E). Flow stabilized plasma remained stable 5,000 times longer than a static plasma. A mix of 20% deuterium and 80% hydrogen by pressure, produced neutron emissions lasting approximately 5 μs with pinch currents of approximately 200 kA during an approximately 16 μs period of plasma quiescence. Average neutron yield was estimated to be (1.25±0.45)×105 neutrons/pulse. Plasma temperatures of 1–2 keV (12–24 million °C) and densities of approximately 1017 cm−3 with 0.3 cm pinch radii were measured.

==Experiments==

Z-pinch machines can be found at University of Nevada, Reno (USA), Cornell University (USA), University of Michigan (USA), Sandia National Laboratories (USA), University of California, San Diego (USA), University of Washington (USA), Ruhr University (Germany), Imperial College (United Kingdom), École Polytechnique (France), Weizmann Institute of Science (Israel), Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana (Mexico), NSTRI (Iran).

<text>The repeating crossbow (), also known as the repeater crossbow, and the Zhuge crossbow (, also romanized Chu-ko-nu) due to its association with the Three Kingdoms-era strategist Zhuge Liang (181–234 AD), is a crossbow invented during the Warring States period in China that combined the bow spanning, bolt placing, and shooting actions into one motion.

The earliest archaeological evidence of the repeating crossbow is found in the state of Chu, but it uses a pistol grip that is different from the later and more commonly known Ming dynasty design.

Although the repeating crossbow was in use throughout most of Chinese history until the late Qing dynasty, it was generally regarded as a non-military weapon suited for women, defending households against robbers.

== History ==


According to the &quot;Wu-Yue Chunqiu&quot; (history of the Wu-Yue War), written in the Eastern Han dynasty, the repeating crossbow was invented during the Warring States Period by a Mr. Qin from the State of Chu. This is corroborated by the earliest archaeological evidence of repeating crossbows, which was excavated from a Chu burial site at Tomb 47 at Qinjiazui, Hubei Province, and has been dated to the 4th century BC, during the Warring States Period (475 - 220 BC). Unlike repeating crossbows of later eras, the ancient double-shot repeating crossbow uses a pistol grip and a rear-pulling mechanism for arming. The Ming repeating crossbow uses an arming mechanism that requires its user to push a rear lever upwards and downwards back and forth. Although handheld repeating crossbows were generally weak and required additional poison, probably aconite, for lethality, much larger mounted versions appeared during the Ming dynasty.

In 180 AD, Yang Xuan used a type of repeating crossbow powered by the movement of wheels:
The invention of the repeating crossbow has often been attributed to Zhuge Liang, but he in fact had nothing to do with it. This misconception is based on a record attributing improvements to the multiple bolt crossbows to him.

During the Ming dynasty, repeating crossbows were used on ships.

Although the repeating crossbow has been used throughout Chinese history and is attested as late as 19th century Qing dynasty in battle against the Japanese, it was generally not regarded as an important military weapon. The &quot;Wubei Zhi&quot;, written during the 17th century, says that it was favored by people in southeast China but lacked in strength and its bolts tended not to harm anyone. The functions of the repeating crossbow listed in the text are primarily non-military: tiger hunting, defending fortified houses, and usage by timid men and women. According to the &quot;Tiangong Kaiwu&quot;, also written during the 17th century, the repeating crossbow is only useful against robbers.

== Designs ==


The repeating crossbow combined the actions of spanning the bow, placing the bolt, and shooting into a one-handed movement, thus allowing for a much higher rate of fire than a standard hand-held crossbow. The most common repeating crossbow design originated from the Ming Dynasty and consisted of a top-mounted magazine containing a reservoir of bolts which fed the crossbow using gravity, a rectangular lever attached to both the tiller and the magazine, and a tiller mounting the prods with a stock. By holding the tiller firmly against the hip while pushing and pulling the lever forwards and backwards, the user was able to catch the drawstring on to side notches at the back of the magazine while loading the bolt. A sliding lug nut at the back of the magazine pushed the drawstring out of the notches once the lever is fully pulled backwards; with the tiller pushing the nut up and enabling the drawstring to propel the loaded bolt. The Korean version mounted the magazine at the end of a longer stalk as well as a pivoting recurve bow as a prod; increasing the draw strength, span, range, and performance of the crossbow. Additionally, both the Ming Dynasty in China and the Joseon Dynasty in Korea developed variations that either shot two to three bolts per draw or fired pellets in place of bolts.

An earlier version originated from the State of Chu during the Warring States period used a different design. It consisted of a tiller mounting a fixed double magazine on top as well as a pistol style grip at the bottom beneath the prods mount. Instead of an overhand lever for arming and shooting, it used a sliding lever that had a handle tied to the end with a chord. The lever was pumped forwards and backwards with one hand while the user held the pistol grip firm with the other hand; in a manner similar to drawing a regular bow. Within the crossbow, the lever was embedded with a special metal trigger composed of a latch and sear; the entire trigger being shaped like a crab&#x27;s claw arm. Upon pushing the lever forward, the trigger was moved forward to catch the drawstring and becomes locked firm by friction and tensional forces from grooves inside the mounting lever and sear. Upon being drawn back, the draw string is spanned while the double magazine fed two bolts onto the firing slots on either side of the trigger once the drawstring is almost fully drawn. At the very end of the pulling action, the sear comes in contact with a round bar that holds the sliding lever in place. The bar pushed the sear forward to release the trigger and enable the drawstring to propel the two loaded bolts. Ultimately, it was superseded by the aforementioned design from the Ming Dynasty due to being overly complex with weaker performance.

=== Modern design ===
Another design was more recently manufactured by EK Archery Research, with their Adder Crossbow designed by Jörg Sprave. The crossbow features a magazine to hold five bolts and a self loading arm. The Adder Crossbow, released in 2020, fires at around with a range of 

== Utility ==
The basic construction of the repeating crossbow has remained very much unchanged since its invention, making it one of the longest-lived mechanical weapons. The bolts of one magazine are fired and reloaded by simply pushing and pulling the lever back and forth. 

The repeating crossbow had an effective range of and a maximum range of . Its comparatively short range limited its usage to primarily defensive positions, where its ability to rapidly fire up to 7–10 bolts in 15–20 seconds was used to prevent assaults on gates and doorways. In comparison, a standard crossbow could only fire about two bolts a minute. The repeating crossbow, with its smaller and lighter ammunition, had neither the power nor the accuracy of a standard crossbow. Thus, it was not very useful against more heavily armoured troops unless poison was smeared on bolts, in which case even a small wound might prove fatal.

<text>Zachariah Keodirelang Matthews OLG (20 October 1901 – 11 May 1968) was a prominent black academic in South Africa, lecturing at South African Native College (renamed University of Fort Hare in 1955). Many future leaders of the African continent were among his students.

==Life==

===Early years===
Z.K. Matthews was born in Winter&#x27;s Rush near Kimberley in 1901, the son of a Bamangwato mineworker. Z.K. grew up in urban Kimberley, but maintained close connections with his mother&#x27;s rural Barolong relatives. He went to Mission high school in the eastern Cape where he attended Lovedale. After Lovedale he studied at South African Native College in Fort Hare. In 1923 he wrote the external examination of the University of South Africa.

In 1924, he was appointed head of the high school at Adams College in Natal. Albert Luthuli was also a teacher here. The two men attended meetings of the Durban Joint Council and held office in the Natal Teacher&#x27;s Association, of which Matthews eventually was elected president.

While in Natal, in 1928, he married Frieda Bokwe, daughter of John Knox Bokwe and his wife. He had met her as a student at Fort Hare. Their son, Joe, was born in 1929 in Durban. He later became a prominent politician.

In 1930, after private study, Matthews earned an LLB degree in South Africa, awarded by the University of South Africa. He was admitted to the bar as an attorney and practiced for a short time in Alice, Eastern Cape. In 1933, he was invited to study at Yale University in the United States. There in the following year he completed an MA. He then studied at the London School of Economics, pursuing anthropology under Bronisław Malinowski.

He returned to South Africa in 1935. In 1936 he was appointed Lecturer in Social Anthropology and Native Law and Administration at University of Fort Hare. After Davidson Don Tengo Jabavu’s retirement in 1944, Matthews was promoted to Professor and became head of Fort Hare’s Department of African Studies.

===Political activism===

Matthews did not confine himself to an academic career. He combined his study of anthropology and the law with an active political involvement. He found his true political home in the ANC. He had attended meetings as a boy in the company of Sol Plaatje, a senior relative. He did not become a member until 1940. In 1943, he was elected to the National Executive Committee. At the time he also became a member of the Native Representative Council, a purely advisory body that has been condemned as a “toy telephone”. Matthews found his participation on it to be frustrating, although he found dealing with the Native Education Act of 1945 to be a “valuable experience” for the people he met. In June 1949, Matthews succeeded James Calata as ANC provincial president in the Cape.

In June 1952, on the eve of the Defiance Campaign, he left South Africa for a position as visiting professor at New York&#x27;s Union Theological Seminary.

He returned home in May 1953. Although he did not attend the Congress of the People in 1955, he assisted Lionel &quot;Rusty&quot; Bernstein in drawing up the Freedom Charter that was adopted there. Denis Goldberg credits Matthews with having been one of the driving forces behind the proposal for gathering and documenting the wishes of the people for the Charter.

Matthews was arrested in December 1956, and was one of the accused in the Treason Trial. On his release from the trial in late 1958, he returned to Fort Hare. He resigned his post in protest against the passage of legislation that reduced the university to a status of an ethnic college for the Xhosa community only.

In 1961, Matthews moved to Geneva, Switzerland after being selected as secretary of the Africa division of the World Council of Churches.

In 1966, he accepted the post of ambassador to the United States for the newly independent nation of Botswana. He died in the capital Washington, DC on 11 May 1968.

<text>The Fechner color effect is an illusion of color seen when looking at certain rapidly changing or moving black-and-white patterns. They are also called pattern induced flicker colors (PIFCs).
The effect is most commonly demonstrated with a device known as Benham&#x27;s top (also called Benham&#x27;s disk). When the top is spun, arcs of pale color are visible at different places on the disk that forms its upper surface. The effect can also be seen in stroboscopic lights when flashes are set at certain critical speeds. Rotating fan blades, particularly aluminum ones, can also demonstrate the effect; as the fan accelerates or decelerates, the colors appear, drift, change and disappear. The stable running speed of the fan does not (normally) produce colors, suggesting that it is not an interference effect with the frequency of the illumination flicker.

The effect was noted by Gustav Fechner and Hermann von Helmholtz and propagated to English-speakers through Charles Benham&#x27;s invention of his top. Florence Winger Bagley was one of the early investigators of this phenomenon.

The perceptual mechanism of Fechner color is not entirely understood. One possible reason people see colors may be that the color receptors in the human eye respond at different rates to red, green, and blue. Or, more specifically, that the latencies of the center and the surrounding mechanisms differ for the different types of color-specific ganglion cells.

The phenomenon originates from neural activity in the retina and spatial interactions in the primary visual cortex, which plays a role in encoding low-level image features, such as edges and spatiotemporal frequency components. Research indicates that the blue–yellow opponent process accounts for all the different PIFCs.

Research has been done into the use of Benham&#x27;s top and other PIFCs as diagnostic tools for diseases of the eye and the visual track. It has shown particular promise in detecting optic neuritis.

== Benham&#x27;s top ==

Benham&#x27;s top is named after the English newspaper-man, amateur scientist, and toymaker Charles Benham, who in 1895 sold a top painted with the pattern shown. Benham was inspired to propagate the Fechner color effect through his top after his correspondence with Gustav Theodor Fechner, who had observed and demonstrated the said effect. Benham&#x27;s top made it possible for speakers of the English language to learn of the Fechner color effect, about which Fechner&#x27;s original reports were written in German.

<text>Death of a Ladies&#x27; Man is the fifth studio album by Leonard Cohen, produced and co-written by Phil Spector. The album was in some ways a departure from Cohen&#x27;s typical minimalist style by using Spector&#x27;s Wall of Sound recording method, which included ornate arrangements and multiple tracks of instrument overdubs. The album was originally released in the US by Warner Bros., and on CD and the rest of the world by Cohen&#x27;s long-time label, Columbia Records.

==Background==
By the mid-1970s, both Cohen and Spector were on a downward slide commercially. Although he remained popular in Europe, Cohen had never achieved the success in the United States that Columbia had hoped for. Spector had created hits such as &quot;Be My Baby&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;ve Lost That Lovin&#x27; Feelin&#x27;&quot; with his &quot;wall of sound&quot; production technique in the 1960s, and had some success in the early 1970s by producing albums by John Lennon and George Harrison; however, his behaviour became increasingly erratic.

As Ira Nadel notes in the 1996 Cohen biography, &quot;Various Positions: A Life of Leonard Cohen&quot;, stories differ as to how Cohen and Spector became collaborators:
:The liner notes on the album state that Marty Machat, who was Spector&#x27;s lawyer as well as Cohen&#x27;s, introduced them. According to Cohen, this occurred backstage after one of his performances at the Troubadour in L.A. Spector had uncharacteristically left his well-protected home to see Cohen, and at the show was strangely silent. Spector then invited Cohen back to his home, which, because of the air-conditioning, was very chilly, about &quot;thirty-two degrees,&quot; Cohen recalled...Spector locked the door and Cohen reacted by saying, &quot;As long as we are locked up, we might as well write some songs together.&quot; They went to the piano and started that night. For about a month they wrote (and drank) together and Cohen remembers it as a generous period, although he had to wear an overcoat almost constantly to work in Spector&#x27;s freezing home.

Biographer Anthony Reynolds writes in the 2010 book &quot;Leonard Cohen: A Remarkable Life&quot; that Cohen&#x27;s friend and fellow Canadian songwriter Joni Mitchell tried to warn Cohen about working with Spector, Mitchell having witnessed some of Spector&#x27;s erratic behavior during recording sessions with Lennon in Los Angeles. However, at least at the early songwriting stage, Cohen and Spector worked well together. Songwriter John Prine, who had also witnessed the producer&#x27;s bizarre antics when he had been invited to his house to compose a song together, later marveled to Paul Zollo of &quot;BluebirdRailroad&quot; magazine that as soon as Spector &quot;sat down with an instrument, he was normal.&quot; Things would change once Cohen and Spector entered a studio, with the producer&#x27;s paranoia taking over and Cohen becoming increasingly disengaged from the project.

==Recording==
Spector would use three studios for the album, although his favorite remained the Gold Star Studios complex located at 6252 Santa Monica Boulevard near the corner of Vine Street in Hollywood. Spector recruited a plethora of top-shelf Los Angeles studio musicians to play on the songs, including guitarists Dan and David Kessel, drummers Hal Blaine and Jim Keltner, and pedal steel player Al Perkins, among many others. It was precisely in front of an audience, however, that Spector&#x27;s megalomaniacal switch turned on, and soon Cohen felt overwhelmed. Speaking to &quot;Mojo&quot;&#x27;s Sylvie Simmons in 2001, Cohen described his feelings at the time:
:It was one of those periods when my chops were impaired, and I wasn&#x27;t in the right kind of condition to resist Phil&#x27;s very strong influence on and eventual takeover of the record. There were lots of guns around in the studio and lots of liquor, a somewhat dangerous atmosphere. He had bodyguards who were heavily armed also. He liked guns - I liked guns too but I generally don&#x27;t carry one, and it&#x27;s hard to ignore a .45 lying on the console. When I was working with him alone, it was very agreeable, but the more people in the room, the wilder Phil would get. I couldn&#x27;t help but admire the extravagance of his performance, but at the time couldn&#x27;t really hold my own.&quot;

During a cryptic exchange detailed in Ira Nadel&#x27;s Cohen biography, &quot;Various Positions&quot;, Spector pointed a loaded pistol at Cohen&#x27;s throat, cocked it, and said, &quot;I love you, Leonard.&quot; Quietly, Cohen responded, &quot;I &quot;hope&quot; you love me, Phil.&quot; Nadel also writes that the recording of the nine-minute title track began at 7:30 in the evening and lasted until 2:30 in the morning with the session musicians working on quadruple time, typical of the sessions as a whole. Another night, poet Allen Ginsberg and Bob Dylan showed up and were ordered by Spector to sing background vocals on the raucously burlesque &quot;Don&#x27;t Go Home With Your Hard-on&quot;. Most of the songs deal with themes of unbridled sexuality and brutal voyeurism, such as &quot;Paper Thin Hotel&quot; (&quot;The walls of this hotel are paper thin/Last night I heard you making love to him...&quot;), and are couched in Spector&#x27;s bombastic sprawl of sonic grandeur. The buoyant &quot;Fingerprints&quot; is a fiddle-infused hootenanny that recalls Cohen&#x27;s love of country music. Early versions of &quot;Iodine&quot; (then called &quot;Guerrero&quot;) and &quot;Don&#x27;t Go Home with Your Hard-on&quot; were performed in concert as early as 1975 (with music credited to John Lissauer) and are widely available on bootlegs. As Anthony Reynolds reports in his 2010 Cohen biography, the sessions did not even &quot;officially&quot; end:
:One day Phil just failed to return to the studio, keeping all the tapes (as he had done with Lennon&#x27;s masters) and going on to mix them alone. Cohen was aghast. He did not consider his recorded vocals to be anywhere near definitive. As far as he was concerned they were merely &quot;guide&quot; vocals for the benefit of the musicians. He had expected to be able to take time on his singing but with Spector holding the tapes hostage at an unknown location this now seemed impossible, unless he brought his own bunch of heavies to take on Spector&#x27;s. &quot;I had the option of hiring my own private army and fighting it out with him on Sunset Boulevard or letting it go...I let it go.&quot;

Marty Machat&#x27;s son Steven secured a deal with Warner Bros. to release the record, one that Cohen would always harbor mixed feelings about. &quot;I&#x27;m too ashamed to tell the whole truth of what happened there&quot;, Cohen confessed to Adrian Deevoy of &quot;Q&quot; magazine in 1991. &quot;People were skating around on bullets, guns were finding their way into hamburgers, guns were all over the place. It wasn&#x27;t safe. It was mayhem, but it was part of the times. It was rather drug-driven. But I like Phil, and the instinct was right. I&#x27;d do it again.&quot; Interviewed for the 2005 documentary &quot;I&#x27;m Your Man&quot;, Cohen expressed disappointment in the record and felt that the songs &quot;got away&quot; from him; he also noted that it was a favorite among &quot;punksters&quot; as well as his daughter. At the time of the album&#x27;s release, however, he was much less generous in his public response to the album, calling Spector&#x27;s production &quot;a &#x27;catastrophe&#x27;&quot;. Of the album&#x27;s eight selections, &quot;Memories&quot; is the only track Cohen regularly performed in concert (on tours in 1979, 1980 and 1985). He apparently liked the song enough that he included it in his 1983 experimental art film &quot;I Am a Hotel&quot;, as the sole non-acoustic piece alongside four other songs which have generally enjoyed more positive fan response: &quot;Suzanne&quot;, &quot;Chelsea Hotel #2&quot;, &quot;The Guests&quot;, and &quot;The Gypsy&#x27;s Wife&quot;. A &quot;de-Spectorized&quot; version of &quot;Memories&quot; ended up being released when Cohen&#x27;s album &quot;Field Commander Cohen: Tour of 1979&quot; was issued in 2001. This version includes a saxophone solo different from that of the album version&#x27;s.

In 1978, Cohen would release a book of poetry with the slightly altered title &quot;Death of a Lady&#x27;s Man&quot;. It has nothing in common with the album, with only one exception: it contains the poem &quot;Death of a Lady&#x27;s Man&quot;, which is identical to the lyrics of the album&#x27;s title song.

==Album cover==
The liner notes of the Cohen album disclose that the photo was taken by an &quot;Anonymous Roving Photographer at a Forgotten Polynesian Restaurant&quot;. It features (from left to right) Eva LaPierre, Cohen and Suzanne Elrod, the mother of Adam and Lorca Cohen.

==Reception==
&quot;Death of a Ladies&#x27; Man&quot; was released to universal confusion and largely bad reviews, leaving many die-hard Cohen fans stunned. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; headlined its review with &quot;Leonard Cohen&#x27;s doo-wop Nightmare&quot; and observed, &quot;Too much of the record sounds like the world&#x27;s most flamboyant extrovert producing and arranging the world&#x27;s most fatalist introvert.&quot; The &quot;Toronto Star&quot; declared in large type, &quot;Leonard Cohen is for Musical Sadists&quot;. While defending the album, in a retrospective review AllMusic writer Dave Thompson concedes, &quot;It is also true that a cursory listen to the album suggests that the whole thing was simply a ragbag of crazy notions thrown into the air to see where they landed.&quot; In 2010, Cohen biographer Anthony Reynolds singled out &quot;True Love Leaves No Traces&quot; for praise, describing the song, which Cohen sings with Ronee Blakley, as &quot;incandescently beautiful as anything either man would ever commit to tape&quot;.

==Commercial performance==
Up to 1978, the album was one of Cohen&#x27;s biggest sellers in Sweden.

==Cover versions and live performances==

&quot;Death of a Ladies&#x27; Man&quot; has inspired fewer cover versions than any preceding Cohen album, but both &quot;True Love Leaves No Traces&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Go Home with Your Hard-on&quot; were covered on the Cohen tribute album &quot;I&#x27;m Your Fan&quot;. The songs were performed by Dead Famous People and the duo David McComb &amp; Adam Peters, respectively. &quot;Memories&quot; has also been covered at least five times by other artists, including John Darnielle of The Mountain Goats and Will Toledo of Car Seat Headrest, although the latter modifies the lyrics considerably. &quot;Iodine&quot; earned three known performances in Cohen&#x27;s European tour of 1979. The Last Shadow Puppets performed a version of &quot;Memories&quot; on their autumn 2008 tour. Swedish singer Svante Karlsson mentioned the album title in the song &quot;I Nöd &amp; Lust&quot; (from &quot;Tro Inte Att Du Känner Mig&quot; 2010) in which the female character listens to it in her head phones during a train ride. In 2013, Guitars and Bongos Records released Greg Ashley&#x27;s cover version of the entire Death of a Ladies&#x27; Man album. Kimberly Morrison, a.k.a. &quot;The Duchess&quot; from The Duchess and The Duke! provides some backing vocals. Greg&#x27;s cover photo mimics Cohen&#x27;s original photo, but replaces actual women with two mannequins.

==Book==
Cohen published the book &quot;Death of a Lady&#x27;s Man&quot; in 1978. It has nothing in common with the album, with only one exception: it contains the poem &quot;Death of a Lady&#x27;s Man&quot;, which is identical to the lyrics of the album&#x27;s title song.

In 2009, Scottish author Alan Bissett released his third novel, &quot;Death of a Ladies&#x27; Man&quot;, which makes references to Cohen throughout the text.

<doc id="1019236" wikidata="Q262603" url="?curid=1019236" title="Anthochaera">
<text>Anthochaera is a genus of birds in the honeyeater family. The species are endemic to Australia and include the little wattlebird, the red wattlebird, the western wattlebird, and the yellow wattlebird. A molecular phylogenetic study has shown that the regent honeyeater also belongs in this genus.

==Description ==
Of the five species in the genus only the yellow wattlebird (&quot;Anthochaera paradoxa&quot;) and the red wattlebird (&quot;A. carunculata&quot;) have the wattles of their common name. These are bare fleshy appendages, usually wrinkled and often brightly coloured, hanging from the cheeks, neck or throat, and presumably serving for display.

A common name for species of the genus is wattlebird, a term also used for unrelated avian species.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Anthochaera&quot; was introduced in 1827 by the naturalists Nicholas Aylward Vigors and Thomas Horsfield. The name is derived from the Greek &quot;anthos&quot; meaning flower or bloom and &quot;khairō&quot; meaning to enjoy. The type species was designated as the little wattlebird by the German ornithologist Hans Friedrich Gadow in 1884. 

The regent honeyeater (&quot;Anthochaera phrygia&quot;) was formerly placed in its own genus, &quot;Xanthomyza&quot;, but placed with the &quot;Anthochaera&quot; genus in a 2004 molecular phylogenetic study. The genus &quot;Anthochaera&quot; is sister group to the species &quot;Acanthagenys rufogularis&quot;, the spiny-cheeked honeyeater, separated as a monotypic genus.

== Species and distribution ==
The genus &quot;Anthochaera&quot; contains the following species:

<doc id="1019238" wikidata="Q58396" url="?curid=1019238" title="Imipramine">
<text>Imipramine, sold under the brand name Tofranil, among others, is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) mainly used in the treatment of depression. It is also effective in treating anxiety and panic disorder. Imipramine is taken by mouth.

Common side effects of imipramine include dry mouth, drowsiness, dizziness, low blood pressure, rapid heart rate, urinary retention, and electrocardiogram changes. Overdose of the medication can result in death. Imipramine appears to work by increasing levels of serotonin and norepinephrine and by blocking certain serotonin, adrenergic, histamine, and cholinergic receptors.

Imipramine was discovered in 1951 and was introduced for medical use in 1957. It was the first TCA to be marketed. Imipramine and TCAs other than amitriptyline (which, at least in the U.K., is prescribed comparatively as frequently as SSRIs) have decreased in prescription frequency with the rise of SSRIs—which have fewer inherent side effects and are far safer in overdose. Regardless of its caveats, imipramine retains importance in psychopharmacology and pediatrics (e.g., with childhood enuresis).

==Medical uses==
Imipramine is primarily used for the treatment of depression and certain anxiety disorders, including acute post-traumatic stress reactions. A significant amount of research regarding its efficacy on acute post-traumatic stress in children and adolescents has focused on trauma resulting from burn-injuries.
Although evidence for its efficacy in the treatment of chronic post-traumatic stress disorder appears to be less robust, it remains a viable treatment. Here, it may act fairly similarly to monoamine oxidase inhibitor phenelzine.

Caution is needed in prescribing imipramine (and its commercially-available metabolite, desipramine) in children and youth/adolescents (whether they suffer with, e.g., bed-wetting, recurrent panic attacks, acute trauma or, in the case of desipramine, ADHD), owing to possibility of certain side-effects which may be of particular concern in those under a certain age.

In the treatment of depression, it has demonstrated similar efficacy to the MAOI moclobemide. It has also been used to treat nocturnal enuresis because of its ability to shorten the time of delta wave stage sleep, where wetting occurs. In veterinary medicine, imipramine is used with xylazine to induce pharmacologic ejaculation in stallions. It is also used for separation anxiety in dogs and cats. Blood levels between 150 and 250 ng/mL of imipramine plus its metabolite desipramine generally correspond to antidepressant efficacy.

==Contraindications==
Combining it with alcohol consumption may cause more drowsiness, necessitating greater caution when drinking. It may be unsafe during pregnancy.

Many MAOIs are known to have serious interactions with imipramine. It is often contraindicated during their use or in the two weeks following their discontinuation. This category includes medications such as isocarboxazid, linezolid, methylene blue, phenelzine, selegiline, moclobemide, procarbazine, rasagiline, safinamide, and tranylcypromine.

==Side effects==
These side effects can be contributed to the multiple receptors that imipramine targets such as serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine, acetylcholine, epinephrine, histamine. Those listed in &quot;italics&quot; below denote common side effects, separated by the organ systems that are affected. Some side effects may be beneficial in some cases, e.g. reduction of hyperactive gag reflex; reduced random or physical strain-linked urinary leakage.
* Central nervous system: &quot;dizziness&quot;, &quot;drowsiness&quot;, confusion, seizures, headache, anxiety, tremors, stimulation, weakness, insomnia, nightmares, extrapyramidal symptoms in geriatric patients, increased psychiatric symptoms, paresthesia
* Cardiovascular: &quot;orthostatic hypotension&quot;, &quot;ECG changes&quot;, &quot;tachycardia&quot;, hypertension, palpitations, dysrhythmias
* Eyes, ears, nose and throat: blurred vision, tinnitus, mydriasis
* Gastrointestinal: &quot;dry mouth&quot;, nausea, vomiting, paralytic ileus, increased appetite, cramps, epigastric distress, jaundice, hepatitis, stomatitis, constipation, taste change
* Genitourinary: &quot;urinary retention&quot;
* Hematological: agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, eosinophilia, leukopenia
* Skin: rash, urticaria, diaphoresis, pruritus, photosensitivity

==Overdose==
== Interactions ==

Like other tricyclic antidepressants, imipramine has many medication interactions. Many MAOIs have serious interactions with this medication. Other categories of medications that may interact with imipramine include blood thinners, antihistamines, muscle relaxants, sleeping pills, thyroid medications, and tranquilizers. Some medications used for various conditions such as high blood pressure, mental illness, nausea, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, asthma, colds, or allergies.

Certain medications increase the risk of serotonin syndrome, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), St. John&#x27;s Wort, and drugs such as ecstasy. Other prescription drugs decrease the body&#x27;s ability to eliminate imipramine. These include barbiturates, some antiarrhythmic medications, some antiepileptic drugs, and certain HIV drugs (protease inhibitors). Others may cause changes in the heart rhythm, such as QT prolongation.

Alcohol and tobacco may interact with imipramine. Tobacco may decrease the medication&#x27;s effectiveness.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===

Imipramine affects numerous neurotransmitter systems known to be involved in the etiology of depression, anxiety, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), enuresis and numerous other mental and physical conditions. Imipramine is similar in structure to some muscle relaxants, and has a significant analgesic effect and, thus, is very useful in some pain conditions.

The mechanisms of imipramine&#x27;s actions include, but are not limited to, effects on:
* Serotonin: very strong reuptake inhibition. Imipramine is a tertiary TCA, and is a potent inhibitor of serotonin reuptake, and to a greater extent than secondary amine TCAs such as nortriptyline and despiramine.
* Norepinephrine: strong reuptake inhibition. Desipramine has more affinity to norepinephrine transporter than imipramine.
* Dopamine: imipramine blocks D2 receptors. Imipramine, and its metabolite desipramine, have no appreciable affinity for the dopamine transporter (&quot;K&quot;i = 8,500 and &gt;10,000 nM, respectively).
* Acetylcholine: imipramine is, to a certain extent, an antimuscarinic, specifically a relative antagonist of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. The attendant side-effects (e.g., blurry vision, dry mouth, constipation), however, are somewhat less common with imipramine than amitriptyline and protriptyline, which tend to cause antimuscarinic side-effects more often. All-in-all, however, it is prescribed with caution to the elderly and with extreme caution to those with psychosis, as the general brain activity enhancement in combination with the &quot;dementing&quot; effects of anticholinergics increases the potential of imipramine to cause hallucinations, confusion and delirium in this population. &quot;Anti-cholinergic&quot; side-effects, including urinary hesitancy/retention, may be treated/reversed with bethanechol and/or other acetylcholine-agonists.
Bethanechol may also be able to alleviate the sexual-dysfunction symptoms which may occur in the context of tricyclic-antidepressant treatment.
* Epinephrine: imipramine antagonizes adrenergic receptors, thus sometimes causing orthostatic hypotension.
* Sigma receptor: activity on sigma receptors is present, but it is very weak (Ki = 520 nM) and it is about half that of amitriptyline (Ki = 300 nM).
* Histamine: imipramine is an antagonist of the histamine H1 receptors.
* BDNF: BDNF is implicated in neurogenesis in the hippocampus, and studies suggest that depressed patients have decreased levels of BDNF and reduced hippocampal neurogenesis. It is not clear how neurogenesis restores mood, as ablation of hippocampal neurogenesis in murine models do not show anxiety related or depression related behaviours. Chronic imipramine administration results in increased histone acetylation (which is associated with transcriptional activation and decondensed chromatin) at the hippocampal BDNF promoter, and also reduced expression of hippocampal HDAC5.

===Pharmacokinetics===
 Imipramine has a varied absolute oral bioavailability ranging from 22% to 77%, leading to significant variability in pharmacokinetics. While the drug has rapid and complete absorption after oral administration, much of the drug is affected by first pass metabolism. Food has no effect on absorption, peak drug concentration, or time to peak drug concentration.

Within the body, imipramine is converted into desipramine (desmethylimipramine) as a metabolite.

==Chemistry==
Imipramine is a tricyclic compound, specifically a dibenzazepine, and possesses three rings fused together with a side chain attached in its chemical structure. Other dibenzazepine TCAs include desipramine (&quot;N&quot;-desmethylimipramine), clomipramine (3-chloroimipramine), trimipramine (2′-methylimipramine or β-methylimipramine), and lofepramine (&quot;N&quot;-(4-chlorobenzoylmethyl)desipramine). Imipramine is a tertiary amine TCA, with its side chain-demethylated metabolite desipramine being a secondary amine. Other tertiary amine TCAs include amitriptyline, clomipramine, dosulepin (dothiepin), doxepin, and trimipramine. The chemical name of imipramine is 3-(10,11-dihydro-5&quot;H&quot;-dibenzo[&quot;b&quot;,&quot;f&quot;]azepin-5-yl)-&quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-dimethylpropan-1-amine and its free base form has a chemical formula of C19H24N2 with a molecular weight of 280.407 g/mol. The drug is used commercially mostly as the hydrochloride salt; the embonate (pamoate) salt is used for intramuscular administration and the free base form is not used. The CAS Registry Number of the free base is 50-49-7, of the hydrochloride is 113-52-0, and of the embonate is 10075-24-8.

==History==
The parent compound of imipramine, 10,11-dihydro-5&quot;H&quot;-dibenz[b,f]azepine (dibenzazepine), was first synthesized in 1899, but no pharmacological assessment of this compound or any substituted derivatives was undertaken until the late 1940s. Imipramine was first synthesized in 1951, as an antihistamine. The antipsychotic effects of chlorpromazine were discovered in 1952, and imipramine was then developed and studied as an antipsychotic for use in patients with schizophrenia. The medication was tested in several hundred patients with psychosis, but showed little effectiveness. However, imipramine was serendipitously found to possess antidepressant effects in the mid-1950s following a case report of symptom improvement in a woman with severe depression who had been treated with it. This was followed by similar observations in other patients and further clinical research. Subsequently, imipramine was introduced for the treatment of depression in Europe in 1958 and in the United States in 1959. Along with the discovery and introduction of the monoamine oxidase inhibitor iproniazid as an antidepressant around the same time, imipramine resulted in the establishment of monoaminergic drugs as antidepressants.

In the late 1950s, imipramine was the first TCA to be developed (by Ciba). At the first international congress of neuropharmacology in Rome, September 1958 Dr Freyhan from the University of Pennsylvania discussed as one of the first clinicians the effects of imipramine in a group of 46 patients, most of them diagnosed as &quot;depressive psychosis&quot;. The patients were selected for this study based on symptoms such as depressive apathy, kinetic retardation and feelings of hopelessness and despair. In 30% of all patients, he reported optimal results, and in around 20%, failure. The side effects noted were atropine-like, and most patients experienced dizziness. Imipramine was first tried for treating psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia, but proved ineffective. As an antidepressant, it did well in clinical studies and it is known to work well in even the most severe cases of depression. It is not surprising, therefore, that imipramine may cause a high rate of manic and hypomanic reactions in hospitalized patients with pre-existing bipolar disorder, with one study showing that up to 25% of such patients maintained on Imipramine switched into mania or hypomania. Such powerful antidepressant properties have made it favorable in the treatment of treatment-resistant depression.

Before the advent of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), its sometimes intolerable side-effect profile was considered more tolerable. Therefore, it became extensively used as a standard antidepressant and later served as a prototypical drug for the development of the later-released TCAs. Since SSRIs are superior in terms of inherent side-effect tolerability (although probably inferior in terms of actual efficacy), it has, as of the 1990s, no longer been used as commonly, but is sometimes still prescribed as a second-line treatment for treating major depression. It has also seen limited use in the treatment of migraines, ADHD, and post-concussive syndrome. Imipramine has additional indications for the treatment of panic attacks, chronic pain, and Kleine-Levin syndrome. In pediatric patients, it is relatively frequently used to treat pavor nocturnus and nocturnal enuresis.

<text>The Nova Scotia Supreme Court is a superior court in the province of Nova Scotia.

The Supreme Court consists of 25 judicial seats including the position of Chief Justice and Associate Chief Justice. At any given time there may be one or more additional justices who sit as supernumerary justices. The justices sit in 18 different locations around the province.

==Jurisdiction==
As with all superior courts across the country, the court is said to have inherent jurisdiction. It hears civil and criminal trials. The criminal trials can be judge alone or judge and jury. The court will also hear appeals from the provincial court, small claims court, Family court, and various provincial tribunals.

Appeals of Supreme Court decisions are then made to the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal.

== History ==

While the first court administering the Common Law was established in Annapolis Royal in 1721, the creation of a Supreme Court took place on October 21, 1754, several years before the Province was granted a legislative assembly. The court is the oldest court in Canada and is among the oldest in North America.

Jonathan Belcher was appointed the first Chief Justice of the Nova Scotia Supreme Court. The court&#x27;s jurisdiction extended to the entire colony, which, after the Treaty of Paris ended the war with France in 1763, includes present day Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick and eastern Maine.

In 1990, on the recommendation of the Nova Scotia Court Structure Task Force, the County and Supreme courts were merged to create a bench of 25 judges at the trial level. Since 1999, the Supreme Court also administers the Nova Scotia Family Division Court, with eight judges, that has jurisdiction over divorces and other family law cases in the Halifax and industrial Cape Breton.

==Supreme Court Family Division==
The Supreme Court includes the Family Division which adjudicates matters of family law in the regions of Halifax and Cape Breton. As Supreme Court Justices, they have authority over both divorce as well as all other family law matters, unlike their provincial court counterparts who do not have the federal authority to adjudicate divorces.

<text>Party of the Alliance of Youth, Workers and Farmers of Angola (Pajoca, abbreviation of the ) was an opposition party in Angola. The president of Pajoca was Alexandre Sebastião André and the general secretary was Jesus Kabanga. The party was founded in Luanda, on January 19, 1991. The party was founded by disillusioned MPLA cadres.

Pajoca favoured far-reaching autonomy for the Cabinda enclave.

In the run-up for the 1992 elections, Pajoca was registered with the authorities - having presented 3,998 signatures out of which 2,372 were deemed valid (coming from ten provinces, with more than 100 signature from each province). In the 1992 elections Pajoca received 13,924 votes (0.35%) and got one MP elected, Alexandre Sebastião André. In the presidential election, PAJOCA supported the People&#x27;s Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) candidate.

In 1998 there was internal turmoil in Pajoca, with then president Sebastião Miguel Tetembwa expelling Alexandre Sebastião André. The first party congress was convened, which elected Alexandre Sebastião André as the new president. The congress also approved a new party constitution.

The women&#x27;s organization of Pajoca is known as &quot;Organização da mulher do Pajoca - OMI-PA&quot;.

<doc id="1019263" wikidata="Q3922167" url="?curid=1019263" title="Prison Bound">
<text>Prison Bound is the second studio album by Social Distortion, released in 1988. It was the first album with bass guitarist John Maurer and drummer Christopher Reece. It expands the punk rock sound of the band&#x27;s first album, &quot;Mommy&#x27;s Little Monster&quot; (1983), by adding influences from country music and blues rock.

==Overview==
&quot;Prison Bound&quot; took almost half a decade to materialize, with the initial attempt to record and release the follow-up to &quot;Mommy&#x27;s Little Monster&quot; dating back to 1984. The album was shelved for a few years, and it would not be re-recorded and completed until 1987, following frontman Mike Ness&#x27; recovery from drug addiction and Social Distortion&#x27;s signing to then-independent Restless/Enigma Records. Unlike many of the band&#x27;s albums, no singles were released for this album, but the title track &quot;Prison Bound&quot; received some heavy rotation from commercial radio stations (particularly KROQ-FM), and the song&#x27;s success attracted attention from major labels, including Epic Records, to whom Social Distortion would sign in 1989.

The first track, &quot;It&#x27;s the Law&quot;, is a remake of &quot;Justice for All&quot;, which appeared on the 1981 compilation album &quot;The Future Looks Bright&quot; (and later on the 1995 compilation album &quot;&quot;). It also contains a cover version of &quot;Backstreet Girl&quot;, originally recorded by the Rolling Stones. The album&#x27;s title track references Johnny Cash&#x27;s &quot;I Walk the Line&quot;.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Trouser Press&quot; wrote that &quot;although &quot;Prison Bound&quot; lacks the all-out dynamics of &quot;Monster&quot; ... it’s still a maturely paced, knowing follow-up, and not just for punks.&quot; Nick Robinson, reviewer of British music newspaper &quot;Music Week&quot;, noted band&#x27;s adulting in comparison with early recordings. He found there &quot;upright bursts of aggression, frustration and depression tell a vivid tale of growing up and blues and country influences add depth to this blunt, honest and thrilling account&quot;.

<doc id="1019267" wikidata="Q6152978" url="?curid=1019267" title="Jane and Finch">
<text>Jane and Finch is a neighbourhood located in the northwest end of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, in the district of North York. Centred at the intersection of Jane Street and Finch Avenue West, the area is roughly bounded by Highway 400 to the west, Black Creek to the east, Sheppard Avenue to the south, and Steeles Avenue to the north. Two city neighbourhoods cover the area commonly known as Jane and Finch. From Finch north to Steeles is considered part of the Black Creek community while from Finch south to Sheppard is called Glenfield-Jane Heights.

The Jane and Finch community is a high density and low-income neighbourhood. It is made up of single-family detached and semi-detached houses, along with several high-rise apartment buildings.

== History ==

Jane-Finch was originally the rural community of Elia. The area was developed as a model suburb in the 1960s in response to the rapid urban growth of Toronto. The community was planned to accommodate a socially diverse population and included a substantial amount of public housing, but insufficient thought was given to the social infrastructure needed to sustain community life.

The 1960s development plans spearheaded by the Ontario Housing Corporation (OHC) coincided with North York Planning Department&#x27;s goal of creating a more urban-looking suburb. Known for its series of high-rise buildings and, concomitantly, its above average population density, Jane-Finch experienced astronomical growth from 1961 to 1971 when the population went from 1,300 to 33,000, thereby accounting for more than 40% of the growth in North York. In general, urban planners, local politicians, residents of Jane-Finch, and others today are of the opinion that the OHC and North York erred seriously, contributing to rapid population growth in the area without anticipating its negative consequences.

By 1967, 22.5% of all residential dwellings in the Jane and Finch neighbourhood were designated public housing. Meanwhile, just 3% of North York was designated public housing at the same time. Throughout the 1960s, many of the private and public housing buildings were constructed in the modern architectural style. The high concentration of public housing units, transformed the area into a high-poverty neighbourhood.

In 1973, a group of dedicated residents, politicians and community workers started identifying ways to address community problems. They concentrated their efforts on improving their neighbourhood&#x27;s negative image and creating a sense of community pride. Since then the neighbourhood has developed over 30 grassroots associations, including social and health service organizations, based on principles of mutual aid. Jane-Finch residents managed to create the infrastructure that their community needed to become healthy and sustainable. They succeeded in bringing together various sectors to address a wide range of economic, social and recreational needs. Still, a 1975 study by a planning consulting firm identified the following problems resulting from the rapid growth of the community: overcrowded schools, disconnected social services, inadequate recreation facilities, and a serious issue with youth crime.

In 1983 Jennifer Hodge de Silva, a pioneering filmmaker of the 1970s and 1980s produced the film, &quot;Home Feeling: Struggle for a Community&quot; which revealed tensions between police and area residents.

Between 1981 and 2001, the total population of North York grew by 8.7%; higher economic families by 9%, but poor economic families by 80.5%. Poverty intensified in 5 main areas. The most prominent is the Jane-Finch area, where four poor neighbourhoods turned into regions of very high poverty, and a region that previously had low to moderate poverty became classified as having high levels of poverty. By 2001, a major shift had taken place, with the immigrant family population now accounting for 62.4% of the total family population in these communities, and Canadian born families making up the remaining 37.6%. Between 1981 and 2001, the number of racialized individuals also increased by 219%.

===21st century===
By 2002, the area had &quot;one of the highest proportions of youth, sole-supported families, refugees and immigrants, low-income earners and public housing tenants of any community in Toronto&quot;. That year, only 70% of people in the neighbourhood had proper indoor plumbing (compared to 95% of Canadians), and brownouts were common. Over half of the neighbourhood&#x27;s residents lived below the poverty line. The United Way&#x27;s &quot;Poverty by Postal Code-The Geography of Neighbourhood Poverty: 1981–2001&quot; also highlighted poverty in the city.

The area still grapples with youth crime, with the highest youth crime risk index score of any Toronto neighbourhood, and elevated crime rates. The Canadian government funded a youth program known as Positive Alternatives to Youth Gangs (PAYG) in the neighbourhood. The Toronto City Summit Alliance&#x27;s Strong Neighbourhoods Task Force identified the Black Creek Neighbourhood as one of the 13 Priority Neighbourhoods across the city, where there are not enough social services to address the growing needs of the community. Jane-Finch was one of three Toronto neighbourhoods to address community safety through the Prevention and Intervention Toronto (PIT) program funded by the National Crime Prevention Centre, focuses on youth between the ages of 13 and 24 that are already involved in gangs or at risk of becoming so.

As part of a rebranding strategy in 2008, Toronto City Councillor Anthony Perruzza had banners attached to hundreds of hydro poles in Jane and Finch, calling the area University Heights, due to its proximity to York University, and referencing the existing name of the neighbourhood in municipal planning documents.

In December 2017, an extension of the western branch of the Line 1 Yonge-University subway line was opened, with a station; , at Keele Street, about 1.5km east of the neighbourhood.

Major police raids targeting the neighbourhood&#x27;s gangs have occurred in 2007, 2011 and 2017. According to Toronto&#x27;s police chief, area gangs &quot;have infiltrated various communities&quot; across the province and beyond.

<doc id="1019275" wikidata="Q1173249" url="?curid=1019275" title="Dave Jones (footballer, born 1956)">
<text>David Ronald Jones (born 17 August 1956) is an English former footballer and manager who was most recently the manager of Hartlepool United.

Jones played for Everton, Coventry and Preston North End as a defender. In 1995, he became the manager of Stockport County, guiding the team to a League Cup semi-final and automatic promotion to the second tier of English football in 1997.

He left Stockport to become the manager of Southampton in the Premier League, where he stayed for over 100 games until he was suspended by the club in January 2000, after his arrest on charges of child abuse. When the case came to court, the judge recorded a not guilty verdict. Jones later spoke of his bitterness about the handling of the case and claimed it was the cause of his father&#x27;s death, who had died shortly after the allegations became public.

In 2001, Jones became the manager of Wolverhampton Wanderers, guiding the club to promotion to the Premier League in the 2002–03 season, though they were relegated the following season and he was dismissed by Wolves in November 2004.

Jones had a six-year spell in charge of Cardiff City between 2005 and 2011. They reached the FA Cup final in 2008, losing 1–0 to Portsmouth. Cardiff lost the 2010 Championship Play-off Final 3–2 against Blackpool. After failing to achieve promotion with Cardiff, losing to Reading the following season in a play-off semi-final, Jones was dismissed by the club on 30 May 2011.

He was appointed manager of Sheffield Wednesday on 1 March 2012, guiding the club to finishing second in League One, thus gaining automatic promotion to the Championship. Jones was dismissed by Wednesday in December 2013. After a three-year absence from management, he was appointed manager at Hartlepool United in January 2017.

==Playing career==
Jones started his professional career with Everton in his home city of Liverpool. He played as a defender with the team for seven years, during which time he represented England at youth and under-21 level.

He left Everton to play for Coventry City in 1979 for a transfer fee of £275,000 – after three seasons he picked up a knee injury which threatened to end his football career.

After recovering from this injury, he played two further seasons for Seiko in Hong Kong and one season for Preston North End before retiring. Jones first went to Hong Kong on 2 April 1981 on loan from Coventry City for the remainder of the season, teammate Jim Hagan had already settled in the squad. At the end of the season, Seiko won the league championship for the third time in a row as well as the Hong Kong FA Cup.

After his release from Coventry City, Jones joined Seiko on a permanent basis at the start of the 1982–83 season, playing 22 games for Seiko during the season, including a friendly with a &quot;Brazil Stars Team&quot; on 12 December 1982, the game ended 0–0 and was decided by penalties. Jones took and scored a penalty, but Seiko went on to lose 3–2. He was also selected in the squad of Hong Kong League XI, led by Dutch coach George Knobel, to face French side Monaco on 9 January 1982, which ended in a 1–0 win for the Hong Kong League XI.

After retiring from professional football he went on to become assistant manager to Bryan Griffiths at Southport, where he also made two appearances as a player, before they both left and took up identical roles at Mossley for the 1988–89 season. He made two appearances for Mossley whilst at the club.

==Managerial career==

=== Stockport County ===
In July 1990, he joined Stockport County as a manager for their youth team and took over as first-team manager from Danny Bergara in March 1995. He took the team into the First Division from an automatic promotion place in 1997. He also took the club to the semi-finals of the League Cup where they were narrowly defeated 2–1 on aggregate by Middlesbrough despite an impressive win at the Riverside Stadium. During the same cup run, Stockport also defeated Sheffield United, Blackburn Rovers, Southampton and West Ham United, all of whom were in higher divisions than the club at the time.

=== Southampton ===
This promotion brought him to the attention of Southampton, who offered him a contract to manage their Premier League team. His reign during the 1999–2000 season was rocked by his arrest on charges of child abuse during his employment as a care worker in the late 1980s.

The case put tremendous strain on Jones, who was forced to defend his case on Merseyside whilst managing a team based over 200 miles away on the south coast. In January 2000, Southampton decided to suspend him on full pay until the case was resolved, with Glenn Hoddle taking over his managerial duties.

When the case eventually came to court, it was thrown out in its first week, with the judge recording a not guilty verdict and commenting that the case &quot;should have never reached the trial stage&quot;. Southampton paid off the remainder of Jones&#x27; contract and he left the club. Jones contended that this amounted to unfair dismissal and took the case to industrial tribunal, but Southampton&#x27;s decision was upheld.

=== Wolverhampton Wanderers ===
Jones took over at Wolverhampton Wanderers, signing a three-year contract on 3 January 2001. The side were then sitting 12th in the First Division, after a poor first half to the season under Colin Lee. Results continued to remain indifferent though and the side eventually finished 12th.

The summer of 2001 saw Jones undertake a large overhaul of the playing squad in the pursuit of promotion. He spent over £7 million – the largest spending in the club&#x27;s history in one transfer period – bringing in the likes of Nathan Blake, Colin Cameron, Mark Kennedy, Alex Rae and Shaun Newton. Additional firepower was also later purchased in Kenny Miller and a cut-price Dean Sturridge.

The only major disappointment from the players Jones signed as he rejuvenated Wolves was Belgian striker Cédric Roussel, a £1.5million signing from Coventry City in February 2001. Roussel was one of the most expensive players ever signed by Wolves but he played just 27 times and scored twice in 18 months.

Jones&#x27;s new-look team quickly made an impact, hitting the top of the league by late September, and remaining in the automatic promotion spots over the following months. He won the Division One &quot;Manager of the Month Award&quot; in February 2002, as part of a sequence of ten wins from eleven games. By mid-March, they sat in second place, with an eleven point lead over their arch-rivals and nearest challengers West Bromwich Albion.

However, the final nine games saw Wolves take just ten points from 27 available, while Albion, in contrast, won eight of their final ten fixtures to overtake their rivals and pip them to promotion on the final day of the season. Jones suffered more disappointment when his side compounded their poor end to the campaign by losing their play-off semi-final to Norwich City.

The following season proved a similar rollercoaster ride for Jones. Inconsistent early form left them well off the pace for automatic promotion and a dismal Christmas period saw him under increasing pressure as they weren&#x27;t even in the playoff zone. An FA Cup win over top flight Newcastle United seemed to reverse fortunes though, and his side lost just two of their remaining twenty games to finish fifth, in the play-off zone. The FA Cup run lasted until the quarter-finals.

They overcame Reading in the semi-finals and 3–0 victory over Sheffield United in the final at Millennium Stadium, Cardiff, saw Jones become the manager who returned Wolves to the top level of English football for the first time since 1984, and the man who achieved the chairman Jack Hayward&#x27;s ambition of Premier League football after eleven years, millions of pounds spent on players and four previous managers.

Jones had just £4 million to spend in the summer preparing for Premier League football. However, the team was significantly weakened by long-term injuries to Joleon Lescott and Matt Murray, and began the season missing several other key components of their promotion campaign. The side endured a very poor start to the campaign, shipping nine goals in two games, and remaining winless until their eighth match. Although, he oversaw several impressive results – most notably defeating a full strength Manchester United 1–0 in the league on 17 January 2004 – his side was mired in the relegation zone for almost all the season and was duly relegated in 20th place with 33 points. They only won eight league games all season, and failed to win a single away game.

Their relegation was effectively confirmed on 1 May despite an impressive win over Everton, which left them needing a mathematical miracle to finish outside the bottom three, and the following weekend their survival became mathematically impossible.

Jones aimed for an immediate return to the Premier League in 2004–05, but had to begin the season once again under a cloud of injuries. His squad was now ageing, with most of the players bought as experienced pros in 2001 still forming the core. The side failed to live up to expectations and managed just four wins from the first fifteen games, leaving them 17th. As pressure mounted, he was sacked on 1 November 2004, after a final loss against a Gillingham side reduced to ten men, a side who had been on the receiving end of a 6–0 Wolves victory in their previous meeting just before the promotion 18 months earlier.

=== Cardiff City ===
During Jones&#x27; first season in charge of Cardiff City, they achieved a respectable 11th place in the Championship. Re-building over the summer of 2006, Jones forged a talented side who found themselves at the top of the Championship. However, after a strong start, poor form later in the season led to Cardiff City finishing the season in 13th.

On 29 September 2007, Jones was sent to the stands during a league match against Barnsley after criticising referee Phil Dowd over a penalty decision. He was formally charged with misconduct on 2 October. Jones countered by claiming: &quot;I was angry with the referee because I think he was the only person in the stadium that didn&#x27;t think it was a penalty. He didn&#x27;t make a big call.&quot;

He also complained that Dowd ordered him into a section of the stadium containing Barnsley fans and feared that his safety had been put at risk. He faced an FAW hearing about the incident and was found guilty, resulting in a two-match touchline ban, which he served in the Championship match against Plymouth Argyle and the third round FA Cup tie against Chasetown.

On 9 March 2008, Jones led Cardiff to their first FA Cup semi-final tie since 1927 after beating Premier League side Middlesbrough 2–0 in the quarter-finals. On 6 April, Cardiff City beat Barnsley 1–0 at Wembley to book an FA Cup Final place against Portsmouth. Cardiff City lost the final, played on 17 May 2008, with the only goal of the game being scored by Nwankwo Kanu for Portsmouth after 37 minutes.

The start of the 2008–09 season saw veterans Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, Robbie Fowler and Trevor Sinclair released and the sales of some of the team&#x27;s biggest assets in Glenn Loovens and Aaron Ramsey. Despite this, Jones brought in several new faces and by November Cardiff found themselves in a play-off spot, earning Jones the Championship manager of the month for October. However, after spending the majority of the season in a play-off position, the side missed out on the final day of the season after suffering a 1–0 defeat against Sheffield Wednesday. Despite missing out on the play-offs, Jones had led Cardiff to their highest league position for 38 years.

The start of the 2009–10 season saw Cardiff in top form, beating Scunthorpe United 4–0 putting them top. In the first five games, Cardiff were only in the top two until a 1–0 defeat against Newcastle United which put Cardiff eighth. On 7 November 2009, Jones earned the Championship Manager of the Month for October, the same day Cardiff lost the first South Wales derby 3–2 at Liberty Stadium. At the end of the season, Jones took Cardiff to their highest finish in the league in 39 years, fourth place, meaning they would take part in the play-offs. Cardiff beat Leicester at the Walkers Stadium 1–0, thanks to Peter Whittingham&#x27;s free kick but lost the second leg 3–2, resulting in extra time. The match eventually went to penalties with Cardiff winning 4–3. In the Play-off Final at Wembley, Cardiff suffered a 3–2 defeat to Blackpool.

In the 2010–11 season, Cardiff started the season with four wins out of five games. By the end of October, Cardiff had only lost two games and Jones received the October Championship Manager of the Month, whilst leading scorer Jay Bothroyd won Player of the Month. The club suffered a big loss of form in November and December, with only two wins out of nine games. They finished the season in fourth place behind rivals Swansea City. Cardiff then faced fifth placed Reading in the play-off semi-final, where they lost 3–0 on aggregate.

Jones was later sacked from Cardiff City on 30 May 2011.

===Sheffield Wednesday===
Jones was appointed Sheffield Wednesday boss on 1 March 2012, replacing Gary Megson who was sacked the day before.

His first official game in charge was against Bury and Wednesday came out 4–1 winners, the following game ended with a 3–0 win after three goals in the first ten minutes. After leading Wednesday to five wins and a draw during his first month in charge, Jones was awarded League One Manager of the Month for March 2012. Jones then led Wednesday to another five wins and a draw during his second month in charge and was awarded the Manager of the Month award for April 2012. On 5 May 2012, Jones led Wednesday to promotion from Football League One to the Championship after beating Wycombe Wanderers 2–0.

Jones&#x27; first game in charge of Sheffield Wednesday in the Championship was a 2–2 draw away to Derby on 18 August 2012. Two home wins in the next two matches and a League Cup victory over Premier League side Fulham saw Jones stretch his unbeaten start as Sheffield Wednesday manager to eighteen matches. Jones&#x27; first defeat eventually came on 1 September 2012 after eighteen games unbeaten, a 2–1 loss away to Crystal Palace. Jones returned to his former side Cardiff for the first time as Sheffield Wednesday manager on 2 December 2012, losing 1–0.

In February 2013, Jones was fined £2,000 and given a one-match touchline ban by the FA for misconduct after a fracas on the touchline with Brighton &amp; Hove Albion coach Charlie Oatway during Wednesday&#x27;s 3–1 victory over Brighton. Jones later said that he disagreed with his fine and described Oatway as a &quot;nobody&quot;.

Jones was dismissed on 1 December 2013, with the club second from bottom in the Championship, having won only one league match all season.

===Hartlepool United ===
On 18 January 2017, Jones returned to football management when he joined Hartlepool United of League Two. Jones joined with the North-East club 19th in the table and four points clear of the relegation zone. Jones lost his first game as Pools manager 3–1 to bottom of the table side Newport County. Hartlepool&#x27;s form deteriorated further, winning only 13 points from a potential 51, and left the club by mutual consent on 24 April 2017.

During Jones&#x27; last match in charge of Hartlepool, club president Jeff Stelling urged him to quit, in an impassioned speech on &quot;Soccer Saturday&quot;, following a home defeat to Barnet which had placed Hartlepool in the bottom two. Notified of this public criticism afterwards, Jones told reporters that Stelling showed a &quot;lack of respect&quot; and accused him of being &quot;hypocritical&quot;, having been in his office when Hartlepool had gone five games without a loss.

Upon Jones&#x27; departure, Hartlepool striker Billy Paynter criticised the manager&#x27;s tactics. Despite Hartlepool winning their final game of the season against Doncaster Rovers, a late goal from Newport consigned Pools to relegation from the Football League for the first time after joining in 1921.

===Post-Hartlepool===
In April 2018, Jones applied for the role of head coach of the Malaysian national team but was unsuccessful.

Jones began working as a consultant at Bury in July 2019. His first task with the club was helping them to appoint Paul Wilkinson as manager. Jones left Bury following the club&#x27;s expulsion from the Football League in August 2019.

==Acquittal of child abuse==
In June 1999, Jones was formally questioned by police over alleged sexual abuse at St George&#x27;s School in Formby, Merseyside, a home for children with educational and behavioural problems, where he had been employed as a care worker from 1986 to 1990. After voluntarily attending the police station, he was arrested then questioned, before being released on bail without charge.

He was subsequently charged on 27 September with nine offences against young boys of indecent assault and child cruelty. He denied all the allegations and stated he was &quot;confident that [his] innocence will be established in due course&quot;. He appeared before Merseyside Magistrates Court on 2 November 1999, where he formally pleaded not guilty to all charges and was granted bail.

The case reached Liverpool Crown Court in December 2000, by which time Jones had left Southampton. He stood trial on an eventual 21 charges, which was swiftly reduced to 14, after two other alleged victims pulled out of proceedings on the eve of the trial. After a further alleged victim declined to appear or refused to give evidence, the judge directed the jury during the fourth day of proceedings to return a formal not guilty verdict on four charges relating to the absent party. After decreeing a retrial would not be &quot;just&quot; on the remaining charges, the judge recorded not guilty verdicts on the remaining ten charges. Jones was cleared of all allegations.

One of the key alleged victims was later found to have fabricated their claim of abuse in Jones&#x27; and other cases brought from Operation Care – the police investigation into child abuse – to win compensation. Jones himself later spoke bitterly of the handling of the case and claimed it was the cause of his father&#x27;s death, who had died shortly after the allegations became public.

<text>The Elan Valley () is a river valley situated to the west of Rhayader, in Powys, Wales, sometimes known as the &quot;Welsh Lake District&quot;. It covers of lake and countryside.

The valley contains the Elan Valley Reservoirs and Elan Village, designed by architect Herbert Tudor Buckland as part of the same scheme. Elan Village is the only purpose-built Arts and Crafts &quot;Model Village&quot; in Wales.

It is also famous for its picturesque scenery. Over 80% of the valley is designated as Sites of Special Scientific Interest, and a popular cycle trail, the Elan Valley Trail, makes a loop from Rhayader around the reservoirs. Part of the trail overlaps with a spur of National Cycle Route 81 (&quot;Lon Cambria&quot;).

As of 2015 it is an International Dark Sky Park.

<doc id="1019278" wikidata="Q6828900" url="?curid=1019278" title="Michael Bryant (politician)">
<text>Michael J. Bryant (born April 13, 1966) is a Canadian lawyer and former politician. He was the CEO of Legal Aid BC from January 2022 to April 2024. Previously, he was executive director and general counsel for the Canadian Civil Liberties Association.

Bryant was a Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario, representing the downtown Toronto riding of St. Paul&#x27;s from 1999 to 2009. He was a senior member of Dalton McGuinty&#x27;s provincial cabinet, first as Attorney General, being the province&#x27;s youngest-ever to hold that post, and subsequently as Minister of Aboriginal Affairs, Minister of Economic Development and Government House Leader.

Bryant left provincial politics to take up the newly created post of chief executive officer of Invest Toronto, a municipal agency with a mandate to attract investment and facilitate economic development. An altercation with a cyclist in 2009 led to Bryant being charged for the cyclist&#x27;s death; the charges were withdrawn in 2010.

==Background==
Bryant was raised in the Greater Victoria area of British Columbia, where his father Ray was mayor of Esquimalt from 1966 to 1969. Known for his &quot;pugnacious streak&quot;, he trained as a boxer from childhood.

He received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of British Columbia in 1988, and a Master&#x27;s degree from the same institution in 1989. Bryant was also a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity at UBC. He graduated as in 1992 from Osgoode Hall Law School at York University in Toronto with a law degree. and was the silver medalist of his year. He then earned an LL.M. &quot;magna cum laude&quot; from Harvard Law School in 1994. Bryant is a Fulbright Fellow. He clerked at the Supreme Court of Canada in 1992–93, and was later a lawyer at the firm of Sullivan &amp; Cromwell in New York City, as well as lecturing in law at King&#x27;s College London in England, and practicing litigation at McCarthy Tétrault. In 1997, he became an adjunct professor in international law at the Department of Political Science at the University of Toronto.

Bryant was married to Susan Abramovitch, an entertainment lawyer, and they have two children, Sadie and Louis. The couple separated in December 2010.

==Politics==
Bryant was elected to the Ontario legislature in the provincial election of 1999, defeating incumbent Progressive Conservative cabinet minister Isabel Bassett in St. Paul&#x27;s by almost 5,000 votes. Earlier, Bryant became the Liberal Party&#x27;s nominee by defeating future premier Kathleen Wynne, 328 votes to 143. The Progressive Conservative government was re-elected, and Bryant served in Opposition Critic to the Attorney General for the next four years.

He was re-elected by a greater majority in the provincial election of 2003. The Liberals won a majority government in this election, and Bryant was appointed Ontario Attorney General and Minister with responsibility for Native Affairs and Democratic Renewal. While Attorney General he helped create Ontario&#x27;s controversial Stunt Driving law, aimed at reducing street racing, and supported seizing and crushing vehicles that had been modified for street racing. Bryant was also a strong proponent of a complete ban on handguns in Canada, at one point launching a website named &quot;No Gun, No Funeral&quot;.

Bryant was re-elected in the 2007 election. He was appointed as Minister of Aboriginal Affairs and Government House Leader on October 30, 2007. On September 18, 2008, he became Minister of Economic Development, replacing Sandra Pupatello.

On May 23, 2009, Bryant announced that he would leave provincial politics to become CEO of the newly established Invest Toronto corporation, with Dalton McGuinty taking over his portfolio of Economic Development. Bryant denied that his departure was as a result of a falling out with McGuinty, though reports suggested that Bryant&#x27;s outspoken nature and ambition for the Premier&#x27;s job may have been controversial within McGuinty&#x27;s inner circle. Bryant&#x27;s resignation was effective June 7, 2009. Eric Hoskins retained the seat for the Liberals in a by-election held on September 17, 2009.

===Cabinet positions===


==2009 criminal charges==

On September 1, 2009, Bryant was taken into police custody after an altercation with cyclist Darcy Allan Sheppard on a downtown Toronto street which resulted in Sheppard&#x27;s death. Bryant was later charged with criminal negligence causing death and dangerous driving causing death with respect to the incident. On May 25, 2010, prosecutor Richard Peck withdrew all charges against Bryant stemming from the incident, noting there was &quot;no reasonable prospect of conviction&quot;.

===Incident===
On the evening of August 31, 2009, Bryant and his wife were driving home in his convertible after celebrating their 12th wedding anniversary. They passed a cyclist, Darcy Allan Sheppard, who according to an interview with Bryant was tossing garbage and holding up traffic by executing figure eights on his bike. As they neared a pedestrian crossing Sheppard pulled in front of Bryant&#x27;s vehicle at a red light. Subsequent events were captured by security cameras.

According to Bryant, his vehicle stalled when he stopped behind Sheppard. Bryant&#x27;s car then lurched forward from his attempts to restart the vehicle, which brought the car close to or in contact with Sheppard&#x27;s tire. Camera footage of the incident was inconclusive. The Crown suggested no damage to the bicycle&#x27;s rear wheel rim was evident. Witnesses said that Sheppard confronted Bryant and his wife &quot;loudly and aggressively&quot; while they &quot;remained passive&quot;. Bryant&#x27;s next driving maneuver resulted in Sheppard ending up on the hood of the car: the car travelled 30 feet in 2.5 seconds, at between 9 and 13.4 km/h, and brakes were applied after 1 second. According to Bryant, he was looking down at the time, trying to restart the vehicle, and applied the brakes when he saw Sheppard on the hood. The Crown suggested that there was no evidence Sheppard was seriously injured at this time and there was not enough evidence to justify a separate charge based upon Bryant&#x27;s driving to this point.

The fatality occurred when Bryant drove away while Sheppard was holding onto the side of the vehicle. Witnesses reported that Sheppard reached into Bryant&#x27;s convertible and grabbed either Bryant or the car&#x27;s steering wheel.
At no point did Bryant attempt to stop. The car then veered into the opposite lanes, which caused Sheppard to strike a roadside fire hydrant. The collision knocked him off the car and his head hit the pavement. Bryant drove away from the scene to a nearby hotel. Three minutes later, he called 9-1-1. Sheppard later died of his injuries in hospital. The police did not thoroughly investigate whether Bryant was driving under the influence.

===Aftermath===

Bryant was released the next day by the police on his own recognizance without a bail hearing. In a public statement, he maintained that he was innocent of the charges and extended condolences to Sheppard&#x27;s family. The terms of Bryant&#x27;s release required him to abstain from driving, surrender his passport and remain in Ontario. He was represented by Marie Henein. Bryant also resigned as CEO of Invest Toronto, saying that the arrest would act as a distraction for the corporation.

Bryant&#x27;s actions and arrest were a subject of controversy in Canadian media. Bryant hired a public relations firm, Navigator Ltd., while a campaign emerged on blogs and social networks that attempted to cast Sheppard in a favourable light. A Twitter account run by Navigator was countered by another Twitter account set up by public relations professional Don Wiedman. On YouTube, an anonymous user posted videos of the surveillance footage broadcast by CTV News, CityTV News, and CBC News.

The Ministry of the Attorney General appointed British Columbia&#x27;s Richard Peck as the prosecutor to avoid any conflict-of-interest, as Bryant had appointed judges when he served as Attorney General of Ontario. His first court date was scheduled for October 19, 2009. The matter was adjourned six times.

On May 25, 2010, prosecutor Richard Peck withdrew all charges against Bryant stemming from the incident, noting there was &quot;no reasonable prospect of conviction&quot;. Peck said that &quot;[Bryant] was attacked by a man who unfortunately was in a rage. [Bryant] was legally justified in his attempt to get away&quot;, and noted that Sheppard had run-ins with six other motorists in the same month before his encounter with Bryant, and was witnessed throwing traffic cones in front of cars at the corner of Bloor and Yonge less than twenty minutes before the incident. The decision to withdraw charges was criticised by Marli Epp, a spokesperson for the Toronto Bike Messenger Association and Yvonne Bambrick, Executive Director of the Toronto Cyclists Union.

In August 2012, Bryant published a book, &quot;28 Seconds&quot;, his memoir of Sheppard&#x27;s death and of Bryant&#x27;s own experience with and recovery from alcoholism.

==Later life==
In December 2009, Bryant returned to the private practice of law and joined Norton Rose LLP (formerly Ogilvy Renault) as Senior Advisor and was involved with commercial and investment matters relating to energy, natural resources and infrastructure/public-private partnerships. In 2012 he moved to the Ishkonigan, a consulting and mediation firm owned by Phil Fontaine, where he accepted a position as a principal.

In 2015 he began to work for Legal Aid Ontario as a criminal defence duty counsel. In 2016, he was working in partnership with King Law Chambers as a criminal defence lawyer for the indigent and indigenous, and negotiating aboriginal land claims for First Nations. In 2018 he was appointed executive director and general counsel for the Canadian Civil Liberties Association.

In October 2021, he was appointed chief executive officer of Legal Aid BC. His term began January 17, 2022. He left the post in April, 2024.

<doc id="1019279" wikidata="Q1935683" url="?curid=1019279" title="Mommy's Little Monster (album)">
<text>Mommy&#x27;s Little Monster is the debut studio album by American punk rock band Social Distortion, released in 1983 through the label 13th Floor Records. The album is notably different from the band&#x27;s subsequent releases, featuring styles of traditional punk rock, both traditional hardcore and melodic hardcore, and pop-punk. This is Social Distortion&#x27;s only studio album to feature bassist Brent Liles and drummer Derek O&#x27;Brien, both of whom were out of the band by early 1984 and would be replaced by John Maurer and Chris Reece respectively. The album received underground acclaim from punk rock fanzines, and it has been acknowledged as influential and inspirational to the then-burgeoning pop-punk and skate punk scenes.

==Background==
In 1982, Social Distortion took part in the tour with Youth Brigade (as chronicled in the documentary &quot;Another State of Mind&quot;). &quot;Mommy&#x27;s Little Monster&quot; was recorded at the Casbah in Fullerton, California, on December 24, 1982. They recorded the album in a single session for numerous hours to cut down studio costs.

==Reissues==
&quot;Mommy&#x27;s Little Monster&quot; was reissued several times, with different formats and labels. The album was originally released on vinyl LP in 1983 on 13th Floor Records, a label owned by their manager at the time, Monk Rock.

The Triple X Records label reissued the album on CD, vinyl, and cassette in 1989. Six years later, &quot;Mommy&#x27;s Little Monster&quot; was re-issued once again when Ness started Time Bomb Recordings with some of the profits he made from Social Distortion&#x27;s Epic releases and reissued &quot;Mommy&#x27;s Little Monster&quot; on vinyl, cassette and CD through a distribution deal with Arista Records. A third reissue was released in 2010 on Epitaph Records in Europe and the United Kingdom. A gramophone picture disc version of &quot;Mommy&#x27;s Little Monster&quot; was released in 2001.

==Reception==

Paul Tinelli of AllMusic gave &quot;Mommy&#x27;s Little Monster&quot; four out of five stars and called it &quot;the epitome of early-&#x27;80s suburban California punk and provided inspiration for many future Californians, including the Offspring and Rancid&quot; and said that it &quot;finds the band supplying plenty of attitude and aggression as they rip through nine tracks worth of hard, fast, power chord-filled tracks loaded with snarling anti-establishment lyrics and themes.&quot; Tinelli also stated that &quot;The Creeps&quot; and &quot;Telling Them&quot; &quot;show a young punk group that is very angry, and they were going to let society know it whether they wanted to hear it or not&quot;, and adds that the title track &quot;Mommy&#x27;s Little Monster&quot; &quot;gives you a good idea of the characters Social Distortion was surrounded by in the scene of the day.&quot;

In a 1984 Trouser Press review, Don Howland said, &quot;Cruising on a buzz of non-stop stun guitar and Ness&#x27; smoky deadpan vocals, this catchy-as-dermatophytosis punk pop is a surprisingly sophisticated product of the LA underground. Ness proves to be one of current punks better songwriters.&quot; Howland concluded that calling the album an &quot;instant classic...sounds about right.&quot;

Tim Yohannan of &quot;Maximumrocknroll&quot; said &quot;You&#x27;ve got to know by now what Social Distortion sound like—those distinctive vocals, the harmonies, the rockin&#x27; guitars, and melodic hooks galore. Their album is filled with more of the same. Nothing here is too frantic except &#x27;The Creeps&#x27;, which really blazes forth. There&#x27;s precious little exciting punky-pop around these days, but this is one of the rare examples of it.&quot;

==Track listing==


Earlier versions of &quot;All the Answers&quot; and &quot;Moral Threat&quot; were originally recorded in 1981 and can be heard on the 1995 compilation &quot;&quot;.

==Personnel==
* Mike Ness (as Michael Ness) – vocals, guitars
* Dennis Danell – guitars
* Brent Liles – bass guitar
* Derek O&#x27;Brien – drums, backing vocals

<doc id="1019282" wikidata="Q20436" url="?curid=1019282" title="Foligno">
<text>Foligno (; Southern Umbrian: &quot;Fuligno&quot;) is an ancient town of Italy in the province of Perugia in east central Umbria, on the Topino river where it leaves the Apennines and enters the wide plain of the Clitunno river system. It is located south-east of Perugia, north-north-west of Trevi and south of Spello.

While Foligno is an active bishopric, one of its civil parishes, San Giovanni Profiamma, is the historical site of the former bishopric of Foro Flaminio, which remains a Latin Catholic titular see.

Foligno railway station forms part of the main line from Rome to Ancona, and is the junction for Perugia; it is thus an important rail centre, with repair and maintenance yards for the trains of central Italy, and was therefore subjected to severe Allied aerial bombing in World War II, responsible for its relatively modern aspect, although it retains some medieval monuments. Of its Roman past no significant trace remains, with the exception of the regular street plan of the centre. Other resources include sugar refineries and metallurgical, textile, building materials and paper and timber industries. After the war, the city&#x27;s position in the plain and again its rail connections have led to a considerable suburban spread with the attendant problems of traffic and air pollution, as well as a severe encroachment on the Umbrian wetlands. Foligno is on an important interchange road junction in central Italy and away from the centre of the city there is the Foligno Airport.

== History ==

Foligno seems to have been founded by Umbrians in the pre-Roman period (probably 8th century BC). It was conquered by the Romans after the Battle of Sentinum in 295 BC, receiving the name of &quot;Fulginiae&quot; from the ancient cult of the goddess Fulginia. In the classic Roman age the city acquired importance first as a municipium, later as the seat of a prefecture and finally as a &quot;Statio principalis&quot; of road traffic along the ancient Via Flaminia.

The city began to decay in the late Roman Empire years: after the fall of the latter, Fulginiae became part of the Duchy of Spoleto, and was sacked by the Saracens in 881 and ruined by Magyars in 915 and again in 924: its inhabitants therefore decided to move, settling around the nearby &quot;Civitas Sancti Feliciani&quot; (former &quot;Castrum Sancti Feliciani&quot;), a church strengthened by walls where the Bishop and martyr Feliciano was buried in the 3rd century AD and which was then already populated. The new seat had also attracted people from Forum Flaminii (now San Giovanni Profiamma), a neighbouring city and former bishopric that had been destroyed by the Lombards under Liutprand but remains a Latin Catholic titular see.
Foligno recovered and continued to grow, ultimately gaining the status of free city in 1165 thanks to emperor Frederick Barbarossa. Siding first with the Guelph party, after its occupation by Corrado Guiscardo, a captain of emperor Frederick II, it became Ghibelline as a fierce rival of the Guelph Perugia. It changed hands often during the wars of the 13th century, until 1305 when it was seized from the Ghibelline Anastasi by the powerful Guelph family of the Trinci, acting as semi-independent deputies of the Holy See. During this period Foligno flourished and reached the height of its wealth and, especially in the 15th century, was a centre of art thanks to the family&#x27;s patronage of arts (exemplified by the Palazzo Trinci). It controlled a large territory, including Assisi, Bevagna, Giano, Montefalco, Nocera and Spello.

When Corrado Trinci turned against the Papal authority, Pope Eugene IV sent a force against Foligno in 1439, led by Cardinal Giovanni Vitelleschi. The inhabitants opened their gates and Corrado was beheaded in 1441 in the castle of Soriano. Henceforth Foligno belonged to the Papal States until 1860, with the exception of the Napoleonic era, when it was part of the Roman Republic (1799) then of the French Empire (1809‑1814). The citizens took an active part in the Risorgimento wars, and on 14 September 1860 Savoy troops took the city and annexed it to the Kingdom of Italy.

It has suffered from several major earthquakes, among which those of 1832 and 1997.

== Main sights ==
Main attractions of the city include:
*&quot;Palazzo Comunale&quot;, built in the 13th century and rebuilt various times during the 16th and the 17th centuries. Its present Neo-Classical façade was carried out between 1835 and 1838. The bell tower is still the original from the 13th century.

*Adjoining the&quot; Palazzo Comunale&quot; is the &quot;Palazzo Orfini&quot;, built in Renaissance style, where the first printing shop opened by Emiliano Orfini around 1470. An inscription on the current façade (built in 1507) commemorates the printing in April 1472 of Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; here by Johann Neumeister, a former pupil of Gutenberg.
*Cathedral of San Feliciano or &quot;Duomo&quot; (1133–1201), episcopal see of the present Diocese of Foligno : a Romanesque building (the interior, however, was completely reworked in the 18th century). There is a copy of original Saint Peter&#x27;s baldachin designed by the Italian sculptor and architect Gian Lorenzo Bernini.
*Santa Maria Infraportas, the oldest church in town, although the present edifice dates to the 11th century.
*The Church of San Giacomo dates from 1402.
*Trinci Palace (1389–1407), which houses an archaeological museum, the city&#x27;s picture gallery, a multimedia museum of Tournaments and Jousts and the Civic Museum. The façade was rebuilt in Neoclassicist style after the earthquakes in 1831–1832. It houses frescoes from the early 15th century, some attributed to Gentile da Fabriano.
*&quot;Ospedale Vecchio&quot; : a stately Renaissance building (1517–1520) with an eleven-arch portico on the Corso Cavour
*&quot;Palazzo Cantagilli&quot; (15th century), Palazzo Morotti (17th century) and Palazzo Roncalli (16th century) on the Corso Cavour
*&quot;Church of S. Agostino&quot; (18th century) : brickwork façade with four Corinthian columns (on the Piazza Garibaldi)
*&quot;Church of S. Salvatore&quot; (12th century): the façade (14th century) was built with alternating rows of red and white stone and has three ogival portals. (on the Piazza Garibaldi)
*&quot;Church of the Suffragio&quot; (18th century) was built with a Greek cross-layout and an Ionic style façade.
*&quot;Oratory of Nunziatella&quot;, built in Renaissance style by (attributed to) Francesco di Bartolomeo da Pietrasanta after a miraculous event in 1489. The rectangular oratory contains two altars on the back wall and one altar on each sidewall with paintings from several periods. Its most famous painting is &quot;Baptism of Jesus&quot; by Perugino (1507), commissioned by Giovanni Battista Morganti. A fragment of the miraculous image of the Virgin was enclosed in a tabernacle of gilded wood. It was placed in front of a fresco by Giovanni Antonio Pandolfi da Pesaro (1575), representing the Holy Spirit among angels with St. Feliciano and the Blessed Pietro Crisci. The sacristy contains a damaged fresco of the Pietà, recently attributed to Giannicola di Paolo. In the same room stands the printing press on which the first edition of Dante&#x27;s Divina Commedia was printed on 11 April 1472.
*The &quot;Abbey of Sassovivo&quot;, to the east, with cloisters of 1229 with pairs of small columns supporting arches, and Cosmatesque decorations.

== Culture ==
The name of Foligno was famous for a noteworthy school of painting in the 15th century, and its name is carried by the &quot;Madonna of Foligno&quot;, now in the Vatican, was painted by the Urbinate artist Raphael for the nobleman Sigismondo di Comitibus.

The first printed edition of Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divina Commedia&quot; was printed in the Orfini Palace at Foligno on 5 and 6 April 1472 by Johannes Neumeister and Evangelista Mei, when the sheets for 300 copies were made.

The city is also notable as the birthplace of St Angela of Foligno (1248–1309).

== Quarters ==
The historical centre of Foligno is traditionally divided into twenty &quot;rioni&quot; (&quot;quarters&quot;). Only ten of those are officially recognized and can take part in the Giostra della Quintana :

*Ammanniti
*Badia
*Cassero
*Contrastanga
*Croce Bianca
*Giotti
*La Mora
*Morlupo
*Pugilli
*Spada

Ten &quot;defunct&quot; &quot;rioni&quot; have been absorbed by the ones above: Borgo, Fonte del Campo, Cipischi, Croce, Falconi, Feldenghi, Franceschi, Menacoda, Piazza Vecchia and Spavagli.

The Giostra della Quintana is a knight ring jousting tournament based on a historical event. It takes place in the town of Foligno. Actually the challenges take place in June (1st Challenge) during a Saturday night and September (the counter-challenge) the 2nd or 3rd Sunday of September.
The definition of Quintana comes from the 5th road of the Roman military Camps, where the soldiers were trained to the lance fighting. They run against a dummy-soldier, trying to catch a ring hanging from an arm of the dummy. Here the origin of the tournament&#x27;s name, but the first definition and documented &quot;Quintana&quot; as a knights&#x27; jousting tournament during a festival, dates back to 1448. Since then, Foligno&#x27;s &quot;Quintana&quot; was held uninterruptedly every year. In 1946 the actual &quot;Giostra della Quintana&quot; was reborn. In 1613 the Priors included the Quintana in the events of Carnival festivals, and all has been historically documented. There are ten knights, each representing a quarter of the town. Rushing at gallop, they have to catch 3 rings having smaller size at each tournament. The rings are hanging from a rotating statue represent Mars, the Roman God of War. The statue is in oak original dating back until 1613 (17th century) having a shield and a straight arm. A number of happenings involve the whole town and a parade of 800 persons dressed in original-like precious dresses walk in the town the day before the joust takes place.

<text>Belita Karen Woods (October 23, 1948 – May 14, 2012) was a lead singer of the late 1970s R&amp;B group Brainstorm. She also performed with Parliament-Funkadelic for two decades, beginning in 1992.

Brainstorm had a disco hit in 1977 called &quot;Lovin&#x27; Is Really My Game&quot;. Their follow-up album, 1978&#x27;s &quot;Journey to the Light&quot;, featured a more soul-funk sound, anchored by the album tracks &quot;We&#x27;re On Our Way Home&quot; and &quot;If You Ever Need To Cry&quot;. Prior to joining Brainstorm, Woods released a single &quot;Magic Corner&quot;/&quot;Grounded&quot; on Detroit&#x27;s Moira label in 1967.

She recorded briefly with the psychedelic soul group The Undisputed Truth in 1990, when original members Joe Harris and Brenda Joyce Evans reformed the group for Ian Levine and his Motown revival label Motorcity Records. She is female lead singer on their 1991 single, a recorded version of the group&#x27;s 1973 song &quot;Law of the Land&quot;.

Woods began touring with the P-Funk All-Stars in 1992. In 2001 she sang on four songs (&quot;Scratched&quot;, &quot;When Jack Met Jill&quot;, &quot;Relax&quot;, &quot;Tempovision&quot;) on French DJ/producer Étienne de Crécy&#x27;s &quot;Tempovision&quot; album. The song &quot;Scratched&quot; was produced by fellow P-Funk mate Michael &quot;Clip&quot; Payne, who also sang on the song &quot;Tempovision&quot;. She had three solo songs on George Clinton&#x27;s &quot;How Late Do U Have 2BB4UR Absent?&quot;, released in 2005: &quot;Don&#x27;t Dance Too Close&quot;, &quot;More Than Words Can Say&quot; and &quot;Saddest Day&quot;.

Woods died of heart failure on May 14, 2012. She was 63.

<doc id="1019285" wikidata="Q4652458" url="?curid=1019285" title="ALWD Guide to Legal Citation">
<text>ALWD Guide to Legal Citation, formerly ALWD Citation Manual, is a style guide providing a legal citation system for the United States, compiled by the Association of Legal Writing Directors. Its first edition was published in 2000, under editor Darby Dickerson. Its seventh edition, under editor Carolyn V. Williams, was released in May 2021 by Aspen Publishing. The &quot;ALWD Guide to Legal Citation&quot; is published as a spiral-bound book as well as an online version. 

It primarily competes with the &quot;Bluebook&quot; style, a system developed and still updated by law reviews students at Harvard, Yale, University of Pennsylvania, and Columbia. Citations in the two formats are essentially identical. &quot;ALWD&quot; primarily focuses on citations for legal and court documents while the Bluebook focuses on academic writing, although both manuals provide citation guidance for both kinds of writing.

==Adoption==

Three U.S. jurisdictions have adopted &quot;ALWD&quot;:
* United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit
**This court accepts citations in either &quot;ALWD&quot; or &quot;Bluebook&quot; format, but also requires that citations to United States Supreme Court decisions provide both official &quot;U.S.&quot; and West&#x27;s &quot;S.Ct.&quot; citations, when available.
* United States District Court for the District of Montana
**This court specifically accepts either &quot;ALWD&quot; or &quot;Bluebook&quot;.

<text>In photography and cinematography, a multiple exposure is the superimposition of two or more exposures to create a single image, and double exposure has a corresponding meaning in respect of two images. The exposure values may or may not be identical to each other.

==Overview==
Ordinarily, cameras have a sensitivity to light that is a function of time. For example, a one-second exposure is an exposure in which the camera image is equally responsive to light over the exposure time of one second. The criterion for determining that something is a double exposure is that the sensitivity goes up and then back down. The simplest example of a multiple exposure is a double exposure without flash, i.e. two partial exposures are made and then combined into one complete exposure.
Some single exposures, such as &quot;flash and blur&quot; use a combination of electronic flash and ambient exposure. This effect can be approximated by a Dirac delta measure (flash) and a constant finite rectangular window, in combination. For example, a sensitivity window comprising a Dirac comb combined with a rectangular pulse, is considered a multiple exposure, even though the sensitivity never goes to zero during the exposure.

==Historical multiple exposure photography==

In the historical technique of chronophotography, dating back to the Victorian era, a series of instantaneous photographs were taken at short and equal intervals of time. These photographs could be overlayed for a single multiple exposure print.

==Multiple exposure techniques==
===Analogue===

In photography and cinematography, multiple exposure is a technique in which the camera shutter is opened more than once to expose the film multiple times, usually to different images. The resulting image contains the subsequent image/s superimposed over the original. The technique is sometimes used as an artistic visual effect and can be used to create ghostly images or to add people and objects to a scene that were not originally there. It is frequently used in photographic hoaxes.

It is considered easiest to have a manual winding camera for double exposures. On automatic winding cameras, as soon as a picture is taken the film is typically wound to the next frame. Some more advanced automatic winding cameras have the option for multiple exposures but it must be set before making each exposure. Manual winding cameras with a multiple exposure feature can be set to double-expose after making the first exposure.

Since shooting multiple exposures will expose the same frame multiple times, negative exposure compensation must first be set to avoid overexposure. For example, to expose the frame twice with correct exposure, a −1 EV compensation have to be done, and −2 EV for exposing four times. This may not be necessary when photographing a lit subject in two (or more) different positions against a perfectly dark background, as the background area will be essentially unexposed.

Medium to low light is ideal for double exposures. A tripod may not be necessary if combining different scenes in one shot. In some conditions, for example, recording the whole progress of a lunar eclipse in multiple exposures, a stable tripod is essential.

More than two exposures can be combined, with care not to overexpose the film.

===Digital===
Digital technology enables images to be superimposed over each other by using a software photo editor, such as Adobe Photoshop or the GIMP. These enable the opacity of the images to be altered and for an image to be overlaid over another. They also can set the layers to multiply mode, which &#x27;adds&#x27; the colors together rather than making the colors of either image pale and translucent.

Many digital SLR cameras allow multiple exposures to be made on the same image within the camera without the need for any external software. And some bridge cameras can take successive multiple exposures (sometimes up to nine) in one frame and in one shot. It is the same with high-dynamic-range imaging, which takes multiple shots in one burst captures, then combines all the proper shots into one frame.

==Adoption in fine art==
In addition to direct photographic usage of the technique, fine artists&#x27; work has been inspired by the multiple exposure effect. Examples include Joan Semmel&#x27;s oil on canvas &quot;Transitions&quot; from 2012, and Ian Hornak&#x27;s acrylic on canvas &quot;Hanna Tillich&#x27;s Mirror: Rembrandt&#x27;s Three Trees Transformed Into The Expulsion From Eden&quot;, from 1978 (depicted below).

==Long exposures==
With traditional film cameras, a long exposure is a single exposure, whereas with electronic cameras a long exposure can be obtained by integrating together many exposures. This averaging also permits there to be a time-windowing function, such as a Gaussian, that weights time periods near the center of the exposure time more strongly. Another possibility for synthesizing long exposure from a multiple exposure is to use an exponential decay in which the current frame has the strongest weight, and previous frames are faded out with a sliding exponential window.

==Scanning film with multiple exposure==
Multiple exposure technique can also be used when scanning transparencies like slides, film or negatives using a film scanner for increasing dynamic range. With multiple exposure the original gets scanned several times with different exposure intensities. An overexposed scan lights the shadow areas of the image and enables the scanner to capture more image information here. Afterwards the data can be calculated into a single HDR image with increased dynamic range.

Among the scanning software solutions which implement multiple exposure are VueScan and SilverFast.

<text> () is a bronze sculpture made by Niels Hansen Jacobsen (1861–1941).

The sculpture was modelled between 1895 and 1896. The plaster edition was exhibited at the Charlottenborg Spring Exhibition in 1897. A bronze cast was ordered by brewer Carl Jacobsen in 1901–02. It was originally placed in front of Jacobsen&#x27;s Church in Valby, Copenhagen, now known as Jesus Church (&quot;Jesuskirken&quot;), but was too controversial for the parish, so it was moved to the garden of the art museum Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek. In 1923, a copy was erected in front of the Vejen Art Museum. In 2002, the church wanted the sculpture back, but the Glyptotek would not part with it, so a copy was made, and placed in front of the church.

The name of the statue is taken from a story in Norse folklore where the hero hides in the troll&#x27;s castle. Thereafter, whenever the troll enters the castle, he cries: &quot;I smell a Christian man&#x27;s blood!&quot;

<text>Barb Jungr (born 9 May 1954) is an English singer, songwriter and theatre writer, who has recorded versions of songs by Bob Dylan, Sting, Elvis Presley, Bruce Springsteen and Leonard Cohen.

==Career==
Barb Jungr was born in Rochdale, Lancashire, England, to immigrant parents. Her father, Miroslav Jungr, was a Czech scientist who moved to Britain as a refugee after World War II and after incarceration in German work camps. Her mother, Ingrid, was a German nurse. The eldest of three siblings, she grew up in Stockport, Cheshire, where she attended Stockport Convent School for Girls before earning a degree from Leeds University. 

Arriving in London in the mid-1970s, Jungr worked with playwright Pam Gems and composer Paul Sand, appearing as the singer at the Edinburgh Festival production of Gem&#x27;s play &quot;Dead Fish&quot;, which became &quot;Dusa Fish Stas and Vi&quot;. Jungr&#x27;s first single was &quot;He&#x27;s Gone&quot;, as the Stroke, released by CBS, was single of the week in &quot;New Musical Express&quot; and was written and recorded with her husband Dan Bowling.

She formed the Three Courgettes with Michael Parker and Jerry Kreeger and performed new wave versions of gospel songs in the Kings Road and Portobello Market in the late 1970s. The band was discovered by Island Records, then toured with Kid Creole and the Coconuts, Sade, Mari Wilson, and the Jets. The Three Courgettes recorded a Christmas song for Michael Zilkha&#x27;s &quot;A Christmas Record&quot;.

She formed the duo Jungr and Parker with blues guitarist Michael Parker. For thirteen years they performed internationally and appeared regularly on British television and radio. They hosted the BBC Radio 2 series &quot;We Stayed in with...Jungr and Parker&quot; with specials recorded at the Edinburgh Festival and produced by Sonia Beldom. Jungr and Parker toured with Alexei Sayle and Arnold Brown, with whom they won a Perrier Award in Edinburgh in 1987 at the Gilded Balloon Theatre, and toured nationally and internationally with Julian Clary, appearing with him in the West End at the Aldwych Theatre and on Channel 4 television in &quot;Sticky Moments&quot; and &quot;Terry and Julian&quot;.

In 1991, Jungr and Parker performed in a Festival of European music in Sudan funded by the British Council. The success of that trip led to them performing and giving workshops in Cameroon, Tanzania, Malawi, and Burma. Jungr wrote about these experiences for the &quot;Guardian Diary&quot;, &quot;Folk Roots&quot;, and &quot;The Singer&quot;, and in 1994 enrolled in a masters program at Goldsmiths College in ethnomusicology for which she received a Distinction. She specialised in the Voice and Singing. During that time Jungr began to embark on solo shows, accompanied by Russell Churney, and started a solo career with the release the album &quot;Bare&quot;, which was recorded in a day, live at the Conway Hall with the support of Overtones Studios.

In the early 1990s, Jungr developed themed shows which have become her speciality: &quot;Hell Bent Heaven Bound&quot; (with Ian Shaw, Christine Collister and Michael Parker) was Perrier Pick of the Fringe, &quot;Money the Final Frontier&quot; (with Helen Watson, Christine Collister and Michael Parker) was invited to the Canadian Music Festivals.
In 1998 she toured with the show &quot;Sex, Religion and Politics&quot; directed by Julia Pascal, appearing at the 1998 Edinburgh Festival. With composer James Tomalin she contributed &quot;Jackie&quot; to the Jacques Brel compilation album and &quot;Fear of a Red Planet&quot;.

In 1999, Jungr was invited to record for Linn Records in Glasgow. In 2000 Linn released &quot;Chanson: The Space in Between&quot;, an album of English translations of classic French chansons. In 2002, she released &quot;Every Grain of Sand&quot;, an album of arrangements of Bob Dylan&#x27;s songs, followed by &quot;Waterloo Sunset&quot; in 2003.

Appearing in a New York season at the Flea Theatre in 2002, she was given the Backstage Bistro Award in 2003 for Best International Artist. In 2004 she recorded &quot;Love Me Tender&quot;, an album of songs recorded by Elvis Presley for release in March 2005, followed by &quot;Walking in the Sun&quot; (2006) featuring guitarist Eric Bibb.

In 2007, Jungr collaborated with British composer Mark Anthony Turnage, appearing with the London Sinfonietta in the commissioned piece &quot;About Water&quot; at Queen Elizabeth Hall to celebrate the reopening of the Festival Hall.

In 2008, she released &quot;Just Like a Woman – Hymn to Nina&quot; featuring the repertoire of Nina Simone and was given a Nightlife Award in New York in 2008 for Outstanding Cabaret Vocalist.

In March 2010, she released &quot;The Men I Love – The New American Songbook&quot; . She performed a second season at the Cafe Carlyle in the Carlyle Hotel in New York. In 2010 Jungr released &quot;Man in the Long Black Coat: Barb Jungr Sings Bob Dylan&quot;. In 2012 she released &quot;Stockport to Memphis&quot;.

In March 2014, Jungr released &quot;Hard Rain: the songs of Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen&quot; and toured the UK with a season at the 59E59 Theater in New York. The album won Best Cabaret CD from BroadwayWorld.com.

Other collaborations include composer Jonathan Cooper on his &quot;Moon Behind the Clouds&quot; song cycle, the cabaret show &quot;Girl Talk&quot; with Mari Wilson and Claire Martin, and Gwyneth Herbert which toured intermittently for ten years and the trio Durga Rising with tabla player Kuljit Bhamra and pianist Russell Churney.

During 2015, her collaborations included performances with John McDaniel on both sides of the Atlantic.

Since 2015, she has recorded and toured on both sides of the Atlantic with pianist Laurence Hobgood, with whom she recorded &quot;Shelter from the Storm&quot; (2016) featuring three original compositions alongside songs by Bob Dylan, Leonard Cohen, Joni Mitchell, Rodgers and Hammerstein, David Bowie, Stephen Sondheim, Bruce Springsteen, and Peter Gabriel.

In early 2016, Jungr was a featured artist in James Gavin&#x27;s Lincoln Center songbook series celebrating Peggy Lee. The following year, Jungr penned a short introduction for Playerist Poetry Magazine for its themed edition on Music.

Jungr acted in British director Robina Rose&#x27;s film &quot;Nightshift&quot;, playing the bar girl. For Debbie Isitt&#x27;s Snarling Beastie Theatre Company she composed music for &quot;The Woman who Cooked Her Husband&quot; at the Royal Court Upstairs and &quot;Matilda Liar&quot; at the Tricycle Theatre. She appeared in Isitt&#x27;s &quot;10 by 10&quot; for BBC Television. In 2002 the British Council supported Jungr&#x27;s three-week run at the Flea Theatre in New York.

Jungr has presented, written, and researched many programmes for national BBC Radio 2, (three series of &quot;We Stayed in with Jungr and Parker&quot; and two Edinburgh Specials), BBC Radio 3 (For Heavy Entertainment two programmes on Persian music &quot;Sweet Lips Dark Eyes&quot; and two on Ethiopian music &quot;Shaking Shoulders and Honey Beer&quot; ), BBC Radio 2 (writer and presenter of &quot;The Hoppings&quot; two-hour arts special for Soundbite Productions) and BBC Radio 4 (Malawi Diary producer Paul Dodgson) and in Canada for CBC, as a regular contributor to &quot;The Global Village&quot; as well as contributing to many BBC arts programmes including &quot;Woman&#x27;s Hour&quot;, &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot;, &quot;Saturday Review&quot;, &quot;Saturday Live&quot;, and &quot;A Good Read&quot;.

Jungr coached the young offenders in vocal delivery for Brian Hill&#x27;s Bafta-winning film &quot;Feltham Sings&quot;. She created the voice course at London Metropolitan University and formed and ran the Raise the Roof Horseman Choir (which she founded) for several years.

In 2012, she created the song cycle &quot;Deep Roots Tall Trees&quot; for the Core Theatre at Corby, with local musicians, songwriters, and poets, which culminated in a concert at Corby football ground in August 2014 incorporating local musicians, the Deep Roots Tall Trees Choir, and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Antony Weedon. This concert started the Made in Corby Arts Council England initiative.

<text>Tadeusz Różewicz (9 October 1921 – 24 April 2014) was a Polish poet, playwright, writer, and translator. Różewicz was in the first generation of Polish writers born after Poland regained its independence in 1918, following the century of foreign partitions. He was born in Radomsko, near Łódź, in 1921. He first published his poetry in 1938. During World War II, he served in the Polish underground Home Army. His elder brother, Janusz, also a poet, was executed by the Gestapo in 1944 for serving in the Polish resistance movement. His younger brother, Stanisław, became a noted film director and screenwriter.

==Biography and career==

Tadeusz Różewicz was the son of Władysław and Stefania Różewicz (née Gelbard, a Jewish convert to Catholicism). After finishing high school, Różewicz enrolled at Jagiellonian University in Kraków. He then served in World War II. After the war, he moved to Gliwice, where he lived for the following two years. In 1968, he moved to Wrocław, where he lived for the rest of his life.

Różewicz wrote and published fifteen volumes of poetry between 1944 and 1960. Czesław Miłosz wrote a poem dedicated to Różewicz and his poetry in 1948. Różewicz&#x27;s debut as a playwright was in 1960, with &quot;The Card Index&quot; (&quot;Kartoteka&quot;).

He wrote over a dozen plays and several screenplays. His dramaturgical work continued to be accompanied by volumes of poetry and prose. Some of Różewicz&#x27;s best known plays, other than &quot;The Card Index,&quot; include: &quot;The Interrupted Act&quot; (&quot;Akt przerywany&quot;, 1970), &quot;Birth Certificate&quot; (&quot;Świadectwo urodzenia&quot;, screenplay to an award-winning film by the same title, 1961), &quot;Left Home&quot; (&quot;Wyszedł z domu&quot;, 1965), and &quot;The White Wedding&quot; (&quot;Białe małżeństwo&quot;, 1975). His &quot;New Poems&quot; collection was nominated for the National Book Critics Circle Award in 2008.

Różewicz&#x27;s works have been translated into nearly all major languages. Two of his plays were translated into English and produced at La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club in New York City during the 1960s and 1970s. In 1965, Karen Cross and Johan Holm directed a series of Różewicz&#x27;s three short plays, collectively titled &quot;The Witnesses&quot;. A &quot;Village Voice&quot; review of the production reads: The first play, the most abstract, is a string of metaphors meant... to convey a view of man&#x27;s condition... The second play presents a young married couple at breakfast planning their day. They work very hard at it, as if a night of sleep cuts them off drastically from life and contact must be reestablished. By means of a forced calm, a dedicated attention to trivia, and a patronizing attitude toward other people, they organize the day&#x27;s activity... The key to the piece is the husband&#x27;s matter-of-fact account, as he watches at the window, or two children tormenting and then destroying a kitten... The children quite coldly mutilate and murder the animal and the husband blandly but not indifferently reports the event to his wife who isn&#x27;t listening. In the third play two men facing in opposite directions have a conversation of sorts. Constantly demanding attention of each other, they deliver up monologues of self-revelation which reveal next to nothing and on top of it are not being listened to. Through it all an injured dog suffers an elaborate death agony at the feet of one of the men, whose only response is to intersperse his fatuous self-revelations with bulletins on the progress of the dog&#x27;s demise.&quot; In 1972, Mavis Taylor directed a production of Różewicz&#x27;s &quot;The Old Woman Broods&quot;. The piece was partially funded by the New York State Council on the Arts and was performed at the College of White Plains, Hudson River Museum, and Community Action Program in Mamaroneck in addition to La MaMa&#x27;s theatre in the East Village, Manhattan.

Różewicz has been regarded as &quot;one of the most versatile and creative continuators of the Polish and international avant-garde&quot;. He was a member of the Polish Writers&#x27; Union and was nominated multiple times for the Nobel Prize in Literature. In 1987, he received the Golden Wreath at the Struga Poetry Evenings festival in Struga, Macedonia. In 2000, Różewicz received Poland&#x27;s top literary prize, the Nike Award, for his book &quot;Matka odchodzi&quot; (&quot;Mother Is Leaving&quot;).

Różewicz died in Wrocław from natural causes on 24 April 2014 from. He was 92.

==In pop culture==
Slovenian punk band Niet used parts of Rozewicz&#x27;s poem &quot;Pierwsza miłość&quot; and recreated it in their 1984 punk balade &quot;Lep dan za smrt&quot; (&quot;A Nice Day for Death&quot;). Filmmaker Werner Herzog paraphrased a line from Rozewicz&#x27;s &quot;Draft of a Modern Love Poem&quot; in his 2007 film &quot;Encounters at the End of the World&quot;, observing that &quot;For me, the best description of hunger is a description of bread. A poet said that once, I think.&quot; In 2008, mainstream Slovenian band Dan D remade the Niet&#x27;s song for what was to become one of the 2008 top hits on Slovenian radio stations.

<doc id="1019308" wikidata="Q1524947" url="?curid=1019308" title="Kir (cocktail)">
<text>Kir is a French cocktail made with a measure of crème de cassis (blackcurrant liqueur) topped up with white wine.

In France it is usually drunk as an apéritif before a meal or snack. Originally made with Bourgogne Aligoté, a Burgundy white wine, today it is made with various white wines throughout France, according to the region and the barkeeper. Many prefer a white Chardonnay-based Burgundy, such as Chablis.

Formerly known as blanc-cassis, the beverage is now named after Félix Kir (1876–1968), mayor of Dijon in Burgundy. Kir was a pioneer of the twinning movement in the aftermath of the Second World War, and popularized the drink by offering it at receptions to visiting delegations. Besides treating his international guests well, he was also promoting two economic products of the region. Kir allowed one of Dijon&#x27;s producers of crème de cassis to use his name, then extended the right to their competitors as well. According to Rolland (2004), the reinvention of blanc-cassis (post-1945) was necessitated by the German Army&#x27;s confiscation of all the local red Burgundy during the war. Faced with an excess of white wine, Kir renovated a drink that used to be made primarily with red.

Following the commercial development of crème de cassis in 1841, the cocktail became popular in regional cafés, but has since become inextricably linked internationally with the name of Mayor Kir. When ordering a Kir, waiters in France sometimes ask whether the customer wants it made with crème de cassis, &quot;de mûre&quot; (blackberry), &quot;de pêche&quot; (peach), or &quot;framboise&quot; (raspberry).

The International Bartenders Association gives a recipe using 1/10 crème de cassis, though French sources typically specify about 1/5. Meanwhile, 19th-century recipes for blanc-cassis recommended 1/3 crème de cassis, which modern tastes would find cloyingly sweet. Replacing the crème de cassis with blackcurrant syrup is discouraged.

==Variations==
Besides the basic Kir, a number of variations exist:

* Cidre royal – made with cider instead of wine, with a measure of Calvados added
* Communard, or cardinal – made with red wine instead of white
* Hibiscus royal – made with sparkling wine, peach liqueur, raspberry liqueur, and an edible hibiscus flower
* Kir Berrichon – from the Berry region of France. Made with red wine and blackberry liqueur (&quot;crème de mûre&quot;)
* Kir bianco – made with sweet white vermouth instead of wine.
* Kir Breton – made with Breton cider instead of wine.
* Kir impérial – made with raspberry liqueur (such as Chambord) instead of cassis, and champagne
* Kir Normand – made with Normandy cider instead of wine.
* Kir pamplemousse – made with red grapefruit liqueur and sparkling white wine
* Kir pêche – made with peach liqueur
* Kir pétillant – made with sparkling wine
* Kir royal – made with Champagne
* Pink Russian – made with milk instead of wine
* Tarantino – made with lager or light ale (&quot;kir-beer&quot;)

<text>&quot;Troupville&quot; (occasionally recorded as Troupeville) is an extinct unincorporated community in Lowndes County, Georgia, United States, near Valdosta. Troupville was a riverboat landing near the confluence of the Withlacoochee River and the Little River (Withlacoochee River) at the uppermost navigable point. It was the third county seat of Lowndes County. Troupville was named after Governor George Troup.

Railroads were superseding riverboats across the state. After a railroad station was established at Valdosta in 1859, many Troupville residents picked up their houses and moved to the railroad. They founded Valdosta, which the following year was designated by the legislature as the county seat.

==History==
In 1833, Lowndesville, Georgia replaced Franklinville, located east of modern Hahira, as the county seat.

In 1834, a group of citizens were appointed to select a new county seat to keep pace with settlement. In July 1836, a group of commissioners were advertising for merchants and mechanics to settle at Troupville. They believed that the Little River and Withlacoochee River could be made navigable to this point at a small expense. After the county seat was moved away from Franklinville and Lowndesville in turn, they declined.

In October 1836, advertisements were put in newspapers for proposals to build a courthouse at Troupville. The city was incorporated on 14 December 1837 by an act of the Georgia legislature and designated as the county seat (the third).

Troupville&#x27;s location near the confluence of the Withlacoochee and Little Rivers, on the stage route from Thomasville to Waresboro, and along the planned route of the Brunswick and Florida Railroad, soon proved prosperous. In 1839, town lots were being sold at $3,443. A decade later they had risen to $9,162. At its peak, Troupville had three hotels, four stores, numerous shops, three churches, and professionals of various sorts. It also had a newspaper entitled the &quot;South Georgia Watchman,&quot; later called the &quot;Troupville Watchman.&quot; Located in an area of large cotton plantations, Troupville also served as a gateway town to the new state of Florida. A mile to the north of the town was a horse racetrack, popular with many men.

By the 1850s, two different companies were competing to build a railroad through south Georgia. The Brunswick and Florida Railroad had an older charter, but lacked enough financial backing. The Savannah, Albany, and Gulf Railroad Company had the financial backing, but lacked the right of way through south Georgia. By the early 1850s, the Brunswick and Florida Railroad had completed its route as far as Schlatterville. In February 1856 the Atlantic and Gulf Railroad Company received a charter to construct a line from the junction of the Savannah, Albany, and Gulf Railroad and the Brunswick and Florida Railroad and to western border of the state that was to pass through Lowndes County. A law passed at the same time required the Brunswick and Florida Railroad to forfeit its right of way through central south Georgia in exchange for financial backing from the state. Two years of disagreements and agreements between the competing companies followed. Eventually the Brunswick and Florida Railroad forfeited its right of way.

Three different routes through Lowndes County were surveyed by E.L. Heriot, chief engineer for the company: a route through northern Troupville, a line through northern Lowndes County, and a line passing through Lowndes County and crossing the Withlacoochee River at a mineral springs. The decision to go with the third route was published on June 17, 1858. Heriot reasoned that the southern route required less curvature and fewer changes in grade than the shorter route through Troupville. Days later on June 22 at 3:00 am, the Lowndes County courthouse at Troupville was set on fire by William B. Crawford. Crawford fled to South Carolina after being released on bond. On August 9, a meeting convened in the academy building in Troupville to discuss organizing a new county. They decided to take area from Lowndes County, west of the Withlacoochee River (also known as the Little River), to form a new county to be called Brooks County.

The construction of the Atlantic and Gulf Railroad through southern Lowndes County signaled the end of Troupville. Riverboats had become obsolete and establishing a town at the junction of the rail lines under construction was crucial for the livelihood of Lowndes County. Many residents physically moved their homes and businesses to Valdosta. Troupville quickly lost its charter as county seat to the newly founded Valdosta.

In early 1871, a toll bridge crossing the Little River from Troupville to Brooks County was completed. By 1874 Troupville was described by a Valdostan, as being &quot;a deserted village or rather an old field with scarcely a vestige of the village remaining.&quot;

The town&#x27;s municipal charter officially was repealed in 1995.

<text>The National Library of Ireland (NLI; ) is Ireland&#x27;s national library located in Dublin, in a building designed by Thomas Newenham Deane. The mission of the National Library of Ireland is &quot;To collect, preserve, promote and make accessible the documentary and intellectual record of the life of Ireland and to contribute to the provision of access to the larger universe of recorded knowledge.&quot;

The library is a reference library and, as such, does not lend. It has a large quantity of Irish and Irish-related material which can be consulted without charge; this includes books, maps, manuscripts, music, newspapers, periodicals and photographs. Included in its collections are materials issued by private as well as government publishers. Among the library&#x27;s major holdings are an archive of Irish newspapers and collections donated by individual authors or their estates. The library is also the ISSN National Centre for Ireland.

The office of the Chief Herald of Ireland, the National Photographic Archive and the Museum of Literature Ireland are functions of the library, the latter in partnership with University College Dublin. The library also holds exhibitions, and provides a number of other services including genealogy research tools and support. The Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media is the member of the Government of Ireland responsible for the library.

The main library building is on Kildare Street, adjacent to Leinster House and the archaeology section of the National Museum of Ireland.

==History==
The library building, as well as its sister building the National Museum of Ireland – Archaeology which mirrors it across the front of Leinster House, were erected in 1890 and faced with Leinster granite, while &quot;buff-coloured micaceous Mount Charles sandstone from Donegal was used on the upper sotreys and for dressings around the doors and windows.&quot; According to Wyse Jackson, curator of the Geological Museum at Trinity College Dublin, over 3,000 tons of the sandstone were transported to Dublin and dressed on site.

The National Library of Ireland was established by the Dublin Science and Art Museum Act 1877, which provided that the bulk of the collections in the possession of the Royal Dublin Society, should be vested in the then Department of Science and Art for the benefit of the public and of the Society, and for the purposes of the Act.

An Agreement of 1881 provided that the Library should operate under the superintendence of a Council of twelve Trustees, eight of whom were appointed by the Society and four by the Government; this Agreement also conferred on the Trustees the duty of appointing the officers of the Library. This arrangement remained in place until the library became an autonomous cultural institution in 2005.

After the foundation of the Irish Free State in 1924/5 the Library was transferred to the Department of Education under which it remained until 1986 when it was transferred to the Department of the Taoiseach. In 1927 the Library was granted legal deposit status under the Industrial and Commercial Property (Protection) Act 1927. In 1992 responsibility for the Library was transferred to the newly established Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (now the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media) and on 3 May 2005 became an autonomous cultural institution under the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997.

===Structural decay===
By 1993, the Mount Charles sandstone which had been used to face the library building (as well as that of National Museum of Ireland – Archaeology) had begun to break up through the &quot;precipitation of salts within the fabric of the rock&quot;. The sandstone had been badly affected by the coal-polluted atmosphere in Dublin over the century it had remained in situ, and was replaced in the 1960s by a grey limestone from Ardbraccan, County Meath. As of 1993, Wyse Jackson noted that &quot;Close examinations of the stone remaining on the National Museum shows obvious decay and exfoliation of the outer layers of the rock, caused by the breakdown of the ferrous cement used to bind the sand grains together&quot;. Wyse Jackson made the note that the same rock had not been broken down by the atmosphere or pollutants in its native County Donegal where a number of buildings constructed as early as 1820 were still extant.

==Governance==
The library is governed by a board, with day-to-day management in the hands of a director and a number of heads of functions. Directors of the library have included Thomas William Lyster (1895–1920), Robert Lloyd Praeger (1920–24), Richard Irvine Best (1924–40), Richard J. Hayes (1940–67), Michael Hewson (1982–1988), Patricia Donlon (1989–97), Brendan O&#x27;Donoghue (1997–2003), Aongus Ó hAonghusa (2003–09), Fiona Ross (2010–2014), and Sandra Collins (2015–21). After a period under an acting director, in December 2022, the library announced that Audrey Whitty, deputy director of the National Museum of Ireland, would assume the office of director in early 2023.

==Collections==
===Basis and legal deposit===
The collection began with the transfer of books and papers from the Royal Dublin Society, and was significantly boosted by the addition of the library as a copyright library for Ireland from 1927 (by contrast, the library of Trinity College Dublin was already a copyright library for the UK and Ireland, a status it retains). The National Cultural Institutions Act 1997 mandated that the National Library of Ireland (NLI) collect all materials relating to Ireland to provide an accurate record of Irish output.

===Major collections===
The library holds over 12 million items. The main collection is a combination of stock transferred from the Royal Dublin Society, including the Joly collection (25,000 volumes), later acquisitions, and copyright deposits of most printed, and some other, works published in Ireland since 1927. The library purchases content from Northern Ireland, and attempts to collect all publications in Irish, and acquires a limited supply from further afield. The book collection numbers around 1 million volumes, principally sourced from the RDS legacy and legal deposit copies. Other major collections include serials (recurrent publications other than newspapers, including magazines, journals and annual reports), maps and drawings, Government and other public sector publications, manuscripts, and original and microfilmed newspapers. The NLI holds over 2,785 subject items related to 20th century Irish poets, and is a major source for poetry by Irish writers.

===Personal archives and papers===
The National Library of Ireland houses collections of archival papers, including personal notes and work books, of eminent writers including:
* Roddy Doyle
* Seamus Heaney
* Michael D. Higgins
* James Joyce
* Edna O&#x27;Brien
* Colm Tóibín
* Una Troy
* Sheila Wingfield
* W. B. Yeats

The National Library of Ireland houses the Sheehy Skeffington Papers, a collection of articles, books, poems, and other materials of Irish writers and activists, Francis Sheehy Skeffington, and Hanna Sheehy Skeffington.  These writings offer an understanding into the influence of the Francis and Hanna Skeffington in early 20th Century Irish culture and thought as well as insight into their family life.

The library also holds the Cooper Collection. Austin Cooper (1759–1831) was a County Tipperary clerk who produced numerous sketches of Irish antiquities which were preserved by his great-grandson. The Cooper Collection also contains drawings by other artists including Francis Wheatley.

===Parish registers===
The Library also maintains an online index of all Catholic parish registers up to the 1880s which recorded baptisms, marriages and some burials. The original collection was preserved on microfilm and later was provided online.

===Music===
In 2010, the National Library of Ireland began a collaborative effort in a new website, the National Archive of Irish Composers, which was designed to develop a free online comprehensive collection of the sheet music of 18th and 19th century Irish composers. As of 2021, the website of the National Archive of Irish Composers describes the project as a collaborative venture between the National Library of Ireland, TU Dublin Conservatory of Music and Drama, Heritage Music Productions, directed by Dr Una Hunt.

===Digital===
In 2019, the Library accessioned its first &quot;born digital&quot; collection as a pilot scheme, receiving the digital collection of Irish author, Marian Keyes.

<doc id="1019314" wikidata="Q670961" url="?curid=1019314" title="Edelweiss (band)">
<text>Edelweiss were an Austrian electronic dance music group consisting of remixers Martin Gletschermayer, Matthias Schweger and Walter Werzowa. The group is best known for their 1988 worldwide hit &quot;Bring Me Edelweiss&quot;, and their European hit &quot;Starship Edelweiss&quot;. 

Edelweiss reached the number one position with their hit &quot;Bring Me Edelweiss,&quot; featuring Austrian folk singer Maria Mathis, who also did the live performances (and later recorded an updated version in 1999). The single was a hit in many European countries, supposedly by following the instructions given in The KLF&#x27;s book &quot;The Manual&quot;. Borrowing large parts of its melody from ABBA&#x27;s &quot;SOS&quot; and Indeep&#x27;s &quot;Last Night a DJ Saved My Life&quot;, the song humorously targeted Austrian ski resorts and yodeling and sold five million copies worldwide. Bill Drummond, one of the authors of &quot;The Manual (How to Have a Number One the Easy Way)&quot;, mentioned the group in the epilogue of the German release of the book, which was originally published in 1989 (in English).

<text>Jonathan William Coachman (born August 12, 1973), also known as &quot;The Coach&quot;, is an American sports analyst and former professional wrestling personality.

==Early life==
Before embarking on an announcing career in professional wrestling, Coachman was a high school basketball player. After two state basketball championships at McPherson High School in McPherson, Kansas, Coachman moved across town to continue playing for McPherson College. While at McPherson, Coachman&#x27;s interests included participating in theatre, serving as the sports editor for the school newspaper, and doing play-by-play and color commentary for the local football and basketball radio broadcasts. Coachman was also a sports reporter/anchor at KAKE in Wichita, Kansas, and also lived for a time in Newton Falls, Ohio, frequently attending Youngstown State Penguins basketball games.

Coachman also starred in many instructional videos used for technical education classrooms of middle schools and high schools. One set of videos featured &quot;Coach&quot; instructing people on flight navigation and the basics of airplanes. He also had a &quot;boyfriend-in-a-box&quot; modeled after him during college. Coachman also worked for local Kansas City news station KMBC-TV, where he was a correspondent for &quot;Larry King Live&quot;&#x27;s coverage of Owen Hart&#x27;s death in May 1999.

==Professional wrestling career==
===World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment/WWE===

====Backstage interviewer (1999–2003)====
Coachman began his World Wrestling Federation (WWF) career as an interviewer, commentator, and presenter on &quot;SmackDown!&quot; on January 13, 2000. Coachman was also involved in occasional segments with The Rock, in which The Rock attempted to humiliate Coachman in any form possible, whether it was forcing him to sing, dance, or smile for the camera. The Rock also accused Coachman of performing rather lewd activities with farm animals.

During winter of 2001, Coachman was pressed into service as a sideline reporter for regional telecasts of the WWF-owned XFL, initially serving on the same broadcast team as WWF commentators Jim Ross and Jerry Lawler.

====Commentator and Assistant to Eric Bischoff (2003–2006)====
The Coach made a heel turn against Shane McMahon on August 24, 2003, at SummerSlam. After this he would have an on-screen role as the &quot;lackey&quot; to then General Manager of Raw, Eric Bischoff. The Coach continued to work as a heel and later teamed up with his fellow &quot;WWE Heat&quot; announcer Al Snow in a storyline feud against the &quot;Raw&quot; announce team, Jerry Lawler and Jim Ross. This feud would even see the pair win the right to announce the main show from Ross and Lawler at one point, as The Coach and Snow defeated Ross and Lawler at Unforgiven. Later, The Coach achieved a singles victory on pay-per-view at Backlash, in 2004 by defeating Tajiri (albeit with the assistance of Garrison Cade). The Coach would go on to host the 2004 and 2005 Raw Diva Searches. Later, The Coach would gain his own column in the now defunct &quot;Raw Magazine&quot; (&quot;Coach&#x27;s Corner&quot;) and his own webcast on &quot;WWE.com&quot; (&quot;CoachCast&quot;). Coachman was officially added as the third member to the &quot;Raw&quot; broadcast team and signed a multi-year contract with WWE in 2005.

During October 2005, The Coach was involved in an angle involving the McMahon Family publicly firing Jim Ross due to the actions of Ross&#x27;s friend, Steve Austin. The firing of Ross gave The Coach the position of lead announcer on &quot;Raw&quot;. The storyline would culminate in a match at Taboo Tuesday where Austin was scheduled to face The Coach in a match with both Austin&#x27;s and Ross&#x27;s jobs on the line. Though the match was originally scheduled to be Austin versus The Coach, Austin refused to participate because of issues he had with the storyline (the original story was said to have called for Austin to lose following a run-in by the returning Mark Henry). World Heavyweight Champion Batista was renamed the opponent to play up the &quot;SmackDown!&quot; vs. &quot;Raw&quot; storylines. On the October 31, 2005 edition of &quot;Raw&quot;, Batista came out and accepted the match only to be attacked by The Coach&#x27;s backup, the returning Goldust and Vader. At Taboo Tuesday, Batista faced off against The Coach in a fan-voted Street Fight. Vader and Goldust tried to interfere in the match, but Batista won. However, no mention of the Jim Ross stipulation was ever mentioned after the match.

Former ECW announcer Joey Styles soon replaced The Coach in a move that became permanent despite The Coach&#x27;s on-air protestations that Styles&#x27; presence was temporary. The Coach retained a prominent role on the Raw announcing team as the heel representative of a three-man booth with Styles, the play-by-play man, and Jerry &quot;The King&quot; Lawler, the babyface color commentator.

On the January 23, 2006 edition of &quot;Raw&quot;, The Coach defeated Lawler to win the last Raw spot in the Royal Rumble match via interference from the debuting Spirit Squad. The Coach would enter seventh during the match only to be eliminated almost immediately by Big Show.

====Executive Assistant and Interim General Manager (2006–2007)====
During the April 24 edition of &quot;Raw&quot;, after Coachman hosted a Divas bikini contest, Viscera came down to the ring and performed the &quot;Viscagra&quot; on Coachman. During the commercial break of that show, still in the ring, he quit in protest of his treatment on Raw. On the May 29 edition of &quot;Raw&quot;, it was revealed that Mr. McMahon had hired Coachman under the new position of McMahon&#x27;s Executive Assistant; to aid McMahon in the daily running of the &quot;Raw&quot; brand, and actually acted as the General Manager when the McMahons were absent. While Executive Assistant, Coachman, along with the McMahons, feuded with the reformed D-Generation X and also had issues with John Cena. On June 18, 2007, Coachman was officially named Interim General Manager of &quot;Raw&quot; by the McMahon Family following the kayfabe death of Vince McMahon in a limo explosion.

On the August 6, 2007 edition of Raw, William Regal became the new General Manager on the Raw brand after winning a battle royal featuring other participants from the Raw roster. As a result, Coachman was removed from his position as Interim General Manager and became Regal&#x27;s new assistant. However, following a kayfabe assault by John Cena on Regal during the September 3 edition of &quot;Raw&quot;, Regal had to be temporarily relieved of his duties as General Manager at which point Coachman was once again named interim General Manager of &quot;Raw&quot; until Regal was fit to resume his role. On the October 1 edition of &quot;Raw&quot;, Regal returned as General Manager which resulted in Coachman being once again demoted to his prior rank.

On the December 3, 2007 edition of &quot;Raw&quot;, Coach was in a No DQ Handicap match with Carlito against Hornswoggle, with whom he had been having problems. However, Hornswoggle had paid the APA to protect him during the match. Coachman was pinned by Hornswoggle after a Clothesline from Hell and a Tadpole Splash.

A rivalry ensued and one night Coachman chased Hornswoggle all over the backstage area, and it eventually moved to the arena, where Hornswoggle performed his &quot;hide under the ring&quot; trick to get away. Coachman moved to the other side of the ring and pulled out a detonator, much to the surprise of Jim Ross. He attempted to activate the detonator twice, but nothing happened. He then moved under the ring to check the explosives, and Hornswoggle came out from under the ring, and successfully detonated the explosives, causing smoke to appear from under the ring, and the cameras to make television screens change color, from gray to rainbow, and according to Ross, the building shook. Coachman was charred and unable to move.

====SmackDown commentator and departure (2008)====
On the January 4, 2008 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Coachman would replace John &quot;Bradshaw&quot; Layfield (JBL), who rejoined &quot;Raw&quot; the previous week, on commentary alongside Michael Cole. Later that year in June, Coachman&#x27;s contract expired after he decided not to renew it.

===Return to WWE===
====Part-time appearances (2016–2018)====
On March 25, 2016, Coachman made a special appearance during WWE&#x27;s live event held at Madison Square Garden. On the March 28 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Coachman returned to WWE television for the first time in almost 8 years, cutting a promo with The New Day. Coachman would also announce that &quot;SportsCenter&quot; would be live leading up to WrestleMania 32 on April 3. On the January 22, 2018, episode of &quot;Raw 25 Years&quot;, Coachman would appear in a backstage segment with &quot;Raw&quot; general manager Kurt Angle and other past WWE talent, Harvey Wippleman, The Brooklyn Brawler, Theodore Long, Brother Love and The Boogeyman.

====Raw commentator and Pre-show host (2018–21)====
On January 29, 2018, Coachman re-signed with WWE, joining the &quot;Raw&quot; commentary team alongside Michael Cole and Corey Graves, replacing Booker T as color commentator. On September 10, Coachman would leave the &quot;Raw&quot; commentary team, being replaced by Renee Young, with Coachman becoming the new pre-show panel host for pay-per-views.

Coachman also served as pregame host for the 2020 incarnation of the XFL. Coachman left WWE and the XFL in 2021, stating that he had expected to be reimbursed for his travel expenses but never was due to the XFL&#x27;s bankruptcy.

==Sports broadcasting career==
===ESPN (2008–2017)===
In 2008, Coachman left WWE to begin a career with ESPN. Starting in mid-2015, Coachman began presenting highlights of WWE&#x27;s best moments of the week on ESPN and having weekly sitdown interviews with WWE wrestlers on &quot;SportsCenter&quot;. In October 2017, Coachman announced via his &quot;Periscope&quot; that his contract at ESPN had expired, thus confirming his departure from the network.

===NBC Sports Group (2018–2021)===
As WWE has a television deal with NBCUniversal, in 2018, he was named play-by-play announcer for the NBC-owned World Long Drive Championship. Coachman is also a commentator for PGA Tour Live, which is an NBC Sports Gold subscription service providing additional coverage of golf tournaments.

<text>Laholm () is a town and the seat of Laholm Municipality, Halland County, Sweden, with 6,527 inhabitants in 2015.

Laholm is, despite its small population, for historical reasons often still referred to as a &quot;city&quot;. In the 13th century, Laholm was the first in Halland to receive city rights.

The town is located at the estuary of the river Lagan in the Bay of Laholm.

==History==
Laholm is one of Sweden&#x27;s oldest cities and the oldest in the province of Halland. The first charter was granted in the 13th century, in what was then a part of Denmark and &quot;Høx Herred&quot;. The church was founded in 1225. During the wars between Sweden and Denmark in the 16th and 17th century, Laholm was burnt down several times. In 1645, as Halland became a part of Sweden, the town had 330 inhabitants, growing to about 866 about hundred years later. In the middle of the 19th century the population reached the 1,000 mark, doubled in the early 20th century and reaching 3,000 around 1950. The local government reform of 1971 made the town the seat of Laholm Municipality which has over 25,000 inhabitants.

The town&#x27;s and commune&#x27;s coat of arms dates back to the Middle Ages, but was granted by royal warrant only in the 1940s. It shows three silver salmon with red fins on a blue background, owing to the importance of salmon fishing in the area. The arms is very nearly identical to that of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames in London, whose arms also go back a long way.

<text>Varberg () is a locality and the seat of Varberg Municipality, Halland County, Sweden, with 35,782 inhabitants in 2019.

Varberg and all of Halland are well known for their &quot;typical west coast&quot; sandy beaches. In Varberg the coast changes from wide sandy beaches to rocky terrain that continues north into the Bohuslän archipelago and as far as the North Cape. Varberg is ranked as one of Sweden’s most beautiful cities.

== Geography ==
Varberg is located on the Swedish west coast and is a popular beach and surfing destination for both Sweden and Europe. It has a main landmark in the large Fortress and Castle of Varberg. Through centuries many wars between Denmark and Sweden were fought here before Southern Sweden, including Varberg, became permanently Swedish in 1658 through the Treaty of Roskilde. It is a small town with architecture mainly from the turn of the century and has several green parks such as the Society Park (Societetsparken) and the English Park. The green parks were however not always there. In fact in the 19th century the town was largely without trees and green areas, being instead characterised by bald rocks and sand. The Swedish authoritative author and bishop Esaias Tegnér described it in 1826 as the least appealing place in Sweden, which has later been used in the marketing of Varberg. Today this has changed and its sandy beaches are a popular destination. Another main draw of Varberg is its natural surroundings. The landscape further inland has rolling hills with lakes and forests in contrast to the flatter coastal areas.

== Climate ==
Varberg has an oceanic climate that although moderate by Swedish standards, still retains quite large seasonal variation. Summers are in general cooler than both in Halmstad and Gothenburg, with highs being moderated by the marine airflow. Although this moderation occurs, some summer days can be very warm, and some winter nights see severe frosts. The highest recorded temperature since 1901 is 33.6°C (92.5°F) on July 31, 2018 and the lowest is -25.5°C (-13.9°F) in January 1942.

== History ==
A fortress called Varberg (at that time written &quot;Wardbergh&quot;, &quot;watch hill&quot;) was erected in the 1280s as part of a chain of military establishments along the coast, in what was then Danish territory. In the middle of the 14th century, the old settlement &quot;Getakärr&quot; north of the fortress took its new name from the fortress. The town was moved northwards around the year 1400. It was destroyed during the Kalmar War (1611-1612) and rebuilt near the fortress. In 1645 Halland passed from Denmark to Sweden by the Treaty of Brömsebro for a period of 30 years. It had at that time about 600 inhabitants. The transfer was made permanent by the Treaty of Roskilde in 1658. The town was moved again after a fire in 1666 to where the city centre is located today. The city was devastated by a huge fire in 1863 and was subsequently rebuilt with stone or brick houses. In 1890 the population figure had passed 4,000 and with industrialization it reached 8,500 in 1930. The local government reform of 1971 made Varberg the seat of the much larger Varberg Municipality, with a current population of close to 56,000 inhabitants. Although several houses were torn down in the 1970s, most of the city center still remains intact.

== Sights ==
Varberg&#x27;s fortress is its most notable historical building, mostly because of its size as it has no architectural uniformity. It was first built as a castle in 1280, with new parts being built in successions.

Near Varberg there is the VLF transmitter Grimeton, an interesting radio-technical facility and classified by UNESCO to be a World Cultural Heritage site. It can be visited during the summer. Bexell Cottage is also located in the area.

Komedianten is a cultural and performing arts centre, built between 2010-2012.
==Sports==
The following sports clubs are located in Varberg:
* Varbergs BoIS FC
* Varbergs GIF FK
* Lilla Träslövs FF
* Varberg Vipers

Multiple locations in and around Varberg offer great conditions for watersports. (Apple Bay Beach), located in the south of Varberg, has many facilities and rental spots for windsurfing, standup paddleboarding, kitesurfing and other sports.

<text>Kungsbacka () is a locality and the seat of Kungsbacka Municipality in Halland County, Sweden, with 19,057 inhabitants in 2010. It is a part of Greater Gothenburg Metropolitan Area.

It is one of the most affluent parts of Sweden, in part due to its simultaneous proximity to the countryside and the large city of Gothenburg. Its mayor since 2020 is Lisa Andersson.

==History==

The first records referring to Kungsbacka as a town date from the 15th century, when it was part of Denmark. By the time it was recognised as part of Sweden (1658), the river running through the town, on which some transportation of goods took place, was almost completely overgrown and despite pleas to restore its function, this did not occur. Some trade still took place from the coast, but the town&#x27;s significance as a place of naval commerce declined over the centuries. Today, it is home to over 2,000 enterprises, and the river still runs through it.

A devastating fire in 1846 destroyed the town centre, sparing only a little red wooden cabin which still stands today. In late 2006 and early 2014 other fires affected the town centre, and construction work is ongoing to restore the loss of wooden buildings.

The town remained small until the 1960s. The municipal reform of 1971 made it the seat of the much larger Kungsbacka Municipality. The town began to grow as a part of Metropolitan Gothenburg. It is the southern terminus of the Gothenburg commuter rail system, situated 28 km from central Gothenburg.
