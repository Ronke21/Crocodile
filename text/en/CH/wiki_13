<text>Hires Root Beer is an American brand of root beer that was manufactured by Keurig Dr Pepper. Introduced in 1876, it was one of the longest continuously made soft drinks in the United States.

== History ==
===19th century===
Hires Root Beer was created by Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, pharmacist Charles Elmer Hires. The official story is that Hires first tasted root beer, a traditional American beverage dating back to the colonial era, while on his honeymoon in 1875. However, historical accounts vary and the actual time and place of the discovery may never be known. 

By 1876, Hires had developed his own recipe and was marketing 25-cent packets of powder which each yielded of root beer. At Philadelphia&#x27;s Centennial Exposition in 1876, he cultivated new customers by giving away free glasses of it. Hires marketed it as a solid concentrate of 16 wild roots and berries. It claimed to purify the blood and make rosy cheeks. 

In 1884, he began producing a liquid extract and a syrup for use in soda fountains, and was soon shipping root beer in kegs and producing a special fountain dispenser called the &quot;Hires Automatic Munimaker.&quot; In 1890, the Charles E. Hires Company incorporated and began supplying Hires root beer in small bottles claiming over a million bottles sold by 1891.

Hires Root Beer was promoted as &quot;The Temperance Drink&quot; and &quot;the Greatest Health-Giving Beverage in the World&quot;. Hires advertised aggressively, believing &quot;doing business without advertising is like winking at a girl in the dark. &quot;You&quot; know what you are doing, but nobody &quot;else&quot; does.&quot;

One of the major ingredients of root beer was sassafras oil, a plant root extract used in beverages for its flavor and presumed medicinal properties. The medicinal properties of root beer are emphasized in the advertising slogan, &quot;Join Health and Cheer; Drink Hires Rootbeer&quot;. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration banned sassafras oil in 1960 because it contains the carcinogen and liver-damaging chemical safrol. However, a process was later discovered by which the harmful chemical could be removed from sassafras oil while preserving the flavor.

Prior to the move to &quot;natural and artificial flavors&quot;, Hires ingredients included carbonated water, sugar, dextrose, caramel, plant extracts of birch, sassafras, licorice, vanilla, spikenard, sarsaparilla, hops, wintergreen, pipsissewa, ginger and flavor.

===20th century===
Hires Root Beer kits, available in the United States and Canada from the early 1900s through the 1980s allowed consumers to mix an extract with water, sugar and yeast to brew their own root beer. However, most consumption was of bottled root beer.

A mid-1960s&#x27; advertising campaign featured jingles by jazz singer Blossom Dearie, wherein she sang in a Betty-Boop voice: &quot;Hires Root Beer! Hires Rootin&#x27; Tootin&#x27; Root Beer! Hires Rootin&#x27;-Tootin&#x27; Rabble-Rousin&#x27;, lion-roarin&#x27;, Roman-candle-lightin&#x27; Root Beer!&quot;

Consolidated Foods bought the company from the Hires family in 1960, and sold it two years later to Crush International. Procter &amp; Gamble bought Crush in 1980, and sold it to Cadbury Schweppes in 1989. Cadbury divested its soft drinks arm in 2008, and the beverage company renamed itself Dr Pepper Snapple Group.

In Canada, the Hires brand is no longer sold by Keurig Dr Pepper; retailers and vending machines have replaced it with Pepsi-owned Mug Root Beer since the 1990s and DPSG markets Stewarts Root Beer in Canada. The Hires brand is now offered by Canada Dry Motts as an alcoholic drink, Hires Root Beer and vodka.

Hires&#x27; availability in the U.S. was phased out as other Dr. Pepper owned brands like A&amp;W Root Beer were promoted on behalf of the same company.

===21st century===
, the Keurig Dr. Pepper web page no longer lists Hires among its list of brands on the all products listing search on its website.

<text>Anthony Lane is a British journalist who was a film critic for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine from 1993 to 2024.

==Career==
===Education and early career===
Lane attended Sherborne School, graduating with a degree in English from Trinity College, Cambridge where he also did graduate work on T.S. Eliot. After graduation, he worked as a freelance writer and book reviewer for &quot;The Independent&quot;, where he was appointed deputy literary editor in 1989. In 1991, Lane was appointed film critic for &quot;The Independent on Sunday&quot;.

===&quot;The New Yorker&quot;===
In 1993, Lane was asked by &quot;The New Yorker&#x27;s&quot; then-editor, Tina Brown, to join the magazine as a film critic. He has written profiles of actors and directors (Alfred Hitchcock, Buster Keaton, Grace Kelly) and authors (Ian Fleming and Patrick Leigh Fermor) and Hergé&#x27;s &quot;Tintin&quot; books. Lane has also reviewed books, such as &quot;The Stories of Vladimir Nabokov&quot; and &quot;The Complete Stories of Evelyn Waugh&quot;, two authors he reveres. In 2022, he wrote an essay on the legacy of Eliot&#x27;s &quot;The Waste Land&quot; for its centenary. He contributes to the magazine&#x27;s &quot;Critic at Large&quot; section; in 1999, he wrote about &quot;&quot;The Endurance&quot;: Shackleton&#x27;s Legendary Antarctic Expedition&quot; at the American Museum of Natural History, and in 2000 he wrote about &quot;Full Moon&quot;, a collection of lunar photographs at the Rose Center For Earth and Space. 

A collection of 140 of his &quot;The New Yorker&quot; reviews, essays, and profiles was published in 2002 under the title &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Perfect&quot; — a reference to the final line of the 1959 film &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot;. A profile of the film&#x27;s director, Billy Wilder, ends the book.

== Style ==

===Lane&#x27;s maxims===
In his introduction to &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Perfect: Writings from The New Yorker&quot;, Lane mentions five maxims that &quot;should be obeyed by anyone who, having tried and failed to gain respectable employment, has decided to throw in the sponge and become a movie critic instead&quot;:

:1) Never read the publicity material.
:2) Whenever possible, see a film in the company of ordinary human beings.
:3) Try to keep up with documentaries about Swabian transsexuals {or, see everything regardless of budget and hype}.
:4) Whenever possible, pass sentence on a movie the day after it comes out. Otherwise, wait fifty years.
:5) Try to avoid the Lane technique of summer moviegoing.

The explanation for the fifth maxim is a good example of Lane&#x27;s style:

:On a broiling day, I ran to a screening of &quot;Contact&quot;, the Jodie Foster flick about messages from another galaxy. I made it for the opening credits, and, panting heavily – which, with all due respect, is not something that I find myself doing &quot;that&quot; often in Jodie Foster films – I started taking notes. These went &quot;v. gloomy&quot;, &quot;odd noir look for sci-fi&quot;, &quot;creepy shadows in outdoor scene&quot;, and so on. Only after three-quarters of an hour did I remember to remove my dark glasses.
Lane varies his style based on his subject. His review of &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot; begins with the movie&#x27;s slogan: &quot;The power is real. The story is forever. The time is now.&quot; and continues in a parody of its clipped style: &quot;The time is then. The place is Egypt. The boy is born. The prognostication is dodgy. The answer is bulrushes. The boy is launched. The boy is found. The adoption process is unimpeded by interference from government agencies. The dad is Pharaoh. The brother is Rameses. The stage is set.&quot; He goes on: &quot;The picture is O. K. The picture is &quot;fine&quot;. Look. The thing is this. The cutting-edge computer-generated imagery is white-hot new. The movie is old-fashioned. The story is forever. The movie is for the holidays. The choice is yours.&quot; His review of &quot;Emma&quot; and &quot;Kingpin&quot; imagines the characters from the former movie discussing the latter: &quot;The company was far from disinclined to hear more; and Mr. Elton, whose refinement of expression was complemented by a most unsullied cordiality, spoke to them of bowling with ten pins; of the misfortune that was visited upon Mr. Harrelson in the losing of his arm; and of the ardent and uncouth intentions on the part of Mr. William Murray to impede the happiness that was both prized and merited by the heroes of the piece.&quot; Referring to the poor use of archaisms in Roland Joffé&#x27;s &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot;, he writes &quot;Thou hast to be kidding.&quot; His review of &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; mentions that &quot;the worst marketing ploy I have seen so far is the &quot;Star Wars Learning Fun Book&quot;, for kids of kindergarten age. (&#x27;What is this? It is a Hutt. Say it out loud: Hutt.&#x27;) &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; raises the spectre of an industry where the parasitic arts of buildup and spinoff will outgrow and choke the product itself.&quot; Lane concludes: &quot;What is this? Crap. Say it loud: Crap.&quot; 

Lane recounts episodes from his life as a filmgoer; he writes that film &quot;has revivified the Proustian principle that memory is not ours to command&quot;, adding: &quot;It is generally agreed, for example, that the last Golden Age of cinema occurred in the mid-seventies—the epoch of &quot;The Godfather&quot;, &quot;Chinatown&quot; and &quot;McCabe and Ms. Miller&quot;. I feel privileged to have been there; unfortunately, I spent my pocket money on tickets for &quot;Zeppelin&quot;, &quot;Earthquake,&quot; and &quot;Rollercoaster&quot; (in Sensuround.) I realize that &quot;Chinatown&quot; is a great picture and that &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot; is dreck; but the sight of a weary, begrimed Steve McQueen is burned into my mind with a fierceness that Jack Nicholson, with his nicked nostril, can never match. I missed the Golden Age; catching up later was an education, but nothing I can do can bring it back.&quot;

Lane&#x27;s style is often allusive; in a profile of Luis Buñuel, Lane writes that &quot;The great filmmakers, however rare their own appearances in front of the camera, almost always come to resemble their collected works. No one could sit through a Hitchcock season, for example, and imagine that its creator was a carefree and sexually contented beanpole. Godard is the mad professor, beloved of his students and nobody else; Howard Hawks is the sly jock with money and girls to burn; Billy Wilder grins like a miniature devil from the margins of a gilded manuscript—the imp who knows too much. Buñuel beats them hollow: that square sawed-off head, the ripe, amusable mouth, the martial breadth of brow and chin. And, most of all, there are the eyes. Hooded above and pinched below, they shimmer with the virtues, or vices in disguise, of the Buñuelian gaze: dignity, lubricity, and doubt. You can easily picture yourself being hypnotized by this man; sit through a sample of his movies, and you will think you have been.&quot;

In a piece reviewing recent bestsellers, Lane, paraphrasing Kingsley Amis, writes that &quot;the ideal literary diet consists of trash and classics: all that has survived, and all that has no reason to survive—books you can read without thinking, and books you have to read if you want to think at all.&quot;

==Professional recognition==
Anthony Lane was awarded the 2001 National Magazine Award for Reviews &amp; Criticism, for three of his &quot;New Yorker&quot; articles:
* &quot;The Maria Problem&quot; (14 February 2000), on &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;
* &quot;The Eye of the Land&quot; (13 March 2000), on the photographs of Walker Evans
* &quot;The Light Side of the Moon&quot; (10 April 2000), on photographs from the Apollo program

Lane has also been nominated for National Magazine Awards on a number of other occasions, but has never won one. The nominations include:
* 1996 award for Special Interest, for the article &quot;Look Back in Hunger&quot; (18 December), a humorous piece about cookbooks
* 2000 award for Reviews &amp; Criticism, for the articles
** &quot;The Man in the Mirror&quot; (9 August 1999), on André Gide
** &quot;In Love with Fear&quot; (16 August 1999), on Alfred Hitchcock
** &quot;Waugh in Pieces&quot; (4 October 1999), on Evelyn Waugh

Nicholas Lezard, reviewing Lane&#x27;s collection &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Perfect&quot;, wrote that &quot;If the film is good art, or a delight, Lane will communicate precisely, concisely and illuminatingly the relevant merits; if the film sucks, he has some fun.&quot; Laura Miller, reviewing that collection in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, wrote that &quot;Lane writes prose the way Fred Astaire danced; his sentences and paragraphs are a sublime, rhythmic concoction of glide and snap, lightness and sting. Like his beloved Jane Austen, his style is infernally contagious.&quot; However, she expressed reservations about his use of puns. In 2008, Lane was named one of the top 30 critics in the world by &quot;More Intelligent Life&quot;, the web version of the lifestyle publication from &quot;The Economist&quot;. As of 2010, the movie review aggregation website Metacritic weighted Lane&#x27;s movie reviews higher than any other critic&#x27;s.

==Personal life==
Lane lived in Cambridge, England with his former partner, Allison Pearson, a British writer and columnist.

<doc id="1012141" wikidata="Q3057465" url="?curid=1012141" title="Ryo Sakazaki">
<text>is a character introduced in the 1992 fighting game &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; developed by SNK. In the series, Ryo is depicted as a skilled martial artist who practices his family&#x27;s fighting style, , taught by his father Takuma. After his younger sister Yuri disappears, Ryo and his best friend Robert Garcia search Southtown to find her, facing several opponents along the way. While the series follows Ryo&#x27;s journey as a protector of those he loves, he also regularly appears in the crossover series &quot;The King of Fighters&quot;, in which he participates in fighting tournaments to promote the Kyokugenryu Karate. He also appears in other SNK games as an older fighter named influenced by his father Takuma. Additionally, he features in several manhua adaptations and appears in the anime OVA adaptation of &quot;Art of Fighting&quot;.

SNK developers Hiroshi Matsumoto and Takashi Nishiyama created Ryo as an homage to the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; characters; the team that produced the first game in the franchise left Capcom to join SNK to produce other games. Ryo&#x27;s inclusion in &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; series was decided immediately by the staff as the company wanted to employ characters from its other series in crossover games. SNK artist Hiroaki Hashimoto was responsible for his alter-ego Mr. Karate&#x27;s design as he wanted to create a new design distinctly different from the original. Multiple voice actors have portrayed Ryo throughout his different appearances.

Video game publications have both praised and criticized Ryo&#x27;s character. Although Ryo has been criticized for his similarities to the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; video games&#x27; characters, several reviewers have praised his development in several SNK games such as his introduction in &quot;Fatal Fury Special&quot; and &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; as one of the first crossover characters. Ryo served as a model for the development of Dan Hibiki, a joke character in the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; series due to similar designs.

==Creation==

Ryo Sakazaki was created by Hiroshi Matsumoto and Takashi Nishiyama as an homage to the Capcom character Ryu because during the release of the game, some members from the original &quot;Street Fighter&quot; video game from Capcom moved to SNK. Artist Shinkiro has said he had no problems with designing Ryo because he himself had not been rich. Designing Robert Garcia, who was rich, caused him &quot;trouble&quot;. SNK staff member Youichiro Soeda said that Ryo and Robert&#x27;s debut was unique to other games based on the company because the story did not focus on fighting tournaments but instead on the duo&#x27;s quest to save Yuri Sakazaki. Matsumoto has stated that he felt he was appealing to people who did not usually play games by showing the story in the game instead of just media such as magazines and comics. 

In the planning stage of &quot;Fatal Fury Special&quot;, another SNK fighting game, Hattori Hanzo of &quot;World Heroes&quot; was being considered as a hidden boss. However, Hanzo was a character developed by another company. Even though ADK was a subsidiary, the staff decided instead to place Ryo as a hidden character; they found him more interesting as a guest character. Ryo&#x27;s addition to &quot;Fatal Fury: Special&quot; was done with the approval of Hiroshi Matsumoto. Bringing Ryo to &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; was considered a good idea by planner Yasuyuki Oda believing he fits the cast due to how the franchise borrowed Desperation Moves from &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; and how it revolutionized the idea of the crossover concept that would conceptualize &quot;The King of Fighters&quot;. However, as Ryo was announced at the Tokyo Game Show, Oda found such an unpredicted reveal awkward; &quot;Fatal Fury Special&quot; had several issues at launch in every single console and unlocking Ryo as a hidden boss was too challenging. In some games starting from &quot;Fatal Fury: Wild Ambition&quot;, Ryo goes by the nickname of &quot;Mr. Karate&quot;. Artist Falcoon says this was a reference to how Ryo managed to defeat his father Takuma Sakazaki and thus became worthy of that title. Writer Akihiko Ureshino originally aimed to give Ryo a bigger role in the &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; series where he would fight a revived Geese Howard but was rejected by Shinseisha. The concept would have been villain Geese reviving and an aged Ryo settles things with him. 

Ryo was first voiced by Masaki Usui. Starting in 2016 with &quot;The King of Fighters XIV&quot;, Usui was replaced by Daiki Takakura who wanted to promote his character&#x27;s appearances. Takakura believes his role as Ryo is important because the character appeared on multiple generations of consoles and he wanted to keep its traditional style despite having a different voice. For the otome game, &quot;The King of Fighters: For Girls&quot;, Subaru Kimura voices the character. Alden Crews voiced Ryo in the English dub of the anime special.

===Portrayal and design===

The character was modeled after American actor Patrick Swayze. According to Falcoon, Ryo is an embodiment of fortitude and vigor. Often dealing with his school in &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; and &quot;The King of Fighters&quot;, by the time of &quot;&quot;, Ryo is still in his position as the head of Kyokugen-ryu karate, and he retreats to the mountains to train. Ureshino claims the goal is not to reach the goal of being the strongest, but rather he is the type who wants to keep getting stronger, even if it is just a little at a time. As a result, Ureshino describes Ryo as a man who will find it difficult in modern society and never marries his love interest King. The developers added that &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;94&quot; was created with the idea of having Ryo fighting against Terry Bogard, the lead character of the &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; series. They tend to be unable to get involved in the main story and end up in comical roles in contrast to the &quot;Art of Fighting&quot;. In regards to the masked Mr. Karate from the spin-off &quot;Maximum Impact 2&quot;, Ureshino decided to give him the age of 49, making him the oldest character of the title. 

Ryo&#x27;s appearance changes among games. He is normally blonde, inherited from his mother. He wears a vermilion or orange gi first tailored by her. Beneath the orange gi, he wears a black shirt, which was omitted in &quot;Art of Fighting 2&quot;. He keeps wearing his original &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; design in both &quot;Fatal Fury Special&quot; and all &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; games. Ryo&#x27;s redesign as middle-aged was created by SNK artist Hiroaki Hashimoto who oversaw the character designs in &quot;Fatal Fury: Wild Ambition&quot; and &quot;Buriki One&quot; as he disliked the original look. The biggest change was Ryo&#x27;s clothes, which featured more black and giving him more facial hair symbolizing his older age. In retrospect, Hiroaki believes he made the right choice with black as it makes Ryo&#x27;s face stand out. Changing the design of a central and popular SNK character was risky, but Hiroaki&#x27;s seniors gave him freedom with the stipulation that the design should look cool. He is specifically written to be 32 years old because &quot;he is physically and mentally accomplished as a fighter&quot;.

His normal costume for the &quot;Maximum Impact&quot; series is the same as the martial arts uniform he has worn in &quot;Art of Fighting&quot;, &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; and &quot;Fatal Fury Special&quot;. There is a change of mood concerning his &quot;Color F&quot; reminiscent of Haohmaru from &quot;Samurai Shodown&quot;. Regarding his &quot;Color G~H&quot;, his refined sense is shown through his braided hat, ruler, and mountain ascetic style. For the &quot;Mr. Karate&quot; incarnation of Ryo, his Normal has been given a&quot; tengu&quot; mask, which is reminiscent of his father Takuma. With his &quot;Another&quot; incarnation there is a stylish change of clothing based on his &quot;Wild Ambition&quot; look. The color combination of his shirt is standard, but there is also a version just like his &quot;Color E&quot; with a design on his back. &quot;Color G&quot; appears as a style that brings to mind the clothing of Robert. In the 2016 game &quot;The King of Fighters XIV&quot; a costume depicting Ryo&#x27;s appearance in &quot;Wild Ambition&quot; was originally supposed to appear as one of the DLC alternate costumes but was debunked.

===Fighting style===
Ryo&#x27;s fighting style is known as the Kyokugenryu Karate which he practices with Robert and his family. He earns the nickname, because of his remarkable use of his fighting style. Ryo&#x27;s basic move is the projectile which frequently appears differently in several games. Game designer Nobuyuki Kuroki joined SNK and to oversee his animations in the third game of the seriesm as he claims always admired previous works. 

For &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;94&quot;, the developers had difficulty balancing Ryo and Robert against the other characters and aimed to do so without removing any of their special moves. However, Ryo was said to be one of the game&#x27;s strongest characters. The &quot;The King of Fighters XIII&quot; development team wanted to distance Ryo&#x27;s style from those of Robert Garcia and Takuma Sakazaki since both employ the same techniques. Ryo&#x27;s moves were designed to show his strength. His moves leave him open, resulting in a useful version of his Tiger Fist for easier combos. His &quot;Neo Max&quot; move, the strongest type of move in the game, has the image of being , so his moves were finalized without difficulty. In &quot;Buriki One&quot;, Ryo&#x27;s gameplay was developed to convey a sense of realism alongside the rest of the cast to the point he cannot perform projectile maneuvers. In his other appearances as Mr. Karate, Ryo uses both his original moves as well as Takuma&#x27;s.

== Appearances ==
===In video games===
In the first &quot;Art of Fighting&quot;, Ryo and his best friend Robert Garcia go on a mission to save the former&#x27;s sister, Yuri, who was kidnapped by Mr. Big, a local criminal mastermind. The two martial artists manage to confront Mr. Big, leading him to a karate dojo where a masked man challenges the two to a fight. When Ryo prevails, Yuri appears to stop Ryo and reveals that the masked man is their father, Takuma. In the second game, &quot;Art of Fighting 2&quot;, Takuma reveals that the mafia overlord Geese Howard turned him into an assassin. With the Sakazaki family reunited, they, along with Robert, are focused on exacting their revenge on Geese and providing justice to those Geese had wronged. While entering into Geese&#x27;s tournament, The King of Fighters, Ryo defeats Geese who manages to escape with help from his assistants. In &quot;Art of Fighting 3: The Path of the Warrior&quot;, Ryo acts as a supporting character to Robert, as the game focuses on Robert and Yuri&#x27;s worldwide search for their missing friend. In his ending, Ryo expressed approval of Robert and Yuri&#x27;s apparent relationship. 

Ryo also appears as a guest character in &quot;Fatal Fury Special&quot;, an updated version of &quot;Fatal Fury 2&quot;. He appears as a hidden opponent at the end of the single-player mode and is a playable character in the home versions. In the PlayStation version of &quot;Fatal Fury: Wild Ambition&quot;, Ryo uses the title of &quot;Mr. Karate&quot;, as an aged and more powerful version of the character. Although he has appeared in no other unrelated games, he is referenced indirectly in &quot;&quot; by his own student, Marco Rodriguez. 

Ryo is a member of the Art of Fighting Team in the &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; series in his young form from &quot;Art of Fighting&quot;. Despite multiple changes to the team roster, Ryo remains a core member, seeking to promote his karate. Across the series, Ryo develops a close friendship with his former foe, Muay Thai fighter King, which his family supports. The spin-off games &quot;King of Fighters R-1&quot; and &quot;King of Fighters R-2&quot; feature Ryo as part of the South Town Team. He also appears in the spin-off &quot;The King of Fighters Kyo&quot;, in which he helps the main character Kyo Kusanagi find his girlfriend Yuki. The spin-off games &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot; also feature Ryo as a playable character with the latter also featuring an elder version of his &quot;Mr. Karate&quot; persona as a hidden character. He is present in the mobile phone games &quot;The King of Fighters All Star&quot; and &quot;Kimi wa Hero&quot; with the latter as his older &quot;Mr. Karate&quot; persona, and in his regular persona in the otome game &quot;King of Fighters for Girls&quot;. The &quot;KOF Chronicles&quot; mobile game features Ryo. He is also playable in &quot;The Rhythm Of Fighters&quot; and &quot;The King of Fighters Online&quot;. He again appears in his two personas in the mobile game &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;98 Unlimited Match Online&quot;.

Ryo is also a central character in the 1999 game &quot;Buriki One&quot; in his older persona and fights in a grappling tournament, employing regular karate as his fighting style in the World Grapple Tournament. In &quot;NeoGeo Battle Coliseum&quot;, Ryo goes by the name , while his look is the one used for &quot;Buriki One&quot;. He also stars in the crossover video games &quot;SNK vs. Capcom&quot; in his classic look. Despite not being playable in &quot;SNK Gals&#x27; Fighters&quot; and &quot;SNK Heroines: Tag Team Frenzy&quot;, he appears in Yuri&#x27;s endings. His appearance serves as a Mii costume for Nintendo&#x27;s fighting game &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;.

===In other media===
Ryo appears in the anime OVA version of &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; from 1993. While looking for a cat, Ryo and Robert witness a murder related to a stolen diamond. After fighting the murdering mobsters, they discover that the top mobster, Mr. Big, has kidnapped Ryo&#x27;s sister to exchange her for the diamond which he believes to be in the possession of the protagonists. He is voiced by Tetsuya Besho in the Japanese version, and by Alden Crews in the English adaptation. Two mangas based on the &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; games also follow Ryo and Robert&#x27;s journey. 

Ryo also appears in the manhua adaptations from &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; series, which tells how Ryo participates in the fighting tournaments. Manga and novels based on &quot;KOF&quot; also feature Ryo but in a smaller role. In the CGI animated series, &quot;The King of Fighters: Destiny&quot;, Ryo reprises his role from &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;94&quot; where they meet and befriend the Esaka Team. During the tournament, Ryo and Robert are possessed by the power of the creature Orochi but are saved by the Esaka members. There is also an episode that shows Ryo saving Yuri from the King&#x27;s forces based on the first &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; game. He also appears in the manga &quot;The King of Fighters: A New Beginning&quot; where he faces and defeats newcomer Shun&#x27;ei.

==Reception==
===Promotion and merchandise===

As part of an official partnership between SNK and Akiba, Ryo has appeared on an Akiba beer bottle label for one of their craft beers alongside other characters from &quot;Art of Fighting 3&quot; and &quot;Fatal Fury 3&quot;. In a cutscene from the first &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; game, Ryo says while he is driving a bike in his fighting clothes. According to &quot;PR Times&quot;, this became an internet meme based on how hilarious it is that a man is driving while wearing a karate gi. This became popular in some Internet communities, regardless of the excitement it generated among individuals. It then spread to the Westerns and has become one of the classic internet memes in the fighting game world, such as marketing for the visual novel &quot;The King of Fighters For Girls&quot;. Ryo&#x27;s birthday was parodied by SNK using marketing that also includes his bike meme. Several Japanese writers for multiple websites played the game specifically to enjoy such meme. Merchandise such as clothing based on it was developed. SNK artist Falcoon was caught by surprise when a friend showed him wearing a shirt featuring such a meme. For Netmarble&#x27;s &quot;The King of Fighters All Star&quot; mobile game, the original &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; meme involving Ryo was used. Developers behind &quot;All Star&quot; wondered if it was okay to use such a meme but and ended up okay to go along with celebrating the first anniversary of the game. As a result, they decided to go with &quot;a bang&quot;.

===Critical response===
In regards to how the media saw the character, Wesley Yin-Poole of &quot;Videogamer.com&quot; commented that Ryo and Robert are &quot;two double-hard bastards&quot;: The two were often compared to the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; protagonists Ryu and Ken Masters due to physical similarities and moves, eventually leading Capcom to create their joke character Dan Hibiki from the &quot;Street Fighter&quot;. Dan was meant to be a joke about both Ryo and Robert as SNK &quot;stole the talent&quot; from their own company when they started making their own &quot;Street Fighter&quot; sequels. &quot;IGN&quot; also compared Ryo with &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; characters based on the type of fighting techniques as well as designs with the former being noted to inspire &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom&quot;. While &quot;AnimeOnDVD&quot; enjoyed the contrast between Ryo and Robert in the &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; original video animation, whereas &quot;HardCoreGaming&quot; felt Ryo was unfaithful to the original game and &quot;awful&quot;. In &quot;Os reis da luta: representações do karate nos jogos digitais&quot;, Tiago Oviedo Frosi from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul wrote that Gichin Funakoshi&#x27;s &quot;Shōtōkan&quot; is the most practiced style of Karate in the world, this was the style chosen to characterize most of the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; characters. The Kyokugenryu Ryo uses in &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; instead comes across as a fantasy version of the &quot;knockout&quot; Kyokushinkaikan created by Mas Oyama who serves as an influence for both Ryu&#x27;s and Takuma&#x27;s characters. The writer noted that the character Ryo was a creation of SNK to openly oppose the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; series and Ryu. Ryo&#x27;s style is noted to be influenced by Gōgen Yamaguchi which contrasts Ryu&#x27;s Mas Oyama when they are put in crossover games. Frosi and Felipe Frosi from Universidade Federal do Ceará noted Ryo was a major contrast to his sister who came across as a replica of the idealized stereotype for women. As a result, Ryo comes across as a sexist who contrast the more modern views of a woman when opposing her growth as a warrior.

The character has also been popular for his crossover appeal in &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; and &quot;The King of Fighters&quot;. &quot;Den of Geek&quot; regarded his debut in &quot;Fatal Fury Special&quot; as the &quot;first real fighting game crossover&quot;. Gabriel Keene Von Koenig from Centro Universitário de Brasília Soares notes that Ryo&#x27;s inclusion in the &quot;Fatal Fury Special&quot; was iconic due to the iconic music SNK put in the game when Ryo appeared as a hidden boss. Souya Shinsuke from Futabanet drew parallels between Ryo and Akuma from &quot;Super Street Fighter II Turbo&quot; due to their iconic hidden inclusions which were made nearly the same time and both were the first the first fighting games to include such option. Both Ryo and Akuma are notable for giving the player a notable challenge to unlock but the writer still found them enjoyable to find despite admitting he also did not meet requirements. Ryo becoming a middle-aged fighter in &quot;Fatal Fury: Wild Ambition&quot; was noted to be more fitting to the story by &quot;Hardcore Gaming&quot; as it fits with the series&#x27; chronology more than &quot;Fatal Fury Special&quot; which had his adult persona. 

The site &quot;Hobby Consolas&quot; noted that Ryo debuted in &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;94&quot; and surprised fans due to the crossover appeal. &quot;Atomix&quot; found Ryo&#x27;s inclusion in Team Mexico confusing for the game since the character happens to be Japanese-American in contrast to Mexican fighters. &quot;Den of Geek&quot; criticized Ryo&#x27;s &quot;KOF&quot; characterization as one of the worst-developed characters due to how he plays the role of the &quot;straight man&quot;. From &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;96&quot; onwards, Tiago Oviedo Frosi noted Ryo imitates Oyama&#x27;s fighting pose while also borrowing elements from the Wadō-ryū karate created by Hironori Ōtsuka who was inspired by the Shotokan as well as the Jujutsu. His victory quote from &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;98&quot; &quot;Absolute karate. That&#x27;s Kyokugen. And don&#x27;t forget it, dweebenheimer&quot; has become known as one of SNK&#x27;s weirdest localization as dweebenheimer has no meaning.&quot;TheGamer&quot; noted his appearance in &quot;The King of Fighters XV&quot; abandoned his &quot;KOF &#x27;96&quot; stance from previous games in favor of his original &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; look, resulting in a bigger muscle tone as a result. Tiago Oviedo Frosi said the handling of Mr. Karate&#x27;s ego by Ryo and Takuma is noted to be influenced by the religion Shintoism, which inspired the mask of the Tengu creature that Takuma and Ryo often wear.

<text>In tabletop games and video games, game mechanics define how a game works for players. Game mechanics are the rules or ludemes that govern and guide player actions, as well as the game&#x27;s response to them. A rule is an instruction on how to play, while a ludeme is an element of play, such as the L-shaped move of the knight in chess. The interplay of various mechanics determines the game&#x27;s complexity and how the players interact with the game. All games use game mechanics; however, different theories disagree about their degree of importance to a game. The process and study of game design includes efforts to develop game mechanics that engage players. 

Common examples of game mechanics include turn-taking, movement of tokens, set collection, bidding, capture, and spell slots.

== Definition of term ==
There is no consensus on the precise definition of game mechanics. Competing definitions claim that game mechanics are:

* &quot;systems of interactions between the player and the game&quot; 
* &quot;the rules and procedures that guide the player and the game response to the player&#x27;s moves or actions&quot;
* &quot;more than what the player may recognize, they are only those things that impact the play experience&quot;

=== Game mechanics vs. theme ===
A game&#x27;s mechanics are not its theme. Some games have a theme—some element of representation. For example, in &quot;Monopoly,&quot; the events of the game represent another activity, the buying and selling of properties. Two games that are mechanically similar can be thematically different, and visa versa. The tension between a game&#x27;s mechanics and theme is ludonarrative dissonance.

Abstract games do not have themes, because the action is not intended to represent anything. Go is an example of an abstract game. 

=== Game mechanics vs. gameplay ===

Some game studies scholars distinguish between game mechanics and gameplay. In &quot;Playability and Player Experience Research&quot;, the authors define gameplay as &quot;the interactive gaming process of the player with the game.&quot; In this definition, gameplay occurs when players interact with the game mechanics. Similarly, in &quot;Dissecting Play – Investigating the Cognitive and Emotional Motivations and Affects of Computer Gameplay&quot;, the authors define gameplay as &quot;interacting with a game design in the performance of cognitive tasks&quot;. Video games researcher Carlo Fabricatore defines gameplay as:
* What the player can do
* What other entities can do, in response to player&#x27;s actions.
In &quot;Ernest Adams and Andrew Rollings on game design&quot;, the authors define gameplay as the combination and interaction of many elements of a game. 

However, popular usage sometimes elides the two terms. For example, gamedesigning.org defines gameplay as the core game mechanics that determine a game&#x27;s overall characteristics.

=== Categorization ===
Scholars organize game mechanics into categories, which they use (along with theme and gameplay) to classify games. For example, in &quot;Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design&quot;, Geoffrey Engelstein and Isaac Shalev classify game mechanisms into categories based on game structure, turn order, actions, resolution, victory conditions, uncertainty, economics, auctions, worker placement, movement, area control, set collection, and card mechanisms.

== Examples of game mechanics ==

The following examples of game mechanics are not a strict or complete taxonomy. This list is alphabetical.

=== Action points ===
Each player receives a budget of &quot;action points&quot; to use on each turn. These points may be spent on various actions according to the game rules, such as moving pieces, drawing cards, collecting money, etc.

=== Alignment ===
Alignment is a game mechanic in both tabletop role-playing games and role-playing video games. Alignment represents characters&#x27; moral and ethical orientation, such as good or evil. In some games, a player character&#x27;s alignment permits or prohibits the use of additional game mechanics. For example, in &quot;Shin Megami Tensei: Strange Journey Redux&quot;, alignment determines which demon assistants a player can or cannot recruit, and in Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords, players aligned with the light and dark sides of The Force gain different bonuses to attacks, healing, and speed.
===Auction or bidding===
Some games use an auction or bidding system in which the players make competitive bids to determine which player wins the right to perform particular actions. Such an auction can be based on different forms of payment:
* The winning bidder must pay for the won privilege with some form of game resource (game money, points, etc.). For example, &quot;Ra&quot; uses this mechanic.
* The auction is a form of a promise that the winner will achieve some outcome in the near future. If this outcome is not achieved, the bidder pays a penalty. Such a system is used in many trick-taking games, such as contract bridge.

=== Capture/eliminate ===

In some games, the number of tokens a player has on the playing surface represents their current strength in the game. A central goal is &quot;capturing&quot; an opponent&#x27;s tokens, which removes them from the playing surface.

Captures can be achieved in a number of ways:
* Moving one of one&#x27;s own tokens into a space occupied by an opposing token (e.g. chess, parchisi), also known as a &quot;replacement capture&quot; or &quot;displacement capture&quot;.
** If the space immediately opposite must either be off the board or a marked &quot;trap&quot; space, it is known as a &quot;push&quot; capture.
* Jumping a token over the space immediately occupied by an opposing token (e.g. draughts), known as a &quot;jump&quot; or &quot;leap&quot;.
** When the opposing token can be any distance along an unobstructed line, it is known as a &quot;flying&quot; capture.
* Occupying the adjacent squares of an opposing token (e.g. tafl), also known as a &quot;custodian capture&quot;, &quot;custodianship&quot; or &quot;interception&quot;.
* Occupying one immediately adjacent square to an opposing token, also known as &quot;approach&quot;.
* The reverse of approach: capturing an adjacent opposing token by moving away from it in a straight line (e.g. fanorona), also known as &quot;withdrawal&quot;. 
* Capturing two opposing tokens by occupying the single square separating them, also known as &quot;intervention&quot;.
* Declaring an &quot;attack&quot; on an opposing token, and then determining the outcome of the attack, either in a deterministic way by the game rules (e.g. &quot;Stratego&quot;, &quot;Illuminati&quot;), or by using a randomizing method (e.g. &quot;&quot;).
* Surrounding a token or region with one&#x27;s own tokens in some manner (e.g. go), also known as &quot;enclosure&quot;.
* Playing cards or other game resources to capture tokens.
* Other specialized mechanisms that do not fall neatly into any of the above categories.

In some games, captured tokens are simply removed and play no further part in the game (e.g. chess). In others, captured tokens are removed but can return to play later in the game under various rules (e.g. backgammon, pachisi). Some games allow the capturing player to take possession of the captured tokens and use them later in the game (e.g. Shogi, Reversi, Illuminati), also known as &quot;conversion&quot;.

Many video games express the capture mechanism in the form of a kill count (sometimes referred to as &quot;frags&quot;), reflecting the number of opposing pawns eliminated during the game.

=== Chance and randomization ===
==== Dice ====


The most common use of dice is to randomly determine the outcome of an interaction in a game. An example is a player rolling a die or dice to determine how many board spaces to move a game token.

Dice often determine the outcomes of in-game conflict between players, with different outcomes of the die/dice roll of different benefit (or adverse effect) to each player involved. This occurs in games that simulate direct conflicts of interest.

Different dice formulas are used to generate different probability curves. A single die has equal probability of landing on any particular side, and consequently produces a linear probability distribution curve. The sum of two or more dice, however, results in a bell curve-shaped probability distribution, with the addition of further dice resulting in a steeper bell curve, decreasing the likelihood of an extreme result. A linear curve is generally perceived by players as being more &quot;swingy&quot;, whereas a bell curve is perceived as being more &quot;fair&quot;.

==== Risk and reward ====
Some games include situations where players can &quot;press their luck&quot; in optional actions where the danger of a risk must be weighed against the chance of reward. For example, in &quot;&quot;, players may elect to take a &quot;Risk&quot;, with success yielding cards and failure weakening the player&#x27;s ultimate chance of victory.

=== Crafting ===
Crafting new in-game items is a game mechanic in open world survival video games such as &quot;Minecraft&quot; and &quot;Palworld&quot;, role-playing video games such as &quot;&quot; and &quot;Stardew Valley,&quot; tabletop role-playing games such as &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons,&quot; and deck-building card games such as &quot;Mystic Vale&quot;. Crafting mechanics rely on set collection mechanics, since crafting new items requires obtaining specific sets of items, then transforming them into new ones.

=== Modes ===
A &quot;game mode&quot; is a distinct configuration that varies gameplay and affects how other game mechanics behave. A game with several modes presents different settings in each, changing how a particular element of the game is played. 

A common example is the choice between single-player and multiplayer modes in video games, where multiplayer can further be cooperative or competitive. A sandbox mode allows free play without predefined goals. In a Time Attack Mode, the player tries to score, progress or clear levels in a limited amount of time.

Changing modes while the game is in progress can increase difficulty and provide additional challenge or reward player success. Power-ups are modes that last for a few moments or that change only one or a few game rules. For example, power pellets in Pac-Man give the player a temporary ability to eat enemies.

A game mode may restrict or change the behavior of the available tools, such as allowing play with limited/unlimited ammo, new weapons, obstacles or enemies, or a timer, etc. A mode may establish different rules and game mechanics, such as altered gravity, win at first touch in a fighting game, or play with some cards face-up in a poker game. A mode may even change a game&#x27;s overarching goals, such as following a story or character&#x27;s career vs. playing a limited deathmatch or capture the flag set.

===Movement===
Many board games involve the movement of tokens. Movement mechanics govern how and when these tokens are allowed to move. 

Some game boards are divided into small, equally-sized areas that can be occupied by game tokens. (Often such areas are called squares, even if not square in shape.) Movement rules specify how and when a token can be moved to another area. For example, a player may be allowed to move a token to an adjacent area, but not one further away. Dice are sometimes used to randomize the allowable movements. Other games, such as miniatures games, are played on surfaces with no marked areas.

=== Resource management ===
Many games involve the management of resources. Examples of game resources include tokens, money, land, natural resources, human resources and game points. Players establish relative values for various types of available resources, in the context of the current state of the game and the desired outcome (i.e. winning the game). Game rules determine how players can increase, spend, or exchange resources. The skillful management of resources lets players influence the game&#x27;s outcome.

===Set collection===
==== Engine building ====
Engine building is a mechanism that involves building and optimizing a system to create a flow of resources. &quot;SimCity&quot; is an example of an engine-building video game: money activates building mechanisms, which in turn unlock feedback loops between many internal resources such as people, job vacancies, power, transport capacity, and zone types. In engine-building board games, the player adds and modifies combinations of abilities or resources to assemble a virtuous circle of increasingly powerful and productive outcomes.

==== Tile-laying ====

Many games use tiles - flat, rigid pieces of a regular shape - that can be laid down on a flat surface to form a tessellation. Usually, such tiles have patterns or symbols on their surfaces that combine when tessellated to form game-mechanically significant combinations.

The tiles themselves are often drawn at random by the players, either immediately before placing them on the playing surface, or in groups to form a pool or hand of tiles from which the player may select one to play.

Tiles can be used in two distinct ways:
* The playing of a tile itself is directly significant to the outcome of the game, in that where and when it is played contributes points or resources to the player.
* Tiles are used to build a board upon which other game tokens are placed, and the interaction of those tokens with the tiles provides game points or resources.

Examples of tile mechanics include: &quot;Scrabble&quot;, in which players lay down lettered tiles to form words and score points, and &quot;Tikal&quot;, in which players lay jungle tiles on the play surface then move tokens through them to score points.

=== Turns ===
A turn is a segment of a game set aside for certain actions to happen before moving on to the next turn, where the sequence of events can largely repeat. Some games, such as &quot;Monopoly&quot; and chess, use &quot;player turns&quot; where one player performs their actions before another player can perform any on their turn. Some games use &quot;game turns&quot;, where all players contribute to the actions of a single turn. Some games combine the two. For example, &quot;Civilization&quot; uses a series of player turns followed by a trading round in which all players participate. 

Games with semi-simultaneous turns allow for some actions on another player&#x27;s turn.

=== Victory conditions ===
Victory conditions control how a player wins the game. In many games, victory is achieved by a player who accumulates a sufficiently high score, or a higher score than any other player. Other examples of victory conditions include the necessity of completing a quest in a role-playing video game, or the player being suitably trained in a skill in a business game. Some games also feature a losing condition, such as being checkmated in chess, or being tagged in tag. In such a game, the winner is the only remaining player to have avoided loss. Games are not limited to one victory or loss condition, and can combine several at once. Tabletop role-playing games and sandbox games frequently have no victory condition.

==== Catch-up ====
Some games include a mechanism designed to make progress towards victory more difficult for players in the lead. The idea behind this is to allow trailing players a chance to catch up and potentially still win the game, rather than suffer an inevitable loss once they fall behind. For example, in &quot;The Settlers of Catan,&quot; a neutral piece (the robber) debilitates the resource generation of players whose territories it is near. Players occasionally get to move the robber, and frequently choose to position it where it will cause maximal disruption to the player currently winning the game. In some racing games, such as &quot;Chutes and Ladders,&quot; a player must roll or spin the exact number needed to reach the finish line; e.g., if a player is only four spaces from the finish line then they must roll a four on the die or land on the four with the spinner. If more than four is rolled, then the turn is forfeited to the next player.

=== Worker placement ===
Worker placement is a game mechanism where players allocate a limited number of tokens (&quot;workers&quot;) to multiple stations that provide various defined actions. The worker placement mechanism originates with board games. Stewart Woods identifies &quot;Keydom&quot; (1998; later remade and updated as &quot;Aladdin&#x27;s Dragons&quot;) as the first game to implement the mechanic. Worker placement was popularized by &quot;Caylus&quot; (2005) and became a staple of the Eurogame genre in the wake of the game&#x27;s success. Other popular board games that use this mechanism include &quot;Stone Age&quot; and &quot;Agricola&quot;. Although the mechanism is chiefly associated with board games, the worker placement concept has been used in analysis of other game types. For instance, Adams and Dormans describe the assigning of tasks to SCV units in the real-time strategy game &quot;StarCraft&quot; as an example of the worker placement mechanic.

<text>Hawaii Baptist Academy (HBA) is a private, co-educational, college preparatory primary and secondary Christian school that serves grades K-12 on three campuses. The school is governed by a board of directors elected by the executive board of the Hawaii Pacific Baptist Convention, an affiliate of the Southern Baptist Convention.

==History==

In 1944 the Woman&#x27;s Missionary Union of Virginia pledged $125,000 toward a school in Hawaii. The Southern Baptist Convention Foreign Mission Board began the school in 1947, assigning Southern Baptist Convention missionaries Hugh P. and Mary McCormick to carry out the project.

The school opened in 1949 in surplus Army barracks on a parcel of land purchased at 1234 Heulu Street in Makiki with thirty-six seventh and eighth grade students. It graduated its first students in 1954. The school was transferred to the Hawaii Baptist Convention in 1960. Formerly located near Roosevelt High School in Makiki, it moved to its present location in Nuuanu Valley in Honolulu in 1975. In 1987, the elementary school was moved to a second campus one half of a mile away. Hawaii Baptist Academy is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges and is the largest Baptist school in the state.

Before relocating to the current Middle and High School campus in Nuuanu, HBA held court for some time at Makiki Christian Church.

In 1972, the governing body of the Southern Baptist churches authorized purchase of the Robertson Estate on the Pali Highway for $553,000. Dan Kong resigned his ministry at Olivet Baptist Church in order to become Vice President and Development Director of the school in 1973. In order to raise funding for the purchase, Kong and Hawaii Baptist Academy president Stan Sagert began a fund raising tour among potential mainland donars and institutions. By 1977, they had created the Mainland Advisory Council. Overall, mainland contributions have accounted for 70 percent of campus building costs.

The Nuuanu Campus, now called the Stan Sagert Campus, welcomed its first students in 1975 with the class of 1976 being the first to graduate from the new campus. The elementary campus shared grounds with Central Baptist Church until it moved to the former Sacred Hearts Convent in Nuuanu. HBA also had a small elementary campus in Nānākuli (West Oahu), located at Nānākuli Baptist Church. This campus was relocated to property in Waianae in the mid-1980s, where it remained until it was eventually closed in 1997. 

==Current==

In 2006, HBA opened the Dan Kong Middle School Campus, adjacent to the current high school campus and named in honor of Dan Kong, former president of Hawaii Baptist Academy and pastor of various churches around the island, including First Baptist Church of Wahiawa, Olivet Baptist Church, and Central Baptist Church. He helped form organizations such as the Mainland Advisory Council, which consists of donors from the U.S. mainland.

The middle school campus consists of 14 classrooms, a computer lab, two specially equipped science classrooms, and a multi-purpose room for middle school students. The HBA Middle School Campus was designed by the firm of Walters, Kimura, Motoda and it has been noted to be a LEED gold facility since it was designed to be environmental friendly and sustainable.

Since 1997, HBA has operated under a modified school calendar, with two-week breaks in October, December, and March, and a two-month summer break in June and July.

Beginning with the 2007–08 school year, a uniform dress standard with school-endorsed polo shirts, skirts, and pants was instituted. The original uniform polo shirts were embroidered with &quot;HBA&quot; on the left sleeve, and were available in black, white, green, and yellow. The uniforms were updated in the 2016-17 school year with the removal of the embroidered letters, the elimination of green and yellow polo shirts, and the addition of a large school logo on the left breast.

Hawaii Baptist Academy&#x27;s middle school robotics team placed fifth out of 104 middle school teams in the 2011 VEX Robotics World Championships in Orlando held April 14 to 16. Three of the top five teams in the Orlando championship came from China. In third place was a team from Arizona.

In 2017, eighth grader Logan Kakugawa won the Hawaii State Geographic Bee and represented the state of Hawaii at the national competition in Washington, D.C. During the same year, the high school&#x27;s Mock Trial team celebrated their first state championship.

==Campuses==
The Richard Bento, Dan Kong, and Stan Sagert campuses house the elementary, middle, and high schools, respectively. The digital school is headquartered on the high school campus. The administrative headquarters are in a separate location. All campuses are in the Honolulu census-designated place.

==Scandals==

In 2009, Jeremy Ryan Duffer, who had been previously employed by HBA as a part-time Bible teacher, was arrested in Virginia and accused of multiple counts of consensual sex with a juvenile. Duffer subsequently pleaded guilty in 2010 to one count of an indecent act with a child as well as eight counts of aggravated sexual battery, and is currently serving a 17 year sentence. HBA President Richard Bento remarked that Duffer&#x27;s arrest was &quot;shocking,&quot; and that he was personally unaware of any suspicions or allegations against Duffer at the time of his employment with the school.

In 2012, Hawaii News Now reported that a male teacher at HBA had allegedly engaged in sexual relations with a 17 year old male senior student. According to the report, one sexual encounter was alleged to have occurred at Pu&#x27;u Kahea Conference Center, a camping facility in Waianae at which students from grades 7 through 12 spend time annually. The teacher, who had been employed for two years, resigned due to the allegations. The report notes that HBA maintains a strict religious code of conduct that explicitly forbids homosexual behavior as &quot;sexually immoral.&quot;

<text>Coles is a Canadian bookstore chain owned by Indigo Books and Music. Coles is Indigo&#x27;s brand for small-scale bookstores in locations such as shopping malls. Some locations are operated as SmithBooks, and the company has recently begun to open selected small-format locations as &quot;IndigoSpirit&quot;.

==History==
In 1940, two brothers, Carl Cole and Jack Cole, opened their first bookstore in Toronto, near to the University of Toronto on Bloor Street near Spadina Avenue. Prior to opening the store they had operated a &quot;pushcart&quot;, buying up textbooks at the end of the school year and reselling them in the fall.

At the age of 11, the Coles were living in foster homes in Detroit and eventually Toronto. With the little amount of money they had, they were able to open their first store (paying rent daily as they could not afford the monthly rent payments). With no retail experience, the Cole brothers turned their store into what was once Canada&#x27;s largest bookstore chain.

Jack and Carl Cole are also responsible for inventing Coles Notes. Coles Notes began when students at a local high school were having trouble translating a French paper. Jack and Carl hired someone to translate the book and sold over 1,000 copies. The original Coles Notes were typed up by Mrs. Alcorn, and produced by mimeograph machine. (Mrs. Alcorn stayed with Coles Bookstores as long as it remained in the hands of the Coles brothers.) Coles Notes have sold over 80,000,000 copies worldwide, and served as the foundation for the similar Cliffs Notes which are published in the U.S.

Jack Cole was an avid collector of Canadian books, and in the late 1960s started reprinting affordable, paperbound facsimile editions of scarce and rare Canadian history titles, such as George M. Grant&#x27;s &quot;Ocean to Ocean: Sandford Fleming&#x27;s expedition through Canada in 1872&quot;. Previous to the Cole&#x27;s edition a history buff or student either had to pay a premium for the original edition if it could be found, have access to the rare book collection at a major library, or buy an expensive limited-edition reprint from a historical society or university press.

Not missing a trick, the Coles established ownership of critical trade names by establishing and registering their use in Canada. They published books under the banner of Waldenbooks, so when K-Mart wanted to introduce their captive book chain into Canada, they found that &quot;Waldenbooks&quot; was already registered and in use. K-Mart was free to set up bookstores, just not Waldenbooks. They followed a similar ploy by having stores do business under the &quot;Borders&quot; name, as a blocking move.

In addition to the flagship brand, known for many years as &quot;Coles - the Book People!&quot;, the company operated the self-proclaimed World&#x27;s Biggest Bookstore in downtown Toronto, as well as two other bookstore banners, Active Minds and The Book Company.

In 1978, Jack and Carl sold Coles to Southam Inc. In April 1995, Southam resold the company to Pathfinder Capital, which one year earlier had acquired Coles&#x27; main rival, SmithBooks. That chain consisted of the Canadian former operations of British bookstore chain W H Smith (1950-1989), which had first been sold to Canadian owners in 1989.

The merged company, Chapters Inc., opened Canada&#x27;s first two book superstores under the &quot;Chapters&quot; brand in November 1995. The smaller-format bookstores retained their existing names, but over time many of these locations have been converted to the Coles banner. A handful of SmithBooks stores continue to operate as of late 2008, but even in these cases staff uniforms and shopping bags bear the &quot;Coles&quot; name.

Indigo purchased Chapters, and in turn Coles, in 2001. A number of Coles locations continue to operate in Canada as of 2013, primarily in suburban shopping malls, though many have been closed in recent years, especially if located in close proximity to an Indigo or Chapters location, with others converted into IndigoSpirit stores.

==Expansion into the United States==
After dominating the Canadian book market by the early 1970s, Coles found little opportunity for further growth within Canada and Jack Coles decided to explore further expansion south of the border by opening new &quot;Coles - the Book People!&quot; stores in the rapidly expanding United States market.

The first store in the United States was opened in Buffalo, New York, in 1973. By 1980, there were 56 stores in the United States with more being opened. In 1987, Southam decided to sell or close the U.S. stores since the stores were not generating enough profit. A few months later 52 U.S. stores were sold to K-Mart and were converted into Waldenbooks stores.

<doc id="1012184" wikidata="Q984122" url="?curid=1012184" title="Rafael Cortijo">
<text>Rafael Antonio Cortijo Verdejo (December 11, 1928 – October 3, 1982) was a Puerto Rican musician, orchestra leader, composer and percussion instrument craftsman.

==Early career==
As a child, Cortijo became interested in Caribbean music and enjoyed the works of some of the era&#x27;s most successful Bomba y Plena music musicians. Throughout his life, he had a chance to meet and work with some of them, and learned how to make his own congas and pleneras, the handheld drums used in bomba and plena music.

Salsa composer and singer Ismael Rivera met Cortijo when both were youngsters, as they both grew up in the Villa Palmeras neighborhood of Santurce; they became lifelong friends. Rivera was impressed with Cortijo&#x27;s conga-playing skills and was asked to join his orchestra, which played at Fiestas patronales all over Puerto Rico.

“Cortijo himself was discovered, or given his earliest encouragement by “Mr. Babalú,” the celebrated Cuban singer Miguelito Valdés. Getting his formal start in 1942 as a bongo player with Conjunto Monterey, the young Cortijo played with a range of groups in those years and made a radio appearance with Trio Matamoros. But its breakthrough came in 1954 when he joined pianist Rafael Ithier on the Secco label with his soulmate Ismael Rivera…”

==Later career==

By 1954, Cortijo was a member of &quot;El Combo&quot;. His big break with the group came when El Combo&#x27;s leader and pianist, Mario Román, left the band to Cortijo expecting to return to the band after a New York gig with Myrta Silva. Román never returned to the band in pursuit of other interests in New York&#x27;s Latin music scene. Ismael Rivera, then the lead singer of Lito Peña&#x27;s Orquesta Panamericana, joined Cortijo&#x27;s orchestra known as Cortijo y su Combo in 1955. From then until 1960, his orchestra played live on Puerto Rican television shows (sometime in the 1960s, they became the house band at La Taberna India).

Later on, Cortijo created another orchestra, &quot;El Bonche&quot; (Rafael Cortijo Y Su Bonche), where he was joined by his adopted niece, Fe Cortijo. Fe then became a well known singer on her own. Marvin Santiago became part of Cortijo&#x27;s line-up around this time. With the group, Marvin Santiago recorded &quot;Ahí Na Má! Put It There&quot; (1968).Santiago&#x27;s first recorded tracks appeared on Rafael Cortijo Y Su Bonche&#x27;s album &quot;Ahí Na Má! Put It There&quot;, released in 1968. Two of the tracks recorded where Santiago provided lead vocals, &quot;Vasos En Colores&quot; and &quot;La Campana Del Lechón&quot;, were later recorded by Santiago as a solo artist. Santiago provided background vocals on other tracks from the album. Santiago also provided lead vocals for &quot;Vasos En Colores&quot; and &quot;La Campana Del Lechón&quot;, which were later recorded by Santiago as a solo artist.

Cortijo and Rivera went on to live in New York City. Cortijo, then, soon returned to Puerto Rico, where the composer, Tite Curet Alonso, forged a friendship with the impoverished star and helped Cortijo produce a comeback album.

===Cortijo y su Combo===
In 1954, Cortijo y su Combo was composed of Rafael Ithier on piano, Cortijo on timbal, Roberto Roena on bongo, Martín Quiñones on congas, Eddie Pérez (the &quot;female&quot; voice of the choros) and as singer the sonero Ismael Rivera. In addition to Miguel Cruz on bass, Kiko Vélez and Mario Cora played trumpet.

“Aside from its strikingly new musical sound and best-selling recordings, Cortijo y su Combo was also an act, an all-black performative presence on the cultural stage that had the effect of challenging many of the long-held values and prejudices of the national culture. Most significantly, they achieved immense and startling visibility on television – starring frequently in memorable showcase appearances in popular shows such as &quot;La Taberna India&quot; and &quot;El show del Mediodía&quot;.”

Ismael Rivera recorded the following songs with Cortijo y su Combo:

*&quot;El Bombón de Elena&quot;
*&quot;El Negro Bembón&quot;
*&quot;Juan José&quot;
*&quot;Besitos de Coco&quot;
*&quot;Palo Que Tú Me Das&quot;
*&quot;Quítate de la Vía Perico&quot;
*&quot;Oriza&quot;
*&quot;El Chivo de la Campana&quot;
*&quot;Maquinolandera&quot;
*&quot;El Yayo&quot;
*&quot;María Teresa&quot;
*&quot;Yo Soy del Campo&quot;
The orchestra virtually disbanded in 1962 when Ismael Rivera was arrested for drug possession in Panama. According to later reports, various band members concealed illegal drug shipments regularly since they were rarely intercepted at Customs; in this particular occasion an inspection was indeed made, and Rivera willingly took the bulk of the rap for the entire group (including Cortijo, who was deeply affected by Rivera&#x27;s plea and regretted it through the rest of his life).Their friendship was so important to Rivera, that when Cortijo died, Rivera said he would no longer sing. Rafael Ithier and other bandmates went on to found Puerto Rico&#x27;s salsa group, &quot;El Gran Combo&quot;.

In 1973 Cortijo happened to meet the pianist working at WKDM radio in New York, Pepe Castillo, who provided ideas for arrangements that Cortijo would use in his final album, &quot;His Time Machine y su Máquina del Tiempo.&quot; Coco Records reunited all the former members of &quot;Cortijo y su Combo&quot; orchestra for a one-time-only concert and a subsequent studio recording was issued in 1974.
The sound of the album was completely unique than his past works, since Castillo provided a fusion of Latin folklore and jazz in his arrangements that were not popularized at that time. Rafael Cortijo became well known across Latin America. He attributed his success to the sound of his percussion, according to Cortijo, Afro-Caribbean music was known worldwide. A member of the Conjunto Monterrey, based in Monterrey, Mexico, he later toured with Daniel Santos&#x27; orchestra and worked on radio.

==Death==
Cortijo died of pancreatic cancer on October 3, 1982, at his sister Rosa Cortijo&#x27;s apartment in the Luis Llorens Torres public housing project in Santurce, Puerto Rico. He was buried at Cementerio San José in San Juan, Puerto Rico. He was posthumously inducted into the International Latin Music Hall of Fame.

<doc id="1012189" wikidata="Q128913" url="?curid=1012189" title="List of islands of Tuvalu">
<text>Tuvalu consists of nine separate islands: six atolls and three reef islands. An atoll typically consists of several motus: Tuvalu has a total of 124 islands and islets. Each island is surrounded by a coral reef. The soils of Tuvalu&#x27;s islands are usually shallow, porous, alkaline, coarse-textured, with carbonate mineralogy and high pH values of up to 8.2 to 8.9. The soils are usually deficient in most of the important nutrients needed for plant growth, so garden beds need to be enhanced with mulch to increase their fertility. Tuvalu&#x27;s small, widely scattered atolls have a total land area of only about making Tuvalu the fourth-smallest country in the world. 

The sea level at the Funafuti tide gauge has been rising at a rate of 3.9 mm per year, and it has been determined that rising sea levels are causing more wave energy to be transferred across reef surfaces, which has tended to push more sand onto island shorelines, increasing islands’ land area. Over a recent four-decade period, there was a net increase in the land area of the islets of 2.9% (73.5 ha), although the changes were not uniform: About 74% of them increased in size and about 27% decreased in size.

==Islands of Tuvalu==
The islands of Tuvalu are spread out between the latitude of 5° to 10° south and longitude of 176° to 180°, west of the International Date Line.

The name, Tuvalu, means &quot;eight standing together&quot; in Tuvaluan.

The Coral reefs of Tuvalu consists of three reef islands and six atolls, containing approximately of reef platforms. The reef islands have a different structure to the atolls, and are perhaps better described as “reef platforms,” as they are small, tabular platforms that lack the salt-water lagoon typically found on reef islands. The reef platforms do have a completely enclosed rim of dry land, and the rim surrounds the remnants of a lagoon, but these lagoon remnants have no connection to the open sea, and tend to dry up as coral debris accumulates in them over time. For example, Niutao has two brackish, saline lakes which are the degraded remnants of an ancient lagoon.

The smallest island, Niulakita, which is the ninth island in the Tuvaluan archipelago, has not been continuously inhabited. It has been privately owned since 1944, when the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony administration purchased the island and granted people from Vaitupu permission to settle there. However, in 1949, a successor administration made the controversial decision to expel the Vaitupuans from Niulakita, and arrange for residents of Niutao to settle there instead, because Niutao was considered to be overpopulated. Niulakita is a separate local government district, but it is administered as part of Niutao, and is represented in the Parliament of Tuvalu by members of the constituency of Niutao.

At least 11 islands are inhabited, expanded over the biggest isles of the nine atolls, plus two islands in Funafuti. Tuvalu has ISO 3166-2 codes defined for 1 town council (Funafuti) and 7 island councils. Niulakita, which now has its own island council, is not listed as it is administered as part of Niutao.

==Royal Society of London investigation of the formation of coral reefs at Funafuti==


An expedition (&quot;Funafuti Coral Reef Boring Expedition of the Royal Society&quot;) under Professor William Sollas of Oxford University, conducted by the Royal Society of London carried out drilling on the coral reef at Funafuti in 1896, 1897 and 1898.

HMS &quot;Penguin&quot;, under the command of Captain Arthur Mostyn Field, delivered the 1896 expedition to Funafuti in the Ellice Islands, arriving on 21 May 1896, and returned to Sydney on 22 August 1896. From 1896 to 1899 the &quot;Penguin&quot; was under the command of Captain Arthur Mostyn Field and her surveying work included further voyages to Funafuti atoll to deliver the expeditions of the Royal Society in 1897 and 1898. The surveys carried out by the &quot;Penguin&quot; resulted in the preparation of the Admiralty Nautical Chart 2983 for the islands.

The Royal Society of London were investigating the formation of coral reefs and whether traces of shallow-water organisms could be found at depth in the coral of Pacific atolls. Three expeditions used drilling equipment to take core samples of the coral reef. The boreholes on Fongafale islet are at the site now called &quot;Darwin&#x27;s Drill&quot;, A goal of the expeditions was to drill down to confirm that the coral material was located on a base of volcanic rock. This investigation followed the work on the structure and distribution of coral reefs conducted by Charles Darwin in the Pacific. However, the geologic history of atolls is more complex than Darwin (1842) and Davis (1928) envisioned.

===First expedition (1896)===
The expedition was led by Professor William Johnson Sollas of the University of Oxford and included Professor Edgeworth David and Walter George Woolnough of the University of Sydney.

===Second expedition (1897)===
The expedition was led by Professor Edgeworth David of the University of Sydney (that included George Sweet as second-in-command, and Walter George Woolnough).

===Third expedition (1898)===
The expedition was led by Alfred Edmund Finckh of the University of Sydney.

==Results of the Royal Society expeditions==
The purpose of the expedition was to attempt to settle the question as to the formation of coral atolls. The first expedition experienced defects in the boring machinery and the bore penetrated only slightly more than 100 feet (approx. 31 m). The second expedition reached a depth of 557 feet (170 m). The third expedition was successful in carrying the bore to 1,114 feet (340 m). The results provided support for Charles Darwin&#x27;s theory of subsidence; in which there are four stages in development of coral reefs: a volcanic island forms, is surrounded by a fringing coral reef, as it subsides slowly a wide barrier reef forms, then after it has sunk below sea level the coral continues to grow forming a circular atoll. However, the geologic history of atolls is more complex than Darwin (1842) and Davis (1920 &amp; 1928) envisioned.

==Structure of Funafuti atoll==
The average depth in the Funafuti lagoon (&quot;Te Namo&quot;) is about 20 fathoms (36.5 metres or 120 feet).

<doc id="1012204" wikidata="Q5332216" url="?curid=1012204" title="Ecclesbourne Valley Railway">
<text>The Ecclesbourne Valley Railway is a long heritage railway based at
Wirksworth station in Derbyshire, England. It operates passenger services between and Wirksworth, with occasional services to .

Passengers can board and alight heritage services at Duffield, where a platform was reopened in 2011. The station is shared with National Rail services on the Midland Main Line between and , with local services between , , and , which call at platforms 1 and 2; EVR trains to Wirksworth use platform 3. The station is sited in Duffield village centre, just a few minutes from shops, cafés and pubs.

The Ecclesbourne Valley Railway is named after the River Ecclesbourne and the track follows the river from its source to its confluence with the River Derwent at the Derbyshire village of Duffield.
Despite being a branch in itself, there is also a separate branch operating from platform 3 at Wirksworth, up a 4% incline to Ravenstor (for the National Stone Centre and the High Peak Trail).

The line is operated by heritage steam locomotives, including no. 2746 Bagnall saddle tank engine &quot;The Duke&quot;, and diesels include a BRCW Type 3 and a Brush Type 2.

==History==

===Origin===
The &quot;Wirksworth Branch&quot; was the product of early 19th century railway rivalry. Since 1835, Wirksworth&#x27;s citizens had been promoting various ideas for a branch line from the North Midland Railway, later the Midland Railway, at . The Midland was initially unenthusiastic, but then realised that the branch could be extended to Rowsley, albeit with difficulty, avoiding the section from , on its Manchester, Buxton, Matlock and Midlands Junction Railway, which was shared with its rival the London and North Western Railway (LNWR).
It is for this reason that all of the bridges along the line, including the one which simply has a head shunt under it (Cemetery Lane), are built to the double-tracked grand Midland Railway style.

===Construction===
The line was surveyed in 1862 and received Parliamentary assent in the following year. It would follow the valley of the River Ecclesbourne with no major obstacles apart from the final climb into Wirksworth. A cutting was required and some buildings were demolished, while there was considerable upheaval in Duffield.

The final inspection of the line was carried out by Colonel J.A. Rich of the Royal Engineers on 26 September 1867, who approved the line for opening.

The line was opened to Wirksworth on 1 October 1867 and was worked initially by the Staff System.

Under the original scheme, it would have descended from Wirksworth to Cromford using a tunnel and a long viaduct, then proceed parallel to the existing line, but on the west side of the river through Matlock to Rowsley.

However, when the lease expired on the original Ambergate line, the LNWR withdrew and the Midland acquired complete control; thus the section beyond Wirksworth was never built. The Midland was left with one of its few branch lines, and one which, it felt, was of questionable viability.

===Operation===
The presence of the line allowed Wirksworth&#x27;s limestone business to develop, the carriage of which was its mainstay until the middle of the 20th century. There was also farm produce, particularly milk, in 1906, and a number of textile mills (Wirksworth had the dubious distinction of being the main supplier of red tape for the London Government Departments). It saw a regular passenger service, with stations at Hazlewood (about from the village down a steep hill and originally called Windley), Shottle (originally Cowers Lane) and Idridgehay.

There were three, rising to six, passenger trains from Derby each way, with one on Sunday, and two goods trains. Howevet, by 1939, milk was carried instead by road and, during World War II, passenger travel was severely curtailed. There was also the hourly no. 37 bus, which led to a decline in passenger numbers. Passenger trains were temporarily suspended in 1947 and were officially ceased in 1949. An hourly (five on Sundays) direct bus service (Trentbarton route 6.1) still operates (2014) between Wirksworth and Derby with a journey time of 50 minutes.

Rolling stock at various times included steam motor carriages from the Morecambe and Heysham Railway at the beginning of the century, and steam railmotors from the Yarmouth &amp; North Norfolk Railway. In the early 1950s, people near the line were treated to the eerie sight of a railway carriage ghosting along, apparently by itselfthe test vehicle for the new diesel railcars being designed in Derbynothing more than a standard coach with the mechanism fitted and a windscreen cut in each end for the driver – that presaged a major change in British rail travel. When the so-called Derby Lightweights were produced, they were each tested on the line after leaving the workshop. One of the only three surviving of those originally built, M79900, was converted from being the IRIS test car back to passenger carrying standard and has been joined recently by the other two, residing on the line on which they were originally tested some 60 years ago.

=== Rail accident ===
On 25 August 1981, a rail accident occurred when a fully laden freight train partially derailed south of Wirksworth.

===Decline and closure===
Although most of the goods had transferred to the roads, limestone traffic continued, including that formerly hauled by the Cromford and High Peak Railway, when it closed in 1967. Though the amount of traffic justified the installation of some continuous welded rail in the 1980s, production was increasingly of aggregate carried by road. In 1991, the quarries passed to Croxton and Garry Ltd (which later became Omya UK) which no longer needed a rail link. Although its sidings, and the station goods yard, at Wirksworth are still listed by Network Rail, the connection to the main line at Duffield has been severed and fenced off, There is hope that one day the EVR could &quot;once possible funding would be made&quot; purchase and reuse both the goods yard and the sidings for further/extra space for some rolling stock and train storage.

==Present day==

===Preservation===
In 1996, WyvernRail was awarded a Light Railway Order for the full length of the whole line.

Wirksworth station was reopened in 2002, with the first of line between Wirksworth and Gorsey Bank reopened for a DMU shuttle passenger service in 2004, followed by a new line to Ravenstor in 2005.
On 8 March 2008, the railway began to branch its passenger operations further south by holding a grand opening ceremony for the line between Wirksworth and Idridgehay – of the line&#x27;s total length.

In 2003, WyvernRail agreed a 15-year lease-purchase deal with Network Rail. In May 2005, it completed the purchase early and bought almost the entire railway. The only portion still leased is an area of the station yard in Wirksworth, which has been retained by Network Rail as a Strategic Rail Site and is on a rolling three-year lease to WyvernRail.

In July 2005, WyvernRail adopted Duffield station under a scheme promoted by the Friends of the Derwent Valley Line. They undertook to provide care and maintenance of the station on behalf of Central Trains, who operated it at that time.

The line has now been brought up to passenger-carrying standards to allow trains to run through from Wirksworth to Duffield. At Duffield, passengers can change for main line rail services by crossing from the branch platform (platform 3) to one of the Network Rail platforms (either platforms 1 or 2). There are intermediate stations at Idridgehay and Shottle.

===Signalling and line operation===

The railway principally operates on a token system, with the Wirksworth to Duffield section currently holding one token in the form of an Annett&#x27;s key; the Wirksworth to Ravenstor incline holds a different Annett&#x27;s key. Due to a ruling gradient on the line, the Wirksworth to Duffield section is protected by a trap-point just north of Wirksworth Station. The Wirksworth-Duffield line can now also be split in two sections with the installation of a passing loop at Shottle. This currently only happens on special events and bank holidays, as it requires two signalmen, one at each end of the loop, to be stationed for the day as there is currently no signal box to control movements in and out of the loop centrally. The former Oddingly crossing box is currently being restored for use as a signal box at Shottle. Two-train operation should be able to happen more regularly once it is finished.

An unusual piece of track work was installed at Wirksworth on platform 3. The track was interlaced (overlapping) either to allow the platform to be used for passenger trains or to allow wagons to collect stone from the adjacent dock. The interlaced section of track was operated by a manual tight point, but still came under the control of the Wirksworth-Ravenstor train token. This feature has since been removed, however, as it was no longer required.

There were (and currently still are) very few physical signals on the line, apart from indications at cross-overs. One semaphore signal was located almost underneath Cemetery Lane Bridge, but this has recently been relocated to Shottle station as part of the signalling project for the passing loop. Another electronic signal was located at Duffield station to warn that it is the end of the line. It is believed that this signal was permanently lit for nearly forty years, before being swept away in the reconstruction of the platform ready for the reopening.

===Film and TV appearances===
The railway has seen various filming projects take place:
* The first filming venture came in the form of the Hellmann&#x27;s Mayonnaise &quot;Big Dollop&quot; TV advert. 
* In 2004, the railway was used again to film the National Geographic Channel&#x27;s &quot;Seconds from Disaster&quot; where their ex-Gatwick Express coaches were used to depict the Eschede train disaster from 1998.
* In 2006, a location just south of Wirksworth was used to film the ITV drama &quot;Mobile&quot;.
* In June 2007, Wirksworth was used as the fictional station of &#x27;Lightbourne&#x27; in the BBC television series &quot;Casualty&quot;. The storyline involved both the Gatwick Express stock that is located on site, as well as Class 03 no. 03158 hauling an approaching goods train.

==WyvernRail==
WyvernRail Limited was established in 1992 as a community-owned and locally managed venture to restore and operate the Duffield to Wirksworth line.

The initial plan was to lease the line from &quot;Railfreight Construction&quot; (the British Rail sector then responsible for the line) and operate a community railway service between Wirksworth and Derby using leased diesel units, probably Class 142 &quot;Pacers&quot;. The model used was termed &quot;Open Access&quot;, a method of operation used by some operators today (most notably Hull Trains and Grand Central). The Railways Act 1993 created the framework that would allow WyvernRail to start the process, but the industry structure the Act created also caused the whole process to slow down to a crawl.

The line&#x27;s saving grace was the designation of Wirksworth station yard as a &quot;Strategic Freight Site&quot;, which meant that the yard was protected for railway use, thus making closure of the line extremely difficult. The line had already had a &#x27;Near Death Experience&#x27; in 1990 when a track lifting train began to lift approximately of continuously welded track between Idridgehay and Shottle. Fortunately, the work was stopped by British Rail management as it was reported that there was the possibility of new stone traffic on the line. As a result, the line was mothballed and the strategic freight site designation meant that this status remains on the line to this day.

Changes to the structure of the industry following privatisation meant that, for several years during the mid-1990s, WyvernRail often experienced difficulty in maintaining a consistent relationship with the authorities responsible for the line. However, while progress was slow on the ground, WyvernRail remained active wherever possible. While the most significant achievement was the award of a Light Railway Order for the line in 1996, WyvernRail also investigated other projects. During this period, the company&#x27;s approach changed from Open Access to a straight lease or purchase of the line.
In 1997, the Derby and Wirksworth Railway Association was formed in response to growing interest in WyvernRail&#x27;s activities. The Association grew slowly over the next three years but, after renaming itself the Ecclesbourne Valley Railway Association in 2000, membership took off when access to the line was finally granted.

For WyvernRail, progress began at accelerate in the summer of 2000, when Railtrack management not only took an interest in the firm&#x27;s activities but provided a proactive and imaginative basis for negotiations, including granting the company&#x27;s volunteers access to the line. This approach led to the gradual restoration of the line, conversion to a plc and the successful share launch of WyvernRail plc in April 2002.

<doc id="1012230" wikidata="Q251265" url="?curid=1012230" title="Frikadelle">
<text>A frikadelle is a rounded, flat-bottomed, pan-fried meatball of ground meat, often likened to the German version of meatballs. The origin of the dish is unknown. The term is German but the dish is associated with German, Nordic and Polish cuisines. They are one of the most popular meals in Poland, where they are known as (literally &quot;ground cutlets&quot;).

There are various local variants of frikadelle throughout Scandinavia, as both a main course and a side dish. In Sweden, the word refers to meatballs that are boiled, not pan-fried.

==Etymology==
The origin of the word is uncertain. According to the &quot;,&quot; (pl. ) can be found end of the 17th century in German, and is related to the French , and Latin (&#x27;to roast&#x27;).

The name of the dish in German is famously variable, with at least 16 recorded regional variants including , , , , and &quot;/Grillette&quot; as well as the Austrian &quot;&quot;. It may be derived from , a dish of sliced veal, larded with pork fat. In the (1837) is defined as, &quot;In Belgium, a ball of ground, cooked meat&quot; and a separate word, , is defined as . And in &quot;Phillips&#x27;s New World of Words&quot; (1706) it is defined as &quot;Fricandoe, a sort of Scotch Collops made of thin slices of Veal, well larded and stuff&#x27;d.&quot; The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; defines &quot;fricandele&quot; (variation &quot;fricadelle&quot;) as a &quot;quasi-French form of fricandeau&quot;.

==Other variations==
=== Denmark ===
In Denmark, traditionally, they are made from ground veal, pork or beef (or a blend of two of these meats); chopped onions; eggs; milk (or water); bread crumbs (or oatmeal or flour); salt; and pepper; then formed into balls by using a tablespoon to get the right size and flattened somewhat. They are then pan-fried in pork fat or beef fat, or more commonly in modern times in butter, margarine or even vegetable oil. Another popular variation is replacing the meat with fish (mostly cod, but sometimes cod and salmon) as the main ingredient and often served with remoulade.

As a main dish, they are most often served with boiled white potatoes and gravy () accompanied by pickled beetroot or cooked red cabbage. Alternatively, they can be served with creamed, white cabbage.

Frikadeller are also eaten on ryebread (rugbrød) with red cabbage or pickle slices as a traditional Danish smørrebrød.

The combination of frikadeller and a cold potato salad is very popular at picnics or potlucks, due to the ease of transporting either component after cooking.

=== Indonesia ===
Frikadel are also known in Indonesian cuisine through Dutch cuisine (of the frikadel, which is historically similar to the frikadaller) influence and called &quot;perkedel&quot;, however the main ingredient is not meat, but mashed potato, sometimes slightly mixed with ground meat or corned beef. The mixture is then shaped into flat round patties and dipped in egg yolk before being deep fried. Other than mashed potato, &quot;cabe rawit&quot;, spring onion, shrimp, peeled corn, or mashed tofu fritters are also common as perkedel ingredients.

===South Africa===
Frikkedelle is also popular in most traditional South African cuisine like the Cape Malay and Boer, with both British and German influence from the early settlers. Frikadelle is not only panfried, but often baked in the oven to give it a cripsy outside with a tender and juicy inside. It is served with side dishes of a starch like rice, samp, &quot;pap&quot;, or mashed potatoes, accompanied by vegetables and or salad.

<text>Nanumanga or Nanumaga is a reef island and a district of the Oceanian island nation of Tuvalu. It has a surface area of about 3 km2 with a population of 491 (2017 census).

==History==
On 9 May 1824 a French government expedition under Captain Louis Isidore Duperrey of the ship &quot;La Coquille&quot; sighted Nanumaga.

The US Exploring Expedition visited in 1841.

Louis Becke, who later became a writer, became the resident trader for the Liverpool firm of John S. de Wolf and Co. on Nanumaga from about April 1880 until the trading-station was destroyed later that year in a cyclone. Becke later wrote &quot;The Rangers of the Tia Kau&quot;, that describes a shark attack at the Tia Kau reef between Nanumea and Nanumaga.

The population of Nanumaga from 1860 to 1900 is estimated to be between 300 and 335 people.

Nanumaga Post Office opened around 1925.

In 1986 it became a centre of debate when Pacific archaeologists discovered the submerged Caves of Nanumanga, and found what they argued was the remains of fire created by pre-historic inhabitants.

==Geography==
The Nanumaga landscape consists of the main village settlements of Tonga and Tokelau, the two main pits for swamp taro (&quot;Cyrtosperma merkusii&quot;), (known in Tuvalu as &quot;Pulaka&quot;), the mangrove forest surrounding the internal lagoons and the areas of general vegetation which includes coconuts, pandanus trees and other vegetation types.

The island has an oval outline, with the longer axis oriented north–south. A fringing reef surrounds the whole island, which makes local fishing and transport into and out of the island difficult.

There are two brackish-water lagoons, the largest, Vaiatoa, having four islands. Vaiatoa Lagoon is located in the north of the island while the smaller Ha’apai Lagoon is in the south. A causeway has been construct to the south of Vaiatoa Lagoon linking the village areas of Tonga and Matematefaga.

There are mangrove trees, native broadleaf forest and coconut palms. The two recorded mangrove species in Tuvalu are the common Togo (&quot;Rhizophora stylosa&quot;) and the red-flowered mangrove Sagale (&quot;Lumnitzera littorea&quot;). The mangrove forest of the northern Vaiatoa lagoon covers an area approximately 20 hectares.

Nanumaga has a Locally Managed Marine Area, which encompasses the entire island. No fishing is allowed on the reef on the western side of the island, except handlining. Spear fishing is also totally banned on the island. A sea mount located just off the northern tip of the island is an important key fishing ground, which has been declared a ‘no anchor zone’.

In March 2015 Nanumaga suffered damage to houses, crops and infrastructure as the result of storm surges caused by Cyclone Pam; 60-100 houses were flooded and the health facility suffered damage.

===Capes===
* Cape on the north: Te Kaupapa
* Cape on the south: Te Papa

===Villages===
At the 2012 census the population of the villages was:
* Tokelau with 245 people;
* Tonga, also spelled &quot;Toga&quot; with 236 people.

The junior school is Lotohoni Primary School.

==Transportation==
There are a few paths and unpaved roads. There are no airports, so everything goes in and out by boat. There is an unprotected 10m wide boat channel that cuts into the fringing reef. The boat landing is where passengers and cargo is landed from the inter-island ferry workboats.

==Politics==
Nanumanga is one of the eight constituencies in Tuvalu, and elects two Members of Parliament. Following the 2024 general election, Monise Lafai was returned to parliament and Hamoa Holona was elected to parliament.


== Climate crisis ==
In 2016 the Tuvalu National Council for Women worked with the Green Climate Fund to enable women from the islands of Nanumea and Nanumaga to be part of talks about climate crisis. One of their key issues was the additional burden of social care that women take on in the aftermath of natural disasters.

The activities of the Tuvalu Coastal Adaptation Project on Nanumanga are designed to reduce exposure to coastal erosion by providing a buffer during storms. 

==Notable residents==
Otinielu Tausi was the deputy prime minister in the government of Kamuta Latasi (December 1993 to December 1996); Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Natural Resources and also the Home Affairs and Rural Development in the 2nd government of Bikenibeu Paeniu (1996 to 1998). He served as the speaker of the Parliament of Tuvalu from 2003 until 2006, then again from March 2014 until 9 September 2019.

The Reverend Dr Kitiona Tausi trained in theology and was appointed as a priest of Tuvalu&#x27;s main church, Ekalesia Kelisiano Tuvalu, and acted as the General Secretary of the organisation. Tausi served as the chairman of the Tuvalu Broadcasting Corporation Board of Directors. He was elected to represent Nanumaga in the by-election held on 15 July 2022. He was appointed Deputy Prime Minister &amp; Minister for Fisheries and Trade in the Natano Ministry, until the 2024 general election.

Tuau Lapua Lapua is a Tuvaluan Olympic weightlifter. At the 2013 Pacific Mini Games, Tuau Lapua Lapua won Tuvalu&#x27;s first ever gold medal in major sporting competition in the men&#x27;s 62 kilogram snatch. He also won bronze in the clean and jerk, and obtained the silver medal overall for the combined event.

<text>John Robin Warren (11 June 1937 – 23 July 2024) was an Australian pathologist, Nobel laureate, and researcher who is credited with the 1979 re-discovery of the bacterium &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot;, together with Barry Marshall. The duo proved to the medical community that the bacterium &quot;Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)&quot; is the cause of most peptic ulcers.

==Early life and education==
Warren was born 11 June 1937 in North Adelaide. His father, Roger Warren, was a winemaker, and his mother, Helen Warren (née Verco), was a nurse. Warren received his M.B.B.S. degree from the University of Adelaide, having completed his high school education at St Peter&#x27;s College, Adelaide.

==Career==
Warren trained at the Royal Adelaide Hospital and became a Registrar in Clinical Pathology at the Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science (IMVS). There, he worked in laboratory haematology, which generated his interest in pathology.

In 1963, Warren was appointed Honorary Clinical Assistant in Pathology and Honorary Registrar in Haematology at Royal Adelaide Hospital. Subsequently, he lectured in pathology at Adelaide University and then became Clinical Pathology Registrar at the Royal Melbourne Hospital. In 1967, Warren was elected to the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia and became a senior pathologist at the Royal Perth Hospital, where he spent the majority of his career.

===Nobel Prize work===
At the University of Western Australia,Warren along with his colleague Barry J. Marshall, proved that the bacterium is the infectious cause of stomach ulcers. Warren helped develop a convenient diagnostic test (-urea breath-test) for detecting &quot;H. pylori&quot; in ulcer patients.

In 2005, Warren and Marshall were awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine.

An Australian documentary was made in 2006 about Warren and Marshall&#x27;s road to the Nobel Prize, called &quot;The Winner&#x27;s Guide to the Nobel Prize&quot;. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia in 2007.

Asteroid 254863 Robinwarren, discovered by Italian amateur astronomer Silvano Casulli in 2005, was named in his honour. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 22 April 2016 ().

==Personal life and death==
Warren married Winifred Theresa Warren (née Williams) in the early 1960s, and together they had five children. Winifred Warren became an accomplished psychiatrist. Following her death in 1997, Warren retired from medicine.

Warren died in Perth, Australia, on 23 July 2024, at the age of 87.

<text>The Wisconsin and Southern Railroad is a Class II regional railroad in Southern Wisconsin and Northeastern Illinois currently operated by Watco. It operates former Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (Milwaukee Road) and Chicago and North Western Railway (C&amp;NW) trackage, mostly acquired by the state of Wisconsin in the 1980s.

Within Wisconsin, WSOR connects with four western Class I railroads: BNSF Railway, Canadian National Railway, Canadian Pacific Railway, and Union Pacific Railroad. Through trackage rights over Metra, WSOR accesses Chicago to connect with the two eastern Class I railroads, CSX Transportation and Norfolk Southern Railway. WSOR also has access to harbor facilities in Prairie du Chien, and transload facilities are located in Milwaukee, Janesville, Madison, and Oshkosh.

For train operation purposes, the WSOR system is divided into two divisions, the Northern Division and the Southern Division. The Northern Division is essentially the original WSOR trackage from 1980, with a few new lines that have been added around the Milwaukee area since the 1990s. It includes the line northwest from Milwaukee to Horicon, where it splits into branches to Cambria and Oshkosh, as well as a line from Milwaukee north to Kiel. The Southern Division includes the lines acquired from the Wisconsin and Calumet Railroad in 1992, centered on Madison and Janesville, as well as several lines acquired in the 1990s in the Madison area. The two divisions are not physically connected with WSOR-owned trackage, but trackage rights over a short section of Canadian National&#x27;s Waukesha Subdivision from Waukesha to Slinger provide a link between the two divisions.

WSOR is headquartered in Madison, which is also a central hub terminal. The train dispatching office is located in Horicon. Locomotive maintenance is centered in Janesville, with secondary work also being performed at Horicon. WSOR&#x27;s Horicon paint shops perform contract work on both rolling stock and locomotives.

== History ==

WSOR began operations in 1980 when the state acquired several Milwaukee Road branch lines and signed a 50-year agreement with the Wisconsin and Southern Railroad, organized by the FSC Corporation, which also owned the Upper Merion and Plymouth Railroad. In August 1992, WSOR gained control of the Wisconsin and Calumet Railroad, which had been created in 1985 to replace the Chicago, Madison and Northern Railroad&#x27;s operations on state-owned lines formerly part of the Milwaukee Road and Illinois Central Gulf Railroad. The latter was abandoned in 1997 except for a short stub in Madison. The short stub was abandoned in 2012, when the Charter Street Heating Plant in Madison discontinued using coal as their fuel source. WSOR thus gained access to Chicago (through trackage rights over Metra from Fox Lake), Janesville, Madison, and Prairie du Chien. Further expansion came with a lease from the Union Pacific Railroad (UP) of Madison-area ex-C&amp;NW trackage in 1996, and of an ex-Milwaukee Road line between Madison and Watertown from the Soo Line Railroad in 1998 (sold outright in 2003). The most recent acquisition was north of Milwaukee in 2005, when the state purchased the ex-Milwaukee Road line between Saukville and Kiel, which Wisconsin Central Ltd. was going to abandon. Soon thereafter, WSOR leased in part and bought in part an ex-C&amp;NW line to Sheboygan from UP.

WSOR was named the 2009 Regional Railroad of the Year by &quot;Railway Age&quot; magazine.

On April 11, 2011, WSOR&#x27;s president and chief executive officer (CEO), William Gardner, was charged with two felonies after he was accused of funneling more than $60,000 in illegal campaign contributions through WSOR employees during the 2010 Wisconsin gubernatorial election. Gardner agreed to plead guilty to two felony counts. Under a deal, prosecutors agreed not to seek jail time but instead would seek two years of probation. In a statement, Gardner acknowledged his mistakes and said he took full responsibility. The vast majority of the contributions were to Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker.

On November 29, 2011, it was announced that WSOR would be acquired by Watco, with the deal to close on January 1, 2012.

In December 2012, the state of Wisconsin issued $17.1 million in financial aid to WSOR to rehabilitate of rail line between Plymouth and Kohler, which connects with existing WSOR tracks at Plymouth. Service has begun as of 2015.

WSOR operated a terminal railroad in Madison called the Madison Terminal Railway from 2010 to 2015 to service a transloading facility in Madison WI. This spur was less than a half mile long.

== Routes ==

=== North Division ===
* Milwaukee Subdivision (former MILW) – Main North Division line that runs from the paint shops in Horicon to the north side of Milwaukee. Commodities can range from grain and chemicals to lumber and ballast.
* Cambria Subdivision (former MILW) – Runs from Cambria to Horicon.
* Oshkosh Subdivision (former MILW) – Runs from Oshkosh to Horicon. Commodities are mostly grain and chemicals.
* Markesan Subdivision (former MILW) – Runs from Markesan to Brandon. Commodities are mostly grain.
* Plymouth Subdivision (former MILW) – Runs from a connection with the Canadian National Railway in Kiel to another connection in Saukville. The line through Kiel is out of service and used for car storage. Main commodities are transload products and chemicals.
* Sheboygan Falls Subdivision (former CNW) – Recently reopened in 2015. Runs from Plymouth to Sheboygan. Commodities are grain, aggregates, chemicals, and lumber.
* Mayville Spur (former MILW) – Runs from Mayville to Iron Ridge. Commodities are limestone and packaged products.
* Gibson Spur (former MILW) – Runs through North Milwaukee.
* Fox Lake Spur (former MILW) – Used for car storage for about a mile from Fox Lake.

=== South Division ===

* Madison Subdivision (former MILW) – A main line along with the Waukesha and Fox Lake Subdivisions, runs from Madison to Janesville where it connects with the Union Pacific Railroad and the Canadian Pacific Railway through the Iowa, Chicago and Eastern Railroad subsidiary.
* Prairie Subdivision (former MILW) – Runs from Prairie Du Chien to Madison. Main commodities are mostly grain and frac sand but also include lumber, chemicals, plastics, and fertilizer.
* Waukesha Subdivision (former MILW) – One of their main lines along with the Madison and Fox Lake Subdivision, most has been converted to welded rail. Connects with the Madison Subdivision in Milton and the Canadian National Railway in Waukesha. Commodities include anything from grain to chemicals to lumber.
* Monroe Subdivision (former MILW) – Runs from Monroe to Janesville. Main commodities are mostly grain, corn, and liquefied ethanol.
* Fox Lake Subdivision (former MILW) – A main line along with the Waukesha and Madison Subdivisions, connects Janesville with Fox Lake, Illinois. From Fox Lake to Chicago, the tracks are owned by Metra; the WSOR has trackage rights over this section. There is a very large variety of commodities on this subdivision. Through the trackage rights into Chicago, this subdivision allows WSOR to interchange with each of the North American Class I railroads. 
* Elkhorn Subdivision (former MILW) – Runs from Bardwell to Elkhorn. Main commodities are grain, lumber, cold storage products, and aggregates.
* Reedsburg Subdivision (former CNW) – Runs from Reedsburg to Brooklyn. Commodities range from ballast to lumber and scrap but also include plastics, sand, grain, and chemicals. Sections originally were built as the Beloit &amp; Madison Railroad and Baraboo Air Line Railroad.
* Cottage Grove Subdivision (former CNW) – Runs from Madison to Cottage Grove and serves an ethanol processing plant.
* Watertown Subdivision (former MILW) – Runs from Madison to Watertown where it interchanges with the Canadian Pacific Railway and Rail &amp; Transload. Main commodities are grain, plastics, scrap, ballast, chemicals, and lumber. CP has trackage rights from Watertown to a quarry east of Waterloo, where trains are often sent from Portage to load and unload ballast.
* Sauk Spur (former MILW) – Runs from Sauk CIty to a connection with the Prairie Subdivision in Mazomanie. Only part is used but only for car storage, the rest to Sauk City is heavily out of service.

<doc id="1012261" wikidata="Q1464898" url="?curid=1012261" title="Frikandel">
<text>A &#x27; (; plural &#x27;) is a traditional snack originating from the Netherlands, a sort of minced-meat sausage, 
of which the modern version was developed after World War II. The history of this snack in the Spanish Netherlands goes back to the 17th century.

== History ==
Unlike the modern frika(n)del, the historical frikandel (frickedil) is made from minced veal and generally spiced with mace, nutmeg, salt, pepper and optionally orange peel. A version without egg and breadcrumbs was cooked in a veal net.

The shape of the frikadel could have been phallic on purpose. The writer P.C. Hooft called &#x27;fricadellen&#x27; a recipe for old spinsters. Also, a special version of the frikadel was served to pregnant women, according to 18th-century cookery books. It was a veal meatball containing an egg yolk, hidden and sewn into a small leaf of lettuce.

There is some confusion around whether frikandel should be written with or without an &quot;n&quot;, but in essence, the frikandel and the frikadel are two different products. Until 2005 however, only the word &quot;frikadel&quot;, was seen as the official spelling. After 2005, also the word &quot;frikandel&quot; was accepted.

The difference between a &quot;frikandel&quot; and a &quot;frikadel&quot; is that the frikadel was invented in 1954 and the frikandel is a similar product invented in 1958 and has a different production method, yielding a smoother end-product. Currently, the frikadel is no longer in production.

== Description ==
The modern &quot;frikandel&quot; is a cylindrical chewy, skinless, dark-coloured sausage-like meat product which is usually eaten warm. Unlike most sausages, the &quot;frikandel&quot; is deep-fried. In Belgium and in the north of France (Nord-Pas-de-Calais), it is called a &quot;&quot;frikadel&quot;, &quot;fricandelle&quot; or &quot;fricadelle&quot;. In some parts of Flanders (Belgium), notably around Antwerp, it is called &quot;curryworst&quot;&quot; (not to be confused with the German &quot;currywurst&quot;, though in eastern Germany people tend to make &quot;currywurst&quot; from skinless sausage). In the U.S., a product inspired by the &quot;frikandel&quot; although not identical is marketed under the &quot;Dutch Dawg&quot; and &quot;Freakandel&quot; brands. Due to the absence of a skin, one could argue that technically it is not a sausage.

In Belgium, &quot;frikadel&quot; means (also raw) minced pork; it seldom contains other meat. Where the sausage is called &quot;&quot;curryworst&quot;, the term &quot;frikadel&quot; is often used to describe a sort of meatball (the precursor of the frikandel, with the same meat), commonly eaten in Belgium, Germany and Denmark.

Who created the modern &quot;frikandel&quot; is contested. Some claimed it was first made by Gerrit de Vries in Dordrecht in 1954 when a law prevented him from selling his product as a meatball. He changed the name and shape instead of the recipe. Others say it was created by Jan Bekkers in Deurne in 1958, and named by him &quot;frikandel&quot;&quot; after he founded the Beckers factory the following year.
However, the present recipe with very fine mince is derived from Bekker&#x27;s 1958 version. The De Vries 1954 sausage, named &quot;fricadelle&quot;, contained chunkier minced meat and essentially was a minced meat patty shaped like a sausage.

In the Netherlands, northern France, Belgium, Aruba and Curaçao, the &quot;frikandel&quot; consists of a mixture of mechanically separated meat, including chicken (40% or more) and pork (about 25%). In the US, it contains pork (50%), beef (35%) and non-mechanically separated chicken (15%). Some manufacturers also add in a bit of horse meat. A halal version exists and contains only chicken and beef. Other ingredients are bread crumbs, thickener, herbs and spices, onion and flavour enhancers.

==Popularity==
It is the most popular fast food snack in the Netherlands, followed by &quot;kroket&quot;. According to the AKSV (the &quot;General Association of Manufacturers of Cooking Supplies and Snacks&quot; in the Netherlands), 600 million frikandellen are produced each year in the Netherlands. Most of these are also sold in the Netherlands, where more than 37 frikandellen are consumed per capita per year.

==Serving==
In the Netherlands, it is most often served with curry ketchup or mayonnaise, though some eat it with tomato ketchup, mustard or apple sauce. Very popular is a served together with mayonnaise, curry or ketchup and chopped raw onion: a . The usually has a deep cut lengthwise through the middle to provide room for the chopped onions and the sauces. Some people prefer the taste of a if the cut is made before frying, resulting in a larger crisp surface. Sometimes the sausage is served on a bun and is then called a .

In Belgium and in the north of France, it is served with any sauce of choice and sold in a variety of ways, for example with onions, in a long bun, a piece of baguette, as a kebab or plain and untouched.

== Variants ==
&quot;Frikandellen&quot; can also be included in party-packs together with other Dutch snacks such as &quot;bitterballen&quot;, although they are significantly reduced in length. They are also often available in holiday resorts abroad which are popular with the Dutch, such as Lloret de Mar, Spain.

In the Netherlands, &quot;frikandel&quot;-eating contests are regularly held all over the country. The record for most &quot;frikandellen&quot; consumed in one hour was set in 2005 by Sjonnie Noordeinde of Delft, consuming 47 sausages of 80 grams each.

The Belgian company Vanreusel created a number of variants of the &quot;frikandel&quot; such as the &quot;Frikandel XXL&quot; (a larger variant of the &quot;frikandel&quot;) in 2010 and the &quot;loempidel&quot; (a &quot;frikandel&quot; wrapped in a &quot;lumpia&quot; coat) in 2019.

In many other countries, including South Africa, Denmark and Germany, &quot;frikadel&quot; or &quot;Frikadelle&quot; (not to be confused with frikandel) is the local name of minced-meat meatballs or patties like those used in hamburgers. The Indonesian &quot;perkedel&quot; shares the same name and origin, but the primary ingredient is mashed potato.

<text>The British Rail Class 489 (GLV) electric multiple units were specially converted for use on Gatwick Express trains, from London Victoria to Gatwick Airport.

The units were converted from Class 414 driving motors cars, by Eastleigh Works in 1983-84, for use on the new Gatwick Express service. They were used to allow push-pull operations, on the London-end of the rakes of Class 488 stock, with a Class 73 locomotive at the other end and both used for propulsion. The units were used as baggage cars.

Units were given unit numbers in the range 489101-489110, with individual carriages numbered 68500-68509. However, purely for aesthetic purposes, only the last four digits of the set numbers were shown, to fit with the traditional Southern style (maintained until privatisation by British Rail&#x27;s Southern region) - older (pre-TOPS) units were originally assigned four-digit numbers. The units were originally painted in BR Blue/Grey livery, which was quickly replaced by InterCity livery. The final livery carried by these units is a variation of the InterCity livery, with a claret stripe and &quot;Gatwick Express&quot; lettering.

==Operations==
Upon privatisation of British Rail, the Gatwick Express franchise was won by National Express.

===Gatwick Express===
Immediately after privatisation, the Class 489 fleet was exclusively used by Gatwick Express on all their London Victoria-Gatwick Airport shuttles. However, new units, in the form of Class 460 &#x27;Juniper&#x27; units were built from 2000, with the aim of completely replacing the old stock. By 2002, sufficient new trains were in service to allow six Class 489 units to be removed from traffic, leaving four units retained as cover in case of failure of one of the new trains. Two of these subsequently withdrawn so that by the end of 2004, only two units (nos. 489104/110) were still in use, as reliability of the &#x27;Juniper&#x27; units had not improved sufficiently to totally replace all the old trains. They were finally withdrawn in 2005, following improvements to the &quot;Juniper&quot; fleet reliability.

===Other operators===
Since finishing with Gatwick Express, several units have been sold to other operators.

====Network Rail====
Network Rail have purchased four units, 489102, 489105, 489106 and 489109. They were stored for several years, but were returned to use in early-2006 as deicing and load-bank vehicles.

==Preservation==
Four units have been preserved on heritage railways. Two of the units were donated by Porterbrook Leasing in 2003 to the Ecclesbourne Valley Railway in Derbyshire, which now uses one as a buffet car and the other a museum. The final two units in use with Gatwick Express were preserved in early 2006.
*489101 (68500) - Ecclesbourne Valley Railway
*489104 (68503) - Spa Valley Railway
*489107 (68506) - Ecclesbourne Valley Railway
*489110 (68509) - Barry Tourist Railway
Another unit, 489108, was bought by a private owner for preservation at Nottingham Transport Heritage Centre, but it was sent for scrap in May 2009.

==Fleet status==
The final Gatwick Express units were withdrawn in 2005. Both of these units (nos. 489104/110) had been withdrawn in 2000 and 2001 respectively, but were overhauled and returned to use in 2002. They replaced units 489103/108, which were withdrawn from traffic as they were due overhaul.

Network Rail returned its two units to service in 2006, following a period in store.

The current status of the fleet is shown below.

<text>Aliyah Bet (, &quot;Aliyah &#x27;B&#x27;&quot; – bet being the second letter of the Hebrew alphabet) was the code name given to illegal immigration by Jews, many of whom were refugees escaping from Nazi Germany or other Nazi-controlled countries, and later Holocaust survivors, to Mandatory Palestine between 1920 and 1948, in violation of the restrictions laid out in the British White Paper of 1939, which dramatically increased between 1939 and 1948. With the establishment of the State of Israel in May 1948, Jewish displaced persons and refugees from Europe began streaming into the new state in the midst of the 1948 Palestine war.

In modern-day Israel, it has also been called by the Hebrew term Ha&#x27;apala (, &quot;Ascension&quot;). Those who underwent Ha&#x27;apala are known as &quot;Ma&#x27;apilim.&quot; The &quot;Aliyah Bet&quot; is distinguished from the &quot;Aliyah Aleph&quot; (&quot;Aliyah &#x27;A&#x27;&quot;, Aleph being the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet) which refers to the limited Jewish immigration permitted by British authorities during the same period. The name &quot;Aliya B&quot; is also shortened for &quot;Aliya Bilti Legalit&quot; ().

==Organization==


During &quot;Ha&#x27;apala&quot;, several emissaries from the Yishuv, Jewish partisans, the Jewish Brigade of the British Army, Zionist youth movements and organizations worked together to facilitate the immigration of Jews escaping from Nazi Germany to Mandatory Palestine beyond the established &quot;White Paper&quot; quotas. As the persecution of Jews dramatically intensified in German-occupied Europe during the Nazi era, the urgency driving the immigration also became more acute.

&quot;Ha&#x27;apala&quot; occurred in two phases. The first one, from 1934 to 1942, was an effort to enable European Jews to escape Nazi persecution and genocide. The second one, from 1945 to 1948, in a stage known as &quot;Bricha&quot; (&quot;flight&quot; or &quot;escape&quot;), was an effort to find homes for Jewish survivors of the Nazi crimes (&quot;Sh&#x27;erit ha-Pletah&quot;, &quot;Surviving Remnant&quot;) who were among the millions of displaced persons (&quot;DPs&quot;) languishing in refugee camps scattered across post-war Europe, primarily located in Allied-occupied Germany and Austria, and Italy.&quot;

During the first phase, several Zionist organizations (including Revisionists) led the effort; after World War II, the Mossad LeAliyah Bet (&quot;the Institute for Aliyah B&quot;), an arm of the Haganah, took charge. The Palyam, a maritime branch of the Palmach, was given responsibility for commanding and sailing ships from Europe to Mandatory Palestine.

==Routes==
Post-World War II, &quot;Ha&#x27;apala&quot; journeys typically started in the DP camps and moved through one of two collection points in the American occupation sector, Bad Reichenhall and Leipheim. From there, the refugees travelled in disguised trucks, on foot, or by train to ports on the Mediterranean Sea, where ships brought them to Palestine. Most of the ships had names such as &quot;Lo Tafchidunu&quot; (&quot;You can&#x27;t frighten us&quot;) and &quot;La-Nitzahon&quot; (&quot;To the victory&quot;) designed to inspire and rally the Jews of Palestine. Some were named after prominent figures in the Zionist movement, and people who had been killed while supporting Aliyah Bet. More than 70,000 Jews arrived in Palestine on more than 100 ships.
American sector camps imposed no restrictions on the movements out of the camps, and American, French, and Italian officials often turned a blind eye to the movements. Several UNRRA officials (in particular Elizabeth Robertson in Leipheim) acted as facilitators of the emigration. The British government vehemently opposed the movement, and restricted movement in and out of their camps. The British set up naval patrols to prevent immigrants from landing in Palestine.

==History==
Over 100,000 people attempted to illegally enter Mandatory Palestine. There were 142 voyages by 120 ships. Over half were stopped by the British patrols. The Royal Navy had eight ships on station in Palestine, and additional ships were tasked with tracking suspicious vessels heading for Palestine. Most of the intercepted immigrants were sent to internment camps in Cyprus: (Karaolos near Famagusta, Nicosia, Dhekelia, and Xylotymbou. Some were sent to the Atlit detention camp in Palestine, and some to Mauritius. The British held as many as 50,000 people in these camps (see Jews in British camps on Cyprus). Over 1,600 drowned at sea. Only a few thousand actually entered Palestine.

The pivotal event in &quot;Ha&#x27;apala&quot; program was the incident in 1947. &quot;Exodus&quot; was intercepted and boarded by a Royal Navy patrol. Despite significant resistance, passengers from &quot;Exodus&quot; were forcibly returned to Europe, and eventually put in camps in Germany. This was publicized, to the great embarrassment of the British government.

One account of Aliyah Bet is given by journalist I. F. Stone in his 1946 book &quot;Underground to Palestine,&quot; a first-person account of traveling from Europe with displaced persons attempting to reach the Jewish homeland.

More than 300 volunteers, most of them American World War II veterans, including Murray Greenfield (of the ship &quot;Hatikva&quot;), volunteered to sail ten ships (&quot;The Jews&#x27; Secret Fleet&quot;) from the United States to Europe to load 35,000 survivors of the Holocaust (half of the illegal immigrants to Palestine), only to be deported to detention camps on Cyprus.
==Timeline==
===Before World War II===
* In 1934, the first attempt to bring in a large number of illegal immigrants by sea happened when some 350 Jews sailed on the &quot;Vallos&quot;, a chartered ship, without the permission of the Jewish Agency, who feared illegal immigration would cause the British to restrict legal immigration. She arrived off the coast of Palestine on 25 August, and the passengers disembarked with the help of the Haganah, which received special permission to assist them.
* On 29 July 1939, the &quot; Colorado&quot;, flying under the Panamanian flag and carrying 378 Jewish refugees from Europe was intercepted by the British; the illegal immigrants were arrested and taken into Haifa.
* On 19 August, the &quot;Aghios Nicolaus&quot;, a Greek owned ship, transferred 840 immigrants to smaller vessels off the coast and sent them to shore.
* On 23 August, the &quot;Parita&quot;, carrying some 700 refugees on board, was deliberately beached at Tel Aviv by the passengers, the captain and crew having fled in a small boat.

===During World War II===

* On 2 September, the &quot;Tiger Hill&quot;, a 1,499-ton ship built in 1887, was intercepted and fired on by Royal Navy gunboats off Tel Aviv, killing two passengers (Dr Robert Schneider and Zvi Binder); the ship HMCS &quot;Belleville&quot; beached on the shore with 1,205 immigrants on board; the &quot;Tiger Hill&quot; had sailed from Constanţa, Romania, on 3 August 1939, with about 750 immigrants on board and had taken on board the passengers from the &quot;Frossoula&quot;, another illegal immigrant ship that was marooned in Lebanon. 
* On 16 September, the &quot;Rudnitchan&quot; transferred 364 Jewish refugees into five lifeboats outside the territorial waters of the Mandate and sent them ashore as illegal immigrants.
* On 19 September, the &quot; Noemi Julia&quot;, sailing from Sulina in Romania with 1,130 Jewish refugees from Europe on board was intercepted in the Mediterranean by a British warship and forced to Haifa port; fearing that they would be sent back, the illegal immigrants engaged in passive resistance; the British authorities brought them ashore and held them in a detention camp; they were released a month later.
* On 24–25 November 1939, a large group of immigrants traveled by train from Vienna to Bratislava and about 2 weeks later sailed from there on the riverboat &quot;Uranus&quot; down the Danube. At the Romanian border, the three smaller riverboats to which they had been transferred on December 14 on entering Yugoslavia were intercepted and the immigrants were forced to disembark at the old fortress town of Kladovo. About 1,100 refugees were stranded there and came to be known as the Kladovo-Sabac Group. In May 1941, they were still in Yugoslavia, where 915 of them were caught and eventually killed by the invading Nazis. The 800 men were shot by Nazi soldiers in a farmer&#x27;s field at Zasavica; after the war, the remains of the men were re-interred in a mass grave in the Belgrade Sephardi Cemetery. The women and children were imprisoned in the Sajmiste concentration camp where they perished from hunger, disease, exposure to the bitter cold winter weather, or gassed to death in a mobile gas truck.
* On 18 May 1940 the old Italian paddle steamer &quot;Pencho&quot; sailed from Bratislava, with 514 passengers, mostly Betar members. The &quot;Pencho&quot; sailed down the Danube to the Black Sea and into the Aegean Sea. On 9 October, her engines failed and she was wrecked off Mytilene, in the Italian-ruled Dodecanese Islands. The Italians rescued the passengers and took them to Rhodes. All but two were then placed in an internment camp at Ferramonti di Tarsia in southern Italy. They were held there until Allied forces liberated the area in September 1943. 
* In October 1940, 1,770 Jewish refugees sailed from Tulcea to Haifa in two ships. The arrived off Haifa on 1 November, followed a few days later by the . The Royal Navy intercepted each ship and escorted it into Haifa, where British authorities detained the refugees before transferring them to a requisitioned French ocean liner, the , for deportation to Mauritius. They were followed from Tulcea by another 1,634 refugees aboard the , which arrived on 24 November off Haifa, where the Royal Navy escorted her into harbour. On November 25 the British had just started transferring &quot;Atlantic&quot;″s refugees to &quot;Patria&quot; when Haganah agents planted a bomb aboard the French liner with the intention of disabling her to prevent her from sailing. However, the bomb quickly sank &quot;Patria&quot;, killing 260 people and wounding 172. The survivors were allowed to stay in Palestine on humanitarian grounds.
* In October 1940, a large group of refugees were allowed to leave Vienna. The exodus was organized by Berthold Storfer, a Jewish businessman who worked under Adolf Eichmann. They took four river boats, &quot;Uranus&quot;, &quot;Schönbrunn&quot;, &quot;Helios&quot;, and &quot;Melk&quot;, down the Danube to Romania, where the &quot;Uranus&quot; passengers, about 1,000, boarded the &quot;Pacific&quot;, and sailed on 11 October 1940. They arrived at Haifa on 1 November, followed by the &quot;Milos&quot;. The British transferred all the immigrants to the French liner to take them for internment to Mauritius. To stop the &quot;Patria&quot; from sailing, the Haganah smuggled a bomb aboard. The explosion holed her side, capsizing her and killing 267 people. The British, by order of Winston Churchill, allowed the survivors to remain in Palestine.
* In December 1940 the &quot;Salvador&quot;, a small Bulgarian schooner formerly named &quot;Tsar Krum&quot;, left Burgas with 327 refugees. On December 12 the &quot;Salvador&quot; was wrecked in a violent storm in the Sea of Marmara, near Istanbul. 223 persons, including 66 children, lost their lives. The survivors were taken to Istanbul. 125 survivors were deported back to Bulgaria, and the remaining 70 left on the &quot;Darien&quot; (No. 66).
* On 11 December 1941, the sailed from Constanţa carrying between 760 and 790 refugees. Three days later she reached Istanbul, where Turkey detained her and her passengers for 10 weeks. On 23 February 1942, Turkish authorities towed her back into the Black Sea and cast her adrift. Early the next day the torpedoed and sank her. Between 767 and 791 people were killed, and there was only one survivor.
* On 20 September 1942, the &quot;Europa&quot; sailed from Romania with 21 passengers. She was wrecked in the Bosphorus.
* On 21 April 1944, the &quot;Belasitza&quot; sailed from Romania with 273 passengers including 120 children, who went from Istanbul to Palestine by sealed train.
* On 5 August 1944, &quot;Bulbul&quot;, and &quot;Morino&quot; sailed from Constanţa carrying about 1,000 refugees between them. In the night the Soviet submarine sank &quot;Mefküre&quot; by torpedo and shellfire, and then machine-gunned survivors in the water. Between 289 and 394 refugees plus seven crew were aboard &quot;Mefküre&quot;; only the crew and five refugees survived. &quot;Bulbul&quot; rescued the few survivors and took them to Turkey.

===After VE Day ===
* On 28 August 1945 the Italian fishing vessel &quot;Dalin&quot;, made in Monopoli, carrying 35 immigrants, landed at Caesarea Maritima, disembarked its passengers, and returned to Italy.
* On 4 September 1945, the &quot;Natan&quot;, carrying 79 immigrants, landed in Palestine, carrying seamen and radio operators from the Palmach and Jewish Agency emissaries on the return trip to Italy. On October 1, 1945, the &quot;Natan&quot; again ran the blockade arrived at Shefayim with 73 immigrants.
* On 9 September 1945, the &quot;Gabriela&quot;, carrying 40 passengers, arrived undetected in Palestine.
* On 17 September 1945, the &quot;Peter&quot;, carrying 168 immigrants, landed in Palestine undetected by the British. She again slipped into Palestine undetected and arrived at Shefayim on 22 October, this time carrying 174 passengers.

==Conclusion==
The success of &quot;Aliyah Bet&quot; was modest when measured in terms of the numbers who succeeded in entering Palestine. However, it proved to be a unifying force both for the Jewish community in Palestine (the Yishuv) and for the Holocaust-survivor refugees in Europe (Sh&#x27;erit ha-Pletah).

The immigrants who drowned in the sea and whose bodies were found were buried in the National Cemetery in Mount Herzl in Jerusalem.

<text>Ruth Klüger Aliav (née Polishuk) (April 27, 1910 – February 16, 1980) was a Ukrainian-born Romanian and Israeli Jewish Zionist activist, assisting in the Aliya Beth before and after World War II.

==Childhood and studies==
Born in Kiev, Ukraine (then in the Russian Empire until 1918, lived in her youth in Cernăuţi (Czernowitz), Bucovina, then part of the Kingdom of Romania, and nowadays in Ukraine), she was a graduate from the University of Vienna who could speak nine languages.

==Early activities==
Ruth Klüger went to Palestine after her marriage in 1936 and later joined Aliya Beth, being sent on missions to Romania and other European countries. She was one of ten original members of the Mossad, a Zionist group dedicated to helping Jews escape the Holocaust in Europe. Fluent in nine languages, she raised funds and helped organize the ships the &quot;Tiger Hill&quot; (September 1939) and the &quot;Hilda&quot; (January 1940) to carry Jewish refugees to Palestine. After Romania became an Axis Power, she escaped to Istanbul, Turkey and there together with other Mossad agents organized the dispatch of the ship the &quot;Darien II&quot; in March 1941. A full account of these deeds is in her autobiography &quot;The Last Escape,&quot; which was a best seller in 1974, and filmed as &quot;The Darien Dilemma&quot; (2005).

She was a Mossad agent in Cairo from 1941 to 1944. In 1944, with Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s help, she arrived in a liberated Paris and was the first Mossad agent to contact survivors of the Holocaust.

==1945==
In October 1945, Klüger acquired a troopship, the &quot;Ascanious&quot;, from an American, Colonel Ernest Witte, of Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s staff. It was planned that the vessel would convey orphans to Palestine and it was soon crammed with 2,600 Holocaust survivors. On arrival in Haifa, the British government of Palestine had no choice but to let them in. The colonel wanted to repeat the passage, but it was vetoed by Eisenhower because of British pressure.

In October 1945, David Ben-Gurion arrived in Paris and, to avoid eavesdroppers, he and Klüger-Aliav went for a four-hour walk in the Bois de Boulogne. Ben-Gurion wanted to know if the Holocaust survivors would be ready to sail in the cramped Aliya Beth &quot;nutshell&quot; ships. Klüger-Aliav convinced him that after the Holocaust, the refugees would endure any hardship in order to reach the new homeland.

==Later career==
Paris then became the headquarters of Aliya Beth; soon afterwards Klüger-Aliav left for South America and the United States, raising money and buying ships. After Israeli independence in 1948, she was public relations manager at ZIM, the Israeli shipping company.

Klüger-Aliav divorced in 1940. Ben-Gurion suggested to Ruth a new Hebrew surname: Aliav (&quot;V&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are the same Hebrew letter).

<doc id="1012283" wikidata="Q1642290" url="?curid=1012283" title="Battle of Fleurus (1622)">
<text>The Battle of Fleurus of August 29, 1622 was fought in the Spanish Netherlands between a Spanish army and the Protestant forces of Ernst von Mansfeld and Christian of Brunswick during the Eighty Years&#x27; War and the Thirty Years&#x27; War. The bloody struggle left the Protestants mangled and the Spanish masters of the field. The Spanish victory would ensure Catholic dominance in Germany till the intervention of Denmark–Norway.

==Campaign==
After failing to relieve Heidelberg, besieged by Tilly&#x27;s army, Frederick V, Elector Palatine, decided to disband his army. On July 13, 1622 the contract was cancelled and the unemployed army of Mansfeld and Christian of Brunswick was hired by the Dutch to help in the relief of the siege of Bergen-op-Zoom. The Protestant army departed from Alsace and at a fast pace crossed Northern France, entering the Spanish Low Countries through Hainaut.

The Spanish Army of Flanders, under command of Ambrogio Spinola, engaged in the siege of Bergen-op-Zoom, a town on the estuary of the Schelde River, was in a dangerous position; while a relieving Dutch army was being assembled to the East at Breda he faced an invasion from the South. He was in danger of being trapped between the two enemy armies, his line of retreat towards Antwerp blocked by the invading German army. To stop that army Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba, commander of the Spanish army in the Palatinate, was recalled in a hurry from the siege of Heidelberg. Cordoba marched through the Duchy of Luxembourg and the difficult terrain of the Ardennes, and was able to intercept Mansfeld and Brunswick on the border of Brabant. The Protestant army advance guard met Spanish cavalry scouts on 27 August, and two days later they found Córdoba&#x27;s army entrenched. Córdoba, much weaker in cavalry, had assumed a blocking position north of the town of Mellet, near Fleurus, with flanks supported by woods. The Protestant commanders deployed their army to try to break through the Spanish position.

==Armies==

SPANISH ARMY

Right Wing
Commander: Gauchier
800 commanded musketeers (in the woods)
5 Cavalry Squadrons in two lines

Center
Commander: Córdoba
Several units brigaded into 4 Escuadrones deployed in a single line
&quot;1st Escuadron&quot;
 Tercio of Naples (16 companies, Spaniards)
 Tercio Balanzon (2 companies, Burgundians)
 Tercio Verdugo (15 companies, Walloons)
&quot;2nd Escuadron&quot;
 Isenburg Regiment (10 companies, Lower Rhine Germans)
 Emden Regiment (1 company, Northern Germans)
 4 Free Companies (French)
&quot;3rd Escuadron&quot;
 Tercio of Capua (14 companies, Italians)
&quot;4th Escuadron&quot;
 Fugger Regiment (7 companies, Germans)

Left Wing
Commander: De Sylva
4 Cavalry Squadrons in two lines

The Spanish cavalry was composed of 53 small companies, assembled into ad hoc squadrons. There were 29 cuirassier companies and 24 arquebusier companies. 4 of the cuirassier companies were composed of veterans, while the rest had been raised, using Walloon recruits, in 1621 and 1622. These latter had performed poorly at the Battle of Wimpfen, so Cordoba was obviously concerned about the flanks of his army.

The Spanish infantry was of mixed quality. It included the elite Tercio of Naples, which traced its history back to 1567, and had recently lived up to its reputation with a superb performance at the Battle of Wimpfen. Córdoba placed it in the post of honour to the right, blocking the road. The Fugger Regiment and Verdugo Tercio were also experienced units, veterans of the Bohemian campaign, while the rest of the units were garrison troops of lesser quality mobilized by Córdoba to fill his command.
PROTESTANT ARMY

Right Wing
Commander: Streiff
10 Companies of Cavalry deployed in two lines

Center
Commander: Mansfeld
26 understrength Infantry regiments brigaded into 8 composite Battalions deployed in a checkerboard double line

Left Wing
Commander: Brunswick
50 Companies of Cavalry deployed in two lines

The Protestant army had left Sedan with 25,000 men, but the swift march had reduced it to 14,000, many stragglers being killed by angry Walloon peasants.

Protestant cavalry was highly motivated and of good quality. Many of the recruits were members of the German lesser nobility, and most were heavily armoured cuirassiers. The infantry was of much lesser material, poorly equipped, and had suffered the most in the march.

==Battle==

After a short cannonade, Mansfeld ordered a general advance. Some gaps opened up in the poorly drilled German infantry, and De Sylva attacked an exposed flank, routing one Battalion. However, Streiff counterattacked, the Walloon cavalry was wrong footed and suffered considerable damage from enemy pistol fire. De Sylva&#x27;s cavalry took refuge behind the baggage wagons, while Streiff turned on the Spanish infantry, but without much success.

On the Protestant left, Brunswick had massed most of his cavalry, Córdoba&#x27;s deployment made it impossible to outflank his position, but Brunswick hoped to overwhelm the Spanish by a massed frontal assault. The first charge was repulsed by Gauchier&#x27;s cavalry, but Brunswick reordered his command and launched a second charge, the first line was repulsed again but the second line succeeded in pushing back the Walloon Horse.

Brunswick turned then against the Spanish infantry, but his own infantry failed to adequately support the attack, the Tercio of Naples held its ground, and murderous enfilade fire from musketeers ambushed in the nearby woods sent the Protestant cavalry reeling back in disorder.

In a final charge, Brunswick was wounded, and his cavalry, demoralised, finally fell back. After five hours of fighting, Mansfeld ordered a general retreat, it was midday and he intended to take the road through Liège around Córdoba to reach Breda.

The Spanish army was too tired to follow the enemy. The next day, Córdoba sent Gauchier with the cavalry, although it caught up with the rear guard of the Protestant army, it managed to continue its march, defeat a small local army trying to block it, and rally at Tongeren. From there it started a six-hour night march to Breda, reaching it exhausted and without much of its equipment. Within days however the Dutch had re-equipped the circa 10,000 left in Mansfeld&#x27;s army from state arsenals.

==Aftermath==

As the Spanish army had failed to block Brunswick and Mansfeld, Spinola was compelled to lift the siege of Bergen-op-Zoom, but the outcome of Fleurus meant he was not in risk of being enveloped anymore, allowing him to retreat safely with his baggage train. Brunswick and Mansfeld only served for three months in Dutch pay, their unruly bands having no place in the disciplined Dutch army. Meanwhile, Tilly&#x27;s army easily overran the Palatinate.

<text>Wickham Bishops is a village and civil parish in the Maldon district of Essex, England. It is located around three miles north of the town of Maldon and around two miles south-east of Witham, in whose post town it lies.

The place name &quot;Wickham Bishops&quot; is first attested in the Domesday Book of 1086, where it appears as &quot;Wicham&quot;, meaning &#x27;dwelling place with a (dairy) farm&#x27;. &quot;Bishops&quot; refers to the fact that the land belonged to the Bishop of London. Other references note the historic name of &quot;Wycham Episcopi&quot;.

==Governance==
Wickham Bishops is part of the electoral ward called Wickham Bishops and Woodham. The population of this ward at the 2011 census was 3,700.

== Churches ==
The Church of England parish church is St Bartholomew&#x27;s. The church was built on the western side of the hill on which the village stands. The clock on its steeple was converted to an electronic mechanism in June 2008 (previously being wound by hand). St Bartholomew&#x27;s is a Victorian replacement for the medieval St Peter&#x27;s Church, which stands alone in the fields to the west near the River Blackwater, and beyond the disused railway line to Maldon.

The redundant Church of St Peter was probably built as a private chapel for the bishops of London who then owned the village. Since 1975 it has belonged to the Friends of Friendless Churches.

<text>Melvin Lacy Renfro (born December 30, 1941) is an American former professional football player who spent his entire 14-year career as a cornerback for the Dallas Cowboys of the National Football League (NFL). He is a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Born in Houston, Texas, Renfro moved with his family to Portland, Oregon, and he attended its Jefferson High School, starring as a two-way football player and track and field athlete. As a sophomore and junior, he contributed to his team achieving a 23–0 record, including consecutive Class A-1 football state championships in 1957 and 1958. The Democrats&#x27; 1958 team is regarded as one of the greatest in Oregon prep history, which had a backfield that included him at halfback, quarterback Terry Baker (1962 Heisman Trophy winner at Oregon State), halfback Mickey Hergert (one of the leading ground gainers in the nation at Lewis &amp; Clark College) and his brother Raye Renfro at fullback (in 1958 he broke a Portland Interscholastic League record with 24 touchdowns). After Baker graduated, Renfro saw playing time at quarterback as a senior in 1959 and was also an all-state selection at running back, as Jefferson pursued a third consecutive title. They again advanced to the championship game, played before more than 21,000 at Multnomah Stadium in Portland, but lost 7–6 to Medford.

In track as a junior in 1959, he helped Jefferson win the team title by winning the 180-yard low hurdles, the 120-yard high hurdles (breaking the state record) and the broad jump state titles. In 1960, he broke two Oregon junior AAU championship records with a 120-yard high hurdles of 13.9 seconds and 19.3 seconds in the 180-yard low hurdles. Renfro also collected 32 points outscoring every team except one, recording the state record with a 24.1 broad jump and winning the low hurdles, high hurdles and the half-mile relay team. He was named outstanding athlete in the Golden West Invitational track meet, which brought annually the nation&#x27;s top high school seniors. He was &quot;Track and Field News&quot; &quot;High School Athlete of the Year&quot; in 1960.

In 1983, he was inducted into the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame.

==College career==
In 1960, Renfro enrolled at the University of Oregon in Eugene, where he excelled for the track team and as a two-way football player, an All-American halfback and defensive back. In football, he earned All-Coast recognition three times and is one of only two two-time All-Americans (Steve Barnett is the other player) in university history. He is also the second two-sport All-American in university history, the first one was George Shaw in football and baseball.

In 1992, Renfro was inducted into the University of Oregon Athletic Hall of Fame.

===Football===
From the start of his sophomore season, Renfro received recognition as one of the best and most complete running backs in college football, being able to run inside or outside, catch, block and play special teams. In 1963, he was even named the team&#x27;s backup quarterback.

One of Renfro&#x27;s best collegiate games took place against Rice at Houston in 1962. Renfro shone on both offense and defense, leading the Ducks to a 31–12 victory on October 13. Rice Stadium had been a whites-only facility prior to the Ducks&#x27; visit, but university officials allowed Renfro&#x27;s family to enter and sit in a special section of the stadium near the 35-yard line. According to a contemporary account in the &quot;Register-Guard&quot;, when Renfro left the game, he was given a loud and appreciative ovation by the Rice crowd.

An Oregon sportswriter asked a Houston counterpart in the press box if an African-American had ever received such an ovation by a predominantly white crowd. The Texan enthusiastically replied, &quot;We&#x27;ve never seen any player that good!&quot; The morning after the game, a Houston paper headlined, &quot;Renfro Runs Rice Ragged.&quot;

Renfro led Oregon in rushing three straight seasons (1961–63), finishing with a career total 1,540 yards and 23 touchdowns. He still holds the university&#x27;s career record for highest average per play at 6.01 yards. Renfro also had 41 catches for 644 yards and five touchdowns, very impressive numbers in an era when running backs usually did not catch more than 10 passes during a season.

In 1986, Renfro was enshrined in the College Football Hall of Fame and is a member of The Pigskin Club of Washington, D.C., a National Intercollegiate All-American Football Players Honor Roll. He is considered to be the best running back in the history of the University of Oregon, other than LaMichael James.

===Track and field===
From 1960 through 1965, the Oregon&#x27;s men&#x27;s track and field team led by coach Bill Bowerman was one of the best in the United States. In 1962, Renfro contributed to the university&#x27;s first NCAA team championship by finishing second behind teammate Jerry Tarr in the high hurdles with a 13.8 time and third in the long jump with a 25&#x27;-11¼&quot; (7.905 m) leap.

That year, Renfro was part of a world-record-setting 440-yard relay team with a time of 40.0 seconds; his running mates were Tarr, Mike Gaechter and Harry Jerome. At the end of the year, he was named to the All-American track and field team in the high hurdles and the broad jump.

In 1963, Renfro injured his knee on a foul broad jump in the NCAA Championships. In the same meet at Albuquerque, despite the injury, he entered the high hurdles but failed to qualify.

==Professional career==

Renfro was drafted in the second round of the 1964 NFL draft, 17th overall, by the Dallas Cowboys. The selection delayed the draft for six hours, while the Cowboys sent a doctor to check an injury he suffered on his wrist.

Although Renfro had won many accolades as a running back and at the time, teams put their best athletes on the offensive side of the ball, Tom Landry, looking to build a dominating defense, decided to start him at safety. As a rookie, Renfro had an impressive season by leading the team with seven interceptions, the NFL in both punt return and kickoff return yardage (including a franchise-record 273 total return yards against the Green Bay Packers) and culminated his great campaign with an invitation to the Pro Bowl. The 30 yards per kick-off return average he posted in his second year (1965) still remains a franchise record.

In 1966, despite Renfro coming off an All-Pro season at safety, the Cowboys named him their starting halfback in an effort to improve its offense. He was injured in the opening game against the New York Giants and replaced by Dan Reeves, who was so impressive that Renfro was moved back to defense when he returned to action and would end up being named to the All-Pro team again.

Renfro was switched to cornerback in his fifth season. The speedy Renfro (4.65 40-yd dash) became an exceptional threat to wide receivers, leading the NFL with 10 interceptions in 1969. Renfro was selected to the Pro Bowl in each of his first ten seasons in the league, including five All-Pro selections in 1964, 1965, 1969, 1971 and 1973. He was named the offensive MVP of the 1971 Pro Bowl for his two punt return touchdowns.

In his 14 seasons, Renfro intercepted 52 passes, returning them for 626 yards and three touchdowns. He also returned 109 punts for 842 yards and one touchdown, 85 kickoffs for 2,246 yards and two touchdowns, along with recording 13 fumble recoveries, which he returned for 44 yards. In the 1970 NFC Championship Game, Renfro had a key interception that led to the Cowboys&#x27; game-winning touchdown over the San Francisco 49ers that helped them get to Super Bowl V, where they lost to the Baltimore Colts, 16–13. In an enduring image from the game after Jim O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s game-winning kick, Renfro put his face in his hands in disappointment. Dallas returned in Super Bowls VI, X, and XII, Renfro&#x27;s last NFL game, a Cowboys&#x27; 27–10 victory over the Denver Broncos. He remains the Cowboys&#x27; all-time leader in interceptions with 52 (In 1969 he led the NFL in interceptions with 10) and in career kickoff-return average (26.4 yards). His 14 seasons with the team ties him for second place in franchise history.

Renfro joined the Dallas Cowboys Ring of Honor in 1981 and was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1996. During his time with the Cowboys, even though one of his teammates was former Olympic gold medalist and one-time world&#x27;s fastest man Bob Hayes, many experts still considered him the best athlete on the team.

==Personal life==
In 1984, Renfro coached the defensive secondary under John Hadl with the Los Angeles Express of the United States Football League (USFL). In 1986 he was part of Gene Stallings St. Louis Cardinals coaching staff as his defensive backs coach.

In the early 1980s, Renfro had financial and legal challenges. He currently works as a motivational speaker. Renfro has four children: Melvin Jr, Anthony, Cindy and Jason. He was married to Patricia Renfro through his entire career.

<text>Finspång () is a locality and the seat of Finspång Municipality, Östergötland County, Sweden with 12,440 inhabitants in 2010.

==Overview==

Finspång is a traditional industrial town. The first industries were established in 1580 when a Royal factory for cannon and cannon balls was chartered. The industry was to continue for 300 years under supervision of the Walloon/Dutch family De Geer. Anders Qvarfordt was employed by Count Louis de Geer. His assignment was &quot;to lodge and feed the Count de Geers Vallon blacksmiths&quot;. Finspång Castle was built by Louis De Geer (1622–1695), and around it industries and an orangery developed into the town of Finspång.

In the late 19th century Bofors steel works, which initially supplied forgings and castings to the factory, started to expand into the weapons business. With Alfred Nobel&#x27;s help, by the 1911 AB Bofors-Gullspång had outcompeted, bought and closed down its competitor.

When in 1913 a turbine plant STAL was founded in the town, both good metalwork facilities and skilled labor were available. In 1916 the company became a subsidiary of ASEA.

Today the two main industrial areas are those of Siemens Energy turbines and metal processing.

Administratively Finspång remained part of the rural municipality &quot;Risinge&quot; until 1942, when it was made a market town (&quot;köping&quot;). Since 1971 it is the seat of the enlarged Finspång Municipality.

<doc id="1012347" wikidata="Q2078672" url="?curid=1012347" title="Bro'Town">
<text>bro&#x27;Town is a New Zealand adult animated sitcom that aired on TV3 from 22 September 2004 to 24 May 2009. It starred David Fane, Mario Gaoa, Shimpal Lelisi and Oscar Kightley.

== Overview ==
The main characters in the series are five 14 year old Polynesian New Zealand boys who live in Morningside, Auckland, New Zealand. They attend the local college, St Sylvester&#x27;s. It was New Zealand&#x27;s first primetime animated television show and was very popular when it started in 2004 with 33 per cent of the viewing audience during its 8-8.30pm time slot for the first season. &quot;bro&#x27;Town&quot; is heavy with popular culture references, and is based on the comedy theatre group &quot;The Naked Samoans&quot;. The series has faced criticism often for being racist, for example every episode of the first season received complaints. The writers often describe the humour as being &#x27;not PC&#x27; (politically correct) and is satire with characters being sent-up. One of the series writers Oscar Kightley says of the humour, &quot;The only reason we get away with that irreverence and edgy stuff is because on the flipside is heart.&quot;

&quot;bro&#x27;Town&quot; has left a lasting legacy on popular culture in New Zealand driven by its urban Pacific Island culture. It has been critically acclaimed &quot;as hilarious and alarmingly true to life&quot;, studied at universities, and used for health messages in a cartoon booklet with information about rheumatic fever.

===Production===
Produced by New Zealand company Firehorse Films which was created by Elizabeth Mitchell for &quot;bro&#x27;Town&quot; and funded by New Zealand On Air. The lead designer was Ant Sang who was responsible for character, location and prop designs. &quot;bro&#x27;Town&quot; was made using three animation studios – two in New Zealand and one in India – and involved over 100 staff. The series was done in traditional ink and paint animation. The show satirises the boys&#x27; culture, with dialogue in the local vernacular. The series includes references to New Zealand literature, particularly the novels and short stories of Witi Ihimaera. The series has strong religious references, with most episodes starting with events between God, Jesus Christ and other historical figures, which leads to the theme of the episode and the subsequent events between the boys.

==Characters==

===The Boys===
* Vale Pepelo (Oscar Kightley) – (Vale loosely translates to Dumb) Brother of Valea Pepelo. He has a strong social conscience. Contrary to his given name, Vale is considered the intelligent one of the group, frequently seen carrying a literary classic. (Samoan)
* Valea Pepelo (Shimpal Lelisi) (Valea loosely translates to Dumber) – Brother of Vale Pepelo. He is more interested in girls than Vale. Whenever he sees an attractive girl, he does a rendition of the &#x27;schwing!&#x27; gesture (peyow peyow!) Valea&#x27;s name is an apt description. Valea has a description of &quot;the pasher&quot; after noting in a Bro&#x27; Town annual his goal in life is to &quot;pash hot chicks&quot; and his dream is for &quot;hot chicks&quot; that like to be &quot;pashed&quot;. Although loosely translated to Dumber, Valea is known to be only slightly behind in the National Standards. Jeff da Māori is more likely to fail exams, and, if under correct conditions (getting hit by a bus, for example) Valea is amazingly intelligent. (Samoan)
* Sione Tapili (Mario Gaoa) – From A Tongan Descent, his mother is known as a &quot;Sheman&quot; and is also Vale and Valea&#x27;s best friend. Sione is considered the rich and smart one of the group and considers himself as a ladies&#x27; man, while he constantly looking for ways to impress the girl of his dreams, sixth former Mila Jizovich. He is also the &quot;bro&quot; likely to have dream sequences e.g. posing as a super hero and starring in famous movies. (Tongan)
* Jeff da Māori (David Fane) – Jeff Da Māori lives with his mother and eight dads in a car shell outside the house. He is considered the clumsy and shy one by the group, He was brought up in the country by his aunt Queenie but then moved to the city for better TV reception and &quot;because the thieving colonialist stole our land&quot;. He is often portrayed with a horribly runny nose. He is known for his catchphrase &#x27;Not Even Ow!&#x27; (meaning &#x27;that ain&#x27;t right&#x27;). He is also known to call many people his cousin, and claims &quot;everyone&#x27;s my cousin, except Winston Peters he&#x27;s a &#x27;dick&#x27; ow&quot;. He is known to be actual cousins with famous actress Keisha Castle-Hughes and famous actor Cliff Curtis. (Māori)
* Rodney David Damascus McCorkenstein-Taifule aka Mack (David Fane) – Mack rounds out the group as a heavyset boy with an effeminate demeanour and a knack for talking his way out of things. Although he does stand behind his word eventually. He is of Jewish and Samoan descent from his mother and father respectively. Mack is considered the tough guy of the group, claiming to have been raised in the streets. He actually lives in a high class mansion with a loving mother and father. Mack&#x27;s homosexual tendencies and feminine behaviour are more and more obvious as the show develops, but his friends seem to choose to ignore it. He is also known to be a snob at school, probably excelling at most subjects, and noted to be reading &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot;. (Tongan/Jewish)

===Other characters of Morningside===
* Pepelo Pepelo (David Fane) – Vale and Valea&#x27;s dad is a benefit abusing, occasional fork-lift driver with a love of beer, pornography and gambling (aka &quot;The Town Drunk&quot;). His catchphrase is &quot;I&#x27;m going to the pub... I may be some time&quot;. Pepelo&#x27;s wife died when the boys were young and they were entrusted to his care. However, his method of child rearing was ignoring them to fend for themselves. The closest he inadvertently gets to parenting is occasionally telling the boys a relevant and touching story from his own life. He is known to discriminate against other ethnic minorities in Morningside, have frequent drunk-driving crashes and blame his dysfunctions on the war in Vietnam.
* Wong (David Fane) – Initially a Chinese exchange student from Hong Kong. After a rocky start he quickly became mates with the boys by sharing his wealth and letting them ride in his car. He once helped the Boys by joining in the St. Sylvester&#x27;s rugby team in &quot;Get Rucked&quot; and bet a million dollars on Honky the Wonderhorse. Wong has a brother named White, who exists only to facilitate a racist pun about being unable to tell White from Wong.
* Constable &quot;Bobby&quot; Bababiba (Mario Gaoa) – A cynical and unsympathetic policeman who, being the only police officer to appear on the show, has been involved with many of the boys&#x27; mishaps as he tries to restore order in Morningside. His image and name are based on actor Robbie Magasiva.
* Rakeesh Maadkraklikka (Mario Gaoa) – A disgruntled Indo-Fijian dairy store owner. He is eager to shoot and zap any potential troublemaker or thief in his store. Pepelo owes a massive debt to Rakeesh&#x27;s store due to his indulgence and improper spending. He is married to the beautiful Satisha.
* Satisha Maadkraklikka – Rakeesh&#x27;s spouse. She is not as brash as her husband, but Satisha is just as tough. However, she shows a sympathetic side as well: on two occasions Satisha helped The Boys with their problems and issues.
* Reverend Minister (Vela Manusaute) – Stereotypical minister who heads a Samoan flock in Morningside. He frequently preaches about the local issues in very vivid and exaggerated ways (as was featured in &quot;Sione-rella&quot; and &quot;Touched by a Teacher&quot;). He is also quick to drive his flock on mindless angry mob sprees. As a sideline for his church he also sells &#x27;authentic&#x27; holy items at high prices (like holy water and sheep-shaped caps). There seems to be an intimate relationship between him and Agnes. Agnes&#x27; youngest child has an uncanny resemblance to the minister, including his hairdo – for that matter, so do most of the very young children of his congregation. He is very similar to the Minister character in the recurring sketch &quot;Milburn Place&quot;, part of the &quot;Skitz&quot; comedy series in which several Naked Samoans were involved.
* Mahari Stevens (Vela Manusaute) – A Social worker from CYPFS -Children and Young Person&#x27;s Family Services (a reference to the NZ CYFS -Children Youth and Family Services). She appeared in the first episode when Pepelo disappeared for four days, responding to a ten-year-old complaint about his terrible parenting, and made the Pepelo brothers &quot;Wards of the State&quot;. She also later interrogated Mack and inadvertently manipulated him into accusing Brother Ken of child molestation, and threatened to take him away from his parents when he revealed it was in fact false.

===Tapili family===
* Agnes Esmeralda Beatrice fasi fufuTapili (David Fane) – Sione&#x27;s mother and the Pepelos&#x27; neighbour. She is deeply religious and physically aggressive, especially to Sione (she refuses to show this side of her in public, though). Despite this, she seems to have intimate relations with the local minister. She serves as a caricature of the overbearing Polynesian mother who will not hesitate to humiliate her children. Willing for a husband, she is shown to have phone sex with Pepelo Pepelo, even though she is shown to hate him.
* Sina Tapili – (Teuila Blakely) – Sione&#x27;s older sister and Mila&#x27;s friend. Sina views her brother and the boys disdainfully (constantly calling them losers), except for one time when Mack was crying. She attends St Cardinal&#x27;s College for girls, known to the boys of neighbouring St. Sylvester&#x27;s as &#x27;Cardinal Knowledge.&#x27;
* Timothy &quot;Motorcycle Boy&quot; Tapili – Agnes&#x27; eldest son. He is a delinquent who is a regular in the local delinquent centre (which Agnes euphemistically calls a &quot;boarding school&quot;) and jail. His real name and nature were exposed in the episode &quot;Go and ask Agnes&quot;, where it is revealed that his criminal record is not very impressive and he behaves more like a pretentious bully than the &quot;hardcore&quot; criminal he claims to be. He is shown to be a role model to Sione and Sione states he wants a bike like him.
* Samson – Agnes&#x27; youngest son. He is the presumed son of the minister, though Agnes refers to him as &quot;A miracle by Jesus&quot;.

===School folk and students===
* Brother Ken (David Fane) – St. Sylvester&#x27;s Fa’afafine principal. He is a personal childhood friend of many famous New Zealanders, including actress Lucy Lawless and former prime minister of New Zealand, Helen Clark. Brother Ken is a caring and reasonable principal, and once helped a then-young Mack (a nickname created by Brother Ken) to become friends with the boys. Because the concept of Fa’afafine, a person in Samoa, American Samoa and the Samoan diaspora who identifies themselves as having a third gender or non-binary role, which ranges from extravagantly feminine to conventionally masculine, does not readily translate, when the series was broadcast on Adult Swim Latin America, a decision was made not to translate Samoan words and just present them as part of the &quot;cultural journey&quot;.
* Rex Ruka – Rex is a typical sort of jock or alpha male in St. Sylvester&#x27;s. He is regularly seen mocking the boys due to their supposed inferiority with Joost by his side. Rex is Sione&#x27;s rival for Mila&#x27;s hand.
* Joost van der Van Van (Oscar Kightley) – A South African immigrant whose father Hansje manages the local zoo. As is expected, he acts as Rex&#x27;s partner, providing appreciation for his many putdowns (often saying &quot;Hilarious!&quot;). However, it was revealed in &quot;A Chicken Roll at My Table&quot; that Joost&#x27;s racism was an act and he only did it because he was discouraged by his grandfather from making friends with coloured people. His name is a nonsense parody of Dutch surnames and means &#x27;of the of.&#x27; Although unknown, it has been suggested that his name may have been derived from Springbok player Joost van der Westhuizen.
* Mila Jizovich – A Croatian student of St. Cardinal&#x27;s, best friends with Sina Tapili and Sione’s crush. She is best known for helping Lucy Lawless with the birth control presentation in &quot;Sionerella&quot;. Her name appears to be a combination of tribute to the actress Milla Jovovich and the word &quot;jizz&quot;, a vulgar term in reference to semen.
* Abo (Abercrombie Smith the Third) – An Aboriginal Australian who studies in St. Sylvester&#x27;s. His nickname is either derived from a racial slur or his real name, Abercrombie. Abercrombie is known to celebrate every occasion with a (often very long) traditional song or dance. He is often seen riding an emu. Though Abercrombie has made political comments regarding Indigenous native title, the satirical point of this character is unclear as very few Aboriginal Australians live in New Zealand. As such, he is more surreal than satirical.
* Ms. Lynn Grey – A teacher who manages The Boys&#x27; class at St. Sylvester&#x27;s. She seems to have an affection for Māori men (as is shown in &quot;A Māori at my Table&quot;). A parody of well-meaning liberal Anglo-Saxon, she will carefully use Māori vocabulary but immediately follow it with a slightly patronising English explanation. Her name is a reference to the Auckland suburb of Grey Lynn.

===Figures in Heaven===
* God (Mario Gaoa) – As the creator of the universe, God can choose to be anything he wants. Thus he is satirically portrayed as a well-built Pacific Islander in a lavalava. He appears mellow and easy-going, rather than strict and wrathful. God starts each episode in Heaven as if it were a fairy-tale, usually telling it to Jesus Christ and other famous, deceased notable figures.
* Jesus (Shimpal Lelisi) – The Lord&#x27;s only son. Unlike the past serious and solemn renditions of the Christian divinity, Bro&#x27;Town portrays him as young and naive (despite his past mortal life more than 2000 years ago). He generally seems like a somewhat wimpish teenager, who often needs to be gently taught a lesson by his Father.

There are also two female angels Angelina and Angelita.

Occasionally, deceased relatives such as Pepelo&#x27;s wife (Vale and Valea&#x27;s mother), or Jeff da Maori&#x27;s Auntie Queenie are featured, appearing in dreams to communicate with the living.

===Guest stars===
bro&#x27;Town frequently features special guests – notable celebrities from politics, art, culture, music, the media, business and sport. The most regular cameos are John Campbell and Carol Hirschfeld, newsreaders from TV3 at the time. Former All Blacks and Manu Samoa player Michael Jones plays the P.E. teacher at St Sylvester&#x27;s. Former New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark has appeared in all seasons except the last and rapper Scribe has been a guest on five seasons of bro&#x27;Town. A feature of the series are cameos of people playing themselves. This includes Russell Crowe, Rove McManus, Robyn Malcolm, Neil and Tim Finn, Lucy Lawless, Flight of the Conchords, H.R.H. Charles, Prince of Wales, Sir Howard Morrison, Keisha Castle-Hughes, Cliff Curtis and Madeline Sami.

<doc id="1012375" wikidata="Q323128" url="?curid=1012375" title="About Face (album)">
<text>About Face is the second solo studio album by the English singer and musician David Gilmour, released on 5 March 1984 by Harvest in the UK and Columbia in the United States, a day before Gilmour&#x27;s 38th birthday. Co-produced by Bob Ezrin and Gilmour, the album was recorded in 1983 at Pathé Marconi Studio, in Boulogne-Billancourt, France. The lyrics of two tracks, &quot;All Lovers Are Deranged&quot; and &quot;Love on the Air&quot;, were written by Pete Townshend of The Who. Townshend&#x27;s version of &quot;All Lovers Are Deranged&quot; appears on his solo compilation album &quot;Scoop 3&quot; (2001).

The album received positive reviews and peaked at number 21 on UK Albums Chart and number 32 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 200 Albums chart. Two singles were released: &quot;Blue Light&quot; peaked at number 62 in the United States, while &quot;Love on the Air&quot; failed to chart. Like Gilmour&#x27;s eponymous debut solo studio album, &quot;About Face&quot; was certified gold by the RIAA. A remastered reissued CD was released in 2006 on EMI in Europe and Columbia for the rest of the world.

==Recording==
The album was recorded with engineer Andy Jackson at a time when Pink Floyd&#x27;s future was uncertain. It was mixed by James Guthrie at Mayfair Studios in London, England.

Gilmour said he wanted to take his time and make &quot;a really good album&quot; and &quot;get the best musicians in the world that I could get hold of to play with me.&quot; Musicians on the album include drummer Jeff Porcaro, bassist Pino Palladino, Deep Purple keyboardist Jon Lord, backing vocalists Roy Harper, and Sam Brown, orchestral arranger Michael Kamen (who had also worked on &quot;The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking&quot;, &quot;The Final Cut&quot;, and &quot;The Wall&quot;), and keyboardist Steve Winwood.

Another piece of music written for the album was not used by Gilmour. He asked Roy Harper and separately, Pete Townshend, to supply lyrics, but felt that those provided were not messages that he could relate to. Harper subsequently used the tune, with his lyrics, as &quot;Hope&quot;, on his 13th studio album, &quot;Whatever Happened to Jugula?&quot; (1985). Townshend used it with his lyrics as &quot;White City Fighting&quot;, which has a markedly faster tempo, on his fourth solo studio album &quot;White City: A Novel&quot; (1985), on which Gilmour plays.

==Music and lyrics==
Gilmour was later interviewed by Dallas, Texas-based disc jockey (DJ) Doug &quot;Redbeard&quot; Hill, on the radio program, &quot;In the Studio with Redbeard&quot; during which the focus was his 2006 third solo studio album &quot;On an Island&quot;. He commented on &quot;About Face&quot; saying that, &quot;looking back on it, it has some great moments on there but the whole flavor of it is too &#x27;80s for my current tastes.&quot;

&quot;Murder&quot; was an outcry by Gilmour about the senseless killing of John Lennon, a longtime musical peer and inspiration to him. Gilmour embellished the song with a solo fretless bassline (played by Pino Palladino), adding an edgy funk groove to the acoustic beginning of the song, leading to an instrumental bridge, where the song picks up in the speed of the beat with more electric instruments. Gilmour collaborated with Townshend on the songs &quot;Love on the Air&quot; and &quot;All Lovers Are Deranged,&quot; as Gilmour recalled: &quot;I sent him three songs and he sent back three sets of lyrics. Two of them suited me well. One didn&#x27;t. He did the two on &quot;About Face&quot; and he did the other one [&#x27;White City Fighting&#x27;] on his &quot;White City&quot; album.&quot; The lyrics for &quot;Love on the Air&quot; were written in a day, after Gilmour had asked for Townshend&#x27;s help. &quot;You Know I&#x27;m Right&quot; was written in a similar vein to Lennon&#x27;s &quot;How Do You Sleep?&quot; and was a dig towards Waters. &quot;Cruise&quot; was about Ronald Reagan having cruise missiles stationed in Britain at the time.

==Release==
The album featured the single &quot;Love on the Air,&quot; with lyrics by Townshend, and the disco-style single &quot;Blue Light&quot;, later remixed by François Kevorkian; &quot;Blue Light&quot; was released, backed with &quot;Cruise&quot;, on 13 February 1984, while &quot;Love on the Air&quot;, backed with &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Metaphysical&quot; on 24 April. The album was released on 5 March in the UK, and on 6 March in the United States (coincidentally on Gilmour&#x27;s 38th birthday). &quot;All Lovers Are Deranged&quot; and &quot;Murder&quot; were released as singles for North American rock radio; the former reaching #10 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Mainstream Rock chart.

==Critical reception==

Writing for AllMusic, critic Tom Demalon wrote of the album &quot;The songs on &quot;About Face&quot;&#x27; show a pop sensibility that Pink Floyd rarely was concerned with achieving,&quot; adding that &quot;&quot;About Face&quot; is a well-honed rock album that is riveting from beginning to end.&quot;

<text>Valentín Alsina (December 16, 1802 – September 6, 1869) was an Argentine lawyer and politician.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Alsina was born in Buenos Aires and studied law at the University of Córdoba. He occupied diverse posts in government, and had a successful civil career as an advocate and professor of law at the University of Buenos Aires.

===Political views===
Under the government of Juan Manuel de Rosas, he had to leave the country, as his liberal ideas did not please the dictator at all. From his refuge in Montevideo, he supported the opposition against de Rosas, both financially and through publications.

When Rosas was deposed by Justo José de Urquiza, Alsina returned to Buenos Aires, and he was elected provincial Governor in 1852. However, he resigned after a few months, shortly before a military coup took place. In 1853, Buenos Aires left the Argentine Confederation and declared itself an independent state. Alsina, a fervent supporter of Buenos Aires Province independence, became Governor again in 1857. In 1859, open hostilities broke out between Buenos Aires and the Argentine Confederation, led by Urquiza. After the defeat of the Buenos Aires army at the Battle of Cepeda on October 23, 1859, Alsina had to resign his post, and shortly after Buenos Aires rejoined the Confederation. Alsina became a member of the Argentine Senate in 1862.

When Bartolomé Mitre (President of Argentina between 1862 and 1868) offered him a position as member of the Argentine Supreme Court he refused and remained serving as a Senator until his death, which occurred just a few months after he took the oath of his son Adolfo Alsina, who became Vice President of Argentina in 1868.

<doc id="1012386" wikidata="Q3066331" url="?curid=1012386" title="Bitot's spots">
<text>Bitot&#x27;s spots are the buildup of keratin located superficially in the conjunctiva of human&#x27;s eyes. They can be oval, triangular or irregular in shape. The spots are a sign of vitamin A deficiency and associated with drying of the cornea. In 1863, the French physician Pierre Bitot (1822–1888) first described these spots.
The spots may abate under replacement therapy. 
In ancient Egypt, this was treated with animal liver, which is where vitamin A is stored.
==Causes==
A major cause of Bitot&#x27;s spots is vitamin A deficiency (VAD). Rarely, pellagra due to deficiency of vitamin B3 (niacin) may also cause Bitot&#x27;s spots. They can also be caused by Colestyramine , which is a bile acid sequestrant which can reduce the absorption of fat soluble vitamins (Vitamins A, D, E, K)

==Treatment==
VAD is commonly treated with oral vitamin A supplements. Improvement of Bitot&#x27;s spots is seen with high-dose vitamin A therapy. Bitot&#x27;s spots non-responsive to vitamin A therapy may be removed surgically.

<doc id="1012392" wikidata="Q2836843" url="?curid=1012392" title="Alien Hominid">
<text>Alien Hominid is a run and gun video game developed by The Behemoth and first released as a Flash game on the multimedia website Newgrounds on August 7, 2002. It was originally developed in Adobe Flash by programmer and Newgrounds founder, Tom Fulp, and animator and artist, Dan Paladin. It has since been re-released in several expanded and enhanced iterations for home consoles and computers.

The first re-release of &quot;Alien Hominid&quot; was with an expanded console version released on the PlayStation 2, GameCube and Xbox in 2004 and 2005. A port for the Game Boy Advance, developed by Tuna Technologies, was released in 2006 for PAL territories. A high-definition version titled &quot;Alien Hominid 360&quot; (formerly known as &quot;Alien Hominid HD&quot;) was released for Xbox 360 via Xbox Live Arcade in 2007. Another remaster, &quot;Alien Hominid HD&quot;, was released for Windows, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S on November 1, 2023, alongside a sequel, &quot;Alien Hominid Invasion&quot;. It is also planned to release for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Alien Hominid&quot; is a side-scrolling Run and Gun Shooter in a similar vein to games such as &quot;Metal Slug&quot;, where one hit instantly kills and has a two-player simultaneous play. Players take over as the titular hominid, who has to fend off waves of secret agents. His main arsenal is a blaster, while players can also melee close-up enemies and use a limited number of grenades to attack. Advanced moves include rolling under shots, jumping on and biting off enemies&#x27; heads, temporarily scaring other enemies, and digging underground to drag enemies down with them.

Players can collect a numerous variety of power-ups which simultaneously give players extra grenades, a shield, and unique ammo. Players can also drive vehicles, ride on top of a Yeti, and pilot a UFO. Completing certain tasks will unlock hats the players can dress their Hominid in. The main game features sixteen stages.

Outside of the main game, there are three multiplayer modes (Challenge, Neutron Ball, and Pinata Boss), a PDA game (featuring around 200 levels and a level editor), an extra mode called &quot;All You Can Eat&quot;, and a retro minigame, &quot;Super Soviet Missile Mastar&quot;.

==Plot ==
The Alien Hominid that the game follows is flying over Earth when the FBI intercept its spacecraft, sending it crashing down to the planet. While the alien lies unconscious from the crash, FBI agents promptly steal its ship, causing it to go after the FBI to get the ship back, with the help of young citizens of the city, known in the game as &quot;fat kids&quot;. Upon retrieving the ship, the alien flies right into a Soviet missile that was traveling towards America, detonating it and sending the alien crashing down into Russia. The alien then retrieves the ship a second time, before being captured by an Area 51 spaceship. While being transported in a cage by an Area 51 agent across the desert, a bump in the road causes the cage to fall out from behind and break, freeing the alien. During the alien&#x27;s third search for his ship, he befriends a sentient eyeball that piloted robots the alien fought previously. While the eyeball helps the alien, a similar-looking buff alien fights the alien as the agents cheer it on. After defeating the buff alien, the &quot;fat kids&quot; seize an Area 51 truck, place the alien and eyeball back in the alien&#x27;s ship, set it to take off, and begin to drive away. With the Area 51 agents on the kids&#x27; tail, the alien places a tractor beam over the kids, lifting them out of the truck.

==Reception==
The game received &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot; on all platforms except the Game Boy Advance version, which received universal acclaim, according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. It was nominated for &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s annual &quot;Funniest Game&quot; award, which went to &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot;.

Before its release, &quot;Alien Hominid&quot; received notice in gaming magazines such as &quot;Play&quot;, &quot;GMR&quot;, &quot;Edge&quot;, &quot;Dragon&quot;, and mainstream magazines such as &quot;Wired&quot;. In reviews for the game, it was critically acclaimed for its old-school style gameplay, tough level of difficulty, and quirky humor. The game also won many small awards, most notably at the Independent Games Festival (for Innovation In Visual Arts, Technical Excellence and the Audience Award).

==Legacy==
Hominid appears during one of the levels in The Behemoth&#x27;s 2nd game, &quot;Castle Crashers&quot;, using a lance weapon based on his ray gun. He is playable to anyone who has also downloaded &quot;Alien Hominid 360&quot; on the Xbox 360 version, while he is unlocked by completing said level on the PlayStation Network and Steam versions of the game. The green eyeball from an early boss fight also appears as an Animal Orb, firing lasers at enemies. Hominid appears as a playable character in Team Meat&#x27;s &quot;Super Meat Boy&quot;, another game that originated as a flash game on Newgrounds. The &quot;Super Soviet Missile Mastar&quot; minigame from &quot;Alien Hominid&quot; was released as a free app for iOS on February 7, 2011. An improved version of the &quot;PDA Games&quot; minigame was released for iOS on December 9, 2011. Developer Tom Fulp has cited the &quot;PDA Games&quot; as being the inspiration for The Behemoth&#x27;s third game, &quot;BattleBlock Theater&quot;, which features unlockable &quot;Hominid&quot; character heads for those who own &quot;Alien Hominid 360&quot;.

On January 30, 2020, Behemoth announced their fifth game, Alien Hominid Invasion, which they describe as &quot;an all-new re-imagination&quot; of the original game featuring new gameplay and mechanics. The game is in development for Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, and PC. It was released on November 1, 2023. A remaster of the original game, &quot;Alien Hominid HD&quot;, was released alongside &quot;Invasion&quot; for Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch and PC.

<text>United Socialist Organisation was a left-wing alliance in India. The USOI was launched by Sarat Chandra Bose, the elder brother of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, after his resignation from the Indian National Congress in 1947. Bose wanted to assemble all the leftist groups in a common front. Most notably, the All India Forward Bloc under Sheel Bhadra Yagee joined USOI. However, a minority led by Forward Bloc chairman K.M. Joglekar disagreed with AIFB joining USOI. They broke away and formed the Forward Communist Party.

Ahead of the 1952 Indian general elections, USO comprised All India Forward Bloc, Sarat Chandra Bose&#x27;s Socialist Republican Party, Bolshevik Party of India, Indian National Army, People&#x27;s Movement and others and independents. USOI came to an understanding with Communist Party of India to form an anti-Congress front in West Bengal. Attempts were made to involve RSP in this front, but the negotiations ahead of the elections failed. Attempts were also made to reach agreements with Kisan Mazdoor Praja Party and Socialist Party of India, but no agreement was possible.

In total, USO fielded 72 candidates in the West Bengal assembly and CPI 71. For the Lok Sabha USOI fielded 8 candidates and CPI 9. In two constituencies the front supported RSP candidates. In other constituencies the front and RSP were in contest. In constituencies where there was no front candidate, the front appealed to voters to cast their vote for KMPP or the Socialist Party.

After the election, RSP joined the front.

==Results==
The election was won by the Indian National Congress, who got a majority of its own in the assembly. The communists became the largest opposition party.

<doc id="1012395" wikidata="Q5256888" url="?curid=1012395" title="Denel Dynamics Bateleur">
<text>The Bateleur (named for the bateleur eagle) is an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) prototype designed and built by Denel Dynamics (formerly Kentron). It has been designed as a MALE (medium-altitude - long endurance) UAV, with its primary role being surveillance, with a secondary signals intelligence capability.

Development began in 2003 as a totally in-house and private-venture project, being developed with internal company funds. The first prototype was expected to fly in early 2006 but this has not yet happened. The aircraft was included in a Brazilian Air Force RFP for UAVs in early 2009, though the competition has not been concluded. The South African National Defence Force (SANDF) has expressed interest in the system, but requested in 2006 that the cost of the system be reduced before an acquisition could be considered. In 2008, the South African Air Force announced a project, named &quot;Itambo&quot;, to acquire a MALE UAV in the 2008-2012 timeframe, with the Bateleur presumed to be a front-runner.

The entire aircraft is constructed using a modular construction system, making future adaptations of the airframe for increased range or larger payloads simpler than would be possible with a rigid airframe. It also makes it possible for the aircraft, once disassembled, to fit inside a 6 m ISO shipping container.

It is able to carry a variety of payloads, with a maximum payload mass of 200 kg (440 lb).

Initially, proposed payloads include the Denel Optronics Argos-410 electro-optical (E/O) and infrared (IR) system (with optional laser rangefinder), the Denel Optronics Goshawk-350 E/O and IR system (also with optional laser rangefinder), a laser designator, an Avitronics Emitter Locating System, electronic intelligence equipment, and/or a synthetic aperture radar.

Though at present it has a maximum &quot;action radius&quot; of only , a Ku-band satellite datalink was proposed which will allow the Bateleur to extend its range to around 3 500 km (2 175 miles), making it suitable for missions requiring longer ranges such as maritime patrol.

The Bateleur takes off and lands conventionally, on a runway, and has retractable undercarriage.

It is also completely autonomous, allowing it to take off, conduct its mission, and land all without human control being required.

==Roles and missions==

<doc id="1012403" wikidata="Q631817" url="?curid=1012403" title="David Gilmour (album)">
<text>David Gilmour is the debut solo studio album by Pink Floyd guitarist and co-lead vocalist David Gilmour, released on 26 May 1978. The album reached number 17 in the UK and number 29 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; US album charts; it was certified Gold in the US by the RIAA. The album was produced by Gilmour, and consists mostly of blues and guitar-oriented rock songs, except for the piano-dominated ballad &quot;So Far Away&quot;.

==Production and recording==
The tracks used for the album were recorded between February and March 1978 with engineer John Etchells at Super Bear Studios in France. They were then mixed at the same studio by Nick Griffiths. Session musicians included bass guitarist Rick Wills and drummer Willie Wilson, both of whom used to be part of Jokers Wild with Gilmour. The album was recorded at the same studio where Pink Floyd bandmate Richard Wright had recorded his first solo album &quot;Wet Dream&quot; just weeks before, though it would not be released until September 1978.

==Album&#x27;s cover artwork==

The album cover used for the first EMI pressings of the album LP was done by Hipgnosis and Gilmour and includes Gilmour, Rick Wills and Willie Wilson in the cover photo; Gilmour was credited on the cover for contributing &quot;Keyboards, Vocals&quot; though he was primarily a guitarist. The CBS/Columbia pressings (outside Europe) listed Gilmour as contributing &quot;Guitars, Keyboards, Vocals&quot;. Among those depicted on the inner sleeve is Gilmour&#x27;s then-wife, Ginger.

==Single and songs==
The album&#x27;s only single was &quot;There&#x27;s No Way Out of Here.&quot; The single flopped in Europe, but became popular on album-oriented rock radio stations in the US. The song was originally recorded by the band Unicorn (as &quot;No Way Out of Here&quot;) for their 1976 album &quot;Too Many Crooks&quot; (Harvest Records, US title &quot;Unicorn 2&quot;), which Gilmour produced. It was also recorded later by New Jersey stoner rock band Monster Magnet on their &quot;Monolithic Baby!&quot; album, and by Iron &amp; Wine on his 2015 covers album Sing Into My Mouth.

One unused tune that was written and demoed at the time would later evolve, via collaboration with Roger Waters, into Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; from &quot;The Wall&quot;. However, a song included on this album, the piano ballad &quot;So Far Away&quot;, uses a chorus progression not unlike the chorus to &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot;, albeit in a different key.

Likewise, the song &quot;Short and Sweet&quot; can be seen as a musical precursor to &quot;Run Like Hell&quot; (also from &quot;The Wall&quot;), with its shifting chords over a D pedal point, using a flanged guitar in Drop D tuning. &quot;Short and Sweet&quot; was written in collaboration with Roy Harper, who recorded a version, on which Gilmour played, for his 1980 album &quot;The Unknown Soldier&quot;.

==Promotion==
A five-song promotional film was made to promote the album. The band comprised Gilmour himself on guitars and vocals plus the two musicians on the album (bass player Rick Wills and drummer Willie Wilson) plus David Gilmour&#x27;s brother Mark on rhythm guitar and Ian McLagan on keyboards and performed &quot;Mihalis&quot;, &quot;There&#x27;s No Way Out of Here&quot;, &quot;So Far Away&quot;, &quot;No Way&quot;, and &quot;I Can&#x27;t Breathe Anymore&quot;. There were three female backing singers on &quot;There&#x27;s No Way Out of Here&quot; and &quot;So Far Away&quot;: Debbie Doss, Shirley Roden, and Carlena Williams. The promo was recorded live at The Roxy, London.

Also, Gilmour promoted the album with his first ever interviews with North American media and FM rock radio stations. The promotion paid off as the album made a respectable showing on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album charts peaking at number 29, which - until 2006&#x27;s &quot;On an Island - &quot;was Gilmour&#x27;s highest charting solo album in the US, eventually going Gold.

==Release and reception==

The album was released in the UK on 26 May 1978, and in June 1978 in the US, on Harvest and Columbia respectively.

In an interview with &quot;Circus&quot; in 1978, Gilmour said: &quot;This album [&quot;David Gilmour&quot;] was important to me in terms of self-respect. At first I didn&#x27;t think my name was big enough to carry it. Being in a group for so long can be a bit claustrophobic, and I needed to step out from behind Pink Floyd&#x27;s shadow.&quot;

==Track listing==
All music composed by David Gilmour except &quot;There&#x27;s No Way Out of Here&quot; written by Ken Baker. All lyrics by Gilmour, except where noted.


===2006 Remastered Edition===

&quot;David Gilmour&quot; was re-released by EMI Records in Europe as a digitally remastered CD on 14 August 2006. Legacy Recordings/Columbia Records released the remastered CD in the US and Canada on 12 September 2006. It features slightly extended versions of some of the tracks.

<doc id="1012408" wikidata="Q1306809" url="?curid=1012408" title="A Short History of Nearly Everything">
<text>A Short History of Nearly Everything by American-British author Bill Bryson is a popular science book that explains some areas of science, using easily accessible language that appeals more to the general public than many other books dedicated to the subject. It was one of the bestselling popular science books of 2005 in the United Kingdom, selling over 300,000 copies.

&quot;A Short History&quot; deviates from Bryson&#x27;s popular travel book genre, instead describing general sciences such as chemistry, paleontology, astronomy, and particle physics. In it, he explores time from the Big Bang to the discovery of quantum mechanics, via evolution and geology.

== Background ==
Bill Bryson wrote this book because he was dissatisfied with his &quot;scientific knowledge&quot;—that was, not much at all. He writes that science was a distant, unexplained subject at school. Textbooks and teachers alike did not ignite the passion for knowledge in him, mainly because they never delved into the &quot;whys&quot;, &quot;hows&quot;, and &quot;whens&quot;.

== Contents ==
Bryson describes graphically and in layperson&#x27;s terms the size of the universe and that of atoms and subatomic particles. He then explores the history of geology and biology and traces life from its first appearance to today&#x27;s modern humans, emphasizing the development of the modern &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;. Furthermore, he discusses the possibility of the Earth being struck by a meteorite and reflects on human capabilities of spotting a meteor before it impacts the Earth, and the extensive damage that such an event would cause. He also describes some of the most recent destructive disasters of volcanic origin in the history of our planet, including Krakatoa and Yellowstone National Park.

A large part of the book is devoted to relating humorous stories about the scientists behind the research and discoveries and their sometimes eccentric behaviours. Bryson also speaks about modern scientific views on human effects on the Earth&#x27;s climate and livelihood of other species, and the magnitude of natural disasters such as earthquakes, volcanoes, tsunamis, hurricanes, and the mass extinctions caused by some of these events.

An illustrated edition of the book was released in November 2005. A few editions in audiobook form are also available, including an abridged version read by the author, and at least three unabridged versions.

== Awards and reviews ==
The book received generally favourable reviews, with reviewers citing the book as informative, well-written, and entertaining.

In 2004, this book won Bryson The Aventis Prizes for Science Books for best general science book. Bryson later donated the GBP£10,000 prize to the Great Ormond Street Hospital children&#x27;s charity.

In 2005, the book won the EU Descartes Prize for science communication. It was shortlisted for the Samuel Johnson Prize for the same year.

<doc id="1012418" wikidata="Q759291" url="?curid=1012418" title="Auer rod">
<text>Auer rods (or Auer bodies) are large, crystalline cytoplasmic inclusion bodies sometimes observed in myeloid blast cells during acute myeloid leukemia, acute promyelocytic leukemia, high-grade myelodysplastic syndromes and myeloproliferative disorders. Composed of fused lysosomes and rich in lysosomal enzymes, Auer rods are azurophilic and can resemble needles, commas, diamonds, rectangles, corkscrews, or (rarely) granules.

==Eponym==
Although Auer rods are named for American physiologist John Auer, they were first described in 1905 by Canadian physician Thomas McCrae, then at Johns Hopkins Hospital, as Auer himself acknowledged in his 1906 paper. Both McCrae and Auer mistakenly thought that the cells containing the rods were lymphoblasts.

<text>Procovery is a proprietary methodology focused on the process of how individuals with serious and chronic illnesses, trauma, addiction, injuries and loss can build healthier and more fulfilling lives, notwithstanding the possible continuing presence or worsening of symptoms or circumstances.

The concept of Procovery was created by writer Kathleen Crowley in 1996 and her program of Procovery principles and strategies, and Procovery Circles, resulted from years of research and interviews of individuals who found resilience, and those who supported and cared for them.

<doc id="1012443" wikidata="Q461629" url="?curid=1012443" title="Barbara-Rose Collins">
<text>Barbara-Rose Collins (née Richardson; April 13, 1939 – November 4, 2021) was an American politician from the U.S. state of Michigan and the first black woman from Michigan to be elected to Congress.

==Life and career==
Collins was born as Barbara-Rose Richardson in Detroit, Michigan, the daughter of Lou Versa (Jones) and Lamar Nathaniel Richardson, a Ford Motor Co. employee. She is an alumnus of Cass Technical High School in Detroit, Michigan where she attended in 1957. She earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science and Anthropology from Wayne State University.

In 1960, Barbara-Rose Collins became divorced and a single mom. Barbara-Rose Collins worked multiple jobs and had public assistance until beginning a position as a Business Manager at Wayne State University. She worked as a Business Manager for the Physics department at Wayne State University for 9 years.

After hearing a speech by Black activist Stokely Carmichael at Detroit&#x27;s Shrine of the Black Madonna Church in the late 1960s, Barbara-Rose Collins became inspired by the speech to pursue a career in activism to uplift communities. Later, she was supported by the pastor of the Shrine Church to pursue a career in state legislature. She ran for a seat in 1974.

During her early campaign days in 1974, Collins hyphenated her first and middle names, changing from Barbara Rose to Barbara-Rose, to distinguish herself from other candidates.

Collins was a member of the Detroit Public School Board from 1971 to 1973, the Michigan House of Representatives for the 21st district from 1975 to 1981, and the Detroit City Council from 1982 to 1991. During her time on the Detroit Public School Board, she earned recognition for her &quot;school safety and academic achievement.&quot;

In 1988, she lost a primary election to the incumbent U.S. representative for what was then Michigan&#x27;s 13th congressional district, George W. Crockett, Jr. When he retired, she won the seat, taking 34 percent of the vote in a crowded eight-way Democratic primary. This was tantamount to election in this heavily Democratic, black-majority district. She won handily in November and was reelected three more times, each time garnering over 80 percent of the vote. Her district was renumbered as the 15th district after the 1990 census.

Collins was a sponsor of several bills that passed into law, including the Food Dating Bill, the Sex Education Bill, and the Pregnancy Insurance Bill. She also introduced the Unrenumerated Work Act in 1991, 1993, and 1994. This bill would have required the Bureau of Labor Statistics to set value on unwaged work such as housework, care work, agricultural work, volunteer work, and work in a family business, and include that value in the Gross National Product of the United States. This measure had been called for in the Forward Looking Strategies resolution passed at the World Conference on Women, 1985. Collins&#x27;s bill was endorsed by the Congressional Caucus for Women&#x27;s Issues and by 1993 had 90 co-sponsors; however, it failed to pass.

Collins was the subject of a United States House Committee on Ethics inquiry in 1995, under suspicion of 11 instances of misuse of funds. In 1996, after she lost the Democratic primary for re-election to Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick, the inquiry was dropped. After five years out of politics, Collins returned to the Detroit City Council in 2001. She was re-elected in 2005 and retired in 2009.

== Juneteenth ==
In 1996, Collins was the first congressperson to introduce legislation to make Juneteenth a federal holiday. According to the ACLU of Michigan, &quot;Michigan&#x27;s own Congresswoman Barbara Rose Collins introduced a bill in 1996 that petitioned the U.S. government to make Juneteenth a federal holiday.  In her congressional remarks, she stated, &quot;the dehumanizing and degrading conditions of slavery were unnecessarily prolonged for hundreds of thousands of black men, women, and children, because our American government failed to communicate the truth&quot; (2017). Juneteenth finally became a federal holiday in 2021.

== Death ==
Collins died from COVID-19 at a Detroit hospital, on November 4, 2021, at age 82, during the COVID-19 pandemic in Michigan. According to her son, she had been vaccinated with the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine. According to one of her grandsons, Collins had health issues that contributed to her COVID-19 death despite her vaccination status.

== Personal life ==
Collins was the aunt of actor and comedian Sam Richardson.

&quot;Wet Dream&quot; was self-produced and Wright wrote all the songs himself, except &quot;Pink&#x27;s Song&quot;, which was co-written with his then-wife, Juliette, who, as Juliette Gale, had provided vocals to a pre-Pink Floyd song &quot;Walk with Me Sydney&quot;. &quot;Wet Dream&quot; was recorded at Super Bear Studios, Alpes-Maritimes, in early 1978, the same studio where bandmate David Gilmour would record his eponymous solo album just weeks after the recording of &quot;Wet Dream&quot;.

==Release and reception==
The album went virtually unnoticed at the time. The album has long been out of print in Wright&#x27;s native UK, but it was re-released on CD in the United States and Canada in the 1990s, with some success, and again in 2008 in Australia, following Wright&#x27;s death.

===2023 reissue and remixes===
The album was announced for a CD and digital re-issue on 28 July 2023, which would have been Wright&#x27;s 80th birthday. It features a new stereo mix by Steven Wilson and new artwork with previously unseen photos from the period. The new stereo mix was released on vinyl and on BD, which also includes multi-channel Dolby Atmos and 5.1 surround sound mixes by Wilson on 29 September 2023, the album&#x27;s 45th anniversary. The 2023 reissues originally did not include the original 1978 mix of the album, but after fan feedback a flat transfer pre-master of the original mix was added to the Blu-ray edition. On 28 June 2023 &quot;Cat Cruise&quot; was released as a digital single to promote the reissue.

The 2023 reissue CD credits Juliette Wright with the lyrics for &quot;Pink&#x27;s Song&quot;; This was the case on the original album (back cover) credits but on the disc itself she was erroneously credited with the lyrics to &quot;Against the Odds&quot;.

<text>Two Prudential Plaza is a 64-story skyscraper located in the Loop area of Chicago, Illinois. At tall, it is the seventh-tallest building in Chicago and the 28th-tallest in the U.S., being only five feet from 1,000 feet, making it the closest of any building under 1,000. Built in 1990, the building was designed by the firm Loebl Schlossman &amp; Hackl, with Stephen T. Wright as the principal in charge of design. It has received eight awards, including winning the Best Structure Award from the Structural Engineers Association of Illinois in 1995.

==History==
Construction started in 1988, and Two Prudential Plaza was completed in 1990. At the time of completion, Two Prudential was the world&#x27;s tallest reinforced concrete building. Its distinctive shape features stacked chevron setbacks on the north and south sides, a pyramidal peak rotated 45°, and an spire.

The building is attached to One Prudential Plaza (formerly known as the Prudential Building) since 1992. Without its spire, the building&#x27;s height is still slightly greater than that of One Prudential Plaza&#x27;s pinnacle.

In May 2006, BentleyForbes, a Los Angeles–based real estate investment firm run by Frederick Wehba and his family, purchased Two Prudential Plaza, along with its sister property, One Prudential Plaza for $470 million (equivalent to $ in ).

In 2015, BentleyForbes defaulted on the mortgage for the towers due to the Great Recession and New York–based investors 601W Companies and Berkley Properties took control of the property after investing more than $100 million (more than $ in ) in equity to recapitalize. BentleyForbes continues to have an interest in the owning partnership.

==Tenants==
The Consulate General of Canada in Chicago is located in Suite 2400. The Flag of Canada is flown next to that of the United States in the building&#x27;s Lake Street plaza.

Audacy occupies the ninth to twelfth floors, including WBBM, WBBM-FM, WBMX, WXRT, WUSN, WSCR and WCFS.

== In popular culture ==
The building and the plaza appear in the 1994 film &quot;Richie Rich&quot; as Rich Industries Inc.

<doc id="1012486" wikidata="Q16058875" url="?curid=1012486" title="Jack Sheridan (umpire)">
<text>John F. Sheridan (April 30, 1862 – November 2, 1914) was an American umpire in Major League Baseball. In his 30-year career as an official, he worked 18 seasons between 1890 and 1914 in three major leagues. Several of Sheridan&#x27;s contemporaries considered him to be the best major league umpire. He pioneered the crouching stance used by modern umpires at home plate. In 1946 Sheridan was named to the Honor Rolls of Baseball of the Baseball Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Sheridan was born in Decatur, Illinois. His mother Bridget was born in Ireland. During his childhood, Jack&#x27;s family moved to San Jose, California, where he made his home thereafter. He enjoyed a brief career in the minor leagues as a second baseman. In 1883, Sheridan secured an advance of funds by convincing the manager of a Chattanooga minor league team that he would be an asset to the team. The manager was so disappointed in Sheridan&#x27;s abilities that he took out an arrest warrant on the player. Sheridan was forced to repay the money he earned by working at a cigarette factory. He turned to umpiring soon after traveling with a team of California players for an eastern tour.

==Career==
He began his career by umpiring in the Southern League in 1885, then officiated in the California League from 1886 to 1889, after which he gained his first major league experience in the sole season of the Players&#x27; League in 1890. Nearly all games in that era used a single umpire, and the most outstanding officials generally moved from league to league, going wherever the league presidents were perceived as being most supportive, both in salary and in affirming the umpires&#x27; field authority. After returning to the California League for the 1891 season, Sheridan umpired in the National League in 1892, then again in the Southern League in 1893.

In 1894–95, he umpired in the Western League, where he first became associated with that league&#x27;s president, Ban Johnson. Johnson was fiercely supportive of his umpiring staff, and apart from a brief return to the NL in 1896–97, including the 1896 Temple Cup, Sheridan would remain an umpire in Johnson&#x27;s league for the remainder of his career. In 1901, the Western League added several eastern cities and renamed itself the American League, and through a series of signings of NL players successfully established itself as a rival major league. In contrast to the rowdier NL, where umpires were routinely subjected to great abuse with little backing from the league office, Johnson staunchly defended his field officials and insisted that players and local authorities maintain respect for them.

When he was not umpiring, Sheridan worked as an undertaker. A 1905 newspaper article even described Sheridan as having announced his retirement to pursue undertaking in 1905. Before the 1906 season, Sheridan renewed his contract with the American League. In 1906, Sheridan ejected outfielder Tip O&#x27;Neill after an argument and may have been indirectly responsible for the end of O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s career. The outfielder was replaced by Pat Dougherty, who won the position for the season. O&#x27;Neill did not play in the major leagues after that year.

He became the standard after which other umpires patterned themselves; after arriving in the AL at age 22 in 1906, Billy Evans regularly worked in a team with Sheridan for several years in order to study under the senior umpire, with Sheridan usually working behind the plate and Evans on the bases. Both Evans and fellow Hall of Famer Bill Klem regarded Sheridan as the game&#x27;s greatest umpire. Many years later, Evans said, &quot;Each day while working the bases I would follow every move of Sheridan, as he shifted his body and stance back of the plate to follow the flight of the ball.&quot;
Sheridan umpired in four of the first seven World Series: 1905, 1907, 1908 and 1910; he also umpired in the earlier Temple Cup NL championship series in 1896. In the winter of 1913–1914, he and Klem were the two umpires accompanying the Chicago White Sox and New York Giants on their world tour. Along with Bob Emslie and Tim Hurst, he is one of only three umpires who umpired both before 1893, when the pitching distance was only 50 feet, and also after the NL and AL formally recognized one another as major leagues in 1903. He is the only umpire active prior to 1893 who went on to officiate in a World Series.

In September 1911, Sheridan asked Johnson for permission to permanently retire from umpiring. Johnson presented Sheridan with a medal of appreciation and said that while Sheridan would retire from the field, he expected the umpire to return to the league in an off-the-field capacity the next season. In March 1912, Sheridan said, &quot;But I guess when the bell rings I&#x27;ll be back in harness. Ban Johnson will need me when the fight grows hot.&quot; He umpired between June and August of that season. &quot;The Pittsburgh Press&quot; announced that Sheridan would retire before the 1913 season. He joined the umpiring staff in late June that year.

He suffered sunstroke while umpiring a game at Chicago in August 1914, and never fully recovered from the affliction. He called his last game on September 24 at Chicago, and despite the pleas of fellow officials insisted on remaining in the city for the crosstown series between the White Sox and Cubs before traveling to his home in California. Once there, his condition continued to deteriorate until he died three weeks later of a heart attack at age 52, at the San Jose home of his sister.

==Legacy==
The day after Sheridan died, the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; wrote that he was &quot;the most famous and oldest diamond official before the public and was popular because of his well-known honesty and ability.&quot;

Over his 14 seasons as the dean of AL umpires, Sheridan became the prototype of the 20th century umpire. Whereas umpires in the 19th century had worked behind the plate in a standing position, believing that it helped them to better observe the flight of the ball, Sheridan established the practice of crouching while calling balls and strikes, a move which was quickly adopted universally due to its effectiveness. He was also remarkable in that he refused to use any sort of protection other than a mask. He was agile enough to reportedly never be hit by a foul ball.

Sheridan was among the several umpires who were named to the Honor Rolls of Baseball by the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1946, at a time when no umpires had yet received full membership in the Hall. In the initial voting for induction of umpires in 1953, he finished third in the voting behind inductees Bill Klem and Tommy Connolly, and was the only other candidate to receive a first-place vote.

<doc id="1012493" wikidata="Q7654807" url="?curid=1012493" title="Swedish Peace and Arbitration Society">
<text>The Swedish Peace and Arbitration Society (SPAS) () is a non-governmental organization in Sweden, dedicated to peace, disarmament and democratization. It operates by methods including publishing, lobbying, activism and participating in political debates. SPAS has published an array of books and reports. The name of the organization&#x27;s member&#x27;s magazine is &quot;Pax&quot;. SPAS&#x27; central office is situated in Stockholm, headed by current president Agnes Hellström. However, there are about 20 local branches throughout Sweden. The society has a total of about 8500 members.

==History==
The Swedish Peace and Arbitration Society is the world&#x27;s oldest peace organization, and Scandinavia&#x27;s largest today. It was founded in 1883 by 50 Swedish parliamentarians and headed by Klas Pontus Arnoldson, who was awarded the 1908 Nobel Peace Prize.

Among SPAS&#x27; notable achievements are:
* Assisting the peaceful resolution of the dissolution of the union of Sweden and Norway in 1905; 
* Proposing alternative service for conscientious objectors, which became law in 1920; 
* Forming an 80,000-people human chain between the U.S. and Soviet embassies in Stockholm in 1983, and
* Exposing illegal and dubious Swedish arms export deals.

In 2015, after a Russian submarine was spotted off the coast of Sweden, in response to Russia’s ban of LGBT propaganda, the organization designed a subsurface sonar system with a depiction of a thrusting soldier and Morse code that translated to “This way if you are gay”.

==Criticism==
During Russian invasion of Ukraine, SPAS has been heavily criticised for its naive worldview and its position to not support Ukraine militarily. In Sweden, organisation&#x27;s members are frequently called &quot;traitors&quot; and &quot;Putin&#x27;s useful idiots&quot;.

== Surveillance by the Swedish Security Police ==
Swedish government has published reports revealing that SPAS was surveilled by the Swedish security police because of suspected links to Russian intelligence services.

<doc id="1012494" wikidata="Q5584986" url="?curid=1012494" title="Gordon Clark">
<text>Gordon Haddon Clark (August 31, 1902 – April 9, 1985) was an American philosopher and Calvinist theologian. He was a leading figure associated with presuppositional apologetics and was chairman of the Philosophy Department at Butler University for 28 years. He was an expert in pre-Socratic and ancient philosophy and was noted for defending the idea of propositional revelation against empiricism and rationalism, in arguing that all truth is propositional. His theory of knowledge is sometimes called &quot;scripturalism&quot;.

== Biography ==

Clark was raised in a Christian home and studied Calvinist thought from a young age. In 1924, he graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in French and earned his doctorate in Philosophy from the same institution in 1929. The following year he studied at the Sorbonne.

He began teaching at the University of Pennsylvania after receiving his bachelor&#x27;s degree and also taught at the Reformed Episcopal Seminary in Philadelphia. In 1936, he accepted a professorship in Philosophy at Wheaton College, Illinois, where he remained until 1943 when he accepted the Chairmanship of the Philosophy Department at Butler University in Indianapolis. After his retirement from Butler in 1973, he taught at Covenant College in Lookout Mountain, Georgia, and Sangre de Cristo Seminary in Westcliffe, Colorado.

Clark&#x27;s denominational affiliations would change many times. He was born into and eventually became a ruling elder in the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America. However, he would eventually leave with a small group of conservatives, led by John Gresham Machen, to help form the Presbyterian Church of America (renamed the Orthodox Presbyterian Church in 1938) and would be ordained in the OPC in 1944. However, in 1948, following the Clark-Van Til Controversy, he joined the United Presbyterian Church of North America. Following the UPCNA&#x27;s 1956 merger with the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America (the same denomination from which the OPC had separated from in 1936) to form the United Presbyterian Church in the United States of America, Clark joined the Reformed Presbyterian Church, General Synod in 1957. Clark was instrumental in arranging a merger between the RPCGS and the Evangelical Presbyterian Church to form the Reformed Presbyterian Church, Evangelical Synod in 1965. When the RPCES became part of the Presbyterian Church in America in 1982, Clark refused to join the PCA and instead entered the unaffiliated Covenant Presbytery in 1984.

Clark was also elected president of the Evangelical Theological Society in 1965.

He died in 1985 and was buried near Westcliffe, Colorado.

==Philosophy==

Clark&#x27;s philosophy and theology has been summarized as:
* Epistemology: propositional revelation in the Bible
* Soteriology: faith alone
* Metaphysics: theism
* Ethics: the superiority of divine law over human law/Christian egoism
* Politics: constitutional republic

==Personal life==

Clark met his future wife Ruth Schmidt during his graduate studies at the University of Pennsylvania; she had actually been baptized by Gordon&#x27;s father as a baby. They married in 1929 and stayed together for 48 years until Ruth&#x27;s death from leukemia in 1977. They had two daughters, Lois Antoinette (later Lois Zeller, b. 1936) and Nancy Elizabeth (later Betsy Clark George, b. 1941). At the time of his death, Clark was survived by his two daughters and their husbands, 12 grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.

Clark was well known as a keen chessplayer. In 1966, he won the championship of the King&#x27;s Men Chess Club in Indianapolis.

<doc id="1012497" wikidata="Q77936" url="?curid=1012497" title="Andreas Stihl">
<text>Andreas Stihl (10 November 1896 – 14 January 1973) was a Swiss-born German engineer and important inventor in the area of chainsaws, and the founder of Andreas Stihl AG &amp; Company KG. He is often hailed as the &quot;Father of the chainsaw&quot;.

== Early life ==
Stihl went to the Volksschule in Zürich, before moving to relatives in Germany. He attended the Realschule in Singen (Baden-Württemberg) and the Gymnasium in Düsseldorf-Oberkassel. From 1915 until his dismissal by injuries in 1917, Stihl fought in the First World War in the German Army. From 1917 until 1920, he studied mechanical engineering in Eisenach.

== Invention of the chainsaw ==
In 1923, together with his friend Carl Hohl, he founded an engineering firm in Stuttgart, which was dissolved in 1926. Stihl founded a new company, for steam boiler pre-firing systems, in the same year. 

He also patented the &quot;Cutoff Chainsaw for Electric Power&quot; in 1926, which weighed a hefty 64 kilograms and had a one-inch gauge chain with handles at either end. Due to its bulk, it required two people to operate. It was, however, the first electric chainsaw worldwide. In 1929, Stihl built a petrol powered chainsaw, named the &quot;tree-felling machine&quot;, two years after fellow German Emil Lerp had built the first one worldwide. The following year, Stihl created the first ever chainsaw that could be operated by only one person. The company continued to grow and in 1931 it became the first European company to export chainsaws to the United States and the Soviet Union. Stihl has been the biggest chainsaw manufacturing company in the world since 1971. 

== Nazi Party membership ==
Stihl was a member of the Nazi Party from 1933 and of the Allgemeine SS from 1935. He was not called for military service during the war, and instead ran his company as the &quot;A. Stihl Maschinenfabrik&quot; in Bad Canstatt. After the factory was badly damaged in bombings in 1943-1944, it was moved to Neustadt (now Waiblingen). The company employed about 250 people in 1939, and during the war it also employed some number of slave labourers. At the end of the war he was arrested by Allied troops and his company was seized. After three years&#x27; detention, he was classified as a Mitläufer, released, and had his company returned.

== Personal life ==
In 1929, Andreas Stihl married Mia Giersch (1903-2002), with whom he had four children, among them Hans Peter Stihl (born 1932) and Eva Mayr-Stihl (born 1935), who succeeded her father in managing the company and remaining Vorstand until 2002. Stihl divorced his first wife in 1960, and married Hannelore Wegener-Doberg (1927-2009) the same year.

<text>900 North Michigan is a skyscraper in Chicago, Illinois, U.S., completed in 1989. At 871 feet (265 m) tall, it is the eleventh tallest building in Chicago and the 59th-tallest in the United States. It was developed by Urban Retail Properties in 1988 as an upscale sister to Water Tower Place, one block southeast, and was the second vertical mall built along the Magnificent Mile.

The building features a large, upscale shopping mall called 900 North Michigan Shops. Bloomingdale&#x27;s occupies the rear of its wide, six-story atrium, with other luxury shops and restaurants filling the remaining spaces. For this reason, it is commonly referred to as the &quot;Bloomingdale&#x27;s Building&quot;. The mall opened with Henri Bendel as a &quot;junior anchor,&quot; since closed. The layout of the retail area reflects lessons learned from Water Tower Place; the anchor&#x27;s placement at the rear draws shoppers through the space and creates leasable space with valuable Michigan Avenue frontage, while the arrangement of escalators in parallel, rather than in zig-zags, directs foot traffic past more shops.

Offices originally occupied floors 8–28, but floors 21–28 were converted to condo units in 2007, leaving offices on floors 8–20. The luxurious Four Seasons Hotel occupies the middle floors (30–46) of the tower. Floors 48–66 are part of the 132 East Delaware Residences, these 106 condominiums were part of the original building plan. A large 12-story parking garage, with retail on the ground level and a medical clinic atop, occupies the rear half of the block, facing Rush Street.

The exterior of the tower is clad in limestone and green glass which reflects the light. The building has a steel skeleton on which a concrete frame was erected for the upper floors. Because the building materials changed, cranes used to work on the lower floors could not be used for the concrete portion and new cranes had to be erected to complete the building. Four lit &quot;lanterns&quot; atop the structure give it a distinctive skyline presence. They change colors for the Christmas season.

<doc id="1012508" wikidata="Q1798652" url="?curid=1012508" title="Tuborg Brewery">
<text>Tuborg is a Danish brewing company founded in 1873 on a harbour in Hellerup, to the north of Copenhagen, Denmark. Since 1970 it has been part of the Carlsberg Group. The brewery&#x27;s flagship, the Tuborg pilsner, was brewed for the first time in 1880.

== History ==

The name &quot;Tuborg&quot; comes from &quot;Thuesborg&quot; (&quot;Thue&#x27;s castle&quot;), a Copenhagen inn from the 1690s situated in the area of the brewery. This evolved and was adopted into local placenames, such as &quot;Lille Tuborg&quot; and &quot;Store Tuborg&quot;. &quot;Tuborgvej&quot; in Copenhagen is named after the site of the original Tuborg brewery.



Philip Heyman (5 November 1837 – 15 December 1893) was a Danish-Jewish industrialist who co-founded in 1873 the Tuborg Brewery, together with C. F. Tietgen, Gustav Brock [da] and Rudolph Puggaard. After Heyman&#x27;s death, the Tuborg Brewery merged with &quot;De Forenede Bryggerier&quot; in 1894, which through this way entered into a profit-sharing agreement with Carlsberg in 1903. Benny Desau, Heyman&#x27;s son-in-law, was a director of De Forenede Bryggerier, followed by his son Einar Dessau in 1919.



During the Occupation, because of his Jewish background, Einar Dessau had to flee to Sweden in November 1943, where he joined the resistance work. After the war, he resumed his position at Tuborg.

In the last year of the war, Tuborg&#x27;s boiler house was destroyed on the 5 January, or schalburgtage, but beer deliveries could still be continued the next day thanks to outside help.
==Marketing==
===Advertisement===

In 1990 Tuborg launched their annual Christmas brew on the second Wednesday in November, with the marketing term &quot;J-day&quot;; &quot;snestorm&quot; (blizzard) and &quot;snefald&quot; (snowfall) are also used. &#x27;J&#x27; stands for Jul (Christmas) or julebryg (Christmas brew). Similarly, there is a P-day for påskebryg (Easter brew). In 1999, J-day moved to the first Friday in November. Traffic police laid out an alcohol control plan for that evening. In 2009 J-day was moved again to the last Friday in October, but in 2010 it returned to the first Friday in November.

In 2022, Tuborg collaborated with Chinese rappers in a project called &quot;Why Not!&quot;.

===Sponsorships===
In 2008, Tuborg announced a sponsorship deal with Reading and Leeds music festivals to become their exclusive Official Beer Partner, a position held in previous years by Carling. In 2009, it also arranged an exclusive deal with The Download festival to be the official beer and have a dedicated stage named after the beer.

Tuborg also sponsors the Tuborg Image Awards, an annual music award presentation that takes place in Nepal.

<doc id="1012509" wikidata="Q3725286" url="?curid=1012509" title="N-Methyl-N-ethyltryptamine">
<text>&quot;N&quot;-Methyl-&quot;N&quot;-ethyltryptamine (MET) is a serotonergic psychedelic of the tryptamine family. It is closely related to dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and to diethyltryptamine (DET). The drug acts as an agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2 receptors and to a lesser extent as a serotonin releasing agent.

MET has been briefly mentioned in Alexander Shulgin&#x27;s &quot;TiHKAL&quot; (&quot;Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved&quot;) and other publications, where he has stated it to be orally active as a psychedelic at doses of 80 to 100mg. The freebase of MET is active as a psychedelic via vaporization at a dose of 15mg per a 2011 Erowid trip report. The drug was encountered as a novel designer drug in Europe in 2014.

==Pharmacology==
MET is a serotonin 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptor partial agonist. It shows very weak activity as an agonist of the serotonin 5-HT1A and 5-HT2B receptors. In addition to acting at the serotonin 5-HT2 receptors, MET is a serotonin releasing agent with lower potency. It produces the head-twitch response, a behavioral proxy of psychedelic effects, in animals.

==Chemistry==
MET, also known as &quot;N&quot;-methyl&quot;-N&quot;-ethyltryptamine, is a substituted tryptamine derivative. It is closely related to &quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and to other &quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-dialkylated tryptamines.

Analogues of MET besides DMT include DET, DPT, DiPT, DBT, MiPT, MBT, EPT, EiPT, and PiPT, among others. Derivatives of MET include 4-HO-MET, 5-MeO-MET, 5-fluoro-MET, and 7-F-5-MeO-MET.

The lysergamide counterpart of MET is ETH-LAD, an analogue of LSD that was first developed and characterized by Alexander Shulgin.

==History==
MET appears to have first been described in the literature by 1981. It was specifically mentioned in Michael Valentine Smith&#x27;s &quot;Psychedelic Chemistry&quot;. Subsequently, MET was briefly described in Alexander Shulgin&#x27;s &quot;TiHKAL&quot; (&quot;Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved&quot;) in 1997. MET was encountered as a novel designer drug in Europe in 2014.

<text>Chase Tower, located in the Chicago Loop area of Chicago, in the U.S. state of Illinois at 10 South Dearborn Street, is a 60-story skyscraper completed in 1969. At 850 feet (259 m) tall, it is the fourteenth-tallest building in Chicago and the tallest building inside the Chicago &#x27;L&#x27; Loop elevated tracks, and, as of May 2022, the 66th-tallest in the United States. JPMorgan Chase has its U.S. and Canada commercial and retail banking headquarters here. The building is also the headquarters of Exelon.
The building and its plaza (known as Exelon Plaza) occupy the entire block bounded by Clark, Dearborn, Madison, and Monroe streets.

==History==
Before the building was constructed, the Morrison Hotel, on its former site, was demolished in 1965. The building first opened in 1969 as First National Plaza. When constructed, it was the headquarters of First Chicago Corporation. In 1998, it became the headquarters for Bank One Corporation, and accordingly it was renamed Bank One Tower, The current name dates from October 24, 2005, one year after Bank One merged with Chase. Chase&#x27;s retail bank division is based in the tower.

For a time the National Public Radio show &quot;Wait Wait... Don&#x27;t Tell Me!&quot; was taped on Thursday nights before a live audience at the Chase Auditorium under the plaza. In 2022 the show permanently moved to the Fine Arts Building.

==Design and features==
Design architects for the construction were C.F. Murphy Associates, Stanislaw Z. Gladych and Perkins and Will. Chase Tower is known for both its distinctive curving shape and its vibrant public space: a deep sunken plaza at the geographic center of the Chicago Loop, complete with a jet fountain and Marc Chagall&#x27;s ceramic wall mural &quot;Four Seasons&quot;.

The ground floor is home to the largest Chase Bank branch in Chicago with 22 ATMs.

<doc id="1012518" wikidata="Q615980" url="?curid=1012518" title="Parishes of the Church of Sweden">
<text>The Parishes of the Church of Sweden () are subdivisions within the Church of Sweden that historically were called &quot;socken&quot; but nowadays are called &quot;församling&quot;. Similar units were used for municipal (&quot;landskommun&quot;) and cadastral purposes (&quot;jordebokssocknar&quot; or &quot;jordregistersocknar&quot;) until the 20th century.

After the Protestant Reformation in the 16th century the church also became a state church and as such was charged with administrative tasks like as keeping the civic registry. Parishes were also used as cadastral units (&quot;jordebokssocknar&quot;, later &quot;jordregistersocknar&quot;), sometimes with slightly different borders. Eventually religious and civil matters became separated in two entities within the same district (in 1863), the religious congregation (&quot;församling&quot;) and the civil parish or rural municipality (&quot;landskommun&quot;). The civil parish handled municipal tasks, but the congregation still retained a significant share of influence, including responsibility for schools. The civil parishes were merged to larger municipalities, in most cases in 1952. Some civil parishes remained as separate municipalities until the mergers of 1967–1974 and in a few cases even after that. The cadastral parishes remained until a reform between 1976 and 1995, where they were replaced by the municipalities.

On 1 July 1991, the Swedish Tax Agency took over the remaining duties related to the population register from the parishes.

The Church of Sweden was separated from the Swedish state on 1 January 2000, but its parishes are still used in official statistics. The parishes have seen major geographical changes since that date, so records are kept for both parishes as of 2000 and parishes as of today. However, this ended on 1 January 2016 when Sweden introduced secular registration districts instead.

<text>Park Tower is a skyscraper located at 800 North Michigan Avenue in Chicago, Illinois. Completed in 2000 and standing at tall with 70 floors — 67 floors for practical use, it is the twelfth-tallest building in Chicago, the 43rd-tallest building in the United States, and the 83rd-tallest in the world by architectural detail. It is one of the world&#x27;s tallest buildings to be clad with architectural precast concrete (the Transamerica Pyramid Building in San Francisco is taller). It is one of the tallest non-steel framed structures in the world—it is a cast-in-place concrete framed structure. This building was originally intended to be tall. But later, the ceiling heights were increased allowing it to reach .

The building occupies a footprint of . Because of the small footprint and the fact that it is a non-steel-framed concrete building, this is the first building in the US to be designed with a tuned mass damper from the outset. While other skyscrapers in America have anti-sway systems, they were always added later. A tuned mass damper counteracts wind effects on the structure. (The 300-ton damper is a massive steel pendulum hung from four cables inside a square cage.) Because of its massive weight, the damper has inertia that helps stabilize the building from swaying in the wind.

Designed by Chicago architectural firm Lucien Lagrange Architects, Park Tower is a mixed-use tower. As the name suggests, the lower portion holds a Park Hyatt Hotel, while the upper levels contain luxury condominiums.

The building contains of hotel space (202 rooms), of residential space, of retail, and of parking. Levels 9, 19, and the crown are mechanical areas. Floors 2 to 18 are hotel spaces, Floors 20 to 55 are residential apartments and Floors 56 to 70 are private condominiums. Located at the northern edge of the Magnificent Mile, Park Tower is home to the restaurant NoMi.

===Alger===
===Monsieur d&#x27;Alger: The Executioners of the French Republic===
In 1870 the Republic of France abolished all local executioners and named the executioner of Algiers, Antoine Rasseneux, Éxécuteur des Arrêts Criminels en Algérie, which became France&#x27;s official description of the executioner of Algeria&#x27;s occupation. From then on there would be one only executioner to carry out death sentences for all of Algeria. Since the colony&#x27;s executioner was required to live in Algiers, people soon started to refer to him as &quot;Le Monsieur d&#x27;Alger&quot; (&quot;The Man From Algiers&quot;). Upon his nomination, Rasseneux was permitted to choose four among France&#x27;s and Algeria&#x27;s former local executioners to be his aides.

==Brazil==
After 1808, during the Portuguese-Brazilian Kingdom (1808–1822) and the Empire (1822–1889), when Brazil&#x27;s States were still called &quot;Provinces&quot; and the currency was called &quot;Reis&quot;, Brazil had factually abolished torture but was a busy death penalty country.
Method of execution was public hanging by an ultra-short drop of approximately 90 cm (2&#x27; 9 11/2&quot;), with the executioner, after having activated the trap door or pushed the convict, according to the gallows&#x27;s structure, climbed a ladder and launched himself rope downwards, hitting on the convict&#x27;s shoulders with his weight.
Executioners generally were selected among convicts of capital crimes who had their death sentences stayed for indefinite terms or even commuted for life without parole, and who in exchange for their stays or commutations had to carry out the executions ordered by law. Executioners were, whenever possible, selected from among slaves convicted for a capital crime. And except for the province of Rio Grande do Norte, executioners had obligatorily to be of African descent.
As stayed or commuted convicts, executioners consequently lived as inmates in the prisons of the respective towns where they were based. When an execution was to be carried out elsewhere in his area, the executioner would be transported to the place of execution in chains and sleep in the local prison; after an attempt of murder against Fortunato José in 1834, prisons started separating the executioners from other inmates. 
In the province of Rio Grande do Norte, the executioner had always to be the convict scheduled to die next after an execution, so that province&#x27;s last execution had to be carried out by a firing squad, after the necessary emergency change of execution protocol.
In the state of Rio de Janeiro, after Independence September 7, 1822 there were also free executioners of African descent who having to travel around, were reached by couriers with execution orders.
Executioners, also when slaves, were paid for their executions; at the example of the province of Minas Gerais, we can establish payment was between 4$000 and 12$000 (4 Mil-Reis to 12 Mil-Reis) per execution.
The last execution of a free convict in Brazil was that of José Pereira de Sousa October 30, 1861 in Santa Luzia (nowadays Luziânia), GO. The last execution at all under law in Brazil was that of the slave Francisco April 28, 1876 in Pilar, AL.
Brazil abolished capital punishment officially with the Proclamation of the Republic November 15, 1889, and by law with its first Republican Constitution of 1891 and Penal Code of September 22, 1892.

===Monsieur de Paris: The Executioners of the French Republic===
In 1870 the Republic of France abolished all local executioners and named the executioner of Paris, Jean-François Heidenreich, &quot;Exécuteur des Arrêts Criminels&quot;, which became France&#x27;s official description of the executioner&#x27;s occupation. From then on there would be only one executioner to carry out death sentences for all of France except Corsica which would follow in 1875. As the Republic&#x27;s executioner was required to live in Paris, people soon started to refer to him as &quot;Monsieur de Paris&quot;, &quot;The Mister from Paris&quot;. At the occasion of his nomination, Heidenreich could choose four among France&#x27;s former local executioners to be his aides.

<doc id="1012542" wikidata="Q5316176" url="?curid=1012542" title="Duran Duran (1983 video)">
<text>Duran Duran is a video compilation, by the band of the same name, that is sometimes unofficially referred to in print as the &quot;Duran Duran video album&quot; or &quot;Duran Duran: The First 11 Videos&quot;. The pioneering video album won a 1984 Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (&quot;Billboard&quot; magazine for the week ending 24 November 1984).

==Background==
The planning for the &quot;video album&quot; had begun early in the band&#x27;s career, as Duran Duran and their management realised the power of video as an artistic marketing tool. Some of the videos shot during this period (1981–1983) were for songs never released as singles, including &quot;Lonely in your Nightmare&quot;, &quot;Night Boat&quot; and &quot;The Chauffeur&quot;.

The release date, March 1983, was chosen to coincide with the promotion of the band&#x27;s No. 1 single &quot;Is There Something I Should Know?&quot; and the American re-issue of their first album, &quot;Duran Duran&quot;.

Future filmmaker Russell Mulcahy directed the majority of this &quot;travelogue-style&quot; collection of videos, featuring exotic locations and cinematic style that made Duran Duran&#x27;s name as a video band. Videos for tracks such as &quot;Hungry Like the Wolf&quot; and &quot;Save a Prayer&quot; were showpieces of this style.

Prior to the video album&#x27;s release, the &quot;video EP&quot; &quot;Duran Duran Video 45&quot; came out in two versions. The first one had the &quot;clean&quot; or &quot;day version&quot; of &quot;Girls on Film&quot; alongside &quot;Hungry Like The Wolf&quot;, while the other had the uncensored &quot;night versions&quot; of each.

In February 1984, the video album &quot;Duran Duran&quot; won a Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video, while &quot;Video 45&quot; won the Best Short Form award.

The collection was originally released with stereophonic sound on LaserDisc (the original optical disc format) and Capacitance Electronic Disc formats, as well as in the Beta Hi-Fi and VHS Hi-Fi videotape formats. It has yet to be released on DVD, although &quot;Sing Blue Silver&quot;, Duran Duran&#x27;s 1984 tour documentary, and &quot;Arena&quot;, a 1985 long-form music video/concert film, both have been.

==The videos==

===&quot;Rio&quot; (Russell Mulcahy)===
Duran Duran travelled to the island of Antigua in May 1982 to film the music video for &quot;Rio&quot;, which featured iconic images of the band in colourful Antony Price silk suits, singing and playing around on a yacht sailing the Caribbean. Short segments show band members trying to live out their assorted daydreams, only to be teased, tormented, and made fools of by a body-painted vixen.

===&quot;Planet Earth&quot; (Russell Mulcahy)===
Fairly primitive by the band&#x27;s later standards, the video was shot on a sound stage at St John&#x27;s Wood and features the band (dressed in New Romantic fashions) playing the song on a white stage tricked out with special effects to look like a platform made of ice or crystal. Interspersed with the performance are shots of the band members alongside the four elements. The video focused closely on the band members&#x27; faces, highlighting their varied good looks. The instrumental middle section features friends of the band from the Rum Runner nightclub, dancing in outlandish outfits. At the end of the video, singer Simon Le Bon leaps from the stage, caught in a freeze frame shot above an apparently bottomless abyss.

===&quot;Lonely in Your Nightmare&quot; (Russell Mulcahy)===
The video begins with Le Bon finding an old photograph of the aforementioned freeze-frame closing of the &quot;Planet Earth&quot; video on the floor of an abandoned building in London. The scene segues into a lovely yet melancholy album track containing a series of colour sections, in which a beautiful woman in a flowing dress wanders about the tropical settings of Sri Lanka, drawing the attention of various band members. Many of the scenes are shot across the Unawatuna Bay from Galle Fort, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and of the mansion at Taprobane Island further along the southeast coast. 
The elusive woman appears again in black-and-white scenes filmed in London, disappearing whenever the band members turn to look for her. The music for the video is the David Kershenbaum re-mix of the studio track, which contains an alternate chorus lyric in the closing section of the song.

===&quot;Careless Memories&quot; (Perry Haines)===
The video was filmed in a decorated flat and on the streets around London&#x27;s Soho. The band members talk and laugh while Le Bon sings savagely to the camera. The video was re-edited for the video album, with some scenes replaced.

===&quot;My Own Way&quot; (Russell Mulcahy)===
The video was filmed in a St. Johns Wood studio that was decorated entirely in red, black and white. The band performs the fast-paced song in close-up, while flamenco dancers twirl in the background and a colourful parrot sits on the synthesisers, pecking at the keyboardist&#x27;s fingers.

===&quot;Hungry Like the Wolf&quot; (Russell Mulcahy)===
The lush and cinematic video filmed in Sri Lanka was filled with shots of jungles, rivers, elephants, cafes and marketplaces evoking the exotic atmosphere of swashbuckler adventure films like &quot;Gunga Din&quot; and &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;. The storyline reflects the lyrics &quot;I&#x27;m on the hunt, I&#x27;m after you,&quot; with Le Bon pursuing a tiger-like woman through obstacles in the jungle, culminating in a final chase and struggle in a clearing. In the meantime, other band members hunt for Le Bon. One shot of Le Bon&#x27;s head rising out of the water in slow motion (it was actually filmed backwards) is an homage to an identical shot in &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;. Scenes were shot at the night markets of the capital city of Colombo, the Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage and Yala National Park, home to much of Sri Lanka&#x27;s leopard population, as reflected in the leopard-woman depicted in the video. The imagery itself is a reference to an ancient Sri Lankan legend of a demonic figure, appearing as a female leopard bent on seducing men and subsequently devouring them. A contemporary reference to this legend can be found in Sri Lankan-born author Christopher Ondaatje&#x27;s book &quot;The Last Colonial&quot;. Contrary to the track&#x27;s title, there are no wolves in Sri Lanka.

===&quot;Night Boat&quot; (Russell Mulcahy)===
The video for the atmospheric track became a mini-horror film shot on the Caribbean island of Antigua. Brief dialogue before the music starts includes Le Bon&#x27;s recitation of one of Mercutio&#x27;s speeches from &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. Band members gather in a small beach village as the sun sets, only to be separated and set upon by zombies one by one, until the ragged night boat arrives to carry Le Bon away. It is possible that this video is a homage to the Italian horror film &quot;Zombi 2&quot;, with settings and zombies that look very much like those in the film. This video was filmed in May 1982, a year before Michael Jackson began working on the video &quot;Thriller&quot;, which also featured zombies.

===&quot;Girls on Film&quot; (Godley &amp; Creme)===
The hit single was accompanied by an audacious video filmed at Shepperton Studios in July 1981. The 1983 video album contains the uncensored full-length &quot;night version&quot;, which is over six minutes in length. The band performs on an elevated stage behind a model&#x27;s catwalk, which resembles a boxing ring, as various scantily clad women act out a series of erotic vignettes. A number of these scenarios feature mild depictions of BDSM and lesbian fetishes as well as a recurring theme of seduction and abandonment:

* Two models in sheer black camisoles and knickers mount the catwalk carrying pillows. They bestride a feather-covered phallic pole at either end and move toward the center, sliding their crotches along the horizontal candy-striped shaft in a slow and suggestive manner. They then engage in a spirited pillow fight that dislodges one of their camisole spaghetti straps to reveal a wayward nude breast. Afterward, they kiss and return to their dressing room and pour champagne on each other&#x27;s cleavage.
* The next scene seems a kinky variation on David and Goliath: a lean, supple, petite female sumo wrestler with her hair flared up in a tall tophawk ponytail (the last detail is probably meant to evoke the traditional &quot;chonmage&quot; topknot required of Japanese sumo wrestlers) mounts the catwalk to confront a stereotypically large, lumbering, heavyset male sumo wrestler. Her clinging wet top emphasises her ample breasts and nipples, while a closeup from behind of her &quot;mawashi&quot; loincloth affords a fetishistic view of her firm and shapely bare buttocks. In the confrontational &quot;tachi-ai&quot; stance, she seizes her opponent by the shoulder and flips him forward head-over-heels. He somersaults and lands on his backside with a resounding thud and she gives the ceremonial &quot;rei&quot; salutation (i.e., a bow) and walks away victorious.
* A masseuse in a white nurse&#x27;s uniform with white garter suspenders and sheer white stockings administers a full-body hot-oil massage to the humiliated male sumo wrestler on a steam-bath table.
* A sexy blonde in a cowgirl costume &quot;rides&quot; on the back of a muscular G-string-wearing black male model who is fetishistically costumed as an equine. She later soaps his undulating semi-nude body with a wet sponge and then leads him on a leash while he cavorts behind her.
* A model wearing a one-piece swimsuit and high-heels struts and poses on the catwalk before falling backwards into a child&#x27;s inflatable plastic paddling pool and collapsing. She is &quot;rescued&quot; and revived by a handsome male lifeguard. (It has often been erroneously stated that the lifeguard was played by Le Bon, when in fact it was an uncredited model.) She responds by embracing and kissing the lifeguard so intensely that he becomes unconscious from exhaustion and is left lying in the pool while she walks away. The model is later seen reclining on a chair completely nude, drying herself with an electric blow dryer before rubbing ice cubes on her nipples closeup.
* A brunette model removes her fur coat to reveal her breasts and skintight see-through plastic knickers underneath. She mud-wrestles with a blonde wearing a one-piece swimsuit. The blonde is defeated and left to wallow in the mud, while the triumphant brunette is attended by an obliging male assistant who proceeds to spray the mud off her nude body with a water hose.

===&quot;Save a Prayer&quot; (Russell Mulcahy)===
&quot;Save a Prayer&quot; was also filmed among the jungles, beaches, and temples of Sri Lanka. Band members sing the song while interacting with the Sri Lankan people around their tents and fishing boats on the beach, much of which is shot at Unawatuna and Talpe, on the south coast. Le Bon slow dances with, and attempts to woo, a beautiful woman who eventually leaves him. Scenes of band members atop the rock fortress of Sigiriya and among the ruins of a Buddhist temple at Polonnaruwa are intercut with images of the island and its people. The band made the ascent to the top of Sigiriya by helicopter. The fishing boats depicted are still used today, and the general scenery of the Unawatuna beach areas remains much as it did when the video first aired.

===&quot;The Chauffeur&quot; (Ian Emes)===
This video is the only one on the album in which the band do not appear at all. It was filmed around Notting Hill during the autumn of 1982, while the band was away on tour. A moody, elegant black-and-white piece inspired by the fetishistic imagery of Helmut Newton, the production was entirely conceived, designed, photographed and edited by renowned British animation director Ian Emes. The video is a fantasy of two mysterious, hauntingly beautiful women who are seen ritualistically dressing themselves in elaborate lingerie before travelling separately through the dark streets and tunnels of London to meet in a vacant underground car park for an exotic lesbian encounter. The song&#x27;s dramatic instrumental finale was accompanied by a topless Perri Lister as the female chauffeur performing a sensuous dance – an homage to Charlotte Rampling&#x27;s &quot;Dance of the Seven Veils&quot; in Liliana Cavani&#x27;s 1974 film &quot;The Night Porter&quot;.

===&quot;Is There Something I Should Know?&quot; (Russell Mulcahy)===
The much-played video features colour clips of the band members in blue shirts with tucked-in white ties, interspersed with surreal black-and-white images of bowler-hatted men inspired by Magritte&#x27;s paintings. The video, which is longer than the studio track, also includes brief clips from several of the other videos in this collection.

<text>In general relativity, Regge calculus is a formalism for producing simplicial approximations of spacetimes that are solutions to the Einstein field equation. The calculus was introduced by the Italian theoretician Tullio Regge in 1961.

==Overview==
The starting point for Regge&#x27;s work is the fact that every four dimensional time orientable Lorentzian manifold admits a triangulation into simplices. Furthermore, the spacetime curvature can be expressed in terms of deficit angles associated with &quot;2-faces&quot; where arrangements of &quot;4-simplices&quot; meet. These 2-faces play the same role as the vertices where arrangements of &quot;triangles&quot; meet in a triangulation of a &quot;2-manifold&quot;, which is easier to visualize. Here a vertex with a positive angular deficit represents a concentration of &quot;positive&quot; Gaussian curvature, whereas a vertex with a negative angular deficit represents a concentration of &quot;negative&quot; Gaussian curvature.

The deficit angles can be computed directly from the various edge lengths in the triangulation, which is equivalent to saying that the Riemann curvature tensor can be computed from the metric tensor of a Lorentzian manifold. Regge showed that the vacuum field equations can be reformulated as a restriction on these deficit angles. He then showed how this can be applied to evolve an initial spacelike hyperslice according to the vacuum field equation.

The result is that, starting with a triangulation of some spacelike hyperslice (which must itself satisfy a certain constraint equation), one can eventually obtain a simplicial approximation to a vacuum solution. This can be applied to difficult problems in numerical relativity such as simulating the collision of two black holes.

The elegant idea behind Regge calculus has motivated the construction of further generalizations of this idea. In particular, Regge calculus has been adapted to study quantum gravity.

<text>The Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) program is a postgraduate professional certification offered internationally by the US-based CFA Institute (formerly the Association for Investment Management and Research, or AIMR) to investment and financial professionals. The program teaches a wide range of subjects relating to advanced investment analysis—including business analysis, statistics, probability theory, fixed income, derivatives, economics, financial analysis, corporate finance, alternative investments, portfolio management, ethics applicable to the finance industry—and provides a generalist knowledge of other areas of finance.

A candidate who successfully completes the program and meets other professional requirements is awarded the &quot;CFA charter&quot; and becomes a &quot;CFA charter-holder&quot;. As of November 2022, at least 190,000 people are charter-holders globally, growing 6% annually since 2012 (including the effects of the pandemic). Successful candidates take an average of four years to earn their CFA charter.

The top employers of CFA charter-holders globally include UBS, JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Canada, Bank of America, and Morgan Stanley.

==History==
The predecessor of the CFA Institute, the Financial Analysts Federation (FAF), was established in 1947 as a service organization for investment professionals. The FAF founded the Institute of Chartered Financial Analysts in 1962; the earliest CFA charter-holders were &quot;grandfathered&quot; in through work experience only, but then a series of three examinations was established along with a requirement to be a practitioner for several years before taking the exams. In 1990, in the hopes of boosting the credential&#x27;s public profile, the CFA Institute (formerly the Association for Investment Management and Research) merged with the FAF and the Institute of Chartered Financial Analysts.

The CFA exam was first administered in 1963 and began in the United States and Canada, but has become global with many people becoming charter-holders across Europe, Asia, and Australia. By 2003, fewer than half the candidates in the CFA program were based in the United States and Canada, with most of the other candidates based in Asia or Europe. The number of charter-holders in India and China had increased by 25% and 53%, respectively, from 2005 to 2006.

== CFA Charter ==
The CFA designation is designed to demonstrate a strong foundation in advanced investment analysis and portfolio management, accompanied by a strict emphasis on ethical practice.

A charter holder is held to the highest ethical standards. Once an investment professional obtains the charter, this individual also makes an annual commitment to uphold and abide by a strict professional code of conduct and ethical standards. Violations of the CFA code of ethics may result in industry-related sanctions, suspension of the right to use the CFA designation, or a revocation of membership.

===Requirements===
To become a CFA charter-holder, candidates must satisfy the following requirements:
* Have obtained a bachelor&#x27;s (or equivalent) degree or be in the final year of a bachelor&#x27;s degree program. However, an accredited degree may not always be a requirement.
* Pass all three levels of the CFA program (mastery of the current CFA curriculum and passing three examinations).
* Have 4,000 hours in a minimum of three years of qualified work experience acceptable by the CFA Institute. However, individual-level exams may be taken prior to satisfying this requirement.
* Have two or three letters of reference.
* Become a member of the CFA Institute.
* Adhere to the CFA Institute Code of Ethics and Standards of Professional Conduct.

Due to the timing of the exams, completing all three levels of the CFA is possible within two years, but candidates must still complete the work experience requirement of 4,000 hours over a minimum of three years to become a charter-holder.

=== Pass rates ===
The CFA exams are notoriously difficult, with low pass rates. During the period 2010–2021, pass rates for Levels 1-3 ranged from 22-56%. The CFA Level 1 examination in May 2021 and July 2021 made news headlines after plummeting to a record-low pass rate of 25% and 22%, respectively, and in August 2021, the level 2 pass rate fell to 29%.

==Curriculum==

The curriculum for the CFA program is based on a Candidate Body of Knowledge established by the CFA Institute. The CFA curriculum is updated annually to reflect the latest best practices, with the extent of changes varying by year and level. The curriculum comprises, broadly, the topic areas below. There are three exams (&quot;levels&quot;) that test the academic portion of the CFA program. All three levels emphasize the subject of ethics. The material differences among the exams are:
* The Level I study program emphasizes tools and inputs and includes an introduction to asset valuation, financial reporting and analysis, and portfolio-management techniques.
* The Level II study program emphasizes asset valuation and includes applications of the tools and inputs (including economics, financial reporting and analysis, and quantitative methods) in asset valuation.
* The Level III study program emphasizes portfolio management and includes descriptions of strategies for applying the tools, inputs, and asset valuation models to manage equity, fixed income, and derivative investments for individuals and institutions.

For exams from 2008 onward, candidates are automatically provided the curriculum readings from the CFA Institute at the time of registration for the exam. The curriculum is not provided separately in the absence of exam registration. If the student fails an exam and is allowed to retest in the same year, the CFA Institute offers a slight rebate and will not send the curriculum again (the curriculum changes only on an annual basis). If the student retests in a year other than the year of failure, he or she will receive the curriculum again, as it may have been changed. Study materials for the CFA exams are available from numerous commercial learning providers, although they are not officially endorsed. Various organizations (some officially accredited) also provide course-based preparation.
As of 2019, the examination includes questions on artificial intelligence, automated investment services, and mining unconventional sources of data.

===Ethical and professional standards===

The ethics section is primarily concerned with compliance and reporting rules when managing an investor&#x27;s money or when issuing research reports. Some rules pertain more generally to professional behavior (such as prohibitions against plagiarism); others specifically relate to the proper use of the designation for charter-holders and candidates. These rules are delineated in the &quot;Standards of Professional Conduct&quot;, within the context of an overarching &quot;Code of Ethics&quot;.

===Quantitative methods===
This topic area is dominated by statistics: the topics are fairly broad, covering probability theory, hypothesis testing, (multi-variate) regression, and time-series analysis. Other topics include time value of money—incorporating basic valuation and yield and return calculations—portfolio-related calculations, and technical analysis.
Recent additions, as mentioned above, are a survey of machine learning and big data.

===Economics===
Both microeconomics and macroeconomics are covered, including international economics (mainly related to currency conversions and how they are affected by international interest rates and inflation). By Level III, the focus is on applying economic analysis to portfolio management and asset allocation.

===Financial statement analysis===
The curriculum includes financial reporting topics (International Financial Reporting Standards and U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles), and ratio and financial statement analysis. Financial reporting and analysis of accounting information is heavily tested at Levels I and II, but is not a significant part of Level III.

===Corporate finance===
The curriculum initially covers the major corporate finance topics: capital investment decisions, capital structure policy and implementation, and dividend policy; this builds on the accounting, economics, and statistics areas. It then extends to more advanced topics such as the analysis of mergers and acquisitions, corporate governance, and business and financial risk.

===Security analysis===
The curriculum includes coverage of global markets as well as analysis and valuation of the various asset types: equity (stocks), fixed income (bonds), derivatives (futures, forwards, options, and swaps), and alternative investments (real estate, private equity, hedge funds, and commodities). The Level I exam requires familiarity with these instruments. Level II focuses on valuation, employing the &quot;tools&quot; studied under quantitative methods, financial statement analysis, corporate finance, and economics. Level III centers on incorporating these instruments into portfolios.

===Equity and fixed income===
The curriculum for equity investments includes the functioning of the stock market, indices, stock valuation, and industry analysis.
Fixed income topics similarly include the various debt securities, the risk associated with these, and valuations and yield spreads.

===Derivatives===
The curriculum includes coverage of the fundamental framework of derivatives markets, derivatives valuations, and hedging and trading strategies involving derivatives, including futures, forwards, swaps, and options. The curriculum incorporates various pricing models and frameworks, such as Black-Scholes and binomial option pricing (extending to coverage of interest rate trees), while coverage of the underlying mathematics is conceptual as opposed to technical.

===Alternative investments===
The curriculum includes coverage of a range of topics in the alternative investment category. Topics include hedge funds, private equity, real estate, natural resources (particularly precious metals), infrastructure, and other alternative investments, including, as applicable, strategies, sub-categories, potential benefits and risks, fee structures, and due diligence.

===Portfolio management and wealth planning===
This section increases in importance with each of the three levels—it integrates and draws from the other topics, including ethics.
It includes:
(i) modern portfolio theory (efficient frontier, capital asset pricing model, etc.);
(ii) investment practice (defining the investment policy for individual and institutional investors, resultant asset allocation, order execution, and hedging using derivatives);
and (iii) measurement of investment performance.

== Efficacy of the CFA program ==
Given the time and effort that candidates must undergo to complete the CFA program, it would be expected that CFA charter-holders have higher performance than those who do not complete the program. There exist some academic research, which suggest evidence that differential analyst performance is economically significant, supporting the predominance of signaling; furthermore research in the &quot;Financial Analysts Journal&quot; (a journal published by CFA Institute) suggests a positive human capital impact from the CFA program.

== Global regulatory and legal recognition ==

===India===
CFA Institute is not affiliated with the &quot;Chartered Financial Analyst&quot; degree offered by the Institute of Chartered Financial Analysts of India (ICFAI) University of India or its affiliate, the Council of Chartered Financial Analysts (CCFA).

In 1998, CFA Institute&#x27;s predecessor organization, AIMR, sued and won a judgment in an American court against ICFAI/CCFA. The judgment prohibited ICFAI/CCFA and its members from using the CFA or Chartered Financial Analyst mark in the United States and Canada. In August 2006, an Indian court issued a temporary injunction against the Indian entity, as well.

The judgments made no assessment of the quality of the Indian program and merely discussed the trademark violation. The Indian Association of Investment Professionals is the only organization in India that is affiliated with the CFA Institute. The CFA Institute&#x27;s trademark rights to the &quot;CFA&quot; and &quot;Chartered Financial Analyst&quot; brands were affirmed in India by the Delhi High Court. Further, the Delhi High Court issued an interim injunction ordering ICFAI and its affiliated Council of Chartered Financial Analysts to stop using CFA Institute trademarks. The Deputy Registrar of Trade Marks determined that the trademark registration issued to CFA Institute for the &quot;CFA&quot; brand must be republished because of an error by the Trade Marks Registry. CFA Institute has numerous trademark applications on file with the Trade Marks Registry, and CFA charterholders from CFA Institute are free to use the &quot;CFA&quot; and &quot;Chartered Financial Analyst&quot; marks throughout India.

On May 8, 2007, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia vacated a default judgment issued against ICFAI that CFA Institute obtained in October 1998. ICFAI had moved to reopen the case and to vacate the default judgment arguing that the court lacked jurisdiction over ICFAI at the time the default judgment was issued. With the default judgement vacated, ICFAI informed Indian CFA charter holders that they could legally use their charter in the United States and Canada. However, on September 4, 2007, the court reversed its decision to vacate after a motion to reconsider that decision was filed by CFA Institute.

===United Kingdom===
In January 2007, the UK Trade Marks Registry refused to register &quot;Chartered Financial Analyst&quot; as a trademark, as the word &quot;chartered&quot; in the United Kingdom is associated with bodies incorporated by royal charter and thus &quot;the relevant public in the UK would, prima facie, expect a person using the mark applied for to be representing themselves as a member of an organization of the kind subject to a Royal Charter&quot;. &quot;CFA&quot; is a registered trademark in the UK, but only for &quot;Educational services&quot; (class 41) rather than &quot;Financial services&quot; (class 36) under which the attempt to register &quot;Chartered Financial Analyst&quot; had been made.

<text>The Tennessee Public Service Commission, also called Tennessee Railroad and Public Utilities Commission, was a three-member elected body which regulated private utilities, trucking firms, and railroads within the U.S. state of Tennessee. It was dissolved in 1996 when its functions were transferred to the Tennessee Regulatory Authority.

The body consisted of three commissioners, one from each of the state&#x27;s three &quot;Grand Divisions&quot; (East, Middle, and West Tennessee). While one member of the body was required to be from each Grand Division, each was elected on a statewide basis to staggered six-year terms, resulting in the election of one commissioner in each even-numbered year. This body was somewhat less powerful than some similar bodies in most other states in that, with the exception of the Kingsport area, it had no jurisdiction over electric rates since the vast majority of the state received its power from the Tennessee Valley Authority, which as part of the federal government was not subject to state regulation.

==History==
The Tennessee Public Service Commission originated in 1897 as an elected three-member state Railroad Commission, vested with the authority to investigate the rates and practices of railroads and to approve rail tariffs. In 1919 the Railroad Commission&#x27;s responsibilities were expanded to include the regulation of street railways and public utilities, and the Tennessee General Assembly changed the body&#x27;s name to the Railroad and Public Utilities Commission. Jurisdiction over motor carriers was added in 1933. With the creation of the Tennessee Valley Authority in the 1930s the commission lost its jurisdiction over electric utilities; street railways were removed from commission jurisdiction in 1943. The commission&#x27;s name was changed to the Public Service Commission in 1955.

Once the Tennessee Supreme Court was changed to being confirmed by a yes-no vote (the &quot;Modified Missouri Plan&quot; or &quot;Tennessee Plan&quot;) rather than being chosen by an actual election, the PSC members became the only government officials in Tennessee other than the governor who were elected statewide. During the entire life of the body, all of its members were Democrats. The process was tainted by allegations of corruption. The general public showed very little interest in the office, despite its potential for considerable impact on their daily lives, with total votes cast in races for the office often amounting only to two-thirds or less of the numbers cast for governor, senator, or President in the same election, and most people largely or entirely unaware of the duties and functions of the commission. Nearly all campaign donations came from the industries which were regulated by the PSC, their representatives, and persons involved with them. No one was ever elected to higher office from the Tennessee Public Service Commission, although such attempts were occasionally made, such as in 1994 when Frank Cockran and Steve Hewlett ran unsuccessfully in the Democratic Gubernatorial Primary.

Election-related scandals and charges of favoritism, together with the fact that no Republican was ever elected to the office of Public Service Commissioner, led the administration of Governor Don Sundquist to move to abolish the office in 1995. The Tennessee General Assembly acted that year to abolish the Public Service Commission, replacing it with the Tennessee Regulatory Authority, consisting of three members, with one member each appointed by the Governor, the Lieutenant Governor, and the Speaker of the Tennessee House of Representatives. The Public Service Commission ceased operation on June 30, 1996, and the Regulatory Authority began operation the following day.

<text>Keaveney is an Irish surname, which is an anglicized form of the Gaelic &quot;Ó Géibheannaigh&quot;, meaning &quot;descendant of Géibheannach&quot;. Géibheannach means &quot;fettered&quot;. Alternative spellings include Keaveny, Keveney, Keavney, and Kiveney. Related names include Caveney, Kaney, Kevan, Kevany, Kenney, Kenny, Geaveny, Geany, Guiney and O&#x27;Guiney.

==Background==
The &quot;O Geibheannaigh&quot; sept came from County Galway. A sept or clan was a collective term describing a group of persons whose immediate ancestors bore a common surname and inhabited the same territory. This was a sept of the Uí Mháine (or &quot;Hymany&quot;) descended from Geibhennach, son of Aedh, Chief of the Uí Mháine. Geibhennach was slain in battle in 971 at Keshcorran, County Sligo. 

The Uí Mháine chieftains ruled much of East Galway and South Roscommon. The Irish language meaning of Géibheannach is &quot;hostage&quot; or &quot;captive&quot; probably indicating that Aedh&#x27;s son had been taken hostage by enemies at an earlier stage.

<text>The British Rail Class 488 are unpowered trailer sets, converted from Mark 2F coaches for the &quot;Gatwick Express&quot; service from London Victoria to Gatwick Airport.

The sets were converted from conventional locomotive-hauled coaching stock in 1983–1984, and were used in combination with Class 73 electro-diesel locomotives and Class 489 luggage vans. Two variations were converted: 2-car sets (containing first class accommodation) and 3-car sets (containing standard class accommodation only). They are officially formed of two subclasses. The two-car units are classified as Class 488/2 and are numbered in the range 488201–488210 and the three-car sets are Class 488/3 and are numbered 488301–19.

==Operations==
After privatisation, the entire Class 488 fleet passed to the Gatwick Express franchise. One unit, 488301, was withdrawn before privatisation, following an accident at Battersea Park railway station in 1985.

===Gatwick Express===
Immediately after privatisation the Class 488 fleet was used exclusively on Gatwick Express trains. They were painted in the Gatwick Express variation of InterCity livery. Some sets were later reliveried with Continental Airlines advertisements, including units 488203/04/07/08/10, 488304/05/10/14/19.

From 2000 onwards, new trains in the form of Class 460 units were introduced to replace the old stock. By 2004 just six sets, formed into three 5-car rakes, were still in use with Gatwick Express. By January 2005 this had decreased to four sets. The sets were used sporadically during early 2005 but their use declined as the Class 460 reliability improved. Their final scheduled use was on 28 July following a special trip involving the two remaining Class 73 locomotives. They were replaced by two Class 458 units hired from South West Trains. They were used a few times after this date for emergency cover, but have now been withdrawn.

===Network Rail===
After retirement from Gatwick Express several sets were purchased by Network Rail for use as test trains or simply as brake-force runners. These sets have been repainted into either the now obsolete Railtrack blue/lime green livery or the new Network Rail yellow livery. Two sets, 8307 and 8309, have been reclassified as Class 910 departmental units and renumbered 910002 and 910001 respectively. In addition two coaches have been converted for departmental use with Network Rail:
*72503 (ex 488204) - converted to hot-box detection coach no. 977983
*72715 (ex 488316) - converted to structure-gauging train coach no. 977985

===Northern Ireland Railways===
In 2001 eight carriages were sold to Northern Ireland Railways for further use as locomotive-hauled stock in combination with the 111 Class locomotive, and renumbered 8941 to 8948.
*72605 (ex 488305) - renumbered 8943
*72609 (ex 488305) - renumbered 8944
*72626 (ex 488314) - renumbered 8945
*72627 (ex 488314) - renumbered 8946
*72634 (ex 488318) - renumbered 8941
*72637 (ex 488318) - renumbered 8942
*72646 (ex 488319) - renumbered 8947
*72647 (ex 488319) - renumbered 8948

The NIR coaches were withdrawn on 19 January 2005, but were re-introduced in September 2006 to provide extra capacity on the Portadown to Belfast Central service, making one trip every morning. (Coaches 943+944 did not re-enter service and were used for parts). In 2009 the locomotives and coaches were due to be converted to push-pull operation following the purchase by NIR of a DBSO last used by National Express East Anglia. However, this never happened and the entire fleet was withdrawn on 18 June 2009.

===Ministry of Defence===
*488210 has been sold to the Ministry of Defence for use at Marchwood Military Port in Hampshire. It has replaced two former Class 501 vehicles as passenger vehicles for personnel movement around the site.

==Preservation==
Several complete sets have been preserved. These are listed below.
*488202 - Ecclesbourne Valley Railway
*488206 - Barry Tourist Railway
*488311 - Barry Tourist Railway

In addition, 72641 is preserved at Dalton and 72707 the Lincolnshire Wolds Railway. Ian Welch of the Mainline Steam Trust in New Zealand has purchased a number of ex-BR MkII cars formerly used on this service. Three cars comprising set 488313 (TSOLH 72624 and 72625, TSOL 72172) and a further two from 488209 (TFOH 72508 and TSOH 72644) arrived in New Zealand in 2008, still bearing the Intercity livery with &#x27;Gatwick Express&#x27; branding. Most of the cars are in interim storage at Hutt Workshops in Wellington, while others have been trucked to the MLST Wellington base at Plimmerton.

These cars at present have not been equipped with bogies, and are transferred from Hutt to MLST Wellington by road. They will be fitted with either x-28020 bogies ex-FM guard&#x27;s vans, or x-27750 &#x27;Kinki&#x27; bogies ex-FS steam-heating vans as part of the overhaul to bring them up to code-compliance for operation in New Zealand. Unlike most MkII cars in New Zealand, they are receiving only minor modifications to allow them to run in New Zealand, and will receive new numbers. They will also receive new names as well as the new MLST MkII livery of Pearl Grey roof with Midnight Blue body and white window band.

The ex-NIR carriages are now owned by RPSI, and currently in storage until they can join the RPSI&#x27;s existing Mk2 fleet sometime in 2019.

<doc id="1012572" wikidata="Q5365945" url="?curid=1012572" title="Ellis Marsalis Sr.">
<text>Ellis Louis Marsalis Sr. (April 16, 1908 – September 19, 2004) was an American businessman from New Orleans, Louisiana. He was a former poultry farmer turned hotelier, Esso franchise owner and civil rights activist.

==Family==
Marsalis was born in Summit, Mississippi, the son of Rosa (née Gayden) and Simeon &quot;Simmie&quot; Marsalis. His father had changed his surname to &quot;Marsalis&quot;, his stepfather&#x27;s surname. He was the patriarch of the renowned Marsalis musical family that includes his son, Ellis Marsalis Jr., and grandsons Wynton, Branford, Delfeayo, and Jason. Ellis Sr. was married to Florence Robertson (Marsalis), and also has a daughter, Yvette Marsalis, of New Orleans. Marsalis was never a musician of any kind, but was fond of Mississippi Delta Blues.

==Early life==
Marsalis came to New Orleans in 1927 and worked for the Duplain Rhodes Funeral Home, driving a horse-drawn hearse. During World War II, he did welding and built batteries to aid the war effort.
==Hotelier==

In 1943, Marsalis converted a barn on the shore of the Mississippi River into the Marsalis Motel. It catered to African-Americans, who were not allowed to stay at &quot;whites only&quot; New Orleans establishments under Jim Crow—the South&#x27;s segregation laws. The hotel and restaurant quickly attracted prominent musicians, such as Ray Charles, Cab Calloway, Ruth Brown, Etta James, Dinah Washington, and others, as well as some of the most influential civil rights leaders of the day, including Martin Luther King Jr., Adam Clayton Powell Jr. and Thurgood Marshall. He was also elected President of the Nationwide Hotel Association, an organization of Southern Black hotel owners (such as Ferdinand Prout, A.G. Gaston, and Louis Mason) that he co-founded in 1963 in an effort to increase the economic power of their businesses.

==Achievements==

Marsalis was the first Black businessman to obtain an Esso (now Exxon) franchise in the state of Louisiana, co-owning (with William Wicker) and operating an Esso service station on the corner of what is now Claiborne and Louisiana Avenues in New Orleans. He was also the first black businessman to own a successful business in Jefferson Parish (Metairie/Shrewsbury), Louisiana. He was a lifelong member of the Republican Party, and was a delegate to the Republican Convention of 1964. He assisted David Treen&#x27;s successful 1982 campaign for Governor of Louisiana.

Marsalis was instrumental in the voter registration of Black residents of Jefferson Parish from 1951 to 1966. He helped finance the education of Ernest Nathan Morial (&quot;Dutch&quot;), the first Black student to attend the Louisiana State University Law School, who later became the first black mayor of New Orleans. Marsalis also played a role in the election of Judge Lionel Collins, the first Black Judge of the 24th Judicial District Court, in Gretna, Louisiana.

==Later==
The achievements of the Civil rights movement led to a decline in trade at the Marsalis Motel when hotels and motels began to accept anyone as a guest regardless of color. Marsalis&#x27;s Mansion (Motel) closed on 25 September 1986, and it was demolished in July 1993. The property was sold in July 2006. On January 9, 2015, the Jefferson Parish Historical Society erected an historical plaque on the former motel site, honouring Marsalis for his contributions to Jefferson Parish life and to the Civil rights movement.

<text>The Organizing Committee, Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist) (OCCPI(ML)), also known as the Bihar-Bengal Committee (CPI(ML)), was a communist organization in India led by B.N. Sharma.

OCCPI(ML) was in a close cooperation with the Unity Centre of Communist Revolutionaries of India (Marxist–Leninist) (UCCRI(ML)). There was a period of cooperation between the two organizations on trade union solidarity. Discussions took place on forming joint students fronts, for example. However, the process was interrupted when the Bengal committee of UCCRI(ML) got entangled in a fractional conflict. In 1988, OCCPI(ML) merged with four other groups to form the Centre of Communist Revolutionaries of India.

<doc id="1012582" wikidata="Q1397907" url="?curid=1012582" title="Sacred Silence">
<text>Sacred Silence () is a 1996 Italian film directed by Antonio Capuano that deals with a Catholic priest, his pederastic relationship with a Napolitan street boy, and the domination of daily life in Southern Italy by the Camorra. The title translates as &quot;Pianese Nunzio, 14 in May&quot; and the movie was released in the US with the title &quot;Sacred Silence&quot;.

== Plot ==

Don Lorenzo Borrelli (Fabrizio Bentivoglio) is a priest in a poor neighborhood in Naples where Mafia killings are a daily occurrence and most young people see organized crime as a way to earn respect. Don Borelli tries as best as he can to persuade the adolescents that the Camorra is at odds with Catholicism, but has to learn that nothing will change as long as their parents silently accept the Mafia supremacy.

Borrelli&#x27;s personal life centers on his relationship with a 13-year-old choir boy, Nunzio Pianese (Emanuele Gargiulo), who is not only strikingly handsome but also a very talented musician. Nunzio plans on becoming a priest as well, as the easy life of a priest without worries about the future appeals to him.

The mobsters figure that a child molestation charge is a convenient way to get rid of the incendiary Don Lorenzo and try to get the local authorities to investigate. Meanwhile, Nunzio begins to doubt if he should stay his course or give in to the pressure to denounce Don Lorenzo.

== Cast ==

* Fabrizio Bentivoglio as Don Lorenzo Borrelli
* Emanuele Gargiulo as Nunzio Pianese
* Rosaria De Cicco as Rosaria
* Teresa Saponangelo as Anna Maria Pica
* Antonella Stefanucci as Sandra
* Tonino Taiuti as Cuccarini

<doc id="1012583" wikidata="Q2671059" url="?curid=1012583" title="Bruno (webcomic)">
<text>Bruno was a webcomic written and drawn by Christopher Baldwin from 1 January 1996 to 14 February 2007, after initially appearing in print in &quot;The Massachusetts Daily Collegian&quot; starting 27 January 1994. Its plot concerns the life of an introspective young woman, set in the real world. Her unusual name comes from the Italian philosopher Giordano Bruno. In 1998 Peter Zale and Baldwin created the &quot;first Internet comics crossover&quot; between their respective webcomics &quot;Helen, Sweetheart of the Internet&quot; and &quot;Bruno&quot;.

== Themes and literary style ==
&quot;Bruno&quot; deals with various issues through the daily life of the main character and her friends. During the run of the comic, topics included homosexuality, religion, depression, and politics. The comic is characterized by lengthy and sometimes angst-ridden dialogue between the characters, occasionally punctuated by a single panel with a contemplative scene without words. The storylines follow the life of Bruno (somewhat autobiographically) as she quits college, visits friends in various American towns, travels to Europe, falls into and out of relationships, and publishes her novel. As the timeline of the comic follows real time, we gradually see Bruno evolving from a free-spirited college student into a more contemplative woman. Her quest to find her place in life changes but continues to be a main theme of the comic.

== Artistic style ==

The style of the drawings is mostly naturalistic and detailed, with some aspects of a few character designs caricatured. The backgrounds are mostly of real-life places converted to black and white outlines penciled over and shaded with cross-hatching. Bruno&#x27;s face is based roughly on a sketch of an angel&#x27;s head by Leonardo da Vinci.

== Conclusion ==
On 26 December 2006, Baldwin announced the conclusion of &quot;Bruno&quot;, then scheduled for 12 February 2007. The webcomic eventually concluded on 14 February 2007, coinciding with the announcement of the tenth and final &quot;Bruno&quot; book.

== Bibliography ==

<text>The Flea Theater is a theater in the TriBeCa neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City. It presents primarily experimental theatre by Black, brown, and queer artists, as well as a venue for film stars to act on a 74-seat stage. The theater was founded in 1996 by Jim Simpson, Sigourney Weaver, Mac Wellman, and Kyle Chepulis. The Flea earned early acclaim for original productions of post-9-11 play &quot;The Guys&quot; and political works by A. R. Gurney. According to the New York Times, &quot;Since its inception in 1996, The Flea has presented over 100 plays and numerous dance and live music performances. Under Artistic Director Jim Simpson and Producing Director Carol Ostrow, The Flea is one of New York’s leading off-off-Broadway companies.&quot;

==History==

Founded in 1996, the award-winning Flea Theater was originally formed to create, according to the theatre&#x27;s website, “a joyful hell in a small space”. The Flea receives over 17,000 visitors each year. In March 2015, The Flea announced that Niegel Smith would be taking over for Jim Simpson as its new artistic director.

Production highlights include &quot;The Guys&quot; by Anne Nelson, starring Sigourney Weaver and Bill Murray. Additional productions include &quot;Oh the Humanity and Other Exclamations&quot;, by Pulitzer finalist Will Eno, starring Marisa Tomei and Brian Hutchison. This collection of five short plays extended through winter 2008. Another recent Flea hit was &quot;Mrs. Farnsworth&quot;, a political comedy written for The Flea by renowned playwright A. R. Gurney, which was performed by Sigourney Weaver and John Lithgow. &quot;Mrs. Farnsworth&quot; won rave reviews and returned to The Flea for an encore in the fall. For two years in a row, The New York Times named a Flea production as one of the best Off-Broadway shows of the season—&quot;O Jerusalem&quot; in 2003 and &quot;Mrs. Farnsworth&quot; in 2004. Recent productions include &quot;The Great Recession&quot;: six plays commissioned by The Flea exploring the impact of the current economic crisis on the younger generation written by Thomas Bradshaw, Sheila Callaghan, Erin Courtney, Will Eno, Itamar Moses and Adam Rapp; Jonathan Reynolds&#x27;s &quot;Girls in Trouble&quot;; and Bathsheba Doran&#x27;s &quot;Parents’ Evening&quot;.

In the early 2020s, the Flea Theater underwent a substantive organizational reconfiguration in response to longstanding grievances within its artistic community. Dissatisfaction, notably surrounding unpaid labor and perceived mistreatment of Black artists, surfaced prominently in 2020 when actress Bryn Carter articulated concerns regarding elitism and racism within the institution. This catalyzed a transformative process culminating in the establishment of the Fled Collective, a group vocally critical of the extant Flea paradigm, which secured financial support to independently curate programming in the TriBeCa venue. Confronting fiscal challenges subsequent to the departure of key personnel, including Carol Ostrow, the Flea instituted a hybrid operational model, committing to remunerative practices for actors and a thematic emphasis on the works of &quot;Black, brown, and queer artists.&quot; Founding artistic director Jim Simpson and Sigourney Weaver endorsed the transfer of control to the Fled Collective in a joint statement. Emphasizing the Fled Collective&#x27;s earned merit, passion, and potential for a dynamic season, the couple criticized the dissolution of the Flea&#x27;s programs. They underscored the historical contributions of young individuals and concluded with a resolute plea to &quot;Give them the keys.&quot; The organization&#x27;s revival commenced with the staging of &quot;Arden — But, Not Without You,&quot; reflecting a renewed artistic direction.

==New works==
The Flea produces several original major productions each year. Flea artists have been honored with two OBIE Awards, an Otto Award and, in May 2004, The Flea was given a Drama Desk Award for Distinguished Achievement commending its dedication to adventurous theater.

== Awards and recognition ==
In 2010, The Flea was awarded the American Theatre Wing&#x27;s National Theatre Company Grant.

<text>Agustín Farabundo Martí Rodríguez (; 5 May 1893 – 1 February 1932) was a Marxist-Leninist activist and a revolutionary leader in El Salvador during &quot;La Matanza&quot;.

== Early life ==
Martí was born in Teotepeque, a farming community located in Departamento de La Libertad, El Salvador to parents Pedro Martí and Socorro Rodríguez. Farabundo&#x27;s original surname was originally &quot;Mártir&quot; meaning &quot;martyr&quot; in English. However, his father changed it to &quot;Martí&quot; out of admiration for the famous Cuban patriot, José Martí. 
From a very young age, Martí struggled to make sense of the glaring inequalities he witnessed around him. It did not make sense to him why there was such a stark difference between his own shoes and the bare feet of the children from worker families he played with, as well as the contrast between the clean, decent clothes worn by his parents and the tattered, dirty rags on peasant workers.
According to Jorge Arias Gómez&#x27;s biography of Martí, when Martí became a teenager, he frequently pointed out to his parents the clear difference between the plentiful food that his family had compared to the very little food available to workers. Martí would repeatedly make his parents aware of the unfair situation, not understanding why there was such a large gap in the amount and quality of food between his relatively wealthy family and the peasant workers around him.

After graduating from Saint Cecilia Salesian School in Santa Tecla, he enrolled at the University of El Salvador, in San Salvador. From early on, he condemned the exploitation of the country&#x27;s poor for the profit of the rich. He became known as a Salvadoran revolutionary and for many, a martyr.

== Revolutionary activity ==

Farabundo Martí was categorized by Miguel Mármol as an intellectual but a proletarian-like young man in his &quot;testimonio&quot;. Martí decided to drop out of his Political Science and Jurisprudence program at the University of El Salvador in order to fight for his community and nation. In 1920, Martí, along with numerous students, were arrested for taking part in a protest against the then-ruling Meléndez-Quiñónez dynasty. Martí&#x27;s arrest subsequently led to his exile from the country, taking up residence in Guatemala and later Mexico until his return to El Salvador in 1925.

Upon his return from exile, Martí was appointed as a representative and invited to the conference of the Anti-Imperialist League of the Americas in New York City, where he met relatives of Nicaraguan revolutionary leader Augusto César Sandino. Upon arriving in New York, he was once again arrested and later released. In the meantime, he worked with the Nicaraguan revolutionary leader Augusto César Sandino. The two revolutionaries only worked together for a limited time, as they had differences in their approaches to change.
Martí became involved in the founding of the Communist Party of Central America, where he led a communist alternative to the Red Cross, the International Red Aid, serving as one of its representatives. Its goal was to help poor and underprivileged Salvadorans by the use of the Marxist-Leninist ideology. In December 1930, at the height of the country&#x27;s economic and social depression, Martí was once again exiled due to his rising popularity among the nation&#x27;s peasants and working-class. In addition, there were also rumors of his upcoming nomination for President the following year.

== Uprising and death ==

Once the new president Arturo Araujo was elected in March 1931, Martí returned to El Salvador and, along with Alfonso Luna and Mario Zapata, began the movement that was later truncated by the military. They helped start a guerrilla revolt of indigenous farmers. During that time, he was acting as the Interim General Secretary of the Party.

The communist-led peasant uprising against the dictator Maximiliano Hernández Martínez was fomented by collapsing coffee prices, relishing in the initial success but was soon drowned in a bloodbath, being crushed by the Salvadoran military ten days after the uprising had commenced. An estimated 30,000 Salvadoran civilians were killed as a result of the uprising by order of General Martínez which called for the killing of not only suspected participants of the uprising, but of those who were thought to have &quot;not protested&quot; against it. This event became known to as&quot;La Matanza&quot; (&quot;The Slaughter&quot;).

President Hernández Martínez, who had himself toppled an elected government only weeks earlier, ordered Martí shot after a court-martial.

<text>The Amphitheatrum Castrense is a Roman amphitheatre in Rome, next to the church of Santa Croce in Gerusalemme. Both the Amphiteatrum and the Circus Varianus were part of the palatial villa known as the Horti Spei Veteris and later the Palatium Sessorium. The Regionary Catalogues name it as the &quot;Amphitheatrum Castrense&quot;, which could mean it was an amphitheatre connected to an imperial residence.

==History==

The amphitheatre was built by emperor Elagabalus (r. 218-222) in the first decades of the 3rd century AD dated by the style of the bricks and the absence of brick stamps. It was part of the Horti Spei Veteris, the Imperial villa complex built by emperors of the Severan dynasty.

The open arches of the outer walls were walled up when the building was incorporated into the Aurelian Walls (271–-275 AD), at which point it stopped being used for spectacles and began to be used as fortification, and the ground level around the building was lowered. In the middle of the 16th century the remains of the second story were demolished for defensive needs. In the 18th century, a hypogeum was found beneath the arena, filled with the bones of large animals. This leads researchers to believe that the spectacles here included &quot;venationes&quot;, the hunting and killing of wild animals. Andrea Palladio and Étienne Dupérac made drawings about the ruins.

==Construction==

The building is a regular ellipse of 88 x 76 m constructed of brick-faced concrete, with a few decorative elements in travertine. It was three stories high, but only a section of the lowest story is preserved.

<doc id="1012603" wikidata="Q139425" url="?curid=1012603" title="Order of Orange-Nassau">
<text>The Order of Orange-Nassau () is a civil and military Dutch order of chivalry founded on 4 April 1892 by the queen regent, Emma of the Netherlands.

The order is a chivalric order open to &quot;everyone who has performed acts of special merits for society.” These are people who deserve appreciation and recognition from society for the special way in which they have carried out their activities.

Titles, prefixes, or post-nominals are not used in the Netherlands – the only exception being the Military William Order.

==History==
In 1841 William II of the Netherlands, as Grand Duke of Luxembourg, created the Order of the Oak Crown. Although this was officially not a Dutch order, honours were regularly conferred on Dutch people. After the death of William III, Luxembourg, according to the Nassau Family Pact, became the domain of the other branch of the House of Nassau. In the Netherlands the need for a third order, beside the Military William Order and Order of the Netherlands Lion was felt, so that royal honours could be conferred upon foreign diplomats and people from lower ranks and classes.

During World War II, the Order of Orange-Nassau was bestowed upon both members of the Netherlands military and members of foreign services who had helped liberate the Netherlands from Nazi German occupation, and those who helped liberate the former Dutch colonies in the Pacific. In the modern age, the Orange-Nassau is still the most active civil and military decoration of the Netherlands, and ranks after the Order of the Netherlands Lion. The order is typically awarded each year on the Monarch&#x27;s official birthday (currently April 27) with around 3500 appointments to the order made public. The order is also used to honour foreign princes, ministers, dignitaries and diplomats.

In 1994, the Dutch honours system was extensively revised after almost thirty years of discussion. This revision by law intended to create a more democratic honours system, disconnecting the level of the honours from rank and social status. In principle, since then everyone in Dutch society can be honoured. An honour is only awarded on the basis of special, personal merits for society. Before this revision the order consisted of five grades with additional honorary medals (gold, silver and bronze). The honorary medals were only affiliated with the order and bearers were not formally included in the order. In 1996, the honorary medals were abolished and replaced by the Member Class of the Order of Orange-Nassau, which is reserved only for Dutch citizens. The vast majority of awards are at the level of Member and are for voluntary service; the grade of Knight is awarded for outstanding personal achievement, the grade of Officer for contributions of national or international significance (e.g. distinguished professors; former ministers, but also very well-known disc jockeys or even a tattooist of very high reputation). The Officer grade is the first of what are referred to as the &#x27;special decorations&#x27;. The grade of Commander is very sparingly awarded, and the two highest grades are awarded only very rarely indeed (for example to those with a record of distinguished service in public life who have occupied many high positions over a good number of years).

==Grades==

The Order of Orange-Nassau has two divisions, civil and military, the former denoted by a wreath of laurel on the badges, and the latter by crossed swords on both the badges and the stars.

The king or queen regnant of the Netherlands is the Grand Master of the Order of Orange-Nassau.

===Since 1996===
In addition to the two divisions, since 1996 the Order of Orange-Nassau has been issued in six classes:
# Knight Grand Cross – the gold badge may be worn on a sash on the right shoulder, plus an 8-pointed star on the left chest
# Grand Officer – the gold badge may be worn by men on a necklet, and by women worn on a ribbon tied as a bow at the left chest; also a 4-pointed star is worn on the left chest
# Commander – the gold badge may be worn by men on a necklet, and by women worn on a ribbon tied as a bow at the left chest
# Officer – wears the gold badge on a ribbon with a rosette on the left chest
# Knight – wears a gold badge on a ribbon with a silver crown on the left chest
# Member – wears a silver badge on a ribbon on the left chest

For the grades of Knight and Member, the badges are made of silver. For the other grades, the silver is gilded.

===Prior to 1996===
Until 1996, the Order of Orange-Nassau consisted of five grades. In addition, honorary medals were issued in Gold, Silver and Bronze, but these were only affiliated with the order; the bearers of the medal were not members of the order. Now no longer issued, these were replaced by the sixth grade: &quot;Member&quot;. Recipients wore the medal on a ribbon on the left chest.

==Insignia==

The &quot;badge&quot; of the order is a blue-enamelled, white enamel-bordered Maltese Cross, in gilt for the officers and above, in silver for knights and members. The obverse central disc displays the King&#x27;s coat of arms in gold and blue enamel, surrounded by a white enamel ring bearing the national motto &quot;Je Maintiendrai&quot; (I shall maintain). The reverse central disc has the crowned monogram &quot;W&quot; (for Queen Wilhelmina) surrounded by the motto &quot;God Zij Met Ons&quot; (God be with us). The badge hangs from a royal crown. The civil division has a wreath of laurel between the arms of the cross; the military division has crossed swords instead. The badge is attached to a &quot;ribbon&quot; which is orange with white and blue border stripes. The way the badge and ribbon should be worn differs between men and women.

The &quot;star&quot; of the order is a silver star with straight rays, in 8 points for Grand Cross and in 4 points for Grand Officer; the central disc has the King&#x27;s arms in gold and blue enamel, surrounded by a white enamel ring bearing the Dutch national motto &quot;Je Maintiendrai&quot;. The military division has crossed swords.

<doc id="1012608" wikidata="Q122334" url="?curid=1012608" title="Hone Tuwhare">
<text>Hone Peneamine Anatipa Te Pona Tuwhare (21 October 1922 – 16 January 2008) was a noted Māori New Zealand poet. He is closely associated with The Catlins in the Southland region of New Zealand, where he lived for the latter part of his life.

==Early years==
Tuwhare was born in Kaikohe, Northland, into the Ngāpuhi tribe (hapū Ngati Korokoro, Ngāti Tautahi, Te Popoto, Te Uri-o-Hua). Following the death of his mother, his family shifted to Auckland, where Hone attended primary schools in Avondale, Māngere and Ponsonby. He apprenticed as a boilermaker with the New Zealand Railways and took night classes in Mathematics, Trade Drawing and Trade Theory at Seddon Memorial Technical College (1939–41) and Otahuhu College (1941). Tuwhare spoke Māori until he was about 9, and his father, an accomplished orator and storyteller, encouraged his son&#x27;s interest in the written and spoken word, especially in the rhythms and imagery of the Old Testament.

== Poetry career ==
Starting in 1939, Tuwhare, encouraged by fellow poet R.A.K. Mason, began to write while working as an apprentice at the Otahuhu Railway Workshops.

In 1956, Tuwhare started writing seriously after resigning from a local branch of the Communist party. His first, and arguably best known work, &quot;No Ordinary Sun&quot;, was published in 1964 to widespread acclaim and subsequently reprinted ten times over the next 30 years, becoming one of the most widely read individual collections of poetry in New Zealand history.

When Tuwhare&#x27;s poems first began to appear in the late 1950s and early 1960s they were recognised as a new departure in New Zealand poetry, cutting across the debates and divisions between the 1930s and post-war generations. Much of the works&#x27; originality was the result of their distinctly Māori perspective. The poems were marked by their tonal variety, the naturalness with which they could move between formal and informal registers, between humour and pathos, intimacy and controlled anger and, especially, in their assumption of easy vernacular familiarity with New Zealand readers.

During the 1970s Tuwhare became involved in Māori cultural and political initiatives. This same era also saw his international reputation grow, with invitations to visit both China and Germany, which, among other opportunities, lead to the publication of &quot;Was wirklicher ist als Sterben&quot; in 1985.

In 1990, artist Selwyn Muru incorporated a haiku written by Tuwhare into &quot;Waharoa&quot;, a sculptural gateway at the entrance of Aotea Square in Auckland. Muru translated the piece into Māori, and inscribed this alongside Tuwhare&#x27;s original words.

While his earlier poems were kept in print, new work was constantly produced. Tuwhare&#x27;s play, &quot;In the Wilderness Without a Hat&quot;, was published in 1991. Three further collections of poetry then followed: &quot;Short Back and Sideways: Poems &amp; Prose&quot; (1992), &quot;Deep River Talk&quot; (1993), and &quot;Shape-Shifter&quot; (1997). In 1999 he was named New Zealand&#x27;s second Te Mata Poet Laureate, the outcome of which was the publication &quot;Piggy-Back Moon&quot; (2002).

The poet moved to Kaka Point in South Otago in 1992, and many of his later poems reflected the scenery of The Catlins area, and the seafood available. He had a strong working relationship with fellow Otago artist Ralph Hotere, and their work often referenced each other.
Tuwhare&#x27;s poem &quot;Rain&quot; was in 2007 voted New Zealand&#x27;s favourite poem by a clear margin.

Poetry by Tuwhare was included in &quot;UPU,&quot; a curation of Pacific Island writers’ work which was first presented at the Silo Theatre as part of the Auckland Arts Festival in March 2020. &quot;UPU&quot; was remounted as part of the Kia Mau Festival in Wellington in June 2021.

== Recognition and awards ==
Tuwhare was awarded the Robert Burns Fellowship from the University of Otago in 1969 and again in 1974. He was awarded the University of Auckland Literary Fellowship in 1991. In 1999, he was named New Zealand&#x27;s second Te Mata Poet Laureate. At the end of his two-year term he published &quot;Piggy Back Moon&quot; (2001), which was shortlisted in the 2002 Montana New Zealand Book Awards.

Tuwhare was among ten of New Zealand&#x27;s greatest living artists named as Arts Foundation of New Zealand Icon Artists at a ceremony in 2003.

In 2003, Tuwhare was awarded one of the inaugural Prime Minister&#x27;s Awards for Literary Achievement, for poetry. The other winners were novelist Janet Frame and historian Michael King. Each recipient received a cash prize of $60,000 NZD. The awards are aimed at New Zealand writers who have made an outstanding contribution to the nation&#x27;s literary and cultural history.

Tuwhare received an honorary Doctor of Literature degree from The University of Auckland in 2005. At the time of his death Tuwhare was described as &quot;New Zealand&#x27;s most distinguished Maori writer&quot;*.

== Hone Tuwhare Charitable Trust ==
In July 2010 the Hone Tuwhare Charitable trust was formed in honour of Tuwhare. Their goal is: &quot;To inspire people through the preservation, promotion, and celebration of Hone’s legacy&quot;.

<doc id="1012617" wikidata="Q3455680" url="?curid=1012617" title="Air shuttle">
<text>An air shuttle is a scheduled airline service on short routes with a simplified fare and class structure. No exact definition exists, but the frequency is usually an hour or less and travel time is typically an hour or less. Network airlines may operate shuttle services as one-class or no-frill services, similar to low-cost airlines.

Some shuttles are established by governments, businesses, or organizations which require a high level of service in an otherwise thin corridor. For example, the Federal Aviation Administration&#x27;s William J. Hughes Technical Center in Atlantic City, New Jersey operates an air shuttle to ferry FAA employees to and from Reagan National Airport (DCA) near Washington, DC four days a week.

Certain markets support commercial shuttles. The pioneer service was the Rio de Janeiro-São Paulo air bridge in Brazil which began 5 July 1959. Other early services include the Eastern Air Shuttle, inaugurated in 1961, which offered no-frills, hourly flights connecting LaGuardia Airport in New York City with Washington National Airport and Logan International Airport in Boston, Massachusetts.

Air shuttles increasingly face competition from high-speed rail and many airlines withdraw from the market or reduce service shortly after competing high-speed rail services start.

Present-day commercial air shuttle services include:

* Aeroflot has a frequent service between the cities of Moscow and Saint Petersburg in Russia. It is now increasingly competing with Sapsan service by Russian Railways along the same route.
* Air Canada’s &quot;RapidAir&quot; service between Toronto and Montreal as well as Toronto and Ottawa in Canada. The route is also served by WestJet &quot;Simplicity&quot; service and Porter Airlines with up to 200 flights every weekday between the three cities. Air Canada also offers hourly flights between Toronto and Vancouver. However, these flights last at least 4.5 hours. 
* Air France &quot;La Navette&quot; service offers 80 flights a day from Paris-Orly Airport to Marseille, Bordeaux, Nice, and Toulouse, with a flight every 30–60 minutes. This service is used by more than 5.6 million travellers every year. LGV Méditerranée opening in 2001 and LGV Sud-Ouest opening in 2017 now connect Marseille and Bordeaux to Paris in under four hours, while extensions to Nice and Toulouse are planned. Paris-Toulouse is France&#x27;s busiest air route. It was Paris-Lyon prior to the introduction of TGV service.
* Air New Zealand operates about 20 flights every day from Auckland to Wellington and Christchurch (3 of New Zealand&#x27;s largest cities) using Airbus A320s, with up to half-hourly services during peak hours. There are also approximately 15 daily flights between Wellington and Christchurch using a mix of their mainline jets and the turboprop regional aircraft operated by Air New Zealand Link.
* Alitalia (now ITA Airways) made about 60 flights per day between Rome Fiumicino and Milano Linate Airport in a service called &quot;ROMAMILANO&quot;. At the two airports the check-in counters and security checkpoints were reserved for the passengers of this service.
* American Airlines Shuttle, founded as Eastern Air Lines Shuttle then Trump Shuttle then US Airways Shuttle facing increasing competition from the Acela Express since 2000
* Azul, GOL and LATAM Brasil&#x27;s &quot;Ponte Aérea&quot; (&quot;Air Bridge&quot;) service between São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, every 10 minutes for an average total of 120 flights per day. Santos Dumont Airport is Rio’s airport while São Paulo–Congonhas Airport is São Paulo’s airport.
* Delta Shuttle is a shuttle serving the northeastern United States.
* Finnair and Norwegian Air Shuttle provide frequent service over the day between Helsinki Airport and Oulu Airport.
* Horizon Air service between Seattle Tacoma International Airport and Portland International Airport
* Iberia &quot;Puente Aéreo&quot; service between Madrid and Barcelona in Spain every 30 minutes. It is heavily reduced since the opening of the Madrid-Barcelona High-Speed Rail line
* Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways service between Tokyo (Tokyo International Airport, Narita International Airport) and Osaka (Osaka International Airport, Kansai International Airport, Kobe Airport) in Japan
* Korean Air, Asiana Airlines and other smaller Korean airlines&#x27; service between Gimpo International Airport and Jeju International Airport. 
* Lufthansa offers an up to 30-minute headways service between Berlin Brandenburg Airport, Frankfurt Airport, Munich Airport and Hamburg Airport. It offers in addition an hourly service between Frankfurt Airport and London-Heathrow Airport, Frankfurt Airport and Brussels Airport. In cooperation with Austrian Airlines they offer a shuttle between Frankfurt Airport and Vienna Airport. On the Berlin-Frankfurt and on the Berlin-Munich route competes directly with the ICE Sprinter.
* Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) and Norwegian Air Shuttle provide a shuttle service between the Norwegian airports of Oslo Airport, Gardermoen and Bergen Airport, Flesland; Trondheim Airport, Værnes and Stavanger Airport, Sola with up to 30-minute headways. Both companies also operate shuttle services, with up to hourly-headways, between Stockholm-Arlanda Airport and Göteborg Landvetter Airport, Stockholm Arlanda Airport and Malmö Airport and between Copenhagen Airport and Aalborg Airport.
* Singapore Airlines and Malaysia Airlines code-share an hourly Kuala Lumpur-Singapore shuttle.
* South African Airways and Mango provide an air shuttle service between OR Tambo International Airport and Cape Town International Airport with up to half-hourly headways
* TAP Portugal&#x27;s &quot;Ponte Aérea&quot; (&quot;Air Bridge&quot;) service between Lisbon and Porto in Portugal.
* Turkish Airlines and Pegasus Airlines 64 daily flight between İstanbul Atatürk Airport and Izmir Airport. This route is the second-busiest route in Europe.
* SAS also has a shuttle on the triangular route between Oslo Airport, Gardermoen (Norway), Stockholm-Arlanda Airport (Sweden) and Copenhagen Airport (Denmark) with up to hourly headways.
* The Carrasco International Airport in Uruguay has an air bridge to Buenos Aires airports Aeroparque Jorge Newbery and Ezeiza International Airport.
* The route between Dublin and London is served by over 640 flights each week, with departures occurring on average every 20 minutes in each direction. The majority of the flights are operated by Aer Lingus, Ryanair and British Airways but CityJet also operates on the route. The route competes for the title of the busiest international air route in the world.
* The routes between Hong Kong and Taipei, Taiwan (Republic of China), and between Hong Kong and Bangkok, Thailand, are served by multiple carriers providing frequent service with a frequency less than an hour during day time.
* Qantas and QantasLink &#x27;CityFlyer&#x27; service offers flights between major Australian capital cities on weekdays, with complimentary alcoholic afternoon drinks, newspapers, flexible fares and more frequent schedules. Flights between Sydney &amp; Melbourne, and Brisbane &amp; Sydney both take approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes of flight time.

The busiest air routes in the world involve pairs of large cities in close proximity that rely on air transport due to a lack of high-speed rail, and the distance is large enough to discourage car driving. Several of the airports are on islands without road connection to the mainland.

<text>British Universities and Colleges Sport, commonly abbreviated as BUCS, is the governing body for higher education sport in the United Kingdom. 

BUCS is responsible for organising 54 inter-university sports in the United Kingdom, as well as representative teams for the FISU World University Championships and the FISU World University Games.

BUCS is a membership organisation of over 165 universities and colleges, with six thousand teams competing across 850 leagues. Anne, Princess Royal is currently patron of BUCS.

==History==

BUCS was formed in 2008 by a merger of British Universities Sports Association (BUSA) and University College Sport (UCS).

==Sports==

As of 2024, BUCS organise competition across 54 sports.

===Non-BUCS sports===
Certain university and college sports are not governed by BUCS for various reasons. The following is a partial list of these sports and respective competitions:

==Competitions and events==
Team sports compete in BUCS leagues, with the majority of league fixtures taking place on Wednesday afternoons, which is commonly referred to as BUCS Wednesday. Wednesday afternoons are generally free from lectures to allow students to compete in sport. There are 850 leagues, with institutions across the country competing against each other to avoid relegation or win the league and gain promotion to higher leagues.

The finals of the Championship and Trophy are played at BUCS Big Wednesday. This annual single-day event showcases the Championship and Trophy finals across 16 league sports. Big Wednesday will take place at Loughborough University.

BUCS Nationals is an annual multisport event that takes place across three days. As of 2023, indoor athletics, swimming, badminton and climbing are the sports represented at BUCS Nationals. The event is held in Sheffield.

Over the year, BUCS runs over 120 events for both individual and team sports.

==BUCS Points==
BUCS Points are awarded to institutions based on their finishing positions in leagues and events under the BUCS marquee. The accumulation of these points determines the overall BUCS champion.

Loughborough University have topped the overall BUCS standings in each of the 14 years since its founding, including the 2023–24 season. As of 2024, no university has scored within 1000 points of Loughborough in the overall standings. 

Both the 2019–20 and 2020–21 seasons were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom.

===By year===

===By university===

==International representation==
Members of both FISU (International University Sport Federations) and EUSA (European University Sports Association), BUCS is responsible for sending a cohort of students to international events including the World University Summer &amp; Winter Games and the European Universities Games. The British international team goes by the name of GB Students.

==National governing body involvement==

BUCS applies for annual funding from Sport England to support the delivery of student sport across the country. They also work with national governing bodies to develop sports within the student sector and some posts within BUCS are funded by such bodies, with the aim of developing specific student sports.

===Partnership with the Football Association (2016–present)===

The Football Association (FA) fund projects and positions within BUCS to help develop grassroots football. With their investment, BUCS set up 167 FA Grassroot Hubs to support football and futsal in the higher education sector, benefiting over 250 thousand participants.

BUCS also collaborated with the FA to create the Women&#x27;s Leadership Programme, providing female students with important skills and qualities to help them in their future careers. The first cohort of leaders graduated in 2020.

==Board==
The BUCS Board is responsible for leading strong governance and strategic leadership within the sector. The Board is made up of the chair, five independent directors and four BUCS directors - two representing students and two representing the staff of the membership.

Chair of the Board: Vacant

Commercial Director and Senior Independent Director: Russell James

<doc id="1012621" wikidata="Q1774856" url="?curid=1012621" title="Klondike Gold Rush National Historical Park">
<text>Klondike Gold Rush National Historical Park is a national historical park operated by the National Park Service that seeks to commemorate the Klondike Gold Rush of the late 1890s. Though the gold fields that were the ultimate goal of the stampeders lay in Yukon, the park comprises staging areas for the trek there and the routes leading in its direction. There are four units, including three in Municipality of Skagway Borough, Alaska and a fourth in the Pioneer Square National Historic District in Seattle, Washington.

A fuller appreciation of the story of the Klondike Gold Rush requires exploration and discovery on both sides of the Canada–United States border. National historic sites in Whitehorse and Dawson City, Yukon, as well as in British Columbia, complete the story. In 1998, Klondike Gold Rush National Historical Park joined with Chilkoot Trail National Historic Site, Dawson Historical Complex National Historic Site, and &quot;The Thirty Mile&quot; stretch of the Yukon River to create Klondike Gold Rush International Historical Park, allowing for an integrated binational experience.

==Historic Skagway==


The Skagway unit includes much of the historic downtown such as buildings owned and restored by NPS and others, some leased even today for ordinary commercial purposes to recreate the city&#x27;s bustling activity. The visitor center in Skagway is located in railroad depot building at Second and Broadway and is a good place to begin tours either led by a ranger or self-guided. Junior rangers can plan their activities further and earn their badges further up Broadway at the Pantheon Saloon.

* White Pass &amp; Yukon Route Railway Broadway Depot. Corner of 2nd Avenue and Broadway. Now serving as the park&#x27;s Visitors Center and Headquarters, the depot was the first building the railway built for this purpose, completed in December 1898. The structure served this purpose at least until the 1950s. However, together with the adjoining administration building and the railway itself, these were taken over by the U.S. Army Railway Operating Battalion from 1942 to 1946 to supply construction of the Alaska Highway, the first land route to Alaska, then under construction in adjoining British Columbia and Yukon Territory as part of the war effort. It was the only commercial railway in the United States taken over for this purpose. The building was transferred to NPS in 1976 with restoration completed in 1984, returning its appearance to the 1908-1915 time period.
* White Pass &amp; Yukon Route Railway Administration Building. 2nd Avenue, east of Broadway. The bottom floor houses the park museum while additional park offices are located upstairs. Located next to the depot, the &quot;Daily Alaskan&quot; noted during the year of its completion in its May 3, 1900 edition that it the railway&#x27;s headquarters was &quot;by far the finest wooden structure in the city&quot;. As with the depot, it was vacated in 1969, transferred to NPS in 1976, with restoration completed in 1984.
* Martin Itjen&#x27;s House. Broadway between 1st Avenue and 2nd Avenue. The building serves as the NPS and Parks Canada Trail Center, and is one of the first structures visitors to the park arriving by ship see. Originally it stood on piers by the wharf, completed in 1902, and is reminiscent of homes built for railway employees. In 1922, it was sold to Martin Itjen who had learned to profit from the summer tourist trade by greeting passers-by and selling tours of the town&#x27;s attractions. Relocation of railway tracks in 1946 isolated the house, which after two intermediate moves ended up on Sixth. NPS acquired the structure in 1978, moving it to its current position 300 feet (92 m) west of its original location. Restoration was completed in 1991 to return the home to the 1921-1941 period.
* Jeff. Smith&#x27;s Parlor. 2nd Avenue west of Broadway. The building was most famously used as a base of operations by con man and outlaw Jefferson &quot;Soapy&quot; Smith who ended up in Alaska by way of Denver. He and his gang defrauded and tricked miners for only three months before Smith was shot to death in spectacular fashion on the Skagway wharf. Martin Itjen bought the saloon in 1922, and outfitted it as a museum with animatronic figures of Soapy Smith and his associates. Even after selling it in 1950, the museum remained in operation until 1986. Donated to NPS in 2007, the building was refurbished to its old glory as it would have been seen by visitors back in 1967, and reopened in April 2016.
* Verbauwhede&#x27;s Cigar Store, Confectionery, and Cribs. Broadway between 2nd Avenue and 3rd Avenue. Frederick Verbauwhede originally opened a store selling cigars and confections here in 1898, and in 1902 moved one-story &quot;cribs&quot; behind the store from their previous location between Fourth and Fifth where they housed prostitutes. A gunsmith, jeweler, gas station and travel agency occupied the premises at one time or another through 1977 when NPS purchased the buildings. Restored in 1986, the cigar store is leased to a private business while the cribs are used by the park&#x27;s law enforcement operations.
* Boas Tailor &amp; Furrier Shop. Broadway between 2nd Avenue and 3rd Avenue. As the name implies, it was formerly, though briefly, a furrier, topped by a traditional high wooden false front as seen in other western towns in the United States and Canada. After a series of other business, it was sold to NPS in 1978 with period restoration completed in 1986. It is now leased to private business to encourage a feeling of Skagway as a center of bustling business activity.
* Pacific Clipper Line Office. Broadway near 3rd Avenue. First serving the considerable steamship trade that brought passengers to Skagway that lack other means of access, the building later became a liquor store before Skagway was hit by municipal prohibition in 1916 and other uses were found for it. NPS acquired the building in 1976, and after restoration began leasing it to private business in 1990.
* Mascot Saloon. Corner of Broadway and 3rd Avenue. The saloon opened in 1898 and unlike few others survived as bar through prohibition in Skagway in 1916. After that it was used as a drugstore and for other purposes until it was transferred to NPS in 1976. It was restored to its post-rush period appearance and reopened as an exhibit in 1990.
* Lynch and Kennedy Dry Goods Store. Broadway between 3rd Avenue and 4th Avenue. Originally built in 1900 as barracks for the all-black Company L 24th Infantry. The building was moved from Sixth to Broadway and a false front was added in order to open a haberdashery and dry goods store in the location in September 1908. The &quot;Daily Alaskan&quot; described the store as &quot;just about the most handsomest in the city&quot;. All the same it closed by 1920, and thereafter served variously as a restaurant and again as barracks before being purchased by NPS in 1977. Restoration was completed in 1990, returning it to the 1908-1915 time period. It is leased to a private business.
* Pantheon Saloon. Corner of Broadway and 4th Avenue. Though a hardware store in 1898, the Pantheon became a saloon in 1903 and stayed in business until municipal prohibition in 1916. It served varied functions before being sold to NPS in 1977. Now restored to its 1903-1916 appearance, the Pantheon invites in young visitors to explore the park and earn their Junior Ranger patches.

* Moore Homestead. Between 5th Avenue and 6th Avenue, east of Broadway. The first homestead in Skagway, which predates the gold rush era.
* Peniel Mission. Eastern end of 6th Avenue. Originally a Christian mission, now used as modest housing for the park&#x27;s seasonal employees.

==White Pass Trail==
The park includes as one of its units the White Pass Trail. White Pass is a mountain pass that leads from Skagway to the headwaters of the Yukon River in British Columbia. The trail was one of the two main routes used by prospectors to get from Skagway over the Boundary Range on their way to the gold fields in the Yukon. The White Pass and Yukon Route railway, completed in 1900, used White Pass to bring prospectors from Skagway to Whitehorse, Yukon.

==Dyea Townsite and Chilkoot Trail==
The historic townsite of Dyea is also part of the historical park, from which the Chilkoot Trail leaves and runs to Bennett Lake in British Columbia. From there, prospectors generally rafted to Dawson City, Yukon. The trail center in Skagway, operated by both the National Park Service and Parks Canada, has information regarding current conditions along the Chilkoot Trail as it travels through both countries. A permit is required to hike the 33-mile (53-kilometer) trail.

==Seattle unit==

The Pioneer Square Historic District has several buildings dating to the 1880s and 1890s. The Cadillac Hotel (built 1890) at 319 Second Avenue South was a major point of outfitting and departure during the gold rush stampede. Severely damaged in the 2001 Nisqually earthquake, it was rehabilitated in 2004–2005 as home to the interpretive center and museum for the Seattle unit of the park, and was opened and dedicated on June 26, 2006.

The Seattle unit&#x27;s visitor center originally opened June 2, 1979 in the Union Trust Annex (built 1902), across Main Street from Occidental Park. Other historic buildings include the Pioneer Building (1892), Schwabacher Building (1890), Grand Central Hotel (1889), and Metropole Building (1895).

The National Park Travelers Club held its 2014 convention at Klondike Gold Rush.

==International Park==

In 1969, the United States and Canadian governments jointly declared their intention to make Chilkoot Trail a component of a Klondike Gold Rush International Historic Park. The U.S. portion was eventually established in 1976 as part of Klondike Gold Rush National Historical Park.

The Canadian portion of the trail became Chilkoot Trail National Historic Site, one of several sites in the national park system associated with the Klondike. But it was not until the centennial of the gold rush, in 1998, that the dream of an international park was realized, when Klondike Gold Rush National Historical Park and Chilkoot Trail National Historic Site were declared to constitute jointly the Klondike Gold Rush International Historical Park. Their previous legal names were retained, while the new name reflected co-operative management between the two park services, and the formalization of relations which had in fact been going on for years.

Beyond this, joint resolutions recognize the relevance to gold rush interpretation of the Dawson Historical Complex National Historic Site, in Dawson City, Yukon, which includes significant buildings. Parks Canada identifies Dawson City as a unit of the international park, as well as &quot;The Thirty Mile&quot; section of the Yukon River, a national heritage river from Lake Laberge to the Teslin River. The river has been recognized by both countries as part of their joint interpretative efforts.

Beyond the formal international historical park are national historic sites in Yukon concerned with the gold rush:

<doc id="1012623" wikidata="Q153325" url="?curid=1012623" title="Operation Harvest Festival">
<text>Operation Harvest Festival () was the murder of up to 43,000 Jews at the Majdanek, Poniatowa and Trawniki concentration camps by the SS, the Order Police battalions, and the Ukrainian &quot;Sonderdienst&quot; on 3–4 November 1943. 

After a series of Jewish uprisings in ghettos and extermination camps, Heinrich Himmler ordered the murder of the remaining Jewish forced laborers in the Lublin District of German-occupied Poland. Jewish laborers in the camps had to dig zigzag trenches, supposedly for air defense, in late October. Thousands of SS and police personnel arrived in Lublin on 2 November. That day, SS and Police Leader Jakob Sporrenberg, who was in charge of the operation, held a conference to plan it.

The killings began on the morning of 3 November at Majdanek, where Jewish prisoners were separated from non-Jewish prisoners, and encompassed the Lipowa 7 and Lublin airfield camps, which imprisoned Jews in the city. A total of 18,400 people were shot by the early evening. The same day, 6,000 people were murdered at Trawniki, including some from Dorohucza. After finishing the Majdanek operation, several of the involved units proceeded to Poniatowa, where they murdered the camp&#x27;s 14,500 prisoners on 4 November. In all three camps, Jews were forced to strip naked and walk into the previously dug trenches, where they were shot. Loud music was played to cover the sound of gunfire.

After the operation, about 10,000 Jews were left alive in various labor camps in the Lublin District. The bodies of the victims were burned by other Jews, who had been spared temporarily from death. With around 40,000 victims, Operation Harvest Festival was the largest single massacre of Jews by German forces during the Holocaust.

==Background==
In 1942, 360,000 of the Jews who lived in the Lublin District of the General Governorate of German-occupied Poland were murdered during Operation Reinhard. By the end of the year, only 20,000 Jews were living in German camps and ghettos and no more than another 20,000 were in hiding. Beginning in January 1943, Jews launched a series of revolts in the General Governorate, including those at Warsaw Ghetto, Białystok Ghetto, and Treblinka extermination camp, while anti-Nazi partisan activity was increasing throughout the area. Although the proximate reason for ordering Harvest Festival is unknown, historians believe that it was in response to the uprising at Sobibór extermination camp on 14 October 1943. Thousands of the Jewish prisoners in the camps of the Lublin District had been transported there from the Warsaw Ghetto after the failure of the uprising there.

To avoid further resistance, Heinrich Himmler decided to exterminate the Jewish prisoners at the Lublin camps in a single decisive blow using overwhelming military force. Himmler ordered Friedrich Krüger, Higher SS and Police Leader in the General Governorate, to carry out the mass murder operation; Krüger delegated it to SS and Police Leader Jakob Sporrenberg, who had recently succeeded Odilo Globocnik. Jewish inmates were ordered to dig zigzag trenches along the perimeter of Majdanek, Poniatowa, and Trawniki concentration camps. At Majdanek, the trenches were dug by a team of 300 prisoners working in three shifts in field 5, south of the crematorium, and measured about long, deep and wide. Although the trenches were supposedly for defense against air raids, and their zigzag shape granted some plausibility to this lie, the prisoners guessed their true purpose.

On 2 November, 2,000 to 3,000 SS and police personnel arrived in Lublin: Waffen-SS from as far away as Kraków, Police Regiment 22, Police Regiment 25 (including Reserve Police Battalion 101), and the Lublin Security Police. That evening, Sporrenberg convened a meeting between his own staff, the commandants of Majdanek, Trawniki, and Poniatowa, local Security Police commander , and the commanders of the various units. The murder operation, due to begin at dawn the next day, was planned as a military operation, with the code name &quot;Erntefest&quot; (&quot;Harvest Festival&quot;). Two loudspeakers, installed on police cars, were positioned at Majdanek, one near the trenches and the other by the entrance of the camp. The leadership of the Lipowa 7 camp in Lublin, which held Jewish prisoners of war, queried Himmler as to whether they should violate the Geneva Convention by allowing the prisoners to be executed. Himmler&#x27;s aide, Werner Grothmann, replied that &quot;all Jews without exception are subject to liquidation&quot;. 

==Killings==
===Majdanek===

At 5:00 on 3 November 1943, prisoners at Majdanek were awoken as usual in the dark, but the camp had been surrounded by an additional 500 soldiers during the night. The 3,500 to 4,000 Jewish prisoners lived among non-Jewish prisoners. After morning roll call, the groups were separated, with Jews ordered to go to camp 5. Jews in the infirmary were trucked to that location, while the non-Jewish prisoners at camp 5 were moved to camp 4. The barbed wire fence was repositioned to include the execution area within the cordon. Prisoners were forced to undress and driven in groups of one hundred to the three trenches in the field beyond the camp. At the beginning of a ramp leading to the trenches, the Jews were separated into groups of ten and forced onward to the trenches. Execution squads of 10–12 men each from police battalions and 5th SS Panzer Division Wiking were waiting, and were replaced every few hours. The prisoners were forced to lie down in the trenches and were shot in the nape of the neck.

About 600 prisoners, half men and half women, were selected at the Lublin airfield camp to clean up after the massacre at Majdanek. The rest, approximately 5,000 or 6,000, along with 2,500 Jewish prisoners of war at Lipowa 7, were marched toward Majdanek. Despite being heavily guarded, the Jewish prisoners of war rushed their guards and tried to escape, reportedly shouting &quot;Niech żyje wolność!&quot; (Long live freedom!) Almost all were shot before they could get away. The first prisoners from the other camps arrived at Majdanek around 7:30 and continued to arrive throughout the morning. Among the Jews from Majdanek, some tried to escape their fate through suicide or by hiding in the barracks. The next day, twenty-three Jews were discovered and were executed at the Majdanek crematorium. The speakers, which had been installed the previous day, were turned on as soon as the gunfire started, but it could still be heard. Local Poles watched from the rooftops of nearby buildings outside the camp, while Sporrenberg observed from a Fieseler Storch airplane. It is not clear who directed the operation as it was ongoing; it may have been Sporrenberg or Hermann Höfle. The killing continued, uninterrupted until around 17:00 and by then all 18,400 prisoners had been murdered.

===Trawniki===
Previous to the operation, Polish residents who lived adjacent to the camp were forced to move and those who lived a bit farther away were forced to stay in their homes. Jewish prisoners who lived in the settlement outside the camp proper were returned to the camp. At 5:00 on 3 November, the prisoners were mustered for roll call, rounded up, and marched to the Hiwi training camp, where loudspeakers were playing music beside the trenches. The victims were ordered to disrobe and place their clothing in piles, then to lie face down on top of those already shot, and the executioner would dispatch them by a shot to the nape of the neck. Men were shot before women and children. The shooting was already well underway when prisoners from Dorohucza arrived by rail at 7:00. After the trenches were filled, some Jews were executed at a sand pit in the labor camp. The execution of 6,000 Jews occurred continuously until 15:00 (or 17:00), with only a few managing to hide and survive.

===Poniatowa===
Many of the SS and police soldiers who had been at Majdanek continued to Poniatowa, about distant, after the massacre had finished. The units participating in the massacre at Poniatowa included Reserve Police Battalion 101, Motorized Gendarmerie Battalion 1, Police Battalion 41, and Police Battalion 67. There were 14,800 Jews at the camp before the massacre, most of them having come from the Warsaw Ghetto. On 3 November, the Jews were sent back to their barracks after roll call. The camp was sealed and telephone lines were cut, so that the prisoners would not know what fate awaited them. Some thought that there was going to be a selection, and tried to make themselves look healthier. That evening, the camp was surrounded by 1,000–1,500 German and Ukrainian soldiers, who formed three concentric security cordons around the camp by morning.

The next morning (4 November), at 4:30, the prisoners were awoken for roll call. Most were held in Hall 3, except 200 prisoners who were temporarily spared at the insistence of commandant Gottlieb Hering, to clean up after the massacre. They were locked in the camp kitchen. Policemen searched the barracks and factory for anyone who was hiding, and then stood guard on both sides of the (main avenue) in the camp. Prisoners were ordered to strip naked, hand over all valuables, and walk down the Lagerstrasse in groups of 50, starting with the men. As loud music blared, the prisoners were herded to the two trenches by the entrance of the camp, long, wide, and deep. One soldier stood at the beginning of the trench with a whip to encourage the Jews to immediately lie down on top of the bodies of those who had already been shot. Two shooters stood on each of the long sides of the trench, shooting alternately at the victims, each equipped with a bottle of schnapps and an assistant to reload their weapons. According to a witness, many of the victims were not killed and lay wounded in the trench as more bodies piled on top of them, cursing the SS.

Around 14:00, the executions were halted for a lunch break and the drunk executioners were relieved. The trenches turned out to be too shallow and bloody corpses spilled out of the edges. Some prisoners in Poniatowa had formed a resistance group and had acquired a few weapons. At 18:00, a group of around 100 Jews set fire to some barracks full of clothing and then barricaded themselves in another barracks. The Germans set this on fire, killing all of the resistance members. Polish fire fighters were brought in to put out the fires and observed the Germans throwing wounded Jews into the flames. The executions finished around 17:00. Afterward, German soldiers checked the trenches, executing survivors. The corpses were sprinkled with lime and covered with fir branches. Three women survived, climbed out of the mass grave that night, and survived the war with the help of Żegota. Overall, 14,500 people were killed within the span of a few hours.

==Coverup==

Removing all traces of the killing was a priority of the Nazi leadership because of Soviet military victories on the Eastern Front. After the German defeat at Stalingrad, Soviet forces recaptured most of Ukraine, Russia, and eastern Belarus by the end of 1943. At Majdanek, the cleanup took two months and was done under the supervision of Erich Muhsfeldt, previously an executioner at Auschwitz. The 600 men and women from the airfield camp had to sort the clothing of the Jews murdered at Majdanek. Then, the women were deported to Auschwitz and killed in the gas chambers. The men had to cremate the bodies, and they were either killed or recruited into Sonderkommando 1005. Witnesses recalled that for months, the stench of burning flesh hung around the vicinity. The ditches were filled with soil and leveled.

The Jews at Milejowo concentration camp were sent to Trawniki on 5 November to clean up the massacre. Six women had to work in the kitchen while the men were ordered to extract gold teeth and hidden valuables from the corpses. After eight days (or two to three weeks), the men were executed, except for Yehezkel Hering, who disguised himself as a woman and hid with them. The women remained at the camp and sorted the belongings of the murdered Jews until May 1944, when they were deported via Majdanek to Auschwitz and other concentration camps.

About 50 Jews hid from the shootings at Poniatowa, and 150 were left alive after the shooting to clean up and cremate the corpses. Upon refusing to do so, they were shot on 6 November. Therefore, the Ukrainians were ordered to do so, but they were very reluctant and drank heavily. Many deserted and after a week, the remaining Ukrainians refused to do any more. According to Israeli historian David Silberklang, 120 Jews were brought in from Majdanek to do the work. Other reports have 60 to 80 prisoners of Sonderkommando 1005, who took six weeks to accomplish the task under the guard of Police Battalion 316 from Kraśnik. The bodies were dragged from the trenches by teams of horses, and incinerated on grates with wood and gasoline. Six or eight Jews escaped one night, but many of them were later caught and executed. During this process the decomposing corpses smelled very bad and reportedly caused hardened SS men to vomit. Afterward, the Jewish prisoners were executed by men from Police Battalion 101 in Puławy.

==Aftermath and significance==

3 November was dubbed &quot;Bloody Wednesday&quot; by Majdanek prisoners. Following the operation, ten labor camps for Jews in the Lublin District (including Dęblin–Irena and Budzyń) had about 10,000 Jews still alive. The Jews at Budzyń were not executed, despite the camp&#x27;s status as a subcamp of Majdanek. According to survivors, a few Jews were taken from Budzyń to Majdanek, returning with bloody clothing and tales of the massacre. Israeli historian David Silberklang attributes the survival of the camp to the desire of local German functionaries to continue benefiting financially from slave labor and avoid a transfer to the front, but states it is unclear why the camp escaped Himmler&#x27;s notice.

The Harvest Festival operation coincided with other massacres of surviving Jews in Kraków District and Galicia District, including the Wehrmacht camps in Galicia, but spared the forced-labor camps in Radom District which had not been placed under SS command. In the Lublin District, Jews were killed separately at Annopol-Rachów, Puławy, and other smaller sites. The SS enterprise Ostindustrie, which employed many of the murdered prisoners, was not informed in advance; the company was liquidated later in the month. The operation marked the end of Operation Reinhard.

According to Christopher Browning, the minimum estimate of the death toll was 30,500 at Majdanek and Poniatowa, and murder estimates at Trawniki start at 6,000, but may be 8,000 to 10,000. Overall, the operation is variously estimated to have killed 39,000 to 43,000, at least 40,000, 42,000, or 42,000 to 43,000 victims. Measured by death count, Harvest Festival was the single largest massacre of Jews by German forces during the Holocaust. It surpassed the killing of more than 33,000 Jews at Babi Yar outside Kiev and was exceeded only by the 1941 Odessa massacre of more than 50,000 Jews in October 1941, committed by Romanian troops.

After the war, Sporrenberg was tried, convicted, and executed by a Polish court for his role in organizing the operation, while Pütz committed suicide. In 1999, Alfons Gotzfrid was sentenced to time served for his participation in the killings at Majdanek. The Majdanek State Museum has hosted ceremonies to commemorate the victims.

<text>In economics, price dispersion is variation in prices across sellers of the same item, holding fixed the item&#x27;s characteristics. Price dispersion can be viewed as a measure of trading frictions (or, tautologically, as a violation of the law of one price). It is often attributed to consumer search costs or unmeasured attributes (such as the reputation) of the retailing outlets involved. There is a difference between price dispersion and price discrimination. The latter concept involves a single provider charging different prices to different customers for an identical good. Price dispersion, on the other hand, is best thought of as the outcome of many firms potentially charging different prices, where customers of one firm find it difficult to patronize (or are perhaps unaware of) other firms due to the existence of search costs.

Price dispersion measures include the range of prices, the percentage difference of highest and lowest price, the standard deviation of the price distribution, the variance of the price distribution, and the coefficient of variation of the price distribution.

In most theoretical literature, price dispersion is argued as result from spatial difference and the existence of significant search cost. With the development of internet and shopping agent programs, conventional wisdom tells that price dispersion should be alleviated and may eventually disappear in the online market due to the reduced search cost for both price and product features. However, recent studies found a surprisingly high level of price dispersion online, even for standardized items such as books, CDs and DVDs. There is some evidence of a shrinking of this online price dispersion, but it remains significant. Recently, work has also been done in the area of e-commerce, specifically the Semantic Web, and its effects on price dispersion.

Hal Varian, an economist at U. C. Berkeley, argued in a 1980 article that price dispersion may be an intentional marketing technique to encourage shoppers to explore their options.

A related concept is that of wage dispersion.

== Consumer search and price dispersion ==

=== Search alone is insufficient ===

Even when consumers search, price dispersion is not guaranteed. Consumers may search, yet firms set the same price, negating the mere fact of searching. This is referred to as Diamond&#x27;s paradox. 

Assume that many firms provide a homogeneous good. Consumers will randomly sample only one firm if they expect that all firms charge the same price. Consequently, each firm has an equal share of consumers. Since consumers disregard the competitions, each firm acts as a monopoly on its share of consumers. Firms choose a price that maximizes profit: the monopoly price.

=== A necessary condition ===

A recurrent observation is that some consumers must sample one firm and only one, while the remaining consumers must sample at least two firms.

If all of them sample only one firm, then the market faces Diamond&#x27;s Paradox. Firms would ask the same price, and so there would be no price dispersion.

On the contrary, if all consumers sample at least two firms. The most expensive firm will not get any consumer, because consumers know at least another firm that is cheaper. As a result, prices must be as low as possible: equal to marginal costs of production, as in a Bertrand economy.

=== Price dispersion in a non-sequential search model ===

A non-sequential search strategy consists in choosing a number of prices to compare. If consumers follow a non-sequential search strategy, as long as some consumers sample only one firm, then an equilibrium in price dispersion exists.

There is an equilibrium in price dispersion if some consumers search once, and the remaining consumers search more than one firm. Moreover, the distribution of prices has a closed form if consumers search at most two firms:

formula_1

where formula_2; with formula_3 the share of consumer who sample only one firm, formula_4 consumers&#x27; reservation price, and formula_5 firms&#x27; marginal costs of production.

Such an equilibrium in price dispersion occurs when consumers minimize formula_6, with formula_7 the sample size, formula_8 a search cost, and formula_9 the smallest price sampled.

=== Price dispersion in a sequential search model ===

A sequential search strategy consists in sampling prices one by one, and stop after identifying a sufficiently low price. In sequential search models, the existence of perfectly informed consumers guarantees the equilibrium in price dispersion if the remaining consumers search once and only one. There is a continuous relationship between the share of informed consumers and the type of competition: from Bertrand competition to Diamond competition as fewer and fewer consumers are initially perfectly informed.

The distribution of price has a closed form:

formula_10

on support formula_11; where formula_12 the share of perfectly informed consumers, formula_13 the number of firms, formula_14 the revenue function that attains its maximum in formula_15, formula_5 consumers&#x27; reservation price, and formula_17

<doc id="1012637" wikidata="Q5611975" url="?curid=1012637" title="Julian Corbett">
<text>Sir Julian Stafford Corbett (12 November 1854 at Walcot House, Kennington Road, Lambeth – 21 September 1922 at Manor Farm, Stopham, Pulborough, Sussex) was a prominent British naval historian and geostrategist of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, whose works helped shape the Royal Navy&#x27;s reforms of that era. One of his most famous works is &quot;Some Principles of Maritime Strategy&quot;, which remains a classic among students of naval warfare. Corbett was a good friend and ally of naval reformer Admiral John &quot;Jacky&quot; Fisher, the First Sea Lord. He was chosen to write the official history of British Naval operations during World War I.

==Early life and education==
The son of a London architect and property developer, Charles Joseph Corbett, who owned among other properties Imber Court at Weston Green, Thames Ditton, where he made the family home, Julian Corbett was educated at Marlborough College (1869–73) and at Trinity College, Cambridge (1873–76), where he took a first class honours degree in law. Corbett became a barrister at Middle Temple in 1877 and practised until 1882 when he turned to writing as a career. Fascinated by the Elizabethan period, he first wrote historical novels on this period. He became a correspondent for the Pall Mall Gazette, and reported on the Dongola Expedition in 1896. Corbett came to naval history in mid-life and from a civilian background. He was a man of independent means who traveled extensively.

Julian Corbett had three brothers, Herbert E. (1876–??), Edward M. (1899–??) and Frank E. (1881–??). In 1899 he Married Edith Alexander, daughter of George Alexander. They had one son and one daughter.

==Career as a naval historian==
In 1896 Corbett accepted John Knox Laughton&#x27;s request to edit a volume of documents on the Spanish war, 1585–87 which served as the start of his career as a naval historian. He soon became known as one of the Royal Navy&#x27;s leading intellectuals, and from 1901 to 1922 was writing regularly on naval history and strategy. In 1902 he began lecturing at the Royal Naval College, founded in 1900. In 1903 he gave the Ford Lectures in English History at Oxford University. In 1905 he became the Admiralty&#x27;s chief unofficial strategic adviser and served as secretary of the Cabinet Historical Office. Appointed a knight in 1917, he was awarded the Chesney Gold Medal in 1914.

==Work==
Like his American contemporary, Rear Admiral Alfred Thayer Mahan of the U.S. Navy, Corbett saw naval warfare as part of a nation&#x27;s larger policies. In this respect, Prussian military thinker Carl von Clausewitz was an important influence on his work. Another major influence was John Knox Laughton, arguably the first naval historian, and of whom Corbett has been described as his &#x27;protégé&#x27;. Corbett differed from Mahan, however, in placing less emphasis on fleet battle. This stance angered many officers in the Royal Navy, who believed such a view lacked the heroic aspect of Lord Nelson&#x27;s strategy in the Napoleonic Wars.

Corbett&#x27;s primary objective was to fill the void in British naval doctrine by formalizing the theories and principles of naval warfare. The strategies of naval warfare by Corbett focused on the art of naval warfare and defined the differences between land warfare and naval warfare. He set the initial focus towards the employment of manoeuvre type doctrine. Corbett&#x27;s principles of sea control, focus on the enemy, and manoeuvre for tactical advantage form the foundation of today&#x27;s naval manoeuvre warfare.

Corbett was working from within the naval community and trying to influence the naval establishment. He believed in studying and developing the theory of war for educational purposes, which he felt established a &quot;common vehicle of expression and a common plane of thought ... for the sake of mental solidarity between a chief and his subordinates&quot;. Through his lectures at the Naval War College, Corbett was trying to convey to the attending flag officers his ideas of limited war and strategic defence which were very different from the accepted norms of naval theory and strategy of the time. Through his publication of &quot;Some Principles of Maritime Strategy&quot; (1911), Corbett was trying to expand the audience for his strategies and teachings to include the general public.

==Historical context of Corbett&#x27;s work==
At the turn of the century Corbett emerged as one of the first authors in the development of modern naval doctrine. Drawing from the influences of Baron de Jomini and Carl von Clausewitz, he was instrumental in attempting to apply the existing theories of land warfare for war at sea. Clausewitz&#x27;s &quot;On War&quot; was an invaluable basis and stimulus for Corbett&#x27;s theoretical work, however, it was not his blueprint. For example, Corbett did not hesitate to take issue with Clausewitz, Jomini, or other continental strategists on the importance of the search for the decisive battle and the principle of concentration. The fact that Corbett believed these factors to be far less relevant at sea was a daring departure from the accepted wisdom of his time. In developing his theory of limited war, Corbett again used &quot;On War&quot; as his point of departure but ended up with his own, unique method of waging a limited war in a maritime environment.

==Corbett&#x27;s views about war==
Corbett offered no general theory of warfare at sea. Instead, he focused his thoughts on the nature of maritime strategy and what naval warfare meant to the power of a nation. While many theorists of naval warfare tried to mechanically adapt land warfare concepts to the maritime environment, Corbett countered that the interests and requirements of naval warfare differed in fundamental ways from those of land warfare.

Corbett felt that protecting lines of communication was much more difficult to enforce at sea than on land. This difficulty was the physical geographical differences of the sea and land. Because of these physical differences, Corbett analysed naval warfare in its own terms, having its own unique characteristics. Corbett stated that you cannot conquer the sea because it is not susceptible to ownership. This led to Corbett&#x27;s most important contribution to the early theories of naval warfare. What mattered most was not Mahan&#x27;s concept of physical destruction of the enemy, but the act of passage on the sea. To Corbett, command of the sea was a relative and not an absolute which could be categorised as general or local, temporary or permanent. Corbett defined the two fundamental methods of obtaining control of the lines of communication as the actual physical destruction or capture of enemy warships and merchants, and or a naval blockade. Today, this concept is defined as sea control.

Corbett was not infatuated with the search for the decisive battle or with the need for the strategic offensive. In general, he favoured the strategic defensive, with an emphasis on the offensive at the operational level. Corbett&#x27;s strategic defence advocated such measures as an intense local offensive, the projection of land forces, various types of blockades, and raids on enemy trade routes. Moreover, Corbett recognised that once the enemy has been sufficiently weakened on sea and on land, the shift to the strategic offensive should not be delayed.

Corbett did not believe that the concentration of naval forces at sea was the highest and simplest law of strategy. On the contrary, he observed that the principle of concentration had become &quot;a kind of shibboleth&quot; that had done more harm than good. The principle of concentration is &quot;a truism—no one would dispute it. As a canon of practical strategy, it is untrue&quot;. Corbett felt that superior concentration thus not only deterred the weaker opponent from seeking battle but presented him with an opportunity to attack his enemy&#x27;s exposed national lines of communication. Corbett felt that superior concentration of naval forces created yet another serious problem. The greater the concentration of a fleet, the more difficult it was to conceal its whereabouts and movements.

In the process of adapting Clausewitz&#x27;s theory to the unique circumstances of naval warfare, Corbett developed his own innovative theory of limited war in maritime strategy. The first of his two main points was that in wartime conditions on the continent, as opposed to those in the maritime and imperial environment, wars were fought mostly between adjacent states. Corbett&#x27;s second point was that in wars between contiguous continental states &quot;there will be no strategical obstacle to his [the enemy&#x27;s] being able to use his whole force&quot;. In other words, the nature of continental war makes it difficult to limit political aims, because one or both states are able to use all of the means at their disposal to protect the inevitably threatened vital interests. As Corbett demonstrated, this means that the conditions for the ideal limited war exist only in maritime warfare and can only be exploited by the preponderant naval power: &quot; … limited war is only permanently possible to island Powers or between Powers which are separated by sea, and then only when the Power desiring limited war is able to command the sea to such a degree as to be able not only to isolate the distant object, but also to render impossible the invasion of his home territory.&quot;

Like Clausewitz, Corbett shared a belief in the primacy of politics in war and in devising an appropriate strategy to protect the national interests. However, Corbett was interested in the diplomatic alliance systems and coalitions formed before and during a war, and he was concerned with the economic and financial dimensions of waging war as well as with the technological and material aspects of war, which were of no interest to Clausewitz.

==Works of enduring value==
Corbett&#x27;s value for today&#x27;s military professional lies in four of his concepts:
# controlling lines of communications, focus on the enemy, and manoeuvre for tactical advantage;
# the aspects of political, economic and financial dimensions of waging war as well as with the technological and material aspects of war;
# the primacy of politics in war and in devising an appropriate strategy to protect the national interests and
# the emphasis on efficiency in battle while preserving costly assets.
However, his concept of limited war on isolated countries or nation states most likely would be very difficult to achieve with today&#x27;s political and economic intricacies between nations in conjunction with current technologies on a symmetric battlefield. However, they could still be applied on an asymmetric battlefield with success.

==Writing about Corbett==
Beyond the University of London&#x27;s annual award of the Julian Corbett Prize in Naval History, the importance of Corbett&#x27;s contribution to British naval history was largely overlooked until Professor D. M. Schurman published his pioneering work on &quot;The Education of a Navy: the development of British Naval Strategic Thought, 1867–1914&quot; (1965). In 1981, Schurman went on to write a full-length biography of Corbett. Further work on Corbett appeared with John Hattendorf&#x27;s essay &quot;Sir Julian Corbett on the Significance of Naval History&quot; (1971, reprinted 2000) and Goldrick and Hattendorf&#x27;s Conference Proceedings, &quot;Mahan is Not Enough&quot; (1993), followed by the revised biography on Corbett in &quot;The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot; (2004).

These works were complemented by Eric J. Grove&#x27;s definitive, annotated edition of Corbett&#x27;s &quot;Some Principles of Maritime Strategy&quot; (Classics of Sea Power series, U.S. Naval Institute Press, 1988), which included Corbett&#x27;s previously unpublished &#x27;Green Pamphlet&#x27; on strategical terms. In addition, D. M. Schurman and John Hattendorf edited and wrote an introduction to Corbett&#x27;s previously unpublished official study &quot;Maritime Operations in the Russo-Japanese War, 1904–1905&quot; (U.S. Naval Institute, 1994).

<text>Christian Karlson &quot;Karl&quot; Stead (born 17 October 1932) is a New Zealand writer whose works include novels, poetry, short stories, and literary criticism. He is one of New Zealand&#x27;s most well-known and internationally celebrated writers.

==Early life and education==
Stead was born in Auckland, New Zealand, in 1932. He attended Mount Albert Grammar School. He has said that growing up he rarely read New Zealand writers: &quot;I read a few New Zealand writers at school but mainly it was a British education so one read British writers really&quot;. Stead began writing poetry at about age 14 when he read a copy of the collected works of Rupert Brooke, sent by his sister&#x27;s penpal in England.

Stead graduated from the University of Auckland with a Bachelor of Arts in 1954, and earned his Masters of Arts the following year. At this time he and his wife were neighbours with short-story writer Frank Sargeson. Writer Janet Frame was living in a hut in Sargeson&#x27;s garden, having recently been discharged after nine years in a mental hospital. Frame later wrote about this time in her memoir &quot;An Angel at My Table&quot;, and Stead covered the same period in his autobiographical novel &quot;All Visitors Ashore&quot; (1984).

==Academic and literary career==

Stead completed his PhD at the University of Bristol in 1961. From 1959 to 1986, Stead taught at the University of Auckland, becoming the Professor of English in 1968. In 1964, Stead published his first book, &quot;The New Poetic&quot; (1964), based on his PhD study of W. B. Yeats, Ezra Pound, T.S. Eliot and the Georgian poets. It went on to sell over 100,000 copies. His first book of poems, &quot;Whether the Will Is Free: Poems 1954–62&quot;, was published in the same year.

Stead&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Smith&#x27;s Dream&quot;, about a war similar to the Vietnam War in New Zealand, was published in 1971. Stead was an opponent of the Vietnam War. &quot;Smith&#x27;s Dream&quot; provided the basis for the film &quot;Sleeping Dogs&quot;, starring Sam Neill, which became the first New Zealand film released in the United States.

In the 1980s, Stead&#x27;s writings about Māori rights and feminism became the subject of some criticism. For example, in an article published in the &quot;London Review of Books&quot; in December 1986, he wrote that the representation of New Zealand history by Witi Ihimaera in his novel &quot;The Matriarch&quot; (1986) was inaccurate &quot;insofar as it ascribes conscious and malicious intent to the Pakeha and unwillingness to the Maori&quot;, and was highly critical of the novel. In consequence his editorship of the &quot;Faber Book of Contemporary South Pacific Stories&quot; was boycotted by some writers, including Keri Hulme, although Stead denied accusations of racism or being anti-Māori. Stead was active in protests against the 1981 protest against Springboks and was part of the crowd that occupied the field at a game in Hamilton causing its cancellation.

Stead retired from his position as the Professor of English at the University of Auckland in 1986 to write full time, after the success of his novel &quot;All Visitors Ashore&quot; (1984). In the following two decades he wrote a string of internationally successful novels, and twice won the fiction section of the New Zealand Book Awards with &quot;All Visitors Ashore&quot; and &quot;The Singing Whakapapa&quot; (1994). Stead&#x27;s historical novel &quot;Mansfield: A Novel&quot;, based on the life of the writer Katherine Mansfield, was a finalist for the 2005 Tasmania Pacific Fiction Prize and received commendation in the 2005 Commonwealth Writers Prize for the South East Asia and South Pacific region.

Stead has continued to write and receive international accolades well into his seventies and eighties. In 2010 he won the inaugural Sunday Times EFG Private Bank Short Story Award for his short story &quot;Last Season&#x27;s Man&quot;. The short story was subject to some controversy, with literary commentator Fergus Barrowman suggesting that it appeared to be a &quot;revenge fantasy&quot; about Stead&#x27;s rivalry with younger writer Nigel Cox, who had criticised Stead in a 1994 essay. The story was reported on by UK satirical magazine &quot;Private Eye&quot;. Stead in response has said that the story was a work of fiction.

Stead was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire, for services to New Zealand literature, in the 1985 New Year Honours, and was admitted into the highest civilian honour New Zealand can bestow, the Order of New Zealand in the 2007 Special Honours.

In August 2015, Stead was named the New Zealand Poet Laureate for 2015 to 2017. To celebrate the conclusion of Stead&#x27;s term as Poet Laureate, the Alexander Turnbull Library published a signed, limited edition book of his work called &quot;In the Mirror, and Dancing&quot;. The little volume of poems was hand-pressed by Brendan O&#x27;Brien and illustrated with line sketches by New Zealand expatriate artist Douglas MacDiarmid. The book was launched on 8 August 2017 in Wellington, with the assistance of Gregory O&#x27;Brien.

==Personal life==
Stead and his wife Kay have three children. His daughter Charlotte Grimshaw is a well-known New Zealand writer.

<doc id="1012643" wikidata="Q1276896" url="?curid=1012643" title="Herbert Blaize">
<text>Herbert Augustus Blaize PC (26 February 1918 – 19 December 1989) was a Grenadian politician and leader of the Grenada National Party. When Grenada was still a British Crown Colony he served as the first Chief Minister from 1960 to 1961, and again from 1962 to 1967. He became the first Premier of the autonomous Associated State of Grenada briefly in 1967. In the first elections following the 1983 coups and the American-led invasion of Grenada, he served as Prime Minister from 1984 until his death in 1989.

==Early years==
Blaize was born in the island of Carriacou, which along with the island of Petite Martinique is a part of Grenada. He moved to Aruba where he worked many years in the oil refinery of the Lago Oil and Transport Company.

==Grenada National Party==
In 1953 he formed the Grenada National Party as a rival party to the Grenada United Labour Party of Eric Gairy, who would be Blaize&#x27;s main political rival for the next 25 years. Blaize entered the legislature in 1957 and became Minister of Trade and Production.

==Chief Minister and Premier==
He was appointed as Chief Minister in 1960 and held the additional portfolio of finance. He lost power to Gairy in 1961, and was reappointed in 1962 after Gairy was dismissed. In 1967 Grenada became an associated state within the British Empire, gaining more internal self-government.
He was the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives of Grenada from 1974 to 1976.

==In Opposition==
In 1976 Blaize&#x27;s center-right National Party joined forces with the left-wing New Jewel Movement led by Maurice Bishop for the elections that year, which Gairy and the GULP won. The alliance between Blaize and Bishop ended by 1979 when Bishop seized power. Blaize retired from politics and moved back to Carriacou, until after the intervention by the United States in 1983.

==Prime minister==
During the election campaign of 1984, Blaize merged his parties with several other center-right parties to form the New National Party, which took 14 of 15 seats in the election.

In addition to being Prime Minister, Blaize became Minister of Home Affairs, Security, Information, Finance, Trade, Planning, Industrial Development and Carriacou and Petite Martinique Affairs.

Blaize&#x27;s government advocated a strong economic and military alliance for Grenada with the United States, and other overseas investment.

==Death==
He died in December 1989 near St. George&#x27;s, Grenada, following a several-years-long battle with prostate cancer, aged 71. Two days before his death, Blaize had been elected the first party leader of the newly formed National Party.

==Family==
Herbert Blaize was survived by his wife, 
Dame Venetia Blaize, DBE (née Venetia Ursula Davidson); three daughters, Norma Blaize (a former Consul-General of Grenada in New York), Carol Jerome and Marion Fleary; three sons, Samuel Blaize, Marvin Blaize and Christopher Blaize. He was also survived by a sister, Muriel Noel.

<text>World Park Base was a non-governmental year-round Antarctic base located at Cape Evans on Ross Island in the Ross Dependency. The international environmental organization Greenpeace established World Park Base in 1987 in order to press its demand for the Antarctic Treaty nations to declare the continent of Antarctica as a World Park. This would make the entire continent off-limits to commercial exploitation and pollution, and permit only limited scientific research. Greenpeace closed the base down in 1991 and completely dismantled the base in 1992.

The official attitude amongst the Antarctic Treaty nations was that World Park Base was to be ignored and that no assistance be given to it, although New Zealand, which claims jurisdiction over Ross Dependency (though all territorial claims are in abeyance under the Antarctic Treaty), would have assisted if a life-threatening situation arose.

<doc id="1012668" wikidata="Q642189" url="?curid=1012668" title="Medtronic">
<text>Medtronic plc is an American-Irish medical device company. The company&#x27;s operational and executive headquarters are in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and its legal headquarters are in Ireland due to its acquisition of Irish-based Covidien in 2015. While it primarily operates in the United States, it operates in more than 150 countries and employs over 90,000 people. It develops and manufactures healthcare technologies and therapies. It is one of the biggest medical tech companies in the world and is currently the largest medical device company in the world by revenue. 

The company has developed several world-first technologies since its inception, including wearable and implantable pacemakers, the implantable cardioverter defibrillator, and remote monitoring systems. They also created miniaturized devices like the world&#x27;s smallest pacemaker and spinal cord stimulator.

==History==

Medtronic was founded in 1949 in Minneapolis by Earl Bakken and his brother-in-law, Palmer Hermundslie, as a medical equipment repair shop. Bakken invented several medical technology devices that continue to be used around the world today.

Through his repair business, Bakken came to know C. Walton Lillehei, a doctor of heart surgery at the University of Minnesota Medical School. The deficiencies of the artificial pacemakers of the day were made painfully obvious following a power outage over Halloween in 1957, which affected large sections of Minnesota and western Wisconsin. A pacemaker-dependent paediatric patient of Lillehei died because of the blackout. The next day, Lillehei spoke with Bakken about developing some form of battery-powered pacemaker. Bakken modified the design for a transistorized metronome and created the first battery-powered external pacemaker. It fit in a four-inch-square box that could be taped to a patient&#x27;s chest, transmitted electric signals to the heart through wires that passed through the patient&#x27;s chest, and could be removed without surgery.

The company expanded through the 1950s, selling equipment built by other companies but also developing custom-made devices. Bakken built a small pacemaker that could be strapped to the body and powered by batteries. Work in the new field later produced an implantable pacemaker in 1960. The company built its headquarters in the Minneapolis suburb of St. Anthony, Minnesota, in 1960, and moved to Fridley in the 1970s. Medtronic&#x27;s main competitors in the cardiac rhythm field include Boston Scientific and St. Jude Medical.

In 1997, Medtronic opened a production site for implantable pacemakers and brain pacemakers in Tolochenaz, Switzerland. One in five pacemakers implanted globally today is made here. The site is also used as a European training centre for doctors. 

In 1998, Medtronic acquired Physio-Control for $538 million.

In 2014, Integra LifeSciences announced it was acquiring instrumentation lines from Medtronic for $60 million. The deal included Medtronic&#x27;s MicroFrance and Xomed manual ENT and laparoscopic surgical instruments, as well as a manufacturing facility in France.

In February 2016, the company announced that it would acquire Bellco from private equity firm Charme Capital Partners. In June, the company announced its acquisition of HeartWare International Inc. for $1.1 billion. In December 2017, Medtronic acquired Crospon in €38 million ($45 million). In September 2018, the company acquired Mazor Robotics for $1.64 billion ($58.50 per American Depository Share or $29.25 per ordinary share. In late November, Medtronic acquired Nutrino Health Ltd boosting the company&#x27;s nutrition-related data services and analytics.

In May 2019, Medtronic announced it would acquire Titan Spine, a technology company focusing on titanium spine implants.
Chief Executive Officer Omar Ishrak retired in April 2020 and stayed on as executive chairman and chairman of the board until December 2020. Ishrak was succeeded by senior executive Geoff Martha.

In January 2020, the company announced its intention to acquire Stimgenics, LLC and their primary therapy: differential target, multiplexed, spinal cord stimulation. In July, the company announced it would acquire Medicrea for €7.00 per share. In August, Medtronic announced it would acquire Companion Medical, who manufacture a smart insulin pen system, which connects to a diabetes management app. In September Medtronic acquired Avenu Medical for an undisclosed sum.

In February 2021, the company recalled its HeartWare Ventricular Assist Device. In June 2021, the controller ports were pulled from the market. On 3 June 2021, the FDA alerted physicians to stop new implants of the HVAD system due to &quot;an increased risk of neurological adverse events and mortality associated with the internal pump.&quot;

In January 2022, the business announced it would acquire Affera, Inc. In March, Medtronic announced a contract with Vizient, a healthcare performance improvement company, to add Medtronic&#x27;s Touch Surgery Enterprise platform to Vizient&#x27;s healthcare offerings. Touch Surgery works with laparoscopic and robotic scopes and is an AI-powered video management and analytics platform for the operating room. In May, Medtronic and DaVita Inc. announced plans to form a new, independent kidney care-focused medical device company. Medtronic&#x27;s Renal Care Solutions business will be part of the new company.

In April 2022, the company announced that it would work with GE Healthcare to support the needs and care demands at Ambulatory Surgery Centers. In July, Medtronic announced a strategic partnership with CathWorks, a coronary artery disease (CAD) technology developer. A separate agreement gave Medtronic the option to acquire CathWorks in the future.

==Global rankings==
In May 2018, Medtronic was ranked as the world&#x27;s largest medical device company by 2017 revenues (see table below).

In March 2017, Bloomberg&#x27;s database of U.S. tax inversions listed Medtronic and Wright Medical Group (Medtronic&#x27;s 2015 inversion to Ireland was over $100 billion, while Wright&#x27;s 2015 inversion to the Netherlands was $3.3 billion), as the only U.S. tax inversions of a U.S. medical device company in history. In February 2018, the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; listed Medtronic&#x27;s 2015 tax inversion to Ireland as the largest U.S. corporate tax inversion executed between 2013 and 2016. In May 2018, Medtronic was ranked as the largest corporate tax inversion in history.

In November 2021, the company was added to the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index.

==Business units and subsidiaries==
Medtronic has four main business units: the Minimally Invasive Therapies Group, the Diabetes Group, the Restorative Therapies Group, and the Cardiac and Vascular Group. Medtronic develops and manufactures devices and therapies to treat more than 30 chronic diseases, including heart failure, Parkinson disease, urinary incontinence, Down syndrome, obesity, chronic pain, spinal disorders and diabetes.

===Acute Care &amp; Monitoring===
Acute Care &amp; Monitoring (ACM) is based out of Lafayette, Colorado and produces non-invasive sensors and monitoring products, used for patient monitoring in the hospital and home settings. It has absorbed the portfolios of acquired companies, including Covidien, Nellcor, Somanetics, Aspect Medical Systems, Oridion Medical and Zephyr Technology. This business unit produces pulse oximetry, capnography, and bispectral index sensors, patient monitors, remote patient monitoring software, and electronic medical record connectivity software.

===CRDM===
Cardiac rhythm disease management (CRDM) is the oldest and largest of Medtronic&#x27;s business units. Its work in heart rhythm therapies dates back to 1957 when Bakken developed the first wearable heart pacemaker to treat abnormally slow heart rates. Since then, it has expanded its expertise in electrical stimulation to treat other cardiac rhythm diseases. It has also made an effort to address overall disease management by adding diagnostic and monitoring capabilities to many of its devices. An independently-operating Dutch pacemaker manufacturer, Vitatron, acquired by Medtronic in 1986, is now a European subsidiary of the unit. Medtronic and Vitatron pacemakers are interrogated and programmed by Medtronic Carelink Model 2090 Programmer for Medtronic and Vitatron Devices; they use separate interfaces.

In 2007, Medtronic recalled its Sprint Fidelis product, the flexible wires, or leads, which connect a defibrillator to the interior of the heart. The leads were found to be failing at an unacceptable rate, resulting in unnecessary shocks or no shocks when needed; either can be lethal. The scope of the problem continues to be a matter of research. Studies since the recall, disputed by Medtronic, suggest that the failure rate of already-implanted Sprint Fidelis leads is increasing exponentially. Medtronic&#x27;s liability is limited by various court decisions.

===Spinal and biologics===
Spinal and biologics is Medtronic&#x27;s second-largest business. Medtronic is the world leader in spinal and musculoskeletal therapies. In 2007, Medtronic purchased Kyphon, a manufacturer and seller of spinal implants that are necessary for procedures like kyphoplasty.

In May 2008, Medtronic Spine agreed to pay the US government $75 million to settle a qui tam lawsuit after a whistleblower alleged that Medtronic committed Medicare fraud. The company was charged with illegally convincing healthcare providers to offer kyphoplasty, a spinal fracture repair surgery, as an inpatient, not an outpatient, procedure to make thousands of dollars more in profits per surgery.

A &quot;special report&quot; by writer Steven Brill in &quot;Time&quot; showed that according to Medtronic&#x27;s quarterly SEC filing of October 2012, the company had, on average, a 75.1% profit margin on its spine products and therapies.

===Cardiovascular===
Medtronic&#x27;s cardiovascular therapies span the major specialties of interventional cardiology, cardiac surgery, and vascular surgery. The products are used to reduce the potentially debilitating effects of coronary, aortic, and structural heart disease.

===Neuromodulation===
Neuromodulation is the second-oldest and third-largest department of Medtronic. Its products include neurostimulation systems and implantable drug delivery systems for chronic pain, common movement disorders, and urologic and gastrointestinal disorders. The department&#x27;s revenues in 2014 amounted to $1.9 billion, or 11% of Medtronic&#x27;s total revenues.

===Diabetes===
The diabetes management manufacturing and sales division of Medtronic is based on the perimeter of the California State University, Northridge campus in Northridge, California. The original company, Minimed Technologies, was founded in 1983 by Alfred E. Mann and spun off from Pacesetter Systems to design and market an open loop insulin pump. The MiniMed 502 was one of the first lightweight insulin pumps on the market, and it helped bring insulin pump usage to the mainstream market.

In 1992, the MiniMed 506 was a major redesign to make it more appealing to consumers. The new design was met by boosted adoption rate, and sales increased by 357%. In 2001, Medtronic purchased Minimed, to form Medtronic Minimed.

On 11 May 2009, Medtronic announced it had chosen San Antonio, Texas, for the location of its new Diabetes Therapy Management and Education Center. The company announced that it expected 1400 new jobs would be created to staff the facility.

In September 2016, the FDA approved a device, the MiniMed 670G which was launched in 2017. It was the world&#x27;s first Hybrid Closed Loop system for people with type 1 diabetes. Featuring the company&#x27;s advanced algorithm - SmartGuard technology and glucose sensor - Guardian™ Sensor 3, it was the first insulin pump approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that enabled personalized and automated* delivery of basal insulin, the background insulin needed to maintain stable blood sugar levels throughout the day and night. The advanced SmartGuard Auto Mode algorithm worked in conjunction with the company&#x27;s glucose sensor - Guardian Sensor 3 - to self-adjust basal insulin delivery based on the glucose sensor.

===Surgical technologies===

The surgical technologies business group designed and manufactured products for the diagnosis and treatment of ear, nose, and throat (ENT) diseases and cranial, spinal, and neurologic conditions. It also encompassed a surgical navigation division to design &quot;StealthStation&quot; systems, software, and instruments for computer assisted surgery (CAS) and a special intraoperative X-ray imaging system (3D fluoroscopy), known as the O-arm Imaging System. Many of the products are used for minimally-invasive surgical procedures. In 2016, the business unit was dissolved, and each site folded into new business groups.

===Renal Care Solutions===
The Renal Care Solutions business group designed and manufactured products for the diagnosis and treatment related to Renal organs like Kidney. In 2023 this business unit was spun off into an independent business called Mozarc Medical.

===Technology safety===
In 2011, an independent security researcher, Jay Radcliffe, revealed a security vulnerability in a Medtronic insulin pump at the Computer Security conference Black Hat Briefings, allowing an attacker to take control of the pump. Medtronic responded by assuring users of the full safety of its devices.

In 2008, a team of computer security researchers was able to take remote control of a Medtronic cardiac implant. The team, using an unused implant in a lab, was able to control the electrical shocks delivered by the defibrillator component and even glean patient data from the device.

In February 2020, Medtronic recalled around 322,000 MiniMed insulin pumps with faulty pump retainer rings, which had been correlated to death and around 2,000 injuries.

===Portable ventilators===
On 30 March 2020, Medtronic shared its portable ventilator design specifications during the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, in order to accelerate global ventilator production.

=== Subsidiaries ===

==== Vitatron ====
Vitatron is a Netherlands-based European subsidiary of Medtronic. It is focused on development and manufacturing of cardiac pacing technology. Once an independently operating Dutch medical company, it was acquired by Medtronic in 1986.
Vitatron pacemakers are interrogated and programmed by Medtronic Carelink Model 2090 Programmer for Medtronic and Vitatron Devices, using a separate interface.

== Public-private engagement ==

=== Activism ===
Medtronic is a corporate partner of Human Rights Campaign, a large LGBT advocacy organization.

==Criticism==

===Animal rights===
In 2005, 2008, and 2010 PETA threatened to submit a shareholder resolution to improve animal welfare standards in the company. In 2005, PETA attempted to stop five specific animal experiments that it deemed &quot;crude and cruel&quot;. In 2008, PETA protested the outsourcing of animal testing to countries with lax animal welfare laws, such as China. In 2010, PETA attempted to stop Medtronic&#x27;s reported use of live animals in testing and training. In response, Medtronic conducted a feasibility study that found that banning the use of live animals was impractical. As of 2015 Medtronic continued to use live animals for testing and training but stated that it would look for alternatives in the future. In each case, PETA withdrew its shareholder resolution after talks with Medtronic&#x27;s leadership.

===Tax inversion to Ireland===


In June 2014, Medtronic announced it would execute a tax inversion to Ireland by acquiring Irish-based Covidien (a previous U.S. tax inversion to Ireland in 2007), for $42.9 billion in cash and stock. The tax inversion enabled Medtronic to move its legal headquarters to Ireland, while maintaining its operational and executive headquarters in the U.S., thus allowing it to avoid taxation on more than $14 billion held overseas, and avail of Ireland&#x27;s beneficial low corporation tax regime. Medtronic&#x27;s tax inversion is the largest tax inversion in history, and given the changes in the U.S. tax-code in 2016 to block the Pfizer-Allergan Irish tax inversion, is likely to remain the largest. Medtronic CEO Omar Ishrak defended the tax inversion in a 2015 interview to the &quot;Financial Times&quot; saying, &quot;We just followed the rules and the deal was done based on strategic merits&quot;. Ireland is less than 0.1% of Medtronic (or Covidien) sales, and the majority of Medtronic&#x27;s sales, and an even greater percentage of Medtronic profits (due to the higher margins on U.S. medical devices), are from the U.S. healthcare system. In 2016, the &quot;Star Tribune&quot; reported that Medtronic was still winning U.S. Federal contracts and attending U.S. trade-missions as a U.S. company.

In terms of scale, on 23 November 2018, Ireland&#x27;s largest stockbrokers, &quot;Davy Stockbrokers&quot; reported that the total capitalization of the Irish stock market was €104 billion (this does not include Medtronic, which Davy do not consider an Irish company). In contrast, on the same day Medtronic&#x27;s capitalization was listed on Bloomberg at just over $130 billion (or €115 billion).

Medtronic&#x27;s acquisition of Covidien made Medtronic the world&#x27;s largest medical device company by revenues.

===Response to 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine===
During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Medtronic refused to join the international community and withdraw from the Russian market. Research from Yale University updated on 28 April 2022, identifying how companies were reacting to Russia&#x27;s invasion identified Medtronic in the worst category of &quot;Digging In&quot;, meaning Defying Demands for Exit: companies defying demands for exit/reduction of activities.

<text>Dinocephalosaurus (meaning &quot;terrible-headed reptile&quot;) is a genus of long necked, aquatic protorosaur that inhabited the Triassic seas of China. The genus contains the type and only known species, D. orientalis, which was named by Chun Li in 2003. Unlike other long-necked protorosaurs (which form a group known as the tanystropheids), &quot;Dinocephalosaurus&quot; convergently evolved a long neck not through elongation of individual neck vertebrae, but through the addition of neck 
vertebrae that each had a moderate length. As indicated by phylogenetic analyses, it belonged in a separate lineage that also included at least its closest relative &quot;Pectodens&quot;, which was named the Dinocephalosauridae in 2021. Like tanystropheids, however, &quot;Dinocephalosaurus&quot; probably used its long neck to hunt, utilizing the fang-like teeth of its jaws to ensnare prey; proposals that it employed suction feeding have not been universally accepted. It was probably a marine animal by necessity, as suggested by the poorly-ossified and paddle-like limbs which would have prevented it from going ashore.

Specimens belonging to the genus were first discovered in a locality near Xinmin in Guizhou, China in 2002. At the same locality, which dates to 244 million years ago, other marine reptiles such as &quot;Mixosaurus&quot;, &quot;Keichousaurus&quot;, and &quot;Wumengosaurus&quot; have also been found. While the type specimen consisted only of a skull and the very front of the neck, additional specimens soon revealed the complete form of the body. Further discoveries of &quot;Dinocephalosaurus&quot; specimens were made in Luoping, Yunnan, China, starting in 2008. At this locality, &quot;Dinocephalosaurus&quot; would have lived alongside &quot;Mixosaurus&quot;, &quot;Dianopachysaurus&quot;, and &quot;Sinosaurosphargis&quot;. One specimen discovered at the Luoping locality preserves an embryo within its abdomen, indicating that &quot;Dinocephalosaurus&quot; gave birth to live young like many other marine reptiles. &quot;Dinocephalosaurus&quot; is the only known member of the Archosauromorpha to give live birth, with the possible exception of the metriorhynchids, a group of marine crocodylomorphs.

==Discovery and naming==
===Panxian===

The type specimen of &quot;Dinocephalosaurus&quot; was first discovered in 2002, during fieldwork conducted in Yangjuan Village, Xinmin District, Panxian County, Guizhou, China. It consists of a nearly-complete skull missing the left side of the jaw, as well as several associated cervical vertebrae. It was subsequently stored at the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology (IVPP) in Beijing, China under the collection number IVPP V13767, and a research paper describing the specimen was authored by IVPP paleontologist Chun Li and published by &quot;Acta Geologica Sinica&quot; in December 2003.

A second specimen discovered at the same locality represents a partially articulated skeleton that is only lacking the tail. Likewise stored at the IVPP, the specimen has the collection number IVPP V13898. The specimen was described in a brief correspondence authored by Li, Olivier Rieppel, and Michael LaBarbera that was published by &quot;Science&quot; in September 2004; a more detailed description was subsequently published by Rieppel, Li, Nicholas Fraser in a 2008 &quot;Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology&quot; paper.

The Panxian locality, from where these specimens originated, is part of Member II of the Anisian (Middle Triassic) Guanling Formation, which was initially thought to be 230 million years old, but has most recently been dated to 244 ± 1.3 million years old based on uranium–lead dating. Predominant deposits at this locality are composed of grey to dark grey marly limestone, as well as cherty limestone containing dolomite and bentonite beds. &quot;Dinocephalosaurus&quot; was specifically found in layer 90 of the Panxian deposits, a thin limestone layer which is traditionally assigned to the Upper Reptile Horizon (layers 87–90). Further below are the Middle Reptile (layers 81–85) and Lower Reptile (77–79) Horizons.

===Luoping===

Subsequently, additional &quot;Dinocephalosaurus&quot; specimens were discovered from the slightly older Luoping locality, which has been dated to 245–244 million years old based on conodont biostratigraphy as well as preliminary radiometric dating. The specimens originate from bed 74 of the Luoping locality, in deposits located near the village of Dawazi, Luoping County, Yunnan, China. Bed 74 is part of a section composed of thin dark grey micritic limestone layers mixed with thicker layers of siliceous limestone and silty limestone, which extends downwards to bed 67.

One particular specimen is notable for containing an embryo in its abdominal region, of which cervical vertebrae, forelimbs, and several other elements are preserved. It was collected in 2008; by the time of its collection, weathering had already split the specimen into three blocks, with the gaps having been filled by modern soil. The specimen was then transferred to the Chengdu Center of the China Geological Survey, where it was prepared and stored under the collection number LPV 30280. Subsequently, a description of the specimen, authored by Jun Liu, Chris Organ, Michael Benton, Matthew Brandley, and Jonathan Aitchison, was published in February 2017 by &quot;Nature Communications&quot;.

At least one additional undescribed specimen of &quot;Dinocephalosaurus&quot; is known from an unspecified locality, having been catalogued as ZMNH M8752 in the Zhejiang Museum of Natural History. It was briefly mentioned in comparison to &quot;Fuyuansaurus&quot; by Fraser, Rieppel, and Li in 2013. Furthermore, another embryonic skeleton catalogued as IVPP V22788 was found at Luoping, and was considered by them to be closely related to &quot;Dinocephalosaurus&quot; on account of its large number of short neck vertebrae and its pillar-like limbs. However, they also noted some differences that were likely unrelated to growth, such as the presence of fewer (24 instead of 33) neck vertebrae and the presence of a sclerotic ring, which led them to assign it to not &quot;Dinocephalosaurus&quot; but a closely related animal.

===Naming===
In his 2003 description, Li combined the roots of &quot;din-&quot; (&quot;terrible&quot;), &quot;cephalo-&quot; (&quot;head&quot;), and &quot;saur&quot; (&quot;lizard&quot;) to create the genus name &quot;Dinocephalosaurus&quot;. According to Li, this name refers to the &quot; skull&quot; of the holotype. Meanwhile, the species name is derived from Latin &quot;&quot; (&quot;eastern&quot;), in reference to &quot;D. orientalis&quot; representing the only known record at the time of the Tanystropheidae in what would have been the eastern portion of the Tethys Ocean.

==Description==

&quot;Dinocephalosaurus&quot; was a very large non-crocopodan archosauromorph, attaining a maximum body length of up to , compared to a maximum of for &quot;Tanystropheus&quot;. The known specimens were probably mature, given that they have fused skull bones and lack the multi-cusped teeth seen in juvenile &quot;Tanystropheus&quot;.

===Skull===

The skull of &quot;Dinocephalosaurus&quot; was low and narrow, with a long premaxilla and maxilla compared to those of &quot;Tanystropheus&quot;. Both the premaxilla and the maxilla met at the front bottom corner and contributed to the border of the nostril, which was located at the front end of a long recess that extended along the snout in front of the eye socket (the antorbital depression). This recess was also present in &quot;Macrocnemus&quot; and &quot;Fuyuansaurus&quot;. Like &quot;Pectodens&quot;, the thickness of the premaxilla meant that the nostrils were retracted from the tip of the snout. The bottom margins of the two snout bones were respectively lined with five and twelve long and nail-like teeth; the third premaxillary and fourth and fifth maxillary teeth were distinctly fang-like. The lower jaw preserves fifteen teeth, with three of them having been fang-like and forming a &quot;fish trap&quot;. By comparison, the teeth in adult &quot;Tanystropheus&quot; were sharp pegs, while they were tricuspid (bearing three cusps) in juveniles.

Unlike the oval-shaped eye socket of &quot;Tanystropheus&quot;, the eye socket of &quot;Dinocephalosaurus&quot; appears to have been peach-shaped, with a narrow front end. On the top of the skull, the parietal was broad and flattened, bearing no trace of the midline crest found in &quot;Tanystropheus&quot;. The jugal only had two processes, missing the third backward-projecting process present in most other archosauromorphs, but shared with &quot;Pectodens&quot;, &quot;Claudiosaurus&quot;, and &quot;Trilophosaurus&quot;. Also missing were the retroarticular process of the rear lower jaw (another point of distinction from &quot;Tanystropheus&quot;), as well as additional teeth and a cavity between the pterygoid bones on the palate.

===Neck and trunk===

Like &quot;Tanystropheus&quot;, &quot;Dinocephalosaurus&quot; had an exceptionally long neck ( long) relative to its torso ( excluding the tail). &quot;Tanystropheus&quot; and &quot;Dinocephalosaurus&quot; accomplished their extremely elongated necks in different ways. The neck of &quot;Tanystropheus&quot; was composed of 13 elongated neck vertebrae, whereas the neck of &quot;Dinocephalosaurus&quot; was composed of at least 27 neck vertebrae that were not as elongated. Among the 27 vertebrae of &quot;Dinocephalosaurus&quot;, the longest was the nineteenth, which measured approximately long. By comparison, the longest vertebrae in a Chinese specimen of &quot;Tanystropheus&quot; were the ninth and tenth, which measured long. Additionally, the neck vertebrae of &quot;Dinocephalosaurus&quot; were not hollow, unlike those of &quot;Tanystropheus&quot;.

Additional features of the neck vertebrae which distinguished &quot;Dinocephalosaurus&quot; from other protorosaurs included the low and keel-like neural spines with concave top edges, and the front and rear articular surfaces of the vertebrae both being concave (amphicoelous). In the first ten neck vertebrae, the bottom margin was also concave. The long, slender neck ribs bore frontal projections free of the vertebral bodies, which was a rare feature otherwise seen only in &quot;Pectodens&quot;, &quot;Czatkowiella&quot;, &quot;Sclerostropheus&quot;, and &quot;Tanytrachelos&quot;. These ribs were aligned along the neck and bridged multiple consecutive vertebral joints, from two or three consecutive joints in the front of the neck to five or six in the rear of the neck. There appear to have been no distinct processes on the vertebrae for articulation with the ribs.

The trunk of &quot;Dinocephalosaurus&quot; had a very high count of least 26 vertebrae. In &quot;Dinocephalosaurus&quot;, there appear to have been no lumbar vertebrae, or vertebrae of the trunk lacking ribs. The ribs of the sacrum and tail also do not appear to have been fused to their corresponding vertebrae. Each of the gastralia in &quot;Dinocephalosaurus&quot; was composed of three elements instead of four as in &quot;Tanystropheus&quot;; they differed in that &quot;Dinocephalosaurus&quot; only had one element on the midline, while &quot;Tanystropheus&quot; had two elements that combined to form a midline bar.

===Limbs===
&quot;Dinocephalosaurus&quot; had relatively large legs terminating in flipper-like feet. The forelimbs and hindlimbs are roughly the same length, unlike &quot;Tanystropheus&quot; where the forelimbs were much smaller. Whereas most protorosaurs, such as &quot;Tanystropheus&quot;, &quot;Macrocnemus&quot;, and &quot;Langobardisaurus&quot;, had relatively ossified limbs adapted for terrestrial life, the stout limbs of &quot;Dinocephalosaurus&quot; were poorly ossified and resembled those of nothosaurs. Out of the carpal bones, only six were ossified; similarly, only three of the tarsal bones were ossified. Additionally, the astragalus and calcaneum also did not articulate with each other in the ankle, instead forming simple and rounded ossifications. Another adaptation to aquatic life was the loss of an opening known as the thyroid fenestra in the pelvis due to the rounded pelvic bones, which was also present in &quot;Fuyuansaurus&quot;.

These traits were probably neotenic, which similarly characterizes traits found in many other aquatic tetrapods. While &quot;Tanystropheus&quot; was likely also neotenic, it did not approach &quot;Dinocephalosaurus&quot; in the extremity of this condition. Several other peculiar traits were present in the feet of &quot;Dinocephalosaurus&quot;. Unlike &quot;Tanystropheus&quot; and most other protorosaurs, the fifth metatarsal of &quot;Dinocephalosaurus&quot; was simple and straight instead of hooked. &quot;Tanystropheus&quot; had a fifth metatarsal which was mildly thickened at the top end, and it additionally possessed a long phalanx on the fifth digit that acted not unlike another metatarsal. On the third digit of the foot of &quot;Dinocephalosaurus&quot;, there were four phalanges, but none of them appear to have been the terminal claw. This suggests that &quot;Dinocephalosaurus&quot; had a higher-than-average count of at least five phalanges in the third digit.

==Classification==
&quot;Dinocephalosaurus&quot; was considered to be a member of the Protorosauria, a group of ubiquitous and diverse Permo-Triassic reptiles. This assignment was based upon characteristics including the low and narrow skull with a short and narrow postorbital region; the long nasal bone relative to the frontal bone; the reduced backward projection of the jugal; the presence of more than seven neck vertebrae, with centra (bodies) longer than those of the trunk vertebrae; the low neural spines of the neck vertebrae; the long neck ribs; the lack of articulating with the centra of the trunk vertebrae; and the absence of an entepicondylar foramen on the humerus. These characteristics were shared with &quot;Tanystropheus&quot;, &quot;Macrocnemus&quot;, and other protorosaurs.
Protorosaurs were formerly considered to be the ancestors of lizards, but phylogenetic analysis has subsequently verified that they were in fact non-archosaur archosauromorphs. As originally defined, the Protorosauria referred to the group containing &quot;Protorosaurus&quot; and &quot;Prolacerta&quot;, and included the &quot;Prolacertiformes&quot; as a subdivision. In 1997, Nour-Eddine Jalil conducted an analysis of the &quot;Prolacertiformes&quot;; this analysis expanded its definition to include 14 genera, including the Tanystropheidae. Subsequent research has generally found that &quot;Prolacerta&quot; was closer to the Archosauriformes than &quot;Protorosaurus&quot;, making the &quot;Prolacertiformes&quot; non-monophyletic (i.e., composed of several groups that were not sister groups). This research also suggested that the remaining protorosaurs – including &quot;Protorosaurus&quot;, tanystropheids, and drepanosaurs in some studies – did not necessarily form a monophyletic group. An increasing number of analyses have found a non-monophyletic Protorosauria with &quot;Protorosaurus&quot; as being more basal (less specialised) than the Tanystropheidae, and drepanosaurs outside Archosauromorpha altogether.

In the original description of &quot;Dinocephalosaurus&quot;, Li recognized the postorbital region and the elongated cervical centra as being indicative of a close relationship with &quot;Tanystropheus&quot;, which led him to assign it to the Tanystropheidae. However, Rieppel and colleagues subsequently noted characteristics that distinguished &quot;Dinocephalosaurus&quot; from derived protorosaurs such as &quot;Tanystropheus&quot;, &quot;Macrocnemus&quot;, &quot;Langobardisaurus&quot;, and &quot;Tanytrachelos&quot;; these include the lack of tapering at the front end of the nasal and an unreduced contribution of the ilium to the acetabulum. This led Rieppel and colleagues to consider &quot;Dinocephalosaurus&quot; as an indeterminate protorosaur, with its neck elongation having been convergent upon that of &quot;Tanystropheus&quot;. Their phylogenetic tree, based on a dataset derived from the separate analyses of Jalil (1997), David Dilkes (1998), and Michael Benton &amp; Jackie Allen (1997), is reproduced below, at left.

Topology A: Rieppel &quot;et al.&quot; (2008)

Topology B: Liu &quot;et al.&quot; (2017)


Liu and colleagues published a separate phylogenetic analysis in 2017. They criticized the analysis of Rieppel and colleagues as having unnecessarily repeated several characters in their data, thus imbuing the repeated characters with undue weight in the analysis. In their own analysis, Liu and colleagues used the same source datasets, but deleted repeated characters, added two new characters from an analysis by Sean Modesto and Hans-Dieter Sues (2004), and removed poorly preserved or potentially chimeric taxa such as &quot;Cosesaurus&quot;, &quot;Kadimakara&quot;, &quot;Trachelosaurus&quot;, and &quot;Malerisaurus&quot;. Analyses based on parsimony-based and Bayesian methods found that &quot;Dinocephalosaurus&quot; was a member of the Tanystropheidae, being the sister group to a monophyletic group containing &quot;Tanystropheus&quot;, &quot;Macrocnemus&quot;, &quot;Langobardisaurus&quot;, and &quot;Tanytrachelos&quot;. The analyses also recovered a monophyletic Protorosauria, albeit to the exclusion of &quot;Prolacerta&quot;. The tree from the parsimony-based analysis is reproduced above, at right.

Several subsequent studies found &quot;Dinocephalosaurus&quot; to have been closely related to but outside the Tanystropheidae. Martín Ezcurra and Richard J. Butler published a phylogenetic analysis based on a different dataset in 2018, which included all archosauromorphs from the middle Permian to the early Late Triassic known at the time. They also found that &quot;Dinocephalosaurus&quot; in a polytomy with Tanystropheidae and &quot;Trachelosaurus&quot;. &quot;Jesairosaurus&quot; was found to be the most closely related genus to this polytomy. In 2020, Tiane De-Oliveira and colleagues added &quot;Dinocephalosaurus&quot;, &quot;Jesairosaurus&quot;, and &quot;Elessaurus&quot; to another dataset published by Adam Pritchard and colleagues in 2018, while also introducing modifications based on Ezcurra and Butler&#x27;s dataset. Although their phylogenetic analysis recovered a poorly-resolved tree with a large polytomy, they found that &quot;Dinocephalosaurus&quot; and &quot;Jesairosaurus&quot; formed a group that was basal to Tanystropheidae and other archosauromorphs.
In 2021, Stephan Spiekman and colleagues introduced yet another dataset specifically to test the phylogenetic relationships of protorosaurs. Different analyses were performed using datasets that incorporated different species and anatomical characteristics. They found that &quot;Dinocephalosaurus&quot; and &quot;Pectodens&quot; consistently formed a group, which they named as the Dinocephalosauridae. Some analyses (specifically, those excluding characters based on ratios or with orderings) also found that either &quot;Sclerostropheus&quot; and &quot;&quot;Tanystropheus&quot; antiquus&quot; fell inside this group. Either &quot;Fuyuansaurus&quot; or &quot;Jesairosaurus&quot; were found to be the closest relative of the dinocephalosaurids in some analyses. With the exception of &quot;Jesairosaurus&quot;, these genera of uncertain placement were found to be deeply nested within the Tanystropheidae by other analyses. Providing formal support for the original hypothesis of Rieppel and colleagues, Spiekman and colleagues found that placing &quot;Dinocephalosaurus&quot; as the sister group of &quot;Tanystropheus&quot; required a tree that was six steps longer, and therefore less likely.

In 2024, Spiekman and colleagues published a redescription of &quot;Dinocephalosaurus&quot;, including a description of five additional new specimens. Using an updated version of Spiekman&#x27;s previous dataset, they recovered similar phylogenetic relationships, with &quot;Dinocephalosaurus&quot; forming a clade with &quot;Pectodens&quot; outside of the Tanystropheidae. The following cladogram shows the results of their analysis that included ratio and ordered characters, excluding &quot;&quot;T. antiquus&quot;, &quot;T.&quot; &quot;conspicuus&quot;&quot;, and &quot;Czatkowiella&quot; due to their instability:

==Paleobiology==

===Neck and feeding===
The long neck of &quot;Dinocephalosaurus&quot; probably served a functional role. In particular, the length of the neck places a long distance between the head and the remainder of the body. This would have allowed &quot;Dinocephalosaurus&quot; to approach potential prey without the majority of its bulk being detected, which would have been effective in the murky waters of its habitat.

In 2004, Li and colleagues suggested that &quot;Dinocephalosaurus&quot; may also have used its neck to capture its prey via suction feeding. After flexing its neck to the side (which would have been facilitated by the slenderness of the cervical ribs), the act of straightening the neck would have caused the cervical ribs to splay outwards due to the action of the neck muscles attached to the ribs. As the head lunged forward, the volume of the esophagus would have increased, creating suction. Once the prey was caught, the fang-like teeth would have secured the prey in the mouth. However, in a response, Brigitte Demes and David Krause suggested that suction feeding would have involved the animal swallowing a large amount of saltwater as well as rapidly expanding its esophagus. Without evidence for adaptations to either behaviour (salt glands for the former, a large hyoid bone or specialised ribs for the latter), they considered the suggestion of Li and colleagues to be unlikely. Nevertheless, like other aquatic amniotes, &quot;Dinocephalosaurus&quot; would have swallowed and digested its prey head-first, as evidenced by the preservation of a perleidid fish in the abdominal region of LPV 30280 from Luoping.

It is not likely that &quot;Dinocephalosaurus&quot; used its long neck for breathing by extending it vertically. If it tried to do so, the difference in pressure between the surface and its torso would be sufficiently extreme such that its lungs would not have inflated. Thus, in order to breathe, &quot;Dinocephalosaurus&quot; would need to approach the surface with a nearly horizontal neck. The horizontal posture of the neck would also have facilitated locomotion at the surface, due to its long profile increasing its &quot;hull length&quot; and reducing the effect of resistance from waves.

===Reproduction===

&quot;Dinocephalosaurus&quot; represents the climax of aquatic adaptations among the protorosaurs. Given its long neck and paddle-like limbs, it was probably incapable of functioning comfortably in a terrestrial environment. In 2021, Ryosuke Motani and Geerat Vermeij categorised this as the fourth in a five-step sequence of increasing adaptations to marine environments based on modern animals as analogues, whereas tanystropheids were only at the second step (feeding in the ocean). One consequence of these adaptations is that &quot;Dinocephalosaurus&quot; would have been incapable of building nests on land. This would also have prevented it from possessing hard-shelled reptilian eggs; such eggs necessitate the exchange of gases with the outside environment, and this process is significantly slower in water than it is in air. Thus, &quot;Dinocephalosaurus&quot; could not have been oviparous. At the same time, however, archosaurs are known for the total absence of viviparous, or live birth, among its living members.
The embryonic individual of &quot;Dinocephalosaurus&quot; preserved inside LPV 30280 from Luoping can be identified as such for several reasons. First, it is enclosed entirely within the body cavity of the adult. Its cervical ribs - which are long, like that of the adult - face the same direction as the dorsal vertebrae of the adult, which is in contradiction to the typical head-first method of swallowing prey among amniotes. It is also preserved with its neck curling towards its forelimbs, a posture which is seen among vertebrate embryos but not adult &quot;Dinocephalosaurus&quot; specimens, which generally have the neck bent upwards. The absence of hands associated with the forelimbs in the embryo may be an artifact of preservation, but it may also be due to the sequence in which the limb bones of tetrapods ossify.

Although the presence of an embryo &quot;per se&quot; would be equivocal regarding this issue, the conditions in which the embryo were preserved provide strong evidence that &quot;Dinocephalosaurus&quot; was viviparous. There is no preserved calcified eggshell surrounding the embryo, despite the presence of delicately-preserved calcified elements from other animals at Luoping. This is consistent with the eggshells surrounding the embryos of viviparous reptiles being non-calcified membranes. Furthermore, the relative proportions of the humerus and the fibula in the embryo, compared with the maternal individual and IVPP V13898 from Panxian, indicate that the embryo is around 12% of the size of its mother. Combined with its ossified bones, this suggests that the embryo was at an advanced developmental stage, whereas crocodilians, birds, turtles, and tuataras lay eggs at very early developmental stages.

Overall, the evidence provided by the embryo suggests that &quot;Dinocephalosaurus&quot; was viviparous, making it the first viviparous archosauromorph asides from possibly metriorhynchids. This is consistent with the separation of its sacral ribs from its sacrum, which indicates a mobile pelvis that could have functioned in giving birth. While the otherwise absence of viviparous archosaurs has been historically attributed to common attributes inherited from the archosaurian stem-lineage, the discovery that &quot;Dinocephalosaurus&quot; was viviparous suggests that this phenomenon is due to lineage-specific lifestyle restrictions. Although the sex-determination systems among living archosauromorphs are diverse, with crocodilians and turtles using temperature-dependent sex determination, phylogenetic modelling suggests that &quot;Dinocephalosaurus&quot; retained the basal condition of genotypic sex determination from early diapsids, and that this system facilitated its transition to an obligately marine lifestyle alongside viviparity.

==Paleoecology==
Until at least the end of the Middle Triassic, high sea levels enabled shallow water to cover much of the South China Block, a tectonic plate that today consists of the stable Yangtze Craton and the less stable South China Fold Belt. A mountain-building event known as the Indosinian orogeny uplifted Precambrian rocks to form four major landmasses on the South China Block: Khamdian to the west, Jiangnan in the centre, Yunkai to the south, and Cathaysia to the east. Island chains also stretched between Yunkai and Cathaysia in the east. Located between Khamdian and Jiangnan was a deep oceanic basin known as the Nanpanjiang Basin. Along the western edge of this basin, fossil-bearing sediments were laid down to become what are now the Lagerstätten (sedimentary deposits characterized by exemplary preservation) of Panxian, Luoping, and other localities.
At Panxian, there appears to have been a transition in the endemic marine reptile fauna, possibly caused by volcanism. This volcanism is indicated by the presence of a bentonite layer between the Middle and Upper Reptile Horizons. From lower in the Upper Reptile Horizon, fossils have also been found of the ubiquitous mixosaurian ichthyosaur &quot;Mixosaurus panxianensis&quot; (which occurs in all layers), the pachypleurosaurs &quot;Keichousaurus sp.&quot; and &quot;Wumengosaurus delicatomandibularis&quot;, and fish, although fossils of the latter are fragmentary. The lower Middle and Lower Reptile Horizons also include the mixosaurian &quot;Phalarodon cf. fraasi&quot;, the primitive ichthyosaur &quot;Xinminosaurus catactes&quot;, the placodont &quot;Placodus inexpectatus&quot;, the nothosaurs &quot;Lariosaurus hongguoensis&quot; and &quot;Nothosaurus yangjuanensis&quot;, and the archosaur &quot;Qianosuchus mixtus&quot;, alongside bivalves and saurichthyid fish.

The fauna of Luoping appears to have been preserved in a small intraplatform basin instead of the surrounding open water, judging by the anoxic sediments present at the site. Out of 19,759 specimens, 93.7% of the fossils found at Luoping are arthropods: decapods, isopods, crab-like cycloids, shrimp-like mysidaceans, clam shrimp, and ostracods, as well as rare millipedes and horseshoe crabs. By comparison, only 0.07% of specimens come from marine reptiles, which include &quot;Dinocephalosaurus&quot; and &quot;Pectodens&quot; alongside the mixosaurians &quot;Mixosaurus cf. panxianensis&quot; and &quot;Phalarodon atavus&quot;; the pachypleurosaurs &quot;Dianmeisaurus gracilis&quot; and &quot;Dianopachysaurus dingi&quot;; the saurosphargids &quot;Largocephalosaurus polycarpon&quot; and &quot;Sinosaurosphargis yunguiensis&quot;; the nothosaurs &quot;Nothosaurus zhangi&quot; and a species of &quot;Lariosaurus&quot;; other sauropterygians &quot;Atopodentatus unicus&quot;, &quot;Dawazisaurus brevis&quot;, and &quot;Diandongosaurus acutidentatus&quot;; and an archosaur related to &quot;Qianosuchus&quot;. Otherwise, fish including saurichthyids, palaeoniscids, birgeriids, perleidids, eugnathids, semionotids, pholidopleurids, peltopleurids, and coelacanths have been found at Luoping, forming 3.66% of fossils with 25 taxa in 9 families. Molluscs such as bivalves and gastropods, along with ammonoids and belemnoids, account for 1.69% of specimens. Rare and probably non-endemic fossils also include echinoderms such as crinoids, starfish, and sea urchins; branchiopods; and relatively complete conifer branches and leaves, which probably originated from coastal forests less than away.

<text>In probability theory and statistics, the coefficient of variation (CV), also known as normalized root-mean-square deviation (NRMSD), percent RMS, and relative standard deviation (RSD), is a standardized measure of dispersion of a probability distribution or frequency distribution. It is defined as the ratio of the standard deviation formula_1 to the mean formula_2 (or its absolute value, , and often expressed as a percentage (&quot;%RSD&quot;). The CV or RSD is widely used in analytical chemistry to express the precision and repeatability of an assay. It is also commonly used in fields such as engineering or physics when doing quality assurance studies and ANOVA gauge R&amp;R, by economists and investors in economic models, and in psychology/neuroscience.

==Definition==
The coefficient of variation (CV) is defined as the ratio of the standard deviation formula_3 to the mean formula_4, formula_5

It shows the extent of variability in relation to the mean of the population.
The coefficient of variation should be computed only for data measured on scales that have a meaningful zero (ratio scale) and hence allow relative comparison of two measurements (i.e., division of one measurement by the other). The coefficient of variation may not have any meaning for data on an interval scale. For example, most temperature scales (e.g., Celsius, Fahrenheit etc.) are interval scales with arbitrary zeros, so the computed coefficient of variation would be different depending on the scale used. On the other hand, Kelvin temperature has a meaningful zero, the complete absence of thermal energy, and thus is a ratio scale. In plain language, it is meaningful to say that 20 Kelvin is twice as hot as 10 Kelvin, but only in this scale with a true absolute zero. While a standard deviation (SD) can be measured in Kelvin, Celsius, or Fahrenheit, the value computed is only applicable to that scale. Only the Kelvin scale can be used to compute a valid coefficient of variability.

Measurements that are log-normally distributed exhibit stationary CV; in contrast, SD varies depending upon the expected value of measurements.

A more robust possibility is the quartile coefficient of dispersion, half the interquartile range formula_6 divided by the average of the quartiles (the midhinge), formula_7.

In most cases, a CV is computed for a single independent variable (e.g., a single factory product) with numerous, repeated measures of a dependent variable (e.g., error in the production process). However, data that are linear or even logarithmically non-linear and include a continuous range for the independent variable with sparse measurements across each value (e.g., scatter-plot) may be amenable to single CV calculation using a maximum-likelihood estimation approach.

== Examples ==
In the examples below, we will take the values given as randomly chosen from a larger population of values.

* The data set [100, 100, 100] has constant values. Its standard deviation is 0 and average is 100, giving the coefficient of variation as 0 / 100 = 0
* The data set [90, 100, 110] has more variability. Its standard deviation is 10 and its average is 100, giving the coefficient of variation as 10 / 100 = 0.1
* The data set [1, 5, 6, 8, 10, 40, 65, 88] has still more variability. Its standard deviation is 32.9 and its average is 27.9, giving a coefficient of variation of 32.9 / 27.9 = 1.18

In these examples, we will take the values given as the entire population of values.

* The data set [100, 100, 100] has a population standard deviation of 0 and a coefficient of variation of 0 / 100 = 0
* The data set [90, 100, 110] has a population standard deviation of 8.16 and a coefficient of variation of 8.16 / 100 = 0.0816
* The data set [1, 5, 6, 8, 10, 40, 65, 88] has a population standard deviation of 30.8 and a coefficient of variation of 30.8 / 27.9 = 1.10

==Estimation==
When only a sample of data from a population is available, the population CV can be estimated using the ratio of the sample standard deviation formula_8 to the sample mean formula_9:

:formula_10

But this estimator, when applied to a small or moderately sized sample, tends to be too low: it is a biased estimator. For normally distributed data, an unbiased estimator for a sample of size n is:

:formula_11

===Log-normal data===
Many datasets follow an approximately log-normal distribution. In such cases, a more accurate estimate, derived from the properties of the log-normal distribution, is defined as:

:formula_12

where formula_13 is the sample standard deviation of the data after a natural log transformation. (In the event that measurements are recorded using any other logarithmic base, b, their standard deviation formula_14 is converted to base e using formula_15, and the formula for formula_16 remains the same.) This estimate is sometimes referred to as the &quot;geometric CV&quot; (GCV) in order to distinguish it from the simple estimate above. However, &quot;geometric coefficient of variation&quot; has also been defined by Kirkwood as:

:formula_17

This term was intended to be &quot;analogous&quot; to the coefficient of variation, for describing multiplicative variation in log-normal data, but this definition of GCV has no theoretical basis as an estimate of formula_18 itself.

For many practical purposes (such as sample size determination and calculation of confidence intervals) it is formula_19 which is of most use in the context of log-normally distributed data. If necessary, this can be derived from an estimate of formula_18 or GCV by inverting the corresponding formula.

==Comparison to standard deviation==

===Advantages===
The coefficient of variation is useful because the standard deviation of data must always be understood in the context of the mean of the data. 
In contrast, the actual value of the CV is independent of the unit in which the measurement has been taken, so it is a dimensionless number. 
For comparison between data sets with different units or widely different means, one should use the coefficient of variation instead of the standard deviation.

===Disadvantages===
* When the mean value is close to zero, the coefficient of variation will approach infinity and is therefore sensitive to small changes in the mean. This is often the case if the values do not originate from a ratio scale.
* Unlike the standard deviation, it cannot be used directly to construct confidence intervals for the mean.

==Applications==
The coefficient of variation is also common in applied probability fields such as renewal theory, queueing theory, and reliability theory. In these fields, the exponential distribution is often more important than the normal distribution.
The standard deviation of an exponential distribution is equal to its mean, so its coefficient of variation is equal to 1. Distributions with CV &lt; 1 (such as an Erlang distribution) are considered low-variance, while those with CV &gt; 1 (such as a hyper-exponential distribution) are considered high-variance. Some formulas in these fields are expressed using the squared coefficient of variation, often abbreviated SCV. In modeling, a variation of the CV is the CV(RMSD). Essentially the CV(RMSD) replaces the standard deviation term with the Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD). While many natural processes indeed show a correlation between the average value and the amount of variation around it, accurate sensor devices need to be designed in such a way that the coefficient of variation is close to zero, i.e., yielding a constant absolute error over their working range.

In actuarial science, the CV is known as unitized risk.

In industrial solids processing, CV is particularly important to measure the degree of homogeneity of a powder mixture. Comparing the calculated CV to a specification will allow to define if a sufficient degree of mixing has been reached.

In fluid dynamics, the CV, also referred to as Percent RMS, %RMS, %RMS Uniformity, or Velocity RMS, is a useful determination of flow uniformity for industrial processes. The term is used widely in the design of pollution control equipment, such as electrostatic precipitators (ESPs), selective catalytic reduction (SCR), scrubbers, and similar devices. The Institute of Clean Air Companies (ICAC) references RMS deviation of velocity in the design of fabric filters (ICAC document F-7). The guiding principal is that many of these pollution control devices require &quot;uniform flow&quot; entering and through the control zone. This can be related to uniformity of velocity profile, temperature distribution, gas species (such as ammonia for an SCR, or activated carbon injection for mercury absorption), and other flow-related parameters. The Percent RMS also is used to assess flow uniformity in combustion systems, HVAC systems, ductwork, inlets to fans and filters, air handling units, etc. where performance of the equipment is influenced by the incoming flow distribution.

===Laboratory measures of intra-assay and inter-assay CVs===
CV measures are often used as quality controls for quantitative laboratory assays. While intra-assay and inter-assay CVs might be assumed to be calculated by simply averaging CV values across CV values for multiple samples within one assay or by averaging multiple inter-assay CV estimates, it has been suggested that these practices are incorrect and that a more complex computational process is required. It has also been noted that CV values are not an ideal index of the certainty of a measurement when the number of replicates varies across samples − in this case standard error in percent is suggested to be superior. If measurements do not have a natural zero point then the CV is not a valid measurement and alternative measures such as the intraclass correlation coefficient are recommended.

=== As a measure of economic inequality ===

The coefficient of variation fulfills the requirements for a measure of economic inequality. If x (with entries &quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot;) is a list of the values of an economic indicator (e.g. wealth), with &quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot; being the wealth of agent &quot;i&quot;, then the following requirements are met:

* Anonymity – &quot;c&quot;&quot;v&quot; is independent of the ordering of the list x. This follows from the fact that the variance and mean are independent of the ordering of x.
* Scale invariance: &quot;c&quot;v(x) = &quot;c&quot;v(αx) where &quot;α&quot; is a real number.
* Population independence – If {x,x} is the list x appended to itself, then &quot;c&quot;&quot;v&quot;({x,x}) = &quot;c&quot;&quot;v&quot;(x). This follows from the fact that the variance and mean both obey this principle.
* Pigou–Dalton transfer principle: when wealth is transferred from a wealthier agent &quot;i&quot; to a poorer agent &quot;j&quot; (i.e. &quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot; &gt; &quot;x&quot;&quot;j&quot;) without altering their rank, then &quot;c&quot;&quot;v&quot; decreases and vice versa.

&quot;c&quot;&quot;v&quot; assumes its minimum value of zero for complete equality (all &quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot; are equal). Its most notable drawback is that it is not bounded from above, so it cannot be normalized to be within a fixed range (e.g. like the Gini coefficient which is constrained to be between 0 and 1). It is, however, more mathematically tractable than the Gini coefficient.

=== As a measure of standardisation of archaeological artefacts ===

Archaeologists often use CV values to compare the degree of standardisation of ancient artefacts. Variation in CVs has been interpreted to indicate different cultural transmission contexts for the adoption of new technologies. Coefficients of variation have also been used to investigate pottery standardisation relating to changes in social organisation. Archaeologists also use several methods for comparing CV values, for example the modified signed-likelihood ratio (MSLR) test for equality of CVs.

== Examples of misuse ==
Comparing coefficients of variation between parameters using relative units can result in differences that may not be real. If we compare the same set of temperatures in Celsius and Fahrenheit (both relative units, where kelvin and Rankine scale are their associated absolute values):

Celsius: [0, 10, 20, 30, 40]

Fahrenheit: [32, 50, 68, 86, 104]

The sample standard deviations are 15.81 and 28.46, respectively. The CV of the first set is 15.81/20 = 79%. For the second set (which are the same temperatures) it is 28.46/68 = 42%.

If, for example, the data sets are temperature readings from two different sensors (a Celsius sensor and a Fahrenheit sensor) and you want to know which sensor is better by picking the one with the least variance, then you will be misled if you use CV. The problem here is that you have divided by a relative value rather than an absolute.

Comparing the same data set, now in absolute units:

Kelvin: [273.15, 283.15, 293.15, 303.15, 313.15]

Rankine: [491.67, 509.67, 527.67, 545.67, 563.67]

The sample standard deviations are still 15.81 and 28.46, respectively, because the standard deviation is not affected by a constant offset. The coefficients of variation, however, are now both equal to 5.39%.

Mathematically speaking, the coefficient of variation is not entirely linear. That is, for a random variable formula_21, the coefficient of variation of formula_22 is equal to the coefficient of variation of formula_21 only when formula_24. In the above example, Celsius can only be converted to Fahrenheit through a linear transformation of the form formula_25 with formula_26, whereas Kelvins can be converted to Rankines through a transformation of the form formula_27.

==Distribution==
Provided that negative and small positive values of the sample mean occur with negligible frequency, the probability distribution of the coefficient of variation for a sample of size formula_28 of i.i.d. normal random variables has been shown by Hendricks and Robey to be

formula_29

where the symbol formula_30 indicates that the summation is over only even values of formula_31, i.e., if formula_28 is odd, sum over even values of formula_33 and if formula_28 is even, sum only over odd values of formula_33.

This is useful, for instance, in the construction of hypothesis tests or confidence intervals. 
Statistical inference for the coefficient of variation in normally distributed data is often based on McKay&#x27;s chi-square approximation for the coefficient of variation.

===Alternative===
Liu (2012) reviews methods for the construction of a confidence interval for the coefficient of variation. Notably, Lehmann (1986) derived the sampling distribution for the coefficient of variation using a non-central t-distribution to give an exact method for the construction of the CI.

== Similar ratios ==
Standardized moments are similar ratios, formula_36 where formula_37 is the &quot;k&quot;th moment about the mean, which are also dimensionless and scale invariant. The variance-to-mean ratio, formula_38, is another similar ratio, but is not dimensionless, and hence not scale invariant. See Normalization (statistics) for further ratios.

In signal processing, particularly image processing, the reciprocal ratio formula_39 (or its square) is referred to as the signal-to-noise ratio in general and signal-to-noise ratio (imaging) in particular.

Other related ratios include:
* Efficiency, formula_40
* Standardized moment, formula_41
* Variance-to-mean ratio (or relative variance), formula_38
* Fano factor, formula_43 (windowed VMR)

<text>&quot;The Wife&#x27;s Lament&quot; or &quot;The Wife&#x27;s Complaint&quot; is an Old English poem of 53 lines found on folio 115 of the Exeter Book and generally treated as an elegy in the manner of the German &quot;frauenlied&quot;, or &quot;women&#x27;s song&quot;. The poem has been relatively well preserved and requires few if any to enable an initial reading. Thematically, the poem is primarily concerned with the evocation of the grief of the female speaker and with the representation of her state of despair. The tribulations she suffers leading to her state of lamentation, however, are cryptically described and have been subject to many interpretations. Indeed, Professor Stephen Ramsay has said, &quot;the &#x27;correct&#x27; interpretation of &quot;The Wife&#x27;s Lament&quot; is one of the more hotly debated subjects in medieval studies.&quot;

==Genre==
Though the description of the text as a woman&#x27;s song or &quot;frauenlied&quot;—lamenting for a lost or absent lover—is the dominant understanding of the poem, the text has nevertheless been subject to a variety of distinct treatments that fundamentally disagree with this view and propose alternatives. One such treatment considers the poem to be allegory, in which interpretation the lamenting speaker represents the Church as Bride of Christ or as an otherwise feminine allegorical figure. Another dissenting interpretation holds that the speaker, who describes herself held within an old earth cell (&quot;eald is þes eorðsele&quot;) beneath an oak tree (&quot;under actreo&quot;), may indeed literally be located in a cell under the earth, and would therefore constitute a voice of the deceased, speaking from beyond the grave. Both the interpretations, as with most alternatives, face difficulties, particularly in the latter case, for which no analogous texts exist in the Old English corpus.

The status of the poem as a lament spoken by a female protagonist is therefore fairly well established in criticism. Interpretations that attempt a treatment diverging from this, though diverse in their approach, bear a fairly heavy burden of proof. Thematic consistencies between the &quot;Wife&#x27;s Lament&quot; and its close relative in the genre of the woman&#x27;s song, as well as close neighbour in the Exeter Book, &quot;Wulf and Eadwacer&quot;, make unconventional treatments somewhat counterintuitive. A final point of divergence, however, between the conventional interpretation and variants proceeds from the similarity of the poem in some respects to elegiac poems in the Old English corpus that feature male protagonists. Similarities between the language and circumstances of the male protagonist of &quot;The Wanderer&quot;, for example, and the protagonist of the &quot;Wife&#x27;s Lament&quot; have led other critics to argue, even more radically, that the protagonist of the poem (to which the attribution of the title &quot;the wife&#x27;s lament&quot; is wholly apocryphal and fairly recent) may in fact be male. This interpretation, however, faces the almost insurmountable problem that adjectives and personal nouns occurring within the poem (geomorre, minre, sylfre) are feminine in grammatical gender. This interpretation is at the very least dependent therefore on a contention that perhaps a later Anglo-Saxon copyist has wrongly imposed feminine gender on the protagonist where this was not the original authorial intent, and such contentions almost wholly relegate discussion to the realm of the hypothetical. It is also thought by some that &quot;The Wife&#x27;s Lament&quot; and &quot;The Husband&#x27;s Message&quot; may be part of a larger work.

The poem is also considered by some to be a riddle poem. A riddle poem contains a lesson told in cultural context which would be understandable or relates to the reader, and was a very popular genre of poetry of the time period. Gnomic wisdom is also a characteristic of a riddle poem, and is present in the poem&#x27;s closing sentiment (lines 52-53). Also, it cannot be ignored that contained within &quot;the Exeter Book&quot; are 92 other riddle poems. According to Faye Walker-Pelkey, &quot;The Lament&#x27;s placement in &quot;the Exeter Book,&quot; its mysterious content, its fragmented structure, its similarities to riddles, and its inclusion of gnomic wisdom suggest that the &quot;elegy&quot;...is a riddle.&quot;

==Narrative content and interpretation==
Interpreting the text of the poem as a woman&#x27;s lament, many of the text&#x27;s central controversies bear a similarity to those around &quot;Wulf and Eadwacer&quot;. Although it is unclear whether the protagonist&#x27;s tribulations proceed from relationships with multiple lovers or a single man, Stanley B. Greenfield, in his paper &quot;&quot;The Wife&#x27;s Lament&quot; Reconsidered,&quot; discredits the claim that the poem involves multiple lovers. He suggests that lines 42-47 use an optative voice as a curse against the husband, not a second lover. The impersonal expressions with which the poem concludes, according to Greenfield, do not represent gnomic wisdom or even a curse upon young men in general; rather this impersonal voice is used to convey the complex emotions of the wife toward her husband.

Virtually all of the facts integral to the poem beyond the matter of genre are widely open to dispute. The obscurity of the narrative background of the story has led some critics to suggest that the narrative may have been one familiar to its original listeners, at some point when this particular rendition was conceived, such that much of the matter of the story was omitted in favour of a focus on the emotional drive of the lament. Constructing a coherent narrative from the text requires a good deal of inferential conjecture, but a commentary on various elements of the text is provided here nonetheless.

&quot;The Wife&#x27;s Lament&quot;, even more so than &quot;Wulf and Eadwacer&quot;, vividly conflates the theme of mourning over a departed or deceased leader of the people (as may be found in &quot;The Wanderer&quot;) with the theme of mourning over a departed or deceased lover (as portrayed in &quot;Wulf and Eadwacer&quot;). The lord of the speaker&#x27;s people (&quot;min leodfruma, min hlaford&quot;) appears in all likelihood also to be her lord in marriage. Given that her lord&#x27;s kinsmen (&quot;þæt monnes magas&quot;) are described as taking measures to separate the speaker from him, a probable interpretation of the speaker&#x27;s initial circumstances is that she has been entered into an exogamous relationship typical within the Anglo-Saxon heroic tradition, and her marital status has left her isolated among her husband&#x27;s people, who are hostile to her, whether due to her actions or merely due to political strife beyond her control. Somewhat confusing the account, however, the speaker, longing for her lover, has apparently departed (&quot;Ic me feran geƿat&quot;) either to seek out her lord or merely to seek exile, and the relationship, chronologically or causally, between this act and the hostility of her and/or her husband&#x27;s people is unclear.

She is told by her lord (&quot;hlaford min&quot;) to take up a particular dwelling place, where she encounters a man of unclear identity, who is or was &quot;suitable&quot; (&quot;ful gemæcne&quot;) to her, and they declare they will not be separated by anything save death. This, however, does not last, seemingly as a consequence of prior difficulties concerning her marriage. The remainder of the narrative concerns her lamentable state in the present of the poem. She is commanded to dwell in a barrow within the earth (&quot;þes eorðsele&quot;), wherein she is compelled to mourn the loss of her lord and her present exile. The poem concludes with what begins as a gnomic exhortation admonishing youth to adopt a cheerful aspect, even in grief, but subsequently develops into an expression of the grief of the speaker&#x27;s beloved.

More recent interpretations have disputed this gnomic exhortation. According to John Niles, in this “genteel” reading, it seems less consequential whether the wife has been scorned by one husband or two; it is her “dignified passivity” as well as her gnomic wisdom on which scholars focus. In “vindictive” readings, however, the wife is generally seen to burn with anger toward one man – her husband. In such views, &quot;The Wife’s Lament&quot; begins as a bold statement of misery, transitions into a description of her misfortunes in which she nostalgically recalls happy days with her husband, and ends in a bitter curse upon this same man who has now abandoned her.

One proponent of this approach is Barrie Ruth Straus, author of “Women’s Words as Weapons: Speech as Action in ‘The Wife’s Lament.’” Straus bases her analysis of the poem on the speech act theory of J.L. Austin and John Searle, which regards speech as an action. Strauss breaks the poem into sections and shows how the language or “illocutionary acts” of each can be seen as an assertive act of telling. In a world in which women have little control, Straus emphasizes how speech could be an act of power; thus in the first section, the narrator deliberately establishes an intent to tell her story. She then persuasively presents her story as one of being wronged by her husband, avenging herself in the telling. In light of this speech act theory, Straus concludes that the final ten lines of the poem should be construed as a curse upon the husband, as this is the “least problematic interpretation”.

Like Straus, Niles views the poem as an aggressive act of speech. While arguing that the poem presents certain philological evidence to support an optative reading, the bulk of his support comes from contextual analysis of the act of cursing within the Anglo-Saxon culture. His article, “The Problem of the Ending of the Wife’s ‘Lament’ ” provides an intriguing overview of curses, discussing biblical influences of cursing as seen in Psalms 108 and the book of Deuteronomy. He also examines the act of cursing in charters and wills, quoting examples such as the following: “If anyone ever alters or removes anything in this will, may God’s grace and his eternal reward be taken from him forever…”. The Exeter Book itself is inscribed with such a curse. The Anglo-Saxon culture that took all acts of &quot;ƿearg-cƿedol&quot; (evil speaking) very seriously and even warily watched for potential witches, Niles argues, would have little trouble accepting the poem as a curse. Whether intended as a formal malediction or an emotional vituperation is less important.

==Influence==
Various efforts have been made to link this poem to later works featuring innocent, persecuted heroines, but its lyrical nature and brevity of information make establishing such links difficult. For instance, the Crescentia cycle, a series of chivalric romances such as &quot;Le Bone Florence of Rome&quot; featuring a woman persecuted by her brother-in-law and would-be seducer, has been said to traced to it; however, the woman herself complains only of malevolent relatives, not the specific brother-in-law that is the distinctive trait of the Crescentia cycle. Similarly, attempts have been made to link it to the Constance cycle, where the heroine is persecuted by her wicked mother-in-law, which has English instances of &quot;Vitae duorum Offarum&quot;, &quot;Emaré&quot;, and &quot;The Man of Law&#x27;s Tale&quot;, but no definitive conclusion can be made.

<text>Marian Wilkinson is an Australian journalist and author. She has won two Walkley Awards, and was the first female executive producer of Four Corners. She has been a deputy editor of the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, a Washington correspondent for &quot;The National Times&quot;, &quot;The Age&quot; and &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, as well as a senior reporter for &quot;The Australian&quot;., she is a senior reporter at Four Corners.

== Early life ==
She was born in 1954 and grew up in Brisbane, Queensland where she attended the University of Queensland. In 1975, she was a cofounder of community radio station 4ZZZ-FM.

&quot;I grew up quite some time ago in Queensland when it was run by what was later found to be an incredibly corrupt government -- the government of Joh Bjelke-Petersen,&quot; she told journalism students in 2015. &quot;I think my interest in journalism stemmed from there because I had set up a student radio station, and set up a newsroom. We were actually trying to as young students go and look at things like police corruption, go and look at things like political corruption, which was rife already in the state. I think that desire to actually expose wrong-doing really motivated me.&quot;

== Career ==
In the 1980s, Wilkinson joined the staff of the National Times, which was edited by Brian Toohey and saw her work alongside reporters like David Marr, Colleen Ryan and Wendy Bacon. The paper at the time had a heavy investigative focus, particularly with regards to politics and crime. Wilkinson became the National Times&#x27; Washington Correspondent, and from there joined the ABC, where she started working on the network&#x27;s flagship current affairs program. Four Corners.

In 1989, True Believers, a report done with Monica Attard on the dumping of federal Liberal leader John Howard by the Liberal Party in favour of Andrew Peacock, won both a Walkley and a Logie. Later that year, she joined The Sydney Morning Herald, though she rejoined Four Corners less than a year later in the role of executive producer.

In 1995, Wilkinson was a reporter for The Australian. By 2000, she was a senior editor at Fairfax&#x27;s Sydney Morning Herald. In 2002, she moved back to writing duties, being appointed the Washington correspondent for the paper, also filing for sister title The Age. She returned to Sydney in 2005, becoming the Sydney Morning Herald&#x27;s national security editor. In 2009, when the paper&#x27;s environment editor, she won the Eureka Prize for Environmental Journalism for The Tipping Point, a report on the melting of the arctic sea ice.

In 2010, Wilkinson rejoined Four Corners. In 2016, she was nominated for a Walkley Award for her work as the ABC&#x27;s lead reporter on the Panama Papers. Her 2020 book, &quot;The Carbon Club&quot;, was longlisted for the 2021 Walkley Book Award.

She is the aunt of Cassandra Wilkinson who is a co-founder of FBi FM Sydney.

<text>Pathé (; styled as PATHÉ!) is a French major film production and distribution company, owning a number of cinema chains through its subsidiary Pathé Cinémas and television networks across Europe. 

It is the name of a network of French businesses that were founded and originally run by the Pathé Brothers of France starting in 1896. In the early 1900s, Pathé became the world&#x27;s largest film equipment and production company, as well as a major producer of phonograph records. In 1908, Pathé invented the newsreel that was shown in cinemas before a feature film.

Pathé is the second-oldest operating film company, behind Gaumont, which was established in 1895.

== History ==
The company was founded as Société Pathé Frères (; &quot;Pathé Brothers Company&quot;) in Paris, France on 28 September 1896, by the four brothers Charles, Émile, Théophile and Jacques Pathé. During the first part of the 20th century, Pathé became the largest film equipment and production company in the world, as well as a major producer of phonograph records.

The driving force behind the film operation and phonograph business was Charles Pathé, who had helped open a phonograph shop in 1894 and established a phonograph factory at Chatou on the western outskirts of Paris. The Pathé brothers began selling Edison and Columbia phonographs and accompanying cylinder records and later, the brothers designed and sold their own phonographs that incorporated elements of other brands. Soon after, they also started marketing pre-recorded cylinder records. By 1896 the Pathé brothers had offices and recording studios not only in Paris, but also in London, Milan, and St. Petersburg. Pathé manufactured cylinder records until approximately 1914. In 1905, the Pathé brothers entered the growing field of disc records.

In France, Pathé became the largest and most successful distributor of cylinder records and phonographs. These, however, failed to make headway in foreign markets such as the United Kingdom and the United States where other brands were already in widespread use.

In December 1928, the French and British Pathé phonograph assets were sold to the British Columbia Graphophone Company. In July 1929, the assets of the American Pathé record company were merged into the newly formed American Record Corporation. 

The Pathé and Pathé-Marconi labels and catalogue still survive, first as imprints of EMI and now currently EMI&#x27;s successor Parlophone Records. In 1967 EMI Italiana took control of the entire catalog. In turn, the Universal Music Group acquired EMI Italiana in 2013.

=== Pathé films ===
As the phonograph business became successful, Pathé saw the opportunities offered by new means of entertainment and in particular by the fledgling motion picture industry. Having decided to expand the record business to include film equipment, the company expanded dramatically. To finance its growth, the company took the name Compagnie Générale des Établissements Pathé Frères Phonographes &amp; Cinématographes (sometimes abbreviated as CGPC) in 1897, and its shares were listed on the Paris Stock Exchange. In 1896, Mitchell Mark of Buffalo, New York, became the first American to import Pathé films to the United States, where they were shown in the Vitascope Theater.

In 1907, Pathé acquired the Lumière brothers&#x27; patents and then set about to design an improved studio camera and to make their own film stock. Their technologically advanced equipment, new processing facilities built at Vincennes, and aggressive merchandising combined with efficient distribution systems allowed them to capture a huge share of the international market. They first expanded to London in 1902 where they set up production facilities and a chain of cinemas.

By 1909, Pathé had built more than 200 cinemas in France and Belgium and by the following year they had facilities in Madrid, Moscow, Rome and New York City plus Australia and Japan. Slightly later, they opened a film exchange in Buffalo, New York. Through its American subsidiary, it was part of the MPPC cartel of production in the United States. It participated in the Paris Film Congress in February 1909 as part of a plan to create a similar European organisation. The company withdrew from the project in a second meeting in April which fatally undermined the proposal. In 1906, Pathé Frères had pioneered the luxury cinema with the opening of the Omnia Cinéma-Pathé in Paris.

Prior to the outbreak of World War I, Pathé dominated Europe&#x27;s market in motion picture cameras and projectors. It has been estimated that at one time, 60 percent of all films were shot with Pathé equipment. In 1908, Pathé distributed &quot;Excursion to the Moon&quot; by Segundo de Chomón, an imitation of Georges Méliès&#x27;s &quot;A Trip to the Moon&quot;. Pathé and Méliès worked together in 1911. Méliès made a film &quot;Baron Munchausen&#x27;s Dream&quot;, his first film to be distributed by Pathé. Pathé&#x27;s relationship with Méliès soured, and after he went bankrupt in 1913, his last film was never released by Pathé. 

After World War I, Charles Pathé started divesting himself from various film interests, believing that the French film industry would never recover after 1918. The company&#x27;s subsequent decline relegated Pathé primarily as a distributor of short subjects and it became a minor player in the mainstream film industry.

=== Innovations ===
Worldwide, the company emphasised research, investing in such experiments as hand-coloured film and the synchronisation of film and gramophone recordings. In 1908, Pathé invented the newsreel that was shown in theatres prior to the feature film. The news clips featured the Pathé logo of a crowing rooster at the beginning of each reel. In 1912, it introduced 28 mm non-flammable film and equipment under the brand name Pathescope. Pathé News produced cinema newsreels from 1910, up until the 1970s when production ceased as a result of mass television ownership.

In the United States, beginning in 1914, the company built film production studios in Fort Lee and Jersey City, New Jersey, where their building still stands. The Heights, Jersey City produced the extremely successful serialised episodes called &quot;The Perils of Pauline&quot;. By 1918 Pathé had grown to the point where it was necessary to separate operations into two distinct divisions. With Emile Pathé as chief executive, Pathé Records dealt exclusively with phonographs and recordings. Brother Charles managed &quot;Pathé-Cinéma&#x27;,&#x27; which was responsible for film production, distribution, and exhibition.

In 1922 they introduced the &quot;Pathé Baby&quot; home film system using a new 9.5 mm film stock, which became popular during the next few decades. In 1921, Pathé sold off its United States motion picture production arm. It was renamed &quot;Pathé Exchange&quot; and later merged into RKO Pictures, disappearing as an independent brand in 1931. Pathé sold its British film studios to Eastman Kodak in 1927, while maintaining the theatre and distribution arm.

=== Natan to Parretti ===
Pathé was already in substantial financial trouble when Bernard Natan took control of the company in 1929. Studio founder Charles Pathé had been selling assets for several years to boost investor value and keep the studio&#x27;s cash flow healthy. The company&#x27;s founder had even sold Pathé&#x27;s name and &quot;rooster&quot; trademark to other companies in return for a mere two percent of revenues. Natan had the bad luck to take charge of the studio just as the Great Depression convulsed the French economy.

Natan attempted to steady Pathé&#x27;s finances and implement modern film industry practices at the studio. He acquired another film studio, Société des Cinéromans, from Arthur Bernède and Gaston Leroux, which let Pathé expand into projector and electronics manufacturing. He also bought the Fornier chain of motion picture theatres and rapidly expanded the chain&#x27;s nationwide presence. The French press, however, attacked Natan mercilessly for his stewardship of Pathé. Many of these attacks were antisemitic.

Pathé-Natan did well under Natan&#x27;s guidance. Between 1930 and 1935, despite the world economic crisis, the company made 100 million francs in profits, and produced and released more than 60 feature films (just as many films as major American studios produced at the time). He resumed production of the newsreel Pathé News, which had not been produced since 1927.

Natan also invested heavily into research and development to expand Pathé&#x27;s film business. In 1929, he pushed Pathé into sound film. In September, the studio produced its first sound feature film, and its first sound newsreel a month later. Natan also launched two new cinema-related magazines, &quot;Pathé-Revue&quot; and &quot;Actualités Féminines&quot;, to help market Pathé&#x27;s films and build consumer demand for cinema. Under Natan, Pathé also funded the research of Henri Chrétien, who developed the anamorphic lens (leading to the creation of CinemaScope and other widescreen film formats common today).

Natan expanded Pathé&#x27;s business interests into communications industries other than film. In November 1929, Natan established France&#x27;s first television company, Télévision-Baird-Natan. A year later, he purchased a radio station in Paris and formed a holding company (Radio-Natan-Vitus) to run what would become a burgeoning radio empire.

In order to finance the company&#x27;s continued expansion, Pathé&#x27;s board of directors (which still included Charles Pathé) had voted in 1930 to issue shares worth 105 million francs. Then the Great Depression hit France in 1931, and only 50 percent of the shares were purchased. One of the investor banks collapsed due to financial difficulties unrelated to Pathé&#x27;s problems, and Pathé was forced to follow through with the purchase of several cinema chains it no longer could afford to buy. Although the company continued to make a profit, it lost more money thanks to these acquisitions than it could bring in. In 1935, a commercial court began examining Pathé&#x27;s accounts, and by 1936 it was declared bankrupt and Natan was dismissed. The studios were not doing badly and continued to make films, but his companies went into receivership and were claimed by the state. 

French authorities pursued charges of fraud against Natan, including financing the purchase of the company without any collateral, of bilking investors by establishing fictitious shell corporations, and financial mismanagement. He was also accused of hiding his Romanian and Jewish heritage by changing his name. In 1938, Natan was arrested and imprisoned, never to regain his freedom. In 1939 he was indicted and sentenced to four years in jail. As a result, he was in prison when France fell to the Nazis, a time when other Jewish filmmakers fled or went into hiding. On his release from prison in 1942, he was delivered to the Nazis, and by September 1942 had been deported to Auschwitz, where he was murdered.

In 1943, the company was forced to undergo a restructuring, and was acquired by Adrien Ramauge, changing its name to Société Nouvelle Pathé Cinema. Over the years, the business underwent a number of changes including diversification into producing programmes for the burgeoning television industry. During the 1970s, operating theatres overtook film production as Pathé&#x27;s primary source of revenue.

In the late 1980s, Italian financier Giancarlo Parretti tried to make a bid for Pathé, even taking over Cannon and renaming it Pathé Communications in anticipation of owning the storied studio. Parretti&#x27;s shady past, however, raised enough eyebrows in the French government that the deal fell through. It turned out to be a fortunate decision, as Parretti later took over Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, and merged it with his Pathé Communications Group to create MGM-Pathé Communications in 1990, only to lose it in bankruptcy in late 1991.

=== Jérôme Seydoux ===
In 1990 Chargeurs, a French conglomerate led by Jérôme Seydoux, took control of the company. As a result of the deregulation of the French telecommunications market, in June 1999 Pathé merged with Vivendi, with the exchange ratio for the merger fixed at three Vivendi shares for every two Pathé shares. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; estimated the value of the deal at US$2.59 billion. Following the completion of the merger, Vivendi retained Pathé&#x27;s interests in British Sky Broadcasting and CanalSatellite, a French broadcasting corporation, but then sold all remaining assets to Jérôme Seydoux&#x27;s family-owned corporation, Fornier SA, which changed its name to Pathé.

== Distribution ==
=== Current ===
==== France ====
In its home country France, Pathé self-distributes its films through Pathé Films (formerly called AMLF (Agence méditerranéenne de location de films) from 1972 to 1998). On home video, their films are currently distributed by ESC Distribution, and formerly Fox Pathé Europa, a joint venture between 20th Century Home Entertainment, Pathé and EuropaCorp.

=== Former ===
==== United Kingdom ====
In August 1992, Pathé&#x27;s then-parent company Chargeurs purchased Guild Entertainment from Wembley PLC, becoming Pathé&#x27;s de-facto UK distributor. Initially, PolyGram Video distributed Guild&#x27;s VHS releases until March 1995, when Chargeurs formed a UK rental joint-venture with 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment, who became Guild/Pathé&#x27;s home video distributor, the rental joint-venture would be named Fox Guild Home Entertainment.

After the Chargeurs demerger in 1996, Pathé began retiring the Guild brand, initially rebranding the theatrical arm as Guild Pathé Cinema and eventually in June 1997, as Pathé Distribution after securing a deal to produce films in the country. The home video division followed suit toward the end of the year, rebranding under the Pathé name, the video rental division Fox Guild Home Entertainment would be renamed Fox Pathé Home Entertainment the following year. Despite this, Guild Home Video remained as an in-name-only dormant business of Pathé until folding on 17 December 2019.

On 12 March 2009, Pathé announced that they would close their UK/Ireland theatrical distribution unit and form a new partnership with Warner Bros. Pictures to handle the theatrical distribution of their titles in the UK, following a handful of films that flopped at the box office. The move was made so Pathé could focus more on the development and production of its own titles instead of acquisitions. The partnership would allow the two companies working together to identify co-production opportunities. Pathé would remain as an international sales agent for films, while 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment would remain as the distributor for home video. Select film acquisitions that were planned to be distributed by Pathé, such as &quot;Chatroom&quot; and &quot;Dead Man Running&quot;, were sold to Revolver Entertainment.

On 1 February 2011, it was announced that 20th Century Fox would take over as Pathé&#x27;s theatrical distributor. Pathé UK&#x27;s co-CEO Francois Ivernel deemed it easier for one company to handle the licensing process for both theatrical and home video.

With the purchase of 20th Century Fox by the Walt Disney Company on 20 March 2019, Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures took over distribution of Pathé&#x27;s material, releasing both &quot;Misbehaviour&quot; and &quot;The Human Voice&quot;, Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment would release the two films on home video. The longstanding deal with Fox/Disney deal expired on 30 June 2021, and Pathé decided not to renew. Pathé UK managing director Cameron McCracken was pleased with Disney&#x27;s treatment of the company&#x27;s films, deeming them to have given the films the same treatment that Fox did.

On 7 June 2021, a few weeks before the expiration of the Fox deal, Pathé UK announced they would revert their distribution to Warner Bros. Pictures, with the first films being released under the new deal being &quot;Parallel Mothers&quot; and &quot;The Duke&quot;. Unlike the 2009 deal, this new deal would also include home video and digital rights as well, which Fox/Disney previously handled.

On 15 November 2023, Pathé UK announced that they would exit out of the UK theatrical market and restructure to focus on the premium television market instead. The exit was due to structural changes in the film industry following the impact of Coronavirus pandemic, issues with the structure of independent distribution in the country (which led to fellow rival Entertainment One (now Lionsgate Canada) closing their UK distribution arm earlier in the year), some of their films flopping at the box office, and the retirement of Cameron McCracken. Some time later, StudioCanal UK took over distribution of their material on home video through their Elevation Sales joint-venture with Lionsgate UK.
