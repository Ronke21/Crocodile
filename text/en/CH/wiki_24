<text>Renzo Zorzi (12 December 1946 – 15 May 2015) was a racing driver from Italy who participated in seven Formula One Grands Prix between 1975 and 1977, for the Williams and Shadow teams. He began in Formula Three while working with Pirelli before progressing to Formula One. He later raced in sports cars before returning to work with Pirelli, running a driving school. He is the only driver from the province of Trentino to have competed in Formula One.

==Career==
===Formula Three===
The son of a miner, Renzo Zorzi was born in Ziano di Fiemme, Trentino, near the Austrian border. He became an engineer with Pirelli, and began his motor racing career in 1972, driving a Tecno for Scuderia Mirabella in Italian Formula Three. He debuted at Monza on 3 September, where he failed to qualify for the final.

He competed more regularly the following year, initially with a Brabham BT38C, and then with a Quasar, finishing 12th at Vallelunga, before finishing 13th at Casale with the Brabham. He then managed 10th at Misano driving a Branca, before his best result of the season, sixth place at Varano in a Brabham BT35.

In 1974, he campaigned a GRD 374 for Scuderia Mirabella, with Giorgio Francia as his team-mate. With this car he began to achieve better results, starting with sixth place at Casale and fifth at Monza beating Francia, before fifth place at Monaco driving a March 743. Back in the GRD, he managed 13th at the Nürburgring in a race won by Francia, followed by fifth again at Casale and sixth at Monza. He finished tenth in the championship.

For 1975, Zorzi helped to develop a Formula Three engine for Lancia, built by the Repetto company. This was fitted to his GRD 374, replacing the original Ford engine, and with the GRD-Lancia he finished third at Varano, his first podium finish. As he was still without a win in the Italian category, it was a surprise when he won the European Formula Three Monaco Grand Prix support race in May, having qualified second to Larry Perkins and won heat two by eleven seconds. In a chaotic final, he gained two places when Tony Brise and Alex Ribeiro collided in front of him, and finished second on the track, 21 seconds behind Conny Andersson. When Andersson was penalised a minute for a jump start, Zorzi inherited the victory, just 0.89 seconds ahead of the Safir of Patrick Nève.

Back in the Italian championship, he subsequently finished seventh at Vallelunga, and sixth at Mugello. In the European category, he achieved two sixth places at the Nürburgring and the Ring Djursland in Denmark. But his Monaco success had provided the impetus for a step towards Formula One before the end of the 1975 season.

===Formula One: Williams===
Later in 1975, Zorzi arranged a deal with Frank Williams to drive one of his cars at the Italian Grand Prix. The Williams team was struggling at this time, and were using pay drivers to race the ageing FW03 which had failed to score any points so far that season. He qualified the car 22nd of the 28 entrants, just 0.71 seconds slower than his team-mate Jacques Laffite in the newer FW04. Running as high as 12th in the race, he was delayed by a puncture and finished 14th and last, six laps adrift of winner Clay Regazzoni. This was the last race for the car before Williams sold it to Loris Kessel.

The arrangement continued at the first race of 1976, the Brazilian Grand Prix, although the team was now 60% owned by Walter Wolf and renamed Wolf-Williams. Zorzi drove the FW04 while new team-mate Jacky Ickx drove the new FW05. Zorzi qualified 17th of the 22 entrants, outqualifying 19th placed Ickx. He finished ninth of 14 classified finishers, just 2.44 seconds behind Ickx. However, his sponsorship money had run out and his time with Williams came to an end as he was replaced by Michel Leclère. For the rest of 1976, Zorzi returned to Formula Three with the Modus team, and also raced sports cars. Among other results in the 1976 World Championship for Makes, he finished eighth in the 1976 6 Hours of Vallelunga in a Jolly Club-entered Lancia Stratos.

===1977: Shadow===
Zorzi returned to Formula One in 1977 with the Shadow team as team-mate to the highly-rated Welsh driver Tom Pryce, backed by their Italian sponsor Franco Ambrosio. Ambrosio demanded an Italian driver as part of the agreement for his financial support, and Zorzi was chosen for this reason rather than through the choice of the team. At the first race in Argentina, driving the team&#x27;s older DN5B, he qualified last of the 21 entrants, and climbed to 18th at the start before retiring on lap three with a gearbox failure.

At the next race in Brazil, Zorzi qualified 18th and in a race of attrition, finished sixth of the seven finishers, winning his only World Championship point in only his fourth Grand Prix. Pryce had been running second in the race behind eventual winner Carlos Reutemann, when his engine failed with seven laps remaining.

However, tragedy struck in the following race in South Africa. Driving the team&#x27;s new DN8, Zorzi qualified 20th, and was running near the back of the field when he pulled off the track with a fuel leak caused by a broken metering unit. As he tried to detach the oxygen pipe from his helmet before getting out of the car, a fire erupted at the rear. Zorzi quickly got out of the car and activated his on-board fire extinguisher which doused the flames. Several seconds later, although the fire was out, two marshals ran across the track with hand-held fire extinguishers. Crossing the track just beyond a blind brow, the first marshal narrowly avoided the passing cars but the second marshal, Frederick Jansen Van Vuuren, was struck and killed by the car of Zorzi&#x27;s teammate Pryce. Van Vuuren&#x27;s fire extinguisher struck Pryce on his helmet, causing fatal head and neck injuries.

The British press and some in the Shadow team blamed Zorzi for the tragedy, suggesting his agitation in the cockpit trying to remove his oxygen pipe prompted the marshals to cross the track, believing Zorzi needed assistance. Pryce was replaced by future World Champion Alan Jones, who outperformed Zorzi at the following two races. At Long Beach, Zorzi qualified 20th and retired with a gearbox failure, and in Spain he qualified 24th and retired with an engine failure.

When Zorzi arrived in Monaco for the 1977 Monaco Grand Prix, he found that his car had Riccardo Patrese&#x27;s name on it, and that he had been replaced by Patrese, another Ambrosio protege, without being informed.

===Later career===
After his Formula One career was over, Zorzi occasionally raced in sports cars, mainly in Italy. He was a regular entrant to the 1000 km Monza race, winning it in 1979 in a Lola T286 with Marco Capoferri. The following year, he qualified on pole position in the Capoferri-Ford he shared with Claudio Francisci, also claiming fastest lap before the car retired. His last appearance in the event came in 1985, when the Porsche 956 he shared with Oscar Larrauri and Massimo Sigala for Brun Motorsport finished sixth.

Zorzi also had a one-off appearance in the Aurora AFX F1 championship in 1980, driving an Arrows A1 for Charles Clowes Racing in the Monza Lottery GP. He qualified eighth but retired after a collision.

After retiring from racing, he returned to work for Pirelli, running a driving school for the company at Binetto in southern Italy.

==Death==
Zorzi died on 15 May 2015, aged 68, in hospital in Magenta, Lombardy after a long illness. His funeral took place on 18 May in his birthplace of Ziano. He was survived by a son, Andrea.

<doc id="1016408" wikidata="Q9292296" url="?curid=1016408" title="Hilton Young, 1st Baron Kennet">
<text>Edward Hilton Young, 1st Baron Kennet (20 March 1879 – 11 July 1960) was a British politician and writer.

==Family and early life==
Young was the youngest son of Sir George Young, 3rd Baronet (see Young baronets), a noted classicist and charity commissioner. Sir George&#x27;s paternal great-grandmother was Emily Baring of the eponymous merchant banking dynasty. Hilton&#x27;s mother, formerly Alice Eacy Kennedy, was of Dublin Irish Protestant background and had previously lived in India as Lady Lawrence, wife of Sir Alexander Lawrence, Bt, nephew to the Viceroy, Lord Lawrence. Widowed when Sir Alexander died in a bridge collapse, Alice returned to England, marrying Sir George in 1871. Hilton was the youngest of three sons and one daughter (who died aged 14) born to the couple. The oldest brother, also George, would become a diplomat and Ottoman scholar. The next brother, Geoffrey Winthrop Young, became a noted educator and mountaineer. Their childhood was spent at the family&#x27;s Thames-side &#x27;Formosa&#x27; estate, at Cookham, Berkshire. On visits to their London house near Sloane Square, Hilton would often play in Kensington Gardens with the children of Sir George&#x27;s friend, Sir Leslie Stephen. In this way, he commenced a close friendship with his contemporary Thoby Stephen, and became acquainted with Thoby&#x27;s siblings, Vanessa, Virginia, and Adrian.

At his preparatory school, Northaw Place, in 1892 Young took pity on nine-year-old Clement Attlee on the latter&#x27;s first day at school, offering the newcomer jam from his own pot. His secondary schooling commenced at Marlborough but incessant bullying saw him transferred to Eton where he joined the army stream which emphasised science rather than the classics. After two terms studying chemistry at University College London, he went up to Trinity College, Cambridge in October 1897, graduating in 1900 with a &#x27;first&#x27; in natural sciences and having achieved the office of president of the Union Society.

==Early career==
Post-Cambridge he read for the Bar and was called by the Inner Temple in 1904. However, after receiving few briefs and suffering a nervous breakdown, he transferred to financial journalism. In 1908 he was appointed assistant editor of &quot;The Economist&quot;, resigning in 1910 to become city editor of &quot;The Morning Post&quot;. His 1912 work &quot;Foreign Companies and Other Corporations&quot; combined his legal and financial knowledge to examine the status of companies created in one national jurisdiction which operate in other jurisdictions.

At Cambridge, through Thoby Stephen, he became acquainted with key members of what would become known as the ‘Bloomsbury group’. He attended the group&#x27;s early gatherings at Gordon Square and Fitzroy Square, and became attracted to Virginia Stephen, to whom he proposed on a punt on the Cam in May 1909, only to be rejected. Another Cambridge friendship, made through his brother Geoffrey, was with G. M. Trevelyan and in Spring 1906 he accompanied the historian during a retracement of the route of Garibaldi&#x27;s retreat which became the basis for Trevelyan&#x27;s Garibaldi trilogy. The second work in the trilogy—&quot;Garibaldi and the Thousand&quot;—was dedicated to the Young brothers and contained 15 photographs taken by Hilton.

==First World War==
Enlisting in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve on 22 August 1914 and commissioned in September, he served in a wide variety of theatres and actions in the First World War, including the Grand Fleet at Scapa Flow.

He served on HMS &quot;Cyclops&quot; then from September 1914. That autumn he wrote to his brother that it was “really rather wonderful” to be serving on Admiral Jellicoe&#x27;s flagship. In a letter in October he mentioned a sailors’ entertainment for “the admiral’s” benefit including some sailors dancing the can-can. However, by February 1915 he was chafing at the “inoccupation” of the Grand Fleet, in the absence of any major sea battle.

A literary consequence of his war service was &quot;A Muse at Sea&quot;, a compilation of his poems initially published in the &quot;Ducal Weekly&quot; (the &quot;Iron Duke&quot;&#x27;s newspaper), and also in the &quot;Morning Post&quot;, the &quot;Cornhill Magazine&quot; and the &quot;Nation&quot;. He also rendered other types of service to his friends Lytton Strachey and Clive Bell during the War. In 1908 he had bought a thatched cottage for weekend use, The Lacket, at Lockeridge near Marlborough. During 1914–15 he rented the cottage to Strachey who drafted the first two chapters of his &quot;Eminent Victorians&quot; there.

While on active service on &quot;Iron Duke&quot;, in February 1915 he was elected unopposed as a Liberal MP at a by-election for the seat of Norwich.

In April 1915 he received a letter from Vanessa Bell, in response to his request for a letter making no mention of the war, telling him of the doings of the Bloomsbury Set, including “Bertie” Russell, Lytton Strachey and Ottoline Morrell. In May 1915, while still serving on HMS &quot;Iron Duke&quot;, the first edition of his &quot;System of National Finance&quot; appeared. Through further editions in 1924 and 1936, it remained the standard work on Westminster&#x27;s budgetary processes until well into the 1950s.

In September 1915 he took part Admiral Troubridge&#x27;s mission to the Danube, whose aim was to stop the Austro-Hungarians sending supplies via the Black Sea to Gallipoli (in the absence of a direct land link, as Bulgaria did not join the Central Powers until October). The following month he heard his first shot fired in anger when an Austrian sentry fired a rifle at his ship.

Later in the war Young served on Harwich light cruisers, naval siege guns at Flanders, the Zeebrugge Raid in which, commanding a rear gun on , he was severely wounded, necessitating the amputation of his right arm, and, finally, in the Russian campaign, commanding an armoured train on the line south of Archangel.

His war service brought the awards of the Distinguished Service Order, Distinguished Service Cross and Bar, French Croix de guerre, and the Serbian Silver Medal. He recounted his war experiences in his 1920 memoir, &quot;By Sea and Land&quot;.

==Post-war career==
Post-war he started his rise up the political ladder in February 1919 when he was appointed Parliamentary Private Secretary to H.A.L. Fisher, President of the Board of Education. In April 1921 he was promoted to Financial Secretary to the Treasury. In this capacity he was the link between the government and the &#x27;Geddes Axe&#x27;, the committee of business experts established by Lloyd George in the aftermath of the First World War to undertake a fundamental review of government expenditure in the hope of identifying major savings.

In March 1922 Young married sculptor Kathleen Scott, née Bruce, widow of Captain Robert Falcon Scott. With the marriage he became stepfather to Kathleen&#x27;s son, the future naturalist and yachtsman, Peter Scott. In August 1923 Kathleen, aged 45, gave birth to their son Wayland Young, who became a writer and Labour politician.

Through Cambridge and Bloomsbury, Young had a long-standing friendship with E.M. Forster. Suffering writer&#x27;s block while working on &quot;A Passage to India&quot;, the novelist was Young&#x27;s guest at The Lacket in early May 1922. Shortly afterwards he wrote to Young declaring, &quot;an unfinished novel’s before me now, and sometimes I work at it with distaste and despair…You certainly have done more than any individual I know to help me by direct remarks. Your knowledge of the business of creating seemed to me profounder than that possessed by so-called artists.&quot; These comments suggest that Young gave Forster significant advice and encouragement at a crucial stage on work on the latter&#x27;s eventual masterpiece.

Out of office with the advent of Bonar Law&#x27;s Conservative administration (following the Carlton Club meeting in October 1922), he became Chief Whip for the Lloyd George Liberals and a Privy Counsellor. Speaking at the Gresham&#x27;s School prize-giving on 13 July 1923, Young &quot;...recommended the boys to go in for great risks and dangerous deeds. Let them have adventure, and the madder the adventure, the better.&quot; He lost his Norwich seat at the December 1923 General Election. Although he won the seat back at the October 1924 General Election, he devoted the rest of the 1920s to furthering his business interests.

In the City of London, Young became editor of the &quot;Financial News&quot;, 1926–29, when he introduced an Arts page which was continued by the &quot;Financial Times&quot; when they were merged in 1946. He also joined the boards of the Southern Railway, English Electric, and Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. For Westminster he became a peripatetic financial- and political-troubleshooter, undertaking inter alia financial missions to Poland (1922–3) and Iraq (1925, 1930) intended to stabilise the financial positions of these countries, the former recreated and he latter newly created after World War I. The 1930 Iraq mission saw him recommend the establishment of an Iraq Currency Board to issue a national currency, the dinar, to replace Indian rupees issued as temporary currency when British forces displaced the Ottomans from the former Mesopotamia during the First World War. The Iraqi government accepted Young&#x27;s recommendations in relation to the nation&#x27;s currency and he became the inaugural chairman of the Iraq Currency Board on 11 June 1931. He also chaired the 1925–6 Royal Commission on Indian Currency and Finance (at which his friend Maynard Keynes was a key witness) and the 1927–8 East African Commission on Closer Union.

Young joined the Conservative Party in 1926 during his term as MP for Norwich. He served as a delegate to the Assembly of the League of Nations, 1926 and 1927. In 1927 he was appointed Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire (GBE). He became MP for Sevenoaks in 1929 and served as Minister for Export Credits from 1929 and Minister of Health between 1931 and 1935. The health portfolio also included responsibility for housing, including slum clearance and rehousing. Key items of legislation to which he contributed in this period were: the Town and Country Planning Act 1932 (which applied to all &#x27;developable&#x27; land), the Housing Act 1935 (which laid down standards of accommodation) and the Restriction of Ribbon Development Act 1935 (which sought to consolidate urban development and restrict ribbon sprawl along major highways). He retired from politics in July 1935 and was created Baron Kennet.

==After politics==
Away from politics, he could now resume his life in business. By 1940, Lord Kennet was either chairman or a director of eight listed companies, which apart from the Southern Railway and timber merchants, Denny, Mott and Dickson Ltd, were engaged in the financial services and property sectors. In May 1940 he resumed his former role as chairman of the Iraq Currency Board when Leo Amery, who had replaced him as chairman in 1932, resigned on becoming a member of the wartime government. His political and financial experience made him a natural choice to chair the Capital Issues Committee during 1937–59. Responsible for advising the Chancellor of the Exchequer &quot;on applications to issue capital for any purpose anywhere&quot;, this committee was particularly important during World War II when it had to approve all issues of shares and securities with face values exceeding £10,000.

Although he never regretted his support for the two World Wars fought - as he saw it - to resist German aggression, after the Second World War he became a pacifist, feeling that nuclear weapons meant that the cost of any future war outweighed any possible benefit.

He died at the Lacket on 11 July 1960 and was succeeded to the Kennet peerage by his son Wayland.

<text>Shahid Kapoor (; born 25 February 1981) is an Indian actor who appears in Hindi films. Initially recognised for portraying romantic roles, he has since taken on parts in action films and thrillers, and is the recipient of several awards, including three Filmfare Awards.

The son of actors Pankaj Kapur and Neelima Azeem, Kapoor trained as a dancer at Shiamak Davar&#x27;s academy. He appeared as a background dancer in a few films of the 1990s, and featured in music videos and television commercials. He made his film debut in 2003 with a leading role in the romantic comedy &quot;Ishq Vishk&quot;, a sleeper hit for which he won the Filmfare Award for Best Male Debut. He followed it with roles in several commercial failures before starring in Sooraj Barjatya&#x27;s top-grossing family drama &quot;Vivah&quot; (2006).

Kapoor earned praise for playing a troubled businessman in Imtiaz Ali&#x27;s romantic comedy &quot;Jab We Met&quot; (2007) and twin brothers in Vishal Bhardwaj&#x27;s action film &quot;Kaminey&quot; (2009). Further acclaim came for portraying the Hamlet character in Bhardwaj&#x27;s tragedy &quot;Haider&quot; (2014) and a drug abusing singer in the crime drama &quot;Udta Punjab&quot; (2016). For the former, he won the Filmfare Award for Best Actor and for the latter, he won the Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor. Kapoor&#x27;s highest-grossing releases came with the period drama &quot;Padmaavat&quot; (2018) and the romantic drama &quot;Kabir Singh&quot; (2019). He has since starred in the crime drama series &quot;Farzi&quot; (2023) and the romantic comedy &quot;Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya&quot; (2024).

In addition to acting, Kapoor supports charities, hosts award ceremonies, and has featured as a talent judge on the dance reality show &quot;Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa Reloaded&quot; (2015). He is married to Mira Rajput, with whom he has two children.

== Early life and background ==
Shahid Kapoor was born in New Delhi on 25 February 1981 to actor Pankaj Kapur and actor-dancer Neelima Azeem. On his mother&#x27;s side, he is related to filmmaker and author Khwaja Ahmad Abbas. His parents divorced when he was three years old; his father shifted to Mumbai (and married the actress Supriya Pathak) and Kapoor continued living in Delhi with his mother and maternal grandparents. His grandparents were journalists for the Soviet magazine &quot;Sputnik&quot;, mostly translating works from Urdu into Russian, and Kapoor was particularly fond of his grandfather: &quot;He would walk me to school every single day. He would talk to me about Dad, with whom he shared a great relationship, and read out his letters to me.&quot; His father, who was then a struggling actor in Mumbai, would visit Kapoor only once a year on his birthday. When Kapoor was 10, his mother, who was working as a dancer, moved to Mumbai to work as an actress.

In Mumbai, Azeem went on to marry the actor Rajesh Khattar. Kapoor continued living with his mother and Khattar, until they separated in 2001. Kapoor continues to use the last name Khattar on his passport. He has a maternal half-brother, Ishaan, from his mother&#x27;s marriage to Khattar. From his father&#x27;s marriage to Pathak, he has two paternal half-siblings, Sanah and Ruhaan. Kapoor was educated at the Gyan Bharati School in Delhi and Rajhans Vidyalaya in Mumbai. He later attended Mumbai&#x27;s Mithibai College for three years.

Kapoor was interested in dance from an early age, and at the age of 15, he joined Shiamak Davar&#x27;s dance institute. As a student there, Kapoor appeared as a background dancer in the films &quot;Dil To Pagal Hai&quot; (1997) and &quot;Taal&quot; (1999), in which Davar served as choreographer. During a stage show at the institute, Kapoor performed in the songs &quot;Vogue&quot; and &quot;GoldenEye&quot; to a positive response from the audience; he described the experience as the first time that he &quot;felt like a star&quot;. He later became an instructor at the institute. During this time, Kapoor accompanied a friend to an audition for a Pepsi commercial featuring the stars Shah Rukh Khan, Kajol and Rani Mukerji, but wound up with the part himself. He appeared in television commercials for the brands Kit Kat and Close-Up, among others, and featured in music videos for several performers, including the band Aryans and the singer Kumar Sanu. Kapoor also took on the job of an assistant director to his father on the 1998 television series &quot;Mohandas B.A.L.L.B&quot;.

== Career ==
=== Early work and breakthrough (2003–2006) ===

Having noticed Kapoor in the Aryans&#x27; music video &quot;Aankhon Mein&quot;, producer Ramesh Taurani was keen to cast him in a film. However, upon meeting him, Taurani thought Kapoor, who was 20 years old at the time, to be too young and underweight to become an actor, and encouraged him to wait for a few years. Kapoor, meanwhile, turned down a lead role in N. Chandra&#x27;s sex comedy &quot;Style&quot; in hopes of working with Taurani. Taurani found a suitable project for Kapoor in the teenage romance &quot;Ishq Vishk&quot; (2003), which Ken Ghosh was directing for his company. Kapoor, who trained extensively for a bulkier physical build, was eventually hired. Before beginning work on the film, he attended acting workshops with Naseeruddin Shah and Satyadev Dubey.

&quot;Ishq Vishk&quot; tells the story of Rajiv Mathur (Kapoor), a high-school student who engages in a romantic affair with two classmates of contrasting personalities (played by Amrita Rao and Shenaz Treasurywala). Kapoor was attracted to the idea of playing an unlikable lead since it was a departure from the traditional portrayal of teenage heroes in Indian films. Writing for &quot;The Hindu&quot;, the critic Ziya Us Salam did not find him to be &quot;hero material&quot;, adding that &quot;boyhood seems to have overstayed on his face but he is not necessarily bad in the acting department.&quot; The film, however, proved to be a sleeper hit at the box office and won Kapoor the Filmfare Award for Best Male Debut.

Following his debut, Kapoor reunited with Taurani and Ghosh in a film he considered to be drastically different from &quot;Ishq Vishk&quot;. The thriller &quot;Fida&quot; (2004) featured him as a love-struck student who is manipulated by a woman (Kareena Kapoor) and her lover (Fardeen Khan) to rob a bank. Despite criticising the film, Rama Sharma of &quot;The Tribune&quot; wrote that Kapoor &quot;shines in his role. He looks fresh. As an impulsive emotional and innocent guy, who is sucked into crime because of these very qualities, he manages to evoke your sympathies.&quot; Later that year, Kapoor appeared in the romantic comedy &quot;Dil Maange More&quot; in which he was paired opposite three women: Soha Ali Khan, Tulip Joshi, and Ayesha Takia. Patcy N of Rediff.com praised his dancing skills but was wary of his imitation of Shah Rukh Khan&#x27;s acting style. Both his 2004 releases were commercially unsuccessful.

The series of poorly received films continued in 2005, when all three of Kapoor&#x27;s films failed at the box office. His first two releases that year were the comedies &quot;Deewane Huye Paagal&quot; and &quot;Vaah! Life Ho Toh Aisi!&quot;, both of which were largely panned. The former was plagiarised from the Hollywood film &quot;There&#x27;s Something About Mary&quot; in which Kapoor played one of Rimi Sen&#x27;s love interests; the critic Khalid Mohamed found Kapoor to be &quot;the only likeable element in this travesty&quot; but Namrata Joshi of &quot;Outlook&quot; labelled him &quot;colourless&quot; and criticised his pairing with Sen. His final role was that of a righteous teenager drawn towards a life of indulgence in John Matthew Matthan&#x27;s drama &quot;Shikhar&quot;, co-starring Ajay Devgan, Bipasha Basu and Amrita Rao. The critic Sukanya Verma found Kapoor to be miscast as a village boy in the film, but noted that he was &quot;never short of spontaneity and youthful exuberance&quot;.
In 2006, Kapoor played opposite Kareena Kapoor in two filmsthe thriller &quot;36 China Town&quot; and the comedy &quot;Chup Chup Ke&quot;. In &quot;36 China Town&quot;, a murder mystery from the director duo Abbas–Mustan, Kapoor starred as one of the seven suspects in the murder of an heiress, and in the Priyadarshan-directed &quot;Chup Chup Ke&quot;, he played a depressed man who pretends to be deaf and mute. The former was his first commercial success since &quot;Ishq Vishk&quot;. Greater success came to Kapoor later that year when he starred alongside Amrita Rao in Sooraj Barjatya&#x27;s romantic drama &quot;Vivah&quot;, a film depicting an arranged marriage. Made on a shoestring budget of , the film earned over worldwide, and proved to be Kapoor&#x27;s highest-grossing film to that point. Reviews of the film, however, were negative; Raja Sen termed the film a &quot;nightmare&quot; and wrote that Kapoor &quot;isn&#x27;t offensively bad, doesn&#x27;t ham it up like crazy, or speak in a weird accent. Having said that, he isn&#x27;t an actor at all, standing around working on his boyish grin, simply chewing up the scenery. No screen presence at all.&quot;

=== &quot;Jab We Met&quot;, &quot;Kaminey&quot;, and commercial fluctuations (2007–2013) ===

Kapoor found no success in his first release of 2007the ensemble comedy &quot;Fool &amp; Final&quot;. However, his second release that year, the Imtiaz Ali-directed romantic comedy &quot;Jab We Met&quot; proved to be one of the top-grossing films of the year. The film tells the story of a troubled businessman (Kapoor) whose life undergoes a series of changes after he encounters a loquacious girl (Kareena Kapoor) on a train ride. Ali thought that Kapoor&#x27;s previous roles failed to justify his acting potential, and thus approached him to portray a more complex character. The BBC noted on how &quot;endearing&quot; he was in the film and Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN wrote that he left an &quot;indelible impression with a performance that is understated and mature&quot; in a film he thought primarily belonged to Kareena Kapoor. For his performance, Kapoor received his first nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor.

After featuring opposite Vidya Balan in the romantic comedy &quot;Kismat Konnection&quot; (2008), Kapoor played twin brothers, one with a lisp and the other with a stutter, in Vishal Bhardwaj&#x27;s critically acclaimed action film &quot;Kaminey&quot; (2009). In preparation, Kapoor met speech specialists and researched on the medical and mental aspects of the two conditions. To create a lean physique for one of the brothers, a look he considered to be &quot;radically different&quot; from his personal appearance, Kapoor practised functional training and followed a rigorous diet. Writing for &quot;Variety&quot;, critic Joe Leydon reviewed that Kapoor &quot;impressively displays sufficiently variegated degrees of emotional intensity to sustain the illusion of two distinct characters. Just as important, he provides each sibling an appropriately elevated hunkiness quotient.&quot; Rediff.com listed Kapoor&#x27;s performance as the best by a Bollywood actor in 2009 and he received a second Best Actor nomination at Filmfare. &quot;Kaminey&quot; earned over worldwide. Kapoor&#x27;s final release of 2009 was as a cricketer in the Yash Raj Films production &quot;Dil Bole Hadippa!&quot;, a romantic comedy co-starring Rani Mukerji. It was screened at the Toronto International Film Festival, but was a financial failure.
In 2010, Kapoor reteamed with Ken Ghosh in &quot;Chance Pe Dance&quot;, a comedy-drama about a struggling actor, in which Kapoor&#x27;s performance was described as &quot;uneven&quot; by Aniruddha Guha of &quot;Daily News and Analysis&quot;. He had a supporting role in &quot;Paathshaala&quot;, a drama about the education system in India, starring Nana Patekar, following which he reunited with Yash Raj Films on the comedy-drama &quot;Badmaash Company&quot;, which follows a group of overambitious youngsters who become con men. Rachel Saltz of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised Kapoor&#x27;s look in the film, though Tushar Joshi of &quot;Mid-Day&quot; thought that he was miscast. Kapoor&#x27;s fourth and final release that year was Satish Kaushik&#x27;s romantic comedy &quot;Milenge Milenge&quot;, which marked his fourth collaboration with Kareena Kapoor. Plagiarised from the Hollywood film &quot;Serendipity&quot;, the production was delayed since 2005. During its production in December 2004 at Phuket, Kapoor requested a delay in filming to attend the premiere of &quot;Dil Maange More&quot;. The delay may have saved the lives of the crew, since the hotel booked for them was destroyed during the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. With the exception of &quot;Badmaash Company&quot;, none of these films performed well commercially.

Kapoor next appeared in his father&#x27;s directorial &quot;Mausam&quot; (2011); co-starring Sonam Kapoor, the star-crossed romance set over a decade, took two years to complete. Considering the film to be his &quot;dream project&quot;, Kapoor did not take on additional work while filming for it. For his role as an unambitious village boy who becomes an air force pilot, Kapoor trained to fly the F-16 Fighting Falcon. Rajeev Masand reviewed that &quot;while he doesn&#x27;t quite cut it as a convincing IAF pilot, Shahid Kapoor is terrific as the small-town brat&quot;. The film was a box office flop and Kapoor was later regretful for spending so much time on the project.

The following year, Kapoor took on another romantic role in Kunal Kohli&#x27;s &quot;Teri Meri Kahaani&quot; (2012), co-starring Priyanka Chopra. It tells the story of a pair of star-crossed lovers who are reincarnated in three different eras. &quot;Filmfare&quot; reviewed that &quot;Shahid and Priyanka give it their best shot, but their charm doesn&#x27;t make up for the absence of a genuine &quot;kahani&quot; [story]&quot;. The comedy &quot;Phata Poster Nikhla Hero&quot; from director Rajkumar Santoshi was Kapoor&#x27;s first release of 2013. His role was that of Vishwas Rao, a struggling actor who masquerades as a policeman. Critical reviews on the film were negative, though Kapoor&#x27;s performance was praised. As with his last few releases, the film earned little at the box office leading trade analysts to question his commercial appeal. This changed later that year, when he starred in Prabhu Deva&#x27;s action film &quot;R... Rajkumar&quot;; despite a negative critical reception, the film earned over worldwide, becoming Kapoor&#x27;s highest-grossing release to that point. In a scathing review, Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV called the film a &quot;massive mess&quot; and wrote that Kapoor &quot;ends up looking more moronic than macho&quot; in it. Kapoor suffered from burn injuries on his back and hands while filming a stunt sequence in &quot;R... Rajkumar&quot;.

=== Established actor and film controversies (2014–2019) ===

Kapoor next reunited with director Vishal Bhardwaj to film &quot;Haider&quot; (2014), an adaptation of William Shakespeare&#x27;s tragedy &quot;Hamlet&quot; set during the Kashmir conflict of 1995, in which he played the titular role opposite Tabu and Shraddha Kapoor. Kapoor described the film as the &quot;toughest&quot; of his career, and waived his fees to star in it. For the role, he shaved his head and learned to speak in a Kashmiri dialect. &quot;Haider&quot; garnered critical acclaim, though was controversial among Indian nationalists for its portrayal of the conflict in Kashmir. Sanjukta Sharma of &quot;Mint&quot; found the film to be an &quot;immensely effective reimagination of Shakespeare&quot; and particularly praised Kapoor for playing his part with &quot;impressive zest and inventiveness&quot;. Writing for &quot;Hindustan Times&quot;, critic Anupama Chopra wrote that Kapoor initially seemed uncomfortable in the complex central role, but added that he &quot;slowly [...] comes to inhabit Haider, veering from rage to jealousy to madness in a heartbeat.&quot; Kapoor won several awards for the role, including the Screen Award, Producers Guild Film Award and Filmfare Award for Best Actor.

After completing the duties of a talent judge on the dance reality show &quot;Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa Reloaded&quot;, Kapoor appeared opposite Alia Bhatt in Vikas Bahl&#x27;s &quot;Shaandaar&quot; (2015). A critical and commercial failure, it is about insomniacs who fall in love during a destination wedding. Kapoor next took on the role of a drug abusing rock star in &quot;Udta Punjab&quot; (2016), a crime drama from the director Abhishek Chaubey that documents the substance abuse endemic in the Indian state of Punjab. Kapoor, a teetotaler, found it challenging to play an addict. He based the role on several pop stars, and was interested in bringing out his character&#x27;s vulnerability despite his obnoxious actions. &quot;Udta Punjab&quot; generated controversy when the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) demanded extensive censorship before its theatrical release, citing that the portrayal of Punjab in it was negative. The demands sparked a debate on freedom of expression in India. After the producers filed a lawsuit against the board, the Bombay High Court cleared it for exhibition with a single scene cut, in which Kapoor&#x27;s character is shown urinating on people. Sukanya Verma took note of the film&#x27;s anti-drug message; she considered Kapoor to be &quot;spectacularly unbridled&quot; in his part and added that &quot;the believability he brings to his complex transition while preserving his inherent flakiness deserves all the praise&quot;. Kapoor won the Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor (shared with Manoj Bajpayee for &quot;Aligarh&quot;) and received a Best Actor nomination at the same ceremony.

In his third collaboration with Vishal Bharadwaj, an epic romance set during World War II entitled &quot;Rangoon&quot; (2017), Kapoor played the part of a taciturn soldier who develops a romance with a film actress (played by Kangana Ranaut). Filming was marred by a reported feud between Ranaut and Kapoor, and although they denied the reports, both stars publicly commented against the other. The film received mixed reviews; Rajeev Masand termed the film &quot;overlong, indulgent to the point of exhaustion&quot;, but praised Kapoor for playing his part with &quot;remarkable maturity&quot;. In addition, Uday Bhatia of &quot;Mint&quot; was appreciative of the chemistry between Ranaut and Kapoor. &quot;Rangoon&quot; failed to recoup its investment.

Kapoor next played Rawal Ratan Singh, a 14th-century Rajput ruler, in Sanjay Leela Bhansali&#x27;s period drama &quot;Padmaavat&quot; (2018), co-starring Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh. Amid violent protests by right-wing Hindu groups, who speculated that the film distorted historical facts, it was cleared for release by the CBFC after several modifications were made. Ankur Pathak of &quot;HuffPost&quot; was disappointed in the film&#x27;s adherence to regressive patriarchal mores and criticised Kapoor for being &quot;a bit too stiff and robotic&quot;. &quot;Padmaavat&quot; had a production budget of , making it the most expensive Hindi film ever made. With a worldwide gross of , it ranks among the highest-grossing Indian films of all time and is the biggest success of Kapoor&#x27;s career. Later that year, he starred in &quot;Batti Gul Meter Chalu&quot;, a social problem film about electricity issues in rural India, for which he learnt the Garhwali dialect. Filming was temporarily suspended when its production company, KriArj Entertainment, failed to remunerate the crew, and resumed after Bhushan Kumar took over the project. Saibal Chatterjee reviewed, &quot;Kapoor, working within a screenplay that is undercooked and confused, tries his very best to make the best of a bad deal but is unable to pack any real power&quot;.

In 2019, Kapoor starred in &quot;Kabir Singh&quot;, a remake of the Telugu romantic drama &quot;Arjun Reddy&quot; (2017), in which he played a self-destructive alcoholic pining for his ex-girlfriend. He found it challenging to distance himself from the part, and feared bringing home the experience to his wife and children. For scenes in which he played a college student, he lost 14 kg. Writing for &quot;The Indian Express&quot;, Shubhra Gupta criticised the film&#x27;s misogynistic themes and found Kapoor to be &quot;too old for this role, and his dissolution never feels as sharply realized as the one he managed so superbly in &quot;Udta Punjab&quot;&quot;. Even so, it earned over worldwide to emerge as the second highest-grossing Hindi film of the year and Kapoor&#x27;s biggest commercial success in which he played the sole male lead. He received another Best Actor nomination at Filmfare.

=== Hiatus and streaming projects (2020–present) ===
After a three-year absence from the screen, Kapoor starred in the sports drama &quot;Jersey&quot; (2022), a remake of the Telugu film of the same name, about a former cricketer who wants to make a comeback in his late 30s. While filming for a cricket sequence, he suffered an injury to his forehead that needed 13 stitches. Production and release of the film was delayed several times due to the COVID-19 pandemic. He was praised by Archika Khurana of &quot;The Times of India&quot; for his credibility as a cricketer. It did not perform well at the box office.

Kapoor was first offered a starring role in &quot;Farzi&quot;, a crime drama film from the filmmaking duo Raj &amp; DK, in 2014. By the end of the decade, it was expanded into a streaming series (a format Kapoor was keen to explore), and was released on Amazon Prime Video in 2023. He played Sunny, a disillusioned artist who decides to make counterfeit money. Scroll.in&#x27;s Nandini Ramnath found Kapoor to be in &quot;fine form despite looking too old for the part&quot;, adding that he &quot;reins in his tendency for self-pitying bombast to deliver a performance that complements Sunny’s vanity for equating counterfeiting with art&quot;. Eager to work in an intense action film, Kapoor accepted Ali Abbas Zafar&#x27;s offer to star in &quot;Bloody Daddy&quot; (2023), a remake of the French film &quot;Sleepless Night&quot; (2011). It was filmed in 36 days amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The film was digitally released on JioCinema to avoid the pitfalls of censorship in a theatrical release. Reviewers for NDTV and Rediff.com deemed the film and Kapoor&#x27;s performance &quot;adequate&quot; and &quot;serviceable&quot;. Both &quot;Farzi&quot; and &quot;Bloody Daddy&quot; had strong viewership, with the former becoming the most-watched Indian streaming series ever.

Keen to do a light-hearted role after a series of intense parts, Kapoor signed on to the romantic comedy &quot;Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya&quot; (2024), in which he starred as a man who falls in love with a humanoid robot (played by Kriti Sanon). WION&#x27;s Shomini Sen found it a &quot;middling performance&quot; by his own high standards. It emerged as a commercial success. In the following year, Kapoor played Dev Ambre, a boorish cop, in Rosshan Andrrews&#x27; action thriller &quot;Deva&quot;, a remake of Andrrews&#x27;s Malayalam film &quot;Mumbai Police&quot; (2013). Kapoor wrongly claimed during the films&#x27; promotions that it was not a remake, and it eventually had poor box-office returns. Commentators noted similarities between his roles in &quot;Deva&quot; and &quot;Kabir Singh&quot;, including &quot;Firstpost&quot; Vinamra Mathur, who wrote that despite an &quot;earnest&quot; performance, Kapoor had overplayed his character&#x27;s hypermasculinity.

Kapoor will next reteam with Bhardwaj in the action thriller &quot;Arjun Ustara&quot;.

== Off-screen work ==
In addition to acting in films, Kapoor performs on stage and hosts award ceremonies. In 2006, he participated in a world tour, entitled RockStars, in which he performed alongside Kareena Kapoor, John Abraham, Salman Khan and three other celebrities. From 201012, Kapoor has co-hosted three Screen Awards ceremonies with Shah Rukh Khan, and from 201214 he co-hosted three International Indian Film Academy Awards with either Khan or Farhan Akhtar.

He also supports charitable organisations for various causes. In 2010, he took part in a charity event named Superstars Ka Jalwa, which helped generate money for the employees of the Cine and Television Artists Association (CINTAA). Also that year, he lent his support to the NGO Swayamsiddh, which helps children with special needs. The following year, he adopted three villages in support of NDTV&#x27;s Greenathon, an initiative to support environmental consciousness and improve electricity supplies to rural areas. In 2012, Kapoor helped revive the Victory Arts Foundation NGO, founded by Shiamak Davar, which helps underprivileged children through dance therapy programs. Also that year, he appeared alongside other Bollywood celebrities in &quot;Because My World Is Not The Same&quot;, a short film by Zoya Akhtar, to generate awareness on breast cancer. He supports the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals organisation through advertisement campaigns.

== Personal life ==

Kapoor&#x27;s personal life is the subject of fervent tabloid reporting in India. During the filming of &quot;Fida&quot; in 2004, he began dating Kareena Kapoor and they both publicly spoke of the relationship. They were involved in a well-publicised scandal when &quot;Mid Day&quot; published a set of pictures of them kissing in public. Despite claims by the couple that the pictures were fabricated, the newspaper denied any wrongdoing. The couple separated in 2007 during the filming of &quot;Jab We Met&quot;. Since their split, Kapoor decided to keep his personal life away from media attention. However, tabloids speculated on his relationship with several other actresses, including Vidya Balan and Priyanka Chopra.In 2012, Kapoor lodged a police complaint of stalking against former actress Vastavikta Pandit.

In March 2015, Kapoor spoke of his impending marriage to Mira Rajput, a university student from New Delhi, who is 13 years his junior. &quot;The Times of India&quot; reported that Kapoor met Rajput through the religious group Radha Soami Satsang Beas. The couple married at a private ceremony in Gurgaon on 7 July 2015, and Rajput gave birth to their daughter Misha in August 2016 and their son Zain in September 2018.

Having met his wife through the Radha Soami, Kapoor also spiritually identifies with its teachings, the Radha Soami being a modern syncretist religious group combining elements from both Hinduism and Sikhism. Kapoor practices vegetarianism, and credits the author Brian Hines&#x27; book &quot;Life is Fair&quot; for influencing this lifestyle choice.

== Public image ==

The journalist Dave Besseling of &quot;GQ&quot;, in 2014, described Kapoor as &quot;friendly, chirpy, affable frat-boy type. Someone you&#x27;d want to play video games with on a Sunday, but keep the hell away from your sister&quot;. However, certain media publications have labelled Kapoor a recluse and described him as arrogant and temperamental. Vickey Lalwani of &quot;Mumbai Mirror&quot; wrote in 2012 that this perceived media image hindered certain filmmakers from approaching him for roles. Addressing this image, Kapoor remarked, &quot;I just don&#x27;t socialise much, I don&#x27;t party too much, I don&#x27;t know what to say to the media if I&#x27;m not talking about a film that I am doing, so yeah, maybe I am perceived as a snob.&quot;

Analysing his career, the entertainment portal Bollywood Hungama published that his &quot;boy next door persona&quot; was initially perceived by critics as a weakness, but credited him for turning it into a trademark. Jitesh Pillai of &quot;Filmfare&quot; wrote that after gaining recognition in urban romantic roles, Kapoor defied typecasting by taking on diverse parts in crime dramas and action films. He noted that Kapoor&#x27;s refusal to be &quot;slotted under any kind of tag&quot; led to a fluctuating career trajectory. Following the success of &quot;Jab We Met&quot; (2007) and &quot;Kaminey&quot; (2009), Kapoor&#x27;s career went through a decline; he described the phase as a series of &quot;wrong choices&quot; and said that taking on a challenging role in &quot;Haider&quot; (2014) helped him reinvent himself. Sonal Gera of &quot;The Indian Express&quot; opined that the film established him in Bollywood. In her book &quot;Power of a Common Man&quot;, the author Koral Dasgupta writes that Kapoor does not &quot;[conform] to any fixed rules of the trade&quot;, and notes that despite having a lopsided success ratio at the box office, he remains popular among the audiences.

A popular celebrity, Kapoor has a significant following on Twitter and Instagram. Considered one of the most attractive male celebrities in India, he regularly features in the British magazine &quot;Eastern Eye&quot;″s listing of the &quot;50 Sexiest Asian Men in the World&quot;. In 2012 and 2013 he was ranked fourth, and in 2017 he topped the list. He was ranked fifth on &quot;The Times of India&quot; list of the 50 most-desirable men in 2014; he was placed among the top 10 in 2012, 2013 and 2015. Kapoor was named the sexiest vegetarian man of India and Asia-Pacific in 2009 and 2011, respectively, by PETA. From 201215, 2017, and 2019, he featured among the top 50 in the Indian edition of the &quot;Forbes&quot;″ &quot;Celebrity 100,&quot; a list based on the income and popularity of India&#x27;s celebrities, peaking at the 15th position in 2015. Kapoor is the celebrity ambassador for several brands and products, including Samsung, Elf Aquitaine and Colgate. In 2019, his wax figure was unveiled at Madame Tussauds Singapore.

== Accolades ==

Kapoor has been the recipient of three Filmfare Awards: Best Male Debut for &quot;Ishq Vishk&quot; (2003), Best Actor for &quot;Haider&quot; (2014), and Critics Award for Best Actor for &quot;Udta Punjab&quot; (2016). He has received four more Best Actor nominations at the ceremony for &quot;Jab We Met&quot; (2007), &quot;Kaminey&quot; (2009), &quot;Udta Punjab&quot; (2016), and &quot;Kabir Singh&quot; (2019).

<doc id="1016411" wikidata="Q960366" url="?curid=1016411" title="List of compositions by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart">
<text>Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756–1791) was a prolific composer who wrote in many genres. Perhaps his best-admired works can be found within the categories of operas, piano concertos, piano sonatas, symphonies, string quartets, and string quintets. Mozart also wrote many violin sonatas; other forms of chamber music; violin concertos, and other concertos for one or more solo instruments; masses, and other religious music; organ music; masonic music; and numerous dances, marches, divertimenti, serenades, and other forms of light entertainment.

== How Mozart&#x27;s compositions are listed ==
* The indication &quot;K.&quot; or &quot;KV&quot; refers to &quot;&quot; (Köchel catalogue), i.e. the (more or less) chronological catalogue of Mozart&#x27;s works by Ludwig von Köchel. This catalogue has been amended several times, leading to ambiguity over some KV numbers (see e.g. Symphony No. 24 and Symphony No. 25, numbered K. 173dA and 173dB in the 6th edition).
* The compositions listed below are grouped thematically, i.e. by type of composition.
* Only relatively few of Mozart&#x27;s compositions have opus numbers, as not so many of his compositions were published during his lifetime, so numbering by opus number proves quite impractical for Mozart compositions.

== Sacred choral music ==
Mozart&#x27;s sacred choral music consists of masses, litanies, vespers, psalms, church music, oratorios, cantatas, a Requiem and other shorter and fragmentary works. Beginning in 1768 and ending in 1791, his sacred works are considered some of the most important and influential ever written. Pulling away from the basis of the sacred works of Bach or Handel, which at the time of his later output (around 1780 to 1791) had gone out of fashion, his sacred works eventually resulted in the Requiem, which was left unfinished at his early death in 1791.

=== Masses (1768–1783) ===
=== Litanies (1771–1776) ===
=== Vespers and psalms (1774–1780) ===
=== Church music (1767–1791) ===
=== Oratorios and cantatas (1767–1785) ===
=== Requiem (1791) ===
The Requiem in D minor was Mozart&#x27;s last composition, written between October and December of 1791. It was left unfinished at his death on 5 December 1791, and after his burial on 6 December, Constanze asked Franz Xaver Süssmayr to complete the remainder of the work (from bar 9 of the &quot;Lacrimosa&quot; to the final &quot;Communio)&quot;. Constanze originally asked Joseph Eybler, but he could not. It is thought that his great respect for the late Mozart was too great. Eybler wrote out the existing parts that Mozart had written out prior to his death, and did not go beyond the end of the ninth bar of the &quot;Lacrimosa&quot;. Eybler&#x27;s autograph is the only score of the original version of the Requiem, ending at the ninth bar of the &quot;Lacrimosa&quot;.

Süssmayr continued writing the Requiem on Mozart&#x27;s manuscript, and so it was never specified where Mozart stopped and Süssmayr started. The version by Süssmayr is the most commonly recorded and performed version of the work, with the completed &quot;Offertorium&quot;, &quot;Sanctus&quot;, &quot;Benedictus&quot; and &quot;Communio&quot;. Süssmayr made minor corrections to the &quot;Domine Jesu&quot; and &quot;Hostias&quot;, but the &quot;Sanctus&quot; is the first movement entirely by him. The 20th century has seen the appearance of numerous alternative completions that are either trying to simply correct Süssmayr&#x27;s shortcomings or going so far as eliminating as much of Süssmayr as possible.

=== Operas (1766–1791) ===

Mozart&#x27;s operas, if &quot;Die Schuldigkeit des ersten Gebots&quot;, &quot;Zaide&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;oca del Cairo&quot;, &quot;Lo sposo deluso&quot; and &quot;Der Stein der Weisen&quot; are included, add up to 23 works. The works mentioned are sometimes excluded from lists of Mozart&#x27;s operas due to their debatable form. &quot;Die Schuldigkeit des ersten Gebots&quot; is regarded as a &quot;sacred drama&quot;, &quot;Zaide&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;oca del Cairo&quot; and &quot;Lo sposo deluso&quot; are unfinished, with only uncompleted fragments making up the latter, and &quot;Der Stein der Weisen&quot; is a collaborative work.
=== Ballet music (1778–1783) ===
Mozart&#x27;s small amount of ballet music are regarded as minor works, and a majority of them are either fragmented, incomplete or spurious. His only full-scale ballets are K. Anh. 10 and K. 367, the rest are all either small stand-alone works or incomplete works. The Gavotte in B-flat, K. 300, isn&#x27;t technically ballet music, but a dance, and so would nowadays be catalogued with Mozart&#x27;s other dance music. But the Neue Mozart-Ausgabe regards it as ballet music.
=== Arias, songs and vocal ensembles (1765–1791) ===
Throughout Mozart&#x27;s life, he wrote a large number of stand-alone arias and vocal ensembles. Most of these are concert arias, with some being alternative arias or ensembles to operas. His first work in this field was written in 1765 (&quot;Va, dal furor portata&quot;) and the last in 1791 (&quot;Io ti lascio, o cara, addio&quot;). He also wrote two works for multiple vocalists (K. 479 and K. 480), either intended to be played alone or as an interjection ensemble in an operatic work. His other &quot;secular&quot; vocal works include canons and lieder.
== Orchestral works ==
=== Symphonies ===

Mozart&#x27;s symphonic production covers a 24-year interval, from 1764 to 1788. According to most recent investigations, Mozart wrote not just the 41 symphonies reported in traditional editions, but up to 68 complete works of this type. However, by convention, the original numbering has been retained, and so his last symphony is still known as &quot;No. 41&quot;. Some of the symphonies (K. 297, 385, 550) were revised by the author after their first versions.

=== Piano concertos ===

Mozart&#x27;s concertos for piano and orchestra are numbered from 1 to 27. The first four numbered concertos are early works. The movements of these concertos are arrangements of keyboard sonatas by various contemporary composers (Raupach, Honauer, Schobert, Eckart, C. P. E. Bach). There are also three unnumbered concertos, K. 107, which are adapted from piano sonatas by J. C. Bach. Concertos 7 and 10 are compositions for three and two pianos respectively. The remaining twenty-one, listed below, are original compositions for solo piano and orchestra. Among them, fifteen were written in the years from 1782 to 1786, while in the last five years Mozart wrote just two more piano concertos.

* Piano Concerto No. 5 in D major, K. 175 (1773)
* Piano Concerto No. 6 in B major, K. 238 (1776)
* Piano Concerto No. 7 in F major for Three Pianos, &quot;Lodron&quot;, K. 242 (1776)

There are also two isolated rondos for piano and orchestra:
* Rondo for piano and orchestra in D major, K. 382 (1782)
* Rondo for piano and orchestra in A major, K. 386 (1782)

The early arrangements are as follows:
* Piano Concerto No. 1 in F major, K. 37 (1767)
* Piano Concerto No. 2 in B major, K. 39 (1767)
* Piano Concerto No. 3 in D major, K. 40 (1767)
* Piano Concerto No. 4 in G major, K. 41 (1767)
* Three Piano Concertos in D major, G major and E major, K. 107 (1771 or 1765)

=== Violin concertos ===
Mozart&#x27;s five violin concertos were written in Salzburg around 1775, except the first around 1773. They are notable for the beauty of their melodies and the skillful use of the expressive and technical characteristics of the instrument, though Mozart likely never went through all the violin possibilities that others (e.g. Beethoven and Brahms) did after him. (Alfred Einstein notes that the violin concerto-like sections in the serenades are more virtuosic than in the works titled Violin Concertos.)
* Violin Concerto No. 1 in B major, K. 207 (1773)
* Violin Concerto No. 2 in D major, K. 211 (1775)
* Violin Concerto No. 3 in G major, &quot;Straßburg&quot;, K. 216 (1775)
* Violin Concerto No. 4 in D major, K. 218 (1775)
* Violin Concerto No. 5 in A major, &quot;Turkish&quot;, K. 219 (1775)

Mozart also wrote a concertone for two violins and orchestra, an adagio and two stand-alone rondos for violin and orchestra.
* Concertone for two Violins and Orchestra in C major, K. 190/186E (1774)
* Adagio for violin and orchestra in E major, K. 261 (1776)
* Rondo for violin and orchestra in B major, K. 269/261a (between 1775 and 1777)
* Rondo for violin and orchestra in C major, K. 373 (1781)

In addition, there are three works that are spuriously attributed to Mozart.
* Violin Concerto in E major, K. 268/365b/Anh. C 14.04 (&quot;No. 6&quot;) (1780) (attributed to Johann Friedrich Eck)
* Violin Concerto in D major, &quot;Kolb&quot;, K. 271a/271i (&quot;No. 7&quot;) (1777) (doubtful)
* Violin Concerto in D major, &quot;Adélaïde&quot;, K. Anh. 294a/Anh. C 14.05 (1933) (actually written by Marius Casadesus)

=== Brass concertos ===

Arguably the most widely played concertos for horn, the four Horn Concertos are a major part of most professional horn players&#x27; repertoire. They were written for Mozart&#x27;s lifelong friend Joseph Leutgeb. The concertos (especially the fourth) were written as virtuoso vehicles that allow the soloist to show a variety of abilities on the valveless horns of Mozart&#x27;s day.

The Horn Concertos are characterized by an elegant and humorous dialogue between the soloist and the orchestra. Many of the autographs contain jokes aimed at the dedicatee.
* Horn Concerto No. 1 in D major, K. 412 (1791, unfinished at Mozart&#x27;s death)
* Horn Concerto No. 2 in E major, K. 417 (1783)
* Horn Concerto No. 3 in E major, K. 447 (c. 1784–7)
* Horn Concerto No. 4 in E major, K. 495 (1786)

There are some other unfinished Mozart works for horn and orchestra:
* Horn Concerto, K. 370b+371 in E major (1781)
* Horn Concerto, K. 494a in E major (c. 1785–6)

=== Woodwind concertos ===

* Bassoon Concerto in B major, K. 191 (1774)
* Concerto for Flute, Harp, and Orchestra in C major, K. 299 (1778)
* Oboe Concerto in C major, K. 314 (1777) (has come down to us as the second flute concerto, but was almost certainly an oboe concerto)
* Flute Concerto No. 1 in G major, K. 313 (1778)
* Flute Concerto No. 2 in D major, K. 314 (1778) (an arrangement of the above Oboe Concerto)
* Andante for flute and orchestra in C major, K. 315/285e (1778)
* Clarinet Concerto in A major, K. 622 (1791; originally was for basset horn and was in the key of G major)
* Bassoon Concerto in B major, K. 230a/Anh. C 14.03 (Discovered in set of parts in The Hague attributed to Mozart; authenticity widely doubted from start. Most likely composed by François Devienne)
* Oboe Concerto in E major, K. 294b/Anh. C 14.06 (Doubtful authenticity)

;Others
* Basset Horn Concerto in G major, K. 584b/621b (fragment; transcribed and finished to become the well-known clarinet concerto)
* Oboe Concerto in F major, K. 293/416f – Allegro (fragment)
* Flute Concerto, K. 673 (lost or unrealised)

=== Concertante symphonies ===

* Sinfonia Concertante for Violin, Viola and Orchestra in E major, K. 364 (1779)
* Sinfonia Concertante for Oboe, Clarinet, Horn, Bassoon and Orchestra in E major, K. 297b (Anh. 9 and later Anh. C 14.01) (probably spurious arrangement of lost Sinfonia Concertante for Flute, Oboe, Horn, Bassoon and Orchestra from 1778)

These were not Mozart&#x27;s only attempts at the genre; another fragmentary work was also composed around the same time, though not completed.
* Sinfonia Concertante for Violin, Viola, Cello and Orchestra in A major, K. 320e (Anh. 104) (c. 1779, fragment)

=== Other concertos ===
* Concerto for Violin, Piano, and Orchestra in D major, K. 315f (Anh. 56) (1778, fragment)
* Concerto for Trumpet, K. 47c (1768, lost)
* Cello Concerto, K. 206a (1775, lost)

== Piano music ==
Mozart&#x27;s earliest composition attempts begin with piano sonatas and other piano pieces, as this is the instrument on which his musical education took place. Almost everything that he wrote for piano was intended to be played by himself (or by his sister, also a proficient piano player). Examples of his earliest works are those found in &quot;Nannerl&#x27;s Music Book&quot;. Between 1782 and 1786, Mozart wrote 20 works for piano solo (including sonatas, variations, fantasias, suites, fugues, rondo) and works for piano four hands and two pianos.

;Others
*Allegro in C minor for Two Pianos, K.Anh. 44/426a (1783-86; fragment)

== Chamber music ==
=== Chamber music with piano ===
==== Violin music ====
Mozart also wrote sonatas for keyboard and violin. For the most part, these are keyboard-centric sonatas where the violin plays a more accompanying role. In later years, the role of the violin grew to not just a support to the other solo instrument, but to build a dialogue with it.

The &#x27;Violin Sonatas&#x27;, KV 10–15, are unique in that they include an &quot;ad lib.&quot; cello part along with the score for violin and keyboard. The &quot;Neue Mozart-Ausgabe&quot; (1966) therefore includes them along with the other keyboard trios, although the Köchel catalogue (K6, 1964) lists them as normal violin sonatas.

These quartets are often regarded as among the pinnacles of the genre.

=== Dances ===
Mozart left a huge production of dances for orchestra in different genres, including more than 100 minuets, over 30 contra dances, over 50 allemandes (&quot;Teitsch&quot;, &quot;Ländler&quot;, or German Dances), a gavotte (French folk dance) and ballet and pantomime music.

In his production of minuets, Mozart generally followed Haydn&#x27;s example, preferring the slow character of the dance. Allemandes written between 1787 and 1791 were mainly for public balls in Vienna. In the Contredanse production, also written mainly in Vienna, some examples of program music are found, like &quot;Il Temporale&quot;, K. 534, &quot;La Bataille&quot;, K. 535, &quot;Canary&quot;, K. 600/5, etc.

== Sacred music ==
Mozart&#x27;s sacred music is mainly vocal, though also instrumental examples exist, like the seventeen &quot;Sonate da chiesa&quot;, composed between 1772 and 1780. His sacred music presents a rich stylistic mosaic: Gregorian choral elements meet rigorous counterpoint, and even operatic elements can sometimes emerge. Stylistic unity and consistency is present over all his sacred music work.

<doc id="1016414" wikidata="Q2583235" url="?curid=1016414" title="Bromsgrove Rovers F.C.">
<text>Bromsgrove Rovers F.C. was a non-League football club from the town of Bromsgrove in Worcestershire. The peak of the club&#x27;s success was in 1993 when Rovers finished runner-up in the Football Conference. They went into administration during the 2009–10 season while they were playing in the Southern League Division One (Midlands) and were thrown out of the league before the 2010–11 season for not having a ground to play at. Their ground is today used by successor club Bromsgrove Sporting.

== History ==

=== The first years ===
Bromsgrove Rovers were formed in 1885 and initially played in the local Studley &amp; District League, during which time they played on at least four grounds before arriving at Victoria Ground in 1910. Rovers were promoted to the Birmingham &amp; District League in 1898, where they were runners up in the 1904–05 season. The club switched to the Birmingham Combination in 1908, where they were to remain until 1954 when it was absorbed into the Birmingham &amp; District League [later renamed the West Midlands (Regional) League]. Rovers were champions of the Combination on two occasions (1946–47 &amp; 1959–60) and runners-up on four other occasions. The club also made the FA Cup first round proper for the first time in 1947, losing 2–1 to Aldershot. Long-serving managers during this period were Joe Wainwright (known affectionately as &#x27;Gentleman Joe&#x27;) and former Birmingham City goalkeeper Gill Merrick.

In 1972 Rovers joined the Southern Football League, initially in Division One North. In 1979 the league was re-organised and they were placed in the Midland Division. After a series of relatively uneventful seasons the former Scottish international and West Bromwich Albion legend Bobby Hope was appointed manager. Hope transformed the club&#x27;s ambitions, and Rovers won the Midland Division in 1985–86 to gain a place in the Premier Division. Rovers also won the Southern League Cup that season to achieve a league/cup double. In 1986–87 Rovers almost gained back to back promotions but finished Premier Division runners-up to Fisher Athletic.

This was the start of the most successful period in the club&#x27;s history, particularly under the management of Bobby Hope. After five years of consolidation, the 1991–92 season saw a remarkable run of 15 consecutive home wins to pip Dover Athletic to the Premier Division title with a game to spare. This saw Bromsgrove promoted to the Football Conference, the highest level of non-league football in England.

=== Football Conference ===

The remarkable form from the promotion season continued during the 1992–93 season. Bromsgrove were one of the smallest clubs in the Conference, yet managed to finish runners-up to the eventual champions Wycombe Wanderers, albeit with a 15-point gap between the teams. One of the many highlights was a 1–0 home victory over Wycombe, one of only seven league defeats suffered by Martin O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s champions that season.

The following season, 1993–94, saw Bromsgrove get past the first round (proper) of the FA Cup for the first time, claiming their only ever league scalp with an away 2–1 victory over Northampton Town. After another away victory in the second round (against fellow Conference side Yeovil Town), Bromsgrove were drawn at home to Barnsley. A capacity crowd of 4,893 was in attendance for the game. Bromsgrove were 1–0 up with just two minutes of time remaining, when Barnsley scored two late goals to end up winners. In post-match comments, the Barnsley manager Viv Anderson described his team as &quot;the luckiest in the world&quot;.

After their cup exit Rovers endured a poor run of league results and had to rely on a 1–0 away win at league runners-up Kettering Town in the final match to avoid relegation. The 1994–95 season saw the departure of Bobby Hope, frustrated at the club&#x27;s financial constraints. His replacement was former Republic of Ireland international Tony Grealish who only lasted a few months. The club had to appoint captain Kevin Richardson and Youth Team Manager John Dyer on a temporary basis, but were rewarded when Bromsgrove won the Conference League Cup (or &quot;Spalding Cup&quot; at the time). In fact they became the first team in the competition&#x27;s history to win it back to back. The 1994–95 final saw Bromsgrove involved in a high scoring 10–2 aggregate victory over Kettering Town. In the 1995–96 final Rovers beat Macclesfield Town 4–2 on aggregate.

Bromsgrove were relegated from the Conference back to the Southern League in 1996–97. By this time Brian Kenning was in charge, and many of the club&#x27;s finest players had also either left, retired, or were past their best. These included the inspirational captain Kevin &#x27;Psycho&#x27; Richardson, Paul Webb (who controversially left to join local rivals Kidderminster Harriers), Chris Hanks (Rovers&#x27; all-time top-scorer with 236 goals in 424 appearances), Shaun O&#x27;Meara (763 appearances for the club), Scott Cooksey (sold to Peterborough United), Steve Taylor (sold to Crystal Palace) and Martin O&#x27;Connor, who went on to have a successful league career with Birmingham City.

=== Later years ===
After this the club went into an almost constant decline. Their relegation to the Southern League Premier Division in 1996–97 was followed by relegation to Division One West in 1998–99 and then to the Midland Football Alliance in 2000–01. Promotion back to the Southern League was gained at the first attempt under the management of Gary Hackett and Jon Ford, but the club still found itself a long way removed from its successes of the early 1990s. From an average support of 1,500 per game in the first Conference season, attendance was frequently as low as the mid 200s.
In the 2006–07 season, with Rod Brown as manager, Bromsgrove reached the Division One West playoffs, as they finished runners up to Brackley Town. They defeated Evesham United 1–0 in the semi-final then came from a goal down in the final to beat Willenhall Town 2–1 in the final, returning to the Southern League Premier Division for the 2007–08 season.

After a bright start to 2007–08, a poor run of results saw manager Rod Brown dismissed. Duane Darby was put in temporary charge and initial results saw the team climb back into the top half of the table. Needing only three wins to guarantee Premier Division status (out of the last 10) the team plummeted to an abysmal run of results, with Darby still in control, which included defeats at already relegated Cheshunt and Cirencester Town. A final day defeat at Rugby Town (Rod Brown&#x27;s new team) saw Bromsgrove Rovers relegated leading to protests against the controlling shareholder and sole director, Tom Herbert, in the close season and an attempted takeover by a fans&#x27; consortium.

Darby was sacked after a poor start to the 2008–09 season which led to Rod Brown returning to the club from Rugby for a second stint as manager. Results under Brown did improve but Bromsgrove finished the season in 13th place with rumours continuing to circulate about the club&#x27;s future. At the end of the season Rod Brown resigned as manager to take over as manager of Midland Football Alliance team Stratford Town. Former player and fans&#x27; favourite John Snape was announced as the new manager in mid May.

=== Financial trouble ===
An unbeaten seven game start to the 2009–10 season and possibilities of a promotion run were abruptly brought back down to earth with first the presentation of a winding-up petition and then director Tom Herbert requesting a court order to appoint an acquaintance of Director of Football, Steve Daniels, as administrator. Information provided in the Administration application showed that the club&#x27;s creditors figure had risen from £127,141 in May 2008 to £533,265 in September 2009 with no corresponding increase in assets. The fans&#x27; consortium which attempted to take over the club at the end of the 2007–08 season was thought to be attempting to secure the future of the club through a Community Interest Company, but it was announced in November that a bid had been accepted from a man named Mike Ward. In spite of the announcement, in May 2010, the sale still did not appear to have been completed and the intended aim of winding up the club was still awaited. The club meanwhile had narrowly escaped relegation and gates had reached new lows.

With the lease of the Victoria Ground expiring in the close season, the landlord announced that it was open to applications for a new lease. The fans&#x27; consortium announced that they had started a new club – Bromsgrove Sporting – and had applied for the lease.
On 4 June 2010, the District Council announced that Bromsgrove Sporting were to be awarded the new lease for the ground, it was planned that Bromsgrove Rovers would continue to play their home matches there. Negotiations with Sporting stalled however when Rovers said that they could not afford to pay the hire charge (having told the Council that they did not plan to pay rent when applying for the new lease) and at the time of expiry of the lease in early August it appeared that Rovers were intending to occupy the ground until a court order removed them. On 11 August 2010, Rovers were thrown out of the Southern League after not being able to show that they had a ground to play at. Manager and director of football Steve Daniels resigned, and the club did not play football thereafter.

<text>Kurt Karl-Heinrich Ahrens, also known as Kurt Ahrens Jr., (born 19 April 1940 in Braunschweig, Germany) is a former sports car racing and touring car racing driver who occasionally appeared in German Grand Prix races, mostly in Formula 2 cars.

His father, Kurt Ahrens Sr., was a German speedway champion who competed against his son for five years. Kurt Ahrens Jr. started in 1958 with a Cooper-Norton Formula 3 and won the German Formula Junior title in 1961 and 1963, when his father retired.
He then raced Formula 2 and was present when Jim Clark was killed at the Hockenheimring in 1968. Due to the long Nürburgring track, it was possible to take part in the German Grand Prix in Formula 2 cars. He participated mostly with Brabhams for the Caltex Racing team, and was invited to drive the Brabham-Repco F1 in the wet 1968 German Grand Prix.

In 1968, Ahrens Jr. joined the Porsche factory sports car team and shared victory with Jo Siffert in the 1969 Austrian 1000 km event. He co-drove the pole-setting Porsche 917 &quot;long tail&quot; at the 1969 24 Hours of Le Mans and the 1970 24 Hours of Le Mans, but neither car finished. In 1970, he partnered with Vic Elford to win the 1000km Nürburgring in a Porsche 908.

Ahrens retired after 1970, taking pride in never crashing in a race. He had suffered a high speed shunt in April 1970 while testing a long tail Porsche on a wet Ehra-Lessien, with the car disintegrating badly- the car went under the Armco barrier and broke in half (as they were known to do), leaving Ahrens strapped in the back.

<text>Edwin Samuel Montagu PC (6 February 1879 – 15 November 1924) was a British Liberal politician who served as Secretary of State for India between 1917 and 1922. Montagu was a &quot;radical&quot; Liberal and the third practising Jew (after Sir Herbert Samuel and Sir Rufus Isaacs) to serve in the British cabinet.

He was primarily responsible for the Montagu–Chelmsford Reforms which led to the Government of India Act 1919, committing the British to the eventual evolution of India towards dominion status.

==Background and education==
Montagu was the second son and sixth child of Samuel Montagu, 1st Baron Swaythling, by his wife Ellen, daughter of Louis Cohen. He was educated at Doreck College, Clifton College, the City of London School, University College London and Trinity College, Cambridge. At Cambridge, he was the first student president of the Cambridge University Liberal Club from 1902 to 1903. In 1902, he was also president of the Cambridge Union.

==Political career==

Montagu was elected Member of Parliament for Chesterton in 1906, a seat he held until 1918, and then represented Cambridgeshire until 1922. He served under H. H. Asquith as Under-Secretary of State for India from 1910 to 1914, as Financial Secretary to the Treasury from 1914 to 1915 and again from 1915 to 1916 and as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster (with a seat in the Cabinet) in 1915 and 1916. In 1915 he was sworn of the Privy Council. In 1916 he was promoted to Minister of Munitions.

Montagu was a friend of Asquith, Gertrude Bell, Lord Lloyd, Maurice Hankey and Duff Cooper, with whom he dined frequently. When Hankey was promoted to the newly created post of Cabinet Secretary, he recommended Montagu as Minister for National Service, for which he was considered in December 1916 (the job was given in the end to Neville Chamberlain). Instead he was initially left out of David Lloyd George&#x27;s coalition government in December 1916, but in August 1917 he was appointed Secretary of State for India. Montagu was not initially part of Lloyd George&#x27;s inner circle, when he became Prime Minister, but he remained in office until his resignation in March 1922.

As Secretary of State, Montagu represented the interests of the British Empire and opposed the most strident Indian nationalists, calling S. Subramania Iyer the &quot;Grand old man of South India.&quot; Montagu led the Indian delegation at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, where he opposed plans for dividing Turkey (including the Greek occupation of Smyrna and the projected removal of the Sultan from Constantinople). On this subject, at the Council of Four on 17 May 1919, he introduced representatives of Muslim India (including the Aga Khan) and urged that Muslim peoples were beginning to see the Conference as &quot;taking sides against Islam&quot;.

He was primarily responsible for the Montagu–Chelmsford Reforms which led to the Government of India Act 1919, committing the British to the eventual evolution of India towards dominion status.

==Anti-Zionism==
Despite his father&#x27;s active support for the cause, Montagu was strongly opposed to Zionism, which he called &quot;a mischievous political creed&quot;, and opposed the Balfour Declaration of 1917, which he considered anti-Semitic and whose terms he managed to modify. In a memo to the Cabinet, he outlined his views on Zionism:...I assume that it means that Mahommedans [Muslims] and Christians are to make way for the Jews and that the Jews should be put in all positions of preference and should be peculiarly associated with Palestine in the same way that England is with the English or France with the French, that Turks and other Mahommedans in Palestine will be regarded as foreigners, just in the same way as Jews will hereafter be treated as foreigners in every country but Palestine. Perhaps also citizenship must be granted only as a result of a religious test. He was opposed by his cousin Herbert Samuel, a moderate Zionist, who became the first High Commissioner of the British Mandate of Palestine.

==Family==

In 1912, Montagu accompanied the prime minister on holiday in Sicily. H. H. Asquith brought along his daughter Violet, and she in turn brought her friend Venetia Stanley, daughter of Edward Stanley, 4th Baron Stanley of Alderley. It appears that during this holiday, both men fell in love with Stanley.

During the next three years Asquith wrote more and more frequently to her, even during Cabinet meetings. At the same time, Montagu was attempting to court her, unsuccessfully proposing marriage in 1913. She liked him but did not reciprocate his love. Also, Montagu had to marry within his Jewish faith to keep his inheritance. Although Stanley was from a freethinking family and was not a devout Anglican, conversion to Judaism seemed too great a barrier. However, Asquith&#x27;s epistolary obsession with Venetia and his constant demands for advice apparently became overwhelming even for this intelligent and well-read woman, keenly interested in politics as she was. As a result, she finally accepted Montagu&#x27;s proposal on 28 April 1915. She converted to Judaism, and the couple were wed on 26 July 1915.

In 1923 a child was born, Judith Venetia Montagu. She grew up to befriend Princess Margaret during World War II and marry the American photographer Milton Gendel, with whom she created an artistic salon in Italy. They had one child, Anna Mathias (née Gendel), the god-daughter of Princess Margaret.

Despite his wife&#x27;s affairs, Montagu&#x27;s marriage lasted until his death in 1924. The cause of his physical deterioration and death at the age of 45 was unknown, but was thought to be either blood poisoning or encephalitis.

<doc id="1016422" wikidata="Q130249272" url="?curid=1016422" title="Curved spacetime">
<text>In physics, curved spacetime is the mathematical model in which, with Einstein&#x27;s theory of general relativity, gravity naturally arises, as opposed to being described as a fundamental force in Newton&#x27;s static Euclidean reference frame. Objects move along geodesics—curved paths determined by the local geometry of spacetime—rather than being influenced directly by distant bodies. This framework led to two fundamental principles: coordinate independence, which asserts that the laws of physics are the same regardless of the coordinate system used, and the equivalence principle, which states that the effects of gravity are indistinguishable from those of acceleration in sufficiently small regions of space. These principles laid the groundwork for a deeper understanding of gravity through the geometry of spacetime, as formalized in Einstein&#x27;s field equations.

==Introduction==
Newton&#x27;s theories assumed that motion takes place against the backdrop of a rigid Euclidean reference frame that extends throughout all space and all time. Gravity is mediated by a mysterious force, acting instantaneously across a distance, whose actions are independent of the intervening space. In contrast, Einstein denied that there is any background Euclidean reference frame that extends throughout space. Nor is there any such thing as a force of gravitation, only the structure of spacetime itself.
In spacetime terms, the path of a satellite orbiting the Earth is not dictated by the distant influences of the Earth, Moon and Sun. Instead, the satellite moves through space only in response to local conditions. Since spacetime is everywhere locally flat when considered on a sufficiently small scale, the satellite is always following a straight line in its local inertial frame. We say that the satellite always follows along the path of a geodesic. No evidence of gravitation can be discovered following alongside the motions of a single particle.

In any analysis of spacetime, evidence of gravitation requires that one observe the relative accelerations of &quot;two&quot; bodies or two separated particles. In Fig. 5-1, two separated particles, free-falling in the gravitational field of the Earth, exhibit tidal accelerations due to local inhomogeneities in the gravitational field such that each particle follows a different path through spacetime. The tidal accelerations that these particles exhibit with respect to each other do not require forces for their explanation. Rather, Einstein described them in terms of the geometry of spacetime, i.e. the curvature of spacetime. These tidal accelerations are strictly local. It is the cumulative total effect of many local manifestations of curvature that result in the &quot;appearance&quot; of a gravitational force acting at a long range from Earth.

Two central propositions underlie general relativity.
* The first crucial concept is coordinate independence: The laws of physics cannot depend on what coordinate system one uses. This is a major extension of the principle of relativity from the version used in special relativity, which states that the laws of physics must be the same for every observer moving in non-accelerated (inertial) reference frames. In general relativity, to use Einstein&#x27;s own (translated) words, &quot;the laws of physics must be of such a nature that they apply to systems of reference in any kind of motion.&quot; This leads to an immediate issue: In accelerated frames, one feels forces that seemingly would enable one to assess one&#x27;s state of acceleration in an absolute sense. Einstein resolved this problem through the principle of equivalence.

* The equivalence principle states that in any sufficiently small region of space, the effects of gravitation are the same as those from acceleration. In Fig. 5-2, person A is in a spaceship, far from any massive objects, that undergoes a uniform acceleration of &quot;g&quot;. Person B is in a box resting on Earth. Provided that the spaceship is sufficiently small so that tidal effects are non-measurable (given the sensitivity of current gravity measurement instrumentation, A and B presumably should be Lilliputians), there are no experiments that A and B can perform which will enable them to tell which setting they are in. An alternative expression of the equivalence principle is to note that in Newton&#x27;s universal law of gravitation, &quot;m&quot;g&quot;g&quot; and in Newton&#x27;s second law, there is no &quot;a priori&quot; reason why the gravitational mass &quot;m&quot;g should be equal to the inertial mass &quot;m&quot;i. The equivalence principle states that these two masses are identical.

To go from the elementary description above of curved spacetime to a complete description of gravitation requires tensor calculus and differential geometry, topics both requiring considerable study. Without these mathematical tools, it is possible to write &quot;about&quot; general relativity, but it is not possible to demonstrate any non-trivial derivations.

== Curvature of time ==

In the discussion of special relativity, forces played no more than a background role. Special relativity assumes the ability to define inertial frames that fill all of spacetime, all of whose clocks run at the same rate as the clock at the origin. Is this really possible? In a nonuniform gravitational field, experiment dictates that the answer is no. Gravitational fields make it impossible to construct a &quot;global&quot; inertial frame. In small enough regions of spacetime, &quot;local&quot; inertial frames are still possible. General relativity involves the systematic stitching together of these local frames into a more general picture of spacetime.

Years before publication of the general theory in 1916, Einstein used the equivalence principle to predict the existence of gravitational redshift in the following thought experiment: (i) Assume that a tower of height &quot;h&quot; (Fig. 5-3) has been constructed. (ii) Drop a particle of rest mass &quot;m&quot; from the top of the tower. It falls freely with acceleration &quot;g&quot;, reaching the ground with velocity , so that its total energy &quot;E&quot;, as measured by an observer on the ground, is (iii) A mass-energy converter transforms the total energy of the particle into a single high energy photon, which it directs upward. (iv) At the top of the tower, an energy-mass converter transforms the energy of the photon &quot;E″&quot; back into a particle of rest mass &quot;m&quot;″.

It must be that , since otherwise one would be able to construct a perpetual motion device. We therefore predict that , so that
: formula_1

A photon climbing in Earth&#x27;s gravitational field loses energy and is redshifted. Early attempts to measure this redshift through astronomical observations were somewhat inconclusive, but definitive laboratory observations were performed by Pound &amp; Rebka (1959) and later by Pound &amp; Snider (1964).

Light has an associated frequency, and this frequency may be used to drive the workings of a clock. The gravitational redshift leads to an important conclusion about time itself: Gravity makes time run slower. Suppose we build two identical clocks whose rates are controlled by some stable atomic transition. Place one clock on top of the tower, while the other clock remains on the ground. An experimenter on top of the tower observes that signals from the ground clock are lower in frequency than those of the clock next to her on the tower. Light going up the tower is just a wave, and it is impossible for wave crests to disappear on the way up. Exactly as many oscillations of light arrive at the top of the tower as were emitted at the bottom. The experimenter concludes that the ground clock is running slow, and can confirm this by bringing the tower clock down to compare side by side with the ground clock. For a 1 km tower, the discrepancy would amount to about 9.4 nanoseconds per day, easily measurable with modern instrumentation.

Clocks in a gravitational field do not all run at the same rate. Experiments such as the Pound–Rebka experiment have firmly established curvature of the time component of spacetime. The Pound–Rebka experiment says nothing about curvature of the &quot;space&quot; component of spacetime. But the theoretical arguments predicting gravitational time dilation do not depend on the details of general relativity at all. &quot;Any&quot; theory of gravity will predict gravitational time dilation if it respects the principle of equivalence. This includes Newtonian gravitation. A standard demonstration in general relativity is to show how, in the &quot;Newtonian limit&quot; (i.e. the particles are moving slowly, the gravitational field is weak, and the field is static), curvature of time alone is sufficient to derive Newton&#x27;s law of gravity.

Newtonian gravitation is a theory of curved time. General relativity is a theory of curved time &quot;and&quot; curved space. Given &quot;G&quot; as the gravitational constant, &quot;M&quot; as the mass of a Newtonian star, and orbiting bodies of insignificant mass at distance &quot;r&quot; from the star, the spacetime interval for Newtonian gravitation is one for which only the time coefficient is variable:
: formula_2

== Curvature of space ==
The formula_3 coefficient in front of formula_4 describes the curvature of time in Newtonian gravitation, and this curvature completely accounts for all Newtonian gravitational effects. As expected, this correction factor is directly proportional to formula_5 and formula_6, and because of the formula_7 in the denominator, the correction factor increases as one approaches the gravitating body, meaning that time is curved.

But general relativity is a theory of curved space &quot;and&quot; curved time, so if there are terms modifying the spatial components of the spacetime interval presented above, should not their effects be seen on, say, planetary and satellite orbits due to curvature correction factors applied to the spatial terms?

The answer is that they &quot;are&quot; seen, but the effects are tiny. The reason is that planetary velocities are extremely small compared to the speed of light, so that for planets and satellites of the solar system, the formula_4 term dwarfs the spatial terms.

Despite the minuteness of the spatial terms, the first indications that something was wrong with Newtonian gravitation were discovered over a century-and-a-half ago. In 1859, Urbain Le Verrier, in an analysis of available timed observations of transits of Mercury over the Sun&#x27;s disk from 1697 to 1848, reported that known physics could not explain the orbit of Mercury, unless there possibly existed a planet or asteroid belt within the orbit of Mercury. The perihelion of Mercury&#x27;s orbit exhibited an excess rate of precession over that which could be explained by the tugs of the other planets. The ability to detect and accurately measure the minute value of this anomalous precession (only 43 arc seconds per tropical century) is testimony to the sophistication of 19th century astrometry.
As the astronomer who had earlier discovered the existence of Neptune &quot;at the tip of his pen&quot; by analyzing irregularities in the orbit of Uranus, Le Verrier&#x27;s announcement triggered a two-decades long period of &quot;Vulcan-mania&quot;, as professional and amateur astronomers alike hunted for the hypothetical new planet. This search included several false sightings of Vulcan. It was ultimately established that no such planet or asteroid belt existed.

In 1916, Einstein was to show that this anomalous precession of Mercury is explained by the spatial terms in the curvature of spacetime. Curvature in the temporal term, being simply an expression of Newtonian gravitation, has no part in explaining this anomalous precession. The success of his calculation was a powerful indication to Einstein&#x27;s peers that the general theory of relativity could be correct.

The most spectacular of Einstein&#x27;s predictions was his calculation that the curvature terms in the spatial components of the spacetime interval could be measured in the bending of light around a massive body. Light has a slope of ±1 on a spacetime diagram. Its movement in space is equal to its movement in time. For the weak field expression of the invariant interval, Einstein calculated an exactly equal but opposite sign curvature in its spatial components.
: formula_9formula_10

In Newton&#x27;s gravitation, the formula_3 coefficient in front of formula_4 predicts bending of light around a star. In general relativity, the formula_13 coefficient in front of formula_14 predicts a &quot;doubling&quot; of the total bending.

The story of the 1919 Eddington eclipse expedition and Einstein&#x27;s rise to fame is well told elsewhere.

== Sources of spacetime curvature ==

In Newton&#x27;s theory of gravitation, the only source of gravitational force is mass.

In contrast, general relativity identifies several sources of spacetime curvature in addition to mass. In the Einstein field equations,

the sources of gravity are presented on the right-hand side in formula_15 the stress–energy tensor.

Fig. 5-5 classifies the various sources of gravity in the stress–energy tensor:
* formula_16 (red): The total mass–energy density, including any contributions to the potential energy from forces between the particles, as well as kinetic energy from random thermal motions.
* formula_17 and formula_18 (orange): These are momentum density terms. Even if there is no bulk motion, energy may be transmitted by heat conduction, and the conducted energy will carry momentum.
* formula_19 are the rates of flow of the of momentum per unit area in the . Even if there is no bulk motion, random thermal motions of the particles will give rise to momentum flow, so the terms (green) represent isotropic pressure, and the terms (blue) represent shear stresses.

One important conclusion to be derived from the equations is that, colloquially speaking, &quot;gravity itself creates gravity&quot;. Energy has mass. Even in Newtonian gravity, the gravitational field is associated with an energy, called the gravitational potential energy. In general relativity, the energy of the gravitational field feeds back into creation of the gravitational field. This makes the equations nonlinear and hard to solve in anything other than weak field cases. Numerical relativity is a branch of general relativity using numerical methods to solve and analyze problems, often employing supercomputers to study black holes, gravitational waves, neutron stars and other phenomena in the strong field regime.

=== Energy-momentum ===
In special relativity, mass-energy is closely connected to momentum. Just as space and time are different aspects of a more comprehensive entity called spacetime, mass–energy and momentum are merely different aspects of a unified, four-dimensional quantity called four-momentum. In consequence, if mass–energy is a source of gravity, momentum must also be a source. The inclusion of momentum as a source of gravity leads to the prediction that moving or rotating masses can generate fields analogous to the magnetic fields generated by moving charges, a phenomenon known as gravitomagnetism.
It is well known that the force of magnetism can be deduced by applying the rules of special relativity to moving charges. (An eloquent demonstration of this was presented by Feynman in volume II, of his &quot;Lectures on Physics&quot;, available online.) Analogous logic can be used to demonstrate the origin of gravitomagnetism.

In Fig. 5-7a, two parallel, infinitely long streams of massive particles have equal and opposite velocities −&quot;v&quot; and +&quot;v&quot; relative to a test particle at rest and centered between the two. Because of the symmetry of the setup, the net force on the central particle is zero. Assume so that velocities are simply additive. Fig. 5-7b shows exactly the same setup, but in the frame of the upper stream. The test particle has a velocity of +&quot;v&quot;, and the bottom stream has a velocity of +2&quot;v&quot;. Since the physical situation has not changed, only the frame in which things are observed, the test particle should not be attracted towards either stream.

It is not at all clear that the forces exerted on the test particle are equal. (1) Since the bottom stream is moving faster than the top, each particle in the bottom stream has a larger mass energy than a particle in the top. (2) Because of Lorentz contraction, there are more particles per unit length in the bottom stream than in the top stream. (3) Another contribution to the active gravitational mass of the bottom stream comes from an additional pressure term which, at this point, we do not have sufficient background to discuss. All of these effects together would seemingly demand that the test particle be drawn towards the bottom stream.

The test particle is not drawn to the bottom stream because of a velocity-dependent force that serves to repel a particle &quot;that is moving in the same direction as the bottom stream.&quot; This velocity-dependent gravitational effect is gravitomagnetism.

Matter in motion through a gravitomagnetic field is hence subject to so-called &quot;frame-dragging&quot; effects analogous to electromagnetic induction. It has been proposed that such gravitomagnetic forces underlie the generation of the relativistic jets (Fig. 5-8) ejected by some rotating supermassive black holes.

=== Pressure and stress ===
Quantities that are directly related to energy and momentum should be sources of gravity as well, namely internal pressure and stress. Taken together, , momentum, pressure and stress all serve as sources of gravity: Collectively, they are what tells spacetime how to curve.

General relativity predicts that pressure acts as a gravitational source with exactly the same strength as mass–energy density. The inclusion of pressure as a source of gravity leads to dramatic differences between the predictions of general relativity versus those of Newtonian gravitation. For example, the pressure term sets a maximum limit to the mass of a neutron star. The more massive a neutron star, the more pressure is required to support its weight against gravity. The increased pressure, however, adds to the gravity acting on the star&#x27;s mass. Above a certain mass determined by the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit, the process becomes runaway and the neutron star collapses to a black hole.

The stress terms become highly significant when performing calculations such as hydrodynamic simulations of core-collapse supernovae.

These predictions for the roles of pressure, momentum and stress as sources of spacetime curvature are elegant and play an important role in theory. In regards to pressure, the early universe was radiation dominated, and it is highly unlikely that any of the relevant cosmological data (e.g. nucleosynthesis abundances, etc.) could be reproduced if pressure did not contribute to gravity, or if it did not have the same strength as a source of gravity as mass–energy. Likewise, the mathematical consistency of the Einstein field equations would be broken if the stress terms did not contribute as a source of gravity.

== Experimental test of the sources of spacetime curvature ==
=== Definitions: Active, passive, and inertial mass ===
Bondi distinguishes between different possible types of mass: (1) is the mass which acts as the source of a gravitational field; (2) is the mass which reacts to a gravitational field; (3) is the mass which reacts to acceleration.
* formula_20 is the same as in the discussion of the equivalence principle.

In Newtonian theory,
* The third law of action and reaction dictates that formula_21 and formula_20 must be the same.
* On the other hand, whether formula_20 and formula_24 are equal is an empirical result.

In general relativity,
* The equality of formula_20 and formula_24 is dictated by the equivalence principle.
* There is no &quot;action and reaction&quot; principle dictating any necessary relationship between formula_21 and formula_20.

=== Pressure as a gravitational source ===

The classic experiment to measure the strength of a gravitational source (i.e. its active mass) was first conducted in 1797 by Henry Cavendish (Fig. 5-9a). Two small but dense balls are suspended on a fine wire, making a torsion balance. Bringing two large test masses close to the balls introduces a detectable torque. Given the dimensions of the apparatus and the measurable spring constant of the torsion wire, the gravitational constant &quot;G&quot; can be determined.

To study pressure effects by compressing the test masses is hopeless, because attainable laboratory pressures are insignificant in comparison with the of a metal ball.

However, the repulsive electromagnetic pressures resulting from protons being tightly squeezed inside atomic nuclei are typically on the order of 1028 atm ≈ 1033 Pa ≈ 1033 kg·s−2m−1. This amounts to about 1% of the nuclear mass density of approximately 1018kg/m3 (after factoring in c2 ≈ 9×1016m2s−2).
If pressure does not act as a gravitational source, then the ratio formula_29 should be lower for nuclei with higher atomic number &quot;Z&quot;, in which the electrostatic pressures are higher. (1968) did a Cavendish experiment using a Teflon mass suspended in a mixture of the liquids trichloroethylene and dibromoethane having the same buoyant density as the Teflon (Fig. 5-9b). Fluorine has atomic number , while bromine has . Kreuzer found that repositioning the Teflon mass caused no differential deflection of the torsion bar, hence establishing active mass and passive mass to be equivalent to a precision of 5×10−5.

Although Kreuzer originally considered this experiment merely to be a test of the ratio of active mass to passive mass, Clifford Will (1976) reinterpreted the experiment as a fundamental test of the coupling of sources to gravitational fields.

In 1986, Bartlett and Van Buren noted that lunar laser ranging had detected a 2 km offset between the moon&#x27;s center of figure and its center of mass. This indicates an asymmetry in the distribution of Fe (abundant in the Moon&#x27;s core) and Al (abundant in its crust and mantle). If pressure did not contribute equally to spacetime curvature as does mass–energy, the moon would not be in the orbit predicted by classical mechanics. They used their measurements to tighten the limits on any discrepancies between active and passive mass to about 10−12. With decades of additional lunar laser ranging data, Singh et al. (2023) reported improvement on these limits by a factor of about 100.

=== Gravitomagnetism ===
The existence of gravitomagnetism was proven by Gravity Probe B , a satellite-based mission which launched on 20 April 2004. The spaceflight phase lasted until &lt;time&gt;2005&lt;/time&gt;. The mission aim was to measure spacetime curvature near Earth, with particular emphasis on gravitomagnetism.

Initial results confirmed the relatively large geodetic effect (which is due to simple spacetime curvature, and is also known as de Sitter precession) to an accuracy of about 1%. The much smaller frame-dragging effect (which is due to gravitomagnetism, and is also known as Lense–Thirring precession) was difficult to measure because of unexpected charge effects causing variable drift in the gyroscopes. Nevertheless, by &lt;time datetime=&quot;2008-08&quot;&gt;August 2008&lt;/time&gt;, the frame-dragging effect had been confirmed to within 15% of the expected result, while the geodetic effect was confirmed to better than 0.5%.

Subsequent measurements of frame dragging by laser-ranging observations of the LARES, and satellites has improved on the measurement, with results (as of 2016) demonstrating the effect to within 5% of its theoretical value, although there has been some disagreement on the accuracy of this result.

Another effort, the Gyroscopes in General Relativity (GINGER) experiment, seeks to use three 6 m ring lasers mounted at right angles to each other 1400 m below the Earth&#x27;s surface to measure this effect. The first ten years of experience with a prototype ring laser gyroscope array, GINGERINO, established that the full scale experiment should be able to measure gravitomagnetism due to the Earth&#x27;s rotation to within a 0.1% level or even better.

<text>Neville John &quot;Noddy&quot; Holder (born 15 June 1946) is an English musician, songwriter and actor. He was the lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist of the English rock band Slade, one of the UK&#x27;s most successful acts of the 1970s. 

Known for his unique and powerful voice, Holder co-wrote most of Slade&#x27;s material with bass guitarist Jim Lea including &quot;Mama Weer All Crazee Now&quot;, &quot;Cum On Feel the Noize&quot; and &quot;Merry Xmas Everybody&quot;. After leaving Slade in 1992, he diversified into television and radio work, notably starring in the ITV comedy-drama series &quot;The Grimleys&quot; (1999–2001).

==Early life and career==
Neville John Holder was born on 15 June 1946 in the Caldmore area, near the centre of Walsall, Staffordshire, England. When he was seven he moved with his family to the Beechdale Estate, a council estate in the north of the town which was also home to Rob Halford, later of Judas Priest. The son of a window cleaner, in 1957 Holder passed the eleven plus exam and attended a grammar school for a year until it closed. He then attended the new T. P. Riley Comprehensive School and passed six GCE O-level exams. He acquired his nickname at infants&#x27; school for his habit of nodding to teachers instead of saying &quot;yes&quot;.

He formed a group called the Rockin&#x27; Phantoms with school friends at the age of 13, and with money earned from a part-time job, he bought a guitar and an amplifier. He also used his father&#x27;s window-cleaning van to drive Robert Plant to gigs with Plant&#x27;s band at the time, the Tennessee Teens (he would later go on to co-found Led Zeppelin). Holder started his own band called the Memphis Cutouts and then, with Steve Brett &amp; The Mavericks in the early &#x27;60s, recorded four singles for EMI&#x27;s Columbia label.

==Slade==
In 1966, drummer Don Powell persuaded Holder to join The N&#x27; Betweens, a group which already included guitarist Dave Hill and bass guitarist/ keyboard player/violinist/songwriter Jim Lea. Together they formed the band Ambrose Slade, eventually to become Slade, one of Britain&#x27;s top-selling rock bands. Lea and Holder turned out to be the group&#x27;s most successful song-writing partnership, composing almost all of the band&#x27;s songs. The band clocked up 21 hit singles and released 15 albums with their original line-up.

Slade are particularly remembered for &quot;Merry Xmas Everybody&quot;, written by Holder and Lea. Holder recorded the single with Slade in 1973, and the song became the band&#x27;s sixth number one and the third Slade single to go straight in at number one in the UK Singles Chart. &quot;Merry Xmas Everybody&quot; has seen 1.32 million copies being sold in the UK alone.

After 26 years with Slade, Holder left in 1992, to pursue a career away from music, with regular stints as radio presenter, television personality, actor and voice-over artist.

==Other work==
In 1980, after the death of Bon Scott, Holder was offered the chance to join AC/DC but declined because, as he put it; &quot;my loyalty was to Slade&quot;.

During 1982, Holder branched into production and worked with his old school friend Phil Burnell and his band Three Phase on one single &quot;All I Want To Do Is (Fall in Love With You)&quot;, which was the band&#x27;s only release. Holder and Burnell produced the single together, and it was published under Noddy Holder Music Ltd./Whild John Music Ltd., and released via Speed Records. The single did not enter the UK chart, as it received limited promotion.

During late 1983, Holder did some production work with the American band the First, who came over to the UK from Boston, Massachusetts, in America, especially to work with him, although there was never any release of material. In late 1983, both Holder and Lea produced Girlschool&#x27;s cover of the T-Rex song &quot;20th Century Boy&quot; and then the parent album &quot;Play Dirty&quot; which featured two Slade tracks, &quot;Burning in the Heat of Love&quot; and &quot;High and Dry&quot;. The &quot;High and Dry&quot; track was originally written for Girlschool but still appeared on Slade&#x27;s album that same year. In 1985, Holder co-wrote, and sang backing vocals on, the single &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; which Lea released under his own name.

In 1988, Holder recorded &quot;Tear into the Weekend&quot; for a Pepsi commercial in Canada. In 1989, Holder provided vocals to help out Dave Hill and his newly formed group Blessings in Disguise which also featured ex-Wizzard keyboard player Bill Hunt, Craig Fenney and Bob Lamb. The debut single, released in 1989 for the Christmas market, was a cover of the Everly Brothers&#x27; &quot;Crying in the Rain&quot;, backed by a Hill/Hunt composition, &quot;Wild Nights&quot;. The band also recorded a cover of the Elvis Presley song &quot;A Fool Such As I&quot; which was not released. The follow-up and final Blessings in Disguise single, &quot;Chance to Be&quot;, did not feature Holder.

Holder also appeared on the television panel game &quot;Pop Quiz&quot;, hosted by Mike Read.

==Career since Slade==

Since his departure from Slade in 1992, Holder has appeared on hundreds of TV shows, most notably the ITV comedy/drama series &quot;The Grimleys&quot; (1999–2001) as classical music teacher Neville Holder. For the series, Holder recorded acoustic versions of the Slade songs &quot;Coz I Luv You&quot;, &quot;Cum on Feel the Noize&quot;, &quot;Mama Weer All Crazee Now&quot; and &quot;Everyday&quot;.

He had his own radio shows on Piccadilly 1152 and Key 103 in Manchester, which were syndicated around the country throughout the 1990s, then on Century and Capital Radio syndication from 2000 to 2004.

In 1996, Holder was the subject of the &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; TV show. He also presented 31 episodes of &quot;Noddy&#x27;s Electric Ladyland&quot;, a surreal television quiz show. He was a team captain in BBC1&#x27;s music series &quot;A Question of Pop&quot; and was immortalised as a puppet character &quot;Banger&quot; on the TV show &quot;Bob the Builder&quot;. In 1999, Holder&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Who&#x27;s Crazee Now?&quot;, was published by Ebury. Updated in paperback in 2001 it is still available online. It was written by Holder with Lisa Verrico.

Holder was awarded the MBE in the 2000 honours list for his services to showbusiness. In 2001, he was awarded the Gold Badge of Merit by the British Academy of Composers and Songwriters. On 8 December 2000, Holder made a cameo appearance on a live episode of Granada Television&#x27;s &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, marking the soap&#x27;s 40th anniversary. He played a character called Stan, who was saving the street&#x27;s cobbles from being replaced. Holder voiced the lift announcements at the Walsall New Art Gallery. In November 2004, he made a guest appearance in Peter Kay&#x27;s &quot;Max and Paddy&#x27;s Road to Nowhere&quot;, in which he played a garage mechanic called Mick Bustin. The scenes were filmed in Bolton. 

Also for the past 25 years Holder has voiced, sung and appeared in many adverts for TV, film and radio worldwide. In 2006, Holder made a guest appearance in a music video for the Misty&#x27;s Big Adventure single, &quot;Fashion Parade&quot;. Holder was a regular TV critic and contributor to &quot;The Radcliffe and Maconie Show&quot; on BBC Radio 2 for eight years, and the three often talked about rock star gossip from all eras. Radcliffe often refers to Holder as &#x27;Sir Nodward of Holdershire&#x27;.

To celebrate his 50th year in showbiz, Holder toured the UK during May 2013 with Mark Radcliffe for a series of intimate &#x27;In conversation with&#x27; shows. Venues for the spring part of the tour include Bolton, Leeds, Durham, Telford, Preston, Redditch, Buxton and Harrogate. During the shows Holder performed some acoustic numbers.

Holder was the third celebrity to be inducted onto the Birmingham Walk of Stars. 27,000 people turned out to his induction ceremony, which took place on 9 December 2007 at Birmingham&#x27;s 2007 Canal Boat Light Parade. Since Christmas 2007, Holder has annually recorded a TV show countdown of hit Christmas tunes. He is the Nobby&#x27;s Nuts mascot following on from a TV campaign. Holder also made an appearance on the 2008 Xmas edition of BBC&#x27;s humorous news quiz show, &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot; as a member of Paul Merton&#x27;s team. In January 2010, Holder and his wife appeared on &quot;All Star Mr &amp; Mrs&quot; on ITV, where they won the £30,000 jackpot for the NSPCC charity. In 2011, Holder as &#x27;King of the Sizzle&#x27; fronted British Sausage Week, touring the country to find the Best British Bangers and to promote support for British farmers and butchers. Holder featured as &quot;Geoff&#x27;s Dad&quot; in the BBC Radio 4 comedy &quot;Hobby Bobbies&quot;. Series 1 was broadcast July/August 2013 and Series 2 November/December 2014.

On 24 June 2014, Holder was awarded the freedom of his home town of Walsall, making him an honorary freeman of the borough. On 25 September 2014, Holder released his second book via Constable, titled &quot;The World According to Noddy&quot;. In December 2015, he appeared as a presenter on BBC television&#x27;s &quot;Songs of Praise&quot;. On Christmas Day 2015 Holder appeared in a cameo role in BBC television&#x27;s &quot;Mrs Brown&#x27;s Boys&quot;. In 2018, Holder appeared as a panellist on the Christmas special of BBC television&#x27;s &quot;Would I Lie to You?&quot;

A life size statue of Holder, made of Lego, is displayed in Birmingham every Christmas as a charity focal point, with all proceeds going to Birmingham Children&#x27;s Cancer Hospital. In November 2022, Holder was featured shouting the slogan &quot;It&#x27;s Christmas&quot; from Slade&#x27;s &quot;Merry Xmas Everybody&quot; song, in high street retailer Iceland&#x27;s Christmas television advertising for their range of party foods, with a voice-over by actor Brian Blessed. The campaign followed a series of teasers posted on Iceland’s official social media channels and website featuring Holder with the hashtag #NotYetNoddy.

To mark his 60th professional year in showbiz, Noddy returned to the stage in 2023. He completed a series of sold out shows with the Tom Seals Band, a young ten-piece boogie jazz ensemble.

==Personal life==
Holder married dress designer Leandra Russell in 1976. They had two daughters and divorced in 1984. In 2004, Holder married television producer Suzan Price, with whom he has a son, Django (named after Django Reinhardt). Today, Holder lives in Prestbury, Cheshire.

In 2018, Holder was diagnosed with oesophageal cancer and was expected to live another six months. He underwent experimental chemotherapy treatment at the Christie Hospital in Manchester to which he &quot;responded well&quot;. His battle with cancer was made public in 2023 by his wife Suzan in her monthly column for &quot;Cheshire Life&quot; magazine. She stated that the &quot;experts never like to use the word &#x27;cure&#x27;, but five years later and he&#x27;s feeling good and looking great&quot;. Holder told &quot;The Big Issue&quot; that he kept his condition private, except to family and close friends, as he did not want people to &quot;think of me as a cancer victim&quot;.

==Railway views==
In December 2021, Holder criticised the high-speed railway line High Speed 2 and claimed that more trains should be added to the West Coast Main Line and update the West to East coast lines instead. The northern extensions have since been cancelled.

<doc id="1016431" wikidata="Q5267014" url="?curid=1016431" title="Device Forts">
<text>The Device Forts, also known as Henrician castles and blockhouses, were a series of artillery fortifications built to defend the coast of England and Wales by Henry VIII. Traditionally, the Crown had left coastal defences in the hands of local lords and communities but the threat of French and Spanish invasion led the King to issue an order, called a &quot;device&quot;, for a major programme of work between 1539 and 1547. The fortifications ranged from large stone castles positioned to protect the Downs anchorage in Kent, to small blockhouses overlooking the entrance to Milford Haven in Pembrokeshire, and earthwork bulwarks along the Essex coast. Some forts operated independently, others were designed to be mutually reinforcing. The Device programme was hugely expensive, costing a total of £376,000 (estimated as between £2 and £82 billion in today&#x27;s money); much of this was raised from the proceeds of the Dissolution of the Monasteries a few years before.

These utilitarian fortifications were armed with artillery, intended to be used against enemy ships before they could land forces or attack ships lying in harbour. The first wave of work between 1539 and 1543 was characterised by the use of circular bastions and multi-tiered defences, combined with many traditional medieval features. These designs contained serious military flaws, however, and the second period of construction until 1547 saw the introduction of angular bastions and other innovations probably inspired by contemporary thinking in mainland Europe. The castles were commanded by captains appointed by the Crown, overseeing small garrisons of professional gunners and soldiers, who would be supplemented by the local militia in an emergency.

Despite a French raid against the Isle of Wight in 1545, the Device Forts saw almost no action before peace was declared in 1546. Some of the defences were left to deteriorate and were decommissioned only a few years after their construction. After war broke out with Spain in 1569, Elizabeth I improved many of the remaining fortifications, including during the attack of the Spanish Armada of 1588. By the end of the century, the defences were badly out of date and for the first few decades of the 17th century many of the forts were left to decay. Most of the fortifications saw service in the First and Second English Civil Wars during the 1640s and were garrisoned during the Interregnum, continuing to form the backbone of England&#x27;s coastal defences against the Dutch after Charles II was restored to the throne in 1660. Again left to fall in ruin during the 18th century, many of the Device Forts were modernised and rearmed during the Napoleonic Wars, until peace was declared in 1815.

Fears over a possible French invasion resurfaced several times in the 19th century, combined with rapid changes in technology, such as the development of steamships and shell guns in the 1840s, rifled cannon and iron-clad warships in the 1850s, and torpedo boats in the 1880s. This spurred fresh investment in those Device Forts still thought to be militarily valuable, and encouraged the decommissioning of others. By 1900, however, developments in guns and armour had made most of the Device Forts that remained in service simply too small to be practical in modern coastal defence. Despite being brought back into use during the First and Second World Wars, by the 1950s the fortifications were finally considered redundant and decommissioned for good. Coastal erosion over the centuries had taken its toll and some sites had been extensively damaged or completely destroyed. Many were restored, however, and opened to the public as tourist attractions.
== Early history and design ==

=== Device programme ===

==== Background ====

The Device Forts emerged as a result of changes in English military architecture and foreign policy in the early 16th century. During the late medieval period, the English use of castles as military fortifications had declined in importance. The introduction of gunpowder in warfare had initially favoured the defender, but soon traditional stone walls could easily be destroyed by early artillery. The few new castles that were built during this time still incorporated the older features of gatehouses and crenellated walls, but intended them more as martial symbols than as practical military defences. Many older castles were simply abandoned or left to fall in disrepair.

Although fortifications could still be valuable in times of war, they had played only a limited role during the Wars of the Roses and, when Henry VII invaded and seized the throne in 1485, he had not needed to besiege any castles or towns during the campaign. Henry rapidly consolidated his rule at home and had few reasons to fear an external invasion from the continent; he invested little in coastal defences over the course of his reign. Modest fortifications existed along the coasts, based around simple blockhouses and towers, primarily in the south-west and along the Sussex coast, with a few more impressive works in the north of England, but they were very limited in scale.

His son, Henry VIII inherited the throne in 1509 and took a more interventionist approach in European affairs, fighting one war with France between 1512 and 1514, and then another between 1522 and 1525, this time allying himself with Spain and the Holy Roman Empire. While France and the Empire were in conflict with one another, raids along the English coast might still be common, but a full-scale invasion seemed unlikely. Indeed, traditionally the Crown had left coastal defences to local lords and communities, only taking a modest role in building and maintaining fortifications. Initially, therefore, Henry took little interest in his coastal defences; he declared reviews of the fortifications in both 1513 and 1533, but not much investment took place as a result.

In 1533 Henry broke with Pope Clement VII in order to annul the long-standing marriage to his wife, Catherine of Aragon, and remarry. Catherine was the aunt of King Charles V of Spain, who took the annulment as a personal insult. As a consequence, France and the Empire declared an alliance against Henry in 1538, and the Pope encouraged the two countries to attack England. An invasion of England now appeared certain; that summer Henry made a personal inspection of some of his coastal defences, which had recently been mapped and surveyed: he appeared determined to make substantial, urgent improvements.

==== Initial phase, 1539–1543 ====

Henry VIII gave instructions through Parliament in 1539 that new defences were to be built along the coasts of England, beginning a major programme of work that would continue until 1547. The order was known as a &quot;device&quot;, which meant a documented plan, instruction or schema, leading to the fortifications later becoming known as the &quot;Device Forts&quot;. The initial instructions for the &quot;defence of the realm in time of invasion&quot; concerned building forts along the southern coastline of England, as well as making improvements to the defences of the towns of Calais and Guisnes in France, then controlled by Henry&#x27;s forces. Commissioners were also to be sent out across south-west and south-east England to inspect the current defences and to propose sites for new ones.

The initial result was the construction of 30 new fortifications of various sizes during 1539. The stone castles of Deal, Sandown and Walmer were constructed to protect the Downs in east Kent, an anchorage which gave access to Deal Beach and on which an invasion force of enemy soldiers could easily be landed. These defences, known as the castles of the Downs, were supported by a line of four earthwork forts, known as the Great Turf Bulwark, the Little Turf Bulwark, the Great White Bulwark of Clay and the Walmer Bulwark, and a long defensive ditch and bank. The route inland through a gap in the Kentish cliffs was guarded by Sandgate Castle. In many cases temporary bulwarks for artillery batteries were built in during the initial stages of the work, ahead of the main stonework being completed.

The Thames estuary leading out of London, through which 80 percent of England&#x27;s exports passed, was protected with a mutually reinforcing network of blockhouses at Gravesend, Milton, and Higham on the south side of the river, and West Tilbury and East Tilbury on the opposite bank. Camber Castle was built to protect the anchorage outside the ports of Rye and Winchelsea, defences were built in the port of Harwich and three earth bulwarks were built around Dover. Work was also begun on Calshot Castle in Fawley and the blockhouses of East and West Cowes on the Isle of Wight to protect the Solent, which led into the trading port of Southampton. The Portland Roads anchorage in Dorset was protected with new castles at Portland and Sandsfoot, and work began on two blockhouses to protect the Milford Haven Waterway in Pembrokeshire.

In 1540 additional work was ordered to defend Cornwall. Carrick Roads was an important anchorage at the mouth of the River Fal and the original plans involved constructing five new fortifications to protect it, although only two castles, Pendennis and St Mawes, were actually built, on opposite sides of the estuary. Work began on further fortifications to protect the Solent in 1541, with the construction of Hurst Castle, overlooking the Needles Passage, and Netley Castle just outside Southampton itself. Following a royal visit to the north of England, the coastal fortifications around the town of Hull were upgraded in 1542 with a castle and two large blockhouses. Further work was carried out in Essex in 1543, with a total of seven fortifications constructed, three in Harwich itself, three protecting the estuary leading to the town, and two protecting the estuary linking into Colchester. St Andrew&#x27;s Castle was begun to further protect the Solent.

The work was undertaken rapidly, and 24 sites were completed and garrisoned by the end of 1540, with almost all of the rest finished by the end of 1543. By the time they were completed, however, the alliance between Charles and Francis had collapsed and the threat of imminent invasion was over.

==== Second phase, 1544–1547 ====

Henry moved back onto the offensive in Europe in 1543, allying himself with Spain against France once again. Despite Henry&#x27;s initial successes around Boulogne in northern France, King Charles and Francis made peace in 1544, leaving England exposed to an invasion by France, backed by her allies in Scotland. In response Henry issued another device in 1544 to improve the country&#x27;s defences, particularly along the south coast. Work began on Southsea Castle in 1544 on Portsea Island to further protect the Solent, and on Sandown Castle the following year on the neighbouring Isle of Wight. Brownsea Castle in Dorset was begun in 1545, and Sharpenrode Bulwark was built opposite Hurst Castle from 1545 onwards.

The French invasion emerged in 1545, when Admiral Claude d&#x27;Annebault crossed the Channel and arrived off the Solent with 200 ships on 19 July. Henry&#x27;s fleet made a brief sortie, before retreating safely behind the protective fortifications. Annebault landed a force near Newhaven, during which Camber Castle may have fired on the French fleet, and on 23 July they landed four detachments on the Isle of Wight, including a party that took the site of Sandown Castle, which was still under construction. The French expedition moved further on along the coast on 25 July, bringing an end to the immediate invasion threat. Meanwhile, on 22 July the French had carried out a raid at Seaford, and Camber Castle may have seen action against the French fleet. A peace treaty was agreed in June 1546, bringing an end to the war. By the time that Henry died the following year, in total the huge sum of £376,000 had been spent on the Device projects.

=== Architects and engineers ===

Some of the Device Forts were designed and built by teams of English engineers. The master mason John Rogers was brought back from his work in France and worked on the Hull defences, while Sir Richard Lee, another of the King&#x27;s engineers from his French campaigns, may have been involved in the construction of Sandown and Southsea; the pair were paid the substantial sums of £30 and £36 a year respectively. Sir Richard Morris, the Master of Ordnance, and James Nedeham, the Surveyor of the King&#x27;s Works, led on the defences along the Thames. The efforts of the Hampton Court Palace architectural team, under the leadership of the Augustinian canon, Richard Benese, contributed to the high-quality construction and detailing seen in many of Henry&#x27;s Device projects.

Henry himself took a close interest in the design of the fortifications, sometimes overruling his technical advisers on particular details. Southsea Castle, for example, was described by the courtier Sir Edmund Knyvet as being &quot;of his Majesty&#x27;s own device&quot;, which typically indicated that the King had taken a personal role in its design. The historian Andrew Saunders suspects that Henry was &quot;probably the leading and unifying influence behind the fortifications&quot;.

England also had a tradition of drawing on expert foreign engineers for military engineering; Italians were particularly sought after, as their home country was felt to be generally more technically advanced, particularly in the field of fortifications. One of these foreign engineers, Stefan von Haschenperg from Moravia, worked on Camber, Pendennis, Sandgate and St Mawes, apparently attempting to reproduce Italian designs, although his lack of personal knowledge of such fortifications impacted poorly on the end results. Technical treatises from mainland Europe also influenced the designers of the Device Forts, including Albrecht Dürer&#x27;s which described contemporary methods of fortification in Germany, published in 1527 and translated into Latin in 1535, and Niccolò Machiavelli&#x27;s , published in 1521, which also described new Italian forms of military defences.

=== Architecture ===

The Device Forts represented a major, radical programme of work; the historian Marcus Merriman describes it as &quot;one of the largest construction programmes in Britain since the Romans&quot;, Brian St John O&#x27;Neil as the only &quot;scheme of comprehensive coastal defence ever attempted in England before modern times&quot;, while Cathcart King likened it to the Edwardian castle building programme in North Wales.

Although some of the fortifications are titled as castles, historians typically distinguish between the character of the Device Forts and those of the earlier medieval castles. Medieval castles were private dwellings as well as defensive sites, and usually played a role in managing local estates; Henry&#x27;s forts were organs of the state, placed in key military locations, typically divorced from the surrounding patterns of land ownership or settlements. Unlike earlier medieval castles, they were spartan, utilitarian constructions. Some historians such as King have disagreed with this interpretation, highlighting the similarities between the two periods, with the historian Christopher Duffy terming the Device Forts the &quot;reinforced-castle fortification&quot;.

The forts were positioned to defend harbours and anchorages, and designed both to focus artillery fire on enemy ships, and to protect the gunnery teams from attack by those vessels. Some, including the major castles, including the castles of the Downs in Kent, were intended to be self-contained and able to defend themselves against attack from the land, while the smaller blockhouses were primarily focused on the maritime threat. Although there were extensive variations between the individual designs, they had common features and were often built in a consistent style.

The larger sites, such as Deal or Camber, were typically squat, with low parapets and massively thick walls to protect against incoming fire. They usually had a central keep, echoing earlier medieval designs, with curved, concentric bastions spreading out from the centre. The main guns were positioned over multiple tiers to enable them to engage targets at different ranges. There were far more gunports than there were guns held by the individual fortification. The bastion walls were pierced with splayed gun embrasures, giving the artillery space to traverse and enabling easy fire control, with overlapping angles of fire. The interiors had sufficient space for gunnery operations, with specially designed vents to remove the black powder smoke generated by the guns. Moats often surrounded the sites, to protect against any attack from land, and they were further protected by what the historian Beric Morley describes as the &quot;defensive paraphernalia developed in the Middle Ages&quot;: portcullises, murder holes and reinforced doors. The smaller blockhouses took various forms, including D-shapes, octagonal and square designs. The Thames blockhouses were typically protected on either side by additional earthworks and guns.

These new fortifications were the most advanced in England at the time, an improvement over earlier medieval designs, and were effective in terms of concentrating firepower on enemy ships. They contained numerous flaws, however, and were primitive in comparison to their counterparts in mainland Europe. The multiple tiers of guns gave the forts a relatively high profile, exposing them to enemy attack, and the curved surfaces of the hollow bastions were vulnerable to artillery. The concentric bastion design prevented overlapping fields of fire in the event of an attack from the land, and the tiers of guns meant that, as an enemy approached, the number of guns the fort could bring to bear diminished.

Some of these issues were addressed during the second Device programme from 1544 onwards. Italian ideas began to be brought in, although the impact of Henry&#x27;s foreign engineers seems to have been limited, and the designs themselves lagged behind those used in his French territories. The emerging continental approach used angled, &quot;arrow-head&quot; bastions, linked in a line called a , to provide supporting fire against any attacker. Sandown Castle on the Isle of Wight, constructed in 1545, was a hybrid of traditional English and continental ideas, with angular bastions combined with a circular bastion overlooking the sea. Southsea Castle and Sharpenode Fort had similar, angular bastions. Yarmouth Castle, finished by 1547, was the first fortification in England to adopt the new arrow-headed bastion design, which had further advantages over a simple angular bastion. Not all the forts in the second wave of work embraced the Italian approach however, and some, such as Brownsea Castle, retained the existing, updated architectural style.

=== Logistics ===

The costs of building the fortifications varied with their size. A small blockhouse cost around £500 to build, whereas a medium-sized castle, such as Sandgate, Pendennis or Portland, would come to approximately £5,000. The defensive line of Deal, Sandown and Walmer castles cost a total £27,092, while the work at Hull Castle and its two blockhouses came to £21,056. Various officials were appointed to run each of the projects, including a paymaster, a comptroller, an overseer and commissioners from the local gentry. A few fortifications were built by local individuals and families; St Catherine&#x27;s Castle, for example, was reportedly paid for by the town and local gentry, and the Edgcumbe family built Devil&#x27;s Point Artillery Tower to protect Plymouth Harbour.

Much of the expenditure was on the construction teams, called &quot;crews&quot;, who built the forts. The numbers of workers varied during the course of the project, driven in part by seasonal variation, but the teams were substantial: Sandgate Castle, for example, saw an average of 640 men on the site daily during June 1540, and the work at Hull required a team of 420. A skilled worker was paid between 7 and 8 pence a day, a labourer between 5 and 6 pence, with trades including stonemasons, carpenters, carters, lime burners, sawyers, plumbers, scavelmen, dikers and bricklayers. Finding enough workers proved difficult, and in some cases men had to be pressed into service unwillingly. Labour disputes broke out, with strikes over low pay at Deal in 1539 and at Guisnes in 1541; both were quickly suppressed by royal officials.

Large amounts of raw materials were also needed for the work, including stone, timber and lead and many other supplies. Camber, for example, probably required over 500,000 bricks, Sandgate needed 44,000 tiles, while constructing a small blockhouse along the Thames was estimated by contemporaries to require of chalk just to enable the manufacture of the lime mortar. Some materials could be sourced locally, but coal was shipped from the north of England and prefabricated items were brought in from London.

Most of the money for the first phase of Device works came from Henry&#x27;s dissolution of the monasteries a few years before, and the revenues that flowed in from the Court of Augmentations and First Fruits and Tenths as a result. In addition, the dissolution had released ample supplies of building materials as the monastic buildings were pulled down, and much of this was recycled. Netley Castle, for example, was based on an old abbey and reused many of its stones, East Tilbury Blockhouse reused parts of St Margaret&#x27;s Chantry, Calshot Castle took the lead from nearby Beaulieu Abbey, East and West Cowes castles stone from Beaulieu and Quarr, and Sandwich had the stone from the local Carmelite friary. Milton Blockhouse was constructed on land that had recently been confiscated from Milton Chantry. By the second phase of the programme, however, most of the money from the dissolution had been spent, and Henry instead had to borrow funds; government officials noted that at least £100,000 was needed for the work.

=== Garrisons ===

The garrisons of the Device Forts comprised relatively small teams of men who typically lived and worked in the fortifications. The garrisons would maintain and care for the buildings and their artillery during the long periods of peacetime and, in a crisis, would be supplemented by additional soldiers and the local militia. The size of the garrisons varied according to the fortification; Camber Castle had a garrison of 29, Walmer Castle 18, while the West Tilbury Blockhouse only held 9 men. The ordinary soldiers would have lived in relatively basic conditions, typically on the ground floor, with the captains of the fortifications occupying more elaborate quarters, often in the upper levels of the keeps. The soldiers ate meat and fish, some of which might have been hunted or caught by the garrison.

The garrisons were well organised, and a strict code of discipline was issued in 1539; the historian Peter Harrington suggests that life in the forts would have usually been &quot;tedious&quot; and &quot;isolated&quot;. Soldiers were expected to provide handguns at their own expense, and could be fined if they failed to produce them. There were only around 200 gunners across England during the 1540s; they were important military specialists, and the historians Audrey Howes and Martin Foreman observe that &quot;an air of mystery and danger&quot; surrounded them.

The rates of pay across the defences were recorded in 1540, showing that the typical pay of the garrisons was 1 or 2 shillings a day for a captain; his deputy, 8 pence; porters, 8 pence; with soldiers and gunners receiving 6 pence each. In total, 2,220 men were recorded as receiving pay that year, at a cost to the Crown of £2,208. Although most garrisons were paid for by the Crown, in some cases the local community also had a role; at Brownsea, the local town was responsible for providing a garrison of 6 men, and at Sandsfoot the village took up the responsibility for supporting the castle garrison, in exchange for an exemption from paying taxes and carrying out militia service.

=== Armament ===
The artillery guns in the Device forts were the property of the Crown and were centrally managed by the authorities in the Tower of London. The Tower moved them between the various fortifications as they felt necessary, often resulting in complaints from the local captains. Various surviving records record the armaments held by individual forts on particular dates, and between 1547 and 1548 a complete inventory was made of the Crown&#x27;s possessions, detailing the weapons held by all of the forts. The number of guns varied considerably from site to site; in the late 1540s, heavily armed forts such as Hurst and Calshot held 26 and 36 guns respectively; Portland, however, had only 11 pieces. Some forts had more guns than the level of their regular, peacetime garrison; for example, despite only having an establishment of 13 men, Milton Blockhouse had 30 artillery pieces.

A variety of artillery guns were deployed, including heavier weapons, such as cannons, culverins and demi-cannons, and smaller pieces such as sakers, minions and falcons. Some older guns, for example slings and bases, were also deployed, but were less effective than newer weapons such as the culverin. With sites equipped with several tiers of weapons, the heaviest guns would typically be placed higher up in the fortification, with the smaller weapons closer to the ground. It is uncertain how far the guns of the period would have reached; analysis carried out in the 16th and 17th century on the ranges of artillery suggested that the largest weapons, such as a culverin, could hit a target up to between away.

The forts were typically equipped with a mixture of brass and iron artillery guns. Guns made of brass could fire more quickly—up to eight times an hour—and were safer to use than their iron equivalents, but were expensive and required imported copper (tin could be sourced from Cornwall and Devon). In the 1530s Henry had established a new English gun-making industry in the Weald of Kent and London, staffed by specialists from mainland Europe. This could make cast-iron weapons, but probably initially lacked the capacity to supply all of the artillery required for the Device forts, particularly since Henry also required more guns for his new navy. A technical breakthrough in 1543, however, led to the introduction of vertical casting and a massive increase in Henry&#x27;s ability to manufacture iron cannons. Few guns from this period have survived, but during excavations in 1997 an iron portpiece was discovered on the site of the South Blockhouse in Kingston on Hull. The weapon, now known as &quot;Henry&#x27;s Gun&quot;, is one of only four such guns in the world to have survived and is displayed at the Hull and East Riding Museum.

In addition to artillery, the Device Forts were equipped with infantry weapons. Handguns, typically an early form of matchlock arquebus, would have been used for close defence; these were long and supported on tripods. Many forts also held supplies of bows, arrows and polearms, such as bills, pikes and halberds. Longbows were still in military use among English armies in the 1540s, although they later declined quickly in popularity, and these, along with the polearms, would have been used by the local militia when they were called out in a crisis.

== Later history ==

=== 16th century ===

After Henry&#x27;s death there was a pause in the conflict with France, during which many of the new fortifications were allowed to deteriorate. There was little money available for repairs and the garrisons were reduced in size. East Cowes was abandoned around 1547 and fell into ruin, while the bulwarks along the Downs were defaced and their guns removed; they were formally removed from service in 1550. In 1552 the Essex fortifications were decommissioned, and several were subsequently pulled down. The expense of maintaining the fortifications in Hull led the Crown to agree a deal with the town authorities to take over management of them. Milton and Higham were demolished between 1557 and 1558. Mersea Fort was temporarily decommissioned, before being brought back into active service.

The strategic importance of south-east England declined after peace was declared with France in 1558. Military attention instead shifted towards the Spanish threat to the increasingly prosperous south-west of the country; tensions grew and war finally broke out in 1569. The new threat led to improvements being made to Pendennis and St Mawes castles in Cornwall, and repairs to Calshot, Camber and Portland along the south coast. In 1588 the Spanish armada sailed for England and the Device Forts were mobilised in response. As part of this work, West Tilbury was brought back into service and supported by a hastily raised army, which was visited by Queen Elizabeth I, and further enlargement followed under the direction of the Italian engineer, Federigo Giambelli. Gravesend was improved and several of the Essex fortifications were temporarily brought back into use; there were discussions about enhancing the defences at Hull and Milford Haven, but no work was actually carried out.

Despite the destruction of the Armada, the Spanish threat continued; the castles in Kent were kept ready for action throughout the rest of Elizabeth&#x27;s reign. In 1596 a Spanish invasion fleet reportedly carrying 20,000 soldiers set out for Pendennis, which was then garrisoned with only 500 men. The fleet was forced to turn back due to bad weather, but Elizabeth reviewed the defences and significantly expanded Henry&#x27;s original fortifications with more up-to-date bastions, designed by the engineer Paul Ive. By the end of the century, however, most of the Device Forts were typically out of date by European standards.

=== 17th century ===
James I came to the English throne in 1603, resulting peace with both France and Spain. His government took little interest in the coastal defences and many of the Device Forts were neglected and fell into disrepair, with their garrisons&#x27; wages left unpaid. Castles such as Deal and blockhouses like Gravesend were all assessed as needing extensive repairs, with Sandgate reported to be in such a poor condition that it was &quot;neither habitable or defensible against any assault, nor any way fit to command the roads&quot;. Lacking ammunition and powder, and with only a handful of its guns in adequate repair, Hurst was unable to prevent Flemish ships from passing along the Solent. Pendennis&#x27;s garrison&#x27;s pay was two years in arrears, reportedly forcing them to gather limpets from the shoreline for food. Some of the forts fell out of use; Camber Castle, whose original function of protecting the local anchorage had by now been made redundant by the changing shoreline, was decommissioned by King Charles I in 1637, while Sharpenrode Bulwark lay in ruins by the 1620s.

==== First English Civil War ====

Civil war broke out across England in 1642 between the supporters of King Charles I and Parliament. Fortifications and artillery played an important role in the conflict, and most of the Device Forts saw service. The south and east of England were soon largely controlled by Parliament. The blockhouses at Gravesend and Tilbury were garrisoned by Parliament and used to control access to London. The castles along the Sussex and Kentish coastline were seized by Parliament in the opening phase of the war, Camber Castle then being decommissioned to prevent it being used by the enemy, the remainder continuing to be garrisoned. The royal fleet, which had been positioned in the Downs anchorage, sided with Parliament.

The Device Forts along the Solent also fell into Parliamentary hands early in the conflict. Calshot was garrisoned throughout, as was Brownsea, which was strengthened and equipped with additional guns. West Cowes was rapidly taken after firing on a nearby Parliamentary ship, and the Royalist commander at Yarmouth quickly negotiated a surrender of his tiny garrison. The heavily outnumbered garrison at Southsea Castle was stormed by Parliamentary forces in a night attack. Like Camber, St Andrew&#x27;s and Netley were rapidly occupied and then decommissioned by Parliament. In the north-east, Hull also sided with Parliament, and its castle and blockhouses were used as part of the town&#x27;s defences during multiple sieges.

Much of the south-west sided with the King; Device Forts such as St Catherine&#x27;s were held by the Royalists from the beginning of the conflict. The Royalists invaded Parliamentary-controlled Dorset in 1643, taking Portland and Sandsfoot. The flow of the war turned against the King, and the Dorset forts were besieged in 1644 and 1645, with Sandsfoot falling to Parliament. By March 1646, Thomas Fairfax had entered Cornwall with a substantial army. The captain of the castle was invited to retreat to the stronger fortress of Pendennis, but he surrendered immediately without putting up resistance. Pendennis was bombarded from the land and blockaded by a flotilla of ships. The captain, Sir John Arundell, agreed to an honourable surrender on 15 August, and around 900 survivors left the fort, some terminally ill from malnutrition. Pendennis was the penultimate Royalist fortification to hold out in the war, followed by Portland Castle which finally surrendered in April 1646.

==== Second English Civil War ====

After a few years of unsteady peace, in 1648 the Second English Civil War broke out, this time with Charles&#x27; Royalist supporters joined by Scottish forces. The Parliamentary navy was based in the Downs, protected by the nearby Henrician castles, but by May a Royalist insurrection was underway across Kent. Sandown Castle declared for the King, and the soldier and former naval captain Major Keme then convinced the garrisons at Deal and Walmer to surrender. Sandgate Castle probably joined the Royalists as well. With both the coastal fortresses and the navy now under Royalist control, Parliament feared that foreign forces might be landed along the coast, or military aid sent to the Scots.

Essex also rose in rebellion in June and the town of Colchester was taken by the Royalists. Sir Thomas Fairfax placed it under siege, and Mersea Fort was taken by Parliamentary forces and used to cut off any assistance reaching the town by river. Meanwhile, Parliament defeated the Kentish insurgency at the Battle of Maidstone at the start of June and then sent a force under the command of Colonel Rich to deal with the castles of the Downs.

Walmer Castle was the first to be besieged and surrendered on 12 July. An earthwork fort was then built between Sandown and Deal, who each may have been defended by around 150 men each. Deal, which had been resupplied by the Royalists from the sea, was besieged in July. A Royalist fleet bombarded the Parliamentary positions and temporarily landed a force of 1,500 Flemish mercenaries in support of the revolt, but a shortage of money forced their return to the Continent. The fleet, under the command of Prince Charles, attempted to landed a fresh force in August, but despite three attempts the operation failed and suffered heavy losses. Deal surrendered on 25 August, followed by Sandown on 5 September.

==== Interregnum and the Restoration ====

Unlike many castles, the Device Forts avoided being slighted – deliberately damaged or destroyed – by Parliament during the years of the Interregnum. Many of the forts remained garrisoned with substantial numbers of men due to fears of a Royalist invasion, overseen by newly appointed governors; Netley was brought back into service due to the threat. Many were used to hold prisoners of war or political detainees, including Hull, Mersea, Portland, Southsea and West Cowes. During the First Anglo-Dutch War between 1652 and 1654, castles such as Deal were reinforced with earthworks and soldiers. Portland saw action during a three-day long naval battle between English and Dutch forces in the Portland Roads. Some sites fell out of use: Little Dennis Blockhouse – part of the complex of defences at Pendennis – and Mersea were decommissioned between 1654 and 1655, and Brownsea Castle was sold off into private hands.

Charles II was restored to the throne in 1660 and reduced both the size and the wages of the garrisons across the kingdom. The Device Forts initially remained at the heart of the defences along the south coast, but their design was by now badly antiquated. Deal continued to play an important role in defending the Downs during the Second and Third Dutch Wars, supported by local trained bands, and castles such as Hurst, Portland and Sandgate remained garrisoned. Others, however, were decommissioned with Sandsfoot closing in 1665 following a dispute over the control of the defences, and Netley being abandoned to fall into ruin.

Concerns about the Dutch threat were intensified after an unexpected naval raid along the Thames in 1667, during which Gravesend and Tilbury prevented the attack reaching the capital itself. In response, Charles made extensive improvements to his coastal defences. As part of this investments were made to Pendennis, Southsea and Yarmouth, while Tilbury was hugely expanded with an updated system of ramparts, bastions and moats at considerable cost. In the final phases of Charles&#x27;s work, the castle and southern blockhouse at Hull were incorporated into a massive new fortification called the Citadel during the 1680s.

Some of the Device Forts played a role in the Glorious Revolution of 1688 against Charles&#x27; brother, King James II. The townsfolk of Deal seized their local castle in support of William of Orange, and took steps to defend the Downs against a feared Irish invasion which never materialised. Southsea Castle was held by the King&#x27;s illegitimate son, James FitzJames, the Duke of Berwick, who was pressurised into surrendering as his father&#x27;s cause collapsed. Yarmouth was controlled by Robert Holmes, a supporter of James, but was prevented from actively supporting the loyalist cause by the local inhabitants and his garrison, who sided with William.

=== 18th–19th centuries ===

==== 1700–1791 ====

The military significance of the Device Forts declined during the 18th century. Some of the fortifications were redesigned to provide more comfortable housing for their occupants. Cowes Castle was partially rebuilt in 1716 to modernise its accommodation, demolishing much of the keep and adding residential wings and gardens over the landward defences, and Brownsea Castle began to be converted into a country house from the 1720s onwards. Walmer became the official residence of the Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, and Lionel Sackville, the Duke of Dorset, carried out extensive work there after 1708. There was probably some rivalry between Sackville and the naval officer Sir John Norris, who redeveloped nearby Deal Castle during the same period, creating comfortable wood-panelled quarters for himself there overlooking the sea.

Criticisms were levelled at the defences of the Device Forts, which often had minimal garrisons and had been left to fall into disrepair. Southsea Castle, for example, was only garrisoned by &quot;an old sergeant and three or four men who sell cakes and ale&quot; according to one contemporary account, and proposals were put forward to abandon the site altogether. Portland suffered badly from coastal erosion and, protected only by a caretaker garrison, was reportedly not repaired for many years, and a 1714 survey found the long-neglected Pendennis Castle to be &quot;in a very ruinous condition&quot;. The French military dismissed Deal, Walmer and Sandown as being highly vulnerable to any potential attack, describing them in 1767 as &quot;very old and little more than gun platforms&quot;. Mersea Fort and East Tilbury fell into ruin and were abandoned, the latter being submerged by the Thames. Some limited investments were made in the fortifications, however, with the defences of Pendennis Castle being modernised in the 1730s, and those of Calshot in the 1770s.

==== 1792–1849 ====

The Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars at the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries led to some of the castles being re-garrisoned and improved, as part of the development of a range of gun batteries around key locations. Some of the fortifications such as Sandgate, Southsea, Hurst and Pendennis, protected strategic locations and these were extensively modernised. Hurst, for example, was redesigned with batteries of heavier 36-pounder () weapons, and Pendennis was equipped with up to 48 guns. Sandgate&#x27;s keep was rebuilt to form a Martello tower as part of a wider programme of work along the south coast. New gun batteries were constructed at Deal, Sandown in Kent and Tilbury, while Fort Mersea was brought back into service complete with a new battery as well. Calshot Castle was renovated, and Southsea&#x27;s defences were extensively modernised, as were those in Hull, with the castle and the south blockhouse being refitted.

Some of the Device Forts worked in conjunction with the volunteer units raised during the wars to counter the threat of a French invasion. Walmer Castle was used by its captain William Pitt the Younger – then both prime minister and Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports – as the base for volunteer cavalry unit and a fleet of 35 armed fishing boats called luggers. Nearby Deal also had units of infantry and cavalry, called fencibles and in 1802 units of bombardiers recruited by Pitt carried out military exercises at the castle. Calshot was used to store munitions for nearby Sea Fencibles. Pendennis held a new volunteer artillery unit, which was used to train other garrisons across Cornwall.

The government coastguard used some of the fortifications as bases to combat smuggling. Calshot was a good location for interception vessels to lie in wait and, by the middle of the century, two officers and forty-two men were stationed there; Sandown Castle in Kent was also used by the coastguard for anti-smuggling operations. In the coming decades some forts were declared obsolete and put to new uses; Portland was disarmed after the war and converted into a private house. Gravesend was superseded by the New Tavern Fort and demolished in 1844. Meanwhile, the ruins of Netley Castle were transformed into a Gothic-styled house from 1826 onwards.

==== 1850–1899 ====

From the mid-19th century onwards, changes in military technology repeatedly challenged the value and composition of Britain&#x27;s coastal defences. The introduction of shell guns and steam ships created a new risk that the French might successfully attack along the south coast, and fears grew of a conflict in the early 1850s. Southsea Castle and St Mawes were extended with new gun batteries, Pendennis was re-equipped with heavier guns, and Hurst was extensively redeveloped. There were discussions about rearming Calshot, but these were rejected, in part due to concerns about the suitability of the 16th-century walls in modern warfare. The Crimean War sparked a fresh invasion scare and in 1855 the south coast of England was refortified. New guns were installed at St Catherine&#x27;s and Yarmouth in 1855. The remains of the West Blockhouse were destroyed by a new fortification, the West Blockhouse Fort, designed to deal with the French threat.

Fresh worries about France, combined with the development of rifled cannon and iron-clad warships, led to the Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom being established in 1859, and expressing fears about the security of the south coast. In response, Sandgate was re-equipped with heavier guns in 1859, and extensive work was carried out on Southsea. Hurst was fitted with two huge batteries of heavy rifled breech-loading guns, protected by iron armour plate, intended for use against fast-moving enemy warships. Tilbury Blockhouse was demolished to make way for heavier guns at the fort after 1868. Portland was readopted by the army as a garrison base in 1869 in response to fears of an invasion, but it was not rearmed.

A fresh wave of concerns about France followed in the 1880s, accompanied by the introduction of still more powerful naval artillery and fast warships and torpedo boats, resulting in a fresh wave of modernisation. An electronically operated minefield was laid across Carrick Roads in 1885, jointly controlled from St Mawes and Pendennis. New, quick-firing guns were installed at Hurst to enable the castle to engage the newer vessels. Calshot was brought back into service as a coastal fort, with a new battery of quick-firing guns protecting a boom across the estuary. The original 16th-century parts of fortifications such as Southsea and Calshot were too small and unsuitable for modern weapons, however, and were instead used for mounting searchlights, range and direction finding; in some cases their fabric was left to slowly decline.

Some other sites were no longer considered viable at all. West Cowes was decommissioned in 1854 and became the club house of the Royal Yacht Squadron. Sandown Castle in Kent, suffering badly from coastal erosion, began to be demolished from 1863 onwards; Hull Citadel and its 16th-century fortifications were demolished in 1864 to make way for docks; Yarmouth was decommissioned in 1885, becoming a coastguard signalling station; and Sandgate, also suffering from coastal erosion, was sold off to the South Eastern Railway company in 1888.

=== 20th–21st centuries ===

==== 1900–1945 ====

By the start of the 20th century, developments in guns and armour had made most of the Device Forts that remained in service too small to be useful. Modern weapons systems and their supporting logistics facilities such as munitions stores could not fit within the 16th-century designs. A 1905 review of the Falmouth defences concluded that the naval artillery at St Mawes had become superfluous, as the necessary guns could be mounted at a combination of Pendennis and newer sites along the coast, and the castle was disarmed. A review in 1913 concluded that keeping naval artillery at Calshot was also unnecessary, and the site was turned into an experimental seaplane station instead.

Meanwhile, concerns had been growing about the unsympathetic treatment of historic military buildings by the War Office; for its part, the War Office was concerned that it might find itself financially supporting these properties from its own budget. Yarmouth Castle was passed to the Commissioners of Woods and Forests in 1901, with parts of it being leased to the neighbouring hotel. The War Office concluded that Walmer and Deal had no remaining military value and agreed to transfer the castles to the Office of Works in 1904, who opened both former fortifications to visitors. Portland Castle was placed onto what was known as the Schedule C list, which meant that the Army would continue to use and manage the historic property, but would receive advice on the suitability of repairs from the Office of Works.

With the outbreak of the First World War, naval operations were mainly focused along the south-east and southern coasts. The defences of Pendennis were reinforced, while Southsea, with the addition of anti-Zeppelin guns, formed part of the Fortress Portsmouth plan for defending the Solent. Calshot formed a base for anti-submarine warfare, and the remaining castles of the Downs were used to support the activities of the Dover Patrol. St Mawes and Portland were used as barracks, and Walmer became a weekend retreat for the Prime Minister, Asquith, exploiting its good communication links with the front line in France.

During the Second World War, Britain&#x27;s coastal defences depended on extensive barriers constructed along the shores, combined with large numbers of small defensive artillery positions supported by air cover. Several of the Device Forts were brought back into service in this way. Pendennis, St Catherine&#x27;s, St Mawes and Walmer were equipped with naval gun batteries, Calshot and Hurst were rearmed with naval guns and anti-aircraft defences, and Sandsfoot was used as an anti-aircraft battery. Southsea continued in service, and was involved in Operation Grasp, which seized the French fleet in 1940. Others were used as support facilities; Yarmouth was requisitioned for military use; Portland was used for accommodation, offices and as an ordnance store, and West Cowes used as a naval headquarters for part of the D-Day landings. Camber was used as an early warning and decoy site to distract raids from nearby Rye. Early in the war a German bomber destroyed much of the captain&#x27;s quarters at Deal, forcing William Birdwood to move to Hampton Court Palace. The Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, was appointed as the captain of Walmer Castle during the war, but declined to use it as a residence, noting that it was too expensive for him to maintain, and that it lay within the range of German artillery.

==== 1946 – 21st century ====

After the war, coastal defences became increasingly irrelevant as nuclear weapons came to dominate the battlefield. The remaining Device Forts still in military use were initially garrisoned with reservist units and then closed as military establishments. St Catherine&#x27;s and Portland were decommissioned in the late 1940s, Hurst, Pendennis and Yarmouth in the 1950s, Southsea in 1960 and, after, the closure of its air base, Calshot followed in 1961.

Widespread restoration work was then carried out; at Calshot, Deal, Hurst, Pendennis, Portland, St Catherine&#x27;s and Southsea, the more modern additions to the fortifications were destroyed in an attempt to recreate the appearance of the castles at earlier periods of their history, ranging from the 16th to the 19th centuries. There was extensive research into the forts during this period, commencing in 1951 with a long-running research project commissioned by the Ministry of Works into the Device Forts, which in turn led to heightened academic interest in their histories during the 1980s.

A range of the fortifications were opened to the public in the post-war years. Deal, Hurst, Pendennis and Portland opened in the 1950s, and Southsea in 1967. Calshot followed in the 1980s, Camber after a long period of restoration work in 1994, and Sandsfoot reopened following repair work in 2012. Visitor numbers vary across the sites; Southsea Castle, for example, received over 90,000 visitors in 2011–12. Other forts were put to different uses: Netley was first used a nursing home, and then converted into private flats; Brownsea became a corporate hotel for the employees of the John Lewis Partnership; and Sandgate was restored in the 1970s to form a private home.

By the 21st century many of the Device Forts had been damaged by, or in some cases lost entirely, to coastal erosion; the problem had existed at some locations since the 16th century and still persists, for example at Hurst. East Cowes Castle and East Tilbury Fort have been entirely lost, while the East Blockhouse, Mersea and Sandsfoot have been badly damaged, a third of Sandgate and most of St Andrews have been washed away. Other sites were demolished, built upon or simply eroded over time; almost no trace remains of the bulwarks along the Downs, for example.

<doc id="1016438" wikidata="Q2968747" url="?curid=1016438" title="Camber Castle">
<text>Camber Castle, also known formerly as Winchelsea Castle, is a 16th-century Device Fort, built near Rye by King Henry VIII to protect the Sussex coast of England against French attack. The first fortification on the site was a small, round artillery tower, constructed by Henry between 1512 and 1514, overlooking the Camber anchorage and the entrance to Rye Harbour. 

In 1539, increasing tensions with France encouraged Henry to rethink his coastal defence plans, and Camber Castle was rebuilt and extended over the next year under the direction of the Moravian engineer, Stefan von Haschenperg. The results were considered unsatisfactory and further work was carried out from 1542 to 1543, at great expense, to rectify the problems. The result was a large, concentric artillery fort, with a central keep, surrounded by four circular bastions and a circular entrance bastion, built from stone and brick.

The finished castle was initially equipped with 28 brass and iron artillery guns and a garrison of 28 men, commanded by a captain. It may have seen service in 1545 when a French fleet attacked the coast, but its operational value was short lived. The Camber and the surrounding harbours began to silt up, becoming unusable by shipping, and the coastline receded away from the fort, eventually placing it well inland. Furthermore, the fort had been superseded by newer European military designs even before it had been completed, and peace with France later in the century removed much of the requirement for the fort. The castle still remained operational up until 1637, when it was closed by King Charles I. With the outbreak of civil war in 1642, much of the fortification was dismantled by Parliamentary forces to prevent it being used by the Royalists.

The ruins became a popular spot for picnics in the 18th and 19th centuries, and was painted by J. M. W. Turner. Plans to redevelop the castle as a Martello tower or as a clubhouse for a local golf course came to nothing, although the property was used in the Second World War, probably as an early warning site. 

Archaeological interest in the fort increased after the war and in 1967 it was taken into the guardianship of the state, the property being bought from the private owners in 1977. It is now operated by English Heritage, who reopened it to visitors after an extensive programme of conservation between 1968 and 1994. The fort is an unusual example of an unmodified Device Fort and is protected under UK law as a Grade I listed building.

== History ==
=== 16th – 17th centuries ===
==== Initial tower, 1512–14 ====

Camber Castle was built approximately between the ports of Rye and Winchelsea on the south coast of England, overlooking a body of water called the Camber, at the mouth of the Brede, Rother and Tillingham rivers. The two towns were part of the Cinque Ports, a strategic chain of maritime towns responsible for providing ships to the king&#x27;s navy, although Winchelsea&#x27;s harbour had silted up by the 16th century, limiting its utility, and similar problems were beginning to impact the port of Rye. The mouth of the Camber had also begun to silt up in the late medieval period, although in this case the process had created an important new anchorage for ships.

The first fortification at Camber may have been built shortly after 1486 by Sir Richard Guldeford, the Master of the Ordnance, who was given the manor of Higham by King Henry VII in exchange for Richard constructing a tower to protect the anchorage. There is no surviving evidence, however, to show if a tower was in fact built as Guldeford had promised, and Henry VII did not invest much in his coastal defences during the rest of his reign. Many castles across England were left in poor repair, often considered to be outdated and too expensive to maintain.

Henry VIII became king in 1509 and began to follow a more aggressive policy towards neighbouring France than his father. Tensions increased and in 1512 Henry ordered the construction of an artillery tower and a new bridge at Camber. The work was carried out by Edward Guldeford, Richard&#x27;s son, and cost £1,309 over the next two years. The resulting circular stone tower was across and around high, occupying the shingle spit of Kevill Point and controlling the Camber and the port of Rye. It would have provided relatively limited facilities and living accommodation, and was probably not permanently garrisoned.

Despite being an artillery tower with a flat roof to carry heavy guns, the tower was not initially supplied with any artillery and was therefore unable to protect Rye against the hostile naval expeditions which attacked the coast in the 1520s. After many letters from Guldeford to the Lord Chancellor, Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, some guns finally arrived around 1536 in the form of wrought iron serpentines. Prescient concerns began to be raised in the mid-1530s about whether the Camber might silt up further and ultimately become unusable as an anchorage.

==== Concentric design, 1539–40 ====

In 1539 the threat of invasion from France and Spain grew and Henry issued orders for his coastal defences to be improved, creating a sequence of fortifications called the Device Forts across England. These were intended to carry artillery pieces able to engage enemy naval vessels should they approach the coast, and to deter any enemy landings. As part of this programme of work, Camber Castle was considerably expanded at a cost of £5,660.

The first phase of this work took place from 1539 until autumn 1540. The Moravian engineer Stefan von Haschenperg was responsible for the design of the fort, being paid the substantial salary of £75 a year for his work on this and other similar projects, including Calshot, Hurst, Sandgate and Sandown. Philip Chute, John Fletcher and William Oxenbridge, all prominent local men, served as the commissioners for the project, Oxenbridge becoming the pay master. Finding sufficient numbers of workmen was difficult and some had to be pressed into service unwillingly. More artillery pieces were sent to the castle ahead of the work being completed, and were probably installed in temporary battery positions around the castle site.

Initially the old tower was converted into a stronger keep which was able to support artillery guns on its roof, a gatehouse was built alongside it, four stirrup towers – so-called because of their shape – a curtain wall was constructed around the outside of the castle, and bastions erected around the wall. Towards the end of this phase of work the castle was altered in a frantic burst of work, possibly driven on by pressure from the King himself. The height of the curtain wall was increased, the gatehouse extended into an entrance bastion, a new network of underground passages installed, and foreworks added around the outside of the bastions. By the end of 1540 the castle was garrisoned with 17 men and equipped with artillery, with Chute appointed as its captain.

The result was a concentric fortress, which von Haschenperg had hoped would combine the best of Italian military architecture, able to carry heavy guns but with a low profile to protect against any incoming artillery fire. Various flaws rapidly became apparent. The castle&#x27;s design had focused on defence, with the result that the guns could not easily be brought to bear on enemy vessels, which had been the original intent of building the fortification by the Camber; some of the angles of fire from the defences were blocked by the entrance and the high water table may have caused serious damp problems on the ground floor. Furthermore, the design was different from the other Device Forts constructed across the region and would have stood out as unusual and not in keeping with the King&#x27;s general intent for the chain of forts.

==== Redeveloped concentric design, 1542–43 ====

As a result of the problems with the original design, in summer 1542 work recommenced on the castle, well after the initial invasion scare was over, lasting until August 1543. The decision to rectify the problems with the castle may have been taken by King Henry himself. Oxenbridge appears to have stayed on as the pay master and acted as the master of the works, with von Haschenperg remaining in his role as engineer almost until the end of the project, despite the difficulties with his earlier work. The cost of the second phase of work was much higher than the first, around £10,000.

The design was rather different to von Haschenperg&#x27;s first castle. The keep and the stirrup towers were raised in height, the level of the floors elevated, the curtain wall was strengthened, the old bastions entirely removed and four new, larger bastions added in their place, while the older foreworks around the castle were demolished. The keep&#x27;s flat roof was altered to a pitched design, and the guns that it had supported moved into the outlying bastions. Although the size of the castle had slightly decreased, the new design had much more domestic space available for the garrison.

In practice, even the revised design ignored the acute-angled bastions which had been introduced in Europe, the round towers creating numerous patches of dead ground around the castle into which its guns could not fire; the high walls presented a greater target, the internal design was complicated and it remained difficult to move around inside the fort. Indeed, the historian Peter Harrington describes the final design as even &quot;more archaic than its predecessor&quot;. Chute&#x27;s role was extended to become the Keeper and Captain of Camber, and the Keeper of the Waters of Camber and Puddle in January 1544, for which he was paid two shillings a day. Haschenperg left England in disgrace in 1544, facing complaints that he was &quot;a man who will pretend more knowledge than he hath indeed&quot;.

The bulk of the stone for the two phases of the project was acquired by demolishing monastic buildings in Winchelsea, and by purchasing it from the nearby Fairlight and Hastings quarries. Higher quality stone was bought from Mersham in Hampshire, and from various suppliers in Normandy. Timber was acquired from Udimore, Appledore and Knell, the latter two lumber-felling operations being run directly by the Camber project team. Chalk was brought from Dover to manufacture lime, and at least 16,000 bricks initially purchased to make the necessary kilns, with possibly over 500,000 further bricks being manufactured locally as the work progressed. Steel, iron and tiles were bought locally in Sussex, along with a crane for the project&#x27;s quay.

==== Operational use ====

The castle was already obsolete by the time it had been completed, as European military design had moved beyond curved bastions, embracing the angular designs seen in the later star forts. Nonetheless, it remained operational as an artillery fort for the rest of the century, with an initial garrison in 1540 of 24 men under the command of Chute, rising to 28 men and the captain after 1542. Although it had been fitted with gunloops for handguns from the very start, the castle initially relied heavily on archers for its own protection against attack from the land. It had stocks of 140 longbows and 560 sheaves of arrows in 1568, for example, probably for use by the local militia in the event of a war. Polearms were also stored there in considerable numbers, again probably for use by the militia.

Initially the fort was equipped with between 26 and 28 artillery pieces, including brass demi-cannons, culverins, demi-culverins and a falconet, and wrought-iron guns, such as portpieces, bases and slings. After 1568, the castle typically held around nine or ten guns for most of the 16th century, including cannons, demi-cannons, culverins and demi-culverins. Brass guns could fire more quickly, up to eight times an hour, and were safer to use than their iron equivalents. It is uncertain how far the castle&#x27;s guns could have reached; analysis carried out in the 16th and 17th century on the ranges of artillery suggested that a culverin, for example, could hit at a target up to between and away.

In July 1545, the French carried out a raid at nearby Seaford, and the castle may have seen action against the French fleet. Soon, however, silt began to block the entrance to the Camber, threatening its use as an anchorage. Complaints were made to Parliament about the situation in 1548, and the authorities in Rye expressed fears in 1573 that the Camber was damaged beyond repair. By the end of the century, the reclamation of the surrounding marshes and the dumping of ballast by passing ships had accelerated the natural processes and the anchorage was ruined. The surrounding region was also less strategically important than it had once been: towns like Winchelsea and Rye were in decline, peace had been made with France in 1558 and military attention shifted towards the Spanish threat to the south-west of England.

The castle was garrisoned from 1553 onwards by between 26 and 27 men, including 17 gunners; they were led by a captain, Thomas Wilford having taken over this role by 1570. As the century went on, the castle became difficult to maintain. By 1568 the gun platforms were reported to be in &quot;utter Ruing and decay&quot;, with repairs projected to be likely to cost around £60, although it is unclear whether the repairs were carried out. Tensions between Spain and England rose, and in 1584 Queen Elizabeth I spent £171 on repairs to the castle amid fresh fears of an invasion. War broke out the next year, and in 1588, the year of the Spanish Armada, a Jesuit priest called Father Darbysher, and Roger Walton, a spy in the pay of the Spanish, made plans to hand over the castle to an invading force of French and Spanish soldiers, although the conspiracy never came to fruition.

In 1593 there was a fresh crisis with Spain and the brass guns needed for the English navy were in short supply. Brass artillery pieces were therefore rounded up from the forts along the south coast, including Camber. The number of guns at the castle remained around the same, but the larger, brass culverins and demi-cannon were removed, being replaced with smaller iron demi-culverins, sakers and a minion. In 1594 another royal survey suggested that £95 of repair work was needed on the fortifications.

=== 17th – 19th centuries ===
==== Closure and English Civil War ====
Camber Castle went through several changes at the start of the 17th century. In 1610, Peter Temple was appointed as captain of the castle, and between 1610 and 1614 the garrison was reduced to 14 soldiers, including only 4 gunners, either as an effort to reduce costs or as a result of the changing types of artillery kept at the castle. The north and south bastions were filled in to form solid gun platforms around approximately 1613 and 1615, and an earth rampart called the Rampire was built up against the south corner of the castle. These solid bastions would have sacrificed living space, less in demand with a smaller garrison, but been much cheaper to maintain. Longbows fell out of use in warfare as archery in England declined, and were replaced by arquebuses and muskets, 46 of which were kept at the castle in 1614.

Sir John Temple took over as captain in 1615, being replaced by Robert Bacon by 1618. The fortification was now both antiquated and too far from the receding sea to be useful. In 1623 it was suggested that the castle should be closed, and King Charles I was briefed on the dilapidated condition of the fortification, which was now reportedly around from the sea. The local towns campaigned to keep the castle operational but in 1636 Charles issued an instruction to demolish it; the garrison, by now led by Captain Thomas Porter, left the next year, followed by the artillery.

When civil war broke out in 1642 between the supporters of Charles and those of Parliament, Camber Castle had not been entirely closed and was being used as a royal munitions store. The citizens of Rye sided with Parliament, which agreed that the weapons and stores in the castle should be removed and taken to the town for safe-keeping. Concerned that it might be seized by Royalist forces, Parliament went on to dismantle the castle over the next year, stripping the lead from the roof, blocking up the gunports and demolishing the living accommodation. As a result, Camber Castle was not used by the Royalists during the Second English Civil War in 1648, despite several other of the Device Forts along the south coast being occupied.

==== Ruins ====

After the Restoration of Charles II to the throne in 1660, a royal survey of the castle found the fortification to be in ruins. An increasing number of visitors came to see the castle in the 18th and 19th centuries, with the north-east corner becoming a popular site for picnics. Writing in 1785, the antiquarian Francis Grose attributed the decline of the fortification to the changes in the local harbours and the superiority of the British Navy in protecting the coasts, observing that the castle&#x27;s architecture &quot;clearly shew the low state of military architecture&quot; during the 16th century in England.

In response to the threat posed by France during the Napoleonic Wars, Lieutenant Colonel John Brown surveyed the castle in 1804 to examine whether the central keep could be turned into a Martello tower, a type of circular gun tower popular during this period. The scheme was not taken forward, although the defences of the surrounding coast line were much improved by the government. The painter J. M. W. Turner visited between 1805 and 1807 during the middle of this work, later depicting the castle in landscape paintings and sketches of the area.

=== 20th – 21st centuries ===

At the start of the 20th century Camber Castle and the surrounding farmland remained in private ownership and open to visitors. In 1931 there was a proposal to turn the keep into a golf clubhouse but the project was not taken forward and the facility was built at the nearby Castle Farm instead. A research team from the Victoria County History project visited the castle in 1935, resulting in the first – albeit cursory – historical analysis and survey of the fortification being published two years later.

By the 1940s, the castle structures were mostly covered with rubble and debris, interwoven with pathways created by the movement of visitors over the years. During the Second World War, the castle was used by the British Army, possibly as an early warning site fitted with anti-aircraft searchlights. In an area just to the north of the castle, the Starfish and Naval decoy sites were created to distract incoming German bombers from the town of Rye itself. Trenches were dug in the north bastion, and military training may have been conducted around the outskirts of the castle.

In the post-war years, archaeological interest in the castle grew. From 1951 onwards the Ministry of Works carried out a long-running research project into the Device Forts, the section on Camber being written by the historian Martin Biddle and finally published in 1982. Biddle carried out an exploratory archaeological survey of the site in 1962 and the following year the ruins were closed to allow more extensive archaeological excavation by the Ministry. These were initially carried out by Biddle and Alan Cook, with support from local school children and from young offenders from the Borstal institution in Dover.

The state took Camber Castle into guardianship in 1967, and the next year the government began a slow process of restoring the castle with the intention of eventually reopening it to the public, their efforts largely focusing on protecting the internal brick walls and wall-cores. Further excavations followed in the 1970s and early 1980s.

In 1977, the Department of National Heritage bought the castle from its owners. The government agency English Heritage took control of the castle in 1984 and a scheme to reopen the property to visitors was put forward in 1993. This included a final assessment of the archaeological work of the previous decades, and the castle finally opened to the public again in 1994. As of 2015, the castle is open to visitors through guided tours organised by the Rye Harbour Nature Reserve. The site is protected under UK law as a Grade I listed building.

== Architecture and landscape ==
=== Landscape ===
Camber Castle now lies on the Brede Level, a wide, reclaimed area of land between the modern towns of Rye and Winchelsea, about from the sea. The surrounding pasture land is flat and only just above sea level, marked with numerous ridges formed by the retreating coastline over the centuries. On the eastern side of the fortification is Castle Water, a large, 20th-century gravel pit that is now flooded to form a wetland nature reserve.

A defensive earthwork runs around the south and east sides of the castle; this was probably originally topped by a stone wall and designed to protect the castle from the sea, which would have then been much closer. The remains of a raised causeway, which once linked the isolated castle to the mainland, leads away for a short distance to the south-west from the earthwork before petering out. Marks from the holes that were dug to provide the materials for the infilling of the bastions in the early 17th century also survive around the outside of the castle.

=== Architecture ===
The three-storey castle itself has changed little since its completion in 1544, an incorporates elements from all of the three phases of building work in 1512–14, 1539–40 and 1543–44. It is now roofless but still standing up to tall, and covers , almost as big as the largest of the Device Forts at Deal in Kent. 

The first tower on the site was built from fine-grained yellow sandstone, with the later expansion making use of both yellow and grey sandstone, with imported Caen stone being used for the finer detailing. Ironstone, siltstone and brown sandstone rubble and boulders was used for the core of the castle walls, some of it taken from the local cliffs.

The castle would have been entered through the entrance bastion. The core of this building was constructed in the second phase of work on the castle and was initially a square one-storey construct, across, before being extended forward by an additional to form a circular bastion; an additional floor was then added on top in the third phase. The internal walls have mostly been destroyed, but the ground floor chambers would have been used for administration, and possibly as living rooms for the deputy captain. The first floor would have formed a high-status set of chambers for the use of the captain, and included large windows, fireplaces and a private garderobe, but most of this storey has been destroyed. A special German cocklestove was probably fitted into the chambers for the use of Philip Chute, the first captain of the castle, and was illustrated with pictures of Landsknecht soldiers and Protestant German leaders; only fragments of the stove have survived.

In the centre of the fortification was the keep, built up from the round tower of 1512–14, and of the original building&#x27;s walls were incorporated into the new design. The original tower had ten gunports embedded at ground level in its walls, but these were blocked up in the second phase of building. The keep would originally had a parapet running around its roof, which was initially flat but converted to a ridged design in the third phase of work. The ground floor was laid in brick and had a brick and stone-lined well to supply it with water. The keep had two fireplaces, but these were small and not intended for cooking – indeed, the final version of the keep was probably never used as a living space. The first floor windows were added in the final phase of work; they were not intended for use as gunports, but they had bars and shutters, so could have been easily secured in the event of an attack.

An underground vaulted ring passageway, only high ran around the outside of the keep, with similar covered radial passageways leading off to each of the bastions; the passageways are now ruined. A cobbled courtyard surrounded the keep, separating it from the external defences, and containing a well in the north-west corner. Underground passageways led from the entrance bastion to outside the castle walls, either to allow the garrison to escape in an emergency or to assault a besieging force.

The outer part of the castle was defended by an octagonal wall, which linked the four stirrup turrets and bastions that formed the main defences for the castle. This wall had initially been built in the second phase of work on the castle, but was then supplemented in the final phase with an additional exterior facing, and was originally finished with a gun embrasure along each section, and parapets. A two-storey gallery, which provided relatively spacious barrack accommodation for the garrison, ran all the way around the inside of the wall, although only the ground floor of the gallery now survives. The gallery would have been lit by windows facing into the courtyard. The Rampire earthwork built in the early 17th century lies across the south and south-east parts of the defences, where the gunports were blocked up with stone when the earth was piled up along the inside of the castle.

The four stirrup towers are two storeys tall, across internally, with walls, flat at the front and curved at the back. They would originally have been topped by firing platforms, with gunloops around the inside of the fortification enabling their occupants to fire into the courtyard if necessary. The bastions built around the outside of the towers in the third phase of work are wide internally and each extend from their respective stirrup tower, with walls. Most of the bastions had a single internal gun room with a robust gun deck on top, but the West Bastion was used as a kitchen and the interior was fitted with two circular ovens and a range for cooking. The bastions would have been connected by a wall-walk and parapets, but these have since been lost. The south stirrup tower and bastion remains partially buried as a result of the construction of the Rampire.

<text>Manuela Santiago Collazo (1936–2010) was a Puerto Rican politician who was the mayor of the city of Vieques (1985–2001).

Santiago Collazo worked as a teacher at the Eugenio María de Hostos and José Gautier Benítez schools, as well as Assistant Superintendent of the Department of Education. She became Vieques&#x27; first female mayor during the 1984 general elections. She remained in that position until 2001.

A popular politician among Vieques residents and among many mainland Puerto Rico residents as well, Santiago Collazo met with various difficult moments during her tenure as mayor: In 1989, Vieques was one of the most severely affected Puerto Rican cities after the passing of Hurricane Hugo. Large amounts of money were required to return the town to normality, as the island-city&#x27;s boat service to Fajardo had to be temporarily stopped, the local airline, Vieques Air Link, suffered temporary loss of some of their aircraft, and the city lost electricity and water services. The city was later also affected by other hurricanes and storms.

In 1995, many important political figures wrote a letter to United States president Bill Clinton, asking for an investigation into an incident where an atomic bomb hit Vieques supposedly by accident in 1966. Santiago Collazo signed the letter. It could be said that this was a small beginning to what would later become mass protests by Vieques citizens against the presence of the military there. After David Sanes&#x27; death by a military bomb in 1999, the protests intensified, and, by 2003, the military left the island of Vieques.

Santiago Collazo led a campaign to attract more airlines to Vieques&#x27; small airport facility. The campaign has succeeded in part: whereas during the early 1980s only Vieques Air Link and Prinair provided service to the airport, now the airport is served by Vieques Air Link, Air Culebra and a number of other small carriers from around the rest of the Caribbean.

Manuela Santiago Collazo did not seek re-election in the 2000 General Elections.

She died on December 14, 2010 at Hospital del Maestro in Hato Rey, Puerto Rico after suffering a heart attack.

==Legacy==
An elementary school in Vieques was named posthumously after Manuela Santiago Collazo.

<text>William Edward Sparks (5 September 1922 – 1 December 2002) was a British Royal Marine Commando in World War II. He was the last survivor of the &quot;Cockleshell Heroes&quot; of Operation Frankton in 1942; a team of commandos who paddled 85 miles from the Bay of Biscay up the Gironde estuary to Bordeaux in German occupied France, to plant limpet mines on merchant ships supplying the Nazi war machine.

==Operation Frankton==
Sparks was born in Bartholomew Buildings, Seward Street, Clerkenwell, London and joined the Royal Marines upon the outbreak of World War II. He volunteered for hazardous service as a way of avenging his brother Benny who had died on the cruiser HMS &quot;Naiad&quot;.

During the night of 7 December 1942, ten Royal Marines set out in five folding kayaks on Operation Frankton in Bordeaux, France. They caused considerable damage to five German ships, but six of the men were shot by the Germans and two died of hypothermia after their canoe capsized. The two survivors, Sparks and Major Herbert &quot;Blondie&quot; Hasler, made their way overland to the town of Ruffec, There, they met escape line leader, Mary Lindell, who arranged for them to be smuggled across the border into Spain from where they reached safety in Gibraltar. 

When Hasler flew home, Sparks was sent back to England under arrest, as no one in Gibraltar could corroborate his story. On arrival, he escaped from the military police and went to see his father, who had been told that he was missing in action. Two days later, he reported to the Admiralty and was about to be arrested again, when he slipped out to Combined Operations Headquarters, where he was greeted with astonishment.

During the rest of the war, he served in Burma, North Africa and Italy. Afterwards, he worked as a bus driver, during the Malayan Emergency as a police lieutenant, and then as a bus inspector.

Sparks lived for many years in Loughton, Essex, where he is commemorated by a blue plaque on his house there, before moving in the early seventies to Canvey Island. After the death of his first wife Violet in 1982, Sparks and his second wife Irene relocated to Alfriston, East Sussex.

Sparks was survived by his second wife, a daughter and three sons.

==Honours and awards==
*29 June 1943 - Distinguished Service Medal &quot;For courage and enterprise: Marine William Edward Sparks, Ply.X.3664.&quot;.
*There is a blue plaque to Sparks on the council house he occupied after the war in Poundfield Road, Loughton, Essex.

<doc id="1016446" wikidata="Q628622" url="?curid=1016446" title="Hurst Castle">
<text>Hurst Castle is an artillery fort established by Henry VIII on the Hurst Spit in Hampshire, England, between 1541 and 1544. It formed part of the king&#x27;s Device Forts coastal protection programme against invasion from France and the Holy Roman Empire, and defended the western entrance to the Solent waterway. The early castle had a central keep and three bastions, and in 1547 was equipped with 26 guns. It was expensive to operate due to its size, but it formed one of the most powerful forts along the coast. During the English Civil War of the 1640s, Hurst was held by Parliament and was used briefly to detain King Charles I before his execution in 1649. It continued in use during the 18th century but fell into disrepair, the spit being frequented by smugglers.

Repairs were made during the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars with France, and the castle was modernised to enable it to hold 24-pounder (10.8 kg) guns. Fresh fears of invasion followed in the 1850s, leading to heavier, 32-pounder (14.5 kg) armament being installed and new gun batteries being laid out on both sides of the castle. Technological developments rapidly made these defences obsolete, however, and a fresh phase of work between 1861 and 1874 created sixty-one gun positions in two long, granite-faced batteries alongside the older castle. These held very heavy weapons, including massive 12.5 inch, 38 ton (317 mm, 39,000 kg) rifled muzzle-loading guns. As the century progressed, these too became outdated and lighter, quick-firing guns were installed at the castle to replace them.

The castle formed part of a network of defences around the entrance to the Solent during the First World War, and was re-armed again during the Second World War. The military decommissioned the fort in 1956 and it passed into the control of the Ministry of Works. In the 21st century, it is run jointly by English Heritage and the Friends of Hurst Castle as a tourist attraction, receiving around 40,000 visitors during 2015. Coastal erosion has become a growing problem despite government intervention in protecting the spit. Four lighthouses have been built at Hurst from the 18th century onwards, one of which, a high lighthouse first opened in 1867, remains in active service.

In January 2021, local media reported that the castle was in urgent need of repairs due to coastal erosion, and the wall of the eastern wing partially collapsed on 26 February 2021 as the sea cut into and compromised its foundations. The World Monuments Fund included the castle on their 2022 &quot;World Monuments Watch&quot; list of most endangered sites.

In September 2022, it was one of six English castles included in a fundraising campaign by English Heritage to mitigate risks of destruction due to worsening coastal erosion. They hope to gather enough funds to repair and strengthen the sea walls around the castle.

==History==

===16th century===

Hurst Castle was built as a consequence of international tensions between England, France and the Holy Roman Empire in the final years of the reign of King Henry VIII. Traditionally the Crown had left coastal defences to local lords and communities, only taking a modest role in building and maintaining fortifications, and while France and the Empire remained in conflict, maritime raids were common but an actual invasion of England seemed unlikely. Modest defences based around simple blockhouses and towers existed in the south-west and along the Sussex coast, with a few more impressive works in the north of England, but in general the fortifications were limited in scale. Worsley&#x27;s Tower, for example, built opposite the future site of Hurst Castle in the 1520s, was too small to hold powerful artillery and considered by surveyors in 1539 to be &quot;one of the worst devised things&quot; they had seen.

In 1533, Henry broke with Pope Clement VII over the annulment of his long-standing marriage to Catherine of Aragon. Catherine was the aunt of Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor, who took the annulment as a personal insult. This resulted in France and the Empire declaring an alliance against Henry in 1538, and the Pope encouraging the two countries to attack England. An invasion of England appeared certain. In response, Henry issued an order, called a &quot;device&quot;, in 1539, giving instructions for the &quot;defence of the realm in time of invasion&quot; and the construction of forts along the English coastline.

Hurst Castle was designed to protect the western entrance to the Solent, a body of water that led from the English Channel to the naval base at Portsmouth and, through Southampton Water, to the important port of Southampton. The castle was one of four fortifications that William Fitzwilliam, the Lord High Admiral, and William Paulet recommended building to strengthen the defences along the Solent; the others were at East and West Cowes, and Calshot. It was positioned on the Hurst Spit, a strip of shingle sheltering saltmarsh and mud flats, only across the water from the Isle of Wight. Temporary earthwork fortifications were erected on the site and, after the other three castles had been completed, work then began on Hurst in 1541 under the direction of John Mille, the financial controller, and probably Thomas Bertie, a master mason. Bertie was appointed as the castle&#x27;s captain in 1542 and the work was completed by January 1544, at a cost of over £3,200.
The result was a stone artillery fort with a central keep and three bastions, surrounded by a moat, capable of holding up to 71 guns. In 1547, however, Hurst was equipped with 26 artillery pieces–four made of brass and the remainder iron–comprising a two sakers, a culverin, a demi-cannon, a curtall cannon, two demi-culverins, six portpieces, four slings, two quarter-slings, and seven bases, three of them inoperable. A 1559 survey commented that Hurst Castle was essential for sending reinforcements from the mainland to the island, and noted that it was equipped with eleven brass and iron guns, with nine further broken guns, along with handguns, bows and arrows, pikes and bills. The survey observed that the castle was vulnerable to attack because it lacked flanking protection and had rounded walls, and that it was expensive to garrison because of its size, requiring a captain, his deputy, twelve gunners, nine soldiers and a porter. The historian John Kenyon notes, however, that its considerable armament made it one of the most powerful forts in the south, even if it was equipped with lighter guns than would have been ideal for its &quot;ship-killing&quot; role.

Meanwhile, the invasion threat from France had passed and a lasting peace was made in 1558; government concerns shifted away from the south coast towards the Spanish threat to the south-west of England. By 1569, when Thomas Carew was serving as Hurst&#x27;s captain, there were less than ten guns but the same size of garrison to that seven years before. His son, Sir Thomas Gorges, became captain in turn, and in 1593 he reported that the castle&#x27;s gun platforms were in serious need of repair.

===17th century===

In the early 1600s, England was at peace with France and Spain, and the country&#x27;s coastal defences received little attention. The Gorges family continued as captains at Hurst, with Sir Edward Gorges taking up the post in 1610, but the castle was neglected. In 1628, the castle was unable to prevent Flemish ships from passing along the Solent, as only four or five of the castle&#x27;s twenty-seven guns were functional, and the fort had no ammunition or powder for them. The government replaced all the brass ordnance in the castle, which were preferred, particularly on ships, as they could fire faster and more safely, with iron guns in 1635.

At the beginning of the English Civil War in 1642 between the supporters of Charles I and Parliament, the castle was occupied by Captain Richard Swanley, a supporter of Parliament. In December 1648 it was briefly used to detain the King before his trial and execution. During the interregnum, it remained in use under the command of Colonel Thomas Eyre and was reinforced in 1650 to deal with the threat of a Royalist invasion.

After Charles II was restored to the throne in 1660, Eyre was dismissed and replaced by Edward Strange. The future of the castle was uncertain; Charles gave orders to demobilise the garrison and briefly considered having the fortress demolished altogether. Instead of maintaining a regular garrison, in 1666 it was decided to staff the castle using soldiers deployed from the Isle of Wight instead, from a unit belonging to Sir Robert Holmes, the island&#x27;s governor. Hurst had meanwhile fallen into disrepair, delaying the plans to deploy Holmes&#x27; men until 1671. Repairs were carried out and, by 1675, a conventional garrison and almost thirty guns were stationed at Hurst.

===18th century===

Hurst Castle continued to be used as a military base in the 18th century, but was also used to hold a Franciscan confessor, Father Paul Atkinson. Amid concerns over the moral condition of England and a perceived threat to the established Church, an act for &quot;further preventing the growth of popery&quot; was passed in 1700; Hurst was chosen by the Privy Council to house any priests convicted under this law. Atkinson was probably the only person detained in this way, and he was held for 29 years from 1700 onwards, before finally dying at the castle.

There had been reported problems with smuggling around Hurst Castle since the 1670s, and these continued into the 18th century. In 1729, the Revenue service hired the &quot;Hurst&quot;, a wide, heavy yacht, to assist in anti-smuggling operations out of Southampton, arming its crew with muskets, pistols and swords. The problems persisted and, later in the century, the site was used as a rendezvous for smugglers led by a notorious criminal called John Streeter.

The castle fell into neglect, and reports from the 1770s through into the early 1790s noted extensive problems, complaining that the fort&#x27;s guns could no longer be mounted on the dilapidated bastions and that water was seeping through the decaying walls. By 1793, the castle was considered to be &quot;in the worst condition&quot; of all the forts along the coast, and all its guns were unusable. Repairs were authorised, but little was actually done. The spit around the castle began to be used by civilians, including fishermen and gardeners; a lighthouse, called the Hurst Tower, was built there in 1786, and the Shipwright&#x27;s Arms inn was established alongside the castle.

The Revolutionary War with France broke out in 1793, leading to the extensive modernisation of the castle. Repairs were carried out in 1794 at a cost of £647, followed by a review of the defences the next year by the Master-General of the Ordnance. The 16th-century castle was still strongly fortified by the standards of the time, but it could not support the heavier guns or batteries of artillery required to tackle enemy warships. Instead, two new gun batteries, each armed with five 36-pounder (16.3 kg) guns, were built alongside the castle in 1795, with a further eighteen 9-pounder (4 kg) guns mounted in the old fort; the guns concerned had all been captured from the French.

===19th century===

====1800–58====

In 1803, war with France appeared imminent once again. After some discussions, it was agreed to adapt the 16th-century keep to enable it to hold six 24-pounder (10.8 kg) guns; the roof was vaulted and a central stone pillar was installed to run up through the building, work estimated at the time to be likely to cost £4,122. The historian Andrew Saunders likens the resulting building to the various Martello towers being constructed along the south coast at this time. It was proposed to build two temporary gun batteries to replace the 1795 emplacements, which had suffered from the salt air and decayed, but the plan was turned down in order to focus attention on the redevelopment of the keep. The work was carried out by a mixture of soldiers and civilian contractors and was completed by the end of 1806.

The remodelled castle did not play an active part in the Napoleonic Wars, although it was used in 1809 as a hospital for injured soldiers returning from the Peninsular War in Spain. A second lighthouse, known as the High Lighthouse, was constructed alongside the castle in 1812.

Official interest in Hurst Castle increased again in the 1840s, as the introduction of shell guns and steam ships created a new risk that the French might successfully attack along the south coast. Previously, sailing ships had been only able to pass the castle slowly when moving against the tide, making them vulnerable to its guns; steamships threatened to cruise past at speed. Military estimates and surveys in 1850 and 1851 suggested that the armament should therefore be significantly increased, to include more and much heavier guns.

Improvements were carried out between 1852 and 1856 at a cost of over £6,725. The keep was adapted to support 32-pounder (14.5 kg) guns, the seaward-facing bastions and curtain walls were reinforced with brick casemates and new gun positions, and the moat was deepened to protect against any surprise attack. Two batteries were built to the west and east of the castle, protected by shingle and earth and linked to the old castle by covered passageways called caponiers; a defensible barrack block was built beside the western battery, to provide further protection against any attack from the land. The result was that Hurst was re-established as a powerful fortification, equipped with fourteen 32-pounder guns, fifteen 8-inch (203 mm) shell guns and two 32-pounder carronades; in wartime, these required a team of 440 men, with a peacetime garrison of 105 soldiers. Fort Albert was built across the water on the Isle of Wight to provide supporting fire. The old inn was first reused as the garrison canteen and then demolished.

The 1852, the Isle of Wight Electric Company laid a specially-armoured telegraph cable to link the castle with Keyhaven on the mainland and Sconce Point on the island; two years later, the Electric Telegraph Company linked the castle to Southampton. Hurst used flags to pass on telegraphic messages to and from shipping entering the Solent.

====1859–99====

Rapid advances in military technology made the new defences obsolete before the end of the decade. The introduction of rifled breech-loading guns, capable of firing explosive shells, and the construction of armour-plated warships left Hurst&#x27;s guns and fortifications inadequate. Fears grew in 1859 that France might invade England, potentially in a surprise attack. A 1859 Royal Commission recommended that Hurst, as one of the key forts protecting Portsmouth, should be upgraded as a matter of priority.

Hurst was equipped with new heavy, RML guns in heavily protected casemated positions. These weapons were slow to reload, so to ensure that the castle would have a good chance of hitting enemy ships passing at speed, two long batteries of weapons were built onto either side of the old castle, a west wing with 37 gun positions and an east wing with 24 positions. These were built on top of the two gun batteries constructed there a few years before and also required the castle&#x27;s moat to be filled in. As work progressed, the decision was taken to reinforce the batteries with additional iron shields.

The work eventually cost £211,000; it began in 1861, with the majority of the work being completed by 1870 and the additional iron shielding by 1874. In peacetime, the castle held around 131 officers and men but it would have needed to be substantially reinforced during wartime if all the weapons were to be manned. Although the fort never received its full complement of guns, by 1881 it had ten 12.5 inch, 38 ton (317 mm, 39,000 kg) rifled muzzle-loading (RML) guns, fifteen 10 inch, 18 ton (254 mm, 18,000 kg) RML guns, five 9 inch, 12 ton (228 mm, 12,000 kg) RML guns, and 3 64-pounders (29 kg), together forming a powerful arsenal.

Two new lighthouses were constructed in the 1860s. The first was the &quot;Low Light&quot; built into the rear wall of the west wing of the castle. The second lighthouse was the &quot;High Light&quot; – the free standing Hurst Point Lighthouse built on the end of Hurst Spit between 1865 and 1867. A new public house, the Castle Inn, was established on the north end of the spit. A narrow-gauge railway was constructed in the 1880s to move supplies into the castle.

By the 1880s and 1890s, both the power of naval artillery and the speed of warships had further increased, leading to further investment in the castle between 1888 and 1893. The keep&#x27;s magazine, which could hold up to 2,250 shells, was reinforced with concrete and the south bastion of the old castle was filled in with shingle and concrete for additional protection. New 6-pounder (2.7 kg) quick-firing guns were installed in a battery on the end of the east wing, supported by machine guns, to enable them to target fast moving vessels, particularly the new torpedo boats. Further emplacements for 12-pounder (5.4 kg) guns followed, including one on the top of the keep.

Thomas Clarke, one of the executed leaders of the Easter Rising in Dublin in 1916, was born in Hurst Castle.

===20th and 21st centuries===

By the First World War, the guns installed at Hurst Castle in the 1870s were obsolete. The castle retained seventeen of them, as historian Coad states, wired up together &quot;like a collection of elderly blunderbusses&quot;, but the fort depended on its newer quick-firing weapons. During the war, Hurst&#x27;s armament was controlled from Needles Battery, where a Fire Command Post, equipped with telegraphy, had been established. After the war, the guns were removed from the 16th-century part of the castle, which was passed into the national collection of the Ministry of Works in 1933, although some modernisation of the rest of the fortification took place in the 1930s. The &quot;low light&quot; was replaced by a new iron lighthouse in 1911.

During the Second World War, Hurst was re-armed in 1940 with two 12-pounder (5.4 kg) guns and a unit of the Isle of Wight Rifles was stationed there, controlled from the Fire Control Needles. Searchlights and two more 6-pounder (2.7 kg) guns followed the next year, when the 37-strong detachment was retitled the 129 Coastal Battery Royal Artillery, followed by the installation of Bofors anti-aircraft guns. A tower, called the Director Tower, was built along the west wing. As the war progressed, the weapons were stood down and the battery finally closed in July 1945, with most of the weapons being removed after the war.

In 1956 the whole of Hurst Castle was transferred to the guardianship of the Ministry of Works. During the 1970s, the additional concrete protection added to the south bastion in the 1880s was removed. When the government agency English Heritage was formed in 1983, it took over the control of the castle. In 1996 the Friends of Hurst Castle took on the day-to-day management of the castle, with English Heritage continuing to run other aspects of the site. As of 2015, the castle received around 40,000 visitors a year. The castle is protected under UK law as an ancient monument. The High Lighthouse built in 1867 continues in use, and is protected as a grade II listed building. The spit and the adjoining coastline is protected as an SSSI.
The spit is subject to coastal erosion which has gradually pushed the spit towards the shore, a process which has eaten away at the remnants of the 1852 west wing battery and barracks, and has exposed the foundations of the later fortress on occasions. This erosion has increased significantly since the 1940s, due to the construction of groyne barriers at nearby Bournemouth and Christchurch which prevented the natural renewing of the spit with pebbles washed from local cliffs. Government efforts began in the 1960s to try to stabilise the spit in its current position, both to protect the castle and neighbouring towns, with over of gravel being laid down in the 1990s, and is continuing in the 21st century. Erosion caused fresh damage to the eastern end of the castle in early 2013, leading to renewed concerns.

In January 2021, local media reported that the castle was in urgent need of repairs due to coastal erosion and the wall of the eastern wing partially collapsed on 26 February 2021. Efforts to repair the damaged wall commenced the following month, using shingle and granite to stabilise the section of the wall still intact and build a protective revetment, which was completed in June of that year. English Heritage reported that the full repair effort would take &#x27;many months&#x27; to complete.

In October 2021, the castle and lighthouse together were among 142 sites across England to receive part of a £35-million grant from the government&#x27;s Culture Recovery Fund. In September 2022, it was one of six English castles included in a fundraising campaign by English Heritage to mitigate risks of destruction due to worsening coastal erosion. They hope to gather enough funds to repair and strengthen the sea walls around the castle.

The central castle was originally constructed in the 16th century but heavily redeveloped in the early and middle years of the 19th century. It comprises a central tower with three bastions to its north-west, north-east and south, approximately across. A curtain wall with gun positions originally linked the three bastions, but this was substantially altered with the addition of walls and chambers to produce a deeper structure. The central castle forms the entrance to the rest of the fortification and is accessed through a gateway dating from 1873. The 16th-century moat that protected the castle was filled in during the 1860s.

The twelve-sided central tower, or keep, is approximately across; it has two storeys and a basement. The inside of the tower is circular, with a spiral staircase running up through a central pillar. The ground floor and first floor rooms would have originally been sub-divided to form living quarters for the garrison, but are now open spaces. Both have eight embrasure windows, suitable for holding lighter weaponry; the first-floor room was sufficiently elevated to have potentially fired out over the external walls. The roof has the remains of gun positions dating from the 1850s and was originally topped by a look-out tower, removed in 1805. When first built, the keep was linked by three bridges to the outer bastions.

The two-storied north-west bastion protected the castle against attack along the spit from the mainland, and housed the castle&#x27;s original portcullis as well as providing accommodation for the garrison. It had three levels of gun positions on its ground floor, first floor, and roof, which were adapted in the 19th century to house heavier weapons and shelter riflemen. The bastion links to an external caponier, a covered walkway with rifle loops for close defence, built in 1852. The north-east and south-east bastions are only one storey tall, originally holding two levels of gun positions on the ground floor and roofs, again both adapted to support heavier guns in the 19th century.

===West and East Wings===

The West and East Wing date from the 1860s and are built from brick and stone. They had a lines of gun positions, each designed to hold a heavy gun and a crew of up to 12 men. The positions were protected by granite-fronted casemates and wrought-iron shields, and, with removable window screens, doubled as living accommodation for the crews. Small magazines were positioned behind the lines of casemates.

The West Wing is approximately long, and has 37 heavy gun positions and two main magazines, along with various auxiliary buildings, including canteens, stores and detention facilities. It also has two of the castle&#x27;s lighthouses, an 1865 tower, now disused, and an iron, gas-lit tower, still in use. The garden is a recreation of the garden in the Second World War. The late-19th century and early-20th guns at the castle were predominantly added to the West Wing, and it roof supports emplacements for 12- and 6-pounder (5.4 and 2.7 kg) quick-firing guns, a Bofors gun and associated directing positions. A small theatrical theatre, built by gunners in the Second World War, survives in one of the gun positions, along with various wall paintings, possibly used in performances.

The East Wing is relatively unaltered since its construction. It is approximately long, with 24 heavy gun positions and two main magazines; on the roof is the original gun directing position and a Bofors gun position added during the Second World War. It is reached through a gateway in the north-east bastion. Just beyond the East Wing are three 6-pounder quick-firing gun emplacements from 1893, which were fed ammunition from the wing through a hole in the outer wall.

<text>William Pattison (1706–1727) was a short-lived English poet, now mostly remembered for his erotic poems. Pattison was admitted to Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge in 1724, but in 1726 left for a literary life in London without taking a degree. He was supported by the London bookseller Edmund Curll, one of Alexander Pope&#x27;s foes, who printed his collected works in 1728. The second volume was &quot;Cupid&#x27;s metamorphoses or, love in all shapes&quot;; including a &quot;Panegyrick on Cundums&quot;.

<text>Yarmouth Castle is an artillery fort built by Henry VIII in 1547 to protect Yarmouth Harbour on the Isle of Wight from the threat of French attack. Just under across, the square castle was initially equipped with 15 artillery guns and a garrison of 20 men. It featured an Italianate &quot;arrow-head&quot; bastion on its landward side; this was very different in style from the earlier circular bastions used in the Device Forts built by Henry and was the first of its kind to be constructed in England.

During the 16th and 17th centuries the castle continued to be maintained and modified; the seaward half of the castle was turned into a solid gun platform and additional accommodation was built for the fort&#x27;s gunners. A bulwark was built on the east side of the castle and an additional gun battery was placed on the town&#x27;s quay, just to the west. For most of the English Civil War of the 1640s it was held by Parliament; following the Restoration, it was refortified by Charles II in the 1670s.

The fortification remained in use through the 18th and 19th centuries, albeit with a smaller garrison and fewer guns, until in 1885 these were finally withdrawn. After a short period as a coast guard signalling post, the castle was brought back into military use during the First and Second World Wars. In the 21st century, the heritage organisation English Heritage operates the castle as a tourist attraction.

==History==

===16th century===

====Construction====

Yarmouth Castle was built as a consequence of international tensions between England, France and the Holy Roman Empire in the final years of the reign of King Henry VIII. Traditionally the Crown had left coastal defences to the local lords and communities, only taking a small role in building and maintaining fortifications, and while France and the Empire remained in conflict with one another, maritime raids were common but an actual invasion of England seemed unlikely. Modest defences, based around simple blockhouses and towers, existed in the south-west and along the Sussex coast, with a few more impressive works in the north of England, but in general the fortifications were very limited in scale.

In 1533, Henry broke with Pope Paul III to annul the long-standing marriage to his wife, Catherine of Aragon, and remarry. This resulted in France and the Empire declaring an alliance against Henry in 1538, and the Pope encouraged the two countries to attack England. Henry responded in 1539 by ordering the construction of fortifications along the most vulnerable parts of the coast, through an instruction called a &quot;device&quot;. The immediate threat passed, but resurfaced in 1544, with France threatening an invasion across the Channel, backed by her allies in Scotland. Henry therefore issued another device in 1544 to further improve the country&#x27;s defences, particularly along the south coast.

The town of Yarmouth on the Isle of Wight may have been attacked by the French in 1543; if so, this raid probably encouraged the construction of a castle there as part of the second wave of Device Forts. The fort functioned alongside the existing defences in the Solent and protected the main crossing from the west side of the island to the mainland. Yarmouth Castle was a square artillery fort built around a central courtyard with an angular, &quot;arrow-head&quot; bastion protecting the landward side. It was initially equipped with three cannons and culverins, and twelve smaller guns, firing from a line of embrasures along the seaward side of the castle. It was garrisoned by a small team of soldiers, consisting of a master gunner, a porter and 17 soldiers, commanded by Richard Udall, the castle&#x27;s first captain. Udall lived in the castle, but the soldiers resided in the local town.

The castle was constructed by George Mills under the direction of Richard Worsley, the Captain of the Island, on land belonging to the Crown, possibly on the site of a church destroyed during the events of 1543. Henry had dissolved the monasteries in England a few years before, and stone from the local Quarr Abbey was probably reused in the construction of the castle. It was finished by 1547, when Mills was paid £1,000 for his work and to discharge the soldiers who had been guarding the site during the project.

====Initial use====
When the Roman Catholic Queen Mary I succeeded to the throne there were changes in the leadership on the Isle of Wight and the castle. Worsley was dismissed in favour of a Roman Catholic appointee in 1553 and Udall was executed in 1555 for his role in the Dudley conspiracy to overthrow the Queen. When the Protestant Elizabeth I came to the throne in 1558, however, peace was made with France and military attention shifted towards the Spanish threat to England. Elizabeth reappointed Worsley to his post and he carried out an extensive redevelopment of the castle. Worsley filled in half of the castle&#x27;s courtyard to produce a solid artillery platform able to hold eight heavy guns with an uninterrupted field of fire over the sea, and he probably also constructed the Master Gunner&#x27;s House on the other side of the castle. Nonetheless, an inspection in 1586 showed that the fortification was in poor condition. Work costing £50 was done in 1587, including the erection of an earth bulwark alongside the castle to mount additional guns. The next year saw the attempted invasion of England by the Spanish Armada, after which further repairs were carried out on the castle. By 1599 the Crown was informed that the castle, which was still considered an important defence for the Solent, needed expensive repairs.

===17th century===

Yarmouth Castle continued to be an important military fortification, used both as a fortress but also as a transport hub and a stores depot. The repairs recommended in 1599 were carried out in the first years of the 17th century and a further £300 was invested in Yarmouth Castle and nearby Sandown Castle in 1609, including adding two angular buttresses along the walls facing the sea.

A survey in 1623 by the castle&#x27;s captain, John Burley, reported that the garrison comprised only four gunners and the captain, with the buildings in a &quot;ruinous&quot; state and the defences in need of repair; similar concerns were raised in 1625 and 1629. Suggestions that a half-moon battery should be added to the defences were not progressed, but in 1632 the parapets were raised in height and further lodgings and a long room for stores were constructed within the castle. Some of the stone used for this may have been reused from nearby Sandown, whose walls had been destroyed by the sea; before it was used at Sandown, the stone appears to have been taken from the local monasteries.

Civil war broke out in 1642 between the followers of King Charles I and those of Parliament. Initially, Captain Barnaby Burley, a relative of John, and an ardent Royalist, held the castle on behalf of the King with a tiny garrison. Burley negotiated surrender terms, including that he initially be allowed to remain in the castle with armed protection, and the castle remained in the control of Parliament for the rest of the war. Early during the Interregnum it was decided to increase the size of the garrison at the castle from 30 to 70 soldiers, due to concerns about a potential Royalist attack from the island of Jersey. Most of the soldiers lived outside the castle itself. The annual cost of this force was around £78 and in 1655 the garrison was made smaller again to reduce costs.
When Charles II returned to the throne in 1660, he demobilised most of the existing army and the following year the garrison at Yarmouth was given four days notice to leave the castle. The King announced that the castle&#x27;s artillery would be sent to Cowes, unless the town of Yarmouth agreed to take over the financial responsibility of running the site themselves. The town declined to do so, but Charles repeated the offer in 1666; this time Yarmouth seems to have taken action, appointing four soldiers for a garrison, although the town did not assign an officer to command them, or apparently make any repairs to the now dilapidated castle.

The Crown took over the castle again in 1670, and Robert Holmes, the new Captain of the Isle of Wight, had some of the guns brought back from Cowes to the castle. The site was refortified and a new battery placed on the adjacent quay, but the older earthworks were demolished and the moat was filled in. Holmes built a mansion for himself alongside the castle, where on three occasions he hosted the King.

In 1688, Charles&#x27; brother, James II, faced widespread revolt and a potential invasion of England by William of Orange. Holmes was a supporter of James, but although he intended to control Yarmouth Castle on the monarch&#x27;s behalf, the local inhabitants and the garrison at Yarmouth sided with William, preventing him from openly siding with the King.

===18th–21st centuries===

Yarmouth Castle continued to be used, and records from 1718 and 1760 show it was equipped with eight and five guns along the castle and the quay platforms, respectively. Throughout this period it was probably staffed by a captain and six gunners, supported by the local militia. In the early 18th century, Holmes&#x27; mansion was rebuilt, forming its current appearance. By the 18th century, however, Yarmouth Harbour had gradually silted up and been destroyed by industrial developments, reducing the value of the anchorage, and the design of the castle had become outdated.

In 1813, during the Napoleonic Wars, work was carried out to alter the design of the parapet. The Crimean War sparked a fresh invasion scare and in 1855 the south coast of England was refortified. Yarmouth Castle underwent considerable repairs that year; four naval guns and traversing rails were installed on the castle platform, and a regular county army unit was put in place to garrison the fort. In 1881 a proposal was put forward to modernise the entire fortification, but this was rejected and in 1885 the garrison and the guns were withdrawn.

The coastguard began using the castle as a signalling station in 1898. In 1901, the War Department passed the castle to the Commissioners of Woods and Forests and in 1912 parts of the castle were leased to the Pier Hotel, which incorporated Robert Holmes&#x27;s former mansion; the Pier Hotel eventually became the George Hotel and still occupies part of the old castle moat. The Office of Works took control of the castle in 1913, carrying out a programme of repairs, and it was used by the military in both the First and Second World Wars. It was finally retired from military use in the 1950s.

In the 21st century, Yarmouth Castle is run by the heritage organisation English Heritage as a tourist attraction, receiving 9,007 visitors in 2010. It is protected under UK law as a Grade I listed building and as a scheduled monument.

==Architecture==

Yarmouth Castle is a square fortification, nearly across, with an arrow-head bastion protecting the landward side. The north and west walls face the sea, protected by angular buttresses, and a wide moat originally protected the south and east side, although this has since been filled in. The castle&#x27;s 16th-century bulwark, which originally covered the area to the west of Pier Street and the north of Quay Street, and its quay battery have also been destroyed.

The walls of the castle are mainly built from ashlar stone, with some red brick used on the south side. The walls are pierced by a small number of gunloops, including in the &quot;ears&quot; of the bastion, which would have overlooked the moat. When first built the interior of the castle formed a sequence of buildings around a courtyard, but the southern half of the castle was filled in shortly afterwards to produce a solid gun platform able to support heavy guns. It was later raised again in the 17th century to its current height. The parapet is now covered with turf, with 19th-century rounded corners, and the platform still has the rails on which the four naval guns would have traversed, dating from 1855. A small lodging room, built on the platform at the top of the stairs, has since been destroyed.

The arrow-head design of the castle&#x27;s bastion reflected new ideas about defensive fortifications spreading out from Italy in the 16th century. Earlier Henrician castles had used the older European style of semi-circular bastions to avoid presenting any weak spots in the stonework, but an arrow-headed design enabled defenders to provide much more effective supporting fire against an attacking force. Yarmouth was among the first fortifications in Europe, and the first in England, to adopt this design.

The accommodation and other facilities are on the south side of the castle. On the ground floor, the entrance to the castle leads through to a courtyard, linked to four barrel-vaulted rooms in the south-west corner, originally 17th-century lodgings for the garrison. Two of these chambers were converted for use as magazines and the fittings of one of these still remains in place. In the south-east corner is the Master Gunner&#x27;s House, comprising a parlour, hall and kitchen on the ground floor, and a chamber and attic on the floors above. The parlour and hall would have originally been separated by a screen; the chamber would also have been subdivided. On the first floor is a small chamber, supported on arches above the courtyard, which was used as a lodging. On the second floor, the Long Room runs on top of the barrel-vaulted chambers, its massive, original roof still intact.

<doc id="1016465" wikidata="Q216858" url="?curid=1016465" title="KNVB Cup">
<text>The KNVB Beker (; ), branded as the TOTO KNVB Beker for sponsorship reasons, is a competition in the Netherlands organised by the Royal Dutch Football Association (KNVB) since 1898. It was based on the format of the English FA Cup. Outside the Netherlands, it is often referred to as the Dutch Cup. The tournament consists of all teams from the top four tiers of Dutch league football (Eredivisie, Eerste Divisie, Tweede Divisie and Derde Divisie), as well as the 24 semi-finalists (or replacements) of the six KNVB District Cups. The finals of the tournament traditionally takes place in De Kuip, and has been held there every season since the 1989 final. The winners of the cup compete against the winners of the Eredivisie for the Johan Cruyff Shield, (equivalent to a super cup) which acts as the curtain raiser for the following season.

==History==
===Early history===
The first attempt to hold a knock-out competition open to all clubs in the Netherlands was made in 1894, with the winners receiving a trophy offered by H.M.C. Holdert, former president of V.V.A. (Amsterdam). Seven teams entered and the first ever cup match in the Netherlands was thus held on 11 February, between Haarlem and HFC, ending in a 3–1 win to the latter. However, no other match was played due to the withdraws of several teams, and the lack of interest shown by the clubs caused Holdert to withdraw his trophy, so the final between HFC and R.A.P. was canceled, but four years later, in January 1898, Holdert offered another cup, to be contested just like the English FA Cup, and thus the KNVB Cup was conceived during a board meeting of the Dutch Football Association, in The Hague, on 19 January 1898. Initially, it was decided to stage a competition for this new trophy already in the ongoing 1897–98 season, but the board had to cancel it after a prolonged stretch of bad weather in the first weeks of February had led to numerous match postponements in the western leagues.

The tournament finally began the following season, 1898–99. The first final was played on 9 May 1899 between RAP Amsterdam and HVV Den Haag, and ended in a 1–0 victory for the former thanks to a goal from Jan Hisgen in extra-time.

In 1946, the trophy was changed to one made out of silver, which was extremely rare in the immediate aftermath of World War II. That trophy remains in use today.

===Recent history===
In 2018, a trophy colored in gold was commissioned to commemorate the 100th edition of the tournament.

===Name changes===
Like many national cup competitions, the name of the tournament has changed with sponsorship. From 1995, the competition went from being the KNVB Beker to being known as the Amstel Cup after the then sponsor Amstel. On 16 August 2005, the name was changed to the Gatorade Cup after the drinks company Gatorade. In 2006, the name returned to being the KNVB Beker with Gatorade remaining as the principal sponsor.

On 12 January 2018, it was announced that TOTO would be the name sponsor of the KNVB Cup, until the 2021–22 season. The competition was renamed the TOTO KNVB Beker with immediate effect.

===European competition===
Up until 1998, the winner of the cup entered into the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, but with the abandonment of that tournament, the winner now goes into the UEFA Europa League. If the winning team has finished in the top two of the Eredivisie and thus gained entry into the UEFA Champions League, the berth will be redistributed to that season&#x27;s Eredivisie.

In 1998, both KNVB Cup finalists, Ajax and PSV, gained entry in the Champions League, so a third-place play-off was played between the beaten semi-finalists, SC Heerenveen and FC Twente, to determine who would take the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup place.

<doc id="1016480" wikidata="Q718998" url="?curid=1016480" title="Community development">
<text>The United Nations defines community development as &quot;a process where community members come together to take collective action and generate solutions to common problems.&quot; It is a broad concept, applied to the practices of civic leaders, activists, involved citizens, and professionals to improve various aspects of communities, typically aiming to build stronger and more resilient local communities.

Community development is also understood as a professional discipline, and is defined by the International Association for Community Development as &quot;a practice-based profession and an academic discipline that promotes participative democracy, sustainable development, rights, economic opportunity, equality and social justice, through the organisation, education and empowerment of people within their communities, whether these be of locality, identity or interest, in urban and rural settings&quot;.

Community development seeks to empower individuals and groups of people with the skills they need to effect change within their communities. These skills are often created through the formation of social groups working for a common agenda. Community developers must understand both how to work with individuals and how to affect communities&#x27; positions within the context of larger social institutions.

&quot;Community development&quot; as a term has taken off widely in anglophone countries, i.e. the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, as well as other countries in the Commonwealth of Nations. It is also used in some countries in Eastern Europe with active community development associations in Hungary and Romania. The &quot;Community Development Journal&quot;, published by Oxford University Press, since 1966 has aimed to be the major forum for research and dissemination of international community development theory and practice.

Community development approaches are recognised internationally. These methods and approaches have been acknowledged as significant for local social, economic, cultural, environmental and political development by such organisations as the UN, WHO, OECD, World Bank, Council of Europe and EU. There are a number of institutions of higher education offer community development as an area of study and research such as the University of Toronto, Leiden University, SOAS University of London, and the Balsillie School of International Affairs, among others.

== Definitions ==
There are complementary definitions of community development.

The United Nations defines &quot;community development&quot; broadly as &quot;a process where community members come together to take collective action and generate solutions to common problems.&quot; and the International Association for Community Development defines it as both a practice based profession and an academic discipline. Following the adoption of the IACD definition in 2016, the association has gone on to produce International Standards for Community Development Practice. The values and ethos that should underpin practice can be expressed as: Commitment to rights, solidarity, democracy, equality, environmental and social justice. The purpose of community development is understood by IACD as being to work with communities to achieve participative democracy, sustainable development, rights, economic opportunity, equality and social justice. This practice is carried out by people in different roles and contexts, including people explicitly called professional community workers (and people taking on essentially the same role but with a different job title), together with professionals in other occupations ranging from social work, adult education, youth work, health disciplines, environmental education, local economic development, to urban planning, regeneration, architecture and more who seek to apply community development values and adopt community development methods. Community development practice also encompasses a range of occupational settings and levels from development roles working with communities, through to managerial and strategic community planning roles.

The Community Development Challenge report, which was produced by a working party comprising leading UK organizations in the field including the (now defunct) Community Development Foundation, the (now defunct) Community Development Exchange and the (now defunct) Federation for Community Development Learning defines community development as:
A set of values and practices which plays a special role in overcoming poverty and disadvantage, knitting society together at the grass roots and deepening democracy. There is a community development profession, defined by national occupational standards and a body of theory and experience going back the best part of a century. There are active citizens who use community development techniques on a voluntary basis, and there are also other professions and agencies which use a community development approach or some aspects of it.

Community Development Exchange defines community development as:
both an occupation (such as a community development worker in a local authority) and a way of working with communities. Its key purpose is to build communities based on justice, equality and mutual respect.
Community development involves changing the relationships between ordinary people and people in positions of power, so that everyone can take part in the issues that affect their lives. It starts from the principle that within any community there is a wealth of knowledge and experience which, if used in creative ways, can be channeled into collective action to achieve the communities&#x27; desired goals.
Community development practitioners work alongside people in communities to help build relationships with key people and organizations and to identify common concerns. They create opportunities for :the community to learn new skills and, by enabling people to act together, community development practitioners help to foster social inclusion and equality.

== Different approaches ==
There are numerous overlapping approaches to community development. Some focus on the processes, some on the outcomes/ objectives. They include:
* Arts, Culture, and Development; focuses on the role of arts and culture in community development, social transformation
* Community Engagement; focuses on relationships at the core of facilitating &quot;understanding and evaluation, involvement, exchange of information and opinions, about a concept, issue or project, with the aim of building social capital and enhancing social outcomes through decision-making” (p. 173).
* Women Self-help Group; focusing on the contribution of women in settlement groups.
* Community capacity building; focusing on helping communities obtain, strengthen, and maintain the ability to set and achieve their own development objectives.
* Large Group Capacitation; an adult education and social psychology approach grounded in the activity of the individual and the social psychology of the large group focusing on large groups of unemployed or semi-employed participants, many of whom with Lower Levels of Literacy (LLLs).
* Social capital formation; focusing on benefits derived from the cooperation between individuals and groups.
* Nonviolent direct action; when a group of people take action to reveal an existing problem, highlight an alternative, or demonstrate a possible solution to a social issue which is not being addressed through traditional societal institutions (governments, religious organizations or established trade unions) to the satisfaction of the direct action participants.
* Economic development, focusing on the &quot;development&quot; of developing countries as measured by their economies, although it includes the processes and policies by which a nation improves the economic, political, and social well-being of its people.
* Community economic development (CED); an alternative to conventional economic development which encourages using local resources in a way that enhances economic outcomes while improving social conditions. For example, CED involves strategies which aim to improve access to affordable housing, medical, and child care.
** A worker cooperative is a progressive CED strategy that operates as businesses both managed and owned by their employees. They are beneficial due to their potential to create jobs and providing a route for grassroots political action. Some challenges that the worker cooperative faces include the mending of the cooperative’s identity as both business and as a democratic humanitarian organization. They are limited in resources and scale.
* Sustainable development; which seeks to achieve, in a balanced manner, economic development, social development and environmental protection outcomes.
* Community-driven development (CDD), an economic development model which shifts overreliance on central governments to local communities.
* Asset-based community development (ABCD); is a methodology that seeks to uncover and use the strengths within communities as a means for sustainable development.
* Faith-based community development; which utilizes faith-based organizations to bring about community development outcomes.
* Community-based participatory research (CBPR); a partnership approach to research that equitably involves, for example, community members, organizational representatives, and researchers in all aspects of the research process and in which all partners contribute expertise and share decision making and ownership, which aims to integrate this knowledge with community development outcomes.
* Community organizing; an approach that generally assumes that social change necessarily involves conflict and social struggle in order to generate collective power for the powerless.
* Participatory planning including community-based planning (CBP); involving the entire community in the strategic and management processes of urban planning; or, community-level planning processes, urban or rural.
* Town-making; or machizukuri (まちづくり) refers to a Japanese concept which is &quot;an umbrella term generally understood as citizen participation in the planning and management of a living environment&quot;. It can include redevelopment, revitalization, and post-disaster reconstruction, and usually emphasizes the importance of local citizen participation. In recent years, cooperation between local communities and contents tourism (such as video games, anime, and manga) has also become a key driver of machizukuri in some local communities, such as the tie-up between CAPCOM&#x27;s Sengoku Basara and the city of Shiroishi.
* Language revitalization focuses on the use of a language so that it serves the needs of a community. This may involve the creation of books, films and other media in the language. These actions help a small language community to preserve their language and culture.
* Methodologies focusing on the educational component of community development, including the community-wide empowerment that increased educational opportunity creates.
* Methodologies addressing the issues and challenges of the Digital divide, making affordable training and access to computers and the Internet, addressing the marginalisation of local communities that cannot connect and participate in the global Online community. In the United States, nonprofit organizations such as &quot;Per&quot; Scholas seek to “break the cycle of poverty by providing education, technology and economic opportunities to individuals, families and communities” as a path to development for the communities they serve.

There are a myriad of job titles for community development workers and their employers include public authorities and voluntary or non-governmental organisations, funded by the state and by independent grant making bodies. Since the nineteen seventies the prefix word &#x27;community&#x27; has also been adopted by several other occupations from the police and health workers to planners and architects, who have been influenced by community development approaches.

== History ==
Amongst the earliest community development approaches were those developed in Kenya and British East Africa during the 1930s. Community development practitioners have over many years developed a range of approaches for working within local communities and in particular with disadvantaged people. Since the nineteen sixties and seventies through the various anti poverty programmes in both developed and developing countries, community development practitioners have been influenced by structural analyses as to the causes of disadvantage and poverty i.e. inequalities in the distribution of wealth, income, land, etc. and especially political power and the need to mobilise people power to affect social change. Thus the influence of such educators as Paulo Freire and his focus upon this work. Other key people who have influenced this field are Saul Alinsky (Rules for Radicals) and E. F. Schumacher (&quot;Small Is Beautiful&quot;). There are a number of international organisations that support community development, for example, Oxfam, UNICEF, The Hunger Project and Freedom from Hunger, run community development programs based upon community development initiatives for relief and prevention of malnutrition. Since 2006 the Dragon Dreaming Project Management techniques have spread to 37 countries and are engaged in an estimated 3,250 projects worldwide.

=== In the global North ===
In the 19th century, the work of the Welsh early socialist thinker Robert Owen (1771–1851), sought to develop a more perfect community. At New Lanark and at later communities such as Oneida in the USA and the New Australia Movement in Australia, groups of people came together to create utopian or intentional communities, with mixed success. Some such communities, formed &quot;ex nihilo&quot;, contrast the concepts of the development of a community at a later stage.

==== United States ====
In the United States in the 1960s, the term &quot;community development&quot; began to complement and generally replace the idea of urban renewal, which typically focused on physical development projects - often at the expense of working-class communities. One of the earliest proponents of the term in the United States was social scientist William W. Biddle (100-1973). In the late 1960s, philanthropies such as the Ford Foundation and government officials such as Senator Robert F. Kennedy took an interest in local nonprofit organizations. A pioneer was the Bedford Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation in Brooklyn, which attempted to apply business and management skills to the social mission of uplifting low-income residents and their neighborhoods. Eventually such groups became known as &quot;Community development corporations&quot; or CDCs. Federal laws, beginning with the 1974 Housing and Community Development Act, provided a way for state and municipal governments to channel funds to CDCs and to other nonprofit organizations.

National organizations such as the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation (founded in 1978 and known since 2005 as NeighborWorks America), the Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC) (founded in 1980), and the Enterprise Foundation (founded in 1981) have built extensive networks of affiliated local nonprofit organizations to which they help provide financing for numerous physical- and social-development programs in urban and rural communities. The CDCs and similar organizations have been credited by some with starting the process that stabilized and revived seemingly hopeless inner-city areas such as the South Bronx in New York City.

==== United Kingdom ====
In the UK, community development has had two main traditions. The first was as an approach for preparing for the independence of countries from the former British Empire in the 1950s and 1960s. Domestically, community development first came into public prominence with the Labour Government&#x27;s anti deprivation programmes of the latter 1960s and 1970s. The main example of this activity, the CDP (Community Development Programme), piloted local area-based community development. This influenced a number of largely urban local authorities, in particular in Scotland with Strathclyde Region&#x27;s major community-development programme (the largest at the time in Europe).

The Gulbenkian Foundation was a key funder of commissions and reports which influenced the development of community development in the UK from the latter 1960s to the 1980s. This included recommending that there be a national institute or centre for community development, able to support practice and to advise government and local authorities on policy. This resulted in the forma establishment in 1991 of the Community Development Foundation. In 2004 the Carnegie UK Trust established a commission of inquiry into the future of rural community development, examining such issues as land reform and climate change. Carnegie funded over sixty rural community-development action-research projects across the UK and Ireland and national and international communities of practice to exchange experiences. This included the International Association for Community Development (IACD).

In 1999 the Labour Government established a UK-wide organisation responsible for setting professional-training standards for all education and development practitioners working within local communities. This organisation, PAULO – the National Training Organisation for Community Learning and Development, was named after Paulo Freire (1921-1997). It was formally recognised by David Blunkett, the Secretary of State for Education and Employment. Its first chair was Charlie McConnell, the Chief Executive of the Scottish Community Education Council, who had played a lead role in bringing together a range of occupational interests under a single national-training standards body, including community education, community development and development education. The inclusion of community development was significant as it was initially uncertain as to whether it would join the National Training Organisation (NTO) for Social Care. The Community Learning and Development NTO represented all the main employers, trades unions, professional associations and national-development agencies working in this area across the four nations of the UK.

The new body used the wording &quot;community learning and development&quot; to acknowledge that all of these occupations worked primarily within local communities, and that this work encompassed not just providing less formal learning support but also a concern for the wider holistic development of those communities – socio-economically, environmentally, culturally and politically. By bringing together these occupational groups this created for the first time a single recognised employment-sector of nearly 300,000 full- and part-time paid staff within the UK, approximately 10% of these staff being full-time. The NTO continued to recognise the range of occupations within it, for example specialists who work primarily with young people, but all agreed that they shared a core set of professional approaches to their work. In 2002 the NTO became part of a wider Sector Skills Council for lifelong learning.

The UK currently hosts the only global network of practitioners and activists working towards social justice through community development approach, the International Association for Community Development (IACD). IACD, formed in the USA in 1953, moved to Belgium in 1978 and was restructured and relaunched in Scotland in 1999.

==== Canada ====
Community development in Canada has roots in the development of co-operatives, credit unions and &quot;caisses populaires&quot;. The Antigonish Movement which started in the 1920s in Nova Scotia, through the work of Doctor Moses Coady and Father James Tompkins, has been particularly influential in the subsequent expansion of community economic development work across Canada.

==== Australia ====
Community development in Australia has often focussed on Aboriginal Australian communities, and during the period of the 1980s to the early 21st century funds channelled through the Community Employment Development Program, where Aboriginal people could be employed in &quot;a work for the dole&quot; scheme, gave the chance for non-government organisations to apply for a full or part-time worker funded by the Department for Social Security. Dr Jim Ife, formerly of Curtin University, organised a ground-breaking text-book on community development.

=== In the &quot;Global South&quot; ===
Community planning techniques drawing on the history of utopian movements became important in the 1920s and 1930s in East Africa, where community development proposals were seen as a way of helping local people improve their own lives with indirect assistance from colonial authorities.

Mohandas K. Gandhi adopted African community development ideals as a basis of his South African Ashram, and then introduced it as a part of the Indian Swaraj movement, aiming at establishing economic interdependence at village level throughout India. With Indian independence, despite the continuing work of Vinoba Bhave in encouraging grassroots land reform, India under its first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru adopted a mixed-economy approach, mixing elements of socialism and capitalism. During the fifties and sixties, India ran a massive community development programme with focus on rural development activities through government support. This was later expanded in scope and was called integrated rural development scheme [IRDP]. A large number of initiatives that can come under the community development umbrella have come up in recent years.

The main objective of community development in India remains to develop the villages and to help the villagers help themselves to fight against poverty, illiteracy, malnutrition, etc. The beauty of Indian model of community development lies in the homogeneity of villagers and high level of participation.

Community development became a part of the Ujamaa Villages established in Tanzania by Julius Nyerere, where it had some success in assisting with the delivery of education services throughout rural areas, but has elsewhere met with mixed success. In the 1970s and 1980s, community development became a part of &quot;Integrated Rural Development&quot;, a strategy promoted by United Nations Agencies and the World Bank. Central to these policies of community development were:
* Adult literacy programs, drawing on the work of Brazilian educator Paulo Freire and the &quot;Each One Teach One&quot; adult literacy teaching method conceived by Frank Laubach.
* Youth and women&#x27;s groups, following the work of the Serowe Brigades of Botswana, of Patrick van Rensburg.
* Development of community business ventures and particularly cooperatives, in part drawn on the examples of José María Arizmendiarrieta and the Mondragon Cooperatives of the Basque region of Spain
* Compensatory education for those missing out in the formal education system, drawing on the work of Open Education as pioneered by Michael Young.
* Dissemination of alternative technologies, based upon the work of E. F. Schumacher as advocated in his book &quot;Small Is Beautiful: A Study of Economics As If People Mattered&quot;
* Village nutrition programs and permaculture projects, based upon the work of Australians Bill Mollison and David Holmgren.
* Village water supply programs

In the 1990s, following critiques of the mixed success of &quot;top down&quot; government programs, and drawing on the work of Robert Putnam, in the rediscovery of social capital, community development internationally became concerned with social capital formation. In particular the outstanding success of the work of Muhammad Yunus in Bangladesh with the Grameen Bank from its inception in 1976, has led to the attempts to spread microenterprise credit schemes around the world. Yunus saw that social problems like poverty and disease were not being solved by the market system on its own. Thus, he established a banking system which lends to the poor with very little interest, allowing them access to entrepreneurship. This work was honoured by the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize.

Another alternative to &quot;top down&quot; government programs is the participatory government institution. Participatory governance institutions are organizations which aim to facilitate the participation of citizens within larger decision making and action implementing processes in society. A case study done on municipal councils and social housing programs in Brazil found that the presence of participatory governance institutions supports the implementation of poverty alleviation programs by local governments.

The &quot;human scale development&quot; work of Right Livelihood Award-winning Chilean economist Manfred Max Neef promotes the idea of development based upon fundamental human needs, which are considered to be limited, universal and invariant to all human beings (being a part of our human condition). He considers that poverty results from the failure to satisfy a particular human need, it is not just an absence of money. Whilst human needs are limited, Max Neef shows that the ways of satisfying human needs is potentially unlimited. Satisfiers also have different characteristics: they can be violators or destroyers, pseudosatisfiers, inhibiting satisfiers, singular satisfiers, or synergic satisfiers. Max-Neef shows that certain satisfiers, promoted as satisfying a particular need, in fact inhibit or destroy the possibility of satisfying other needs: e.g., the arms race, while ostensibly satisfying the need for protection, in fact then destroys subsistence, participation, affection and freedom; formal democracy, which is supposed to meet the need for participation often disempowers and alienates; commercial television, while used to satisfy the need for recreation, interferes with understanding, creativity and identity. Synergic satisfiers, on the other hand, not only satisfy one particular need, but also lead to satisfaction in other areas: some examples are breastfeeding; self-managed production; popular education; democratic community organizations; preventative medicine; meditation; educational games.

==== India ====
Community development in India was initiated by Government of India through Community Development Programme (CDP) in 1952. The focus of CDP was on rural communities. But, professionally trained social workers concentrated their practice in urban areas. Thus, although the focus of community organization was rural, the major thrust of Social Work gave an urban character which gave a balance in service for the program.

==== Vietnam ====
International organizations apply the term community in Vietnam to the local administrative unit, each with a traditional identity based on traditional, cultural, and kinship relations. Community development strategies in Vietnam aim to organize communities in ways that increase their capacities to partner with institutions, the participation of local people, transparency and equality, and unity within local communities.

Social and economic development planning (SDEP) in Vietnam uses top-down centralized planning methods and decision-making processes which do not consider local context and local participation. The plans created by SDEP are ineffective and serve mainly for administrative purposes. Local people are not informed of these development plans. The participatory rural appraisal (PRA) approach, a research methodology that allows local people to share and evaluate their own life conditions, was introduced to Vietnam in the early 1990s to help reform the way that government approaches local communities and development. PRA was used as a tool for mostly outsiders to learn about the local community, which did not effect substantial change.

The village/commune development (VDP/CDP) approach was developed as a more fitting approach than PRA to analyze local context and address the needs of rural communities. VDP/CDP participatory planning is centered around Ho Chi Minh&#x27;s saying that &quot;People know, people discuss and people supervise.&quot; VDP/CDP is often useful in Vietnam for shifting centralized management to more decentralization, helping develop local governance at the grassroots level. Local people use their knowledge to solve local issues. They create mid-term and yearly plans that help improve existing community development plans with the support of government organizations. Although VDP/CDP has been tested in many regions in Vietnam, it has not been fully implemented for a couple reasons. The methods applied in VDP/CDP are human resource and capacity building intensive, especially at the early stages. It also requires the local people to have an &quot;initiative-taking&quot; attitude. People in the remote areas where VDP/CDP has been tested have mostly passive attitudes because they already receive assistance from outsiders. There also are no sufficient monitoring practices to ensure effective plan implementation. Integrating VDP/CDP into the governmental system is difficult because the Communist Party and Central government&#x27;s policies on decentralization are not enforced in reality.

Non-governmental organizations (NGO) in Vietnam, legalized in 1991, have claimed goals to develop civil society, which was essentially nonexistent prior to the Đổi Mới economic reforms. NGO operations in Vietnam do not exactly live up to their claimed goals to expand civil society. This is mainly due to the fact that NGOs in Vietnam are mostly donor-driven, urban, and elite-based organizations that employ staff with ties to the Communist Party and Central government. NGOs are also overlooked by the Vietnam Fatherland Front, an umbrella organization that reports observations directly to the Party and Central government. Since NGOs in Vietnam are not entirely non-governmental, they have been coined instead as &#x27;VNGOs.&#x27; Most VNGOs have originated from either the state, hospital or university groups, or individuals not previously associated with any groups. VNGOs have not yet reached those most in need, such as the rural poor, due to the entrenched power networks&#x27; opposition to lobbying for issues such the rural poor&#x27;s land rights. Authoritarianism is prevalent in nearly all Vietnamese civic organizations. Authoritarian practices are more present in inner-organizational functions than in organization leaders&#x27; worldviews. These leaders often reveal both authoritarian and libertarian values in contradiction. Representatives of Vietnam&#x27;s NGO&#x27;s stated that disagreements are normal, but conflicts within an organization should be avoided, demonstrating the one-party &quot;sameness&quot; mentality of authoritarian rule.

<text>Southsea Castle, historically also known as Chaderton Castle, South Castle and Portsea Castle, is an artillery fort originally constructed by Henry VIII on Portsea Island, Hampshire, in 1544. It formed part of the King&#x27;s Device programme to protect against invasion from France and the Holy Roman Empire, and defended the Solent and the eastern approach to Portsmouth. The castle had a square central keep, two rectangular gun platforms to the east and west, and two angled bastions to the front and rear, and was an early English example of the &quot;trace italienne&quot;-style of fortification popular on the Continent. The Cowdray engraving of the Battle of the Solent in 1545 depicted Henry VIII visiting the castle. Despite several serious fires, it remained in service and saw brief action at the start of the English Civil War in 1642 when it was stormed by Parliamentary forces.

The castle was expanded in the 1680s by Sir Bernard de Gomme and, after a period of neglect in the 18th century, was redesigned again in 1814 during the Napoleonic Wars. After a brief period of use as a military prison in the 1840s, the fortification was expanded in the 1850s and 1860s with additional gun batteries on the east and west sides. The defences were upgraded throughout the century due to the fears of a French invasion and formed part of the plan for defending Portsmouth during the First World War. In the interwar years some of the fortifications were stood down, but the castle saw service again in the Second World War, when it was involved in Operation Grasp, the seizure of French naval vessels in Portsmouth harbour. In 1960, Southsea Castle, by now obsolete, was sold to Portsmouth City Council. It was restored to its pre-1850 appearance and opened as a tourist attraction, receiving over 90,000 visitors from 2011–12.

==History==
===16th century===

Southsea Castle was built as a consequence of international tensions between England, France and the Holy Roman Empire in the final years of the reign of King Henry VIII. Traditionally the Crown had left coastal defences to local lords and communities, only taking a modest role in building and maintaining fortifications, and while France and the Empire remained in conflict, maritime raids were common but an actual invasion of England seemed unlikely. Modest defences based around simple blockhouses and towers existed in the south-west and along the Sussex coast, with a few more impressive works in the north of England, but in general the fortifications were limited in scale.

In 1533, Henry broke with Pope Paul III over the annulment of his long-standing marriage to Catherine of Aragon. Catherine was the aunt of Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor, who took the annulment as a personal insult. This resulted in France and the Empire declaring an alliance against Henry in 1538, and the Pope encouraging the two countries to attack England. An invasion of England appeared certain. In response, Henry issued an order, called a &quot;device&quot;, in 1539, giving instructions for the &quot;defence of the realm in time of invasion&quot; and the construction of forts along the English coastline. The immediate threat passed, but resurfaced in 1544, with France threatening an invasion across the Channel, backed by her allies in Scotland. Henry therefore issued another device to further improve the country&#x27;s defences, particularly along the south coast.
The castle was built on the southern end of Portsea Island to protect a deep-water channel running through the Solent to the royal naval base at Portsmouth. Work began in early 1544, under the overall direction of Sir Anthony Knyvett, the Governor of Portsmouth, supported by Richard Cawarden, the Dean of Chichester, and John Chatterton, the captain of the Portsmouth garrison; Thomas Bertie was appointed as the master mason. It is uncertain who designed the castle, although Knyvett described it as being &quot;of his Majesty&#x27;s own device&quot;, which typically indicated that the King had taken a personal role. The design abandoned the earlier use of semi-circular bastions, which could not be fully covered by flanking fire from the supporting walls, and instead used an angular design, forming an early, if imperfect, adoption of the &quot;trace italienne&quot;-style of fortification already in use in Continental Europe.

The work was carried out quickly due to the risk of a French attack, and by July two brass saker guns were mounted on the site. It cost at least £3,100, £1,300 of which came from the proceeds of the Dissolution of the Monasteries, with chalk, stone and timber being brought across from the neighbouring Isle of Wight. The castle was completed by October and formed a fortification with a square keep, rectangular gun platforms to the east and west, and angled bastions to the front and rear. Chatterton was appointed the new captain, with a team of eight soldiers, twelve gunners and a porter. The castle was well-armed, with seven brass artillery pieces - a culverin, demi-culverin, cannon and demi-cannon - and eight iron guns.

The French invasion emerged in 1545, when Admiral Claude d&#x27;Annebault crossed the Channel and arrived off the Solent with 200 ships on 19 July, landing troops on the Isle of Wight. Henry&#x27;s fleet made a brief sortie, resulting in the Battle of the Solent, in which the English flagship, the &quot;Mary Rose&quot;, was lost, before retreating safely behind the protective fortifications. Henry was present in Portsmouth at the time and the Cowdray engraving of the battle depicts him visiting Southsea Castle. The French expedition moved further on along the coast on 25 July, bringing an end to the immediate invasion threat, but Henry gave orders for additional improvements to the fortification to be made that summer, including the construction of stone flankers and timber caponiers, to guard against a potential infantry attack. Edward VI spent a night at the castle in 1552 while inspecting the defences of Portsmouth.

===17th century===

In the early 1600s, England was at peace with France and Spain and as a result the coastal defences received little attention; a survey found Southsea Castle to be &quot;verie ill prepared for defence&quot;, with no guns mounted along the walls or any stocks of powder. In March 1626, a serious fire broke out that destroyed the interior of the keep and generated panic among the ships moored nearby. The damage was not repaired until 1635, when 210 loads of timber was sent from the New Forest for use in the work. Another serious fire then broke out in 1640, causing damage to the lodgings and store rooms.

At the start of the English Civil War in 1642, fighting broke out around Portsmouth between the Royalist forces, led by Colonel George Goring, and Parliamentarians under the command of Colonel Richard Norton. Southsea Castle was held by the Royalist Captain Challoner, supported by a small garrison of eleven men and 14 guns, and Norton decided to attack the fortification with 400 infantry and two troops of cavalry. The assault took place in the early hours of the morning on 5 September; the garrison had positioned their guns to point inland, so the attackers stormed the moat on the seaward side. They then demanded that the garrison surrender but Challoner, who had been drinking heavily with Goring the night before, refused to discuss this and asked them to return later in the day. A fresh assault began and the garrison surrendered without loss of life. The capture of the castle left Portsmouth&#x27;s position untenable and the town surrendered. A significant Parliamentarian garrison was then installed in the castle to keep it from being retaken.

The castle was primarily used as a prison during the interregnum and the early days of the Restoration. Concerns about a potential Dutch attack grew, however, and in 1665 King Charles II commissioned his Dutch-born master engineer, Sir Bernard de Gomme, to carry out a major scheme to improve the defences of Portsmouth, including Southsea Castle. Funding and poor organisation meant that the work did not begin until the 1680s. It included constructed an earthwork glacis around the castle; a new castle gate; four projecting turrets; and a redesign of the central keep. A large, stone plaque above the gatehouse entrance, bearing Charles&#x27; coat of arms, is dated 1683.

When opposition grew in 1688 against the Catholic King James II, the military establishment around Portsmouth was controlled by the King&#x27;s illegitimate son, James FitzJames, the Duke of Berwick. Revolution broke out and for a period Portsmouth and its defences were important to the King as a potential exit route for the Royal Family to France; by late December, however, this route was no longer needed. George Legge, the Baron Dartmouth, pressurised FitzJames to hand over control of Southsea Castle to the Protestant Captain Carter on 18 December and Portsmouth surrendered to the revolution two days later. The traveller Celia Fiennes, who visited the castle in 1690, observed that it was &quot;very fine, but I think it is but of little strength and service.&quot;

===18th – 19th centuries===

The east side of the castle was badly damaged in an explosion in August 1759, caused after cooking sparks fell onto gunpowder stored in the castle by the 72nd Regiment of Foot; 17 men, women and children were killed. Probably as a consequence of this event, a new powder store called the Firebarn was built outside the north side of the castle. By the second half of the century, the castle was in poor condition and, according to one contemporary account, only garrisoned by &quot;an old sergeant and three or four men who sell cakes and ale&quot;. The Master–General of the Ordnance, Charles Lennox, the Duke of Richmond, reported in 1785 that it was &quot;of too bad a form to deserve the expense necessary to repair it&quot; and proposed building a more modern fort along the coast instead. By the end of the century, coastal erosion had destroyed most of the 18th-century grand battery.

With the outbreak of the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars at the end of the 18th century, Southsea Castle&#x27;s importance increased once again. In 1797, a French invasion appeared imminent and the castle was urgently readied for action; only eight 32-pounder (14.5 kg) and five 6-pounder (2.7 kg) guns were available and these were in a poor condition. In 1813, work was begun to expand the castle, under the direction of Major-General Benjamin Fisher. Fisher had the work carried out by a mixture of soldiers and civilian contractors, arguing that it made it easier to contain costs and prevent union activity and the project cost an estimated £18,105. The fort was extended north by up to , with the keep and interior bailey redesigned in brick. The moat was rebuilt and a counterscarp galley was built round the edge. Most of the work was finished by 1814 although the final elements were not completed until 1816.
A lighthouse, commissioned by the Admiralty, was constructed on the western gun platform in 1828. In 1854 its height was raised and it now stands at above its base atop the walls. The lamp burned sperm oil and was installed behind a fixed dioptric; it showed red and white sectors (red and green from 1854) to guide ships through the safe water between Horse Sand and Spit Sand. The lighthouse keeper was housed in the castle itself. The lighthouse was in continuous use until 2017, when it was superseded by a new structure as part of changes made to approaches to Portsmouth Harbour in preparation for the arrival of the Royal Navy&#x27;s new Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers. The original dioptric lens, which was subsequently replaced, is now on display inside the castle.

An 1837 enquiry had looked into the management of military offenders in the south of England and in 1844 it was decided to bring Southsea Castle and Fort Clarence into use as military prisons, to reduce the pressure on the civilian gaols in the area and to provide a more suitable military environment for the prisoners. Southsea was used as a prison until 1850, holding 150 offenders under the supervision of a Royal Artillery sergeant who also oversaw the remaining artillery defences.
The introduction of shell guns and steam ships in the 1840s created a new risk that the French might successfully attack along the south coast. In 1850, with the closure of the prison, seven 8-inch (22.3 cm) guns were mounted along the walls in brick emplacements, but there were concerns about the defences and two earthwork auxiliary batteries were built just alongside the castle to house additional guns. In 1856, at the end of the Crimean War, there was a large review of the fleet along the Solent, attended by Queen Victoria and numerous tourists. Naval gunboats launched a mock attack on the castle, which responded by firing a volley of forty 8-inch guns, causing chaos among the crowds watching around the base of the fortification.

Fresh worries about France, combined with the development of rifled cannon and iron-clad warships, led to the Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom expressing fears about the security of Portsmouth in 1860. Lieutenant-Colonel Jervois oversaw the broader programme of work across the country, and was supported at Southsea by Lieutenant-Colonel Fisher. New gun batteries with underground magazines were constructed on the west and east sides of the castle between 1863 and 1869 to form part of a complex enclosed by a defensive wall; the old castle was used for range and direction finding, rather than to house weapons, and was left to slowly decline. By 1886, the site was well-armed, with 25 rifled, muzzle-loading guns and the design was praised by a visiting Russian military engineer.

By the 1890s, the castle&#x27;s defences had become obsolete once again due to the development of torpedo boats and superior breech-loading guns. In response, five 6-pounder quick-firing guns and searchlights were installed to deal with the torpedo boat threat and, between 1899 and 1901, the east battery was converted to hold breech-loading guns at a cost of £16,670.

Meanwhile, in 1785, the government had taken possession of Southsea Common, the marshland surrounding the castle, to ensure it remained open and accessible to the fort&#x27;s guns, and convicts were deployed to fill in and flatten out the marshes from 1831 onwards. The surrounding area began to develop as an urban centre; seaside facilities were established at the start of the century and in the 1840s new private housing was built around the edge of the common, used by military and naval officers. The construction of a railway line from London enabled the settlement of Southsea, named after the castle, to turn into a prosperous resort. Southsea Common was leased by the local government in 1884 and, as the population grew, practising firing the castle&#x27;s guns became more difficult.

===20th – 21st centuries===

At the start of the 20th century, Southsea Castle formed part of the &quot;Fortress Portsmouth&quot; plan for defending the Solent, the east battery equipped with two BL 6-inch (15.2 cm) Mark VII guns and two BL 9.2-inch (23.3 cm) Mark X guns, and the west battery armed with three 12-pounders (5.4 kg) and one 4.7-inch (11.9 cm) QF gun. During the First World War, the castle was at first manned by Royal Garrison Artillery and Number 4 company of the Hampshire Royal Garrison Artillery Territorials. Later these units were transferred to France and were replaced by the Hampshire Royal Garrison Artillery Volunteers. In response to the threat from German zeppelin raids, a QF 3-inch 20 cwt (10.9 cm 50.8 kg) anti-aircraft gun was added to the castle. Even though the castle remained in active military use after the conflict, by 1929 it had become a tourist attraction, and visitors were able to watch the castle garrison carry out practice firings out to sea. Southsea Common was bought by Portsmouth City Council in 1922 and turned into a park, while the west battery was disarmed in 1927.

During the Second World War, the Hampshire Heavy Regiment, Royal Artillery (Territorial Army), occupied the castle, which was used as the Headquarters Portsmouth Fixed Defences. During the war, the castle was manned by a range of units including coastal artillery from the regular army and the home guard, and the east battery was armed with two 9.2-inch BL Mark X guns. Living conditions were poor, with the keep described by one member of the Auxiliary Territorial Service as &quot;cold and wet and horrible&quot;. The castle was protected by barrage balloons, but it was hit by at least two incendiary bombs which did little damage.

During the war, the castle was involved in an armed stand-off with French naval vessels. After the Fall of France in 1940, some of the French ships had made their way to British ports, including Portsmouth, but fears rose that the warships might leave and fall into German hands. On 23 June, the castle was ordered to man its guns and to be prepared to fire on the French navy to prevent their departure; one gun, albeit not ready for action, was levelled at the fleet and the French destroyer Léopard responded by aiming its guns at the castle, but no shooting ensued. On 3 July, under Operation Grasp, British forces boarded and seized the ships, ending the confrontation.

Southsea Castle was obsolete in the post-war years and in 1960 it was sold to Portsmouth City Council for £35,000. The council carried out restoration work and archaeological surveys, removing many of the later, post-1850 features and landscaping the surrounding area; in 1967 it was opened as a museum, although the lighthouse remained in operation. The west and east batteries were partially demolished by the council in the 1960s.

In the 21st century the castle is still operated as a tourist attraction by the council and received over 90,000 visitors from 2011–12. The castle houses a collection of cannon. Two of these, a 68-pounder (30.8 kg) and an RML 9-inch 12 ton (22.8 cm 12,192 kg) gun, are located in the grounds, and within the castle itself is a 24-pounder (10.8 kg) from HMS &quot;Royal George&quot;, an RML 9-pounder 8 cwt (4 kg 406 kg) and two hexagonally rifled Witworth 3-pounder (1.3 kg) breech-loaders dating from 1876. The castle is protected under UK law as a Scheduled Ancient Monument.

<doc id="1016484" wikidata="Q3005559" url="?curid=1016484" title="Cruis'n Exotica">
<text>Cruis&#x27;n Exotica is a 1999 racing game developed and published by Midway Games for arcades. The game is a sequel to &quot;Cruis&#x27;n World&quot; and is the third entry in Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Cruis&#x27;n&quot; series. A port to the Nintendo 64 developed by Gratuitous Games was released in 2000, along with a Game Boy Color version developed by Crawfish Interactive.

== Gameplay ==

&quot;Cruis&#x27;n Exotica&quot; plays similarly to the previous games in the series, but it adds a PIN system to track progress like &quot;San Francisco Rush 2049&quot;. The levels take place in exotic locations in the universe, such as Las Vegas, Hong Kong, Atlantis, India, Alaska, The Amazon jungle with dinosaurs, Sahara, Tibet, Korea, Ireland, Holland and the surface of Mars. The game also allows a player to choose a driver visible onscreen during races, including a Martian, a baby, a clown, and a cowboy.

The Nintendo 64 version is similar to its arcade counterpart, with changes being made to race track layouts, lack of fully licensed vehicles, and more hidden vehicles.

== Reception ==
The home ports of the game were met with very mixed reception. GameRankings and Metacritic gave it a score of 55.87% and 43 out of 100 for the Nintendo 64 version, and 48% for the Game Boy Color version.

&quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; noted that the Nintendo 64 version &quot;runs smoothly, but suffers from a tremendous level of draw-in. This visual hitch can make it difficult to navigate the road, a problem that becomes particularly potent when racing friends in the multiplayer mode. Another concern is replay value: the first 10 minutes or so really hook you in, but when you get the hang of the control, the challenge disappears, and so does the fun&quot;.

Brad Shoemaker of GameSpot wrote about the Nintendo 64 version: &quot;The game&#x27;s graphics run quite smoothly on a platform that&#x27;s hardly renowned for smooth graphics. Unfortunately, this smoothness comes at a price - Exotica&#x27;s cars and tracks lack detail. The game looks decent, but it won&#x27;t blow your mind&quot;. Shoemaker also wrote that the game &quot;requires very little skill or finesse, but for the casual gamer who doesn&#x27;t want to commit lots of time to racing a track, that&#x27;s not really a bad thing&quot;.

Cory D. Lewis of IGN wrote the Nintendo 64 version featured nearly identical gameplay to its predecessors, saying &quot;that right there spells certain doom for this latest title. Once again we find only a few extra little touches to help differentiate this sequel as something &#x27;new&#x27; for gamers&quot;. Lewis wrote the game would become boring &quot;unless you are extremely young or easily impressed&quot;. Lewis praised the game&#x27;s framerate, but criticized its graphics, writing: &quot;Yuck. Yuck, yuck, yuck. We have one word to describe these visuals, and you&#x27;ve just heard it four times in a row&quot;. Lewis offered some praise for the game&#x27;s music, but criticized its sound effects, and compared the game to other Midway racing games such as &quot;Stunt Racer 64&quot; and &quot;San Francisco Rush 2049&quot;: &quot;Except that for what each of these games does well, Exotica simply does the complete opposite and truly disappoints in comparison&quot;.

Frank Provo of GameSpot wrote that the Game Boy Color version &quot;bears only a passing resemblance to its arcade and console counterparts&quot;. Provo criticized the game&#x27;s artificial intelligence and its limited sounds, including its &quot;bland&quot; engine effects and &quot;tinny rhythm and blues music&quot; and noted the game has &quot;a speedy frame rate and obstacle-filled backgrounds, albeit at the cost of an overall grainy veneer and two-tone vehicle sprites&quot;. Provo wrote despite the game&#x27;s flaws, there &quot;is never any doubt that you&#x27;re playing a Cruis&#x27;n game&quot;.

IGN&#x27;s Craig Harris, who reviewed the Game Boy Color version, wrote that &quot;as impressive as the game engine is, the game is just flat-out bland&quot;. Harris criticized the game&#x27;s artificial intelligence and its Cruis&#x27;n Freestyle mode, writing &quot;where&#x27;s the incentive to play the circuit mode if you can race &quot;all&quot; the tracks in a separate mode? That&#x27;s not exactly smart planning. […] the replay factor is destroyed simply by the inclusion of one single mode that really didn&#x27;t need to be there&quot;.

<text>Harold McEwen Ickes (; born September 4, 1939) is the former White House Deputy Chief of Staff for President Bill Clinton. He was a leading figure in the Clinton administration&#x27;s healthcare reform initiative.

Ickes is the son of Harold L. Ickes, who was Secretary of the Interior under Franklin D. Roosevelt.

== Background ==
Ickes was born in Baltimore, Maryland to Harold L. Ickes and Jane Dahlman.

Ickes is a graduate of Stanford University (1964, AB, Economics) and Columbia Law School. Ickes was a student civil rights activist in the 1960s and took part in Freedom Summer. He has practiced labor law for many years in New York City. He is founder and president emeritus of civic data firm Catalist.

He was the model for the &quot;Primary Colors&quot; character &quot;Howard Ferguson&quot;.

==Career==
Ickes has been active in Democratic politics for over forty years, working in the presidential campaigns of Eugene McCarthy, Birch Bayh, Morris Udall, Ted Kennedy and Jesse Jackson. In 1989, he was a senior advisor to David Dinkins&#x27;s successful campaign for mayor of New York City. Ickes is a registered lobbyist with the Ickes and Enright Group, a subsidiary of the Tiber Creek Group, a government relations firm in Washington, D.C.

Ickes is currently co-chair of Meyer, Suozzi, English &amp; Klein, P.C.’s Labor and Government Relations practice groups, and manages the firm’s Washington, D.C. office.

In his government relations practice, Mr. Ickes provides counsel and representation to business and union clients on legislative, governmental regulation and procurement matters. This includes providing strategic advice, planning and representation for business, labor, governmental and non-profit organizations.
Along with Basil Paterson, the former New York Secretary of State, State Senator, and the New York City Deputy Mayor for Labor Relations and Personnel, Mr. Ickes co-chairs the firm’s extensive labor practice, providing counsel to dozens of local and international unions in the health care, transportation, package delivery, hotel, construction, communications, distribution, manufacturing, retail food, and other industries in the private and public sectors.

In 2005, Ickes founded progressive data collection and voter file company Catalist. As of 2019, he serves on the board of directors of Catalist and as its president emeritus.

Martindale-Hubbell had given Ickes an &quot;AV Preeminent&quot; rating, which is the highest level of professional excellence among lawyers. When he became the political strategist for Hillary Clinton&#x27;s Democratic presidential nomination campaign in February 2008, Ickes was featured in a prominent article in the New York Times, detailing his approach to this political campaign and his &quot;sassy&quot; and &quot;dyspeptic&quot; demeanor.

In November 2009, Ickes joined New York Governor David Paterson&#x27;s election campaign as a senior adviser.

===Clinton Administration===
Ickes chaired Bill Clinton&#x27;s presidential campaign in New York in 1992, persuading state Democrats to stand by Clinton despite the controversy over Gennifer Flowers.

In the Clinton administration, Ickes served as Deputy Chief of Staff under Leon Panetta. In a lengthy New York Times profile of Ickes in 1997, Michael Lewis nicknamed Ickes &quot;the Garbage Man&quot; and noted that &#x27;Ickes has been caught up in so many of Clinton&#x27;s scandals and crises that he came to describe his function in the White House as &#x27;director of the sanitation department&#x27;.&#x27; When Erskine Bowles was appointed Chief of Staff after Clinton&#x27;s 1996 re-election, he requested to have input in choosing his subordinates, and so Ickes was dismissed from his position. It has also been suggested that Ickes resigned to take the fall for President Clinton, as Republican Senator Fred Thompson had the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee probe Clinton&#x27;s campaign finances.

In 2000, he was a senior advisor to Hillary Clinton&#x27;s Senate campaign. He now heads the Media Fund, a 527 committee. Following the 2004 elections, he was a contender against Howard Dean for the chairmanship of the Democratic National Committee (DNC).

Ickes worked as a political strategist for Hillary Clinton&#x27;s failed campaign in the 2008 presidential election. Ickes reportedly had a poor relationship with campaign strategist Mark Penn. This acrimony carried over from their days in President Bill Clinton&#x27;s administration.

===DNC rules and bylaws committee===
As a member of the DNC&#x27;s Rules Committee he was a proponent of adding other states besides Iowa and New Hampshire early on in the Presidential nominating calendar. He was unsuccessful in his promotion of Alabama as the second primary state, after New Hampshire, which lost to South Carolina. With all but one member of the Rules and Bylaws Commission, Ickes voted in August 2007 to strip Florida and Michigan of their delegates. Clinton won the vote in Florida after neither candidate campaigned there and voters were told that their vote would not count, in accordance with the earlier decision.

At a contentious meeting of the DNC Rules &amp; Bylaws Committee held at the Marriott Wardman Park Hotel in Washington, DC, on May 31, 2008, Ickes voted in favor of a compromise resolution to allow the Florida delegation to be seated with each delegate having one half vote giving presidential candidate Sen. Hillary Clinton (NY) 105 pledged delegates (52.5 votes), candidate Sen. Barack Obama (IL) 67 delegates (33.5 votes), and former Sen. John Edwards (NC) 13 delegates (6.5 votes); and against a resolution proposed by the Michigan Democratic Party to seat the Michigan delegation with 69 delegates (34.5 votes) pledged to Sen. Clinton and 59 delegates (29.5 votes) for Sen. Obama (IL) at the Democratic National Convention in Denver, CO, in August, 2008. (The net result was a gain of 87 delegate votes for Clinton and 63 for Obama.) In the interest of &quot;unifying our Party&quot; the Florida resolution was approved by a unanimous vote of 27–0, while the more controversial Michigan resolution passed by a vote of 19 to 8. The resolutions also provided that the delegates from both states should be slated under Rules 5, 6, 7, and 12, which outline the candidate&#x27;s right of approval.

&quot;This motion will hijack – hijack – remove four delegates won by Hillary Clinton,&quot; Ickes said in opposing the Michigan motion. &quot;This body of 30 individuals has decided that they&#x27;re going to substitute their judgment for 600,000 [Michigan] voters.&quot; Immediately prior to the vote on the motion, Ickes announced that candidate Clinton would reserve the right to appeal the Rules Committee&#x27;s approval of the Michigan resolution to the DNC Credentials Committee. The option of appeal and a convention fight was rendered moot, as Clinton suspended her campaign and endorsed Obama on June 7.

<text>Charles Frederick Gurney Masterman PC MP (24 October 1873 – 17 November 1927) was a British radical Liberal Party politician, intellectual and man of letters. He worked closely with such Liberal leaders as David Lloyd George and Winston Churchill in designing social welfare projects, including the National Insurance Act 1911. During the First World War, he played a central role in the main government propaganda agency.

== Early life ==
Masterman was the third son of Thomas William Masterman of Rotherfield Hall in Sussex. His older brothers were the future natural historian Arthur Masterman and the future bishop Howard Masterman.

On his mother’s side, Masterman was a grandson of William Brodie Gurney and a distant relative of Elizabeth Fry.

He was educated at Weymouth College and Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he was President of the Union, and joint Secretary of the Cambridge University Liberal Club from 1895 to 1896. At the university, he had two primary interests: social reform (influenced by Christian Socialism) and literature. His first published work was &quot;From the Abyss&quot;, a collection of articles he had written anonymously while living in the slums of south east London. These were highly impressionistic pieces and reflected his literary leanings. Following this, Masterman became a journalist and co-edited the &quot;English Review&quot; with Ford Madox Ford. In February 1900 he was elected a junior Fellow of Christ&#x27;s College. In 1901, he edited a collection of essays by eminent people of the day, entitled &quot;The Heart of the Empire: a discussion of Problems of Modern City Life in England&quot;. In 1905 he published &quot;In Peril of Change&quot;, a collection of his own essays. He also wrote a biography of the Reverend F. D. Maurice (&quot;Frederick Denison Maurice&quot;), published in 1907. In the years up to 1906, he established many of the literary friendships that would be important in his later role as head of British propaganda in the First World War.

== Political career ==
Masterman was an unsuccessful candidate at the 1903 Dulwich by-election, but in the Liberal Party landslide victory at the general election of 1906, he was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for West Ham North. 
In 1909, he published his best known book, &quot;The Condition of England&quot;, a survey of contemporary society with particular focus on the state of the working class.
Masterman worked closely with Liberal leaders Winston Churchill and David Lloyd George on the People&#x27;s Budget of 1909. By 1911, he was playing a major role in writing parts of the Finance Bill, the Development Bill, the Shop Hours Bill, and the Coal Mines Bill, and he was responsible for the passage through parliament of the National Insurance Act 1911.

He had a mediocre record as a candidate by losing more often than winning. He was re-elected in West Ham North in January 1910 and in December 1910. However, after the second election a petition was filed to unseat him on the grounds of an unlawful return of election expenses, and this proved successful.

In July 1911, Masterman was returned to Parliament at a by-election in the Bethnal Green South West constituency. He joined the Privy Council in 1912, and in 1914 obtained his most important position, an appointment to the Cabinet as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. However, the law at that time required him to recontest his seat in a by-election on joining the Cabinet. Masterman lost his own seat in February and then in May stood in a by-election at Ipswich, losing yet again. He resigned from the government as a result.

== Wartime propagandist ==
In the summer of 1914, Masterman strongly supported British entry into the First World War and was soon appointed as head of the War Propaganda Bureau (WPB), known as &quot;Wellington House.&quot; His Bureau enlisted the eminent writers John Buchan, H. G. Wells, and Arthur Conan Doyle, as well as the painters Francis Dodd and Paul Nash. Before its abolition in 1917, the Bureau published some 300 books and pamphlets in 21 languages, distributed over 4,000 propaganda photographs every week, and circulated maps, cartoons and lantern slides to the media.

Masterman also commissioned films about the war such as &quot;The Battle of the Somme&quot;, which appeared in , while the battle was still in progress, as a morale-booster. It received a generally favourable reception. &quot;The Times&quot; reported on 1916, &quot;Crowded audiences ... were interested and thrilled to have the realities of war brought so vividly before them, and if women had sometimes to shut their eyes to escape for a moment from the tragedy of the toll of battle which the film presents, opinion seems to be general that it was wise that the people at home should have this glimpse of what our soldiers are doing and daring and suffering in Picardy.&quot;

A major objective of his department was to encourage the United States to enter the war on the British and French side. Lecture tours and exhibitions of paintings were organised in the US, drawing on an extensive network of the most important and influential figures in the London arts scene, Masterman devising the most comprehensive arts patronage schemes ever to be supported in the country. It was subsumed into Buchan&#x27;s Department of Information. It became a template for the war art scheme in the Second World War, headed by Sir Kenneth Clark. Lloyd George demoted Masterman in February 1917; he now reported to Buchan. The agency was peremptorily closed as soon as the war ended, and neither Masterman nor Buchan received the usual public honours. However, Masterman followed Lloyd George in his Liberal party maneuvers after 1918.

Masterman played a crucial role in publicising reports of the Armenian genocide, in part to strengthen the moral case against the Ottoman Empire. For his role, Masterman has been the target of repeated Turkish allegations that he fabricated, or at least embellished, the events for propaganda purposes.

== Career after the war==
For the 1918 general election, Masterman returned to West Ham where he had sat for five years before the war. He contested the new seat of 
Stratford West Ham. However, his old boss, Lloyd George, chose to endorse his Unionist opponent, and he was badly beaten.

Back in private life, Masterman continued his high output of books and essays. In 1922, he published &quot;How England is Governed&quot;. In 1921, he supported the Manchester Liberals radical programme, adopted by the National Liberal Federation, which called for the establishment of a National Industrial Council, state supervision of trusts and combines, nationalisation of some monopolies as well as profit limitations.

For the 1922 general Election, Masterman decided to contest Clay Cross in Derbyshire. At the previous election in 1918, the Liberal candidate had been endorsed by the Coalition Government and won. He subsequently took the Coalition Liberal whip and was defending his seat as a National Liberal, with the support of Lloyd George. The local Liberal association wanted an opponent of the coalition to run as their candidate and managed to attract Masterman. He outpolled the sitting member by nearly two to one, but the seat was won by the Labour candidate.

After the election, there was discussion in Liberal circles, of Lloyd George and his National Liberals returning to the party. Masterman was concerned about such a move and talked about defecting to the Labour Party if that happened. Masterman&#x27;s good political relationship with the Manchester Liberals resulted in their inviting him to contest one of their constituencies, which he accepted. The Manchester Liberals won five seats at the 1923 general election, including Rusholme, where Masterman stood.

Following his election victory in 1923, Masterman revealed to his wife Lucy that he &quot;thought we were never going to (win) again&quot;. In August 1924, he led the opposition to a treaty, negotiated by the Labour government, which guaranteed a loan to the Soviet government. During the 1924 election campaign, Masterman publicly blamed Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald for the collapse of Liberal-Labour co-operation.

At the General election of 1924, Masterman was heavily defeated in Manchester Rusholme by the Unionist candidate Frank Boyd Merriman. The same fate befell almost all the Liberal members of parliament in England.

In 1925, he became the Parliamentary Correspondent for &quot;The Nation&quot;. Having initially expressed concerns about Lloyd George&#x27;s return to the Liberal Party, he acknowledged that it was again easier to get the party to adopt measures of social reform: &quot;When Lloyd George came back to the party, ideas came back to the party&quot;.

Lloyd George sponsored a number of reviews into areas of Liberal Party policy, and Masterman participated in those reviews, notably as part of the body that produced the policy document &quot;Coal and Power&quot;. He was also on the committee that ultimately produced &quot;Britain&#x27;s Industrial Future&quot;, known as &quot;The Yellow Book&quot;.
Masterman‘s health declined rapidly, hastened by drug and alcohol abuse. He died in November 1927 at Bowden House, Harrow, leaving an estate valued at only £452. His address at death was stated as 46, Gillingham Street, Eccleston Square, Westminster.

He was buried in St Giles&#x27; Church, Camberwell, where a memorial tablet in the church commemorates him, stating that he had lived there for ten years. There is another for his wife.

== Assessments ==
Religion was central to Masterman’s career, and he worked to revive the Gladstonian alliance between Liberalism and Nonconformity. He frequently used the language of prophecy—for which he had been inspired by Thomas Carlyle and other seers. Masterman had a long-standing influence as a champion of radical change. On one hand, he ridiculed anachronistic attachments to outmoded Victorian ideals and institutions. However, his own rhetoric was deeply rooted in high Victorian idealism. He proposed a wide-ranging program to assist the working class, such as labour exchanges, wage boards and free meals for schoolchildren. Historians have puzzled as to his ability to lose elections that had been prearranged for him. He had psychological problems, such as severe mood swings and mental health problems, and his public demeanour often struck observers as cynical and self-righteous. John Buchan described Masterman as &quot;one of the most brilliant, misunderstood, and tragically fated men of his time&quot;. 

== Personal life==
In 1908, Masterman married Lucy Blanche Lyttelton, poet,” and writer, later a politician, daughter of General Sir Neville Lyttelton. She was the author of &quot;A Book of Wild Things&quot; (1910), &quot;Poems&quot; (1913), and &quot;London from the Bus-top&quot; (1951); she also edited &quot;Mary Gladstone (Mrs Drew): her diaries and letters&quot; (1930). They had three children:

* Margaret Mary Masterman (4 May 1910 - 1 April 1986), a British linguist and philosopher most known for her pioneering work in the field of computational linguistics and especially machine translation. She founded the Cambridge Language Research Unit and was a founding Fellow of Lucy Cavendish College, Cambridge. Margaret was married to the distinguished Cambridge philosopher R.B. Braithwaite.
* Neville Charles Masterman (1912–2019), an academic historian at Swansea University. He served in the Second World War and was transferred to Bletchley Park where he learned Japanese to help with translation. Neville went to Westminster School and read Theology at Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge, his father&#x27;s alma mater. 
* Dorothy Hilda Masterman (1914–1981).

Lucy Masterman&#x27;s biography of her husband was published in 1939. The Masterman Papers are held at the Cadbury Research Library, University of Birmingham.

<text>Raja Ramanna (28 January 1925 – 24 September 2004) was an Indian nuclear physicist. He was the director of India&#x27;s nuclear program in the late 1960s and early 1970s, which culminated in Smiling Buddha, India&#x27;s first successful nuclear weapon test on 18 May 1974.

Ramanna obtained his bachelors in Physics at Madras University and PhD from King&#x27;s College, London. He joined the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research and later the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) to work on nuclear physics. Ramanna worked under Homi Jehangir Bhabha, whom he had met earlier in 1944. He joined the nuclear program in 1964, and later became the director of this program in 1967. Ramanna expanded and supervised scientific research on nuclear weapons and was in charge of the team of scientists at Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) that designed and carried out the testing of the first nuclear device in 1974. Ramanna was associated with India&#x27;s nuclear program for more than four decades, and also facilitated research for the Indian Armed Forces.

He served in various roles such as Secretary for Defence Research, Government of India (1978–81), Scientific Adviser to the Minister of Defence (1978–81), Director-general of Defence Research and Development Organisation (1978–82), Chairman of Atomic Energy Commission (1983–87) and Secretary of the Department of Atomic Energy (1983–87). He later became the Minister of state for defence in 1990. He served as a Member of Parliament, Rajya Sabha from 1997 to 2003. Towards the later part of his career, he advocated against nuclear proliferation and testing.

Ramanna was associated with various academic institutions. He was the founder-director of National Institute of Advanced Studies and served as the chairman of board of governors at IIT Bombay. He has been awarded multiple honorary doctorates by various universities. He was awarded the Padma Vibhushan, India&#x27;s second highest civilian decoration, in 1975. Ramanna died in Mumbai in 2004 at the age of 79.

== Early life and education ==
Raja Ramanna was born on 28 January 1925 to Rukmini and Ramanna in Tiptur, Princely State of Mysore, British India (now in Tumkur district, Karnataka, India). His father was working in the judicial department. Ramanna claimed to have been influenced by his mother&#x27;s sister Rajamma, who was a government teacher. He did his early schooling at Dalvoy School and Good Shepherd Convent in Mysore before moving to Bishop Cotton Boys&#x27; School in Bangalore. Ramanna was interested in music from a young age and began taking piano lessons at the age of six. He auditioned in front of the Maharaja of Mysore at the age of 12.

He later attended Madras Christian College, where he graduated with a BSc in physics from the University of Madras in 1945. Ramanna obtained his masters from Bombay University. In 1949, he completed his PhD in nuclear physics from King&#x27;s College in London on a scholarship from Tata Group.

== Career ==
=== Early career (1949-59) ===
Ramanna had met Homi J. Bhabha in 1944 and was inspired his work. In 1949, Ramanna joined Tata Institute of Fundamental Research to work under Bhabha. In 1952, he started working on the Indian nuclear programme at the Atomic Energy Establishment in Trombay (later renamed as Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC)). In 1957, the first research nuclear reactor &quot;Apsara&quot; became operational at BARC and Ramanna was part of the team working on the same. He was working on neutron emission studies and research on nuclear fission. In July 1958, then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru authorized &quot;Project Phoenix&quot; to produce weapon grade Plutonium. In 1957, Ramanna established a training school at BARC to facilitate training of scientists in nuclear physics.

=== Heading the nuclear programme (1960-69) ===
In the early 1960s, he was involved in learning and development of know-how to manufacture nuclear weapons. After Bhabha&#x27;s unexpected death in 1966, the design work on the atomic bomb proceeded under Ramanna, who took charge of the nuclear weapons technology research. When Indira Gandhi became the prime minister in 1966, the project for the design and manufacturing of the nuclear device proceeded secretly. The program employed 75 scientists with Ramanna heading the project and P. K. Iyengar serving as his deputy. Later, the weapons programme was directed towards the production of plutonium rather than uranium and in 1969, enough plutonium had been accumulated for the production of a single nuclear bomb. In 1968–69, a plutonium fueled fast breeder reactor named &quot;Purnima&quot; was established at BARC.

=== First nuclear test (1970-75) ===
In July 1970, physicist B. D. Nagchaudhuri was appointed as the scientific adviser to the Defense Minister and as Director of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). Nagchaudhuri and Ramanna worked together to recruit the team and set up the requirements necessary for a nuclear weapon test. In 1971, Homi Sethna succeeded Vikram Sarabhai as the chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, completing the leadership group. After India gained military and political initiative over Pakistan in the Indo-Pakistani war of 1971, the work on building a nuclear device continued with Ramanna being appointed as the chairman of BARC in 1972.

The hardware for the bomb began to be built in early 1972 and the Prime Minister authorized the development of a nuclear test device in September 1972. The nuclear test was planned for May 1974 with tight control being maintained on all aspects of the preparations of the test, which was conducted in extreme secrecy. The test was code named &quot;Smiling Buddha&quot; and called as a Peaceful Nuclear Explosive (PNE). A nuclear fission device was successfully detonated on 18 May 1974 at 8.05 IST. In 1975, Ramanna was honored with the &quot;Padma Vibhushan&quot;, India&#x27;s second highest civilian award.

=== Intermediate years (1975-87) ===
Ramanna served as Vice President of the Indian Academy of Sciences from 1977 to 1979 and as President of Indian National Science Academy in New Delhi from 1977 to 1978. Post the test, Indira Gandhi authorized preliminary work to commence on the development of a fusion boosted fission bomb. Differences in opinion arose between Sethna and Ramanna, which affected the progress of the program. In 1978, then Prime Minister Morarji Desai moved Ramanna from BARC to made him the secretary of defense research and scientific advisor to the Ministry of Defense. Later, he was also appointed as the Director General of DRDO. In the same year, then President of Iraq Saddam Hussein approached Ramanna for help in building a nuclear bomb when Ramanna visited Baghdad. Ramanna refused and returned to India.

With the return of Indira Gandhi in 1980, the nuclear program gained momentum and Ramanna was re-appointed as the director of BARC. She authorized Ramanna to prepare for further nuclear tests and two new shafts were constructed at the Pokhran test range in 1984. Ramanna pushed forward with a Uranium enrichment program and &quot;Dhruva&quot;, a new reactor with a capability to produce larger quantities of weapon grade material, was constructed. As a part of the nuclear programme, components for a nuclear fusion bomb were developed but no testing took place. In 1983, Ramanna was made as the secretary of Department of Atomic Energy. In 1984, he was made the chairman of Atomic Energy Commission, which he held for three years. In the same year, Ramanna represented the South Asian and Middle Eastern bloc at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Later, he served as the chairman of the Scientific Advisory Committee to the Director General of IAEA and as president of the 30th General Conference in 1986. In late 1985, a study group commissioned by the Prime Minister of India consisting of Ramanna and few others, outlined a plan for the production of 70 to 100 nuclear warheads and a strict no first use policy.

=== Later years (1988-2003) ===
In 1990, Ramanna was made Union minister of State for defence in the V. P. Singh administration, but the government collapsed a short while later. Later in his career, Ramanna advocated for strict policies to prevent nuclear proliferation and argued against further nuclear testing. He held various academic positions including the chairman of board of Governors at IIT Bombay, chairman of the governing council at Indian Institute of Science and founder director of National Institute of Advanced Studies, Bangalore. He was a nominated member of the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Indian Parliament from 1997 to 2003.

==Death==
Ramanna died on 23 September 2004 at the age of 79 due to gastronomical issues. Then President of India A. P. J. Abdul Kalam said, &quot;The passing away of Dr. Ramanna is a deep personal loss for me as he was a mentor, guide and teacher to me over the years. A towering and multi-faceted personality Dr. Ramanna was always keen to contribute to national development with a sense of mission in any capacity, which was evident in his role as a Union Minister and a Member of Parliament. For us in the science and technology community, he was always a source of inspiration and a guide.&quot; P. K. Iyengar wrote “more important legacy is his uncompromising belief in intellectual clarity and rational thinking in every facet of life, and his unwavering belief (which he inherited from Jawaharlal Nehru and Homi Bhabha) that the nation could progress only by embracing science and scientific thinking. The best way to honour his memory is not through eulogies, but by rededicating ourselves to his policies and belief.”

<text>Auto detailing is an activity that keeps the vehicle in its best possible condition, primarily cosmetic, as opposed to mechanical. Detailing is achieved by removing visible and invisible contaminants from the vehicle&#x27;s interior and polishing the exterior to its original blemish-free finish. The fundamental detail options include an exterior wash and wax, interior vacuuming, window cleaning, and surface polishing.

==Background==
Professional detailing services and the sale of products to both professionals and enthusiasts represent a significant commercial presence in places where automobiles are a major mode of transport.

The professional and home detailing industry in the United States experienced declining revenues from 2018 through 2022 due to the pandemic. Industry demand depends on the steady use of cars and motorists taking road trips. The industry experienced a 1.3% increase in 2023 to $14.6 billion, with profits reaching 16.1%.

In the United States, the market value during 2021 for car care products and services was estimated to be $3.12 billion. Consumers are expected to spend on vehicle maintenance and appearance at a compound annual growth rate of 3.5% from 2022 through 2030.

==Components of detailing==
Detailing is more than a cleaning process to make a vehicle look good; it is a systematic approach to help extend its life with methods and products that reduce damaging environmental elements such as dirt, sun, harsh winters, etc. Appropriate maintenance or restoration of vehicles to keep them looking outside and inside as if they came from an auto dealer&#x27;s showroom increase their resale value. Auto detailing requires knowledge of proper techniques and use of tools and products.

Detailing is generally divided into exterior and interior (or cabin). Some services and most products focus on these two areas.

===Exterior detailing=== 
Cleaning and either restoring or exceeding the original condition of the surface of the car&#x27;s finish (usually a paint with a glossy finish), chrome trim, windows, wheels, tires, and other visible components on a vehicle&#x27;s exterior. A wide array of detailing products and techniques are used based on the vehicle&#x27;s surface type and condition or the detailers&#x27; or customers&#x27; preference. Products include, but are not limited to, detergents, surfactants, acid-free degreasers (to break down dirt and soil), detail clay (to remove invisible micro-embedded surface contaminates), waxes, and silicone-and non-silicone-based dressings for plastic trim and tires. Buffing compounds and polishes to resurface and improve the reflectivity of the paint finish, as well as a variety of applicators, brushes, and drying towels. Additional external detail work may include removing deeper scratches or imperfections in the paintwork. A liquid polymer may also add a protective layer to modern clear-coat automobile paints, making them more resistant to scratches and environmental damage. Modern vehicles often use polycarbonate plastic instead of glass for headlights. Exposure to sunlight oxidizes the lenses, and detailing may include restoration to remove cloudiness and revive clarity for the headlights. External detailing may also involve degreasing and cleaning the engine bay, making used internal combustion vehicles look newer and better maintained.

===Interior detailing=== 
Detailing the interior involves thoroughly cleaning all surfaces and trim of the vehicle&#x27;s passenger cabin and trunk or cargo areas. Over the last fifty years, car interiors have included diverse materials, such as synthetic fiber carpeting and upholstery, vinyl, leather, natural fibers, carbon fiber composites, wood, rubber, plastics, etc. The variety of components in vehicle interiors necessitates various cleaning techniques and products. Vacuuming is standard, and upholstery stains may be removed using steam cleaning, liquid or foam chemicals, as well as brushes. Leather-upholstered seats require cleaning and conditioning to help maintain a supple surface and prevent cracking. Some nonporous surfaces may be polished during the detailing process.

==Benefits of detailing==
* A clean and shiny vehicle has a better appearance.
* Detailing can increase the value of a used vehicle.
* A clean interior can enhance the driving experience.

<text>Gurmit Ottawan s/o Chainchal Singh Virk (born 24 March 1965; ; ) is a Singaporean actor, comedian and host. He was prominently a full-time Mediacorp artiste from 1994 to 2014. He is best known for his role as the titular character Phua Chu Kang in &quot;Phua Chu Kang Pte Ltd&quot;, &quot;Phua Chu Kang Sdn Bhd&quot; and &quot;Phua Chu Kang The Movie&quot;, for which he won the Asian Television Awards prize for Best Performance by an Actor (Comedy) five times, from 1998 to 2001 and in 2003 for the former. From 2004 to 2005, he won the Highly Commended prize.

==Life==
Born in Singapore to a Sikh Indian (Punjabi) father, Chainchal Singh Virk and a mother of Chinese–Japanese descent, Gurmit was brought up as a Sikh, but converted to Christianity in 1985. Gurmit studied in Outram Secondary School during his years in secondary school.

Gurmit married Melissa Wong in 1995, whom is a Cantonese Chinese. They have three children, Gabrielle (born 1997), Elliot (born 2002) and Mikaela (born 2013). Gurmit is an alumnus of National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC) and held the rank of Cadet Inspector.

Gurmit is a native English speaker owing to his multiracial heritage and is also fluent in Malay as he took and learnt it as his Mother Tongue Language in both primary and secondary school instead of Mandarin Chinese, Tamil and other Indian languages including Telugu, Punjabi, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Gujarati, Sindhi, Urdu and Malayalam.

==Career==
Making his debut in the variety show named &quot;Live on 5&quot; in 1994, he then became the host and lead actor in the sketch comedy sitcom based on him known as &quot;Gurmit&#x27;s World&quot;, which was also debuted in 1994 for the 1st season after &quot;Live On 5&quot; Season 1 ended. The 2nd season of &quot;Gurmit&#x27;s World&quot;, which continued in 1995, Gurmit portrayed his &#x27;relatives&#x27; in a series of skits (unlike the first season where he played a wide assortment of mostly non-recurring characters), featured the first appearance of a character and general contractor named Phua Chu Kang, where he is one of the 6 characters that Gurmit was portraying in the 2nd season of &quot;Gurmit&#x27;s World&quot;. The Singlish-based spin-off sitcom based on Phua Chu Kang known as &quot;Phua Chu Kang Pte Ltd&quot; in 1997 made Gurmit a popular icon, not only in Singapore, but also in neighbouring countries (especially Malaysia). This factor leads to having another spin-off sitcom sequel based in Malaysia known as &quot;Phua Chu Kang Sdn Bhd&quot; (2009-2010).

In 2013, Gurmit was nominated for the Best Actor prize at the 1st Golden Wau Awards, aimed at promoting Chinese-language Malaysian films, for his role in &quot;Phua Chu Kang The Movie&quot; (2010).

In October 2014, the Madame Tussauds Singapore museum unveiled a wax figure of Phua Chu Kang.

In November 2014, Gurmit announced that he would leave the entertainment industry at the end of his full-time television career at Mediacorp - after exactly 20 years. Gurmit shared that he planned to spend more time with his family and would take on engagements on a more selective basis.

In August 2020, Phua Chu Kang was announced and signed as Shopee&#x27;s first Singaporean brand ambassador.

<text>The pot in poker refers to the sum of money that players wager during a single hand or game, according to the betting rules of the variant being played. It is likely that the word &quot;pot&quot; is related to or derived from the word &quot;jackpot&quot;.

At the conclusion of a hand, either by all but one player folding, or by showdown, the pot is won or shared by the player or players holding the winning cards. Sometimes a pot can be split between many players. This is particularly true in high-low games where not only the highest hand can win, but under appropriate conditions, the lowest hand will win a share of the pot.

See &quot;all in&quot; for more information about &quot;side pots&quot;.

<text>Anastacia Lyn Newkirk ( ; born September 17, 1968) is an American singer-songwriter. Her first two studio albums, &quot;Not That Kind&quot; (2000) and &quot;Freak of Nature&quot; (2001), achieved chart success with the single &quot;I&#x27;m Outta Love&quot;, &quot;Not That Kind&quot;, &quot;Paid My Dues&quot; and &quot;One Day In Your Life&quot;. Her third album, 2004&#x27;s &quot;Anastacia&quot;, while her duet with Eros Ramazzotti, &quot;I Belong to You (Il Ritmo della Passione)&quot;, was a success throughout Europe in 2006. After switching labels, she released her fourth studio album, &quot;Heavy Rotation&quot;, in 2008, followed in 2012 by the cover-album, &quot;It&#x27;s a Man&#x27;s World.&quot; She further released &quot;Resurrection&quot; (2014) and &quot;Evolution&quot; (2017) that included the single &quot;Caught in the Middle&quot;. In 2023, she released an album of German songs translated into English entitled &quot;Our Songs&quot;.

Singing was Anastacia&#x27;s third career-choice. She has disclosed several health issues, including Crohn&#x27;s disease and two instances of breast cancer. In recognition of her charitable efforts in breast cancer awareness, Anastacia became the second woman ever to receive the Humanitarian Award at the &quot;GQ&quot; Men of the Year Awards, in 2013.

== Early life ==
Anastacia Lyn Newkirk was born on September 17, 1968, in Chicago, Illinois; her father Robert Newkirk was a singer and actor, and her mother Diane Hurley was an actress on Broadway. She is of German and Irish descent and has an older sister and younger brother. When she was three years old, her parents split up and her father left the family. He would attempt to make contact with her and her siblings after later in life, but she remained estranged up until he died in 2005. The rest of the family moved to a one-bedroom apartment in New York City when Anastacia was a teenager. Anastacia was diagnosed with Crohn&#x27;s disease when she was thirteen. She enrolled at the Professional Children&#x27;s School in Manhattan. After graduation, she worked jobs at restaurants and hair salons while pursuing a career in the music industry.

== Career ==
Singing was Anastacia&#x27;s third potential career-choice, after considering archaeology and psychology.
She started her career as a dancer appearing on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Club MTV&quot;. 

She appeared in two music videos for American hip hop trio Salt-N-Pepa (&quot;Get Up Everybody (Get Up)&quot; in 1988 and &quot;Twist and Shout&quot; in 1989). In 1990, she started her musical career as a backing vocalist. She sang back-up vocals on pop star Tiffany&#x27;s &quot;New Inside&quot; album in 1990. In 1991, she featured in the music video for &quot;My Fallen Angel&quot; by Dominican singer Coro. In 1992, she gained her first break as a solo singer on BET&#x27;s television series &quot;ComicView&quot;, singing &quot;Get Here&quot;.

In 1993, she moved to Los Angeles to record the song &quot;One More Chance&quot; for the producer OG Pierce, but it brought no record deal. That same year, she recorded a collaboration with David Morales called &quot;Forever Luv&quot;. Throughout the mid-1990s producers claimed to be intrigued by her voice&#x27;s unusual tone, but Anastacia would be continuously told that &quot;her sound just didn&#x27;t quite fit into any category&quot;. In 1994, she sang back-up vocals on Jamie Foxx debut album &quot;Peep This&quot;, and in 1995, Anastacia sang back-up on Paula Abdul&#x27;s third studio album &quot;Head Over Heels&quot; and Paulina Rubio&#x27;s fourth album &quot;Planeta Paulina&quot;. By 1997, Anastacia had become a member of a band called &quot;The Kraze&quot; which she remained a part of until 1999. In 1997, she also sang in the background choir for Kurt Carr&#x27;s gospel vocal ensemble called The Kurt Carr Singers on their album &quot;No One Else&quot;. She had two duet songs with Cuban composer Omar Sosa, &quot;Mi Negra (1998), Tu Bombón&quot; and &quot;Tienes Un Solo&quot; (1999).

===1998–2001: &quot;Not That Kind&quot;===
In 1998, Anastacia was unemployed after being fired from a beauty salon for &quot;being too loud&quot; and she was disappointed after years of bad luck in the music industry. She was considering switching to a career in child psychology. Lisa Braude, who later became her manager, encouraged her to join MTV&#x27;s talent show &quot;The Cut&quot; in 1998. Anastacia made her way to be one of the ten finalists, performing her own composition entitled &quot;Not That Kind&quot;. Anastacia attracted the interest of record labels after appearing on &quot;The Cut&quot; hosted by rapper Lisa &quot;Left Eye&quot; Lopes . Even though she did not win, she had impressed Elton John and Michael Jackson as well as the show&#x27;s judges David Foster and Faith Evans. Anastacia signed a contract with Daylight Records, a custom label of Sony Music Entertainment&#x27;s Epic Records in March 1999.

Backed up by leading American producers and songwriters, she released her debut album, &quot;Not That Kind&quot; on June 13, 2000. The album reached the top ten in eight countries in Europe, United States and Asia. It sold four times platinum in Europe and triple platinum in Australia; her debut single &quot;I&#x27;m Outta Love&quot; was a global hit in 2000, topping the charts in Belgium, Australia and New Zealand, peaking at number two in France, Switzerland, Italy and Ireland as well as also reaching number six both in Germany and the UK. In the U.S., it was only a minor radio hit. The second single &quot;Not That Kind&quot; reached number 11 in the UK and became a top 10 hit in Italy. It also entered the top 20 in Switzerland and France. &quot;Cowboys &amp; Kisses&quot; was released as the third single from the album, charting in the top forty in some European countries. As the last promotional only single, &quot;Made for Lovin&#x27; You&quot; charted in the UK at number twenty-seven and in France at number seventy-two. While &quot;I&#x27;m Outta Love&quot; was a top ten hit on the Hot Dance Club Play chart in the United States, &quot;Not That Kind&quot; did not chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100; however by the end of the year Anastacia won World&#x27;s Best Selling New Female Pop Artist at the 2001 World Music Awards. The album had sold five million copies by 2006.

===2001–2006: &quot;Freak of Nature&quot;, breast cancer diagnosis, &quot;Anastacia&quot; and &quot;Pieces of a Dream&quot;===
Anastacia&#x27;s second album &quot;Freak of Nature&quot;, released in November 2001, achieved success in the UK where it went triple platinum as well as being a hit throughout continental Europe; however, it did not match the success of her international debut. The first single released was &quot;Paid My Dues&quot;. The song became an overall hit, in 2001, peaking in Denmark, Italy, Norway, and Switzerland, and reaching the top ten in several other mainland European countries. The second single, released in 2002, &quot;One Day in Your Life&quot;, reached number eleven in the UK and the top ten in many European countries. The next single &quot;Why&#x27;d You Lie to Me&quot; reached the top thirty in the UK. &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Be Alone&quot;, the fourth single, reached number twenty-eight on the Adult Contemporary chart in the U.S. The album was released in the United States in May 2002. Soon after she released a double disc edition featuring two bonus hits, remixes for three of the tracks on the album and two live tracks taken from a Japan gig that was performed on the September 13, 2002. &quot;People&quot; reviewed her album, writing &quot;Anastacia is most successful when she shifts gears on more reflective, folk-tinged pop-rock tunes such as &quot;Overdue Goodbye&quot; and &quot;How Come the World Won&#x27;t Stop&quot; on which her more nuanced vocals flow naturally.&quot;

Anastacia joined Celine Dion, Shakira, Cher, Mary J. Blige, Dixie Chicks, and Stevie Nicks for &quot;VH1 Divas Las Vegas&quot; in 2002 and she also contributed the song &quot;Love Is a Crime&quot; to the &quot;Chicago&quot; . The song peaked at number one on the Hot Dance Club Play chart and enjoyed moderate airplay on the Rhythmic/Dance format. Anastacia sang &quot;Boom&quot; the official song for the 2002 FIFA World Cup held in South Korea and Japan at the opening ceremony. &quot;Freak of Nature&quot; sold seven million copies.

In January 2003, Anastacia decided to have breast reduction because of back strain. From a routine mammogram for the surgery she discovered she had breast cancer. She immediately had surgery and radiotherapy. Anastacia subsequently established the Anastacia Fund to promote awareness of breast cancer among younger women. She has attributed her health scare as an inspiration for her third album. According to an interview she gave in 2005 on British music station The Box, her voice lost its power and she became unable to record, so she spent a long time writing and trying to create a sound with which she could finally be happy.

As stated on the Australian talk show &quot;Rove&quot; in 2004, Anastacia wanted to have more edge to her vocals as she felt something was missing from her previous work. She brought in rock instruments to create a new atmosphere. She felt that she needed more funkiness and pop but not too much edge. Out of this came a new sound she described as sprock—a combination of soul, pop, and rock. She named the album after herself. Anastacia entered record studios in September 2003 to begin recording the album, working with Glen Ballard, Dallas Austin, and David A. Stewart for release in 2004. On the album, Anastacia also collaborated with P.O.D. lead singer Sonny Sandoval on the socially conscious track &quot;I Do&quot;.

The first single, released in March, was &quot;Left Outside Alone&quot;, which saw a change in direction for Anastacia. It was one of the biggest songs of 2004 in Europe, reaching number one in Austria, Italy, Spain, and Switzerland; number two in Denmark, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, and Norway; and number three in the United Kingdom and Hungary. Overall the song remained at number one on the European &quot;Billboard&quot; singles chart for 15 weeks. The song also topped the Australian charts, Anastacia&#x27;s second number one in the country, where it went on to become the second-biggest-selling single of 2004.

&quot;Anastacia&quot; quickly became her most successful album to date, giving her a third consecutive triple platinum album in the UK and reaching the top of the national charts in Ireland, the Netherlands, Australia, Greece, Germany and other countries. Unlike her first two albums, which were released in her homeland of America, &quot;Anastacia&quot; was not, despite being scheduled for release on three occasions. &quot;Left Outside Alone&quot; was released twice, but failed to pick up heavy airplay. It only gained sporadic Adult Contemporary format airplay. Again, it sparked Rhythmic/Dance format airplay and the dance mix of &quot;Left Outside Alone&quot; peaked at number five on the Hot Dance Club Play chart. After the original version of &quot;Left Outside Alone&quot; failed to catch on after lukewarm promotion, especially on radio, the album was postponed and eventually cancelled after the release date of August 30, 2005, passed (only to be released digitally in the US years later). Anastacia released three further internationally successful singles; &quot;Sick and Tired&quot; (which gave her another number one in Spain and another UK top five single), &quot;Welcome to My Truth&quot; (her best-selling hit in Spain), and the ballad &quot;Heavy on My Heart&quot;, sales of which went towards the Anastacia Fund (her charitable organization providing research funding for breast cancer).A small batch of her self-titled album were released with a bonus DVD, poster and slip case. The DVD included a making-of documentary, footage from her 2002 Europe Promo Tour, and a photo gallery. From September 2004 to August 2005, Anastacia embarked on the Live at Last Tour. In 2005 the tour was renamed the Encore Tour. The tour would become the second most popular tour of 2005 behind only U2&#x27;s Vertigo Tour. In late 2005, she released her first greatest hits collection, called &quot;Pieces of a Dream&quot;, named after a track of the same name. The album spawned the hit singles &quot;Pieces of a Dream&quot;, which peaked at number one in Spain, and the duet with Eros Ramazzotti, &quot;I Belong to You (Il Ritmo della Passione)&quot;, which was a number 1 hit in Germany, Hungary, Italy and Switzerland and a hit throughout continental Europe. Even though Sony BMG required her to release this collection, Anastacia has said that she is happy now that it was created, as it was like a &quot;story book&quot;, or summary of the first six years of her career.
In 2006, she was recognized for worldwide sales of over 20 million copies of her first three albums, with &quot;Anastacia&quot; reaching eight million copies sold.

Not long after the release of &quot;I Belong to You (Il Ritmo Della Passione)&quot;, Anastacia released her first live DVD &quot;Live at Last&quot; on March 27, 2006, in Europe. The DVD contains footage from concerts in Berlin and Munich. It includes music videos to her four singles; &quot;Left Outside Alone&quot;, &quot;Everything Burns&quot;, &quot;Pieces of a Dream&quot;, and &quot;I Belong to You (Il Ritmo Della Passione)&quot;, five alternative videos (&quot;I Do&quot;, &quot;Rearview&quot;, &quot;Seasons Change&quot;, &quot;Underground Army&quot;, and &quot;Time&quot;) to songs from her self-titled album, and a documentary about the tour. Soon after the DVD release. Anastacia took a break from the music industry and began concentrating on her growing fashion line with German brand s.Oliver, launching a clothing collection called &quot;Anastacia by s. Oliver&quot; in 2006, which was sold at 550 stores worldwide. A limited-edition CD named &quot;Welcome to My Style&quot; was also available for free to customers who spent 60 euros or more on the clothes in November. A limited edition clothing line called &quot;Limited Luxury&quot; was also launched on November 2, 2007, which was designed together with Swarovski.

=== 2007–2013: &quot;Heavy Rotation&quot;, collaborations, &quot;It&#x27;s a Man&#x27;s World&quot; and second breast cancer ===

Anastacia performed at the memorial Concert for Diana on July 1, 2007, which would have been on Princess Diana&#x27;s forty-sixth birthday. This was one of her first major appearances since she took a break from the industry. She opened the medley section of the show and sang a rendition of &quot;Superstar&quot;, from Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;, with a gospel chorus behind her.
In August 2007, a video was posted on the &quot;Anastacia by S. Oliver&quot; web site. During the video, when Anastacia was asked about her future plans, she confirmed that she was working on an album as well as the clothing line. A specific month of release or title was not mentioned. In November 2007, her biography on the official Anastacia website was updated to say there would be an album in 2008, with a tour to follow. It was in this period also that Anastacia left Sony and moved to Mercury. During an interview for the UK breakfast show &quot;This Morning&quot;, the singer said that David Massey&#x27;s move from Sony to Mercury was key to her own label change because Massey had originally signed her and had been involved in all of her previous albums.

On July 24, Anastacia announced that her fourth studio album &quot;Heavy Rotation&quot; would be released in Europe and Asia on October 27, 2008 (and elsewhere in 2009). The album featured collaborations with producers Ne-Yo, The Heavyweights, Lester Mendez, J.R. Rotem, and Rodney Jerkins, departing from the pop rock sound of her previous material. The album&#x27;s first single, called &quot;I Can Feel You&quot;, began playing in some radio markets on August 25, 2008. The second single from &quot;Heavy Rotation&quot; was &quot;Absolutely Positively&quot;, later served as a promotional single only. The third official single from the album, &quot;Defeated&quot;, was released as a promotional single in Europe without a music video.

Her fourth studio album proved to be less successful; her singles failed to reach the top 40 in her most commercially successful country (UK). Anastacia remained positive, stating that other artists have faced the same problems while changing a record label, also blaming the worldwide economic crisis and the label&#x27;s decision to alter her sound from her own &quot;sprock&quot; sound of her previous record to a more &quot;urban feel&quot;. In later years Anastacia regretted the change of sound, citing personal problems that led to a creative sell-out. Regardless of the lack of success, the album was ranked number ten on &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s online &quot;Readers&#x27; Poll: 10 Best Albums of 2008&quot;. In 2009, the Women&#x27;s World Award presented Anastacia with the World Artist Award, recognizing the singer&#x27;s success and ongoing positive influence.

In June 2009, Anastacia began the Heavy Rotation Tour, her second tour throughout Europe to promote her fourth studio album. The tour was funded by the singer herself, not her label, and was well received by critics and fans alike. In November and December 2009 Anastacia, Chaka Khan and Lulu were headlining the &quot;Here Come the Girls&quot; a special Christmas concert that visited the United Kingdom only.

On December 7, 2009, Anastacia opened the annual &quot;Royal Variety Performance&quot; with Lulu and Chaka Khan, performing a rendition of Dan Hartman&#x27;s &quot;Relight My Fire&quot;. The tour sold out 24 shows. In October 2009, Anastacia released a collaborative single with British band Ben&#x27;s Brother entitled &quot;Stalemate&quot;, which was included on the band&#x27;s album &quot;Battling Giants&quot;.
During the winter of 2009, Anastacia once again joined Lulu for the Here Come the Girls Tour with Heather Small replacing Chaka Khan. In March 2010, Anastacia re-entered the recording studio. Around this time, she headlined several shows at Art on Ice in Zürich, the Hallenstadion and Lausanne. Her website stated: &quot;In a unique, groundbreaking combination of Olympic-level figure skating and smash hit pop, the music of Anastacia will soundtrack and seamlessly inspire a performance from some of the world&#x27;s best figure skaters, perfectly choreographed to complement her hits.&quot;During the summer of 2010 Anastacia became one of the main judges on British talent series &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Believing&quot;, a contest inspired by the musical comedy-drama &quot;Glee&quot;. During promotion for the reality show the singer stated that she had left Mercury Records and was without a label. Following &quot;Stalemate&quot;, Anastacia released &quot;Safety&quot;, a duet with Russian singer Dima Bilan, recorded in Los Angeles in May 2010. The song was performed live for the first time at the Muz-TV Music Awards Moscow in June 2010 and was released as a single in Russia in August 2010. On August 13, Anastacia announced that she would join Belgian singer Natalia Druyts for a joint tour, Natalia Meets Anastacia, for six arena shows performed at the Sportpaleis, Belgium. On August 17, Natalia and Anastacia recorded a collaborative single, &quot;Burning Star&quot;, which was released on September 17, 2010, to promote the concert series. On November 13, Anastacia became the first international singer to perform a concert in Northern Cyprus, which is occupied by Turkish forces. In February 2011, Anastacia was a guest at the Gigi D&#x27;Alessio concert at Radio City Music Hall in New York, performing as an opening act. On November 11, 2011, she performed in Madrid for the SAP Sapphire Conference.
In June 2012, Anastacia was confirmed as a guest judge for the ninth series of &quot;The X Factor UK&quot; at the Glasgow auditions alongside judges Louis Walsh, Gary Barlow and Tulisa Contostavlos. Her appearance on the show was highly praised saying that she had &quot;great chemistry&quot; with the others and had greatly impressed the producers, causing speculation that the singer would become the new fourth judge. However it was later revealed that she had to reject the judging offer due to contractual agreements for the Night of the Proms European winter tour as well of the release of her independent cover album.

During summer 2012, Anastacia toured throughout Europe. In July 2012, Anastacia announced on her Twitter page and Facebook fan page the release of a commercial single for car company Škoda Auto. She performed the song &quot;What Can We Do (Deeper Love)&quot; for the first time on July 10 in the Jazz Festival in Montreaux, Switzerland. She later released the video for the song through her social media pages. On September 17, it was announced that Anastacia had signed with the &quot;BMG Masters Model&quot; service of BMG Rights Management, along with the service&#x27;s primary German-based distributing partner, Rough Trade Distribution. Global distribution is expected to be achieved via a range of partnering labels and distribution services. The deal included the release of her next two albums, &quot;It&#x27;s a Man&#x27;s World&quot;, a collection of covers of songs by male rock artists released on November 9, 2012, followed by an album of original material.

Throughout November and December 2012 Anastacia took part in the annual Night of the Proms, a series of concerts held in Belgium, the Netherlands, and Germany which combine classical music with famous pop songs. On February 2, 2013, Anastacia tweeted that she would start writing for her next studio album of new material in the following week. In 2012, Anastacia starred as a fictionalized version of herself in the film &quot;All You Can Dream&quot;, directed by Valerio Zanoli. The film follows a young girl, who is guided by her guardian angel and favorite singer Anastacia. The film aimed to end bullying and was part of a project Let&#x27;s Make a Difference.

On February 27, 2013, Anastacia announced that she had cancelled her European tour because she was diagnosed with breast cancer for the second time and was undergoing treatment. Due to her decade-long charitable efforts in breast cancer awareness, Anastacia became only the second woman to be presented with the Humanitarian Award at the &quot;GQ&quot; Men of the Year Awards in 2013. Anastacia later confirmed via her Twitter account that she was writing and recording songs for her sixth studio album, including working with producers John Fields and Steve Diamond. She also stated it would mark a return to her &quot;sprock&quot; sound.

===2014–2020: &quot;Resurrection&quot;, &quot;Ultimate Collection&quot; and &quot;Evolution&quot;===

The album, entitled &quot;Resurrection&quot;, was released in May 2014 and was met with both critical and commercial success, giving the singer her sixth top ten Italian album and fifth top ten UK album. It also reached the top 5 of the Swiss and German charts and the top ten of the Dutch charts. Reviews were overwhelmingly positive, acknowledging a return to form for the singer as well as a creative resurgence. The lead single &quot;Stupid Little Things&quot; was released on April 4, 2014. The single was moderately successful, reaching the top ten in Belgium and top 20 in Italy. It was quickly met with a positive reaction from music critics, with MTV&#x27;s Brad Stern naming it one of the &quot;5 Must-Hear Pop Songs of the Week!&quot; and calling it a &quot;return to form&quot; for the &quot;pop princess and proof that Anastacia&#x27;s a true survivor&quot;, after her second battle with breast cancer. Anastacia was given the German Radio Regenbogen Award for Charity and Entertainment in April 2014.

In June 2014, Anastacia announced that due to a hernia procedure she would be unable to promote the album for a number of weeks. After returning to her promotional tour Anastacia played numerous festivals throughout Europe including headlining Manchester Pride which was heavily praised. She was also named as one of the judges on the German talent show &quot;Rising Star&quot;. In November 2014, Anastacia began her Resurrection Tour, her first tour to include Australia. The tour ended in September 2015 after 80 shows and was well received by fans and critics. During this period it was also announced that Anastacia had re-signed with her original label and that a compilation album would be released. In 2015, Anastacia released a jewelry collection with Tat 2 Designs, which consisted of bracelets, earrings and necklaces by Anastacia and designer Briana Erin.Anastacia&#x27;s &quot;Ultimate Collection&quot; was released in November 2015 and peaked in the top ten of the UK charts, giving the singer her 6th top ten album in Britain. During the same month Anastacia attended The Children For Peace Gala at Spazio Novecento in Rome where she received the special artist award. She then embarked on the Ultimate Collection Tour to promote the album. In August 2016, Anastacia became a contestant on the fourteenth series of the British television dance contest &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;, broadcast BBC One. Partnered with dancer Brendan Cole, the couple were voted in the bottom two to compete in the dance-off in the show&#x27;s second week. A doctor ruled Anastacia unable to compete from an injury sustained during the previous day&#x27;s performance, and instead the result was decided by saving the competitor with the higher number of audience votes, resulting in Melvin Odoom and his professional partner Janette Manrara&#x27;s elimination. The decision was controversial, resulting in complaints, and judge Bruno Tonioli reportedly threatened to quit. She was eliminated from the show in its sixth week, finishing in 10th place.

On February 17, 2016, &quot;Women&#x27;s Wear Daily&quot; announced that Anastacia teamed up with Blumarine for an eyewear collection. &quot;The Blumarine Eyewear by Anastacia&quot; capsule collection included three styles of sunglasses and two optical frames, and was released in April 2016. In June 2017, she supported Lionel Richie in some of the UK dates of his All the Hits Tour. The following July, she released a new single, &quot;Caught in the Middle&quot; which preceded her seventh studio album &quot;Evolution&quot;, released in September 2017. After the success of her album, she embarked on her Evolution Tour to promote the record. In 2018, she appeared on &quot;Ballando con le stelle&quot;, the Italian version of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, in a special one-off performance. In January 2019, it was announced that Anastacia would portray Killer Queen in the 2019 Dutch run of the &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; musical. She performed in Amsterdam and The Hague from December 6, 2019, to January 13, 2020, covering various Queen songs.

===2021–present: &quot;The Masked Singer&quot;, touring and &quot;Our Songs&quot;===

Anastacia was revealed as the winner of the third season of &quot;The Masked Singer Australia&quot; in October 2021, competing as the &quot;Vampire&quot; mask making her the first American singer to win the show. Singing cover songs on &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; reminded Anastacia of her early career when she was trying to establish herself as an artist. When speaking to Australian media outlets in 2021, she suggested that &quot;Evolution&quot; (2017) could be her last album and she might only release singles in the future.

In November 2021, Anastacia announced a concert tour, I&#x27;m Outta Lockdown – The 22nd Anniversary European Tour in 2022. The tour was initially planned for the 20th anniversary of the release of her debut single &quot;I&#x27;m Outta Love&quot; in 2020, but was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The tour ran from September to February 2023, and was well-received, with the &quot;Newcastle World&quot; writing: &quot;There&#x27;s no denying that Anastacia is a true performer, she knows how to work a crowd (she made hilarious commentary throughout the whole show), and has the type of stage presence that most performers would kill to have. However, what stuck with me the most wasn&#x27;t actually her vocal and performing talents, but rather her personality. As I mentioned earlier, she communicated with the crowd in a hilarious yet lovely manner – thanking everyone for their support throughout, making jokes and also sending positive messages surrounding mental health and kindness.&quot;.

On February 7, 2022, Anastacia released the single &quot;American Night&quot;, the theme song to the 2021 film &quot;American Night&quot; starring Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Paz Vega; Anastacia made a cameo appearance in the film.

The organization helps raise awareness about breast cancer and the importance of mammograms to women 35 and under. She has expressed concerns that women under 40 are not generally targeted for screenings, except in situations where there is a family history of breast cancer, and she wants to help make a difference after a mammogram helped save her own life.

Anastacia began selling her stage clothing on eBay, donating a portion to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation. The auctions were hosted by an eBay Trading Assistant and Certified Business Consultant. New listings began every Friday for 6 months.

<text>Pablo Montero (born Óscar Daniel Hernández Rodríguez August 23, 1974) is a Mexican singer and actor. Montero&#x27;s primary profession is singing, but he also acts regularly in telenovelas produced by Televisa productions in supporting roles. Montero is widely recognized and considered one of the most popular supporting actors in telenovelas.

== Personal life ==
From about 2000 to 2003, Montero had a relationship with Aracely Arámbula. In 2006, there were rumors about a possible romance with his costar in &quot;Duelo de Pasiones&quot;, Ludwika Paleta, who was married to Mexican actor Plutarco Haza. Montero and Paleta denied the rumors until a video was made public in which they were seen making out. This is said to have caused Ludwika Paleta&#x27;s separation from her husband. Paleta and Plutarco Haza later reconciled. On August 31, 2007, two days after Montero presented the nominees for the 2007 Latin Grammy Awards, Miami Police reported that they stopped Montero and a passenger after his white BMW SUV ran a red light. During the investigation, police reported discovering a clear bag that tested positive for cocaine, which Montero claimed as his.

However, in court the following month, Montero pleaded not guilty to cocaine possession, was found guilty, and was sentenced to probation, pending completion of a court mandated drug program. Montero was jailed in 2008 for violating the terms of his probation but was released on the condition that he complete a drug rehabilitation program. On February 20, 2009, Montero graduated from his drug treatment program.

He has a son, Daniel Hernandez Piedra, born 22 February 2006 and son Pablo Hernandez Vidal, born in 28.9.2007, with the actress Sandra Vidal and two daughters, Carolina Hernandez Van Wielink born 27.2 2012 and Daniela Hernandez Van Wielink born 24 May 2014 with ex-wife Carolina Van Wielink. In June 2010, his brother Oliver was murdered in an attempted robbery. On June 13, 2013, his brother Javier Hernández was also killed.

== Career ==

Known for his use of &quot;charro&quot; hats and black clothing during his concerts, he is a former teen idol and a paparazzi favorite in Mexico. He is also well known in the rest of Latin America, Australia, Europe, and the Hispanic community of the United States.

When Montero was a teenager, he had his first professional singing job as the lead singer of a group named &quot;Trébol&quot;, which had a number one hit titled &quot;Si tu Supieras&quot; (&quot;If You Knew&quot;).

Montero opted for a career as a solo artist shortly after this, struggling in local bars and clubs until he got his big break in 1999 when his album &quot;Donde Estas, Corazon?&quot; (&quot;Where Are You, My Love?&quot;) became the number one album on Mexico&#x27;s charts. The album&#x27;s success launched his image as a &quot;ranchera hunk&quot; and led to his acting debut in &quot;Vivo Por Elena&quot; (&quot;I Live for Elena&quot;), where he played a struggling young singer. This was followed by acting roles in &quot;Nunca te olvidaré&quot; (&quot;I Will Never Forget You&quot;), &quot;Abrázame muy fuerte&quot; (&quot;Hold me Tight&quot;), &quot;Rebeca&quot;, and &quot;Entre el Amor y el Odio&quot;.

His 2000 album, the self-titled &quot;Pablo Montero&quot; produced the number one hit &quot;Que Voy a Hacer sin Ti?&quot; (&quot;What am I Going to do Without You?&quot;). In 2001, Montero joined other artists invited to the White House South Lawn for a Cinco de Mayo fiesta, where he serenaded First Lady Laura Bush. &quot;Pablo Montero&quot; was followed by 2002&#x27;s &quot;Pidemelo Todo&quot; (&quot;Ask Me for Everything&quot;), which also included a number one hit single in &quot;Hay Otra en tu Lugar&quot; (&quot;There&#x27;s Another One in Your Place&quot;). Also in this latter album was the great hit to the soap opera &quot;Gata Salvaje&quot;, which was titled the same as the soap opera and reached the top ten list on the charts. Later this year he was honored in Australia for his acting as Martin in &quot;Rebeca&quot;. He has composed the songs for various shows including &quot;Olvidarte jamás&quot;, &quot;Gata Salvaje&quot;, &quot;La Revancha&quot;, &quot;Abrázame muy fuerte&quot;, &quot;Duelo de Pasiones&quot; and the controversial movie &quot;El Crimen del Padre Amaro&quot;.

Montero spent most of 2003 touring and preparing an album that was dedicated to legendary Mexican singer Javier Solís. This album hit the markets later in the year and was well received on a national level. He was involved in a scandal during 2003 because he had apparently not paid his employees during instances that he had not required them, such as when he was on tour, and then fired them when they demanded payment. He lost the case and was forced to pay them a settlement. In 2005, Montero signed a recording contract with Univision Records. In that year, he released his first album for Univision Records, &quot;A Toda Ley.&quot;

In 2005, he was featured in an ad campaign by clothing company Hanes with the slogan &quot;Mira quien tiene Hanes&quot; (&quot;Look who has Hanes on now.&quot;) He and Aracely Arámbula were both featured in the Spanish-language version of the campaign. In 2006, Montero starred in the Mexican soap opera &quot;Duelo de Pasiones&quot;, which aired on Univision during 2007. In 2008, Pablo acted in &quot;Fuego en le sangre&quot;, as Franco Reyes, one of the protagonists of the telenovela, with Eduardo Yáñez and Jorge Salinas. In 2010 he worked in Triunfo del Amor with Victoria Ruffo, Maite Perroni, William Levy, Osvaldo Rios and Daniela Romo.

In mid-2012, a return to the character of &quot;Coloso&quot; in Salvador Mejía it convened to join &quot;Qué bonito amor&quot; a new version of &quot;La hija del mariachi&quot;, being his second antagonistic role / main villain next to Jorge, Danna García, Malliany Marin and Juan Ferrara. In 2014, he acted in &quot;Mi corazón es tuyo&quot; as Diego. Pablo reunited once again with Jorge.

In 2014, he was a special guest acting in &quot;Lo imperdonable&quot; as Demetrio Silveria, Martin&#x27;s half brother, costarring with Ana Brenda Contreras and Iván Sánchez.

<doc id="1016517" wikidata="Q3269564" url="?curid=1016517" title="All Ceylon Tamil Congress">
<text>All Ceylon Tamil Congress (), is the oldest Tamil political party in Sri Lanka.

==History==
The ACTC was founded in 1944 by G.G. Ponnambalam. Ponnambalam asked for a 50-50 representation in parliament (50% for the majority Sinhalese, and 50% for &quot;all&quot; other ethnic groups). This was immediately rejected by the British Governor General Lord Soulbury as a &quot;mockery of democracy&quot;.

Due to the cooperation of the ACTC with the United National Party (UNP) a group led by S.J.V. Chelvanayakam broke away in 1949, forming the Ilankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi (ITAK), commonly known as Federal Party (FP). The ACTC was largely discredited when their ally the UNP moved away from bilingual and bicommunal policies towards a pro-Sinhalese stance. Thus the FP emerged as the major Tamil party in 1956.

In 1972 the ACTC and the FP formed the Tamil United Front, which later evolved into the Tamil United Liberation Front in 1976.

Ahead of the 2001 elections, ACTC joined the LTTE-backed Tamil National Alliance (TNA). In the 2004 elections the TNA won 6.9% of the popular vote and 22 out of the 225 seats in parliament.

The ACTC left the TNA in 2010 and subsequently joined a new political alliance, the Tamil National People&#x27;s Front.

==Leaders==
Leaders of this party:
* G. G. Ponnambalam (Snr.)
* Kumar Ponnambalam
* Dr. Nalliah Kumaraguruparan
* A. Vinayagamoorthy
* Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam

<doc id="1016523" wikidata="Q147885" url="?curid=1016523" title="Legionella pneumophila">
<text>Legionella pneumophila, the primary causative agent for Legionnaire&#x27;s disease, is an aerobic, pleomorphic, flagellated, non-spore-forming, Gram-negative bacterium. &quot;L. pneumophila&quot; is a intracellular parasite that preferentially infects soil amoebae and freshwater protozoa for replication. Due to &quot;L. pneumophila’s&quot; ability to thrive in water, it can grow in water filtration systems, leading to faucets, showers, and other fixtures. Aerosolized water droplets containing &quot;L. pneumophila&quot; originating from these fixtures may be inhaled by humans. Upon entry to the human respiratory tract, &quot;L. pneumophila&quot; is able to infect and reproduce within human alveolar macrophages. This causes the onset of Legionnaires&#x27; disease, also known as legionellosis. Infected humans may display symptoms such as fever, delirium, diarrhea, and decreased liver and kidney function. &quot;L. pneumophila&quot; infections can be diagnosed by a urine antigen test. The infections caused by the bacteria can be treated with fluoroquinolones and azithromycin antibiotics.

== Characterization ==
&quot;L. pneumophila&quot; is a coccobacillus. It is a Gram-negative, aerobic bacterium that is non-fermentative. It is oxidase- and catalase-positive. &quot;L. pneumophila&quot; colony morphology is gray-white with a textured, cut-glass appearance; it also requires cysteine and iron to thrive. It grows on buffered charcoal yeast extract agar as well as in moist environments, such as tap water, in &quot;opal-like&quot; colonies.

&quot;L. pneumophila&quot; is a intracellular bacterium. As an intracellular parasite, &quot;L. pneumophila&quot; has a preferential parasitic relationship with protozoa, which serve as a reservoir for the bacterium. Predators of protozoa, such as amoeba and ciliates, are natural hosts for &quot;L. pneumophila&quot; while humans are accidental hosts, as evidenced by there being only one reported case of &quot;L. pneumophila&quot; human-to-human transmission&quot;.&quot; Rather than through contagious spread, it infects the alveolar macrophages in human lungs when inhaled as aerosol.

A special characteristic allows for the microbe to thrive in extracellular environments, such as various freshwater environments. This is achieved through its two forms: transmissive and replicative. The transition between the two is activated by changes in the availability of metabolic/nutritional resources in its current environment. The transmissive form is assumed when the bacteria is infecting its host, while the replicative form follows to carry out proliferation.

===Cell membrane structure===
&quot;L. pneumophila&quot; is a Gram-negative bacterium. Its unique outer membrane composed of lipoproteins, phospholipids, and other proteins is the distinguishing feature of &quot;Legionella spp&quot;. &quot;Legionella spp.&quot; possess unique lipopolysaccharides (LPS) extending from the outer membrane leaflet of the outer cell membrane that play a role in pathogenicity and adhesion to a host cell. Lipopolysaccharides are the leading surface antigen of all &quot;Legionella&quot; species including &quot;L. pneumophila&quot;.

The bases for the somatic antigen specificity of this organism are located on the side chains of its cell wall. The chemical composition of these LPS side chains both with respect to components and arrangement of the different sugars, determines the nature of the somatic or O-antigenic determinants, which are important means of serologically classifying many Gram-negative bacteria. &quot;L. pneumophila&quot; exhibits distinct chemical characteristics in its LPS structure that distinguish it from other Gram-negative bacteria. The unique attributes are key factors in its serological identity and biological function.

== Ecology ==

&quot;L. pneumophila&quot; is able to live in a diverse range of environmental conditions, tolerating temperatures from 0°C-63 °C, a pH range of 5.0-8.5, and in dissolved oxygen concentrations of 0.2-15.0 mg/liter. However, it multiplies within a narrower temperature range of 25 °C to 42 °C. 

&quot;L. pneumophila&quot; is notably resistant to chlorine derivatives that are commonly used to control water borne pathogens. This resistance allows infiltration and persistence in water systems even when standard disinfectant processes are employed. Water supply networks are the main source of &quot;L. pneumophila&quot; contamination, with the microbe commonly found in places such as cooling towers, water systems of hospitals, hotels, and cruise ships. Of note, this bacterium can form and reside in biofilms within water system pipes, allowing it be aerosolized through fixtures such as faucets, showers, and sprinklers. Exposure to these aerosols can lead to infection in susceptible individuals. 

=== Biofilms ===

Biofilms are specialized, surface attachment communities that can consist of one or multiple microbes, ranging from bacteria, algae, and protozoa. These protective matrixes enable the microbe to live for extended periods of time in low-nutrient environments and in the presence of biocides. Multispecies biofilm on plumbing systems and in water distribution systems facilitate &quot;L. pneumophila&quot; growth due to the presence of freshwater protozoa. 

=== Environmental Protozoa ===

&quot;L. pneumophila&quot; is capable of infecting and multiplying within various species of free-living protists and amoebas. This bacterium can infect and survive within protozoa genera such as &quot;Acanthamoeba, Vermamoeba&quot;, and &quot;Naegleria&quot; which often feed on bacteria in biofilms&quot;.&quot; It is through their growth in environmental protozoa and amoeba that &quot;L. pneumophila&quot; may persist in man-made water systems. Cyst-forming protozoans allow &quot;L. pneumophila&quot; to survive harsh environmental conditions such as chlorine, UV, ozonisation, and thermal treatments.

== Metabolism ==
&quot;L. pneumophila&quot; uses glycolysis, the Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway, the pentose phosphate pathway (PP), and the citric acid cycle (TCA). While its genome contains genes for all these pathways, it lacks the genes encoding for the key enzymes type I–III fructose 1,6-bisphosphatases in gluconeogenesis. &quot;L. pneumophila&quot; can still perform gluconeogenesis, but uses alternative enzymes such as fructose 6-phosphate aldolase. The ED and PP pathways are the main pathways for glucose metabolism in this organism. Glucose is not the main source of energy, but does generate poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) through the ED pathway, which is a storage molecule converted to acetyl-CoA for use by the TCA cycle (Krebs cycle) when the microbe is nutrient deprived. Along with these pathways, serine was found to be a major nutrient due to its ability to be turned into pyruvate, which is an important intermediate in metabolic pathways in &quot;L. pneumophila&quot;. Glycerol is also used as a substrate, as indicated by transcriptome analysis.

While carbohydrates and complex polysaccharides are minimally metabolized, amino acids are the main carbon and energy source for &quot;L. pneumophila&quot;. Imported amino acids are used by &quot;L. pneumophila&quot; to generate energy through the TCA cycle (Krebs cycle) and as sources of carbon and nitrogen.

=== Nutrient acquisition ===
&quot;Legionella&quot; is auxotrophic for seven amino acids: cysteine, leucine, methionine, valine, threonine, isoleucine, and arginine. Inside the vacuole, nutrient availability is low; the high demand of amino acids is not covered by the transport of free amino acids found in the host cytoplasm. To improve the availability of amino acids, the parasite promotes the host mechanisms of proteasomal degradation. This generates an excess of free amino acids in the cytoplasm of &quot;L. pneumophila&quot;-infected cells that can be used for intravacuolar proliferation of the parasite. Amino acids are imported into the LCV through various amino acid transporters such as the neutral amino acid transporter B(0). Even though &quot;L. pneumophila&quot; primarily uses amino acids as a carbon source, the bacteria does contain multiple amylases, such as LamB which hydrolyzes polysaccharides into glucose monomers for metabolism.

Protein degradation to recycle amino acids and hydrolyzing polysaccharides are not the only methods by which &quot;L. pneumophila&quot; obtains carbon and energy sources from the host. Type II–secreted degradative enzymes may provide an additional strategy to generate carbon and energy sources. &quot;L. pneumophila&quot; is the only known intracellular pathogen to have a Type II Secretion System (secretome).

==Genomics==
There are 14 known serogroups of &quot;L. pneumophila,&quot; but serogroup 1 is most commonly the causative agent of Legionnaires’ disease. Three strains, &quot;L. pneumophila&quot; Philadelphia&quot;, L. pneumophila&quot; Paris&quot;, and L. pneumophila&quot; Lens, were isolated in 2004 which paved the way for understanding the molecular biology of the bacteria&quot;.&quot; Subspecies, which are commonly defined by geographical location, share about 80% of their genome with variation between strains that account for the difference in virulence between subspecies. The genome is relatively large of about 3.5 mega base pairs (mbp) which reflects a higher number of genes, corresponding with the ability of &quot;Legionella&quot; to adapt to different hosts and environments. There is a relatively high abundance genes encoding eukaryotic-like proteins (ELPs). ELPs are beneficial for mimicking the bacteria&#x27; eukaryotic hosts for pathogenicity. Other genes of &quot;L. pneumophila&quot; encode for &quot;Legionella&quot;-specific vacuoles, efflux transporters, ankyrin-repeat proteins, and many other virulence related characteristics. The &quot;bffA&quot; gene is associated with biofilm formation, and it is seen that strains without this gene form biofilms both quicker and thicker which aids in resistance to environmental stressors. In-depth comparative genome analysis using DNA arrays to study the gene content of 180 &quot;Legionella&quot; strains revealed high genomic plasticity and frequent horizontal gene transfer events. Horizontal gene transfer allows &quot;L. pneumophila&quot; to evolve at a rapid pace and commonly is associated with drug resistance. 

== Pathogenesis ==

&quot;L. pneumophila&quot; is able to invade and replicate within human alveolar macrophages. Internalization of the bacteria appears to occur through phagocytosis or coiling phagocytosis and is reliant on Dot/Icm type 4B secretion system (T4BSS). Once internalized, the Dot/Icm system begins secreting bacterial effector proteins that recruit host factors to the &quot;Legionella&quot; containing vacuole (LCV). This process prevents the LCV from fusing with the lysosomes that would otherwise degrade the bacteria. Vesicles of the host cell&#x27;s rough endoplasmic reticulum are attracted to the LCV, and these vacuoles supple the LCV with necessary lipids and proteins. LCV membrane integrity requires a steady supply of host lipids, such as cellular cholesterol and the cis-monounsaturated fatty acid, palmitoleic acid. &quot;L. pneumophila&quot; replication occurs within the LCV. Once nutrients are depleted, the bacteria gain flagella and cytoxicity. To exit the host cell, &quot;L. pneumophila&quot; lyses the LCV and resides in the cytoplasm. In the cytoplasm, &quot;L. pneumophila&quot; inhibit organelle and plasma membrane function and structure which ultimately leads to osmotic lysis of the host cell.

=== Virulence factors ===
&quot;L. pneumophila&quot; exhibits a unique lipopolysaccharide (LPS) structure that is highly hydrophobic due to its being densely packed with branched fatty acids, and elevated levels of &quot;O&quot;-acetyl and &quot;N&quot;-acetyl groups. This structure helps prevent interaction with a common LPS immune system co-receptor, CD14. There is also a correlation between an LPS with a high molecular-weight and the inhibition of phagosome-lysosome fusion. &quot;L. pneumophila&quot; produces pili of varying lengths. The two pili proteins: PilE and Prepilin peptidase (PilD) are responsible for the production of type IV pili and subsequently, intracellular proliferation. &quot;L. pneumophila&quot; possesses a singular, polar flagellum that is used for cell motility, adhesion, host invasion, and biofilm formation. The same regulators that control flagellation also control lysosome avoidance and cytotoxicity. The macrophage infectivity potentiator is another key component of host cell invasion and intracellular replication. MIP displays peptidyl–prolyl &quot;cis/trans&quot; isomerase (PPIase) activity which is crucial for survival within the macrophage, along with transmigration across the lung epithelial barrier.

Another key virulence factor of &quot;L. pneumophila&quot; is iron acquisition, the microbe utilizes two methods of iron uptake. Ferrous iron is collected through the use of a transport system involving an inner-membrane protein known as protein FeoB. Optimal intracellular infection is achieved in amoebae and macrophages via this transport system. The second form of uptake, involving ferric iron, is achieved through an iron chelator known as legiobactin. This is secreted by &quot;L. pneumophila&quot; when the microbes are being grown in a low iron chemically designed media.

=== &quot;Legionella&quot;-containing vacuole ===
For &quot;Legionella&quot; to survive within macrophages and protozoa, it must create a specialized compartment known as the &quot;Legionella&quot;-containing vacuole (LCV). Through the action of the Dot/Icm secretion system, the bacteria are able to prevent degradation by the normal endosomal trafficking pathway and instead replicate. Shortly after internalization, the bacteria specifically recruit endoplasmic reticulum-derived vesicles and mitochondria to the LCV while preventing the recruitment of endosomal markers such as Rab5a and Rab7a. Formation and maintenance of the vacuoles are crucial for pathogenesis; bacteria lacking the Dot/Icm secretion system are not pathogenic and cannot replicate within cells, while deletion of the Dot/Icm effector SdhA results in destabilization of the vacuolar membrane and no bacterial replication.

=== Detection and treatment ===
Antisera have been used both for slide agglutination studies and for direct detection of bacteria in tissues using immunofluorescence via fluorescent-labelled antibodies. Specific antibodies in patients can be determined by the indirect fluorescent antibody test. ELISA and microagglutination tests have also been successfully applied. A consistent method that has been used to detect the disease is the urine antigen test.

Effective antibiotic treatment for &quot;Legionella&quot; pneumonia includes fluoroquinolones (levofloxacin or moxifloxacin) or, alternately, azithromycin. There has been no significant difference found between using a fluoroquinolone or azithromycin to treat &quot;Legionella&quot; pneumonia. Combination treatments with rifampicin are being tested as a response to antibiotic resistance during mono-treatments, though its effectiveness remains uncertain.

These antibiotics work best because &quot;L. pneumophila&quot; is an intracellular pathogen&quot;.&quot; Levofloxacin and azithromycin have great intracellular activity and are able to penetrate into &quot;Legionella&quot;-infected cells. The Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends 5–10 days of treatment with levofloxacin or 3–5 days of treatment with azithromycin; however, patients that are immunocompromised or have a severe disease may require an extended course of treatment. Enzymes in the iron uptake pathway have been also suggested as important drug targets.

== Prevalence ==
&quot;L. pneumophila&quot; is the primary causative organism for Legionnaires disease, responsible for over 90% of cases within the United States. Roughly 2 out of 100,000 people are infected each year in the European Union (EU), with an infection rate of approximately 5 per 100,000 in Italy. The highest reported amount of cases in the US, EU, and Italy have been among men over the age of 50. &quot;L. pneumophila&quot; often infects individuals through poor quality water sources. Approximately 20% of reported Legionnaires disease cases come from healthcare, senior living, or travel facilities that have been exposed to water contaminated with &quot;L. pneumophila.&quot; There may also be an increased risk of contracting &quot;L. pneumophila&quot; from private wells, as they are often unregulated and not as rigorously disinfected as municipal water systems. Several large outbreaks of Legionnaire&#x27;s Disease have come from public hot tubs due to the temperature range of the water being ideal for the bacteria&#x27;s growth.

Legionnaires disease gained globally recognition after an outbreak in 1976 at a hotel in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The causative agent of the outbreak was &quot;L. pneumophila&quot;, which had contaminated the hotel&#x27;s air conditioning water supply, allowing the microbe to be dispersed within the hotel&#x27;s environment. A prominent mode of transmission for the disease is the inhalation of contaminated water aerosols. The outbreak resulted in a total of 182 reported cases and 29 deaths. This incident piloted research on the disease causing bacteria, as well as, preventative approaches to contamination.

More recently, two outbreaks of Legionnaires disease among travelers on two cruise ships between November 2022 and June 2024 were reported by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Hot tubs were identified as the likely source and the cruise lines modified their operation by increasing frequency of cleaning and hyperchlorination among other changes.

<text>Fort Albert (map reference ) is a tower fort nestling under the cliffs south-west of Fort Victoria on the Isle of Wight, England. It was also known as Cliff End Fort, named after the Northern extremity of Colwell Bay (Cliff&#x27;s End).

==History==
Fort Albert was one of the Royal Commission forts built in the 19th century as part of Lord Palmerston&#x27;s defences against the possibility of a French attack from Napoleon III. Designed to defend the Needles Passage, it was completed in 1856, after 4 years of construction, but like the American Third System forts it resembles in miniature, it would have suffered badly from rifled gunfire, so the Royal Commission enhanced it with batteries on the cliffs above. Even so, with the introduction of armoured ships, the fort became obsolete by 1858. In 1886 it was selected as one of the UK locations for the Brennan torpedo. After this, only small guns were mounted on the fort. It was closed to military use in 1957.

==Fort Albert today==

The fort is in private ownership and has been converted into private flats. There is no public access, not even to the cliff tops which overlook it. It is most easily viewed from the sea, or from Hurst Castle. The battery above is part of a chalet estate at Brambles Chine.

It has been a Grade II* Listed Building since 1994.

<text>Fort Victoria is a former military fort on the Isle of Wight, England (), built to guard the Solent. The earliest fort on the site was a coastal fort known as Sharpenode Bulwark built in 1545–1547 by Henry VIII, but these defences had fallen into disrepair by the 17th century. Fort Victoria was built in the 1850s. It was a brick-built triangular fort with two seaward batteries meeting at a right angle. It remained in use until 1962. Parts of the fort were subsequently demolished; areas of the fort that were preserved have become part of Fort Victoria Country Park.

==Location==
Fort Victoria is situated on Sconce Point west of Yarmouth. Its position overlooks the whole of the Needles Passage and approaches to Yarmouth, and is almost opposite Hurst Castle on the mainland. Around to the southwest lies Fort Albert.

==Earlier forts==
The earliest fort on the site was Sharpenode Bulwark (also Sharpnode or Sharpnore) which was constructed in 1545–1547 as part of Henry VIII&#x27;s coastal defences. It was about 700 metres east from an earlier fortification known as Worsley&#x27;s Tower. Sharpenode Bulwark was a square earthwork with two angle bastions. It fell into disrepair and was repaired or even replaced in 1587 by George Carey, Captain of the Island. This became known as Carey&#x27;s Sconce. The defences are said to have fallen into disrepair by 1623, and at the beginning of the 19th century only ruins remained.

==Fort Victoria==
Fort Victoria was built in the 1850s. It is a brick-built triangular fort with concrete gun-floors. It has two seaward batteries meeting at a right angle. It became a functioning part of the new batteries on the heights above. At the same time a pier was built to serve the fort. It effectively became a military barracks and storehouse until rearmed with more modern armament in the 1880s. During the First and Second World Wars the fort saw service as a landing point and for storage. Between the wars it saw little use with the royal engineers leaving in 1920. 

In the 1930s a proposal was made to run a car ferry between Fort Victoria and Keyhaven on the mainland. An act of parliament was obtained in 1936 but a lack of funds meant the proposal was abandoned in 1938.

At the start of World War II the fort was used as a training battery for coastal gunners and it was equipped with torpedo tubes mounted on the pier. After the war it was used as a National Service training station. Its military use came to an end in 1962.

What remains today is a fragment of the fort. The rear barracks blocks were demolished in 1969 to provide material for sea defences and Isle of Wight Council purchased what remained of the fort soon afterwards. The fort is now a Grade II Listed Building.

==Fort Victoria Country Park==

Today the fort is part of Fort Victoria Country Park which occupies 20 hectares of woodland and shore on the northwest coast of the Isle of Wight. The fort houses a number of attractions including a Reptilarium, Visitor Centre and a model railway.

The derelict pier can still be seen.

<text>Joseph Trumbull Stickney (June 20, 1874 – October 11, 1904) was an American classical scholar and poet.

==Biography==
He was born in Geneva and spent much of his early life in Europe. His father was Austin Stickney, A.B. Harvard 1852, professor of Latin at Trinity College, Hartford, and his mother was Harriet Champion Trumbull Stickney, of a Connecticut family descended from Gov. Jonathan Trumbull. He attended Harvard University from 1891, when he became editor of the &quot;Harvard Monthly&quot; and a member of Signet Society, to 1895, when he graduated magna cum laude. He then studied for seven years in Paris, taking a doctorate at the Sorbonne. He wrote there two dissertations, a Latin one on the Venetian humanist Ermolao Barbaro, and the other on &quot;Les Sentences dans la Poésie Grecque d&#x27;Homère à Euripide&quot;. The latter is openly indebted to &quot;The Birth of Tragedy&quot; and to Stickney&#x27;s study of the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot; under the tutelage of Sylvain Lévi. Stickney&#x27;s was the first American docteur ès lettres.

He then published a first book of verse &quot;Dramatic Verses&quot; (1902) and took a position as Instructor in Classics at Harvard (1903), but died in Cambridge of a brain tumor a year later. Stickney belongs to the number of Harvard poets (or the Harvard Pessimists) who died young, such as Thomas Parker Sanborn, George Cabot Lodge, Philip Henry Savage and Hugh McCulloch.

Stickney&#x27;s poem &quot;Song&quot; (which describes the earth ebullient in late spring, and the cuckoo singing &quot;not yet&quot;) is plagiarized in the Robert De Niro 2006 film &quot;The Good Shepherd&quot; by a Yale professor of English, acted by Michael Gambon as Dr. Fredericks, in a failed attempt to seduce the protagonist, portrayed by Matt Damon. Two of the poems of Stickney - &quot;Mnemosyne&quot;, and &quot;Eride, V&quot; are included in the volume of &quot;The Best Poems of the English Language&quot; compiled by Professor Harold Bloom and published in 2004, 100 years after the death of the poet.

<text>Golden Hill Fort was a defensible barracks at Freshwater, Isle of Wight, England, built as part of the Palmerston defences by the 1859 Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom to provide manpower to man the defences at the western end of the Isle of Wight, England. Built in hexagonal form, it accommodated 8 officers and 128 men, and had its own hospital. 

The garrison for the nearby Hatherwood Battery was held at the fort. In 1914 33 Company Royal Garrison Artillery was based at the Fort.

The Fort is a local landmark which is in a very prominent position overlooking much of the land looking south towards Afton Down. Whilst operational, the area was kept clear of vegetation to allow views out to the Solent. The name Golden Hill refers not to the spectacular golden display of flowering European gorse, but to an historic landowner named &quot;Gauden&quot;.

The building, which is a Grade 1 Listed Building, is now in private ownership and not open to the public. It was derelict and had not been used for many years, passing through numerous owners. Planning consent was granted in 2003 for conversion to residential use, with the listed building consent updated in 2007. Golden Hill Fort was converted into 18 dwellings by Golden Hill Homes between 2008 and 2011.

==Golden Hill Country Park==
The surrounding land is open to the public as a country park. The site is owned by the Isle of Wight Council and managed by Gift to Nature. It is an open grassland with areas of scrubby secondary woodland, featuring long views across Afton Down and Freshwater Bay, bridleways, viewpoints and a small car park. 

The soil types on which it stands are complex and support a wide range of plants, including the chalk-loving yellow-wort and dwarf thistle; and dyer&#x27;s greenweed, a feature of neutral soils and gorse which is associated with more acid soils. These attract a good range of butterflies. The habitats vary and there is a transition between open grassland, scrub and woodland.

<text>Calshot Castle is an artillery fort constructed by Henry VIII on the Calshot Spit, Hampshire, England, between 1539 and 1540. It formed part of the King&#x27;s Device programme to protect against invasion from France and the Holy Roman Empire and defend Southampton Water as it met the Solent. The castle had a keep at its centre, surrounded by a curtain wall and a moat. Initially heavily armed, it had a garrison of 16 men and as many as 36 artillery guns. The castle continued in use for many years, surviving the English Civil War intact and being extensively modernised in the 1770s. During the 19th century, Calshot Castle was used by the coastguard as a base for combating smuggling. In 1894, however, fresh fears of a French invasion led to it being brought back into use as an artillery fort: a large coastal battery was constructed alongside the older castle and a boom built across Southampton Water, controlled from the castle.

During the First World War, Calshot Castle was primarily used as a base for seaplanes, deployed on anti-submarine patrols in the English Channel; its guns were removed before the end of the war, probably for use in France. The air base, by then called RAF Calshot, grew in size during the inter-war years, hosting the Schneider Trophy air races. With the outbreak of the Second World War, Calshot was re-armed in the face of a possible German invasion. The station continued in use after the war, but as military seaplanes became obsolete, it was finally closed in 1961. After a short period of use by the coastguard, the castle was opened to the public by English Heritage in the 1980s. Restored to its pre-1914 appearance, the castle received 5,751 visitors in 2010. Historic England considers Calshot a &quot;well-preserved example&quot; of King Henry&#x27;s Device Forts.

==History==

===16th century===

====Construction====

Calshot Castle was built as a consequence of international tensions between England, France and the Holy Roman Empire in the final years of the reign of King Henry VIII. Traditionally the Crown had left coastal defences to local lords and communities, only taking a modest role in building and maintaining fortifications, and while France and the Empire remained in conflict, maritime raids were common but an actual invasion of England seemed unlikely. Modest defences based around simple blockhouses and towers existed in the south-west and along the Sussex coast, with a few more impressive works in the north of England, but in general the fortifications were limited in scale.

In 1533, Henry broke with Pope Paul III over the annulment of his long-standing marriage to Catherine of Aragon. Catherine was the aunt of Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor, who took the annulment as a personal insult. This resulted in France and the Empire declaring an alliance against Henry in 1538, and the Pope encouraging the two countries to attack England. An invasion of England appeared certain. In response, Henry issued an order, called a &quot;device&quot;, in 1539, giving instructions for the &quot;defence of the realm in time of invasion&quot; and the construction of forts along the English coastline.

Calshot Castle was designed to protect the Solent, a body of water that led from the English Channel to the naval base at Portsmouth and, through Southampton Water, to the important port of Southampton. The castle was one of four forts that William Fitzwilliam, the Lord High Admiral, and William Paulet decided to build to improve the defences along the Solent; the others were at East and West Cowes, and Hurst. Calshot was constructed on the narrow Calshot Spit, overlooking the deep-water channel running through into Southampton. Temporary earthwork defences and gun batteries were erected as an interim measure, but the castle itself was built quickly and finished by the end of 1540. It probably reused stone and lead from Bealieu and Netley abbeys, which had recently been closed during the Dissolution of the Monasteries.

The castle initially had a garrison of eight gunners, five soldiers and a lieutenant, under the command of a captain. In the late 1540s, it was heavily armed by the standards of the time, with 36 pieces of artillery. In the 1580s, the castle caught fire and the timber needed for the repairs required 127 trees to be sent from the New Forest. The work was carried out in 1584, prompted by the threat of a Spanish invasion, but by that time its garrison had shrunk to eight men.

===17th–19th centuries===

In the early 1600s, England was at peace with France and Spain and coastal defences received little attention. During the English Civil War of the 1640s, Calshot was held by Parliamentary forces against King Charles I, and protected with a 15-strong garrison at an annual cost of £107. Parliament considered the fortress important and kept it supplied with ammunition; unlike several other local forts, Parliament kept the castle operational, probably because of its ongoing role in defending Southampton Water. During the early 18th-century War of Spanish Succession it was equipped with up to 25 guns.

The castle was modernised in the 1770s with a new parapet around the central keep, alterations to the gun embrasures around the outer wall and an expansion of the gatehouse with an additional set of rooms for the castle&#x27;s captain. Reports in 1793, however, showed the castle&#x27;s guns to be in a poor condition and complained that the fortification was under the command of an infirm, elderly master-gunner. Improvements were probably made at the start of the Revolutionary Wars that year, but in 1809 the geographer James Playfair described the castle as merely &quot;a blockhouse with a garrison&quot;. In 1804, the castle was used to store munitions for the Sea Fencibles, fishing boats used as volunteer naval vessels to counter the threat of a French invasion. Seven guns were added to the castle&#x27;s arsenal to protect against French attack.

With the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, the government coastguard took control of the castle, using it as a base to combat smuggling, taking advantage of the water behind the Calshot Spit as a good location to position their waiting interception vessels. By the middle of the century, two officers and forty-two men were stationed there. By the 1850s, there was renewed military interest in the site, and several proposals were made to redevelop it to mount as many 32 artillery guns; the plans were not taken forward, and it was noted that the presence of the 16th-century stone keep would create dangerous splinters in the event of any enemy artillery fire landing there. In 1887, the Castle Yacht Club was established just beside the castle along the spit.

During the 1880s, concerns were raised that Southampton might be vulnerable to French attack using small ships armed with torpedoes. As a result, in 1894 the War Office took the castle back from the coastguard, building a boom across Southampton Water which was moved using three gunboats. The 16th-century castle was too small to host a gun battery to protect the boom, so a larger battery was built south of the old castle in 1895, armed with two and four 12-pounder (5.4 kg) quick-firing guns, supported by three searchlights mounted on the older castle walls. The boom was managed from two towers called &quot;dolphins&quot;, one just beside the castle and the other on the far side of the water, each with two 12-pounder quick-firing guns of their own, in turn supported by machine guns. The creation of these defences ultimately forced the nearby yacht club to move to the southern end of the spit.

===1900–45===
In the first years of the 20th century, Calshot Castle&#x27;s defensive role continued unchanged. The castle&#x27;s keep was redesigned in 1907 to allow it to house two of the castle&#x27;s quick-firing guns on its roof. A new, lighter &quot;ladder&quot; boom across Southampton Water was installed in 1907, but within two years this approach had been replaced by a plan to block Southampton Water with a boom made up of floating hulks. A 1910 plan proposed that the castle would be garrisoned in wartime by 10 officers and 154 men, 75 of whom would have to be housed nearby rather than in the fort itself; additional naval personnel would also have been needed to man the support vessels for the boom. A Royal Naval Air Station was built alongside the castle in 1913 to house twelve experimental seaplanes which were intended to support the Royal Naval fleet operating along the Channel. Calshot was particularly suitable for seaplanes, as the surrounding waters and coastline were relatively quiet and calm.

The First World War broke out in 1914, when military opinions on the utility of Calshot Castle had shifted considerably. The decision was taken to rely primarily on gun batteries at the two entrances to the Solent, rather than at Calshot and Southampton Water. At the start of conflict the boom was removed and replaced by anti-submarine nets further up the coast&#x27; two of Calshot&#x27;s guns were removed the following year to protect the new nets. The airbase was used for training purposes until 1916, when it took on anti-submarine patrols over the Channel, where the German raids had started to inflict critical damage. Almost 3,500 hours were flown by aircraft from Calshot that year, with over 3,500 being flown in 1917 and over 9,000 in just three months of 1918. Subordinate air stations were created in Bembridge, Newhaven, Polegate and Portland. A cabin was built on top of the keep to oversee air operations, the Castle Yacht Club was taken over for use as the officers&#x27; mess and the air station spread out across Calshot Spit, including occupying the 1895 battery. Calshot&#x27;s remaining guns were removed and probably dispatched to the front line in France.
During the inter-war years Calshot was taken over by the Royal Air Force, becoming RAF Calshot. It was used as the School for Naval Co-operation and Aerial Navigation from 1918 onwards and began housing the Seaplane Training Squadron in 1931. The 1895 battery was demolished to create additional space for the growing station, and a narrow-gauge railway constructed along the spit. Parts of the castle moat were concreted over to provide parking for planes. Calshot twice hosted the Schneider Trophy air races over the Solent, the last two in the sequence of popular international events designed to encourage the development of new, high-speed technology. The Empire Air Day events were also held at Calshot, attracting 1,000 visitors in 1935.

During the Second World War, Calshot Castle was initially defended by troops from the Hampshire Regiment, and a barge equipped with two anti-aircraft guns and a Bofors gun. Air-raid shelters were constructed in the castle&#x27;s moat, with five boats from the base taking part in the Dunkirk evacuation. The threat of German invasion increased, however, and the defences were expanded in 1940, with two 12-pounder quick firing guns placed on the keep&#x27;s roof, supported by searchlights. Two additional subordinate batteries, Bungalow and Stonepoint, were built the following year on the other side of Southampton Water and further south-west along the coast. The castle was not damaged during the war and by 1943 was placed on a &quot;care and maintenance&quot; basis, acting as a way station for passing aircraft.

===1945–21st century===
After the war, Calshot returned to duty as an active air base, housing two squadrons of Sunderland flying boats which took part in the Berlin airlift of 1948, before being passed across to Maintenance Command in 1953. The Southampton Harbour Board built a coastguard lookout tower at the castle in 1952, and the following year they began to construct a signal station tower on top of the keep, complete with radar and radio facilities, which opened in 1958. By then, military seaplanes had become obsolete, and the RAF station was finally closed in 1961.

Hampshire County Council leased the site from the Crown Estates in 1964; the castle itself passed into the guardianship of the state, and the hangars were used as an activity centre. A Royal National Lifeboat Institution station opened in 1971 alongside the castle, with a -tall replacement coastguard tower constructed two years later.

English Heritage took over management of the castle in 1983, and stripped back 20th-century additions to present it as it might have appeared in 1914, including demolishing the old signal station tower. The site remains open to visitors and received 5,751 visitors in 2010. The castle is protected under UK law as a Grade II* listed building and as a scheduled monument, but its coastal position means it is at risk from erosion or changing sea levels caused by climate change. The air station&#x27;s former hangars are still used as a recreation centre by Hampshire County Council.

==Architecture==
Calshot Castle is a three-storey, circular fortification, comprising a keep, gatehouse and curtain wall, predominantly constructed of ashlar Portland stone. When first built in the 16th century, it was designed to carry three tiers of artillery: two positioned on the second floor and the roof of the central keep, and the third in the outer curtain wall. Additional guns could have been placed on the roof of the gatehouse and on the first floor of the keep. Historic England considers it to form a &quot;well preserved example&quot; of the Device Forts.
The castle is surrounded by a water-filled, 16-sided moat, across, accessed over a 20th-century bridge into the gatehouse, an 18th-century design based on a simpler 16th-century original. The gatehouse was altered in 1896, with the addition of brick-built ancillary buildings to the southern end. It was probably intended to provide additional living space for the garrison. The gatehouse leads into what was originally a 16-sided courtyard with 15 gun embrasures round the curtain wall. The wall was lowered to its current height in the 1770s and a concrete building to house searchlights, dating from 1896, now stretches along the southern end of the castle.

In the centre of the castle is the keep, which has an external diameter of , an octagonal lower storey and circular walls on the upper levels. Originally this held accommodation for the captain and the garrison, but it was heavily redeveloped in the 19th and 20th centuries. Its exterior walls have eight recesses at ground level, originally used to store ammunition for the castle&#x27;s guns. The basement of the keep was redesigned in the 1890s, when electrical generators were installed, protected by a new, thicker, concrete ceiling. It may originally have been vaulted in stone in a similar style to nearby Hurst Castle.

The first floor of the keep has been restored to its early 20th-century appearance as a barracks room. The second floor was redeveloped in the late 19th century to form another barracks room, with its ceiling incorporating additional early 20th-century girders and concrete to support the gun battery above it. The roof of the keep has two 12-pounder gun mounts with their original gun-lockers; there is a 12-pounder gun on display originally used on a Royal Naval vessel. The keep&#x27;s roof would originally have been flat, with crenellations for artillery, but both the roof and crenellations were removed in the 1770s.

<doc id="1016556" wikidata="Q1394636" url="?curid=1016556" title="Induced seismicity">
<text>Induced seismicity is typically earthquakes and tremors that are caused by human activity that alters the stresses and strains on Earth&#x27;s crust. Most induced seismicity is of a low magnitude. A few sites regularly have larger quakes, such as The Geysers geothermal plant in California which averaged two M4 events and 15 M3 events every year from 2004 to 2009. The Human-Induced Earthquake Database (&quot;HiQuake&quot;) documents all reported cases of induced seismicity proposed on scientific grounds and is the most complete compilation of its kind.

Results of ongoing multi-year research on induced earthquakes by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) published in 2015 suggested that most of the significant earthquakes in Oklahoma, such as the 1952 magnitude 5.7 El Reno earthquake may have been induced by deep injection of wastewater by the oil industry. A huge number of seismic events in oil and gas extraction states like Oklahoma is caused by increasing the volume of wastewater injection that is generated as part of the extraction process. &quot;Earthquake rates have recently increased markedly in multiple areas of the Central and Eastern United States (CEUS), especially since 2010, and scientific studies have linked the majority of this increased activity to wastewater injection in deep disposal wells.&quot;

Induced seismicity can also be caused by the injection of carbon dioxide as the storage step of carbon capture and storage, which aims to sequester carbon dioxide captured from fossil fuel production or other sources in Earth&#x27;s crust as a means of climate change mitigation. This effect has been observed in Oklahoma and Saskatchewan. Though safe practices and existing technologies can be utilized to reduce the risk of induced seismicity due to injection of carbon dioxide, the risk is still significant if the storage is large in scale. The consequences of the induced seismicity could disrupt pre-existing faults in the Earth&#x27;s crust as well as compromise the seal integrity of the storage locations.

The seismic hazard from induced seismicity can be assessed using similar techniques as for natural seismicity, although accounting for non-stationary seismicity. It appears that earthquake shaking from induced earthquakes may be similar to that observed in natural tectonic earthquakes, or may have higher shaking at shorter distances. This means that ground-motion models derived from recordings of natural earthquakes, which are often more numerous in strong-motion databases than data from induced earthquakes, may be used with minor adjustments. Subsequently, a risk assessment can be performed, taking into account the increased seismic hazard and the vulnerability of the exposed elements at risk (e.g. local population and the building stock). Finally, the risk can, theoretically at least, be mitigated, either through reductions to the hazard or a reduction to the exposure or the vulnerability.

== Causes ==
There are many ways in which induced seismicity has been seen to occur. In the 2010s, some energy technologies that inject or extract fluid from the Earth, such as oil and gas extraction and geothermal energy development, have been found or suspected to cause seismic events. Some energy technologies also produce wastes that may be managed through disposal or storage by injection deep into the ground. For example, waste water from oil and gas production and carbon dioxide from a variety of industrial processes may be managed through underground injection.

=== Artificial lakes ===
The column of water in a large and deep artificial lake alters in-situ stress along an existing fault or fracture. In these reservoirs, the weight of the water column can significantly change the stress on an underlying fault or fracture by increasing the total stress through direct loading, or decreasing the effective stress through the increased pore water pressure. This significant change in stress can lead to sudden movement along the fault or fracture, resulting in an earthquake. Reservoir-induced seismic events can be relatively large compared to other forms of induced seismicity. Though understanding of reservoir-induced seismic activity is very limited, it has been noted that seismicity appears to occur on dams with heights larger than . The extra water pressure created by large reservoirs is the most accepted explanation for the seismic activity. When the reservoirs are filled or drained, induced seismicity can occur immediately or with a small time lag.

The first case of reservoir-induced seismicity occurred in 1932 in Algeria&#x27;s Oued Fodda Dam.

The 6.3 magnitude 1967 Koynanagar earthquake occurred in Maharashtra, India with its epicenter, fore- and aftershocks all located near or under the Koyna Dam reservoir. 180 people died and 1,500 were left injured. The effects of the earthquake were felt away in Bombay with tremors and power outages.

During the beginnings of the Vajont Dam in Italy, there were seismic shocks recorded during its initial fill. After a landslide almost filled the reservoir in 1963, causing a massive flooding and around 2,000 deaths, it was drained and consequently seismic activity was almost non-existent.

On August 1, 1975, a magnitude 6.1 earthquake at Oroville, California, was attributed to seismicity from a large earth-fill dam and reservoir recently constructed and filled.

The filling of the Katse Dam in Lesotho, and the Nurek Dam in Tajikistan is an example. In Zambia, Kariba Lake may have provoked similar effects.

The 2008 Sichuan earthquake, which caused approximately 68,000 deaths, is another possible example. An article in &quot;Science&quot; suggested that the construction and filling of the Zipingpu Dam may have triggered the earthquake.

Some experts worry that the Three Gorges Dam in China may cause an increase in the frequency and intensity of earthquakes.

=== Mining ===
Mining affects the stress state of the surrounding rock mass, often causing observable deformation and seismic activity. A small portion of mining-induced events are associated with damage to mine workings and pose a risk to mine workers. These events are known as rock bursts in hard rock mining, or as bumps in underground coal mining. A mine&#x27;s propensity to burst or bump depends primarily on depth, mining method, extraction sequence and geometry, and the material properties of the surrounding rock. Many underground hardrock mines operate seismic monitoring networks in order to manage bursting risks, and guide mining practices.

Seismic networks have recorded a variety of mining-related seismic sources including:

* Shear slip events (similar to tectonic earthquakes) which are thought to have been triggered by mining activity. Notable examples include the 1980 Bełchatów earthquake and the 2014 Orkney earthquake.
* Implosional events associated with mine collapses. The 2007 Crandall Canyon mine collapse and the Solvay Mine Collapse are examples of these.
* Explosions associated with routine mining practices, such as drilling and blasting, and unintended explosions such as the Sago mine Disaster. Explosions are generally not considered &quot;induced&quot; events since they are caused entirely by chemical payloads. Most earthquake monitoring agencies take careful measures to identify explosions and exclude them from earthquake catalogs.
*Fracture formation near the surface of excavations, which are usually small magnitude events only detected by dense in-mine networks.
*Slope failures, the largest example being the Bingham Canyon Landslide.

=== Waste disposal wells ===

Injecting liquids into waste disposal wells, most commonly in disposing of produced water from oil and natural gas wells, has been known to cause earthquakes. This high-saline water is usually pumped into salt water disposal (SWD) wells. The resulting increase in subsurface pore pressure can trigger movement along faults, resulting in earthquakes.

One of the first known examples was from the Rocky Mountain Arsenal, northeast of Denver. In 1961, waste water was injected into deep strata, and this was later found to have caused a series of earthquakes.

The 2011 Oklahoma earthquake near Prague, of magnitude 5.8, occurred after 20 years of injecting waste water into porous deep formations at increasing pressures and saturation. On September 3, 2016, an even stronger earthquake with a magnitude of 5.8 occurred near Pawnee, Oklahoma, followed by nine aftershocks between magnitudes 2.6 and 3.6 within hours. Tremors were felt as far away as Memphis, Tennessee, and Gilbert, Arizona. Mary Fallin, the Oklahoma governor, declared a local emergency and shutdown orders for local disposal wells were ordered by the Oklahoma Corporation Commission. Results of ongoing multi-year research on induced earthquakes by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) published in 2015 suggested that most of the significant earthquakes in Oklahoma, such as the 1952 magnitude 5.5 El Reno earthquake may have been induced by deep injection of waste water by the oil industry. Prior to April 2015 however, the Oklahoma Geological Survey&#x27;s position was that the quake was most likely due to natural causes and was not triggered by waste injection. This was one of many earthquakes which have affected the Oklahoma region.

Since 2009, earthquakes have become hundreds of times more common in Oklahoma with magnitude 3 events increasing from 1 or 2 per year to 1 or 2 per day. On April 21, 2015, the Oklahoma Geological Survey released a statement reversing its stance on induced earthquakes in Oklahoma: &quot;The OGS considers it very likely that the majority of recent earthquakes, particularly those in central and north-central Oklahoma, are triggered by the injection of produced water in disposal wells.&quot;

=== Hydrocarbon extraction and storage ===
Large-scale fossil fuel extraction can generate earthquakes. Induced seismicity can be also related to underground gas storage operations. The 2013 September–October seismic sequence occurred 21 km off the coast of the Valencia Gulf (Spain) is probably the best known case of induced seismicity related to Underground Gas Storage operations (the Castor Project). In September 2013, after the injection operations started, the Spanish seismic network recorded a sudden increase of seismicity. More than 1,000 events with magnitudes () between 0.7 and 4.3 (the largest earthquake ever associated with gas storage operations) and located close the injection platform were recorded in about 40 days. Due to the significant population concern the Spanish Government halted the operations. By the end of 2014, the Spanish government definitively terminated the concession of the UGS plant. Since January 2015 about 20 people who took part in the transaction and approval of the Castor Project were indicted.

=== Groundwater extraction ===
The changes in crustal stress patterns caused by the large scale extraction of groundwater has been shown to trigger earthquakes, as in the case of the 2011 Lorca earthquake.

=== Geothermal energy ===
Enhanced geothermal systems (EGS), a new type of geothermal power technology that does not require natural convective hydrothermal resources, are known to be associated with induced seismicity. EGS involves pumping fluids at pressure to enhance or create permeability through the use of hydraulic fracturing techniques. Hot dry rock (HDR) EGS actively creates geothermal resources through hydraulic stimulation. Depending on the rock properties, and on injection pressures and fluid volume, the reservoir rock may respond with tensile failure, as is common in the oil and gas industry, or with shear failure of the rock&#x27;s existing joint set, as is thought to be the main mechanism of reservoir growth in EGS efforts.

HDR and EGS systems are currently being developed and tested in Soultz-sous-Forêts (France), Desert Peak and the Geysers (U.S.), Landau (Germany), and Paralana and Cooper Basin (Australia). Induced seismicity events at the Geysers geothermal field in California has been strongly correlated with injection data. The test site at Basel, Switzerland, has been shut down due to induced seismic events. In November 2017 a Mw 5.5 struck the city of Pohang (South Korea) injuring several people and causing extensive damage. The proximity of the seismic sequence to an EGS site, where stimulation operations had taken place only a few months before the earthquake, raised the possibility that this earthquake had been anthropogenic. According to two different studies it seems plausible that the Pohang earthquake was induced by EGS operations.

Researchers at MIT believe that seismicity associated with hydraulic stimulation can be mitigated and controlled through predictive siting and other techniques. With appropriate management, the number and magnitude of induced seismic events can be decreased, significantly reducing the probability of a damaging seismic event.

Induced seismicity in Basel led to suspension of its HDR project. A seismic hazard evaluation was then conducted, which resulted in the cancellation of the project in December 2009.

=== Hydraulic fracturing ===
Hydraulic fracturing is a technique in which high-pressure fluid is injected into the low-permeable reservoir rocks in order to induce fractures to increase hydrocarbon production. This process is generally associated with seismic events that are too small to be felt at the surface (with moment magnitudes ranging from −3 to 1), although larger magnitude events are not excluded. For example, several cases of larger magnitude events (M &gt; 4) have been recorded in Canada in the unconventional resources of Alberta and British Columbia.

=== Carbon capture and storage ===

==== Risk analysis ====
Operation of technologies involving long-term geologic storage of waste fluids have been shown to induce seismic activity in nearby areas, and correlation of periods of seismic dormancy with minima in injection volumes and pressures has even been demonstrated for fracking wastewater injection in Youngstown, Ohio. Of particular concern to the viability of carbon dioxide storage from coal-fired power plants and similar endeavors is that the scale of intended CCS projects is much larger in both injection rate and total injection volume than any current or past operation that has already been shown to induce seismicity. As such, extensive modeling must be done of future injection sites in order to assess the risk potential of CCS operations, particularly in relation to the effect of long-term carbon dioxide storage on shale caprock integrity, as the potential for fluid leaks to the surface might be quite high for moderate earthquakes. However, the potential of CCS to induce large earthquakes and CO2 leakage remains a controversial issue.,

==== Monitoring ====
Since geological sequestration of carbon dioxide has the potential to induce seismicity, researchers have developed methods to monitor and model the risk of injection-induced seismicity in order to manage better the risks associated with this phenomenon. Monitoring can be conducted with measurements from an instrument such as a geophone to measure the movement of the ground. Generally a network of instruments is used around the site of injection, although many current carbon dioxide injection sites use no monitoring devices. Modelling is an important technique for assessing the potential for induced seismicity and two primary models are used: Physical and numerical. A physical model uses measurements from the early stages of a project to forecast how the project will behave once more carbon dioxide is injected. A numerical model, on the other hand, uses numerical methods to simulate the physics of what is happening within the reservoir. Both modelling and monitoring are useful tools whereby to quantify, understand better and mitigate the risks associated with injection-induced seismicity.

==== Failure mechanisms due to fluid injection ====
To assess induced seismicity risks associated with carbon storage, one must understand the mechanisms behind rock failure. The Mohr-Coulomb failure criteria describe shear failure on a fault plane. Most generally, failure will happen on existing faults due to several mechanisms: an increase in shear stress, a decrease in normal stress or a pore pressure increase. The injection of supercritical will change the stresses in the reservoir as it expands, causing potential failure on nearby faults. Injection of fluids also increases the pore pressures in the reservoir, triggering slip on existing rock weakness planes. The latter is the most common cause of induced seismicity due to fluid injection.

The Mohr-Coulomb failure criteria state that

formula_1

with formula_2 the critical shear stress leading to failure on a fault, formula_3 the cohesive strength along the fault, formula_4 the normal stress, formula_5 the friction coefficient on the fault plane and formula_6 the pore pressure within the fault. When formula_2 is attained, shear failure occurs and an earthquake can be felt. This process can be represented graphically on a Mohr&#x27;s circle.

==== Comparison of risks due to CCS versus other injection methods ====
While there is risk of induced seismicity associated with carbon capture and storage underground on a large scale, it is currently a much less serious risk than other injection types. Wastewater injection, hydraulic fracturing, and secondary recovery after oil extraction have all contributed significantly more to induced seismic events than carbon capture and storage in the last several years. There have actually not been any major seismic events associated with carbon injection at this point, whereas there have been recorded seismic occurrences caused by the other injection methods. One such example is massively increased induced seismicity in Oklahoma, USA caused by injection of huge volumes of wastewater into the Arbuckle Group sedimentary rock.

=== Electromagnetic pulses ===
It has been shown that high-energy electromagnetic pulses can trigger the release of energy stored by tectonic movements by increasing the rate of local earthquakes, within 2–6 days after the emission by the EMP generators. The energy released is approximately six orders of magnitude larger than the EM pulses energy. The release of tectonic stress by these relatively small triggered earthquakes equals to 1-17% of the stress released by a strong earthquake in the area. It has been proposed that strong EM impacts could control seismicity as during the periods of the experiments and long time after, the seismicity dynamics were a lot more regular than usual.

== Risk analysis ==

=== Risk factors ===
Risk is defined as the probability of being impacted from an event in the future. Seismic risk is generally estimated by combining the seismic hazard with the exposure and vulnerability at a site or over a region. The hazard from earthquakes depends on the proximity to potential earthquake sources, and the rates of occurrence of different magnitude earthquakes for those sources, and the propagation of seismic waves from the sources to the site of interest. Hazard is then represented in terms of the probability of exceeding some level of ground shaking at a site. Earthquake hazards can include ground shaking, liquefaction, surface fault displacement, landslides, tsunamis, and uplift/subsidence for very large events (ML &gt; 6.0). Because induced seismic events, in general, are smaller than ML 5.0 with short durations, the primary concern is ground shaking.

==== Ground shaking ====
Ground shaking can result in both structural and nonstructural damage to buildings and other structures. It is commonly accepted that structural damage to modern engineered structures happens only in earthquakes larger than ML 5.0. In seismology and earthquake engineering, ground shaking can be measured as peak ground velocity (PGV), peak ground acceleration (PGA) or spectral acceleration (SA) at a building&#x27;s period of excitation. In regions of historical seismicity where buildings are engineered to withstand seismic forces, moderate structural damage is possible, and very strong shaking can be perceived when PGA is greater than 18-34% of g (the acceleration of gravity). In rare cases, nonstructural damage has been reported in earthquakes as small as ML 3.0. For critical facilities like dams and nuclear plants, the acceptable levels of ground shaking is lower than that for buildings.

=== Probabilistic seismic hazard analysis ===
&quot;Extended reading – An Introduction to Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Analysis (PSHA)&quot;

Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Analysis (PSHA) is a probabilistic framework that accounts for probabilities in earthquake occurrence and the probabilities in ground motion propagation. Using the framework, the probability of exceeding a certain level of ground shaking at a site can be quantified, taking into account all the possible earthquakes (both natural and induced). PSHA methodology is used to determine seismic loads for building codes in both the United States and Canada, and increasingly in other parts of the world, as well as protecting dams and nuclear plants from the damage of seismic events.

=== Calculating Seismic Risk ===

==== Earthquake source characterization ====
Understanding the geological background on the site is a prerequisite for seismic hazard estimation. Formations of the rocks, subsurface structures, locations of faults, state of stresses and other parameters that contribute to possible seismic events are considered. Records of past earthquakes of the site are also taken into account.

==== Recurrence pattern ====
The magnitudes of earthquakes occurring at a source generally follow the Gutenberg-Richter relation that states that the number of earthquakes decrease exponentially with increase in magnitude, as shown below,

formula_8

where formula_9 is the magnitude of seismic events, formula_10 is the number of events with magnitudes bigger than formula_9, formula_12 is the rate parameter and formula_13 is the slope. formula_12 and formula_13 vary for different sources. In the case of natural earthquakes, historical seismicity is used to determine these parameters. Using this relationship, the number and probability of earthquakes exceeding a certain magnitude can be predicted following the assumptions that earthquakes follow a Poisson process. However, the goal of this analysis is to determine the possibility of future earthquakes. For induced seismicity in contrast to natural seismicity, the earthquake rates change over time as a result of changes in human activity, and hence are quantified as non-stationary processes with varying seismicity rates over time.

==== Ground motions ====
At a given site, the ground motion describes the seismic waves that would have been observed at that site with a seismometer. In order to simplify the representation of an entire seismogram, PGV (peak ground velocity), PGA (peak ground acceleration), spectral acceleration (SA) at different period, earthquake duration, arias intensity (IA) are some of the parameters that are used to represent ground shaking. Ground motion propagation from the source to a site for an earthquake of a given magnitude is estimated using ground motion prediction equations (GMPE) that have been developed based on historical records. Since historical records are scarce for induced seismicity, researchers have provided modifications to GMPEs for natural earthquakes in order to apply them to indced earthquakes.

==== Seismic hazard ====
The PSHA framework uses the distributions of earthquake magnitudes and ground motion propagation to estimate the seismic hazard – the probability of exceeding a certain level of ground shaking (PGA, PGV, SA, IA, etc.) in the future. Depending on the complexity of the probability distributions, either numerical methods or simulations (such as, Monte Carlo method) may be used to estimate seismic hazard. In the case of induced seismicity, the seismic hazard is not constant, but varies with time due to changes in the underlying seismicity rates.

==== Exposure and vulnerability ====
In order to estimate seismic risk, the hazard is combined with the exposure and vulnerability at a site or in a region. For example, if an earthquake occurs where there are no humans or structures, there would be no human impacts despite any level of seismic hazard. Exposure is defined as the set of entities (such as, buildings and people) that exist at a given site or a region. Vulnerability is defined as the potential of impact to those entities, for example, structural or non-structural damage to a building, and loss of well-being and life for people. Vulnerability can also be represented probabilistically using vulnerability or fragility functions. A vulnerability or fragility function specifies the probability of impact at different levels of ground shaking. In regions like Oklahoma without a lot of historical natural seismicity, structures are not engineered to withstand seismic forces, and as a result are more vulnerable even at low levels of ground shaking, as compared to structures in tectonic regions like California and Japan.

==== Seismic risk ====
Seismic risk is defined as the probability of exceeding a certain level of impact in the future. For example, it may estimate the exceedance probability of moderate or more damage to a building in the future. Seismic hazard is combined with the exposure and vulnerability to estimate seismic risk. While numerical methods may be used to estimate risk at one site, simulation-based methods are better suited to estimate seismic risk for a region with a portfolio of entities, in order to correctly account for the correlations in ground shaking, and impacts. In the case of induced seismicity, the seismic risk varies over time due to changes in the seismic hazard.

=== Risk Mitigation ===
Induced seismicity can cause damage to infrastructure and has been documented to damage buildings in Oklahoma. It can also lead to brine and leakages.

It is easier to predict and mitigate seismicity caused by explosions. Common mitigation strategies include constraining the amount of dynamite used in one single explosion and the locations of the explosions. For injection-related induced seismicity, however, it is still difficult to predict when and where induced seismic events will occur, as well as the magnitudes. Since induced seismic events related to fluid injection are unpredictable, it has garnered more attention from the public. Induced seismicity is only part of the chain reaction from industrial activities that worry the public. Impressions toward induced seismicity are very different between different groups of people. The public tends to feel more negatively towards earthquakes caused by human activities than natural earthquakes. Two major parts of public concern are related to the damages to infrastructure and the well-being of humans. Most induced seismic events are below M 2 and are not able to cause any physical damage. Nevertheless, when the seismic events are felt and cause damages or injuries, questions arise from the public whether it is appropriate to conduct oil and gas operations in those areas. Public perceptions may vary based on the population and tolerance of local people. For example, in the seismically active Geysers geothermal area in Northern California, which is a rural area with a relatively small population, the local population tolerates earthquakes up to M 4.5. Actions have been taken by regulators, industry and researchers. On October 6, 2015, people from industry, government, academia, and the public gathered together to discuss how effective it was to implement a traffic light system or protocol in Canada to help manage risks from induced seismicity.

Risk assessment and tolerance for induced seismicity, however, is subjective and shaped by different factors like politics, economics, and understanding from the public. Policymakers have to often balance the interests of industry with the interests of the population. In these situations, seismic risk estimation serves as a critical tool for quantifying future risk, and can be used to regulate earthquake-inducing activities until the seismic risk reaches a maximum acceptable level to the population.

==== Traffic Light System ====

One of the methods suggested to mitigate seismic risk is a Traffic Light System (TLS), also referred to as Traffic Light Protocol (TLP), which is a calibrated control system that provides continuous and real-time monitoring and management of ground shaking of induced seismicity for specific sites. TLS was first implemented in 2005 in an enhanced geothermal plant in Central America. For oil and gas operations, the most widely implemented one is modified by the system used in the UK. Normally there are two types of TLS – the first one sets different thresholds, usually earthquake local magnitudes (ML) or ground motions from small to large. If the induced seismicity reaches the smaller thresholds, modifications of the operations are implemented by the operators and the regulators are informed. If the induced seismicity reaches the larger thresholds, operations are shut down immediately. The second type of traffic light system sets only one threshold. If this threshold is reached, the operations are halted. This is also called a &quot;stop light system&quot;. Thresholds for the traffic light system vary between and within countries, depending on the area.

However, the traffic light system is not able to account for future changes in seismicity. It may take time for changes in human activities to mitigate the seismic activity, and it has been observed that some of the largest induced earthquakes have occurred after stopping fluid injection.

== Nuclear explosions ==
Nuclear explosions can cause seismic activity, but according to USGS, the resulting seismic activity is less energetic than the original nuclear blast, and generally does not produce large aftershocks. Nuclear explosions may instead release the elastic strain energy that was stored in the rock, strengthening the initial blast shockwave.
== U.S. National Research Council report ==
A 2013 report from the U.S. National Research Council examined the potential for energy technologies—including shale gas recovery, carbon capture and storage, geothermal energy production, and conventional oil and gas development—to cause earthquakes. The report found that only a very small fraction of injection and extraction activities among the hundreds of thousands of energy development sites in the United States have induced seismicity at levels noticeable to the public. However, although scientists understand the general mechanisms that induce seismic events, they are unable to accurately predict the magnitude or occurrence of these earthquakes due to insufficient information about the natural rock systems and a lack of validated predictive models at specific energy development sites.

The report noted that hydraulic fracturing has a low risk for inducing earthquakes that can be felt by people, but underground injection of wastewater produced by hydraulic fracturing and other energy technologies has a higher risk of causing such earthquakes. In addition, carbon capture and storage—a technology for storing excess carbon dioxide underground—may have the potential for inducing seismic events, because significant volumes of fluids are injected underground over long periods of time.

<text>Fellingsbro (, ) is a locality and a parish situated in Lindesberg Municipality, Örebro County, Sweden with 1,384 inhabitants in 2010. It is home to the Fellingsbro folk high school.

==History==
The parish of Fellingsbro is mentioned already in 1331 as &quot;Parochia Fælansbro&quot;, but the first parish church was probably built already in the 12th century. In the late 16th and early 17th centuries many small ironworks were built at the rivers that are running from north to south in the parish. The main product at these ironworks were bar iron. Most of the people were employed in this small scale iron industry and in the rather extensive farming up until the late 19th century when most of the ironworks were closed. Some of the ironworks were then transformed into paper mills.

In 1857 a railroad between Örebro and Arboga was built and a station in Fellingsbro was opened some kilometres east of the parish church. A new urban area with shops and small mechanical industries soon grew up around this railroad station. This urban area was called Fellingsbro after the name of the parish. It became a municipality of its own in 1911, but was again united with the rest of the parish in 1957 and in 1971 Fellingsbro Municipality was incorporated into Lindesberg Municipality.

Fellingsbro &quot;folkhögskola&quot; was established in 1915, but was rebuilt in 1976 after a fire burned down the original building.

Notable natives of Fellingsbro include the textile artist Märtha Gahn.

===Population history===
== Riksdag elections ==
While historically the Fellingsbro district leaned centre-right, that changed from 1988 onwards and since then voted for the Social Democratic coalitions for multiple consecutive elections following 1994. As a result of the leftward shift of the Centre Party in 2018, the village voted to the left of the Lindesberg Municipality as a whole for the first time.

<text>Michael Myers is a character from the slasher film series &quot;Halloween&quot;. He first appears in 1978 in John Carpenter&#x27;s &quot;Halloween&quot; as a young boy who murders his elder sister, Judith Myers. Fifteen years later, he returns home to Haddonfield, Illinois, to murder more teenagers. In the original &quot;Halloween&quot;, the adult Michael Myers, referred to as The Shape in the closing credits, was portrayed by Nick Castle for most of the film and substituted by Tony Moran in the final scene where Michael&#x27;s face is revealed. The character was created by John Carpenter and has been featured in twelve films, as well as novels, video games, and comic books.

The character is the primary antagonist in all the franchise&#x27;s films with the exception of &quot;Halloween III: Season of the Witch&quot;, which is a standalone film disconnected from the continuity of the other films. Since Castle and Moran put on the mask in the original film, six people have stepped into the same role. Castle, George P. Wilbur, Tyler Mane, and James Jude Courtney are the only actors to have portrayed Michael Myers more than once, with Mane and Courtney being the only actors to do so in consecutive films. Michael Myers is characterized as pure evil directly by the filmmakers who created and developed the character over nine films. He typically kills using a chef&#x27;s knife. In the films, Michael wears a white Halloween mask, as well as coveralls, which he usually steals from a victim. The mask used in the first film was a Captain Kirk mask that originated from a cast of William Shatner&#x27;s face made for the 1975 horror film &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Rain&quot;.

==Appearances==
Michael Myers appears in all of the &quot;Halloween&quot; films excluding the standalone &quot;Halloween III: Season of the Witch&quot;, although he is briefly seen on a television advertisement for the original film. Myers has also appeared in expanded universe novels and comic books.

===Films and canons===
Michael Myers’ story has gone through different timelines and canons, with some retconning previously established plots.

====The Original timeline====

Myers made his first appearance in the 1978 film &quot;Halloween&quot;. At the beginning of &quot;Halloween&quot;, a six-year-old Michael murders his teenage sister Judith on Halloween night in 1963. Fifteen years later, he escapes Smith&#x27;s Grove Sanitarium and returns to his hometown of Haddonfield, Illinois, where he stalks a teenage babysitter named Laurie Strode, while his psychiatrist, Dr. Sam Loomis, attempts to track him down. After murdering three of Laurie&#x27;s friends, Michael attacks her as well. She fends him off long enough for Loomis to arrive and shoot Michael six times, knocking him off a balcony; when Loomis goes to check the body, he finds that Michael has disappeared. &quot;Halloween II&quot; (1981) picks up directly where the original ended. Michael follows Laurie to the local hospital and kills the staff one by one. Loomis discovers that Laurie is Michael&#x27;s younger sister and rushes to the hospital to find them. Laurie shoots Michael in the eyes, and Loomis blows up the operating theater while Laurie escapes. Michael emerges from the explosion, engulfed in flames, before finally collapsing dead.

====The Thorn timeline====

Michael does not appear again until &quot;Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers&quot; in 1988, which picks up ten years after the events of &quot;Halloween II&quot;. In this canon, known as the “Thorn Timeline”, Michael survived the explosion, leaving him in a coma. He awakens when he learns Laurie has died in a car accident but has a nine-year-old daughter, Jamie Lloyd. Returning to Haddonfield, he causes a citywide blackout and massacres the town&#x27;s police force and some civilians before being shot by the state police and falling down a mine shaft. &quot;Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers&quot; begins immediately after the fourth film ends, with Michael escaping the mine shaft and being nursed back to health by a local hermit. One year later, he kills the hermit and returns to Haddonfield to find Jamie again, chasing her through his childhood home in a trap set by Loomis. He is eventually subdued by Loomis and taken to the local police station, but a mysterious &quot;Man in Black&quot; kills the officers and frees him.

&quot;&quot; takes place six years after the events of the previous film. Jamie, now fifteen, has been kidnapped and impregnated by a druid cult led by the Man in Black, later revealed to be Dr. Terence Wynn, Loomis&#x27; friend and colleague from Smith&#x27;s Grove. After giving birth, Jamie escapes with her baby, only to be killed by Michael. The baby is found by Tommy Doyle, whom Laurie babysat in the original film. Upon returning to Haddonfield once more, Michael kills relatives of Laurie&#x27;s adoptive family, who are living in his childhood home. He is revealed to be inflicted with the Curse of Thorn, which drives him to kill his family. Wynn and his cult kidnap Jamie&#x27;s baby, as well as Kara Strode and her son Danny. Loomis and Tommy follow them to Smith&#x27;s Grove, where Michael ultimately turns against the cult and slaughters them all. Tommy injects Michael with chemicals and beats him unconscious. Loomis stays behind as the others escape. In the theatrical version, Michael&#x27;s mask is shown on the ground as Loomis screams in the distance, leaving their fates unknown. In the longer “Producer’s Cut”, however, Loomis unmasks whom he thinks is Michael, but instead is revealed to be the dying Dr. Wynn (the “Man in Black”), passing the Mark of Thorn on to Loomis as Michael, now donning the outfit of the “Man in Black”, escapes.

====The H20 timeline====

&quot;Halloween H20: 20 Years Later&quot; establishes a new timeline ignoring the events of the previous three &quot;Thorn&quot; films. In this particular film, Michael has been missing since the hospital explosion twenty years ago. Laurie Strode has faked her death and gone into hiding in California under an assumed name. She is the headmistress of a private boarding school and has a teenage son named John. Michael tracks them down and murders John&#x27;s friends. After getting her son to safety, Laurie decides to face Michael and ultimately decapitates him. &quot;&quot;, which picks up three years after &quot;H20&quot;, retcons Michael&#x27;s death, establishing that the man Laurie decapitated was a paramedic whom Michael had attacked and swapped clothes with before escaping. Michael tracks down an institutionalized Laurie and kills her. He returns to Haddonfield, where one year later, he kills a group of college students filming an internet reality show inside his childhood home. Contestant Sara Moyer and show producer Freddie Harris escape after electrocuting Michael. Michael&#x27;s body and the bodies of his victims are then taken to the morgue. As the medical examiner begins to inspect Michael&#x27;s body, he awakens.

====The Rob Zombie timeline====
The series was rebooted in 2007 with Rob Zombie&#x27;s &quot;Halloween&quot; remake. The film establishes from the beginning that Michael and Laurie are siblings, and has an increased focus on Michael&#x27;s childhood: a ten-year-old Michael is shown killing animals and suffering emotional abuse at home. After killing his sister Judith and three others, he is committed to Smith&#x27;s Grove where he takes up the hobby of creating papier-mâché masks and receives unsuccessful therapy from Dr. Sam Loomis. His mother Deborah commits suicide after witnessing him killing a nurse. As an adult, Michael returns to Haddonfield to reunite with Laurie. However, Laurie has no memory of Michael and is terrified of him, ultimately shooting him in the head in self-defense after he kills her friends and adoptive parents. In an unused alternate ending, Michael is shown listening to reason as Loomis convinces him to release Laurie and drop his weapon. He then begins to approach them, intentions unclear, before being shot down by Sheriff Brackett&#x27;s overzealous men.

Zombie&#x27;s story is continued in the sequel, &quot;Halloween II&quot;, which begins in the moments after the 2007 remake ends. The subsequent events and Michael&#x27;s fate differ between the theatrical cut and extended Director&#x27;s Cut of the film; in the former, the events of the film take place one year later, whereas in the latter, it is two years later. In both versions, Michael is presumed dead but resurfaces after a vision of Deborah informs him that he must track Laurie down so that they can &quot;come home&quot;. In the film, Michael and Laurie are implied to have a mental link, with the two sharing visions of their mother. During the climax of the theatrical cut, after Michael has murdered Loomis, Laurie kills Michael by stabbing him repeatedly in the chest and face with his knife, with the final scene suggesting that she has taken on her brother&#x27;s psychosis as she dons his mask. In the Director&#x27;s Cut ending, Michael speaks a single word, &#x27;die&#x27;, before killing Loomis. He is then gunned down by the Haddonfield police. Laurie approaches Loomis&#x27; body whilst holding Michael&#x27;s knife, and appears to raise the knife before she too is shot dead by police.

====The Blumhouse timeline====

Michael&#x27;s appearance in the 2018 film &quot;Halloween&quot; establishes the “Blumhouse timeline”. This version is a direct sequel to the original film in which Michael and Laurie are not siblings. It is established that after being shot by Loomis, Michael fled to his childhood home and was arrested by the Haddonfield police. After forty years at Smith&#x27;s Grove Sanitarium, he escapes again and returns to Haddonfield for another killing spree. He again encounters Laurie, who has been living in fear of his return. She shoots off two of his fingers and, with the help of her daughter Karen and granddaughter Allyson, traps him in the basement of her house, which they then set on fire. Michael is heard breathing at the end of the credits, indicating that he survived.

&quot;Halloween Kills&quot; is a direct sequel to the 2018 film in which Michael escapes the burning house when the fire department arrive to stop the blaze before it becomes too intense. As Michael resumes his killing spree, the enraged townspeople form a mob to hunt him down. While the mob proves to be unnecessarily destructive, they do eventually swarm him and seemingly kill him. As they attempt to confirm he&#x27;s really dead, Michael rises again and massacres them all. He returns to his childhood home, where he kills Karen as well. &quot;Halloween Ends&quot; (2022) picks up four years after its predecessor, revealing that Michael went into hiding after killing Karen. Now in a badly weakened condition, Michael inhabits a sewer cavern where a troubled young man named Corey Cunningham, who is dating Allyson, encounters him. Corey begins helping Michael kill people and starts to manifest the same evil. He eventually steals Michael&#x27;s mask and murders several people who wronged him. He also goes after Laurie, but is shot down a stairwell. Michael arrives to retrieve his mask and kills Corey. Laurie pins Michael to a table and slits his throat, but he chokes her with the last of his strength. Allyson intervenes and breaks Michael&#x27;s arm, allowing Laurie to fatally slice his wrist. A town-wide procession takes place, where everyone watches Laurie dispose of Michael&#x27;s corpse in an industrial shredder, ending his rampage once and for all.

===Literature===
Michael Myers made his literary debut in October 1979 when Curtis Richards released a novelization of the film. The book follows the events of the film but includes references to the festival of Samhain. A prologue provides a possible explanation for Michael&#x27;s murderous impulses, telling the story of Enda, a disfigured Celtic teenager who butchers the Druid princess Deirdre and her lover as revenge for rejecting him; the king subsequently has his shaman curse Enda&#x27;s soul for walking the earth reliving his crime for eternity. It is later revealed that Michael Myers suffers nightmares about Enda and Deirdre, as did Michael&#x27;s great-grandfather before shooting two people to death at a Halloween harvest dance in the 1890s. The novel shows Michael&#x27;s childhood in more detail; his mother voices concern over her son&#x27;s anti-social behavior shortly before he murders Judith. Dr. Loomis notices the boy&#x27;s effortless control and manipulation of the staff and patients at Smith&#x27;s Grove during his incarceration. Later in the story, Michael&#x27;s stalking of Laurie and her friends is depicted as more explicitly sexual than was apparent in the film, with several references to him having an erection. Michael returned to the world of literature with the 1981 adaptation of &quot;Halloween II&quot; written by Jack Martin; it was published alongside the first film sequel, with the novel following the film events, with an additional victim, a reporter, added to the novel. The final novelization to feature Michael was &quot;Halloween IV&quot;, released October 1988. The novel was written by Nicholas Grabowsky, and like the previous adaptations, follows the events of &quot;Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers&quot;.

Over a four-month period, Berkley Books published three young adult novels written by Kelly O&#x27;Rourke; the novels are original stories created by O&#x27;Rourke, with no direct continuity with the films. The first, released on October 1, 1997, titled &quot;The Scream Factory&quot;, follows a group of friends who set up a haunted house attraction in the basement of Haddonfield City Hall, only to be stalked and killed by Michael Myers while they are there. &quot;The Old Myers Place&quot; is the second novel, released December 1, 1997, and focuses on Mary White, who moves into the Myers house with her family and takes up residence in Judith Myers&#x27; former bedroom. Michael returns home and begins stalking and attacking Mary and her friends. O&#x27;Rourke&#x27;s final novel, &quot;The Mad House&quot;, was released on February 1, 1998. &quot;The Mad House&quot; features a young girl, Christine Ray, who joins a documentary film crew that travels to haunted locations; they are currently headed to Smith Grove Mental Hospital. The crew is quickly confronted by Michael Myers.

The character&#x27;s first break into comics came with a series of comics published by Brian Pulido&#x27;s Chaos! Comics. The first, simply titled &quot;Halloween&quot;, was intended to be a one-issue special, but eventually two sequels spawned: &quot;Halloween II: The Blackest Eyes&quot; and &quot;Halloween III: The Devil&#x27;s Eyes&quot;. All of the stories were written by Phil Nutman, with Daniel Farrands—writer for &quot;Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers&quot;—assisting on the first issue; David Brewer and Justiniano worked on the illustrations. Tommy Doyle is the main protagonist in each of the issues, focusing on his attempts to kill Michael Myers. The first issue includes backstory on Michael&#x27;s childhood, while the third picks up after the events of the film &quot;Halloween H20&quot;.

In 2003, Michael appeared in the self-published comic &quot;One Good Scare&quot;, written by Stefan Hutchinson and illustrated by Peter Fielding. The main character in the comic is Lindsey Wallace, the young girl who first saw Michael Myers alongside Tommy Doyle in the original 1978 film. Hutchinson wanted to bring the character back to his roots, and away from the &quot;lumbering Jason-clone&quot; the film sequels had made him. On 25 July 2006, as an insert inside the DVD release of &quot;Halloween: 25 Years of Terror&quot;, the comic book &quot;Halloween: Autopsis&quot; was released. Written by Stefan Hutchinson and artwork by Marcus Smith and Nick Dismas, the story is about a photographer assigned to take pictures of Michael Myers. As the photographer, Carter, follows Dr. Loomis; he begins to take on Loomis&#x27;s obsession himself, until finally meeting Michael Myers in person, which results in his death.

In 2008, Devil&#x27;s Due Publishing began releasing more &quot;Halloween&quot; comic books, starting with a four issue mini series, titled &quot;Halloween: Nightdance&quot;. Written by Stefan Hutchinson, &quot;Nightdance&quot; takes place in Russellville, and follows Michael&#x27;s obsession with Lisa Thomas, a girl who reminds him of his sister Judith. Lisa is afraid of the dark after Michael trapped her in a basement for days, and years later, he starts sending her disturbing, childlike drawings and murdering those around her on Halloween. Meanwhile, Ryan Nichols is hunting Michael down after seeing him attack and kidnap his wife. In the end, Michael frames Ryan for the murders and buries Lisa alive. Hutchinson explains that &quot;Nightdance&quot; was an attempt to escape the dense continuity of the film series and recreate the tone of the 1978 film; Michael becomes inexplicably fixated on Lisa, just as he did with Laurie in the original &quot;Halloween&quot;, before the sequels established that a sibling bond was actually his motivation for stalking her. Included in the &quot;Nightdance&quot; trade paperback is the short prose story &quot;Charlie&quot;, which features Charlie Bowles, a Russellville serial killer who taps into the same evil force which motivates Michael Myers. To celebrate the anniversary of the &quot;Halloween&quot; series, Devil&#x27;s Due released a one-shot comic entitled &quot;Halloween: 30 Years of Terror&quot; in August 2008, written by Hutchinson. An anthology collection inspired by John Carpenter&#x27;s original film, Michael appears in various stories, tampering with Halloween candy, decapitating a beauty queen, tormenting Laurie Strode, and killing a school teacher.

==Concept and creation==
The character derives his name from English film distributor Michael Myers, who successfully distributed &quot;Assault on Precinct 13&quot; in the UK through his Miracle Films. According to John Carpenter, Myers helped &quot;push &quot;Assault on Precinct 13&quot; into the London Film Festival, that&#x27;s where my reputation kind of began, so I felt I owed him. So that was my tribute to him, he was this dearest, dearest man&quot;. Carpenter wanted to &quot;raise this Michael Myers character up to a mythic status; make him human, yes, but almost like a force. A force that will never stop, that can&#x27;t be denied.&quot; He did not want to give Michael a backstory, but put him immediately into a &quot;legendary kind of situation&quot;. To elaborate, Carpenter explained that he was influenced by Yul Brynner&#x27;s &quot;killer robot that couldn&#x27;t be destroyed&quot; in Michael Crichton&#x27;s &quot;Westworld&quot;. Carpenter felt this kind of character, one that was &quot;a force&quot;, would be more terrifying than personifying him. Michael&#x27;s mask was meant to help illustrate this further, because it would &quot;blank out his human features […] Making him then just some sort of force of evil that is irrational, unstoppable.&quot;

When developing the 2007 &quot;Halloween&quot; remake, Rob Zombie commented on his intentions for the character, stating that he wanted Michael Myers to be the lead character in the film. Zombie felt the character could be made &quot;more intense&quot; if he was more than just a &quot;faceless thing floating around in the background&quot;. Zombie believed it was important to be able to see the events that shape the character, making it &quot;more disturbing&quot; to the audience.

===Developing &quot;The Shape&quot;===
In the original film, three actors portrayed Michael Myers. Will Sandin played a six-year-old Michael, who murders his sister Judith on Halloween night. Later in the film, Tony Moran and Nick Castle would portray the adult Michael, with Moran credited as &quot;Michael Myers (age 23)&quot; and Castle credited as &quot;The Shape&quot;. Nick Castle was a friend, and former University of Southern California schoolmate, of John Carpenter. Production on &quot;Halloween&quot; was taking place near Castle&#x27;s house, so he asked Carpenter if he could hang around the set, because he was attempting to get his own movies &quot;off the ground&quot;. Carpenter agreed on the condition that Castle play the role of the masked killer. For his part, Castle was paid $25 a day. Debra Hill remarks: &quot;[Nick Castle&#x27;s] father was a choreographer for Fred Astaire, and he just moved great. And I think John really wanted to play him as that, where he just looks, and his head turns, and he&#x27;s enamored by this sister-like character that he sees in Laurie Strode. He makes the connection; he breaks out of the insane asylum and gets to his house, and sees this young girl, and makes this sort of subtle connection.&quot;

Castle&#x27;s motivation while filming was simple, &quot;walk from this point to the end point, and &quot;roll&quot;&quot;; this was reflected in Carpenter&#x27;s directing, or lack thereof, as Carpenter himself admits that the only bit of direction he gave Castle was, &quot;Do nothing, just walk. Don&#x27;t act, just walk.&quot; To elaborate, during filming Castle tried to find extra motivation for the character, attempting to get into the mind of someone who is mentally ill. Carpenter had to keep reminding him to keep it &quot;simple&quot;; he wanted Castle to make sure the character moved &quot;gracefully&quot; and was a &quot;blank slate that we can project everything into, and make it much more horrifying&quot;. Jamie Lee Curtis believes Castle kept the character from being nothing more than just a &quot;thug in a suit&quot;. Castle was replaced by Tony Moran for the scene where Michael is unmasked, because Carpenter and Hill wanted someone who had more of an &quot;angelic&quot; face.

Moran, who was looking for work, received a call from his agent about an audition for a &quot;B flick&quot;, where he would be playing a &quot;psycho&quot;. Moran prepared for his audition by neglecting to sleep, shave, shower or wash his hair for three days. He wore tattered clothes, with hiking boots to the audition. After being introduced to John Carpenter, Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasence, Moran proceeded to slam his feet up on the table and demand some coffee. He startled everyone at the table, and that afternoon received a phone call that he had gotten the job. Moran would take up the role from the point that Michael is strangling Laurie, as production designer Tommy Lee Wallace had performed the job during the scene where Michael breaks through the closet and Nick Castle in the part up to that scene. Moran would film the rest of the scenes—the removal of Michael&#x27;s mask, being shot by Loomis and then falling over the balcony—except where Michael&#x27;s body lies on the ground outside. In response to the &quot;angelic face&quot; remark made by Castle, Moran contends that he was not made aware of that &quot;concept&quot; when he was hired, but after viewing some photos of him and Carpenter on an A&amp;E special, he &quot;kind of sees what [Castle] means&quot;.

Stunt performer Dick Warlock played Michael Myers in &quot;Halloween II&quot;, replacing Castle who was beginning a career as a director. Warlock&#x27;s previous experience in film was as a stunt double in films such as &quot;The Green Berets&quot; (1968), &quot;Jaws&quot; (1975) and the 1974 television series &quot;&quot;. Warlock had not seen the original film before he was hired, but after getting the job he watched the film &quot;two or three times&quot;, modeling his behavior after the few scenes Tommy Lee Wallace performed. Wallace portrayed the character in the scene where Michael attacks Laurie in the closet, and the scene where he sits up and turns toward Laurie, after having fallen down wounded from her counter-attack. Warlock modeled his movements for &quot;Halloween II&quot; after those scenes, as well as the scene where Michael tilts his head to the side while staring at the body of Bob stuck on the wall. Warlock took on Michael&#x27;s characteristic &quot;breathing&quot;, which was heard in the original film, while he was behind the mask. Debra Hill claims that although &quot;the Shape&quot; had no lines, Castle&#x27;s portrayal gave them the presence that they wanted for the movie; she goes on to say that Dick Warlock was unable to emulate that presence, despite studying Castle&#x27;s performance. George P. Wilbur did not study any of the previous &quot;Halloween&quot; films when he took over the role in &quot;The Return of Michael Myers&quot;.

Nick Castle would return to portray Michael in the 2018 sequel for select masked scenes. Newcomer James Jude Courtney would take over primary duties for the film and its subsequent sequels. Director and writer David Gordon Green explained to Courtney that he wanted his version of Michael to be an amalgamation of Castle&#x27;s original performance and the addition of an efficient cat-like style of movement. Courtney used John Carpenter and Castle&#x27;s work on the original film to determine how the 40 years that transpired between the events of the films would inform the character over time.

===The mask===
Tommy Lee Wallace, writer/director of &quot;Halloween III: Season of the Witch&quot;, was the production designer/co-editor on &quot;Halloween&quot;, and it was up to him to find &quot;the perfect mask&quot; for the Michael Myers character. The mask was intended to have a &quot;blank face&quot;, and the William Shatner Halloween mask he found was exactly what he needed, &quot;It didn&#x27;t really look like anybody.&quot; Wallace cut the eyeholes larger and rounder, removed the eyebrows and sideburns, poofed up the hair so it looked &quot;demented and strange&quot; and finally spray-painted the mask white. Wallace explains, &quot;It created a shiver right in the room, and we knew we had something special.&quot; John Carpenter claims that the mask looked nothing like William Shatner whatsoever, but joked, &quot;I guess I owe the success of &quot;Halloween&quot; to William Shatner.&quot; According to Jamie Lee Curtis, the mask needed to be a &quot;human image&quot;, and the only thing in stores at the time that matched what they needed on set was the Shatner mask. Carpenter elaborates:&quot;We didn&#x27;t have any money to make a mask. It was originally written the way you see it, in other words, it&#x27;s a pale mask with human features, almost featureless. I don&#x27;t know why I wrote that down, why Debra and I decided on that, maybe it was because of an old movie called &quot;Eyes Without a Face&quot;. It&#x27;s a French film, Franju made it, this girl had a burned face so she wore this face mask, it was real creepy because it was featureless and immobile except for her eyes. So Tommy Lee Wallace, our production designer, ran up to the mask shop on Hollywood Boulevard and bought a couple, one was a clown mask, and that&#x27;s, you know, one way to go, and the other he got this William Shatner &quot;Star Trek&quot; mask; Captain Kirk.&quot;

Contrary to reports, the mask used in &quot;Halloween II&quot; was the same mask used in the original film. According to Dick Warlock, Debra Hill stored the original mask under her bed before she brought it to Warlock to wear. Warlock offers his opinion on why the mask looks different in the second film: &quot;I think the lighting has a lot to do with the way the mask looks from film to film. The shape of my face is also totally different than [Nick] Castle&#x27;s, [Tommy Lee] Wallace&#x27;s or probably any of the other people who wore it in &quot;Halloween&quot;.&quot; The original mask has since been sold &quot;to a man in Ohio. He has two haunted houses. One in Toledo and one in Tiffin. He had the mask and coveralls on display there this past October. I&#x27;m supposing he&#x27;ll display them every year in one place or the other,&quot; according to Warlock. In 2017, the owner of the original mask identified himself as Mark Roberts, and provided new pictures of the mask as it appeared that year. Although Roberts pays to keep the prop in an airtight, climate-controlled storage case, the mask has significantly degraded over the years. Roberts stated that despite resisting for many years, he was considering a professional restoration.

Dominique Othenin-Girard, director of &quot;Halloween 5&quot;, began casting for the Michael Myers character using the &quot;Halloween 4&quot; mask during auditions, but was &quot;perplexed&quot; with Don Shanks&#x27; performance. Girard wanted the character to &quot;feel human and alive&quot;, but knew that without dialogue or facial expressions he would not be able to achieve his goal. Girard decide to use latex material to create new masks for Don Shanks, and the KNB special effects team attempted to go for a human interpretation of evil. Girard also felt it was necessary to distance himself from the &quot;plastic, shiny look of the hockey mask of &quot;Friday the 13th&quot;&quot;. While the special effects team worked on the new masks, Girard requested that the team alter the traditional design of the nose, which he thought felt &quot;too realistic and too normal, too round and soft, too much like a human nose&quot;. Girard wanted &quot;the feel of a mask&quot;, something &quot;unmovable, like a façade hiding a terrible secret behind steel&quot;.

Adam Arkin, who plays guidance counselor Will Brennan in &quot;Halloween H20&quot;, remarks, &quot;There&#x27;s something that&#x27;s so minimalistic and so neutral about that face, that becomes sort of indelibly etched in your memory, number one. And I think number two, you&#x27;re able to project any kind of frightening idea or image on top of it.&quot;

===Characterization===
A common characterization is that Michael Myers is evil. John Carpenter has described the character as &quot;almost a supernatural force - a force of nature. An evil force that&#x27;s loose,&quot; a force that is &quot;unkillable&quot; Professor Nicholas Rogers elaborates, &quot;Myers is depicted as a mythic, elusive bogeyman, one of superhuman strength who cannot be killed by bullets, stab wounds, or fire.&quot; Carpenter&#x27;s inspiration for the &quot;evil&quot; that Michael would embody came when he was in college. While on a class trip at a mental institution in Kentucky, Carpenter visited &quot;the most serious, mentally ill patients&quot;. Among those patients was a young boy around twelve to thirteen years-old. The boy gave this &quot;schizophrenic stare&quot;, &quot;a real evil stare&quot;, which Carpenter found &quot;unsettling&quot;, &quot;creepy&quot;, and &quot;completely insane&quot;. Carpenter&#x27;s experience would inspire the characterization Loomis would give of Michael to Sheriff Brackett in the original film. Debra Hill has stated the scene where Michael kills the Wallace&#x27;s German Shepherd was done to illustrate how he is &quot;really evil and deadly&quot;.

The ending scene of Michael being shot six times, and then disappearing from the ground outside the house, was meant to terrify the imagination of the audience. Carpenter tried to keep the audience guessing as to who Michael Myers really is—he is gone, and everywhere at the same time; he is more than human; he may be supernatural, and no one knows how he got that way. To Carpenter, keeping the audience guessing was better than explaining away the character with &quot;he&#x27;s cursed by some...&quot; For Josh Hartnett, who portrayed John Tate in &quot;Halloween H20&quot;, &quot;it&#x27;s that abstract, it&#x27;s easier for me to be afraid of it. You know, someone who just kind of appears and, you know [Mimics stabbing noise from &quot;Psycho&quot;] instead of an actual human who you think you can talk to. And no remorse, it&#x27;s got no feelings, that&#x27;s the most frightening, definitely.&quot; Richard Schickel, film critic for &quot;TIME&quot;, felt Michael was &quot;irrational&quot; and &quot;really angry about something&quot;, having what Schickel referred to as &quot;a kind of primitive, obsessed intelligence&quot;. Schickel considered this the &quot;definition of a good monster&quot;, by making the character appear &quot;less than human&quot;, but having enough intelligence &quot;to be dangerous&quot;.
Dominique Othenin-Girard attempted to have audiences &quot;relate to &#x27;Evil&#x27;, to Michael Myers&#x27;s &#x27;ill&#x27; side&quot;. Girard wanted Michael to appear &quot;more human […] even vulnerable, with contradicting feelings inside of him&quot;. He illustrated these feelings with a scene where Michael removes his mask and sheds a tear. Girard explains, &quot;Again, to humanize him, to give him a tear. If Evil or in this case our boogeyman knows pain, or love or demonstrate a feeling of regrets; he becomes even more scary to me if he pursue his malefic action. He shows an evil determination beyond his feelings. Dr. Loomis tries to reach his emotional side several times in [&quot;Halloween 5&quot;]. He thinks he could cure Michael through his feelings.&quot;

Daniel Farrands, writer of &quot;The Curse of Michael Myers&quot;, describes the character as a &quot;sexual deviant&quot;. According to him, the way Michael follows girls around and watches them contains a subtext of repressed sexuality. Farrands theorizes that, as a child, Michael became fixated on the murder of his sister Judith, and for his own twisted reasons felt the need to repeat that action over and over again, finding a sister-like figure in Laurie who excited him sexually. He also believes that by revealing Laurie to be Michael&#x27;s literal sister, the sequels took away from the simplicity and relatability of the original &quot;Halloween&quot;. Nevertheless, when writing &quot;Curse&quot;, Farrands was tasked with creating a mythology for Michael which defined his motives and why he couldn&#x27;t be killed. He says, &quot;He can&#x27;t just be a man anymore, he&#x27;s gone beyond that. He&#x27;s mythical. He&#x27;s supernatural. So, I took it from that standpoint that there&#x27;s something else driving him. A force that goes beyond that five senses that has infected this boy&#x27;s soul and now is driving him.&quot; As the script developed and more people became involved, Farrands admits that the film went too far in explaining Michael Myers and that he himself was not completely satisfied with the finished product.

Michael does not speak in the films; the first time audiences ever hear his voice is in the 2007 remake. Michael speaks as a child during the beginning of the film, but while in Smith&#x27;s Grove he stops talking completely. Rob Zombie originally planned to have the adult Michael speak to Laurie in the film&#x27;s finale, simply saying his childhood nickname for her, &quot;Boo&quot;. Zombie explained that this version was not used because he was afraid having the character talk at that point would demystify him too much, and because the act of Michael handing Laurie the photograph of them together was enough.

Describing aspects of Michael Myers which he wanted to explore in the comic book &quot;Halloween: Nightdance&quot;, writer Stefan Hutchinson mentions the character&#x27;s &quot;bizarre and dark sense of humor&quot;, as seen when he wore a sheet over his head to trick a girl into thinking he was her boyfriend, and the satisfaction he gets from scaring the characters before he murders them, such as letting Laurie know he is stalking her. Hutchinson feels there is a perverse nature to Michael&#x27;s actions: &quot;see the difference between how he watches and pursues women to men&quot;. He also suggests that Michael Myers&#x27; hometown of Haddonfield is the cause of his behaviour, likening his situation to that of Jack the Ripper, citing Myers as a &quot;product of normal surburbia - all the repressed emotion of fake Norman Rockwell smiles&quot;. Hutchinson describes Michael as a &quot;monster of abjection&quot;. When asked his opinion of Rob Zombie&#x27;s expansion on Michael&#x27;s family life, Hutchinson says that explaining why Michael does what he does &quot;[reduces] the character&quot;. That being said, Hutchinson explores the nature of evil in the short story &quot;Charlie&quot;—included in the &quot;Halloween Nightdance&quot; trade paperback—and says that Michael Myers spent fifteen years &quot;attuning himself to this force to the point where he is, as Loomis says, &#x27;pure evil&#x27;&quot;. &quot;Nightdance&quot; artist Tim Seeley describes the character&#x27;s personality in John Carpenter&#x27;s 1978 film as &quot;a void&quot;, which allows the character to be more open to interpretation than the later sequels allotted him. He surmises that Michael embodies a part of everyone; a part people are afraid will one day &quot;snap and knife someone&quot;, which lends to the fear that Michael creates on screen.

A study was conducted by California State University&#x27;s Media Psychology Lab, on the psychological appeal of movie monsters—Vampires, Freddy Krueger, Frankenstein&#x27;s monster, Jason Voorhees, Godzilla, Chucky, Hannibal Lecter, King Kong, and The Alien—which surveyed 1,166 people nationwide (United States), with ages ranging from 16 to 91. It was published in the Journal of Media Psychology. In the survey, Michael was considered to be the &quot;embodiment of pure evil&quot;; when compared to the other characters, Michael Myers was rated the highest. Michael was characterized lending to the understanding of insanity, being ranked second to Hannibal Lecter in this category; he also placed first as the character who shows audiences the &quot;dark side of human nature&quot;. He was rated second in the category &quot;monster enjoys killing&quot; by the participants, and believed to have &quot;superhuman strength&quot;. Michael was rated highest among the characters in the &quot;monster is an outcast&quot; category.

==In popular culture==
Michael Myers is regarded as one of the most recognizable and most iconic horror villains, alongside Jason Voorhees from &quot;Friday the 13th&quot;, Freddy Krueger from &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot;, and Ghostface from &quot;Scream&quot;. In &quot;Robot Chicken&#x27;s&quot; nineteenth episode, &quot;That Hurts Me&quot;, Michael Myers (voiced by Seth Green) appears as a housemate of &quot;Horror Movie Big Brother&quot;, alongside fellow horror movie killers Jason Voorhees, Ghostface, Freddy Krueger, Pinhead, and Leatherface. Myers is evicted from the house, and takes off his mask to reveal himself to be the comedian Mike Myers, and utters his Austin Powers catchphrase, &quot;I feel randy, baby, yeah!&quot; He then proceeds to kill the host. Michael appeared on 25 April 2008 episode of &quot;Ghost Whisperer&quot;, starring Jennifer Love Hewitt, titled &quot;Horror Show&quot;. Here, a spirit communicates with Hewitt&#x27;s character by placing her in scenes from the deceased&#x27;s favorite horror movies, and one of the scenes involved Michael Myers. The &quot;Cold Case&quot; episode &quot;Bad Night&quot; has the main characters reopening a 1978 murder case after new evidence indicates the victim was killed by a mentally disturbed man who, after seeing &quot;Halloween&quot; in theatres, went on a killing spree dressed as Michael. Michael Myers makes a cameo appearance in Rob Zombie&#x27;s &quot;The Haunted World of El Superbeasto&quot;, released on 22 September 2009. Michael Myers appears in the DLC pack for the video game &quot;Call of Duty: Ghosts&quot;, Onslaught, as a playable character. Myers makes another appearance in &quot;Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III&quot; as a part of the 2024 Halloween event, appearing as an Operator. Myers also makes a playable appearance in the &quot;Halloween&quot; chapter of the video game &quot;Dead by Daylight&quot;, alongside Laurie Strode.

In one of the various merchandises to feature the character, Michael Myers made his video game debut with the 1983 Atari video game &quot;Halloween&quot;. The game is rare to find, often being played on emulators. No characters from the films are specifically named, with the goal of the game focusing on the player, who is a babysitter, protecting children from a &quot;homicidal maniac [who] has escaped from a mental institution&quot;. Michael was one of several horror icons to be included in the 2009 version of Universal Studios Hollywood&#x27;s Halloween Horror Nights event, as a part of a maze entitled &quot;Halloween: The Life and Crimes of Michael Myers&quot; Pop artist Eric Millikin created a large mosaic portrait of Michael Myers out of Halloween candy and spiders as part of his &quot;Totally Sweet&quot; series in 2013. In 2018, Spirit Halloween released a lifesize animated Michael Myers prop to coincide with the 2018 film.

<text>Pádraig Judas O&#x27;Leprosy and Rodraig Spartacus O&#x27;Leprosy (born 1941) are the central characters of Irish television series &quot;A Scare at Bedtime&quot;, created and performed by Ciaran Morrison and Mick O&#x27;Hara. More recently, the brothers have presented &quot;The Podge and Rodge Show&quot;, a chat show in the same vein, and &quot;Podge &amp; Rodge&#x27;s Stickit Inn&quot;, set in a pub. Morrison and O&#x27;Hara also created and perform the characters of Zig and Zag, Bronx Bunny, and Teddy T.

==Character history==

===Origins===
Podge originally appeared as a &quot;villain&quot; character on the children&#x27;s programming block, &quot;The Den&quot;. He was introduced in 1990, as an ordinary puppet that Zag (of Zig and Zag) had found in a box amongst the rubbish behind an old joke shop. Dubbing the puppet &quot;Podge,&quot; Zag used him to practice ventriloquism, and would put on the &quot;Podge and Zag&quot; show, which a jealous Zig usually interrupted. 

During one of these shorts an unidentified voiceover can be heard saying to Zag, &quot;aren&#x27;t you a smelly stupid ugly alien&quot;. The character of Podge was then revealed to be alive to the audience, with the ability to speak and move. He also acted as an antagonist to Zig, often bullying him, or encouraging him to commit acts of nuisance such as stealing a bike.

Other characters, such as Zag and the presenter Ray D&#x27;Arcy remained oblivious to Podge&#x27;s true nature for some time; Podge can occasionally be seen to be moving in the background during continuity announcements between programmes, or be seen scheming on his own, and letters and pictures would pour in from the viewing children trying to let them know that the little puppet was evil. 

Eventually, after Zig finally told Zag and Ray the truth, Podge made a power play and took over the programme for a day, revealing that he had been brought to life by a magician, but then sealed away when he turned evil. Podge also possessed some magical powers of his own that he&#x27;d learned from the magician, and turned one of the crew members into a teapot. He was finally dealt with when the magician arrived at the end of the programming day, hypnotized Podge (who the magician called &quot;Albert&quot;), and took Podge away.

===As a recurring villain===

Following his initial &quot;story arc,&quot; Podge became a recurring presence on &quot;The Den&quot; over the next six years, causing trouble by using one of many paper-thins disguises that the gang could never see through, despite his constant insults and use his catchphrase, &quot;Oh really?&quot; Over the years, he posed as a child named &quot;Patrick Egdop,&quot; a postman also named Patrick, a leprechaun, a trick-or-treater, a health inspector, a taxi-driver, and a builder named &quot;Diglas McDoug.&quot; He physically fought with Dustin the Turkey upon their first meeting, establishing a pattern that would often repeat when they met again; once, he locked Dustin in the cupboard under the stairs and attempted to take his place by means of disguising himself with a few feathers and a coffee cup for a beak. He often sought to eat Zuppy, who could always see through his disguises and was responsible for his being caught out several times. His &quot;magical&quot; origins were never referred to again, but he retained some of his powers, such as an ability to disappear into thin air to escape when his disguises were seen through.

Podge&#x27;s most daring scheme was 1992&#x27;s &quot;Christmas Crisis,&quot; in which he tried to ensure that Zig would receive no presents from Santa Claus, using his postman disguise to enter their home, break one of the presents, for which Zig would be blamed, and also make off with a bottle of &quot;Scent of Man&quot;, a cologne which would be a recurring motif for the character, often revealing his identity. Zig was able to prove his innocence, but Podge in his right mind, was still intent on ruining Christmas, taking the gang&#x27;s Christmas letters and not delivering them to Santa. When &quot;The Den&quot; crew set out to do the job themselves, Podge kidnapped Santa and took his place but was thwarted in the end.

Eventually, in 1996, Podge was finally well and truly caught by the Den gang, only to be freed by his never-before-seen twin brother, Rodge, posing as a policeman, who escorted him away. The &quot;Dastardly Duo&quot; continued to make trouble for the gang over the following year, mostly on the holidays; they staged &quot;Christmas Crisis II&quot; in 1996 to try and ruin the gang&#x27;s Christmas once again. Rodge&#x27;s precise origins were never gone into (the young children who were the programme&#x27;s target audience had not been around for Podge&#x27;s own introduction years before, after all, so it didn&#x27;t really matter), but he possessed the same &quot;vanishing&quot; power Podge did, as well as the same fondness for Scent of Man and taste for dog. The brothers had particular contempt for &quot;Echo Island&quot;, especially the version broadcast in Irish.
Podge then later returns to The Den during the 2020 series where he first appeared as a Policeman that threatens to shut the whole show down, and then he came back during Christmas 2020 where he came back as a elf where he kidnapped Zag to the props room to get him trapped and make Podge being a temporary replacement, until Santa arrives where Podge didn&#x27;t want to invite him around but Santa has other plans where he thinks that the elf (Podge) is a imposter and then teleporting him to the snow globe as a punishment and the gang saves Zag out from the props room.

===Ballydung===
In 1997, Podge and Rodge were transitioned from the Den to their own, adult-oriented comedy show, &quot;A Scare at Bedtime&quot;. The show ignored their established history from their earlier, child-friendly appearances, and created a new one for them: in this series, the aged brothers live in Ballydung Manor, a fictional estate located their fictional hometown in Ballydung (off the bypass past Ballywank) in County Ring, a converted asylum which they share with an insane old nurse they call &quot;Granny,&quot; as well as their disease-ridden pet cat Pox, and a nicotine-addicted monkey named Spunky. By this show&#x27;s telling of events, the two brothers have lived together for decades, and hate one another, but Podge has repeatedly sabotaged any attempts by Rodge to leave him and improve his life.

Ballydung Manor may be reached by dialling Ballydung 666 from a telephone. In the earliest seasons of the show, the brothers&#x27; shared bedroom was the only part of the manor shown, but in later years, their kitchen was also used. This remained largely the case during the follow-up series &quot;The Podge and Rodge Show&quot;, although the living room was featured in the &quot;Bogmannay&quot; special on New Year&#x27;s Eve 2006. The underground dungeon of Ballydung Manor was also shown in an episode of the chat show when Podge and Rodge invited guest Sheana Keane to partake in a gruesome game of Operation!.

Another location known to be in Ballydung is &quot;The Stickitt Inn&quot;, which features on the chat show. Ballydung also has a bypass which was blocked off by a swarm of locusts on the Christmas Special of 2006, &quot;A Frightmare Before Christmas&quot;, thus preventing any of the guests attending the show.

==Television and radio shows==

===&quot;A Scare at Bedtime&quot; (1997–2006)===

&quot;A Scare at Bedtime&quot; took its name from the nightly RTÉ show called &quot;A Prayer at Bedtime&quot;, which overlaid the text of a Roman Catholic prayer over serene images with choral music playing. &quot;A Scare at Bedtime&quot;, first aired in 1997, is close to being the polar opposite of this, with extremely adult content, lewd jokes and slightly obscene anecdotes being related by the two puppets. Their origins on the Den are largely ignored, as the backstory gradually established on A Scare at Bedtime, presents them to be both in their fifties (although they don&#x27;t look any different from how they used to), and residing in Ballydung Manor, the former Ballydung Asylum. Rumor has it that their parents left them in the asylum many years ago, and in revenge, Rodge took an axe to them both. But no bodies were ever found. They live with a lunatic nurse that they call &quot;Granny&quot; who practices the black arts (since she is dating Satan, whom they refer to as the &quot;quare fella&quot; throughout the series) and Pox the cat who suffers from rabies, the pox, and extreme violence at the hands of its two owners. Their hobbies include cockfighting and exorcisms of which Father Flange occasionally does special sessions. They have been given full names also: Padraig Judas O&#x27;Leprosy and Rodraig Spartacus O&#x27;Leprosy.

Each episode follows the same pattern: Rodge, the dumber of the two, arrives home. Originally the pair would get into bed but in recent seasons they sit at the kitchen table. They talk about what Rodge was doing, with Podge usually insulting him. This leads Podge on to telling a story (acted out by live actors) about some people (whose names are usually sexual innuendos, e.g. Enda Meshank, Chris Peacock, Ulick McGee) who inevitably come to an unpleasant end. Rodge interrupts the story with stupid comments and/or reference to masturbation. It ends with Podge punishing Rodge for no reason.

&quot;A Scare at Bedtime&quot; never officially ended and the show has run to nine series as of January 2006, with the first five series available on DVD. An eight-disc DVD box set of all nine seasons of 150 episodes (including fifty never for sale before) was released at Halloween 2010. The series has aired in both the UK and Ireland on RTÉ Two, Tara TV, BBC UK Play and the Paramount Comedy Channel. &quot;A Scare at Bedtime&quot; was nominated in the Best Entertainment Programme category of the Irish Film and Television Academy Awards in both 1999 and 2000. Winning the IFTA for Best Entertainment Programme in 2000.

===&quot;Podge and Rodge&#x27;s TV Bodges&quot; (2000)===
In 2000, Podge and Rodge hosted a series made up of ten eight-minute episodes entitled &quot;Podge &amp; Rodge&#x27;s TV Bodges&quot; for BBC Prime. It was a collection of TV mishaps akin to &quot;It&#x27;ll be Alright on the Night&quot;. The series was broadcast all over the world via BBC Worldwide.

===&quot;Ballydung Radio&quot; (2000)===
Podge and Rodge were commissioned by UK Play in 2000 to create a music/comedy hybrid show. 20 x 30min programmes were broadcast. Podge and Rodge hosted the series from their home made pirate radio studio set up in Ballydung Manor. The show featured pop videos of the moment in between comedy links performed by the duo.

===&quot;RTÉ Two relaunch (2004)&quot;===
Podge and Rodge hosted the relaunch of Network 2 as RTÉ Two in 2004. They introduced the night&#x27;s television programming which consisted of &quot;The Premiership&quot; at 20:00 followed by a highlights reel of Network 2, new comedy sketch show &quot;Stew&quot; at 21:30, a repeat broadcast of the final episode of &quot;Paths to Freedom&quot; and the television premiere of the film &quot;Spin the Bottle&quot;. The relaunch was part of an RTÉ initiative to promote &quot;edgier&quot; and &quot;riskier&quot; viewing that would &quot;push the boundaries&quot;, which included a gay theme night.

===&quot;The Podge and Rodge Show&quot; (2006–2010)===

First aired on 6 February 2006, The Podge and Rodge Show fulfilled the duo&#x27;s main aim by being their first chats how. It was co-hosted by Lucy Kennedy and airs at 22:30 on Monday and 22:50 on Tuesday nights on RTÉ Two. The show has been a phenomenal ratings success, regularly getting over 400,000 viewers a show. It won &quot;Favourite Irish TV Show&quot; for two years in a row at the 2006 and 2007 TV Now Awards. It was also nominated for an IFTA Award for &quot;Best Entertainment Show 2007&quot; and won the award in 2008. The second series began on RTÉ Two on 16 October 2006, with a month break in January before returning on 5 February 2007 and running until April 2007. A third series, began on 15 October 2007 and ran until 15 April 2008 with a month break in January. The fourth series kicked off on 20 October 2008 without Lucy Kennedy, who was replaced by weekly female guest hosts. The show again took a break over Christmas and returned on 9 February 2009 for a further 10-week run with Caroline Morahan as the new host until 14 April 2009. Which turned out to be the final episode of the series as it was announced that a new format &quot;Podge &amp; Rodge&#x27;s Stickit Inn&quot;, a celebrity pub quiz would replace the chat show in the Autumn 2009 schedule. However, the show returned in the Stickit Inn pub set in 2010, and ran until 27 April 2010.

====Christmas special====

Podge and Rodge hosted a special show from Ballydung Manor on 19 December 2006, entitled &quot;A Frightmare Before Christmas&quot;. It celebrated Christmas from their perspective, a reality where none of the intended guests turned up, and imaginary scenarios where the worst possible guests did. In reality Podge and Rodge and Lucy were left in the darkness of Ballydung Manor as the thunder raged outside, imagining their nightmare guests.

====New Year&#x27;s Eve specials====

Podge and Rodge rang in 2007 on 31 December in a special programme lasting over forty minutes instead of the usual thirty-minute format. The New Year&#x27;s Eve show was called &quot;Bogmanay&quot; (a play on Hogmanay). It was broadcast on RTÉ Two from 22:30.

On it the boys looked back at some of the highlights of their year. They also handed out their very own Feckin&#x27; Eejit of the Year Awards (FEEJITs) to celebrate the great tradition of Irish Feckin&#x27; Eejitry. There were nine nominees chosen from the worlds of TV, entertainment, sport and politics.

Guests included Edele and Keavy Lynch of B*Witched fame, Mary Black, Jason Donovan and Freddie Starr returned as the Ballydung Butler for the evening.

Such was the success of the original &quot;Bogmanay&quot;, Podge and Rodge hosted a second &quot;Bogmanay&quot; to ring in 2008. It featured guests Miss Ireland, Bláthnaid McKenna and boxer Frank Bruno as well as Mr. Gest who was unable to be interviewed as Lucy Kennedy, venturing into his dressing room, discovered he had turned into an ape. Instead, a number of previously unseen clips which were not allowed to be shown before midnight were shown, including some in which Lucy Kennedy swore. A number of &quot;Half- Arse Hero&quot; awards were handed out, although none of the recipients (who included Steve Staunton) were present to accept them.

====People in Need Telethon 2007 special====
On Friday 26 October 2007 for the People in Need Telethon Podge and Rodge finally got to interview their nemesis and ultimate rival, the then host of &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; and &quot;Ireland&#x27;s Alan Partridge&quot; Pat Kenny. &quot;Do the words lamb and slaughter mean anything to you?&quot; He was asked: &quot;Does it get on your tits though when people are saying, Jaysus – Pat Kenny earns how much? He should be paying me to watch that shite!&quot; He was also asked: &quot;Where did the nickname Pat the Plank come from? Who came up with that beauty?&quot; Pat blamed it on Eamon Dunphy. &quot;Are you bored with the wood puns?&quot; they asked to which Pat jibed: &quot;In fairness lads I&#x27;m not the puppet round here.&quot; Then it was time for a quick game of &quot;Plankety Plank&quot; which featured author Patricia Cornwell – he&#x27;d forgotten her name; Dawn French – he&#x27;d told her he&#x27;d give her €10 not to get out of bed; Brigitte Nielsen – she&#x27;d forced him to dance live on TV. Comparing Pat&#x27;s bike to Gaybo&#x27;s Harley-Davidson they asked: &quot;Did Fisher Price make that?&quot; And then it was back to Tubbicino, Teletubby.

====Best of The Podge and Rodge Show====
From 21 July 2009, RTÉ began showing a compilation of the best moments of the first three series of &quot;The Podge and Rodge Show&quot;. Ten half-hour episodes were produced and aired on RTÉ 2 at 10.30 pm.

===&quot;Podge and Rodge&#x27;s Stickit Inn&quot; (2009)===

As part of the new Autumn line-up on RTÉ Two it was announced that the Ballydung brothers returned in a new venue of a pub set. &quot;Podge &amp; Rodge&#x27;s Stickit Inn&quot;; began as a celebrity pub quiz, but reverted to a late night chat and music entertainment show. The dirty duo are joined by a new female co-host in the shape of a busty Italian barmaid to be played by Virginia Macari and their resident musician Johnny Dorgan, the man with the organ.

===&quot;The Podge and Rodge Show&quot; (2018)===
It was announced on 16 August 2018 that Dorieann Garrihy would be joining Podge and Rodge as their new co-host. The series began broadcasting on 22 October 2018.

<text>The Ritan is a public park located in Chaoyang District, Beijing, China. It is within the Jianguomen area. The nearest Beijing Subway station is Yong&#x27;anli on the Beijing subway Line 1. The park was initially home to the Temple of the Sun (), an altar built in 1530 during the late Ming Dynasty.

==History==
The altar was built in 1530 during the late Ming Dynasty for use in ritual sacrifice to the sun by the Emperor of China. The original Altar of the sun was a rectangular white-stone dais covered with red glaze, and four stairways (north, east, south and west) with nine steps measuring in width and length, and in height. The temple had been destroyed and restored to reopen in 1556 to the public.

Upon entering the premises, the emperors would pass through the Heavenly West Gate and along the Sacred Way that led to the sun altar.

The temple was abandoned in 1911. Its park was renamed Ritan (or Ri Tan) Park in 1949 and reopened in 1951. In the 1970s, the Ritan Park became part of the embassy district of the city. In the 1980s, the park was restored and expanded southwards with the Quchi Shengchun garden (or Yuxin garden), and the Sun Mural was installed in the park to commemorate the opening policies of Deng Xiaoping and the end of Maoist policies.

During the 2008 Summer Olympics, it was selected as one of the three protest zones.

==Description==
The area surrounding the Ritan temple is now a public park, and the site features extensive gardens and a small lake. On the opposite side of Beijing, to the west, is the Temple of the Moon, located in Fuchengmen. There is a Sino-Japanese Friendship Monument in the park, but it is hard to spot and not well indicated.

The Shen Ku and Shen Chu is the place where the tablets of the temple were found. The Qinghui pavilion is the high point with a panoramic view of the park. Below the pavilion is a pond with rockies, a café (the Stone Boat café), much lotus... Many people visit the park in the morning to practice tai chi or other forms of physical or spiritual exercises.

The park is free of charge and open 24 hours a day. Restaurants and snacks are available inside the park.

<doc id="1016593" wikidata="Q1190467" url="?curid=1016593" title="Jungle warfare">
<text>Jungle warfare or woodland warfare is warfare in forests, jungles, or similar environments. The term encompasses military operations affected by the terrain, climate, vegetation, and wildlife of densely-wooded areas, as well as the strategies and tactics used by military forces in these situations and environments.

The jungle has a variety of effects on military operations. Dense vegetation can limit lines of sight and arcs of fire, but can also provide ample opportunity for camouflage and plenty of material with which to build fortifications. Jungle terrain, often without good roads, can be inaccessible to vehicles and so makes logistical supply and transport difficult, which in turn places a premium on air mobility. The problems of transport make engineering resources important as they are needed to improve roads, build bridges and airfields, and improve water supplies. Jungle environments can also be inherently unhealthy, with various tropical diseases that have to be prevented or treated by medical services. The terrain can make it difficult to deploy armoured forces, or any other kind of forces, on a large scale. Successful jungle fighting emphasizes effective small unit tactics and leadership.

Jungle warfare has been the topic of extensive study by military strategists, and was an important part of the planning for both sides in many conflicts, including World War II, the Vietnam War, and the Nicaraguan Revolution.

==History==

===Pre-modern===
Throughout world history, forests have played significant roles in many of the most historic battles. For example, in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest between the Romans and the Germanic tribes in 9 AD, the Germans used the forest to ambush the Romans. In ancient China, the Chinese Empire planted forests on its strategic borderland to thwart nomadic attacks. For example, the Northern Song dynasty (960–1127) constructed and maintained an extensive defensive forest in present-day Hebei.

In the Amazon rainforest, there were fighting and wars between the neighboring tribes of the Jivaro. Several tribes of the Jivaroan group, including the Shuar, practised headhunting for trophies and headshrinking.

===Nicaragua guerillas===

===World War II===
====Conventional jungle warfare====

At the start of Pacific War in the Far East, the Japanese Imperial Forces were able to advance on all fronts. In the Malayan Campaign, time and again they infiltrated through the jungle to bypass static British positions based on road blocks so that they could cut the British supply line and attack their defences from all sides.

In early 1942, the fighting in Burma at the start of the Burma Campaign took on a similar aspect and resulted in one of the longest retreats in British military history. Most members of the British Indian Army left Burma with the belief that the Japanese were unstoppable in the jungle.
The Chindits were a special force of 3,500 that in February 1943 launched a deep penetration raid, code-named Operation Longcloth, into Japanese occupied Burma. They went in on foot and used mules to carry supplies. The operation was not a military success but was a propaganda boost for the Allies because it showed that Allied forces could successfully move and fight in jungle terrain well away from roads. On the back of the propaganda success, Orde Wingate, the eccentric commander of the Chindits, was given the resources to increase his command to divisional size and the USAAF supplied the 1st Air Commando Group to support his operations. The availability of air transport revolutionized Wingate&#x27;s operational choices. In February 1944, Operation Thursday was launched, and air transport support supplied 1st Air to allow the Chindits to set up air supplied bases deep behind enemy lines from which aggressive combat patrols could be sent out to interdict Japanese supply lines and disrupt rear echelon forces. That in turn forced the Japanese 18th Division to pull frontline troops from the battle against X Force, which was advancing through Northern Burma, to protect the men building the Ledo Road. When the Japanese closed on a base and got within artillery range, the base could be abandoned and then set up in another remote location. The ability to sustain the bases that relied totally on air power in the coming decades would prove a template for many similar operations.

After the first Chindits expedition, thanks to the training the regular forces were receiving and the example of the Chindits and new divisional tactics, the regular units of the Fourteenth Army started to get the measure of both the jungle and the enemy. Under General Slim, the attitude of training was that the jungle was not another enemy but could be used to their advantage. Comprehensive protection against disease particularly malaria, was instigated. There was also a change in the attitude to the weather; previously both sides stopped operations in the monsoon season but the Commonwealth troops were now expected to move and fight during the wet season.

When the Japanese launched their late 1943 Arakan offensive they infiltrated Allied lines to attack the 7th Indian Infantry Division from the rear, overrunning the divisional HQ. Unlike previous occasions on which this had happened, the Allied forces stood firm against the attack and supplies were dropped to them by parachute. The Japanese travelled lightly intending to resupply from captured material. In the Battle of the Admin Box from 5 February to 23 February, the Japanese were unable to comprehensively break into the heavily-defended box that contained the divisional supplies while the defenders were able to resupply and bring tanks into operation. The Japanese switched their attack to the central front, but again, the British fell back into defensive box of Imphal and the Kohima redoubt. In falling back to the defensive positions around Imphal, the leading British formations found their retreat cut by Japanese forces, but unlike previously, they took that attitude that the Japanese who were behind them were just as cut off as the British. The situation maps of the fighting along the roads leading to Imphal resembled a slice of marble cake, as both sides used the jungle to outflank each other. Another major change by the British was that use of air support both as an offensive weapon to replace artillery and as a logistical tool to transport men and equipment. For example, the 5th Indian Infantry Division was airlifted straight from the now-quieter Arakan front up to the central front and were in action within days of arriving. By the end of the campaigning season, both Kohima and Imphal had been relieved, and the Japanese were in full retreat.

The lessons learnt in Burma on how to fight in the jungle and how to use air transport to move troops around would lay the foundations of how to conduct large-scale jungle campaigns in future wars.

====Unconventional jungle warfare====

Immediately after the fall of Malaya and Singapore in 1942, a few British officers, such as Freddie Spencer Chapman, eluded capture and escaped into the central Malaysian jungle, where they helped to organize and train bands of lightly-armed local ethnic Chinese communists into a capable guerrilla force against the Japanese occupiers. What began as desperate initiatives by several determined British officers probably inspired the subsequent formation of the above-mentioned early jungle-warfare forces.

The British and the Australians contributed to the development of jungle warfare as the unconventional, low-intensity, guerrilla-style type of warfare understood today. V Force and Force 136 were composed of small bodies of soldiers and irregulars, equipped with no more than small arms and explosives but were rigorously trained in guerrilla warfare-style tactics, particularly in close-quarters combat, and fought behind enemy lines. They were joined in Burma by American led Kachin guerrillas were armed and coordinated by the American liaison organisation, OSS Detachment 101, which led, armed, and co-ordinated them.

Another small force operating in the Far East was the Australian-led Z Special Unit, which carried out a total of 81 covert operations in the South West Pacific theatre, some of which involved jungle warfare.

===Cold War===
====British experience during Malayan Emergency====
After the war, early skills in jungle warfare were further honed in the Malayan Emergency, when in 1948 guerrilla fighters of the Malayan Communist Party (MCP) turned against the Commonwealth. In addition to jungle discipline, field craft, and survival skills, special tactics such as combat tracking (first using native trackers), close-quarter fighting (tactics were developed by troopers who were protected only with fencing masks and stalked and shot each other in the jungle training ground with air rifles), small team operations (which led to the typical four-man special operations teams) and tree jumping (parachuting into the jungle and through the rain forest canopy) were developed from Borneo&#x27;s native Iban people to actively take the war to the Communist guerrillas, instead of reacting to incidents that were initiated by them.

Of greater importance was the integration of the tactical jungle warfare with the strategic &quot;winning hearts and minds&quot; psychological, economic, and political warfare as a complete counter-insurgency package. The Malayan Emergency was declared over in 1960, as the surviving Communist guerrillas were driven to the jungle near the Thai border, where they remained until they gave up their armed struggle in 1989.

====Cuban Revolution====
====Brazilian military government guerrilla====
====Portuguese Colonial War====
In the 1960s and early 1970s, Portugal was engaged in jungle warfare operations in Africa against the independentist guerrillas of Angola, Portuguese Guinea and Mozambique. The operations were part of what is collectively known as the &quot;Portuguese Colonial War&quot;. In fact, there were three different wars: the Angolan Independence War, the Guinea-Bissau War of Independence and the Mozambican War of Independence. The situation was unique in that small armed forces, those of Portugal, conducted three large-scale counterinsurgency wars at the same time, each in a different theatre of operations and separated by thousands of kilometres from the others. For those operations, Portugal developed its own counterinsurgency and jungle warfare doctrines. In the counterinsurgency operations, the Portuguese organized their forces into two main types, the grid (&quot;quadrilha&quot;) units and the intervention units. The grid units were each in charge of a given area of responsibility in which they were responsible to protect and keep the local populations from influence from the guerrillas. The intervention forces, mostly composed of special units (paratroopers, marines, commandos etc.) were highly-mobile units that were used to conduct strategic offensive operations against the guerrillas or to temporary reinforcing grid units under heavy attack.

====Vietnam War====
The British experience in counterinsurgency was passed onto the Americans during their involvement in the Vietnam War, where the battlegrounds were again the jungle. Much British strategic thinking on counterinsurgency tactics in a jungle environment was passed on through BRIAM (British Advisory Mission) to South Vietnam headed by Sir Robert Thompson, a former Chindit and the Permanent Secretary of Defense for Malaya during the Emergency.

The Americans further refined jungle warfare by the creation of such dedicated counterinsurgency special operations troops as the Special Forces (Green Berets), Rangers, Long Range Reconnaissance Patrols (LRRP), and Combat Tracker Teams (CTT).

During the 8 years of active U.S. combat involvement in the Vietnam War (1965–1973), jungle warfare became closely associated with counter insurgency and special operations troops.

However, although the American forces managed to have mastered jungle warfare at a tactical level in Vietnam, they were unable to install a successful strategic program in winning a jungle-based guerrilla war. Hence, the American military lost the political war in Vietnam for failing to destroy the logistics bases of the Viet Cong and the Vietnamese People&#x27;s Army along the Ho Chi Minh Trail.

With the end of the Vietnam War, jungle warfare fell into disfavor among the major armies in the world, namely, those of the U.S.-led NATO and the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact, which focused their attention to conventional warfare with a nuclear flavor that was to be fought on the jungleless European battlefields.

American special operations troops that were created for the purpose of fighting in the jungle environment, such as LRRP and CTT, were disbanded, and other jungle-warfare-proficient troops, such as the Special Forces and Rangers, went through a temporary period of decline until they found their role in counterterrorism operations in the 1980s.

====Central American Crisis====


===Post-Cold War===

The end of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s marked the beginning of the end of a number of proxy wars that had been fought between the superpowers in the jungles of Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia. In the euphoria at the end of the Cold War, many Western nations were quick to claim the peace dividend and reinvested resources to other priorities.

Jungle warfare was reduced in scope and priority in the regular training curriculum of most conventional Western armies. The nature of major military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia saw the need to put an emphasis upon desert warfare and urban warfare training in both the conventional and the unconventional warfare models.

==Jungle units and training schools==
The following military and police forces have specialized units that are trained and equipped to conduct jungle warfare:
* : the Argentine Army has four companies of &quot;Cazadores de Monte&quot; (Jungle Hunters).
* : the Brazilian Army has six Jungle Infantry Brigades: 1st, 2nd, 16th, 17th, 22nd and 23rd Jungle Infantry Brigades and others units, and the Jungle Warfare Training Center (CIGS). Brazilian Special Forces, Commandos, Parachute Infantry and Marine Corps are trained in jungle warfare too. The SOF of some State Military Police Forces, like the Military Police of São Paulo&#x27;s Comandos e Operações Especiais, the Military Police of Minas Gerais&#x27;s Batalhão de Operações Especiais (BOPE)/COMAF, the Military Police of Rio de Janeiro&#x27;s Batalhão de Operações Policiais Especiais (which has an agreement with the CIGS) and the Military Police of Maranhão&#x27;s Companhia de Operações de Sobrevivência em Área Rural (COSAR) has training or are specialized in jungle operations. Jungle artillery is made by the 1st and the 10th Jungle Field Artillery Group.

* : The U.S. Army 25th Infantry Division is the primary jungle warfare unit in its size. The 25th Infantry Division conducts military operations primarily in the Asia-Pacific region; it also operates the Jungle Operations Training Course, Jungle Environment Working Group, and the Lightning Academy Jungle School.

==Jungle warfare training==
===India===
The Counter-Insurgency and Jungle Warfare School (CIJWS) located in Vairengte, Mizoram, India, is the primary jungle warfare training center for Indian forces.

===Brazil===

The Jungle Warfare Training Center (CIGS) in Brazil is the primary jungle warfare training center for Brazilian forces. They seek to copy the capacities of units of homologous commands.

===United States===
The Jungle Operations Training Center (JOTC) located at Schofield Barracks in Oahu, Hawaii is the primary jungle warfare training center for American forces. Opened in its present rendition in 2013, JOTC is operated by the 25th Infantry Division and primarily trains personnel of the 25th Infantry Division, special forces, and foreign partners. Hawaii was chosen as the location for JOTC due to its climate, geography, capacity, and operational history in jungle training within the Pacific.
Jungle warfare training is not new to this organization in Hawaii or the United States. During World War II the JOTC, also known as the Pacific Combat Training Center, was established in Hawaii to teach soldiers survival and fighting skills in tropical environments. Over 300,000 U.S. military personnel were trained in jungle fighting prior to deploying throughout the Pacific. Between 1956 and 1965, this same installation in Hawaii was home to the Jungle and Guerilla Warfare Training Center followed by the Recondo School from 1971 to 1979. The U.S. Asia-Pacific Rebalance Strategy necessitated jungle warfare training for the U.S. military be increased in priority. JOTC&#x27;s revival at its original location in Hawaii is in part due to closure of the Fort Sherman, Panama JOTC location in 1999. 

Another jungle warfare training center, Camp Gonsalves, is operated by the United States Marine Corps on northern Okinawa Island, Japan.

==Early life==
Delahunt attended St Andrew&#x27;s Saltcoats secondary school for six years between 1974 and 1980. After leaving school, he went on to study Business at Glasgow Caledonian University for four years, where he graduated with a bachelor of arts (BA) qualification in 1984.

==Career== 
Delahunt started his journalism career as a racing columnist on the Scottish Farmer in 1984, two years later he eventually started a full-time journalism career on the Kilmarnock Free Press in 1986 before joining West Sound Radio the following year, and was launch editor of The Daily Winner sports paper in 1988. He went from there to Radio Clyde for two years, and joined Scottish in 1990, where he was a sports presenter/correspondent on the lunchtime and evening editions of Scotland Today for around eight years until 1998, during this time, he also presented the racing reports on &quot;Scotsport Extra Time&quot; throughout the early-mid 1990s and presented a spin-off programme to Scotsport on satellite and cable TV called The Football Show that aired on the short-lived channel Sky Scottish between November 1996 until that channel ceased broadcasting in May 1998.

As well as presenting Scotsport, Delahunt had been racing correspondent of the Sunday Herald since its launch in February 1999, and had been a racing columnist on The Scottish Farmer since 1984

Delahunt joined Setanta Sports in August 2006 after more than eight years as anchorman of STV&#x27;s sport programme &quot;Scotsport&quot;, where he presented all of Setanta&#x27;s live and highlights coverage of Scottish football until Setanta Sports ceased broadcasting in June 2009.

On 17 September 2008, Delahunt returned to STV for a short period as a freelance anchor of the station&#x27;s UEFA Champions League highlights shows. In 2010 he began reporting on Scottish Premier League games for ESPN.

In 2010 he was announced as the new &#x27;anchorman&#x27; of Radio Clyde&#x27;s Superscoreboard football phone in programme for season 2010–11. In March 2015, Delahunt resigned from his job at Radio Clyde after being found guilty of drunk driving.

He writes a column for the Scottish Sun, focusing on betting tips for football and horse racing, one of his main passions since childhood.

==Personal life==
Jim&#x27;s main sporting interests are football, horse-racing, golf and boxing. He played schools and amateur football to the age of 22 in 1984 and collected six winner&#x27;s medals at school and youth level with St Andrews Academy and Ardrossan Boys&#x27; Club.

He has been riding horses since the age of 16 in 1978 but only took out an amateur riders&#x27; flat racing licence at the advanced age of 33 in 1995. He competed in about a dozen races, with two third places at Hamilton his best efforts on some very slow horses.

Jim&#x27;s sporting heroes are Muhammad Ali and Lester Piggott - who he was delighted to have met both. He referred to it as &quot;lovely stuff&quot;.

<text>Vyacheslav Konstantinovich von Plehve (; – ) was a Russian politician who served as the director of the police from 1881 to 1884 and later as the minister of the interior from 1902 until his assassination in 1904.

== Biography ==
Born in Meshchovsk, Kaluga Governorate, Russia, on 20 April 1846, Plehve was the only son of schoolteacher Konstantin von Plehve and Elizaveta Mikhailovna Shamaev, daughter of a minor landowner. In 1851, Plehve&#x27;s family moved from Meshchovsk to Warsaw in Russian-controlled Congress Poland, where his father accepted a job as an instructor in a gymnasium.

After studying law at Moscow University, he joined the Ministry of Justice in 1867. He served as assistant prosecutor in the Vladimir circuit court and as a prosecutor in Vologda. In 1876, he was appointed assistant prosecutor of the Warsaw Chamber of Justice, and in 1879 as prosecutor of the Saint Petersburg Chamber of Justice.

In 1881, he investigated the murder of Alexander II and then joined the Interior Ministry as a Director of the Department of Police, also in charge of the Secret Police. He is credited with the destruction of numerous &quot;People&#x27;s Will&quot; terrorist groups.

He became a member of the Governing Senate in 1884 and assistant minister of the Interior in 1885. As an assistant minister, at first under Count Dmitry Tolstoy (in office 1882-1889) and later under his successor, Ivan Durnovo (in office 1889-1895), Plehve had shown definite administrative talent.

Made an Actual Privy Counsellor in 1899, he was Finnish Minister Secretary of State from that year until 1904. He supported the abolition of the separate Finnish army in 1901.

In April 1902, following the assassination of Dmitry Sipyagin, Plehve was appointed minister of the interior and chief of Gendarmes. After a brief attempt at conciliation with the &quot;zemstvo&quot; conservatives failed, he relapsed—disbanding the police-supported labour unions (&quot;zubatovshchina&quot;). The same year, Plehve used his position as minister of interior to insist that Hirsh Lekert, who had tried to assassinate the governor of Vilnius, Victor von Wahl, be tried under wartime law. This virtually guaranteed a death-sentence.

In August 1903, Plehve met with Theodor Herzl in Saint Petersburg and discussed the establishment of Zionist societies in Russia. He proposed a Russian government request to the Ottoman Turks to obtain a charter for Jewish colonisation of Palestine.

Plehve became a target for Jewish revolutionaries after his meeting with Theodor Herzl although he had forwarded Herzl&#x27;s proposals to Tsar Nicholas II.

After Plehve did nothing to prevent a bloody wave of anti-Jewish violence in 1903, the known double-agent Yevno Azef decided not to inform the Tsarist authorities of the plans of the Socialist Revolutionary Party to kill Plehve. He survived one attack in 1903, and two in 1904, before the Socialist-Revolutionary Combat Organization succeeded. On 28 July 1904, Plehve was travelling on his way to his weekly audience with the Emperor. At in Saint Petersburg, Igor Sazonov, a member of the Socialist Revolutionary Party, threw a bomb into Plehve&#x27;s horse-drawn carriage, killing him at the age of 58.

==Legacy==
Because Plehve carried out the Russification of the provinces within the Russian Empire, he earned bitter hatred in Poland, in Lithuania and especially in Finland. He despoiled the Armenian Apostolic Church, and was credited with being accessory to the Kishinev pogroms. His logical mind and determined support of the autocratic principle gained the tsar&#x27;s entire confidence. He opposed commercial development on ordinary European lines on the ground that it involved the existence both of a dangerous proletariat and of a prosperous middle class equally inimical to autocracy.

<text>The Bull of Union with the Copts, also known as Cantate Domino after its incipit, was a bull promulgated by Pope Eugene IV at the Ecumenical Council of Florence on 4 February 1442. It was part of an attempt by the Catholic Church to reunite with other Christian groups including the Coptic Church of Egypt. The attempted union with the Copts failed.

The Bull of Union with the Copts denounced Christians who continued to observe the practices of circumcision, the Jewish sabbath and &quot;other legal prescriptions as strangers to the faith of Christ&quot; as practiced by the Copts.

<text>Lindesberg () is a locality and the seat of Lindesberg Municipality, Örebro County, Sweden with 9,672 inhabitants in 2017.

== History ==

Lindesberg has centuries old history, being the center of an old mining district. The earliest known traces of a town are in the foundations of the 14th century stone church. That town was however known as Lindesås. It got its charter and current name in 1643, granted by Queen Christina, making it one of the now defunct Cities of Sweden. The name &quot;lind&quot; means the linden tree (Br. Eng. lime tree), which is why the coat of arms depicts a tree. The mining district Lindesberg was mentioned on the 16th century grand map Carta Marina.

==Notability==
Between 1996 and 2007, the Augustibuller punk festival had been held in Lindesberg. The festival attracted more visitors each year and some of the bands who played were Desmond Dekker, Charged GBH, Bad Manners, Napalm Death and The Perishers. Due to low number of visitors in 2007, the planning for a 2008 festival began late and did not attract enough people to buy tickets. This eventually led to cancellation of 2008 festival, and later bankruptcy for the non-profit organization behind the festival. No more festivals were held after 2007.

The Tormek AB factory is located here, where they produce water-cooled sharpening systems for edged tools, which are exported world-wide.

==Sport==
*IFK Lindesberg are an association football team who play at Fotbollsgatan 11.
*Lindebygdens Orienteringsklubb (orienteering) is adjacent to the football ground.
*Lindesbergs Golf Club is situated south of the locality.
*The Linde MSK Lindarna motorcycle speedway club are based north west of the locality at Hidingen 230. The track formerly known as the Motorbanen Hagalund hosted qualifying rounds of the Speedway World Championship in 1972, 1973, 1975 and 1976 and the team Lindarna raced in the Swedish Speedway Team Championship, winning division 2 in 1982..

<text>Nora is a locality and the seat of Nora Municipality, Örebro County, Sweden with 10,611 inhabitants in 2024.

==History==
Nora received its charter in 1643. The government had requested the inhabitants of both Nora and the adjacent town Lindesberg to move together into a newly chartered city called Järle. However, the government proved unsuccessful, and instead granted both Nora and Lindesberg independent charters at that year.

Many wooden houses built in the 18th and 19th century have been spared from fires and demolition, making the town Nora one of Sweden&#x27;s best preserved wooden towns. Eksjö and Hjo are two other examples, and they have together with Nora initiated a wooden-town development project.
Also part of the old city structure are cobbled streets with small houses and shops by small windling street. Anna Maria Lenngren, a Swedish poet, once proclaimed &quot;Så liten stad, så mycket smak&quot; (Such small town, so much taste).

The first normal gauge railway in Sweden was opened to the public in 1856 between Nora and Ervalla. It is today a museum railway, worked by a preservation society.
