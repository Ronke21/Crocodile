<text>Sovereign Grace Churches (SGC, previously Sovereign Grace Ministries and People of Destiny International) is a group of reformed, continuationist, and confessionalist Christian churches primarily located in the United States. Sovereign Grace believes that churches should exist in a close partnership with one another and describe themselves as a family of churches. In addition to the U.S. congregations, there are also congregations in Mexico, Australia, Bolivia, Ethiopia, Great Britain, Germany, and many other countries.

== History ==

The organization of over 80 member churches grew out of the charismatic renewal of the 1970s under the leadership of Larry Tomczak. It has its roots in a charismatic prayer meeting in Silver Spring, Maryland, then Washington, DC, called Take and Give (TAG), which grew into Covenant Life Church, the former flagship of Sovereign Grace. Tomczak co-founded the church with C. J. Mahaney. Mahaney describes himself as a &quot;former pothead.&quot; Larry Tomczak withdrew from the Charismatic scene shortly before the creation of Covenant Life Church.

In 1981, Brent Detweiler, pastor of Indiana Christian Fellowship in Indiana, Pennsylvania, asked Mahaney and Tomczak to provide oversight and accountability for his church. The two churches formed an informal church-planting partnership. In 1982, shortly after planting a church in Cleveland, Mahaney, Tomczak and Detweiler formed People of Destiny International as an umbrella organization for their various ministries. The original apostolic team comprised Mahaney, Tomczak, Detweiler and Bill Galbraith. Tomczak and Mahaney and the movement were influenced by Bryn Jones and Terry Virgo, leaders of the British New Church Movement. Both Tomczak and Mahaney spoke at New Frontiers&#x27; Bible Weeks and Stoneleigh Conference.

They were also friendly with Maranatha Campus Ministries for a period. In &quot;The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Modern Christian Thought&quot; published in 1995, Alister McGrath associated PDI with the Shepherding Movement and described it as having &quot;informal links with Bryn Jones&quot;, the UK house church leader. In the mid-1990s, while Tomczak was still involved in the group&#x27;s leadership, religious anthropologist Dr. Karla Poewe wrote that &quot;Vineyard is particularly attractive to the young and intellectual... People of Destiny serves a Catholic constituency&quot; although participants at that time would not agree with this assessment, contrasting PDI with the Vineyard Church. The theological focus gradually shifted during the mid-1990s and it was later suggested that the increasing New Calvinism of PDI was a major factor in Larry Tomczak&#x27;s departure from the movement.

Although reconciled with C. J. Mahaney in 2011, Tomczak earlier described the parting of ways with Sovereign Grace Ministries as &quot;an unbelievable nightmare&quot; during which his family &quot;were threatened in various ways if [they] did not cooperate with [PDI/SGM]... A letter was circulated in an attempt to discredit me and to distort the events surrounding my departure.&quot; Other notable charismatic figures, such as Lou Engle, founder of The Call prayer concerts, and Ché Ahn, pastor of Harvest Rock Church in Pasadena, California, also ceased to be formally associated with PDI during this period. As of 2008 the group identified itself as &quot;a family of churches passionate about the gospel of Jesus Christ... with a strong doctrinal basis that is evangelical, Reformed, and continuationist.&quot; This move towards Reformed (or Calvinist) doctrine is illustrated by Sovereign Grace&#x27;s partnerships with Reformed theologians—such as John MacArthur, Mark Dever, and John Piper—in events like the Together for the Gospel Conferences. In the summer of 2009, Detweiler, who had left the SGM board in 2009, released a series of documents detailing numerous grievances with Mahaney, including concerns about Mahaney&#x27;s leadership style. On July 6, 2011, Mahaney announced that he would be taking a leave of absence as a team reviewed charges brought against him of &quot;pride, unentreatability, deceit, sinful judgment, and hypocrisy.&quot; One of the purposes for this period included reconciliation with former SGM ministers. Larry Tomczak reported that Mahaney had gone out of his way to rebuild their relationship after 13 years of estrangement. On January 25, 2012, Mahaney was reinstated as president of the organization by the board after three review panels found no reason to disqualify him from his role as president, or to &quot;call into question his fitness for gospel ministry.&quot;

Early in 2012, Sovereign Grace Ministries announced their intention to relocate their headquarters from Gaithersburg, Maryland, to Louisville, Kentucky, citing Louisville&#x27;s lower cost of living as well as the growing connection with the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in town. Some critics have suggested that the move may have more to do with the fractured state of the organization&#x27;s relationship with the SGM flagship church, Covenant Life Church in Gaithersburg. Later in 2012, the movement&#x27;s former flagship, Covenant Life Church, departed from SGM, a decision supported by an overwhelming 93% of voting members. Additionally, the Sovereign Grace churches in Indiana and Altoona, PA, Sarasota and Daytona Beach, FL and Charlottesville, VA cut ties with the movement during this period. Daytona Beach&#x27;s pastor Jesse Jarvis noted a &quot;leadership culture characterized by excessive authority and insufficient accountability&quot; as rationale for the church&#x27;s departure. The Indiana church was one of the charter members of SGM. About 80 churches from the United States and around the world remained in the organization. By March, 2013 approximately 20 churches had left Sovereign Grace Ministries. During that same month C.J. Mahaney announced &quot;that he would step down as president of SGM&#x27;s beleaguered network of churches.&quot;

In January 2015, Joshua Harris, leader of SGM&#x27;s former flagship church Covenant Life Church, resigned as lead pastor, saying he planned to attend seminary to pursue more formal education and connection to other branches of Christianity. He believed that &quot;the isolation of Covenant Life, and of a small cluster of churches of which it was a part, may have fed leadership mistakes, including the decision of pastors—himself among them—to handle a child sexual abuse case internally instead of going to police.&quot;

=== History of name changes ===

Sovereign Grace Churches was known as &quot;People of Destiny International&quot; until 1998. British restorationist leader Terry Virgo says that Larry Tomczak and C. J. Mahaney, leaders at the time, had become &quot;increasingly uncomfortable&quot; with the &quot;People of Destiny International&quot; name, and it became &quot;PDI Ministries&quot;. In 2002, the group adopted its next name of &quot;Sovereign Grace Ministries.&quot; In December 2014, executive director Mark Prater announced that the group&#x27;s name would change to &quot;Sovereign Grace Churches&quot;, to reflect its newly changed structure.

== Church planting ==

Church planter Fred Herron described the PDI/SGM church planting method of founding new churches: a pastor leads a group of members to relocate to a different city and form, or &quot;plant&quot;, a new church. The first church adoption was in Cleveland Ohio. North Coast Church formerly called Crossroads Christian Community was founded in 1980. It was a growing fellowship of 200 people but lacked the apostolic oversight for greater growth. Co-pastors Steve Witt and Bob Cohen invited an &quot;Apostolic Team&quot; the fall of 1980 to come and assist in &quot;apostolic restructuring.&quot; Steve Witt&#x27;s father had been influential in Larry Tomczaks salvation and transfer from Cleveland to DC area. A team arrived in April 1981 of 11 people, including Tomczak and family. They stay one year and returned to DC leaving behind a team to monitor and build North Coast Church. North Coast thrived and grew until its ultimate demise decades later. For many years, PDI did not adopt existing churches, but later altered its policy. SGM adoption of an existing church begins with the development of a relationship with leadership and continues with dialogue to evaluate the doctrinal and practical compatibility of Sovereign Grace with the church desiring adoption.

== Sovereign Grace Music ==

Sovereign Grace Churches also operates Sovereign Grace Music, based in Louisville, Kentucky, where contemporary worship albums have been released every few years since the 1980s. Sovereign Grace Music is directed by worship leader Bob Kauflin, former member of Christian band Glad, and is known for lyrics that are founded in biblical doctrine. Kauflin employs many other songwriters and pastors from other churches to aid in the songwriting process for Sovereign Grace Music. In 2011, Sovereign Grace Music&#x27;s album &quot;Risen&quot; charted at No. 41 on the Billboard Top Christian Albums chart. Since then, five other albums have charted, the highest being &quot;From Age To Age&quot; (2012) at No. 25.

== Claims of abuse cover-up ==

In late 2012, a lawsuit in Montgomery County, Maryland was brought against Sovereign Grace Ministries, making accusations of a conspiracy to cover-up child sex abuse. The plaintiffs claimed that church leaders, including Mahaney, did not report accusations of misconduct to the police. Larry Tomczak, a co-founder of SGM, who left the organization in the late 1990s, was alleged to have abused and assaulted a child in the form of administering corporal punishment over a period of twenty-five years. Tomczak was investigated and no charges were filed against him. All of the others who were named in the lawsuit, including Covenant Life Church pastors in Maryland, Sovereign Grace employees, and Fairfax Church in Virginia, were also investigated by law enforcement and no charges were brought. The plaintiffs only asked the court to determine whether or not there had been a conspiracy to cover up abuse. Judge Burrell found that any conspiracy to cover-up should have been brought within the time frame of the alleged abuse. Therefore, all of the claims by the Maryland plaintiffs were dismissed in May 2013 because the statute of limitations had expired, three years after each turned 18; the claims by two Virginia plaintiffs were still within the statute of limitations. An appeal of the lower court&#x27;s decision was heard by the Maryland appellate court in May 2014, and the lawsuit was again dismissed when the court found that the Plaintiff&#x27;s attorney had filed the appeal too early. Maryland&#x27;s highest civil court, the Court of Appeals, denied certiorari on September 24, 2014, permanently ending the case. All charges brought by the Maryland plaintiffs were dismissed by Maryland Circuit Judge Sharon Burrell, permanently barring plaintiffs from ever bringing those or related charges in Maryland civil court again at any time in the future. During the hearing, Judge Burrell referred to an affidavit filed by Brent Detwiler supporting the claims of the plaintiffs as &quot;vague and irrelevant&quot;. The court also found that the &quot;Covenant Life School&quot; sued by the plaintiffs did not exist during the time frame of the alleged abuse. As reported in &quot;Time&quot; magazine (February 2016), Susan Burke, the lawyer for the victims, plans to file another lawsuit in Virginia, involving the two individuals from that jurisdiction. As of January 2018, two years later, no such lawsuit has been filed.

=== Maryland State Senate committee hearings (March 2016) ===

On March 8, 2016, two individuals testified before the Maryland State Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee regarding the Sovereign Grace Ministries lawsuit. Charlotte Ennis, a member of the church, testified that the lawsuit was, &quot;an egregious, and even bizarre, $50 million class action suit alleging child sexual abuse and cover up that was undoubtedly false.&quot; According to Ennis, the lawsuit originally asked for $50 million in damages, but as the deposition and discovery process went on, &quot;the plaintiffs tried hard to settle out of court for a much lower sum&quot;. She testified that the defense had refused to settle out of court requiring that the case be heard in court on its merits. As a result, the case was dismissed. Ennis testified only about the Maryland plaintiffs. (Ennis testified that in addition to her personal involvement with the Palmer situation she had a professional background as a Research Manager for a news organization).

1. In the Palmer case, brought by Renee Palmer Gamby, Ennis testified that, 
Documentation was found showing the family of one plaintiff was immediately advised to notify authorities. Witnesses (I was one) were prepared to testify under oath to that fact. That child was abused at age 2 by a babysitter whose case was criminally prosecuted in 1993.

2. In the case brought by Robin Roe (pseudonym), Ennis testified that, Another church plaintiff was never abused, (her sister was abused by her father who was prosecuted in 1987), but that plaintiff claimed the church had incarcerated her, ruining her life. Actually, she was charged and imprisoned by state and federal authorities for crimes of fraud, theft, drug possession, drug trafficking, and weapons concerns. Predictably, the judge questioned her very legitimacy as a plaintiff. The actual victim did not participate in that lawsuit.

(Allegation Number 57 of the lawsuit reads, As a result of the Church&#x27;s conduct and misrepresentations, Robin Roe was not cared for by loving and responsible adults, but instead was incarcerated in a juvenile half-way house with criminal juveniles.)

3. Ennis testified that, &quot;A third plaintiff eventually withdrew her allegations, admitting they were false.&quot;

4. Regarding the alleged pedophile ring at the church&#x27;s school Ennis testified that, Investigators found that the supposed ringleader teacher was not even at the school for the majority of that year. He was in the hospital because his back was so bad he couldn&#x27;t walk. The actual teacher was the accuser&#x27;s own mother. The allegations included closets and rooms that did not match those in the school building. To date the police have filed no charges against anyone in that case. Ennis testified that regarding the three plaintiffs alleging charges of multiple cases of child sex abuse and rape at the church school, &quot;Not one of those plaintiffs has filed criminal charges even though there is no criminal statute of limitations in Maryland. False criminal charges can result in a jail term or hefty fine, however.&quot; Ennis went on to testify that an &quot;extensive and undoubtedly expensive&quot; investigation was conducted by the Montgomery County Police Department but no charges were ever filed. A subsequent examination of the case, conducted by an independent investigator, found that the allegations of child sex abuse detailed in the lawsuit &quot;likely never happened at all&quot; (except for the two which had been promptly reported and prosecuted several decades earlier).At the same Senate hearing another individual, Terry Mayo, also testified. Mayo testified that her husband was one of the accused in the Sovereign Grace lawsuit and that &quot;she and her husband had experienced the nightmare of false accusations.&quot; His accuser was plaintiff Heather Thompson Bryant. Mayo testified, 

In 2013, in a lawsuit against our church, a woman accused my husband and three others of molesting her twenty-five years earlier. She didn&#x27;t remember the alleged “abuses” before her thirties, and then believed she was recovering lost memories. She also imagined that 18 people witnessed the abuse, and she listed them by name. However, none of those named supported her stories of abuse. Montgomery County police investigated and filed no charges. After eighteen months, an independent investigator concluded her accusations likely never happened. But that didn&#x27;t spare us from a witch hunt. In the initial months, the accused were labeled child sex offenders and the story of the abuse, truth be damned, was aggressively promoted in news, radio and social media.
1) We received online threats that flyers would go out to our neighbors, “informing” them of the “pedophile” at our address. 
2) Anonymous calls were made to business clients, threatening them for doing business with us.
3) Online forums ripped us to shreds.
4) Minor children, suffocated by public reaction, suffered horribly. 
5) An un-accused spouse was laid off and later denied another job.
6) People withdrew from us, or fell silent.
7) Questions harassed us: Could we lose everything financing a defense?
Mayo also testified that her &quot;husband had contemporaneous records from the 1980s that refuted the allegations.&quot; Mayo said, at the close of her Senate Committee testimony, &quot;I was burned by sexual abuse in the early 70s; we’re being burned by the false accusation of it now. An internet lynch mob can go on forever, but the law should protect innocent people from legal charges they can’t defend, like those from the distant past. The current statute gives survivors sufficient time for litigation, and a lifetime to bring charges to criminal court. Survivors and non-survivors alike need legal protection. The law as it stands, does both. Until you’ve experienced your life ripped open by false accusations, please consider that what happened to us can happen to anyone. That puts this proposal squarely in the category of more-harm-than-good.&quot; Ennis said, during her Senate Committee testimony, that she was in favor of extending the statute of limitations for child sexual abuse, but that the proposed 2016 bill, SB 69, did not have &quot;enough teeth&quot; to prevent lawsuits based on false accusations against individuals or organizations. Pam Palmer, who organized the lawsuit and is also the mother of plaintiff Renee Palmer Gamby, was present and testified at the March 8, 2016 Maryland Senate Committee Hearing in favor of SB 69. They died in committee following the hearing. The following year a new bill, HB 642, was introduced and passed by the Maryland State Legislature. HB 642, the first bill of its kind to be supported by the Catholic Church in Maryland, extended the statute of limitations to 20 years after the age of majority, but makes it much more difficult to implicate a church or civic organization in a child sex abuse civil suit after the plaintiff turns 25. That bill was signed into law by Maryland Governor Larry Hogan on March 4, 2017.

=== &quot;Washingtonian Magazine&quot; article ===

A story in &quot;Washingtonian Magazine&quot;, by Tiffany Stanley, dated February 14, 2016, highlights three families who were plaintiffs in the lawsuit and their involvement with Sovereign Grace Ministries. The article quotes Plaintiff&#x27;s attorney, Susan Burke, saying that she &quot;plans to file a new suit in Virginia against the Fairfax church on behalf of at least two plaintiffs.&quot; As of January 2018, two years later, no new lawsuit has been filed.

=== Covenant Life apology ===
Leaders of the Fairfax, Virginia, church accused in the lawsuit have &quot;acknowledged the stories of abuse and issued a tearful apology to the families... senior pastor Mark Mullery blamed the church’s model of reconciliation. &#x27;This resulted in the victim’s family being corrected when they should have been gently cared for as sufferers,&#x27;” he said, according to the &quot;Washingtonian Magazine&quot; article.

=== Nathaniel Morales ===
In a different case in 2014, Nathaniel Morales, a youth mentor at Covenant Life Church, who &quot;led youth bible studies, directed worship teams, and even attended sleepovers,&quot; was convicted of abusing four boys between 1983 and 1991. &quot;Between 1990 and 2007 at least five members of the church’s staff were told of Morales’s abuse. None notified the police.&quot; Subsequently, Covenant Life Church former pastor Grant Layman [Mahaney&#x27;s brother-in-law] said, while testifying about allegations against Nathaniel Morales, that he [Layman] had not reported the abuse to the police. Layman was not on trial and was not given an opportunity to clarify his remarks in court. Pastors are not mandatory reporters in the State of Maryland. An independent investigator reported that Morales was never a paid employee of Covenant Life Church. Ennis testified before the Maryland Senate Committee that no one had testified during the Morales trial that the church had advised them not to report. In November 2013, SGM issued a statement saying that, years after pastoral counsel was sought, &quot;allowing courts to second guess pastoral guidance would represent a blow to the First Amendment.&quot; Regarding the accuracy of the plaintiffs&#x27; claims, SGM released a statement saying that &quot;SGM is not in a position to comment on the specific allegations at this time, but upon review it appears the complaint contains a number of misleading allegations, as well as considerable mischaracterizations of intent.&quot;

<doc id="1026476" wikidata="Q439243" url="?curid=1026476" title="Cassie Steele">
<text>Cassandra Rae Steele (born December 2, 1989) is a Canadian actress and singer known for portraying Manny Santos on &quot;&quot; and Abby Vargas on &quot;The L.A. Complex&quot;. In 2014, she played Sarah in the MTV horror television movie &quot;The Dorm&quot;. She also voices Tammy Gueterman and Tricia Lange in Adult Swim&#x27;s &quot;Rick and Morty&quot;.

==Early life==
Steele is of British descent on her father&#x27;s side and Filipina descent on her mother&#x27;s side. She began crafting her own songs to go with her poetry when she was in the first grade, she then began taking singing lessons. She attended London School of Dance in Scarborough, Ontario, and trained in ballet and jazz dance. She was also a gymnast for an unspecified amount of time.

==Career==
===2001–2010: &quot;Degrassi: The Next Generation&quot; and early work===
In 2001, Steele first appeared in a Fib Finder commercial alongside Cristine Rotenberg. She later, that year, appeared on an episode of &quot;Relic Hunter&quot; as the ten-year-old version of Sydney Fox.

Since she was eleven years old, Steele appeared as a regular cast member on &quot;&quot; playing the character of Manny Santos. She played the role for nine years, before exiting the show in 2010. She has also appeared in three &quot;Degrassi&quot; TV films: &quot;Degrassi Spring Break Movie&quot;, &quot;Degrassi Goes Hollywood&quot; and &quot;Degrassi Takes Manhattan&quot;.

During the filming of Degrassi, Steele also starred in the Disney film &quot;Full Court Miracle&quot; as well as the MTV movie &quot;Super Sweet 16: The Movie&quot; and &quot;My Babysitter&#x27;s a Vampire&quot; and had recurring roles in &quot;The Best Years&quot; and &quot;Instant Star&quot;.

Steele has also embarked on a music career. Her debut album, &quot;How Much for Happy&quot;, was released in 2005, followed by two Canadian tours.

===2011–present: &quot;The L.A. Complex&quot; and other projects===
In 2011, Steele was cast as Abby Vargas in the series &quot;The L.A. Complex&quot;, which premiered on CTV and Much Music on January 10, 2012, and aired regularly on Much Music. On the same day as the premiere, the series was officially picked up by The CW to begin airing in the United States in the spring. It was renewed for a second season, which aired simultaneously on both Much Music and The CW that summer. &quot;The L.A. Complex&quot; was officially cancelled on December 20, 2012.

On April 17, 2012, Steele released the extended-play &quot;Shifty&quot; to iTunes. On April 1, 2014, her single &quot;Mad&quot; was released to iTunes. The official lyric video premiered on her VEVO page one day prior.

Since 2014, she has had recurring role on the adult animated series &quot;Rick and Morty&quot; as Tammy Guetermann and Tricia Lange. She starred as Valerie Vont in the Lifetime film &quot;Sorority Surrogate&quot; with fellow &quot;Degrassi&quot; star Daniel Kelly, which was released on March 22, 2014. She would appear as Sarah in the film &quot;The Dorm&quot; later that year. 

On August 12, 2014, Steele released the album &quot;Patterns&quot; to iTunes. The official video for &quot;Games&quot; was released the same year on September 1, and it premiered on her VEVO page. Steele released the single &quot;Power&quot; shortly afterwards. It was released to iTunes on October 21, 2014. 

In 2018, she appeared in Drake&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Upset&quot; music video, which takes place during a &quot;Degrassi&quot; reunion.

Steele started the band &quot;psychocandy&quot; with Glint member Jase Blankfort in August 2019. Their single &quot;Hunger&quot; is available to stream on SoundCloud. On January 1, 2020, the band posted a photo on a new account on Instagram with the caption &quot;2020.&quot;

In 2019, it was reported that Steele would voice the titular character in the Disney film &quot;Raya and the Last Dragon&quot;. On August 27, 2020, however, Steele was replaced by Kelly Marie Tran.

In 2022, Steele released a sustainable thong line in collaboration with designer Rachael Finley. The clothing line was inspired by Steele&#x27;s infamous outfit in &quot;Degrassi&quot;, where Manny arrives to school wearing a visible thong.

==Personal life==
Steele married American actor Trent Garrett in 2018. In December 2020, Garrett filed for divorce from Steele.

Steele&#x27;s first child, a son, was born in November 2023 with boyfriend Favi Martinez. They reside in Colorado.

Her sister is actress Alex Steele, who also starred on &quot;&quot; as Angela Jeremiah and Tori Santamaria.

<text>A heavy tank is a tank classification produced from World War I to the end of the Cold War. These tanks generally sacrificed mobility and maneuverability for better armour protection and equal or greater firepower than tanks of lighter classes.

== Role ==
Heavy tanks achieved their greatest, albeit limited, success when fighting lighter tanks and destroying fortifications. Heavy tanks often saw limited combat in their intended roles, instead becoming mobile pillboxes or defensive positions, such as the German Tiger I and Tiger II designs, or the Russian KV and IS designs.

== Design ==
Heavy tanks feature very heavy armor and weapons relative to lighter tanks. Many heavy tanks shared components with lighter tanks. For example, the US M103 heavy tank shared many components with the lighter Patton tank, including transmission and engine. As a result, they tend to be either underpowered and comparatively slow, or have engine and drive train reliability issues. In case of an entirely new design development, which was the case with the German Tiger I, designs often became needlessly complex and costly, resulting in low production numbers. Although it is often assumed that heavy tanks suffered inferior mobility to medium tanks, this was not always the case, as many of the more sophisticated heavy tank designs featured advanced suspension and transmissions to counteract this drawback. As mentioned previously, heavy tanks are often extremely expensive and resource-intensive to produce and operate. The German Tiger I, for example, had similar speed and better terrain-handling characteristics when compared to its main competitor, the significantly lighter Panzer IV medium tank. However, low reliability and limited resources meant that just 1,347 were produced, compared to roughly 8,800 Pz.Kpfw. IV.

== History ==
The origins of the class date to World War I and the first tank designs, which were intended to operate in close concert with infantry.

Virtually all early tanks possessed thick armor to allow them to survive in no man&#x27;s land. As lighter and more maneuverable designs were introduced during the Interwar period, these larger vehicles with stronger defensive and offensive capabilities became known as &quot;heavy&quot; tanks.

Heavy tanks had gradually progressed from their trench warfare and bunker destroying role to dedicated anti-tank purposes by the onset of World War II. Heavy tanks saw limited deployment by France at the beginning of the war, and were only ever used in conflict by Nazi Germany and the USSR from about 1943 to the war&#x27;s end.

This tank type remained a decisive factor in the early years of the Cold War. The purpose of heavies would not change until their replacement by the main battle tank. Often referred to as MBTs, these designs effectively filled all roles required by armies, thus rendering more specialized designs obsolete.

=== World Wars ===
The first British tank, the Mark I of World War I, was introduced to break through German defensive lines of trenches and barbed wire. When lighter, faster tanks were introduced, the larger tanks were classified as heavy.

The French Char 2C was one of the largest tanks ever produced. At the start of World War II, France and the Soviet Union were the only countries to have inventories of heavy tanks, such as the Char B1, T-35, and KV-1. The Matilda II was designed under the British infantry tank concept, which is similar to the heavy tank, having thick armour and tending to weigh more than their other tanks. However, it is usually considered separate because infantry tanks generally had less firepower, with their cruiser tanks (comparable to mediums) at the time having the same main armament but more machine guns. Later war examples were the German Tiger I and II, as well as the Soviet IS series. Note that &quot;heavy&quot; versus &quot;medium&quot; is more a question of tactical roles than weight; the Panther, for example, was a &quot;medium&quot; tank that outweighed most Allied &quot;heavy&quot; tanks.

American forces rarely fielded heavy tanks, as they still held on to the infantry-support doctrine like the British; in addition, the Americans recognized the logistical and mobility issues that came with possessing a heavy tank force and did not want to compromise its supply line to Europe. The M6 heavy tank was designed in 1940 but held few advantages over medium tanks and planned production of several thousand was stopped. The Anglo-American T14 heavy tank project started in 1941 did not deliver a pilot model until 1944.
The US preferred to use tank destroyers (mobile but relatively lightly armoured vehicles) for anti-tank defence, and prior to 1944 there were few indications that the US M4 Sherman was outclassed in terms of armor and weapons by German heavy tanks which were few in number. Near the end of World War II, a few early model M26 Pershings were sent to Europe to gain combat experience. Aside from these the closest the Americans came to putting a heavy tank into service were up-armored M4 Sherman &quot;Jumbos&quot; which were used as assault guns.

Both the US and UK developed very well-armoured and armed tanks intended for assaulting heavily defended areas - the T28 GMC and &#x27;Tortoise&#x27; had casement designs and weighed around 80 tonnes but did not enter service.

=== Cold War ===
The immediate post-war period saw the final fielding of heavy tanks, including the US M103 heavy tank, the British FV214 Conqueror, and the French ARL 44 (in very limited numbers for the ARL 44), all in response to the Soviet heavy tanks of the period. The largest tank guns were approaching maximum calibre whose shell could still be handled by the crew, even using awkward two-part ammunition (separate projectile and propellant case, similar to battleship guns), which greatly slowed their rate of fire. Thanks to improved shell designs and fire control technology improving accuracy, postwar medium tanks were catching up to heavy tanks in firepower. The tactical value of heavy tanks thus declined to the point that no new designs were fielded; the heavily armed mediums came to be known as the main battle tank (MBT). Doctrine held that less expensive self-propelled artillery could serve in the infantry support role. The weight of MBTs quickly increased during the Cold War, and most third generation MBTs including the M1 Abrams, Challenger 2, Leopard 2, Merkava, Arjun MBT, and Type 99 have weights similar to those of 1950s heavy tanks.

Older heavy tanks with steel armour were rendered obsolete by anti-tank guided missiles and high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) ammunition. The much more flexible missiles are effective at ranges beyond a tank gun&#x27;s range, and sheer armour mass was no longer a guarantee of survivability against the largest HEAT warheads of tank guns or missiles.

<text>IEEE 802.10 is a former standard for security functions that could be used in both local area networks and metropolitan area networks based on IEEE 802 protocols.

802.10 specifies security association management and key management, as well as access control, data confidentiality and data integrity. 

The IEEE 802.10 standards were withdrawn in January 2004 and this working group of the IEEE 802 is not currently active. Security for wireless networks was standardized in 802.11i.

The Cisco Inter-Switch Link (ISL) protocol for supporting VLANs on Ethernet and similar LAN technologies was based on IEEE 802.10; in this application 802.10 has largely been replaced by IEEE 802.1Q.

The standard being developed has 8 parts: 
:a. Model, including security management
:b. Secure Data Exchange (SDE) protocol 
:c. Key Management
:d. - has now been incorporated in &#x27;a&#x27; -
:e. SDE Over Ethernet 2.0
:f. SDE Sublayer Management
:g. SDE Security Labels
:h. SDE PICS Conformance. 

Parts b, e, f, g, and h are incorporated in IEEE Standard 802.10-1998.

<doc id="1026483" wikidata="Q5105197" url="?curid=1026483" title="List of Choro Q video games">
<text>This is a list of video games based on the Choro Q (also known as Penny Racers in English-speaking markets) line of toy cars produced by Japanese toy company Takara (later Takara Tomy). Some of these games have been localised for Western release under many different names, including Gadget Racers, Penny Racers and Road Trip.

Most of these are auto racing games with extensive opportunities for customization, often including role-playing video game-style elements such as towns and side-quests. Most of these games were developed by external companies like Tamsoft and Barnhouse Effect, although they are usually credited to Takara since the developers&#x27; name rarely appears outside of the ending credits. Only two games in the series were released outside Japan prior to 2001 - &quot;Choro Q&quot; for the PlayStation (released in Europe only as &quot;Penny Racers&quot;) and &quot;Choro Q 64&quot; for the Nintendo 64 (released in North America and Europe as &quot;Penny Racers&quot;). However, afterwards many of the titles have been released in the US and PAL regions as budget titles, by publishers including Conspiracy Entertainment, Midas Interactive Entertainment and Play It!.

<text>Dr. Enuf is an American brand of soft drink bottled by Tri-City Beverage in Johnson City, Tennessee. It is a lemon-lime flavored drink (though its taste is different from common lemon-lime sodas such as Sprite or 7 Up.) Dr. Enuf is fortified with several water-soluble vitamins. Its marketing slogan is &quot;Enuf is Enough!&quot;

Dr. Enuf&#x27;s origins date back to 1949, when a Chicago businessman named William Mark Swartz was urged by coworkers to formulate a soft drink fortified with vitamins as an alternative to sugar sodas full of empty calories. He developed an &quot;energy booster&quot; drink containing B vitamins, caffeine and cane sugar. After placing a notice in a trade magazine seeking a bottler, he formed a partnership with Charles Gordon of Tri-City Beverage to produce and distribute the soda.

==Early product heritage with Mountain Dew==
 Early in its development, Dr. Enuf was reported to have several therapeutic effects, including the easing of stomach pains, relief from hangovers, and a clearing of the mind. One of the early advertised uses of Dr. Enuf, curing hangovers, coincided with Tri-City Beverage&#x27;s other soft drink at the time, a drink mixer called Mountain Dew. Tri-City Beverage later sold the rights to Mountain Dew to Pepsi, but kept the Dr. Enuf brand.

The drink is still produced to this day by Tri-Cities Beverage. Dr. Enuf is available in original, Diet, Herbal and Diet Herbal varieties. A bottle of any of the varieties contains at least 80% of the recommended daily nutritional requirement of thiamine (Vitamin B1), niacin (Vitamin B3), potassium and iodine. The herbal varieties also contain ginseng and guarana, and are cherry flavored.

==Availability==
Dr. Enuf is widely distributed in northeast Tennessee, particularly in the Tri-Cities, plus parts of southwestern Virginia and western North Carolina.

While hard to find, Dr. Enuf is available in select locations throughout the Southeast as well as at many Cracker Barrel locations throughout the country. It is also available at Pal&#x27;s restaurant locations.
As of 2022, Dr. Enuf is also available in Eastern Kentucky.

<text>The World Trade and Convention Centre (WTCC) was a convention centre and office complex in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, adjacent to the Scotiabank Centre. The facility had of meeting space and a 20,000 square foot ballroom. It was replaced by the larger Halifax Convention Centre in 2017, and the building was sold to a private developer.

==History==
The WTCC was championed by then-Premier John Buchanan who boasted to reporters in 1981 that the new facility would serve as a scaled-down version of the famous World Trade Center in New York City, eventually becoming the economic and business capital of Atlantic Canada. An opening ceremony was held on 24 February 1985, for 1,200 invited guests.

Buchanan stated at the time that the centre would generate revenue in &quot;the near future&quot;, but the WTCC and Trade Centre Limited have routinely operated at a deficit over the years.

The convention centre operator has stated that the current facility is insufficiently sized to accommodate demand for larger scale conventions, citing the lack of a dedicated exhibition room and the larger size of comparable facilities elsewhere in the country. In 2008, Trade Centre Limited and the provincial Department of Transportation and Infrastructure Renewal issued an expression of interest for an expanded facility. As a result, TCL is working with a private developer, Rank Inc., to develop a new convention facility.

The Halifax Convention Centre is located within the nearby Nova Centre, which opened in 2017.

In March 2016 the province announced the signing of a 25-year agreement with the developers of the Nova Centre. The WTCC will hence be offered up for sale to private interests for $13.5 million.

The Halifax Regional Municipality declined to purchase the complex from the province. In August 2016, it was announced that the province would sell the building to Halifax developer George Armoyan for $13.5 million.

With funding from the federal, provincial, and city governments, the building is being redeveloped to house a cultural centre with a 1,800-seat performance hall, a cinema, dance studios, media production studios, and office space for non-profit cultural groups. The exterior was to be renovated to house new shops and restaurants, intended to enliven this part of Argyle Street, but developer Armco instead signed a 10-year lease with the federal government. The ground-level commercial spaces will house Service Canada.

==Characteristics==
The convention centre had of meeting space and a 20,000 square foot ballroom.

Its connection to the Downtown Halifax Link connected it to over 1,000 four-diamond guest rooms (within the Halifax Marriott Harbourfront Hotel, the Delta Barrington, Prince George Hotel, the Delta Halifax) with an additional 1,400 hotel rooms in the greater city core, and shopping, dining and entertainment options.

The WTCC was the premier conference facility in the region during its years of operation. The facility was run by Trade Centre Limited, a provincial Crown corporation, and owned by the Province of Nova Scotia.

The convention centre was home to the Nova Scotia Sport Hall of Fame and was located below an office tower housing several provincial departments and Crown corporations, including Nova Scotia Business Inc.

<doc id="1026499" wikidata="Q1331440" url="?curid=1026499" title="Japanese nationalism">
<text>Japanese nationalism is a form of nationalism that asserts the belief that the Japanese are a monolithic nation with a single immutable culture. Over the last two centuries, it has encompassed a broad range of ideas and sentiments. It is useful to distinguish Japanese cultural nationalism from political or state nationalism, since many forms of cultural nationalism, such as those which are associated with folkloric studies, have been hostile to state-fostered nationalism.

In Meiji Japan, nationalist ideology consisted of a blend of native and imported political philosophies, initially developed by the Meiji government to promote national unity and patriotism, first in defense against colonization by Western powers, and later in a struggle to attain equality with the Great Powers.

It evolved throughout the Taishō and Shōwa periods, and was used to justify increasingly extreme ideology, such as fascism, totalitarianism, and overseas expansionism. It has also provided a political and ideological foundation for the actions and atrocities of the Japanese military in the years leading up to and throughout World War II.

Japanese nationalism has been used as justification for revising history textbooks from revisionist perspectives, which denies Japanese imperialist atrocities, including &#x27;comfort women&#x27; and the Nanjing Massacre.

==Meiji era beginnings (1868–1912)==
During the final days of the Tokugawa shogunate, the perceived threat of foreign encroachment, especially after the arrival of Commodore Matthew C. Perry and the signing of the Kanagawa Accord, led to increased prominence to the development of nationalist ideologies. Some prominent &quot;daimyō&quot; promoted the concept of &quot;fukko&quot; (a return to the past), while others promoted &quot;ōsei&quot; (the Emperor&#x27;s supreme authority). The terms were not mutually exclusive, merging into the &quot;sonnō jōi&quot; (revere the emperor, expel the barbarians) concept, which in turn was a major driving force in starting the Meiji Restoration.

The Meiji Constitution of 1889 defined allegiance to the State as the citizen&#x27;s highest duty. The constitution itself contained a mix of political Western practices and traditional Japanese political ideas.

===Basis of economic growth===
The extreme disparity in economic and military power between Japan and the Western colonial powers was a great cause for concern for the early Meiji leadership. The motto &quot;Fukoku kyōhei&quot; (enrich the country and strengthen the military) symbolized Meiji period nationalistic policies to provide government support to strengthen strategic industries. Only with a strong economic base could Japan afford to build a strong, modern military along Western lines, and only with a strong economy and military could Japan force a revision of the unequal treaties, such as the Kanagawa Accords. Government policies also laid the basis of later industrialist empires known as the &quot;zaibatsu&quot;.

===Bushidō===
As a residue of its widespread use in propaganda during the 19th century, military nationalism in Japan was often known as &quot;bushidō&quot; (武士道 &quot;the way of the warrior&quot;). The word, denoting a coherent code of beliefs and doctrines about the proper path of the samurai, or what is called generically &#x27;warrior thought&#x27; (武家思想, &quot;buke shisō&quot;), is rarely encountered in Japanese texts before the Meiji era, when the 11 volumes of the &quot;Hagakure&quot; of Yamamoto Tsunetomo, compiled in the years from 1710 to 1716 where the character combination is employed, was finally published.

Constituted over a long time by house manuals on war and warriors, it gained some official backing with the establishment of the Bakufu, which sought an ideological orthodoxy in the Neo-Confucianism of Zhu Xi tailored for military echelons that formed the basis of the new shogunal government. An important early role was played by Yamaga Sokō in theorizing a Japanese military ethos. After the abolition of the feudal system, the new military institutions of Japan were shaped along European lines, with Western instructors, and the codes themselves modeled on standard models adapted from abroad. The impeccable behavior, in terms of international criteria, displayed by the Japanese military in the Russo-Japanese War was proof that Japan finally had a modern army whose techniques, drilling, and etiquette of the war differed little from that of what prevailed among the Western imperial powers.

The &quot;Imperial Rescript for Seamen and Soldiers&quot; (1890), presented Japan as a &quot;sacred nation protected by the gods&quot;. An undercurrent of traditional warrior values never wholly disappeared, and as Japan slid towards a cycle of repeated crises from the mid-Taishō to early Shōwa eras, the old samurai ideals began to assume importance among more politicized officers in the Imperial Japanese Army. Sadao Araki played an important role in adopting a doctrine of &quot;seishin kyōiku&quot; (spiritual training) as an ideological backbone for army personnel. As Minister of Education, he supported the integration of the samurai code into the national education system.

===Role of &quot;Shinto&quot;===

In developing the modern concepts of and emperor worship, various Japanese philosophers tried to revive or purify national beliefs (&quot;kokugaku&quot;) by removing imported foreign ideas, borrowed primarily from Chinese philosophy. This &quot;Restoration Shintōist Movement&quot; began with Motoori Norinaga in the 18th century. Motoori Norinaga, and later Hirata Atsutane, based their research on the &quot;Kojiki&quot; and other classic Shintō texts which teach the superiority of the Sun Goddess &quot;Amaterasu&quot;. This formed the basis for State Shinto, as the Japanese emperor claimed direct descent from &quot;Amaterasu&quot;. The emperor himself was therefore sacred, and all proclamations of the emperor had thus a religious significance.

After the Meiji Restoration, the new imperial government needed to rapidly modernize the polity and economy of Japan, and the Meiji oligarchy felt that those goals could only be accomplished through a strong sense of national unity and cultural identity, with State Shinto as an essential counterweight to the imported Buddhism of the past, the Christianity and other Western philosophies of the present.

In 1890, the Imperial Rescript on Education was issued, and students were required to ritually recite its oath to &quot;offer yourselves courageously to the State&quot; as well as protect the Imperial family. The practice of emperor worship was further spread by distributing imperial portraits for esoteric veneration. All of these practices used to fortify national solidarity through patriotic centralized observance at shrines are said to have given pre-war Japanese nationalism a tint of mysticism and cultural introversion.

The philosophy became popular during the Second Sino-Japanese War. This came to be regarded by militarists as a doctrine that the emperor was the center of the phenomenal world, lending religious impetus to ideas of Japanese territorial expansion.

===Education===

The principal educational emphasis from the Meiji period was on the great importance of traditional national political values, religion, and morality. The Imperial Rescript on Education of 1890 promoted a return to traditional Confucian values in the hierarchal nature of human relations, with the State superior to the Individual, and the Emperor superior to the State. The Japanese state modernized organizationally but preserved its national idiosyncrasies. The attitude reinforced from 1905 was that Japan was to be a powerful nation, equal at least to the Western powers. During the Shōwa period, the educational system was used for supporting the militarized state and preparing future soldiers.

The government published official textbooks for all levels of students and reinforced that with cultural activities, seminars, etc. Emphasis on the texts such as the &quot;Kokutai-no-hongi&quot; in schools was intended to emphasize the &quot;uniqueness of Japan&quot; from ancient centuries. These cultural courses were supplemented with military and survival courses against foreign invasion.

Apart from indoctrination in nationalism and religion, children and school students received military drills (survival, first aid). These were taken further by the Imperial Youth Federation; college students were trained, and some recruited, for home defense and regular military units. Young women received first aid training. All of these actions were said to be taken to ensure Japan&#x27;s safety and protect against larger and more dangerous countries.

==Nationalist politics==
===Origin of nationalist structures and parties===

In 1882, the Japanese Government organized the Teiseito (Imperial Gubernative Party), one of the first nationalist parties in the country. Starting from the Russo-Japanese War, Japan adopted the moniker &quot;Empire of Japan&quot; (&quot;Dai Nippon Teikoku&quot;), acquiring a colonial empire, with the acquisition of Hokkaido (1869), Ryukyu (1879), Formosa (1895), the Liaodong Peninsula and Karafuto (1905), Joseon (Korea) (1905–10) and the South Seas Mandate islands (1918–19).

The wars against China and Russia were modern and demanded a nationalist expression of patriotic sentiment. From this period, the Yasukuni Shrine (founded in 1869) was converted into a focus for nationalist sentiment and received state patronage until the end of World War II. Yasukuni was dedicated to those Japanese and non-Japanese who had lost their lives serving Japan, and includes all war deaths from domestic and overseas conflicts from 1869 to 1945 (and none from any conflicts since 1945), but also civilians (women and students) and civil administration in colonies and occupied territories.

Between 1926 and 1928, the central government organized the &quot;Peace Preservation Department&quot; (an anti-subversive police section) and prosecuted all local Soviet-sponsored communists who proposed a socialist form of government. The Japanese Army organized the &quot;Kempeitai&quot; (military police service). Dissent was controlled by the usage of political and press repression, with the Peace Preservation Law permitting police to restrict freedom of expression and freedom to assemble.

From 1925 to 1935, the (日本新聞) promoted nationalist ideology and sought to influence the Japanese political landscape. In spite of a relatively small overall circulation, it had wide readership among right-wing politicians and advocated the concept of the divine right of the emperor by vigorously attacking Tatsukichi Minobe&#x27;s “emperor organ theory”.

===Realities of political power===
Since the Meiji restoration, the central figure of the state was the Emperor. According to the constitution, the emperor was Head of State (article 4) and Supreme Commander of the Army and the Navy (article 11). Emperor Hirohito was also, from 1937, the commander of the Imperial General Headquarters. Japanese citizens were rallied to the &quot;Defensive State&quot; or &quot;Consensus State&quot;, in which all efforts of the nation supported collective objectives, by guidance from national myths, history, and dogma — thus obtaining a &quot;national consensus&quot;. Democratic institutions were installed in 1890 with the promulgation of a constitution and continued to acquire legitimacy until the 1920s when they fell into disrepute.

Concerns that irresponsible political parties could have too great an influence over vital military affairs introduced a rule that the Army alone should nominate the Army Minister in civilian government. This permitted the army to have a &quot;de facto&quot; veto over civilian governments by having the power to refuse to nominate a candidate. This policy was introduced in law in 1900 but abolished in 1913. It was reintroduced in 1936, cementing military influence over the government after that time.

The political system of Japan became subverted by the military throughout the 1930s from repeated attempted coups, and independent militarist interventions. The invasion of Manchuria after elements in the army manufactured an incident to justify a takeover was accomplished without instruction from the Tokyo government. This showed the impotence of the civilian government to have any influence over the impulses of the army. Governments become increasingly passive, allowing agency and direction of the state to fall to disparate competing elements of the army. The role of the emperor remained highly prestigious, with various factions competing to advocate their interpretation of what the emperor &quot;truly&quot; wanted.

After the war, scrutiny of the emperor&#x27;s role in the war and militarism intensified. For many historians such as Akira Fujiwara, Akira Yamada, Peter Wetzler, Herbert Bix and John Dower, the work done by Douglas MacArthur and SCAP during the first months of the occupation of Japan to exonerate Hirohito and all the imperial family from criminal prosecutions in the Tokyo tribunal was the predominant factor in the campaign to diminish in retrospect the role played by the emperor during the war. They argue that the post-war view focused on the imperial conferences and missed the numerous &quot;behind the chrysanthemum curtain&quot; meetings where the real decisions were made between Hirohito, his chiefs of staff, and the cabinet. For Fujiwara, &quot;the thesis that the Emperor, as an organ of responsibility, could not reverse cabinet decision, is a myth fabricated after the war.&quot;

===Political ideas===
During the 1920s, right-wing nationalist beliefs became an increasingly dominant force. State support for Shinto encouraged a belief in the mythological history of Japan and thus led to mysticism and cultural chauvinism. Some secret societies took up ultranationalism and Japan-centered radical ideas. They included: &quot;Genyōsha&quot; (Black Ocean Society, 1881), &quot;Kokuryu-kai&quot; (Amur River Society, or Black Dragon Society, 1901), movements dedicated to overseas Japanese expansion to the north; &quot;Nihon Kokusai Kai&quot; (Japanese Patriotic Society, 1919), founded by Tokoname Takejiro; &quot;Sekka Boshidan&quot; (Anti-Red League) founded at the same time as the Japanese Communist Party; and the &quot;Kokuhonsha&quot; (State Basis Society) founded in 1924 by Baron Hiranuma Kiichirō, for the preservation of the unique national character of Japan and its special mission in Asia.

Some of the nationalist ideas can be attributed to the ideologue Ikki Kita (1885–1937), an Amur River Society member. In his 1919 book &quot;An Outline Plan for the Reorganization of Japan&quot;, Kita proposed a military &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; to promote the supposed true aims of the Meiji Restoration. This book was banned, but certain military circles read in it in the early 1930s. Kita&#x27;s plan was phrased in terms of freeing the Emperor from weak or treasonous counselors. After suspending the constitution, and dissolving the Diet, the Emperor and his military defenders should work for a &quot;collectivist direct voluntarism&quot; to unify people and leaders. Harmony with the working classes would be sought by the abolition of the aristocracy and austerity for the Imperial House. Overseas, Japan would free Asia of Western influence. The Amur River Society was later instrumental in the Manchurian incident. 

===Political nationalist movements===
The Japanese Navy was in general terms more traditionalist, in defending ancient values and the sacred nature of the Emperor; the Japanese Army was more forward-looking, in the sense of valuing primarily strong leadership, as is evidenced by the use of the &quot;coup&quot; and direct action. The Navy typically preferred political methods. The Army, ultimately, was the vehicle for the hyper-nationalists, anti-communists, anticapitalists, antiparliamentarians, and Nationalist-Militarist ideals.

The military was considered politically &quot;clean&quot; in terms of political corruption, additionally assuming responsibility for &#x27;restoring&#x27; the security of the nation. The armed forces took up criticism of the traditional democratic parties and regular government for many reasons (low funds for the armed forces, compromised national security, weakness of the leaders). They were also, by their composition, closely aware of the effects of economic depression on the middle and lower classes, and the communist threat.

Both branches gained power as they administered the exterior provinces and military preparations.

===Nationalist right in the 1920s===
Other nationalist rightist groups in the 1920s were the &quot;Jinmu Kai&quot; (Emperor Jimmu Society), &quot;Tenketo Kai&quot; (Heaven Spade Party), &quot;Ketsumeidan&quot; (Blood Fraternity) and &quot;Sakura Kai&quot; (Cherry Blossom Society). This last was founded by Dr. Shūmei Ōkawa, professor of the Colonization Academy, and radical defender of expansionism and military armed revolution at home. Amongst members were Army officers implicated in the Manchuria Affair, such as Kingoro Hashimoto, and Ishikawa Kanishi. Okawa served as a conduit by which Kita Ikki&#x27;s ideas reached young nationalist officers on the right.
Violent &quot;coups&quot; took place, and the Kwantung Army made, in effect unilaterally, the decision to invade Manchuria. This was then treated as a &quot;fait accompli&quot; by Government and Emperor. 

===Doctrines===
The Amau Doctrine (the &quot;Asian Monroe Doctrine&quot;) stated that Japan assumed the total responsibility for peace in Asia. Minister Kōki Hirota proclaimed &quot;a special zone, anti-communist, pro-Japanese and pro-Manchukuo&quot; and that Northern China was a &quot;fundamental part&quot; of Japanese national existence, in announcing a &quot;holy war&quot; against the Soviet Union and China as the &quot;national mission&quot;.

During 1940 Prince Konoe proclaimed the &quot;Shintaisei&quot; (New National Structure), making Japan into an &quot;advanced state of National Defense&quot;, and the creation of the &quot;Taisei Yokusankai&quot; (Imperial Authority Assistance Association), for organizing a centralized &quot;consensus state&quot;. Associated are the government creation of the &quot;Tonarigumi&quot; (residents&#x27; committees). Other ideological creations of the time were the book &quot;Shinmin no Michi&quot; (臣民の道), the &quot;Imperial Way&quot; or &quot;War Party&quot; (&quot;Kodoha&quot;) Army party, the &quot;Yamato spirit&quot; (&quot;Yamato-damashii&quot;), and the idea of &quot;hakko ichiu&quot; (which directly translates to &quot;8 corners under one roof&quot;, that means, &quot;one house in which every people can live&quot; or &quot;everyone is family&quot;), &quot;Religion and Government Unity&quot; (&quot;Saisei itchi&quot;), and &quot;Kokka Sodoin Ho&quot; (General Mobilization Right).

The official academic texts included &quot;Kokutai no Hongi&quot; and &quot;Shinmin no Michi&quot;. Both presented a view of Japan&#x27;s history and the Japanese ideal to unite East and West.

===Geostrategy===
The economic doctrines of the &quot;Yen block&quot; were in 1941 transformed to the &quot;Great Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere&quot; Plan, as a basis for the Japanese national finances, and conquest plans. There was a history of perhaps two decades behind these moves.

The Japanese theorists, such as Saneshige Komaki, concerned with Mainland Asia, knew the geostrategic theory of Halford Mackinder, expressed in the book &quot;Democratic Ideas and Reality&quot;. He discussed why the &#x27;World Island&#x27; of Eurasia and Africa was dominant, and why the key to this was the &#x27;Central Land&#x27; in Central Asia. This is protected from sea attack, by deserts and mountains, and is vulnerable only on its west side, and to advanced technology from Europe.

Mackinder declared that: &quot;Who rules East Europe commands the Heartland; Who rules the heartland commands the World-Island; Who rules the World-Island commands the World&quot;. These central Asiatic lands included: all of the Soviet Union, except the Pacific coast, west of the Volga River; all Mongolia, Sinkiang, Tibet and Iran. This zone is vast and possesses natural resources and raw materials, does not possess major farming possibilities, and has a very little population. Mackinder thought in terms of land and sea power: the latter can outflank the former, and carry out distant logistical operations, but needs adequate bases.

These geopolitical ideas coincided with the theories of Lieutenant Colonel Kanji Ishiwara, sent in 1928 to Manchuria to spy. The Army was on the Strike North Group side. The Navy, on the other hand, was interested in the southerly direction of expansion. An extended debate ensued, resolved in the end by the stern experience of Japan&#x27;s armed conflicts with the Soviet Union in 1938–39. This tipped the balance towards the &#x27;South&#x27; plan and the Pearl Harbor attack that precipitated the Pacific War in 1941.

===Other ideological lines===
The Showa Studies Society was another &quot;think tank&quot; for future leaders of a radical totalitarian Japan, led by Count Yoriyasu Arima. He was a supporter of radical political experiments. With Fumimaro Konoe and Fusanosuke Kuhara, they created a revolutionary radical-right policy.

These revolutionary groups later had the help of several important personages, making reality to some certain ideas of the nationalist-militarist policy with practical work in Manchukuo. They included General Hideki Tōjō, chief of Kempeitai and leader of Kwantung Army; Yosuke Matsuoka, who served as president of the (South Manchuria Railway Company) and Foreign Affairs Minister; and Naoki Hoshino, an army ideologist who organized the government and political structure of Manchukuo. Tojo later became War Minister and Prime Minister in the Konoe cabinet, Matsuoka Foreign Minister, and Hoshino chief of Project departments charged with establishing a new economic structure for Japan. Some industrialists representative of this ideological strand were Ichizō Kobayashi, President of Tokio Gasu Denki, setting the structure for the Industry and Commerce ministry, and Shōzō Murata, representing the Sumitomo Group becoming Communication Minister.

Other groups created were the Government Imperial Aid Association. Involved in both was Colonel Kingoro Hashimoto, who proposed a Nationalist single party dictatorship, combined with a state-run economy. The militarists had strong support from the wealthy owners of major industries.

The &quot;New Asia Day&quot; celebration was to remember the sacred mission of extending influence to nearby Asian nations.

The Japanese government, possibly following the German example of a &quot;Worker&#x27;s Front&quot; State Syndicate, ultimately organized the Nation Service Society to group all the trades unions in the country. All syndicates of the &quot;Japanese Workers Federation&quot; were integrated into this controlling body.

===Control of communications media===

The press and other communication media were managed under the Information Department of the Home Ministry. Radio Tokyo was charged with disseminating all official information around the world. The radio was transmitted in English, Dutch, three Chinese dialects, Malay, Thai, as well Japanese to Southeast Asia; and the Islamic world had programs broadcast in Hindi, Burmese, Arabic, English, and French. In Hawaii, there were radio programs in English and Japanese. Other daily transmissions were to Europe, South and Central America, eastern areas of South America, and the US, with Australia and New Zealand receiving broadcasts too.

The official press agency Domei Tsushin was connected with the Axis powers&#x27; press agencies such as DNB, Transoceanic, the Italian agency Stefani and others. Local and Manchukoan newspapers such as &quot;Manchurian Daily News&quot; (Japanese-owned) were under the control of these institutions and only published officially approved notices and information.

==Nationalist symbology==

===Shiragiku (the chrysanthemum) ===


The &quot;shiragiku&quot; (lit. &quot;white chrysanthemum&quot;) or more common chrysanthemum flower was much used as an imperial symbol. It alludes to the Chrysanthemum Throne, the traditional seat of Japanese emperors.

===Banzai===
The traditional cheer was given to the Emperor and other dignitaries, or on special commemorations, was &quot;Tenno Heika Banzai&quot; (天皇陛下万歳 or 萬歲, &#x27;long live the Emperor&#x27;) or the shortened form, &quot; Banzai&quot;.

The latter term, which means &quot;ten thousand years,&quot; is an expression of Chinese origin (万歳) adopted by the Japanese in the Meiji period. In its original sense, it is meant to represent an indeterminably lengthy time and is used to wish long life to a person, state, or project. As co-opted by the Japanese, it originally was simply used in this sense to wish long life to the Emperor (and by extension the Japanese state). As the war progressed, it became the typical Japanese war cry or victory shout and was used to encourage Imperial troops in combat.

===Other nationalist symbols===
*Flag of Japan
*Rising Sun Flag
*Good Luck Flag (signed war banner)
*Five-point star badge (Imperial Japanese Army symbol)
*Cherry blossom badge (with or without anchor) (Imperial Japanese Navy symbol)
*Hachimaki headband
*Senninbari (&quot;One-thousand stitch belt&quot;)
*Kimigayo (His Imperial Majesty&#x27;s Reign)
*Umi Yukaba 
*Yasukuni Shrine

==Post-war developments==

In February 1946, General Douglas MacArthur was set the task of drafting a model constitution to serve as a guide for the Japanese people. The U.S. intention was to ensure that the sources of Japanese militarism were rooted out through fundamental reforms of the Japanese government, society, and economic structure. Perhaps the most lasting effect that came out of this constitution is Article 9 that reads:

: &quot;Aspiring sincerely to an international peace based on justice and order, the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as a means of settling international disputes. To accomplish the aim of the preceding paragraph, land, sea, and air forces, as well as another war potential, will never be maintained. The right to belligerency of the state will not be recognized.&quot;

With the renunciation of war and military power, Japan looked to the United States for security. As the Cold War began, the United States fostered a closer relationship with Japan due to the latter&#x27;s strategic location in respect to the USSR. Japan became, as stated by the Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, an &quot;unsinkable aircraft carrier&quot; for the United States. Ensuing from this close relationship with the United States, Japan hoped that in time their country would become the &quot;third leg in a triangle involving two superpowers.&quot; While the mainstream Japanese politics maintained a pro-American attitude, scholars noted that the nationalist &#x27;&quot;Other&quot;&quot; during post-war Japan was the United States. Left-wing nationalists criticized the United States&#x27;s military presence whilst the conservative nationalists criticized the imposed military limitation by the United States. China later substituted the United States as the nationalist &quot;Other&quot; in contemporary Japanese politics .&quot;&#x27; In academia, some scholars argue that postwar Japanese intellects and politicians constructed the mono-ethnic identity through public discourses and education. Japanese elites&#x27; tendency towards homogeneity and ethnic nationalism is from their desire to differentiate postwar Japanese identity from pre-war imperialist identity and multi-ethnic identity that include formerly colonized ethnic groups.

Since the 1960s, economic growth in the Japanese miracle periods started to mitigate public distrust towards the central government. Japanese economic progress after World War II undermined the appeal of pre-war militarist nationalism, showing a path to prosperity was possible without colonies. The 1970s witnessed Japan&#x27;s adoption of three fundamental tenets that would seek to define and direct Japanese internationalism, all concerning the need for Japanese initiatives in fostering a liberal internationalism. Some criticism points out that politicians in the 1970s selectively remembered the past, preferring narratives of Japan as atomic weapon victim to consciously and unconsciously alienate Japan from its undesired aggressive past. Some scholars note the apolitical nature of the 1964 Tokyo Olympics and the 1970 Osaka World Exposition, which allow politicians to forge Japan as peaceful and internationalist for a unified national identity.

The rather implicit elite advocacy of conservative nationalism has become more salient since the 1990s, where regional competitions from Asian tigers, and later China, created economic anxieties which reflected in political divisions. Many scholars have pointed out that the liberal internationalism has started to turn into conservative revisionist nationalism since the 1990s. The clashes of nationalism and the contemporary rise of ultra-nationalism, accompanied by military expansions and historical revisionism, are the hot topics of current academic discussions on post-war Japanese nationalism. The illiberal turn of nationalism started with new right-wing movements that created history textbooks from revisionist perspectives, which denies Japanese imperialist atrocities, including &#x27;comfort women&#x27; issues and Nanjing Massacre. Their emergences can be seen as a direct discontent towards pacifists&#x27; low posture to former colonized countries but also motivated by economic anxiety in globalization. Although right-wing movements surfaced in the 1990s, the Japanese public still remain largely pacific.

Since the 2000s, xenophobic online posts and nationalist claims against foreigners, mostly Chinese and Koreans, have risen due to anxieties over economic growth, regional competition, and globalization. Prime ministers Junichiro Koizumi and Shinzo Abe&#x27;s visits to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine has created huge controversies and received international backlashes. Japanese top political leaders have started to adopt more explicit conservatism nationalist stances and expansionist military ambitions. Abe tended to use ambiguous terms to describe his national agenda on controversial issues such as history education and intentionally avoided backlash from the public to equate him as an imperial leader. In order to justify military expansions, Abe framed his security agenda as proactive pacifism, enabling Japan to exercise collective self-defense. Japan&#x27;s remilitarization is mostly due to security concerns of North Korea&#x27;s nuclear weapon program and China&#x27;s rise in the East, as well as aligning with the US&#x27;s aim to create alliances to contain China&#x27;s global rise and deter North Korea&#x27;s nuclear threat. Both the Obama administration and the Trump administration encouraged Japan&#x27;s rearmament. Trump openly called for rapid Japanese rearmament, more due to discontent that the US support Japan while Japan does not have to do anything in return, less on prudence. Some scholars argue that the resurgence of ultra-nationalist tendency as solely an elite-driven process as the public remains pacifist, and overall public support is not required for politicians to achieve a nationalist agenda because of the low voter turnout.

== Ethnic nationalism ==
==Ultranationalism==
Ultranationalism values the emperor&#x27;s authority around the &#x27;state&#x27; and advocates the militaristic agenda. There are differences of opinion among Japanese liberal scholars on whether or not Japan&#x27;s ultranationalist movements can be viewed as &quot;fascism&quot;.

===Uyoku dantai===

In 1996, the National Police Agency estimated that there were over 1,000 extremist right-wing groups in Japan, with about 100,000 members in total. These groups are known in Japanese as &quot;Uyoku dantai&quot;. While there are political differences among the groups, they generally carry a philosophy of anti-leftism, hostility towards China, North Korea, South Korea and occasionally the United States of America, and justification of Japan&#x27;s role in World War II. &quot;Uyoku dantai&quot; groups are well known for their highly visible propaganda vehicles fitted with loudspeakers and prominently marked with the name of the group and propaganda slogans. The vehicles play patriotic or wartime-era songs.

Activists affiliated with such groups have used Molotov cocktails and time bombs to intimidate moderate politicians and public figures, including former Deputy Foreign Minister Hitoshi Tanaka and Fuji Xerox Chairman Yotaro Kobayashi. An ex-member of a right-wing group set fire to LDP politician Koichi Kato&#x27;s house. Koichi Kato and Yotaro Kobayashi had spoken out against Koizumi&#x27;s visits to Yasukuni Shrine.

Openly revisionist, Nippon Kaigi is considered &quot;the biggest right-wing organization in Japan&quot;.

<doc id="1026516" wikidata="Q67391638" url="?curid=1026516" title="Mr. Driller">
<text>is a puzzle video game franchise created by Yasuhito Nagaoka and Hideo Yoshizawa for Namco. The eponymous first game was released in 1999 for arcades and several home consoles, such as the PlayStation. Gameplay in the series consists of controlling Susumu Hori, the titular Mr. Driller, or one of his friends and destroying colorful formations of blocks to make it to the bottom of a well. In order to survive, players need to collect air capsules to replenish their depleting oxygen and avoid being crushed by falling blocks.

Nagaoka intended &quot;Mr. Driller&quot; to be the third mainline entry in Namco&#x27;s &quot;Dig Dug&quot; series. The two franchises have since been directly connected to one another through sharing characters and similar gameplay concepts. Project Driller was established as the development team for the series, which produced four sequels from 2000 to 2004. Bandai Namco Entertainment became the owner of the &quot;Mr. Driller&quot; property after Namco&#x27;s 2005 merger with Bandai, where it released several more installments for digital distribution services and mobile devices.

The &quot;Mr. Driller&quot; series was popular in Japan and its characters have become synonymous with the Namco brand. Reception from western publications has varied depending on the game. Most critics agree the series benefits from its simplicity and addictive nature, though several installments have been criticized for their lack of content and recycling of assets from earlier games.

==Titles==
===Games===

* Mr. Driller (1999) was first released to arcades for Namco&#x27;s System 12 arcade hardware. It was later ported to several consoles, including the Game Boy Color, PlayStation, Dreamcast, WonderSwan Color, Windows, and mobile phones. It introduces the core components of the series, the character Susumu Hori, and a story involving creatures known as Undergrounders flooding the Earth with giant blocks.
* Mr. Driller 2 (2000) was released for arcades in Japan and later for the Game Boy Advance and Windows. The sequel features Susumu&#x27;s rival, the hot-headed German driller Anna Hottenmeyer, alongside improvements such as increasing the game speed, two-player cooperative play, and additional game modes.
* Mr. Driller G (2001) was released for arcades and the PlayStation in Japan, serving as the final &quot;Mr. Driller&quot; game for arcades and the first developed by Project Driller. In addition to including a story-driven campaign mode, &quot;G&quot; adds several new playable characters, including Susumu&#x27;s older brother Ataru Hori, his father Taizo Hori, the dog Puchi, and the drilling robot Horinger-Z.
* Mr. Driller A (2002) was released in Japan for the Game Boy Advance. The game presents new mechanics and concepts that are designed after classic role-playing games, as opposed to the fast-paced action of previous installments. Players can also care for and train a virtual pet named a &quot;Pacteria&quot; through progress made in the main game.
* Mr. Driller Drill Land (2002) was released for the GameCube in Japan. The game is more ambitious than previous &quot;Mr. Driller&quot; games, featuring multiple game modes that vary in gameplay. These modes are tied together through a menu and presentation designed after an amusement park. In 2020, the game was remastered for the Nintendo Switch and PC through Steam with English subtitles.

==Common elements==
The &quot;Mr. Driller&quot; games are puzzle action games and have been described as a cross between &quot;Puyo Puyo&quot; and &quot;Dig Dug&quot;. Players control a character that must destroy, or &quot;drill&quot;, colorful formations of blocks in order to reach the bottom of a well. Blocks of the same color can connect to each other; if four of a kind connect, they are destroyed, which can be used to create chain reactions. The player has a constantly depleting oxygen meter that can be replenished by collecting blue air capsules. Oxygen is lost by destroying brown &quot;x&quot;-marked blocks, which take five hits to destroy. Certain characters have their own attributes and abilities, such as depleting oxygen less and moving faster. Later games introduce mechanics such as star-marked blocks that disappear after a brief period, boss fights, power-ups, and game modes that implement ideas from role-playing games.

==Development==
The original &quot;Mr. Driller&quot; was created by &quot;R4: Ridge Racer Type 4&quot; director Yasuhito Nagaoka and former Tecmo employee Hideo Yoshizawa. Nagaoka drafted the game in 1998 as a second sequel to &quot;Dig Dug&quot;, a classic Namco arcade game from 1982, aptly named &quot;Dig Dug 3&quot;. The game was designed to be more puzzle-like in gameplay structure, a contrast to the action-oriented gameplay of &quot;Dig Dug&quot; and &quot;Dig Dug II&quot;. Yoshizawa made several alterations to Nagaoka&#x27;s prototype build, including the renaming to Mr. Driller. Namco released the game in arcades in 1999 to critical and commercial success. &quot;Mr. Driller&quot; was ported to several platforms, including the Dreamcast, PlayStation, and Game Boy Color.

Yoshizawa and Nagaoka quickly began work on a sequel, &quot;Mr. Driller 2&quot;, in late 1999. The two worked to implement new features, such as a second-player character and making the gameplay faster and more chaotic than the original. The sequel was released for arcades in 2000 to moderate success and was followed by a port for the Game Boy Advance in 2001. The Game Boy Advance version was a launch title for the system and sold over 100,000 copies, however, the game wasn&#x27;t released in North America and Europe until 2005.

The third entry, &quot;Mr. Driller G&quot;, was released in 2001 for arcades and later the PlayStation. The game was created to be more story-driven than the previous installments, which expanded on the &quot;Mr. Driller&quot; universe and helped bridge the connection between the &quot;Mr. Driller&quot; and &quot;Dig Dug&quot; franchises. Taizo Hori, the protagonist of the &quot;Dig Dug&quot; series, is a playable character in G and is revealed to be the father of Susumu and his older brother Ataru Hori. The PlayStation version was only moderately successful with around 10,000 being sold during launch week.

Yoshizawa intended &quot;G&quot; to be the final game in the series, but Namco was approached by Nintendo to create a &quot;Mr. Driller&quot; game for the GameCube that took advantage of the console&#x27;s GameCube – Game Boy Advance link cable peripheral. This resulted in the creation of &quot;Mr. Driller A&quot; for the Game Boy Advance and &quot;Mr. Driller Drill Land&quot; for the GameCube in 2002. &quot;A&quot; implemented a Tamagotchi-inspired virtual pet that could be transferred to &quot;Drill Land&quot;. Though &quot;Drill Land&quot; received the most acclaim out of any game in the series, its exclusivity to the GameCube made it a commercial failure. Namco became less interested in supporting the franchise as a result. &quot;Mr. Driller Drill Spirits&quot;, the second portable entry in the series, was released in 2004 for the Nintendo DS and reused many of &quot;Drill Land&quot;″s game modes and assets, though condensed to meet the system&#x27;s hardware limitations. Namco&#x27;s North American division stripped most of its content in order for it to be ready in time for the launch of the DS in the United States, a move that garnered significant criticism from publications.

Namco Bandai Games became the owner of the &quot;Mr. Driller&quot; intellectual property after Namco&#x27;s 2005 merger with Bandai. &quot;Mr. Driller Online&quot; (2008) for the Xbox 360, &quot;Mr. Driller: Drill Till You Drop&quot; (2009) for DSiWare, and &quot;Mr. Driller W&quot; (2009) for WiiWare all recycle art assets and pre-established concepts from earlier games. Yoshizawa considered &quot;Drill Till You Drop&quot; to be the &quot;culmination&quot; of the series and likely the last one he would develop. By the early 2010s, Namco Bandai largely abandoned the property outside several mobile phone spin-offs.

In 2020, Bandai Namco Entertainment began to remaster of &quot;Drill Land&quot; for the Nintendo Switch and PC as part of its Encore series of remasters. The decision to remaster the game was based on the success of the remake for &quot;Katamari Damacy&quot; (2004). Yoshizawa, who had left Bandai Namco in 2016, supervised the project. The remaster was released in 2020 worldwide, titled &quot;Mr. Driller Encore&quot; in Japan. Maya Ito, the producer for &quot;Encore&quot;, says Bandai Namco would consider continuing the series if the remake was popular enough.

===Related games===
The scrolling shooters &quot;Baraduke&quot; (1985) and &quot;Bakutotsu Kijutei&quot; (1988) have retroactively been connected to the &quot;Mr. Driller&quot; series through &quot;Baraduke&quot;&#x27;s protagonist, Masuyo Tobi, having been formerly married to Taizo Hori. The 2002 arcade game &quot;Star Trigon&quot; adopts many of &quot;Mr. Driller&quot;″s characters and concepts. &quot;Star Trigon&quot; is a puzzle game where players hop across planets to create triangles in order to rescue yellow creatures. Project Driller developed &quot;Star Trigon&quot; and is considered a spin-off of the &quot;Mr. Driller&quot; series. The game was ported to mobile phones and Windows in 2008.

In 2005, Namco revived its &quot;Dig Dug&quot; series with &quot;Dig Dug: Digging Strike&quot; for the Nintendo DS. The game was designed to be closer to the company&#x27;s original vision of &quot;Mr. Driller&quot;, and features gameplay that combines mechanics present in &quot;Dig Dug&quot;, &quot;Dig Dug II&quot;, and &quot;Mr. Driller&quot;. &quot;Digging Strike&quot; was part of Namco&#x27;s continuing efforts in making &quot;Dig Dug&quot; and &quot;Mr. Driller&quot; part of the company&#x27;s pillar franchises. It received mixed reviews and was primarily criticized for its lack of long-lasting appeal and replay value. The 2005 compilation &quot;NamCollection&quot; includes &quot;Mr. Driller&quot; along with four other Namco-published PlayStation games for the PlayStation 2, in addition to bonus material such as conceptual art.

==Reception==

In Japan, the &quot;Mr. Driller&quot; series was commercially and critically successful, and its characters have become synonymous with the Namco brand. The original received the 1st Arcadia Grand Prize from the Japanese magazine &quot;Monthly Arcadia&quot;, and Namco received a prestigious award from &quot;Edge&quot; for &quot;Drill Land&quot;. Famitsu awarded the Game Boy Color port of &quot;Mr. Driller&quot;, &quot;Mr. Driller G&quot;, and the Game Boy Advance port of &quot;Mr. Driller 2&quot; the Silver Hall of Fame awards, while &quot;Mr. Driller A&quot; and &quot;Drill Land&quot; received the Gold Hall of Fame award.

Western perception of the series has varied depending on the game, though consensus agrees its gameplay is simple and addictive. The Dreamcast conversion of &quot;Mr. Driller&quot; received negative attention from the press for being technically inferior to Namco&#x27;s previous Dreamcast offering, the 3D weapon-based fighter &quot;Soulcalibur&quot;. Journalist Jeremy Parish speculates this backlash resulted in the series receiving a largely lukewarm reception outside Japan.

&quot;Mr. Driller G&quot; and &quot;Drill Land&quot; have been ranked as the best in the series for their quality and amount of content, while &quot;Online&quot;, &quot;W&quot;, and &quot;Drill Till You Drop&quot; have been listed as the weakest for their poor presentation and lack of innovation. &quot;Online&quot; in particular was negatively received for its online multiplayer, which multiple reviews found to have been unfinished and &quot;broken&quot;. &quot;Drill Spirits&quot; and home ports of &quot;Mr. Driller&quot; and &quot;Mr. Driller 2&quot; were criticized for being barren of content, though the Japanese and European releases of &quot;Drill Spirits&quot; have been identified as being a far bigger improvement over the North American version for their inclusion of additional game modes.

<doc id="1026521" wikidata="Q2700567" url="?curid=1026521" title="Pusher configuration">
<text>In aeronautical and naval engineering, pusher configuration is the term used to describe a drivetrain of air- or watercraft with propulsion device(s) after the engine(s). This is in contrast to the more conventional tractor configuration, which places them in front. 

Though the term is most commonly applied to aircraft, its most ubiquitous propeller example is a common outboard motor for a small boat. 

“Pusher configuration” describes the specific (propeller or ducted fan) thrust device attached to a craft, either aerostats (airship) or aerodynes (aircraft, WIG, paramotor, rotorcraft) or others types such as hovercraft, airboats, and propeller-driven snowmobiles.

==History==
 


The rubber-powered &quot;Planophore&quot;, designed by Alphonse Pénaud in 1871, was an early successful model aircraft with a pusher propeller.

Many early aircraft (especially biplanes) were &quot;pushers&quot;, including the Wright Flyer (1903), the Santos-Dumont 14-bis (1906), the Voisin-Farman I (1907), and the Curtiss Model D used by Eugene Ely for the first ship landing on January 18, 1911. Henri Farman&#x27;s pusher Farman III and its successors were so influential in Britain that pushers in general became known as the &quot;Farman type&quot;. Other early pusher configurations were variations on this theme.

The classic &quot;Farman&quot; pusher had the propeller &quot;mounted (just) behind the main lifting surface&quot; with the engine fixed to the lower wing or between the wings, immediately forward of the propeller in a stub fuselage (that also contained the pilot) called a nacelle. The main difficulty with this type of pusher design was attaching the tail (empennage). This needed to be in the same general location as on a tractor aircraft, but its support structure had to avoid the propeller. 

The earliest examples of pushers relied on a canard but this has serious aerodynamic implications that the early designers were unable to resolve. Typically, mounting the tail was done with a complex wire-braced framework that created a lot of drag. Well before the beginning of the First World War, this drag was recognized as just one of the factors that would ensure that a Farman-style pusher would have an inferior performance to an otherwise similar tractor type.

The U.S. Army banned pusher aircraft in late 1914 after several pilots died in crashes of aircraft of this type, so from about 1912 onwards, the great majority of new U.S. landplane designs were tractor biplanes, with pushers of all types becoming regarded as old-fashioned on both sides of the Atlantic. However, new pusher designs continued to be designed right up to the armistice, such as the Vickers Vampire, although few entered service after 1916.

At least up to the end of 1916, however, pushers (such as the Airco DH.2 fighter) were still favored as gun-carrying aircraft by the British Royal Flying Corps, because a forward-firing gun could be used without being obstructed by the arc of the propeller. With the successful introduction of Fokker&#x27;s mechanism for synchronizing the firing of a machine gun with the blades of a moving propeller, followed quickly by the widespread adoption of synchronization gears by all the combatants in 1916 and 1917, the tractor configuration became almost universally favored, and pushers were reduced to the tiny minority of new aircraft designs that had a specific reason for using the arrangement. 

Both the British and French continued to use pusher-configured bombers, though there was no clear preference either way until 1917. Such aircraft included (apart from the products of the Farman company) the Voisin bombers (3,200 built), the Vickers F.B.5 &quot;Gunbus&quot;, and the Royal Aircraft Factory F.E.2; however, even these found themselves being shunted into training roles before disappearing entirely. Possibly the last fighter to use the Farman pusher configuration was the 1931 Vickers Type 161 COW gun fighter.

During the long eclipse of the configuration the use of pusher propellers continued in aircraft which derived a small benefit from the installation and could have been built as tractors. Biplane flying boats had for some time often been fitted with engines located above the fuselage to offer maximum clearance from the water, often driving pusher propellers to avoid spray and the hazards involved by keeping them well clear of the cockpit. The Supermarine Walrus was a late example of this layout.

The so-called push/pull layout, combining the tractor and pusher configurations—that is, with one or more propellers facing forward and one or more others facing back—was another idea that continues to be used from time to time as a means of reducing the asymmetric effects of an outboard engine failure, such as on the Farman F.222, but at the cost of a severely reduced efficiency on the rear propellers, which were often smaller and attached to lower-powered engines as a result.

By the late 1930s, the widespread adoption of all-metal stressed skin construction of aircraft meant, at least in theory, that the aerodynamic penalties that had limited the performance of pushers (and indeed any unconventional layout) were reduced; however, any improvement that boosts pusher performance also boosts the performance of conventional aircraft, and they remained a rarity in operational service—so the gap was narrowed but was closed entirely.

During World War II, experiments were conducted with pusher fighters by most of the major powers. Difficulties remained, particularly that a pilot having to bail out of a pusher was liable to pass through the propeller arc. This meant that of all the types concerned, only the relatively conventional Swedish SAAB 21 of 1943 went into series production. Other problems related to the aerodynamics of canard layouts, which had been used on most of the pushers, proved more difficult to resolve. One of the world&#x27;s first ejection seats was (per force) designed for this aircraft, which later re-emerged with a jet engine.

The largest pusher aircraft to fly was the Convair B-36 &quot;Peacemaker&quot; of 1946, which was also the largest bomber ever operated by the United States. It had six 28-cylinder Pratt &amp; Whitney Wasp Major radial engines mounted in the wing, each driving a pusher propeller located behind the trailing edge of the wing, plus four jet engines.

Although the vast majority of propeller-driven aircraft continue to use a tractor configuration, there has been in recent years something of a revival of interest in pusher designs: in light homebuilt aircraft such as Burt Rutan&#x27;s canard designs since 1975, ultralights such as the Quad City Challenger (1983), flexwings, paramotors, powered parachutes, and autogyros. The configuration is also often used for unmanned aerial vehicles, due to requirements for a forward fuselage free of any engine interference.

The Aero Dynamics Sparrow Hawk was another homebuilt aircraft constructed chiefly in the 1990s.

==Configurations==

Airships are the oldest type of pusher aircraft, going back to Frenchman Henri Giffard&#x27;s pioneering airship of 1852.

Pusher aircraft have been built in many different configurations. In the vast majority of fixed-wing aircraft, the propeller or propellers are still located just behind the trailing edge of the &quot;main lifting surface&quot;, or below the wing (paramotors) with the engine being located behind the crew position.

Conventional aircraft layout have a tail (empennage) for stabilization and control. The propeller may be close to the engine, as the usual direct drive:

* The propeller may be ahead of the tail: inside the framework (Farman III), in line with the fuselage (RFB Fantrainer), between tail booms (Cessna Skymaster), above the fuselage on wing (Quad City Challenger), on nacelle or axial pod (Lake Buccaneer), or coaxially around rear fuselage (Gallaudet D-4).
* The propeller may be located behind the vertical tail, under the horizontal tail (Prescott Pusher).
* Engines and propellers may be located on wings (Piaggio P.180 Avanti) or on lateral pods (Embraer/FMA CBA 123 Vector).

The engine may be buried in a forward remote location, driving the propeller by drive shaft or belt:

* The propeller may be located ahead of the tail, behind the wing (Eipper Quicksilver) or inside the airframe (Rhein Flugzeugbau RW 3 Multoplan).
* The propeller may be located inside the tail, either cruciform or ducted fan (Marvelette).
* The propeller may be located at the rear, behind a conventional tail (Bede BD-5).
* The propeller may be located above the fuselage such as on many small flying boats (Lake Buccaneer)

In canard designs a smaller wing is sited forward of the aircraft&#x27;s main wing. This class mainly uses a direct drive, either single-engine axial propeller, or twin engines with a symmetrical layout, or an in line layout (push-pull) as the Rutan Voyager.

In tailless aircraft such as Lippisch Delta 1 and Westland-Hill Pterodactyl types I and IV, horizontal stabilizers at the rear of the aircraft are absent. Flying wings like the Northrop YB-35 are tailless aircraft without a distinct fuselage. In these installations, the engines are either mounted in nacelles or the fuselage on tailless aircraft, or buried in the wing on flying wings, driving propellers behind the trailing edge of the wing, often by extension shaft.

Almost without exception, flexwing aircraft, paramotors, and powered parachutes use a pusher configuration.

Other craft with pusher configurations run on flat surfaces, land, water, snow, or ice. Thrust is provided by propellers and ducted fans, located to the rear of the vehicle. These include:

* Hovercraft, lifted by an air cushion, such as the 58-passenger SR.N6.
* Airboats, flat bottomed vessels planing on water.
* Aerosledges, also known as the aerosleigh, propeller-driven sledge, or propeller-driven snowmobile.

==In aircraft==
===Advantages===
The drive shaft of a pusher engine is in compression in normal operation, which places less stress on it than being in tension in a tractor configuration. 

==== Practical requirements ====

Placing the cockpit forward of the wing to balance the weight of the engine(s) aft improves visibility for the crew. In military aircraft, front armament could be used more easily on account of the gun not needing to synchronize itself with the propeller, although the risk that spent casings fly into the props at the back somewhat offset this advantage.

Aircraft where the engine is carried by, or very close to, the pilot (such as paramotors, powered parachutes, autogyros, and flexwing trikes) place the engine behind the pilot to minimize the danger to the pilot&#x27;s arms and legs. These two factors mean that this configuration was widely used for early combat aircraft, and remains popular today among ultralight aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and radio-controlled airplanes.

==== Aerodynamics ====
A pusher may have a shorter fuselage and hence a reduction in both fuselage wetted area and weight.

In contrast to tractor layout, a pusher propeller at the end of the fuselage is stabilizing. A pusher needs less stabilizing vertical tail area and hence presents less weathercock effect; at takeoff roll, it is generally less sensitive to crosswind.

When there is no tail within the slipstream, unlike a tractor, there is no rotating propwash around the fuselage inducing a side force to the fin. At takeoff, a canard pusher pilot does not have to apply rudder input to balance this moment.

Efficiency can be gained by mounting a propeller behind the fuselage, because it re-energizes the boundary layer developed on the body, and reduces the form drag by keeping the flow attached to the fuselage. However, it is usually a minor gain compared to the airframe&#x27;s detrimental effect on propeller efficiency.

Wing profile drag may be reduced due to the absence of prop-wash over any section of the wing.

==== Safety ====

The engine is mounted behind the crew and passenger compartments, so fuel oil and coolant leaks will vent behind the aircraft, and any engine fire will be directed behind the aircraft. Similarly, propeller failure is less likely to directly endanger the crew.

A pusher ducted fan system offers a supplementary safety feature attributed to enclosing the rotating fan in the duct, therefore making it an attractive option for various advanced UAV configurations or for small/personal air vehicles or for aircraft models.

===Disadvantages===
====Structural and weight considerations====

A pusher design with an empennage behind the propeller is structurally more complex than a similar tractor type. The increased weight and drag degrades performance compared with a similar tractor type. Modern aerodynamic knowledge and construction methods may reduce but never eliminate the difference. A remote or buried engine requires a drive shaft and associated bearings, supports, and torsional vibration control, and adds weight and complexity.

==== Center of gravity and landing gear considerations ====
To maintain a safe center of gravity (CG) position, there is a limit to how far aft an engine can be installed. The forward location of the crew may balance the engine weight and will help determine the CG. As the CG location must be kept within defined limits for safe operation load distribution must be evaluated before each flight.

Due to a generally high thrust line needed for propeller ground clearance, negative (down) pitching moments, and in some cases the absence of prop-wash over the tail, a higher speed and a longer roll may be required for takeoff compared to tractor aircraft. The Rutan answer to this problem is to lower the nose of the aircraft at rest such that the empty center of gravity is then ahead of the main wheels. In autogyros, a high thrust line results in a control hazard known as power push-over.

====Aerodynamic considerations====

Due to the generally-high thrust line to ensure ground clearance, a low-wing pusher layout may suffer power-change-induced pitch changes, also known as pitch/power coupling. Pusher seaplanes with especially high thrust lines and tailwheels may find the vertical tail masked from the airflow, severely reducing control at low speeds, such as when taxiing. The absence of prop-wash over the wing reduces the lift and increases takeoff roll length. Pusher engines mounted on the wing may obstruct sections of the wing trailing edge, reducing the total width available for control surfaces such as flaps and ailerons. When a propeller is mounted in front of the tail, changes in engine power alter the airflow over the tail and can give strong pitch or yaw changes.

====Propeller ground clearance and foreign object damage====
Due to the pitch rotation at takeoff, the propeller diameter may have to be reduced (with a loss of efficiency) or landing gear made longer and heavier. Many pushers have ventral fins or skids beneath the propeller to prevent the propeller from striking the ground, at an added cost in drag and weight. On tailless pushers such as the Rutan Long-EZ, the propeller arc is very close to the ground while flying nose-high during takeoff or landing. Objects on the ground kicked up by the wheels can pass through the propeller disc, causing damage or accelerated wear to the blades; in extreme cases, the blades may strike the ground.

When an airplane flies in icing conditions, ice can accumulate on the wings. If an airplane with wing-mounted pusher engines experiences icing, the props will ingest shredded chunks of ice, endangering the propeller blades and parts of the airframe that can be struck by ice violently redirected by the props. In early pusher combat aircraft, spent ammunition casings caused similar problems, and devices for collecting them had to be devised.

====Propeller efficiency and noise====
The propeller passes through the fuselage wake, wing wake, and other flight surface downwashes—moving asymmetrically through a disk of irregular airspeed. This reduces propeller efficiency and causes vibration inducing structural propeller fatigue and noise.

Prop efficiency is usually at least 2–5% less and in some cases more than 15% less than an equivalent tractor installation. Full-scale wind tunnel investigation of the canard Rutan VariEze showed a propeller efficiency of 0.75 compared to 0.85 for a tractor configuration, a loss of 12%. Pusher props are noisy, and cabin noise may be higher than tractor equivalent (Cessna XMC vs Cessna 152). Propeller noise may increase because the engine exhaust flows through the props. This effect may be particularly pronounced when using turboprop engines due to the large volume of exhaust they produce.

====Engine cooling and exhaust====
Power-plant cooling design is more complex in pusher engines than for the tractor configuration, where the propeller forces air over the engine or radiator. Some aviation engines have experienced cooling problems when used as pushers. To counter this, auxiliary fans may be installed, adding additional weight. The engine of a pusher exhausts forward of the propeller, and in this case, the exhaust may contribute to corrosion or other damage to the propeller. This is usually minimal, and may be mainly visible in the form of soot stains on the blades.

====Safety====
=====Propeller=====

In case of propeller/tail proximity, a blade break can hit the tail or produce destructive vibrations, leading to a loss of control.

Crew members risk striking the propeller while attempting to bail out of a single-engined airplane with a pusher prop. At least one early ejector seat was designed specifically to counter this risk. Some modern light aircraft include a parachute system that saves the entire aircraft, thus averting the need to bail out.

=====Engine=====
Engine location in the pusher configuration might endanger the aircraft&#x27;s occupants in a crash or crash-landing in which engine momentum projects through the cabin. For example, with the engine placed directly behind the cabin, during a nose-on impact, the engine momentum may carry the engine through the firewall and cabin, and might injure some cabin occupants.

=====Aircraft loading=====
Spinning propellers are always a hazard on ground working, such as loading or embarking the airplane. The tractor configuration leaves the rear of the plane as relatively safe working area, while a pusher is dangerous to approach from behind, while a spinning propeller may suck in things and people nearby in front of it with fatal results to both the plane and the people sucked in. Even more hazardous are unloading operations, especially mid-air, such as dropping supplies on parachute or skydiving operations, which are next to impossible with a pusher configuration airplane, especially if propellers are mounted on fuselage or sponsons.

<doc id="1026522" wikidata="Q891653" url="?curid=1026522" title="Boltzmann equation">
<text>The Boltzmann equation or Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) describes the statistical behaviour of a thermodynamic system not in a state of equilibrium; it was devised by Ludwig Boltzmann in 1872.
The classic example of such a system is a fluid with temperature gradients in space causing heat to flow from hotter regions to colder ones, by the random but biased transport of the particles making up that fluid. In the modern literature the term Boltzmann equation is often used in a more general sense, referring to any kinetic equation that describes the change of a macroscopic quantity in a thermodynamic system, such as energy, charge or particle number.

The equation arises not by analyzing the individual positions and momenta of each particle in the fluid but rather by considering a probability distribution for the position and momentum of a typical particle—that is, the probability that the particle occupies a given very small region of space (mathematically the volume element formula_1) centered at the position formula_2, and has momentum nearly equal to a given momentum vector formula_3 (thus occupying a very small region of momentum space formula_4), at an instant of time.

The Boltzmann equation can be used to determine how physical quantities change, such as heat energy and momentum, when a fluid is in transport. One may also derive other properties characteristic to fluids such as viscosity, thermal conductivity, and electrical conductivity (by treating the charge carriers in a material as a gas). See also convection–diffusion equation.

The equation is a nonlinear integro-differential equation, and the unknown function in the equation is a probability density function in six-dimensional space of a particle position and momentum. The problem of existence and uniqueness of solutions is still not fully resolved, but some recent results are quite promising.

==Overview==

===The phase space and density function===
The set of all possible positions r and momenta p is called the phase space of the system; in other words a set of three coordinates for each position coordinate &quot;x, y, z&quot;, and three more for each momentum component , , . The entire space is 6-dimensional: a point in this space is , and each coordinate is parameterized by time &quot;t&quot;. A relevant differential element is written 
formula_5

Since the probability of molecules, which &quot;all&quot; have and within formula_6, is in question, at the heart of the equation is a quantity which gives this probability per unit phase-space volume, or probability per unit length cubed per unit momentum cubed, at an instant of time . This is a probability density function: , defined so that,
formula_7
is the number of molecules which &quot;all&quot; have positions lying within a volume element formula_8 about and momenta lying within a momentum space element formula_9 about , at time . Integrating over a region of position space and momentum space gives the total number of particles which have positions and momenta in that region:

formula_10

which is a 6-fold integral. While is associated with a number of particles, the phase space is for one-particle (not all of them, which is usually the case with deterministic many-body systems), since only one and is in question. It is not part of the analysis to use , for particle 1, , for particle 2, etc. up to , for particle &quot;N&quot;.

It is assumed the particles in the system are identical (so each has an identical mass ). For a mixture of more than one chemical species, one distribution is needed for each, see below.

===Principal statement===

The general equation can then be written as
formula_11

where the &quot;force&quot; term corresponds to the forces exerted on the particles by an external influence (not by the particles themselves), the &quot;diff&quot; term represents the diffusion of particles, and &quot;coll&quot; is the collision term – accounting for the forces acting between particles in collisions. Expressions for each term on the right side are provided below.

Note that some authors use the particle velocity instead of momentum ; they are related in the definition of momentum by .

==The force and diffusion terms==

Consider particles described by , each experiencing an &quot;external&quot; force not due to other particles (see the collision term for the latter treatment).

Suppose at time some number of particles all have position within element formula_8 and momentum within formula_9. If a force instantly acts on each particle, then at time their position will be formula_14 and momentum . Then, in the absence of collisions, must satisfy

formula_15

Note that we have used the fact that the phase space volume element formula_6 is constant, which can be shown using Hamilton&#x27;s equations (see the discussion under Liouville&#x27;s theorem). However, since collisions do occur, the particle density in the phase-space volume formula_6 changes, so
where is the &quot;total&quot; change in . Dividing () by formula_18 and taking the limits and , we have
The total differential of is:
\cdot d\mathbf{p} \\[5pt]
&amp; = \frac{\partial f}{\partial t}dt +\nabla f \cdot \frac{\mathbf{p}}{m}dt + \frac{\partial f}{\partial \mathbf{p}}\cdot \mathbf{F} \, dt
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where is the gradient operator, is the dot product,
formula_19
is a shorthand for the momentum analogue of , and , , are Cartesian unit vectors.

===Final statement===

Dividing () by and substituting into () gives:

formula_20

In this context, is the force field acting on the particles in the fluid, and is the mass of the particles. The term on the right hand side is added to describe the effect of collisions between particles; if it is zero then the particles do not collide. The collisionless Boltzmann equation, where individual collisions are replaced with long-range aggregated interactions, e.g. Coulomb interactions, is often called the Vlasov equation.

This equation is more useful than the principal one above, yet still incomplete, since cannot be solved unless the collision term in is known. This term cannot be found as easily or generally as the others – it is a statistical term representing the particle collisions, and requires knowledge of the statistics the particles obey, like the Maxwell–Boltzmann, Fermi–Dirac or Bose–Einstein distributions.

==The collision term (Stosszahlansatz) and molecular chaos==

=== Two-body collision term ===
A key insight applied by Boltzmann was to determine the collision term resulting solely from two-body collisions between particles that are assumed to be uncorrelated prior to the collision. This assumption was referred to by Boltzmann as the &quot;&quot; and is also known as the &quot;molecular chaos assumption&quot;. Under this assumption the collision term can be written as a momentum-space integral over the product of one-particle distribution functions:
formula_21
where and are the momenta of any two particles (labeled as &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; for convenience) before a collision, and are the momenta after the collision,
formula_22
is the magnitude of the relative momenta (see relative velocity for more on this concept), and is the differential cross section of the collision, in which the relative momenta of the colliding particles turns through an angle into the element of the solid angle , due to the collision.

=== Simplifications to the collision term ===
Since much of the challenge in solving the Boltzmann equation originates with the complex collision term, attempts have been made to &quot;model&quot; and simplify the collision term. The best known model equation is due to Bhatnagar, Gross and Krook. The assumption in the BGK approximation is that the effect of molecular collisions is to force a non-equilibrium distribution function at a point in physical space back to a Maxwellian equilibrium distribution function and that the rate at which this occurs is proportional to the molecular collision frequency. The Boltzmann equation is therefore modified to the BGK form:

formula_23

where formula_24 is the molecular collision frequency, and formula_25 is the local Maxwellian distribution function given the gas temperature at this point in space. This is also called &quot;relaxation time approximation&quot;.

==General equation (for a mixture)==

For a mixture of chemical species labelled by indices the equation for species is

formula_26

where , and the collision term is

formula_27

where , the magnitude of the relative momenta is

formula_28

and is the differential cross-section, as before, between particles &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot;. The integration is over the momentum components in the integrand (which are labelled &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot;). The sum of integrals describes the entry and exit of particles of species &quot;i&quot; in or out of the phase-space element.

==Applications and extensions==

===Conservation equations===

The Boltzmann equation can be used to derive the fluid dynamic conservation laws for mass, charge, momentum, and energy. For a fluid consisting of only one kind of particle, the number density is given by
formula_29

The average value of any function is
formula_30

Since the conservation equations involve tensors, the Einstein summation convention will be used where repeated indices in a product indicate summation over those indices. Thus formula_31 and formula_32, where formula_33 is the particle velocity vector. Define formula_34 as some function of momentum formula_35 only, whose total value is conserved in a collision. Assume also that the force formula_36 is a function of position only, and that &quot;f&quot; is zero for formula_37. Multiplying the Boltzmann equation by &quot;A&quot; and integrating over momentum yields four terms, which, using integration by parts, can be expressed as

formula_38

formula_39

formula_40

formula_41

where the last term is zero, since is conserved in a collision. The values of correspond to moments of velocity formula_33 (and momentum formula_35, as they are linearly dependent).

====Zeroth moment====

Letting formula_44, the mass of the particle, the integrated Boltzmann equation becomes the conservation of mass equation:
formula_45
where formula_46 is the mass density, and formula_47 is the average fluid velocity.

====First moment====

Letting formula_48, the momentum of the particle, the integrated Boltzmann equation becomes the conservation of momentum equation:

formula_49

where formula_50 is the pressure tensor (the viscous stress tensor plus the hydrostatic pressure).

====Second moment====

Letting formula_51, the kinetic energy of the particle, the integrated Boltzmann equation becomes the conservation of energy equation:

formula_52

where formula_53 is the kinetic thermal energy density, and formula_54 is the heat flux vector.

===Hamiltonian mechanics===

In Hamiltonian mechanics, the Boltzmann equation is often written more generally as
formula_55
where is the Liouville operator (there is an inconsistent definition between the Liouville operator as defined here and the one in the article linked) describing the evolution of a phase space volume and is the collision operator. The non-relativistic form of is
formula_56

=== Quantum theory and violation of particle number conservation ===

It is possible to write down relativistic quantum Boltzmann equations for relativistic quantum systems in which the number of particles is not conserved in collisions. This has several applications in physical cosmology, including the formation of the light elements in Big Bang nucleosynthesis, the production of dark matter and baryogenesis. It is not a priori clear that the state of a quantum system can be characterized by a classical phase space density &quot;f&quot;. However, for a wide class of applications a well-defined generalization of &quot;f&quot; exists which is the solution of an effective Boltzmann equation that can be derived from first principles of quantum field theory.

===General relativity and astronomy===

The Boltzmann equation is of use in galactic dynamics. A galaxy, under certain assumptions, may be approximated as a continuous fluid; its mass distribution is then represented by &quot;f&quot;; in galaxies, physical collisions between the stars are very rare, and the effect of &quot;gravitational collisions&quot; can be neglected for times far longer than the age of the universe.

Its generalization in general relativity is
formula_57
where is the Christoffel symbol of the second kind (this assumes there are no external forces, so that particles move along geodesics in the absence of collisions), with the important subtlety that the density is a function in mixed contravariant-covariant phase space as opposed to fully contravariant phase space.

In physical cosmology the fully covariant approach has been used to study the cosmic microwave background radiation. More generically the study of processes in the early universe often attempt to take into account the effects of quantum mechanics and general relativity. In the very dense medium formed by the primordial plasma after the Big Bang, particles are continuously created and annihilated. In such an environment quantum coherence and the spatial extension of the wavefunction can affect the dynamics, making it questionable whether the classical phase space distribution &quot;f&quot; that appears in the Boltzmann equation is suitable to describe the system. In many cases it is, however, possible to derive an effective Boltzmann equation for a generalized distribution function from first principles of quantum field theory. This includes the formation of the light elements in Big Bang nucleosynthesis, the production of dark matter and baryogenesis.

== Solving the equation ==
Exact solutions to the Boltzmann equations have been proven to exist in some cases; this analytical approach provides insight, but is not generally usable in practical problems.

Instead, numerical methods (including finite elements and lattice Boltzmann methods) are generally used to find approximate solutions to the various forms of the Boltzmann equation. Example applications range from hypersonic aerodynamics in rarefied gas flows to plasma flows. An application of the Boltzmann equation in electrodynamics is the calculation of the electrical conductivity - the result is in leading order identical with the semiclassical result.

Close to local equilibrium, solution of the Boltzmann equation can be represented by an asymptotic expansion in powers of Knudsen number (the Chapman–Enskog expansion). The first two terms of this expansion give the Euler equations and the Navier–Stokes equations. The higher terms have singularities. The problem of developing mathematically the limiting processes, which lead from the atomistic view (represented by Boltzmann&#x27;s equation) to the laws of motion of continua, is an important part of Hilbert&#x27;s sixth problem.

== Limitations and further uses of the Boltzmann equation ==
The Boltzmann equation is valid only under several assumptions. For instance, the particles are assumed to be pointlike, i.e. without having a finite size. There exists a generalization of the Boltzmann equation that is called the Enskog equation. The collision term is modified in Enskog equations such that particles have a finite size, for example they can be modelled as spheres having a fixed radius.

No further degrees of freedom besides translational motion are assumed for the particles. If there are internal degrees of freedom, the Boltzmann equation has to be generalized and might possess inelastic collisions.

Many real fluids like liquids or dense gases have besides the features mentioned above more complex forms of collisions, there will be not only binary, but also ternary and higher order collisions. These must be derived by using the BBGKY hierarchy.

Boltzmann-like equations are also used for the movement of cells. Since cells are composite particles that carry internal degrees of freedom, the corresponding generalized Boltzmann equations must have inelastic collision integrals. Such equations can describe invasions of cancer cells in tissue, morphogenesis, and chemotaxis-related effects.

Very inexpensive introduction to the modern framework (starting from a formal deduction from Liouville and the Bogoliubov–Born–Green–Kirkwood–Yvon hierarchy (BBGKY) in which the Boltzmann equation is placed). Most statistical mechanics textbooks like Huang still treat the topic using Boltzmann&#x27;s original arguments. To derive the equation, these books use a heuristic explanation that does not bring out the range of validity and the characteristic assumptions that distinguish Boltzmann&#x27;s from other transport equations like Fokker–Planck or Landau equations.

<text>The Battle of Killdeer Mountain (also known as the Battle of Tahkahokuty Mountain) took place during Brig. Gen. Alfred Sully&#x27;s expedition against the Sioux in Dakota Territory July 28–29, 1864. The location of the battleground is in modern Dunn County, North Dakota. With a total of more than 4,000 soldiers involved in the total operation, and more than 2,000 in the battle, Sully&#x27;s expedition was the largest ever carried out by the U.S. army against Native Americans.

==Background==
In the aftermath of the Dakota War of 1862, the U.S. government punished the Sioux, including those who had not participated in the war. Large military expeditions into Dakota Territory in 1863 pushed most of the Sioux to the western side of the Missouri River at least temporarily and made safer, although not entirely safe, the frontier of white settlement in Minnesota and the Dakotas. Four whites were killed by Sioux raiders in the spring of 1864.

An important impetus to another military campaign against the Sioux was the desire to protect lines of communication with recently discovered goldfields in Montana and Idaho. The lifeline for the American gold miners were steamboats plying the Missouri River through the heart of Sioux territory.
During the winter of 1863–1864, Sully&#x27;s superior, Major General John Pope ordered Sully to establish several forts along the Missouri River and in the eastern Dakotas to secure the communication routes to the goldfields and to eliminate the Sioux threat to the settlers east of the Missouri River.

Sully&#x27;s First Brigade, consisting of up to 1,700 men, followed the Missouri River from its starting point at Sioux City, Iowa. The Second Brigade with about 1,550 men would march overland from Fort Ridgely in Minnesota. On the march up the Missouri, the Sioux killed one soldier and wounded another. The three Sioux perpetrators were caught, killed, and decapitated. Additional soldiers and civilians with 15 steamboats chugged up the Missouri River to support the army on the ground.

Sully&#x27;s two columns of soldiers united on June 29 and on July 7 he established Fort Rice on the Missouri River in North Dakota as a base, supplied by steamboat, for his military expedition. His scouts, Winnebago and friendly Sioux and mixed-bloods, informed him of a large encampment of Sioux 130 miles northwest near the Little Missouri River. On July 19, he and his men departed Fort Rice to search for the Sioux encampment. Sully was encumbered by a wagon train of 200 miners and their families headed for the goldfields whom he reluctantly agreed to protect and escort.

Sully&#x27;s scouts reported 1,500 to 1,800 tipis in the Sioux encampment. Sully believed he would be faced by 5,000 to 6,000 warriors. The Sioux later claimed they had 1,600 warriors in the battle – likely closer to the truth with a calculation of one to two adult males per tipi. The Sioux in the encampment consisted mostly of Lakota (Teton) from the Hunkpapa, Sihasapa, Miniconjou, and Sans Arc bands plus Yanktonais, and a few Santees. The Sioux were mostly armed only with bows and arrows and a few short-range muskets and shotguns. Many of the Sioux, especially the Tetons, had not been hostile to the U.S. before this encounter.

Sully, after leaving men at Fort Rice and to guard the emigrants, had 2,200 men for the attack. He also had two artillery batteries with eight howitzers.
On July 26, Sully&#x27;s Indian Scouts skirmished with 30 Sioux warriors near present-day Richardton, North Dakota and one scout was wounded. With the Sioux now aware of his presence, Sully advanced rapidly but carefully. On the morning of July 28, scout Frank LaFramboise, a mixed-blood Santee, informed Sully of the location of the large Sioux encampment 10 miles ahead.

Killdeer Mountain was at the edge of the Dakota badlands, cut up by &quot;deep, impassable ravines&quot; and &quot;high rugged hills.&quot; Realizing that a cavalry charge would be difficult in the broken terrain Sully dismounted his soldiers and formed them in a hollow square, one mile and a quarter (2 km.) per side. His horses and artillery were sheltered inside the square. He advanced on foot, as the Sioux on horseback formed up in groups on Sully&#x27;s flanks and on hilltops.

==Battle==

The two sides, Sully&#x27;s soldiers drawn up in a hollow square and Native forces scattered around the hills, exchanged insults at long distance. One warrior, a Hunkpapa named Lone Dog rode within rifle range of the soldiers, taunting them. Sully ordered him shot by sharpshooters. Accounts differ as to whether Lone Dog was killed or unscathed.

With the first shots fired at Lone Dog, the soldiers advanced with a skirmish line and the Sioux darted at the flanks of the army, seeking weak spots. Artillery fire discouraged the Sioux from congregating in large numbers. A thrust at Sully&#x27;s rear was broken up by an artillery shell that felled several of the warriors. Sully&#x27;s square of soldiers advanced steadily. The Sioux quickly realized that they could not hope to turn the soldiers back and they shifted their focus to packing up their tipis and equipment and protecting the flight of their women and children.

Attempting to halt Sully&#x27;s advance, the Sioux mounted charges on his right and left flanks, the Yanktonai and Santee attacking on the right and the Teton on his left. Major Alfred B. Brackett and his Minnesota Battalion on the right mounted their horses and launched a counter-charge, supported by artillery. He scattered the Native forces after close quarters fighting with sabers and pistols. A renowned hero of the frontier and the Civil War, Lt. George Northrup, was killed in the charge.

It was getting dark as Sully neared the Sioux village. He halted his men for the night, but continued his artillery bombardment of the Sioux and their village. The Sioux fled or fought delaying actions, abandoning most of their tipis and property.

Sully&#x27;s casualties for the day were 3 killed and 10 wounded. He estimated Sioux casualties of 100 to 150 dead, nearly all of them warriors. The Sioux claimed they suffered 31 dead.

==Aftermath==
The day after the battle, the Sioux having abandoned their encampment, Sully detailed 700 men to destroy all they had left behind. This included tipis, large supplies of dried buffalo meat (jerky), and up to 3,000 dogs which were shot. A few Sioux, including children, left behind in the camp were killed by the Winnebago scouts.

Most of the Sioux scattered through the Dakota Badlands to the west of Killdeer Mountain, but some remained near Sully. Several Sioux on a hilltop waved a white flag requesting talks but they were fired on by soldiers and fled. That night two of Sully&#x27;s picket guards were killed and one wounded by a Sioux war party. Another soldier was killed by guards when he was mistaken for an enemy.

Although running short of rations, Sully decided to continue his pursuit of the Sioux. A Blackfoot scout said he knew a route through the Badlands passable by Sully&#x27;s wagon train. After two days rest, Sully and his men plunged into the unknown terrain ahead. The Sioux would harass their passage in the Battle of the Badlands.

<doc id="1026559" wikidata="Q1131119" url="?curid=1026559" title="Operation Wetback">
<text>Operation Wetback was an immigration law enforcement initiative created by Joseph Swing, a retired United States Army lieutenant general and head of the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). The program was implemented in June 1954 by U.S. Attorney General Herbert Brownell. The short-lived operation used military-style tactics to remove Mexican immigrants—some of them American citizens—from the United States. Though millions of Mexicans had legally entered the country through joint immigration programs in the first half of the 20th century, with some being naturalized citizens and some once native, Operation Wetback was designed to send them to Mexico.

The program became a contentious issue in Mexico–United States relations, even though it originated from a request by the Mexican government to stop the illegal entry of Mexican laborers into the United States. Legal entry of Mexican workers for employment was at the time controlled by the Bracero Program, established during World War II by an agreement between the U.S. and Mexican governments. Operation Wetback was primarily a response to pressure from a broad coalition of farmers and business interests concerned with the effects of illegal immigration from Mexico. Upon implementation, Operation Wetback gave rise to arrests and deportations by the U.S. Border Patrol.

==Background and causes==
===Migration and labor before World War II===

Mexico began discouraging emigration to the United States in the early 1900s, beginning with President Porfirio Díaz. Diaz, like many other Mexican government officials, realized that the laborers leaving for the United States would be needed to industrialize and expand the Mexican economy. While Mexico did not have extensive capital, its largest asset was abundant, cheap labor, the primary resource needed to modernize the country&#x27;s economy and develop industrial agribusiness.

The large and growing agricultural industry in the United States created a demand for labor. From the 1920s onward, with the exception of the depression era, Mexicans served as the primary labor source for much of the agricultural industry in the United States, especially in the Southwest. Every year during the 1920s, some 62,000 workers entered the United States legally, and over 100,000 illegally.

Pressure from Mexican agribusiness owners to return laborers from the United States to Mexico prompted increased action by the Mexican government. The labor problems caused crops to rot in Mexican fields because so many laborers had crossed into the U.S. Meanwhile, American agriculture, which was also transitioning to large-scale farms and agribusinesses, continued to recruit illegal Mexican laborers to fulfill its expanding labor requirements.
===The Bracero Program (1942–1964)===

During World War II, the Mexican and American governments developed an agreement known as the &quot;Bracero Program&quot;, which allowed Mexican laborers to work in the United States under short-term contracts in exchange for stricter border security and the return of illegal Mexican immigrants to Mexico. Instead of providing military support to the U.S. and its military allies, Mexico would provide laborers to the U.S. with the understanding that border security and illegal labor restrictions would be tightened by the United States. The United States agreed, based upon a strong need for cheap labor to support its agricultural businesses, while Mexico hoped to utilize the laborers returned from the United States to boost its efforts to industrialize, grow its economy, and eliminate labor shortages.

The program began on September 27, 1942, when the first braceros were admitted into the United States under this agreement with Mexico. The program called for braceros to be guaranteed wages, housing, food, and exemption from military service. However, even though this was the agreement promised by the United States, conditions were imposed by Mexico that only healthy young men with agricultural experience who could show a permission letter stating that they were not needed in Mexico were eligible, and workers who did not fit this requirement were denied paperwork to work in America.

The Bracero Program would not have a consistent implementation or direction during its 22-year duration. The program itself can be classified into three main phases. The first between 1942 and 1946 saw heavy input from the Mexican government in regard to the operations of the Bracero Program. The second phase was between 1947 and 1954 when the policy shifted from mass legalization of illegal immigrants to mass repatriation of said immigrants. The El Paso incident (see slightly below) would begin discussion of establishing a labor pool versus dealing with the &quot;illegal invasion&quot; of these immigrants. In certain cases, undocumented workers found by INS agents would be legalized as Braceros instead of deported. The final phase lasted from 1955 to 1964 and thus saw the end of the Bracero Program. The paradoxical nature of wanting a source of labor in the form of Mexican immigrants but distaste for the immigrants by the population would persist in the United States.

After this agreement was reached, the Mexican government continued pressuring the United States to strengthen its border security or face the suspension of the legal stream of Mexican laborers entering the United States. In October 1948, Immigration officials opened the Texas–Mexico border which allowed several thousand undocumented workers to cross the border. From here most workers were escorted by Border Patrol agents straight to the cotton fields. This event started the informal practice of using undocumented Mexican labor while the blacklist was in place. This incident was problematic due to the direct way the US government was involved in the managing and movement of these undocumented workers. This opening of the border was also in direct violation of previous agreements with the Mexican government. This incident would become known as the El Paso incident. Two million Mexican nationals participated in the Bracero program during its existence, but tensions between the program&#x27;s stated and implicit goals, plus its ultimate ineffectiveness in limiting illegal immigration into the United States, eventually led to Operation Wetback in 1954.

===Illegal migration after 1942===
Despite the Bracero program, American growers continued to recruit and hire illegal laborers to meet their labor needs. The program could not accommodate the number of Mexicans who wished to work in the United States. Many who were denied entry as a bracero crossed illegally into the United States in search of better wages and opportunity. Nearly 70% of people who were attempting to immigrate to America were denied because they were viewed as undesirable for a variety of reasons, including age, gender, or other factors. While the Mexican Constitution allowed citizens to cross borders freely with valid labor contracts, foreign labor contracts could not be made in the United States until an individual had already legally entered the country. This conflict, combined with literacy exams and fees from INS formed significant obstacles for Mexican laborers wishing to seek higher wages and increased opportunities in the United States.

Food shortages were common in Mexico while most of the foodstuff produced was exported. Hunger and misgovernment, combined with population growth, prompted many Mexicans to attempt to enter the United States, legally or illegally, in search of wages and a better life. This growth was exponential, resulting in the population nearly tripling in a short time period of forty years. The Mexican government&#x27;s interference with the privatization and mechanization of Mexican agriculture added more problems to finding employment in Mexico, providing yet another reason for Mexicans to enter the United States in search of higher wage jobs. With the growing concern about unassimilated immigrants, and the diplomatic and security issues surrounding illegal border crossings, popular pressure caused the INS to increase its raids and apprehensions beginning in the early 1950s leading up to Operation Wetback. The Korean War and the Red Scare also prompted tighter border security to prevent presumed communist infiltration.

Mass deportations also affected the growing patterns in California and Arizona; although the United States had promised farm owners additional Bracero labor. During the Bracero program, &quot;an estimated 4.6 million workers entered America legally, while other immigrants that were turned away still entered&quot; because of the work opportunities occurring in the southwest. California then became dependent on the workers while Texas continued to hire workers illegally after this was banned by the federal government; however, because of the agricultural demand, this was overlooked. While both countries were benefitting from this program in different ways, the large influx of immigration caused Eisenhower to end the program with Mexico.

===Border control leading up to Operation Wetback===
In 1943 more United States Border Control Officers were posted along Mexico&#x27;s northern border. Pressure from well-connected Mexican land and farm owners frustrated with the Bracero program prompted the Mexican government to call a meeting in Mexico City with four agencies of the United States government: the Department of Justice, the Department of State, the INS, and the Border Patrol. This meeting resulted in increased border patrol along the United States–Mexico border by the United States, yet illegal immigration persisted. One of the main issues was that increased pressure by the Mexican government produced more deportations, but the deported Mexicans rapidly reentered the United States. To combat this, the Mexican and American governments developed a strategy in 1945 to deport Mexicans deeper into Mexican territory by a system of planes, boats, and trains. However, in 1954, negotiations surrounding the bracero program broke down, prompting the Mexican government to send 5000 troops to its border with the United States.

In correspondence with assistants to President Dwight Eisenhower, Harlon Carter, head of the Border Patrol, planned Operation Cloud Burst, which requested an executive order to mobilize the military to round up illegal entrants at the southwestern border and to raid migrant camps and businesses in the interior of the United States. In deference to the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, Eisenhower declined to authorize the use of Federal troops, instead appointing Army General Joseph May Swing as the commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Eisenhower gave Swing the power to resolve border control issues in order to stabilize labor negotiations with Mexico.

==Operation Wetback (1954)==
===Implementation and tactics===
At its peak, the Bracero program allotted around 309,000 contracts to Mexican laborers. What followed was a series of repatriations under the name Operation Wetback. Similar repatriations can be seen during the Great Depression. Operation Wetback was a program of massive apprehensions and deportations aimed at undocumented Mexican nationals, by the U.S. Border Patrol and alongside the Mexican government. Planning between the INS, led by Gen. Joseph Swing as appointed by President Eisenhower and the Mexican government, began in early 1954 while the program was formally announced in May 1954. Harlon Carter, then head of the Border Patrol, was a leader of Operation Wetback.

In June, command teams of 12 Border Patrol agents, buses, planes, and temporary processing stations began locating, processing, and deporting Mexicans who had illegally entered the United States. A total of 750 immigration and border patrol officers and investigators; 300 jeeps, cars and buses; and seven airplanes were allocated for the operation. Teams were focused on quick processing, as planes were able to coordinate with ground efforts and quickly deport people into Mexico. Those deported were handed off to Mexican officials, who in turn moved them into central Mexico where there were many labor opportunities. While the operation included the cities of Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Chicago, its main targets were border areas in Texas and California.

Overall, there were 1,074,277 &quot;returns&quot;, defined as &quot;confirmed movement of an inadmissible or deportable alien out of the United States not based on an order of removal&quot; in the first year of Operation Wetback. This included many workers without papers who fled to Mexico fearing arrest; over half a million from Texas alone. The total number of sweeps fell to just 242,608 in 1955, and continuously declined each year until 1962, when there was a slight rise in apprehended workers. Despite the decline in sweeps, the total number of Border Patrol agents more than doubled to 1,692 by 1962, and an additional plane was added to the force.

During the entirety of the Operation, border recruitment of illegal workers by American growers continued, due largely to the low cost of illegal labor, and the desire of growers to avoid the bureaucratic obstacles of the Bracero program. The continuation of illegal immigration, despite the efforts of Operation Wetback, along with public outcry over many US citizens removed, was largely responsible for the failure of the program. Because of these factors, operation Wetback lost funding.

The program resulted in a more permanent, strategic border control presence along the Mexico–United States border.

===Timeline===
===Consequences===

The name &quot;wetback&quot; is a slur applied to illegal entrants who supposedly entered the United States by swimming the Rio Grande. It became a derogatory term applied generally to Mexican laborers, including those who were legal residents. Similarly, the 1855 Greaser Act was so-known based on the anti-Mexican slur &quot;greaser&quot;.

One of the biggest problems caused by the program for the deportees was sending them to unfamiliar parts of Mexico, where they struggled to find their way home or to continue to support their families. More than 25% of apprehended Mexicans were returned to Veracruz on cargo ships, while others were transported by land to southern cities in Mexico. Those apprehended were often deported without receiving the opportunity to recover their property in the United States, or to contact their families prior to deportation.

Deportees often were stranded without any food or employment when they were released in Mexico. Deported Mexicans sometimes faced extreme conditions in their country; 88 deported workers died in the heat in July 1955. Another issue was repeated illegal border crossings by those who had been previously deported; from 1960 through 1961, repeaters accounted for 20% of the total deportees. Certain U.S. Border Patrol agents practiced shaving heads to mark repeat offenders who might attempt to reenter the United States. There were also reports of beating and jailing chronically offending illegal immigrants before deporting them. While most complaints concerning deportation were undocumented, there were more than 11,000 formal complaints (about 1% of all actions) from documented bracero workers from 1954 through 1964.

Operation Wetback was the culmination of more than a decade of intensifying immigration enforcement. Immigration enforcement actions (removals and returns) rose rapidly from a low of 12,000 in 1942, to 727,000 in 1952, the final year of the Truman Administration. Enforcement actions continued to rise under Eisenhower, until reaching a peak of 1.1 million in 1954, the year of Operation Wetback. Enforcement actions then fell by more than 90 percent in 1955, and 1956, and in 1957 were 69,000, the lowest number since 1944. The number of enforcement actions rose again in the 1960s and 1970s, but did not exceed the 1954 peak of Operation Wetback until 1986.

At the same time that immigration enforcement was expanding in the late 1940s and early 1950s, the Bracero program was also rapidly expanding legal opportunities for Mexican laborers. Although it began as a wartime measure, the Bracero program saw its largest expansion after the war. The number of wartime braceros peaked at 62,000 in 1944, but the number began to rise again in the late 1940s, and reached its peak in 1956, when the program gave temporary work permits to 445,000 Mexican workers.

<text>Nicholas Stephen Alkemade (10 December 1922 – 22 June 1987) was a British tail gunner in the Royal Air Force during World War II who survived a freefall of without a parachute after abandoning his out-of-control, burning Avro Lancaster heavy bomber over Germany.

== War service ==
On the night of 24 March 1944, 21-year-old Alkemade was one of seven crew members in Avro Lancaster B Mk. II, &quot;DS664&quot;, of No. 115 Squadron RAF. Returning from a 300-bomber-raid on Berlin, east of Schmallenberg, &quot;DS664&quot; was attacked by a German Junkers Ju 88 night-fighter flown by &quot;Oberleutnant&quot; Heinz Rökker of , the attack caused the Lancaster to catch fire and began to spiral out of control. As his parachute had caught fire and was unserviceable, Alkemade jumped from the aircraft without it, preferring to die on impact rather than burn to death. He fell to the ground.

His fall was broken by fir trees and a soft snow cover on the ground. He was able to move his arms and legs and suffered only a sprained leg. The Lancaster crashed bursting into flames, killing pilot Jack Newman and three other members of the crew. They are buried in the Hanover War Cemetery.

Alkemade was subsequently captured and interviewed by the Gestapo, who were initially suspicious of his claim to have fallen without a parachute. This was until the wreckage of the aircraft was examined and his parachute was found as Alkemade had described it. The Germans gave Alkemade a certificate testifying to the fact. He was a celebrated prisoner of war, before being repatriated in May 1945.

== Later life ==
Alkemade worked in the chemical industry after the war. He appeared on the ITV series &quot;Just Amazing!&quot;, a programme where former motorcycle racer Barry Sheene interviewed people who had, through accident or design, achieved feats of daring and survival. He also appeared on &quot;I&#x27;ve Got A Secret&quot; on BBC One, Wednesday 5th December 1984.

Alkemade died on 22 June 1987 in Liskeard, Cornwall aged 64. 

In January 2020, 115 Squadron at RAF Wittering voted to rename a building as &quot;The Alkemade Building&quot; in honour of his achievements in the RAF during World War 2.

<text>ABC Radio Sydney (official call sign: 2BL, formerly 2SB) is an ABC radio station in Sydney, Australia. It is the flagship station in the ABC Local Radio network and broadcasts on 702 kHz on the AM dial. The station transmits with a power (CMF) of 3,110V, which is equivalent to 50 kW (the maximum permissible in Australia) from a site west of the Sydney CBD.

== History ==
ABC Radio Sydney is the first public radio station in Australia opened in Sydney at 8:00pm on 13 November 1923. Its first callsign was &quot;2SB&quot; where &quot;2&quot; denotes the State of New South Wales and &quot;SB&quot; stood for Sydney Broadcasters Limited. The callsign was changed to &quot;2BL&quot; when Broadcasters Limited took over the business.
In May 1928 the Sydney Broadcasting Company was formed to take over stations 2BL and 2FC.

A year later a consortium of entertainment companies founded the Australian Broadcasting Company Limited (ABC) to supply programme material to 2BL, 2FC and similar &quot;A-class&quot; stations in other capital cities.
2BL became one of the inaugural stations, along with sister station 2FC, in the government-owned Australian Broadcasting Commission (also ABC) network when it was founded in 1932. In 1946, it became the flagship of the National Programme, forerunner of Radio National. It also began carrying parliamentary broadcasts. In 1963, it swapped formats with 2FC and assumed that station&#x27;s old role as flagship of the Interstate Programme, which eventually evolved into Local Radio. However, it continued to air parliament until 1988.

The 2BL callsign was gradually phased out in 1999 as the station was renamed to 702 ABC Sydney, before another name change in 2017 which saw the station simply become known as ABC Radio Sydney.

In the second radio ratings survey of 2012, Nielsen Media Research recorded ABC Radio Sydney&#x27;s share of the local radio market as the second largest at 10.3%, behind commercial talk station 2GB.
Most ABC Local Radio stations in New South Wales simulcast ABC Radio Sydney&#x27;s programming when not airing local shows for their areas. The exception is 999 ABC Broken Hill, which relays ABC Radio Adelaide due to Broken Hill being on Central Time.

In November 2023, ABC Radio Sydney celebrated its 100th birthday. The station marked the occasion by removing the time signal pips which had long been heard at the top of each hour before the hourly &quot;ABC News&quot; bulletin.

On 6 May 2024, ABC Radio Sydney commenced broadcasting from the ABC&#x27;s new facility at 6 &amp; 8 Parramatta Square in Parramatta after relocating from the ABC&#x27;s Ultimo headquarters. &quot;Mornings&quot; with Sarah Macdonald was the first program to broadcast from Parramatta after the facility was officially opened by Kim Williams, David Anderson and Andrew Charlton.

<text>The 1973 Manitoba general election was held on June 28, 1973 to elect Members of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Manitoba, Canada. It was won by the social-democratic New Democratic Party, which took 31 of 57 seats to win government in its own right for the first time. The Progressive Conservative Party finished second with 21, while the Manitoba Liberal Party took the remaining five. The Manitoba Social Credit Party lost its only seat.

A right-of-centre municipal organization known as the Independent Citizens&#x27; Election Committee convinced the Progressive Conservative and Liberal parties to avoid competing against each other in certain Winnipeg-area ridings, such that a single &quot;anti-socialist&quot; alternative to the NDP could be offered. This campaign was generally unsuccessful.

<text>Vittorio Storaro, A.S.C., A.I.C. (born 24 June 1940), is an Italian cinematographer widely recognized as one of the best and most influential in cinema history, for his work on numerous classic films including &quot;The Conformist&quot; (1970), &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; (1979), and &quot;The Last Emperor&quot; (1987). In the course of over fifty years, he has collaborated with directors such as Bernardo Bertolucci, Francis Ford Coppola, Warren Beatty, Woody Allen, and Carlos Saura.

He has received three Academy Awards for Best Cinematography for the films &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;, &quot;Reds&quot; (1981), and &quot;The Last Emperor&quot;, and is one of three living persons who has won the award three times, the others being Robert Richardson and Emmanuel Lubezki.

==Early life==

Storaro was born in Rome. The son of a film projectionist, Storaro began studying photography at the age of 11. He went on to formal cinematography studies at the national Italian film school, Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia, when he was 18.

==Career==
Storaro is considered to be one of the greatest and most influential cinematographers of all time. He has worked with many important film directors, in particular Bernardo Bertolucci, with whom he has had a long collaboration. His philosophy is largely inspired by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe&#x27;s theory of colors, which focuses in part on the psychological effects that different colors have and the way in which colors influence our perceptions of different situations.

He first worked with Bertolucci on &quot;The Conformist&quot; (1970). Set in fascist Italy, the film has been described as a &quot;visual masterpiece&quot;.

Also in 1970, he photographed &quot;The Bird with the Crystal Plumage&quot;, the directorial debut of Dario Argento and a landmark film in the giallo genre.

The first American film that Storaro worked on was &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; (1979). Director Francis Ford Coppola gave him free rein on the film&#x27;s visual look. &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; earned Storaro his first Academy Award.

He worked with Warren Beatty for the first time on &quot;Reds&quot; (1981), and ended up winning his second Academy Award.

Storaro won a third Academy Award for &quot;The Last Emperor&quot; (1987), directed by Bertolucci. Three years later he received a nomination, but did not win, for the Beatty film &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;.

In 2002, Storaro completed the first in a series of books that articulate his philosophy of cinematography.

He was the cinematographer for a BBC co-production with Italian broadcaster RAI of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Rigoletto&quot; over two nights on the weekend of 4 and 5 September 2010.

Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Café Society&quot; (2016) was the first film that Storaro shot digitally; he used the Sony F65 camera.

In 2017, Storaro was honored with the George Eastman Award. The same year he also attended the New York Film Festival at which he debated with Ed Lachman on cinematography and its transition to digital.

His other film credits include &quot;1900&quot;, &quot;Last Tango in Paris&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;One from the Heart&quot;, &quot;Bulworth&quot;, &quot;The Sheltering Sky&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Ladyhawke&quot;, &quot;Tango&quot;, and &quot;Goya en Burdeos&quot;.

With his son Fabrizio, he created the Univisium format system to unify all future theatrical and television movies into one respective aspect ratio of 2.00:1. As of 2023, this unification has not happened, and the universal replacement of 4:3 televisions by large, wide-screen displays greatly reduces the need to modify scope-ratio films for home theater presentation.

==Personal life==
Storaro is known for stylish, fastidious, and flamboyant personal fashion. Francis Ford Coppola once noted, &quot;Vittorio is the only man I ever knew that could fall off a ladder in a white suit, into the mud, and not get dirty.&quot;

<text>Haymarket station is an underground Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) rapid transit station located at Haymarket Square in downtown Boston, Massachusetts. It is a transfer station between the Green Line and Orange Line of the MBTA subway system, as well as a terminal for MBTA bus routes serving northern and northeastern suburbs. The two lines run parallel to each other through the station, with two side platforms for the Orange Line and a single island platform for the Green Line. The station is fully accessible.

The Tremont Street subway, predecessor of the modern Green Line, opened in 1898. It had a four-track streetcar station at Haymarket. The subway was also used by the Main Line, predecessor of the Orange Line, from 1901 to 1908. The Main Line was rerouted into the Washington Street tunnel, with Union and Friend stations at Haymarket Square, in 1908. Union and Friend were renamed Haymarket in 1967. In 1971, the MBTA replaced the original Haymarket station with a new station slightly to the south. Demolition of a parking garage caused several closures of the station in 2021–2023.

==Station layout==

Because the Washington Street Tunnel was built to replace the Tremont Street subway for Main Line Elevated use – and to share the Canal Street incline – the Green Line and Orange Line are parallel and approximately the same depth at Haymarket. The Green Line, to the west of the Orange Line, has two tracks serving an island platform divided in half by a wall. The Orange Line has two tracks serving two side platforms. A sub-passage at the north end of the platforms allows transfer between the two lines.

The two lines have separate primary entrances, although the sub-passage allows both lines to be reached from either entrance. The Green Line entrance is located north of Sudbury Street, under the east end of the Government Center Garage. The Green Line fare lobby is level with the platform. The Orange Line entrance is inside the Boston Public Market building south of Sudbury Street. A mezzanine level is between the street-level fare lobby and the platforms. Two elevators connect the Orange Line entrance to the two platforms, and another pair connect the platforms to the sub-passage. An elevator connects the Green Line entrance to the fare lobby, and the Green Line platform to the sub-passage.

Haymarket is a major bus transfer station, with a (presently closed) two-lane busway off Surface Road adjacent to the Green Line headhouse. It is served by MBTA bus routes – – which include several local routes to Charlestown and Chelsea as well as express routes to northern suburbs and the North Shore. Haymarket is also the terminus for several early-morning round trips, which are extensions of routes that normally terminate at subway stations outside downtown. The trips are primarily intended for MBTA station agents, but are open to the public.
==History==
===Tremont Street subway===

The Tremont Street subway (future Green Line), including Haymarket, was built starting in 1894 and opened on September 3, 1898. The original trolley station was larger than the current station and consisted of four tracks with a pair of island platforms. The inner pair of tracks served cars from the northern suburbs which turned at Brattle Loop at Scollay Square (now Government Center) station, while the outer tracks served streetcars that ran through the entire Tremont Street subway to the Public Gardens portal and Pleasant Street portal. All cars entered the subway through the Canal Street incline just north of Haymarket.

===Main Line Elevated===
On June 10, 1901, the Boston Elevated Railway&#x27;s Main Line (future Orange Line) was opened from to . The Tremont Street subway was retrofitted to allow operation of the Main Line elevated cars. Main Line trains from the Charlestown Elevated entered the tunnel through the outer tracks of the Canal Street portal and exited through the Pleasant Street portal to the Washington Street Elevated. Elevated cars ran on the outer tracks at Haymarket, served by temporary high platforms; streetcars continued to use the inner tracks, which connected to a turnback loop at Adams Square station.

On November 30, 1908, a new Washington Street Tunnel opened for use by Main Line trains, and the whole Tremont Street subway was returned to streetcar use. The Washington Street Tunnel ran separately from the Tremont Street subway; however, because both tunnels used the newly expanded Canal Street incline, the Main Line platforms at Haymarket Square were immediately adjacent to the Tremont Street subway. Like the other Washington Street Tunnel stations, the two Main Line platforms were named after nearby streets. The northbound platform was Union and the southbound platform Friend – collectively called, Union–Friend.

The track configuration at Haymarket after 1908 was similar to the original 1898 setup – the outer tracks served streetcars running through the subway, while the center tracks served cars turning at Brattle Loop at Scollay Square. The last (route #93) streetcars to use the inner tracks ran on July 2, 1949, although a North Station to Scollay Square shuttle ran until September 1952. After that, only emergency and special service cars used the inner tracks.

===MBTA era===

On October 28, 1963, the tunnel between Haymarket and the newly renamed Government Center station was realigned, and Adams Square station was closed. The outer tracks at Haymarket now connected directly to the through tracks at Government Center, while the center tracks connected to Brattle Loop. On January 26, 1967, Union and Friend platforms were officially renamed Haymarket.

On May 10, 1971, the MBTA opened a new Green Line platform at Haymarket, located south (inbound) of the 1898-built station. The new island platform occupies the space of the former center tracks, which were reconnected to the through tracks just south of the new platform. The original 1898 platforms are still visible in the tunnel from Green Line cars traveling just north of the new platforms. The empty space is now used for electrical equipment and occasional storage. A new entrance and busway under the Government Center Garage opened on December 20, 1971. In August 1975, the MBTA released plans to modernize four downtown stations, including the Orange Line platforms at Haymarket.

The Haymarket North Extension opened on April 7, 1975, replacing the Charlestown Elevated. North of Haymarket, the Orange Line tracks were redirected from the Canal Street incline into a new tunnel to North Station, and then under the Charles River. In June 2004, the Green Line was similarly rerouted, with the Canal Street incline closing entirely in favor of a tunnel to a newly rebuilt &quot;superstation&quot; at North Station. That spacious new facility allows convenient cross-platform transfers between the inbound Green and Orange Lines, as well as full outbound connections, lessening the importance of Haymarket as a rail transfer station. However, Haymarket station remains a major bus transfer station, served by many routes.
===Renovations===

A 2000–01 renovation, part of the Parcel 7 construction, added elevators to all levels of Haymarket. This made the Orange Line accessible at the station. A $15 million project to build raised platforms at and Haymarket began in 2001 and was completed by 2003. On June 24, 2019, the MBTA Board awarded a $29.7 million, 16-month contract for full cleaning, wayfinding signage replacement, and other improvements at North Station, Haymarket, State, and Downtown Crossing stations. Much of the cosmetic work at Haymarket, including painting and floor repairs, was completed over the weekend of August 30–September 1, 2019. The work was completed in June 2021.

Part of the Bulfinch Crossing development will be built over the busway in the early 2020s; the project will include a modernization of the Green Line entrance and the busway. A temporary closure of the station during construction was originally considered; the developer later agreed to keep the station open, though temporary closures of the north headhouse may be needed. By February 2020, the section of the garage above the station was planned to be demolished in December 2020; however, this was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The busway closed on June 28, 2021, with buses stopping on nearby streets. Demolition of the garage required several weekend closures of portions of the Green and Orange lines, as well as a weekend closure of just the station, in early 2022. Construction of the development and the new busway is expected to take 36 months.

After a portion of the garage collapsed on March 26, 2022, Orange Line and Green Line service through the station was temporarily suspended pending inspection of the tunnels. Orange Line service resumed on March 29, with trains bypassing Haymarket. After removal of about of debris followed by tunnel inspection and testing, Green Line service resumed on April 9, with Haymarket station remaining closed for repairs to the standpipe system. The station reopened on April 10. The Orange and Green lines were again closed through Haymarket from June 23–26, 2022, after the discovery of a deteriorated garage support column.

The station was closed in August and September 2022 during overlapping closures of the Orange Line (August 19 to September 18) and the northern portion of the Green Line (August 22 to September 18). The closures allowed for maintenance work as well as further demolition of the garage. Weekend closures of the Orange and Green lines to accommodate garage construction continued into 2023. Green Line service was again suspended from September 18 to October 12, 2023, with Orange Line trains skipping Haymarket station during that closure.

<text>Flint Hills National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) is a wildlife refuge located north and east of the city of Hartford, Kansas, United States, in northwestern Coffey and southeastern Lyon Counties. It was established in 1966 as part of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, John Redmond Reservoir flood control project. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service manages 18,463 acres (75 km2) upstream of the reservoir, most of which is in the floodplain of the Neosho River. Refuge habitats, consisting of prairie grasslands, bottomland hardwood timber, shallow wetlands, and croplands, are managed to provide food and habitat for migratory birds and resident wildlife.

The Refuge is an important resting area for waterfowl migrating through Kansas. Thousands of mallards, blue-winged teal, Canada geese, and snow geese can be seen on the Refuge during their spring and fall migrations. The Refuge also provides valuable habitat for shorebirds, bald eagles, wild turkey, bobwhite quail, bobcats, white-tailed deer, and many species of warblers. The Refuge has been designated as an Important Bird Area and serves as a wintering area for bald eagles and dozens of red-tailed hawks, northern harriers, and rough-legged hawks.

<doc id="1026606" wikidata="Q4405386" url="?curid=1026606" title="Sweet crude oil">
<text>Sweet crude oil is a type of petroleum. The New York Mercantile Exchange designates petroleum with less than 0.5% sulfur as &quot;sweet&quot;.

Petroleum containing higher levels of sulfur is called sour crude oil.

Sweet crude oil contains small amounts of hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide. High-quality, low-sulfur crude oil is commonly used for processing into gasoline and is in high demand, particularly in industrialized nations. &quot;Light sweet crude oil&quot; is the most sought-after version of crude oil as it contains a disproportionately large fraction that is directly processed (fractionation) into gasoline (naphtha), kerosene, and high-quality diesel (gas oil). 

The term &quot;sweet&quot; originates from the fact that a low level of sulfur provides the oil with a relatively sweet taste and pleasant smell, compared to sulfurous oil. Nineteenth-century prospectors would taste and smell small quantities of oil to determine its quality.

==Pricing==

The term &quot;price of oil&quot;, as used in the U.S. media, generally means the cost per barrel (42 U.S. gallons) of West Texas Intermediate Crude, to be delivered to Cushing, Oklahoma during the upcoming month. This information is available from NYMEX or the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

<text>D&#x27;Arcy Francis Niland (20 October 191729 March 1967) was an Australian farm labourer, novelist and short story writer. In 1955 he wrote &quot;The Shiralee&quot;, which gained international recognition in its depictions of the experiences of a swagman and his four-year-old daughter. It was made into a 1957 film, starring Peter Finch, and a 1987 TV mini-series, starring Bryan Brown. Niland married fellow writer Ruth Park (1917–2010) on 11 May 1942 and the couple had five children: Anne (born ca. June 1943), Rory, Patrick and twin daughters, Kilmeny (1950–2009) and Deborah (1950–present). Niland died on 29 March 1967 of a myocardial infarction, aged 49.

==Early life==

D&#x27;Arcy Niland was born Darcy Francis Niland on 20 October 1917 in the rural town of Glen Innes, New South Wales. His father Francis Augustus Niland was a cooper and wool classer, and his mother was Barbara Lucy, née Egan. He was the eldest of six children in the Irish-Catholic family. Niland was named by his father after the boxer, Les Darcy (1895–1917), he changed the form of his first name to D&#x27;Arcy as an adult. He attended the Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart school in Glen Innes.

Niland left school at 14 and two years later he briefly worked in Sydney as a copy boy for &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper, hoping to become a reporter. His poem &quot;Old Folks&#x27; Christmas&quot;, was printed in December 1934 and was followed by &quot;My Country&quot; in March 1935 in &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;. In December 1935 he wrote an article, &quot;Lore and Legends of the Christmas Tree&quot;, for the same newspaper. The Great Depression ended this avenue of employment, however, and for some years he travelled the country, finding work in a wide variety of occupations including as a farm labourer, opal miner, circus hand, potato digger, and shearing shed roustabout. In the late 1930s he returned to Sydney where he worked as a railway porter. During World War II, Niland was rejected for military service due to a heart condition – he worked as a shearer under the Manpower Directorate.

On 11 May 1942 Niland married New Zealand-born journalist and fellow author, Rosina Ruth Park. Eventually the couple had five children: Anne (born ca. June 1943), Rory, Patrick and twin daughters, Kilmeny (1950–2009) and Deborah (1950-present). After their wedding, Niland and Park travelled through the Australian outback – he worked as a shearer and she worked as a cook – before settling in Surry Hills in 1943, then a tough working-class suburb of Sydney.

==Career==
Together they earned a living writing full-time and garnering critical praise for their works. By January 1944 both Niland and Park had each written radio scripts for Australian Broadcasting Commission&#x27;s serial, &quot;Children&#x27;s Session&quot;, and collaborated on a Christmas play, &quot;The Disappointed Dumpling&quot;.

Between 1949 and 1952, Niland won many prizes for his short stories and novels and, three years later, achieved international fame with the novel &quot;The Shiralee&quot;. This was followed by &quot;Call Me When the Cross Turns Over&quot; (1957) and four more novels. He also wrote radio and television plays, and hundreds of short stories, some of which were collected and published in four volumes from 1961 to 1966.

Of all Niland&#x27;s books, &quot;The Shiralee&quot; remains his most renowned. It portrays the wanderings and experiences of an Australian swagman named Macauley and his daughter. It was published in 1955 and made into a 1957 film, starring Peter Finch, and a 1987 TV mini-series, starring Bryan Brown. Niland also compiled a collection of Australian folk songs, releasing them under the title &quot;Travelling songs of old Australia&quot; (1966).

==Posthumous work and personal life==
Park edited the pick of her husband&#x27;s short stories after his death and they were published by Penguin Books in 1987. She also completed his research into the life of Les Darcy, releasing it in the form of a biography, &quot;Home Before Dark&quot; (1995), that was written with her son-in-law Rafe Champion. The Darcy biography is drawn from Niland&#x27;s immense archive of books, photographs, clippings, letters, unpublished memoirs and taped interviews about the ill-fated boxer, supplemented by subsequent research. (A hero to many Irish Australians, Darcy had died of an infection in America at the height of his sporting powers, only a few months before Niland&#x27;s birth in 1917.)

Picking up where Niland left off, the Park-completed biography is a carefully compiled chronicle of Darcy&#x27;s short life as seen through the eyes of his contemporaries. It also throws light on the Australian national mood during the years of World War I.

Park&#x27;s autobiographies &quot;A Fence around the Cuckoo&quot; and &quot;Fishing in the Styx&quot; include details of her life with Niland and their five children. Their twin daughters, Kilmeny and Deborah, both forged successful careers as book illustrators.

==Death==
Niland was burdened with a chronic heart condition (it had prevented him from serving with the Australian armed forces during World War II), and he died at the age of 49.

Park died in Sydney in 2010, aged 93. Her obituary appeared in &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; newspaper on 17 December of that year.

Webster&#x27;s father, Ebenezer Webster told his son that he could have had Abiel Foster&#x27;s place in the Congress if he had more votes. Ebenezer extolled the virtues of an education to his son, explaining that it was an education that made the difference between him and Foster. He said that &quot;It is education that has made Foster what he is and the lack of it has made your father what he is&quot;.

<doc id="1026621" wikidata="Q1812600" url="?curid=1026621" title="Brooklyn Law School">
<text>Brooklyn Law School (BLS) is a private law school in New York City. Founded in 1901, it has approximately 1,100 students. Brooklyn Law School&#x27;s faculty includes 60 full-time faculty, 15 emeriti faculty, and adjunct faculty.

==History==
The origins of Brooklyn Law School can be traced back to the Pratt Institute in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, when, in the 1890s, the school established its Department of Commerce. Because of its overwhelming popularity, the Department of Commerce broke off from the main Institute and formed its own school under the guidance of Norman P. Heffley, personal secretary to Charles Pratt. The Heffley School of Commerce originally shared facilities with Pratt.

In 1901, William Payson Richardson and Norman P. Heffley reorganized the Heffley School to become Brooklyn Law School, the first law school on Long Island. Using space provided by Heffley&#x27;s business school, the law school opened on September 30, 1901, with five faculty members (including Richardson as dean and Heffley as president), and two special lecturers.

The year began with five students and ended with 28. In late 1901, the Board of Regents of the State of New York granted a charter to the law school. The law school became fully accredited by the American Bar Association in 1937, and became a member of the Association of American Law Schools in 1973. The law school&#x27;s curriculum is registered with and approved by the New York State Education Department.

From its opening, Brooklyn Law School opened its door to minorities, women, and immigrants, and it offered night classes for those with full-time jobs. Dean Richardson also allowed students who had difficulty paying tuition to remain enrolled on credit. The school moved twice between 1901 and 1928, when it finally moved into the first building designed and built specifically for it at 375 Pearl Street in downtown Brooklyn.

The school was affiliated with St. Lawrence University from 1903 to 1943. World War II struck Brooklyn Law School especially hard, and by 1943 enrollment was down to 174 students. St. Lawrence University, which until then operated Brooklyn Law School and conferred its degrees, decided to shut down the school. Alumni organized and negotiated the repurchase of the school&#x27;s assets, ensuring that Brooklyn Law School would operate as an independent institution.

In 1969, the repurchased school moved to its current location at 250 Joralemon Street, selling its old Pearl Street location to Brooklyn Friends School, who still occupies the building.

==Academics==

===Admissions===

For 2023, Brooklyn Law School accepted 50% of applicants with 20.12% of those accepted enrolling.

===Clinics===
In 2009, Brooklyn Law School clinical program was ranked 28th in the nation. In 2010, The National Jurist ranked BLS fourth in the country for its public service work, largely influenced by its clinical program. The clinics specialize in the areas of bankruptcy, securities arbitration, immigration, entrepreneurship, technology, criminal law, real estate practice, intellectual property, and mediation. Students represent individual clients, groups, and businesses and appear in state, federal, and administrative courts, on both the trial and appellate levels. Brooklyn Law School created a new mandate in 2014 that requires students to complete at least one clinic or externship course before graduation. Among the law school&#x27;s clinics include:
* The Advocates for Adults With Intellectual and Developmental Disability (AAIDD) Clinic represents low-income New Yorkers and their families in a variety of civil matters that impact adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities, and provides the opportunity for students to advocate in diverse areas of law ranging from public benefits, guardianship, housing and access to government services.
* The Brooklyn Law Incubator and Policy Clinic, (BLIP), functions like a law firm that represents Internet, new media, communications, and other tech entrepreneurs and innovators on both business and policy advocacy. Students work with clients on transactional, litigation, policy, and other advocacy projects and interact and strategize with members of the entrepreneurial, technology and financial communities, as well as with legislators, regulators and other policymakers.
* Capital Defender and Federal Habeas Clinic affords students the opportunity to represent death row inmates (post-conviction) in other states and defendants in New York who have filed federal habeas corpus petitions. The work consists of filing petitions in the U.S. Supreme Court.
* Community Development Clinic provides opportunities for students to represent community development corporations, cultural institutions, affordable housing providers, and small businesses that serve under-represented communities.

==Bar passage rate and career prospects==
In 2024, Brooklyn Law School reported an 87% pass rate for first-time New York Bar Exam takers, a nine-point increase from the previous year and the highest rate in a decade. The school&#x27;s overall pass rate for first-time takers was 78.82%.

In 2017, 78.6% of the law school&#x27;s first-time test takers passed the bar exam, placing the law school as the 8th-highest among New York&#x27;s 15 law schools. Of 369 graduates in 2016, nine months after graduation 323 were employed. Alumni live in 49 states and over 25 countries after graduation. The law school was ranked 46th of all law schools nationwide by the &quot;National Law Journal&quot; in terms of sending the highest percentage of 2018 graduates to the largest 100 law firms in the US (9%).

In 2013, 94% of the law school&#x27;s first-time test takers passed the New York bar exam, third-best among New York&#x27;s 15 law schools.

In 2012, five Brooklyn Law School graduates filed a class action lawsuit, which was dismissed the following year, alleging consumer fraud and common law fraud. As part of a series of identical lawsuits against law schools nationwide, the complaint alleged that the law school administration incorrectly reported employment and salary information for the purpose of enticing students to attend the law school. Prior to the lawsuit, Brooklyn Law School had claimed that 95% or more of graduates found employment within 9 months of graduation, without always distinguishing between full-time, part-time, and non-JD-required employment (which breakdown ABA/NALP rules did not require at the time of the statistics at issue in the suit, but which breakdown has been required since 2012). In April 2013, NY State Supreme Court Justice David Schmidt dismissed the lawsuit, finding that the school&#x27;s disclaimers on its employment and salary data warned graduates that their own post-grad earnings may not measure up to the data.

Of the law school&#x27;s 368 graduates in 2017, nine months after graduation all were employed other than 26 who were seeking employment, and 4 who were not seeking employment (the employment status of 4 was unknown); 269 had secured jobs practicing law, and 40 had taken a J.D. advantage position. Brooklyn Law School&#x27;s Law School Transparency under-employment score was 16.2%, indicating the percentage of the Class of 2017 unemployed, pursuing an additional degree, or working in a non-professional, short-term, or part-time job nine months after graduation.

The law school was ranked # 46 of all law schools nationwide by the &quot;National Law Journal&quot; in terms of sending the highest percentage of 2018 graduates to the largest 100 law firms in the US (9%).

==Location and facilities==

Brooklyn Law School&#x27;s academic and administrative buildings and main student residence is located in Downtown Brooklyn, near many federal and state courts and corporate and public interest law offices.

The law school draws on a large body of practitioners, public officials, and judges as adjunct faculty to teach specialized courses in many areas of law, including international sales law, securities law, real estate development, trial advocacy, business crimes, corporate litigation, sports law, and border and homeland security law. In addition, in any given semester, visiting professors come from all over the world to teach at the school.

The law school is home to several well-known scholars, including torts professor Aaron Twerski, and Elizabeth Schneider, an expert on gender, law, and civil procedure. Both were highly ranked in Brian Leiter&#x27;s survey of &quot;Most Cited Law Professors by Specialty.&quot;

<text>Kirwin National Wildlife Refuge is a National Wildlife Refuge of the United States located in Kansas. It was established in 1954 for the conservation and management of wildlife resources, particularly migratory birds. The Kirwin Dam was built in the early 1950s near Kirwin, Kansas, and the reservoir created in the process provides water to the refuge.

==Ecology==
The refuge is located along the North Fork of the Solomon River in the region where tallgrass prairie meets shortgrass prairie on the Great Plains. This merging of grassland types brings a diversity of flora and fauna to the area. Other habitat types include wetlands and cropland. More than 300 species of birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, and fish inhabit the refuge.

Four federally listed and two state-listed threatened and endangered species of birds can be observed. Twenty-eight other birds of conservation concern use the refuge during their annual migrations, and nine nest there. In ideal conditions, up to a million ducks and geese aggregate there. Large numbers of shorebirds migrate through the refuge in late summer. Hundreds of great blue herons and double-crested cormorants nest in the flooded timber, and interior least terns nest when the water is lower. Populations of greater prairie chickens and black-tailed prairie dogs occur on the refuge.

==Recreation==
Recreational activities include car tours, wildlife observation, boating, fishing, hiking, hunting, and educational programs. There is a visitor center and a museum.

<doc id="1026649" wikidata="Q991084" url="?curid=1026649" title="Brown v. Board of Education National Historical Park">
<text>&quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; National Historical Park was established in Topeka, Kansas, on October 26, 1992, by the United States Congress to commemorate the landmark decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in the case &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; aimed at ending racial segregation in public schools. On May 17, 1954, the Supreme Court unanimously declared that &quot;separate educational facilities are inherently unequal&quot; and, as such, violated the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which guarantees all citizens &quot;equal protection of the laws.&quot;

The National Historical Park consists of Monroe Elementary School, one of the four segregated elementary schools for African American children in Topeka, and the adjacent grounds. It was originally known as &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; National Historic Site until it was redesignated and expanded on May 13, 2022. The Park will also include Summerton High School and Scott’s Branch High School in Summerton, South Carolina, upon acquisition of property. Five additional schools were authorized as affiliated areas of the National Park Service: Robert Russa Moton School in Farmville, Virginia; Howard High School in Wilmington, Delaware; Claymont High School in Claymont, Delaware; Hockessin Colored School #107 in Hockessin, Delaware; and John Philip Sousa Junior High School in Washington, D.C. The National Park Service will not own these sites but will provide financial and technical assistance to exhibit their history.

The &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; case was consolidated with four other cases on school segregation: &quot;Briggs v. Elliott&quot; (filed in South Carolina), &quot;Davis v. County School Board of Prince Edward County&quot; (filed in Virginia), &quot;Gebhart v. Belton&quot; (filed in Delaware), and &quot;Bolling v. Sharpe&quot; (filed in Washington, D.C.). Inclusion of the history of these schools will show a broader story of educational racism and the legal fight against it.

==History of the Topeka site==

The story of Monroe Elementary begins long before the &quot;Brown&quot; decision. In 1855, John Ritchie, an abolitionist, bought 160 acres (65 ha) from Jacob Chase in Topeka, Kansas. After the Civil War a number of newly freed African Americans came to Topeka and built homes on this land. Due to the sizable African American population, the school board decided to establish a school for black children in the neighborhood. &quot;Ritchie&#x27;s Addition&quot; became the site of Monroe School. After Ritchie&#x27;s death in 1887, the land was purchased by the Topeka Board of Education to build a school for African American children.

The current building is actually the third Monroe school to sit on the corner of Fifteenth and Monroe streets. The first school was located in a small rented building used from 1868 until a permanent structure was erected in 1874. The current building was constructed in 1926 immediately south of the old school. It was one of many schools in Topeka designed by the prominent Topeka architect Thomas W. Williamson between 1920 and 1935. His firm, Williamson and Co., was hired by the Topeka Board of Education to design a series of progressive schools. Monroe Elementary School is a two-story brick and limestone building in the Italian Renaissance Revival style. The building was made with some of the best materials and the most modern technology of the time.

In a 2004 interview for PBS station KTWU, one of the teachers from Monroe, Barbara Ross, recalled:

I feel they were good schools. They had qualified black teachers ... very qualified. Many people ... well, I&#x27;ll say some people ... felt that the supplies and things that were furnished in the buildings were not comparable with those in the white schools only because they were probably older buildings. They had the same books and we&#x27;ve heard a lot of things about that. But they had the same books that the others had because so many of the black teachers were on the committees to select the books—the textbooks. So we know we had the same books that they did. It&#x27;s true—everything wasn&#x27;t just right because the things in the community weren&#x27;t just right. We couldn&#x27;t go eat any place. We couldn&#x27;t go to the theater and sit any place. We couldn&#x27;t live in an apartment or go to a motel; we had to stay with a black family when we came here to teach.
Monroe was the newest of the four segregated schools serving Topeka&#x27;s African American community. The other schools were Buchanan, McKinley, and Washington. Washington no longer stands and the Topeka Board of Education no longer owns the remaining schools.

In the &quot;Brown&quot; case, the legal opinion was not that the schools for black children in Kansas were qualitatively worse in construction, books, etc. than the schools for white children. Instead, the opinion was that school segregation by itself was an unfair detriment to the education of black children. The holding that &quot;separate&quot; by itself was unconstitutional was what made &quot;Brown&quot; the landmark case in school desegregation. From the decision:

Does segregation of children in public schools solely on the basis of race, even though the physical facilities and other &quot;tangible&quot; factors may be equal, deprive the children of the minority group of equal educational opportunities? We believe that it does.

=== Changing ownership ===
Monroe School was closed in 1975 due to declining enrollment. The school district utilized the school building as a warehouse and the grounds for parking buses and performing vehicle maintenance. Eventually the school and grounds were sold to private owners. Monroe Elementary remained in private ownership for more than fifteen years. Richard Appelhans and Richard L. Plush Jr. intended to convert the school to offices or a private school, but they instead sold it in 1982. The new owner was the Church of the Nazarene which used the property as a community outreach program center and meeting place. The next owner, Mark A. Steuve, President of S/S Builders purchased the school from the church in 1988 for use as a warehouse. In 1990, Steuve announced his intention to auction the building off.

The Brown Foundation began a crusade to save Monroe Elementary School from being sold. After a series of letter writing campaigns and meetings with local Congressional leadership and the Trust for Public Land the school was secured. The Trust for Public Land purchased the property in 1991 and it was added to the National Historic Landmark nomination for the Sumner Elementary School, listed in 1987. On October 26, 1992, President George H. W. Bush signed legislation establishing &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; National Historic Site. The title was transferred to the National Park Service in December 1993.


== South Carolina sites ==
Summerton High School was an all-white school that refused to admit Black students, who had to attend Scott&#x27;s Branch High School, which was built in 1951 to purportedly provide a comparable educational environment for African American students. The inequality between them was challenged in the &quot;Briggs v. Elliott&quot; case which was consolidated with &quot;Brown v. Board&quot;.

== Affiliated areas ==
The designation of these sites as affiliated areas of the National Park Service is pending identification of an “appropriate management entity” for each site, as of May 2023.

<text>Katharine Susan Anthony, sometimes also spelled Katherine (November 27, 1877 – November 20, 1965), was a US biographer best known for &quot;The Lambs&quot; (1945), a controversial study of the British writers Charles and Mary Lamb.

==Biography==

Katharine Anthony was born in Roseville, Logan County, Arkansas, the third daughter of Ernest Augustus Anthony (1846-1904) and Susan Jane Cathey (1845-1917). Her father was a grocer and later a police officer.

She studied at Peabody College for Teachers in Nashville, the universities of Heidelberg and Freiburg, and the University of Chicago. She received a Ph.B degree from Chicago in 1905 and taught at Wellesley College in 1907. She became a public school teacher by 1910 and worked at that time in Fort Smith, Sebastian County, Arkansas. She moved from Arkansas perhaps because her mother had died in 1917, and by 1920 she was living in Manhattan with her life-partner Elisabeth Irwin (1880–1942), the founder of the Little Red School House, with whom she raised several adopted children (source: &quot;Odd Girls and Twilight Lovers: A History of Lesbian Life in Twentieth Century America&quot;, Lillian Faderman, 1991).

Her book &quot;Catherine the Great&quot; was positively reviewed in the &quot;New York Times&quot; (Dec. 20, 1925, pg BR8), which notes that Miss Anthony had, apparently for the first time, access to all of Catherine&#x27;s private memoirs. Her book &quot;Marie Antoinette&quot; was called a &quot;...fresh and original life of Marie ...&quot; by the &quot;New York Times&quot; reviewer (Jan. 29, 1933 pg BR5).

Her books &quot;Catherine the Great&quot; and &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; each sold more than 100,000 copies.

She died at St. Vincent&#x27;s Hospital, two weeks after having a heart attack. Her obituary appeared in the &quot;New York Times&quot; on Nov. 22, 1965 (pg 37). She was survived by a sister, Mrs. Blanche Brown of Berkeley, California. Her funeral was in New York City, and she was buried alongside Miss Irwin, at Gaylordsville, Connecticut, where they had a summer home.

<text>Ralph Edward Flanders (September 28, 1880 – February 19, 1970) was an American mechanical engineer, industrialist and politician who served as a Republican U.S. Senator from the state of Vermont. He grew up on subsistence farms in Vermont and Rhode Island and was an apprentice machinist and draftsman before training as a mechanical engineer. He spent five years in New York City as an editor for a machine tool magazine. After moving back to Vermont, he managed and then became president of a successful machine tool company. Flanders used his experience as an industrialist to advise state and national commissions in Vermont, New England and Washington, D.C., on industrial and economic policy. He was president of the Boston Federal Reserve Bank for two years before being elected U.S. Senator from Vermont.

Flanders was noted for introducing a 1954 motion in the Senate to censure Senator Joseph McCarthy. McCarthy had made sensational claims that there were large numbers of Communists and Soviet spies and sympathizers inside the federal government and elsewhere. He used his Senate committee as a nationally televised forum for attacks on individuals whom he accused. Flanders felt that McCarthy&#x27;s attacks distracted the nation from a much greater threat of Communist successes elsewhere in the world and that they had the effect of creating division and confusion within the United States, to the advantage of its enemies. Ultimately, McCarthy&#x27;s tactics and his inability to substantiate his claims led to his being discredited and censured by the United States Senate.

==Early life and education==

Flanders was born in Barnet, Vermont, on September 28, 1880, the oldest of the nine children of Albert W. Flanders and Mary (Gilfillan) Flanders. When Flanders was six, his family moved to Lincoln, Rhode Island, where his father farmed while overseeing the manufacture and sales in Pawtucket of a bookrack he designed. Flanders attended school in Providence and Central Falls, and was an 1896 graduate of Central Falls High School.

== Career ==
In his first years as a machinist and draftsman, he spent his vacations traveling by bicycle over country roads between Rhode Island and Vermont and New Hampshire. Later, he lived for a time in New York City where he edited a machine tool magazine, but after five years decided to move back to Vermont.

Flanders&#x27;s career began with an apprenticeship, progressed into engineering, journalism, management, policy consulting, banking, finance, and finally politics when he was elected U.S. Senator from Vermont.

===Apprenticeship and continued education===
During his education in Rhode Island, Flanders received a solid grounding in mathematics, literature, Latin and Classical Greek. In addition, he acquired a working knowledge of German and French. According to Senator John Sparkman, when Flanders was in the Senate, Sparkman and he used to converse in Latin during committee meetings.

Unable to afford college tuition after his high school graduation, in 1896 Flanders&#x27;s father bought him a two-year apprenticeship at the Brown &amp; Sharpe Manufacturing Company, a leading machine tool builder. In addition to learning machining and drafting during his apprenticeship, Flanders also supplemented his training through courses at the International Correspondence Schools and the Rhode Island School of Design. Following his apprenticeship, he worked for various machine tool companies in New England. Despite his lack of a formal university education, he was a self-taught scholar, who read extensively in the literatures of science, engineering and the liberal arts.

===Technical journalism===
Flanders began writing early in his career, and his published articles on machine tool technology led to a job as an editor of &quot;Machine&quot; magazine in New York City. This job, which he held between 1905 and 1910, required him to cover developments in the machine tool industry. He traveled widely to visit the companies that he wrote about, which provided him many valuable contacts with leaders in the industry. As editor, he wrote articles on gear tooth systems, gear cutting machinery, hobs, and the manufacture of cans and automobiles, including &quot;Machine&#x27;s&quot; reference series on the subject.

In 1909, while working long hours on his definitive book on gear cutting machinery, his energy gave out and he suffered a &quot;nervous breakdown&quot;. He took time off to recover, and in 1910 he accepted an offer to work at a machine tool company in Vermont. He continued to write on technical and other matters throughout his life and developed a broad philosophy of the role of industry in society. In 1938, he received a Worcester Reed Warner Medal in recognition of his technical writing.

===Engineering===
Flanders&#x27;s first major experience in machine design came when he helped an entrepreneur in Nashua, New Hampshire, develop a box-folding machine. After that, he worked as a draftsman for General Electric in Lynn, Massachusetts until 1905, when he moved to New York City to work for &quot;Machine&quot;.

In 1910, he moved to Springfield, Vermont to work as a mechanical engineer for the Fellows Gear Shaper Company. He was already friendly with James Hartness, the president of the Jones &amp; Lamson Machine Company (J&amp;L), another company in town. In 1911, Flanders married Hartness&#x27; daughter, Helen. Shortly afterwards, Hartness hired Flanders as a manager of the department at J&amp;L that built the Fay automatic lathe. Flanders redesigned that lathe to achieve higher productivity and accuracy. He became a director in 1912 and president of the company in 1933 after Hartness retired. As president of J&amp;L, Flanders implemented a continuous production line to manufacture the Hartness Turret Lathe instead of building each machine individually, attempting to bring some of the efficiencies of mass production to machine tool building. By 1923, he had acquired and assigned more than twenty patents to J&amp;L.
Flanders and his brother, Ernest, were instrumental in developing screw thread grinding machines. These incorporated advances in thread technology (furthered by the Hartness optical comparator) and Flanders&#x27;s engineering calculations for gear-cutting machinery. In 1942, the two brothers received the Edward Longstreth Medal of the Franklin Institute as recognition of this accomplishment, which improved the accurate manufacture of die-cut screws in soft metal and solved the problem of thread-grinding on hardened work. The award also recognized their development of a precision grinding machine that enabled rapid production of turbine blades at the start of jet aircraft age, which made it possible for companies including General Electric to manufacture jet engines far more quickly than they could previously.

===Professional societies===
Flanders became president of the National Machine-Tool Builders Association in 1923. He served as president of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) from 1934 to 1936. He was vice president of the American Engineering Council in 1937. Throughout the 1930s, Flanders served as chairman of the Screw-Thread Committee of the American Standards Association. In 1944 the ASME awarded him the Hoover Medal for his &quot;public service in the field of social, civic and humanitarian effort[s]&quot;. The British Institution of Mechanical Engineers made him an honorary member.

===Public life===
In 1917, Flanders served in the Machine-Tool Section of the War Industries Board.

During the Great Depression Flanders began to write about social policy. His major concern was human development in a technological era. He addressed employing spiritual guidance with a &quot;program of human values&quot; to achieve a good life. Nevertheless, his underlying goal was to achieve &quot;full employment&quot;. So, he kept himself grounded in economic principles, as understood and debated during that era.

In 1933, Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s Secretary of Commerce, Daniel Roper, appointed Flanders to the Business Advisory Council, which was created to provide input to the administration on matters affecting business. The Council then made Flanders chairman of the Committee on Unemployment. This committee recommended addressing the problem both geographically and by industry. Flanders reported, however, that when the committee made its recommendations President Roosevelt was preoccupied with augmenting the Supreme Court and ultimately chose the undistributed profits tax instead—a choice that Flanders felt discouraged capital investment.

In 1933, the National Industrial Recovery Act created the National Recovery Administration (NRA). The NRA allowed industries to create &quot;codes of fair competition,&quot; intended to reduce destructive competition and to help workers by setting minimum wages and maximum weekly hours. Flanders was appointed to the industrial advisory board of the NRA. In a speech before a 1934 conference of the code authority members, attended by President Roosevelt, Flanders opposed a proposal by the Roosevelt administration to require that businesses cut worker hours by 10 percent and raise wages by 10 percent in order to spread employment more widely. Ultimately, economic policy moved away from the codes system.

In 1937, Vermont Governor George Aiken appointed Flanders to two commissions: first, the Special Milk Investigative Committee to study ways to modernize dairying in Vermont; and second, the Flood Control Commission, which chose Flanders as its chairman. This commission was to negotiate with other New England states a means of sharing costs in a system of flood-control dams as part of recovering from the massive floods of 1927 and attempting to prevent a reoccurrence.

In 1940, the New England Council elected Flanders president. The governors of the New England states had established this council to study industry and commerce in their states. Flanders&#x27;s role increased his awareness of the labor and business assets in New England. He also tried to alert his peers to the prospect of U.S. involvement in the expanding Second World War.

In 1942, Flanders became involved in the Committee for Economic Development (CED), an offshoot of the Business Advisory Council, whose purpose was to help re-align the nation to a peacetime economy after the war. Flanders reported helping to shape the CED&#x27;s recommendations to Congress on roles for the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.

===Banking and investment===
Starting in the 1930s, Flanders held positions on the board of directors of the Shawmut Bank (1938–41), Federal Reserve Bank of Boston (1941–44)
Boston and Maine Railroad, National Life Insurance Company, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Norwich University.

In 1944, he was elected to a two-year term as president of the Federal Reserve Bank in Boston. During this period, the bank helped establish the Boston Port Authority to revitalize New England&#x27;s capacity for sending and receiving goods by cargo ship.

In 1946, Georges Doriot, Flanders, Karl Compton and others organized American Research &amp; Development (AR&amp;D). This was the first venture capital company to invest—according to a set of investment rules and goals—in a pool of fledgling companies. Flanders served as a director of AR&amp;D.

==Politics==
In 1940, Ralph Flanders ran an unsuccessful campaign for the United States Senate. His Republican primary opponent was George Aiken, the popular two-term Governor of Vermont. Although Flanders admired and liked Aiken, he felt that Aiken&#x27;s &quot;liberal&quot; ideas would not help the nation&#x27;s economic recovery. In 1990, one of Vermont&#x27;s major newspapers, The &quot;Rutland Herald&quot; described the 1940 Republican primary campaign as dirty and mean. Aiken&#x27;s side accused Flanders of selling arms to the Nazis, and Flanders&#x27;s side suggested that &quot;Aiken was unduly influenced by his administrative assistant, a pretty 24-year-old with a fondness for power&quot;. In retrospect, Flanders felt that he had allowed his campaign advisers to make too many of the decisions. For example, a campaign brochure showed the candidate wearing a three-piece suit and holding a piglet in his arms. Although he had grown up on a subsistence farm and had an active interest in Vermont agriculture—especially in the type of hog shown in the picture—this had the effect of making him appear to be a phony. The &quot;Rutland Herald&quot; observed that, &quot;In Vermont in 1940, pigs were common to many households. But so was common sense. There were many people, most in fact, who did not want as their representative someone who would wear his best clothes if he intended to be handling pigs.&quot; Aiken won by 7,000 votes, having spent $3,219.50 to Flanders&#x27;s $18,698.45. This campaign taught Flanders that &quot;I had to be myself.&quot; 
In August 1946, incumbent Senator Warren Austin resigned to accept U.S. President Harry S. Truman&#x27;s appointment as Ambassador to the United Nations. The contest for the Republican nomination in the ensuing special election was between Flanders and Sterry R. Waterman. Flanders won the August 13 primary, which was then tantamount to election in Vermont. On November 1, Governor Mortimer R. Proctor appointed Flanders to complete the remainder of Austin&#x27;s term. With Flanders certain to win the November 5 election for the term that started in January 1947, his appointment to complete the two months left in Austin&#x27;s term gave him seniority over the freshman Senators who were elected on the same day. Vermont had not elected a Democrat to any statewide office since the founding of the Republican Party in 1854, and as expected, Flanders easily won his contest, receiving 75 percent to Democratic nominee Charles P. McDevitt&#x27;s 25. Flanders was overwhelmingly reelected in 1952, taking 72 percent to Democratic nominee Allan R. Johnston&#x27;s 28. He declined to seek a third term in 1958.

===Senate record and committee assignments===
Flanders&#x27;s voting record in the Senate was more conservative than his senior colleague, George Aiken, and reflected Flanders&#x27;s business orientation. In his second term, a Republican majority allowed Flanders to obtain seats on the Joint Economic Committee—this committee acted in an investigatory and advisory capacity to both Houses of the Congress—the Finance Committee and the Committee on Armed Services.

===Political philosophy===
Flanders, although himself a conservative, espoused a constructive competition between conservatism and liberalism. He felt that liberalism represented the welfare of individual people, as opposed to organizations—governments, businesses, etc.—preserving freedom of thought and action. For him, conservatism was concerned with preserving institutions that serve the interests of people, collectively. Conservatives, according to Flanders, could find themselves offering &quot;reasoned objections to foolish proposals&quot; by emotionally motivated liberals. He observed that, &quot;Even in the established democracies, ... the voters are easily seduced into leaving politics to skillful politicians who are themselves without a sense of general, social responsibility.&quot;

====On moral law in policy formulation====
Flanders had a strict Congregationalist religious beginning, which evolved with his experience into a belief in &quot;moral law&quot;. He felt that &quot;recognition of moral law is as much a necessary requirement of social achievement as physical law is of material advancement.&quot; In Flanders&#x27;s view, moral law required honesty, compassion, responsibility, cooperation, humility, and wisdom—values that all cultures hold in common. For him it was an absolute standard. He spoke of a &quot;Presence&quot; or &quot;daimon&quot; that &quot;renewed his courage&quot; and &quot;indicated direction&quot; in everything he did.

Flanders referred to the Marshall Plan as an important application of moral law to public policy. He said that the plan&#x27;s true purpose was to fend off Communism through the economic restoration of Europe—not to provide relief to Europe (something beyond the powers of the U.S.), nor to enhance gratitude towards the U.S., its prestige or power.

====On labor and business====
In testifying on the Employment Act (of 1946) before the Banking and Currency Committee of the Senate in 1945, Flanders defined the &quot;right to a job,&quot; as implying a responsibility shared among individuals, organized labor, businesses, and governments, as follows:
*Each individual should be &quot;productive, self-reliant and energetically in search of employment, when out of a job.&quot;
*Organized Labor should avoid wage demands that upset costs of production in a manner that decreases the total volume of employment.
*Business should operate efficiently to allow for expansion of production and employment.
*State and local governments can help preserve human rights and property rights that foster investment, while the Federal Government should &quot;encourage business to expand and investors to undertake new ventures.&quot;

Flanders felt that, to quell inflation, wage increases should be tied to productivity increases, rather than the cost of living. He recommended splitting gains in productivity three ways: to the worker for higher wages, to the company for higher profits and to the consumer for lower prices. He felt that with this approach everyone would benefit at the company level and in the national economy. Such an approach would require mutual respect and understanding between labor and management.

Flanders&#x27;s relations with organized labor were amicable. He welcomed the United Electrical Workers Union into Jones &amp; Lamson Machine Company. J&amp;L became the first company in Springfield, Vermont to be unionized.

====On Franklin D. Roosevelt====
Flanders met with President Roosevelt on several occasions. He felt that Roosevelt and his advisors did not heed Secretary of the Navy, Frank Knox&#x27;s warning that it was &quot;easily possible that hostilities would be initiated by a surprise attack upon the fleet or the Naval Base at Pearl Harbor.&quot; He further faulted the president for failing to recognize the growing threat of Communism in China. In Flanders&#x27;s opinion, he sold out on Mongolia, Nationalist China and Central Europe to Communist powers at the 1943 Tehran Conference. Flanders recognized the president&#x27;s political genius and leadership skills, but deplored his advocacy of raising taxes. He characterized the Roosevelt philosophy as one where re-employment &quot;must come from Government—not private—action.&quot; Flanders felt that large social programs were an ineffective approach to solve national problems.

====On social policy====
In his autobiography, Flanders reported exploring opportunities for government funding of public housing and higher education.
He voted in favor of the Civil Rights Act of 1957.
===Cold War policies===
National policy relating to the Cold War interested Flanders greatly. He was concerned about the worldwide encroachment of Communism even without force of arms. He felt that President Truman was generally a good president, but was hampered by the Roosevelt legacy of appeasing the Soviets. He also felt that Truman&#x27;s commitment to bringing the Nationalist and Communist Chinese factions together into an alliance was mistaken. He endorsed the Marshall Plan as a way to avoid Communist influence in Western Europe. However, he was critical of John Foster Dulles, Secretary of State, for mishandling opportunities to create friendly alignment with Egypt and India, countries which instead sided with the Soviet Union.

Flanders felt that spending 62% of federal income on defense was irrational, when the Soviet government claimed it wished to avoid nuclear conflict. He advocated that the development of &quot;A[tomic]- and H[ydrogen]-bombs be paralleled with equally intense negotiations towards disarmament.&quot; For him, &quot;gaining the co-operation of the Soviet government on an effective armament control,&quot; was most important.

===The censure of Joseph McCarthy===
Flanders was an early and strong critic of fellow Republican Senator Joseph McCarthy&#x27;s &quot;misdirection of our efforts at fighting communism&quot; and his role in &quot;the loss of respect for us in the world at large&quot;. He felt that rather than looking inward for communists within U.S. borders, the nation should look outward at the &quot;alarming world-wide advance of Communist power&quot; that would leave the United States and Canada as &quot;the last remnants of the free world&quot;. On March 9, 1954 he addressed Senator McCarthy on the Senate floor, expressing these concerns. (McCarthy had been advised of the speech, but was absent at the time.) Apart from a brief note of encouragement after this speech, Flanders was grateful that President Eisenhower stayed out of the McCarthy controversy. Members of President Eisenhower&#x27;s cabinet passed along the message that Flanders should &quot;lay off.&quot;

The &quot;Barre Montpelier Times Argus&quot; reported:


Other reactions were not so favorable. People who wrote the &quot;Rutland Herald&quot; &quot;hinted at retribution for McCarthy&#x27;s foes&quot; and called McCarthy &quot;a demigod above the law of the U.S.A. ... If you disagree, you are RED.&quot; William Loeb, owner of the &quot;Burlington Daily News&quot;, wrote, &quot;It would take somebody as stupid as Senator Flanders to finally swallow the Democratic bait on the subject of Senator McCarthy.&quot;
In a speech that Flanders did not mention in his autobiography, the &quot;Times Argus&quot; article reported that on June 1, 1954 Flanders

 ... addressed the Senate on &#x27;the colossal innocence of the junior Senator from Wisconsin.&#x27; Comparing McCarthy to &#x27;Dennis the Menace&#x27; of cartoon fame, the Vermonter delivered a scathing address in which he lambasted the Wisconsin man for dividing the nation. &#x27;In every country in which communism has taken over,&#x27; he reminded the Senate, &#x27;the beginning has been a successful campaign of division and confusion.&#x27; He marveled at the way the Soviet Union was winning military successes in Asia without risking its own resources or men, and said this nation was witnessing &#x27;another example of economy of effort ... in the conquest of this country for communism.&#x27; He added, &#x27;One of the characteristic elements of communist and fascist tyranny is at hand as citizens are set to spy upon each other.&#x27; &#x27;Were the junior Senator from Wisconsin in the pay of the communists, he could not have done a better job for them.&#x27; &#x27;This is a colossal innocence, indeed.&#x27; 

On June 11, 1954, Flanders introduced a resolution charging McCarthy &quot;with unbecoming conduct and calling for his removal from his committee membership.&quot; Upon the advice of Senators Cooper and Fulbright and legal assistance from the Committee for a More Effective Congress he modified his resolution to &quot;bring it in line with previous actions of censure.&quot; The text of the resolution of censure condemns the senator for &quot;obstructing the constitutional processes of the Senate&quot; when he &quot;failed to cooperate with the Subcommittee on Privileges and Elections of the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration and acting &quot;contrary to senatorial ethics&quot; when he described the Select Committee to Study Censure Charges and its chairman in slanderous terms. &quot;Time&quot; reported that a &quot;group of 23 top businessmen, labor leaders and educators ... wired every U.S. Senator (except McCarthy himself) urging a favorable vote &#x27;to curb the flagrant abuse of power by Senator McCarthy.&#x27;&quot; The Senate censured McCarthy on December 2, 1954 by a vote of 65 to 22. The Senate Republicans were split 22 to 22. For a further treatment of this episode, refer to Joseph McCarthy – Censure and the Watkins Committee.

A 1990 article in the &quot;Rutland Herald&quot; characterized the reaction in Vermont to Flanders&#x27;s role in the McCarthy censure as &quot;sour&quot;. It concludes that Flanders&#x27;s convictions did not necessarily reflect the priorities of his constituency, which regarded the issue as &quot;not our problem&quot;.

== Personal life ==
In 1911, Flanders married Helen Edith Hartness, the daughter of inventor and industrialist James Hartness. They made their home in Springfield, Vermont, when Flanders became president of Jones &amp; Lamson. Flanders and his wife had three children: Elizabeth (born 1912), Anna (also known as Nancy—born 1918), and James (born 1923).

==Legacy==
Flanders was the author or coauthor of eight books, including his autobiography, &quot;Senator from Vermont&quot;. He wrote about many issues: the problems of unemployment, inflation, ways for achieving a cooperative relationship between management and labor, and his belief that &quot;moral law is natural law&quot; and should be an integral part of everyone&#x27;s education. His papers are located at the Special Collections Research Center at Syracuse University Library and at the Special Collections of the University of Vermont&#x27;s Bailey-Howe Library.

During his lifetime, Flanders received more than sixteen honorary degrees from institutions that included Stevens Institute of Technology (M.E.), Dartmouth College (M.S., LL.D.), Harvard University (LL.D.), Middlebury College (D. Sc.) and the University of Vermont (D. Eng.).

His wife, Helen Hartness Flanders, was a folk song collector and author of several books on New England ballads.

Flanders died in Springfield on February 19, 1970. He was buried at Summer Hill Cemetery in Springfield alongside his wife and members of the Hartness family.

=== Vermont politics ===
Flanders&#x27;s Senate legacy has continued to inspire Vermont politicians. In his May 24, 2001 speech announcing his departure from the Republican Party, Vermont Senator Jim Jeffords cited Flanders three times and spoke of him as one of five Vermont politicians who, &quot;spoke their minds, often to the dismay of their party leaders, and did their best to guide the party in the direction of those fundamental principles they believed in.&quot; In speeches to Georgetown University Law Center and Johnson State College, Senator Patrick Leahy cited Flanders as one of three Vermont politicians who showed, &quot;the importance of standing firm in your beliefs,&quot; &quot;that conflict need not be hostile or adversarial&quot; and who &quot;rose up against abuses, against infringements upon Americans&#x27; rights when doing that was not popular.&quot; In 2016 Vermont Congressman, Peter Welch, cited Flanders as someone to emulate when resisting those policies of the Donald Trump Administration with which he disagreed, saying of Flanders, &quot;He stood up and said no, this has got to end.&quot;

<doc id="1026665" wikidata="Q544386" url="?curid=1026665" title="Mo Li Hua">
<text>&quot;Mo Li Hua&quot; (, also called Sinfa) is a Chinese folk song of the &quot;xiǎodiào&quot; (&quot;short tune&quot;) genre, from the Jiangnan region (south of the lower Yangtze river, around Suzhou, Shanghai and Hangzhou). The song is usually dated to the 18th century reign of the Qianlong Emperor (Qing dynasty), though some argue it is Ming era (pre-1644). Over time, many regional variations gained popularity in China and abroad.

The song was popular in China in the 18th century, and was first published in Europe in 1804. At the beginning of the 20th century, it was frequently played across China by travelling musicians. It was also adapted as temporary national anthem by Qing officials in Europe, and became popular there. Giacomo Puccini&#x27;s 1920s opera &quot;Turandot&quot; uses it as the leitmotif for the titular fairy-tale Chinese princess. 

The tune has been adapted and referenced in &quot;various traditional Chinese and international music concert circuits, concerts by pop bands and solo singers, scholarly debates, new choral arrangements, and state-sponsored events as an emblem of national pride&quot; and has been called a &quot;significant national musical and cultural icon&quot; of China, akin to Korea&#x27;s &quot;Arirang&quot; and Japan&#x27;s &quot;Sakura Sakura&quot;. The song was widely used by the Chinese government in turn-of-the-century official events, but became censored after the 2011 Chinese pro-democracy protests, also called the Jasmine (&quot;Mo li hua&quot;) Revolution, which used the song as a deniable and hard-to-block way of expressing support for democracy.

==History==
The song has been generally cited to originate during the Qianlong era (1735–1796) of the Qing dynasty, though ethnomusicologist Frederick Lau has noted that &quot;we now know that the earliest &quot;Molihua&quot; lyrics appeared during the Ming dynasty Wanli period (1563–1620).&quot; There are several regional versions of the song, with different lyrics and melody. One version of the song describes a custom of giving jasmine flowers, popular in the southern Yangtze delta region of China. Another, longer version describes the fear of plucking the flower. Through these variations, the song has also been called &quot;Xian Hua Diao&quot; (&quot;Fresh Flower Melody&quot;) and in northern China, the song is sometimes called &quot;La Mei Hua&quot; (&quot;Waxed Plum Blossom&quot;) or &quot;Yu Mei Hua&quot; (&quot;Jade Plum Blossom&quot;). The song descends from the &quot;xiǎoqǔ/xiǎodiào&quot; genre, which have the characteristics of being &quot;usually multistanza in form and with uniform phrase structures and equal numbers of words.&quot; It has been played on ancient metal bells (bianzhong) and modern jade chimes. It uses the five note (pentatonic) scale ubiquitous in Chinese music. The tune is one of &quot;xiaodiao&quot; (&quot;short tunes&quot;), popular in Chinese urban areas. 

British diplomat John Barrow, assistant attaché to George Macartney during the Macartney diplomatic mission to the imperial court of Qianlong, was the first to copy the tune into western notation, in 1793. When he published it in Europe in 1804, he noted that the tune seemed to be one of the most popular songs in China. His publication gave the song a &quot;grand entrance on the world stage&quot; and &quot;widespread international popularity&quot;, according to ethnomusicology scholar Frederick Lau.

The song was one of the first Chinese folk songs to become widely known outside China. Beginning in 1896, the song was sometimes used as a temporary national anthem by the Qing Chinese officials in Europe before the adoption of &quot;Cup of Solid Gold&quot; as the official national anthem of the Qing state in 1911. The song was also analyzed in the unfinished three volume work of the 19th century Austrian-Czech music historian August Wilhelm Ambros, &quot;History of Music,&quot; who remarks on the musical leaps within the melody. As such, the melody had already become well known among Western listeners when it was used by Giacomo Puccini in his opera &quot;Turandot&quot; (1926), boy choir air &quot;Là, sui monti dell&#x27;est&quot;, where it is associated with &#x27;Turandot&#x27;s splendor&#x27;.

In 1982 the song found a place on a UNESCO list of recommended songs. When China regained sovereignty of Macau and Hong Kong, in 1999 and 1997, respectively, this music was played in the ceremonies. The song was said to be a favorite of the former CCP general secretary, Jiang Zemin (it was at his request that the song was played during the transfer ceremony in Hong Kong). The tune was played during Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) meetings, and was widely used as hold music by provincial government offices.

During the 2011 Chinese pro-democracy protests, many protesters reposted videos of Chinese Communist Party (CCP) officials singing &quot;Mo Li Hua&quot;, and suggested playing it on cell phones as a form of antigovernment protest. The song was placed on authorities&#x27; list of online censored materials. Videos of the song, including at least one from an official event (a 2006 Kenyan students&#x27; welcome for CCP general secretary Hu Jintao, in which he sings the song and explains its importance), were removed from Chinese websites, and searches for the song&#x27;s name were blocked. The censorship attracted widespread media attention and was difficult because of the popularity of the song and its association with Chinese culture and history. Physical jasmine flowers were also restricted. At least one new version of the song has been developed by the activists as a response, with lyrics translating in part as &quot;You can’t find jasmine flowers in China/If you have one in your hand, Public Security will arrest you&quot;.

==In popular culture==
===In Classical Western music===
The 19th century Russian composer Anton Arensky arranged the tune in the 1890s in one of his character pieces, Étude sur un thème chinois, Op. 25, No. 3.

==== Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Turandot&quot; leitmotif ====


Puccini began working on his (ultimately incomplete and final opera piece) &quot;Turandot&quot; in March 1920 after meeting with librettists Giuseppe Adami and Renato Simoni. In his impatience, he began composition in January 1921, before Adami and Simoni had produced the text for the libretto. As with &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot;, Puccini strove for a semblance of authenticity by using music from the region, even commissioning a set of thirteen custom-made gongs.

Music historians have subsequently traced Puccini&#x27;s fascination with Chinese music that led to the usage of the folk song as &quot;thanks to a music box, coming from a former Italian diplomat who had served in China, which he received as a gift,&quot; who was likely the Baron Edoardo Fassini-Camoss. Three of the four melodies within this music box was incorporated by Puccini into his opera, the most memorable of which was the folk melody &quot;Mo Li Hua.&quot; W. Anthony Sheppard, Marylin and Arthur Levitt Professor of Music at Williams College has traced this music box to have been likely the source of the &quot;Turandot&quot; leitmotif. Sheppard notes that the accompanying music sheets for this music box version which Puccini would have referenced also had mistakenly titled the name of the song as &quot;Sinfa&quot; (fresh flowers). Mo Li Hua serves as a leitmotif for Princess Turandot&#x27;s splendor. In total, eight of the themes from &quot;Turandot&quot; appear to be based on traditional Chinese music and anthems.

&quot;Turandot&quot; is set in Imperial China; the tune servs as the leitmotif for the titular fairy-tale Chinese princess.

Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Turandot&quot; rendition of &quot;Mo Li Hua&quot; has gained its own compositional popularity. The Chinese-American composer Tan Dun&#x27;s &quot;Symphony 1997&quot;, which commemorated the handover of Hong Kong, uses a setting inspired by Puccini&#x27;s. His 1990 &quot;Nine Songs: Water Spirit&quot; performance, where &quot;Mo Li Hua&quot; was referenced, has also been argued by composer Christian Utz to be an evolution upon Puccini&#x27;s quotated version rather than having drawn from the original folk tune itself.

===Notable performances===
The song is said to have been a favourite of former paramount leader Jiang Zemin (CCP general secretary, 1989-2002), and was used in the 1997 Hong Kong handover ceremony at his request.

At the closing ceremonies of the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, was sung, partially unaccompanied by a young Chinese girl, and partially accompanied by the music by a Peking University students (whose version has been described as infused with a techno beat), to introduce the next Olympic Games site. An adaptation of the melody by Tan Dun and Wang Hesheng, chosen from more than 4,000 pieces, was played during the medal ceremonies at the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games as the introductory motif of the victory theme.

It was also performed at the 2010 Shanghai Expo opening ceremony by an orchestra with the pianist Lang Lang.
It was played at the ceremony awarding the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize to Liu Xiaobo.

===In movies and television shows===
 appeared in a 1937 Hollywood movie &quot;The Good Earth&quot; (based on a novel by Pearl S. Buck). During World War II, some Hollywood films used the &quot;Mo Li Hua&quot; tune to represent the Chinese.

The tune, without lyrics, was also used as a musical theme in &quot;&quot;, a 2005–2008 television series.

===Notable recordings===
The song has been adapted by many artists around the world, for example by Kenny G. The YouTube comments for his performance later became an outlet for Chinese protesters to express support for democracy.

In 2009, Russian singer Vitas, during the Chinese premiere of his program &quot;Sleepless Night&quot;, at least has also performed &quot;Mo Li Hua&quot; (never included in digital download until then).

In 2013, the international Canadian-origin superstar Celine Dion performed the song in Mandarin on the Chinese CCTV-1 as part of its CMG New Year&#x27;s Gala show welcoming in the 2013 Spring Festival/Chinese New Year. She sang in a duet with Chinese soprano and 2006 Grammy Award nominee classical/folk singer Song Zuying.

Since 2018, Kazakh singer Dimash Qudaibergen has performed this song in Mandarin on four occasions, three years in a row, during New Year and Chinese New Year celebration galas on various TV stations including a duet with the first Chinese Vocaloid dubbed &quot;Luo Tianyi&quot; as vocalist on 23rd January 2020.

In 2018, the song was heard in the beginning of music video of Glukoza and Leningrad&#x27;s song &quot;Zhu-Zhu&quot; (&quot;Жу-жу&quot;). The song was also in beginning of music video of 2021 song by Glukoza named &quot;Moths&quot; (&quot;Мотыльки&quot;).

====In games====
In the 2016 turn-based strategy 4X video game developed by Firaxis Games, &quot;Civilization VI&quot;, &quot;Mo Li Hua&quot; is the civilization theme for China, progressing from the original melody during the ancient period to a orchestral evolution of the song in the modern period.

<text>Fort Larned National Historic Site preserves Fort Larned which operated from 1859 to 1878. It is approximately west of Larned, Kansas, United States.

==History==
The Camp on Pawnee Fork was established on October 22, 1859, to protect traffic along the Santa Fe Trail from hostile Native Americans. It was renamed Camp Alert in 1860, as the small garrison of about 50 men had to remain constantly alert for Indians. In May 1860 it was moved upstream, 30 miles to the west up the Pawnee Fork, and by the end of the month was renamed Fort Larned. It served the same purpose as Camp Alert and as an agency for the administration of the Central Plains Indians by the Bureau of Indian Affairs under the terms of the Fort Wise Treaty of 1861. The fort&#x27;s service ended as a combination of the tribes&#x27; relocation to reservations and the completion of railroads across Kansas that ended the need for the Santa Fe Trail.

Larned, Kansas and the fort that was constructed there are named in honor of Colonel Benjamin F. Larned, the paymaster general of the United States Army at the time the post was established. Larned experienced a lengthy military career, first serving as an ensign in the 21st Infantry during the War of 1812. He was promoted to captain after the defense of Fort Erie, and by 1854 Larned was a colonel and had been appointed paymaster general. Despite the town and fort bearing his name, Colonel Larned never came to Kansas.

As the American government claimed vast amounts of land west of the Mississippi River, trade and commerce with the territories grew exponentially. According to one source in 1859, trade had risen $10,000,000 annually. In the &quot;Missouri Republican&quot;, it was reported that 2,300 men, 1970 wagons, 840 horses, 4,000 mules, 15,000 oxen, 73 carriages, and over 1,900 tons of freight left Missouri for New Mexico. It became apparent an additional fortification was required to protect the trade routes. Fort Larned&#x27;s location was chosen by William Bent, an agent for the Upper Arkansas Indians. Bent stated, &quot;I consider it essential to have two permanent stations for troops, one at the mouth of Pawnee Fork, and one at Big Timbers, both upon the Arkansas River...To control them (the Indians), it is essential to have among them the perpetual presence of a controlling military force.&quot;

The fort&#x27;s original structures were poorly constructed and inadequate. Built of adobe bricks, Fort Larned consisted of an officer&#x27;s quarters, two combination storehouses and barracks, a guardhouse, two laundresses&#x27; quarters, and a hospital, with a bakery and meat house being later additions. After its establishment, nearby Plains Indians began to respect the trail commerce. In August, 1861, Colonel Leavenworth, reporting from Fort Larned, stated the Indians had left the Santa Fe trail area and there was no apprehension of any hostilities.

When the Civil War erupted in 1861, Fort Larned witnessed its first action and hostility from the Indians. Soldiers in the regular army were removed from the post to join the growing conflict in the East, leaving the fort to be operated by volunteer troops from Kansas, Colorado, and Wisconsin. Raids and harassment of travelers by Plains Indians increased during the Civil War years. On July 17, 1864, Kiowa Indians raided Fort Larned and stole 172 horses and mules from the corral. The raiders were pursued but never caught. In 1865 a system of escorting wagon trains was established, and all merchants were forbidden travel westward beyond Fort Larned without an armed escort.

Though the fort was never directly involved in any Civil War engagements, one incident nearly brought the fighting to Larned. In May 1862, Confederate General Albert Pike arranged an alliance with some Kiowa and Seminole Indians with intentions of capturing Forts Larned and Wise. The plan was never carried out, as the Indians left for their annual hunt when the weather improved.

Fort Larned was the site of a meeting between General Winfield Scott Hancock and several Cheyenne chiefs on April 12, 1867, in which Hancock intended to impress the Dog Soldier chiefs with his military power. After the meeting, Hancock, along with George Armstrong Custer and the 7th U.S. Cavalry traveled west of Fort Larned to a combined Cheyenne and Lakota camp, inciting the villagers to flee. Hancock ordered the village burned, beginning a summer of warfare known as Hancock&#x27;s War. Fort Larned assisted in bringing Hancock&#x27;s War to an end by supplying the Medicine Lodge Treaty. During the winter of 1868–69, U.S. Major General Philip H. Sheridan launched a campaign against the Cheyenne, Kiowa, and Comanche Indians in the Great Plains region. Sheridan&#x27;s men attacked any who resisted, taking their supplies and livestock and pushing the remaining Indians back into their reservations. By the end of the Winter Campaign, Sheridan had forced a majority of the Indians in the Fort Larned area on to reservations.

Renovations to Fort Larned took place between 1866 and 1868. The original sod and adobe structures were removed and replaced with the sandstone buildings that make up the fort today. By 1871, no escorts were required for the wagon trains traveling on the Santa Fe Trail, eliminating the need for military presence in the region. The post was abandoned on July 13, 1878, and on March 26, 1883, the Fort Larned Military Reservation was transferred from the War Department to the General Land Office of the Department of the Interior.

From 1885 to 1966, the buildings housed the headquarters of a ranch, with the owners living in the house of the commanding officer and the employees residing in what had been the officers&#x27; quarters. In 1957 the Fort Larned Historical Society was founded to develop and open the site as a tourist attraction. The fort was designated as a National Landmark in 1961, and in 1964 it was incorporated as a unit of the National Park System.

==Historic Site==

Barracks – Barracks housed the infantry and cavalry on the north side of the Fort. The barracks housed up to four companies. On average, just 100 or 150 troops were stationed here. By 1868, a peak of 400 and 500.

Shops – Repairs were handled by skilled, civilian tradesmen. Blacksmiths and carpenters were hired at high wages. In 1867, a blacksmiths made $85 a month, saddlers and wheelwrights $90. Soldiers who had skills could take on extra duty working in the shops building as laborers, blacksmiths, and mechanics. The bakery was at the north end of the shops and baked bread. The bread was allowed to &quot;dry&quot; on racks for at least two days before being served.

Warehouses – An important role for a frontier fort was as a place to store the supplies that kept the Army functioning, including food, ammunition, and clothing. The first sandstone buildings completed after the blockhouse. The first two, the Old Commissary and the Quartermaster Storehouse, brandish loopholes from which the fort could be defended with rifle fire in the event of an attack.

Officers&#x27; Row – The company officers&#x27; quarters were designed to house four companies&#x27; of officers. A typical company&#x27;s officers included two lieutenants and one captain. The officer&#x27; were divided into two halls, each with four rooms; a lieutenant was housed in one room while captains could claim two. In the rear of each half of the building was a kitchen and servant&#x27;s quarters.

Blockhouse – The first sandstone structure to be completed was the blockhouse. It provided for defense. Built with two floor, each with loopholes to defend from attackers. It included an underground well. As the threat of attack diminished, the blockhouse was converted into the post&#x27;s prison. The well tunnel was partially filled and used for solitary confinement. The rifle loopholes were also filled. The blockhouse is the only sandstone building that has been completely rebuilt, though it has been located on its original foundation.
With nine historic buildings, the fort survives as one of the best-preserved examples of Indian Wars-period forts. Most of the buildings, including the barracks, commissary, and officers quarters, are furnished to their original appearance. Fort Larned National Historic Site is open daily, year-round, and admission is free. The park offers several special events throughout the year, living history demonstrations, and ranger-guided tours.

The 10th US Cavalry, stationed at Fort Larned from 1867 to 1869, was one of the first two all-black cavalry units utilized in the country, along with the 9th US Cavalry. On January 2, 1869, the 10th Cavalry&#x27;s stables at Fort Larned burned to the ground. The fire killed dozens of horses, destroyed equipment, and caused the unit to be reassigned to Fort Zarah. In 1999, magnetic gradiometry and electromagnetic conductivity surveys were conducted at the fort to attempt to determine the location of the stables, which had been lost. The surveys identified several areas of anomalies consistent with locations of buildings, as well as evidence of disturbances to the land that occurred after the buildings were no longer used as a fort.

<text>Sir John Logan Campbell (3 November 1817 – 22 June 1912) was a Scottish-born New Zealand public figure. He was described by his contemporaries as &quot;the father of Auckland&quot;.

== Early life==

John Logan Campbell was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, on 3 November 1817, a son of the Edinburgh surgeon John Campbell and his wife Catherine and grandson of the 3rd baronet of Aberuchill and Kilbryde and Kilbryde castle near Dunblane, Perthshire. He had four sisters but his two elder brothers had died by the time he reached the age of two, and he became the only surviving son. Campbell graduated in medicine from the University of Edinburgh in 1839 and later that year sailed for Australia, New South Wales, as a surgeon on the emigrant ship &quot;Palmyra&quot;.

==Migration to New Zealand==
Confronted with drought and constrained prospects at the time Campbell departed Australia for New Zealand in March 1840 on the &quot;Lady Liford&quot;, arriving at Port Nicolson, and eventually travelling to Waiou (now called Whanganui Island) on the Coromandel. Campbell and William Brown (a Scottish lawyer) who had previously met in Adelaide, Australia, formed a business partnership after purchasing Motukorea from Te Kanini of Ngāti Tamaterā and the sub-chiefs Katikati and Ngatai with the aim of becoming merchant traders, in the rumoured new capital of New Zealand, Tāmaki Makaurau, soon to be named Auckland by Captain William Hobson following a gift of land and negotiations with Ngāti Whātua.

They decided to abandon &#x27;quill-driving and pill-making&#x27; and become traders in the new capital, Auckland. On 21 December 1840 they began operations as Auckland&#x27;s first merchant firm, Brown and Campbell, when Campbell pitched his tent on the edge of the small bay, at the foot of present day Queen Street. Campbell and Brown built Acacia Cottage in 1841, on their street frontage the partners put up a two-storeyed warehouse from which they conducted their business as general merchants in the infant city of Auckland. Campbell quickly became prominent in Auckland, both in business circles and in public life. He was a director of the Bank of New Zealand, the New Zealand Loan and Mercantile Agency Company, and the New Zealand Insurance Company.

==Auckland Province==
Campbell was elected to the Auckland Provincial Council on 20 March 1855, and he served until 15 September of that year. He was then Superintendent of Auckland Province from 25 November 1855 to 17 September 1856.

==Member of Parliament==

Campbell entered the 2nd New Zealand Parliament, representing the electorates of the City of Auckland 1855–1856 (resigned). He was elected unopposed on 4 August 1860 in the Suburbs of Auckland electorate, replacing Joseph Hargreaves. Campbell retired at the end of the 2nd Parliament in late 1860. He was a minister without portfolio in the government of Edward Stafford between June and November 1856.

==Middle years==
Campbell was a successful businessman and had entered into a partnership with William Brown in 1840, beginning operations as Auckland&#x27;s first merchant firm, Brown and Campbell. In May 1854, the &quot;Signet&quot; ship was purchased on behalf of Campbell in Geelong, Australia for the timber trade. By 1856 Campbell and Brown decided that their enterprises and properties, now worth £110,000, could be entrusted to a salaried manager, while they lived on the dividends as expatriates.

Brown and his family left early in the year, but Campbell&#x27;s departure was delayed. On 20 November 1856 he left the colony, he hoped for good.

While travelling abroad, he married Emma Wilson on 25 February 1858 at Meerut, NWP India. She was a daughter of Sir John Cracroft Wilson, who later settled in Canterbury. They had four children: Cecily born in Auckland on 16 May 1861 died 20 November 1861 aged 6 months, Ida, born at Naples on 22 December 1859 and died in London 1880; and twins John Logan and Winifred born at Florence on 26 May 1864. John Logan died in infancy in Florence, Italy and is buried at in the English Cemetery at the Piazzale Donatello – Delgli Inglesi. &#x27;And there lies buried in that little grave,&#x27; Campbell told his two daughters, &#x27;the poor Papa&#x27;s hopes that to him had been born a son who would be his pride and pleasure in his declining years and to whose care the name of his Firm would have been handed down to another generation. . . . And thus it is that our fondest hopes and dearest aspirations are ever and again doomed to a bitter disappointment&#x27;. With this bereavement, Campbell said, &#x27;we felt ourselves completely unhinged&#x27;, &#x27;the brightness of that Florence home was gone&#x27;.

Apart from an interlude during 1860 and 1861, when he was obliged to go to Auckland to reinvigorate the firm – now called Brown Campbell and Company – and to install a resident partner, the Campbells lived in various parts of Europe until 1871. On his return early in 1871, Campbell took over full control. Two years later he bought out Brown&#x27;s partnership share for over £40,000. Becoming a part of the business community again, he became involved with the Bank of New Zealand, the New Zealand Loan and Mercantile Agency Company, the New Zealand Insurance Company, and related companies. Campbell had a marked philanthropic interest in the advancement of education. He donated a sum of £500 and a block of land on the corner of Pitt and Wellington Streets and a brick school building was built there to house St Peter&#x27;s School (a predecessor of St Peter&#x27;s College, Auckland). He founded Auckland&#x27;s first school of art in 1878 and supported it for 11 years. He was a founder of Auckland Grammar School having become the third chairman of the school in 1879..

When depression overwhelmed Auckland in 1885 and the Stock Market collapsed in 1886, there began a desperate struggle for financial survival. Campbell sold several businesses and properties, concentrating his energies on Brown Campbell and Company, a brewery and liquor importer. Campbell retained his properties at One Tree Hill partly because he wanted to create a suitable residence for his family. He envisaged an Italianate mansion similar to James Williamson&#x27;s at Hillsborough, surrounded by an elegant estate. He set about planting trees to create a suitable landscape garden.

His wife Emma, however, had other ideas and the house, Killbryde, was eventually built in Parnell, a location much more handy to town. This property is now part of the Parnell Rose Gardens and Dove Myer Robinson Park. The house was demolished in 1924. In his later years, Campbell was concerned about the increasing suburban development of Auckland and decided to donate his remaining farmland at One Tree Hill to the city as a public amenity to be called Corinth Park – named after a part of Greece which Campbell had admired on his travels.

Winifred the only surviving child of John and Emma Campbell married Herbert Cyril Orde Murray a lieutenant in the 1st Gloucestershire Regiment on 10 December 1889.

The presentation of the park would probably have taken place after Campbell&#x27;s death in the form of a bequest had not providence intervened in the form of the Royal Tour of 1901.

==Cornwall Park==
In early 1901, Campbell was approached to be Mayor of Auckland for the royal visit by the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall in June that year. Aged 83 and long been in retirement, Campbell agreed on the proviso that he would fulfil representative functions only and step down after the visit, with a deputy undertaken most of the mayoral tasks. In the April 1901 mayoral election, he received nearly 80% of the votes. During the royal visit, Logan Campbell donated Cornwall Park to the people of New Zealand and named it after the Duke and Duchess. Campbell resigned in July and the city councillors voted Alfred Kidd into the role; Kidd had acted in support of Campbell and taken on many of the mayoral tasks.

==Later life, death, and legacy==
Campbell was made a knight bachelor on 14 August 1902, after the honour had been announced in the 1902 Coronation Honours list published on 26 June 1902. He lived long enough to witness the erection of the bronze statue of him in Mayoral Robes at the Manukau Road entrance to Cornwall Park. He died on 22 June 1912, and is buried on the summit of Maungakiekie One Tree Hill, adjacent to Cornwall Park. Auckland Grammar students formed part of the procession at Campbell’s funeral on 4 July 1912. He advised his closest advisors of his wish to erect a monument to demonstrate his love and regard for the Māori people and allocated funds for it in his will and Trust Deeds for the formation of his Residuary Estate to continue to distribute funds for charities for relief of poverty, advancement of education and support of the cultural and medical interests he supported in his life time. The Trustees of his estate sought permission from Iwi throughout the Auckland Provincial region for his burial on the tihi summit and later for the building of the obelisk, which commenced in the 1930s to be complete by 1940 as a bicentennial project supported by the Government of the day. As it was completed during World War Two, the official dedication was delayed as the Maori elders did not wish to formally dedicate it during a time of bloodshed in line with tikanga. Sir John Logan Campbell&#x27;s grave is located in the middle of the flat platform which is part of a structure supporting the obelisk complex, built of local volcanic basalt, which serves as the forecourt to the monument. The epitaph for Sir John Logan Campbell is taken from Christopher Wren&#x27;s grave at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, London, the bronze plaque on the grave reads in Latin; &quot;&quot;Si monumentum requiris circumspice&quot;,&quot; – translating to &quot;If you would seek my monument, look around you.&quot;

In 1997, Campbell was posthumously inducted into the New Zealand Business Hall of Fame.

== Sir John Logan Campbell Papers ==
The Sir John Logan Campbell Papers constitutes a record across almost all of the nineteenth century. John Logan Campbell&#x27;s personal papers and those of his business enterprises reflect both business and social history from the 1840s to 1910. The collection is fundamental to research into the earliest origins of Auckland’s European settlement and the development of the provincial economy. The papers record a range of activities, events and business across the Auckland Province, also include &quot;Reminiscences&quot; of his time in Europe, India, the Near East, Scotland. There is also a section containing papers of his wife Lady Emma Campbell and daughter Winifred. Campbell’s gift of land and income attest to his efforts to secure and transform his farm estate into a public park gifted to the people of New Zealand in 1901. The collection includes the Cornwall Park Trust Board developments and management of this major city asset.

The Sir John Logan Campbell Papers MS-51 are held at the Auckland War Memorial Museum, and were added to the UNESCO Memory of the World Aotearoa New Zealand Ngā Mahara o te Ao register in 2016.

<text>The Sterling submachine gun is a British submachine gun (SMG). It was tested by the British Army in 1944–1945, but did not start to replace the Sten until 1953. A successful and reliable design, it remained standard issue in the British Army until 1994, when it began to be replaced by the L85A1, a bullpup assault rifle.

== History ==
In 1944, the British General Staff issued a specification for a new submachine gun to replace the Sten. It stated that the new weapon should weigh no more than six pounds (2.7 kg), should fire 9×19mm Parabellum ammunition, have a rate of fire of no more than 500 rounds per minute, and be sufficiently accurate to allow five consecutive shots (fired in semi-automatic mode) to be placed inside a one-foot-square (30 cm × 30 cm) target at a distance of .

To meet the new requirement, George William Patchett, the chief designer at the Sterling Armaments Company of Dagenham, submitted a sample weapon of new design in early 1944. The first Patchett prototype gun was similar to the Sten insofar as its cocking handle (and the slot it moved back and forth in) was placed in line with the ejection port though it was redesigned soon afterwards and moved up to a slightly offset position. The army quickly recognised the Patchett&#x27;s significantly increased accuracy and reliability compared to the Sten and ordered 120 examples for trials. Towards the end of the Second World War, some of these trial samples are rumoured to have been used in combat by airborne troops during the battle of Arnhem and by special forces at other locations in Northern Europe where it was officially known as the Patchett Machine Carbine Mk 1. For example, a Patchett submachine gun (serial numbered 078 and now held by the Imperial War Museum), was carried in action by Colonel Robert W.P. Dawson while he was Commanding Officer of No. 4 Commando, during the attack on Walcheren as part of Operation Infatuate in November 1944. Because the Patchett/Sterling can use straight Sten magazines as well as the curved Sterling design, there were no interoperability problems.

After the war, with large numbers of Sten guns in the inventory, there was little interest in replacing them with a superior design. However, in 1947, a competitive trial between the Patchett, an Enfield design, a new BSA design and an experimental Australian design was held, with the Sten for comparison. The trial was inconclusive but was followed by further development and more trials. Eventually, the Patchett design won and the decision was made in 1951 for the British Army to adopt it. It started to replace the Sten in 1953 as the &quot;Sub-Machine Gun L2A1&quot;. Its last non-suppressed variation was the L2A3 but the model changes were minimal throughout its development life.

Sterling submachine guns with minor cosmetic alterations were used in the production of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; films as props for the E-11 blaster rifle used by Imperial Stormtroopers. More drastically altered Sterlings were used as DH-17 blaster pistols in the hands of Rebel Alliance soldiers, though this weapon was mostly depicted via resin replicas that were cast from a &quot;hero&quot; prop and only a few live-firing Sterlings were modified compared to those used as E-11s. The E-11 itself would later come to be depicted by non-firing Sterling replicas, namely Model Gun Corporation replicas, which were used in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; and S&amp;T Sterling L2A1 airsoft guns which have been used from &quot;Rogue One&quot; onwards.

==Design details==
The Sterling submachine gun is constructed entirely of steel and plastic and has a shoulder stock that folds underneath the weapon. There is an adjustable rear sight, which can be flipped between 100 and 200 yard settings. Although of conventional blowback design firing from an open bolt, there are some unusual features: for example, the bolt has helical grooves cut into the surface to remove dirt and fouling from the inside of the receiver to increase reliability. There are two concentric recoil springs which cycle the bolt, as opposed to the single spring arrangement used by many other SMG designs. This double-spring arrangement is intended to give improved reliability when firing 9mm ammunition types other than the British &#x27;2Z&#x27; standard, which typically have different propellant charges and bullet weights.

The Sterling&#x27;s double-stack, double-feed box magazine was designed in 1946 by George Patchett. While the original Patchett gun was intended to take Sten or Lanchester magazines, these magazines&#x27; poor reliability led Patchett to initially redesign the Sten magazine with a roller platform to reduce friction, and then to construct a new double-feed magazine that implemented the earlier roller platform, a stamped metal construction, and a curved magazine body, allowing the 9×19mm round to feed more reliably. The bolt feeds ammunition alternately from the top and bottom of the magazine lips, and its fixed firing pin is designed so that it does not line up with the primer in the cartridge until the cartridge has entered the chamber. In its final iteration, the magazine uses a four-piece construction with scalloped, spot-welded edges and positioning notches. While originally intended to hold forty rounds, concerns over the magazine&#x27;s ability to fit into the ammunition pouch of the then-new 1944 Pattern Web Equipment led the magazine to be shortened to its final capacity of thirty-four rounds; when introducing the Mk 7 Pistol variant in 1983, Sterling produced magazines with capacities of ten and fifteen rounds for that weapon, as well as introducing &quot;twin-stacked&quot; versions of these and the original thirty-four round magazine. The Sterling magazine is said to be one of the best ever designed. While Sterling provided magazines for British Armed Forces weapons, with these being designated as &quot;Magazine, 9mm, L1A1&quot;, cost issues led the Ministry of Defence to pursue the design and production of a non-Sterling L1A2 version which used a stamped and electrically seam-welded two-piece construction with a singular positioning lug and was 9.8&quot; long down the rear spine compared to the 9.6&quot; of Sterling-produced magazines. Production Sterlings retain the earlier Patchett gun&#x27;s compatibility with Sten and Lanchester magazines; while the Lanchester gun is theoretically capable of using Sterling magazines, the same cannot be said for the Sten gun since a Sterling magazine intrudes inch further into the bolt way than a Sten magazine and so attempting to fire a Sten gun with a Sterling magazine fitted would cause the breech block to foul the rear of the magazine, while attempting to counteract this by withdrawing the magazine by inch would merely result in the magazine&#x27;s top round being out of alignment with the breech block by inches. This issue is not present on Sterling guns fitted with Sten magazines; while the magazine will be inch further away from the breech block&#x27;s centre line, the top round remains in line with the breech and so can be reached by the Sterling&#x27;s more robust feed horns. The Sterling gun and its magazine were purportedly designed this way in order to prevent a situation where, instead of buying the actual Sterling gun, prospective users might only buy its magazines and then use these with their pre-existing Sten guns. 

The Sterling employs a degree of what is known as Advanced Primer Ignition, in that the cartridge is fired while the bolt is still moving forward, a fraction of a second before the round is fully chambered. The firing of the round thus not only sends the bullet flying down the barrel but simultaneously resists the forwards movement of the bolt. By this means it is possible to employ a lighter bolt than if the cartridge was fired after the bolt had already stopped, as in simple blowback, since the energy of the expanding gases would then only have to overcome the bolt&#x27;s static inertia (plus spring resistance) to push it backwards again and cycle the weapon; whereas in this arrangement some of this energy is used up in counteracting the bolt&#x27;s forwards momentum as well; and thus the bolt does not have to be so massive. The lighter bolt makes not only for a lighter gun, but a more controllable one since there is less mass moving to and fro within it as it fires.

The suppressed version of the Sterling (L34A1/Mk.5) was developed for covert operations. This version uses a ported barrel surrounded by a cylinder with expansion chambers. The Australian and New Zealand SAS regiments used the suppressed version of the Sterling during the Vietnam War. It was used by both Argentinian and British Special Forces during the Falklands War. A Sterling was used by Libyan agents to kill WPC Yvonne Fletcher outside the Libyan Embassy in London, which sparked the 1984 siege of the building.

The Sterling has a reputation for excellent reliability under adverse conditions and, even though it fires from an open bolt, good accuracy. With some practice, it is very accurate when fired in short bursts. While it has been reported that the weapon poses no problems for left-handed users to operate, it is not recommended without the wearing of ballistic eye protection. The path of the ejected cartridge cases is slightly down and backward, so mild burns can occasionally be incurred by left-handed shooters.

A bayonet of a similar design as that for the L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle was produced and issued in British Army service, but was rarely employed except for ceremonial duties. Both bayonets were derived from the version issued with the Rifle No. 5 Mk I &quot;jungle carbine&quot;, the main difference being a smaller ring on the SLR bayonet to fit the rifle&#x27;s muzzle. When mounted, the Sterling bayonet was offset to the left of the weapon&#x27;s vertical line, which gave a more natural balance when used for bayonet-fighting.

For a right-handed shooter, the correct position for the left hand while firing is on the ventilated barrel-casing, but not on the magazine, as the pressure from holding the magazine can increase the risk of stoppages, and a loose magazine can lead to dropping the weapon. The barrel-casing hold provides greater control of the weapon, so the right hand can intermittently be used for other tasks. A semi-circular protrusion on the right-hand side of the weapon, approximately two inches from the muzzle, serves to prevent the supporting hand from moving too far forward and over the muzzle.

==Manufacture==
Over 400,000 Sterlings were manufactured between 1953 and 1988. Sterling built them at their factory in Dagenham for the British armed forces and for overseas sales, while Liverpool&#x27;s Royal Ordnance Factory Fazakerley constructed them exclusively for the British military. Production ceased in 1988 with the closing of Sterling Armaments by British Aerospace/Royal Ordnance. Fazakerley no longer makes full weapons, but still manufactures spare parts for certified end users.

Sterling produced its own magazines, with those intended for British military use being marked &quot;L1A1&quot;. L1A2 magazines were variously manufactured by Fazakerley, Royal Laboratories Woolwich, Rolls Razor, and Mettoy; out of the 1,723,623 magazines contracted for, Mettoy was to produce 227,262, Rolls Razor was to produce 309,800, and the remaining 1.2 million were produced by Fazakerley and Woolwich.

A Chilean variant was made by FAMAE as the PAF submachine gun but was different externally as it had a shorter receiver lacking the barrel shroud.

Canada also manufactured a variant under licence, called the Submachine Gun 9 mm C1 made by Canadian Arsenals Limited. It is made from stamped metal instead of cast metal and is capable of handling a C1 bayonet, which is only used during public exhibition events and not for combat operations.

A similar weapon, the Sub-Machine Gun Carbine 9 mm 1A1, was manufactured under licence by the Indian Ordnance Factory at Kanpur beginning in 1963, along with a Sub-Machine Gun Carbine 9 mm 2A1, manufactured beginning in 1977. As of 2012, it has been reported that at least 5,000 of these SMGs were made in India.

A US export version had a longer barrel () to comply with Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) regulations. Beginning in 2009, Century Arms began marketing a similar semi-auto only carbine manufactured by Wiselite Arms. These too have a 16-inch barrel. They are assembled using a mix of newly made US parts, and parts from demilitarized Sterling Mark 4 parts kits. This is often marketed as the &quot;Sterling Sporter&quot;.
* Sterling Mark 7 &quot;Para-pistol&quot;: Special machine pistol variant issued to commando and plainclothes intelligence units. It had a barrel shortened to , fixed vertical foregrip, and weighed . If used with a short 10- or 15-round magazine, it could be stowed in a special holster. It also could be used as a Close Quarters Battle weapon with the addition of an optional solid stock.
* Canadian Army
** C1 Submachine Gun: Adopted in 1958, replacing the STEN gun in general service. It was different from the British L2 in that it made extensive use of stamped metal parts rather the more expensive castings used by British production SMGs. It also had a removable trigger guard for use with gloves in arctic operations as a standard option, and used a different 30-round magazine with a stamped metal follower. A 10-round magazine was also available for crews of armoured vehicles.
* Indian Army
** SAF Carbine 1A: Indian made Sterling L2A1.
** SAF Carbine 2A1: Sterling Mark V silenced carbine.

=== 7.62 NATO variant ===
A prototype rifle in the 7.62×51mm NATO calibre was manufactured, using some components from the SMG. The rifle used lever-delayed blowback to handle the more powerful rounds and was fed from 30-round Bren magazines. To prevent ammunition cookoff, the weapon fired from an open bolt. Only one model of the rifle was produced, possibly to test the concepts of a proposed new product. It was not put into production.

<doc id="1026676" wikidata="Q59870" url="?curid=1026676" title="Emerson Sheik">
<text>Márcio Passos de Albuquerque (born 6 September 1978), known as Emerson Sheik or just Emerson, is a former professional footballer who played as a forward. Born in Brazil, he represented Qatar internationally, leading to his nickname of &quot;Sheik&quot;. 

==Club career==
===Early career===
Emerson Sheik was born in Nova Iguaçu. As a promising teenager, he developed in São Paulo FC&#x27;s youth system. He made his senior side debut in 1998.

===Japan===
Emerson Sheik went to Japan to join Consadole Sapporo of the second division, for whom he scored 31 goals in 34 games during the 2000 season. After the season, he joined another second division team, Kawasaki Frontale, with whom he continued his goal-scoring domination, registering 19 goals in 18 league games. In the middle of the 2001 season, however, he left Frontale to join the first division Urawa Reds, for whom he has yet again excelled. He scored 71 league goals in 100 appearances for the Reds and won 2003 J1 League top scorer and 2004 J1 League MVP.

===Al-Sadd===
Emerson Sheik later joined Qatar outfit Al-Sadd with the transfer fee of 8 million US dollars in 2005.

===Move to France===
On 25 August 2007, Emerson Sheik signed a three-year contract with French side Stade Rennais FC.

===Return to Al-Sadd===
Emerson Sheik could not break into the first team at Rennes. Meanwhile, his previous team Al-Sadd were going through a lean phase. They had many bad results and were 14 points behind unbeaten leaders Al-Gharafa by the end of 2007. Their new import Mauro Zárate did not link up nicely with Emerson&#x27;s ex-striking partner, Carlos Tenorio up front. The fans of Al-Sadd started rooting for the return of Emerson. So Al-Sadd started negotiations with Emerson in December and on 19 December, the club&#x27;s official website announced Emerson&#x27;s return.

===Flamengo===
On 20 March 2009, the former São Paulo FC and Rennes forward signed a season-long deal with childhood favorite Flamengo; the 30-year-old was a free agent after leaving Al-Sadd. He generally kept a good scoring record for the club, which long sought a competent striker before his arrival. In the Série A 2009 season, his partnership with Adriano was one of the league&#x27;s most effective forward lines. Club legend Andrade praised both players&#x27; performance.

===Al Ain FC===
On 5 September 2009, he signed a two-year deal with Al Ain FC. He was presented to the press on 6 September 2009 and was handed the number 8 shirt.

===Fluminense===
On 16 June 2010, Emerson signed for Fluminense. On 5 December 2010, Emerson scored the winning goal for Fluminense to conquer the Brasileirão Série A title, making him a Brazilian champion for two years in a row.

===Sport Club Corinthians Paulista===

On 18 May 2011, Emerson Sheik signed for Corinthians. On 4 December 2011, he won his third Brazilian championship in a row with the Timão, making him the first player in history to win three straight Brazilian championships with three different teams.

On 4 July 2012, Emerson scored two goals in the second match of the 2012 Copa Libertadores Finals, helping Corinthians to win their first Copa Libertadores. On 16 December 2012, he was part of the Corinthians team which won the FIFA World Club Championship, beating Chelsea 1–0. In the last few minutes of the game, he was involved in an off-the-ball incident with Gary Cahill, in which Emerson fell to the ground holding his face. Cahill received a red card, but the Englishman claimed Emerson fouled him first before diving.

In an interview for &quot;Esporte Espetacular&quot;, an attraction of Rede Globo, Emerson showed his dislike for Mano Menezes, coach of the club. Emerson Sheik told reporters: &quot;I do not wanna work with him [Mano] anymore.&quot; Still, according to the former corintiano: &quot;I think he [Mano] is a very limited coach. I did not see anything special in him, and I do not think he will improve, because he does not have the humility to ask something.&quot;

Emerson Sheik returned to Corinthians in 2015 as Tite returned to the club as the new manager. He was a first choice for many of the first games of the season, including the 2015 Copa Libertadores. After Corinthians was eliminated in the Round of 16, the club opted against renegotiating Emerson&#x27;s contract, due to end in 31 July of the same year. He was released on 12 June, after both sides reached an agreement on the matter.

===Botafogo===
In April 2014, he was loaned to Botafogo, his third club in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. He took the shirt number seven, used before by Botafogo&#x27;s biggest idol, Garrincha.

==International career==
Emerson Sheik played 1999 South American Youth Championship for U-20 Brazil, while he was still known as aged 18 instead of 21. He was offered Qatari citizenship by Al-Sadd so that they could accommodate one more foreign player in their line-up. He accepted and he became a Qatari citizen in 2008. He made his international debut for the Qatar national team on 4 March 2008 in a friendly against Bahrain. He also played the next friendly, vs. Jordan, on 16 March and a World Cup qualifying match, vs. Iraq, on 26 March.

In April 2008, it was revealed that Emerson Sheik had also played for the Brazil under-20 team which makes him ineligible to play for the Qatari national team. Taking that into consideration, and that he represented Qatar in the World Cup qualifier against Iraq on 26 March, Qatar breached the FIFA rules, and Qatar could have lost the three points they gained from the game against Iraq. FIFA confirmed the breach of laws but said that QFA is not responsible for any wrongdoing, and that Emerson has since not played for Qatar. Although FIFA has loosened the nationality transfer of uncapped players and players with multi-nationality, it was not beneficial to Emerson, because he did not hold multi-nationality when representing Brazil.

==Controversy==
Emerson Sheik was detained by the Brazilian federal police on his way back to Qatar on 20 January 2006 for allegedly falsifying a birth certificate to show that he was three years younger than his actual age. The fake birth certificate, which was used to issue his passport, said that he was born on 6 December 1981 in Nova Iguaçu with the name &quot;Márcio Emerson Passos&quot;, but his original shows he was born 6 September 1978, with the name &quot;Márcio Passos de Albuquerque&quot;.

===Kiss issue===
On 18 August 2013, after the 1–0 victory over Coritiba FC in the Brasileirão, Emerson Sheik celebrated by kissing his friend and posting the photo on Instagram.

On 19 August, one day after the incident, homophobic Corinthians supporters protested the kiss during a training session. Emerson Sheik called the protests an &quot;idiotic prejudice&quot;.

On 21 August, in the first game after the incident, a 1–0 loss against Luverdense in the 2013 Copa do Brasil, Emerson Sheik was sent off along with opposition player Zé Roberto after they argued. Speaking to the press after the game, Zé Roberto, in reference to Emerson, said: &quot;I am not the guy that takes a kiss from anyone, I do not accept this kind of thing.&quot;

<text>Elisabeth Antoinette Irwin (29 August 1880 –16 October 1942) was the founder of the Little Red School House. She was an educator, psychologist, reformer, and declared lesbian, living with her life partner Katharine Anthony and the two children they adopted.

==Life and career==
Irwin was born in Brooklyn, to William Henry Irwin and Josephina Augusta Easton. Her father was a cotton merchant. She attended the Packer Collegiate Institute and received her A.B. from Smith College in 1903 and her M.A. from Columbia University in 1923. She was a member of the feminist intellectual club Heterodoxy.

In 1912, while a member of the staff of the Public Education Association, she began work at revising the curriculum for the children at Public School 64. She founded the Little Red School House curriculum in Manhattan in 1921, in the red-painted annex of Public School 61. Her work there, and then at Public School 41, is described in an article for &quot;The New York Times&quot; as an experiment to demonstrate that &quot;...the broader, more active program of the so-called progressive schools could be carried out under public school conditions.&quot;

Faced with funding cuts, it appeared that the experiment would end, but a group of parents came together in an ice-cream parlor, urging her to start her own school and promising financial support. In September 1932, the &quot;Little Red School House&quot; got its own building at Bleecker Street. At first, only primary education was available, but in 1940 a high school was added.

She died in the New York Hospital in October 1942. She was survived by her partner, Katharine Anthony, and their two adopted daughters, Mrs. Howard Gresens of Plandome, New York and Mrs. R.O. Bogue of Pensacola, Florida. Her funeral was conducted in Gaylordsville, Connecticut, where she and Miss Anthony maintained a summer home, having called themselves the &quot;gay ladies of Gaylordsville&quot;. She was buried there alongside Miss Anthony.

<text>Fort Scott National Historic Site is a historical area under the control of the United States National Park Service in Bourbon County, Kansas, United States. Named after General Winfield Scott, who achieved renown during the Mexican–American War, during the middle of the 19th century the fort served as a military base for US Army action in what was the edge of settlement in 1850. For the next quarter century, it was used as a supply base and to provide security in turbulent areas during the opening of the West to settlement, a period which included Bleeding Kansas and the American Civil War.

The current national historic site protects 20 historic structures, a parade ground, and five acres (20,000 m2) of restored tallgrass prairie, inside the city of Fort Scott. It is open to visitors most days of the year.

== History ==
In 1842, Fort Scott was named after Winfield Scott, was established on the American frontier on the military road in eastern Kansas between Fort Leavenworth and Fort Gibson. It was established to provide protection to the rapidly increasing number of settlers, who were migrating from the Eastern United States. Fort Scott became one of a chain of forts intended to protect the new settlers from the Plains Indians, as well as to protect the Indians from the settlers&#x27; encroachment.

The United States government intention to reserve permanent Indian lands west of the Missouri River gave way to the competition of settlers continuing to encroach on the Indian settlements. Fort Scott&#x27;s most active days were between 1842 and 1853, although it was also used during the Civil War.

=== Army days ===
The Cherokee of Indian Territory (now Oklahoma) were upset to have Fort Wayne in their proximity. After some delay, the US Army decided to abandon Fort Wayne and move its soldiers to a new fort to be built between Fort Leavenworth and the site. The Army both wanted to placate the Cherokee (who were supervised by the Department of Defense) and provide more defense for white settlers and other Indians against the Osage, who had been conducting frequent raids in the area.
On April 1, 1842, some soldiers of Fort Wayne left their fort and on April 22 arrived where Fort Scott would be built, in the Osage Cuestas section of modern-day Kansas. After haggling with the Cherokees to acquire the land, the rest of Fort Wayne&#x27;s garrison left the fort on May 26 and arrived at the Fort Scott site on May 30.

Unlike most forts for military use, the fort did not have defensive walls or structures when first built; the wide-open area and the available artillery made an enclosed fort unnecessary. The soldiers concentrated on building structures for lodging the men, animals, and equipment. These buildings were on the edges of a parade ground.

The post quartermaster, Captain Thomas Swords, was in charge of building Fort Scott&#x27;s structures, and had to deal with the problems of construction on the Kansas prairie, which had few trees. He had only two bricklayers and three carpenters to rely on, as there were few civilians and most of the soldiers had other duties to perform. Wood was available, but the mill was built away, making transport time-consuming. Swords found his efforts plagued by lack of wood, skilled labor and working equipment. Freak accidents destroyed much of the wood intended for the fort&#x27;s construction. As a result, only one duplex of the five planned officers quarters (four duplexes and post commandant&#x27;s house) was built by 1844, and the intended enlisted barracks were not completed. In his 1844 inspection of the fort, Colonel George Croghan reported that, in comparison to other frontier forts, he considered Fort Scott &quot;above average&quot;.

Due to the rising tensions that escalated in the Mexican–American War, the US Army redeployed troops to the Southwest. With Fort Scott still uncompleted, officials decided on April 25, 1850, that no more construction would be done there, after eight years and $35,000. By the time it was finished, it was obsolete; three years later, it was abandoned by the military in favor of the more western Fort Riley.

For the average soldier, life at the fort was &quot;monotonous&quot;. Until the permanent structures were built, soldiers had to live in tents, which lacked comfort. Aside from a few whiskey peddlers and prostitutes, few civilians lived at the fort. Officers had brought their personal slaves with them, including Captain Swords. The border with Missouri was east of Fort Scott. In Missouri was a grog shop that supplied soldiers, and quite a few courts-martial followed soldiers&#x27; going AWOL at the shop. The desertion rate from the fort ranged from 12 to 16%, due to boredom, irregular pay, and hatred for military life. As no combat took place near the fort, it seemed more of a frontier village than a military base. Hunting was a popular pastime; according to Captain Swords, &quot;wolf chasing and duck hunting&quot; was the only way one officer could tolerate the place.

=== Bleeding Kansas ===
Two years after the army abandoned the fort, the buildings were sold by auction to civilians, with two being converted to hotels. In 1854 the Kansas–Nebraska Act repealed the Missouri Compromise of 1820, which had kept slavery out of Kansas. Missourians in favor of slavery soon moved to Kansas to try to sway the vote of whether or not Kansas would permit slavery. Settlers from New England arrived equally determined to keep it out. Each of the two competing factions of the Bleeding Kansas conflict claimed one of the hotels at Fort Scott: Free-Soil at the Fort Scott Hotel and Pro-Slavery at the Western Hotel. Most of the residents in Fort Scott supported slavery, but those outside the town tended to the free-soil side. During this time, there were local incidents of murder and attempted arson, typical elements of the guerrilla conflicts that were prevalent in the fighting.

=== Army returns ===
During the American Civil War, the fort was renewed as a US military post. In August 1861, the Union Army took command of Fort Scott, and readied it for the war times. The United States Army also took over several blocks within the town for commissary and quartermaster functions. The Union Army rented the properties from the current civilian owners. Troops from Indiana, Iowa, Colorado, Ohio, and Wisconsin would come to the fort, and either stayed by the fort, or traveled farther, to subjugate Missouri, Arkansas, or the Indian Territory. Fort Scott was one of the few installations that recruited and trained black soldiers for the United States Colored Troops of the Union Army.

A major supply depot was situated at the fort. Confederate general Sterling Price hoped to capture the town, but the closest the Confederate force came to the garrison was away at Battle of Dry Wood Creek. The site was strategically important as it was within a Southern-sympathizing area and close to the Confederate state of Arkansas and the &quot;unstable&quot; Indian Territory (present-day state of Oklahoma), where many of the members of the Five Civilized Tribes were allied with the Confederates. The fort served as a &quot;general hospital&quot; (large military hospital) and prison until after the war. Following the end of the war, in October 1865 the US Army left the facilities and sold off by auction what they controlled.

On January 14, 1870, the Army returned with the formation of the Post of Southeast Kansas. The Post was based at Fort Scott, but the soldiers camped along the rail tracks, and seldom used the original fort. They were sent to protect the railroads and workers from settlers. Some of the latter feared that the railroad, which had been awarded land for development by the US Government in rights-of-way, would evict them from their squatter homes. The settlers considered the troops lackeys to the railroads, and lumped both as enemies.

Settlers also had some continuing conflicts with Indians and insurgents using the recent Confederate cause as excuse for robbery. By the spring of 1873, the US Army withdrew the troops from Fort Scott for good. From 1873 to 1965, the buildings of the fort were left unattended, and slowly deteriorated. Many military buildings were razed and replaced with structures built for civilian use.

== Modern times ==

With the Act of August 31, 1965, the National Park Service gave the city government of Fort Scott, Kansas the necessary funds and technical knowledge to restore the fort.

On October 19, 1978, Fort Scott became a National Historic Site under the supervision of the National Park Service, encompassing . Today the fort is open throughout the year, save for Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year&#x27;s Day. Visitation has declined in recent years. In 2005 visitation was 25,528; in 2007 it was 22,314.

Surviving structures include four officers&#x27; barracks, one dragoon&#x27;s barracks, two infantry barracks, a hospital, guardhouse, dragoon stables, ordnance and post headquarters, quartermaster stables, bake shop, flagpole, and magazine. Another feature of the park is of tallgrass prairie restored as part of an ecology-restoration project.

<doc id="1026688" wikidata="Q4633177" url="?curid=1026688" title="2NM">
<text>2NM (branded as &quot;981 2NM&quot;) is a local radio station in the Upper Hunter Valley of New South Wales, Australia. It is based in Muswellbrook and serves listeners in Muswellbrook, Singleton, Scone, Aberdeen, Merriwa, Murrurundi and surrounding areas.

The station transmits on 981 kHz on the AM band from a transmitter site located along Bengalla Road near Muswellbrook, near the Bengalla coal mine. Its studios, shared with sister stations 98.1 Power FM and low-powered narrowcast station 87.6MHz KIX Country, are located at 56 Brook Street, Muswellbrook. The Station moved from its old location at 100 Bridge Street in October 2018. The first live broadcast from the new studios was on Monday 29 October 2018. The station is owned by ARN.

2NM broadcasts an adult contemporary/classic hits music format, typically covering music from the 1960s through to today, focusing on 1970s to 1990s hits, aimed at an older audience. This is supplemented by local, rural and national news bulletins, a daily local affairs program, and programs sourced from Sydney station 2GB and from syndicated Nine Radio stations. All programs from 6am to 6pm weekdays and 6am to 12pm weekends are broadcast from the Muswellbrook studios, with longer hours of automated music during the summer months and public holidays.

==History==

===1937–1950s – 2CK Cessnock===
2NM was originally licensed to Cessnock as &quot;2CZ&quot;, owned by Coalfields Broadcasting Co Pty Ltd, but the station&#x27;s call letters were changed to &quot;2CK&quot; prior to its launch on 9 January 1937. The station operated on 1460 kHz, with a power output of 300 watts, and was managed by Albert Ryan.

The station catered for the mining community of Cessnock and surrounding areas, and was the official station of the Australian Coal and Shale Employees&#x27; Federation. A feature of their programme was a mining news bulletin, transmitted at 5.34am, 6.15pm and 9.00pm, relying on information from mine officials and managements. Because of the working hours of the local industry, the station commenced operations at 5.30am, with the first national news program in the country for the day transmitted at 5.45am, using the resources of the &quot;Newcastle Herald&quot;.

This was complemented with local and district news, racing programs from 2UW, the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; &quot;Sports Parade&quot; program (exclusive to 2CK in the region) and other programs of local interest. The station transmitted between the hours of 5.30am and 11am and from 5.30pm to 10pm weekdays, 5.30am to 11pm Saturdays and 9.00am to 10.00pm Sundays.

2CK was closed down after a fire burnt the studios down late one night after the announcer had finished the station&#x27;s transmission for the night at 10pm, and left in a rush for his bus back to Maitland, leaving the electric heater on.

===1937–1950s – 2HR Singleton/Maitland===
The Upper Hunter had its own station based in Singleton, &quot;2HR&quot;, owned by Hunter River Broadcasters Pty. Ltd. The station launched on 30 August 1937. The owners included the &quot;Singleton Argus&quot; and the Robinson family. Three years later, they moved to Lochinvar, near Maitland.

===1954–1980s – 2NM Muswellbrook / 2NX Newcastle===
Hunter Broadcasters had purchased the two stations during the early to mid-1950s, and decided to move both stations away from their existing locations. The 2HR license and transmitter was moved to Bolwarra, in order to serve the Newcastle market. 2HR was given a new callsign, 2NX. The 2CK license and frequency was moved to Muswellbrook, and also received a new callsign, 2NM.

The callsigns were devised by station manager Ken Robinson, who had served in the Australian Army. His army identification number included the letters &quot;NX&quot;. Therefore, the Newcastle station was given the 2NX name. 2NM&#x27;s callsign was created only after trying out other combinations that could smoothly follow 2NX. 2NM could also represent &quot;2&quot; &quot;N&quot;ewcastle &quot;M&quot;uswellbrook.

2NM was launched on 14 January 1954, from facilities located along the McCully&#x27;s Gap road just outside Muswellbrook.

In 1971, Hunter Broadcasters were taken over by Catholic Broadcasting Company, a division of the Catholic Archdiocese of Sydney. During this time, while during the day 2NX and 2NM were operated separately, from 6pm overnight, 2NM relayed 2NX&#x27;s programming, and was identified as &quot;2NXNM&quot; and as &quot;Upper Hunter 2NX&quot;.

In 1978, the station moved from 1460 to 1458 kHz, as part of a nationwide radio frequency adjustment. Two years later, on 2 August 1980, 2NM changed its frequency again from 1458 kHz to 981 kHz to improve reception in parts of the Upper Hunter. A new 5000 watt transmitter site was commissioned on Begalla Road, next to the Bengalla coal mine. The old 2NM tower on McCullys Gap Road was not torn down until 2009. The old transmitter building still stands to this day. 1458 kHz was reassigned as the Newcastle frequency for ABC NewsRadio.

The overnight simulcast of 2NX came to an end in July 1989, due to the opening of Newcastle&#x27;s first FM station, New FM, which was taking listeners away from 2NX, and as a result, 2NX changed formats to compete.

===1990s–2021 – Independence and expansion===
In the early 1990s, the station was sold to Grant Broadcasters, and moved to new studios in Muswellbrook. It is a breeding ground for young radio talent, names to come out of 2NM include: Brendan Jones 4MMM, 2MMM, and breakfast &quot;Jonesy and Amanda&quot; WSFM, Jamie Angel 2MMM Content director and Paul &quot;The bull&quot; Stanley. In the mid-1990s, the station opened a supplementary FM station, Power FM, on 98.1 kHz (coincidentally sharing the same numbers in its frequency as 2NM), which lead to 2NM focusing on an older demographic.

In 2009, the station began an online stream of its programming, along with sister station Power FM.

===2021–present – New ownership under ARN===
In November 2021, 2NM, along with other stations owned by Grant Broadcasters, were acquired by the Australian Radio Network. This deal will allow Grant&#x27;s stations, including 2NM, to access ARN&#x27;s iHeartRadio platform in regional areas. The deal was finalized on 4 January 2022. It is expected 2NM will integrate with ARN&#x27;s Pure Gold Network, but will retain its current name according to the press release from ARN.

==Programming==

Weekend programming includes local breakfast, Between The Posts on Saturday morning, Syndicated programming aired over the weekend includes 2GB&#x27;s &quot;Continuous Call Team&quot; during the National Rugby League season, on Sunday nights 20/20 Retro Countdown.
Network news and national rural news are taken on relay from 2UE Sydney, although 2NM takes &quot;Nine News&quot; during its NRL coverage.

==Coverage Area==
2NM&#x27;s primary coverage area is the Upper Hunter Valley of New South Wales, with its 5 kilowatt transmitter serving the shires of Muswellbrook, Singleton and the Upper Hunter Shire and surrounding areas. The signal reaches as far east as Maitland, and was even promoted as an alternative source of rugby league coverage by 2GB when former affiliate 2HD dropped the Continuous Call Team program in 2006. Even a local resident, &quot;Elsie&quot;, had her transistor radio hooked up to receive 2NM by 2GB technical staff in a stunt run that year.

Those involved in distance reception of radio signals often note the ability of 2NM&#x27;s signal to travel long distances in favourable conditions, with reports of reception in New Zealand (blocking out state radio services on occasion), as well as many parts of New South Wales and beyond.

==Former jingles and slogans==
*&quot;In the Hunter Valley, north to Tamworth, east to the Barrington Tops and west to Cassilis, this is 981 2NM&quot; – used at the time of the 1980 frequency switch
*&quot;Upper Hunter 2NX&quot; – used during 2NX simulcast periods
*&quot;2NXNM&quot; – used during 2NX simulcast periods

<text>Charles Brown (1820 – 2 September 1901) was a New Zealand politician from the Taranaki area.

==Personal life==
Brown was born in London, England, the son of Charles Armitage Brown (the close friend and biographer of the poet John Keats) and Abigail O&#x27;Donohue, an Irish house servant at Wentworth Place where Brown and Keats resided. Brown said later in life that his parents were married in a Catholic service in Ireland in August 1819, but this claim seems to be discounted by biographers as an attempt to cover up his illegitimacy, which was a social stigma in those times.

At the age of two, he was taken by his father to Italy, where they lived for a number of years, initially in Pisa and later in Florence. Brown received all his early education in Italy from his father. In his writings his father refers to his son by the name &quot;Carlino&quot;, and this appeared to be his commonly used name in England and Europe. In 1826 at age six, Carlino&#x27;s portrait was painted by artist Joseph Severn, who had nursed John Keats in his final illness and was a close friend of his father.

Around 1836 in order to provide a better education for Brown, they returned to England and lived in Plymouth. Unlike his literary father, Brown had a more pragmatic nature and was attracted to civil engineering.

In 1840, his father became a shareholder in the newly formed Plymouth Company, which aimed to colonise New Plymouth, New Zealand. Shortly afterwards, his father&#x27;s finances were ruined when he was forced to repay a friend&#x27;s loan having agreed to be guarantor. With what little fortune remained to him, his father decided that they should emigrate to New Plymouth, as a pioneer community would provide the best opportunities for Carlino as a civil engineer given their limited capital. Aged 17, Brown junior emigrated on the &quot;Amelia Thompson&quot;, the first settler ship of the Plymouth Company, arriving in 1841. His father followed on the &quot;Oriental&quot;, arriving three weeks later.

Brown and his father lived on top of a hill near the mouth of Te Henui stream, in what is now the suburb of Welbourn. The short Brown Street in that area is named in the family&#x27;s honour.

Brown&#x27;s father died of an apoplectic stroke on 5 June 1842, only eight months after his arrival in New Plymouth. He was buried on Marsland Hill above the original St Mary&#x27;s church.

Brown married twice; first, on 13 May 1851, Margaret Joy Horne with whom he had four daughters (and a son who died as a baby), and then Jessie Northcroft, with whom he had twin sons and a daughter. The children of the first marriage included:
* Laura Brown (later Mrs Tobin)
* Jessie Brown (later Mrs Brown)
* Lucy Brown
and from his second marriage:
* William A. Brown
* Charles Keats Brown
* Mona Martha Brown (later Mrs Gordon Osbourne)

==Professional life==
In 1839, Brown went to Midhurst in West Sussex to visit his uncle William. There he met Robert Chorley who agreed to employ and train him as a millwright and engineer. After serving a probationary term, Brown complained to his father that Chorley was no more than a simple millwright, and so after his apprenticeship he would have to look for employment elsewhere to obtain the promised qualification. By the end of the following year, the arrangement with Chorley was ended and Brown was engaged on designing a &quot;machine for cutting tobacco&quot;.

Brown brought saw-milling equipment with him to New Plymouth and established a successful timber business. He also founded and owned the newspaper &quot;Taranaki News&quot; from 1859.

In 1855, Carlino Brown – now, in New Zealand, known as Charles – became a member of the militia with the rank of Captain. He served in the New Zealand Wars, in particular, the First Taranaki War and the Second Taranaki War. In 1860, Brown commanded a force of 150 militia and volunteers in a major battle against three or four hundred Maori at Waireka Hill. He was promoted to the rank of Major on 7 November 1864. He was widely known as &quot;The Major&quot; in his community thereafter.

==Political career==
In 1852, the Constitution Act divided the colony into six provinces, each with an elected Provincial Council and governed by a Superintendent. On 16 July 1853 at age 33, Charles Brown was elected first Superintendent of the Taranaki Provincial Government. He was defeated at the next election and retired from the position on 4 January 1857. On 24 May 1861, he was again elected as Superintendent, holding that office until 4 September 1865. After the death of Edward Stafford in February 1901, he became the last surviving member of the six original provincial superintendents elected in 1853.




He served two separate terms in the 2nd New Zealand Parliament as representative for the Grey and Bell electorate. He was elected at the general election on 8 November 1855 and resigned on 16 August 1856 to (unsuccessfully) contest the superintendency.

He contested a 17 May 1858 by-election against Dillon Bell in the Grey and Bell electorate. Brown and Bell received 75 and 61 votes, respectively. Brown was thus declared elected. He resigned in 1860, when his militia service required his full attention.

He later served in the 3rd New Zealand Parliament as representative for the Town of New Plymouth electorate from 1864 to 1865, and in the 4th New Zealand Parliament as representative for the Omata electorate from 1868 to 1870.

He was Colonial Treasurer (forerunner to the modern Minister of Finance) in the first Fox Ministry under Premier William Fox.

With three others, Brown contested the New Plymouth electorate in the , but he came last.

==Later life==
Later in life, Charles served the community of New Plymouth as a Maori interpreter, having learned the language and customs of the Maori people over his long life in New Plymouth.

In the 1890s, Brown donated memorabilia of John Keats to the Keats House museum. Some he had inherited from his father, Keats&#x27; friend Charles Armitage Brown, while others were obtained from Keats&#x27; relatives and friends and their descendants with whom the Brown family remained in contact over the years. His descendants continued to donate Keats memorabilia over the years.

In 1901, aged 81, he stepped back into the path of a train in New Plymouth while crossing the main street of the town and was killed. The death of such a local celebrity, which was witnessed by many citizens, led to the relocation of the railway line.

Like his father, he was buried on Marsland Hill. His headstone names him as Charles Keats Brown.

==Popular culture==
Charles Brown featured in the 2009 film &quot;Bright Star&quot;, written and directed by Jane Campion which focuses on the final years of John Keats&#x27; life and his relationship with Fanny Brawne and Charles&#x27;s father Charles Armitage Brown. In the film, Charles Armitage Brown (played by actor Paul Schneider) is presented as close to &quot;a villain, a cynical boor who knocks up his housemaid (Antonia Campbell-Hughes) and banishes Fanny so the boys can work on their plays and poems&quot;. Abigail, the pregnant housemaid in the movie was presumably intended to represent Abigail O&#x27;Donohue, Charles Brown&#x27;s mother. In one scene, Abigail shows off her baby to the Brawne family.

<text>Nicholas Julian Zapata Sagan (born September 16, 1970) is an American novelist and screenwriter. He is the author of the science fiction novels &quot;Idlewild&quot;, &quot;Edenborn&quot;, and &quot;Everfree&quot;, and has also written scripts for episodes of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;. He is the son of astronomer Carl Sagan and artist and writer Linda Salzman.

== Life ==
At age six, Sagan&#x27;s greeting, &quot;Hello from the children of planet Earth,&quot; was recorded and placed aboard NASA&#x27;s Voyager Golden Record. Launched with a selection of terrestrial greetings, sights, sounds and music, the &quot;Voyager 1&quot; and &quot;Voyager 2&quot; spacecraft are now the most distant man-made objects in the universe, with &quot;Voyager 1&quot; having left the Solar System on August 25, 2012, being the first to do so. Sagan went to the Mirman School as a child and received his bachelor&#x27;s degree from the University of California, Los Angeles.

Sagan has been writing for Hollywood since 1992, crafting screenplays, teleplays, animation episodes and computer games. He has two older brothers; his brother Dorion is a science writer. He has worked for a variety of studios and production companies, including Paramount, Warner Brothers, New Line, Universal, Disney, actor/producer Tom Cruise, and directors David Fincher and Martin Scorsese. 

Sagan co-wrote the award-winning computer adventure game, &quot;Zork Nemesis: The Forbidden Lands&quot;. His film credits include adaptations of novels by Orson Scott Card, Ursula K. Le Guin, Pierre Ouellette and Charles Pellegrino. His television credits include two episodes of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; and five episodes of &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;, where he worked as a story editor.

At the turn of the millennium, astronaut Sally Ride recruited him to work for SPACE.com as Executive Producer of Entertainment &amp; Games. During his tenure at SPACE.com, the inspiration for a series of novels came to Sagan, and he sold the Idlewild Trilogy to Penguin Putnam in 2002.

&quot;Idlewild&quot; received a starred review from Kirkus, a Book Sense 76 pick, and selection from both Borders and Barnes &amp; Noble as one of the best science fiction/fantasy novels of the year. Neil Gaiman called it &quot;absolutely fun, like a roller-coaster ride of fusion fiction&quot; and &quot;the kind of book you simply don&#x27;t want to stop reading.&quot;

&quot;Edenborn&quot; continues the story from &quot;Idlewild&quot; (however it can also be read as a standalone). &quot;SFX Magazine&quot; gave &quot;Edenborn&quot; a perfect five star review, declaring it &quot;one of the best post-apocalyptic novels you will ever read.&quot; SF Crowsnest hailed Sagan as &quot;an adrenaline shot straight into the heart of science fiction,&quot; while SF Site called the novel &quot;elegant SF, dark and haunting, with characters who linger in memory long after the last page is turned.&quot;

The series&#x27; third instalment, &quot;Everfree&quot;, was praised by &quot;Sci Fi Weekly&quot; as being &quot;startlingly original&quot; and &quot;undeniably satisfying and triumphant.&quot; Kirkus remarked that &quot;Sagan&#x27;s mind-blowing post-apocalyptic trilogy comes to a satisfying, terrifying conclusion.&quot; They went on to hail the book as &quot;a powerful plea for sensible human cooperation delivered via a knockout story.&quot;

Sagan taught screenwriting at Cornell University in the spring of 2007. He currently teaches screenwriting at Ithaca College. Both institutions are in Ithaca, New York.

<doc id="1026695" wikidata="Q1413228" url="?curid=1026695" title="Retirement age">
<text>This article lists the statutory retirement age in different countries. In some contexts, the retirement age is the age at which a person is expected or required to cease work. It is usually the age at which such a person may be entitled to receive superannuation or other government benefits, like a state pension.

==History and establishment==

The first recorded use of a state pension was established in the Roman Empire in 13 BC by Augustus for military veterans who had served for at least 16 years in a legion and four years in the reserves. This was later increased to 20 years in a legion and five years in the reserves. In the United States, states historically lack a retirement age even though labor force participation rates began to fall dramatically after the age of 60. 

The first retirement age was set in Germany by Otto von Bismarck in 1881, originally at 70, before being reduced to 65 in 1916. Following this, more countries began to adopt an official retirement age, such as Britain with the passage of the Old Age Pensions Act 1908, which set the initial retirement age at 70 before it was reduced to 65 for men and 60 for women with the passage of the National Insurance Act 1946. 

The United States adopted an initial retirement age of 65, under the bill of the Social Security Act of 1935. By the mid-20th century, almost all countries had adopted a retirement age.

==Arguments==
Policymakers usually consider the demography, fiscal cost of aging, health, life expectancy, nature of the profession, supply of labor force, and more, while taking the retirement age into account. The increase in life expectancy is used in some jurisdictions as an argument to increase the age of retirement in the 21st century.

Arguments for lower retirement age for women include motherhood. Some countries are equalizing the retirement ages between women and men.

The expected years in retirement was 22.8 years for women and 18.4 years for men on average in OECD in 2022, contributed by sex differences in life expectancy.

==Reforms==
Reforms tend to be phased in slowly when the retirement age (or pension age) is increased with grandfathering, ensuring a gradual change. One of such examples of grandfathering is the transitional pension rules, which were applied for staff aged 54 years or older, and to some extent, for all staff in place, when in 2014, the retirement age of European civil servants was increased to 66 years of age.

In contrast, when the age of retirement is decreased, changes are often brought about rapidly.

==Retirement age by country and region==
Many of the countries listed in the table below are in the process of reforming retirement ages. The current trend in many countries is that the retirement age will increase gradually.

Many European Union member states apply a retirement age of 65 years in the 2020s. This is to be increased to 67 years in most countries by 2030.

In some countries, one&#x27;s year of birth determines their age of retirement. For example, in the United States as of 2024, while a person born before 1955 can retire with social security benefits at the age of 66, those born after 1959 must be 67. Each year between 1955 and 1959 adds 2 months. Many countries in Europe follow the same type of criteria, with one&#x27;s age of retirement determined by their birth year, for example in Romania, women born in 1955 had their retirement age in 2015 set at age 60 whereas those born in 1958 could retire in 2019 at age 61 and those born in 1961 can retire in January 2023 at age 62.

The average of statutory retirement age in the 34 countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in 2014 was males 65 years and females 63.5 years, but the tendency all over the world is to increase the retirement age. This is also reflected by the findings that just over half the Asian investors surveyed region-wide said they agreed with raising the retirement age, with a quarter disagreeing and the remainder undecided.

<text>Power FM 98.1 (call sign: 2VLY) is a local radio station in the Hunter Valley of New South Wales, Australia. It is based in Muswellbrook, and serves listeners in Muswellbrook, Singleton, Scone, Aberdeen, Merriwa, Murrurundi and surrounding areas.

It is owned and operated by ARN, and is licensed to subsidiary Radio Hunter Valley, along with sister stations 2NM and 94.5 Hot Country. Along with 2NM, it operates from studios at 100 Bridge Street, Muswellbrook. Power FM commenced operations on 7 June 1995, as Radio Hunter Valley&#x27;s supplementary licence, following a series of test simulcasts of 2NM.

The station transmits on 98.1 MHz on the FM band, from a transmitter site atop Mount Arthur, near the town of Muswellbrook. The station is licensed to operate at 20 kilowatts, but is reportedly restricted to 10 kilowatts to prevent its signal from spilling into the nearby Newcastle and Tamworth markets. The station also operates a translator on 102.7 MHz in Merriwa, broadcasting from the Bandera Downs transmission site with a power output of 50 watts. This frequency was launched in 2004 with the support of the federal government&#x27;s radio blackspots program.

Currently, the station airs an adult contemporary format, featuring music from the 1980s through to today&#x27;s top 40 hits, aimed at an audience aged under 35.

In 2009, it began streaming its programs online, along with 2NM.

In November 2021, Power FM, along with other stations owned by Grant Broadcasters, were acquired by the ARN. This deal will allow Grant&#x27;s stations, including Power FM, to access ARN&#x27;s iHeartRadio platform in regional areas. The deal was finalized on 4 January 2022. It is expected Power FM 98.1 will integrate with ARN&#x27;s KIIS Network, but will retain its current name according to the press release from ARN.

<doc id="1026712" wikidata="Q7028918" url="?curid=1026712" title="Nicodemus National Historic Site">
<text>Nicodemus National Historic Site, located in Nicodemus, Kansas, United States, preserves, protects and interprets the only remaining western town established by African Americans during the Reconstruction Period following the American Civil War. The town of Nicodemus is symbolic of the pioneer spirit of African Americans who dared to leave the only region they had been familiar with to seek personal freedom and the opportunity to develop their talents and capabilities. The site was named, at least in part, for a legendary African-American slave featured in abolitionist Henry Clay Work&#x27;s &quot;Wake, Nicodemus (1864).&quot; It is a mystical story of an old slave died away and buried in a hollow tree who had asked to be awakened on the Day of Jubilee.

==Buildings==
The historic site contains five buildings:
* Township Hall (now home to a temporary visitor center)
* African Methodist Episcopal Church
* First Baptist Church
* St. Francis Hotel
* Nicodemus School District #1 Schoolhouse

== History ==
Nicodemus was founded in 1877, led by Rev. W.H. Smith, a black minister, and W.R. Hill, a white land developer, and five other black men who formed the Nicodemus Town Company and began visiting churches in Kentucky to encourage people to move to Kansas. 
Kansas was a free state, part of the Underground Railroad and home to abolitionist John Brown. Handbills and flyers distributed by the company called Nicodemus a place for &quot;African Americans to establish a black self-government.&quot;

By the mid-1880s Nicodemus was a small, bustling town. There were two newspapers, three general stores and at least three churches. The town had a number of small hotels, an ice cream parlor, bank, livery and a number of homes. The population was an estimated 700 at the town&#x27;s heyday.

To ensure growth the town needed the railroad. The residents of Nicodemus made several attempts to reach out to various railroad companies in an attempt to attract a rail line to Nicodemus, but it was all to no avail. The railroad passed to the south. Over time people moved closer to the railway and established a new town called Bogue. Bogue has a population of 173 today.

Perhaps one of Nicodemus&#x27;s most famous residents is Veryl Switzer. Switzer was an All-American football player for Kansas State in 1951, 1952 and 1953. He went on to play two seasons for the National Football League Green Bay Packers, before taking leave to serve in the U.S. Air Force. He resumed his professional career with the Packers after 2½ years in the military. He later went on to play for the Calgary Stampeders and the Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League before retiring.

Switzer is now farming , in Nicodemus, and is one of the top investors in the creation of a flour mill there. A co-op was formed in 1999; and, while &quot;Promised Land Flour&quot; and &quot;Nicodemus Pancake Mix&quot; are being marketed, the flour mill has not yet been built.

The site is still home to several descendants of the original settlers.

In 1976, Nicodemus was designated a National Historic Landmark. It was designated a National Historic Site by an Act of Congress in 1996.

<doc id="1026713" wikidata="Q11104487" url="?curid=1026713" title="Mandatory retirement">
<text>Mandatory retirement also known as forced retirement, enforced retirement or compulsory retirement, is the set age at which people who hold certain jobs or offices are required by industry custom or by law to leave their employment, or retire.

As of 2017, as reported by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), only three European member states (UK, Denmark and Poland) and four OECD countries (Canada, Australia, New Zealand, United States) had laws banning mandatory retirement.

==Rationale==
Typically, mandatory retirement is justified by the argument that certain occupations are either too dangerous (military personnel) or require high levels of physical and mental skill (air traffic controllers, airline pilots). Most rely on the notion that a worker&#x27;s productivity declines significantly after age 70, and the mandatory retirement is the employer&#x27;s way to avoid reduced productivity. However, since the age at which retirement is mandated is often somewhat arbitrary and not based upon an actual physical evaluation of an individual person, many view the practice as a form of age discrimination, or ageism.

Economist Edward Lazear has argued that mandatory retirement can be an important tool for employers to construct wage contracts that prevent worker shirking. Employers can tilt the wage profile of a worker so that it is below marginal productivity early on and above marginal productivity toward the end of the employment relationship. In this way, the employer retains extra profits from the worker early on, which the employer returns in the later period if the worker has not shirked their duties or responsibilities in the first period (assuming a competitive market).

==Countries==

=== Australia ===
Compulsory retirement is generally unlawful throughout the various State and Territory jurisdictions in Australia. Among exceptions to the general rule, permanent members of the Australian Defence Force must retire at the age of 60 and reservists at 65. As well, since the passage of a constitutional amendment in 1977, judges on federal courts are required to retire at the age of 70.

===Brazil===
The Constitution of Brazil says in Article 40, Paragraph 1, Item II, that all public servants in the Union, States, Cities and the Federal District shall mandatorily retire at the age of 75. This regulation encompasses servants from the executive, legislative and judicial branches. It also applies to the Supreme Federal Court Justices, as per Article 93, Item VI, of the Constitution, and the Court of Accounts of the Union Judges, as stated in Article 73, Paragraph 3 of the Constitution (disposition added after the 20th Amendment).

=== Canada ===
The normal age for retirement in Canada is 65, but one cannot be forced to retire at that age. Labour laws in the country do not specify a retirement age. Age 65 is when federal Old Age Security pension benefits begin, and most private and public retirement plans have been designed to provide income to the person starting at 65 (an age is needed to select premium payments by contributors to be able to calculate how much money is available to retirees when they leave the program by retiring).

All judges in Canada are subject to mandatory retirement, at 70 or 75 depending on the court. Federal senators cease to hold their seats at 75.

=== Ethiopia ===
Citizens of Ethiopia over the age of 60 must retire, though the retirement age may be further reduced for individuals working in particularly hazardous occupations. Retirees are often faced with loss of benefits and insufficient funds to handle daily expenses.

===Israel===
A 2006 decision by Israel&#x27;s High Court of Justice stated that mandatory retirement at age 67 does not discriminate against the elderly.

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand, there is no mandatory retirement age except if working in a job that clearly specifies a mandatory retirement age. The normal age of retirement is the same as the beginning of pension payments, which is 65.

===Philippines===
Employees working in the government, who can retire as early as age 60, have a set mandatory retirement age of 65. Personnel including officials of the Philippine Armed Forces, the Philippine Coast Guard, the Philippine National Police, the Bureau of Fire Protection, and the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology are required to retire once they reach age 56. Judges are subject to mandatory retirement at 70.

In the private sector, it is illegal for employees and executives in the private sector to be forced to retire before age 65 with the exception of underground miners who are required to retire at age 60, and professional racehorse jockeys at age 55.

=== South Korea ===
South Korea enforces compulsory retirement before age 60 at the latest to all private companies, and 65 for public sectors. However, it is custom for most companies to lay off their employees between the ages of 50 to 55.

=== United Kingdom ===
In October 2006 with the Employment Equality (Age) Regulations 2006, the UK Labour Government introduced a Default Retirement Age, whereby employers were able to terminate or deny employment to people over 65 without a reason. A legal challenge to this failed in September 2009, although a review of the legislation was expected in 2010 by the new Conservative/Liberal Democrat coalition government. This review took place and on 17 February 2011 BIS published the draft Regulations abolishing the Default Retirement Age. Revised regulations were later implemented and, as of 6 April 2011, employers can no longer give employees notice of retirement under Default Retirement Age provisions and will need to objectively justify any compulsory retirement age still in place to avoid age discrimination claims.

The Judicial Pensions and Retirement Act 1993 establishes mandatory retirement for judges at the age of 75. This was increased from 70 in 2022.

=== United States ===
Since 1986, mandatory retirement has been generally unlawful in the United States, except in certain industries and occupations that are regulated by law, and are often part of the government (such as military service and federal police agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation). Earlier steps toward this include the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), which &quot;protects individuals who are 40 years of age or older from employment discrimination based on age. The ADEA&#x27;s protections apply to both employees and job applicants. Under the ADEA, it is unlawful to discriminate against a person because of his/her age with respect to any term, condition, or privilege of employment, including hiring, firing, promotion, layoff, compensation, benefits, job assignments, and training.&quot;

From the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations discussing the Age Discrimination in Employment Act:

====Professions====
* Pilots: the mandatory retirement age of airline pilots is 65. The Fair Treatment for Experienced Pilots Act (Public Law 110-135) went into effect on 13 December 2007, raising the age to 65 from the previous 60.
* Air traffic controllers: Mandatory retirement age of 56, with exceptions up to age 61. Most air traffic controllers are hired before the age of 31 (the hiring cutoff age for those with experience is 36).
* Foreign Service employees at the Department of State: Mandatory retirement at 65 with very narrow exceptions.
* Federal law enforcement officers, national park rangers and firefighters: Mandatory retirement age of 57, or later if less than 20 years of service.
* Florida Supreme Court justices: The Florida Constitution establishes mandatory retirement at age 70.
* Michigan Judges of all levels cannot run for election after passing the age of 70.
* Minnesota has statutorily established mandatory retirement for all judges at age 70 (more precisely, at the end of the month a judge reaches that age). The Minnesota Legislature has had the constitutional right to set judicial retirement ages since 1956, but did not do so until 1973, setting the age at 70.
* New Hampshire Constitution - Article 78 sets the retirement of all Judges and sheriffs at age 70.
* New Jersey Supreme Court also established mandatory retirement at age 70.
* Maryland Constitution establishes mandatory retirement age of 70 for Circuit and Appellate Court judges.
* Oregon – mandatory judicial retirement age of 75.

==Religions==
=== Roman Catholic Church ===

There is no mandatory retirement age for cardinals nor for the pope, as they hold these positions for life, but cardinals age 80 or over are prohibited from participating in the papal conclave as of 1970 because of the &quot;Ingravescentem aetatem&quot;. The Code of Canon Law specifies in Canon 401 that ordinary bishops, nuncios, and bishops with Curial appointments (but not auxiliary bishops) must present their resignation to the Pope when they turn 75, but he need not accept it right away or at all. Canon 538 makes a similar stipulation of diocesan priests who are requested, but not obliged, to offer to resign from their appointments at 75. Note that in either case, resigning from the active exercise of the office means giving up the daily responsibilities of the offices, not ordination itself. Once a man is ordained a priest or a bishop, he retains that character until his death, whether he is still working or has since retired.

<doc id="1026714" wikidata="Q120192" url="?curid=1026714" title="Stuart Highway">
<text>Stuart Highway is a major Australian highway. It runs from Darwin, in the Northern Territory, via Tennant Creek and Alice Springs, to Port Augusta in South Australia; it has a distance of . Its northern and southern extremities are segments of Australia&#x27;s Highway 1. The principal north–south route through the central interior of mainland Australia, the highway is often referred to simply as &quot;The Track&quot;.

The highway is named after Scottish explorer John McDouall Stuart, who was the first European to cross Australia from south to north. The highway approximates the route Stuart took.

==Route description==
===Overview===

Stuart Highway runs from Darwin, Northern Territory, in the north, via Tennant Creek and Alice Springs, to Port Augusta, South Australia, in the south – a distance of .

The Royal Flying Doctor Service uses the highway as an emergency landing strip and sections of the highway are signed to that effect. These sections of highway have been specially selected and prepared for the landing of aircraft which only takes place after the piece of road has been closed by the police.

There are petrol and other facilities (meals, toilets, etc.) available at reasonable intervals (usually around ) and more frequent rest stops. Some of the rest stops are located at scenic points with information boards, but others are little more than a picnic table and a rubbish bin in an otherwise deserted area.
===Northern Territory===

The Northern Territory section of the Stuart Highway starts from the edge of the Darwin central business district at Daly Street and continues as a dual-carriageway to the Arnhem Highway in Howard Springs. The highway continues south passing the Kakadu Highway to the Victoria Highway at Katherine.

At Daly Waters, the route number changes from A1 to A87. The highway then continues south passing the Roper Highway, the Carpentaria Highway and the Buchanan Highway to the Barkly Highway at Tennant Creek. The highway continues south into Alice Springs passing the Plenty Highway. It passes through the Macdonnell Ranges and finally crosses the Northern Territory/South Australia border south of Kulgera.

The highway was only fully sealed in February 1987 as part of the Australian Bicentenary roadworks programme. There are no police patrolling the majority of this remote highway and until the end of 2006 there was no speed limit outside towns and other built-up areas on the Northern Territory part. The unrestricted limit has now been generally set at . The bulk of the Northern Territory&#x27;s population not living in Darwin lies along its track.
===South Australia===

Stuart Highway passes through the Far North region to Port Augusta. The highway passes through the Woomera Prohibited Area where travellers may not leave the road. The highway continues south-east towards Adelaide.
==History==
===Background===
John McDouall Stuart led the first successful expedition to traverse the Australian mainland from south to north and return, through the centre of the continent, in 1861–1862. In 1871–72 the Australian Overland Telegraph Line was constructed along Stuart&#x27;s route. The principal road from Port Augusta to Darwin was also established on a similar route.

A track developed along the route of the telegraph, and by 1888 the road between Adelaide and Alice Springs was well known. Several wells along the route provided water, although these could run dry or be contaminated by dead animals, resulting in sections as long as without water.

The route was traversed by motor vehicles in the 1920s. While passable, sections of the road could be sandy, boggy, washed away in the winter, or rugged with boulders. Several creek crossings were required, though few were difficult. North of Alice Springs the road was in comparatively good condition, with sections allowing speeds of up to .


===Highway planning and construction===
With the onset of World War II, supply roads leading to the north of the country were considered vital by the federal government.
A central north–south highway was planned to connect the railheads at Alice Springs and Birdum,
with surveying completed in August 1940. The task of constructing the highway was split between the Main Roads Departments of three states, to ensure completion before the next wet season. New South Wales would construct the northern section of , Queensland the central section of , and South Australia the southern section of .

The Alice Springs–Birdum road was completed by December 1940, – upgraded from an often impassable track to an all-weather sealed highway that could cope with heavy military traffic. The highway was built in under 90 days. In one week, was constructed, which was claimed to be a world record. The new highway, in conjunction with the railways at either end, reduced the impact of Darwin&#x27;s isolation. Quick and efficient movement of military equipment and troop was possible, with the road remaining open throughout the wet season.

By March 1941, military authorities advocated extending the Alice Springs–Birdum road to Darwin. During the wet season, the road north of Birdum was impassable, which meant that a single railway line was the only connection through to Darwin. Construction was underway by October 1941, once again at a fast pace in an attempt to finish before the next wet season. The road was nearing completion in July 1942, although some sections were yet to be bitumenised.

===Speed limits===
There was no absolute speed limit in the Northern Territory before 1 January 2007 but maximum speed limits are now posted throughout the Stuart Highway. Previously, drivers were simply required to drive at a safe speed to suit the conditions. Thus, the Northern Territory section of the Stuart Highway had no speed limits at all. The Northern Territory traffic laws were updated from 1 January 2007 to be similar to the rest of Australia. This included placing a speed limit on all roads ( on major highways such as the Stuart Highway) and significantly increasing penalties for speeding.

The South Australian section is signposted as outside built-up regions, between Port Augusta and the Northern Territory border.

In October 2013 the NT Government announced a trial period of reverting to an open speed limit on the stretch between Alice Springs and Barrow Creek, beginning 1 February 2014. In September 2015, following the conclusion of the trial, a stretch of the highway had its speed limits derestricted. However, speed limits were restored to this stretch in November 2016; the highest is .

In March 2021, the road was closed due to a serious accident 500 km north of Adelaide at Wirraminna where the road collapsed due to burning diesel fuel that melted the road&#x27;s plastic culverts. Plastic culverts had been used in place of concrete as they were seen as the best material for this particular location as the flood plain of the river is acidic and can destroy concrete culverts.

The road was closed while repair works took place. The asphalt also had to be given time to cure and the section of road underwent testing with a road train. With this now complete, both lanes are reopened with speed restrictions in place. Traffic signage is now in place and road users are asked to take extra care while travelling through this section of road.

==Junctions==








==Motor racing==

Motor races have been proposed or undertaken on the highway since the 1950s.

In 1994 the first and only Cannonball Run in Australia ran from Darwin to Yulara and back again. Based on similar events in the United States, this event ended in tragedy when an out of control Ferrari F40 crashed into a checkpoint south of Alice Springs, resulting in the death of the two event officials manning the checkpoint as well as the two competitors. The remainder of the race had a speed limit imposed to prevent further accidents.

Stuart Highway is the highway taken in the World Solar Challenge. The race starts in Darwin, follows Stuart Highway to Port Augusta, and then Highway 1 through to Adelaide.

Stuart Highway North received a Historic Engineering Marker from Engineers Australia as part of its Engineering Heritage Recognition Program.

<text>Wesley Lee Fox (September 30, 1931 – November 24, 2017) was a highly decorated United States Marine Corps colonel with 43 years of service. Fox was a combat veteran – receiving the Medal of Honor for his heroic actions during the Vietnam War – and is considered one of the Marine Corps&#x27; legendary heroes. After retiring from the Marine Corps, he wrote a book about his career: &quot;Marine Rifleman: Forty-Three Years in the Corps&quot;; and, he served for 8 years as deputy commandant for the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets.

==Early years==
Wesley Lee Fox was born on September 30, 1931, to John Wesley and Desola Lee (née Crouch) Fox on a farm outside of Herndon, Virginia, the oldest of ten siblings. He attended Warren County High School in Front Royal, Virginia until 1946, quitting school after the eighth grade, intending to be a farmer.

==Marine Corps service==
===Korean War===
When the Korean War began, inspired by the military service of his cousins in World War II, Fox enlisted in the Marine Corps on August 4, 1950, shortly before his 19th birthday. He intended to serve for four years and then return to the farm. He completed recruit training at Marine Corps Recruit Depot, Parris Island, South Carolina in October 1950.
After a brief tour as a rifleman with the 2nd Marine Division at Marine Corps Base, Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, he was sent to Korea.

His first tour to Korea began in January 1951, serving as a rifleman with Company I, 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines. In March 1951, he was promoted to corporal. He was wounded in action in Korea on September 8, 1951, and sent to the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, and was awarded the Bronze Star Medal with Combat &quot;V&quot;.

He recovered and was released from Bethesda in March 1952, he served with the Armed Forces Police, in Washington, D.C., as a patrolman until September 1953 when he was reassigned to Marine Aircraft Group 11 in Japan.

===1954 - 1967===
In 1954, with the war in Korea over, he re-enlisted for six years. and was returned to Korea for his second tour, as a platoon sergeant with Company G, 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines. When he returned to the United States, he served briefly at the Marine Corps Base, Camp Pendleton, California, prior to being assigned to Drill Instructors School at Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego, California, where he completed the course of instruction in August 1955.

Completing his course of instruction in August 1955, he remained at San Diego serving as a drill instructor until August 1957 when he once again returned to the East Coast to attend Recruiter&#x27;s School at Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island, South Carolina, subsequent to being assigned duty as a recruiter in the Washington, D.C., and the Baltimore, Maryland areas from 1957 to December 1960.

In December 1960, Fox was ordered back to the West Coast and served as a platoon sergeant with the 1st Force Reconnaissance Company at both Camp Pendleton, California, and on Okinawa through November 1962. In December 1962, he was assigned as a troop handler at the Marine Air Detachment, in Jacksonville, Florida, and served in this capacity until September 1965. Gunnery Sergeant Fox next saw duty in the Office of the Provost Marshal, Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) in Paris, France.

In May 1966, he was promoted briefly to first sergeant, and shortly afterwards, he was commissioned as a Marine second lieutenant by Brigadier General John W. Antonelli on 27 May 1966.
Returning to the United States in August of that year, he became a platoon commander with the 2d Force Reconnaissance Company at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina.

===Vietnam War===
Beginning in September 1967, Fox served in the Vietnam War for 13 months as an executive officer of a South Vietnamese Marine Battalion. In November 1968, he was reassigned to Vietnam as the company commander of Company A, 1st Battalion, 9th Marines until May 1969. On February 22, 1969, during Operation Dewey Canyon in Quang Tri Province, he was wounded twice. He was wounded the first time in the shoulder when his company was attacked by a large enemy force. A first lieutenant at the time, Fox then personally neutralized one enemy emplacement and directed his company to destroy the enemy. After his company&#x27;s executive officer was mortally wounded, he continued to direct the company&#x27;s actions, ordering air strikes and coordinating the advance until the enemy retreated; Fox, the only officer left in his company still capable of resisting the enemy, was wounded again in the final assault, but refused medical attention while he reorganized his troops and prepared the wounded for evacuation. Fox was later promoted to captain on 1 April 1969. For his heroic actions, he was awarded the Medal of Honor by President Richard Nixon on March 2, 1971.

== Post-Vietnam ==
Fox graduated from Amphibious Warfare School at Marine Corps Base Quantico in 1970 followed by assignment as tactics instructor at the Basic School. He later served duty with Marine Security Guards in Europe and then later as training officer, 2nd Marine Division. As a major, Fox served a tour in Okinawa with 3rd Recon Battalion, then was assigned as Reconnaissance Officer in the Marine Corps Development Center. As a lieutenant colonel, Fox assumed command of 1st Battalion, 6th Marines from June 1982 to July 1983. Fox graduated from the Army War College at Carlisle, Pennsylvania and was next assigned as Fleet Marine Officer Second Fleet aboard for two years. His final assignment was as the commanding officer of Marine Officer Candidate School.

== Post-Marine Corps ==
Fox retired from the Marine Corps as a colonel on 1 September 1993 at the mandatory age of 62. Fox was one of the very few servicemembers that fought in the Korean War who was still on active duty during the Gulf War. He continued to wear the uniform for eight more years as a deputy commandant of cadets for the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets. During and following his time as a deputy commandant, Fox was a regular guest speaker at Virginia Tech, sharing his experiences with America&#x27;s next generation of military officers, business executives, and civic leaders.

In 2002, Fox wrote a book about his experiences in the military, &quot;Marine Rifleman: Forty-Three Years in the Corps&quot; and was featured on the 2003 PBS program &quot;American Valor&quot;. In 2011, he wrote a second book, &quot;Six Essential Elements of Leadership: Marine Corps Wisdom from a Medal of Honor Recipient,&quot; which is required reading for first year cadets at Virginia Tech.

Fox resided in Blacksburg, Virginia, with his wife, Dotti (formerly Dotti Lu Bossinger). They have three daughters. He died in Blacksburg on the evening of November 24, 2017, and was buried at Arlington National Cemetery.

==Military awards==

Fox&#x27;s military decorations and awards included:

* Marine Corps Rifle Expert Badge
* Marine Corps Pistol Expert Badge

===Medal of Honor citation===
The President of the United States in the name of The Congress takes pleasure in presenting the MEDAL OF HONOR to

for service as set forth in the following CITATION:

For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while serving as commanding officer of Company A, in action against the enemy in the northern A Shau Valley. Capt. (then 1st Lt.) Fox&#x27;s company came under intense fire from a large well concealed enemy force. Capt. Fox maneuvered to a position from which he could assess the situation and confer with his platoon leaders. As they departed to execute the plan he had devised, the enemy attacked and Capt. Fox was wounded along with all of the other members of the command group, except the executive officer. Capt. Fox continued to direct the activity of his company. Advancing through heavy enemy fire, he personally neutralized 1 enemy position and calmly ordered an assault against the hostile emplacements. He then moved through the hazardous area coordinating aircraft support with the activities of his men. When his executive officer was mortally wounded, Capt. Fox reorganized the company and directed the fire of his men as they hurled grenades against the enemy and drove the hostile forces into retreat. Wounded again in the final assault, Capt. Fox refused medical attention, established a defensive posture, and supervised the preparation of casualties for medical evacuation. His indomitable courage, inspiring initiative, and unwavering devotion to duty in the face of grave personal danger inspired his Marines to such aggressive action that they overcame all enemy resistance and destroyed a large bunker complex. Capt. Fox&#x27;s heroic actions reflect great credit upon himself and the Marine Corps, and uphold the highest traditions of the U.S. Naval Service.

<doc id="1026722" wikidata="Q7964382" url="?curid=1026722" title="Walter Brodie">
<text>Walter Brodie (1811 – 11 September 1884) was a New Zealand politician in Auckland, on both provincial and national level.

==Biography==
Brodie was born in 1811 in Eastbourne, East Sussex, England, as the sixth of twelve children. His mother was Anna Brodie (1779–1864), the daughter of &quot;The Times&quot; founder John Walter. His father was Revd Dr Alexander Brodie DD (1773–1828). His parents had married in 1802, and his father had become the Reverend at St Mary&#x27;s, Eastbourne, in 1809. His grandfather died in 1812, the year after Brodie was born, and his mother inherited 2/16ths of the shares in &quot;The Times&quot;; the same proportion went to her sister Mary Carden. In 1821, the two sisters and their respective husbands signed an affidavit that clarified that the shares were held by the daughters of &quot;The Times&quot; founder, and were not the property shared with their husbands. His father died in 1828.

Brodie emigrated to the colony in the early 1840s. He returned to England in 1844 and published a book on his experience of New Zealand colonial life titled &quot;Remarks on the Past and Present State of New Zealand&quot;.

Brodie returned to New Zealand, by way of Pitcairn.

In 1851, he imported English pheasants (&quot;Phasianus colchicus&quot;) and released them near Mongonui. At around the same time, Thomas Henderson imported Chinese pheasants (&quot;Phasianus colchicus torquatus&quot;) and released them on his property on his property, now known as the Auckland suburb of Henderson. Pheasants became common game birds in the North Island. Brodie also imported sparrows into New Zealand.

He represented the Suburbs of Auckland electorate in the 2nd New Zealand Parliament, but resigned before the end of his term on 6 December 1859. He did not serve in any subsequent Parliaments. He also participated in Auckland provincial politics, representing the Suburbs of Auckland electorate in 1855–1857.

Upon receiving his inheritance, which included his mother&#x27;s shareholding in &quot;The Times&quot;, Brodie returned to England with his wife and daughter around 1870. His daughter Josephine married George Daniel Moore at Holy Trinity, Paddington, on 1 July 1870.

Brodie visited Auckland again in December 1878. He died in England on 11 September 1884.

<text>Tallgrass Prairie National Preserve is a United States National Preserve located in the Flint Hills region of Kansas, north of Strong City. The preserve protects a nationally significant example of the once vast tallgrass prairie ecosystem. Of the of tallgrass prairie that once covered the North American continent, less than 5% remains, primarily in the Flint Hills. Since 2009, the preserve has been home to the Tallgrass Prairie bison herd.

==Description==
The NPS and The Nature Conservancy work toward preservation of the tallgrass prairie, while sharing the story of ranching legacy, American Indian history, and the diverse tallgrass prairie ecosystem in the heart of the scenic Flint Hills of Kansas.

There are over of maintained hiking trails in the preserve allowing visitors access to the tallgrass prairie. During the summer, narrated bus tours of the prairie are offered.

On January 29, 2008, Tallgrass Prairie National Preserve was named as one of the 8 Wonders of Kansas by the Kansas Sampler Foundation.

==Ranch history==
Development of Spring Hill Ranch began in 1878, with land purchases in the Flint Hills by Stephen F. Jones, a cattle rancher originally from Tennessee. He completed the ranch headquarters in 1881, and was one of the early adopters in the region of enclosed ranching, in which cattle movements are limited by stone walls, fences, or barbed wire. This was a marked change that swept across the Plains in the 1880s, caused in large part by overgrazing in open range operations. Over the years that followed his initial purchase, Jones expanded the ranch to a size of . The Second Empire style ranch house was built for Jones in 1881 at an estimated cost of $25,000. Jones was also responsible for construction of the Lower Fox Creek School, built on land he donated. Jones used the ranch to grow herds of purebred cattle of several breeds, as well as some purebred breeds of hogs and sheep. Jones sold the ranch in 1888 to Barney Lantry.

The Lantry family kept the ranch until 1904, primarily raising thoroughbred cattle. Spring Hill, the core of their holdings, was eventually divided up into smaller parcels. It was reassembled in a series of purchases executed in 1935 by George Davis, a grain dealer from Kansas City. Following Davis&#x27;s death in 1955, the property was eventually put into a trust, and operated as the Z-Bar Ranch.

Historic interest in the property began in the 1960s, when local groups organized the restoration of the Lower Fox Creek School. The ranch complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971, one of the first listings in the state. The National Audubon Society acquired an option to purchase the property in 1988, but this expired in 1990. It aroused wider interest in the property, resulting in its eventual acquisition by the National Park Trust. The entire ranch property was designated a National Historic Landmark District in 1997, primarily for its association with Jones and the end of the open range ranching era.

The Spring Hill/Z-Bar Ranch was purchased by the National Park Trust in 1994. Legislation introduced in 1991 called for the creation of the Preserve, but local interests objected to the condition that the National Park Service would own it all. U.S. Senator Nancy Kassebaum convened a group of stakeholders to seek agreement on the formula for a tallgrass prairie park. The group began work in January 1992, and a different model for a national park emerged; it would be a public/private partnership, managed by the National Park Service, but the land privately owned.

== Preserve history ==
In 1994, Senators Kassebaum and Bob Dole introduced Senate bill S. 2412 in Congress, which would allow the Federal government to create a national preserve under the public/private partnership ownership arrangement. The bill limited National Park Service ownership to no more than of the preserve, the remainder owned by the National Park Trust; both would manage the new park cooperatively. On November 12, 1996, the bill became , later codified under 16 USC 698.

On September 20, 2002, the National Park Trust donated approximately to the National Park Service; it included the 1881 historic ranch house, limestone barn and outbuildings, and one-room schoolhouse. The National Park Trust worked with the National Park Service to plan and develop the park from 1996 to 2005.

Though the National Park Trust was named in the legislation, the law allowed for successor non-profits to own the land and continue the unique public/private ownership and management relationship. So, in 2005, the National Park Trust sold the approximate to The Nature Conservancy. Additionally Texas billionaire Ed Bass owns grazing rights to nearly until 2035; his cattle dot much of the hills and valleys of the preserve.

== Management ==
The National Park Service and The Nature Conservancy established a bison herd with 13 animals in 2009 from Wind Cave National Park. The population of 90 bison not only represent a vital component for the tallgrass prairie ecosystem, but also help preserve the genetic integrity in the conservation of American bison. Typically a third of the prairie grasslands is burned each year. The fire and grazing animals are used to prevent trees from taking over the prairie.

<text>Dingley Askham Brittin (1823–1881) was an English solicitor. He spent three years in New Zealand as a and during that time, he represented the Christchurch Country electorate in the New Zealand House of Representatives for one term.

Brittin was born in Huntingdonshire, England, in 1823. He received an education as a solicitor, but during his time in New Zealand, he did not practice in that profession. Brittin came out to New Zealand on the &quot;Minerva&quot; in 1853, together with his wife, and his brother John Danns Brittin, his wife and son. The &quot;Minerva&quot;, one of the ships chartered by the Canterbury Association, had left London on 29 September and Plymouth on 12 October 1852, and arrived in Lyttelton on 2 February 1853. Other notable passengers on the ship were Henry Sewell, Edward Gibbon Wakefield, Jane and John Deans, Thomas Rowley, John Cuff, and Elizabeth Torlesse.

The Brittin brothers took up run 105 at the mouth of the Rakaia River. They sold their land in 1854, and took land in the Port Hills.

In the , Brittin was one of four candidates in the two-member Christchurch Country electorate. He came second and represented the electorate in the 2nd New Zealand Parliament in 1856, but resigned during the 1856 session before the end of his term; the Speaker read out his letter of resignation on 31 July, two weeks before the session finished. He had to return to England on &#x27;urgent business&#x27; in 1856 and feared that he may not be back in time for the start of the 1857 parliamentary session. In fact, he did not return to New Zealand, and historian George Macdonald noted that he &quot;was not heard of again&quot; in Canterbury. The resulting by-election was won by John Ollivier, who beat Crosbie Ward.

Brittin died in 1881 and is buried at All Saints, the Parish Church of St Ives. His wife Anna Maria Brittin, who died in 1902, is buried next to him.

<doc id="1026733" wikidata="Q1421690" url="?curid=1026733" title="Sikorsky CH-148 Cyclone">
<text>The Sikorsky CH-148 Cyclone is a twin-engine, multi-role shipborne helicopter developed by the Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation for the Canadian Armed Forces. A military variant of the Sikorsky S-92, the CH-148 is designed for shipboard operations and replaced the CH-124 Sea King, which was in Canadian Armed Forces operation from 1963 to 2018. 

The Cyclone entered operational service with the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) in 2018 and now conducts anti-submarine warfare (ASW), surveillance, and search and rescue missions from Royal Canadian Navy frigates. The helicopter also performs utility and transport roles in support of national and international security efforts. In 2004, Canada awarded Sikorsky Aircraft a contract for 28 CH-148s with deliveries originally planned to start in 2009. Deliveries were repeatedly delayed due to development issues and difficulty fulfilling contract requirements; the first deliveries, involving six initial helicopters (designated as Block 1), occurred during June 2015. Three years later, the Cyclone Block 2 achieved initial operating capability (IOC). The fleet was briefly grounded in early 2020 following a crash that was attributed to poor documentation and software flaws.

==Development==

===Origins===
Canada began to seek a replacement for the Sea King maritime helicopter in 1986 when it issued a solicitation for the New Shipborne Aircraft (NSA) Project. A variant of the AgustaWestland EH101 was selected and a contract was signed by the nation&#x27;s governing party at the time, the Progressive Conservatives. After a change of government to the Liberal party, the EH-101 contract was cancelled. The cancellation resulted in a lengthy delay to procure a replacement aircraft. The project took on increased importance in the early 2000s and another procurement competition was initiated.

On 23 November 2004, Canada&#x27;s Department of National Defence announced the award of a contract to Sikorsky to produce 28 helicopters, with deliveries scheduled to start in January 2009. In addition, Sikorsky&#x27;s subcontractors, General Dynamics Canada and L-3 MAS are responsible for in-service maintenance and the Maritime Helicopter Training Centre including two Operational Mission Simulators. Other elements of in-service support include the Integrated Vehicle Health Monitoring System, spares and software support.

The first flight of the first production CH-148, serial number 801 (FAA registration N4901C), took place in Florida on 15 November 2008.

===Delays and upgrades===
In May 2010, Sikorsky announced an engine upgrade for the CH-148 Cyclone by the end of 2012. General Electric was developing a new engine version based on the CT7-8A1. The CT7-8A1 makes the CH-148 Cyclone heavier and less efficient than expected. General Electric developed the CT7-8A7 to be certified by June 2012 and eventually integrated into the Cyclone as soon as possible. General Electric developed the upgraded engine at its own expense. The new CT7-8A7 engine version produces 10% additional horsepower. The CT7-8A7 included modifications to the fuel manifold and nozzles. Interim CH-148s were to be provided with CT7-8A1 engines.

Additional complications in the program, and restrictions from US government International Traffic in Arms Regulations delayed initial aircraft deliveries until 2010. Further delays resulted in expected delivery pushed to 2015. In 2013 Canada rejected the delivery of &quot;interim&quot; helicopters offered by Sikorsky that lacked critical mission systems. In September 2013, the Canadian government announced that they were reevaluating the CH-148 purchase, and would examine cancelling the contract and ordering different helicopters if that were the better option; by this point, Sikorsky had accrued over $88 million in late damages since 2008.

In June 2014, it was announced that the Canadian government had removed the mandatory requirement from Sikorsky to supply the CH-148 with a 30-minute run-dry main gearbox. This was a key safety feature defined as mandatory in the original RFQ and one of 7 concessions made to Sikorsky. The Canadian government stated that these concessions would not affect the safety of Armed Forces personnel. However, oil loss in the main gearbox followed by several other factors caused the 2009 crash of a S-92, a civil version of the helicopter, off the coast of Newfoundland. Sikorsky added an oil cooler bypass switch and stated a similar accident is extremely unlikely. The effectiveness of the bypass switch has been questioned as it assumes that the leak will happen within the oil cooler assembly, and that the bypass can be activated in time to maintain enough oil. In the case of the S-92 crash, a titanium stud sheared causing catastrophic oil loss through the oil filter assembly.

==Design==
The CH-148 has a metal and composite airframe. The four-bladed articulated composite main rotor blade is wider and has a larger diameter than the S-70 Blackhawk. The tapered blade tip sweeps back and angles downward to reduce noise and increase lift. Tethered hover flight has recorded 138 kN (31,000 lbf) of lift generated, both in and out of ground effect. Unlike the Sea King, but in common with almost all current production naval helicopters, the Cyclone is not amphibious and cannot float on water.

A number of safety features such as flaw tolerance, bird strike capability and engine burst containment have been incorporated into the design. An active vibration system ensures comfortable flight and acoustic levels are well below certification requirements. The Cyclone will feature a modified main gearbox, which has been redesigned since a March 2009 accident.

The CH-148 is equipped with devices to search and locate submarines during ASW, and is equipped with countermeasures to protect itself against missile strikes. The Integrated Mission System is being developed by General Dynamics Canada, as is the Sonobuoy Acoustic Processing System. The radar is a Telephonics APS-143B, the EO System a Flir Systems SAFIRE III, the sonar an L-3 HELRAS, and the ESM, a Lockheed Martin AN/ALQ-210. CMC Electronics provides the flight management system, named CMA-2082MH Aircraft Management System.

==Operational history==
The Canadian Forces were to take delivery of CH-148s beginning in November 2008. In April 2009 the Government of Canada waived late fees and allowed Sikorsky two additional years to deliver compliant Cyclones. In February 2010, the first CH-148 arrived at CFB Halifax. Shearwater Heliport is the headquarters of 12 Wing, which were operating the CH-124 Sea King. Due to delays and export restrictions, the first 19 of the 28 CH-148 Cyclones were to be delivered in an interim standard which does not meet the original contract requirements. This allows operational testing and training to begin before the end of the year.

In March 2010, the first CH-148 was embarked on for an intensive open seas trials including landing and takeoff. In June 2010, Sikorsky announced the Canadian Forces would receive six interim CH-148 Cyclones in November 2010. In July 2010, Sikorsky reached an agreement on delay payments and deliveries; deliveries of the remaining CH-148s with full capabilities were to begin in June 2012. All interim-standard helicopters were to be retrofitted by December 2013.

On 22 February 2011, the Office of the Prime Minister of Canada announced the proposed arrival of nine Cyclones on Canada&#x27;s west coast in the spring of 2014. By March 2011 the six interim CH-148s had not been delivered. On 3 March 2011, the federal government announced that it would impose a fine of up to on Sikorsky for failure to meet contractual obligations. In January 2012 it was reported Sikorsky would deliver five training CH-148s in 2012, including one &quot;fully mission capable&quot; CH-148 by June 2012, or face a further possible $80 million in contract penalties. On 10 July 2012 in reference to Sikorsky missing another delivery deadline, Defence Minister Peter MacKay called the Cyclone purchase &quot;the worst procurement in the history of Canada&quot;.

In December 2012, Louis Chenevert, chairman of Sikorsky&#x27;s parent corporation United Technologies Corporation, stated that the five CH-148s scheduled for delivery in 2012 would instead be delivered in 2013, along with three additional helicopters. The remaining deliveries are to follow. In October 2013, the project appeared to be on the verge of cancellation with the Canadian government ordering a possible change to the maritime helicopter requirements.
In June 2015, it was reported that Sikorsky was ready to begin deliveries of the first interim Cyclones to the Royal Canadian Air Force. Six helicopters were delivered on 19 June 2015, and two &quot;Block 1.1&quot; Cyclones were delivered in November–December 2015. These eight helicopters will allow for RCAF training on the Cyclone until the fully operational Block 2 Cyclones start to arrive in 2018. A ninth CH-148 was delivered in August 2016. The eleventh helicopter was delivered in March 2017 as deliveries of the weapons system continue. In June 2018, the Cyclone was declared to have reached its &quot;initial operating capability&quot;.

In July 2018, the RCAF announced that the Cyclone was assigned to a Canadian deployment as part of Operation Reassurance, with one helicopter leaving Canada on board .

In December 2021, the RCAF found cracks on the tails of 19 of the 23 CH-148s which had been delivered, leaving only 2 CH-148s without defects (the other 2 were already in long-term maintenance and had not been inspected), compromising Operation Lentus. The RCAF claimed that the issue had been addressed by the end of 2021, and CH-148 detachments continued to be deployed frequently on operations around the world throughout 2022. By December 2022, 26 out of 28 helicopters had been delivered, with most in Block 2 configuration.

==Operators==
* Royal Canadian Air Force – 26 helicopters delivered as of December 2022, out of 28 total ordered. One helicopter was lost at sea in 2020.
**406 Maritime Operational Training Squadron - since summer 2016
**423 Maritime Helicopter Squadron - since January 2018
**443 Maritime Helicopter Squadron - since August 2018

==Accidents==
* On 29 April 2020, an RCAF CH-148 from 423 Maritime Helicopter Squadron, attached to and based at the Shearwater Heliport crashed in the Ionian Sea during a NATO Mediterranean exercise, killing all six crew members aboard. As a result, all Cyclones in service were placed on an &quot;operational pause&quot; until it was lifted on 16 June 2020. An investigation attributed the accident to the electronic control system and fly-by-wire control law known as &quot;Command Model Attitude Bias Phenomenon&quot;. This resulted in the CH-148 responding insufficiently to pilot inputs when the flight director was engaged. The investigation concluded that manufacturer-supplied materials contained &quot;misleading or confusing&quot; information, incomplete sections on automation and lacked manoeuvre descriptions. The recommended fix was to modify software governing the electronic flight control laws and enhance flight mode annunciation and awareness to the crew.

<text>Portland Union Station is a train station in Portland, Oregon, United States, situated near the western shore of the Willamette River in Old Town Chinatown. It serves as an intermediate stop for Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Cascades&quot; and &quot;Coast Starlight&quot; routes and, along with King Street Station in Seattle, is one of two western termini of the &quot;Empire Builder&quot;. The station is a major transport hub for the Portland metropolitan area with connections to MAX Light Rail, the Portland Streetcar, and local and intercity bus services. The station building contains Wilf&#x27;s Restaurant &amp; Bar on the ground level and offices on the upper floors. It also has Amtrak&#x27;s first Metropolitan Lounge on the West Coast, which is reserved for first-class sleeping car and business-class passengers.

Southeast of the station, the tracks make a sharp turn and cross the river on the historic Steel Bridge. To the northwest, they follow the river, passing through rail yards before crossing the river again on the Burlington Northern Railroad Bridge 5.1.

The station is owned by the city of Portland and operated by Prosper Portland, the city&#x27;s urban renewal agency. The city earns $200,000 a year from nearly 30 tenants. Amtrak, the main tenant, has a continuing lease in 2021.

==Services==

Union Station serves as a major intermodal transportation hub for Portland and Oregon. Union Station connects to TriMet MAX Green and Yellow Line trains at the nearby Union Station/Northwest 6th &amp; Hoyt Street and Union Station/Northwest 5th &amp; Glisan Street stations, as well as local bus service provided by TriMet. Located at the northern end of TriMet&#x27;s transit mall, Union Station is also only a short walk to both lines of the Portland Streetcar, in the Pearl District.

The station is one of two western termini for the &quot;Empire Builder,&quot; Amtrak&#x27;s major long-distance train to the Pacific Northwest. The train splits at Spokane, with one section continuing to Portland by way of the Columbia River Gorge and the other continuing to Seattle. It is also a stop for the Seattle-Los Angeles &quot;Coast Starlight,&quot; Amtrak&#x27;s long-distance West Coast train. It serves as the southern terminus for two daily &quot;Cascades&quot; trains from Vancouver, British Columbia and four daily &quot;Cascades&quot; trains from Seattle, and the northern terminus for two &quot;Cascades&quot; trains from Eugene.

As of 2018, Union Station is the fifth-busiest Amtrak station in the Western United States (behind Los Angeles, Sacramento, Seattle and Emeryville) and the 21st busiest overall.

===Bus connections===
Portland&#x27;s former Greyhound bus terminal is the next building to the south, having moved to the building (from a location in the center of downtown) in 1985. Greyhound vacated the facility in September 2019 in favor of a curbside pickup location nearby.

==Station details==
Union Station is situated near the western bank of the Willamette River in downtown Portland&#x27;s Old Town Chinatown. The site is bound by Northwest Glisan, Hoyt, and Irving streets to the south; Northwest Broadway Street and Station Way to the west; Northwest Overton Street and Naito Parkway to the north; and Northwest Ironside Terrace and industrial and commercial zones to the east.

==History==

The initial design for the station was created in 1882 by McKim, Mead &amp; White. Had the original plan been built, the station would have been the largest train station in the world. A smaller plan was introduced by architects Van Brunt &amp; Howe, and accepted in 1885. Construction of the station began in 1890. It was built by the firm of Wakefield and Bridges for the Northern Pacific Terminal Company at a cost of $300,000 ($ in adjusted for inflation), and opened on February 14, 1896. The roof is made of bright red metal roof tiles, with exposed detailed pressed red brick, grey sandstone trimmings, and pebbledash stucco masonry exterior. A feature was the projecting metal canopies with cast iron support posts at the entryway. The annex, also constructed in 1896 also by Wakefield and Bridges, contained the freestanding steam plant, storerooms, telegraph office, laundry, and police-room. At the Depot&#x27;s opening in 1896, the yards in front of the station contained six parallel railroad tracks. Passengers gained entry to the tracks by passing through along, narrow, enclosed one-story shed appended to the east side of the station. The tracks remained unsheltered for almost 10 years.

The track shelters were built in response to the expected increase in travellers arriving by rail to attend the 1905 Lewis and Clark Exposition in Portland.

The signature piece of the structure is the 150-foot-tall Romanesque Revival clock tower with its four-sided 1898 Seth Thomas eight-day pendulum clock, has become one of the most iconic and recognizable features of the station. Each of the clock faces is 12 feet in diameter, with a minute hand 6 feet long and an hour hand 5 feet long. The clock has a 14 foot pendulum and 1,000 pounds of counterweight that drops almost 50 feet over 7 days. It is wound every seven days. Neon signs were added to the tower in 1948. The signs read &quot;Go by Train&quot; on the northeast and southwest sides and &quot;Union Station&quot; on the northwest and southeast sides.

The nearby Interlocking Tower, also called the “VC tower” was built in 1914 to replace an earlier, wooden, building at this same location that served the same function related to the complex track switching function necessary for the operation of the station-related trackage. Construction was likely related to improvements required to changes in operation after the Terminal Company granted use of Tracks 1 and 2 to the Oregon and California Railroad and Southern Pacific railroad. The building is a small two-story brick volume with a decorative parapet, glazed terra cotta or white “face brick” detailing remains virtually unaltered on its exterior. The Interlocking Tower at Union Station is believed to be the only remaining building of its type in Oregon, and one of just five in the western United States. Now leased to Tri-Met, the original interlocking function ended on November 5, 1997. This interlocking tower was added to the National Registry of Historic Places form for Portland Union Station in a 2015 update .

Dissatisfaction with the lack of a clear, formal entry and confusing circulation patterns and dramatically increased passenger load were factors that led to the need to remodel. In 1927, the prestigious Portland architectural firm of A.E. Doyle was hired by the Terminal Rail Company to remodel the station. Pietro Belluschi, a young designer with little architectural training at the time, was put in charge of the remodel. With input from Southern Pacific, Union Pacific and Northern Pacific, the owners of the Terminal Rail Company, the drawings were finished in 1929. Major changes included: structural, functional and formal reordering of the main waiting room (including removing interior cast-iron columns) and associated public spaces; reorganizing the entry and exit sequences from the street and tracks; and functional and formal reorganization of the wing between the restaurant dining room and the main hall. Dormers were added to permit more natural light to enter the station. All new exterior finishes were closely matched to the old. Marble for the floors and walls was shipped from Italy for the remodeling. Little has changed in the station since this remodel in 1930.

In 1931, a pedestal was built in the station&#x27;s courtyard and the Oregon Pony 1862-built locomotive was put on display in front of the station. The locomotive was moved to Cascade Locks Oregon in 1970.

In the early 1920&#x27;s, ninety trains moved in or out of the station daily, 52 steam trains and 38 electrics; a train would arrive or depart about every 11 minutes. Expansion of service at Union Station related to the Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway line in 1920s required significant changes to the building and track, and at its peak period of operation in the late 1940s Union Station had as many as 30 separate tracks, continuing east to Front Avenue. Over time, freight rail became less utilized as some businesses turned to trucks instead of railroads for shipment of goods.

In the years prior to Amtrak&#x27;s assuming passenger operations on May 1, 1971, the Union Pacific&#x27;s &quot;City of Portland&quot; ran to Portland from Chicago via Utah. Amtrak ran a successor train, the &quot;Pioneer,&quot; on a similar route to Portland until 1997.

The station was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.

The neon signs on the tower went dark in March 1971, because the railroads using it, Union Pacific, Burlington Northern and Southern Pacific, were preparing to transfer all of their remaining passenger services to Amtrak. For that reason, the station&#x27;s then-owner, the Portland Terminal Railroad (itself jointly owned by those three railroads), decided to discontinue operation of the signs. In 1985, two local non-profit groups, the National Railway Historical Society (Pacific Northwest chapter) and the Oregon Association of Railway Passengers, led a fundraising campaign for public donations to enable the signs to be restored to operation. New neon tubes, in place of the old, were installed in July, and the signs were switched back on and returned to regular use in September 1985. The &quot;Union Station&quot; signs remain illuminated continuously, while the &quot;Go by Train&quot; signs flash on and off, in a sequence of &quot;Go&quot;, then &quot;Go by&quot;, then all three words, then off and on and repeat.

In 1987, ownership of the station and surrounding land was transferred from Portland Terminal Railroad to the Portland Development Commission (now Prosper Portland) as part of the Downtown/Waterfront urban-renewal district. Shortly afterwards, Union Station underwent a renovation. It was rededicated in 1996 for its 100th anniversary.

In 2004, the roadway in front of the station was reconfigured, providing a new connection to the northwest and a forecourt. In addition, the area is being redeveloped, including new housing where railroad tracks once were.

In 2023, Prosper Portland re-evaluated the alignment of its continued ownership of Portland Union Station with the economic development mission of the agency. They concluded that a sale to an entity with a transportation-focused mission was in the best long-term interest of stakeholders and the station itself. According to &quot;The Oregonian&quot;, talks to sell Union Station to Amtrak stalled in early 2024 and Prosper Portland was still seeking a buyer who would be able to finance seismic retrofitting and other upgrades that are estimated to cost $250 million.

<text>The Adcox Student Prince was a two-seat open-cockpit biplane designed by Basil Smith and built by the students of the US Adcox Aviation Trade School in 1929. It was based on the one-off Adcox Special, and the first example flew on 17 September.

A single example of a Student Prince X was produced in 1931 powered by a 90 hp ACE engine.

As of 2004, a single example remains registered in the United States, which was successively re-engined with 100 hp Kinner K-5, then 110 hp Warner Scarab Junior, Comet 150hp, 150 hp Wright-Hisso A and 220 hp Continental E-225 in 1963.

<text>The Adcox A-100, also known as the Adcox Cloud Buster was a two-seat enclosed sporting biplane built by the students of the US Adcox Aviation Trade School, Portland, Oregon in 1931. Identified in some publications as Adcox Cloud Buster or Bidwell Cloud Buster Junior, it was originally powered by a Salmson AD-9 engine of 40 hp (30 kW), however in 1936 it was repowered with a more powerful, but heavier, 65 hp LeBlond 60-5D and later dismantled in 1938 after several other owners.

It was sold successively to Groat Aeronautical, Yale Air Service and on 20 August 1931 to William B Bidwell as the Cloud Buster Junior. The Bidwell-Yale Aviation Co was based at Gardiner Airport, Gardiner, Montana.

<text>D-5 is a professional digital video format introduced by Panasonic at 18th International Television Symposium in Montreux in 1993 and released a year later in 1994.

==Overview==

Like Sony&#x27;s D-1 (8-bit), it is an uncompressed digital component system (10-bit), but uses the same half-inch tapes as Panasonic&#x27;s digital composite D-3 format. A 120 min. D-3 tape will record 60 min. in D-5/D-5 HD mode. D-5 standard definition (SD) decks can be retrofitted to record high definition with the use of an external HD input/output box/decoder. There were native D5 HD decks as well that didn&#x27;t need an external processor and could record in both SD and HD. High definition conversion on D5 HD decks does not allow for any error correction that exists on standard definition recordings, as the full bandwidth of the tape is required for high definition recording.

==D-5 HD==
D-5 HD uses standard D-3/D-5 videocassettes to record HD material, using an intra-frame compression with a 4:1 ratio. It was introduced in 1994. D-5 HD supports the 1080 and the 1035 interlaced line standards at both 60 Hz and 59.94 Hz field rates, all 720 progressive line standards and the 1080 progressive line standard at 24, 25 and 30 frame rates. Four 48 kHz 24-bit PCM audio channels, or eight 48 kHz 20-bit channels, are also supported. D-5 runs at different data rates for different formats: 

* 323 Mbit/s (1080/59.94i/8CH, 720/59.94p/8CH, 480/59.94i/8CH)
* 319 Mbit/s (576/50i/8CH)
* 300 Mbit/s (1080/59.94i/4CH, 720/59.94p/4CH, 480/59.94i/4CH)
* 258 Mbit/s (1080/23.98p/8CH, 1080/24p/8CH)
* 269 Mbit/s (1080/50i/8CH, 1080/25p/8CH, 576/50i/4CH)

HD material is often captured for post production of film projects, whereby the D-5 HD scanning equipment is cheaper by the hour than a full resolution 2K film scan.

As of 2010, no D-5 HD camcorders have been offered for sale. Panasonic instead markets P2 camcorders for field production of 720p or 1080i and 1080p images.

In 2007, Panasonic introduced an add-on box (AJ-HDP2000) that allows a standard D-5 VTR to encode 2K (2048 x 1080) resolution material with 4:4:4 color space onto D-5 tape using the industry standard JPEG2000 wavelet-based compression.

<text>Cynthia Dorothy Albritton (May 24, 1947 – April 21, 2022), better known by the pseudonym Cynthia Plaster Caster, was an American visual artist and self-described &quot;recovering groupie&quot; who gained fame for creating plaster casts of celebrities&#x27; erect penises.

Albritton began her career in 1968 by casting penises of rock musicians. She later expanded her subjects to include filmmakers and other types of artists, eventually amassing a collection of 50 plaster phalluses. In 2000, she began casting female artists&#x27; breasts.

==Biography==
Albritton was born in Chicago. In the late 1960s, she became active in the free love and rock music subcultures. Albritton studied at the University of Illinois Chicago. In college, when her art teacher gave the class an assignment to &quot;plaster cast something solid that could retain its shape&quot;, she had the idea to create a lifecast of an erect penis, which would then become flaccid and exit the mold. She created molds using alginate, and Jimi Hendrix was the first celebrity that she made a cast of.
Frank Zappa found the concept of her casts both humorous and creative, though he himself had no interest in having his penis cast. Zappa became a patron of Albritton and moved her to Los Angeles. In 1971, after her apartment was burgled, Zappa and Albritton entrusted her casts to Herb Cohen for safekeeping. Albritton sought to create an art exhibition of her casts, but did not have enough participants. She made no new casts between 1971 and 1980.

In 1993, Albritton filed a lawsuit against Cohen because he would not return the casts that she had given him for safekeeping. She got all but three back. In 2000, Albritton held her first exhibition of the casts in New York City. She also decided to begin casting women&#x27;s breasts.

In 2009, Albritton won the Rob Pruitt Award at the first annual Guggenheim Art Awards, held at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. She was a candidate for mayor of Chicago in the 2011 election on the &quot;Hard Party&quot; ticket.

Albritton died from cerebrovascular disease at a care facility in Chicago on April 21, 2022, at the age of 74. Shortly before her death, Albritton donated a copy of her 1968 plaster cast of Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s erect penis to the Icelandic Phallological Museum.

==Legacy==
Albritton&#x27;s life has served as inspiration for multiple pieces of media, such as &quot;Good Girls Revolt&quot;, &quot;The Banger Sisters&quot;, and &quot;Drive-Away Dolls&quot;. In 2001, a documentary film, &quot;Plaster Caster&quot;, was made about her. She also contributed to the 2005 BBC Three documentary &quot;My Penis and I&quot;, made by British filmmaker Lawrence Barraclough about his anxiety over his penis size.

She inspired the songs &quot;Five Short Minutes&quot; by Jim Croce and &quot;Plaster Caster&quot; by Kiss. She is also mentioned in Momus&#x27; song &quot;The Penis Song&quot; and the Le Tigre song &quot;Nanny Nanny Boo Boo&quot;. Albritton&#x27;s voice features in a recorded telephone conversation in the album &quot;Permanent Damage&quot; by The GTOs

<text>Mantidae is one of the largest families in the order of praying mantises, based on the type species &quot;Mantis religiosa&quot;; however, most genera are tropical or subtropical. Historically, this was the only family in the order, and many references still use the term &quot;mantid&quot; to refer to any mantis. Technically, however, &quot;mantid&quot; refers only to members of the family Mantidae, and not the numerous remaining families of mantises. Some of the most recent classifications have promoted a number of the mantid subfamilies to the rank of family, e.g. Iridopterygidae, Sibyllidae, Tarachodidae, Thespidae, and Toxoderidae, while other classifications have reduced the number of subfamilies without elevating them to higher rank.

<text>Head of the Class is an American sitcom television series that ran from 1986 to 1991 on the ABC television network.

The series follows a group of gifted students in the Individualized Honors Program (IHP) at the fictional Millard Fillmore High School in Manhattan, and their history teacher Charlie Moore (Howard Hesseman). The program was ostensibly a vehicle for Hesseman, best known for his role as radio DJ Dr. Johnny Fever on the sitcom &quot;WKRP in Cincinnati&quot; (1978–1982). Hesseman left &quot;Head of the Class&quot; in 1990 and was replaced by Scottish comedian Billy Connolly as teacher Billy MacGregor for the final season.

The series was created and executive produced by Richard Eustis and Michael Elias. Elias had previously worked as a substitute teacher in New York City while hoping to become an actor.

A revival of the series was ordered and co-produced by Bill Lawrence&#x27;s Doozer and Warner Horizon Scripted Television. It was released on HBO Max.

==Synopsis==
&quot;Head of the Class&quot; is mainly set in the classroom of academically gifted high school students in the Individualized Honors Program (IHP) at Millard Fillmore High School in New York City. The IHP students comprised a diverse range of personalities, ethnicities and academic specialties.

For the first three years of the show, the IHP class had ten students. Arvid Engen (Dan Frischman) was a skinny, bespectacled nerd, mathematics expert, and budding scientist. Arvid&#x27;s best friend was the overweight, wisecracking cynic Dennis Blunden (Dan Schneider), a computer whiz whose fields were chemistry and physics and who had a knack for getting the socially inept Arvid involved in various schemes. Both characters wanted to go to M.I.T. Alan Pinkard (Tony O&#x27;Dell) was an ultra-conservative preppy and egotist; his area of expertise was political science and he was a devout fan of Ronald Reagan. Alan competed for the highest grades in the class with Darlene Merriman (Robin Givens), a spoiled rich girl who was probably even more self-centered than Alan and whose specialties were speech and debate. Both Alan and Darlene held the ambition of being named class valedictorian. Sarah Nevins (Kimberly Russell) did not have any particular area of expertise; she was the most down-to-earth of the IHP class and was once cited as having the lowest G.P.A. Maria Borges (Leslie Bega) was the pretty girl, but intelligent, with some emotional and mental issues but was very passionate about getting A&#x27;s (going as far as grounding herself in the pilot episode for getting a &#x27;B&#x27;), and Jawaharlal Choudhury (Jory Husain aka Joher Coleman) was an exchange student from India whose expertise was natural science. Eleven-year-old Janice Lazarotto (Tannis Vallely), despite her young age, was in high school and the IHP class because of her advanced intellect. Arts student Simone Foster (Khrystyne Haje) was a quiet, sensitive redhead with a particular fondness for poetry. A notable development in the show was the relationship between Simone and Eric Mardian (Brian Robbins), an aspiring writer and, outwardly, the most unlikely member of the IHP. Eric wore black leather, drove a motorcycle, acted tough, and ostensibly disliked anything academic (to Dr. Samuels&#x27;s delight, he was the only one in the class not on the academic team, although he would never leave the IHP). Eric constantly hit on Simone and the two eventually had an on-again-off-again romance.

There was some turnover in the cast in seasons four and five. Janice left for Harvard, Maria went to Performing Arts High School, and Jawaharlal moved to California with his family. New students included Aristotle McKenzie (De&#x27;voreaux White), described by Dennis as &quot;this reject from &quot;Do the Right Thing&quot;&quot; for his dreadlocks, Viki Amory (Lara Piper), a new-ager interested in quantum physics and skin-revealing clothing, and Alex Torres (Michael DeLorenzo), who had transferred from parochial school with a love for dance and an eye for the ladies (in particular, Simone and Viki). T.J. Jones (Rain Pryor), who had first appeared as a potential IHP member in season three, was eventually added to the program and the cast. Jasper Kwong (Ke Huy Quan) was introduced as a new transfer student late in season four.

Appearing as regulars throughout all five seasons were school administrators Dr. Harold Samuels (William G. Schilling) the principal of Fillmore High and Bernadette Meara (Jeannetta Arnette). Dr. Samuels was portrayed as the blustery, overweight principal of the school. He was ambivalent toward the IHP students. Dr. Samuels distrusted the kids (and had a particularly antagonistic relationship with Dennis, and tried to avoid Eric), but at the same time he was proud of their achievements and valued the prestige they brought to the school. He also distrusted the teaching methods of the class&#x27;s teacher, Charlie Moore (Howard Hesseman), concerned that Charlie&#x27;s methods – which often involved helping the IHP students branch out of their comfort zones and help them deal with the typical problems of kids their age, as well as using unorthodox methods of teaching the class subject at hand – might distract them too much from their studies. Ms. Meara was the level-headed assistant principal. There was some romantic tension between her and Charlie, although this ultimately came to nothing, and she later had a romantic friendship with Billy.

In season 5, Mr Moore got his big break in Broadway and decided to quit. Billy MacGregor, from Scotland, replaced Mr Moore. Unlike in the previous seasons, the students are allowed to call their new teacher Billy. The students get to prepare for senior year and the closing of Fillmore High School.

In the series, the students often faced off against the rival Bronx High School of Science. Also, in every season, the IHP students produced the school musical. Musicals staged by the students included &quot;Grease&quot;, &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot;, and&quot; Hair.&quot;

==Season synopses==
===Season 1 (1986–1987)===
Out-of-work actor Charlie Moore began the first season as a substitute teacher, but warmed to the IHP class immediately, making it his mission to get them to think rather than merely to know. Although they are gifted academically, the IHP students had plenty of problems in their personal lives, and Mr. Moore not only is there to listen, he shows an ability to get the students to solve their own problems while making it seem like they came up with the answers on their own. By Episode 6 (&quot;Teacher&#x27;s Teacher&quot;), the class&#x27;s original teacher Mr. Thomas (Roscoe Lee Browne) had returned to Fillmore High, seemingly ready to return to the IHP class once Mr. Moore&#x27;s tenure ended. After observing Mr. Moore&#x27;s unorthodox teaching methods for most of the episode (much to Charlie&#x27;s chagrin, as it also made apparent how much he would miss the IHP students), Mr. Thomas ultimately reveals he had no intention to return but came to observe Mr. Moore after hearing concerns about him from Dr. Samuels. Seeing Mr. Moore in action, Mr. Thomas gives him his blessing, leaving Mr. Moore to become their full-time teacher, knowing the IHP will be in good hands. Throughout the first season, Mr. Moore attempted to get the class involved in more than just their studies, encouraging them to play volleyball and make a music video for the school&#x27;s time capsule (this marks the first foray into the fondness of &quot;Head of the Class&quot; for musical production numbers). At the same time, the class brought Mr. Moore into the present, acclimating him to the importance of personal computers. Near the end of the season, the IHP faces their Russian counterparts in an academic tournament, foreshadowing their famous trip to Moscow in season three.

===Season 2 (1987–1988)===
Season 2 began involving the IHP in the school as a whole, with Mr. Moore involving the class in the school literary journal and encouraging a lampoon of the school newspaper. Mr. Moore also decides to put on a school production of the musical &quot;Grease&quot;, and encourages the IHP (who are initially reluctant) to participate, alongside other Fillmore students.

While first season had some episodes that showed Charlie&#x27;s personal life outside school, these become increasingly rare as the series continues. In season 2 (and thereafter), episodes consistently focus on the lives of the IHP students, with only a very few focusing specifically on Charlie; this is the last season in which we see Charlie&#x27;s apartment.

===Season 3 (1988–1989)===
====&quot;Mission to Moscow&quot;====
In 1988, &quot;Head of the Class&quot; broke new ground as it became the first American sitcom to be filmed in the Soviet Union with an episode filmed entirely in Moscow.

The IHP is invited to come to the country for a rematch of the academic meet that happened in season one, which ended in a tie. The class has a lot of experiences while in Moscow: Dennis and Arvid take an interest in two beautiful women, until they realise they might be KGB spies; Eric meets up with his relatives in what is a very positive experience for him; capitalist Alan has an argument with a die-hard socialist in a store (who is also on the opposing Russian academic team); Sarah and Darlene decide to record the sights and sounds of Moscow; Simone goes to put flowers on a poet&#x27;s grave and meets up with a charming Russian musician; Dr. Samuels believes that his hotel room is bugged, but ends up making a fool of himself; and Charlie has a brief romance with a schoolteacher.

The IHP eventually wins the meet and the respect of the Russian team. The episode concludes with both teams attending a concert in Gorky Park swaying to the song &quot;Far Away Lands&quot; (written and performed by American David Pomeranz and Russian rock star Sasha Malinin).

===Season 4 (1989–1990)===
The fourth season saw some significant changes to the cast of characters. Maria went to a performing arts school, Jawaharlal moved to California, and Janice went to Harvard as a sophomore. Several new characters took their place: Alex Torres (Michael DeLorenzo) was a Hispanic athletics student whose specialty was history, portrayed as having an eye for the ladies. Although Alex seemed attracted to Darlene particularly, both he and Eric competed for the affection of Simone and another new IHP student, the blonde hippie Viki Amory (Lara Piper). Another new character was aspiring filmmaker Aristotle McKenzie (De&#x27;voreaux White). T.J. Jones (Rain Pryor), a recurring character since the third season, joined the IHP in the fourth season (a remedial student with a streetwise attitude, T.J. was found to be smart enough to join the IHP). Also, the character of Jasper Kwong (Ke Huy Quan) was added to the IHP class late in the season. The season also showed them film a two-part episode at the NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. The students&#x27; final year of high school was split over seasons four and five. Howard Hesseman left the show after the fourth season. As Hesseman noted in a 1989 interview, &quot;We&#x27;re not doing the show that I was led to believe I&#x27;d do, and it&#x27;s difficult for me to get off that.&quot;

===Season 5 (1990–1991)===
In the first episode of season 5, Scottish teacher Billy MacGregor (Billy Connolly) arrived to replace the departed Charlie Moore (in the first episode of the season, it is explained to the dismayed IHP students that Mr. Moore&#x27;s acting career finally took off). Despite initial uncertainty and some hostility from the students, Billy proved to be a successful replacement for Charlie. He usually comes into the class bringing his bike. He insisted that the students refer to him by his first name, and although he was more rousing and less laid-back than his predecessor, he proved to be just as wise and caring (Billy also had a habit of boisterously greeting his class every morning with the phrase, &quot;good morning, geniuses&quot;, and facetiously barking to his students to, &quot;get out of here&quot;, when the bell rang at the end of the class. He also taught his class in a manner more akin to a stand-up comedian than a teacher). Many episodes from this season focused on Billy having to adapt to living in America and his attempts to romance Ms. Meara. Other aspects of Billy were his dislike of an outdated French textbook, which actually prompted one student to take a spur-of-the-moment jaunt to Paris, and his encouragement to the male students that the best way to get girls was to be themselves. The season (and the program itself) concluded with the IHP students graduating from high school. Janice Lazarotto (from seasons one–three) returned for a guest appearance in the finale, in which T.J. is named class valedictorian and the school is closed down and demolished.

==Episodes==

==Novel tie-in==
One major novelization was released, with the plot lines based on six episodes of the show. The book makes all the chapters flow together as one story, even though they didn&#x27;t happen one right after the other on the show. It was written by Susan Beth Pfeffer and released in December 1989 by Bantam Books. The book is 120 pages long, with six chapters, each based on a different episode.

* Chapter 1 – &quot;First Day&quot;, based on the 1986 episode written by Lisa Rosenthal (otherwise known as the pilot)
* Chapter 2 – &quot;A Problem Like Maria&quot; is based on the 1986 episode written by Cynthia Thompson
* Chapter 3 – &quot;Crimes of the Heart&quot; is based on the 1987 episode written by Valri Bromfield
* Chapter 4 – &quot;Cello Fever&quot; is based on the 1987 episode written by show creators Rich Eustis and Michael Elias
* Chapter 5 – &quot;Trouble in Perfectville&quot; is based on the 1987 episode written by George Beckerman
* Chapter 6 – &quot;Parents Day&quot; is based on the 1987 episode written by Ellis Bufton and Scott Glaze

All copyrights belong to Warner Bros. The novelization erroneously credits &quot;First Day&quot; as having been made in 1988 rather than 1986.

==Spin-off==
A year after &quot;Head of the Class&quot; left the air, Billy Connolly reprised the role of Billy MacGregor for a short-lived spin-off series, &quot;Billy&quot;.

==Revival==

In May 2020, a revival of the series was ordered, co-produced by Bill Lawrence&#x27;s Doozer and Warner Horizon Scripted Television. The order includes a pilot episode plus five additional scripts and will air on HBO Max. In March 2021, it was announced that a 10-episode first season was officially greenlit. In October 2021, a first look clip was released, with a November 4, 2021 series premiere date attached. In December 2021, the series was canceled after one season.

===Casting===
In November 2020, it was reported that Isabella Gomez was cast in the lead role as teacher Alicia Adams. Coincidentally, Gomez and Howard Hesseman (who played Charlie Moore in the original series&#x27; first four seasons), had both starred on the television series &quot;One Day at a Time&quot;, with Hesseman starring in the original series&#x27; final two seasons as Barbara Cooper&#x27;s father-in-law Sam Royer, while Gomez starred in the 2017 reboot as Elena Alvarez. It was also announced that &quot;Watchmen&quot; actress Jolie Hoang-Rappaport will join the cast as student Makayla Washington. In December 2020, it was announced that &quot;Little Fires Everywhere&quot; actor Gavin Lewis will join the cast as student Luke Burrows. In January 2021, Jorge Diaz, Dior Goodjohn, Brandon Severs, Adrian Matthew Escalona and Christa Miller joined the cast. The October first look revealed that Givens would be reprising her role as Darlene from the original series.

==Home media and syndication==
&quot;Head of the Class&quot; has appeared infrequently in syndicated reruns, airing on local stations and then briefly on TBS in September 1993 until November 1993 returning August 1996 until September 1996 weekday mornings, and on Nick at Nite in the early 2000s. Antenna TV began airing the series in January 2018. As of February 2020, the show was streaming on Roku Channel. The show is also streaming on HBO Max, and airs on the linear Rewind TV.

In 2020, it was announced that season 1 of &quot;Head of the Class&quot; would be released as a &quot;manufacture on demand&quot; (MOD) DVD by Warner Archive, starting on June 9, 2020. The show had previously not seen any release on home media. The show had multiple musical episodes, thereby making music rights licensing difficult, a common problem when preparing series for home release. Another series, &quot;WKRP in Cincinnati&quot; (also starring Hesseman), encountered similar issues.

<doc id="1026777" wikidata="Q426827" url="?curid=1026777" title="Third Day">
<text>Third Day was a Christian rock band formed in Marietta, Georgia in 1991. The band was founded by lead singer Mac Powell, guitarist Mark Lee (both of whom were the only constant members) and Billy Wilkins. The band&#x27;s name is a reference to the biblical accounts of the resurrection of Jesus on the third day following his crucifixion. The band was inducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame on September 19, 2009. They have sold over 7 million albums in the United States and had 28 number one Christian album chart radio hits. Their fans are known as &quot;Gomers&quot; after a song on their second album about Gomer.

== History ==
=== Forming years and independent recordings (1991–1994) ===
In 1991, high-schoolers Mac Powell and Mark Lee formed Third Day as a Christian music group with pianist Billy Wilkins and guitarist August McCoy. McCoy left the following year to pursue tertiary (geology) education. At a 1992 event at Lee&#x27;s Church, Third Day performed alongside a band called the Bullard Family Singers, which featured David Carr and Tai Anderson. Third Day invited Carr and Anderson to join them shortly after.

In 1993, the band started playing more frequently in the Atlanta region in order to make money to record an album. Wilkins left the group in order to pursue his teaching career. Third Day recorded at Furies Studios in Atlanta and with the production help of Carr, &quot;Long Time Forgotten&quot; was released in 1994, producing and selling 2,000 copies. In 1995, the band started looking for a second guitarist. After hearing Brad Avery play with singer Chris Carder, Avery was asked to audition. After playing &quot;Consuming Fire&quot; during the first rehearsal, Avery was officially asked to join the band.

The band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Contagious&quot;, was self-financed for $3,000 and recorded at Furies Studios. 1,000 CDs and cassette copies of the demo were released. While playing in Marietta, at the Strand Theatre, the owners offered the band a contract to sign with new independent record label Gray Dot Records. The band released the album &quot;Third Day&quot;, which sold 20,000 copies. Shortly after, Reunion Records bought out their Gray Dot contract and signed the band to a multi-album deal.

=== Recording contract with Reunion Records (1995–1997) ===
Reunion Records released the now official version of &quot;Third Day&quot;, which has sold over 300,000 copies and was well received by critics. The album also yielded their only mainstream rock radio hit in the U.S., &quot;Nothing at All&quot;, which peaked at No. 34 on the Billboard rock charts. Later in 1995, Christian music headliner Newsboys asked Third Day to open for them at five West Coast shows. The band also launched their own 65-city tour with All Star United and Seven Day Jesus opening for them.

In 1996, the band was nominated for a Dove Award in the category of &quot;New Artist of the Year&quot; and their video for &quot;Consuming Fire&quot; directed by Chris Metzler and Jeff Springer won a Billboard Music Award in the category of &quot;Best Christian Video&quot;. The video was shot on location in Bombay Beach, California and other places around the Salton Sea. This experience and discovering Leonard Knight&#x27;s Salvation Mountain nearby later inspired the album artwork for the band&#x27;s album &quot;Revelation&quot;.

In 1997, the band started working on their second album, &quot;Conspiracy No. 5&quot;. The album was produced by Sam Taylor, who had previously worked with King&#x27;s X and other Christian bands. The album was nominated for a Grammy and won Dove Awards for Rock Album of the Year and Rock Song of the Year (&quot;Alien&quot;). The following year, the band toured around the United States, both alone and again opening for Newsboys. Also in 1998, the band recorded a cover of Michael W. Smith&#x27;s &quot;Agnus Dei&quot; for his Dove Award-winning compilation project &quot;Exodus&quot;.

=== Mainstream and international success (1998–2006) ===
In 1998, the band started working on &quot;Time&quot; with Monroe Jones as the producer. &quot;Time&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award and won another Dove Award for the band. Some of the songs that were recorded for possible inclusion in the album, but left out during production, are on the EP &quot;Southern Tracks&quot;. During the band&#x27;s live shows they included a significant portion of worship music, prompting the band to release an album made up exclusively of worship songs. The subsequent album &quot;&quot; took about a week to record. In 2000, to support both &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Offerings&quot;, Third Day went on tour alongside Jennifer Knapp. Later in the same year, the band collaborated on the project &quot;City on a Hill: Songs of Worship and Praise&quot; with FFH, Caedmon&#x27;s Call, SonicFlood, Jars of Clay, and others.

In 2001, the band played in Australia and New Zealand on the heels of the success of the &quot;Offerings&quot; album. While touring in the US, Third Day recorded a concert attended by 15,000 fans at the HiFi Buys Amphitheatre in Atlanta to be released as their first DVD, &quot;The Offerings Experience&quot;. That same year, the band won five Dove Awards as well as their first Grammy. They closed the year with the release of their fifth studio album, &quot;Come Together&quot;, which won two Dove Awards and a Grammy. The album was certified gold the next year, along with &quot;Time&quot;. The band appeared in the 2002 film &quot;Joshua&quot;, the movie version of the story of Joseph Girzone. The Third Day song &quot;My Hope is You&quot; was included in the &quot;Joshua&quot; soundtrack album. In 2003, the band released a follow-up to their hit worship CD &quot;Offerings&quot; entitled &quot;Offerings II: All I Have to Give&quot;.

In 2004, the band released their seventh album, &quot;Wire&quot;, and toured the States with tobyMac and Warren Barfield. In June of the same year, they traveled to Europe for a two-week tour. Upon returning the band recorded a concert at Louisville and released it as the live album, &quot;Live Wire&quot;. During the same year, they collaborated on the soundtrack for Mel Gibson&#x27;s film, &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot;, played at the Republican National Convention and were featured on &quot;60 Minutes&quot;. In January 2007, the band played one night each in Melbourne, Brisbane, and Sydney, Australia.

The band&#x27;s next album, &quot;Wherever You Are&quot;, debuted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at No. 8. It also won the band their third Grammy Award.

=== Christmas and compilation albums (2006–2008) ===
The band recorded and released its first Christmas-themed album, &quot;Christmas Offerings&quot;, in 2006. In 2007, they released their first compilations of hits, &quot;Chronology&quot;.

On February 28, 2008, Third Day released a statement announcing Brad Avery&#x27;s departure from the band after 13 years and over 1,000 concerts. According to the official press release, Avery left the band to pursue solo projects and Third Day would not replace him, continuing on as a quartet. Following Avery&#x27;s departure, the band performed at the April 2008 Papal Youth Rally at St. Joseph&#x27;s Seminary in Yonkers, N.Y.

=== &quot;Revelation&quot; and &quot;Live Revelations&quot; (2008–2010) ===
Supporting the July 29, 2008, release of their new album &quot;Revelation&quot;, the band appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; where they performed the album&#x27;s first single &quot;Call My Name&quot; and on November 20, 2008, they appeared on &quot;The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson&quot; performing the album&#x27;s title track.

<doc id="1026782" wikidata="Q441986" url="?curid=1026782" title="Willy Caballero">
<text>Wilfredo Daniel Caballero Lazcano (born 28 September 1981) is an Argentine professional football coach and former goalkeeper. He is currently the assistant coach of club Chelsea.

He spent most of his career in Spain, representing Elche and Málaga and competing in La Liga with the latter club. In the summer of 2014 he signed for Manchester City, helping them win the 2016 League Cup. In 2017, he joined Chelsea where he was a backup keeper for four seasons.

Caballero made his senior debut for Argentina in 2018. He represented the nation at the 2018 World Cup, and was also a non-playing member of the squads that won a gold medal at the 2004 Summer Olympics.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Born in Santa Elena, Entre Ríos, Caballero started his playing career with Boca Juniors in 2001, where he won three major titles in 2003. On 14 December of that year he witnessed – from the bench – his team beat A.C. Milan 3–1 on penalties, in the 2003 Intercontinental Cup.

Caballero joined Elche of Spain in 2004, and when his daughter was diagnosed with cancer he agreed to a brief loan spell back in his country with Arsenal de Sarandí to care for her, published on Ivoox. With Elche, after a rough first season, he went on to become the undisputed starter, appearing in nearly 200 Segunda División games.

===Málaga===
On 10 February 2011, Caballero was transferred to Málaga in La Liga for €900,000 and two and a half years, as an emergency transfer – after the transfer deadline of 31 January – due to a serious knee injury to Sergio Asenjo (their previous starter, Rubén, was also unavailable due to physical problems); he made his league debut on 20 February, starting in a 1–1 draw at Villarreal, and played all the matches until the end of the campaign, with the Andalusians finally escaping relegation.

On 1 October 2011, Caballero entered Málaga&#x27;s history books as he kept his goal clean for 480 minutes, beating the club&#x27;s previous record of 429 held by Pedro Contreras since the 2001–02 season. On 16 October, he was sent off midway through the first half of an away fixture against Levante after touching the ball with his hands just outside the box – the hosts eventually won it 3–0.

On 18 January 2012, Caballero signed a contract extension, tying him to the club until 2016. On 25 March, playing against Espanyol, he fractured his left hand early into the game, being sidelined for the rest of the season.

Caballero returned to full fitness for 2012–13, featuring in all but two games and helping the &quot;Boquerones&quot; to the sixth position. Goal.com named him as the best player in his position for the campaign. At the end of the following season, he was nominated as the best goalkeeper in the league alongside Thibaut Courtois of Atlético Madrid and Keylor Navas of Levante.

===Manchester City===
On 8 July 2014, Caballero signed a three-year deal with Manchester City, for a fee believed to be in the region of £6 million excluding add-ons. He reunited at his new club with former Málaga manager Manuel Pellegrini, and his competitive debut came on 10 August in the 2014 FA Community Shield, playing the full 90 minutes in a 0–3 loss to Arsenal at Wembley Stadium; a week later, in the Premier League opener, he was an unused substitute at Newcastle United.

Caballero&#x27;s second official appearance for City occurred on 24 September 2014, in the 7–0 home routing of Sheffield Wednesday for the Football League Cup. He made his first league appearance away against Hull City three days later, relegating longtime incumbent Joe Hart to the bench in a 4–2 win.

Caballero&#x27;s third league match was on 26 September 2015, a 1–4 defeat at Tottenham Hotspur. Throughout the season, he was first-choice in the League Cup, receiving criticism in the national press before the final following a poor performance in the 1–5 loss to Chelsea in the FA Cup; in the decisive match at Wembley Stadium, he saved three attempts in the 3–1 penalty shootout triumph against Liverpool, and Pellegrini subsequently said he would rather lose the match to keep his word, whilst several pundits added that both player and manager deserved an apology with some remarking the performance was a lesson in loyalty.

Following the appointment of manager Pep Guardiola in the 2016 off-season, Caballero became the starter over Hart. Soon after, with the signing of Claudio Bravo, he returned to his backup role.

On 19 October 2016, Caballero appeared as a substitute in a 0–4 defeat by Barcelona at the Camp Nou in the group stage of the UEFA Champions League. After replacing the red-carded Bravo in goal, he saved a penalty from Neymar in the 87th minute of the match. Two weeks later, he deputised for the suspended Bravo in the 3–1 home win over the same opponent for the same competition.

On 1 February 2017, Caballero replaced Bravo. On his return to the starting XI, he kept a clean sheet in a 4–0 win over West Ham United at the London Olympic Stadium. Late into the month, in a 5–3 Champions League round of 16 win over Monaco, he saved a penalty from Radamel Falcao.

On 25 May 2017, it was announced Caballero would leave the club on the expiry of his contract, which occurred on 30 June.

===Chelsea===
On 1 July 2017, Caballero signed for title holders Chelsea on a free transfer. He made his competitive debut on 20 September, in a 5–1 home win against Nottingham Forest for the League Cup.

On 17 January 2018, Caballero saved a penalty from Nélson Oliveira in the shootout of a third round FA Cup replay win over Norwich City, which had finished 1–1 after extra time. Due to an ankle injury to first-choice Thibaut Courtois, he made his Premier League debut away to Brighton &amp; Hove Albion two days later, in a 4–0 success.

On 24 February 2019, during the 2019 EFL Cup final against cup holders Manchester City, with the match at 0–0 and a penalty shootout imminent, Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga refused to be substituted off for Caballero to face his old club as the team went on to lose 3–4.

With Arrizabalaga struggling to stay in form during the 2019–20 Premier League season, Caballero was selected as the starting goalkeeper for Chelsea in a cup match against Hull City in late January 2020. Caballero was then the starting goalkeeper for the next four league matches and a Champions League match before Arrizabalaga returned. Caballero played in the 2020 FA Cup final, a 2–1 loss to Arsenal On 20 May 2020, Caballero had his contract with Chelsea extended by one more year.

On 29 May 2021, Caballero won the 2021 UEFA Champions League final with Chelsea against his former club Manchester City, but was an unused substitute in the game. On 4 June 2021, Chelsea announced he would depart from the club at the end of the month when his contract expired, and thanked him for his contribution to the team with an extended article for his time and feats there.

===Southampton===
On 6 December 2021, Caballero signed for Premier League side Southampton on a one-month contract after Southampton&#x27;s two main goalkeepers both suffered injuries. Caballero had been training with EFL League One side AFC Wimbledon since leaving Chelsea in June. On 11 December 2021, Caballero made his competitive debut in Southampton&#x27;s 3–0 defeat to Arsenal. On 7 January 2022, Caballero extended his contract to the end of the season.

On 1 July 2022, Caballero signed a one-year contract extension with Southampton. On 10 July 2023, he retired from professional football at the age of 41 years old.

==International career==
Caballero played for Argentina at under-20 level, helping the nation win the 2001 FIFA World Youth Championship by playing in the competition&#x27;s last two games. In 2004, he was picked for the gold medal-winning squad at the 2004 Summer Olympics as backup to Germán Lux (also first-choice in the previous tournament).

Caballero was an unused member for the senior squad at the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup. In November 2014, he was called by manager Gerardo Martino for friendlies against Croatia and Portugal. He only won his first cap nearly four years later at the age of 36, starting in a 2–0 defeat of Italy on 23 March 2018 in another exhibition game, played in Manchester.

Caballero was included in the final squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia. He started the tournament due to the injury of habitual first-choice Sergio Romero, and made his debut in the competition on 16 June in a 1–1 group stage draw against Iceland. In the next match against Croatia, his mistake handed the opposition the first goal in a 0–3 defeat, and he was subsequently dropped by manager Jorge Sampaoli in favour of Franco Armani for the team&#x27;s final group match against Nigeria, which ended in a 2–1 win; he also did not feature in the round of 16 game, a 4–3 loss to France.

==Coaching career==
On 9 July 2023, Caballero was announced as the new assistant manager of Leicester City, becoming part of new manager Enzo Maresca&#x27;s backroom staff. He moved to a similar role at Chelsea in June 2024.

<doc id="1026785" wikidata="Q6646868" url="?curid=1026785" title="List of Washington (state) ballot measures">
<text>The U.S. state of Washington has had a system of direct voting since gaining statehood in 1889. Citizens and the state legislature both have the ability to place new legislation, or legislation recently passed by the state legislature, on the ballot for a popular vote. Washington has three types of ballot measures that can be voted on in a general election: initiatives, referendums, and legislatively referred constitutional amendments. In order to be placed on the ballot, supporters of a measure must gather signatures from registered voters. From 1898 to 1912, the only ballot measures allowed were legislatively referred constitutional amendments. In 1912, an amendment successfully passed to create a citizen-led process for initiatives and referendums, and the first successful initiative was passed in 1914.

Since adopting this process, ballot measures have become widely accepted as part of Washington&#x27;s electoral system. over 2,000 different initiatives had been filed with the state, along with a significantly smaller number of referendums. Of those, only a fraction have received the required signatures to be placed on the ballot. In recent years, ballot measures have been used to legalize politically contentious policies such as assisted suicide, same-sex marriage, and marijuana use. The use of signature gatherers (workers paid to gather signatures for ballot measures) has attracted significant controversy in the state, as has some activists&#x27; aggressive approach to ballot measures.

== Background ==

Washington entered the United States as a territory in 1853 and was admitted as the 42nd state on November 11, 1889. The Constitution of Washington, which had itself been approved by a vote of the people, laid out the first guidelines for ballot measures. Article XXIII, Section 1 dictated that constitutional amendments required passing by a two-thirds vote in the state legislature and being approved by a majority of voters in the next general election. This section also required that details of the amendment should be published in newspapers across the state before election day.

In 1912, Constitutional Amendment Article II, Sec. 1 passed. This amendment granted people the power to place measures on the ballot every election via petition. For one of these measures to be valid, it needed signatures of support from at least eight percent of the voting population, based on turnout from the previous election. Initiatives allowed people to propose new laws and referendums allowed people to challenge laws passed by the legislature. This system of &quot;direct legislation&quot; had previously been implemented in Oregon by William Simon U&#x27;Ren. In the time since this amendment&#x27;s passage, initiatives and referendums have become a prominent piece of Washington&#x27;s electoral landscape.

The prominence of ballot measures, especially citizen-submitted ones, has allowed Washington to lead the nation in social issues. In 1910, people approved an amendment granting women the right to vote, making Washington the fifth state to guarantee women&#x27;s suffrage. The passage of Initiative Measure 1000 (the &quot;Death with Dignity Act&quot;) in 2008 made Washington the second state in the nation to legalize assisted suicide. The following year, voters approved Referendum Measure 71, which marked the first time voters had expanded recognition of queer relationships at the ballot box. In 2012, Referendum Measure 74 passed, making Washington the ninth state to recognize same-sex marriage and the third to do so by popular vote. That same year, the passage of Initiative Measure 502 led to Washington becoming the first state to fully legalize marijuana for recreational use.

While state law on signature gathering includes a recommendation that organizers should not be paid to gather signatures, the practice of paying workers per signature gathered has been legal in Washington since 1994. Supporters of the practice claim that it allows campaigns to extend their reach and makes ballot access more accessible and point to measures that have passed with widespread public support as evidence. The practice has been criticized for potentially allowing campaigns to &quot;buy their way onto the ballot&quot;, most notably by former Secretary of State Ralph Munro. Some paid signature gatherers have been arrested on charges of forgery and election fraud for placing fake signatures on petitions.

Since sponsoring his first measure in 1997, Tim Eyman has been the most prolific sponsor of initiatives and referendums in the state. He has had 17 initiatives placed on the ballot as of 2021, with 11 being approved. Of those, only two have not since been overturned or modified by the courts. Eyman&#x27;s 2007 Initiative Measure 960 passed with 51% of the vote and created a new system of &quot;advisory votes&quot; for all tax increases passed by the legislature in Washington. While most of this initiative was overturned by the Washington Supreme Court in 2013, this system still stands. Advisory votes are not legally binding and exist solely to measure public approval, as such, they are not considered to be ballot measures.

== Types of ballot measures ==
=== Initiatives ===
There are two types of initiatives in Washington.
* Initiatives to the People are placed on the ballot and, if passed, become law. These initiatives require a number of signatures equal to or greater than eight percent of the votes cast in the previous state gubernatorial race. The signatures must be gathered over a period of six months.
* Initiatives to the Legislature are first submitted to the Washington Legislature for consideration. These initiatives require a number of signatures equal to or greater than eight percent of the votes cast in the previous state gubernatorial race. The signatures must be gathered over a period of ten months. If the legislature passes the initiative, it is enacted into law. If the legislature rejects the initiative, it is placed on the ballot for a vote of the people. If the legislature passes an alternative version, both the original and modified version will appear on the ballot.

=== Referendums ===
There are two types of referendums in Washington.
* Referendum measures are laws that have been passed by the legislature and are up for recall. These referendums require a number of signatures equal to or greater than six percent of the votes cast in the previous state gubernatorial race.
* Referendum bills are proposed laws that are placed on the ballot by the legislature. If passed by a public vote, they become law.

=== Legislatively referred constitutional amendments ===
Legislatively referred constitutional amendments are changes to the Washington State Constitution which have been approved by the legislature but require approval from the people. They require a two-thirds vote in the state legislature before being placed on the ballot.

<text>William Crush Daldy (1816 – 5 October 1903) was a captain and New Zealand politician.

==Biography==
Daldy was born on 20 April 1816 in Rainham, Essex, England. He started going to sea aged 16 on the &quot;Mayflower&quot;, a ship belonging to his father Samuel Rootsey Daldy, an Ilford coal merchant. His seafaring first brought him to Auckland in July 1841.

On 10 December 1840 he sailed from Liverpool in his schooner &quot;Shamrock&quot;, arriving in Auckland in July 1841, but remained a seafarer. In 1847 he started timber milling near Auckland. From 1849 he was a partner in the shipping firm Combes and Daldy. He was a shareholder of Auckland Timber Co and his son, W C Daldy Jr., was its secretary.

In April 1864 the Daldy family sailed to London and in 1865 he became the English agent for the Province. They returned on Combes and Daldy&#x27;s ship, &quot;Queen of the North&quot;, in 1866. Walter Combes died in 1870.

Captain Daldy was the first chairman of the Auckland Harbour Board from 1871. He was also a Justice of the Peace, Auckland Chamber of Commerce council member, Bank of New Zealand auditor, Auckland City Council member, New Zealand Insurance Co. director and volunteer fire brigade captain.

On 22 April 1841 Daldy married Frances Harriet Pulham, in Launceston. She died on 3 December 1877. They had 4 children, Frances Catherine Wrigley (25 April 1842-19 June 1879), Maryanne Maria Mee Davies (7 August 1848 – 24 June 1926), Edith Crush Daldy (1850-6 February 1924) and William Crush Daldy Jr (14 February 1852-1934).

William married Amey, &quot;née&quot; Hamerton, on 17 March 1880. Amey was president of Auckland branch of the Women&#x27;s Franchise League and of the National Council of Women, and William gave a speech saying, &quot;that men were cowards for not extending the franchise to women&quot;. Amey died in 1920.

Daldy died in Ponsonby, Auckland, on 5 October 1903. He had been in poor health for some time, before succumbing to pleurisy and dying of heart failure. He was buried at Purewa Cemetery.

== Political and military career ==

He represented the City of Auckland electorate in the 2nd New Zealand Parliament from 1855 to 1860, when he was defeated. He did not serve in any subsequent Parliaments. He was a minister without portfolio in the government of William Fox, and was also a member of the Auckland Provincial Council in 1857 and from 1861 to 1864. During the invasion of the Waikato in 1863 he was a senior captain of the Auckland Naval Volunteers.

<text>Alfred William East was a New Zealand politician. He represented the Omata electorate on the Taranaki Provincial Council from 5 November 1855 to 13 December 1856. He represented the Omata electorate in the 2nd New Zealand Parliament from 1855, but resigned in March 1860 at the outbreak of the First Taranaki War before the end of his term when he accepted a government appointment.

<text>Charles Elliott (22 September 1811 – 5 July 1876) was a New Zealand politician and newspaper proprietor.

==Commercial career==
Elliott was born in Barnstaple in North Devon in 1811. He came to New Zealand on the &quot;Mary Anne&quot;; the ship left the West India Docks in London in September 1841 and arrived in Nelson Harbour on 10 February 1842. His brother James came on a later boat. Having brought a printing press with him, Elliott established &quot;The Nelson Examiner and New Zealand Chronicle&quot; in 1842; this was the first newspaper in the South Island. In August 1842, he opened a bookshop in Nelson, one of the first in New Zealand. He held a sheep station in the Awatere Valley. He was particularly interested in horse racing and wrote for other publications under the pen name &quot;Cheval&quot;. He published texts written by the suffragist Mary Müller, to whom he was related through marriage, in his newspaper.

==Political career==
Elliott was elected to the first Nelson Provincial Council for the Wairau electorate and held the post from 10 August 1853 to 1 August 1857, and represented the electorate in the second council from 9 October 1857 to 18 October 1859. He then represented the Amuri electorate from 7 April 1860 to 29 November 1861. He lastly represented the Nelson electorate from 23 February 1863 to 27 March 1865. In parallel, he represented the Awatere electorate in the Marlborough Provincial Council from 16 April 1860 to 16 October 1861.


On 5 November 1855, Elliott—alongside William Travers—was elected unopposed to represent the Waimea electorate in the 2nd New Zealand Parliament. Elliott resigned before the end of his term on 20 March 1858. He did not serve in any subsequent Parliaments, although he stood unsuccessfully in the for the .

==Later life==
Elliott&#x27;s newspaper had to be shut down in 1874. He subsequently took on the role of immigration officer for Nelson Province. He died on 5 July 1876 in Nelson from a stroke. Elliott Street, and the Elliott Street heritage precinct (which also comprises parts of Trafalgar and Collingwood streets) was named after him.

<text>Oran Thaddeus &quot;Hot Lips&quot; Page (January 27, 1908 – November 5, 1954) was an American jazz trumpeter, singer, and bandleader. He was known as a scorching soloist and powerful vocalist.

Page was a member of Walter Page&#x27;s Blue Devils, Artie Shaw&#x27;s Orchestra and Count Basie&#x27;s Orchestra, and he worked with Ma Rainey, Bessie Smith and Ida Cox. He was one of the five musicians booked for the opening night at Birdland with Charlie Parker in 1949.

==Life and career==

Oran Thadeus Page was born in Dallas, Texas, United States, to a schoolteacher and musician mother. He moved with his mother to Corsicana where he began attending Corsicana High School and later Texas College while also working at the oilfields. His earliest gigs were in circuses and minstrel shows while also backing such blues singers as Ma Rainey, Bessie Smith, and Ida Cox. Page&#x27;s main trumpet influence was Louis Armstrong, though throughout his career he cited other local trumpeters, including Harry Smith (Kansas City) and Benno Kennedy (San Antonio) as being early influences.

In the mid-1920s, while still a teenager, Page is believed to have appeared with Troy Floyd and His Orchestra in San Antonio, Texas, and with Eddie and Sugar Lou, a dance band headquartered in Tyler, Texas, though no documentation has been unearthed to support his presence in either band. He also claimed to have appeared around 1925 with a band in Shreveport, Louisiana, known as Goog and His Jazz Babies and with a band in New Orleans known as French&#x27;s Jazz Orchestra, though no documentation has been discovered.

In 1926, he caught the eye of the bassist Walter Page (no relation) who had recently assumed leadership of the Oklahoma City Blue Devils. It is believed that Oran Page joined the Blue Devils circa 1927, though no known documentation exists to support his presence with the band until the fall of 1928. He played and toured with the Blue Devils until early 1931, when he joined the Bennie Moten Orchestra, the leading dance band of Kansas City.

Though not a regular member of the band, Page appeared as a vocalist, emcee and hot trumpet soloist with Count Basie&#x27;s Reno Club orchestra, after the Moten band finally disbanded upon that leader&#x27;s sudden death in April 1935. Page embarked upon a solo career during this period, playing with small pick up bands from Kansas City, where he had moved in early 1931.
The Reno Club, in downtown Kansas City, had a floor show, which included Page and vocalist Jimmy Rushing. Basie&#x27;s band was just starting to build their reputation, but in the summer of 1936—on the eve of Basie&#x27;s national success—and at the beckoning of Louis Armstrong&#x27;s manager, Joe Glaser, Page decided to pursue a solo career. He moved to New York City in December 1936.

Page&#x27;s career as a bandleader had an auspicious start, with sold-out appearances and an extended run at Harlem&#x27;s Smalls Paradise in the summer of 1937, but by 1939 he was struggling to maintain a regular working band. Nonetheless, he led several bands and combos of his own, particularly on New York&#x27;s 52nd Street, where he appeared from 1938 or 1939, and in many venues in Harlem. Page toured extensively throughout the southern United States, and throughout the northeast and Canada at the head of as many as 13 different big bands during the 1930s and 1940s. He appeared briefly with Bud Freeman&#x27;s Orchestra in 1938, and was a featured vocalist and hot soloist with Artie Shaw&#x27;s Symphonic Swing Orchestra in 1941 and 1942, with whom he recorded more than 40 sides.

From 1929, he made over 200 recordings, most as a leader, for Bluebird, Vocalion, Decca and Harmony Records, among others. His band backed the singer Wynonie Harris on the session that produced the hit &quot;Good Rocking Tonight&quot;, though Page was never credited as the leader. He was the leader of the house band at the Apollo Theater during the early 1940s. Page was known as &quot;Mr. After Hours&quot; to his many friends for his ability to take on challengers in late-night jam sessions, and he was recorded at Harlem&#x27;s Minton&#x27;s Playhouse in 1941 playing in a proto-bebop style. He recorded for the Mezzrow-Bechet Septet (on two consecutive dates in 1945, as Pappa Snow White, with Mezz Mezzrow, Sidney Bechet, Jimmy Blythe, Jr., Danny Barker, Pops Foster, and Sid Catlett, and on the second session with Cousin Joe on vocals.)

Page recorded duets with Pearl Bailey on &quot;The Hucklebuck&quot; and &quot;Baby, It&#x27;s Cold Outside&quot; in 1949. He traveled to Europe in 1949 and appeared at Salle Pleyel in the first international jazz festival there, and returned to Europe at least twice for extended tours in the early 1950s.

He was one of the most flexible of trumpeters, demonstrating a broad tone and a wide range on the instrument. He is considered by many to be one of the founders of what came to be known as rhythm and blues.

Page died in New York in November 1954, aged 46.

<text>Nymphetamine is the sixth studio album by English extreme metal band Cradle of Filth. Recorded between February and July 2004, it was released on 28 September by record label Roadrunner. &quot;Nymphetamine&quot; marks the first recorded appearance of guitarist James McIlroy on a Cradle of Filth album. He would later record guitar for the band&#x27;s 2010 release &quot;Darkly, Darkly, Venus Aversa&quot;. &quot;Nymphetamine&quot; is also the band&#x27;s final album to feature keyboardist Martin Powell.

== Content ==

The title is a portmanteau of &quot;&quot; and &quot;amphetamine&quot;, and Dani Filth explained it as referring to &quot;a drug-like addiction to the woman in question, with her insidious vampire qualities literally bringing her lover back from the brink of the spiritual grave, only to bury him further on the strength of a whim. This is very Edgar Allan Poe in style, and leaves one thinking that, despite the character&#x27;s inner agonies, he is really a welcome submissive who readily enjoys the terrible highs and lows of his relationship with this alluring and filthy succubus.&quot;

The album features guest appearances by ex-Theatre of Tragedy and Leaves&#x27; Eyes vocalist, Liv Kristine, and Doug Bradley, who starred as the cenobite Pinhead in the &quot;Hellraiser&quot; series and also collaborated on &quot;Midian&quot;.

&quot;Mother of Abominations&quot; begins with the chant of the phrase &quot;Ia! Ia! Cthulhu fhtagn!&quot;, which is a reference to H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s fiction, specifically the body of work encompassing the Cthulhu Mythos.

The title track appears on the album twice; in a three-part, nine-minute version (&quot;Nymphetamine (Overdose)&quot;) and again in a shortened five-minute version (&quot;Nymphetamine Fix&quot;).

=== Track-by-track commentary ===
Filth provided the following explanations for the album&#x27;s individual tracks in a July 2004 press release:

; Gilded Cunt
A harsh song demands an uncompromising title. The subject matter is simple. The &quot;gilded cunt&quot; refers to a spoilt dominatrix who demands worship through the acquisition of money. She is in actual fact, beneath the glitter of expensive jewellery, no more than tendered mutton dressed up as lamb. There was nothing quite as gratifying as screaming the word &quot;cunt&quot; at the top of one&#x27;s lungs for the mid-section of this vicious little ditty. I loved it! An extremely angry song in the vein of Sepultura&#x27;s &quot;Roots&quot;, mixed with choice &quot;World Downfall&quot; tracks by Terrorizer.

; Nemesis
In the wake of the September 11 attacks, few people could possibly remain unaware of the rising threat to world peace through concerted acts of terrorism. This song delves into the mind of one such militant and offers the reasoning behind his holy war: the needless loss of loved ones and the desire to avenge their memory against a privileged western enemy. This song seeks not to condone or encourage such retaliation, but to find an explanation. It is my personal favourite track on the album. Sounds like At the Gates meets Judas Priest meets Morbid Angel listening to &quot;Amor e Morte&quot;.

; Gabrielle
Yet another little gothic romance embroiled around a murderer&#x27;s infatuation with the dusky foreign woman of the title. I love the ending of the track, mainly because up to this point the character has only really poetic things to say about Gabrielle (although you do get the impression that something is definitely a tad sinister about his infatuation), but then everything finally darkens... The song rolls into culmination with a really Slayer-esque finale.

; Absinthe with Faust
Two sinners reflect on their lives of decadence and pomp as they share their last drink on the very verge of the abyss. This song was inspired by a night of guilt and nostalgia (in fact I felt a little at sixes and sevens musing over all the events of the last six or seven years) and attributing our success to devilish intervention, as in the infamous Goethe story where Faust sells his soul to the Devil in return for a life of riches and splendour. It features some of my favourite lines, and sounds like &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; era Metallica.

; Nymphetamine
The title track concerns itself with a love affair so intense, that although soured and dead, it ignites at the slightest sniff of re-invention. The cool thing about this song is that it is really a beast of several parts: a chimera. The main hub of the song is very lovelorn and drowsily melodic and it is these traits combined with shared female and male vocal passages that serve to highlight the plight of this, the title track of the album. However, this is offset against the first and last parts of the song, forming a darkly erotic triptych.

; Medusa and Hemlock
This track concerns itself with the priest and high priestess of a witch cult, who, through their utter devotion to themselves and the dark arts, conspire to invoke ancient forces from their graveyard slumbers, remaining as carnal gatekeepers in the interim. The lyrics join them in celebration of a triumphant return on Samhain night, when the deadways between the worlds are at their closest and most vulnerable to rupture. Sounds like &quot;The Twisted Nails of Faith&quot; meets early Destruction and Death in a misty cemetery.

; Coffin Fodder
This track is about escapism from a world ruled over by preachers, no-hopers and soul destroying vermin and the flights of fancy conjured by believing in one&#x27;s own destiny (no matter what entails). A very personal lyrical content, this is about rising above the unappreciative mob with a life-affirming &quot;fuck you!&quot; The main harmony is the closest Cradle have got to sounding anything like classic Iron Maiden, but this song also veers towards blast-lightspeed. Though not as brutal and uncompromising as &quot;Mother of Abominations&quot;, it is probably the fastest track on the album when and where it roars.

; English Fire
This song is very enigmatic. Slow, heavy and grandiose, it reeks of pomp and dark majesty, and rocks in a Sabbath, doom-laden context. Lyric-wise, it concerns itself with heritage and invigorated pride for one&#x27;s own country: not in a nationalistic, fascistic sense, but in terms of rebuilding the beauty and stature of a once great nation. Obviously the title implies that nation to be England (Cradle&#x27;s country of origin), but the words can be interpreted to speak of anyone&#x27;s homeland that is seen to be slumping from the weight of its afflictions. Sounds like Manowar meets Cathedral, interspersed with moments of melodic reflection.

; Filthy Little Secret
A very Lovecraftian tale about the guardian of an extraordinarily gifted beauty: a beauty who slips beyond the veil of the underworld at night to dam the rift between our world and the abyss. This she achieves by fucking everything that comes close to breaching the gap, therefore satiating demoniacal urges that want, quite literally, to rend our world apart. The twist comes when her guardian fails to resist his own desire for the beauty who, at all costs, must remain pure and untouched in our world in order that her erotically-charged spirit remain firmly hilted in the other. Any attempt to interfere with her seance will result in horrors from the pit slathering into the real world to wreak far worse atrocities than those they inflict nightly upon her gorgeous astral form.
This track was never intended for the album. In all honesty it was a total rank outsider even for the special edition, until it was played to the producer, who thought it was such a catchy metal anthem that it was immediately drawn out of retirement and rehearsed vehemently at the studio to bring it up to date. Sounds like Mercyful Fate meets Motörhead at death metal&#x27;s throat.

; Swansong for a Raven
This is the second part to &quot;Her Ghost in the Fog&quot;, and therefore follows the subsequent story of the young man avenging his woman&#x27;s rape and murder at the hands of a self-styled lynch-inquisition. The original (which culminated in the man, haunted by his lover&#x27;s spirit, burning those responsible alive in the village chapel) is expanded upon as he recalls the events of that fateful day. He too is then hunted by a vengeful mob in the same forest, where he converses with his lover&#x27;s beautiful, but dead and rotting, body. This has a very &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot;/&quot;Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; vibe.

; Mother of Abominations
A song about the great goddess Cthulhu and the awakening of her dark spirit from centuries of slumber, leading to the inevitable destruction of human existence. In truth, a continuation to &quot;Midian&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Cthulhu Dawn&quot;. This is a very brutal track, lightning-fast and uncompromising, much like the Great Old One herself, sweeping away all before her in a colossal tidal wave of violence and millennial bloodshed. Sounds like &quot;Nightside&quot;-era Emperor meets early, fast Cradle, with extra thrash.

== Release ==

&quot;Nymphetamine&quot; debuted at number 89 on the Billboard Top 200 chart, selling 13,818 copies, and reached number 92 in the UK Albums Chart. By early 2007 &quot;Nymphetamine&quot; has sold 147,000 copies in the United States alone, making it the most successful Cradle album to date. It has also been certified Gold in Europe by Independent Music Companies Association. Since its release, &quot;Nymphetamine&quot; has sold more than one million copies worldwide.

A music video for the &quot;Fix&quot; version of &quot;Nymphetamine&quot; was filmed by Dani Jacobs.

A Special Edition of the album was released in 2005, with an extra disc featuring two new songs, an alternate version of the title track, three cover songs, a guest appearance by King Diamond and a CD-ROM of the &quot;Nymphetamine&quot; promo video.

== Critical reception ==
AllMusic&#x27;s review was favourable, calling the album &quot;extremely entertaining&quot;.

The title track was nominated for a 2004 Grammy Award in the Best Metal Performance category.

== Legacy ==

&quot;Mother of Abominations&quot; appeared on the soundtrack to the 2005 horror film &quot;Alone in the Dark&quot;. &quot;Coffin Fodder&quot; is mentioned in episode four of the UK comedy television series &quot;The IT Crowd&quot;, as track four on a gift-wrapped CD given by the goth character Richmond to a grieving widow at a funeral. &quot;Nemesis&quot; is featured in episode six of season five of the US comedy television series &quot;Viva La Bam&quot; (in which Dani Filth and the band make a guest appearance). &quot;Nymphetamine&quot; (in its short, &quot;Fix&quot; version) appeared on the soundtrack to &quot;Resident Evil: Apocalypse&quot;.

<text>The Limfjord (common Danish: &quot;Limfjorden&quot; , in northwest Jutlandish dialect: &quot;Æ Limfjord&quot;) is a shallow part of the sea, located in Denmark where it has been regarded as an inlet ever since Viking times. However, it now has entries both from the North Sea and Kattegat, and hence separates the North Jutlandic Island (Danish: &quot;Nørrejyske Ø&quot;, which includes the old provinces of &quot;Vendsyssel&quot;, &quot;Han herred&quot; and &quot;Thy&quot;) from the rest of the Jutland Peninsula. The Limfjord extends from Thyborøn Channel on the North Sea to Hals on the Kattegat. It is approximately 180 kilometres (111 miles) long and of an irregular shape with numerous bays, narrowings, and islands, most notably Mors, and the smaller ones Fur, Venø, Jegindø, Egholm and Livø. It is deepest at Hvalpsund (24 metres).

Its main port is Aalborg, where a railway bridge (Jernbanebroen over Limfjorden) and road bridge (Limfjordsbroen) have been built across the Limfjord to Nørresundby, while motorway E45 crosses it through a tunnel to the east. Commercial ports also exist at Thisted, Nykøbing Mors, Skive, Løgstør, Struer, Lemvig and Thyborøn. There are also bridges at Oddesund, Sallingsund, Vilsund, Aggersund and Sebbersund, and a number of ferry crossings.

==History==
===Western opening===
From the early Middle Ages until 1825, the Limfjord was only open to the sea at its east end. In that year, the North Sea broke through from the west and created a second opening, turning the northern part of Jutland Vendsyssel-Thy into an island.

An isthmus of shifting sand had separated the Limfjord from the North Sea during historic times. The present inlet, Thyborøn Channel, has existed only since 1862. A passage also existed during the Viking Age. Based on place names and the geography, it is thought to have been to the south of the present one, between Ferring Sø (locally still called &#x27;the Fjord&#x27;) and Hygum Nor. Canute the Great sailed into it in 1027 on his way back from England. According to Saxo Grammaticus it closed at some time around 1200. There are records of several floods piercing the isthmus during the 16th to early 19th century.

On 3 February 1825 a flood pierced a permanent opening, the so-called Agger Channel, in the north of the 13 km long and less than 1 km wide isthmus, the Agger Tange, which had until then linked Thy with the rest of Jutland. The western part of North Jutland lost its road connection with mainland Jutland, but the towns and harbours in the western part of the Limfjord could benefit from becoming directly accessible from the North Sea, to the dismay of Aalborg. From the 1840s the western route became increasingly important, as Britain had opened for import of grain, and ships could return with British coal. However, the instability of Agger Channel made the towns of the western Limfjord look for a second option.

In 1862, a flood pierced another opening, the Thyborøn Channel, through the remainder of Agger Tange (see satellite image). Agger Channel was continuously filling with sand and eventually closed in 1877. Since then, the remaining Thyborøn Channel has been kept open and navigable by dredging. The harbour of Thyborøn was built in 1914–1918 and a town was founded. The two isthmuses have shifted eastwards since the 1800s. They have only been preserved by groynes, persistent sandpumping and two road dams along their inward (eastern) side.

===Løgstør Banks and the Frederik VII Canal===
At Løgstør, where the wide, western part of the Limfjord meets the narrow eastern section, the infamous sand banks of Løgstør Grunde were an obstacle to ships. Larger ships needed to be unloaded and reloaded when passing the banks. The Frederik VII Canal at Løgstør was completed in 1861 to allow for easier passage. Traffic had increased after the western opening at Thyborøn became navigable. The sand banks were finally dredged out in 1901, rendering the canal obsolete. The canal is now a well-preserved heritage site.

===Plans for re-closing the western inlet===
A 1946 act provided for re-closing the Channel with dams and sluices at Thyborøn, but this was never carried out. This idea re-emerged in 2005 and is now officially being investigated. It is thought that the isthmuses would be easier to preserve, and that the water level of the Limfjord would be more controllable. In periods of persistent western winds, flooding occurs on low-lying land and harbour areas in the towns of the western Limfjord, since the water can&#x27;t escape through the narrow, eastern part of the Limfjord.

Historically, a North Sea to Limfjord canal has also been proposed between Hanstholm harbour and Vejlerne (or Klitmøller and Thisted), e.g. by Jørgen Fibiger in 1933, the engineer behind the project of Hanstholm harbour.

==In literature==
===Limgrim legend===
According to myth, a woman (in some versions a &quot;jötunn&quot;) gave birth to a pig, Limgrim, which soon grew so big that its bristles could be seen over the treetops. It strolled around and dug channels in the ground. One day it reached the sea and water broke in. This would have been at the eastern inlet of the Limfjord, at Hals. The legend is also handed down in a medieval ballad with a Christian tint. In the ballad, the pig is summoned to a Thing by peasants to pay for the damage to their crops, and it is sentenced to the breaking wheel.

The state environmental surveillance vessel &quot;Limgrim&quot;, based at Skive, is named after the legend.

===Limfjord poets===
A number of writers of the Modern Breakthrough period (1870-1890) and the next decades came from the area around the Limfjord and often used it as a lyrical motif, or a setting for their prose. These include Jens Peter Jacobsen of Thisted, Johan Skjoldborg of Hannæs, Jakob Knudsen of Aggersborg, Jeppe Aakjær and Marie Bregendahl of Fjends, Nobel Prize laureate Johannes Vilhelm Jensen of Farsø and his sister Thit Jensen. Thøger Larsen of Lemvig belonged to the symbolism of the 1920s. Johannes Buchholtz in Struer was a prose writer and his home was a meeting point for many of the Limfjord writers. The house is still kept up by the Struer Museum, which allows visitors. Jeppe Aakjær&#x27;s farm Jenle close to Skive, Johan Skjoldborg&#x27;s house in Øsløs, and the Johannes V. Jensen Museum in Farsø are also open to the public. Erik Bertelsen of Harboør is best known for the song &quot;Blæsten går frisk over Limfjordens vande&quot; (&#x27;The Wind Goes Fresh over the Limfjord&#x27;s Waters&#x27;), a much-used &quot;local anthem&quot;.

The later ones of these Limfjord writers, along with a few others, formed the Jutland Movement, which revolted against the symbolism of the early 20th century. Instead, they wrote social realistic prose, often about poor and exploited people in the countryside, who were a part of Danish society little known to the establishment in Copenhagen.

==Biology and climate==
The western breakthrough of 1825 changed the waters of the Limfjord from brackish to salty, with a considerable current from west to east. Hypoxia sometimes occurs due to warm windless periods in summer or ice in winter.

The fjord today has oceanic salinity, approximately 30 PSU (or per mille by weight) at all depths. Many animals and maritime plants that can be found in Skagerrak, Kattegat and the North Sea can thus be found in the fjord.

Due to its shallow waters, the temperature rises rather quickly during warm and sunny days from mid-April to early September. While in winter, ice can form faster during the cold periods, especially in bays with little current. Problematic ice conditions do not occur every winter.

The Limfjord is notable for its tasty mussels (&quot;Mytilus edulis&quot;). Gourmets appreciate its oysters, which are considered to be of extraordinary size and quality. Had it not been for 
the western breakthrough in 1825, these mussels wouldn&#x27;t grow as well as they do in the waters with ocean-like salinity.

<text>The Pitts Special (company designations S-1 and S-2) is a series of light aerobatic biplanes designed by Curtis Pitts. It has accumulated many competition wins since its first flight in 1944. The Pitts biplanes dominated world aerobatic competition in the 1960s and 1970s and, even today, remain potent competition aircraft in the lower categories.

==Design and development==
Curtis Pitts began the design of a single-seat aerobatic biplane in 1943–1944. The design has been refined continuously since the prototype first flew in September 1944; however, the current Pitts S-2 still remains quite close to the original in concept and in design.

Several of the aircraft that Curtis Pitts built had a picture of a skunk on them and were called &quot;Stinkers&quot;. After she bought it, aerobatic performer Betty Skelton called the second aircraft that Curtis built, &quot;Little Stinker&quot;. The prototype S-2, which was the first two-seat Pitts, was &quot;Big Stinker&quot;, the prototype Model 11 (later called S-1-11B) was &quot;Super Stinker&quot;, and the prototype Model 12 was the &quot;Macho Stinker&quot;.

In 1962 Curtis Pitts set up Pitts Enterprises to sell plans of the S-1C to homebuilders.

===Current versions===
Certified versions of the Pitts are now produced by Aviat Aircraft in Afton, Wyoming. It is available as the S-1 single-seater with an up to 200 hp (150 kW) flat-4 Lycoming engine and a 17 ft 4 in (5.28 m) wingspan, or as the S-2 two-seater variant featuring a 260 hp (194 kW) flat-6 Lycoming and a 20 ft (6.1 m) wingspan. Pitts Specials have been equipped with engines of up to 450 hp (338 kW).

Plans for the single-seat Pitts S-1S are also available from Aviat Aircraft. The S-1C and derivative S-1SS plans and kits are supplied by Steen Aero Lab in Palm Bay, Florida. Many hundreds of homebuilders have successfully completed and flown the Pitts since plans became available in 1960.

==Operational history==
All single-seat (S-1) and two-seat (S-2) Pitts Specials are variations of the basic design from 1944.

The aircraft was popularized by Betty Skelton, Caro Bayley, and other air show performers, which led to the offering of plans in 1962.

Pitts produced limited numbers of aircraft during the 1940s and 1950s. The Pitts Special became the standard by which all other aerobatic aircraft were judged. After a number of homebuilt aircraft were produced from rough hand-drawn plans produced by Pitts, more professionally drawn plans went on sale in 1962. While many homebuilt aircraft were built in the 1960s, earning the S-1 a reputation as an excellent aerobatic aircraft, Pitts worked on the design of a two-seat aerobatic trainer version, the S-2, which first flew in 1967 and gained its type certificate in 1971. Factory-built aircraft produced by the Aerotek company at Afton, Wyoming were joined in production by the single-seat S-1S in 1973.

In 1972, the US Aerobatic Team won the World Championships flying only Pitts biplanes.

In 1977 Curtis Pitts sold his interests in the Pitts S-1 and S-2 to Doyle Child. Child later sold the rights in 1981 to Frank Christensen, who continued production at the Afton plant under the guise of Christen Industries. The rights for homebuilt versions of the Pitts were sold in 1994 to Steen Aero Lab, with the Afton factory and production rights being transferred to Aviat.
Curtis Pitts died in 2005 at age 89. At the time of his death, he was working with Steen on the prototype of the new Pitts Model 14, a brand new, two-seat biplane designed for unlimited aerobatics powered by the 400 horsepower Vedeneyev M14P radial engine. The rights to the Pitts name is currently owned by Aviat which also owns the similar model to the Pitts in the Christen Eagle.

The current inverted flat spin world record is 98 set on March 20, 2016 by air show performer Spencer Suderman over Yuma, Arizona. Suderman flew the Sunbird S-1x, a Lycoming IO-540-powered experimental variant of the Pitts S1. The maneuver began from 24,500&#x27; over the Yuma Proving Grounds and was recovered at 2,000&#x27; AGL. The previous world record for the number of consecutive turns in a flat spin was 81 also set by Spencer Suderman on March 13, 2014 in a Pitts S-2B from 23,000 ft altitude over the Naval Air Facility El Centro.

<doc id="1026826" wikidata="Q189535" url="?curid=1026826" title="Roberto Ayala">
<text>Roberto Fabián Ayala (; born 14 April 1973), nicknamed &quot;El Ratón&quot; (&quot;The Mouse&quot;), is an Argentine former footballer who played as a centre back for the Argentina national football team, as well as Valencia and Real Zaragoza in Spain, Milan and Napoli in Italy, and Ferro Carril, River Plate and Racing Club in his native Argentina.

Regarded as one of the best central defenders of his generation, he stood out for his leadership and ability in the air throughout his career in spite of his small stature as a centre back. Ayala captained Argentina in a record 63 matches. He played in three FIFA World Cups and made a total of 115 international appearances, behind only Javier Mascherano, Javier Zanetti and Lionel Messi in terms of international appearances.

== Club career ==

=== Early career in Argentina ===
Ayala began his career in his native Argentina, playing for Ferro Carril Oeste. After three seasons, he moved to River Plate where his good form attracted the attention of clubs in Europe.

=== Move to Europe ===

==== Parma, Napoli and Milan ====
Italian side Parma brought the Argentine defender to Europe. However, the club, having already used their quota of three non-EU players, loaned him to Napoli, who purchased 50% of his rights on a co-ownership deal. Ayala was bought by Milan at the end of the 1997–98 season and played there for two seasons until Valencia purchased him for £6.25 million.

==== Valencia ====
After signing with Valencia in the summer of 2000, Ayala made 275 appearances during a seven-year spell at the club.

On 24 September 2000, Ayala made his debut for Valencia in a 3–0 La Liga win over Numancia. He soon established himself as a first choice central defender for &quot;Los Che&quot; and started alongside compatriot Mauricio Pellegrino in the 2001 UEFA Champions League final, where Valencia lost 5–4 to Bayern Munich after a penalty shootout. He was later named best defender for the 2000–01 tournament.

The following season, Ayala was part of the Valencia team that won the 2001–02 La Liga title. He scored the opening goal of a 2–0 defeat of Málaga which secured the championship on 5 May 2002. In 2003–04, Valencia again won the La Liga title and beat Marseille 2–0 in Gothenburg to win the UEFA Cup.

During the 2004–05 season, injuries kept Ayala from much of the La Liga campaign as well as the UEFA Super Cup victory over Porto.

During his time with Valencia, he was widely regarded as one of the finest central defenders in the world and is considered to be one of the club&#x27;s all-time legends.

==== Villarreal and Real Zaragoza ====
In August 2006, Ayala was not offered a new contract by sporting director Amedeo Carboni. On 7 February 2007, he announced he would join regional rivals Villarreal at the end of the season, however before having played for Villarreal, he joined Real Zaragoza on a three-year deal on 14 July 2007. The buy-out clause in his contract with Villarreal was €6 million (£4.8 million) which was paid in full by Real Zaragoza.

On 3 May 2008, Ayala scored his first goal for Real Zaragoza in the 94th minute against Deportivo de La Coruña to lead Zaragoza to a 1–0 victory. Zaragoza, however, were relegated to the Segunda División. On 22 November 2008, Ayala scored his second goal for Zaragoza, in the 73rd of a 3–0 win over Eibar. On 29 February 2009, he scored his third goal coming in the 54th minute against Real Murcia as Zaragoza won the match 4–1.

In January 2010, Ayala&#x27;s contract with Zaragoza was terminated by mutual consent.

=== Racing Avellaneda ===
On 2 February 2010, Argentine side Racing Club signed Ayala on a free transfer.

== International career ==
Ayala made his debut for Argentina on 16 November 1994 against Chile under coach Daniel Passarella.

Ayala played for Argentina U23 at the 1996 Summer Olympics, winning the silver medal. He played for Argentina in the 1998 FIFA World Cup and was a non-playing squad member in the 2002 competition due to a last-minute injury moments before their first match against Nigeria. He was selected as one of the three overage players then Argentina U23 won the gold medal at the 2004 Summer Olympics. Ayala played an integral part in the Argentine squad for the 2006 World Cup in Germany. He played brilliantly throughout the tournament and was picked as a member of the All Star Team. In the quarter-final against Germany, he scored a header that gave Argentina the 1–0 lead, although his side lost the penalty shootout after a 1–1 draw, with Ayala&#x27;s spot kick being saved by Jens Lehmann.

On 30 May 2006, In a friendly match against Angola, Ayala earned his 100th cap for Argentina.
One of the best defenders in Argentina&#x27;s history, on 7 February 2007 Ayala became the most capped player of the national team (most as captain), beating his friend Diego Simeone, in a friendly victory 1–0 against France played in the Stade de France in Paris.

On 5 June 2007, in a friendly against Algeria, Ayala captained Argentina for a record 58th international, having equalled Diego Maradona&#x27;s mark of 57 in the 1–1 draw against Switzerland in Basel on 2 June.

On 17 July 2007, two days after playing in the 2007 Copa América Final, which ended in a 3–0 defeat to Brazil, and during which he scored an own goal, Ayala announced his retirement from international football. Ayala stated, &quot;it has nothing to do with what happened in the final of the Copa América.&quot; Javier Zanetti took over from him as captain.

<doc id="1026832" wikidata="Q210118" url="?curid=1026832" title="Gulf of Lion">
<text>The Gulf of Lion or Gulf of Lions is a wide embayment of the Mediterranean coastline of Catalonia in Spain with Languedoc-Roussillon and Provence in France, extending from Begur in the west to Toulon in the east.

The chief port on the gulf is Marseille. Toulon is another important port. The fishing industry in the gulf is based on hake (&quot;Merluccius merluccius&quot;), being bottom-trawled, long-lined and gill-netted and currently declining from overfishing.

Rivers that empty into the gulf include the Tech, Têt, Aude, Orb, Hérault, Vidourle, and the Rhône.

The continental shelf is exposed here as a wide coastal plain, and the offshore terrain slopes rapidly to the Mediterranean&#x27;s abyssal plain. Much of the coastline is composed of lagoons and salt marsh.

This is the area of the cold, blustery winds called the Mistral and the Tramontane.

== Etymology ==
The current name of the gulf appeared at least during the 13th century (in medieval Latin &quot;sinus Leonis&quot;, &quot;mare Leonis&quot;) and could come from comparison with a lion: it would simply suggest that this part of the sea is as dangerous as a lion because it has very violent, surprising winds that threaten boats (sailors and fishermen know these dangers very well). This comparison with a lion is suggested by various converging sources: Deroy and Mulon&#x27;s dictionary of French place names, Mistral&#x27;s comprehensive Occitan dictionary, Diderot and D&#x27;Alembert&#x27;s famous French encyclopedia and several texts in Latin since the 13th century.

These sources, especially Deroy and Mulon, Diderot and D&#x27;Alembert, reject the hypothesis according to which the name would be related to the city of Lyon, since it is too far from the gulf.

A former name in classical Latin during Roman antiquity was &quot;sinus Gallicus&quot; (that is, &quot;Gallic gulf&quot;).

== Geodynamics ==
The Gulf of Lion is not a simple passive continental margin; it results from Oligocene-Miocene anti-clockwise rotation of the Corsican-Sardinian Block against the European Craton. This extension rejuvenated a very complex tectonic framework inherited from the Tethyan evolution and the Pyrenean orogeny. The Eocene mountain-building event that built the Pyrenees compressed and thickened the entire crust. Oil geologists predict that there will be considerable oil deposits at the seaward margins of the gulf.

== Ocean dynamics ==
The gulf&#x27;s bottom topography, the Mistral, extended cold weather, and evaporation combine to create a sinking of surface waters which forms the Levantine Intermediate Water of the Mediterranean Sea.

==Marine ecology==
The Gulf of Lion is notable, according to C. Michael Hogan, for occurrences of biodiversity associated with the reef building organism &quot;Lophelia pertusa&quot;.

A wind park is planned

<doc id="1026834" wikidata="Q1753233" url="?curid=1026834" title="Midian (album)">
<text>Midian is the fourth studio album by English extreme metal band Cradle of Filth. It was released on 30 October 2000 through Music for Nations. The album marks the return of guitarist Paul Allender to the band, as well as the introduction of drummer Adrian Erlandsson (At the Gates, The Haunted) and keyboard player Martin Powell (My Dying Bride, Anathema). It also features Doug Bradley (&quot;Hellraiser, &quot;) as the narrator for various songs.

==Thematic inspiration==
&quot;Midian&quot; is inspired by English author Clive Barker&#x27;s novel &quot;Cabal&quot; and his subsequent film version &quot;Nightbreed&quot;. Dani Filth explained to the magazine &quot;Empire&quot; in September 2012:

We loved &quot;Cabal&quot;, &quot;The Damnation Game&quot; and &quot;The Books of Blood&quot;, and we liked that everything had &quot;Clive Barker presents...&quot; on it before people even knew who he was. That gave it an air of mystery: you should know who this is, but you don&#x27;t. &quot;Midian&quot; kind of is and isn&#x27;t a concept album: as a title, it just made perfect sense. The central song, &quot;Tortured Soul Asylum&quot;, is about Midian, and the characters in the rest [of the album] made up a sort of collective from this mythical place where the monsters live.

Doug Bradley, who played the role of Lylesberg in &quot;Nightbreed&quot; (but is better known as Pinhead from Barker&#x27;s &quot;Hellraiser&quot; and its sequels), provides narration on some tracks.

In the Bible, the &quot;Midianites&quot; are an Arab tribe descended from Abraham, and Midian itself is where Moses spent his forty-year exile from Egypt. The biblical Midianites take their name from Midian, a son of Abraham, and one of his concubines. Today, the former territory of Midian is found through small portions of western Saudi Arabia, southern Jordan, southern Israel and the Sinai. The people of Midian are also mentioned extensively in the Qur&#x27;an, where the name appears in Arabic as Madyan. The Midian of &quot;Cabal&quot; and &quot;Nightbreed&quot; is a hidden city west of Calgary in Alberta, Canada, offering shelter for monsters away from humanity.

The song &quot;Cthulhu Dawn&quot; invokes the character from horror writer H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s Cthulhu Mythos.

The opening line of &quot;Lord Abortion&quot; (&quot;Care for a little necrophilia?&quot;) is a quote from Terry Gilliam&#x27;s film &quot;Brazil&quot; (voiced by Kim Greist in the film, but delivered here by Toni King, frontman Dani Filth&#x27;s wife).

== Release ==

&quot;Midian&quot; was released on 30 October 2000 by record label Music for Nations. It reached number 63 in the UK Albums Chart. The cover was by the artist J.K. Potter. It was subsequently also used as the jacket for Potter&#x27;s 2002 horror fiction anthology &quot;Embrace the Mutation&quot;.

&quot;Her Ghost in the Fog&quot; spawned a music video, which received heavy rotation on MTV2 and other rock channels, and was directed by Alex Chandon (who also directed the 2001 horror film &quot;Cradle of Fear&quot; in which Dani Filth appeared). &quot;Her Ghost in the Fog&quot; appeared on the soundtrack for &quot;Ginger Snaps&quot; in 2000 and in the video game &quot;Brütal Legend&quot; in 2009.

The album was reissued in 2012 by The End.

== Critical reception ==

&quot;NME&quot; called it &quot;one of the most ludicrous records you&#x27;ll ever hear&quot;, though their review was favourable. In 2020, it was named one of the 20 best metal albums of 2000 by &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; magazine.
