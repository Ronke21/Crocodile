<text>Silicon Knights was a Canadian video game developer. Founded in 1992 by Denis Dyack, the company was headquartered in St. Catharines, Ontario. They started developing for computers such as the Atari ST and IBM PC compatibles. After 1996, they moved to console titles.

Dyack left Silicon Knights to form a new game studio, Precursor Games, after the loss of a court case against Epic Games over the game engine Unreal Engine 3. Epic Games won the case and a counter-suit for $4.45 million on grounds of copyright infringement, misappropriation of trade secrets, and breach of contract. Following the case, Silicon Knights filed for bankruptcy on May 16, 2014.

==Games==
===Released===
Silicon Knights&#x27; first games were real-time strategy/action hybrids for computers. Silicon Knights&#x27; last PC game, &quot;Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain&quot; was published in 1996. Since that time, Silicon Knights moved from creating PC games to console titles. In 2000, Silicon Knights was signed by Nintendo to create games exclusively for its consoles, during which time it produced &quot;Eternal Darkness: Sanity&#x27;s Requiem&quot;. Together with Nintendo, Silicon Knights worked with Konami to create &quot;Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes&quot;. In 2004, the company ended exclusivity with Nintendo. In 2005, it partnered with publisher Microsoft Game Studios for &quot;Too Human&quot;, though Nintendo still owned stock in the company. In 2008, the company released &quot;Too Human&quot;, which was published by Microsoft for the Xbox 360. The final game developed by the company, &quot;X-Men: Destiny&quot;, was released in September 2011 for multiple console platforms.

===Canceled===
Canceled games included &quot;Silent Hill: The Box&quot; (later known as just &quot;The Box&quot; and &quot;The Ritualyst&quot;), &quot;Too Human 2&quot; (&quot;Too Human: Rise of the Giants&quot;), &quot;Too Human 3&quot;, &quot;Eternal Darkness 2&quot;, and the little-known projects &quot;Siren in the Maelstrom&quot;, &quot;The Sandman&quot; and &quot;King&#x27;s Quest&quot;.

==Founding of Eight==
Silicon Knights was a strong proponent of collaboration with academia and was a key player in the formation of Eight. Eight: The Hamilton Institute for Interactive Digital Media is a collaboration between Silicon Knights, McMaster University, the Art Gallery of Hamilton (AGH) and Mohawk College to create a novel academic and research model around interactive digital media and will help pioneer and shape cutting-edge advances in the interactive entertainment arena.

==Lawsuit with Epic Games==
On July 19, 2007, Silicon Knights sued Epic Games for failure to &quot;provide a working game engine&quot;, causing the Ontario-based game developer to &quot;experience considerable losses.&quot; The suit alleged that Epic Games was &quot;sabotaging&quot; Unreal Engine 3 licensees. Epic&#x27;s licensing document stated that a working version of the engine would be available within six months of the Xbox 360 developer kits being released. Silicon Knights claimed that Epic not only missed this deadline, but that when a working version of the engine was eventually released, the documentation was insufficient. The game studio also claimed Epic had withheld vital improvements to the game engine, claiming they were &quot;game specific&quot;, while also using licensing fees to fund development of its own titles rather than the engine itself.

In August 2007, Epic Games counter-sued Silicon Knights, alleging the studio was aware when it signed on that certain features of Unreal Engine 3 were still in development and that components would continue to be developed and added as Epic completed work on &quot;Gears of War&quot;. Therefore, in a statement, Epic said that &quot;SK knew when it committed to the licensing agreement that Unreal Engine 3 may not meet its requirements and may not be modified to meet them.&quot; Additionally, the counter-suit claimed that Silicon Knights had &quot;made unauthorized use of Epic&#x27;s Licensed Technology&quot; and had &quot;infringed and otherwise violated Epic&#x27;s intellectual property rights, including Epic&#x27;s copyrighted works, trade secrets, know how and confidential information&quot; by incorporating Unreal Engine 3 code into its own engine. Furthermore, Epic claimed the Canadian developer broke the contract by employing this derivative work in an internal title and a second game with Sega, a partnership for which it never received a license fee.

On May 30, 2012, Epic Games prevailed against Silicon Knights&#x27; lawsuit, and won its counter-suit for $4.45 million on grounds of copyright infringement, misappropriation of trade secrets, and breach of contract, an injury award that was later doubled due to prejudgment interest, attorneys&#x27; fees and costs. Consistent with Epic&#x27;s counterclaims, the presiding judge, James C. Dever III, stated that Silicon Knights had &quot;deliberately and repeatedly copied thousands of lines of Epic Games&#x27; copyrighted code, and then attempted to conceal its wrongdoing by removing Epic Games&#x27; copyright notices and by disguising Epic Games&#x27; copyrighted code as Silicon Knights&#x27; own.&quot; Evidence against Silicon Knights was &quot;overwhelming&quot;, said Dever, as it not only copied functional code but also &quot;non-functional, internal comments Epic Games&#x27; programmers had left for themselves.&quot;

As a result, on November 7, 2012, Silicon Knights was directed by the court to destroy all game code derived from Unreal Engine 3 and all information from licensee-restricted areas of Epic&#x27;s Unreal Engine documentation website, and to permit Epic Games access to the company&#x27;s servers and other devices to ensure these items had been removed. In addition, the studio was instructed to recall and destroy all unsold retail copies of games built with Unreal Engine 3 code, including &quot;Too Human&quot;, &quot;X-Men Destiny&quot;, &quot;The Sandman&quot;, &quot;The Box&quot;/&quot;Ritualyst&quot;, and &quot;Siren in the Maelstrom&quot; (the latter three titles were projects never released, or even officially announced).

Talking to IGN in 2019, Dyack expressed regrets over the lawsuit not just because of the loss but also the fact he underestimated the amount of time it took to settle the litigation. Had he known then, Dyack said he would have reconsidered pursuing the lawsuit.

==Government funding==
===Provincial===
In February 2008, Silicon Knights was granted $500 thousand by the Ontario Media Development Corporation (OMDC) through its Video Game Prototype Initiative. Using this funding, they were to create a prototype for a &quot;third-person action/psychological thriller&quot;.

===Federal===
In April 2010, it was announced that the company would receive nearly $4 million through the Canadian government&#x27;s Community Adjustment Fund. The purpose of the loan was to allow the hiring of 65 new staff members, who would be working on a new game targeting multiple platforms. The game was estimated to take two to five years to complete.

===Provincial===
In July 2011, Silicon Knights was awarded $2.5 million to be distributed over five years in provincial funding to improve its technology, create new products and become a self-publishing company. The investment would supposedly have allowed the company to improve its technology, hire 80 new people while keeping 97 current jobs and allow the company to become &quot;self sustaining.&quot; As of November 2011, Silicon Knights had not received any of this funding.

==Filing for bankruptcy==
On May 16, 2014, following the loss of the court case, Silicon Knights filed for bankruptcy and a Certificate of Appointment was issued by the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy, with Collins Barrow Toronto Limited being appointed as Trustee in Bankruptcy.

<text>Sátoraljaújhely (German: &quot;Neustadt am Zeltberg&quot;; Slovak: &quot;Nové Mesto pod Šiatrom;&quot; Yiddish: &quot;איהעל&quot;) is a border town located in Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén County, Hungary. It serves as the center of the Sátoraljaújhely District and microregion. The town is renowned for its wine region and, since 2002, has been part of the Tokaj-Hegyalja Historic Wine Region Cultural Landscape, a UNESCO World Heritage site. Sátoraljaújhely is often referred to as the &quot;Capital of Zemplén&quot; due to its history as the former seat of Zemplén County and as the largest settlement in the Hegyalja region. The town was split by the new border established by the Treaty of Trianon, with the ceded suburb now located in Slovakia, known as Slovenské Nové Mesto.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Sátoraljaújhely&quot; is composed of four Hungarian words: &quot;sátor,&quot; meaning &quot;tent&quot; but referring to Sátor Hill. The mountain resembles the shape of a tent, which is why it was given this name; &quot;alja,&quot; meaning &quot;bottom of something&quot;,&quot; indicating the town&#x27;s position at the base of the hill; &quot;új,&quot; meaning &quot;new&quot;; and &quot;hely,&quot; meaning &quot;place&quot; or &quot;location.&quot; Thus, &quot;Sátoraljaújhely&quot; translates to &quot;tent&#x27;s-bottom-new-place&quot; or &quot;New Place at the Bottom of Sátor Hill&quot;. 

The earliest known name of the town was &quot;Sátorelő&quot;, where the suffix &quot;-elő&quot; means &quot;in front of,&quot; indicating that the name referred to a settlement located at the foot of Sátor Hill. According to a local legend, this original settlement was destroyed during the Mongol invasion of 1241, and the survivors established a new town, which they named &quot;Sátoraljaújhely&quot;. While it is likely that the Mongol hordes reached the area, there is no evidence to support the destruction of an earlier settlement. Furthermore, the town continued to be referred to as &quot;Sátorelő&quot; even after the Mongol invasion. The name change to &quot;Sátoraljaújhely&quot; occurred later, following a charter issued by King Stephen V in 1261, which granted privileges that accelerated the town&#x27;s development and attracted settlers (latin: &quot;hospes&quot;). The town is first mentioned as &quot;Sátoralja Újhely&quot; (&quot;Saturalia Wyhel&quot;) in a charter issued by King Ladislaus IV in 1282. The &quot;Újhely&quot; (&quot;New Place&quot;) designation refers to the settlers invited by the king and the recently founded town.

== Demographics ==
According to the 2001 census, Sátoraljaújhely had a population of 18,335. Of these, 93% identified as Hungarian, 6% as Roma, and 1% as Slovak. A small community of ethnic Germans resides in the Károlyfalva district of the town.

In the 2011 census, the town&#x27;s population was recorded at 15,655. Among them, 88.6% identified as Hungarian, 12.3% as Roma, 1.6% as Slovak, 1.1% as German, with smaller percentages identifying as Romanian, Ukrainian, and other nationalities. Regarding religious affiliation, 32.1% were Roman Catholic, 19.4% Reformed, 11.9% Greek Catholic, while 12.1% declared themselves non-religious (22.5% did not declare a religious affiliation).

As of 2022, the population was 13,274. Of these, 88.6% identified as Hungarian, 4.3% as Roma, 1.4% as Slovak, with smaller percentages identifying as German, Ukrainian, Bulgarian, Rusyn, and Romanian. In terms of religious affiliation, 27.5% were Roman Catholic, 17.8% Reformed, 10% Greek Catholic, and 6.8% identified as non-religious (35.8% did not declare a religious affiliation).

The historical population of Sátoraljaújhely reached its peak of 22,936 residents in 1920. Following this, a decline occurred, and by 1949, after World War II, the town&#x27;s population had dropped to 17,116. From the 1950s, a period of continuous growth began, with the population increasing to 20,928 by 1980. However, by 1990, this number had decreased to 19,105, followed by a continuous and more significant population decline in subsequent years.

== Transportation ==
Road Network

Sátoraljaújhely is situated very close to the Slovak border, with the main road 37 running through the entire length of the town. Road 381 branches off from road 37, leading to settlements on the Hungarian side of the Bodrogköz region, such as Alsóberecki, Karos, and Cigánd. The town&#x27;s districts of Károlyfalva and Rudabányácska are connected by road 3718, which winds through Kácsárd and around the Magas-hegy via a serpentine route. This route follows the path of the former narrow-gauge railway and reconnects with road 37 in the Torzsás area of the town. Road 3719 leads towards the Hegyköz region, including destinations like Pálháza and Hollóháza. Two border crossings to Slovakia are accessible from Sátoraljaújhely: the Ronyva Bridge along Rákóczi Street, open to pedestrian and passenger vehicle traffic, and a northern border crossing for freight vehicles and trucks.

Bus Transportation

In Sátoraljaújhely, local public transportation is provided by Volánbusz&#x27;s regional routes. The bus station is located directly next to the railway station, from where long-distance buses depart to destinations such as Miskolc, Nyíregyháza, and Debrecen. The station is also the starting point for several regional routes serving the settlements in the Hegyköz and Bodrogköz regions. Local bus services connect the town&#x27;s districts of Rudabányácska, Károlyfalva, and Széphalom. On the opposite side of town, near the central cemetery, there is a bus turnaround, which is another key stop for local transportation.

Taxi Service

The taxi stand is located in the town center at &quot;Táncsics Tér&quot; (Táncsics Squere), where individual entrepreneurs provide taxi services.

Cycling Opportunities

A cycling path has been constructed along the route of the former narrow-gauge railway, which was dismantled in the 1980s, extending from the town to Sárospatak and towards the Hegyköz region. This path is part of the EuroVelo 11 international cycling network. Within the town, sections of the route are marked by dedicated bike lanes, while others are indicated by road markings. On several one-way streets, cyclists are allowed to enter in the opposite direction, as indicated by supplementary signs. In 2021, the town completed the installation of a rentable electric bike system in collaboration with the nearby towns of Viničky and Zemplén. As part of this project, multiple charging stations and rental points were established across the region, facilitating the convenient use and rental of electric bikes between Sátoraljaújhely and neighboring Slovakian towns.

Railway

Sátoraljaújhely railway station is located at the end of the Hatvan–Miskolc–Szerencs–Sátoraljaújhely railway line, with the building designed by the renowned architect Ferenc Pfaff. The railway line was once a double-track main line, but after World War II, it was reduced to a single track due to political and geographical changes. The Mezőzombor–Sátoraljaújhely section was modernized and electrified between 2016 and 2019, allowing trains to travel to Budapest without a locomotive change. Trains depart almost every hour towards Szerencs during the day, with some continuing directly to Budapest via Miskolc, while others have connections to Budapest at Szerencs. Currently, there is no passenger train service towards Slovenské Nové Mesto; this cross-border track is used exclusively for freight traffic. However, from the town center, it is a 15-minute walk to the Slovenské Nové Mesto railway station on the other side of the border, from where direct trains depart towards Košice and Čierna nad Tisou.

Water Transportation

In terms of transportation, the nearby Bodrog River is significant, classified as a class III waterway. Vessels up to 70 meters in length, 8.2 meters in width, and with a draft of up to 2 meters, carrying a maximum load of 1,000 tons, can navigate the river. Although water transportation has been minimal so far, a passenger ferry operates at Felsőberecki. Recently, however, the region has gained importance due to tourism developments. As part of the government&#x27;s &quot;holiday boat project,&quot; a new marina is being constructed above Felsőberecki, near the confluence of the Ronyva and Bodrog Rivers, along with several other locations along the Bodrog, Upper Tisza, and Lake Tisza. There is also a proposal to make the Ronyva navigable from the Bodrog to the inner part of Sátoraljaújhely, but this remains only a suggestion for now.

== Industry ==

The political and economic transition had a significant impact on the industrial sector of Sátoraljaújhely, particularly affecting local manufacturing plants and major employers. Following the dissolution of the Comecon (CMEA) and the Soviet bloc, the town&#x27;s former markets largely disappeared, while new economic opportunities were slow to develop. As a result, several large socialist-era enterprises and cooperatives were either liquidated or closed. Some companies attempted to adapt by adopting new business models, such as establishing joint ventures, while others continued their operations under new names after liquidation or relocated their headquarters to other towns. However, several major employers ceased operations permanently.

In the post-transition period, the economy of Sátoraljaújhely gradually stabilized. New companies established themselves in the town, and existing ones changed ownership. As part of this process, the Sátoraljaújhely Industrial Park was established, which now hosts the town&#x27;s largest industrial facilities. The industrial park includes companies engaged in machinery manufacturing, surface treatment, food processing, and refractory materials production, among others. The town also hosts a significant tobacco processing plant with a history dating back to the 1890s.

== Agriculture ==

As a result of the Treaty of Trianon, a significant portion of the town’s agricultural lands was ceded. The remaining land parcels were transferred to new owners during the post-transition compensation process, where compensation vouchers were exchanged for ownership. State-owned arable lands, particularly vineyards, were privatized during the privatization of the Tokaj-Hegyalja State Agricultural Wine Combine. In 1993, the Wine Combine was transformed into a business entity under the name Tokaj Kereskedőház Zrt., and its headquarters were moved from Sátoraljaújhely to Tolcsva. The vineyards located in the outskirts of the town are protected under the &quot;Tokaj&quot; Protected Designation of Origin (PDO).

== Commerce ==
The structure of commerce in the town underwent significant changes after the political transition. Large shopping centers, international retail chains, and supermarkets established themselves in the outskirts of the town. As a result, the town center partially lost its traditional commercial function. Traditional small retail shops have largely remained on Kazinczy Street and Rákóczi Street, with only a few exceptions. The vegetable market operates on the Market Square three days a week (Tuesday, Friday, Sunday), and an industrial goods market (formerly known as the Comecon market) is located alongside the relief road.

== Tourism ==

Tourism in Sátoraljaújhely has seen significant growth in recent years, particularly in nature-based and active recreation. The surrounding Zemplén Mountains offer a variety of hiking and cycling routes. Magas-hegy is a popular destination with a lookout tower providing panoramic views of the surrounding mountains. One of the town&#x27;s main tourist attractions is the &quot;Zemplén Kalandpark&quot; (Zemplén Adventure Park), home to Hungary&#x27;s longest chairlift, as well as a bobsled track and a climbing wall center. A notable feature of the park is the &quot;Összetartozás Hídja&quot; (Bridge of Unity), a glass and steel suspension bridge, inaugurated in 2024, that connects two mountains and offers scenic views. Sátoraljaújhely is located near the Tokaj wine region, renowned worldwide for its wines. The town and its surroundings regularly host wine cellar events where visitors can explore local wines and wineries. The cultural life of Sátoraljaújhely is vibrant, with regular exhibitions, concerts, and local festivals enriching the community. Accommodations in the area range from guesthouses and hotels to campgrounds and tourist lodges.

== Attractions ==

Sátoraljaújhely&#x27;s central square, &quot;Kossuth tér&quot;, is a defining element of the 19th-century townscape and a significant site in the historic downtown area, known for its wrought-iron balconies. The square is home to the Baroque-style town hall, originally serving as the county hall, which houses archival materials from the 18th and 19th centuries. On the opposite side of the square stands the late Baroque &quot;St. Stephen&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church&quot;, commonly referred to by locals as the &quot;Great Church&quot;. This building, one of the town&#x27;s most important monuments, was constructed on the site of the town&#x27;s original 13th-century church. Adjacent to the church is &quot;Hősök tere&quot; (Heroes&#x27; Square), which features a memorial to the victims of the 1944 Sátoraljaújhely prison uprising. Nearby, the Baroque-style &quot;Waldbott Mansion&quot;, though currently not open to the public, remains an architecturally significant site. 

Another notable religious and historical landmark is the &quot;Pauline-Piarist Church and Monastery&quot; complex, originally built in the 13th century. The church, initially owned by the Pauline Order, was later taken over by the Piarists. Nearby is the &quot;Rákóczi Chapel&quot;, where the hearts of several members of the Rákóczi family are interred. The town is also home to the &quot;Holy Trinity Chapel&quot;, built in 1710 as a votive chapel following a plague outbreak. Sátoraljaújhely is an important pilgrimage site, especially for the Jewish community, due to the tomb of Rebbe Moshe Teitelbaum, located in the old Jewish cemetery. This site attracts pilgrims annually, particularly from abroad.

The town’s winemaking traditions are preserved in the Zsólyomka Cellar Row and the Ungvári Cellars, the latter recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Another unique feature is the world’s only &quot;Wine Church&quot; &quot;(Bortemplom)&quot;, which is currently under renovation. Originally a wine trade center with an extensive network of cellars, it remains a testament to the town&#x27;s rich viticultural history.

The &quot;Magyar Kálvária&quot;, the &quot;100th National Flag Monument&quot;, and the &quot;St. Stephen Chapel&quot; on Szár-hegy form one of the town&#x27;s most important memorial sites, commemorating the impact of the Treaty of Trianon, which severely affected the town. The memorial site also includes the &quot;Centennial Turul Monument&quot;. Nearby, on Várhegy, lie the ruins of &quot;Sátoraljaújhely Castle&quot;. Although the area is currently undergoing archaeological excavation, the remaining walls reflect the significance of the medieval fortress. Among the town&#x27;s natural attractions, the &quot;Magas-hegy Nature Trail&quot; offers visitors an immersive experience in nature, while the &quot;Long-erdő&quot; (Long Forest) nature reserve serves as a protected habitat for local flora and fauna.

== Sports ==

Sátoraljaújhely has a diverse sports scene, with local residents actively participating in various disciplines. The town is home to several gyms offering a range of fitness services and training options for both locals and visitors. Additionally, there is a sports hall and a municipal swimming pool. The town&#x27;s football team, &quot;Sátoraljaújhelyi TKSE&quot;, has a long-standing history and remains an integral part of the local sports community. Regular sporting events are organized in the town, such as the &quot;Kossuth Staféta&quot; running race, which connects Sátoraljaújhely with Sárospatak. The &quot;Zemplén Adventure Park&quot; offers additional opportunities for sports and recreation, including winter sports. During the winter season, the park features three alpine-quality ski slopes maintained by nine snow cannons and snow groomers. The slopes are serviced by four high-speed lifts, and a ski school is available for beginners, along with equipment rental services. The adventure park also boasts a 2,275-meter-long roller bobsled track, a snow tubing slide, and a 1,000-square-meter ice rink. The town is also home to the youth ice hockey team, the &quot;Zempléni Hiúzok&quot; (Lynxes of Zemplén). Sátoraljaújhely is also known for producing two notable BMX world champions: Ádám Kun, who won the world title in Cologne in 2002, and Dénes Katona, who became world champion in Prague in 2005. Both athletes have made significant contributions to the sport and have enriched the town&#x27;s sports history.

== Culture ==
Sátoraljaújhely is a culturally significant town, often referred to as the &quot;capital of Zemplén&quot; and formerly the seat of Zemplén County. The town boasts a rich cultural heritage, with notable figures such as the language reformer Ferenc Kazinczy and the politician Lajos Kossuth having strong connections to the area. It remains one of the cultural centers of the county and is an attractive destination for tourists. The town hosts several cultural institutions, including museums, a theater, and a cinema. The Kazinczy Ferenc Museum offers a variety of collections and exhibitions, including historical, archaeological, and biological displays. The Museum of the Hungarian Language, located in Széphalom, features interactive exhibits that showcase the richness, history, and diversity of the Hungarian language. The Prison Museum, housed in the Sátoraljaújhely Penitentiary and Prison building, provides a comprehensive overview of the history and development of the Hungarian penal system. The museum highlights changes in punishment systems, the daily lives of inmates, and the consequences of criminal behavior, and it also offers educational programs and crime prevention lectures. In the realm of theater and cinema, the Latabár Árpád Theater and the Latabár Cinema offer cultural entertainment for both locals and visitors. These venues regularly host theatrical performances, film screenings, and various events. The pedestrian zone and Event Square, featuring an occasional stage and large screen, is a central venue for the town&#x27;s community and cultural life. Additionally, the Kossuth Lajos Cultural Center plays a significant role in organizing and hosting local cultural programs. The town&#x27;s largest and most popular event is the Déryné Festival, first organized with the aim of establishing a tradition between July 14 and 18, 2021. This five-day festival features a vibrant array of cultural programs, offering audiences a rich selection of musical performances and high-quality theatrical productions, promising engaging entertainment. The festival has found a true home in Sátoraljaújhely, with nearly 70 free programs held across various locations in the area, attracting thousands of visitors each year. In addition to sold-out theater performances, interactive games, concerts, and dance productions also draw significant interest.

In Sátoraljaújhely, &quot;Zemplén TV&quot; serves the local population as a municipal-owned regional public service television station. The station&#x27;s broadcasts reach surrounding regions, including Hegyköz, Bodrogköz, Hegyalja, as well as Hungarian-speaking communities in Eastern Slovakia and Transcarpathia. Since 2013, &quot;Zemplén TV&quot; has broadcast its digital signal on UHF channel 55. Several radio stations are also available in the town and its vicinity, including &quot;Szent István Rádió&quot; (FM 90.6 MHz), &quot;MR1 – Kossuth Rádió&quot; (FM 91.9 MHz), &quot;Európa Rádió&quot; (FM 100.0 MHz), and &quot;Zemplén FM&quot; (FM 104.9 MHz). Local newspapers include &quot;Újhelyi Körkép&quot; and &quot;Helyi Krónika&quot;. Regional press outlets, such as the &quot;Észak-Magyarország&quot; daily, &quot;KULCS&quot; magazine, and &quot;Nexus Zemplén&quot;, also cover local news.

== Institutions ==

Following the political changes after the fall of communism, the administrative system of Sátoraljaújhely underwent significant transformation, with Soviet-style local councils being replaced by local self-government systems. The &quot;Municipality of Sátoraljaújhely&quot; was established, with a directly elected mayor leading the decision-making body, the municipal council. To fulfill its duties, the municipality has founded several institutions and economic entities that contribute to the town&#x27;s operation and development. In the realm of centralized state administration, the regional offices of the county government, the police, fire department, judiciary, prosecution service, and healthcare institutions—such as the &quot;Erzsébet Hospital of Sátoraljaújhely&quot;—continue to play crucial roles in the life of the town. The town&#x27;s educational system is diverse, featuring institutions operated by the state, religious organizations, and foundations. These include primary schools, art schools, vocational schools, and secondary technical schools, all of which provide education for the youth of Sátoraljaújhely and the surrounding areas.

== Notable Figures ==
The town of Sátoraljaújhely is the birthplace of numerous individuals who have played significant roles in Hungarian culture, science, and public life. Throughout its history, the town has produced several painters who excelled in decorating churches and public buildings. The literary world has also been enriched by writers and poets from Sátoraljaújhely, some of whom became prominent figures in Hungarian literature. The town’s medical and scientific traditions are notable as well, with several distinguished doctors, pharmacists, and researchers originating from here, contributing to the development of Hungary&#x27;s healthcare and scientific communities. Additionally, Sátoraljaújhely has a remarkable theatrical tradition, being associated with several renowned actors and directors who left a lasting mark on Hungarian theater. Politically, the town is significant, as it has been home to several public figures and politicians who played important roles in Hungary&#x27;s historical and political events. These individuals have all contributed to making Sátoraljaújhely a well-known name in Hungarian culture and history.

Lajos KossuthLajos Kossuth attended secondary school at the Piarist gymnasium in Sátoraljaújhely, and after completing his legal studies, he returned to the town in 1820. It was here that he gave his first public speech as a law clerk from the balcony of the County Hall (now the Town Hall). During his lifetime, Lajos Kossuth was held in high esteem in Zemplén County and the town. This respect was evident when, on his birthday in 1892, the county assembly named him an honorary citizen. The town erected a statue in honor of Lajos Kossuth, which was unveiled on May 28, 1911, in the Main Square. On the back of the statue’s pedestal, there is an excerpt from a letter Kossuth wrote from Turin: &quot;… I was born in Monok… but my earliest memories are tied to Újhely, with the sweetness of attachment to my homeland. Újhely was the cradle of my childhood… And I am proud to call myself a Hungarian man of Újhely.&quot;

Ferenc Kazinczy

Ferenc Kazinczy settled in the outskirts of Sátoraljaújhely at the age of 42, on his Bányácska estate, which he renamed Széphalom. Széphalom became one of the centers of Hungarian literature in the early 19th century. Until his death, Kazinczy worked at the archives of Zemplén County. During his years in Széphalom, Kazinczy actively participated in the public life of Sátoraljaújhely and even served as the chief elder of the local Reformed Church community for a time. The town played an important role in preserving the Kazinczy legacy and in the establishment of the Kazinczy cult. The Rákóczi Masonic Lodge, founded in 1881, supported the preservation of Kazinczy&#x27;s house and garden. In 1902, the Kazinczy Circle was established in Sátoraljaújhely, with members including civil servants, teachers, clergy, doctors, and educated intellectuals. 

== History ==

=== Before the Hungarian Conquest ===

==== Prehistoric Age ====
Evidence of human activity in the Zemplén Mountains dates back to the Paleolithic and Neolithic periods. Tools made from local materials such as obsidian, jasper, clay, and quartzite confirm that various prehistoric cultures lived in this region. Eastern Hungary, including the area around Sátoraljaújhely, was home to hunter-gatherer groups from the late Paleolithic Gravettian culture. In 2002, remains of a Neolithic settlement were uncovered at Bibérc-tanya, located southwest of today’s Sátoraljaújhely. These finds included pottery fragments and obsidian flakes. Further evidence of early human settlement was discovered in the 1870s along the banks of the Ronyva Creek, in the northern part of the town. This site was inhabited by a community 4,000–5,000 years ago that practiced farming and animal husbandry. The people lived in clay-plastered, partially underground houses, raised cattle, sheep, and pigs, kept dogs, and grew grains. Their tools, crafted primarily from stone, were shaped through polishing and knapping. The painted ceramics and clay figurines discovered in the Sátoraljaújhely area, which may have depicted deities, hold exceptional cultural significance for the region.

==== Antiquity ====
In the Bükk Mountains, large earth forts and fortified settlements were established, while a significant power center emerged in the Upper Tisza region. The discovery of several cemeteries in the Bodrogköz region suggests that the territory was densely inhabited. For two millennia, from the early 3rd millennium BCE to the transition between the 2nd and 1st millennia BCE, the Carpathian Basin was dominated by peoples who crafted bronze tools and weapons. Approximately 3–4 kilometers south of the present-day town, the Bibérc sand dune was inhabited for millennia by a settled community. In 2002, remnants of a settlement belonging to the Bronze Age Ottomány culture were discovered in this area, though no detailed excavations have been conducted. The Várhegy area was also inhabited during this period, yielding Bronze Age ceramic finds. In the 7th–5th centuries BCE, Transylvania and the Great Hungarian Plain were dominated by the Scythians, an Iranian-origin horse-riding pastoralist people. The region of present-day Sátoraljaújhely was situated on the frontier of their empire. In the 3rd century BCE, Celtic tribes settled in the area around present-day town. Their nearest center and fortified settlement were built on the banks of the Bodrog river, near the village of Zemplén. At that time, the region was inhabited by the Anartes tribe, while to their west lay the territory of the Cotini. In the 2nd century CE, an important trade route was established from Aquincum, the capital of the Roman province of Pannonia, passing through Hatvan and leading toward the area of present-day Miskolc, then further northeast along the Bodrog River. Evidence of these intense trade connections includes Roman coins found on the slopes of Várhegy in Sátoraljaújhely. Among these were coins minted by Roman emperors Hadrian and Antoninus Pius. Additional coins linked to military activity were discovered on Sátor-hegy. By the late 4th century, East Germanic tribes such as the Vandals and Gepids, fleeing the advancing Huns, settled in the Zemplén region. At the turn of the century, the Huns themselves arrived in the area. The Huns&#x27; dominance lasted for about 150 years, but after the death of Attila, their empire rapidly collapsed. Following the demise of the Huns, the Gepids established an independent kingdom that lasted for about a century and included the territory of present-day Sátoraljaújhely.

==== Early Middle Ages ====
The Lombards, who controlled Transdanubia, formed an alliance with the Avars, based along the Lower Danube, and together they overthrew the Kingdom of the Gepids. At this time, the area of present-day Sátoraljaújhely came under Lombard rule in 557. However, their dominion was short-lived; due to the growing threat posed by the Avars, the Lombards left the Carpathian Basin and migrated to Northern Italy in 568. After their departure, the Carpathian Basin fell under the control of the Avars, leading to the establishment of the Avar Khaganate in 568. The Avar rule lasted until the early 9th century and encompassed the territory of modern Sátoraljaújhely. During this period, Slavic communities began settling in the area, as evidenced by the remains of several settlements linked to them. Whether the Avars survived to witness the arrival of the Hungarians remains a topic of debate among historians. In 1899 an excavation east of the Roman Catholic parish church in Sátoraljaújhely uncovered a grave containing human and horse bones, likely dating back to the Avar period. This type of horse burial was characteristic of the steppe peoples, supporting the idea that Avars once inhabited the region. Nearby, in the vicinity of Alsóberecki, remains of a 9th-century Avar settlement were also discovered in the late 19th century. Traces of a late Avar-era settlement, potentially Slavic or Avar, were unearthed in 2014 in an area known as Ortói-dűlő, further confirming the historical significance of the region prior to the Hungarian conquest.

=== From the Hungarian Conquest to the Battle of Mohács (895–1526) ===

==== Unknown Centuries (9th–12th Centuries) ====

No written records exist regarding the settlement of Sátoraljaújhely prior to 1261. Anonymus mentions the surrounding area in his &quot;Gesta Hungarorum&quot;, but only refers to the hill or group of hills called Sátorhalma (today known as Sátor-hegy) and the Ronyva stream and Bodrog river, without mentioning any settlement. According to the work, this region was granted to Ketel by Grand Prince Árpád:

The discovery of significant leader graves from the period of the Hungarian Conquest in the surrounding area—such as in the nearby Karos cemetery—suggests that this region likely served as an early residence for the ruling elite.

==== The Founding of the town (1261) ====
The early history of Sátoraljaújhely is uncertain, and the circumstances of its founding remain unclear. No authentic written records from the 11th–12th centuries directly reference the area of present-day Sátoraljaújhely; such records only appear in greater numbers from the 14th century onward. Additionally, no archaeological excavations of the town&#x27;s core or surrounding areas have been conducted, further complicating efforts to reconstruct its early history. The official founding year of Sátoraljaújhely is considered to be 1261, when Prince Stephen (later King Stephen V) granted privileges to the inhabitants of the settlement then known as Sátorelő. As a prince, Stephen sought to advance the development of villages and towns within his domain. In 1261, he granted Sátorelő the status of a town and the accompanying privileges, including economic, administrative, and trade rights, which significantly encouraged settlement and urban development. It is unclear whether buildings already existed on the territory of the modern town before the granting of privileges, or if construction began only afterward. While it is possible that some structures were present, the privileges attracted settlers (&quot;hospites&quot;), leading later documents to describe the settlement as if it were a newly founded town. For this reason, some historians, such as István Tringli, regard the charter of privileges as an act of foundation. Following the royal settlement effort, the town&#x27;s name also changed. A charter issued by King Ladislaus IV in 1282 referred to the settlement as &quot;Sátoralja Újhely&quot; (&quot;Saturalia Wyhel&quot;). The ethnic background of the settlers is subject to speculation. As with nearby settlements such as Bodrogolaszi, Olaszliszka or Tállya, the settlers may have included Walloons or Germans from Western Europe, though no evidence supports this. From 1307, records mention several citizens of Sátoraljaújhely by name. Many of the names documented from the early 14th century are Latinized versions of given names, which do not provide clear clues about the individuals’ ethnic backgrounds. However, these names align with the naming customs typical of medieval Hungary. They do not specifically point to Walloon or German origins, and their bearers could have been Hungarian, Slavic (including Slovaks or Poles), German, or Walloon. Over time, most family names recorded in the area took on a Hungarian form, indicating that a significant portion of the population was likely Hungarian from the town&#x27;s establishment onward. Among the names from the early 14th century, two suggest a possible Slavic background: Sidlik and Ivan Tót, both of whom may have been Slovak. The occasional appearance of non-Hungarian names implies some diversity, but evidence suggests that Hungarians formed the majority of the population well into the late Middle Ages. This is further supported by a 1475 document listing several men from Sátoraljaújhely, most of whom bore Hungarian names.

===== The Content of the Charter of Privileges =====
The 1261 charter of privileges for Sátoraljaújhely established numerous rights and obligations for the town&#x27;s residents. According to the charter, the inhabitants were required to pay land tax on St. Stephen&#x27;s Day, equivalent to the value of two &quot;pondus&quot; (4.87 grams) of silver. In judicial matters, the Count of Sárospatak had no authority over them; minor cases were adjudicated by their own judge, while major cases fell under the king’s jurisdiction. The residents were granted free fishing rights on the River Bodrog, which had previously been reserved for the lord of Sárospatak. Regarding inheritance rights, settlers without heirs could freely dispose of their property. Additionally, they were allowed to hold toll-free markets on Mondays, and free individuals could settle in the town without restrictions. The residents had the right to elect a new judge annually and to freely choose their priest. They also enjoyed customs exemptions across the surrounding seven counties and, in times of danger, could seek refuge in the fortress on Sátor-hegy, where the Castellan (fortress commander) held judicial authority over them. Furthermore, they were allowed to send envoys directly to the king.

Alongside these privileges, the residents also had obligations. They were required to pay tithes, as did the &quot;hospites&quot; of Sárospatak. If they failed to build on their plots within a year, they risked losing them. The community was collectively responsible for maintaining the cistern&#x27;s water supply in the fortress and was required to participate in local judicial processes. They were obligated to perform military service for the defense of the town and fortress and were also required to host the king if he visited.

==== Royal Estate and Internal Conflicts (13th Century) ====

In the second half of the 13th century, Sátoraljaújhely&#x27;s economic significance grew steadily, particularly due to viticulture and winemaking, which became the town&#x27;s primary source of income. While the first charter of privileges did not mention viticulture, numerous references to it appear in records from the 14th century. The fortress was likely built initially for defense against the Mongols, although the first major military conflict affecting the area occurred in 1264. That year, a civil war broke out between King Béla IV and his son, Prince Stephen, resulting in significant battles in the surrounding region. In 1281 or 1282, another conflict reached the area when Finta, a member of the clan of Aba, rebelled against King Ladislaus IV. The king spent a month in the castle of Sátoraljaújhely during the uprising. Later, in 1285, the Mongols invaded Hungary again, causing devastation in the region. However, it is unclear whether Sátoraljaújhely was directly affected by this event. Throughout this period, Sátoraljaújhely remained part of the Patak Forest Lordship, which was under the direct control of the Árpád dynasty.

==== The Era of the Provincial Lords (14th Century) ====
The extinction of the Árpád dynasty in 1301 significantly impacted the history of Sátoraljaújhely. In 1312, intense battles unfolded in the region when the sons of Amadeus Aba rebelled against King Charles I, launching attacks on the Patak Forest Lordship and the king’s supporters. The rebellion was crushed by the king on June 15 at the Battle of Rozgony. A few years later, in late 1314 or early 1315, the king faced another rebellion. The sons of Palatine Stephen from the clan Ákos, supported by the forces of Matthew III Csák, burned Sárospatak. At the end of 1316, Peter, son of Petenye and lord of Zemplén, also rebelled against the king, although little is known about the events of this uprising. The conflicts between 1312 and 1316 likely affected Sátoraljaújhely, though there is no direct evidence in contemporary sources. Under the Árpád dynasty, the Patak Forest Lordship—and with it Sátoraljaújhely—remained under royal authority. However, during the reign of Charles I, the town was granted away twice: first during the conflicts of the 1310s, and again around 1327. As a result, according to the Hungarian medieval legal norms, the town&#x27;s charter of privileges became invalid, as the rights it conferred could only be exercised under direct royal rule.

==== The Beginning of the Perényi and Pálóci Families&#x27; Rule (15th Century) ====
In 1390, Nicholas Perényi, Ban of Severin, requested the Patak lordship from King Sigismund. While the king issued a charter granting the estate, Perényi did not gain ownership because Queen Mary, who held the estate, refused to consent to the donation. However, in 1392, King Sigismund exchanged the estate with Perényi, granting him Sárospatak and its dependencies. This donation did not entirely remove the estate from royal jurisdiction, as the king retained the right to reclaim it or grant it to another vassal. Ownership often remained temporary, especially if the noble family holding it died out or fell out of royal favor. Following Nicholas Perényi’s death in 1428 without heirs, Sátoraljaújhely and the Patak Forest Lordship reverted to the crown. In 1429, King Sigismund granted the Patak lordship to the Pálóci brothers: George, Archbishop of Esztergom; Mátyus, judge royal; and Emeric. Under the Pálóci family&#x27;s rule, the estate expanded for the first time in decades when, in 1450, they purchased the neighboring settlement of Szépbánya, also known as Bányácska, now Rudabányácska. In 1453, after King Ladislaus V ascended the Hungarian throne and sought to stabilize the post-civil war situation, he confirmed the Pálóci family in their estates, including the Patak lordship. Between 1490 and 1492, during John I Albert of Poland&#x27;s attempt to claim the Hungarian throne, the Pálóci family used the fortress at Sátoraljaújhely to block the prince’s Hungarian supporters from reaching his camp. In response, Polish forces briefly captured the fortress and the towns of Sárospatak and likely Sátoraljaújhely. In 1514, several residents of the town joined the Dozsa Rebellion, during which the mob looted the two local monasteries, seized their estates, and destroyed their charters. Despite occasional divisions of the estate among family members or its temporary mortgaging, the Pálóci family remained in possession of the Patak lordship until 1526.

=== From the Battle of Mohács to the Rákóczi War of Independence (1526–1711) ===
In 1508, the Perényi family acquired the castle of Siklós in southern Hungary, which they chose as their primary residence. However, due to the expansion of the Ottoman Empire, they decided to relocate their seat to northeastern Hungary, selecting Sárospatak as their new center. It is important to note that this decision did not result in an immediate relocation, as Sátoraljaújhely remained under the ownership of the Pálóci family until 1526. After the Battle of Mohács, in which Antal Pálóci perished without a male heir, his estates were seized by Peter Perényi, the Count of Temes. Peter, a relative of Antal Pálóci’s mother, took advantage of the post-battle chaos and occupied the Patak lordship. While his actions were legally questionable, his possession was later confirmed by both John Zápolya and Ferdinand I in exchange for political support. During their relocation, the Perényi family brought a significant number of Slavonian (referred to as &quot;tót&quot; in contemporary sources) and Hungarian nobles and serfs, who primarily settled in Sárospatak and Sátoraljaújhely. In return for their services, these settlers were exempted from feudal obligations. The Perényi family controlled the lordship for two generations, introducing numerous significant changes that had long-term effects on the town&#x27;s development. In 1526, Peter Perényi aligned with King Ferdinand I, leading John Zápolya to declare the Perényi estates as royal property, though he was unable to seize them. At this time, King John regarded Sátoraljaújhely as his own town. In February 1528, after retreating from central Hungary, John Zápolya personally besieged the fortress and resided in the Pauline monastery during the siege. The fortress, defended by its captain Simon de Athina, eventually surrendered, but Ferdinand’s forces recaptured it in the summer of 1528. In September, Athina retook the fortress, which became one of the few strongholds loyal to Szapolyai in the following months. In the spring of 1529, Peter Perényi besieged the fortress with his own forces and installed a new captain. The repeated sieges caused destruction to the surrounding areas, as King John’s supporters continued to raid the lordship. To avoid leaving an indefensible fortress near his newly built Sárospatak Castle, Peter Perényi chose not to rebuild the fortress at Sátoraljaújhely. By 1538, the fortress was already in ruins, and no efforts were made to restore it. The conflicts surrounding the fortress likely had a detrimental impact on the town&#x27;s development. Following the destruction of the fortress, the Perényi family focused on fortifying Sárospatak, surrounding it with walls and building a new residence there. In the 1530s, the ideas of the Reformation began to spread in Sátoraljaújhely, supported by Peter Perényi. The dissolution of Catholic ecclesiastical institutions started during this period. In the 1540s, under the direction of Gabriel Perényi, the lord of the town, the reform of the town and the entire lordship continued. By 1548, a Protestant pastor was already serving in Sátoraljaújhely. As the Perényi family adhered to Lutheranism, the local congregation followed the same confession until 1567. After this, although no formal change occurred, the town and surrounding region gradually transitioned to the Calvinism. In 1563, Gabriel Perényi, Peter’s son, made an agreement with Maximilian II regarding the future of his estates. He agreed that if he died without a male heir, the Patak lordship would revert to the crown according to legal inheritance laws. In 1566, Sultan Suleiman I launched a campaign against Hungary, assisted by John Sigismund, Prince of Transylvania. John Sigismund’s task was to tie down royal troops in eastern Hungary while the main Ottoman army fought in Transdanubia. A Crimean Tatar contingent accompanying John Sigismund likely invaded the Patak lordship through the Bózsva Valley, causing widespread devastation. Sátoraljaújhely suffered perhaps its greatest wartime destruction in history during this invasion. The Crimean Tatars burned 86% of the town’s buildings, including the Augustinian monastery, and captured many residents as slaves. The Augustinian monastery had already been dissolved or abandoned by this time, and when the Tatars burned it, the building stood empty. Its properties had already been confiscated by the lordship, and the monastery gradually faded from public memory. The Pauline monastery had a different fate. It survived the early decades of the Reformation, partly because it operated as an independent estate and was not fully controlled by the surrounding Protestant lords. However, monastic life eventually ceased as the town’s residents converted to Protestantism, and the lack of donations led to the monastery&#x27;s dissolution. Gabriel Perényi confiscated the monastery’s gold and silver liturgical items and vestments, along with its estates. In 1559, he returned these items in exchange for the Paulines dropping their legal claims. In 1567, Gabriel Perényi died, marking the end of the wealthiest branch of the Perényi family. After his death, the Patak lordship reverted to the crown, and its administration was taken over by the royal treasury.

==== Transitional Period (1567–1608) ====
After the Battle of Mohács, the Dobó family of Ruská laid claim to the Pálóci estates but was unable to acquire them from the Perényi family. Following the death of the last member of the Perényi family in 1567, the town reverted to royal ownership and was managed as a treasury estate. This development reopened opportunities for the Dobó family. In 1573, King Maximilian pawned the lordship to István Dobó&#x27;s widow and his son, Ferenc Dobó. After Ferenc Dobó&#x27;s death in 1602, the inheritance of the estate became entangled in a complex legal process. Initially, the royal treasury confiscated the estate, but after a year-long dispute, Ferenc Dobó’s widow, Zsófia Perényi, was granted possession. During the Bocskai Uprising, which began in 1604, the region saw repeated military campaigns by both royal forces and Bocskai’s hajdú troops, causing extensive devastation. In 1605, the armies of Giorgio Basta, the royal general, ravaged the town, followed by Bocskai’s hajdú troops in 1606 and 1607. Basta&#x27;s forces even burned the buildings in the vineyard areas, inflicting significant damage. After 1608, the estate passed to Borbála Zeleméri and later to her daughter, Zsuzsanna Lorántffy, through whom it came into the possession of George Rákóczi I. The Dobó family and their heirs, as well as the Rákóczi family, followed the Reformed faith, and until the 1670s, the majority of the town’s population adhered to the same. The Reformation left a significant mark on the intellectual character of the town, shaping its cultural and religious life.

==== The Era of the Rákóczi Family (17th Century) ====
In 1630, King Ferdinand II renounced the right of pledge over the Patak estate and transferred it to George I Rákóczi and his wife with hereditary rights. That same year, George I Rákóczi became the Prince of Transylvania, and several members of the Rákóczi family later held this position. Although they ruled independently as princes in Transylvania, their Patak estate belonged to the territory of Royal Hungary. Like other nobles, they held these lands by royal grace, even when in conflict with the Habsburg monarch. In 1644, Nikolaus Esterházy, a royal general fighting against George I Rákóczi, devastated the Patak estate, including the Rákóczi Castle of Borša and the town of Sátoraljaújhely, which he plundered. In 1648, George I Rákóczi passed away, leaving the Patak estate to his widow, Zsuzsanna Lorántffy, and their son, George II Rákóczi. During the Rákóczi era, the nobility in Sátoraljaújhely grew; by 1648, the town had 26 privileged noble houses. The Hartai family owned the largest estate, created by merging four plots into a small domain referred to as Hartai Manor. In 1654, Zsuzsanna Lorántffy built a manor house, likely on the site of a former Augustinian monastery. However, the manor&#x27;s prosperity was short-lived, as later owners of the Patak estate did not reside there, leaving the manor to decay as a partially abandoned economic building on the outskirts of town. George II Rákóczi died in 1660, and his estates were inherited by his widow, Sophia Báthory, and their son, the young Francis I Rákóczi. After her husband&#x27;s death, Zsófia Báthory returned to Catholicism, converting herself and her son, thereby aligning the previously Protestant-supporting Rákóczi family with Catholicism. This marked the beginning of the Counter-Reformation in Sátoraljaújhely. On her estates, including Sátoraljaújhely, Báthory revoked the income of the Reformed Church and initiated the transfer of churches to Catholics. The Austro-Turkish War of 1663–1664 brought further hardships to the region. Francis I Rákóczi joined the Wesselényi magnate conspiracy against King Leopold I, which was uncovered in 1670. Although Rákóczi was pardoned, the Sárospatak castle was occupied by royal troops, and several nobles from Sátoraljaújhely lost their estates. Many of these predominantly Protestant nobles fled to Transylvania, where they organized armed forces. These exiled nobles later became known as the Kuruc, who launched attacks on the Patak estate occupied by royal troops in 1672 and 1678. The Kuruc attacks ended in 1682 when Francis I Rákóczi&#x27;s widow, Ilona Zrínyi, married Emeric Thököly, the leader of the Kuruc forces. In 1683, royal troops withdrew from Patak, and the estate came under Thököly&#x27;s control until it was retaken by the royal army in 1685. The estate and Sátoraljaújhely were then placed under treasury administration until 1688. The Kuruc attacks and the end of Thököly&#x27;s rule impoverished the town&#x27;s population. According to the 1688 Urbarium, only a few households remained taxable, and the estate buildings fell into decline. Visible signs of decay included the neglected manor and a burnt-down inn. In 1697, the area saw a brief peasant uprising, known in history as the Hegyalja uprising. Fifty-five residents of Sátoraljaújhely, including nobles and peasants, participated. The uprising began at the town&#x27;s Assumption Day fair, where the rebels killed the Sárospatak castle&#x27;s military commander and captured the castles of Patak and Tokaj, but the rebellion was suppressed within weeks. In 1693, Francis I Rákóczi&#x27;s children, Julianna and Francis II Rákóczi, divided their inheritance, finalizing it in 1699. The Patak estate and the town of Sátoraljaújhely came entirely under the ownership of Francis II Rákóczi. In 1701, Rákóczi was arrested for participating in a conspiracy against the king but managed to escape to Poland. His estates, including the Patak estate, were confiscated by the royal treasury, and in 1702, the Sárospatak castle was demolished. In 1703, Rákóczi returned from Poland and launched a war against Leopold I, known as the Rákóczi War of Independence. The Kuruc forces captured the estate, restoring Rákóczi as its owner. In 1704, a fire completely destroyed the Barátszer district. Since this area was not yet integrated with the town&#x27;s central parts, the fire likely caused no damage to the town itself. In 1706, the Rákóczi family established a hospital to care for the disabled and wounded. By 1710, royal troops had captured the Sárospatak castle, and Sátoraljaújhely surrendered. The Rákóczi War of Independence ended with the Treaty of Szatmár, which Francis II Rákóczi did not accept. He chose voluntary exile, first in Poland, then in France, and finally in Turkey. His estates were confiscated by the Habsburgs, marking the end of the Rákóczi family&#x27;s rule over the town.

=== From the Suppression of the Rákóczi War of Independence to the Austro-Hungarian Compromise (1711–1867) ===

==== The Trautson Era (1711–1775) ====
From as early as 1701, the royal court considered the Patak estate a crown possession. During the Rákóczi War of Independence, in 1709, King Joseph I pledged the Patak and Regéc estates, along with several villages formerly belonging to Tokaj, to Prince Johann Leopold Donat Trautson. However, the prince could only take actual possession of these areas after the Treaty of Szatmár ended the conflict. Following this, the town of Sátoraljaújhely developed as a multi-denominational settlement, where the majority of the population was Roman Catholic, alongside significant Greek Catholic and Reformed communities. By the 18th century, the Jewish population in the town was also rapidly increasing. In 1720, King Charles VI granted the estate to Prince Trautson and his male heirs as a hereditary possession. This decision was met with protests and decades of unsuccessful legal challenges from several noble families. In May 1730, a fire destroyed large parts of the town. In August 1740, a plague epidemic struck Sátoraljaújhely, claiming 893 lives by the end of October. In 1750, the tower of the parish church was repaired, but fires in 1765 and 1768 once again damaged the church, leaving only its medieval walls, the sanctuary’s arch, and the main altar intact. As part of the nationwide resettlement policy, the Trautson estate established two German settlements in 1751 and 1752: Trautsonfalva (now Hercegkút) and Karlsdorf (now Károlyfalva). Records from 1759 indicate that the town began repopulating. However, in 1765, another fire caused significant damage to both the church and the town. By 1767, Sátoraljaújhely had its first doctor and pharmacist. In 1770, the Reformed community of Sátoraljaújhely, citing its membership of over 700, petitioned Queen Maria Theresa for permission to build a stone prayer house in the Reformed cemetery. This request was denied, and the community only succeeded in building their new church after the Edict of Tolerance was issued in 1789. During this period, the Trautson family conducted extensive investigations into the legal status of the nobles residing on the estate. In 1774, as part of Maria Theresa’s land reforms, the official urbarium of Sátoraljaújhely was prepared. During the land survey, Sátoraljaújhely was classified as a first-class estate, the highest possible ranking. The Trautson era came to an end in 1775 with the extinction of the male line of the family.

==== Habsburg Royal Estate (1775–1806) ====
After the extinction of the male line of the Trautson family, the Patak estate became a royal possession again, managed by the Habsburg treasury. From 1777 to 1783, a dedicated administrative body oversaw the estate before the chamber resumed regular management. In 1786, the Pauline order was dissolved, and its former properties were transferred to a national religious fund. The 1791 urbarium highlighted the town’s advantageous location for trade, supported by weekly markets, its status as a county seat, and the presence of Polish wine merchants. Most residents worked in viticulture, mainly as laborers rather than landowners. In 1799, a dispute arose between the town and the estate over its status. The estate claimed Sátoraljaújhely was a serf settlement, while the townspeople argued it was a town with civic rights. Throughout the 18th century, both a Pauline hospital and a municipal hospital operated, but the latter fell into disrepair by the century’s end. In 1803, the two institutions were merged, with the municipal hospital being closed. These hospitals primarily served as social care homes for the elderly and destitute, rather than functioning as medical facilities.

==== Bretzenheim Era (1806–1848) ====
In 1807, King Francis II granted the Sárospatak and Regéc estates to Prince Karl August of Bretzenheim as compensation for the loss of his Rhineland properties during the Napoleonic Wars. In 1826, the dispute over Sátoraljaújhely&#x27;s status reignited when the estate administration prohibited the town from using the title &quot;privileged town&quot; in official documents. The town faced significant challenges during this period. In 1831, a cholera epidemic caused substantial losses among the population. In 1833, the first public hospital opened, improving healthcare services. On October 15, 1834, a morning earthquake caused minor to moderate damage to buildings but no fatalities or collapses. On July 19, 1845, flooding from the Ronyva stream destroyed several small bridges and claimed four lives.

==== During the Revolution and War of Independence of 1848 ====
After the outbreak of the Revolution, Zemplén County actively participated in organizing the national guard and recruiting new soldiers for the Hungarian army. In Sátoraljaújhely, significant military and organizational activities took place. Many locals volunteered, though some were rejected due to physical unfitness. Nevertheless, those unable to join contributed to the national guard by donating money, weapons, and uniforms to support the cause. In October 1848, fears arose in Zemplén County and neighboring regions about an Austrian force of 5,000 troops under General Balthasar Simunich possibly advancing through the Dukla Pass to reinforce imperial armies near Vienna. However, the troops crossed the border near Trenčín instead. Military defenses in the area were organized by Lieutenant Colonel Sándor Pulszky and government commissioner Dániel Irányi. According to the National Defense Committee’s plan, Zemplén County fell under the 7th (Prešov) Military District for training recruits and forming battalions, with Pulszky appointed as commander. The 42nd Honvéd Battalion was established in Sárospatak, including recruits from Sátoraljaújhely. Despite accelerated training, the combat readiness of local units remained limited after just a few weeks of preparation. In the roster of the Zemplén III Volunteer Company, commanded by Captain Mezősy and consisting of 184 members (dated October 4, 1848), the names of eight residents from Sátoraljaújhely are listed. However, many more locals took up arms, including around 100 Jewish residents who joined the national guard. In December 1848, the Austrian army launched a significant offensive in Upper Hungary, creating a dire situation in Zemplén County and Sátoraljaújhely. General Franz Schlik’s forces, 8,000 strong, entered from Galicia, capturing Prešov on December 9 and advancing to Košice. This sparked panic among the local population and national guards, particularly with the appearance of Polish troops in the region. While reinforcements were sent from Sátoraljaújhely and Tállya, these units were inexperienced. By late December, Major János Besze was tasked with leading the Zemplén forces, who were enthusiastic but poorly equipped. In January 1849, Minister of Defense Lázár Mészáros sent additional troops to the region. Despite multiple attempts to resist, Hungarian forces suffered a severe defeat at Košice on January 4. Mészáros withdrew his troops to the Miskolc and Tokaj areas before resigning. On January 13, command was transferred to the young General György Klapka in Tokaj. Schlik launched an offensive on January 17 to prevent Hungarian forces from regrouping, forcing Klapka to retreat. Austrian troops, led by Major Joseph Herzmanovsky, occupied Sátoraljaújhely on January 20, though the occupation lasted only a few days. Skirmishes near Tarcal on January 22 and Bodrogkeresztúr on January 23 ended with Austrian withdrawals. On January 27, Captain József Oroszhegyi called for a local uprising, urging volunteers to assemble at Bodrogkeresztúr. Reports from scouts stationed in Mikóháza indicated enemy cavalry near Pálháza, and on January 28, Austrian troops re-entered Sátoraljaújhely with an estimated 5,000 infantry, cavalry, and five cannons. By February 2, however, they had withdrawn entirely. On June 30, Russian troops occupied Sátoraljaújhely, as detailed in Dénes Katona’s diary. The occupying force, consisting of 3,600 infantry and several hundred Cossacks, arrived via the Dukla Pass. The occupation placed significant pressure on the town’s population, with locals frequently harassed and looted by soldiers. On July 2, the town council restricted grain exports to address food supply concerns, and on July 11, it introduced smaller denomination banknotes to ease local economic difficulties. By September 1849, the so-called &quot;German era&quot; began in Sátoraljaújhely. Alajos Draveczky, the county president under the imperial government, replaced local leaders with loyalists to the Habsburg crown. &quot;Unreliable&quot; municipal officials and teachers were removed, and opposition organizations, such as the Zemplén Casino, were systematically dissolved.

=== From the Austro-Hungarian Compromise to the Treaty of Trianon (1867–1920) ===

==== The Belle Époque (1867–1914) ====

Following the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, Sátoraljaújhely experienced rapid growth in the late 19th century, with its population tripling within 50 years. From just over 6,000 inhabitants in 1850, the town grew to 20,000 by the outbreak of World War I and reached 22,000 by 1920. This economic and demographic expansion was largely driven by the development of the Galician railway network. In 1871, the town&#x27;s main railway station was built, and the first double-track railway in Hungary connected Sátoraljaújhely with Miskolc and Budapest, facilitating significant freight traffic. The completion of the Sátoraljaújhely–Homenné–Przemyśl railway line in 1872 further connected the town to areas beyond the Carpathians and to the western regions of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Sátoraljaújhely became a major railway hub, with lines linking it to Kraków, Lviv, and other key Galician cities. The town also became a postal center in the 1870s, enhancing its regional importance. By the turn of the century, Sátoraljaújhely had developed into a major commercial and financial center in northeastern Hungary. The Jewish community played a prominent role in establishing and advancing the town&#x27;s capitalist economic structure. This period also saw significant migration, with settlers arriving from Galicia and nearby villages, contributing to the town&#x27;s growth. The late 19th and early 20th centuries saw considerable urban development, shaping the town&#x27;s central district as it is known today. Notable milestones included the opening of a theater in 1883, the construction of a fire station in 1888, and the establishment of sports clubs in 1890. The tobacco factory, completed in 1894, remains operational to this day. In 1896, the town established an electric power plant, and in 1900, a gymnasium and public bath were inaugurated. In 1899, Sátoraljaújhely was granted the status of a &quot;municipal town,&quot; giving it greater self-governance. Key infrastructure projects followed: the new cemetery opened in 1901, and in 1905, the Jewish Hospital and the Zemplén County Public Hospital were both completed. That same year, the Justice Palace and penitentiary, designed by architect Győző Czigler, were built. A modern water and sewer system was launched in 1906, and in 1908, the Piarist High School&#x27;s three-story building was completed. The town’s viticulture industry recovered after the phylloxera crisis of the 1890s, with vineyard reconstruction completed by 1905. This revival boosted wine trade, and in 1913–14, Sátoraljaújhely’s iconic wine hub, the &quot;Wine Church&quot;, was built near the railway station. Its façade features Zsolnay tile mosaics depicting the crests of winemaking towns from the Tokaj region. The complex includes a 37-branch cellar capable of storing tens of thousands of hectoliters of wine. Additionally, road modernization projects were undertaken in the early 20th century. The town’s first newspaper, &quot;Zemplénmegyei Híradó&quot; (later &quot;Zempléni Híradó&quot;), began publication in 1862, followed by the &quot;Zemplén&quot; newspaper in 1870. The Compromise period ushered in a vibrant cultural life for Sátoraljaújhely. When Hungary abolished the status of market towns in 1871, Sátoraljaújhely became a large village, gradually shedding its rural character and adopting a more urban, civic lifestyle. Highly educated professionals, including teachers, doctors, engineers, and lawyers, began to settle in the town. In 1881, the Rákóczi Freemason Lodge was established, with objectives such as marking the birthplace of Francis II Rákóczi and restoring the grave and garden of Ferenc Kazinczy, including the construction of a mausoleum. The local press played a significant role in promoting the town’s cultural values, particularly in cultivating the legacies of Rákóczi, Kazinczy, and Lajos Kossuth. Their prominence grew during the Millennium celebrations, despite none of them being natives of the town. This cultural movement centered around three major events: Kossuth’s death in 1894, the return of Rákóczi’s remains in 1906, and the 150th anniversary of Kazinczy’s birth in 1909. By the 1910s, Sátoraljaújhely was known as a vibrant, cosmopolitan town with a lively intellectual and commercial atmosphere.

==== During World War I (1914–1920) ====
The Czech army occupied Sátoraljaújhely on April 30, 1919, but it was recaptured by the military forces of the Hungarian Soviet Republic on June 6. The Czechs re-entered the town on August 13 and maintained their occupation of the area until the spring of 1920.

==== Consequences of the Treaty of Trianon ====
As a result of the Treaty of Trianon in 1920, Sátoraljaújhely became a border town. Previously a significant railway hub, it was downgraded to a terminal station and remained the seat of the now truncated Zemplén County. Part of the town, located along the Ronyva Stream, was ceded to Czechoslovakia and became known as Slovenské Nové Mesto. This division caused a decline in the town’s economic growth, reduced its trade activity, and diminished its administrative and cultural significance. The Ronyva Sream became the new state border, separating the industrial area and eastern agricultural lands from the rest of the town. Following the border inspection by the Hungarian-Czechoslovak Mixed Commission in 1924, the Czechoslovak authorities returned the municipal waterworks and granted a built road for use under Hungarian administration.

=== From the Treaty of Trianon to the Present (1920–) ===

==== Between the Two World Wars (1920–1939) ====

In the 1920s, many civil servants and intellectuals from the former Upper Hungary region (which corresponds to present-day Slovakia) moved to Sátoraljaújhely, as the county’s administrative structure remained at its pre-1918 size. Retirees, gendarmes, soldiers, and railway workers also settled in the town. However, local public life was limited by restricted voting rights and the persistence of the electoral system. Despite these challenges, residents organized themselves into various local communities, with religious groups and civic organizations playing particularly significant roles. Government investment in the town’s development during the interwar period was limited, though some improvements were made. A narrow-gauge railway was built along the main road, connecting Füzérkomlós in the Hegyköz region to Nyíregyháza in 1924. Unfortunately, the bridge near the village of Balsa, located on the banks of the Tisza River, was destroyed at the end of World War II, after which the railway operated only as far as Kenézlő. 
In 1928, the town inaugurated its new theater building on the main square, flanked by two apartment buildings for civil servants. Between 1926 and 1928, the town constructed the headquarters of the Financial Directorate, featuring a gable adorned with a sculpture group by Zsigmond Kisfaludy Strobl depicting the Hungarian Conquest. The town was particularly active in supporting Hungarian territorial revision efforts during the interwar period. Following the First Vienna Award, from 1938 to 1944, Sátoraljaújhely regained its formerly ceded territories. In 1936, as part of the irredentist and revisionist movements, the Magyar Kálvária (Hungarian Calvary) memorial was built on Szár Hill above the town, funded by public donations. The memorial included 13 bastion-like stations representing cities lost to Hungary, the 100th National Flag at the summit, and the Saint Stephen Chapel, consecrated in 1938. These structures were destroyed in 1946 but were rebuilt after the fall of communism.

==== During World War II (1939–1945) ====
During World War II, Sátoraljaújhely was an important location where the 2nd department of the Hungarian General Staff (VKF/2) conducted intelligence and counterintelligence activities. During the German occupation, on March 22, 1944, an uprising broke out in the local prison, which was brutally suppressed by the occupying German forces. The Kosice Honvéd Court Martial (in present-day Slovakia) acted as a summary court in the case. Some of the political prisoners got hold of weapons and tried to break out, but were shot at during the breakout. The rebellion had a total of 60 fatalities. The survivors were interrogated and sentenced in the Sátoraljaújhely prison, but some prisoners managed to escape with the help of local residents. In the summer of 1944, 2,567 Jewish residents were deported from the town to concentration camps.

At the end of 1944, heavy fighting took place around Sátoraljaújhely, in which the hills around the town, including Várhegy, played a prominent role. The town was strategically important for the retreating Hungarian and German troops, as it formed the southern point of the Gizella position, which closed the eastern end of the Karola-line. From mid-November, Soviet troops approached the town from several directions. The Hungarian and German troops retreated to the fighting positions on the heights behind the Bodrog and Ronyva rivers, after making serious efforts to strengthen the Bodrog and the foreland of the town. The defense of Sátoraljaújhely was provided by the German 4th Mountain Division, reinforced with subunits of the Hungarian 10th and 16th Infantry Divisions. After fierce street fighting on December 2, the town fell into Soviet hands. The fighting then continued in the surrounding mountains. The Soviet troops gradually occupied the hills, while the Hungarian and German units defended the town side of Magashegy, Sátorhegy, Némahegy and Várhegy. The unit stationed on Várhegy, mostly Hungarian, repulsed the attacks of the Romanian troops several times. The detailed history of the fighting in the hills is still unexplored, but during the archaeological excavation of Várhegy, numerous artifacts were found that can help reconstruct the struggles. Traces of firing positions and machine gun nests can be seen on the southeastern side of the plateau. During the excavations, cans, ammunition box handles, ammunition, bayonet, identity tags (&quot;dog tag&quot;) and unexploded mines and hand grenades were found. The memory of the soldiers who died in the battles around Sátoraljaújhely is preserved by numerous local memorials.

==== Socialist Era (1945–1990) ====
Between 1945 and 1950, amateur theater thrived in Sátoraljaújhely. In 1948, religious schools, including the Piarist High School and the Carolineum Girls&#x27; Institute, were nationalized. After 1950, the town’s educational network expanded significantly. Alongside the high school, two additional secondary schools opened: the Economic Vocational School and the Viticulture Vocational School. Other institutions established during this period included a Technical School, three primary schools, a Slovak-language school, a special education school, and, from 1957, the State Music School. Until 1950, Sátoraljaújhely served as the seat of Zemplén County. However, this status was lost during the 1950 administrative reorganization, which dissolved the historic county system. That same year, following the Soviet model, the town council was established as the new local government body under the council law, and the theater building was repurposed as a Cultural Center. The 1950s also brought significant changes to local industry and administration. Factories were established, marking the beginning of state and council-driven industrial development, while private small-scale industries were suppressed. Urbanization spurred migration from nearby villages, driving a steady increase in housing construction and the development of the town’s first prefabricated panel housing estates. From the 1960s, Tokaj-Hegyalja became a closed wine region, and the state-led restructuring of viticulture and winemaking brought substantial changes to this key agricultural sector. During this time, there was a growing demand for artistic and cultural groups to preserve local traditions. Beginning in 1966, Sátoraljaújhely hosted the annual Winter Young Pioneer Olympics, which gained national recognition for the town in skiing. In 1967, the Spartacus football team won the County First Division Championship, and in 1969, the Hegyalja Folk Ensemble, now renowned beyond Hungary’s borders, was founded. In 1971, the Borkombinát (Wine Combine) was established to coordinate viticulture and winemaking in the Tokaj-Hegyalja region, with its headquarters in Sátoraljaújhely. However, tourism remained underdeveloped until the 1970s, primarily due to a lack of accommodations and high-quality hospitality services. In the early 1980s, the section of the narrow-gauge railway passing through the town was dismantled, followed by the removal of the entire network. In 1984, the town&#x27;s historical exhibition was renovated, and in 1985, the Kazinczy Ferenc Society was founded, marking a significant revival in civic life. In 1988, the local monthly &quot;Újhelyi Körkép&quot; began publication.

==== Since the End of Communism (1990–) ====

The independence of Ukraine in 1991 had a direct impact on Sátoraljaújhely, allowing residents to reconnect with their relatives in Transcarpathia. The establishment of independent Slovakia in 1993 created a new geopolitical situation for the town, which became a key settlement along the Hungarian-Slovak border. Hungary and Slovakia&#x27;s accession to the European Union in 2004 and their entry into the Schengen Area in 2007 opened new opportunities for cross-border cooperation. With the removal of border controls, mobility and economic relations strengthened, although the early days of Schengen integration were marked by conflicts. On the Slovak side, concrete flower boxes were used to block the road connecting the Hungarian and Slovak parts of the town, causing local tensions and international disputes. The regime change of 1990 and the subsequent years brought significant transformations to Sátoraljaújhely. The town’s administration, education, social services, industry, and commerce underwent multiple restructurings. The closure of many local employers and production facilities posed serious challenges to the population. After the turn of the millennium, the town faced economic decline and social issues as its most pressing challenges. The growing proportion of the Romani population raised new social and economic questions, and property prices remained below the national average, signaling increasing poverty. The town leadership saw tourism development as a way to revive the economy and made significant investments in this area. In 2002, a new sports hall was opened, and the municipal swimming pool was renovated. In 2007, the cultural center was modernized, and in 2008, the bypass section of &#x27;Main road 37&#x27; was completed, reducing inner-town traffic and improving the town&#x27;s livability. That same year, archaeological excavations began on Vár-hegy (Castle Hill). In 2009, the Zemplén Adventure Park was inaugurated, which has since been continually expanded. In the same year, the town’s main street was converted into a pedestrian zone, enhancing local tourism. In 2010, the railway station building was renovated, and in 2021, the Rákóczi Hotel, Camp, and Event Center, formerly a socialist-era children’s camp, was transformed into a modern hotel, event center and a summer camp for students. Also in 2021, the complete renovation of the abandoned &quot;Wine Church&quot; began, along with plans to repurpose the building. In 2024, the &quot;Bridge of National Unity&quot; was inaugurated, connecting the castle ruins with the Zemplén Adventure Park. That year, the municipal swimming pool and sports hall were modernized, and the fully renovated &quot;Wine Church&quot; reopened to the public.

=== Jewish history ===

Historically, Újhely (Sátoraljaújhely) belonged to the county of Zemplén. Documents show that in 1734 Jews were living at Sátoraljaújhely and that they were allowed to acquire real estate. It is evident that the community was then increasing; for 10 years later the Jews possessed a school which in 1829 received a bequest of 260,000 florins from Martin Raphael Kästenbaum, and which was thenceforth known by his name. The oldest tombstone bears date of 1760, although the ḥebra ḳaddisha, with which was connected to a hospital, was not established until 1772, its founder being an itinerant rabbi named Naphtali Hirsch. The first ḥebrabook has a drawing on its title-page representing the last rites. A synagogue was built at Sátoraljaújhely in 1790; and when it was demolished in 1887, to be replaced by a new house of worship, it was found to have 8 subterranean chambers, which probably served as safe hiding rooms from local antisemitic pogroms. The oldest document of the community is dated 1831, during the rabbinate of Moses Teitelbaum, of whom the story is told that Lajos Kossuth, afterward leader of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, when suffering from an infantile sickness, was brought to him, and that the rabbi blessed the child and, referring to the word &quot;ḳosheṭ&quot; in Psalm lx. 6 (A. V. 4), prophesied his future greatness. Teitelbaum died in 1841, and was succeeded by his grandson Yekusiel Yehuda Teitelbaum, who in about year 1848 went to Gorlice. Jeremiah Löw was then appointed rabbi of Ujhely. Löw, who was one of the leaders of the Orthodox party, was succeeded by the chief rabbi, Koloman Weisz, and the preacher Isidor Goldberger. Michael Heilprin, who acted as secretary to Minister Bertalan Szemere in 1848, was, prior to the Revolution, a teacher in the Jewish school of Ujhely. The Jews of the town in 1905 numbered 4,500 out of a total population of 13,000.

<text>Sabine Reyes Ulibarrí (September 21, 1919 – January 4, 2003) was an American poet. He was also a teacher, a writer, a critic, and a statesman. Ulibarrí was born in Tierra Amarilla, New Mexico.

Sabine Ulibarrí served in World War II with the U.S. Army Air Forces. He was decorated for his valor during the war with two medals, the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Air Medal. After the war he continued his studies at the University of New Mexico where he received his Master&#x27;s in Spanish. After teaching for a few years at UNM he enrolled in the University of California, Los Angeles where he worked on his doctorate in Spanish literature. After receiving his doctorate in 1958 from UCLA he returned to the University of New Mexico and taught Spanish and Spanish-American literature until he retired in 1982.

Sabine Ulibarri is known widely for his use of language when crafting his stories, and the use of details of rural New Mexican Spanish and Native American life. His stories are considered some of the earliest roots in modern Hispano Literature taking shape both in Spanish and English. His books, Mi Abuela Fumaba Puros (My Grandmother Smoked Cigars)&#x27; and &#x27;Mi Caballo Mago (My Wonder Horse)&#x27; and &#x27;Tierra Amarilla: and other stories&#x27; are considered by many native New Mexican writers as quintessential examples of modern Hispanic literature and have inspired countless young Hispanics to become writers and educators.

Some argue that Sabine Ulibarri—alongside Rudolfo Anaya – was one of the great thinkers of modern Hispanic literature who was grounded in what would be termed the &#x27;old ways.&#x27; He was able to recollect for younger Hispanos a sense of place and enlighten them with stories of the difficulties of living in Tierra Amarilla, a town which became famous during the Tierra Amarilla Court House raid. It is not known if any of Ulibarri&#x27;s family or friends were involved in such contentious moments in New Mexican history. Sabine Ulibarri could be credited with highlighting the struggle of traditional values versus modern American law and policies such as &#x27;manifest destiny&#x27; and how these concepts began eroding more than 500 years of agricultural and spiritual-based traditional lifestyles of northern New Mexico. He framed the conflict eloquently in his prose without ever digressing into political dissertation.

The University of New Mexico named the Sabine Ulibarrí Spanish as a Heritage Language (SUSHL) Program for him. María Dolores Gonzales, a colleague of Ulibarrí&#x27;s in the Spanish department at UNM, ran the program for 12 years and expanded it.

<doc id="1020973" wikidata="Q1284181" url="?curid=1020973" title="Two Minutes Hate">
<text>In the dystopian novel &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; (1949) by George Orwell, the Two Minutes Hate is the daily period during which members of the Outer and Inner Party of Oceania must watch a film depicting Emmanuel Goldstein, the principal enemy of the state, and his followers, the Brotherhood, and loudly voice their hatred for the enemy and then their love for Big Brother.

The political purpose of the Two Minutes Hate is to allow the citizens of Oceania to vent their existential anguish and personal hatred toward politically expedient enemies: Goldstein and the enemy super-state of the moment. In re-directing the members&#x27; subconscious feelings away from the Party&#x27;s governance of Oceania and toward non-existent external enemies, the Party minimises thoughtcrime and the consequent subversive behaviours of &quot;thoughtcriminals&quot;.

==Purpose==
In the novel &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;, the first session of Two Minutes Hate shows the introduction of O&#x27;Brien, a member of the Inner Party, to the story of Winston Smith, the protagonist whose feelings communicate the effectiveness of the Party&#x27;s psychological manipulation and control of Oceanian society:

Brainwashing of the participants in the Two Minutes Hate includes auditory and visual cues, such as &quot;a hideous, grinding screech, as of some monstrous machine running without oil&quot; that burst from the telescreen, meant to psychologically excite the crowd into an emotional frenzy of hatred, fear, and loathing for Emmanuel Goldstein, and for Oceania&#x27;s enemy of the moment, either Eastasia or Eurasia. The hate session includes the participants throwing things at the telescreen showing the film, as does the Julia character. In the course of the Two Minutes Hate, the film image of Goldstein metamorphoses into the face of a bleating sheep, as enemy soldiers advance towards the viewers of the film, before one enemy soldier charges towards the viewers, whilst firing his sub-machinegun; the face of that soldier then becomes the face of Big Brother. At the end of the two-minute session of hatred, the members of the Party ritualistically chant &quot;B-B . . . B-B . . . B-B . . . B-B.&quot; To maintain the extreme emotions provoked in the Two Minutes Hate sessions, the Party created Hate Week, a week-long festival of hatreds.

==Instances and parallels==

In a 2012 blog post, a Ukrainian TV manager said attacks on the government&#x27;s liberal opposition by Russian state-owned Russia-1 reminded him of the &quot;two minutes of hate&quot;. American propaganda by the Committee on Public Information during World War I has also been compared to the propaganda in the &quot;two minutes hate&quot; program.

<doc id="1020980" wikidata="Q615297" url="?curid=1020980" title="Starling equation">
<text>The Starling principle holds that fluid movement across a semi-permeable blood vessel such as a capillary or small venule is determined by the hydrostatic pressures and colloid osmotic pressures (oncotic pressure) on either side of a semipermeable barrier that sieves the filtrate, retarding larger molecules such as proteins from leaving the blood stream. As all blood vessels allow a degree of protein leak , true equilibrium across the membrane cannot occur and there is a continuous flow of water with small solutes. The molecular sieving properties of the capillary wall reside in a recently-discovered endocapillary layer rather than in the dimensions of pores through or between the endothelial cells. This fibre matrix endocapillary layer is called the endothelial glycocalyx.The Starling equation describes that relationship in mathematical form and can be applied to many biological and non-biological semipermeable membranes.

==The equation==
The Starling equation as applied to a blood vessel wall reads as 

:formula_1

where:
* formula_2 is the trans endothelial solvent filtration volume per second.
* formula_3 is the net driving force,
** formula_4 is the capillary hydrostatic pressure
** formula_5 is the interstitial hydrostatic pressure
** formula_6 is the plasma protein oncotic pressure
** formula_7 is the subglycocalyx oncotic pressure, which varies inversely with formula_2 and so stabilises formula_2.
** formula_10 is the hydraulic conductivity of the membrane
** formula_11 is the surface area for filtration, determined by gaps in the &quot;tight junction&quot; glue that binds endothelial cells at their edges. 
** formula_12 is Staverman&#x27;s reflection coefficient, determined by the condition of the endothelial glycocalyx over the junction gaps.

Pressures are customarily measured in millimetres of mercury (mmHg), and the filtration coefficient in millilitres per minute per millimetre of mercury (ml·min−1·mmHg−1).

The rate at which fluid is filtered across vascular endothelium (transendothelial filtration) is determined by the sum of two outward forces, capillary pressure (formula_4) and colloid osmotic pressure beneath the endothelial glycocalyx (formula_7), and two absorptive forces, plasma protein osmotic pressure (formula_6) and interstitial pressure (formula_5). The Starling equation is the first of two Kedem–Katchalski equations which bring nonsteady state thermodynamics to the theory of osmotic pressure across membranes that are at least partly permeable to the solute responsible for the osmotic pressure difference. The second Kedem–Katchalsky equation explains the trans endothelial transport of solutes, formula_17.

It is now known that the average colloid osmotic pressure of the interstitial fluid has no effect on formula_2. The colloid osmotic pressure difference that opposes filtration is now known to be π&#x27;p minus the subglycocalyx formula_7.The subglycocalyx space is a very small but vitally important micro domain of the total interstitial fluid space. The concentration of soluble proteins in that microdomain, which determines formula_7, is close to zero while there is adequate filtration to flush them out of the interendothelial clefts. For this reason formula_2 is much less than previously calculated and is tightly regulated . Any transient rise in plasma colloid osmotic pressure or fall in capillary hydrostatic pressure sufficient to allow reverse (negative) formula_2 causes unopposed diffusion of interstitial proteins to the subglycocalyx space, reducing the colloid osmotic pressure difference that was driving absorption of fluid to the capillary. The dependence of formula_7 upon the local formula_2 has been called The Glycocalyx Model or the Michel-Weinbaum model, in honour of two scientists who, independently, described the filtration function of the glycocalyx. The Michel-Weinbaum Model explains how most continuous capillaries are in a steady state of filtration along their entire length most of the time. Transient disturbances of the Starling forces return rapidly to steady state filtration.

===Filtration coefficient===

In some texts the product of hydraulic conductivity and surface area is called the filtration co-efficient Kfc.

===Reflection coefficient===
Staverman&#x27;s reflection coefficient, &quot;σ&quot;, is a unitless constant that is specific to the permeability of a membrane to a given solute.

The Starling equation, written without &quot;σ&quot;, describes the flow of a solvent across a membrane that is impermeable to the solutes contained within the solution.

&quot;σn&quot; corrects for the partial permeability of a semipermeable membrane to a solute &quot;n&quot;.

Where &quot;σ&quot; is close to 1, the plasma membrane is less permeable to the denotated species (for example, larger molecules such as albumin and other plasma proteins), which may flow across the endothelial lining, from higher to lower concentrations, more slowly, while allowing water and smaller solutes through the glycocalyx filter to the extravascular space.
* Glomerular capillaries have a reflection coefficient close to 1 as normally no protein crosses into the glomerular filtrate.
* In contrast, hepatic sinusoids have no reflection coefficient as they are fully permeable to protein. Hepatic interstitial fluid within the Space of Diss has the same colloid osmotic pressure as plasma and so hepatocyte synthesis of albumin can be regulated. 

===Approximate values===
Following are typical values for the variables in the Starling equation which regulate net formula_2 to about 0.1ml per second, 5-6 ml per minute or about 8 litres per day.
== Specific organs ==

=== Kidneys ===
Glomerular capillaries have a continuous glycocalyx layer in health and the total transendothelial filtration rate of solvent (formula_2) to the renal tubules is normally around 125 ml/ min (about 180 litres/ day). Glomerular capillary formula_2 is more familiarly known as the glomerular filtration rate (GFR).

=== Lungs ===
The Starling equation can describe the movement of fluid from pulmonary capillaries to the alveolar air space.

==Clinical significance==

Woodcock and Woodcock showed in 2012 that the revised Starling equation (steady-state Starling principle) provides scientific explanations for clinical observations concerning intravenous fluid therapy. Traditional teaching of both filtration and absorption of fluid occurring in a single capillary has been superseded by the concept of a vital circulation of extracellular interstitial fluid running parallel to the circulation of blood. Infusing intravenous fluids that raise plasma colloid osmotic pressure (colloid therapy) has much less effect on plasma volume than originally expected, in part because the initially reduced filtration rate allows the concentration of proteins in the subglycocalx spaces to rise, returning the colloid osmotic pressure difference and trans endothelial solvent filtration rate to their steady state levels within an hour. Prevention and treatment of oedema (excess interstitial fluid) depends on normalisation of formula_4 and optimisation of the flow rate of lymph.

== History ==
The Starling equation is named for the British physiologist Ernest Starling, who is also recognised for the Frank–Starling law of the heart. Starling can be credited with identifying that the &quot;absorption of isotonic salt solutions (from the extravascular space) by the blood vessels is determined by this osmotic pressure of the serum proteins&quot; in 1896.

<doc id="1020984" wikidata="Q7416258" url="?curid=1020984" title="Sandhills Community College">
<text>Sandhills Community College is a public community college in Pinehurst, North Carolina. Sandhills was chartered in 1963 and officially opened October 1, 1965. It was the first comprehensive community college authorized and established as the result of legislation passed by the 1963 General Assembly of North Carolina. It is part of the North Carolina Community College System. Sandhills Community College has about 4,000 students enrolled in college-credit curriculum courses and over 11,000 students who take continuing-education courses annually.

==History==
Shortly after the passage of legislation establishing Sandhills Community College, H. Clifton Blue of Aberdeen, NC, led a group of prominent Moore County, NC, citizens in petitioning the State Board of Education to establish a community college in Moore County. Upon approval of the petition, the citizens of Moore County voted in favor of a $1 million bond issue for capital construction and a tax levy for the maintenance of college facilities.

The first board of trustees meeting occurred on December 4, 1963. On December 27, Raymond Stone was named the first president of the college. Sandhills was chartered in 1963.

The buildings were designed by local architects Hayes-Howell and Associates, and built on 180 acres donated by Mrs. Mary Luman Meyer. The groundbreaking was in November 1964. Legend has it that Stone and a few others were having lunch at The Gray Fox in downtown Pinehurst and Stone admired the courtyard of the restaurant (now Theo&#x27;s Taverna). He requested courtyards be implemented into the design of the college buildings. The palladium windows were said to be inspired by the Boyd House in downtown Southern Pines.

Sandhills Community College officially opened October 1, 1965, with classes being held in nine different temporary locations in the downtown area of Southern Pines. The administrative offices were above Patches Department Store, which is now The Ice Cream Parlor. The college moved to the current location in September 1966.

John Dempsey assumed the presidency in 1989 and served until December 2022. On July 1, 2023, Alexander “Sandy” Stewart became the college’s third president.

== Administration ==

A board of trustees governs the college and is composed of appointees by the governor, the Moore County Board of Commissioners, and the Moore County Board of Education.

== Academics ==
In addition to the university studies college transfer program, Sandhills Community College offers 34 two-year Associate in Applied Science degrees (AAS). Certain programs offer 2+2 transferable agreements with several four-year institutions. Degrees from Sandhills are accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.

=== SandHoke Early College High School ===
SandHoke Early College High School is a partnership between the Hoke County School System and Sandhills Community College. At the conclusion of the five-year plan of study, graduates receive a high-school diploma from Hoke County schools and an associate of arts degree from Sandhills Community College. &quot;The mission of SandHoke Early College High School is to provide a smaller, more personalized learning community that will prepare all students for a challenging program of study by developing academic rigor, providing relevant coursework, and building student/community relationships.&quot; In addition to completing courses required by Hoke County Schools for the high school diploma, students will also complete the required plan of study for the Associate in Arts degree.

Admission to SandHoke Early College High School begins when Hoke County middle school students are in the eighth grade. Students and their parents complete an application form with Hoke County Schools.

==Athletics==
The college revived its athletic program in 2009. It comprises men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s golf teams, a women&#x27;s volleyball team, and a men&#x27;s basketball team. Competition is through Region X of the NJCAA. The teams are called the &quot;Flyers&quot;.

== Notable alumni ==
*Terry Anderson, songwriter and musician
**The Fabulous Knobs, rock band consisting of alumni Terry Anderson, Jack Cornell, David Enloe, and Debra DeMilo
*Matt Hardy, professional wrestler

<doc id="1020988" wikidata="Q643346" url="?curid=1020988" title="Arviat">
<text>Arviat (, syllabics: ᐊᕐᕕᐊᑦ; formerly called Eskimo Point until 1 June 1989) is a predominantly Inuit hamlet located on the western shore of Hudson Bay in the Kivalliq Region of Nunavut, Canada. Arviat (&quot;place of the bowhead whale&quot;) is derived from the Inuktitut word &quot;arviq&quot; meaning &quot;Bowhead whale&quot;. Earlier in history, its name was &quot;Tikirajualaaq&quot; (&quot;a little long point&quot;), and &quot;Ittaliurvik&quot; (&quot;a place where the people make tents&quot;).

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Canadian census conducted by Statistics Canada, Arviat had a population of 2,864 living in 632 of its 694 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 2,657. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

== Community ==
Arviat is the southernmost community on the Nunavut mainland and is close to the geographical centre of Canada. In Arviat, Inuktitut and English are primarily spoken, having the third largest population in Nunavut, behind Rankin Inlet and Iqaluit. From the 2011 Canadian census to the 2016 Canadian census there was a population increase of 14.6%. The mayor of Arviat is Joe Savikataaq (Jr.).

The community became a hamlet under the name Eskimo Point (name first appeared on maps in 1738) in 1977.

Cargo and passenger air service is provided by Calm Air, Canadian North and Nolinor Aviation (charter only) out of Arviat Airport. Destinations include other settlements in Nunavut and Manitoba, including Winnipeg.

Hunting and fishing are very active in the community; they are the primary source of sustenance. Four locally operated stores - Padlei Co-op, Northern Stores, Arctic Connection and Eskimo Point Lumber Supply - carry a wide range of products.

To the south, the town of Churchill, Manitoba is accessible by boat during the summer and fall. Churchill is accessible by snowmobile and Bombardier from Arviat. Churchill is often travelled to for supplies.

Arviat is well known around the Arctic for its artistic qualities. It is a thriving community with many talented musicians: Susan Aglukark, a well known musician; Simon &quot;Johnny Cash of the North&quot; Sigyariaq; the band Uniaqtuq, with Arsene, Pelagie and Mary Angalik; the Arviat Band, with John and Billy Kuksuk, Paul Kattau and others; the Irksuk band, played by Paul Irksuk and sons. All have had CDs recorded commercially.

Many types of wildlife are abundant. Within the vicinity of Arviat, polar bears, millions of migratory birds, beluga whales, and caribou are often spotted.

The only access is by air and snowmobile, but the Nunavut government and the federal Senate member for Nunavut, Dennis Patterson, are investigating the possibility of a highway from Thompson, Manitoba, Lynn Lake, or Gillam, Manitoba, or an extension of the Hudson Bay Railway from Churchill, Manitoba to Rankin Inlet via Arviat. Similar to other Arctic coast communities there is an annual sealift but it is not available to passengers.

Arviat was originally inhabited by the Paallirmiut, a coastal/inland Inuit band. In 1957, dying of starvation, the last remaining Ihalmiut, another Caribou Inuit band, were relocated to Arviat by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Though there are differences between the two bands, they recognize a need to work together in order to benefit the community.

In 1993, Mark Kalluak published a historical essay on soapstone carving in Arviat, entitled &quot;Pelts to Stone. A History of Arts and Crafts Production in Arviat&quot;.

Arviat was featured in &quot;Dancing Towards the Light,&quot; a 2017 CBC News short film and article telling the story of the hamlet&#x27;s annual dance competition.

The community is home to Arviaqpaluk Radio, a community radio station which operates under an exemption from CRTC licensing for low-power broadcasters.

==Politics==
The community is represented in the Legislative Assembly of Nunavut by John Main in the electoral district of Arviat North-Whale Cove, and Joe Savikataaq in Arviat South. Savikataaq was Premier of Nunavut from 2018 to 2021.

Savikataaq&#x27;s son, Joe Savikataaq Jr., became mayor of the community in March 2020, following the death in office of Bob Leonard.

==Recreation==
The Hudson Bay Quest sled-dog race was run from Churchill to Arviat for the first time in 2004.

== Internet ==
The community has been served by the Qiniq network since 2005. Qiniq is a fixed wireless service to homes and businesses, connecting to the outside world via a satellite backbone. The Qiniq network is designed and operated by SSI Micro. In 2017, the network was upgraded to 4G LTE technology, and 2G-GSM for mobile voice.

==Climate==
According to the Köppen climate classification, Arviat has a subarctic climate (Köppen &quot;Dfc&quot;). However, using Nordenskjöld&#x27;s alternate formula for distinguishing Arctic from subarctic climates, it has a polar climate (Köppen &quot;ET&quot;); as expected from this, it is north of the Arctic tree line. Spring is slow to warm up, with June being cooler than September and May cooler than October. With a yearly mean of it is the third-warmest in Nunavut and the maximum of recorded on 22 July 1973 is second only to that of Kugluktuk. Arviat has a yearly rainfall of , the fourth-wettest in Nunavut, but only of snow, the third-least. Temperatures above freezing have never been recorded between 18 November and 17 March, inclusive; conversely, accumulating snow has never been recorded in July or August.

<text>The Bleiburg repatriations (see terminology) were a series of forced repatriations from Allied-occupied Austria of Axis-affiliated individuals to Yugoslavia in May 1945 after the end of World War II in Europe. During World War II, Yugoslavian territory was either annexed or occupied by Axis forces, and as the war came to end, thousands of Axis soldiers and civilian collaborators fled Yugoslavia for Austria as the Yugoslav Army (JA) gradually retook control. When they reached Austria, in accordance with Allied policy, British forces refused to take them into custody and directed them to surrender to the JA instead. The JA subsequently subjected them to death marches back to Yugoslavia, where those who survived were either subject to summary executions or interned in labor camps, where many died due to harsh conditions. The repatriations are named for the Carinthian town of Bleiburg, where the initial British refusal to accept the surrenders occurred, and from which some repatriations were carried out.

On 3 May 1945, the government of the Independent State of Croatia (NDH), a fascist puppet state established in German-occupied Yugoslavia which had undertaken genocidal campaigns against its minority populations, reducing their numbers by the hundreds of thousands, decided to flee to Austria. They initiated the evacuation by ordering the Croatian Armed Forces (HOS) to move there as soon as possible, in order to surrender to British forces. The Axis-aligned Slovene leadership issued similar orders to the Slovene Home Guard on the same day. These forces, accompanied by civilians, joined the German Army Group E and other Axis units in withdrawal; the latter included the XV SS Cossack Cavalry Corps and the remnants of the Montenegrin Chetniks organized in the HOS-commanded Montenegrin National Army.

In the week after the German Instrument of Surrender, which marked the formal end of World War II in Europe, collaborationist forces in Yugoslavia continued to battle the Partisans to avoid encirclement and keep escape routes open. The Slovene-led columns fought their way to the Austrian border near Klagenfurt on 14 May. Their surrender was accepted by the British and they were interned in the nearby Viktring camp. When one of the columns of fleeing HOS troops, who were intermingled with civilians, approached the town of Bleiburg on 15 May, the British refused to accept their surrender. They directed them to surrender to the Partisans, which the HOS leadership did after short negotiations. Other Axis prisoners in British captivity were repatriated to Yugoslavia in the following weeks. The repatriations were canceled by the British on 31 May, following reports of massacres in Yugoslavia. The Yugoslav authorities moved the prisoners on death marches throughout the country to internment and labor camps. Mass executions were carried out, the largest of which were in Tezno (estimated at 15,000 Croatian prisoners of war), Kočevski Rog, Huda Jama and Macelj. In the ensuing Communist rule in Yugoslavia, these massacres and other abuses after the repatriations were a taboo topic and information about the events was suppressed. Public and official commemoration of the victims, which included civilians, did not begin until several decades later.

Historians have been unable to accurately ascertain the number of casualties during and after the repatriations; exact numbers have been the subject of much debate, and assessments are typically in the ranges of tens of thousands. Historians and investigations in Slovenia and Croatia indicate that most of the victims were members of Croatian, Slovene, Montenegrin and Serb collaborationist armed forces. Following the breakup of Yugoslavia, an annual commemoration for the victims has been held in Bleiburg, but has drawn considerable controversy due to Ustaše symbols at the event. Croatian authorities have variously either endorsed that commemoration or initiated other commemorations in Slovenia, while the Austrian authorities have increasingly made moves to prevent it from further happening.

==Terminology==
In Croatia simply &quot;Bleiburg&quot; is the most commonly used term for the events, followed by &quot;Bleiburg Tragedy&quot;, &quot;Bleiburg massacre&quot;, &quot;Bleiburg crime&quot; and &quot;Bleiburg case&quot;. The term &#x27;tragedy&#x27; has also been used in English-language works of authors of Croatian origin. The term &quot;Way of the Cross&quot; (), which equates the events with Jesus&#x27; crucifixion, is a common subjective term, used mostly by Croatians, regarding the events after the repatriations. The latter have been described as &quot;death marches&quot;. The term death marches, unlike many others, is used by international literature on the topic, and Croatian historian Martina Grahek Ravančić discusses the topic of &quot;Bleiburg and the Death Marches&quot;.

In Slovenia, the term &quot;Bleiburg Tragedy&quot; (&quot;Pliberška tragedija&quot;) is the most commonly used, while &quot;Bleiburg Massacre&quot; () and &quot;Viktring tragedy&quot; () are less employed. Viktring was a British camp where the largest number of Slovene prisoners were interned before repatriations took place.

==Background==


When World War II broke out in 1939, the government of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia declared its neutrality. By the beginning of 1941, most of its neighbors joined the Tripartite Pact. Yugoslavia came under strong pressure to join the Axis and the Yugoslav government signed the Pact on 25 March 1941, the year that Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union. But demonstrations broke out in Belgrade against the decision, and on 27 March, the opposition overthrew the government in a coup d&#x27;état. The new Yugoslav government refused to ratify the signing of the Tripartite Pact, though it did not rule it out. Adolf Hitler reacted by launching the invasion of Yugoslavia on 6 April 1941, allied with forces of Italy and Hungary.

On 10 April, German troops entered Zagreb and on the same day, the German-Italian puppet state, the Independent State of Croatia (, NDH), was installed. The Ustaše were put in power by Hitler who appointed Ante Pavelić as the leader (Poglavnik) of the NDH. Yugoslavia capitulated to the Axis powers on 17 April. The Ustaše, a fringe movement in pre-war Croatia, attempted to garner support among ordinary Croats and Bosnian Muslims, but never attracted significant support among the populace. The ceding of territory to Italy was a particular blow to their popularity. Special status was given to the German minority, whose members served in the NDH military forces (Einsatzstaffel), and were organized as an autonomous body. From 1942, German minority members were enlisted in the SS Prinz Eugen division.

Following the occupation and division of Yugoslavia, German and other occupation forces introduced anti-semitic laws in accordance with the Nazi Final Solution plan. In the NDH, the Ustaše enacted their own Race Laws, and embarked on a campaign of genocide against Serbs, who were Orthodox Christian, as well as the Jewish and Roma populations throughout the country. It established a concentration camp system, the largest of which was Jasenovac, where 77,000–100,000 people were murdered, the majority women and children, primarily Serbs, Jews and Roma, but also anti-Fascist Croats and Bosniaks. Around 29–31,000 Jews, or 79% of their pre-war population in the NDH, were exterminated during the Holocaust, mostly by the Ustaše. The Ustaše also murdered nearly the entire Roma population of around 25,000.

The number of Serbs killed by the Ustaše is difficult to determine. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum estimates that the Ustaše killed between 320,000 and 340,000 Serbs. Croatian demographer Vladimir Žerjavić calculated the population losses of Yugoslavia, and estimated the total number of Serb civilian and combatant deaths in the NDH at 322,000. Of the civilian casualties, he estimated that the Ustaše killed 78,000 Serb civilians, in direct terror and in concentration camps, and the rest died at the hands of the German and Italian forces, and of other causes. The Ustaše ethnically cleansed Serbs, killed 154 Orthodox priests, plus 3 bishops, expelled most other Orthodox priests, force-converted 240,000 Serbs to Catholicism by May 1943, slaughtering many Serbs even after conversion. A series of armed Serb revolts against the NDH began in the summer of 1941. Wehrmacht General Edmund Glaise-Horstenau blamed the Ustaše crimes for the uprisings and criticized the government of the NDH. The rebel forces were initially a mixture of Communists and Serb nationalist groups, but rifts and fighting between Partisans and Chetniks soon broke out. Partisans advocated unity among all ethnic groups, and opposed Chetnik killing and ethnic cleansing of Muslims and Croats. In early 1942, NDH Chetniks killed many Partisan commanders in Bosnia, and signed alliances with the Ustaše, to jointly fight the Partisans.

Germany, Italy, and Hungary carved up Slovenia, and set out to entirely wipe out Slovenes as an ethnic group, through mass expulsions and forced assimilation, which the Slovenian historian Božo Repe describes as ethnocide. Nazi Germany planned to expel 260,000 (a third of) Slovenes from areas they occupied, but expelled around 80,000. The bishop of Ljubljana and leading Slovene politicians welcomed Mussolini&#x27;s annexation of Ljubljana Province, while conversely, Axis oppression soon led to armed resistance. The Communist-led resistance began in July 1941. Axis authorities sponsored local collaborationist, anti-communist units, which drew most of their members and were supported by the Catholic Slovene People&#x27;s Party. In 1943, these units were united into the Slovene Home Guard, under the command of SS General Erwin Rösener, who reported directly to Himmler. The Home Guard took an oath to fight with the SS, under the leadership of the Führer, against the Communist guerrillas and their Soviet and Western Allies. Italy set up concentration camps in occupied territory, the largest of which was the Rab concentration camp. An estimated 40,000 Slovenes went through those camps, of whom 7,000 died. During the course of the war in Slovene Lands, mutual terror was practiced by both the Communist-led units and the collaborating forces. In total, around 83–84,000 people lost their lives by the formal end of the war in the Slovene lands, the vast majority killed by the occupation forces. Around 13,200 military and civilian deaths were the result of an inter-Slovene conflict, with collaborators responsible for around 6,000 and Partisans 6,700. Among nearly 30,000 Slovene civilians killed, Partisans were responsible for 4,233 civilian deaths, while the Slovene anti-Partisan, in independent actions or in collaboration with Axis forces, caused the deaths of 1,236 civilians. The latter number does not include civilians that Slovene collaborators turned over to the Axis and were killed or died in Axis concentration camps. (e.g. Slovene collaborators put together lists of Slovene political prisoners and assisted in their deportation to Nazi concentration camps).

Serbia was invaded and partitioned by Germany, Italy, Hungary, Bulgaria, and the NDH. Rump Serbian territory was placed under German military administration, with the help of a civil puppet government led by Milan Nedić. In response to a large, Communist-led uprising in Serbia, the German military in just two months executed 30,000 Serb civilians and Jews. Remnants of the Royal Yugoslav Army organized the Serbian monarchist Chetniks were the first resistance movement. The Chetniks were led by Draža Mihailović and were recognized by the Yugoslav government-in-exile. While it was anti-Axis in its long-term goals and engaged in marginal resistance activities for limited periods, the Chetniks also engaged in collaboration with the occupying forces for almost all of the war. The Chetniks were partners in the terror and counter-terror that occurred in Yugoslavia during WWII. The terror tactics against the communist Partisans and their supporters was ideologically driven. The Chetniks sought the creation of a Greater Serbia by cleansing non-Serbs, mainly Muslims and Croats, from territories that would be incorporated into their post-war state, and carried out genocide against Muslims and Croats during this period. An estimated 18,000–32,000 Croats and 29,000–33,000 Muslims were killed by the Chetniks.

The Communist Party of Yugoslavia (KPJ) remained largely inactive while the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact between Germany and the Soviet Union was in effect. During this period, the Soviet Union pursued friendly relations with Germany and considered recognizing the NDH. Following the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, Communist-led Yugoslav Partisans issued a call for an uprising. Josip Broz Tito was the supreme commander of the Partisan forces. The Communist leadership saw the war as an opportunity for a revolution and an establishment of a Soviet-style totalitarian regime. Until the 1st half of 1942, during a period described as &quot;red terror&quot;, their units were engaged in the mass killing of perceived class enemies, a policy that threatened their popular support. The leadership then changed this approach and focused less on class warfare, until the postwar period.

The Chetniks and the Partisans, the two main guerrilla resistance units, initially cooperated against the Axis, but their cooperation soon fell apart, and they turned against each other. Due to the Chetniks&#x27; collaboration with the Axis, Allied support shifted to the Partisan side. In 1943, the Allies officially recognized the Partisans as an Allied fighting force. Winston Churchill highlighted the strength and importance of the Partisans and advised the Yugoslav government to reach an agreement with Tito, whose forces generated an appeal among all ethnic groups.

==End of the war==

The arrival of Soviet ground troops in the Belgrade Offensive and Allied logistical support enabled the Partisans to increase their offensive actions. By the end of 1944, with the help of the Red Army, they established control in Serbia, North Macedonia, Montenegro and Dalmatia. German forces retreated from Serbia, together with Nedić&#x27;s forces. The Wehrmacht and the HOS established a front in Syrmia to secure the retreat of the German Army Group E from the Balkans. The Partisans conducted mass killings of POWs and ethnic Germans after securing control of Serbia. The Communist leadership adopted a political decision on the expulsion of the German national minority, whom they held collectively responsible for Nazi crimes, and the confiscation of their property. Germany attempted to evacuate the entire German population from Yugoslavia to the Reich, but in late 1944 there were still around 150,000 Germans in Partisan-controlled Vojvodina. By May 1945, most were interned in over 40 concentration camps in the region, in which around 46,000 died.

In May 1944, Tito founded an intelligence service known as the Department for People&#x27;s Protection (OZNA), modeled after the Soviet NKVD. It represented a military intelligence service and a political secret police of the Communist Party. In August 1944, he founded an army unit called the People&#x27;s Defence Corps of Yugoslavia (&quot;Korpus narodne odbrane Jugoslavije&quot;, KNOJ), whose explicit assignment was to &quot;liquidate Chetnik, Ustaša, White Guard and other anti-people gangs&quot;.

With the growth of the Partisans, who provided Croats an alternative that appeared more in Croatia&#x27;s national interest, and the general dissatisfaction with the Ustaše and Nazi German authorities, the NDH had serious difficulties in mobilizing new troops. When in August 1944, a coup d&#x27;état against Ante Pavelić, known as the Lorković–Vokić plot, failed, its conspirators were arrested or executed. The main plotters wanted to align NDH with the Allies. The outcome of the plot caused further demoralization. As the war progressed, the desertion rate in the NDH armed force increased, especially among the Croatian Home Guard, the regular army. The Chetniks showed similar signs of desertion.

On 30 August 1944, Tito offered amnesty to Croatian Home Guards, Slovene Home Guards, and Chetniks if they chose to defect to the Partisan side by 15 September. After 15 September, all who had not defected were to be brought to &quot;people&#x27;s courts&quot;. Similar calls were repeated several times after the deadline. In some cases, Croatian Home Guards were killed despite defecting to the Partisans. On the day when the amnesty expired, Tito instructed his subordinates to continue accepting late defectors. A day earlier, King Peter II issued a call to the Chetniks to put themselves under the command of the Partisans. Large-scale defections of Chetniks to the Partisans followed.

The Armed Forces of the Independent State of Croatia (HOS) were reorganized in November 1944 to combine the units of the Ustaše and Croatian Home Guard. Throughout the war, the treatment of Croatian Home Guard prisoners was relatively benign Partisans would ridicule the captured &quot;domobran&quot; soldiers and send them home if they did not want to join the uprising. But, on 13 January 1945, Pavelić ordered the &quot;domobrani&quot; to merge with the Ustaša military, creating a force estimated at 280,000.

Some Chetniks, such as those of Momčilo Đujić&#x27;s Dinara Division, continued collaborating with the Axis. Đujić&#x27;s forces fought alongside the Germans and HOS in late 1944 in the battle of Knin against the Partisan 8th Dalmatian Corps. The battle ended in Partisan victory, and the Dinara Division began withdrawing to Slovenia. Pavelić issued an order to provide safe passage to Đujić&#x27;s troops, and gave them directions of movement. As the path led to Partisan-held territory, and Đujić did not trust Pavelić due to earlier examples of the Ustaše killing Chetniks passing through the NDH, he took an alternate route in agreement with the local Wehrmacht commanders.

After the surrender of Italy in 1943, the Germans sought to reestablish a Slovenian anti-Partisan collaborationist militia, on the basis of a previously Italian backed unit. It was hoped such a force would help the German occupation combat the growing Partisan resistance movement in Ljubljana Province. This led to the founding of the Slovene Home Guard, staffed largely by supporters of an assortment of anti-Communist Slovene political movements, particularly the Slovene People&#x27;s Party. While they eventually hoped to win the support of the Allies, these anti-Communists were more concerned by the threat of a post-war Communist government in Yugoslavia. Their collaboration with the German occupiers made any future compromise with the Allies untenable, which would have significant repercussions when Slovene Home Guard fighters tried to surrender to the British in May 1945.

In September 1944, at the urging of Western Allies, Slovene members of the Yugoslav government-in-exile in London, called on the Slovene Home Guard to transfer its allegiance to the Partisans. Despite this and Partisan amnesty offers, most Home Guards continued fighting on the German side. In March 1945, Slovene collaborationist leaders, Leon Rupnik and Bishop Rožman, proposed a military-political alliance to the Ustaše leader Ante Pavelić and the Chetniks, to continue fighting the Partisans.

By 1945, the Yugoslav Partisans were known as the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army, and numbered more than 800,000 men organized into five field armies. They pursued the remnant of the defeated German and NDH forces.

In March 1945, the 4th Yugoslav Army advanced through Lika, Croatian Littoral and Kvarner Gulf. Most of Bosnia and Herzegovina was in Partisan hands by the end of April. On 12 April, the Syrmian Front was broken and the 1st and 3rd Armies advanced west through Slavonia. Only the northwestern part of NDH, with Zagreb as its center, remained under control of NDH authorities. Numerous refugees had gathered there from other parts of NDH. The Partisans carried out reprisals against captured soldiers of the HOS, as well as thousands of suspected civilian political opponents.

==Axis retreat==

The collapse of the Syrmian front in April 1945 accelerated the withdrawal of German forces, which had been retreating from the Balkans since October 1944. Like other Axis troops, forces of the NDH did not want to surrender to the Red Army or the Yugoslav Partisans. They retreated through Slovenia trying to reach the Yugoslav-Austrian border, in order to surrender to the British forces advancing north from Italy. A large-scale exodus of people was planned and organized by the authorities of the NDH although there was no strategic benefit to it: there was no viable destination for all the population. The NDH government&#x27;s decision to organize a retreat was reached on 3 May. On the same day, the Slovene National Council, established by anti-Partisan forces in October 1944, convened a parliament in Ljubljana and proclaimed a Slovene state within the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. The Slovene Home Guard and other anti-communist forces were joined into the Slovene National Army, as part of Mihailović&#x27;s Chetniks. The parliament called on Partisans and all Slovenes to cease hostilities, and appealed to the Western Allies for aid. The parliament ordered a retreat to Austria, where they hoped to be accepted by the British as prisoners or as allies in the fight against the Soviets and the Partisans.

Some in the NDH and Slovene political and military leadership believed that the Western Allies would use them as anti-Communist forces and support them in returning to Yugoslavia and regaining power. Slovenian Bishop Gregorij Rožman appealed to the Allies to occupy Slovenia and prevent the Communists from taking power. The NDH leadership abolished racial laws and sent a request for collaboration with the Allies on 6 May, but all of these efforts failed. While the NDH leadership may have organized a civilian retreat to bolster their claims that the Yugoslav Communists were after innocent civilian victims, the sheer number of civilians slowed down the retreat, and made surrender to the Allies unfeasible. Some observers believed the government was using the civilians as a human shield against the Ustaše. The majority of the civilian refugees reportedly held anti-Communist views or feared reprisals.

Divisions of three Yugoslav armies were pursuing the Axis forces. Some units of the Yugoslav 4th Army managed to reach Carinthia before or at the same time as the retreating columns. Additional divisions of the 3rd and 4th Armies were sent to the area in order to capture southern Carinthia and prevent the Axis retreat. The 1st and 2nd Armies were halted near Celje, while the 3rd Army advanced further in pursuit of the retreating columns.

On 6 May 1945, the government of the NDH fled Zagreb and reached a site near Klagenfurt, Austria on 7 May. Pavelić and the military leadership left Zaprešić on the evening of 7 May, intending to join the rest of the NDH regime in Austria. The bulk of the NDH leadership, including Pavelić, escaped in early May, fleeing to Western Europe and Latin America. Partisans captured only a small number of senior military NDH officers.

Zagreb was defended by parts of the 1st Division of the Army of NDH and the 41st and 181st German Divisions, deployed along the unfinished fortified &quot;Zvonimir line&quot; between Sveti Ivan Žabno and Ivanić-Grad. The fierce battle with the Yugoslav 1st Army lasted from 5–8 May. The single bloodiest day in the 1,240-day long history of the 1st Proletarian Brigade was 7 May, with 158 killed and 358 wounded in the fighting for Vrbovec.

Besides the HOS, Slovene Home Guard and the German Army Group E, other military units were retreating. The remnants of the Serbian State Guard, two regiments of the Serbian Volunteer Corps, and a group of Chetniks surrendered to the British near the Italian-Yugoslav border on 5 May. These units were not repatriated to Yugoslavia. The Montenegrin National Army, formed in April 1945 by Sekula Drljević with the support of the NDH government, to gather Montenegrins from NDH in the unit, were retreating together with Croatian forces. Thousands of Russian Cossacks of the XVth SS Cossack Cavalry Corps, stationed in Yugoslavia since 1943, were also retreating to Austria.

On 7 May 1945, Germany surrendered unconditionally to the Allied powers, marking the practical end of World War II in Europe. The German Instrument of Surrender applied to German Wehrmacht forces in Yugoslavia, as well as to other armed forces under German control, such as the Croatian Armed Forces. Ordinarily this would have meant that they, too, had to cease their activities on 8 May and stay where they found themselves. The military of NDH, however, came under the command of Pavelić. As the Germans were about to surrender, General Alexander Löhr, Commander-in-Chief of Army Group E, handed command of the Croatian forces to Pavelić on 8 May. Pavelić issued an order from Rogaška Slatina for his troops not to surrender to the Partisans, but to escape to Austria, to implement the NDH government&#x27;s decision of 3 May to flee to Austria. Following the capitulation of Germany, Tito issued an address via Radio Belgrade on 9 May calling upon all armed collaborators to surrender, threatening &quot;merciless response&quot; from the people and the army should they refuse to do so.

Most of the German and HOS troops had withdrawn from Zagreb by 8 May, when units of the Partisan 1st and 2nd Armies took control of it. There were relatively few skirmishes and casualties in the city. The 1st Army reported to the General Staff that 10,901 enemy soldiers had been killed and 15,892 captured in taking Zagreb, without specifying battles in which these casualties occurred. That same day, the headquarters of the 51st Vojvodina Division of the Yugoslav 3rd Army issued a dispatch ordering its units to consider all enemy forces who continued resistance after midnight that day, and who were not part of units who had an organized surrender, as persons who did not have the status of prisoners of war, and to treat them as &quot;bandits&quot;. The German surrender obstructed the progress of the columns fleeing Croatia northward. By 9 May, Partisan forces had moved into Maribor, which eliminated that escape route. They also took control of Celje on 10 May, but with a force insufficient to halt the columns that were escaping towards Dravograd.

===Escape route to Klagenfurt-Viktring===
The Slovene Home Guard and Slovene civilians primarily used the route across the Loibl Pass. Around 30,000 soldiers, including 10,000 to 12,000 Slovene Home Guards, 10,000 Germans, 4,000 Serbs, 4,000 members of the Russian Corps, and 6,000 Slovene civilians, were withdrawing to Austria. The road to Loibl (&quot;Ljubelj&quot;) was congested with loaded cars, trucks, wagons, and horse carts. Battles with the Partisans also slowed the retreat.

After passing the Loibl Pass, the columns were headed to the Drava Bridge at Hollenburg. The British were located north of the bridge. The bridge was guarded by German soldiers and was attacked by the Partisans on 7 May. Partisan reinforcements arrived on the following day and set a barrier between Ferlach and Hollenburg, while units of the 4th Motorized Division and the 26th Division of the 4th Army were approaching Ferlach from the west. The Axis troops and civilians were surrounded and tried to fight their way through the blockades. Some German troops surrendered to the Partisans in the Rosental Valley, in accordance with the German instrument of surrender.

On 10 May, the main breakthrough attempt took place. The assault was carried out by the Slovene Home Guard, led by Major Vuk Rupnik, and the 7th SS Division &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; and SS police units. A radio contact was established with the British, who were ready to accept them if they crossed the Drava. The British refrained from engaging the Axis units fighting the Partisans. On 11 May, the Slovene Home Guard and SS troops launched an infantry attack on the town of Ferlach and took control of it on the evening. The Partisans reported 180 casualties. The remaining Partisan units in the vicinity were repelled, and the column of troops and refugees began crossing the Drava River. They were taken by the British to the Viktring camp near Klagenfurt. By 14 May, all units of the Slovene Home Guard surrendered to the British.

===Escape route to Bleiburg===

Croat troops and civilians mostly used escape routes toward Mežica and Bleiburg, and across the Kamnik Alps toward the Jaun Valley in Austria. The main Croatian column moved through the towns of Zidani Most, Celje, Šoštanj, and Slovenj Gradec. On 11 May, the vanguard of the column reached Dravograd. The bridges across the Drava River were barricaded by Bulgarian units that had reached the area on 9 May.

On 11–12 May, generals Vjekoslav Servatzy and Vladimir Metikoš entered discussions with Bulgarian generals to allow the Croatian column to pass into Austria. The discussions were inconclusive, but the Bulgarians suggested they head in the direction of Prevalje and Bleiburg, which the column did. Bleiburg was located some four kilometres northwest of the border of Austria and Yugoslavia. Parts of the columns that had weak or no protection were attacked by the Partisans - on 12 May, &quot;Politika&quot; carried Yugoslav Army reports of 15,700 prisoners of war in Maribor, Zidani Most, Bled, Jesenice and elsewhere. On 13 May, they reported over 40,000 prisoners taken near Rogaška Slatina, Celje, Velenje, Šoštanj, Dravograd, and elsewhere.

The main column was encircled in the Dravograd pocket. The Croatian Armed Forces had artillery positions in a five kilometers linear distance from Dravograd to the south and used howitzers to fire on positions of the Yugoslav Army. On the night of 13 May, the elite HOS infantry units, commanded by General Rafael Boban, managed to break through the Partisan blockade and the column moved west through Ravne na Koroškem and Poljana towards Bleiburg. A large number of Croat soldiers and civilians reached the field at Bleiburg on 14 May. The headquarters of the British 38th (Irish) Brigade were set up in Bleiburg, having occupied the town on 12 May, while the rest of the V Corps was stationed in Klagenfurt.

==Surrender at Bleiburg==

The main group of HOS troops and Croat civilians reached the Bleiburg field on 15 May. They were the head of the 45-65 kilometres-long columns, numbering around 25,000 to 30,000 people. The group included various branches of the NDH army, including the Air Force, HOS, and civilian refugees. Most of them camped near the local railroad embankment. The Montenegrin National Army was placed east of the embankment. Around 175,000 people were still on Yugoslav territory and moving towards Bleiburg. Negotiations between representatives of the HOS, the Yugoslav Army and the British were held on the same day in the Bleiburg Castle. The British negotiator was Brigadier Thomas Scott of the 38th (Irish) Brigade. Ustaša infantry general Ivo Herenčić of the V Ustaša Corps, and a translator, Colonel Danijel Crljen, were involved in the surrender negotiations.

In the afternoon of the same day, the Croatian forces started raising white flags in surrender. The Partisan representatives included Major-General Milan Basta, the political commissar of the 51st Vojvodina Division, and Lieutenant Colonel Ivan Kovačič Efenka of the 14th Attack Division. NDH military representatives attempted to negotiate a surrender to the British, but were directed to surrender to the Yugoslav military. The Independent State of Croatia had joined the Geneva Convention on 20 January 1943, and was recognised by it as a &quot;belligerent&quot;.

The Partisan forces of the 51st Vojvodina Division of the Yugoslav 3rd Army and the 14th Slovenian Division had established tactical control over the field of Bleiburg. Milan Basta set an ultimatum to the NDH negotiators - unconditional surrender within one hour, or else they would attack them and not uphold the norms of the international conventions of the Red Cross. Basta&#x27;s ultimatum was extended for another fifteen minutes, after which point a general surrender started. Basta gave Scott assurances that the prisoners would be treated humanely and that only &quot;political criminals&quot; would be tried by courts.
The exact events after the expiry of the ultimatum are the source of the original controversy regarding the repatriations. Teodor Pavić, described as a NDH &quot;courier&quot;, wrote that the Partisan forces began strafing the crowd in the Bleiburg field with machine guns and shooting them individually. Petar Brajović, a Yugoslav officer, described a fifteen- to twenty-minute machine gun and mortar fire on the column. Strle wrote that the 3rd Battalion of the 11th &quot;Zidanšek&quot; Brigade and the 3rd Battalion of the 1st &quot;Tomšič&quot; Brigade were involved in the fire, and their records noted at least 16 deaths, mainly from the machine gun fire. A Croatian soldier who survived, Zvonimir Zorić, wrote of a massacre at Bleiburg.

The notion of a massacre at the Bleiburg field was promoted by the remnants of the Ustaša in exile. Croatian-American historian Jozo Tomasevich notes that it would have been physically impossible to assemble all the Croatian refugees in Bleiburg itself, so German and Croatian troops who are said to have surrendered &quot;in Bleiburg&quot; must have done so in various localities, including Bleiburg, and certainly not all in Bleiburg itself. He considers it impossible to establish the exact number of troops and civilians who tried to flee to Austria and were forced to surrender to the Partisans, and stresses that the number of victims has been inflated by pro-Ustaša sources for propaganda purposes, while communist sources have been diminishing it for similar reasons. Croatian historian Martina Grahek Ravančić wrote that the complete extent of the casualties sustained by the NDH column at Bleiburg on the day of the surrender was not described in any available sources. She described a short Yugoslav Army attack on the column as a certainty, likewise that there were casualties, but the number is unknown.

Strle and Milan Basta claimed that as Ustaša forces tried to make a breakthrough at the north side of the valley, three British tanks moved to stop them, reportedly resulting in several casualties. However, only three Croatians provided testimony which supported the notion that there were British tanks in the proximity of the column, but with no mention of such an incident. Tomasevich writes that these kinds of unconfirmed reports of British military involvement, coupled with the legitimate acts of repatriation, were subsequently exaggerated by Ustaša supporters, particularly in the Croatian diaspora. They published biased works that falsely accused the British of &quot;turning a blind eye&quot; to the actions of the Partisans.

Later the same day, NDH generals Slavko Štancer, Vjekoslav Servatzy, and Vladimir Metikoš oversaw the surrender to the Partisans. British army reports say Štancer had previously been captured by the Partisans when they strayed from the column, seeking the British. The surrender continued for several days and at various locations; it took until 21 May for Tito to order the Partisans to withdraw from Carinthia.

==Other Carinthian repatriations==
Several other repatriations took place elsewhere in Carinthia during May 1945. Yugoslav intelligence officer Simo Dubajić negotiated with British forces about the organization of surrender and repatriation elsewhere along the Yugoslav-Austrian border. The extradition of Croat internees of the Viktring and Krumpendorf prisoner-of-war camps, located north of the Drava River, began on 18 May. The prisoners were assured that they were being transported to Italy. The repatriation took place in the village of Rosenbach and the town of Eberndorf. The transports continued on 19 May when Rosenbach and Lavamünd, northeast of Bleiburg, were used as extradition places, while some were transported to Bleiburg. Internees of the Grafenstein camp were also transported. Thousands more were handed over in the following days, mostly in Rosenbach and the Bleiburg railway station. The last transport was on 23 May when 800 Croat prisoners from Grafenstein were taken by rail to Bleiburg. British war diary records note that the extraditions of Croats ended on 24 May.

The transports of Serbs and Montenegrins followed on 24 May, with three regiments of the Serbian Volunteer Corps. The first repatriation of larger groups of Slovene prisoners took place on 27 May, together with the remaining Serbs and Montenegrins. The repatriation of Slovenes also took place in Rosenbach or Bleiburg, except for the severely wounded that were accommodated in a hospital in Klagenfurt. The Slovenes were also told by the British that they will be transported to camps in Italy. The last Slovene group was handed over on 31 May. The following day, 2,700 Slovene civilians were scheduled to be transported to the border, but the transport was stopped by the British due to reports of massacres in Yugoslavia. All repatriations were canceled and a decision was made that only those who wanted to return to Yugoslavia would be transported. According to an estimate of the British V Corps, a total of 26,339 people were extradited from the camps by 30 May, including 12,196 Croats, 8,263 Slovenes, 5,480 Serbs, and 400 Montenegrins.

On the evening of 20 May, a group of NDH troops appeared near Ferlach, located approximately west of Bleiburg, and attempted to set terms for their passage west. &quot;As the Ustaše did not want to surrender&quot; reads the operational diary of the 2nd Battalion of the Partisan 11th Dalmatian Assault Brigade, &quot;we attacked them at 21:00 hrs. On this occasion we took 24 Ustaše soldiers and one officer&quot;. British forces repatriated around 40,000 Cossacks to the Soviet Union&#x27;s SMERSH, near Graz. The repatriation of Cossacks to the Soviet Union from camps near Lienz began on 28 May.

==Allied stance==
At the Yalta Conference on 11 February 1945, an agreement was reached on the repatriation of citizens from the signatory states, the US, the UK, and the USSR, to their country of origin. As Yugoslavia was not a signatory, the repatriation of Yugoslav citizens was not mentioned in the agreement. At the time of the Axis retreat from occupied Yugoslavia, the British V Corps of the Eighth Army was stationed in southern Austria, which was within the area of authority of Field Marshal Harold Alexander. The Yugoslav Army reached southern Carinthia in early May and declared it a part of Yugoslavia. This caused strained relations with the British, who supported an independent Austria in prewar borders. Due to Yugoslav refusal to withdraw from Austrian Carinthia, as well as from the Italian city of Trieste, the possibility of an armed conflict between the British forces and the Partisans emerged.

The Western Allies did not expect the movement of a large number of people in the V Corps area. The retreat of larger groups of &quot;anti-Tito forces&quot; was reported by Ralph Stevenson, the British ambassador in Belgrade, on 27 April. There was no consensus among British authorities on how to deal with them. Stevenson recommended their internment in camps rather than repatriation. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill agreed with Stevenson&#x27;s suggestion as &quot;the only possible solution&quot;. The 8th Army issued an order on 3 May that Axis forces from Yugoslavia &quot;will be regarded as surrendered personnel and will be treated accordingly. The ultimate disposal of these personnel will be decided on Government levels&quot;. Until 14 May, the British accepted the surrender of thousands of retreating troops and civilians.

A report to the V Corps from 13 May noted the movement of hundreds of thousands of people towards Austria. On the following day, the V Corps estimated that once the columns arrived, the food situation would become critical, and cited an insufficient number of guards to manage the people. Harold Macmillan, the British Minister Resident in the Mediterranean, recommended the immediate transfer of Cossacks to the Soviet Union. Regarding the column that was approaching Bleiburg, the brigade stationed in the town was instructed to &quot;keep it south of the Drava&quot;. Brian Robertson, Alexander&#x27;s Chief Administrative Officer, issued an order to the 8th British Army on 14 May to hand over all surrendered Axis personnel of Yugoslav nationality to the Yugoslav Army. The order excluded Chetniks, who were to be transferred to Italy. The repatriations were opposed by Alexander Kirk, American political advisor to the Supreme Headquarters (SHAEF), who asked the US State Department for advice. Joseph Grew, the US Under Secretary of State, agreed with Kirk and instructed him to inform the Allied Force Headquarters (AFHQ) of &quot;violation of the agreed Anglo-American policy&quot;.

The AFHQ contacted the Yugoslav authorities on 15 May regarding the repatriation of &quot;Yugoslavs&quot;. In line with the orders received by 15 May, the V Corps rejected the surrender of the column at Bleiburg. At the same time, the V Corps entered negotiations with Yugoslav representatives regarding the repatriation of other POWs and the withdrawal of the Yugoslav Army from Carinthia. An agreement was reached for the Yugoslav withdrawal on 21 May. The repatriations began earlier, on 18 May.

A November 1945 report from the British Foreign Office noted that it had not yet been decided on a high level whether the prisoners should be transferred to Yugoslavia. Local British commanders were given imprecise and contradictory orders. On 17 May, Brigadier Toby Low, Chief of Staff of the V Corps, ordered that &quot;all Yugoslav nationals at present in Corps area will be handed over to Tito forces as soon as possible. These forces will be disarmed immediately but will NOT be told of their destination&quot;. Several hours later, an order arrived from Alexander to evacuate all Yugoslav prisoners to northern Italy. On the same day, Alexander sent a telegram to the Combined Chiefs of Staff, in which he wrote that to return the prisoners to their country of origin &quot;might be fatal to their health&quot;.

Instructions and provisions made by the Allies in the following days frequently conflicted. Two conflicting instructions from the AFHQ arrived on 23 May: the first was to return the Yugoslav citizens from the 8th Army area to Yugoslavia unless it involved the use of force. The second instruction was that Yugoslav citizens should not be returned to Yugoslavia against their will, and that they should be &quot;moved to suitable concentration area and screened&quot;. The confusion in the line of command led to a series of meetings between the AFHQ representatives and the 8th Army. The conclusion of the meetings on 27 May was an implicit support to the policy of not telling the prisoners their destination, the non-use of force, and that &quot;it was unwise to make any further interpretation&quot;. The repatriations continued until 31 May, when they were canceled following the appeal of the head of the Viktring camp and the local British Red Cross. The repatriations were the topic of much subsequent debate.

==March back==


Representatives of the HOS of NDH accepted the surrender on 15 May at 16:00 hours. After the immediate repatriation of the soldiers at Bleiburg was complete, the Yugoslav forces began disarming them and started preparations for transporting the prisoners back. A large number of columns of prisoners were formed in rows of four that were sent on a forced march through Slovenia. Due to the presence of the British Army, the initial treatment of prisoners was correct. However, it got worse as the columns moved away from the border. The prisoners were given no food or water and were looted of valuables. Those who lagged behind were shot. Individual killings and executions of smaller groups of men soon began. The columns were in Dravograd directed to Maribor or Slovenj Gradec and Celje. On 17 May, the British started the repatriation of Croat internees of the Viktring camp, mostly members of the HOS.

The columns marching towards Maribor, where transit camps were set, were moving along the Drava River. During the march, bodies could be seen floating in the Drava and on the banks of the river. The first prisoners arrived in Maribor on 17 May and were placed in transit camps. Other larger columns arrived in the following two days. At the camps, prisoners were sorted based on their unit and year of enlistment. A part of the prisoners were sent on further marches or transported with trains to Celje and Zagreb. The rest were brought by trucks to anti-tank trenches in Tezno near Maribor, with their hands tied with wire, where they were lined up and killed. The killings lasted for several days until the trenches were filled with dead bodies. A total of 1,179 bodies were recovered, with estimates that 15,000 people may have been killed in the Tezno massacre, largely members of the HOS. Among them were also some members of the Montenegrin National Army and POWs of other units.

Prisoners directed from Bleiburg to the town of Slovenj Gradec were joined by a large number of refugees that were stuck on the Dravograd-Slovenj Gradec road. Several transit camps were set in the town where prisoners were placed and sorted. Around 1,500 were killed in the nearby village of Žančani. The prisoners were only briefly held in Slovenj Gradec, mostly a day, before they continued their way to Celje. Anyone who stepped out of the column to take a rest or drink water was shot. Those that were too exhausted to continue the march were also shot. In Celje, most of the prisoners were placed in a football yard on the outskirts of the city. The command of the 11th Krajina Division of the 1st Army reported on 17 May that they received 30,000 prisoners. Anti-tank trenches near the Sava River and in the area of Bukovžlak were used for executions. Prisoners were killed in various ways; on one occasion around 100-200 were locked in an enclosed water reservoir. Water was then slowly released until all of them drowned.

A column of 40,000 people, consisting primarily of Croat soldiers, moved from Celje to Zidani Most on 18 May. A part of the captives were separated there, and led to the nearby forests and killed. The column reached Samobor on 20 May. They were not given food during the trip, but locals left them food and water by the road. Prisoners were placed in several smaller camps and prisons in the town, where selections were made again. Most of the prisoners were from Samobor sent to Zagreb and led through the city by foot. Trains with prisoners from other locations, mostly from Maribor, were also coming to Zagreb. The city&#x27;s transit camps were not suitable for the accommodation of a large number of people, so many prisoners were placed in yards. The camps were surrounded with wire fences, behind which citizens gathered, bringing food or seeking relatives and friends. One of the largest camps in the area was in Prečko. Prisoners were given food there, albeit not regularly. Around 50 died of hunger and illness. Aleksandar Ranković, the chief of the intelligence service, was dissatisfied with the pace of executions in Zagreb and sent a letter to the Croatian branch of the OZNA, demanding greater resoluteness. An increased number of arrests of Zagreb&#x27;s citizens followed during June and July 1945.

The repatriation of Slovene and Serb internees from Viktring began on 24 May. The transports of around 11,000 Slovene Home Guards and 600 Slovene civilians were done in two directions: from Rosenbach in Austria to Jesenice, who were then imprisoned in internment camps in Kranj, Škofja Loka or Šentvid, and from Bleiburg to Celje, where the Teharje camp was located. The prisoners were beaten and many were killed on the way. The transport and liquidations were carried out by the Corps of People&#x27;s Defence of Yugoslavia (KNOJ) and the Department for People&#x27;s Protection (OZNA). Internees of the Šentvid camp were taken to the Kočevje region, where thousands were killed and disposed of in caves, pits and ravines in the Kočevski Rog massacre. Internees of the Teharje camp were killed in its vicinity and in the surrounding caves and mines, including the Barbara Pit coal mine. Out of 5,000 Slovene Home Guards brought to Teharje, almost all were dead by August 1945. A total of 800 Slovene Home Guards and civilians were executed at Podutik near Ljubljana. The decomposing bodies at the location contaminated Ljubljana&#x27;s water supply, so a group of German POWs were ordered to relocate the bodies to a new mass grave.

The OZNA reported that the main movement of columns of prisoners from Slovenia and the Austrian border was carried out by 8 June. Most of the columns reached their destination where permanent camps were located, 12 of which were in Croatia and 11 in Vojvodina. According to the report, there were a total of 175,922 prisoners. On 25 June, Deputy Prime Minister of Yugoslavia Edvard Kardelj sent a dispatch to Slovenian Prime Minister Boris Kidrič, requesting him to speed up the liquidations as a general amnesty will soon be passed. The decree &quot;on general amnesty and pardon&quot; for Chetniks, the Serbian State Guard, Croatian and Slovene Home Guard, and Albanian and Muslim militia, was adopted on 3 August. According to a report from February 1946, 41,320 prisoners were granted amnesty based on this decision. All those who had been discharged from camps had to contact their local authorities. Some faced trials and sentences to prison or forced labor. Others were under surveillance of the KNOJ and the secret police. On 2 March 1946, the Supreme Command of the Yugoslav Army ordered the release of &quot;all Yugoslav nationalities - members of enemy military formations, except those against whom criminal proceedings have been initiated.&quot; Internment and labor camps continued to operate in the following years. The purges that started at the end of the war continued until the early 1950s.

==Coverage and aftermath==
The events in the aftermath of the war were censored in Yugoslavia. Mass graves were concealed or destroyed, in accordance with an order by the Federal Ministry of Interior Affairs from 18 May 1945. Relatives of the victims faced persecution and were treated as second class groups. Until the 1950s, there were strict border controls in Yugoslavia, but tens of thousands of people emigrated illegally.

It was not possible to visit the graves located in Yugoslavia, so Bleiburg in Austria became the main location where political emigrants, survivors, or families of the victims could gather and hold a commemoration. The first commemoration on the fields of Bleiburg was in 1952 on All Saints&#x27; Day. Since then, the Bleiburg Honorary Guard (&quot;Počasni bleiburški vod&quot;), an association founded by former members of the Ustaše, organized an annual commemorative event, together with the Catholic Church in Carinthia. The Yugoslav consulate in Klagenfurt sent diplomatic protests to the Austrian government, but the commemorations were never banned by Austria. The commemoration was seen as a provocation by Yugoslavia. Prohibited Croatian symbols were openly displayed and it drew attention to postwar killings which the Yugoslav authorities denied. The Bleiburg events were also used as a tool for historical revisionism and the focus of collective resentment by the remainder of the Ustaše and their supporters. The number of victims was artificially inflated.

The Yugoslav State Security Administration (UDBA) monitored the activities of the participants of the commemorative event and conducted a series of attacks on its organizers. During the ceremony in 1966, a bomb exploded in a country inn in Loibach, but none of the attendants was injured. Nikica Martinović, the chairman of the Bleiburg Honorary Guard, was assassinated by the UDBA in Klagenfurt in 1975. The following year a bomb was found in front of the tavern of Mirko Karačić, also a member of the Bleiburg Honorary Guard. In spite of the threats and attacks, the commemoration continued to be held annually until the breakup of Yugoslavia.

Gatherings and commemorations were also held in other countries. In 1960, on the 15th anniversary commemoration held in Cleveland, the Bleiburg Tragedy Research Committee was founded by Croatian emigrants. In 1961, the commemoration in Cleveland was attended by US Congressman Michael A. Feighan. The Yugoslav consul in Pittsburgh, Ivan Mirošević, protested against it and requested the gathering to be banned. Feighan criticized the consul and Josip Broz Tito during his speech at the commemoration. Mirošević was expelled from the US for his comments. In 1965, commemorating the 20th anniversary, US Senator Frank Lausche condemned the post-war killings in Yugoslavia. Organizations of Croatian emigrants in Germany and USA requested a Red Cross investigation of mass grave sites, which was rejected by Yugoslavia.

In 1976, a marble monument was erected in the Unter-Loibach cemetery and in 1987, a monument was erected on the Bleiburg field with the inscription &quot;In Honor and Glory of the Fallen Croatian Army, May 1945&quot; in Croatian and German language. The monument had the Croatian coat of arms and the Islamic star and crescent engraved.

===Investigations of mass graves===

Discussions about the post-war massacres were forbidden in Yugoslavia, so the investigations of mass grave locations began only in the 1990s, after the fall of communism. In 1992, 1,163 bodies were excavated from 23 mass graves in the forests of Macelj, leaving around 130 possible mass grave locations unexplored. In 2002, the Slovenian government established the Governmental Committee for Settlement of Questions on Secret Mass Graves, with the assignment of &quot;recording of data about the number and locations of mass graves&quot; after the end of World War II.

The Tezno mass graves near Maribor were discovered in 1999 during the construction of a motorway. 1,179 corpses were excavated from a 70 meter long part of the trench. In 2007, the Commission on Concealed Mass Graves in Slovenia, founded in 2005, analyzed the entire Tezno trench and found human remains at a length of 940 metres, estimated to contain the remains of around 15,000 victims. In 2009, the Barbara Pit near Huda Jama in Slovenia was uncovered, and 726 human remains were exhumed by December 2009. The same year, more pits were uncovered on two locations near the Croatian-Slovenian border, one near the village of Harmica and the other near Gornji Hrašćan, estimated to hold, together, around 4,500 bodies.

By mid 2008, 581 concealed grave sites were registered by the Slovenian Commission on Concealed Mass Graves. The number rose to more than 600 grave sites in 2010. The commission estimates that there are around 100,000 victims in those graves in Slovenia alone. Unlike in Slovenia, there was no serious research of mass graves in Croatia by the Croatian government. In 1991, the Croatian Parliament established the Commission for Determination of War and Post-war Victims. The commission began its work in 1994, but was abolished in 2002, with no significant contribution to the research.

=== Number of victims ===
The exact number of deaths on death marches and in labor camps after the end of the war is difficult to determine. Geiger writes that number of Bleiburg-related casualties, provided in the literature mostly ranges from 50,000 to 200–250,000. Other historians also cite estimates of 20,000 to 40,000, while noting that pro-Ustaše writers inflate Croat casualties, and that many estimates are not based on individual victim lists, thus making them unreliable.

Estimates on the number of casualties were first provided in emigrant literature, much ranging from 100,000 to 600,000 deaths, mostly on the basis of eyewitness accounts. Yugoslav dissident Milovan Đilas wrote in 1977 that the figure is higher than 20,000, but did not exceed 30,000. In 1989, the historian Franjo Tuđman, who at the time of Bleiburg was a Croatian representative at the Supreme Headquarters of the Yugoslav Army, and later became Croatia&#x27;s first president, estimated the number of Bleiburg-related victims at 35,000 to 40,000, and wrote of the &quot;Bleiburg myth&quot;, stating that estimates of hundreds of thousands of victims were greatly exaggerated. Tuđman cited Allied reports that by June 1, 1945, a total of 26,399 members of &quot;Yugoslav quisling forces&quot; had been turned over from Bleiburg and other parts of Austria to the new authorities (later a total of 29,792 prisoners), of whom 12,196 were Croats, 5,480 Serbs, 8,263 Slovenes, and 400 Montenegrins. The events were also discussed in November 1945, when Stalin mentioned in a conversation with Polish Communist leader Władysław Gomułka that the Yugoslav partisans had shot 14,000 of some 34,000 of &quot;Pavelic&#x27;s captives&quot;.

Tomasevich writes that for propaganda purposes, Ustaše and pro-Ustaše writers sought to maximize the number of Croat Bleiburg victims, while minimizing Jewish, Serb, Roma and antifascist Croat victims of the Ustaše. He states that many collaborationists perished in the final intense battles, when they refused to surrender, even after the surrender of Germany. He notes that Ustaše sources could not have known the number of forces fleeing, the number that died in final battles, the number captured, etc., and they provide no such detail, not even the units involved. Thus, their Bleiburg victim estimates are subject to wide error. Macdonald also cites the efforts of radical Croat writers to inflate the number of Croat Bleiburg victims to hundreds of thousands, similar to how nationalist Serbs writers inflate the number Jasenovac victims.

In the 1990s, Croatian demographer Vladimir Žerjavić conducted the first systematic research, based on demographic estimates. Thus, Žerjavić wrote that extreme Croatian emigre estimates of 300,000 Croat Bleiburg victims were clearly exaggerated, since his demographic data shows a total of 192,000 Croat WWII victims, on all sides. Žerjavić writes that, unlike for Jasenovac, no victim lists were available for collaborationists at the time. Thus, he guessed 99,000 total Croat and Bosniak NDH armed forces victims, then noted &quot;it is very difficult to evaluate what percentage of them died during the war, but if we estimate 50%, that means [Croat and Bosniak] losses related to Bleiburg could amount to about 50,000.&quot; He noted that the great majority of captured civilians were released, thus Bleiburg victims were mainly members of NDH armed forces. Of the estimated 45,000 Croat victims, Žerjavić states 11,600 of those lost their lives in the final battles before surrender, and 33,300 after surrender. In a 1992 work, Žerjavić estimated 57,000 to 65.000 total victims of all nationalities, including 45,000 to 55,000 Croats and Bosniaks, 8,000 to 10,000 Slovenes, and 2,000 Serbs and Montenegrins. In 1995, he segmented the Croat-Bosniak losses to 45,000 Croats and 4,000 Bosniaks, and a further 4,000 Croats and 2,000 Bosniaks in &quot;individual cleansings&quot; from 1945 to 1947.

Geiger notes there are researchers who insist victim numbers can only be determined via individual names, and have thus raised serious objections to Žerjavić&#x27;s statistical estimates, stating these are insufficient and unreliable in determining the number of fatalities. Žerjavić writes that he had data from the 1964 Yugoslav census of individual victims of occupiers and collaborators, thus his estimates of these victims are largely confirmed by individual names. However, he had no victim lists on the collaborationist side, just as he had no individual victim lists for the 1990s war in Bosnia, when he estimated 215,000 total victims, including 30.000 Croats. Later the Sarajevo-based Research and Documentation Center built a database of 101,040 individual victims, including 8,403 Croats. These numbers are now widely accepted as the most authoritative, indicating that without individual victim data, which were also lacking for Bleiburg, Žerjavić greatly overestimated Bosnian War victims, with the largest overestimate for Croat victims.

In 1991, the Croatian government created the Commission for Determining Wartime and Postwar Victims of the Republic of Croatia, led by Vice Vukojević, a member of the Bleiburg Honor Guard, who claimed Jews ran the Ustaše Jasenovac death camp. The Commission selectively focused on documenting Croat victims on the NDH side, since they were not registered in previous Yugoslav victim censuses. In 1999, the commission published data listing 13,300 mostly Croats from Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, who lost their lives related to Bleiburg. 83% of these were members of NDH armed forces, including 5,503 Ustaše, 3,101 Croatian Home Guards and 2,492 unclassified members of the Croatian Armed Forces. The remaining 2,204 were listed as &quot;other or unidentified&quot;. The data for persons &quot;killed outside of combat&quot; is not categorized by year of death. The commission cited that, according to Slovenian estimates, there were around 190,000 victims in the graves in Slovenia alone (Mitja Ferenc, in charge of uncovering postwar graves in Slovenia, later stated that the number of victims is fewer than 100,000, in the tens of thousands). The commission was dissolved in 2002, and no further governmental research was conducted.

Ivo Goldstein notes the Croatian Commission&#x27;s detailed Bleiburg data were never published, neither was promised data on Croat victims from similar projects by the Croatian Historical Institute (HIP), the Catholic Church and others. Thus none can be verified, in contrast to the Jasenovac victim list, published online. While victim lists have been published for some sub-areas, these contain many errors, including listing as Croat WWII victims people who died naturally decades later. The lists also show that nearly all Croat Bleiburg victims were members of armed forces, with no children and only one woman (for aiding postwar Ustaše guerillas), thus contradicting Croatian rightists, who claim civilians, women and children were targeted. This differs from Jasenovac, where the majority of 83,145 named victims are women and children. Goldstein states that in view of 13,300 listed Bleiburg victims (some no doubt killed in battles before surrender), it may be time to revise downward Žerjavić&#x27;s estimate of 45,000 to 55,000 Croat and Bosniak Bleiburg victims.

The governmental commissions in Slovenia published more thorough data. In 2005, the Slovenian government established the Commission on Concealed Mass Graves in Slovenia. The commission estimates that there are around 100,000 victims of all nationalities in the graves in Slovenia. The Institute of Contemporary History in Ljubljana launched a research project to establish the number of casualties during and after the Second World War in Slovenia. As of 2008, their data shows that 14,274 Slovenians were killed in &quot;post-war violence in Slovenia&quot;, which includes non-Bleiburg victims. The number includes 12,431 Slovene Home Guards and 1,076 civilians. According to data published by Slovenian historian Vida Deželak Barič in 2014, there were a total of 14,999 Slovenian victims of post-war killings, including 12,101 Slovene collaborationist POWs, 2,199 civilians, and 547 with an unknown status. This includes victims unrelated to Bleiburg. Deželak Barič listed among the civilian casualties all 529 victims from the German minority, who she notes played a prominent role in Nazi forced Germanization and other repressive acts against Slovenes.

In April 2008, the Slovenian Presidency of the Council of the European Union organized the European Public Hearing on Crimes Committed by Totalitarian Regimes, and the resulting document included various research including that of Mitja Ferenc, noting official data on 3,986 known wartime graves and mass graves in Slovenia from World War II, Milko Mikola, indicating that the victims were executed en masse without a trial, and Jerca Vodušek Starič who wrote about purported mass killings following liberation of Slovenia and Croatia in May 1945: &quot;It is impossible to find out the exact number of those liquidated. Today the number reaches 14,531 Slovenes and an estimate [of] 65,000 to 100,000 Croats. Among them were also civilians.&quot; In 2011, Mitja Ferenc, in charge of uncovering post-war graves in Slovenia, stated that &quot;regarding the victims there is only an estimate, I myself think that it is fewer [than 100,000], how many I don&#x27;t know. Certainly some tens of thousands&quot; and that &quot;from the end of the war to January 1946 about 14,000 Slovenians were murdered. Among them were about 1,100 civilians; the remainder were mostly members of the Slovene Home Guard forces and a smaller number of Chetniks.&quot;

Where estimates could later be verified, they showed large overestimates. Thus, after an initial 700 victims were recovered from Barbar Pit (Huda Jama), the President of the Slovene Commission on Concealed Mass Graves, Jože Dežman, claimed that more than 5,000 victims were buried there. In the end a total of 1,416 casualties were recovered. Goldstein notes that Mitja Ferenc similarly overestimated remaining victims at Barbara Pit by a factor of 3 times, and he questions Ferenc&#x27;s Tezno estimates, since Ferenc used the same methodology to estimate 15,000 victims at Tezno, based on a total of 1,179 recovered corpses.

Grahek Ravančić states that Žerjavić&#x27;s research is accepted in most related literature. Conversely, Geiger notes that researchers have raised serious objections to Žerjavić&#x27;s statistical methods, stating that all such estimates which are not based on individual victim lists, are unreliable. Ewa Tabeau also criticized Žerjavić&#x27;s methodology when he estimated 215,000 Bosnian War victims, compared to later estimates of around 100,000, a figure now widely accepted. Jozo Tomasevich used Žerjavić&#x27;s estimates of 70,000 killed, connected with Bleiburg and Viktring. Croatian historian Slavko Goldstein cited the losses of 50,000 Croats and 20,000 Serbs, Slovenes, and others. Croatian historian Martina Grahek Ravančić considers the total number of victims at around 80,000, since the Slovenian research showed a higher number of Slovene deaths than Žerjavić&#x27;s research. On the other hand, Goldstein notes that the 1990s Croatian Commission found only 13,300 Croat Bleiburg victims, versus Žerjavić&#x27;s estimate of 45,000 Croat victims, and states that Žerjavić&#x27;s Croat victim estimates should be revised downward. Vladimir Geiger, who states that statistical estimates are unreliable, writes that based on such statistical estimates, a minimum of 70,000 to 80,000 people were killed. Swiss historian Michael Portmann compared the estimates, calculations and lists of human losses. His appraisal of the death toll is 80,000, &quot;60,000 under the keyword &quot;Bleiburg&quot; and 20,000 under the keyword &quot;Viktring&quot; and &quot;Kočevje&quot;&quot;, from May to August 1945. For Croatian losses, Portmann cites Žerjavić&#x27;s estimate of 45,000 victims, while for losses among the German minority in Slovenia he claims 2,000 victims in just one camp, compared to a total of 111 such victims in all Slovene camps, as determined by Slovene researchers.

Croatian historian Ivo Goldstein, in his book &quot;Croatia 1918-2008&quot;, has posited that contemporary documentation supports the existence of up to 116,000 NDH soldiers and up to 60,000 Croatian civilians in the main columns through Slovenia. In addition, on a separate route there were around 17,000 members of the Slovene Home Guard, the Serbian Volunteer Corps, Chetniks and some smaller NDH army units, together with around 10,000 Slovenian civilians. Croatian historian Zdravko Dizdar analyzed the published victim lists and materials collected by the 1992 Croatian Commission. According to him, the data shows that 62,000 Croat post-war victims are personally identified. Geiger says of Dizdar&#x27;s numbers that &quot;although statistically possible, these are obviously rough estimates, for [Dizdar] did not indicate which victim lists and publications were consulted, how many fatalities were specified in individual lists and how the verification of data was done&quot;. Grahek Ravančić says that more than 5,000 named individuals are listed in known Croatian victim lists related to Bleiburg. She notes that some victim lists are &quot;subjective&quot;, and some include all casualties during the war without a specific year and place of death, so &quot;it’s difficult to determine the number of victims from these lists that were killed as part of Bleiburg&quot;. A number of authors cite tens of thousands of killed. In Croatian emigrant literature, the prevailing number is 200,000 killed Croats.

==Legacy==
For decades after the killings, the government of Yugoslavia under Josip Broz Tito put forward a sanitized version of the repatriations that glorified the communist cause. Other communist governments and historians echoed these narratives, with only the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe finally bringing a fuller picture of the events.

===Commemorations===

With the transition to democracy in the 1980s and 1990s, the interest in revealing information about the Bleiburg repatriations grew. In May 1994, an International Symposium for Investigation of the Bleiburg Tragedy was held in both Zagreb and Bleiburg, where several authors discussed the deaths at Bleiburg and estimated them to be in the tens of thousands. This was later published by Školska knjiga as &quot;Od Bleiburga do naših dana&quot;.

The Republic of Croatia, by an act of the Croatian Parliament in 1995, started to officially commemorate the victims at Bleiburg, at a time when Franjo Tuđman and the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) were in power. More recently, as commemorative events became less of a political event, the radicals were largely marginalized and the focus of the commemoration turned to the actual victims of the repatriations. Many top-ranking politicians and Catholic and Muslim clerics visit the Bleiburg site annually. Prime Minister Ivica Račan visited the site in 2002. Prime Minister Ivo Sanader visited the site in 2004. For the 60th anniversary commemorations in 2005 a large crowd was in attendance, with speeches by Croatian parliamentary speaker Vladimir Šeks and head of the Muslim Community of Croatia, Mufti Ševko Omerbašić. In 2007, a new altar was installed at the site and was inaugurated by Cardinal Josip Bozanić before some 10,000 people.

In 2004, a memorial park was built in Teharje, Slovenia, where an annual ceremony in remembrance of post-World War II victims is held. In 2007, Slovenia&#x27;s government announced plans to make the Tezno trench a memorial park and cemetery. In 2008, the Croatian and Slovenian governments reached an agreement of cooperation on organizing military cemeteries, similar to earlier agreements which Slovenia reached with Italy and Germany. Croatia&#x27;s Prime Minister, Zoran Milanović, visited Bleiburg in September 2008. He stated that all victims had the right to a fair trial, and that his motive was not political.

==== Controversy ====
In 2009, Croatian President Stjepan Mesić criticized the Parliament&#x27;s representatives who did not react to people in the crowd displaying Ustaše iconography at the commemoration, which is ostensibly illegal in Croatia, at a state-sponsored event. In 2010, Croatian president Ivo Josipović said he would not attend the year&#x27;s May Bleiburg commemoration as long as Ustaše iconography was present, although he did make a separate visit to the Bleiburg memorial in June in addition to his visit to the Tezno memorial. In 2012, Croatia&#x27;s parliament decided to revoke funding for the annual Bleiburg commemoration. The reason given by Milanović was that the government would not fund what had become a politically partisan event concentrating on the NDH, rather than mourning the victims. In 2012, the Croatian leadership laid wreaths only at the monument in Tezno.

As Croatian academician Vjeran Pavlaković, an assistant professor in the Department of Cultural Studies at the University of Rijeka, writes in &quot;Deifying the Defeated Commemorating Bleiburg since 1990&quot;,&quot;The blurring of the past and the present is an integral part of the Bleiburg commemorations; not only do the participants dress in Ustasa uniforms, display Ustasa insignia and iconography, and sell paraphernalia associated with the NDH and its leaders, but there is an active discourse about the Croatian War of Independence accompanied by images of heroes (as well as individuals guilty of war crimes) from the conflict in the 1990s.&quot; 
Pavlaković concludes that &quot;&quot;[T]he effectiveness of Bleiburg to act as a site of memory can be attributed to the fact that it represents both a traumatic past, as well as a moment of rupture, or historical discontinuity. Both of these factors give the commemorations at Bleiburg emotional weight and political significance, especially at a point when Croatia was going through another historical transition in the 1990s. It also meant that the Bleiburg myth was easily manipulated; the victims of the Bleiburg tragedy were actively invoked not only to distort the Ustasa past, but to justify the resurgence of extreme nationalist political options. The Bleiburg myth became one of many historical moments that symbolized Croatian martyrdom, due to the prevailing narrative of victimization by Greater Serbian aggression during the 1990s. The martyrium myth is one of the most common archetypes in the taxonomy of myths... The danger of presenting the victims of Bleiburg exclusively as martyrs for the Croatian state, however, is that the reality of the NDH regime and the crimes it committed are ignored in the new, revised narrative of World War Two.

The 2015 commemoration was the largest on record, with more than 20,000 people attending. In 2016, the Croatian parliament reintroduced sponsorship of the event in order to show reverence for the victims of Communist-totalitarianism after the Second World War.

In 2018, Austrian courts convicted five Croats of performing Nazi salutes or shouting Ustaše slogans at the commemoration. The convicts all received suspended sentences.

On 8 March 2019 the Catholic Church in Carinthia in Austria prohibited priests from performing mass at Bleiburg commemorations. E. Guggenberger, interim administrator of the Diocese of Gurk-Klagenfurt, wrote, &quot;the mass in the field near Bleiburg has become part of a manifestation that is politically instrumentalised and is part of a political-nationalistic ritual that serves a selective experience and interpretation of history.&quot; The letter claims the event undermines the Catholic Church&#x27;s reputation. Three Austrian EU parliamentarians criticized the Bleiburg commemorations as &quot;the largest fascist gathering in Europe&quot;, and largely as a result of the display of fascist symbols during Bleiburg commemorations, the Austrian government in 2019 passed a law forbidding the display of Ustashe symbols, along with previously prohibited Nazi, ISIS and other symbols. Austrian courts have sentenced Croatian participants at the Bleiburg commemorations for fascist salutes and displaying fascist symbols. The World Jewish Congress and the Wiesenthal Center joined in condemning the Bleiburg commemoration, with the World Jewish Congress stating the event has been “used to glorify individuals who supported or were actively involved in the activities of a regime which had executed hundreds of thousands of innocent men, women, and children only because of their ethnic or religious identity”.

In 2020, Catholic Mass sponsored by the Croatian Parliament was held in Sacred Heart Cathedral in Sarajevo as replacement for an annual gathering usually held in Bleiburg, Austria, which was canceled due to restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. At the same time thousands of protesters marched through Marshal Tito street to commemorate victims of the Ustaša regime, and gathered at Eternal flame. Most of Bosnian politicians criticized the Mass held by head of Catholic Church in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Vinko Puljić. Previously, it was condemned by Bosnia&#x27;s Serbian Orthodox Church, the Jewish and Muslim communities and several antifascist organizations.

In July 2020, the lower house of the Austrian Parliament adopted a resolution calling on the Ministry of the Interior to consider banning the commemoration in Bleiburg, because of the display of Ustaše symbols. The ban, however, did not occur, and the 2021 commemorative event was held under COVID restrictions, without large gatherings.

In November 2021, Karl Nehammer, then the Austrian Interior Minister recommended that the Bleiburg commemoration in its present form be banned, because “In Austria, glorifying the terror regime is unacceptable. We will prevent any attempt to spread right-wing extremist and revisionist worldviews at rallies&quot;. Subsequently, Austria formally banned the Bleiburg commemoration, and also banned, as a fascist symbol, the &quot;chessboard&quot; coat of arms of the NDH state, with the first white square, and removed it from the memorial at Bleiburg.

===Historiography===
Unlike many other operations of the Partisans, which have been described in detail, little has been written on operations in Slovenia near the Austrian border during the week of 7–15 May 1945. Postwar Yugoslav literature ascribed all human losses in May and June 1945 as military casualties in the final operations of the war. All opposing armies and political opponents were characterized by the Yugoslav historiography as traitors and collaborators. The events at Bleiburg were known as &quot;final encirclement battles&quot;, &quot;final military operations&quot;, and the &quot;grand finale in Carinthia&quot;. The Bleiburg repatriations and their aftermath were first discussed in emigrant literature by anti-communists that managed to leave the country. One of the first book dealing with the subject was &quot;La Tragedia de Bleiburg&quot;, published by Croatian emigrants in Buenos Aires in 1963.

&quot;The Minister and the Massacres&quot;, a 1986 book by Nikolai Tolstoy, further publicized the issue, but it made various dubious claims about the repatriations that were roundly criticized by various historians and authors, although it brought attention, more generally, to the persistent distortion of the story, and to the issue of historians trusting contemporary records and purported eyewitness.

Croatian-American historian Jozo Tomasevich described the events: &quot;The annihilation of most quisling troops captured at the end of the war – which is a fact – was an act of mass terror and brutal political surgery, similar to that practiced by the Ustašas and the Chetniks earlier in the war.&quot; Regarding Partisan treatment of Ustaše prisoners, Tomasevich notes: &quot;We must now ask the really fundamental question, namely who was responsible for Bleiburg...The problem of Bleiburg obviously cannot be discussed in isolation, as Ustasha and pro-Ustasha writers regularly do. It is intimately related to the establishment and general policies of the NDH, to the Ustasha reign of terror against the Serbian population, to the Croatian state&#x27;s determined alliance with Nazi Germany and with the Ustasha&#x27;s final efforts to escape and ally with the West against the Communists. So we must conclude that the responsibility for Bleiburg was the collective responsibility of Pavelić and the Ustasha regime&quot;.

British political scientist David Bruce MacDonald criticized the exaggeration of the number of victims: &quot;Inflating the numbers of dead at Bleiburg had several layers of significance. Firstly, it gave the Croats their own massacre at the hands of Serbs and/or Communists, which allowed them to counter the Serbs&#x27; Jasenovac genocide with one of their own. Secondly, it allowed Croats to distance themselves from the Serbs and the Communist regime that had carried out the massacres. They could portray Croatia as an unwilling participant in the SFRY, more a prisoner than a constituent nation. Thirdly, by suffering such a massacre, the Croats underwent their own &#x27;way of Cross&#x27;, as dubbed by most Croatians.&quot;

Responding to those who in Croatia seek to equate Bleiburg with Jasenovac, historians Ivo and Slavko Goldstein wrote: “Jasenovac…was primarily a genocidal crime of mass murder of civilians for the sin of their birth in another religion or nationality”. By contrast, “Bleiburg was a crime of mass killing of disarmed prisoners of defeated enemy troops who had been waging war for four years on the side of the evil”. They also note, “in Jasenovac, besides working age men; women, children and older people were also massively murdered. As part of Bleiburg, those killed were almost exclusively disarmed soldiers, combat-capable men”

Regarding Tito&#x27;s responsibility for the actions of the Partisans at the end of the war, Croatian lawyer Dominik Vuletić wrote: &quot;...it should be mentioned that at the time of the Bleiburg events and the death marches that followed, he was the Prime Minister (DFJ), Minister of Defence, General Secretary of the Communist Party and the Supreme Commander of all Yugoslav Armed Forces, so de facto and de iure he had control over all the forces and was the most responsible individual in the country. The Yugoslav forces that participated in the Bleiburg events acted according to Tito&#x27;s instructions and were under his control. [...] So, there can be no doubt that Josip Broz Tito had full effective control over the units involved in the crimes.&quot; On 13 May, Tito dispatched a handwritten telegram to the supreme headquarters of the Slovene Partisan Army that arrived on 14 May, prohibiting &quot;in the sternest language&quot; the execution of prisoners of war and commanding the transfer of possible suspects to a military court. The authenticity of this telegram is disputed as it was not published in any collection of documents of the Yugoslav Army and did not have Tito&#x27;s signature. Historian Nikolai Tolstoy called it &quot;a clear forgery&quot;.

British historian Keith Lowe dealt with the end of the war in his book &quot;Savage Continent: Europe in the Aftermath of World War II&quot;, where he wrote: &quot;For countless millions of people throughout the eastern half of the continent, therefore, the end of the war did not signal ‘liberation’ at all, it merely heralded a new era of state repression. The Nazi terror was over: the Communist terror was about to begin&quot;.

Swiss historian Michael Portmann writes, &quot;The responsibility for “Bleiburg” to a vast extent rests with Pavelić and the Ustaša regime itself: The bloody terror of ustaše against the Serbian population (coercive conversions, expellings and mass killings), the Croatian state&#x27;s determined alliance with Nazi Germany and - last but not least – the order by Pavelić not to surrender but to withdraw under battle to the Austrian border have to be stated as reasons for the indeed brutal Partisan retaliation&quot;.

===In popular culture===
The first film that mentioned the Bleiburg events was &quot;Sokol Did Not Love Him&quot; (&quot;Sokol ga nije volio&quot;), directed by Branko Schmidt and released in 1988. The surrender at Bleiburg was the subject of a 1999 Croatian film, &quot;Četverored&quot;, directed by Jakov Sedlar. It is based on the 1997 novel of the same name by Ivan Aralica. A 2004 Croatian film, &quot;Long Dark Night&quot; (&quot;Duga mračna noć&quot;), directed by Antun Vrdoljak, covers the wartime in a Slavonian village from 1941 to 1945 and post-war events in Slovenia. A longer version of the movie aired on the Croatian Radiotelevision as a TV series in 13 episodes. &quot;The Miner&quot; (&quot;Rudar&quot;), a 2017 Slovenian film directed by Hanna Antonina Wojcik Slak, is based on the discovery of the Barbara Pit massacre in 2009.

Croatian-Australian painter Charles Billich painted a series of works on the event.

<text>William Blake Everett (; May 18, 1917 – February 27, 1973) was an American comic book writer-artist best known for creating Namor the Sub-Mariner as well as co-creating Zombie and Daredevil with writer Stan Lee for Marvel Comics. He was allegedly a descendant of the childless poet William Blake and of Richard Everett, founder of Dedham, Massachusetts.

==Early life==
Everett was born on May 18, 1917, in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Everett, a fabulist who spun fanciful stories of his youth, claimed at various points to have graduated from high school in Arizona, or instead to have joined the U.S. Merchant Marine at ages ranging from 15 to 17, among other tales. In actuality, he was born at the Cambridge Hospital (renamed Mount Auburn Hospital in 1947) and raised in nearby Watertown, Massachusetts, with his parents Robert Maxwell Everett and Elaine Grace Brown Everett, and his sister Elizabeth, born in 1915. His 300-year-old New England family included Everett, Massachusetts&#x27; namesake, Edward Everett, who after serving as president of Harvard University became governor of Massachusetts and, in 1852, the U.S. Secretary of State. It also includes Edward&#x27;s son, Massachusetts Congressman William Everett; and the poet William Blake.

Everett&#x27;s father ran a successful trucking business, and when Everett was young the family bought a large summer home in Kennebunkport, Maine. Both parents supported the artistic talents of their son, whose reading tastes ran to the classics rather than pulp novels or comic strips, and included work by Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Jack London. He would later find artistic influence in such commercial magazine artists as Mead Schaeffer, Dean Cornwell, and especially Floyd MacMillan Davis.

At 12, in 1929, Everett contracted tuberculosis, and was pulled from sixth grade to go with his mother and his sister to Arizona, to recuperate for four months. They then returned to Massachusetts, but a recurrence of the disease sent the trio back West, first to Prescott, Arizona, and then to Wickenburg, 60 miles away. There, taking his first drink, Everett began the path to teenage alcoholism. Nonetheless, he became well enough by 16 to return home with his mother and sister to the Boston area, where his father, unscathed by the Great Depression, had a large house in West Newton. His alcoholism and natural rebelliousness caused his parents to remove him from high school at age 16, in his second year, and enroll him in 1934 at Boston&#x27;s Vesper George School of Art. His inability to focus, however, led him to drop out in 1935, after a year-and-a-half of the program.

That same year, his father died of acute appendicitis, and the family, though remaining well-off, moved to an apartment back in Cambridge. Everett knew his father &quot;always wanted me to be a cartoonist, and he died, unfortunately, before he saw that come true. But that was probably in back of the whole thing.&quot;

==Career==

===Early work===

Everett soon became a professional artist on the advertising staff of the Boston newspaper &quot;The Herald-Traveler&quot; for $12 a week. Soon afterward, he left to become a draftsman for the civil engineering firm The Brooks System, in Newton, Massachusetts. From there he pursued work in Phoenix, Arizona, and Los Angeles, California, without success. He then returned east to New York City, where he again did newspaper advertising art, for the &quot;New York Herald-Tribune&quot;. He next became art editor for Teck Publications&#x27; &quot;Radio News&quot; magazine, then assistant art director under Herm Bollin in Chicago, Illinois. Fired for being, as Everett described, &quot;too cocky&quot;, he returned to New York where he sought employment as an art director. With no luck at this and desperate for work, he ran into an old Teck colleague, Walter Holze, who was now working in the new field of comic books. As Everett recalled in the late 1960s, &quot;He asked me if I could do comics. I said, &#x27;Sure!!&#x27; At that point I was starving. I wasn&#x27;t interested in the comics business; I was talked into it&quot;.

Freelancing for Centaur Publications, Everett &quot;sold my first page for $2 – writing, penciling, inking and all. &#x27;Skyrocket Steele&#x27; was my first strip.&quot; Soon he was getting $10 and then $14 a page, a respectable sum during this late-1930s period near the beginning of what historians and fans call the Golden Age of comic books. Everett co-created the superhero Amazing-Man at Centaur, working with company art director Lloyd Jacquet, and drew the first five issues.

Everett and other creators followed Jacquet to his new company Funnies, Inc., one of the first comic-book &quot;packagers&quot; that would create comics on demand for publishers. Everett recalled
===Sub-Mariner===
At Funnies, Inc., Everett created the Sub-Mariner for an aborted project, &quot;Motion Picture Funnies Weekly&quot; #1, a planned promotional comic to be given away in movie theaters. When plans changed, Everett used his character instead for Funnies, Inc.&#x27;s first client, pulp magazine publisher Martin Goodman. The original eight-page story was expanded by four pages for &quot;Marvel Comics&quot; #1 (Oct. 1939), the first publication of what Goodman would eventually call Timely Comics, the 1940s precursor of Marvel Comics. Everett&#x27;s anti-hero proved a sudden success, quickly becoming one of Timely&#x27;s top three characters, along with Carl Burgos&#x27; android superhero the Human Torch and Jack Kirby and Joe Simon&#x27;s Captain America. Everett soon introduced such supporting characters as New York City policewoman Betty Dean, a steady companion and occasional love-interest, and Namor&#x27;s cousin Namora.

Everett drew his star character in &quot;Sub-Mariner Comics&quot;, published first quarterly, then thrice-yearly and finally bimonthly, for issues #1–32 (Fall 1941 – June 1949).

Everett entered the U.S. Army for World War II military service in February 1942. He attended Officer Candidate School at Fort Belvoir, during which time he met Gwenn Randall, who was working for the Ordnance Department at the Pentagon. The couple married in 1944, when Everett returned from the European theater of operations, and their first child, a daughter, was born shortly before he was shipped out to the Philippines to fight in the Pacific theater; he returned home in February 1946. With money inherited from a great-uncle, Everett took some time off and traveled before settling in Fairbury, Nebraska, his wife&#x27;s hometown. &quot;This was when I renewed my association with Martin Goodman, working by mail on a freelance basis, picking up the Sub-Mariner where I&#x27;d left off four years ago&quot;. His first recorded post-war credit is writing and full art for the 12-page story &quot;Sub-Mariner vs. Green-Out&quot; in &quot;Sub-Mariner Comics&quot; #21 (Fall 1946) – the third of three Sub-Mariner stories that issue, for which Syd Shores drew the cover. Everett was soon providing Sub-Mariner stories regularly for the solo title as well as for &quot;The Human Torch&quot;, &quot;Marvel Mystery Comics&quot; and even &quot;Blonde Phantom Comics&quot;.

Additionally, he drew the title feature in the three-issue spin-off series &quot;Namora&quot; (Aug.–Dec. 1948).

Early pseudonyms included Willie Bee and Bill Roman.

===Atlas Comics===
By now, Timely Comics had evolved into Marvel&#x27;s 1950s iteration, Atlas Comics. Like most superhero characters in the postwar era, the Sub-Mariner had faded in popularity, and his solo title had been canceled in 1949. But after a nearly five-year hiatus, he briefly returned with Captain America and the Golden Age Human Torch in &quot;Young Men #24&quot; (Dec. 1953), during Atlas&#x27; mid-1950s attempt at reviving superheroes. Everett drew the Sub-Mariner feature through &quot;Young Men&quot; #28 (June 1954) and in &quot;Sub-Mariner Comics&quot; #33–42 (April 1954 – Oct. 1955), which outlasted the other two characters&#x27; features. During this time, Namora had her own spin-off series.

Everett also drew the features &quot;Venus&quot; and &quot;Marvel Boy&quot;, as well as a large number of stories for Atlas&#x27; anthological horror-fantasy series. One such tale, &quot;Zombie!,&quot; written by editor-in-chief Stan Lee and published in &quot;Menace&quot; #5, introduced the character Simon Garth, the Zombie, who in the 1970s would be plucked from this one-shot story to star in Marvel&#x27;s black-and-white horror-comics magazine &quot;Tales of the Zombie&quot;.

===Marvel Comics===
With writer-editor Lee, Everett co-created the Marvel superhero Daredevil, who debuted in &quot;Daredevil&quot; #1 (April 1964). Comics historian and former Jack Kirby assistant Mark Evanier, investigating claims of Kirby&#x27;s involvement in the creation of both Iron Man and Daredevil, interviewed Kirby and Everett and found that,
Conversely, 2000s Marvel editor-in-chief Joe Quesada said the cover had been created afterward. When Everett, he said, turned in his first-issue pencils extremely late, Brodsky and Spider-Man artist Steve Ditko inked &quot;a lot of backgrounds and secondary figures on the fly [and] cobbled the cover and the splash page together from Kirby&#x27;s original concept drawing.&quot;

In an interview conducted by Marvel writer-editor and Everett&#x27;s one-time roommate Roy Thomas, in what the latter recalled as either &quot;late 1969 or in 1970,&quot; Everett said of Daredevil&#x27;s creation five years earlier:

Within two years, however, Everett began penciling for Marvel once again, first on the character the Hulk, in &quot;Tales to Astonish&quot;, initially over Kirby layouts, and on Doctor Strange in &quot;Strange Tales&quot;. Readers during this 1960s Silver Age of comic books also became acquainted with his Golden Age and 1950s stories, which were reprinted first in the book &quot;The Great Comic Book Heroes&quot; by Jules Feiffer (Dial Press, 1965), and then in the comic books &quot;Fantasy Masterpieces&quot;, &quot;Marvel Super-Heroes&quot;, and &quot;Marvel Tales&quot;.

Everett even returned to his enduring character, first inking Namor&#x27;s adventures in &quot;Tales to Astonish&quot; #85–86, then taking over full artistic duties for issues #87–91 and #94, and penciling issues #95–96. He then did complete stories – writing, penciling and inking – on &quot;Sub-Mariner&quot; #50–55 and 57 (June 1972 – Nov. 1972; Jan. 1973), with script assists by Mike Friedrich on two issues; and #58 (Feb. 1973), co-written with Steve Gerber and co-penciled with Sam Kweskin as his health began to deteriorate for the final time. He co-wrote and inked &quot;Sub-Mariner&quot; #59 (March 1973), plotted #60 (April 1973), and co-wrote, co-penciled (with fellow Golden Ager Win Mortimer), and co-inked #61 (May 1973). He had also been announced to draw an issue of &quot;Marvel Team-Up&quot; starring Spider-Man and the Sub-Mariner, but, according to one contemporaneous report, &quot;was not able to finish this one before his death.&quot;

Editor Roy Thomas explained on the letters page of &quot;Sub-Mariner&quot; #61,

Despite Thomas&#x27;s optimistic tone, that would be Everett&#x27;s last work on the series. His final efforts on the character he created were five pages of pencils, inked by fellow Golden Ager Fred Kida, that appeared posthumously in &quot;Super-Villain Team-Up&quot; #1 (Aug. 1975).

Artist Gene Colan said that Everett had been Lee&#x27;s first choice to draw the horror series &quot;Tomb of Dracula&quot;, which premiered in 1972 and for which Colan then lobbied successfully.

==Death==
Everett died on February 27, 1973, at the age of 55.

<text>Stephen Paul Cannane (born 1970) is a news journalist and current affairs reporter for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. He is the chief of the ABC&#x27;s Europe bureau, based in London. Cannane had previously been the ABC&#x27;s Europe correspondent, a reporter for the ABC&#x27;s Investigations unit, a host of &quot;The Drum&quot; and a reporter at &quot;Lateline&quot;.

==Politics==
Cannane is a grandson of Pat Hills, a former Lord Mayor of Sydney and Deputy Premier of New South Wales.

At the age of 22, Cannane was persuaded to run as the Australian Labor Party candidate for Warringah in the 1993 Australian federal election. Despite garnering more than 33% of the vote and providing a favourable swing of more than 5% for the ALP, Cannane lost to Liberal Party stalwart Michael MacKellar who had held the seat since 1969. Despite beating Cannane, Mackellar resigned from parliament the following year. This triggered the 1994 Warringah by-election where Labor didn&#x27;t field a candidate, which was won by Tony Abbott. In 2008 Cannane said although running as a candidate in 1993 was fun at the time, he actually didn&#x27;t hold any serious political aspirations and had long since moved on.

==Media career==
Cannane&#x27;s first radio job was answering the phones during ABC Local Radio&#x27;s &quot;Nightlife&quot; program, hosted by Tony Delroy. It was there he was approached by the ABC to work at their youth network Triple J after writing a newspaper article where he opined the organisation wasn&#x27;t providing sufficient on-air opportunities for young people.

He subsequently started work as a reporter for radio station Triple J&#x27;s current affairs program, &quot;The Morning Show&quot;. In 2003, after Francis Leach left the station, Cannane took on the position of host of the show. As a journalist, Cannane has an interest in exposing unscrupulous behaviour, having reported on child abuse within the Church of Scientology, the harassment of the parents of a deceased child by the anti-vaccination lobby and the failure of the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) to protect consumers from dodgy products.

He temporarily presented breakfast on ABC Radio National while the regular presenter pursued other projects.

Cannane was the founding presenter of Triple J&#x27;s current affairs program, &quot;Hack&quot;, beginning in 2004.

In 2005, Cannane was accused of antisemitism by Liberal Party senator Santo Santoro who alleged at a senate committee hearing that Cannane had made reference to &quot;those awful jews&quot; in a November 2004 &quot;Hack&quot; interview about Mordechai Vanunu. However, Santoro later apologised and said that he had been misinformed after a review of the transcript confirmed Cannane had put no such questions forward.

In 2006 he won the Walkley Award for Broadcast Interviewing for a series of three interviews - Petrol Sniffing, Pilltesting and The Cost of War. He was also commended in the same category of the Walkleys in 2005.

In 2006 Cannane won the Excellence in Alcohol and Drug Media Reporting Award at the National Drug and Alcohol Awards and visited the US as the Australian representative on the US Department of State&#x27;s Edward R Murrow program for journalists.

In 2008, Cannane presented &quot;The Hack Half Hour&quot; on ABC2.

In 2009, he fronted the ABC1 documentary series &quot;Whatever! The Science of Teenagers&quot; and published a book, &quot;First Tests: Great Australian Cricketers and the Backyards That Made Them&quot;.

In July 2010, Cannane was appointed presenter of ABC News 24&#x27;s &quot;The Drum&quot;, a panel discussion program providing news and analysis on issues of the day.

Also in July 2010, Cannane broke the story of harassment of the parents of a child who died of whooping cough by the anti-vaccination lobby, the Australian Vaccination Network (AVN) on Lateline. His story was the first to expose the lobby group as callous and cruel, with revelations that their President Meryl Dorey, had sought to access medical records of the child as evidence she had died from a pertussis infection. The story also described a complaint about the AVN which was under investigation by the NSW Health Care Complaints Commission (HCCC), alleging the group disseminated misleading and dangerous health information regarding vaccination. The complaint was eventually upheld, resulting in revocation of the group&#x27;s charity licence and the issuing of a public warning by the HCCC. Both these actions were overturned following a successful Supreme Court challenge by the AVN in 2011.

Cannane has continued to follow the AVN, most recently on &quot;The Drum,&quot; discussing the appearance of Dorey at the Woodford Folk Festival.

In November 2010 he was recognised for &quot;...his honest and diligent approach to journalism and the pursuit of truth in all of its aspects and wherever it may lead&quot; at the Australian Skeptics National Convention where he was also a speaker.

He has worked as a reporter and fill in presenter on ABC1&#x27;s late night news and current affairs program, &quot;Lateline&quot;, presenter of &quot;The Drum&quot; on ABC News 24 and has appeared on Ten&#x27;s &quot;The 7pm Project&quot;.

From April 2016 until July 2018, Cannane was ABC&#x27;s Europe Correspondent, based in London before joining the ABC&#x27;s Investigations Unit as a reporter.

In May 2021, Cannane was named as the new chief of the ABC&#x27;s Europe bureau.

===Defamation case===
In September 2016, Cannane published &quot;Fair Game: The Incredible Untold Story of Scientology in Australia&quot;, which prompted a defamation suit to be brought against Cannane and HarperCollins by doctors John Gill and John Herron who were involved in the Australian Chelmsford deep sleep scandal.

In his book, Cannane referenced the Chelmsford Royal Commission which exposed practices which took place at the Chelmsford Private Hospital. In 2018, HarperCollins unsuccessfully applied to have the case thrown out due to the unreasonable expectation of Cannane being required to prove the findings of the royal commission.

After an eight-week trial which was held entirely on Microsoft Teams due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the lawsuit was dismissed in late 2020 with Justice Jayne Jagot ruling in favour of Cannane and HarperCollins with Gill and Herron ordered to pay costs.

According to Jagot, as a medical practitioner Herron &quot;had no residual reputation to be protected&quot; while she said Gill was &quot;held in very low estimation by the relevant sector&quot; prior to the release of Cannane&#x27;s book. Jagot also accused Herron and Gill of attempting to &quot;rewrite history&quot;. The judgement also stated that Cannane had established a defence of qualified privilege.

Gill and Herron appealed the decision to the full Federal Court in August 2021 because they believed the use 26 year old reports prepared by dead expert witnesses from a Royal Commission doesn&#x27;t contribute to a fair trial upon their behalf. Additionally Gill and Herron&#x27;s appeal also relied upon the idea that Cannane and HarperCollins should not have been granted qualified privilege as a defence against defamation. In 2022, the Federal Court heard the appeal and unanimously agreed that, contrary to Justice Jagot&#x27;s original findings, Cannane&#x27;s defence of qualified privilege was not justified and therefore would not be available to him and HarperCollins as a defence against defamation. The Federal Court of appeal, consisting of justices Steven Rares, Michael Lee and Micheal Wigney, agreed unanimously that fundamental errors were made in the original trial by Jagot and that this would in turn justify a retrial. The Federal Court&#x27;s main contention with Jagot&#x27;s original findings was that they primarily relied upon multiple Royal Commission expert reports prepared by doctors who are now deceased. All three judges took issue with the fact that the expert witnesses who authored the reports used in the Royal Commission and then later in Cannane&#x27;s defamation trial were not available for cross examination. Additionally the expert witness who authored the reports did not state with clarity or even at all, the facts and assumptions on which their decisions were based. Furthermore, they failed to elaborate upon the process of reasoning they used when writing said reports. The appeal additionally dismissed Jagot&#x27;s ruling that Cannane&#x27;s writings would fall under qualified privilege as a defence against defamation. Cannane was of the belief that he would not be able to obtain an accurate account of events from Mr John Herron and or Dr John Gill, however all three justices agreed that this didn&#x27;t make it reasonable upon Cannane&#x27;s and HarperCollins&#x27; behalf to completely disregard their account of what occurred. The Federal Court stated that Mr Cannane had made a deliberate choice not to obtain and include an account told from Dr Gill and Mr Herron&#x27;s view.

Following the Federal Court ruling, Cannane and HarperCollins appealed to the High Court of Australia in an attempt to get the Federal Court&#x27;s findings overturned. The case for appeal was heard by the High Court of Australia on 17 February 2023. The High Court denied Cannane and HarperCollins&#x27; application for an appeal of the Federal Court&#x27;s findings. Therefore, in the upcoming retrial Cannane and HarperCollins are unable to use qualified privilege and the Royal Commission reports to defend themselves against the claim of defamation against Dr Gill and Mr Herron.

<text>This page shows the results of leadership elections in the Saskatchewan Progress Party, formerly known as the Saskatchewan Liberal Party, covering the period from 1905 to the present day. All leadership contests in the Saskatchewan Progress Party have been determined by delegated conventions.

==Liberal leadership convention, 1905==

(Held on August 16, 1905.)

*Thomas Walter Scott acclaimed

(Note: this convention was held a few weeks before Saskatchewan was officially proclaimed as a Canadian province.)

==Developments, 1905-1926==

Walter Scott resigned as premier and party leader in 1916, and was replaced by William M. Martin on October 20 of that year. Martin was selected by the Liberal parliamentary caucus; it is assumed that he was subsequently confirmed without opposition at a provincial Liberal convention.

Martin, in turn, resigned in 1922, and was replaced by Charles A. Dunning on April 5 of that year. Dunning, like Martin, was chosen by caucus; it is also assumed that he was later confirmed without opposition by the party.

==Liberal leadership convention, 1926==

(Held on February 25, 1926.)

*GARDINER, James G. acclaimed

(Note: A.P. McNab, S.J. Latta and C.M. Hamilton were also nominated at the convention, but all three withdrew to make the choice of Gardiner unanimous.)

==Developments, 1926-1946==

Gardiner resigned as Premier and party leader in 1935 to enter the federal cabinet of W.L.M. King. On October 31, 1935, William John Patterson was the unanimous choice of the provincial Liberal council to take his before. It is assumed that Patterson was approved without opposition at a subsequent party convention.

==Liberal leadership convention, 1946==

(Held on August 6, 1946.)

*TUCKER, Walter 373
*E.M. Culliton 250

<doc id="1021012" wikidata="Q123179" url="?curid=1021012" title="Peter Zumthor">
<text>Peter Zumthor (; born 26 April 1943) is a Swiss architect whose work is frequently described as uncompromising and minimalist. Though managing a relatively small firm, he is the winner of the 2009 Pritzker Prize and 2013 RIBA Royal Gold Medal.

==Early life==
Zumthor was born in Basel, Switzerland. His father was a cabinet-maker, which exposed him to design from an early age and led him to become an apprentice for a carpenter later in 1958. He studied at the Kunstgewerbeschule (arts and crafts school) in his native city starting in 1963.

In 1966, Zumthor studied industrial design and architecture as an exchange student at Pratt Institute in New York. In 1968, he became conservationist architect for the Department for the Preservation of Monuments of the canton of Graubünden. This work on historic restoration projects gave him a further understanding of construction and the qualities of different rustic building materials. 

As his practice developed, Zumthor was able to incorporate his knowledge of materials into Modernist construction and detailing. His buildings explore the tactile and sensory qualities of spaces and materials while retaining a minimalist feel. It has been said that &quot;Zumthor’s key building material is light.&quot;

==Career==
Zumthor founded his own firm in 1979. His practice grew quickly and he accepted more international projects.

Zumthor has taught at University of Southern California Institute of Architecture and SCI-ARC in Los Angeles (1988), the Technical University of Munich (1989), Tulane University (1992), and the Harvard Graduate School of Design (1999). Since 1996, he has been a professor at the Accademia di Architettura di Mendrisio.

His best known projects are the Kunsthaus Bregenz (1997), a shimmering glass and concrete cube that overlooks Lake Constance (Bodensee) in Austria; the cave-like thermal baths in Vals, Switzerland (1999); the Swiss Pavilion for Expo 2000 in Hannover, an all-timber structure intended to be recycled after the event; the Kolumba Diocesan Museum (2007), in Cologne; and the Bruder Klaus Field Chapel, on a farm near Wachendorf.

In 1993, Zumthor won the competition for a museum and documentation center on the horrors of Nazism to be built on the site of Gestapo headquarters in Berlin. Zumthor&#x27;s submission called for an extended three-story building with a framework consisting of concrete rods. The project, called the Topography of Terror, was partly built and then abandoned when the government decided not to go ahead for financial reasons. The unfinished building was demolished in 2004. 

In 1999, Zumthor was selected as the only foreign architect to participate in Norway&#x27;s National Tourist Routes Project, with two projects, the Memorial in Memory of the Victims of the Witch Trials in Varanger, a collaboration with Louise Bourgeois (completed in 2010), and a rest area/museum on the site of an abandoned zinc mine.

For the Dia Art Foundation in Beacon, New York, Zumthor designed a gallery that was to house the &quot;360° I Ching&quot; sculpture by Walter de Maria; though the project was never completed. Zumthor is the only foreign architect to participate, with two projects, the Memorial in Memory of the Victims of the Witch Trials in Varanger, a collaboration with Louise Bourgeois (2011), and a rest area/museum on the site of the abandoned Allmannajuvet zinc mines, in operation from 1882 to 1898, in Norway (2016). In November 2009, it was revealed that Zumthor is working on a major redesign for the campus of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Recently, he turned down an opportunity to consider a new library for Magdalen College, Oxford. He was selected to design the Serpentine Gallery&#x27;s annual summer pavilion with designer Piet Oudolf in 2011.
In 2023, the Werkraum Haus – designed 10 years earlier by Zumthor – showed 40 of his architectural models, including some that have never been shown to the public before.

Currently, Zumthor works out of his small studio with around 30 employees, in Haldenstein, near the city of Chur, in Switzerland.

==Recognition==

In 1994, he was elected to the Academy of Arts, Berlin. In 1996, he was made an honorary member of the Bund Deutscher Architekten (BDA). In 1998, Zumthor received the Carlsberg Architectural Prize for his designs of the Kunsthaus Bregenz in Bregenz, Austria and the Thermal Baths at Vals, Switzerland (see below). He won the Mies van der Rohe Award for European Architecture in 1999. Recently, he was awarded Praemium Imperiale in (2008) and the Pritzker Architecture Prize (2009). In 2012, he was awarded the RIBA Royal Gold Medal. On the occasion of his 80th birthday in 2023, the F.A.Z. called Zumthor &quot;the great magician of minimalism.&quot;

==Literature==

Zumthor&#x27;s work is largely unpublished in part because of his philosophical belief that architecture must be experienced first hand. His published written work is mostly narrative and phenomenological.

===&quot;Thinking Architecture&quot;===

In &quot;Thinking Architecture&quot; Peter Zumthor expresses his motivation in designing buildings that have an emotional connection and possess a powerful and unmistakable presence and personality. It is illustrated throughout with color photographs by Laura J. Padgett of Zumthor&#x27;s new home and studio in Haldenstein.

To me, buildings can have a beautiful silence that I associate with attributes such as composure, self-evidence, durability, presence, and integrity, and with warmth and sensuousness as well; a building that is being itself, being a building, not representing anything, just being. The sense that I try to instil into materials is beyond all rules of composition, and their tangibility, smell, and acoustic qualities are merely elements of the language we are obliged to use. Sense emerges when I succeed in bringing out the specific meanings of certain materials in my buildings, meanings that can only be perceived in just this way in this one building. When I concentrate on a specific site or place for which I am going to design a building, when I try to plumb its depths, its form, its history, and its sensuous qualities, images of other places start to invade this process of precise observation: images of places I know and that once impressed me, images of ordinary or special places places that I carry with me as inner visions of specific moods and qualities; images of architectural situations, which emanate from the world of art, or films, theater or literature.

===&quot;Atmospheres&quot;===

&quot;Atmospheres&quot; is a poetics of architecture and a window into Zumthor&#x27;s personal sources of inspiration. In nine short, illustrated chapters framed as a process of self-observation, Zumthor describes what he has on his mind as he sets about creating the atmosphere of his houses: images of spaces and buildings that affect him are every bit as important as particular pieces of music or books that inspire him.

From the composition and &quot;presence&quot; of the materials to the handling of proportions and the effect of light, this poetics of architecture enables the reader to recapitulate what really matters in the process of house design. In conclusion, Peter Zumthor has described what really constitutes an architectural atmosphere as &quot;this singular density and mood, this feeling of presence, well-being, harmony, beauty...under whose spell I experience what I otherwise would not experience in precisely this way.&quot;

===&quot;Peter Zumthor Therme Vals&quot;===

&quot;Therme Vals&quot; is the only book-length study of this singular building. It features the architect&#x27;s original sketches and plans for its design as well as Hélène Binet’s striking photographs of the structure. Architectural scholar Sigrid Hauser contributes essays on such topics as &quot;Artemis/Diana,&quot; &quot;Baptism,&quot; &quot;Mikvah,&quot; and &quot;Spring&quot;—drawing out the connections between the elemental nature of the spa and mythology, bathing, and purity.

Annotations by Peter Zumthor on his design concept and the building process elucidate the structure&#x27;s symbiotic relationship to its natural surroundings, revealing, for example, why he insisted on using locally quarried stone. Therme Vals&#x27;s scenic design elements, and Zumthor&#x27;s contributions to this book, reflect the architect&#x27;s commitment to the essential and his disdain for needless architectural flourishes.

===&quot;Seeing Zumthor&quot;===
&quot;Seeing Zumthor&quot; represents a unique collaboration between Zumthor and Swiss photographer Hans Danuser, containing Danuser&#x27;s images of buildings created by Zumthor. More than twenty years ago, in a milestone event of twentieth-century architectural photography, Danuser photographed, at Zumthor&#x27;s invitation, two buildings: the protective structure built for archaeological excavations in Chur and St Benedict&#x27;s Chapel in Sumvitg. When first shown in exhibition, those photos ignited a lively debate that has been revived with a recent exhibition of Danuser&#x27;s photographs of Zumthor&#x27;s most famous work, the spa at Therme Vals. &quot;Seeing Zumthor&quot; collects these three important series of Danuser&#x27;s pictures and includes essays by leading art historians exploring the relationship between the two seemingly different disciplines or architecture and photography.

=== &quot;Dear to Me&quot; ===
In summer 2017, Peter Zumthor curated the exhibition &quot;Dear to Me&quot; at the Kunsthaus Bregenz, marking the twentieth anniversary of one of his most famous designs. Part of the program were conversations with philosophers, curators, historians, composers, writers, photographers, collectors, and craftsmen that Zumthor had invited to contribute to the exhibition. His dialogues with them offer insights into the thoughts and practice of fascinating personalities. Together with his counterparts, he explores artistic preferences and practices, reasonings, as well as practical knowledge from artisanal experience. In &quot;Dear to Me&quot;, Zumthor&#x27;s equally serious and serene conversations with Anita Albus, Aleida Assmann, Marcel Beyer, Hélène Binet, Hannes Böhringer, Renate Breuss, Claudia Comte, Bice Curiger, Esther Kinsky, Ralf Konersmann, Walter Lietha, Olga Neuwirth, Rebecca Saunders, Karl Schlögel, Martin Seel, Rudolf Walli, and Wim Wenders are collected in seventeen booklets held together in an exquisitely manufactured box. Wim Wenders will also make a film about Zumthor.

<doc id="1021022" wikidata="Q1136692" url="?curid=1021022" title="The Immoral Mr. Teas">
<text>The Immoral Mr. Teas is the first commercially successful film of director Russ Meyer, released in 1959. The film was described as a nudist comedy, and was noted for exhibiting extensive female nudity. The film cost $24,000 to produce, and eventually grossed more than $1.5 million on the independent/exploitation circuit.

==Plot==
The only sound in the film is the voice of a narrator and a very monotonic musical theme.

Mr. Teas is a door-to-door salesman for dentist appliances who makes deliveries on his bicycle. Teas is a clumsy and shy man, who likes to watch happy couples, and who daydreams when looking down the necklines of women he meets. The only way that he is able to have sex is with a prostitute. After undergoing surgery at the dentist, Teas realizes that the anesthetic has overcome his inhibitions, and given him x-ray vision, enabling him to see all women without their clothes. He is happy at first, but gradually begins to be embarrassed. For example, he goes to the river, and sees three women swimming, and he sees them as naked. The three women are those he sees daily: the dental nurse, a secretary, and a waitress in the bar. Teas decides to go to a psychoanalyst, and he also sees her naked. The voiceover says: &quot;On the other hand, some men are happy to be sick.&quot;

==Cast==
*Bill Teas as Mr Teas

==Background==
Before this film was released, the only moving pictures exhibiting extensive nudity were either underground (covertly produced and distributed) pornographic films, typically distributed &quot;under the counter&quot; in 16 mm black and white movies, or naturist pictures, openly displayed in specialized movie theaters, usually under the cover of exhibiting the fun and freedom of nudism in naturist reserves.

Russ Meyer was approached to make a &quot;nudie&quot; film by burlesque impresario Pete De Cenzie, who was interested in making an American version of the nudist camp films then coming in from Europe. Meyer agreed provided he could do something with a scriptline and that he could use &quot;well built girls instead of the usual unattractive types that populated nudist films.&quot;

He hired his friend Bill Teas. &quot;I had no idea when we started,&quot; he said. &quot;All I had was Teas, three girls and my dentist and my attorney for assistants.&quot;

Meyer says his dentist agreed to let his office be used on the weekend for filming. The script was made up as they went along and the voice over narration was added later.

Meyer said he shot the film in four days &quot;I knew exactly how it was going to begin, I knew how it would be in the middle, I knew how it would be at the end. I based it on my experiences doing stills for &quot;Playboy&quot;. There&#x27;s a lot of stuff on the girl next door, the common man, the voyeur - little nude photo essays.&quot;

==Nudity==
&quot;The Immoral Mr. Teas&quot; was the first American &quot;above ground&quot; movie since the pre-code, early sound era to show female nudity without the pretext of naturism. It is considered to be the first commercially viable American &quot;skin flick&quot;, and popularized the nudie cutie genre.

In a 1960 Philadelphia court case, the film was held not to be obscene, although the judge described the film as &quot;vulgar, pointless and in bad taste&quot;.

The movie consists of a series of short scenes. In a sense, no one is actually naked; the only nudity seen is through the viewpoint and vivid imagination of Mr. Teas. Mr. Teas&#x27;s mental constructions extend beyond the nudity (always exclusively of female characters) – there is an underlying surrealism in Mr. Teas&#x27;s imagination, which results in a number of genuinely bizarre situations.

==A typical scene==
Mr. Teas attends an appointment with his dentist, who must perform an extraction of a molar. The dentist has an assistant (Marilyn Wesley), who is stunningly beautiful, and not-quite modestly dressed. The application of analgesics releases Mr. Teas&#x27;s fertile imagination, and the scene is shown through this viewpoint. Rather than the typical equipment-cluttered dental office, only a dentist, a dental chair, Mr. Teas, and the assistant are present against a stark and simple background. Only, now, the assistant is completely nude. As the procedure is completed, the dentist removes the molar from Mr. Teas&#x27;s mouth, but rather than only a small object in the extraction pliers, the molar has the appearance of a single large staghorn (deer antler) with a number of points. The body of the &quot;molar&quot; is white, and each tip (representing the roots of the molar) is colored a bloody red. Mr. Teas has paid a price for his lustful imagination.

==Reception==
The film was a big box office success.

According to Roger Ebert, &quot;As plots go, &quot;Teas&quot; was not terrifically subtle. It is essentially a silent comedy with counterpoint narration. But the movie&#x27;s jolly irony overcame any feeling of embarrassment or self-consciousness on the part of audiences who were, for the most part, seeing a nude woman on the screen for the first time.&quot;
Meyer called the film&#x27;s success &quot;a fluke, an absolute fluke.&quot;

According to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, the film led to over a hundred imitations being made in the next 12 months.

<doc id="1021033" wikidata="Q7409161" url="?curid=1021033" title="Same-sex marriage in Nunavut">
<text>Same-sex marriage has been legal in Nunavut since 20 July 2005, when royal assent was granted to the federal &quot;Civil Marriage Act&quot; making same-sex marriage in Canada legally recognised in all provinces and territories. On this date, Nunavut began granting marriage licences to same-sex couples. Previously, in October 2003, Premier Paul Okalik had announced that same-sex marriages performed in other jurisdictions would be legally recognized in Nunavut.

==Background==
On 30 October 2003, Premier Paul Okalik made the following statement:
Okalik further suggested that the territory would perform same-sex divorces should the issue arise. He also succeeded in passing a territorial human rights code banning discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. As well, Nancy Karetak-Lindell, Liberal MP for the riding of Nunavut, was re-elected in the 2006 election after having supported same-sex marriage; a stance for which she faced criticism from some residents of Coral Harbour. After the February 2004 Nunavut general election, Okalik&#x27;s only opponent for the premiership, Tagak Curley, ran on the basis that he would repeal the territory&#x27;s human rights legislation on sexual orientation, and would not recognize same-sex marriages. During the same general election, several candidates, including Patterk Netser, Rebekah Williams, and Manitok Thompson, all spoke out against same-sex marriage.

In 2005, a group of Inuit leaders called same-sex marriage &quot;disruptive to traditional values&quot; at a meeting of the Justice Committee of the House of Commons. Chris Trott, an associate professor at the University of Manitoba, said, &quot;the elders are probably correct to say formal gay relationships are an example of southern influence. Practically speaking, liberation for Inuit homosexuals came in the form of the English language. In the encounter with the west, and in speaking English, they have a way of talking about that now. Once people find the vocabulary to articulate what they&#x27;re feeling, then they say it. And I think that&#x27;s what&#x27;s going on now. Young people now have a way of speaking about it.&quot; Anglican and Pentecostal religious leaders were adamantly opposed to the legalization of same-sex marriage in Nunavut, often referring to it as &quot;contrary to Inuit culture&quot;. A local in Iqaluit who was asked to comment for the &quot;Nunatsiaq News&quot; said &quot;it&#x27;s interesting to see religious leaders offering opinions on how Inuit should behave when Christianity itself is a southern import.&quot;

==Territorial legislation==
In October 2011, the Legislative Assembly of Nunavut amended the &quot;Marriage Act&quot; (, ; Inuinnaqtun: ; ) and several other acts relating to family law and children law. The bill passed by the Assembly replaced the expression &quot;husband and wife&quot; with the gender-neutral term &quot;spouses&quot; in section 43(4) and added &quot;or spouse&quot; in section 13(b). The &quot;Adoption Act&quot; was also amended to allow same-sex couples to adopt children. The bill received royal assent by Commissioner Edna Elias on 31 October 2011.

Section 13 of the &quot;Marriage Act&quot;, entitled &quot;Civil Marriage&quot;, reads:
==Marriage statistics==
From July 2005 to October 2006, only one same-sex couple married in Nunavut, the lowest among all of Canada&#x27;s provinces and territories. The first same-sex marriage involving an Inuk man was performed in June 2017 in Iqaluit between Joe Kucharski and Dwayne Nowdlak. There had already been one marriage for an Inuk lesbian couple. The first same-sex marriage in Cambridge Bay was performed between Jason Koblogina and Kyle Mercer in August 2018.

The 2016 Canadian census showed that were 25 same-sex couples living in Nunavut, though it is unknown how many were married, in a common-law marriage or cohabiting.

==Religious performance==
In July 2019, the synod of the Anglican Church of Canada narrowly rejected a motion to authorize same-sex marriage and allow clergy in the church to officiate at such marriages. Instead, the church synod passed a resolution known as &quot;A Word to the Church&quot;, allowing its dioceses to choose whether to bless and perform same-sex marriages. Clergy of the Diocese of The Arctic, including Bishop David Parsons, have been vocally opposed to the solemnization of same-sex marriages within the church. Following the passage of the resolution, several dioceses, including those of Ottawa and Rupert&#x27;s Land, announced they would permit their clergy to solemnize same-sex marriages in accordance with the new resolution passed by the church synod. The Diocese of The Arctic chose to distance itself from these dioceses, but, responding to concerns that it might be leaving the Anglican Church of Canada, it released a statement, &quot;The Diocese of the Arctic remains a diocese within the Anglican Church of Canada, but must distance itself from those who violate the marriage canon. The implication of this is a state of &#x27;impaired communion&#x27;.&quot;

Some other religious organizations perform same-sex marriages in their places of worship, including the United Church of Canada, Quakers, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada, and the Canadian Unitarian Council.

<text>A secret trial is a trial that is not open to the public or generally reported in the news, especially any in-trial proceedings. Generally, no official record of the case or the judge&#x27;s verdict is made available. Often there is no indictment.

Secret trials have been characteristic of many dictatorships in the modern era, but are also used in many democratic nations, with the explanation of being necessary for national security. They are a hotly debated topic in many circles, but are generally accepted in the western world as they are seen as protecting the &quot;&quot;. 

==Australia==
It is possible that some wholly-secret trials occurred in Australia during World War I or World War II.
In the 21st century, several secret trials have occurred or are set to occur in Australia:
* In 2018, &quot;Witness J&quot; was tried and imprisoned by the Australian government in near-total secrecy. The existence of Witness J was discovered only by chance by a judge, and the scant details were reported to the media. The Attorney General of the Australian Capital Territory, where Witness J was imprisoned, was not aware of the case. Witness J is a former employee of one of Australia&#x27;s intelligence agencies, but the identity and alleged crimes are still not public. Independent National Security Legislation Monitor James Renwick said that the level of secrecy in Witness J&#x27;s case was &quot;unprecedented&quot;.
* From 2018 to 2021, the lawyer Bernard Collaery and &quot;Witness K&quot; were prosecuted by the Australian government with a high degree of secrecy, and part of their upcoming trial will be held in secret. The Liberal-National Coalition government of John Howard had helped secure the independence of impoverished Timor Leste from Indonesia. Negotiations were underway over fossil fuel deposits located in the sea between Timor Leste and Australia. The Howard government spied on the new Timor Leste government, and used that as leverage in negotiations to aid Australian company Woodside Petroleum. Collaery and Witness K are accused of sharing this with the Australian media and the Timor Leste government. Collaery was Witness K&#x27;s lawyer at the time. Witness K has pleaded guilty, while Collaery has not. Indictments against Collaery were dropped on 7 July 2022 by new Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus SC.
* From 2018 to 2021, the former military lawyer David McBride was prosecuted by the Australian government for leaking details of alleged war crimes committed by Australian soldiers in Afghanistan. McBride reported the crimes to superiors in the Australian Defence Force but felt that the evidence was not being taken seriously. He went to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, which in 2017 published a series of articles on the killings and corpse-mutilations called &quot;The Afghan Files&quot;. Then, the military began to investigate the war crimes, which led to the 2020 Brereton Report. Part of McBride&#x27;s upcoming trial will be held in secret. On 14 May 2024, McBride was sentenced to 5 years and 8 months in prison, with a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months.

==Soviet Union==
Although the Great Purges in the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin are best remembered for the Moscow Trials, show trials in which the court became a parody of justice, most of the victims of the Terror were tried in secret. Mikhail Tukhachevsky and his fellow Red Army officers were tried in secret by a military tribunal, and their executions were announced only after the fact. The presiding judge of the Moscow Trials, Vasili Ulrikh, also presided over large numbers of secret trials, lasting only a few minutes, in which he would quickly speak his way through a pre-formulated charge and verdict.

==United Kingdom==
In the United Kingdom, one of the most notorious secret courts was the Star Chamber under King Charles I of England in the early 17th century. The abuses of the Star Chamber were one of the rallying points of the opposition that organized around Oliver Cromwell and ultimately resulted in the execution of the deposed king. The term &quot;star chamber&quot; became a generalized term for a court that was accountable to no one (except the chief executive) and was used to suppress political dissent or eliminate the enemies of the regime.

&quot;R v Incedal and Rarmoul-Bouhadjar&quot; (2014) was to be the first British trial to be held entirely in secret. However, the Court of Appeal blocked
full secrecy.

==United States==

The FISA Courts of the national intelligence apparatus are by design secret courts and are empowered by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 to conduct secret trials and to impose secret punishments. Counsel arguing in the court are also subject to a secrecy order against disclosure of information about any cases in front of the court. Individuals who have been targeted in the court are also subjected to secrecy orders. The court sits &quot;ex parte&quot;, in the absence of anyone but the judge and the government present at the hearings. That, combined with the minimal number of requests that are rejected by the court, has led experts to characterize it as a rubber stamp; the former National Security Agency analyst Russ Tice called it a &quot;kangaroo court with a rubber stamp&quot;.

<doc id="1021038" wikidata="Q8074219" url="?curid=1021038" title="Zoot Suit (play)">
<text>Zoot Suit is a play written by Luis Valdez, featuring incidental music by Daniel Valdez and Lalo Guerrero. &quot;Zoot Suit&quot; is based on the Sleepy Lagoon murder trial and the Zoot Suit Riots. Debuting in 1979, &quot;Zoot Suit&quot; was the first Chicano play on Broadway. In 1981, Luis Valdez also directed a filmed version of the play, combining stage and film techniques.

==Plot==
&quot;Zoot Suit&quot; tells the story of Henry Reyna and the 38th Street Gang, who were tried for the Sleepy Lagoon murder in Los Angeles, during World War II. After a run-in with a neighboring gang at the local lovers lane, Sleepy Lagoon, the 38th Street Gang gets into a fight at a party, where a young man is murdered. Discriminated against for their zoot suit-wearing Chicano identity, twenty-two members of the 38th Street Gang are placed on trial for the murder, found guilty, and sentenced to life in San Quentin prison. Meanwhile, in Los Angeles, Henry&#x27;s brother Rudy is beaten and stripped of his zoot suit during the Zoot Suit Riots.

Through the efforts of George and other lawyers, as well as activist-reporter Alice, with whom Henry has a brief romantic encounter, the boys win their court appeal and are freed. The play ends with a Reyna family reunion as Henry returns home and Rudy is about to leave to join the Marines. The scene suggests that it is not the happy ending we expect, however, as multiple endings of Henry&#x27;s story are suggested: that he returned to prison and drug abuse, died in the war in Korea and was awarded the Medal of Honor posthumously, or married Della and had five children.

==Historical context==

===The Sleepy Lagoon Murder===
&quot;Zoot Suit&quot; is based on the Sleepy Lagoon Murder of 1942 and the Zoot Suit Riots of 1943 in Los Angeles, California. On August 1, 1942 José Díaz was at a birthday party at the Williams Ranch. A disturbance occurred around 11:00 p.m. when a group of twenty white men from the Downey suburb arrived uninvited, complaining about a lack of beer. The group from Downey Gang were kicked out of the party after demanding more beer.

Meanwhile, a group of men and women from 39th street drove their cars to the nearby swimming hole and lovers lane, dubbed &quot;Sleepy Lagoon&quot;, also on the Williams Ranch. Among the group were Henry Leyvas and his girlfriend Dora Baca, from whom the characters Henry Reyna and Della are contrived. Also with them was friend Bobby Telles. As the group socialized, three men pulled up and began yelling insults, met equally with words from Leyvas. The three drove off. The 38th street group wandered off until they heard a commotion from the parked cars, where Leyvas and Baca remained. A group of about sixteen men from the Downey gang were beating Leyvas and Baca, prompting members of the 38th street group to defend their friends. After the Downey group left, the group from 38th street gang left to gather more of their group, prior to returning to the Williams Ranch.

The group arrived at Sleepy Lagoon around 1:00 a.m. on the morning of the 2nd, to find no one, so someone suggested the Downey gang had moved to the party at the bunkhouse nearby at the Williams Ranch. At the party, the Downey gang was not to be found. Yet, somehow a fight broke out between the party goers and the 38th street gang. The fight was brief, ending when someone yelled the police were coming. In the aftermath of the fight, the party-throwers, the Delgadillos, discovered the body of José Díaz along the road, who had left the party shortly before the 38th street group arrived. His pockets were turned inside out. He was rushed to a hospital where he died an hour and a half after admission, with a concussion and two stab wounds. The circumstances around Díaz&#x27;s death still remain undetermined.

===&quot;The People v. Zammora et al.&quot;===
In the process of investigating the murder of José Díaz, hundreds of young men and women in the L.A. area were brought in for police processing. Among the suspects arrested, several were severely beaten during questioning, including Henry Leyvas, Lupe Leyvas, Benny Alvarez, and Eugene Carpio, and Manuel Reyes. Twenty-two men were placed on trial as a group, under the defense of seven attorneys in &quot;the People v. Zammora et al.&quot; George Shibley later joined as an attorney on the case, winning favor from the defendants and their families for his attempts to communicate in Spanish. Alice McGrath was hired by Shibley to take notes on the trial. Though the murder weapon was never produced, after six days of deliberation, only five of the twenty-two young men were found &quot;not guilty.&quot; The other seventeen young men were convicted of murdering José Díaz, including Henry Leyvas, who with José Ruíz and Robert Telles, was convicted of murder in the first degree and two counts of assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill. Leyvas, Ruíz, and Telles were sentenced to life in prison, while the other young men were sentenced to one to five years.

The ruling was reversed in October 1944 and the men were released, due to the efforts of the Sleepy Lagoon Defense Committee, with Alice McGrath as executive secretary. However, many of the young men returned to prison, including Henry Leyvas.

===The Zoot Suit Riots===

With rising tension between the zoot suiters and military servicemen in the L.A. area, what is known as the Zoot Suit Riots began on June 3, 1943 when a group of sailors claimed to have been robbed and beaten by Pachuco. Servicemen beat zoot suit wearing civilians with clubs and other makeshift weapons, and stripped them of their suits. Approximately ninety-four civilians and eighteen servicemen were treated for serious injuries, with all of the ninety four arrested, but only two of the servicemen. One source claims the Riot continued for five nights, when military and police ended the violence. However, a second source states that the span of the Riots was nine days.

==Production history==

===Stage debut===
&quot;Zoot Suit&quot; premiered at The Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles on April 20, 1978. This production with Center Theatre Group marked the first professionally produced Chicano play. The initial ten-day run in April sold out in two days. An audience of season ticket holders and local Mexican-Americans gave standing ovations each evening of the performances at the Mark Taper Forum. A second run began in August and tickets sold out yet again. This extended run was held at the Aquarius Theatre, Los Angeles.

===Broadway production===
The Broadway production debuted at the Winter Garden Theater on March 25, 1979, and closed on April 29 after 41 performances and 17 previews. The production was directed by Luis Valdez and featured choreography by Patricia Birch. Edward James Olmos&#x27; portrayal of El Pachuco earned him a Tony Award nomination for best featured actor in a play, as well as a Theatre World award.
&quot;Zoot Suit&quot; was the second Latino written and directed play produced on Broadway, coming second only to Miguel Piñero&#x27;s &quot;Short Eyes&quot; in 1974. While &quot;Short Eyes&quot; won two Obie Awards, as well as the New York Drama Critics&#x27; Circle Award for Best American Play, &quot;Zoot Suit&quot; ran a mere five weeks on Broadway.

Valdez also directed a filmed version of the play, combining stage and film techniques.

===30th anniversary production===
In April 2008, Alma Martinez, member of the original 1978 cast of &quot;Zoot Suit&quot; directed the 30 year anniversary production at Pomona College in Claremont, California. This was the first time since its stage debut in 1978 that &quot;Zoot Suit&quot; had been produced in the Los Angeles area. The two-week run managed to sell out prior to opening night, despite minimal advertisement, primarily in Latino publications. Many outreach opportunities were taken, including an alumni night, a staff appreciation performance, matinees allowing over 1,000 high school students to attend, and the development of a study guide for students attending the performances.

The alumni event featured a reunion of original 1978 cast members, as well as members of the film version of &quot;Zoot Suit&quot;. Luis Valdez and Alice McGrath, the community activist on whom Valdez based the character Alice, were given awards. Also in the audience were members of the family of Henry Leyvas, on whom Henry Reyna was based.

In casting the revival, Martinez cast across the Claremont University Consortium in search of Latino students. All of the Chicano roles featured actors making their stage debut, and the majority of the cast was composed of non-theatre majors. Assistant director Shakina Nayfack modified the script to reduce homophobic and sexist language where possible. Martinez cast a female in the traditionally male role of the Press.

===Center Theatre Group’s 50th Anniversary===

As part of the Center Theatre Group&#x27;s 50th Anniversary celebration, playwright and director Luis Valdez brought &quot;Zoot Suit&quot; to the Mark Taper Forum from January 31 to April 2, 2017. The play featured Rose Portillo and Daniel Valdez, who were original cast members from the 1978 production. Instead of reprising their roles of Henry Reyna and Della, respectively, they returned to the stage to play the roles of Henry Reyna&#x27;s parents. Rose Portillo was delighted to bring Zoot Suit to new audiences and stated, “I’m over the moon. It was a dream come true the first time. It’s a dream come true the second time, to come full circle and to work with Luis at the Taper, where Gordon Davidson and Luis were so influential on my artistic career. I’m looking forward to sharing &quot;Zoot Suit&quot; with a whole new crop of artists and audiences.” Similarly, Daniel Valdez said, “It’s great to come back to where it all started 38 years ago. I’m looking forward to inhabiting the world of &quot;Zoot Suit&quot; once again.” Academy Award nominated actor Demián Bichir also starred as El Pachuco.

==Criticism==
&quot;Zoot Suit&quot; was well received in its initial production in Los Angeles. In his review for &quot;Theatre Journal&quot;, Jules Aaron laudes the play for its ability to both entertain and make a political statement. Aaron also notes the emotional content of the play. Richard Eder for &quot;The New York Times&quot; echoed Aaron&#x27;s observations that the play is both entertaining and political. He adds that &quot;Zoot Suit&quot; is a blend of Cantinflas and Brecht. Eder adds his critique that the play is too specific to the Chicano community and lacks universality.

Valdez&#x27;s play did not receive the same feelings in New York City when it made its Broadway debut. Richard Eder voiced a different opinion of the Broadway staging from when he saw the production in L.A. Eder notes that the design elements lacked harmony, and that &quot;Zoot Suit&quot; failed to combine entertainment with symbolism, plot, and moral. A week later, a &quot;New York Times&quot; review by Walter Kerr criticizes Valdez for his use of clichés. Kerr also complains of the lack of emotional connection between Daniel Valdez and Miss Hensel, who play Henry and Alice, respectively.

==Music==
The songs threaded through &quot;Zoot Suit&quot; were written by Lalo Guerrero and the playwright&#x27;s brother Daniel Valdez. Guerrero, known as the father of Chicano music, wrote music detailing the Chicano culture during World War II, resulting in the feature of the songs in &quot;Zoot Suit&quot;. The music combines boogie-woogie and El Paso&#x27;s version of R&amp;B.

<text>The Mixed Blood Theatre Company is a professional multiracial theatre company in Minneapolis, Minnesota. It was founded in 1976 by artistic director Jack Reuler, to explore race via the use of theater.

==History==
Jack Reuler founded Mixed Blood in 1976 to explore issues around race within the theater framework. Mixed Blood operates out of an old Cedar-Riverside firehouse. 

In the 1990s Jack Reuler worked with Syl Jones, playwright who had formerly worked in the corporate setting, to create customized plays and workshops for corporate and governmental clients ranging from Medtronic and Honeywell to the William Mitchell College of Law and the Ramsey County Attorney&#x27;s Office. Syl Jones would write the play or workshop, merging his corporate experience with his playwriting skills. Jones formerly won accolades for his new works at Mixed Blood (&quot;Cincinnati Man&quot;) and Penumbra (&quot;Shine&quot;), both in 1992. 

Mixed Blood Theatre was the first company to use the Joe Dowling Studio in the Guthrie Theater with its play Yellowman in 2006.

In 2021 Jack Reuler&#x27;s retirement was announced and in 2022 Mark Valdez was announced as the new Artistic Director. 

==Works==

Mixed Blood&#x27;s plays range from chamber theatre to political satires. The theatre presents over 500 performances annually in the Alan Page Auditorium of its historic firehouse theatre, as well as in schools, churches, community centers, juvenile detention centers, and workplaces. Mixed Blood seeks to &quot;addresses injustices, inequities, and cultural collisions, providing a voice for the unheard—on stage, in the workplace, in the company’s own Cedar Riverside neighborhood and beyond.&quot; 

Mixed Blood is a member of Theatre Communications Group (TCG) and the National New Play Network (NNPN).

<doc id="1021051" wikidata="Q714010" url="?curid=1021051" title="Aldo Ray">
<text>Aldo Ray (born Aldo Da Re; September 25, 1926 – March 27, 1991) was an American actor of film and television. He began his career as a contract player for Columbia Pictures before achieving stardom through his roles in &quot;The Marrying Kind, Pat and Mike&quot; (which earned him a Golden Globe nomination), &quot;Let&#x27;s Do It Again,&quot; and &quot;Battle Cry.&quot; His athletic build and gruff, raspy voice saw him frequently typecast in &quot;tough guy&quot; roles throughout his career, which lasted well into the late 1980s. Though the latter part of his career was marked by appearances in low-budget B-movies and exploitation films, he still appeared occasionally in higher-profile features, including &quot;The Secret of NIMH&quot; (1982) and &quot;The Sicilian&quot; (1987).
In 1980, Ray was awarded Best Actor for his role in &quot;Sweet Savage&quot; from the Adult Film Association&#x27;s third Erotica Awards.

==Early life and education==
Ray was born Aldo Da Re in Pen Argyl, Pennsylvania, to an Italian family with five brothers (Mario, Guido, Dante, Dino, and Louis) and one sister (Regina). His brother Mario Da Re (1933–2010) lettered in football at USC from 1952 to 1954 and appeared as a contestant on the May 12, 1955, edition of Groucho Marx&#x27;s NBC-TV quiz show &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot;. His family moved to the small town of Crockett, California, when Aldo was four years old. His father worked as a laborer at the C&amp;H Sugar Refinery, the largest employer in the town. He attended John Swett High School, where he made the football team; he also coached swimming.

At age 18, during World War II in 1944, Ray entered the United States Navy, serving as a frogman until 1946; he saw action at Okinawa with UDT-17. Upon leaving the Navy in May 1946, he returned to Crockett. He studied and played football at Vallejo Junior College and then entered the University of California at Berkeley to study political science. (Ray later described himself as an &quot;arch conservative&quot; and a &quot;right-winger&quot;.) He left college in order to run for the office of constable of the Crockett Judicial District in Contra Costa County, California. &quot;I always knew I was going to be a big man, but I thought it would be in politics,&quot; he said.

== Career ==
===&quot;Saturday&#x27;s Hero&quot;===
In April 1950 Columbia Pictures sent a unit to San Francisco to look for some athletes to appear in a film they were making called &quot;Saturday&#x27;s Hero&quot; (1951). Aldo&#x27;s brother Guido saw an item in the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; about the auditions and asked his brother to drive him there. Director David Miller was more interested in Ray than in his brother because of his voice; also, Ray was comfortable talking to the camera owing to his political experience. He later recalled, &quot;They... said, &#x27;What&#x27;s wrong with your voice kid? Are you sick? If you&#x27;re sick you don&#x27;t belong here.&#x27; I said, &#x27;No, no, no, this is the way I&#x27;ve always spoken.&#x27; And they loved it.&quot; Ray would later retell this story in the trailer for &quot;Pat and Mike&quot;.

Ray signed a contract and was sent to Los Angeles for a screen test. He was cast in the small role of a cynical college football player opposite John Derek and Donna Reed.

Ray worked on the film between the primary and general elections. He was elected constable on June 6. &quot;I was 23 and a sort of child bride to the voters,&quot; he later said. &quot;The guy I ran against was a 16-year incumbent, and I destroyed him with 80 percent of the vote! I was going to work my way up to the U.S. Senate, see, and I would&#x27;ve, too.&quot;

Columbia picked up its option on Ray&#x27;s services and signed him to a seven-year contract. &quot;Of all the people in the picture they took up only one option—mine,&quot; he said. &quot;And I said, &#x27;Thank you, goodbye. I&#x27;m going home where I can be a big fish in my small pond. You can take this town (Hollywood) and shove it.&quot;

Columbia refused to release him from his contract and put him under suspension, giving him a leave of absence to work as constable. &quot;I told them I couldn&#x27;t care less, they could give me whatever they wanted,&quot; he said. Ray started his new job in November 1950.

===Hollywood stardom: &quot;The Marrying Kind&quot;===
After several months, Ray found &quot;the quiet life... monotonous&quot;, so he contacted Max Arnow, talent director at Columbia, and expressed interest in appearing in more movies. Four weeks later, Arnow called back, saying Columbia wanted to audition Ray for a small part in Judy Holliday&#x27;s new movie &quot;The Marrying Kind&quot;.

Ray went to Hollywood and did a screen test with the director, George Cukor. The first test went badly, but head of Columbia Harry Cohn liked Ray and asked for another test. The second one was done opposite (Miss) Jeff Donnell, whom Ray later married; it was more successful and Ray ended up being cast in the lead.

Harry Cohn felt the name &quot;Aldo Da Re&quot; was too close to &quot;Dare&quot; and wanted to change it to &quot;John Harrison&quot;; the actor refused and &quot;Aldo Ray&quot; was the compromise. He divorced his wife and resigned as constable in September 1951. His studio salary was $200 a week.

Cukor famously suggested that Ray go to ballet school because he walked too much like a football player. The director later talked about the actor:
He has a great advantage: the way his eyes are made. The light comes into them. There are certain people who have opaque eyes which refuse to catch the light. But his eyes had a certain glow and gave quite well in the photographed result. He did this silent scene very well lying there on the bed in the same room with Judy (Holliday). Then later he did comedy scenes with her—very difficult ones—and there were also emotional sequences where he broke down and cried. They were brilliant.
&quot;Cukor is hypersensitive to reality&quot;, recalled Ray. &quot;He told me exactly what to do and why. He explains everything and he knows exactly what he wants.&quot;

Ray&#x27;s performance was much praised. &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; later commented:
To give the performance he did in &quot;The Marrying Kind&quot; after so little previous experience was clear evidence that in Aldo Ray the screen had discovered one of its rare &quot;naturals&quot;. This was no carefully edited, tricked out performance, but a strikingly sincere and imaginative interpretation: an exceptional talent responding to a finely intuitive director... There was about him none of the personality assurance that extracts a special consideration of the actor as distinct from his role.
Cukor then cast Ray in a supporting role in &quot;Pat and Mike&quot;, starring Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn. Ray&#x27;s work in &quot;Pat and Mike&quot; led to his nomination, along with Richard Burton and Robert Wagner, for a Golden Globe as Best Newcomer. Burton won the award that year, but Ray&#x27;s career was launched. He said after two films with Cukor: &quot;I never needed direction again.&quot;

Ray said Spencer Tracy told him: &quot;Kid, I don&#x27;t know what it is that you got, and I got, and some of us have, but you can work in this business forever.&quot; &quot;That,&quot; said Ray, &quot;made me feel good, you know, coming from a guy like him. I never bowed down to anybody at Columbia or anywhere else, but my overall idea was, I&#x27;ll do whatever they tell me because it&#x27;s their business, not mine, and I&#x27;ve got to learn it.&quot;

===Columbia leading man===

Columbia Pictures head Harry Cohn liked Ray and wanted him for the role of Private Robert Prewitt in &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot; (1953), but Fred Zinnemann insisted Montgomery Clift be cast. However, other good roles followed instead. &quot;Because of Harry, all my first pictures were big hits, tremendously popular&quot;, Ray recalled.

Ray starred opposite Jane Wyman in &quot;Let&#x27;s Do It Again&quot; (1953), then followed this acting opposite Rita Hayworth in &quot;Miss Sadie Thompson&quot; (also 1953), the third film version of the W. Somerset Maugham story &quot;Rain&quot;. He also appeared in a production of &quot;Stalag 17&quot; at La Jolla Playhouse.

Ray was loaned to Warner Bros to appear in &quot;Battle Cry&quot; (1955), which was directed by Raoul Walsh, who would become one of Ray&#x27;s favorite directors. The film was a box-office hit—probably the most popular movie Ray ever made—although it led to his being typecast.

&quot;In some ways the tough soldier role locked me in&quot;, reflected Ray later. &quot;There were no sophisticated roles for me. I never seemed to get past master sergeant, though I always thought of myself as upper echelon.&quot;

===Clash with Columbia===
Ray was meant to appear in &quot;My Sister Eileen&quot; (1955) as The Wreck, but he walked off the set, claiming his role was too small, and had to be replaced by Dick York.

&quot;Battle Cry&quot; was a big hit at the box office, so Columbia gave Ray a lead role as a sergeant who marries a Japanese girl in &quot;Three Stripes in the Sun&quot; (originally &quot;The Gentle Wolfhound&quot;) (1955) and then loaned him to Paramount for &quot;We&#x27;re No Angels&quot; (also 1955), in which he starred with Humphrey Bogart, Peter Ustinov, Basil Rathbone, Leo G. Carroll, and Joan Bennett.

Ray was profiled in &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; as follows:
Aldo Ray&#x27;s technical advance in the four years since &quot;The Marrying Kind&quot; enables him now to work in subtler, more economical degree; there is an authoritative reserve and, still remarkably intact, the original rare lack of ostentation. All the same, his career seems to have become a nomadic drifting round the studios looking for the right kind of film. The good humour, the lenitive smile, the frog in the throat voice betray nothing of the disappointment the actor must feel after such exciting beginnings under Cukor&#x27;s guidance.
Ray was meant to appear in &quot;Jubal&quot; but refused because Columbia had made a profit on his loan-outs for &quot;Battle Cry&quot; and &quot;We&#x27;re No Angels&quot; but not paid Ray a bonus; Rod Steiger took the role instead. Ray was put on suspension.

Ray then refused to appear in &quot;Beyond Mombasa&quot; (1956) because he did not want to go on location. This led to his being replaced by Cornel Wilde and put under suspension again. However, the situation was resolved when he agreed to make &quot;Nightfall&quot; (1957), playing an artist who encounters a pair of ruthless bank robbers.

In 1956, in between appearances in &quot;Three Stripes In The Sun&quot; and &quot;Men in War&quot;, Ray worked in radio as a personality and announcer at hit music station WNDR in Syracuse, New York. A photo of Ray with a colleague in the WNDR studios, taken as part of a station promotional package, survives and can be found on a WNDR tribute website. By 1957, in any event, he had left WNDR and the radio business and returned to Hollywood.

On January 31, 1957, Ray appeared on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Ford Show Starring Tennessee Ernie Ford&quot;. He and Tennessee Ernie Ford did a comedy skit from a foxhole.

===Two with Anthony Mann===
Columbia loaned Ray out to Security Pictures (who released through United Artists) for him to appear in &quot;Men in War&quot; (1957) opposite Robert Ryan; it was directed by Anthony Mann, who became Ray&#x27;s favorite director. Ray was given 5% of the profits, which he later estimated at $70,000.

Ray was reunited with Security Pictures, Ryan, and Mann to star in &quot;God&#x27;s Little Acre&quot; (1958), an adaptation of Erskine Caldwell&#x27;s controversial novel directed by Mann starring Robert Ryan and Tina Louise.

By the seventh year of his contract with Columbia, Ray was earning $750 a week. He later said for the first ten years of his career he made less than $100,000. He expressed interest in producing his own vehicle, &quot;The Magic Mesa&quot;, from a script by Burt Kennedy, but it was not made.

Instead Ray appeared in an adaptation of David Goodis&#x27;s novel &quot;Nightfall&quot; (1957) directed by Jacques Tourneur and &quot;The Naked and the Dead&quot; (1958), an adaptation of Norman Mailer&#x27;s novel directed by Raoul Walsh. It was produced by Paul Gregory, who said:
Aldo Ray was drunk the entire time. He was a very sweet guy, but he was gone. He drank drank drank. Raoul Walsh would say, &quot;Let&#x27;s get him in the morning &#x27;cause in the afternoon it&#x27;s over.&quot;... I just could not get used to it, actors who got all this money and then didn&#x27;t behave professionally. The English actors have classical training. They perform like professionals. You take someone like Aldo Ray who was just picked up and catapulted into stardom, and then he was just a sponge for booze. He killed himself drinking, not living up to his moral contract.
Ray later admitted that producers were scared of casting him in projects because of his drinking.

===Leaving Columbia===

Ray had been popular with Harry Cohn because, in the actor&#x27;s words, &quot;[h]e took no shit from anybody and he saw that I was that kind of a guy, too.&quot; But when Cohn died in 1958, Columbia elected not to renew Ray&#x27;s contract and he decided to leave Hollywood. He later said, &quot;I never was an expatriate. I spent some time in England and Spain and Italy but I was never out of this country [the US] longer than six months.&quot;

He starred in 1959 in &quot;Four Desperate Men&quot; (&quot;The Siege of Pinchgut&quot;), filmed in Australia; it was the last movie produced by Ealing Studios (releasing through MGM) and a box office disappointment. According to &quot;Filmink&quot; his casting &quot;copped a lot of criticism, and it is odd to see him as an Australian resident, but he at least at looks like an ex con who might be willing to blow up a city. And being an American in Australia could have been made to work if they’d just bothered to explain it.&quot; Ray then appeared opposite Lucille Ball in an episode of &quot;Desilu Playhouse&quot;. He said he made more money from these two projects &quot;than I&#x27;d made the whole eight years before.&quot;

In 1959, Ray was cast as Hunk Farber in the episode &quot;Payment in Full&quot; of the NBC western series &quot;Riverboat&quot;. In the story line, Farber betrays his friend and employer to collect reward money that he uses to court his girlfriend, Missy.

Ray made &quot;The Day They Robbed the Bank of England&quot;, directed by John Guillermin, in the UK and &quot;Johnny Nobody&quot; in Ireland. He later described his British sojourn as a &quot;big mistake&quot; because none of his British films were widely seen in America.

&quot;Everything went well until the end of &#x27;62—then everything collapsed—including me&quot;, he later said. &quot;I didn&#x27;t take care of myself physically and mentally.&quot;

He hired a press agent, started taking better care of himself physically, and changed agents.

===Return to Hollywood===
Ray returned to Hollywood in 1964. He had a small role in &quot;Sylvia&quot; (1965) and made a pilot for a TV series financed by producer Joseph E. Levine, &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot; (an unsuccessful adaptation of the British TV series). &quot;I feel I shall have a complete regeneration of my career&quot;, he said in 1965.

He later appeared in &quot;What Did You Do in the War, Daddy?&quot;, &quot;Dead Heat on a Merry-Go-Round&quot;, and &quot;Welcome to Hard Times&quot;. He also made several guest appearances on television.

In 1966 Ray claimed, &quot;I&#x27;ve been turning down a lot of TV and B movies. I won&#x27;t consider anything but important roles in important pictures.&quot; He said he was &quot;almost independently wealthy&quot;, having saved and invested wisely in real estate from the times when his fee was $100,000 a film. He was interested in returning to politics but not until he had made &quot;at least&quot; four more movies. &quot;The ideal situation would be three films every two years.&quot;

In 1966 Ray played &quot;Jake&quot;, a deaf mute, in an episode of &quot;The Virginian&quot; entitled &quot;Jacob was a plain man&quot;.

He formed his own company, Crockett Productions, and bought two original scripts for films that were not made: &quot;Soldares&quot;, by Edwin Gottlieb, about the search for Pancho Villa, and &quot;Frogman, South Pacific&quot;, by William Zeck.

His best-known work of the 1960s was his portrayal of Sergeant Muldoon, alongside John Wayne, in &quot;The Green Berets&quot; (1968).

Ray starred in &quot;Kill a Dragon&quot;, shot in Hong Kong in 1966, and &quot;Suicide Commando&quot;, shot in Rome and Spain in 1968. He also made two television pilots in the 1960s; neither was picked up. 

===Career decline===
As the 1960s ended, Hollywood&#x27;s appetite for Ray&#x27;s machismo started to wane. Though he worked steadily in the 1970s, the quality of his roles diminished, and he was typically cast as a gruff and gravelly redneck.

By 1976, Ray was broke. He blamed this on his ex-wives and red tape that meant he could not develop his real estate properties. &quot;I lost it all&quot;, he said. &quot;And I am very, very bitter about it... The biggest mistake I ever made was discovering women. I only wish society had been as free and easy when I was coming along as it is today because if that had been the case I wouldn&#x27;t have been married. Three women in my life utterly destroyed me.&quot;

In 1979, Ray appeared in a pornographic movie, &quot;Sweet Savage&quot;, in a nonsexual role. Ray said later:
I wanted, I guess, to see what it was all about—a kind of half-assed adventure, you know? It was also a kind of vacation for me in a bad time—a nice location in Arizona—and I picked up a few thousand bucks. After it came out, a few people wagged their fingers at me—&#x27;Oh-ho-ho, you dirty dog&#x27;—but I knew I hadn&#x27;t done anything wrong. They shot all the sex stuff after I&#x27;d flown back to L.A. I won the adult film Oscar for that, by the way, but somebody copped it.
In 1981, Ray told a newspaper that his drinking was &quot;under control&quot; and said, &quot;I think things are going to shoot straight up. I&#x27;m working on a deal now and if the picture is made my worries... are over... If things go the way I anticipate and I stay healthy I think I&#x27;ve got better years ahead of me than behind me.&quot; He said he was open to a return to politics &quot;if my movie career doesn&#x27;t take off like I think it will.&quot; He admitted being unhappy with his career, saying: &quot;I think I should have gotten more good stuff.&quot;

His career decline accelerated in the 1980s, and after being diagnosed with throat cancer in 1989, he accepted virtually any role that came his way to maintain his costly health insurance. He returned to Crockett in 1983.

Though at this stage in his career Ray starred mostly in low-budget and exploitation films, he did appear in occasional higher-profile works. He provided voice-over work as Sullivan for the 1982 animated film &quot;The Secret of NIMH&quot; alongside fellow character actor John Carradine. Ray was originally cast in the role of Gurney Halleck in David Lynch&#x27;s 1984 film &quot;Dune&quot;, as his ex-wife Johanna Ray was the casting director, but was replaced by Patrick Stewart owing to ongoing issues with alcoholism.

During the last stages of his career, Ray made a number of films for Fred Olen Ray. &quot;He&#x27;d give me $1,000 in cash, pay my expenses, and I&#x27;d do a day&#x27;s work&quot;, said Ray. &quot;Somebody showed me one of his cassettes—&#x27;starring Aldo Ray&#x27;—but it was just a one-day job... I needed money at the time, and Fred knew I needed a buck, so I did it. He exploited me, yeah... but I was ripe for it.&quot; He also appeared in two films for Iranian-born filmmaker Amir Shervan, better known for his cult classic &quot;Samurai Cop&quot;.

==Personal life==
Ray was married three times:
*Shirley Green on June 20, 1947. They had one child, a daughter named Claire.
*Jeff Donnell (married 30 September 1954, divorced 1956)
*British actress Johanna Bennet (married March 26, 1960, divorced 1967), who continues to work today under the name Johanna Ray as a respected casting director. They had two sons, Paul and Eric. Johanna Ray, a longtime collaborator with David Lynch, cast her son with Aldo, Eric Da Re, in Lynch&#x27;s &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; series as well as in the movie &quot;Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me.&quot;

==Later life==
In 1986 Ray&#x27;s SAG membership was revoked when it was discovered he was acting in a non-union production, &quot;Lethal Injection&quot;. However, Ray still got his union pension and benefits. His fee at this stage was $5,000 a week. He appeared in two more higher-profile films, Michael Cimino&#x27;s &quot;The Sicilian&quot; (1987) and &quot;Blood Red&quot; (1989), both in supporting roles that emphasized his Italian heritage.

In 1989, he was diagnosed with a malignant tumor in his throat that Ray attributed to excessive smoking and drinking.

His last film, which was filmed in mid 1990, was &quot;Shock &#x27;Em Dead&quot;, in which he appeared with Traci Lords and Troy Donahue. In an interview that same year, he said about his cancer:
I regret that I don&#x27;t have more control of my tongue and thoughts—because I speak too frankly and too honestly, and this world is not meant for frank and honest people. They don&#x27;t mix. Reality is pretty phony... I&#x27;m in great shape—got all my energy and strength back. I had surgery on my neck last March, and after one more session of the chemo—that&#x27;s 50 more hours—the doctors say I&#x27;ll have it all beat... I&#x27;m not scared of dying—it&#x27;s how I die that matters. I&#x27;d rather live one good year than ten more crappy years. And I think I&#x27;ve got some good pictures ahead of me if I can find the right roles. There&#x27;s plenty of good stuff left in me, you know?

==Death==
Ray remained in Crockett, with his mother and family and friends. On 19 February 1991, he was admitted to the Veterans Administration Hospital in Martinez, 40 miles east of San Francisco. He died there of complications from throat cancer and pneumonia on 27 March 1991 at age 64. He was cremated and his ashes were put in an urn and buried in Crockett, with a majority of the residents coming out to pay their respects.

==Legacy==
Author Richard Matheson said that his best-known work, &quot;The Incredible Shrinking Man&quot;, was inspired by a scene in Aldo Ray&#x27;s &quot;Let&#x27;s Do It Again&quot; in which a character puts on someone else&#x27;s hat and it sinks down past his ears; &quot;I thought, what if a man put on his own hat and that happened?&quot; he recounted in an interview for Stephen King&#x27;s nonfiction work &quot;Danse Macabre&quot;. 

Quentin Tarantino says Aldo Ray would have been ideal casting for the character of Butch in &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; (1994) and that the look of Butch in the film (as played by Bruce Willis) was inspired by Ray.

Brad Pitt&#x27;s character in Tarantino&#x27;s 2009 war film &quot;Inglourious Basterds&quot; is a soldier named &quot;Aldo Raine&quot;, in tribute to Ray.

Ray appears as a character in Tarantino&#x27;s 2021 novel &quot;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood&quot;.

The Crockett Museum has a display depicting his life.

A profile in &quot;Movie Morlocks&quot; analysed Ray&#x27;s appeal from the film &quot;Nightfall&quot;:
Nobody smokes a cigarette like Aldo Ray. There&#x27;s no forethought involved. No effort to seduce or impress audiences with an exaggerated pose or gesture. Ray doesn&#x27;t have to pretend to be cool, threatening, bruised, battered or tough. He just is. And I find every unassuming gesture he makes utterly captivating. Aldo Ray has never been considered a great Hollywood actor in the traditional sense but his natural, unaffected performances often seemed to emerge from some unsettled place. You could frequently hear a genuine urgency in the way he delivered his lines and his casual swagger told you he&#x27;d been around the block more than once. Whenever Ray erupted on screen it felt like you were watching a volcano explode and if you didn&#x27;t get out of the way it could easily swallow you up in a heavy flow of golden molten lava. Film historians often like to talk about the sea change that occurred in the 1950s, when actor&#x27;s [&quot;sic&quot;] like Montgomery Clift and Marlon Brando brought a new kind of sincerity to Hollywood. These highly trained method actors changed the way we appreciate and understand acting today and they&#x27;ve rightfully been recognized for their accomplishments. But there were other performers that unconsciously championed a new kind of natural approach to acting. And one of them was Aldo Ray.

<text>&quot;Mood Indigo&quot; is a jazz song with music by Duke Ellington and Barney Bigard and lyrics by Irving Mills.

==Composition==
Although Irving Mills—Jack Mills&#x27;s brother and publishing partner—took credit for the lyrics, Mitchell Parish claimed in a 1987 interview that he had written the lyrics.

The tune was composed for a radio broadcast in October 1930 and was originally titled &quot;Dreamy Blues&quot;. It was &quot;the first tune I ever wrote specially for microphone transmission&quot;, Ellington recalled. &quot;The next day wads of mail came in raving about the new tune, so Irving Mills put a lyric to it.&quot; Renamed &quot;Mood Indigo&quot;, it became a jazz standard.

The main theme was provided by Bigard, who learned it in New Orleans, Louisiana from his clarinet teacher Lorenzo Tio, who called it a &quot;Mexican Blues&quot;. Ellington&#x27;s arrangement was first recorded by his band for Brunswick on October 17, 1930. It was recorded twice more in 1930. These recordings included Arthur Whetsel (trumpet), Tricky Sam Nanton (trombone), Barney Bigard (clarinet), Duke Ellington (piano), Fred Guy (banjo), Wellman Braud (bass), Sonny Greer (drums). Ellington blended muted trumpet, muted trombone, and clarinet.

Ellington took the traditional front-line—trumpet, trombone, and clarinet—and inverted them. He chose Yvonne Luanauze (real name Eve Duke) as the band’s vocalist because her mellow timbre was similar to the sound of a saxophone. At the time of these first three recordings in 1930, the usual voicing of the horns would be clarinet at the top (highest pitch), trumpet in the middle, and the trombone at the bottom (lowest pitch). In &quot;Mood Indigo&quot; Ellington voices the trombone right at the top of the instrument&#x27;s register, and the clarinet at the very lowest. This was unheard of at the time, and also created (in the studio) a so-called &quot;mike-tone&quot;—an effect generated by the overtones of the clarinet and trombone (which was tightly muted as well). The &quot;mike-tone&quot; gives the audio-illusion of the presence of a fourth &quot;voice&quot; or instrument. Ellington used this effect in &quot;(In My) Solitude&quot; (1932), &quot;Dusk&quot; (1940), and many other pieces throughout his career. The Ellington band performed and recorded the song continuously throughout its 50 years, both in its original form and as a vehicle for individual soloists.

In 1975, the 1931 release of &quot;Mood Indigo&quot; by Duke Ellington on Brunswick Records was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

<doc id="1021072" wikidata="Q440898" url="?curid=1021072" title="Gregory Isaacs">
<text>Gregory Anthony Isaacs OD (15 July 1951 – 25 October 2010) was a Jamaican reggae musician. Milo Miles, writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, described Isaacs as &quot;the most exquisite vocalist in reggae&quot;.

==Early career==
In his teenage years, Isaacs became a veteran of the talent contests that regularly took place in Jamaica. In 1968, he made his recording debut as Winston Sinclair, with the single &quot;Another Heartache&quot;, recorded for producer Byron Lee. The single sold poorly and Isaacs went on to team up with Errol Dunkley to start the African Museum record label and shop, and soon had a hit with &quot;My Only Lover&quot;, credited as the first lovers&#x27; rock record ever made. He recorded for other producers to finance further African Museum recordings, having a string of hits in the three years that followed, ranging from ballads to roots reggae, including &quot;All I Have Is Love&quot;, &quot;Lonely Soldier&quot;, &quot;Black a Kill Black&quot;, &quot;Extra Classic&quot; and his cover version of Dobby Dobson&#x27;s &quot;Loving Pauper&quot;. In 1974, he began working with producer Alvin Ranglin, and that year he had his first Jamaican no. 1 single with &quot;Love Is Overdue&quot;.

Isaacs recorded for many of Jamaica&#x27;s top producers during the 1970s, including Winston &quot;Niney&quot; Holness, Gussie Clarke (&quot;My Time&quot;), Lloyd Campbell (&quot;Slavemaster&quot;), Glen Brown (&quot;One One Coco&quot;), Harry Mudie, Roy Cousins, Sydney Crooks and Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry (&quot;Mr. Cop&quot;). By the late-1970s, Isaacs was one of the biggest reggae performers in the world, regularly touring the US and the UK, challenged only by Dennis Brown and Bob Marley. Between 1977 and 1978, Isaacs again teamed up with Alvin Ranglin, recording a string of hits including &quot;Border&quot; and &quot;Number One&quot; for Ranglin&#x27;s GG&#x27;s label.

He opened the Cash and Carry shop at 118 Orange Street, later moving to no. 125, next door to Prince Buster&#x27;s Record Shack, which was also the base for the Cash and Carry record label that he ran with Trevor &quot;Leggo&quot; Douglas.

==International success==
International stardom seemed assured in 1978 when Isaacs signed to the Virgin Records offshoot Front Line Records, and appeared in the film &quot;Rockers&quot;, in which he performed &quot;Slavemaster&quot;. The &quot;Cool Ruler&quot; (which became one of his nicknames) and &quot;Soon Forward&quot; albums, however, failed to sell as well as expected, although they are now considered among his best work. In 1981, he made his first appearance at the Reggae Sunsplash festival (returning annually until 1991), and he moved on to the Charisma Records offshoot Pre, who released his &quot;The Lonely Lover&quot; and &quot;More Gregory&quot; albums along with a string of increasingly successful singles including &quot;Tune In&quot;, &quot;Permanent Lover&quot;, &quot;Wailing Rudie&quot; and &quot;Tribute to Waddy&quot;. He signed to Island Records and released the record that broke through to a wider audience, &quot;Night Nurse&quot;, the title track from his first album for the label (&quot;Night Nurse&quot; (1982)). Although &quot;Night Nurse&quot; was not a chart hit in either the UK or US, it was popular in clubs and received heavy radio play, and the album reached number 32 in the UK. It was also used in adverts for an over the counter cold &amp; flu remedy of the same name.

This success for Isaacs coincided with problems with cocaine. He served a six-month prison sentence in Kingston in 1982 for possession of unlicensed firearms. Isaacs claimed that he had the weapons only for protection, but it emerged that this was his 27th arrest and that he had become involved in drug dealing and was addicted to crack cocaine. He celebrated his release from prison with his second album for Island, &quot;Out Deh!&quot; (1983). Yellowman wrote the song &quot;Gregory Free&quot; also celebrating Isaacs&#x27;s release, and was later featured on the &quot;Young, Gifted and Yellow&quot; album. He was featured in the 1982 documentary &quot;Land of Look Behind&quot;.

When his contract with Island ended, Isaacs returned in 1984 with the &quot;Kool Ruler Come Again&quot; single, and began a period of prolific recording, working with producers including Prince Jammy, Hugh &quot;Redman&quot; James, Bobby Digital, Tad Dawkins and Steely &amp; Clevie, maintaining a consistent standard despite the volume of work produced. Isaacs then built a strong relationship with Gussie Clarke of the Music Works label. They began with Isaacs&#x27;s 1985 album &quot;Private Beach Party&quot;, and had a hit with &quot;Rumours&quot; in 1988, which was followed by further popular singles including &quot;Mind Yu Dis&quot;, &quot;Rough Neck&quot;, &quot;Too Good To Be True&quot; and &quot;Report to Me&quot;. The association with Clarke continued into the early 1990s, teaming up with singers including Freddie McGregor, Ninjaman and J.C. Lodge. He dueted with Beres Hammond on the 1993 Philip &quot;Fatis&quot; Burrell-produced &quot;One Good Turn&quot;, Burrell also producing Isaacs&#x27;s 1994 album &quot;Midnight Confidential&quot;.

In the 1990s, the African Museum label continued to release all of Isaacs&#x27;s music, and that of artists he produced. In 1997 Simply Red covered &quot;Night Nurse&quot;. Isaacs continued to record and perform live in the 2000s. In 2005 Lady Saw produced another version of &quot;Night Nurse&quot; with her toasting over the original lyrics.

Isaacs&#x27;s drug addiction had a major impact on his voice, with most of his teeth falling out as a result. Isaacs said of his addiction in 2007: &quot;Drugs are a debasing weapon. It was the greatest college ever, but the most expensive school fee ever paid – the Cocaine High School. I learnt everything, and now I&#x27;ve put it on the side.&quot;

He performed at the ICC Cricket World Cup 2007 Inauguration at Jamaica, and in 2007 he collaborated with the Spanish rap group Flowklorikos/Rafael Lechowski album &quot;Donde Duele Inspira&quot;.

In 2008, Isaacs released a new studio album, &quot;Brand New Me&quot;, which was nominated for the Grammy Awards for 2010. The album received positive reviews from critics; Reggae Vibes wrote: &quot;Gregory is back, and how! &#x27;Brand New Me&#x27; is a very suitable album title for the cool ruler&#x27;s new album. He is back in a different style, more or less like we were used to from this great &#x27;lovers &amp; roots&#x27; artist&quot;. This was followed in 2009 by the album &quot;My Kind Of Lady&quot;.

In 2010, Isaacs put out the last of his albums to be released while he was still living: &quot;Isaacs Meets Isaac&quot;, with Zimbabwean reggae singer King Isaac. In November 2010, &quot;Isaacs Meets Isaac&quot; was nominated for Best Reggae Album for the 2011 Grammy Awards, Isaacs&#x27;s fourth Grammy nomination, and King Isaac&#x27;s first.

==Death==
Isaacs died of lung cancer on 25 October 2010 at his home in Harrow Weald, London. A memorial service was held on 20 November at Kingston&#x27;s National Indoor Sports Centre, including a musical tribute from artists including Lloyd Parks and We the People Band, Ken Boothe, Freddie McGregor, Shaggy, Judy Mowatt, Mavado, the Tamlins and Bongo Herman, before his remains were interred at Dovecot Memorial Park &amp; Crematorium.

==Legacy==
The Gregory Isaacs Foundation was set up on 15 July 2011 (Isaacs&#x27;s birthday) by his wife June Wyndham, with the intention of continuing his charitable work. A year later a free concert was staged featuring artists such as U-Roy, Big Youth, and the Mighty Diamonds, to raise funds for two schools.

In July 2015, a mural by Junior Moore depicting Isaacs was unveiled at 125 Orange Street, the former site of his Cash and Carry shop and now the Leggo Recording Studios. The unveiling also saw the launch of &quot;Cool Ruler&quot; spring water.

In 2016, the Jamaican government announced that it would posthumously award Isaacs the Order of Distinction (Officer Class) in recognition of his contribution to the country&#x27;s music.

In October 2016 the UK branch of the Gregory Isaacs Foundation installed a commemorative blue plaque at 59 Weald Lane, Harrow, the house where Isaacs lived for the last three years of his life, with his British wife Linda Diane Isaacs (16.01.1948 - 21.06.2023). It was Linda&#x27;s house, her son and grandchildren still live there. In February 2018, a blue plaque was unveiled at Isaacs&#x27;s former home at 15 Sunrise Crescent in St. Andrew, with the foundation also announcing plans to open a museum dedicated to Isaacs at the site.

==History==

IIM Lucknow was established in 1984 and is currently a centrally funded institution. It is the fourth Indian Institute of Management to be established in India (after IIM Calcutta, IIM Ahmedabad, and IIM Bangalore). Noted academic Ishwar Dayal played a significant role in setting up the institution; he served as the founding director of IIM Lucknow for four years. Industrialist Hari Shankar Singhania, who took over as the chairman of Board of Governors in 1992, served until 2007.

The Post Graduate Programme (PGP) was started in 1985–86 with 30 students. When the institute was established, classes were held in rented rooms at Butler Palace and subsequently moved to Giri Institute of Developmental Studies. The current campus was built in 1992 in the outskirts of Lucknow.

Links were made with three foreign universities in 2001 to start the student exchange program. The Agribusiness Course was started in 2004 with 13 students.

In 2005, IIM Lucknow established a second campus at Noida near Delhi. The Noida campus was established exclusively for executive education. Additionally, in 2015, PGP Sustainable Management (PGP-SM) Program was started from the Noida Campus. IIM Lucknow is the first IIM in the country to start an additional campus.

IIM-Lucknow&#x27;s Noida Campus is spread over 20 acres in Sector-62, NOIDA. PGPSM (Sustainable Management) and IPMX courses are main highlight of the campus. 

===Academic infrastructure===

The academic buildings are constructed in medieval Indian architectural style with red brick wall texture. All the major buildings in the campus are named in Sanskrit symbolising the activities conducted in them. The academic blocks (&quot;Bodhigrih-I and II&quot;) houses classrooms and seminar halls. The Faculty block (&quot;Chintan&quot;) houses faculty rooms and Fellowship classrooms. The Library (&quot;Gyanodaya&quot;) spanning 30,000 sq ft has five reading halls with a seating capacity for 250 people. The library houses a collection of 40,000 books, 500 periodicals and online subscription to 1600 e-journals and 34 e-databases. The library building houses the computer centre, audio visual lab, Enterprise Resource Planning lab and a videoconferencing hall.

The Centre for Food and Agribusiness Management undertakes agribusiness research and consultancy projects and offers the Agribusiness Management course. The institute has an incubation centre (&quot;Abhiyan&quot;) for supporting the entrepreneurial plans of its students and alumni.

===Social infrastructure===

Fully residential, the institute provides housing to its students, faculty and research scholars.

While the campus has separate sports fields for football, cricket, basketball, volleyball, tennis, and badminton, most of the hostels have their own table tennis and badminton courts. A fitness and recreation centre (&quot;Umang&quot;) was set up in 2010, which houses a gymnasium, swimming pool, squash, and billiards.

The campus has a student activities complex with two banks, a medical shop, a travel agency, a supermarket, a post office, a saloon, a coffee shop, an ice cream parlour, and three restaurants. A Central school (&quot;Kendriya Vidyalaya&quot;) was established opposite the campus as a community school.

===Environmental responsibility===

Tree plantation campaign is undertaken every year on the foundation day and the campus, which was started in barren lands, has been converted into an ecosystem consisting of peacocks, monitor lizards, snakes, porcupines, monkeys, Great Indian horned owl and other birds. The main campus consists of open lawns and tree lined pathways. Rediff listed IIM Lucknow as one of the beautiful B-school campuses in India.

==Organisation==
===Governance===
IIM Lucknow is an autonomous institution established as a registered society under the Union Ministry of Human Resource Development, Govt. of India. The IIM Council acts as an overseeing body to facilitate coordination among the IIMs.

The Board of Governors of IIM Lucknow is chaired by Natarajan Chandrasekaran, chairman of Tata Sons. The board consists of 10 industrialists, four Government representatives and three academics in addition to the director and two deans of the institution.

===Administration===
The director of IIM Lucknow, the head of the institution, is selected and appointed by the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet of Ministry of Human Resource Development. The institute has three separate deans for academic affairs, planning and development, and Noida campus. Each of the academic programmes is overseen by a faculty chairperson.

The non-academic functions such as Placements, Corporate and Media Relations, Alumni affairs, Admissions and Student affairs are chaired by faculty and assisted by student committees. Office administration is carried out without the involvement of faculty and is headed by the Chief Administrative Officer. The elected body of the students&#x27; council coordinates student activities in the campus.

===Controversy on director appointments===
MHRD issued a letter in September 2014 (DO 4/4/2013-TS.V)) addressed to Jamshed J Irani, chairman, board of governors, IIM-L. It reads: &quot;Competent authority have directed to assign additional charge of director IIM-L to Prof Srivastava for a period of six months with effect from 09-09-2014 or till appointment of regular director or until further order, whichever is earliest.&quot;

The institute did not execute the order and incumbent director Devi Singh who completed his six months of extension period, on 8 September did not leave office even after receiving the letter. As a result, there was confusion at IIM-L campus for almost a week. The allegations against Devi Singh, who served two term as director of IIM-L, ranges from nepotism to mismanagement of accounts. The Central Vigilance Commission also asked the HRD ministry to &#x27;re investigate&#x27; allegations of corruption against Devi Singh.

In a letter to the higher education secretary, CVC secretary KS Ramasubban has asked the ministry as to why the case against Singh is being closed when specific allegations have not been answered. The CVC has taken exception to the fact that the case is being closed on the basis of an &quot;emotional reply&quot; by Singh. CVC sources said the ministry had taken Singh&#x27;s reply as final. &quot;Without investigation how can general comments be taken as the final word?&quot; a CVC official asked. CVC sources also said that the institute&#x27;s Board of Governors had rejected allegations against Singh. &quot;This is not how an investigation is conducted,&quot; the CVC official said, adding that the HRD ministry was to be blamed for not following the procedure.

<doc id="1021088" wikidata="Q510236" url="?curid=1021088" title="Neurasthenia">
<text>Neurasthenia (from the Ancient Greek νεῦρον &quot;neuron&quot; &quot;nerve&quot; and ἀσθενής &quot;asthenés&quot; &quot;weak&quot;) is a term that was first used as early as 1829 for a mechanical weakness of the nerves. It became a major diagnosis in North America during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries after neurologist George Miller Beard reintroduced the concept in 1869.

As a psychopathological term, the first to publish on neurasthenia was Michigan alienist E. H. Van Deusen of the Kalamazoo asylum in 1869. Also in 1868, New York neurologist George Beard used the term in an article published in the Boston Medical and Surgical Journal to denote a condition with symptoms of fatigue, anxiety, headache, heart palpitations, high blood pressure, neuralgia, and depressed mood. Van Deusen associated the condition with farm wives made sick by isolation and a lack of engaging activity; Beard connected the condition to busy society women and overworked businessmen.

Neurasthenia was a diagnosis in the World Health Organization&#x27;s ICD-10, but deprecated, and thus no more diagnosable, in ICD-11. It also is no longer included as a diagnosis in the American Psychiatric Association&#x27;s &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot;. The condition is, however, described in the Chinese Society of Psychiatry&#x27;s Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders.

Americans were said to be particularly prone to neurasthenia, which resulted in the nickname &quot;Americanitis&quot; (popularized by William James). Another (albeit rarely used) term for neurasthenia is nervosism.

==Symptoms==
The condition was explained as being a result of exhaustion of the central nervous system&#x27;s energy reserves, which Beard attributed to modern civilization. Physicians in the Beard school of thought associated neurasthenia with the stresses of urbanization and with stress suffered as a result of the increasingly competitive business environment. Typically, it was associated with upper class people and with professionals working in sedentary occupations, but really can apply to anyone who lives within the monetary system.

Freud included a variety of physical symptoms into this category, including fatigue, dyspepsia with flatulence, and indications of intra-cranial pressure and spinal irritation. In common with some other people of the time, he believed this condition to be due to &quot;non-completed coitus&quot; or the non-completion of the higher cultural correlate thereof, or to &quot;infrequency of emissions&quot; or the infrequent practice of the higher cultural correlate thereof. Later, Freud formulated that in cases of coitus interruptus as well as in cases of masturbation, there was &quot;an insufficient libidinal discharge&quot; that had a poisoning effect on the organism, in other words, neurasthenia was the result of (auto)intoxication. Eventually he separated it from anxiety neurosis, though he believed that a combination of the two conditions existed in many cases.

In 19th-century Britain and, by extension, across the British Empire, neurasthenia was also used to describe mental exhaustion or fatigue in “brain workers” or in the context of “overstudy”. This use was often synonymous with the term “brain fag”.

==Diagnosis==
From 1869, neurasthenia became a &quot;popular&quot; diagnosis, expanding to include such symptoms as weakness, dizziness and fainting. A common treatment promoted by neurologist S. Weir Mitchell was the rest cure, especially for women. Data from this period gleaned from the Annual Reports of Queen Square Hospital, London, indicates that the diagnosis was balanced between the sexes and had a presence within Europe. Virginia Woolf was known to have been forced to have rest cures, which she describes in her book &quot;On Being Ill&quot;. Charlotte Perkins Gilman&#x27;s protagonist in &quot;The Yellow Wallpaper&quot; also suffers under the auspices of rest cure doctors, much as Gilman herself did. Marcel Proust was said to suffer from neurasthenia. To capitalize on this epidemic, the Rexall drug company introduced a medication called &quot;Americanitis Elixir&quot; which claimed to be a soother for any bouts related to neurasthenia.

==Treatment==
Beard, with his partner A.D. Rockwell, advocated first electrotherapy and then increasingly experimental treatments for people with neurasthenia, a position that was controversial. An 1868 review posited that Beard&#x27;s and Rockwell&#x27;s knowledge of the scientific method was suspect and did not believe their claims to be warranted.

William James was diagnosed with neurasthenia, which he nicknamed &quot;Americanitis&quot;, and was quoted as saying, &quot;I take it that no man is educated who has never dallied with the thought of suicide.&quot;

In 1895, Sigmund Freud reviewed electrotherapy and declared it a &quot;pretense treatment&quot;. He emphasized the example of Elizabeth von R&#x27;s note that &quot;the stronger these were the more they seemed to push her own pains into the background.&quot;

Nevertheless, neurasthenia was a common diagnosis during World War I for &quot;shell shock&quot;, but its use declined a decade later. Soldiers who deserted their post could be executed even if they had a medical excuse, but officers who had neurasthenia were not executed.

==Modern diagnosis==
This diagnosis remained popular well into the 20th century, eventually coming to be seen as a mental and behavioural rather than physical condition. Neurasthenia had largely been abandoned as a medical diagnosis by the 21st century, and is deprecated in the ICD-11 classification system of the World Health Organization.

The earlier ICD-10 system categorized neurasthenia under &quot;F48 – Other neurotic disorders&quot;. Under &quot;F48.0 Neurasthenia&quot;, the characteristics of the disorder differ among various cultures. Two overlapping symptoms can be present: Increased fatigue after mental exertion can be associated with a reduction in cognitive function. Minimal physical effort might be felt as extreme fatigue along with pain and anxiety. Many other symptoms of bodily discomfort may be felt with either form. Excluded from this disorder are: asthenia NOS (R53), burn-out (Z73.0), malaise and fatigue (R53), postviral fatigue syndrome (includes myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS)) (G93.3) and psychasthenia (F48.8).

One modern theory of neurasthenia is that it was actually dysautonomia, an &quot;imbalance&quot; of the autonomic nervous system.

Barbara Ehrenreich, restating James&#x27;s view, considered that neurasthenia was caused by the Calvinist gloom, and it was helped by the New Thought, through replacing the &quot;puritanical &#x27;demand for perpetual effort and self-examination to the point of self-loathing&#x27;&quot; with a more hopeful faith.

===In Asia===
The medical term &quot;neurasthenia&quot; is translated as Chinese &quot;shenjing shuairuo&quot; () or Japanese &quot;shinkei-suijaku&quot; (神経衰弱), both of which also translate the common term &quot;nervous breakdown&quot;. This loanword combines &quot;shenjing&quot; () or &quot;shinkei&quot; () &quot;nerve(s); nervous&quot; and &quot;shuairuo&quot; or &quot;suijaku&quot; () &quot;weakness; feebleness; debility; asthenia&quot;.

Despite being removed from the American Psychiatric Association&#x27;s DSM in 1980, neurasthenia is listed in an appendix as the culture-bound syndrome &quot;shenjing shuairuo&quot; as well as appearing in the ICD-10. The condition is thought to persist in Asia as a culturally acceptable diagnosis that avoids the social stigma of a diagnosis of mental disorder.

In China, traditional Chinese medicine describes &quot;shenjingshuairuo&quot; as a depletion of &quot;qi&quot; &quot;vital energy&quot; and reduction of functioning in the &quot;wuzang&quot; &quot;five internal organs&quot; (heart, liver, spleen, lungs, kidneys). The modern CCMD classifies it as a persistent mental disorder diagnosed with three of these five symptoms: &quot;&#x27;weakness&#x27; symptoms, &#x27;emotional&#x27; symptoms, excitement&#x27; symptoms, tension-induced pain, and sleep disturbances&quot; not caused by other conditions. Arthur Kleinman described Chinese neurasthenia as a &quot;biculturally patterned illness experience (a special form of somatization), related to depression or other diseases or to culturally sanctioned idioms of distress and psychosocial coping.&quot;

In Japan, &quot;shinkei-suijaku&quot; is treated with Morita therapy involving mandatory rest and isolation, followed by progressively more difficult work, and a resumption of a previous social role. The diagnosis is sometimes used to disguise serious mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and mood disorders.

<text>Elizabeth Margaret Ellis, (born 17 January 1973) is a retired Australian netball player and television presenter who was a member of the national netball team from 1992 until 2007 and captain for the last four of those years. She is the most capped international player for Australian netball. Liz Ellis was inducted to the Victorian Honour Roll of Women in 2006.

==Early life and education==
Ellis was born in Windsor, New South Wales, on 17 January 1973. After attending Holy Family High School and finishing the last two years of secondary education at John Paul II Senior High School (now known as St Andrew&#x27;s College), Ellis attended the Australian Institute of Sport on a netball scholarship. She also completed a law degree at Macquarie University while she worked her way up the ranks of Australian netball.

==Netball career==
After attending the AIS in 1991–1992, Ellis made her debut for the Australian Netball Team in July 1993 against Wales. It was the 1995 World Championships in Birmingham where she stamped her mark on the international netball scene with a sterling performance in the grand final against South Africa. She went on to be a mainstay of the Australian Netball Team, participating in the 1995, 1999, 2003 and 2007 World Championships and the 2002 and 2006 Commonwealth Games. She was named Vice-Captain of the team in 2000 and Captain in 2004 and broke the record for the highest number of tests played for Australia in 2005. She was named Australian Netball&#x27;s Most Valued Player on four occasions – 1996, 1998, 2002 and 2006.

Ellis became the captain of the Sydney Swifts in 2000. She was the captain for their team in 2001, 2004, 2006 and 2007 Commonwealth Bank Trophy premierships. She played her entire domestic career for the Swifts and holds the record for the most games played in the Commonwealth Bank Trophy (173). In October 2005, Ellis suffered a career-threatening knee injury in a match against New Zealand in Auckland. She defied the critics by making a full recovery from a full knee reconstruction and producing some of the best netball of her career in the two years that followed. Ellis announced her retirement from netball on 19 November 2007, two days after leading Australia to a World Championship victory over New Zealand.

== Television career ==
Since her retirement, Ellis has been a netball commentator, working initially for Fox Sports and Network Ten during their coverage of the ANZ Championship and Australian Diamonds test matches. She moved to the Nine Network when it picked up the rights to the Suncorp Super Netball league, and became a regular panellist on the network&#x27;s weekly Sports Sunday program.

In 2023, Ellis appeared as a contestant in the ninth season of the Australian edition of &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;, which she won. She also began appearing regularly on Network 10&#x27;s &quot;The Project&quot; as a panelist in 2023.

In October 2023, Network 10 announced at their 2024 upfronts that Ellis was set to host a revival of the sports entertainment competition show &quot;Gladiators Australia&quot; in 2024, alongside Beau Ryan. The show officially premiered on 15 January 2024.

==Personal life==
Ellis met former businessman Matthew Stocks in 1992. They became engaged in 2000 and married in 2006.

On 31 March 2011, Ellis announced that she was pregnant. On 28 September 2011, she gave birth to her first child, a daughter, at Sydney&#x27;s Royal Prince Alfred Hospital.

On 21 October 2015, Ellis announced on &quot;The Project&quot; that after several rounds of IVF and three miscarriages, she was pregnant with her second child. A son was born 4 April 2016.

Ellis wrote a book in 2018 titled &quot;If at First You Don&#x27;t Conceive&quot;, detailing her experiences with her troubles having children.

In August 2022 she appeared in Season 13 of &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot;, revealing connections to Condobolin, and a convict ancestor. 

In May 2024, Ellis was appointed Chair of the Netball Australia Board.

==Recognition==
In the 2018 Australia Day Honours, Ellis became an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) for &quot;distinguished service to netball as an elite player and coach, through support and advocacy for young women, as a contributor to the broadcast and print media industries, and to the community&quot;. In recognition of her outstanding career, since 2008 the highest individual accolade awarded to an Australian netball athlete has been the annual Liz Ellis Diamond.

In 2019, she was inducted into Hall of Fame at Australian Women&#x27;s Health Sport Awards.

In 2020, a river-class ferry on the Sydney Ferries network was named in her honour.

<doc id="1021097" wikidata="Q4794320" url="?curid=1021097" title="Army of Occupation Medal">
<text>The Army of Occupation Medal was a military award of the United States military which was established by the United States War Department on 5 April 1946. The medal was created in the aftermath of the Second World War to recognize those who had performed occupation service in either Germany, Italy, Austria, Japan or Korea. The original Army of Occupation Medal was intended only for members of the United States Army, but was expanded in 1948 to encompass the United States Air Force shortly after that service&#x27;s creation. The Navy and Marine equivalent of the Army of Occupation Medal is the Navy Occupation Service Medal, which features the same ribbon with its own medallion and clasps.

==History==
Although authorized in 1946, it was not until 1947 that the first Army of Occupation Medals were distributed. The first medal was presented to General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower, who had been the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force Commander during World War II. 

Because of the legal status of West Berlin as an occupied territory, the Army of Occupation Medal was issued for forty-five years until the unification of Germany in 1990, making it one of the longest active military awards of both the Second World War and the Cold War. 

In addition, some recipients of the award were born two generations after the end of the conflict which the medal was designed to represent. Much like the National Defense Service Medal, the Army of Occupation Medal has come to be considered a &quot;multi-generational&quot; award.

Although 30 days in West Berlin was a requirement for issuing the award, it was not unusual for supply sergeants to issue it along with other unit insignia and equipment. If the soldier questioned it, he would be told &quot;You aren&#x27;t going anywhere for 30 days! Just wait to put it on your uniform.&quot;

==Criteria==

To be awarded the Army of Occupation Medal, a service member was required to have performed at least thirty consecutive days of military duty within a designated geographical area of military occupation. The Army of Occupation Medal was presented with a campaign clasp, denoting either European or Asian service, depending on the region in which occupation service had been performed. Campaign clasps were worn on the full-sized medal only with no corresponding device when wearing the Army of Occupation Medal as a ribbon on a military uniform. 

In addition to the Germany clasp, for those service members who performed 92 consecutive days of military duty during the Berlin Airlift in 1948 and 1949, the Berlin Airlift Device is authorized as a device to the Army of Occupation Medal. (If further eligible, persons could also be awarded the Medal for Humane Action.)

===Germany clasp===
* Germany (9 May 1945 to 5 May 1955)
* Austria (9 May 1945 to 27 July 1955)
* Italy (9 May 1945 to 15 September 1947)
* West Berlin (9 May 1945 to 2 October 1990)

===Japan clasp===
* Japan (3 September 1945 to 27 April 1952)
* Korea (3 September 1945 to 29 June 1949)

==Appearance==

The medal is bronze measuring 1.25 inches across. On the obverse, are the abutments of the Remagen Bridge with the words &quot;ARMY OF OCCUPATION&quot; inscribed above. On the reverse, is Mount Fuji with a low-hanging cloud over two Japanese junks above a wave and the inscribed date &quot;1945&quot;. A bronze clasp 0.125 inches wide and 1.5 inches in length with the word &quot;GERMANY&quot; or &quot;JAPAN&quot; is worn on the suspension ribbon of the medal to indicate service in Europe or the Far East. The ribbon is 1.375 inches wide with two thin white stripes at the edges and two thicker stripes in the middle, the first being black and the second in scarlet. A myth was that if a soldier served in Germany the ribbon&#x27;s black band was worn to his right and if in Japan the red was to his right. The only approved display was for the black band to be to the wearer&#x27;s right.

<doc id="1021099" wikidata="Q455204" url="?curid=1021099" title="Hodrick–Prescott filter">
<text>The Hodrick–Prescott filter (also known as Hodrick–Prescott decomposition) is a mathematical tool used in macroeconomics, especially in real business cycle theory, to remove the cyclical component of a time series from raw data. It is used to obtain a smoothed-curve representation of a time series, one that is more sensitive to long-term than to short-term fluctuations. The adjustment of the sensitivity of the trend to short-term fluctuations is achieved by modifying a multiplier formula_1. 

The filter was popularized in the field of economics in the 1990s by economists Robert J. Hodrick and Nobel Memorial Prize winner Edward C. Prescott, though it was first proposed much earlier by E. T. Whittaker in 1923., see Whittaker-Henderson smoothing. The Hodrick-Prescott filter is a special case of a smoothing spline.

==The equation==

The reasoning for the methodology uses ideas related to the decomposition of time series. Let formula_2 for formula_3 denote the logarithms of a time series variable. The series formula_2 is made up of a trend component formula_5 and a cyclical component formula_6 such that formula_7. Given an adequately chosen, positive value of formula_1, there is a trend component that will solve

:formula_9

The first term of the equation is the sum of the squared deviations formula_10, which penalizes the cyclical component. The second term is a multiple formula_1 of the sum of the squares of the trend component&#x27;s second differences. This second term penalizes variations in the growth rate of the trend component. The larger the value of formula_1, the higher is the penalty. Hodrick and Prescott suggest 1600 as a value for formula_1 for quarterly data. Ravn and Uhlig (2002) state that formula_1 should vary by the fourth power of the frequency observation ratio; thus, formula_1 should equal 6.25 (1600/4^4) for annual data and 129,600 (1600*3^4) for monthly data;
in practice, formula_16 for yearly data and formula_17 for monthly data are commonly used, however.

The Hodrick–Prescott filter is explicitly given by

:formula_18

where formula_19 denotes the lag operator, as can be seen from the first-order condition for the minimization problem.

==Drawbacks to the Hodrick–Prescott filter==

The Hodrick–Prescott filter will only be optimal when:
*Data exists in a I(2) trend.
**If one-time permanent shocks or split growth rates occur, the filter will generate shifts in the trend that do not actually exist.
*Noise in data is approximately normally distributed.
*Analysis is purely historical and static (closed domain). The filter causes misleading predictions when used dynamically since the algorithm changes (during iteration for minimization) the past state (unlike a moving average) of the time series to adjust for the current state regardless of the size of formula_1 used.

The standard two-sided Hodrick–Prescott filter is non-causal as it is not purely backward looking. Hence, it should not be used when estimating DSGE models based on recursive state-space representations (e.g., likelihood-based methods that make use of the Kalman filter). The reason is that the Hodrick–Prescott filter uses observations at formula_21 to construct the current time point formula_22, while the recursive setting assumes that only current and past states influence the current observation. One way around this is to use the one-sided Hodrick–Prescott filter.

Exact algebraic formulas are available for the two-sided Hodrick–Prescott filter in terms of its signal-to-noise ratio formula_1.

A working paper by James D. Hamilton at UC San Diego titled &quot;Why You Should Never Use the Hodrick-Prescott Filter&quot; presents evidence against using the HP filter. Hamilton writes that:

# The HP filter produces series with spurious dynamic relations that have no basis in the underlying data-generating process.
# A one-sided version of the filter reduces but does not eliminate spurious predictability and moreover produces series that do not have the properties sought by most potential users of the HP filter.
# A statistical formalization of the problem typically produces values for the smoothing parameter vastly at odds with common practice, e.g., a value for λ far below 1600 for quarterly data.
# There&#x27;s a better alternative. A regression of the variable at date t+h on the four most recent values as of date t offers a robust approach to detrending that achieves all the objectives sought by users of the HP filter with none of its drawbacks.&quot;

A working paper by Robert J. Hodrick titled &quot;An Exploration of Trend-Cycle Decomposition Methodologies in Simulated Data&quot; examines whether the proposed alternative approach of James D. Hamilton is actually better than the HP filter at extracting the cyclical component of several simulated time series calibrated to approximate U.S. real GDP. Hodrick finds that for time series in which there are distinct growth and cyclical components, the HP filter comes closer to isolating the cyclical component than the Hamilton alternative.

<text>James Morrow (born March 17, 1947) is an American novelist and short-story writer known for filtering large philosophical and theological questions through his satiric sensibility.

Most of Morrow&#x27;s oeuvre has been published as science fiction and fantasy, but he is also the author of two unconventional historical novels, &quot;The Last Witchfinder&quot; and &quot;Galápagos Regained&quot;. He variously describes himself as a &quot;scientific humanist,&quot; a &quot;bewildered pilgrim,&quot; and a &quot;child of the Enlightenment&quot;.

Morrow presently lives in Huntingdon, Pennsylvania with his second wife, Kathryn Smith Morrow, and their three dogs.

==Early life and education==

James Kenneth Morrow was born in Germantown, Philadelphia, on March 17, 1947, the only child of Emily Morrow, née Develin, and William Morrow (no relation to the publisher of the same name). During World War II, the U.S. Army exempted Bill Morrow from the draft owing to his employment by the Midvale Steel Works.

After the war, Emily and William bought a small house in the Philadelphia suburb of Roslyn, Pennsylvania, a choice driven largely by the sterling reputation of Abington Township&#x27;s public-school system. James Morrow attributes his fiction-writing career directly to the humanities curriculum at Abington Senior High School. In particular, his exposure to James Giordano&#x27;s tenth-grade World Literature class prompted him to imagine himself one day composing novels and stories inspired by the philosophically inclined authors in the syllabus, among them Dante, Voltaire, Dostoyevsky, Kafka, Camus, and Ibsen.

Throughout his adolescence Morrow produced a series of 8 mm genre films with his friends at Abington High School, including Joe Adamson, who ultimately made documentary films in Los Angeles; David E. Stone, who became a Hollywood sound editor; and George Shelps, who remained in the Philadelphia area and became a suburban planner. The output of &quot;Abington-International Movie Company&quot; encompassed adaptations of Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s &quot;The Tell-Tale Heart&quot;, August Derleth and Mark Schorer&#x27;s &quot;The Return of Andrew Bentley&quot;, and Samuel Taylor Coleridge&#x27;s &quot;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot;, which received an Honorable Mention in the 1964 &quot;Kodak Movie News&quot; Teen-Age Movie Contest.

While an undergraduate at the University of Pennsylvania, Morrow met his living expenses by working as a filmmaker for the Philadelphia Public Schools, shooting and editing a series of 16 mm films documenting and celebrating the innovations for which the system was famous in the late 1960s.

Upon receiving his BA degree from Penn in 1969, Morrow moved to Somerville, Massachusetts, so he could attend the Harvard Graduate School of Education (HGSE).

==Pre-fiction career==
After receiving an MAT from Harvard in 1970, Morrow found work in the Boston area as an instructional media specialist and graphic artist, first in the Newton Public Schools (1971–1973) and then in the Chelmsford Public Schools (1973–1978). Among the curriculum materials he produced during these years were &quot;Moviemaking Illustrated: The Comicbook Filmbook&quot; (Hayden Book Company, 1973, coauthored with Murray Suid), and &quot;Media and Kids: Real World Learning in the Schools&quot; (Hayden Book Company, 1977, also coauthored with Murray Suid).

From 1972 to 1973, Morrow reunited with high-school filmmaking friends Adamson and Stone to create a 16 mm satiric short called &quot;A Political Cartoon&quot;, which tells of a cartoon character who gets elected President of the United States. This 22-minute film was distributed by The Creative Film Society and exhibited at the Orson Welles Cinema in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1974, and would be released on VHS by Kino Video as a part of &quot;Cartoongate!&quot; (1996), a compilation reel of animated shorts.

In 1972 Morrow married Jean Pierce, a fellow HGSE graduate. They had two children, Kathleen and Christopher. The couple separated in 1995. Morrow married Kathryn Smith—a bookseller, freelance editor, independent scholar, and occasional critic—in 1996.

During the 1980s, Morrow worked as one of the principal writers for the biannual periodical, &quot;A Teacher&#x27;s Guide to NOVA&quot; (WGBH Educational Foundation). He also became a regular contributor to &quot;TV Guide&quot; magazine, writing such commentaries as &quot;TV Didn&#x27;t Turn Us into Lemmings and Vikings&quot; (October 9, 1982), &quot;Big Brother Isn&#x27;t Watching—Yet&quot; (January 28, 1984), &quot;We Need a Nightly News Show on the Nuclear Arms Race&quot; (March 8, 1986), and &quot;The Best Way to Watch TV? Noisily and Together&quot; (April 11, 1987).

In 1977, TSR published James Morrow&#x27;s murder-mystery board game, &quot;Suspicion&quot;, which he was inspired to create after seeing the 1974 movie adaptation of &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot;. Six years later, Morrow was hired by Circuits and Systems, a New Hampshire firm, to design the graphics and help shape the script for &quot;Fortune Builder&quot; (1984), a ColecoVision game sometimes regarded as a forerunner to &quot;SimCity&quot;.

==Fiction career==
With the publication of his first novel, &quot;The Wine of Violence&quot;, in 1981, James Morrow embarked on a full-time career as a writer of comedic but philosophically informed fiction, thus fulfilling the pact he&#x27;d made with his tenth-grade self to participate in the universe of ideas opened up to him by James Giordano&#x27;s World Literature class.

Over the course of the next thirty-four years, Morrow produced ten novels, three stand-alone novellas, and several dozen short stories, many of them satirizing conventional Christian arguments about the workings of the universe. Beyond his fascination with religious questions, Morrow&#x27;s characteristic themes include the folly of war, the necessity of feminism, and the parent-child bond. Ever since high school, his worldview has been essentially secular and atheistic.

On the whole, Morrow&#x27;s work has been favorably received by critics, both within the science-fiction community and the mainstream literary world. &quot;The Last Witchfinder&quot; (2006) was praised by both &quot;New York Times&quot; reviewer Janet Maslin and &quot;Washington Post Book World&quot; editor Ron Charles.

Early in 2010, on the strength of the Russian translations of his novel &quot;Only Begotten Daughter&quot; (1990) and collection &quot;Bible Stories for Adults&quot; (1996), Morrow was invited to participate in the Fifteenth International Tolstoy Conference. After spending a week in Moscow, he and Kathryn traveled to Tolstoy&#x27;s estate, where the author delivered a paper titled, &quot;Charles Darwin Comes to Yasnaya Polyana,&quot; a scholarly thought-experiment spun from Morrow&#x27;s &quot;Galápagos Regained&quot;, his novel (then in progress) about the coming of the Darwinian worldview.

Around the time of the Tolstoy Conference, Morrow&#x27;s dark theological comedy &quot;Blameless in Abaddon&quot; (1996) came to the attention of Bernard Schweizer, a professor at Long Island University, Brooklyn, who invited the novelist to join him and NYU&#x27;s Gregory T. Erickson in establishing an organization dedicated to celebrating the heretical, blasphemous, and religiously unorthodox dimensions of literature and art. On May 3, 2013, the International Society for Heresy Studies was inaugurated at the Torch Club of New York University. Beyond Schweizer, Erickson, and Morrow, the founders included philosopher and novelist Rebecca Newberger Goldstein and literary critic and novelist James Wood.

===Novels===
Morrow&#x27;s first two novels were overtly science-fictional in substance and tone. &quot;The Wine of Violence&quot; (Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1981) tells of a pacifist utopia whose citizens sublimate their aggressive urges through autobiographical video fantasies. &quot;The Continent of Lies&quot; (Holt, Rinehart and Winston 1984) posits a futuristic entertainment medium called &quot;dreambeans&quot; or &quot;cephapples&quot;: genetically engineered fruits that plunge consumers into scripted hallucinations.

The author next attempted a more immediate, political, and experimental narrative. Although &quot;This Is the Way the World Ends&quot; (Henry Holt, 1986) was marketed initially as a mainstream novel, the science-fiction community embraced it, giving Morrow his first Nebula Award nomination. The plot is driven by &quot;The Unadmitted,&quot; a ghostly race of potential humans who never got to be born, due to nuclear holocaust. Determined to use their earthly tenures wisely, the unadmitted put the surviving architects of Armageddon—including the novel&#x27;s everyman protagonist—on trial under the Nuremberg precedent.

&quot;Only Begotten Daughter&quot; (William Morrow 1990) represented the author&#x27;s initial exploration of the subject that would preoccupy him during his mature writing years: the enigma of religious faith. The protagonist is Julie Katz, whose existential problems include the fact that she is Jesus Christ&#x27;s divine half-sister, reincarnated in contemporary Atlantic City.

In &quot;The Last Witchfinder&quot; (William Morrow, 2006) the author dramatized the birth of the scientific worldview. Though much of the novel plays like straightforward, albeit comic, historical fiction, the author employs a peculiar postmodern conceit: the story is told by a sentient book, Isaac Newton&#x27;s &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot;. The narrative turns on Jennet Stearne, who makes it her life&#x27;s mission to bring down the Witchcraft Act 1603.

Morrow wrote his ninth full-length novel, an homage to Mary Shelley&#x27;s &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, under the title &quot;Prometheus Wept&quot;. The protagonist, Mason Ambrose, is a failed philosophy student hired to implant a moral compass in a mysterious young woman, Londa Sabacthani, whose conscience is a blank slate. The book was ultimately published as &quot;The Philosopher&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; (William Morrow, 2008).

Much as &quot;The Last Witchfinder&quot; celebrates the coming of the Enlightenment, Morrow&#x27;s tenth novel, &quot;Galápagos Regained&quot; (St. Martin&#x27;s Press, 2015), rejoices in the advent of evolutionary thought. The heroine is Charles Darwin&#x27;s zookeeper, the fictional Chloe Bathurst, who will stop at nothing to win the Great God Contest: £10,000 to the first person who can prove, or disprove, the existence of God.

===The Godhead Trilogy===
In the 1990s Morrow devoted most of his writing energy to an ambitious project spun from the premise that God has died, leaving behind a two-mile-long corpse. While each book in the Godhead Trilogy features a different protagonist and an independent plot, certain characters and motifs recur throughout the cycle, as does the Corpus Dei.

In &quot;Towing Jehovah&quot; (Harcourt Brace, 1994) a disgraced supertanker captain, Anthony Van Horne, is commissioned by the angel Raphael to tow the divine cadaver to its final resting place in the Arctic. As the voyage progresses, atheists and believers alike take pains to keep God&#x27;s death a secret.

&quot;Blameless in Abaddon&quot; (Harcourt Brace, 1996), a modern-dress version of the Book of Job, turns on the plight of Martin Candle, a small-town, small-time magistrate who, sorely afflicted with cancer, resolves to drag God before the World Court and prosecute him for his seeming indifference to human suffering. A character modeled on C.S. Lewis agrees to finance the elaborate proceeding, but only if he gets to make the case for the defense.

&quot;The Eternal Footman&quot; (Harcourt Brace, 1999) begins with the last remnant of the Corpus Dei, God&#x27;s immense skull, going into geosynchronous orbit above Times Square. This second moon causes a &quot;plague of death awareness&quot; to descend on humankind. Among the victims is a boy whose resourceful mother, Nora Burkhart, undertakes an odyssey from New England to Mexico in an effort to deliver the stricken child from his apparent fate.

===Notable shorter fiction===
Morrow&#x27;s oeuvre includes three stand-alone science-fiction novellas, each reflecting the author&#x27;s penchant for mixing dire situations with acerbic and absurdist humor.

&quot;City of Truth&quot; (Random Century Group, UK, 1990) occurs in the world of Veritas, a dystopia of mandatory candor. To save his mortally ill son, the protagonist, Jack Sperry, must somehow transcend his Skinnerian conditioning and learn to tell lies.

Set in the final days of World War Two, &quot;Shambling Towards Hiroshima&quot; (Tachyon, 2009) describes the U.S. Navy&#x27;s attempt to leverage a Japanese surrender via a &quot;biological weapon&quot; that anticipates Godzilla.

An homage to early 1950s live television, &quot;The Madonna and the Starship&quot; (Tachyon, 2014) tells of a New York pulp writer who must convince two hyper-rationalist aliens that a weekly religious program is satiric in intent, for otherwise the invaders will annihilate its audience of two million devout viewers.

Among his better known stories collected in &quot;Bible Stories for Adults&quot; (Harcourt Brace, 1996) are &quot;Spelling God with the Wrong Blocks&quot; (featuring Darwin-worshiping robots who believe they evolved pursuant to evolutionary principles), &quot;Daughter Earth&quot; (in which a Pennsylvania farmer&#x27;s wife gives birth to a small planet), and &quot;Arms and the Woman&quot; (in which a canny Helen of Troy attempts to end &quot;the war to make the world safe for war&quot;).

The author&#x27;s second collection, &quot;The Cat&#x27;s Pajamas and Other Stories&quot; (Tachyon, 2004) included &quot;Auspicious Eggs&quot; (set in a dystopian Boston where anti-abortion sentiment now encompasses &quot;the rights of the unconceived&quot;), &quot;Martyrs of the Upshot Knothole&quot; (dramatizing the possible connection between John Wayne&#x27;s cancer and atomic-bomb tests), and &quot;The Zombies of Montrose&quot; (an entry in the author&#x27;s cycle of one-act plays).

A humorous political satire of the German Expressionistic classic silent film, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, &quot;The Asylum of Dr. Caligari&quot; (Tachyon, 2017) follows a young painter, Francis Wyndham, and Ilona Wessels, a brilliant, semi-insane inmate, who conspire to thwart infamous asylum director Dr. Alessandro Caligari&#x27;s evil moneymaking scheme (making and then selling the use of a sorcerous painting to incite soldiers into battlelust). Morrow&#x27;s version of Caligari is a timely, acerbic meditation on the volatile interaction of commerce and politics, and how it can lead to dangerously dramatic scenarios on the world stage.

===Anthologies and lesson plans===
Several years after Morrow won a Nebula Award for Best Short Story, the Science Fiction Writers of America assigned him to edit three anthologies: &quot;Nebula Awards 26&quot; (Harcourt Brace 1992), &quot;Nebula Awards 27&quot; (Harcourt Brace 1993), and &quot;Nebula Awards 28&quot; (Harcourt Brace, 1994).

Throughout the first decade of the twenty-first century, James and Kathryn Morrow were regular guests at Utopiales, a literary festival held annually in Nantes. One outcome of their interaction with the international SF community was &quot;The SFWA European Hall of Fame&quot; (Tor Books, 2007), an anthology of sixteen stories carefully translated into English from thirteen Continental languages, each such rendering the result of a three-way internet conversation among the author, the translator, and the Morrows.

With the release of Peter Jackson&#x27;s movie adaptations of J.R.R. Tolkien&#x27;s fantasy novel &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, Houghton Mifflin hired both James Morrow (on the strength of his published instructional materials) and Kathryn Morrow (given her extensive knowledge of Tolkien&#x27;s oeuvre) to write a book-length curriculum for middle-school and high-school teachers wishing to bring &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; into their classrooms. The resulting resource, &quot;Tolkien&#x27;s Middle Earth: Lesson Plans for Secondary School Educators&quot; (Houghton Mifflin, 2006), was posted on the publisher&#x27;s website.

<doc id="1021118" wikidata="Q5437035" url="?curid=1021118" title="Fast fracture">
<text>In structural engineering and material science, fast fracture is a phenomenon in which a flaw (such as a crack) in a material expands quickly, and leads to catastrophic failure of the material. It proceeds in high speed and requires a relatively small amount of accumulated strain energy, making it a dangerous failure mode.

== Flaw ==
Stress acting on a material when fast fracture occurs is less than the material&#x27;s yield stress. A very representative example of this is what happens when poking a blown up balloon with a needle, that is, fast fracture of the balloon&#x27;s material. The energy in the balloon comes from the compressed gas inside it and the energy stored in the rubber membrane itself. The introduction of the flaw, which in this case is the pin prick, would lead to the explosion as the membrane fails by fast fracture. However, if the same flaw is introduced to a balloon with less energy - as in the case of a partially inflated balloon - the fast fracture will not occur, unless the balloon is punctured progressively so that it reaches a critical pressure at which fast fracture occurs.

The occurrence of fast fracture can depend on the material. For instance, it transpires in the cases of brittle materials with less capacity for deformation even if the flaw only involves small defects caused by the manufacturing process.

<doc id="1021123" wikidata="Q5507307" url="?curid=1021123" title="Fuguing tune">
<text>The fuguing tune (often spelled fuging tune) is a variety of Anglo-American vernacular choral music. Fuguing tunes form a significant number of the songs found in the American Sacred Harp singing tradition. They first flourished in the mid-18th century and continue to be composed today.

==Description==

Fuguing tunes are sacred music, specifically, Protestant hymns. They are written for a four-part chorus singing &quot;a cappella&quot;. George Pullen Jackson has described the fuguing tune as follows:

A well-known fuguing tune that is typical of the form is &quot;Northfield&quot;, written in 1800 by Jeremiah Ingalls. The text is by Isaac Watts:

==Variety in fuguing tunes==

George Pullen Jackson&#x27;s description above gives a common form for a fuguing tune, but there are variations. Jackson describes the entrance order of the four parts as &quot;bottom to top&quot; (Bass-Tenor-Alto-Treble), but this is not the only possible order. Indeed, in the fuguing tunes printed in &quot;The Sacred Harp, 1991 edition&quot;, it is not even the most common one; the most common order is Bass-Tenor-Treble-Alto. There are many other orders possible, particularly if one includes the many cases in which composers bring in two parts at once (so that there are just three instead of four entrances). However, it does seem to be a widely valid rule that the basses must at least be included in the first group to enter. This may reflect a wish to support the entrances with a solid bass line, or perhaps just a practical consideration: thanks to the weight of existing tradition, the bass singers have considerable practice in coming in alone at the beginning of a musical phrase, practice which the other sections lack. Thus a fuguing tune with a bass-first structure is likely to be more stable in performance.

==History==

The fuguing tune arose in England in the middle of the 18th century. The first fuguing tunes were the work of itinerant singing masters, described by Irving Lowens as follows:

[The singing masters were] often ill-trained by orthodox standards ... [They] wandered from village to village and eked out an existence by teaching the intricacies of psalm-singing and the rudiments of music to all who cared to learn. To supplement his generally meager income, [the singing master] frequently sold self-compiled tune-books in which psalm tunes of his own composition ... were featured as examples of his skill and artistry.

According to Lowens, the fuguing tunes created by these singing masters at first involved a separate fuguing section appended to the end of a complete psalm tune. Later, the fuguing became more integrated and eventually evolved to be the longer part of the song.

There is good evidence that by 1760, English tune books including fuguing tunes were circulating in the American colonies; the first English fuguing tune printed in America appeared in the hymnbook &quot;Urania, or A Choice Collection of Psalm-Tunes, Anthems, and Hymns&quot; by James Lyon. Soon, fuguing tunes were being written in great profusion by American—especially New England—composers. Karl Kroeger (see reference below) has documented the publication of almost 1300 fuguing tunes during the period 1750–1820. Among the principal composers of New England fuguing tunes (&quot;Yankee tunesmiths&quot;) Irving Lowens lists the following: William Billings, Daniel Read, Jacob French, Timothy Swan, Stephen Jenks, Supply Belcher, Abraham Maxim, Lewis Edson, Joseph Stone, Elisha West, Justin Morgan, and Daniel Belknap.

==Fuguing tunes and fugues==

The similarity of the terms &quot;fugue&quot; and &quot;fuguing tune&quot; means that the two forms are easily confused. A fuguing tune certainly is not some kind of failed attempt to write a fugue, as an ill-informed musicologist once asserted. This is plain from the different structures of the two genres: in a fugue, the voices take turns coming in at the very beginning of the piece, whereas in a fuguing tune that moment comes about a third of the way through. Moreover, in a fugue the musical material used at each entrance (the so-called &quot;subject&quot;) is repeated many times throughout the piece, whereas in a fuguing tune it normally appears just in the one location of sequenced entries, and the rest of the work is somewhat more homophonic in texture.

Indeed, &quot;fuguing&quot; does not derive &quot;from&quot; &quot;fugue&quot;. Rather, as Irving Lowens points out, both terms hark back to a still earlier, more general usage (ultimately from Latin &quot;fugere&quot; &quot;to flee&quot;). He cites the words of Thomas Morley, who wrote (in 1597 in his &quot;Plaine and Easie Introduction to Practicall Musicke&quot;), &quot;We call that a Fuge, when one part beginneth and the other singeth the same, for some number of Notes (which the first did sing).&quot; In modern musical terminology, this is called a &quot;canon&quot;, though Lowens interprets the passage more loosely, explaining that &quot;fuging is pretty well synonymous with what we today call the technique of imitative writing&quot;.

<doc id="1021125" wikidata="Q2416242" url="?curid=1021125" title="Lubyanka Square">
<text>Lubyanskaya Square (, Lubyanskaya ploshchad&#x27;), or simply Lubyanka in Moscow lies about north-east of Red Square. History first records its name in 1480, when Grand Prince Ivan III of Moscow, who had conquered Novgorod in 1471, settled many Novgorodians in the area. They built the church of St Sophia, modelled after St Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod, and called the area &quot;Lubyanka&quot; after the Lubyanitsa street of their native city.

== Name ==
The square was renamed Dzerzhinsky Square for many years (1926–1990) in honor of the founder of the Soviet security service Felix Dzerzhinsky.

== Square center ==
A fountain used to stand in front of the building, at the center of the Lubyanka Square. In 1958, the fountain at the center of the Lubyanka Square was replaced by an 11-ton statue of Felix Dzerzhinsky (&quot;Iron Felix&quot;), founder of the Cheka, made by Yevgeny Vuchetich.
In 2014, Jacques von Polier designed the Raketa Monumental which is largest watch mechanism in the world. It is currently installed at the square.

On October 30, 1990, the Memorial organization erected the Solovetsky Stone, a monument to the victims of the Gulag, a simple stone from the Solovki prison camp in the White Sea. In 1991 the statue of Dzerzhinsky was removed by liberal protesters following the failure of the coup attempt against Mikhail Gorbachev, and the square&#x27;s original name was officially restored.

== Lubyanka Building ==
Lubyanka Square is best known for the monumental Lubyanka Building, designed by and constructed from 1897 to 1898. Originally built for the insurance company &quot;Rossiya&quot;, it later became better known for housing the headquarters of the KGB in its various incarnations. the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB) occupies the building.

== Detsky Mir ==
Opposite the FSB building stands the massive Central Children&#x27;s Store, known by its historical name of Detsky Mir (, &quot;Children World&quot;), Europe&#x27;s largest children&#x27;s store, built between 1953 and 1957, and fully restored in 2014. It hosts in its main atrium the world&#x27;s largest mechanical clock movement: Raketa Monumental.

== Metro ==
The Moscow Metro station Lubyanka operates under Lubyanka Square.

<text>The University of Sydney Library is the library system of the University of Sydney. It comprises eight locations across several campuses of the university. Its largest library, Fisher Library, is named after Thomas Fisher, an early benefactor.

Among the collection are many rare items such as one of the two extant copies of the &quot;Gospel of Barnabas&quot;, and an annotated first edition of &quot;Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica&quot; by Sir Isaac Newton. In 2017, a member of staff discovered an original Giorgione sketch in Rare Books and Special Collections with a definitive date and cause of death for Giorgione, information that had been lost for over 500 years in a 1497 edition of Dante Alighieri&#x27;s Divine Comedy.

== A brief history of the Library==
In 1885, the university received thirty thousand pounds from the estate of the late Thomas Fisher, retired bootmaker and property investor, to be used &quot;in establishing and maintaining a library&quot;.

There was a difference of opinion in the university on how to spend the bequest. The Chancellor thought the fund should be used for a building and to contribute to the salary of a Librarian, but the Vice Chancellor and Library Committee preferred to buy books. In 1887 a compromise was reached. £20,000 plus accumulated interest was set aside for a building fund with the hope that the government would provide matching funds and £10,000 was directed to an endowment for books.

After many reversals and delays the New South Wales government agreed to fund the full cost of a new library building and the Fisher capital could be preserved as an endowed book fund. Plans were drawn up for the library by the Government Architect, Walter Vernon, and construction took eight years.

The first Fisher Library opened in 1909. The reading room was in the Gothic tradition with a magnificent cedar roof but the adjoining multi-tier book stack was of advanced design, including two electric book lifts. The reading room is now the MacLaurin Hall.

==Fisher Library==

Fisher Library is the largest and first branch of the library system, located on Eastern Avenue on the Camperdown Campus, adjacent to Victoria Park. The Fisher Library is for University of Sydney students and staff. Its collection focuses on humanities, social science and commercial disciplines. The original Fisher Library, in the 19th century, was housed in the Quadrangle in what is presently the Senate Room. A purpose-built Fisher Library was completed in 1908 at the southwest corner of the Quadrangle, with its former reading room now known as MacLaurin Hall. The library was moved to its present location in 1962. Although it appears to be one building, the university classifies it as two separate buildings which are connected by foyer areas on the lower floors.

Fisher North

(Building F03) was built in 1962 and holds multiple copies of texts commonly used by undergraduate students of the university. This building also houses two computer labs, the audio and visual collection, the microform collection, the rare books and special collections section, and the photocopying room.

Fisher South

(Building F04) was built in 1967 with copper-clad outer walls. It is an accessible stack library with a larger and more historical collection. This building also houses the East Asian collection, the University Archives, and silent study desks. Some of the building&#x27;s space is used by the School of Psychology.

==Herbert Smith Freehills Law Library==

Named after Herbert Smith Freehills, the Law Library moved into the New Law Building (F10) on the Camperdown Campus in April 2009, along with the rest of the Sydney Law School.

Located on Eastern Avenue, adjacent to Victoria Park, the Law Library is for University of Sydney students and staff. It is spread over 5000 square metres of floor space and houses substantial collections that support the needs of the Law School.

The library consists of a ground floor that contains the majority of the collections, staff area, information desk, printing/photocopying facilities and computer access. Upstairs on the mezzanine level are the research collections and six more group study rooms. All of these rooms are equipped with computers.

==SciTech Library==

Following an international design competition, the SciTech Library was opened in late 2008 on the first floor of the new Jane Foss Russell Building, at the junction between the Darlington and Camperdown campuses. It consolidates the collections of the former architecture, engineering, Madsen and mathematics libraries in one location.

There is an exhibition space, meeting and training rooms, private booths and group tables in the SciTech Library.

== ThinkSpace ==
ThinkSpace is a &quot;technology showcase&quot; and &quot;creative play space&quot;. These technologies are supported by Peer Learning Advisers (PLAs) who guide, support and assist clients in using the ThinkSpace. The space was officially launched on 1 September 2016.

It has:
* a Lulzbot Taz6 3D printer
* a Carvey CNC
* One Button Recording Studio
* Video Wall
* iMacs
* Soldering station
* graphics tablets
* touchscreen pods.

== CreateSpace ==
CreateSpace is on Level 4 of the Susan Wakil Health Building on the Camperdown Campus. It officially opened on 1 March 2021.

==Susan Wakil Health Building Library==
Opened on 22 February 2021, this library occupies three levels of the new Susan Wakil Health Building on the Camperdown Campus, situated in the university&#x27;s growing health precinct, near the Charles Perkins Centre and Prince Alfred Hospital (RPAH).

The Susan Wakil Health Building (SWHB) Library has physical collections with a focus on health sciences, nursing and midwifery.

==The Quarter==

The Quarter is a postgraduate coursework space located on the ground floor of the Badham Building on Science Road next to the Holme Building, one of the centres of student activity on Camperdown Campus.

The Quarter was formerly called the Badham Library, and the Badham Library&#x27;s collection was consolidated into the SciTech Library.

==Camden Commons==
Camden Library is located at 335 Werombi Road on the University of Sydney Camden Campus, approximately 65 km west from the City of Sydney, located just outside Camden.

The library supports research, teaching and study in the fields of veterinary science and agriculture. The library underwent a refurbishment in 2015 as part of its transition to a library commons.

==Conservatorium Library==
The Conservatorium Library is located within the Sydney Conservatorium of Music Building, Macquarie Street by the gates to Government House, right next to the Royal Botanic Gardens in the centre of the city.

The library was not always within the Greenway Building, in fact, due to space problems, many departments of the Conservatorium found themselves spread around the city during the last century. The library spent time in what is now the Intercontinental Hotel as well as other locations around Pitt and Hunter streets. The need for one location with enough space for the Sydney Conservatorium of Music prompted the State Government to step in and rebuild the Greenway Building at a cost of A$144 million. In 2001, upon completion of the works, the entire Conservatorium (including the library) moved back into what is now a renovation of a historical space.

The entrance level contains the display room for exhibits and the majority of the collection as well as the public access computers, printers and photocopiers. Level 1 includes the quiet study areas, the training room, and an AV room.

==Other collections==

Most of the other libraries of the University of Sydney Library are associated with particular schools and faculties. While these libraries specialise in their collections, there is no restriction on their use by borrowers.

<text>Sam Jaffe (May 21, 1901 – January 10, 2000) was, at different points in his career in the motion picture industry, an agent, a producer, and a studio executive.

==Biography==
Jaffe was born in the Harlem neighborhood of New York City, the son of Russian-Jewish immigrants Hannah and Max Jaffe. He had three older siblings: Joseph, David, and Adeline. He was raised on the Lower East Side of Manhattan.

After dropping out of DeWitt Clinton High School, he took a job as an office boy for the Famous Players–Lasky Corporation where his brother-in-law, B. P. Schulberg, was an executive. He eventually worked his way up through the ranks to become the executive in charge of production including films directed by Ernst Lubitsch, Josef von Sternberg, and Rouben Mamoulian. In 1932, he was released from Paramount over internal politics. 

He worked briefly for Harry Cohn at Columbia Pictures before joining the Schulberg-Feldman agency, co-founded by his older sister Adeline Schulberg with Charles K. Feldman. In 1933, his sister left the firm to form the Ad Schulberg agency after her divorce from B.P. Schulberg; the firm represented such top actors as Marlene Dietrich, Fredric March, and Herbert Marshall before she sold it and moved to London. 

In 1935, Jaffe opened his own talent agency named the Jaffe Agency. While running the agency, he convinced 20th Century Fox head Darryl F. Zanuck to let him produce &quot;The Fighting Sullivans&quot; in 1944. He successfully represented several stars and directors of the era, including Humphrey Bogart, Fritz Lang, Raoul Walsh, Stanley Kubrick, Lauren Bacall, David Niven, Zero Mostel, Richard Burton, Mary Astor, Barbara Stanwyck, Lee J. Cobb, and Jennifer Jones. In the late 1940s, his business was negatively affected by the investigations of many of his clients by the House Un-American Activities Committee investigations into Hollywood. In 1949, he sold the Jaffe Agency to his brother-in-law, Phil Gersh, who had been working with him.

In 1959, Jaffe retired and moved to London. There he produced several films, including &quot;Born Free&quot; (1966) and &quot;Theater of Blood&quot; (1973). In 1985, he returned to Los Angeles and became a collector of modern art.

==Personal life==
Jaffe was married to Mildred Gersh, also from New York. One of her younger brothers was Phil Gersh, who moved from New York to Los Angeles and became a Hollywood agent. After working with Jaffe, Gersh purchased the Jaffe Agency in 1949. He renamed it in the 1960s as The Gersh Agency. 

Sam and Mildred Jaffe had three daughters: Naomi Jaffe Carroll, Barbara Jaffe Kohn, and Judith Jaffe Tolmach Silber.

<doc id="1021136" wikidata="Q719247" url="?curid=1021136" title="Sam Jaffe">
<text>Shalom &quot;Sam&quot; Jaffe (March 10, 1891 – March 24, 1984) was an American actor, teacher, musician, and engineer. In 1951, he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in &quot;The Asphalt Jungle&quot; (1950). He also appeared in &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot; (1951) and &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; (1959), and is additionally known for his roles as the titular character in &quot;Gunga Din&quot; (1939) and as the &quot;High Lama&quot; in &quot;Lost Horizon&quot; (1937).

==Early life==
Jaffe was born to Ukrainian Jewish parents Heida (Ada) and Barnett Jaffe at 97 Orchard Street (current location of the Lower East Side Tenement Museum) in New York City, New York. His mother was a Yiddish actress in Odesa, Ukraine, prior to moving to the United States; his father was a jeweller. He was the youngest of four children; his siblings were Abraham, Sophie, and Annie. As a child, he appeared in Yiddish theatre productions with his mother, who after moving to the United States became a prominent actress and vaudeville star. He graduated from Townsend Harris High School and studied engineering at City College of New York, graduating in 1912. He later attended Columbia University for graduate studies. He also worked for several years as a teacher, and then dean, of mathematics at the Bronx Cultural Institute, a college preparatory school, before returning to acting in 1915.

==Career==

As a young man, he lived in Greenwich Village in the same apartment building as a young John Huston. The two men became good friends and remained so for life. Jaffe was later to star in two of Huston&#x27;s films: &quot;The Asphalt Jungle&quot; and &quot;The Barbarian and the Geisha&quot;. Jaffe&#x27;s closest friends included Zero Mostel, Edward G. Robinson, Ray Bradbury, and Igor Stravinsky. In 1923 he appeared in the Broadway premiere of &quot;God of Vengeance (Got fun Nekome)&quot; by Sholem Asch, as Reb Ali. The production became notorious after the cast, producer, and theatre owner were indicted and found guilty on charges of indecency in May 1923. Jaffe began to work in film in 1934, rising to prominence with his first role as the mad Tsar Peter III in &quot;The Scarlet Empress&quot;. In 1938, Jaffe was forty-seven years old when he played the title role of &quot;bhisti&quot; (waterbearer) &quot;Gunga Din&quot;.

Jaffe was blacklisted by the Hollywood movie studio bosses during the 1950s, supposedly for being a communist sympathizer. Despite being blacklisted, he was hired first by Robert Wise for &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot; and then by director William Wyler for his role in the 1959 Academy Award-winning version of &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;.

Jaffe co-starred in the ABC television series, &quot;Ben Casey,&quot; as Dr. David Zorba from 1961 to 1965, alongside Vince Edwards. He also had many guest-starring roles on other series, including &quot;Batman&quot; (as Mr. Zoltan Zorba) and in the western &quot;Alias Smith and Jones&quot;. In 1975, he co-starred as a retired doctor who is murdered by Janet Leigh in the &quot;Columbo&quot; episode &quot;Forgotten Lady&quot;. He also appeared with an all-star cast in the TV pilot film of Rod Serling&#x27;s &quot;Night Gallery&quot; and as Emperor Norton in one episode of &quot;Bonanza&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
Jaffe was married to American operatic soprano and musical comedy star Lillian Taiz from 1926 until her death from cancer in 1941. In 1956, he married actress Bettye Ackerman, 33 years his junior, with whom he later co-starred in &quot;Ben Casey&quot;. She died on November 1, 2006. He had no children from either marriage. 

A Democrat, Jaffe supported the campaign of Adlai Stevenson II during the 1952 presidential election.

Jaffe died of cancer in Beverly Hills, California, in 1984, two weeks after his 93rd birthday. He was cremated at the Pasadena Crematory in Altadena, California, and his ashes were given to his surviving wife, Bettye, and, upon her death in 2006, buried with her at Williston Cemetery in Williston, South Carolina.

<doc id="1021140" wikidata="Q6663045" url="?curid=1021140" title="Lo-Pro">
<text>Lo-Pro is an American rock band formed in 2002 by Pete Murray and Neil Godfrey after the disbandment of their previous band, Ultraspank, in 2001. After attracting the attention of Aaron Lewis of Staind, the band signed to a major record label, Geffen Records, and released their debut album, &quot;Lo-Pro&quot; in 2003. After a year of touring in support of the album, they would be dropped from their label. The band stayed together, but it would be almost six years until any further music releases, with the band opting to record and re-record several album&#x27;s worth of material, participate in side-projects, and perform live shows prior to finalizing new material for release.

The long gap in releases in turn lead to a number of consecutive releases in the following years, including the &quot;Letting Go&quot; EP in 2009, a second album, &quot;The Beautiful Sounds of Revenge&quot;, in 2010, and an acoustic album, &quot;Bittersweet&quot;, under the pseudonym &quot;Life on Planet 9&quot;, in 2011. The band briefly returned to working under the Lo-Pro name to release a third studio album, &quot;Disintegration Effect&quot;, in 2013, before returning to the &quot;Life On Planet 9&quot; moniker to release &quot;The Theory of Everything&quot; in 2014, and &quot;Higher&quot; in January 2017. Concurrently, Murray and ex-bassist John Fahnestock have also started up and released music under a new band called White Noise Owl as well.

==History==

===Formation and &quot;Lo-Pro&quot; (2002–2004)===
In the late 1990s, vocalist Pete Murray and guitarist Neil Godfrey formed and recorded two albums in the band Ultraspank. After the poor sales of their second album, &quot;Progress&quot;, the band parted ways with their record label and ultimately disbanded. Initially burned out with the music industry, Murray and Godfrey eventually met up and began working on music together, refreshed being able to work without the pressures of dealing with a label. The two put together a demo album in one of their bedrooms, where they recorded everything between the two of them; Godfrey handling all guitar work and Murray handling vocals and all other aspects through programming in Pro Tools. They were able to attract the attention of Aaron Lewis, of Staind, who had just started up his own vanity record label, &quot;413 Records&quot;, at Geffen Records. Lewis made the band the first to be signed to the label, stating that he felt even the early rough demo sounded &quot;better than 80 percent of the albums released today.&quot;

After being signed based on the demo alone, Murray and Godfrey needed to assemble a full band for the band&#x27;s for recording their debut album. The band recruited Tommy Stewart, the previous drummer for Godsmack, as their drummer. Additionally, John Fahnestock, who had met Murray and Godfrey while touring alongside Ultraspank in the band Snot at Ozzfest 1998, was also recruited as the bassist. The band rounded out the lineup with second guitarist Pete Ricci.

With the band assembled, recording for the album began in January 2003. The band worked with music producer Don Gilmore, who had previously worked with Linkin Park and Pearl Jam. The band recorded for the first half of the year, and then released &quot;Lo-Pro&quot; on September 30, 2003. It peaked at no. 9 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Heatseekers chart, and stayed on the chart for two weeks. One single was released, &quot;Sunday&quot;, which peaked at no. 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock Tracks and no. 27 on Modern Rock Tracks. The track also appeared in the 989 Studios game &quot;MLB 2004&quot; for the PlayStation 2. Murray said of the single &quot;It&#x27;s definitely not about watching football or going to church. It&#x27;s really about how I&#x27;ve never had anything to look forward to on Sunday. I never liked going to school or going to a job, and when Sunday comes, you just know things are gonna hit the wringer the following day.&quot; The band had planned on releasing a second single, bassist Jonathan Fahnestock had even asked the internet community to vote for which track it would be, but it never surfaced. However, the track &quot;Ignition&quot; was featured in the 2004 PC game &quot;The Ultimate Dodge Garage&quot;.

The band toured extensively alongside Staind and Three Days Grace into 2004. Additionally, on April 24, 2004, they released a 3 track acoustic EP exclusively through Napster, containing acoustic takes of &quot;Sunday&quot;, &quot;Ignition&quot;, and &quot;Not Me&quot;. However, by June 2004, the band announced that they had been dropped by Geffen Records. Despite this, the band confirmed that they were still on good terms with Lewis and Staind, were not disbanding, and were in fact already working on writing and recording more music.

===&quot;Letting Go&quot; and &quot;The Beautiful Sounds of Revenge&quot; (2005–2010)===
After the loss of their record label, the band would stay together, but would not formally release music again until 2009. The band would go several years with minimal outward communication with the public, but would instead commonly release a new song for internet streaming once or twice a year to show they were still together and progress was being made on future releases. The band would allude to &quot;Let It Go&quot; as a tentative title for future releases at the time. From their Myspace account, they streamed early versions of many songs, including the track &quot;Ingenious&quot; in May 2005, &quot;Breathe&quot; in May 2006, &quot;Blame Me&quot; in June 2006, and &quot;Texas&quot; and &quot;You Lie&quot; in August 2007.

During these years, a number of different side-projects were also initiated by various members of the band. Murray, taking a break from creating music, turned to more producer-type roles. Most notably, he engineered and co-produced industrial rock band Ghost Machine&#x27;s album &quot;Hypersensitive&quot;, where he worked with future Five Finger Death Punch vocalist Ivan Moody and The Clay People&#x27;s guitarist John Stevens. After completing the album, Murray started up a new band with Stevens, and Walter Flakus of Stabbing Westward, called Chokt. Described as an outlet for music that didn&#x27;t quite fit Lo-Pro, a formal album was never released, although nine songs were streamed online over the course of time before Lo-Pro would release another album. Meanwhile, Tommy Stewart worked as a short-term replacement drummer for a number of bands such as Fuel and Everclear, while John Fahnestock initially started a new band, &quot;Noise Within&quot; before eventually leaving permanently when his previous band, Snot, reformed with a new lead singer as Tons. He would be replaced by past Ultraspank member Jerry Olivera.

In 2007, the band began to focus on a more acoustic-driven songs. Upon Aaron Lewis wrapping up touring in support Staind&#x27;s &quot;Chapter V&quot; album, Lo-Pro joined him for a short acoustic tour. The band debuted a number of songs that would later be released on future album, including tracks &quot;Letting Go&quot;, &quot;Hang On&quot;, &quot;Today&quot;, and &quot;All I Have&quot;. Murray mentioned the possibility a live DVD release of these concerts, though such a release has yet to surface. Additionally, the band started another Myspace page up under the name of &quot;Lo-Pro Acoustic&quot;, and streamed several new acoustic studio tracks, including &quot;Clean the Slate&quot;, the otherwise unreleased &quot;This is Not Goodbye&quot;, and a cover of Filter&#x27;s song &quot;Consider This&quot;.

In an early 2008 interview, Murray detailed the band&#x27;s progress and future plans:

&quot;We really want to release something but we&#x27;re the most prolific we&#x27;ve ever been so we&#x27;ve been recording like crazy. It&#x27;s hard to stop. We&#x27;ve got a couple of rock records almost ready and we&#x27;re almost done with our acoustic record, we promise...You&#x27;re definitely going to hear a raw version of Lo-Pro which was always our intention. I love our first record but, holy crap, it was over-produced. We don&#x27;t nit pick as much anymore, we move on. The acoustic album will be a first as well...We&#x27;re lagging but we&#x27;re really hoping the get this acoustic record out first in the spring with a rock record right behind it.&quot; 

Despite plans to release music in early 2008, the band feared the material felt more like a demo than a finished product, so they began to rework, expand, and further polish the material more in further recording sessions with Angus Cooke. The band would post two more tracks, &quot;This Way&quot; and &quot;Get Out of My Way&quot; in August 2008, neither of which would make the cut for future releases. Murray would also release a demo of a piano-based cover version of the song &quot;Drive&quot; by The Cars, of which he was unsuccessful in convincing band members to record a full band version. The early version of &quot;Texas&quot; was even featured briefly in the &quot;Scrubs&quot; episode &quot;My Bad Too&quot; in 2008.

The band spent the first half of the year quietly working recording more music, before announcing in May 2009 that they would be part of the &quot;Stimulate This&quot; tour in mid-2009 with Staind, Shinedown, Halestorm, and Chevelle. The band would also briefly join Creed&#x27;s reunion arena tour, around the same time-frame, playing on some of the dates where Creed would record their live DVD &quot;Creed Live&quot;, which broke the world record for most video cameras used at a live music event. With the album still not ready, but the band wanting something to release to capitalize on the high-profile touring, they instead opted to release a six track extended play titled &quot;Letting Go&quot;. The band would release a physical copy at their live shows in July, and a digital copy in October. The physical version contained six tracks, &quot;Texas&quot;, &quot;Hang On&quot;, &quot;Alive&quot;, &quot;Today&quot;, &quot;Breathe&quot;, and &quot;Letting Go&quot;, while the digital version lacked the track &quot;Alive&quot;. Murray mentioned that &quot;Alive&quot; was kept off due to &quot;single potential&quot; for their future full-length album, although the track had already been made available for free download just prior to touring.

After the 2009 touring, the band returned to the studio and completed their second full album, which they would announce to be &quot;The Beautiful Sounds of Revenge&quot;. The band announced they had signed to smaller indie label &quot;Rocket Science Ventures&quot; and that the album would be released on May 25, 2010, though it was eventually delayed two weeks to June 8 to fit a few more songs on the album. The album&#x27;s first and only single would be the track &quot;Alive&quot;, which was released on May 4, 2010. The album contained all tracks from &quot;Letting Go&quot; except for &quot;Today&quot;, plus an additional nine tracks, although many were reworked versions of tracks streamed in the time between the two albums.

The band toured in support of the album in the second half of 2010, most notably an acoustic show in the benefit concert being put on Aaron Lewis in support of his charity foundation &quot;It Takes A Community&quot; on August 14, 2010. Additionally, the final version of the song &quot;Texas&quot; is a playable track for the game &quot;Tap Tap Revenge 3&quot;.

===&quot;Bittersweet&quot; (2011)===
After the release of &quot;The Beautiful Sounds of Revenge&quot;, Murray confirmed that there were still intentions of releasing an acoustic album as he had alluded to in the years prior, but the band had wanted to return from their inactivity with an album with an electric sound closer to their original album first, then proceed with the acoustic material. Recent comments have confirmed working on recording acoustic material. In August 2010, they released a new acoustic version of &quot;Clean the Slate&quot;, different from the version available on their Myspace in 2007. It was originally in contention for the acoustic album, but was ultimately left off.

Murray confirmed again that the album was still coming out, and was due out sometime in Spring 2011, and that there&#x27;d be a holiday preview of a song off the album with a &quot;Yule Log&quot; video, much like how they had done previously on New Year&#x27;s Eve 2009. One new song, &quot;Sweet Silence&quot;, was debuted in this fashion.

On July 31, Murray announced that the album would be titled &quot;Bittersweet&quot;, and would actually be released under the pseudonym &quot;Life on Planet 9&quot;. Despite releasing it under this new name, Murray confirmed that it was still the Lo-Pro acoustic album, containing the same members, that had been working for years. It was first released in physical format at a live show on August 20, 2011, and was made available on iTunes on August 20, 2011. The album was digitally released on CDBaby on August 24, and on August 25 on iTunes.

The album contains a new version of the song &quot;Wheels&quot;, a song Lo-Pro had demoed for their self-titled album in 2002.

On December 21, Murray posted the yearly Yule Log, revealing a new song entitled &quot;Ammunition&quot;.

===&quot;Disintegration Effect&quot; (2012–2013)===
In early 2012, Murray confirmed that the band had started the process of putting together their third studio album, but said that, unlike prior releases, they wouldn&#x27;t be leaking or streaming tracks beforehand because it sounded &quot;different&quot;. Murray also confirmed that the band would continue to record their more acoustic/electronic material under the &quot;Life on Planet 9&quot; moniker, concurrently with the third Lo-Pro album, and released a new track for it titled &quot;What Would You Say&quot;. Despite both moving concurrently, the band&#x27;s primary focus would be releasing the third album under the &quot;Lo-Pro&quot; name. By the end of the year, the band has completed eight songs for the album and were aiming for an early 2013 release. In December 2012, Murray narrowed it down further, stating that the band was aiming for a February 2013 release date. A ninth track was completed in January 2013. By early February, Murray stated that the band had started the mixing process, and that the album release would likely fall into March 2013. He also announced that a Life on Planet 9 album would be released after the album.

On April 22, 2013, Murray announced that the title of the third album would be &quot;Disintegration Effect&quot;, which was released on May 14, 2013.

=== Side-projects and other releases (2014–present)===

After the release of &quot;Disintegration Effect&quot;, Murray joined a new band, called White Noise Owl with original Lo-Pro bassist John Fahnestock. They released an EP, &quot;Until We Meet Again&quot;, on March 11, 2014, and have recorded a full-length album as well, which is scheduled for release in 2017. Two more albums under the &quot;Life On Planet 9&quot; moniker were recorded and released as well: &quot;The Theory of Everything&quot; in 2014, and &quot;Higher&quot; on January 31, 2017.

==Musical style and influences==
The band is commonly classified as a form of melodic hard rock.

Influences for the band include bands such as Pink Floyd and Alice in Chains. Murray specifically says several bands have influenced his vocals, including Led Zeppelin and U2, and the music of Peter Gabriel.

<doc id="1021141" wikidata="Q181844" url="?curid=1021141" title="Aya Matsuura">
<text>is a former Japanese pop singer and actress, from Himeji, Hyogo, Japan.

==Career==

===2000–2009: Hello! Project===
Aya auditioned in 2000 for the fourth Morning Musume &amp; Heike Michiyo Protegee Audition and was selected along with Sheki-Dol to become a part of what was later known as Hello! Project. After being chosen from that audition, Matsuura began her solo career. In time, she would become one of Hello! Project&#x27;s biggest acts.

Aside from a successful solo career, Matsuura (nicknamed Ayaya), also did numerous collaborations with other members of Hello! Project, including special, usually short lived groups Gomattou with Maki Goto and Miki Fujimoto; Nochiura Natsumi with Maki Goto and Natsumi Abe; and DEF.DIVA with Maki Goto, Natsumi Abe, and Rika Ishikawa. She also did the &quot;Folk Song&quot; series which feature Yuko Nakazawa and other Hello! Project artists, as well as Hello! Project&#x27;s shuffle groups (3nin Matsuri in 2001, Odoru 11 in 2002, Salt5 in 2003, and the larger H.P. All Stars in 2004).

She also formed the duo GAM with Miki Fujimoto in debuted September 2006. Their first single, &quot;Thanks!&quot; reached the #2 position on the Oricon.

Matsuura starred in the Japanese film &quot;Sukeban Deka: Codename = Asamiya Saki&quot; (known internationally as &quot;Yo-Yo Girl Cop&quot;) opposite Rika Ishikawa, released on September 30, 2006.

On October 9, 2006, both concerts she was supposed to hold that day were cancelled, as she was not feeling well.
Soon several unsourced rumours emerged considering the possibility she might be suffering from Temporomandibular joint disorder. Following the cancellation of the two concerts, Matsuura&#x27;s management confirmed the rumours, reported the young idol had been taking painkillers to continue working and scheduled a press conference to discuss her condition. On the following day Matsuura made a public statement on PBS apologizing to her fans and expressing her desire to get back to her singing career as soon as possible.

Since her press conference, Matsuura returned to her normal hosting duties on her weekly radio show, &quot;Matsuura Aya no All Night Nippon&quot; and returned to singing in a limited capacity, as demonstrated on her appearance on Hey! Hey! Hey! Music Champ on October 23, 2006.

On March 8, 2008, Matsuura—as a secret guest—performed at the opening ceremony of the Fourth Special Olympics Japan Winter National Games, a national event in preparation of the 2009 Special Olympics World Winter Games held in Boise, Idaho. She performed the song &quot;Kizuna&quot;, which was released on May 21, 2008, as her 20th single.

===2008–2013: Graduation and Reshuffle===
It was officially announced on October 19, 2008, that Matsuura would be graduating from Hello! Project along with the rest of Elder Club. Before her graduation, Matsuura released her fifth studio album, &quot;Omoi Afurete&quot;, on January 21, 2009, and her 21st single, &quot;Chocolate Damashii&quot;, was released on February 11 for Valentine&#x27;s Day.

Matsuura graduated from Hello! Project on March 31, 2009, but months later, on August 26, 2009, Matsuura launched her own blog called Ayablog and announced that her &quot;Omoi Afurete&quot; tour will be her last for two or three years. However, she has since released a Cover Album (&quot;Click You, Link Me&quot;, 2010). In late August 2011, it was revealed that she is diagnosed with endometriosis, which has been and will continue to limit her concert activities in the future. However, from 2009 to 2013, She has consistently released Acoustic Concerts, known as &quot;Aya Matsuura&#x27;s Maniac Series&quot;. She was signed to UpFront Create, along with some of the members of the Hello Project! Elder Club. At the end of the year, she performed along with all other Hello Project members at the concert &quot;Hello! Project COUNTDOWN PARTY 2013 ~GOOD BYE &amp; HELLO!~&quot; where she announced her indefinite hiatus.

===2022: Return to Entertainment===
On January 27, Matsuura was a guest on the podcast &quot;Matthew&#x27;s Matthew&quot; hosted by Takashi Fujii, thus marking the end of an almost decade long hiatus. On April 14, Matsuura was featured in a commercial for Nescafe &#x27;Excella&#x27; coffee. On August 9, Keita Tachibana announced on Twitter that a new single &#x27;Addicted&#x27; would be released on November 25.

===Other appearances===
Matsuura has appeared in many commercials for various companies; notably Pretz snack foods, Epson color printers, and Kirin beverages. She has also taken part and co-hosts the television show Utawara with other names in Japanese entertainment such as Johnny Jimusho&#x27;s Jun Matsumoto.

==Personal life==
Matsuura and Keita Tachibana registered their marriage on August 4, 2013, after almost 12 years of dating. They held their wedding ceremony in Hawaii on October 7. On December 21, 2014, the couple announced the birth of their first child, a baby girl.

<text>The California Conservation Corps, CCC, is a department of the government of California, falling under the state cabinet-level California Resources Agency. The CCC is a voluntary work development program specifically for men and women between the ages of 18 and 25 (up to 29 for veterans), offering work in environmental conservation, fire protection, land maintenance, and emergency response to natural disasters. Members of the CCC are referred to as &quot;Corpsmembers&quot;, and are paid a monthly stipend; starting July 2022, the amount was $2,600.

==History==
The bill to create the California Conservation Corps was co-authored by California State Senator Ruben Ayala. The legislation was signed into law by Governor Jerry Brown on July 7, 1976, modeling the corps after the federal Civilian Conservation Corps that started with Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal in the 1930s. Brown envisioned a department marketed specifically to the state&#x27;s young people as &quot;a combination Jesuit seminary, Israeli kibbutz, and Marine Corps boot camp.&quot; Prominent amongst the early CCC administrators was war hero B. T. Collins. The CCC replaced the California Ecology Corps that was created by executive order of Governor Ronald Reagan in 1971 as an &quot;alternative service&quot; option for Conscientious Objectors during the Vietnam War.

Following the end of his governorship, Brown&#x27;s successor, Governor George Deukmejian, signed legislation to eliminate the CCC&#x27;s sunset clause by making it a permanent department under the California Resources Agency in 1983.

The duties of operation falling to the CCC include trail maintenance, riparian zone restoration, tree planting and exotic plant species removal, construction, and emergency flood and wildfire response. Other organizations pay the CCC to do the work. Corpsmembers are offered the chance to complete their high school diploma through independent CCC schools and are trained in cooking, office work, chainsaw, and vehicle maintenance. The CCC also encourages corpsmembers to seek higher education or vocational training by offering scholarships.

Corpsmembers in some centers across the state participate in CAB (Corpsmember Advisory Board), an employee/ resident board established to be the middle ground. The board is responsible for community check ups and upholding a strong morale among the center&#x27;s population, as well as bringing up pressing concerns the community faces on a weekly basis.

Since 1992, the California Department of Finance has allotted less funding to the CCC, forcing the closure of numerous residential centers throughout the state.

The CCC has received presidential praise as well as numerous awards for its work.

<text>The population of the region of Palestine, which approximately corresponds to modern Israel and the Palestinian territories, has varied in both size and ethnic composition throughout the history of Palestine.

Studies of Palestine&#x27;s demographic changes over the millennia have shown that a Jewish majority in the first century AD had changed to a Christian majority by the 3rd century AD, and later to a Muslim majority, which is thought to have existed in Mandatory Palestine (1920-1948) since at least the 12th century AD, during which the total shift to Arabic language was completed.

==Iron Age==

During the seventh century BC, no fewer than eight nations were settled in Palestine. These included the Arameans of the kingdom of Geshur; the Samaritans who replaced the Israelite kingdom in Samaria; the Phoenicians in the northern cities and parts of Galilee; the Philistines in the Philistine pentapolis; the three kingdoms of the Transjordan– Ammon, Moab and Edom; and the Judaeans of Kingdom of Judah.

According to Finkelstein and Broshi, the population of Palestine at the end of the eighth century BC was around 400,000. In the area of Judah in the central hills, Benjamin and Jerusalem, the population was approximately 110,000. By the early sixth century, Ofer&#x27;s survey results suggest that around 100,000 lived in the kingdom of Judah, with the population in the central hills, Benjamin and Jerusalem about 69,000.

A study by Yigal Shiloh of The Hebrew University suggests that the population of Palestine in the Iron Age could have never exceeded one million. He writes: &quot;... the population of the country in the Roman-Byzantine period greatly exceeded that in the Iron Age...&quot; Shiloh accepted Israeli archaeologist Magen Broshi&#x27;s estimates of Palestine&#x27;s population at 1,000,000–1,250,000 and noted that Iron Age Israel&#x27;s population must have been less considering population growth. &quot;...If we accept Broshi&#x27;s population estimates, which appear to be confirmed by the results of recent research, it follows that the estimates for the population during the Iron Age must be set at a lower figure.&quot;
One study of population growth from 1000 BC to 750 BC estimated the population of Palestine (Judah and Israel) had an average natural growth of 0.4 per cent per annum.

==Persian period==


After the Babylonian conquest of Judah and exile, the population and settlement density of Jerusalem, the Shephelah and the Naqab desert dropped significantly. The Persian province of Yehud Medinata was sparsely-populated and predominantly rural, with around half of the settlements of late Iron age Judah and a population of around 30,000 in the 5th to 4th centuries BC. On the other hand, settlement continuity is discerned in the northern parts of the Judean mountains and the Benjamin area. Cities such as Tell en-Nasbeh, Gibeon and Bethel managed to escape destruction and remained continuously inhabited until the early Achaemenid rule.

As early as the 7th century BC, Edomites had lived in the Naqab desert and southern Judah, and by the time Judah fell in 586 BC there was already a substantial Edomite population in southern Judah. When the kingdom of Edom itself succumbed, those people continued its traditions in the south, which the Arabic-speaking Qedarites controlled. This area, which became known as Idumaea, was inhabited by a diverse population of Edomites, Judahites, Phoenicians, Qedarites and other Arabs. 
Based on analysis of epigraphic material and ostraca from the region, around 32% of recorded names were Arabic, 27% were Edomite, 25% were Northwest Semitic, 10% were Judahite (Hebrew) and 5% were Phoenician. A few names were also classified Egyptian and Old Iranian.

The exilic returnees resettled during the time of Cyrus the Great, perhaps with a heightened sense of their ethnic identity. Along the coast of western Palestine, the Phoenicians expanded their presence, while Moabites and Ammonites took refuge in the Cisjordan after the destruction of their kingdoms in 582 BC.

==Hellenistic and Hasmonean period==

Following the Macedonian conquest of the Achaemenid Empire and the subsequent Wars of the Diadochi, Palestine came under Hellenistic rule and was contested by the Seleucids and Ptolemaics.

Between 167 and 160 BC, the Jewish rebel faction of the Maccabees revolted against Seleucid rule, ultimately leading to the independence of the Hasmonean dynasty. Under John Hyrcanus, the Hasmoneans expanded their territories beyond the traditional confines of Judea and incorporated non-Jewish areas in the process. 1 Maccabees relates that the non-Jewish inhabitants of Gezer and Joppa were expelled by Simon Thassi, who settled Jews in their place. Coinciding with the account of Josephus, archaeological evidence attests to significant destruction in the urban and rural settlements in Idumaea, Samaria and the coastal cities from the Hasmonean conquests, followed by the resettlement of Jews in the newly conquered territories. Nevertheless, there&#x27;s evidence that some of the non-Jewish inhabitants stayed in all of the newly conquered areas.

Many sites in Idumaea experienced destruction, including Maresha, Khirbet el-Rasm, Tel Arad, Khirbet &#x27;Uza and possibly Lachish. The lower city of Maresha and Tel Beersheba were soon abandoned, and evidence for an increased Idumaean presence in Egypt suggests some immigrated there. Idumaeans were eventually forcibly proselytized and co-opted into the Jewish nation by John Hyrcanus. Further north, the Galilee received significant Jewish migration from Judea after its conquest, contributing to a 50% increase in settlements, while the pagan population was greatly reduced. By the end of Alexander Jannaeus&#x27; reign, the Galilee was also predominantly Jewish. However, unlike John Hyrcanus, Alexander Jannaeus did not compel the non-Jews to assimilate to the Jewish ethnos and permitted minority &quot;ethnē&quot; to exist within Hasmonean borders, with the exception of Phoenician coastal cities in the north whom Josephus claims he enslaved.

==Roman period==
The Roman conquest of Judea led by Pompey took place in 63 BC. The Roman occupation encompassed the end of Jewish independence in Judea, the last years of the Hasmonean kingdom, the Herodian age and the rise of Christianity, the First Jewish–Roman War, and the fall of Jerusalem and the destruction of the Second Temple. The total population of Pharisees, the forerunners of modern Rabbinic Judaism, was around 6,000 (&quot;exakischilioi&quot;), according to Josephus.
Local population displacements occurred with the expulsion of the Jews from Jerusalem – &quot;In the earlier revolt in the previous century, 66–73 CE, Rome destroyed the Temple and forbade Jews to live in the remaining parts of Jerusalem; for this reason, the Rabbis gathered instead on the Mediterranean coast in Yavneh near Jaffa&quot;. Dispersal to other parts of the Roman Empire occurred, but some earlier settlements were also established as early as 4 BC.

Modern estimates vary: Applebaum argues that in the Herodian kingdom, there were 1.5 million Jews, a figure Ben David says covers the numbers in Judea alone. Salo Wittmayer Baron estimated the population at 2.3 million at the time of Roman emperor Claudius (reigned 41–54). According to Israeli archeologist Magen Broshi, west of the Jordan River the population certainly did not exceed 1 million: 
&quot;... the population of Palestine in antiquity did not exceed a million persons. It can also be shown, moreover, that this was more or less the size of the population in the peak period – the late Byzantine period, around AD 600&quot; 
Broshi made calculations based on the grain-producing capacity of Palestine and on its role in the indigenous diet, assuming an average annual per-capita consumption of 200 kg. (with a maximum of 250 kg.), which would work out to the limit of a sustainable population of 1,000,000 people, a figure which, Broshi states, remained roughly constant down to the end of the Byzantine period (600 CE). The proportion of Jews to gentiles is also unknown.

The Bar Kokhba revolt in the 2nd century saw a major shift in the population of Palestine. The sheer scale and scope of the overall destruction, according to a late epitome of Dio Cassius&#x27;s &quot;Roman History&quot;, where he states that Roman war operations in the country had left some 580,000 Jews dead, with many more dying of hunger and disease, while 50 of their most important outposts and 985 of their most famous villages were razed to the ground. &quot;Thus,&quot; writes Dio Cassius, &quot;nearly the whole of Judaea was made desolate.&quot; Goodblatt contends that while Bar Kokhba rendered much of the Judaean Mountains and the Hebron Hills desolate, Jewish communities continued to thrive in other parts of Judea and Palestine as a whole.

&quot;The destruction of the Jewish metropolis of Jerusalem and its environs and the ventual refoundation of the city as the Roman colony of Aelia Capitolina had lasting repercussions. However, in other parts of Palestine the Jewish population remained strong. Literary and archaeological evidence indicates that in the Late Roman-early Byzantine era Jewish commuinities thrived along the eastern, southern and western edges of Judah, in the Galilee, Golan and the Beit Shean region. And a strong Jewish presence continued throughout this period in many &quot;poleis&quot;, including Caesarea Maritima and Scythopolis.&quot;

When exactly Jews became a minority is disputed. Eschel argues that a combination of three events: the rise of Christianity, the Jewish-Roman wars and Jewish Diaspora made Jews in the minority. David Goodblatt contends that Jews suffered a setback following the Bar Kokhba revolt (132–136), noting that Jews were still in the majority until the 3rd century and even beyond, when Christianity became the empire&#x27;s official religion, and continued to thrive in different parts of Palestine. According to Doron Bar, archaeological evidence of synagogue remains demonstrate a central Jewish presence throughout Palestine during the entire Byzantine period.

The &#x27;ascension&#x27; of Constantine the Great in 312 and Christianity becoming the official state religion of Rome in 391, consequently brought to an end Jewish dominance in Palestine. Already by the mid-3rd century the Jewish majority had been reported to have been lost, while others conclude that a Jewish majority lasted much longer – &quot;What does seem clear is a different kind of change – immigration of Christians and the conversion of pagans, Samaritans, and Jews eventually produced a Christian majority&quot;.
After the Bar Kokhba revolt of 132–136 CE the make-up of the population of Palestine remains in doubt due to the sparsity of data in the historical record. Figures vary considerably as to the demographics of Palestine in the Christian era.

No reliable data exist on the population of Palestine in the pre-Muslim period, either in absolute terms or in terms of shares of total population. Although many Jews were killed, expelled or sold off into slavery after the AD 66–70 and the 123–125 rebellions, the degree to which these transfers affected the Jewish dominance in Palestine is rarely addressed. What is certain is that Palestine did not lose its Jewish component. Goldblatt concludes that the Jews may have remained a majority into the 3rd century AD and even beyond. He notes that &#x27;Jewish followers of Jesus&#x27; (Jewish Christians) would not have taken part in the rebellions. Moreover, non-Christian conversions from Judaism after the Bar Kochba revolt were not given much attention. 
&quot;Indeed, many must have reacted to the catastrophe with despair and total abandonment of Judaism. Apostates from Judaism (aside from converts to Christianity) received little notice in antiquity from either Jewish or non-Jewish writers, but ambitious individuals are known to have turned pagan before the war, and it stands to reason that many more did so after its disastrous conclusion. It is impossible to determine the number who joined the budding Christian movement and the number who disappeared into the polytheist majority.&quot;

==Byzantine period==
The administrative reorganization of the region in 284–305 AD by the Eastern Romans produced three Palestinian provinces of &quot;Greater Palestine&quot; which lasted from the 4th to the early 7th centuries: Palaestina Prima, which included the historic regions of Philistia, Judea and Samaria with the capital in Caesarea Maritima; Palaestina Secunda, which included the Galilee, the Golan Heights, as well as parts of Perea (western Transjordan) and the Decapolis, with its capital being Scythopolis; and Palaestina Salutaris which included Idumaea, the Naqab desert, Arabia Petraea, parts of Sinai, and Transjordan south of the Dead Sea, with its capital in Petra.

Under the Byzantines, the religious landscape of Palestine underwent a significant transformation, propelled by the widescale Christianization of the local Jewish, pagan and Samaritan communities, as well as immigration of Christian pilgrims and monks into the Holy land. After the failure of Bar Kokhba revolt in 135, Jews were barred from living in a large part of former Judaea. During this period, Jews were concentrated in the Galilee, the Golan and marginal areas of the Judaean hills, between Eleutheropolis and Hebron in the Daromas, with significant Jewish settlement in the strip between Ein Gedi and Ascalon. Jews also lived in the southern Jordan Valley near Jericho, where they were employed in date and Balsam plantations; around Narbata, in Samaria and in the Jezreel Valley. However, the main centres of Jewish life and culture during this period were the cosmopolitan cities of the coastal plains, particularly Lydda, Jamnia, Azotus and Caesarea Maritima. Samaritans, originally concentrated in communities around Mount Gerizim, had spread beyond Samaria proper in the second century and established communities in the coastal plains, Judea and the Galilee, with some Samaritan villages located as far as Golan. However, the Samaritan revolts against the Byzantines in 484–573 and their forced conversion to Christianity under Maurice (582–602) and Heraclius (610–641) significantly diminished their numbers. 

Pagan tradition flourished in the period before Constantine, and pagans were a majority in the coastal plains, Judea, Samaria, the Naqab and much of the urban centers. Although proscribed in the Bible, pagan cults had thrived in Palestine throughout the First and Second Temple period, and many Jews did not escape it. According to E. Friedheim, many Jews in Palestine also embraced paganism and pagan cults again following the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 AD. Talmudic tradition forbid customs relating to &#x27;the Amorite ways&#x27;, showing a persistence of ancient Canaanite customs among the non-Jewish population and their inconsistent penetration into Jewish circles.

Christian presence at the start of this period was mainly evidenced in Hellenistic cities and some of the villages in southern Judea. However, Christianity&#x27;s early influence in either the Jewish, Samaritan or pagan rural areas was minor and came at a much later stage around the sixth century, when many of the community churches in Judea, western Galilee, the Naqab and other places were built. By the fifth century, many pagan temples in Palestine including those in Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Mamre, Tel Qadesh and Tel Dan, had been demolished, and churches were erected in their place. In the rural sector, vast areas of Palestine, such as Galilee and Samaria, had Jewish and Samaritan majorities, and Christianity spread in these areas far more gradually and at a slower pace, achieving real momentum only during the second half of the Byzantine period. 
Christianity had also spread in the Nabataean cities, towns and villages in southern Palestine, where a mixed Christian and pagan population lived, with elaborate churches built in Abdah, Mampsis and Subeita.

Palestine reached its peak population of around 1 to 1.5 million during this period. However, estimates of the relative proportions of Jews, Samaritans and pagans vary widely and are speculative. By counting settlements, Avi-Yonah estimated that Jews comprised half the population of the Galilee at the end of the 3rd century, and a quarter in the other parts of the country, but had declined to 10–15% of the total by 614. On the other hand, by counting churches and synagogues, Tsafrir estimated the Jewish proportion to be 25% in the Byzantine period. Stemberger, however, considers that Jews were the largest population group at the beginning of the 4th century, closely followed by the pagans. According to Schiffman, DellaPergola and Bar, Christians only became the majority of the country&#x27;s population at the beginning of the fifth century,

==Medieval Islamic Period==

Prior to the Muslim conquest of Palestine (635–640), Palaestina Prima had a population of 700 thousand, of which around 100 thousand were Jews and 30 to 80 thousand were Samaritans, with the remainder being Chalcedonian and Miaphysite Christians. Arabs came to constitute a ruling minority in Palestine who despised farming and kept their nomadic lifestyle, with the tribes of Lakhm, Judham, Kinana, Khath&#x27;am, Khuza&#x27;a, and Azd Sarat forming the army of Jund Filastin (military district of Palestine).

The pace of conversion to Islam among the various Christian, Jewish, and Samaritan communities in Palestine varied during the early period (638–1098), and opinions vary regarding the extent of Islamization during the early Islamic period. Some argue Palestine was already majority Muslim by the time of arrival of the First Crusade, while others contend that Christians were still in the majority and the process of mass adoption of Islam took place only from the 13th century onwards, during the Mamluk period. 

According to archaeologist Gideon Avni, archaeological surveys show that most Christian settlements and sites preserved their identity up to the crusader period, supplemented by the numerosity of churches and monasteries all over Palestine. The early Muslim population, on the other hand, was confined to the Umayyad palaces in the Jordan Valley and around the Sea of Galilee, the ribat fortresses along the coast and the farms of the Naqab desert. Thus, conversion to Islam only gained real momentum in Palestine after Saladin&#x27;s conquest of Jerusalem in 1187 and the expulsion of Franks. Arabic gradually replaced Palestinian Aramaic and largely by the 9th century, while Islamization was only finalized in the Mamluk period. 

Urban centers continued to flourish after the Islamic conquest, but changes took place in the 9th and 10th centuries. According to Ellenblum, climate disasters and earthquakes in the late 10th &amp; 11th centuries created internal chaos and famines throughout the Middle East, as well as population decline. Michael Ehrlich argues that the decline in urban centers likely caused local ecclesiastical administrations to weaken or disappear altogether, leaving Christians most susceptible to conversion. When certain urban centers collapsed, surrounding communities would have converted to Islam. Per Ellenblum, the eastern Galilee and central Samaria, where Jews and Samaritans were concentrated respectively, were converted rather quickly and had a Muslim or Jewish-Muslim majority by the crusader period. In Samaria, the sedentarization of nomadic tribes that penetrated Samaria was complemented by the mass conversion of the Samaritan population starting from the Tulunid period (884–905). By the 12th century, central Samaria was the only fully Islamized region in Palestine, while Christians predominated in southern Samaria, the Sinjil-Jerusalem area, the western Galilee and the Hebron Hills, which only converted in later periods. The introduction of Islam in the Hebron hills is archaeologically attested in Jewish villages but not Christian ones, mainly in Susya and Eshtemoa, where the local synagogues were repurposed as mosques.

Coastal cities such as Ramla and Ascalon thrived under the Fatimids (969–1099), where many Shiite scholars sought refuge and Shiite shrines were built, and the hinterland of Ramla was predominantly Muslim when the crusaders conquered it. On the other hand, Sufis played an important role in the Islamization of the hinterland of Jerusalem, where they built many religious buildings during the Mamluk period, transforming the cultural landscape. According to Nimrod Luz, when a Sufi settled in a Christian village, the local population often converted to Islam. According to Reuven Atimal, conversion to Islam appears to have halted and apparently even been reversed under the Kingdom of Jerusalem (1099–1291). With the advent of the Ayyubids (1187–1260) and then the consequent Mamluk takeover (1260–1517), it appears that the process of religious conversion to Islam was accelerated. By the start of the Ottoman period in 1516, it is commonly thought that the Muslim majority in the country was more-or-less like that of the mid-19th century. Conversion among the Samaritan families of Nablus to Islam continued well into the 19th century.

==Ottoman period==

=== Early Ottoman period ===
During the first century of the Ottoman rule, i.e., 1550, Bernard Lewis in a study of Ottoman registers of the early Ottoman Rule of Palestine reports a population of around 300,000:
From the mass of detail in the registers, it is possible to extract something like a general picture of the economic life of the country in that period. Out of a total population of about 300,000 souls, between a fifth and a quarter lived in the six towns of Jerusalem, Gaza, Safed, Nablus, Ramle, and Hebron. The remainder consisted mainly of peasants (fellahin), living in villages of varying size, and engaged in agriculture. Their main food-crops were wheat and barley in that order, supplemented by leguminous pulses, olives, fruit, and vegetables. In and around most of the towns there was a considerable number of vineyards, orchards, and vegetable gardens.
According to Justin McCarthy, the population of Palestine throughout the 17th and 18th centuries (1601–1801) was likely not much smaller than when it in 1850 (~340,000), after which it started to increase.

=== Late Ottoman period ===

In the late nineteenth century, prior to the rise of Zionism, Jews are thought to have comprised between 2% and 5% of the population of Palestine, although the precise population is not known. Jewish immigration had begun following the 1839 Tanzimat reforms; between 1840 and 1880, the Jewish population of Palestine rose from 9,000 to 23,000.

According to Alexander Scholch, Palestine in 1850 had about 350,000 inhabitants, 30% of whom lived in 13 towns; roughly 85% were Muslims, 11% were Christians and 4% Jews.

The Ottoman census of 1878 indicated the following demographics for the three districts that best approximated what later became Mandatory Palestine; that is, the Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem, the Nablus Sanjak, and the Acre Sanjak. In addition, some scholars estimate approximately 5,000-10,000 additional foreign-born Jews at this time:
According to Ottoman statistics studied by Justin McCarthy, the population of Palestine in the early 19th century was 350,000, in 1860 it was 411,000 and in 1900 about 600,000 of which 94% were Arabs.

The estimated 24,000 Jews in Palestine in 1882 represented just 0.3% of the world&#x27;s Jewish population.

1914 Ottoman census listed the following population figures:

Per McCarthy&#x27;s estimate, in 1914 Palestine had a population of 657,000 Muslim Arabs, 81,000 Christian Arabs, and 59,000 Jews. McCarthy estimates the non-Jewish population of Palestine at 452,789 in 1882, 737,389 in 1914, 725,507 in 1922, 880,746 in 1931 and 1,339,763 in 1946.

Based on the work of Roberto Bachi, Sergio Della Pergola estimated that Palestine&#x27;s population in 1914 was 689,000, comprising 525,000 Muslims, 94,000 Jews, and 70,000 Christians.

According to another estimate, the Jewish population in 1914 was 85,000 and subsequently fell to 56,000 in 1916–1919 as a result of World War I. During the war, the Ottoman authorities deported many Jews with foreign citizenship, while others left after they were presented with a choice of taking Ottoman citizenship or leaving Palestine. By December 1915 about 14% of the Jewish population had left, mainly for Egypt, where they awaited the war&#x27;s end so they could return to Palestine.

According to Dr. Mutaz M. Qafisheh, the number of people who held Ottoman citizenship prior to the British Mandate in 1922 was just over 729,873, of which 7,143 were Jews. Qafisheh calculated this using population and immigration statistics from the 1946 Survey of Palestine, as well as the fact that 37,997 people acquired provisional Palestinian naturalization certificates in September 1922 for the purpose of voting in the legislative election, of which all but 100 were Jews. The 1922 census of Palestine lists 3,210 Christians as members of Armenian churches, 271 being Armenian Catholic (176 in Jerusalem-Jaffa, 10 in Samaria, and 85 in Northern) and 2,939 being Armenian Apostolic (11 in Southern, 2,800 in Jerusalem-Jaffa, eight in Samaria, and 120 in Northern) along with 2,970 Armenian speakers, including 2,906 in municipal areas (2,442 in Jerusalem, 216 in Jaffa, 101 in Haifa, four in Gaza, 13 in Nablus, one in Safad, 20 in Nazareth, 13 in Ramleh, one in Tiberias, 37 in Bethlehem, 25 in Acre, four in Tulkarem, 21 in Ramallah, six in Jenin, one in Beersheba, and one in Baisan).

==British Mandate era==

===Official reports===
In 1920, the British Government&#x27;s &quot;Interim Report on the Civil Administration of Palestine&quot; stated that there were hardly 700,000 people living in Palestine:

There are now in the whole of Palestine hardly 700,000 people, a population much less than that of the province of Gallilee alone in the time of Christ. Of these 235,000 live in the larger towns, 465,000 in the smaller towns and villages. Four-fifths of the whole population are Moslems. A small proportion of these are Bedouin Arabs; the remainder, although they speak Arabic and are termed Arabs, are largely of mixed race. Some 77,000 of the population are Christians, in large majority belonging to the Orthodox Church, and speaking Arabic. The minority are members of the Latin or of the Uniate Greek Catholic Church, or—a small number—are Protestants.

The Jewish element of the population numbers 76,000. Almost all have entered Palestine during the last 40 years. Prior to 1850 there were in the country only a handful of Jews. In the following 30 years a few hundreds came to Palestine. Most of them were animated by religious motives; they came to pray and to die in the Holy Land, and to be buried in its soil. After the persecutions in Russia forty years ago, the movement of the Jews to Palestine assumed larger proportions. Jewish agricultural colonies were founded. They developed the culture of oranges and gave importance to the Jaffa orange trade. They cultivated the vine, and manufactured and exported wine. They drained swamps. They planted eucalyptus trees. They practised, with modern methods, all the processes of agriculture. There are at the present time 64 of these settlements, large and small, with a population of some 15,000.

By 1948, the population had risen to 1,900,000, of whom 68% were Arabs, and 32% were Jews (UNSCOP report, including Bedouin).

Report and general abstract of the Jewish agriculture was taken by the Palestine Zionist Executive in April 1927.

 Object of the Census:

(p 85) Demography: to enumerate all Jewish inhabitants living in the agricultural and semi-agricultural communities.

(p 86) Number of Settlements: 130 places have been enumerated. If we consider the large settlements and the adjacent territories as one geographical unit, then we may group these places into 101 agricultural settlements, 3 semi-agricultural places (Affule, Shekhunath Borukhov and Neve Yaaqov) and 12 farms scattered throughout the country. In addition, there were a few places which, owing to technical difficulties, were not enumerated in the month of April. (Peqiin, Meiron, Mizpa and Zikhron David, numbering in the aggregate 100 persons).

Of these agricultural settlements, 32 are located in Judea, 12 in the Plain of Sharon, 32 are located in the Plain of Jesreel, 16 in Lower Galilee, and 9 in Upper Galilee. Most of them have a very small population – about one half being inhabited by less than 100 persons each. In 42 settlements there are from 100 to 500 persons, and in only five does the population exceed 1.000. viz.

(p 86) Number of Inhabitants: The aggregate population living in the agricultural and semi-agricultural places were 30.500.
 
;Length of Residence in Palestine

(p 87 &amp; p 98) The pre-war population accounts for 9,473 persons, which is slightly less than one-third of the present population, whereas the rest are post-war immigrants. Some 10.000 persons settled since 1924, since the so-called middle-class immigration.


==Late Arab and Muslim immigration to Palestine==
===Ottoman period, 1800–1918===
At the end of the 18th century, there was a bi-directional movement between Egypt and Palestine. Between 1829 and 1841, thousands of Egyptian &quot;fellahin&quot; (peasants) arrived in Palestine fleeing Muhammad Ali Pasha&#x27;s conscription, which he reasoned as the casus belli to invade Palestine in October 1831, ostensibly to repatriate the Egyptian fugitives. Egyptian forced labourers, mostly from the Nile Delta, were brought in by Muhammad Ali and settled in &quot;sakināt&quot; (neighborhoods) along the coast for agriculture, which set off bad blood with the indigenous &quot;fellahin&quot;, who resented Muhammad Ali&#x27;s plans and interference, prompting the wide-scale Peasants&#x27; revolt in Palestine in 1834. After Egyptian defeat and retreat in 1841, many laborers and deserters stayed in Palestine. Most of these settled and were quickly assimilated in the cities of Jaffa and Gaza, the Coastal plains and Wadi Ara. Estimates of Egyptian migrants during this period generally place them at 15,000–30,000. At the time, the sedentary population of Palestine fluctuated around 350,000. Palestine experienced a few waves of immigration of Muslims from the lands lost by the Ottoman Empire in the 19th century. Algerians, Circassians and Bosniaks were mostly settled on vacant land and unlike the Egyptians they did not alter the geography of settlement significantly.

The Naqab desert further south preserved its Bedouin population, who had reportedly lived in the area since the 7th century. Many Bedouin tribes moved from the Hejaz and Transjordan in the 14th and 15th centuries. According to the 1922 census of Palestine, &quot;The Ottoman authorities in 1914 placed the tribal population of Beersheba at 55,000, and since that date there has been a migration of tribes from the Hejaz and Southern Transjordan into the Beersheba area mainly as a result of succession of adequate rainfalls and of pressure exerted by other tribes east of the River Jordan.&quot; For 1922, the census gives a figure of 74,910 including 72,998 in the tribal areas.

Demographer Uziel Schmelz, in his analysis of Ottoman registration data for 1905 populations of Jerusalem and Hebron &quot;kazas&quot;, found that most Ottoman citizens living in these areas, comprising about one quarter of the population of Palestine, were living at the place where they were born. Specifically, of Muslims, 93.1% were born in their current locality of residence, 5.2% were born elsewhere in Palestine, and 1.6% were born outside Palestine. Of Christians, 93.4% were born in their current locality, 3.0% were born elsewhere in Palestine, and 3.6% were born outside Palestine. Of Jews (excluding the large fraction who were not Ottoman citizens), 59.0% were born in their current locality, 1.9% were born elsewhere in Palestine, and 39.0% were born outside Palestine.

===British Mandate period, 1919–1948===
According to Roberto Bachi, head of the Israeli Institute of Statistics from 1949 onwards, between 1922 and 1945 there was a net Arab migration into Palestine of between 40,000 and 42,000, excluding 9,700 people who were incorporated after territorial adjustments were made to the borders in the 1920s. Based on these figures, and including those netted by the border alterations, Joseph Melzer calculates an upper boundary of 8.5% for Arab growth in the two decades, and interprets it to mean the local Palestinian community&#x27;s growth was generated primarily by natural increase in birth rates, for both Muslims and Christians.

According to a Jewish Agency survey, 77% of Palestinian population growth in Palestine between 1914 and 1938, during which the Palestinian population doubled, was due to natural increase, while 23% was due to immigration. Arab immigration was primarily from Lebanon, Syria, Transjordan, and Egypt (all countries that bordered Palestine).

The overall assessment of several British reports was that the increase in the Arab population was primarily due to natural increase. These included the Hope Simpson Enquiry (1930), the Passfield White Paper (1930), the Peel Commission report (1937), and the Survey of Palestine (1945). However, the Hope Simpson Enquiry did note that there was significant illegal immigration from the surrounding Arab territories, while the Peel Commission and Survey of Palestine claimed that immigration played only a minor role in the growth of the Arab population. The 1931 census of Palestine considered the question of illegal immigration since the previous census in 1922. It estimated that unrecorded immigration during that period may have amounted to 9,000 Jews and 4,000 Arabs. It also gave the proportion of persons living in Palestine in 1931 who were born outside Palestine: Muslims, 2%; Christians, 20%; Jews, 58%. The statistical information for Arab immigration (and expulsions when the clandestine migrants were caught), with a contrast to the figures for Jewish immigration over the same period of 1936–1939, is given by Henry Laurens in the following terms 
::::::::Palestinian immigration, 1936–1939
::::::::Expulsions of illegals, 1937–1938

According to Mark Tessler, at least some of the Arab population growth was the result of immigration, mostly from the Sinai, Lebanon, Syria, and Transjordan, stimulated by the relatively favorable economic conditions in Palestine, but he noted differing opinions among scholars over how substantial it was. He cited one study as putting the Arab population growth attributable to immigration between 1922 and 1931 at 7%, meaning that 4% of the Arab population in 1931 was foreign-born, while noting another estimate put the growth in the Arab population attributable to immigration at 38.7%, which would mean that 11.8% of the Arab population in 1931 was foreign-born. Tessler wrote that &quot;Israeli as well as Palestinian scholars have disputed this assertion, however, concluding that it is at best a theory and in all probability a myth.&quot;
In a 1974 study, demographer Roberto Bachi estimated that about 900 Muslims per year were detected as illegal immigrants but not deported. He noted the impossibility of estimating illegal immigration that was undetected, or the fraction of those persons who eventually departed. He did note that there was an unexplained increase in the Muslim population between 1922 and 1931, and he did suggest, though qualifying it as a &quot;mere guess&quot;, that this was due to a combination of unrecorded immigration (using the 1931 census report estimate) and undercounting in the 1922 census.

While noting the uncertainty of earlier data, Bachi also observed that the Muslim population growth in the 19th century appeared to be high by world standards:

&quot;[B]etween 1800 and 1914, the Muslim population had a yearly average increase of an order of magnitude of roughly 6–7 per thousand. This can be compared to the very crude estimate of about 4 per thousand for the &quot;less developed countries&quot; of the world (in Asia, Africa, and Latin America) between 1800 and 1910. It is possible that some part of the growth of the Muslim population was due to immigration. However, it seems likely that the dominant determinant of this modest growth was the beginning of some natural increase.&quot;
According to Justin McCarthy, &quot;... evidence for Muslim immigration into Palestine is minimal. Because no Ottoman records of that immigration have yet been discovered, one is thrown back on demographic analysis to evaluate Muslim migration.&quot; McCarthy argues that there is no significant Arab immigration into mandatory Palestine:

From analyses of rates of increase of the Muslim population of the three Palestinian sanjaks, one can say with certainty that Muslim immigration after the 1870s was small. Had there been a large group of Muslim immigrants their numbers would have caused an unusual increase in the population and this would have appeared in the calculated rate of increase from one registration list to another... Such an increase would have been easily noticed; it was not there.
The argument that Arab immigration somehow made up a large part of the Palestinian Arab population is thus statistically untenable. The vast majority of the Palestinian Arabs resident in 1947 were the sons and daughters of Arabs who were living in Palestine before modern Jewish immigration began. There is no reason to believe that they were not the sons and daughters of Arabs who had been in Palestine for many centuries.

McCarthy also concludes that there was no significant internal migration to Jewish areas attributable to better economic conditions:

Some areas of Palestine did experience greater population growth than others, but the explanation for this is simple. Radical economic change was occurring all over the Mediterranean Basin at the time. Improved transportation, greater mercantile activity, and greater industry had increased the chances for employment in cities, especially coastal cities... Differential population increase was occurring all over the Eastern Mediterranean, not just in Palestine... The increase in Muslim population had little or nothing to do with Jewish immigration. In fact the province that experienced the greatest Jewish population growth (by .035 annually), Jerusalem Sanjak, was the province with the lowest rate of growth of Muslim population (.009).
Fred M. Gottheil has questioned McCarthy&#x27;s estimates of immigration. Gottheil says that McCarthy didn&#x27;t give proper weight to the importance of economic incentives at the time, and that McCarthy cites Roberto Bachi&#x27;s estimates as conclusive numbers, rather than lower bounds based on detected illegal immigration.

Gad Gilbar has also concluded that the prosperity of Palestine in the 45–50 years before World War I was a result of the modernization and growth of the economy owing to its integration with the world economy and especially with the economies of Europe. Although the reasons for growth were exogenous to Palestine the bearers were not waves of Jewish immigration, foreign intervention nor Ottoman reforms but &quot;primarily local Arab Muslims and Christians.&quot; However, Gilbar did attribute the rapid growth of Jaffa and Haifa in the final three decades of Ottoman rule in part to migration, writing that &quot;both attracted population from the rural and urban surroundings and immigrants from outside Palestine.&quot;

Yehoshua Porath believes that the notion of &quot;large-scale immigration of Arabs from the neighboring countries&quot; is a myth &quot;proposed by Zionist writers&quot;. He writes:

As all the research by historian Fares Abdul Rahim and geographers of modern Palestine shows, the Arab population began to grow again in the middle of the nineteenth century. That growth resulted from a new factor: the demographic revolution. Until the 1850s there was no &quot;natural&quot; increase of the population, but this began to change when modern medical treatment was introduced and modern hospitals were established, both by the Ottoman authorities and by the foreign Christian missionaries. The number of births remained steady but infant mortality decreased. This was the main reason for Arab population growth. ... No one would doubt that some migrant workers came to Palestine from Syria and Trans-Jordan and remained there. But one has to add to this that there were migrations in the opposite direction as well. For example, a tradition developed in Hebron to go to study and work in Cairo, with the result that a permanent community of Hebronites had been living in Cairo since the fifteenth century. Trans-Jordan exported unskilled casual labor to Palestine; but before 1948 its civil service attracted a good many educated Palestinian Arabs who did not find work in Palestine itself. Demographically speaking, however, neither movement of population was significant in comparison to the decisive factor of natural increase.
==Modern era==
, Israeli and Palestinian statistics for the overall numbers of Jews and Arabs in the area west of the Jordan, inclusive of Israel and the Palestinian territories, are similar and suggest a rough parity in the two populations. Palestinian statistics estimate 6.1 million Palestinians for that area, while Israel&#x27;s Central Bureau of Statistics estimates 6.2 million Jews living in sovereign Israel. Gaza is estimated by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) to have 1.7 million, and the West Bank 2.8 million Palestinians, while Israel proper has 1.7 million Arab citizens. According to Israel&#x27;s Central Bureau of Statistics, as of May 2006, of Israel&#x27;s 7 million people, 77% were Jews, 18.5% Arabs, and 4.3% &quot;others&quot;. Among Jews, 68% were Sabras (Israeli-born), mostly second- or third-generation Israelis, and the rest are olim – 22% from Europe and the Americas, and 10% from Asia and Africa, including the Arab countries.

According to these Israeli and Palestinian estimates, the population in Israel and the Palestinian territories stands at from 6.1 to 6.2 million Palestinians and 6.1 million Jews. According to Sergio DellaPergola, if foreign workers and non-Jewish Russian immigrants in Israel are subtracted, Jews are already a minority in the land between the river and the sea. DellaPergola calculates that Palestinians as of January 2014 number 5.7 million as opposed to a &quot;core Jewish population&quot; of 6.1 million.

The Palestinian statistics are contested by some right-wing Israeli think-tanks and non-demographers such as Yoram Ettinger, who claim they overestimate Palestinian numbers by double-counting and counting Palestinians who live abroad. The double-counting argument is dismissed by both Arnon Soffer, Ian Lustick and DellaPergola, the latter dismissing Ettinger&#x27;s calculations as &#x27;delusional&#x27; or manipulated for ignoring the birth-rate differentials between the two populations (3 children per Jewish mother vs 3.4 for Palestinians generally, and 4.1 in the Gaza Strip). DellaPergola allows, however, for an inflation in the Palestinian statistics due to the counting of Palestinians who are abroad, a discrepancy of some 380,000 individuals.

===Demographics of the State of Israel===

The latest Israeli census was conducted by Israel Central Bureau of Statistics in 2019. Israeli census excludes the Gaza Strip. It also excludes all West Bank Palestinian localities, including those in Area C, while it includes the annexed East Jerusalem. It also includes all Israeli settlements in the West Bank. The census also includes the occupied Syrian territory of Golan Heights.

As per this census, the total population in 2019 was 9,140,473. Israeli population consists of 7,221,442 &quot;Jews and others&quot;, and 1,919,031 Arabs, almost all of which Palestinians, with 26,261 in Golan Subdistrict, being Syrian, mostly Druze, and a small number Alawite. The population includes the Druze community of Israel (i.e. not Syrian Druze) as well, who generally self-identify as Israeli, and are the only Arab-speaking community that has mandatory military service in the IDF.

===Demographics of the State of Palestine===

The latest Palestinian Census was conducted by Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics in 2017. The Palestinian census covers the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. The Palestinian census does not cover Israeli settlements in the West Bank including those in East Jerusalem. The census does not provide any ethnic or religious distinction. However, it is reasonable to assume that almost everyone counted is Palestinian Arab.

As per this census, the total population of the Palestinian territories was 4,780,978. The West Bank had a population of 2,881,687, whereas the Gaza Strip had a population of 1,899,291.

<text>A prolactinoma is a tumor (adenoma) of the pituitary gland that produces the hormone prolactin. It is the most common type of functioning pituitary tumor. Symptoms of prolactinoma are due to abnormally high levels of prolactin in the blood (hyperprolactinemia), or due to pressure of the tumor on surrounding brain tissue and/or the optic nerves. Based on its size, a prolactinoma may be classified as a microprolactinoma (&lt;10mm diameter) or a macroprolactinoma (&gt;10mm diameter).

== Signs and symptoms ==

The most common symptoms at the time of diagnosis often differ between males and females. Women tend to experience more symptoms related directly to prolactin levels, such as amenorrhea and galactorrhea. By contrast, men frequently exhibit fertility issues and hormonal disruptions, such as a loss of libido, but are also more likely to show signs of the tumor compressing their brain tissue, such as headaches, vision changes, and other symptoms outlined below.

The symptoms due to a prolactinoma are broadly divided into those that are caused by increased prolactin levels or mass effect. Those that are caused by increased prolactin levels are:
* amenorrhea (disappearance of ovulation periods)
* galactorrhea (breastmilk production; infrequent in men)
* loss of axillary and pubic hair
* hypogonadism (reduced function of the gonads)
* gynecomastia (an increase in male breast size)
* erectile dysfunction (in males)

Those that are caused by mass effect are:
* headaches
* vision changes (visual field deficits, blurred vision, decreased visual acuity)
* cranial nerve palsies, especially with invasive tumors or with pituitary apoplexy
* seizures, Hydrocephalus, Unilateral exophthalmos are rare presentations
* hypopituitarism 
* pituitary apoplexy is a medical emergency because of spontaneous hemorrhage into the pituitary tumor and presents with severe headaches, vision changes, and acute panhypopituitarism.

=== Infertility ===
A prolactinoma can cause infertility, temporary or permanent, in both male and female patients. It is one of the most common causes of infertility in women, with some sources estimating as much as 20% of female infertility being caused by hyperprolactinemia. It represents a smaller proportion of male infertility. However, among people who have prolactinomas, males are more likely to experience infertility, as their tumors are often more aggressive and more frequently cause hypogonadism.

== Causes ==
Prolactinoma is most frequently a sporadic tumor, occurring in people without any concrete risk factors or family members with similar conditions. In a minority of cases, genetics predispose the patient to having one or more pituitary gland tumors during their lifetime. Most cases of prolactinoma have no known causes or risk factors.

=== Pathogenesis ===
Though most pituitary tumors are sporadic, some genetic syndromes include increased risk for pituitary adenomas including Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (caused by a mutation in the MEN1 gene), multiple endocrine neoplasia type 4 (MEN4 gene), Carney complex, and Familial isolated pituitary adenoma (FIPA). Despite their frequent association with genetic syndromes that cause multiple cancers in affected body tissues, the large majority of prolactinomas are monoclonal in origin (originating from a single cell developing a random mutation), even in cases where the tumor begins producing multiple distinct hormones aside from prolactin.

A &quot;micro&quot;-prolactinoma usually does not grow to become a &quot;macro&quot;-prolactinoma, and also does not often become metastatic. As such, it is considered a benign tumor, even if it causes symptoms due to excess prolactin. However, it is still recommended that patients with known microprolactinomas should receive an MRI and visual field assessment every 6 to 12 months, to detect unexpected progression and expansion of the tumor before it becomes an emergency.

==== Splicing factor 3B1 ====
Among cases of sporadic prolactinoma, in patients with no family history of pituitary tumors, the splicing factor 3B1 gene (SF3B1) has been found as a common causative mutation. This mutation, most commonly a missense mutation replacing a single amino acid, has also been identified in some familial cases of prolactinoma. However, it is more commonly a somatic mutation, occurring later in life in someone who was not born with the mutated gene. This gene is responsible for splicing a wide variety of RNA products inside the cell, and a mutation of it can thus cause the creation of numerous abnormal proteins as RNA templates are produced in unpredictable ways.

Sporadic cases of prolactinoma which are &quot;not&quot; related to a mutation of SF3B1 remain poorly understood. However, many studies show a link between estrogen and prolactinoma. This is theorized to be related to why prolactinomas are more common in women than men.

==== Vision problems and headaches ====
While headaches are a symptom common to any tumor within the cranium, vision problems are especially frequent in pituitary adenomas because the pituitary gland rests over the optic chiasm. As the tumor grows, it begins to compress one or both optic nerves, depending on the size and direction of growth. This is an example of mass effect. As such, smaller tumors which may produce excess prolactin or other hormones may not cause any vision problems, while still having major symptomatic effects on the body.

===== Other causes of elevated prolactin =====
The majority of moderately raised prolactin levels (up to 5000 mIU/L) are not due to microprolactinomas but other causes. The effects of some prescription drugs are the most common. Other causes are other pituitary tumours and normal pregnancy and breastfeeding.

== Diagnosis ==
Prolactinoma is often one of the first diagnoses considered by a physician when a patient presents with symptoms of hyperprolactinemia. Specifically, the presence of several of these symptoms in the same person are indicative of elevated prolactin:

* Galactorrhea
* Amenorrhea (in women)
* Erectile dysfunction (in men)
* Infertility
* Diminished libido
* Weight gain

If these symptoms occur with the simultaneous presence of mass effects, particularly vision problems or severe neurological symptoms such as seizures or coma, aggressive prolactinoma is highly likely. A patient with these symptoms should immediately undergo MRI to assess the size and extent of the tumor. MRI is also useful in patients with smaller tumors, as it can be used to monitor the tumor for signs of growth, allowing a surgical intervention to be performed before it becomes a medical emergency.

=== Imaging ===
All patients with hyperprolactinemia should receive MRI imaging to determine the size and characteristics of the tumor. Prolactinomas have somewhat variable appearance on MRI, most commonly appearing hypointense on T1 weighted MRI, and heterogenous or hyperintense on T2 weighted MRI. If MRI is not available, other imaging techniques may be used if they can examine the region around the sella turcica in sufficient detail. Identification of pituitary tumor on MRI, with accompanying symptoms, is considered a definitive diagnosis of prolactinoma.

Unlike macroprolactinomas which compress the optic nerves, microprolactinomas are usually not large enough to be seen on MRI. However, the addition of gadolinium contrast enhancement can make them much easier to detect. Thus, evaluation of a suspected prolactinoma usually uses this form of contrast enhancement. Notably, this contrast can also visualize a pituitary gland with no disease at all, so precise measurement of the gland&#x27;s size and shape is essential.

=== Biochemical testing ===
Elevated prolactin levels in the patient&#x27;s serum are indicative of hyperprolactinemia, but are not specific to prolactinoma, meaning that other diseases causing similar symptoms could produce the same test results. Similarly, tests that use dopamine agonists to suppress prolactin production are not able to rule out other diagnoses. As a result, biochemical testing is used only in a supplementary role, and MRI is the only definitive diagnostic tool available. Dopamine agonist testing can, however, be used to determine the effectiveness of DAs like bromocriptine as a potential non-surgical treatment option.

== Treatments ==
The goal of treatment is to return prolactin secretion to normal, reduce tumor size, correct any visual abnormalities, and restore normal pituitary function. The impact of stress should be ruled out before the diagnosis of prolactinoma is given. Exercise can significantly reduce stress and, thereby, prolactin levels. In the case of very large tumors, only partial reduction of the prolactin levels may be possible.

=== Medications ===
Dopamine is the chemical that normally inhibits prolactin secretion, so clinicians may treat prolactinoma with drugs that act like dopamine such as bromocriptine and cabergoline. This type of drug is called a dopamine agonist. These drugs shrink the tumor and return prolactin levels to normal in approximately 80% of patients. Both bromocriptine and cabergoline have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of hyperprolactinemia. Bromocriptine is associated with side-effects such as nausea and dizziness and hypotension in patients with already low blood pressure readings. To avoid these side-effects, it is important for bromocriptine treatment to start slowly.

Bromocriptine treatment should not be interrupted without consulting a qualified endocrinologist. Prolactin levels often rise again in most people when the drug is discontinued. In some, however, prolactin levels remain normal, so the doctor may suggest reducing or discontinuing treatment every two years on a trial basis. Recent studies have shown increased success in remission of prolactin levels after discontinuation, in patients having been treated for at least 2 years prior to cessation of bromocriptine treatment.

Cabergoline is also associated with side effects such as nausea and dizziness, but these may be less common and less severe than with bromocriptine. However, people with low blood pressure should use caution when starting cabergoline treatment, as the long half-life of the drug (4–7 days) may inadvertently affect their ability to keep their blood pressure within normal limits, creating intense discomfort, dizziness, and even fainting upon standing and walking until the single first dose clears from their system. As with bromocriptine therapy, side effects may be avoided or minimized if treatment is started slowly. If a patient&#x27;s prolactin level remains normal for 6 months, a doctor may consider stopping treatment. Cabergoline should not be interrupted without consulting a qualified endocrinologist.

Other dopamine agonists that have been used less commonly to suppress prolactin include dihydroergocryptine, ergoloid, lisuride, metergoline, pergolide, quinagolide, and terguride.

=== Surgery ===
Surgery should be considered if medical therapy cannot be tolerated or if it fails to reduce prolactin levels, restore normal reproduction and pituitary function, and reduce tumor size. If medical therapy is only partially successful, this therapy should continue, possibly combined with surgery or radiation treatment.

The results of surgery depend a great deal on tumor size and prolactin level. The higher the prolactin level the lower the chance of normalizing serum prolactin. In the best medical centers, surgery corrects prolactin levels in 80% of patients with a serum prolactin less than 250 ng/ml. Even in patients with large tumors that cannot be completely removed, drug therapy may be able to return serum prolactin to the normal range after surgery. Depending on the size of the tumor and how much of it is removed, studies show that 20 to 50% will recur, usually within five years.

== Prognosis ==
People with microprolactinoma generally have an excellent prognosis. In 95% of cases, the tumor will not show any signs of growth after a 4 to 6-year period.

Macroprolactinomas often require more aggressive treatment otherwise they may continue to grow. There is no way to reliably predict the rate of growth, as it is different for every individual. Regular monitoring by a specialist to detect any major changes in the tumor is recommended.

=== Osteoporosis risk ===
Hyperprolactinemia can cause reduced estrogen production in women and reduced testosterone production in men. Although estrogen/testosterone production may be restored after treatment for hyperprolactinemia, even a year or two without estrogen/testosterone can compromise bone strength, and patients should protect themselves from osteoporosis by increasing exercise and calcium intake through diet or supplementation, and by avoiding smoking. Patients may want to have bone density measurements to assess the effect of estrogen/testosterone deficiency on bone density. They may also want to discuss testosterone/estrogen replacement therapy with their physician.

=== Pregnancy and oral birth control ===
If a woman has one or more small prolactinoma, there is no reason that she cannot conceive and have a normal pregnancy after successful medical therapy. The pituitary enlarges and prolactin production increases during normal pregnancy in women without pituitary disorders. Women with prolactin-secreting tumors may experience further pituitary enlargement and must be closely monitored during pregnancy. However, damage to the pituitary or eye nerves occurs in less than one percent of pregnant women with prolactinoma. In women with large tumors, the risk of damage to the pituitary or eye nerves is greater, and some doctors consider it as high as 25%. If a woman has completed a successful pregnancy, the chances of her completing further successful pregnancies are extremely high.

A woman with a prolactinoma should discuss her plans to conceive with her physician, so she can be carefully evaluated prior to becoming pregnant. This evaluation will include a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan to assess the size of the tumor and an eye examination with measurement of visual fields. As soon as a patient is pregnant, her doctor will usually advise that she stop taking bromocriptine or cabergoline, the common treatments for prolactinoma. Most endocrinologists see patients every two months throughout the pregnancy. The patient should consult her endocrinologist promptly if she develops symptoms — in particular, headaches, visual changes, nausea, vomiting, excessive thirst or urination, or extreme lethargy. Bromocriptine or cabergoline treatment may be renewed and additional treatment may be required if the patient develops symptoms from growth of the tumor during pregnancy.

At one time, oral contraceptives were thought to contribute to the development of prolactinomas. However, this is no longer thought to be true. Patients with prolactinoma treated with bromocriptine or cabergoline may also take oral contraceptives. Likewise, post-menopausal estrogen replacement is safe in patients with prolactinoma treated with medical therapy or surgery.

== Epidemiology ==
Autopsy studies indicate that 6-25% of the U. S. population have small pituitary tumors. Forty percent of these pituitary tumors produce prolactin, but most are not considered clinically significant. Clinically significant pituitary tumors affect the health of approximately 14 out of 100,000 people. In non-selective surgical series, this tumor accounts for approximately 25-30% of all pituitary adenomas. Some growth hormone (GH)–producing tumors also co-secrete prolactin. More than 90% of prolactinoma is microprolactinomas, which are much more common than macroprolactinomas.

<doc id="1021157" wikidata="Q683877" url="?curid=1021157" title="Tokyo Game Show">
<text>, commonly known as TGS, is a video game trade fair and convention held annually in September in the Makuhari Messe, in Chiba, Japan. It is presented by the Computer Entertainment Supplier&#x27;s Association (CESA) and Nikkei Business Publications, Inc. The main focus of the show is on Japanese games, but some international video game developers use it to showcase upcoming releases/related hardware. The duration of the event is four days. The first two days of Tokyo Game Show are open only to industry attendees (business) and the general public can attend during the final two days.

== History ==
The first Tokyo Game Show was held in 1996. From 1996 to 2002, the show was held twice a year: once in the Spring and once in Autumn (in the Tokyo Big Sight). Since 2002, the show has been held once a year. 2011’s show hosted over 200,000 attendees and the 2012 show bringing in 223,753. The busiest TGS was in 2016 with 271,224 people in attendance and 614 companies had exhibits. The event has been held annually since 1996 and was never canceled, however the 2020 and 2021 editions were online only as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2022 edition returned to in-person exhibits. The 20th anniversary of TGS was celebrated in 2016.
The 2016 attendance record was topped by 2018&#x27;s attendance of 298,690 people.

== Layout ==
The TGS layout varies per year. Such as in 2015, Tokyo Game Show showcased eleven exhibition areas consisting of business, general public, education and other areas to buy merchandise.

=== General Exhibition ===
The General Exhibition Area is the heart of the show, taking up the largest amount of space, and is held where digital gaming entertainment or any related products or services are showcased. Many well-known companies such as Bandai Namco Entertainment, Capcom, Sony Interactive Entertainment and Square Enix have demo areas here, in addition to emerging companies.

=== Game Device ===
This area covers gaming devices such as headphones, controllers, furniture and other devices associated with home-use gaming consoles and portable gaming devices.

=== Asia New Stars ===
An exhibition introduced at the 2012 Tokyo Game Show is geared towards introducing emerging game developers from Asia.

=== Merchandise Sales ===
This area is designated for merchandising of game-related goods. Vendors include Konami and Square-Enix.

=== Smartphone and social games ===
This area focuses on games for smart devices (smartphones and tablets) and social games. Despite record numbers during TGS 2012, many large companies had a smaller presence. For example, Microsoft, which previously had one of the largest booths, was absent in 2012. Social and mobile gaming surged, filling the gap. Microsoft returned to the show in 2013 with the release of the Xbox One.

=== Personal computing ===
The PC area houses major Japanese computing companies, showcasing products such as Japanese desktop and notebook computers.

=== Children ===
This area showcases new games that are aimed at a younger audience. Companies such as Taito and Sega are housed there.

=== Game school ===
The Game School area showcases information on Japanese universities and colleges offering information about digital art, animation, computer programming, and other programs of study related to the video game industry. These booths also display student work. It houses colleges such as Numazu Professional College of Information Technology and Tokyo Designer Gakuin College.

=== Sales ===
This is the main area in the games convention where most of the sales and business transactions between companies and consumers are carried out. Companies housed there include Nikkei Business Publications.

=== Cosplay ===
The Tokyo Game Show attracts many cosplayers. Cure, Japan&#x27;s largest cosplay community website, hosts Cosplay Collection Night, a parade in stage show with more than 100 cosplayers on Saturday&#x27;s night. The show starts from 6:30pm until 8 pm and it is hosted by Yunmao Ayakawa and Tatsumi Inui from the production team company CURE World Cosplay, with background music by DJ &amp; MC: WAN. The participants are members of Worldcosplay website with a few international cosplayers who won contests in countries like Spain, Philippines, South Korea, Singapore, Indonesia, Turkey, the US, and China and others.

=== Business solutions ===
This is the main business area and is not open to the public.

=== Cloud/data center pavilion ===
The Cloud/Data Center is dedicated to improving infrastructure and environment of social and network games.

===&quot;Street Fighter&quot; tournaments===
The Tokyo Game Show has featured a Mad Catz-sponsored &quot;Street Fighter&quot; tournament since 2014. The competition is part of Capcom&#x27;s official Pro Tour, making it a qualifying event for the Capcom Cup. The 2016 event was the first to not be sponsored by Mad Catz, as the company got in severe financial trouble during its 2016 fiscal year.

== Sense of Wonder Night ==
Sense of Wonder Night (SOWN) is a presentation session held yearly at the TGS for showcasing innovative and experimental computer games mainly made by small game studios and independent game developers from all over the world, similar to and inspired by the GDC Experimental Gameplay Workshop. The first edition was held in 2008. Among former and current judges are Keita Takahashi and Simon Carless.

<doc id="1021158" wikidata="Q553575" url="?curid=1021158" title="Fess Parker">
<text>Fess Elisha Parker Jr. (born F. E. Parker Jr.; August 16, 1924 – March 18, 2010) was an American film and television actor best known for his portrayals of the title characters in the Walt Disney television miniseries &quot;Davy Crockett&quot; (1954–55; ABC) and the television series &quot;Daniel Boone&quot; (1964–70; NBC).

==Early years==
Parker was born in Fort Worth, Texas, and raised on a farm in Tom Green County near San Angelo. His father – born Fess Parker but later added the initial &quot;E.&quot; – was a tax assessor. The name Fess had been given to him in honor of the educator and politician Simeon D. Fess. The future actor decided to change his name from F. E. Parker Jr. to Fess Elisha Parker Jr. He selected the middle name himself, when he was a teenager (about 1937), because it sounded rhythmic and matched his middle initial.

He enlisted in the U.S. Navy in the latter part of the Second World War, hoping to become a pilot. He was turned down because he was too tall at . He then tried to become a radioman gunner, but he was found too large to fit comfortably into the rear cockpit. He was finally transferred to the United States Marine Corps as a radio operator and shipped out to the South Pacific shortly before the war ended.

Discharged in 1946, he enrolled at Hardin–Simmons University in Abilene, Texas, with assistance from the GI Bill. After an automobile collision, he was stabbed in the neck by the other driver during an argument. He was an active member of the H-SU Players Club and transferred to the University of Texas at Austin in 1947 as a history major and continued to be active in drama. One of his roommates there was the future actor L.Q. Jones.
Parker graduated from UT in 1950 with a degree in history. He had been initiated into the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity. Having one year remaining on his GI Bill benefits, he studied drama at the University of Southern California, where he pursued a master&#x27;s degree in theater history.

==Career==
Parker began his show-business career in the summer of 1951 when he had a $32-a-week job as an extra in the play &quot;Mister Roberts&quot;, although he is credited with the voice of Leslie the chauffeur in the 1950 film &quot;Harvey&quot;.
Within months, he was on location with a minor part in &quot;Untamed Frontier&quot; with Joseph Cotten and Shelley Winters.

Parker became a contract player with Warner Bros., appearing in small roles in several films such as &quot;Springfield Rifle&quot; (1952), &quot;Island in the Sky&quot;, &quot;The Bounty Hunter&quot;, and &quot;Battle Cry&quot;. In 1954, he appeared as Grat Dalton in the Jim Davis syndicated Western &quot;Stories of the Century&quot; in the episode &quot;The Dalton Brothers&quot;.

===Davy Crockett===


James Arness was first considered for the role of Davy Crockett. Parker had recently graduated to being a contract weekly actor but listened to his agent and appeared in a Warner Bros. science fiction film about giant ants called &quot;Them!&quot;, which required only one day&#x27;s work. During the screening of this film, Walt Disney looked past Arness and discovered Parker. Disney was impressed by Parker&#x27;s portrayal of a man who was unswerving in his belief in what he saw despite the forces of authority against him. They asked him to drop by the Disney Studio. When he did, he brought his guitar, met Disney, sang a song, and then said goodbye. Several weeks later, Disney informed him that he had been selected over Arness and several others for the role.

Disney&#x27;s three-episode version of Crockett depicted his exploits as a frontiersman, congressman, and tragic hero of the Alamo. The episodes have been called the first television miniseries, though the term had not yet been coined. &quot;Davy Crockett&quot; (1954–55) was a tremendous hit and led to a merchandising frenzy for coonskin caps and more.

Parker became a contract star for Disney and appeared in &quot;The Great Locomotive Chase&quot;, &quot;Westward Ho, the Wagons!&quot;, &quot;Old Yeller&quot;, and &quot;The Light in the Forest&quot;. He complained that they were all basically the same role. Disney refused to lend Parker for roles outside that persona, such as Jeffrey Hunter&#x27;s role opposite John Wayne in &quot;The Searchers&quot; and Marilyn Monroe&#x27;s leading man in &quot;Bus Stop&quot;.

Parker was dissatisfied with Disney&#x27;s proposal to use him only in a small role in &quot;Tonka&quot;. He was put on suspension for refusing the role, and subsequently left Disney.

===Post Disney===
Parker made guest appearances on many television programs, and composed and sang. He performed the occasional role of Tom Conrad, editor of the &quot;Diablo Courier&quot; in the syndicated western series, &quot;Annie Oakley&quot; (1954–1957), starring Gail Davis, Brad Johnson, and Jimmy Hawkins.

Parker was contracted to Paramount Pictures from 1958 to 1962. He appeared in a small assortment of Paramount movies, including a cameo as an unnamed frontiersman in Bob Hope&#x27;s Western comedy &quot;Alias Jesse James&quot; and supporting roles in &quot;The Hangman&quot; (1959) with Robert Taylor, &quot;The Jayhawkers!&quot; (1959) with Jeff Chandler, and &quot;Hell Is for Heroes&quot; (1962) with Steve McQueen.

In 1962, he starred in the title role of the TV series &quot;Mr Smith Goes to Washington&quot;, portraying the same idealistic character that James Stewart had played in the 1939 film. Parker took to the stage in 1963, in a traveling production of &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; as Curly. The movie roles he sought were elusive. In 1966, Parker starred in the movie &quot;Smoky&quot;, directed by George Sherman where he played the role of Clint Barkley, who finds a black stallion named Smoky, a wild stallion who eventually becomes a wonderful cutting horse and the best friend an old cowboy could ever want.

===Daniel Boone===

Parker&#x27;s &quot;Daniel Boone&quot; television series portraying another historic figure of America&#x27;s frontier days began filming in 1964. Over its six years (1964 to 1970) as one of the highest-rated shows of its time, Parker was not only the star of the series, but also the co-producer and director of five of its most popular episodes.

Turning down the title role of &quot;McCloud&quot;, Parker retired from acting at the age of 49 after a sitcom pilot called &quot;The Fess Parker Show&quot; was broadcast on March 28, 1974, but was not subsequently picked up by the network.

==Awards==
Fess Parker was nominated for best new personality Emmy in 1954, but lost to George Gobel. He was never nominated again, nor was his show &quot;Daniel Boone&quot;.

In 1991, he was named a Disney Legend.

In 2003, Parker received the Texas Cultural Trust&#x27;s &quot;Texas Medal of Arts Award&quot;, established only the year before.

For his work with Disney, Parker was honored in December 2004 with his own tribute window on a façade in the Frontierland section of Disneyland.

==Business and politics==
Parker became interested in opening a Davy Crockett-themed amusement park. In the late 1960s, he optioned land in northern Kentucky at the intersection of Interstates 71 and 75, with the intention of building Frontier Worlds. However, when the Taft Broadcasting Company of Cincinnati, Ohio, began building Kings Island Amusement Park in nearby Mason, Ohio, less than a 2-hour drive from Parker&#x27;s site, financing for Parker&#x27;s venture dried up. Plans for the Frontier World park were eventually revitalized in Santa Clara, California and developed into California&#x27;s Great America.

===Fess Parker Winery===
After his acting career, Parker devoted much of his time to operating his Fess Parker Family Winery and Vineyards in Los Olivos, California. The winery is owned and operated by Parker&#x27;s family, and has produced several different types of award-winning wines. Parker&#x27;s son, Eli, is president and director of winemaking and vineyard operations, while daughter, Ashley, is vice president of marketing and sales.

The Parker operation includes over of vineyards, and a tasting room and visitor center along the Foxen Canyon Wine Trail. In addition to wine, the winery is known for selling coonskin caps and bottle toppers inspired by Parker&#x27;s Crockett and Boone characters, and for its appearance under another name in the movie &quot;Sideways&quot;. In reminiscence of his acting days, Parker&#x27;s wine labels have a logo of a golden coonskin cap.

===Politics===
In 1985, Parker briefly flirted with running in 1986 for the United States Senate as a Republican for the seat of incumbent Democrat Alan Cranston. He considered himself a conservative in the mold of Ronald Reagan.

==Personal life and death==
Parker married Marcella Belle Rinehart on January 18, 1960. They had two children, Fess Elisha Parker III and Ashley Allen Rinehart, along with 11 grandchildren and a great-grandson.

Parker died of natural causes on March 18, 2010, at his home in Santa Ynez, California, near the Fess Parker Winery. He is buried in the Santa Barbara Cemetery with a simple headstone, and a coonskin hat inscribed below his name.

<doc id="1021160" wikidata="Q1318384" url="?curid=1021160" title="Oligodendroglioma">
<text>Oligodendrogliomas are a type of glioma that are believed to originate from the oligodendrocytes of the brain or from a glial precursor cell. They occur primarily in adults (9.4% of all primary brain and central nervous system tumors) but are also found in children (4% of all primary brain tumors).

==Signs and symptoms==
Oligodendroglioma arise mainly in the frontal lobe and in 50–80% of cases, the first symptom is the onset of seizure activity, without having any symptoms beforehand. Headaches combined with increased intracranial pressure are also a common symptom of oligodendroglioma. Depending on the location of the tumor, many different neurological and neuropsychological deficits can be induced, including, but not limited to, visual loss, motor weakness, cognitive decline, and anxiety. A computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan is necessary to characterize tumor size, location, and hetero- or homogeneity. Final diagnosis relies on biopsy and histopathologic examination of the tumor mass.

==Cause==
The cause of oligodendrogliomas is unknown. Some studies have linked oligodendroglioma with a viral cause. A 2009 Oxford Neurosymposium study illustrated a 69% correlation between NJDS gene mutation and the tumor initiation. A single case report has linked oligodendroglioma to irradiation of pituitary adenoma.

==Diagnosis==
===Microscopic appearance===
Oligodendrogliomas cannot currently be differentiated from other brain lesions solely by their clinical or radiographic appearance. As such, a brain biopsy is the only method of definitive diagnosis. Oligodendrogliomas recapitulate the appearance of the normal resident oligodendroglia of the brain. (Their name derives from the Greek roots &#x27;oligo&#x27; meaning &quot;few&quot; and &#x27;dendro&#x27; meaning &quot;trees&quot;.) They are generally composed of cells with small to slightly enlarged round nuclei with dark, compact nuclei and a small amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm. They are often referred to as &quot;fried egg&quot; cells due to their histologic appearance (though, the perinuclear halo on permanent sections is an artifact of tissue drying; fresh tissue lacks this characteristic &quot;fried egg&quot; appearance). They appear as a monotonous population of mildly enlarged round cells infiltrating normal brain parenchyma and producing vague nodules. Although the tumor may appear to be vaguely circumscribed, it is by definition a diffusely infiltrating tumor.

Classically they tend to have a vasculature of finely branching capillaries that may take on a &quot;chicken wire&quot; appearance. When invading grey matter structures such as cortex, the neoplastic oligodendrocytes tend to cluster around neurons exhibiting a phenomenon referred to as &quot;perineuronal satellitosis&quot;. Oligodendrogliomas may invade preferentially around vessels or under the pial surface of the brain.

Oligodendrogliomas must be differentiated from the more common astrocytoma. Non-classical variants and combined tumors of both oligodendroglioma and astrocytoma differentiation are seen, making this distinction controversial between different neuropathology groups. Molecular diagnostics may make this differentiation obsolete in the future. Although, in normal brain tissue, OLIG2 expresses on oligodendrocytes but not on mature astrocytes, it expresses similarly on both adult astrocytoma (including both IDH-mutant diffuse astrocytoma and anaplastic astrocytoma, as well as IDH-wildtype glioblastoma) and oligodendroglioma. Therefore, OLIG2 should not be used to differentiate these classes of adult gliomas, although the expression level might predict the IDH mutation status in some clinical circumstances.

Other glial and glioneuronal tumors with which they are often confused due to their monotonous round cell appearance include pilocytic astrocytoma, central neurocytoma, the so-called dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor, or occasionally ependymoma.

===Histopathological grading===

The histopathologic grading of oligodendrogliomas is controversial. Currently, the most commonly used grading schema is based on the year 2007 World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. An updated classification is in progress. Oligodendrogliomas are generally dichotomized into grade II (low grade) tumor.

Unfortunately, the WHO guidelines include subjective criteria in grade II. In addition, the presence of low mitotic activity, vascular proliferation and necrosis, including pseudopallisading necrosis, is insufficient by itself to elevate the grade of this tumor. This leads to inevitable interobserver variability in diagnosis by pathologists. The ultimate responsibility for making treatment decisions and interpretation of this diagnosis lies with the oncologist in consultation with the patient and their family.

It has been proposed that WHO guidelines should contain a category for grade IV oligodendrogliomas which essentially appear to be glial neoplasms with overwhelming features of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) arising from known lower grade oligodendrogliomas or GBM with a significant proportion of oligodendroglial differentiation. The diagnostic utility of this latter category is uncertain as these tumors may behave either like glioblastoma or grade III Anaplastic oligodendrogliomas. As such, this is an exceptionally unusual diagnosis.

The updated WHO guidelines published in 2007 recommends classifying such tumors for the time being as &#x27;glioblastoma with oligodendroglioma component&#x27;. It remains to be established whether or not these tumors carry a better prognosis than standard glioblastomas.

===Molecular genetics===

In WHO 2021 CNS5 Classification, oligodendroglioma is named &quot;Oligodendroglioma, IDH-mutant, and 1p/19q-codeleted&quot;, and requires the presence of IDH1 or IDH2 mutations and the codeletion of chromosome 1p and 19q arms. Interestingly, oligodendroglioma has a higher rate of IDH2 mutation than astrocytoma, so the IHC antibody against the common IDH1 p.R132H mutant might not pick up the mutation.

By far, the most common structural deformity found is co-deletion of chromosomal arms 1p and 19q. The high frequency of co-deletion is a striking feature of this glial tumour and is considered as a &quot;genetic signature&quot; of oligodendroglioma. Allelic losses on 1p and 19q, either separately or combined, are more common in classic oligodendrogliomas than in either astrocytomas or oligoastrocytomas. In one study, classic oligodendrogliomas showed 1p loss in 35 of 42 (83%) cases, 19q loss in 28 of 39 (72%), and these were combined in 27 of 39 (69%) cases; there was no significant difference in 1p/19q loss of heterozygosity status between low-grade and anaplastic oligodendroglioma. 1p/19q co-deletion has been correlated with both chemosensitivity and improved prognosis in oligodendrogliomas. The gene products lost as a consequence of this codeletion may include mediators of resistance to genotoxic therapies. Alternatively, 1p/19q loss might be an early oncogenic lesion promoting the formation of glial neoplasms, which retain high sensitivity to genotoxic stress. Most larger cancer treatment centers routinely check for the deletion of 1p/19q as part of the pathology report for oligodendrogliomas. The status of the 1p/19q loci can be detected by FISH, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis or virtual karyotyping. Virtual karyotyping has the advantage of assessing the entire genome in one assay, as well as the 1p/19q loci. This allows assessment of other key loci in glial tumors, such as EGFR and TP53 copy number status.

Whereas the prognostic relevance of 1p and 19q deletions is well established for mixed oligoastrocytomas, the prognostic relevance of the deletions for low-grade gliomas is more controversial. In terms of low-grade gliomas, a recent study also suggests that 1p/19q co-deletion may be associated with a (1;19)(q10;p10) translocation which, like the combined 1p/19q deletion, is associated with superior overall survival and progression-free survival in low-grade glioma patients. Oligodendrogliomas show only rarely mutations in the p53 gene, which is in contrast to other gliomas. Epidermal growth factor receptor amplification and whole 1p/19q codeletion are mutually exclusive and predictive of completely different outcomes, with EGFR amplification predicting poor prognosis. There is a strong correlation between 1p/19q codeletion and the expression of proneural genes, suggesting that gliomas with a 1p19q codeletion represent a subgroup of proneural gliomas.

==Treatment==
Oligodendrogliomas are generally considered to be incurable using current treatments. However compared to the more common astrocytomas, they are slowly growing with prolonged survival. In a 2019 study, an 80% survival rate was reported at 15 years for 1p/19q co-deleted oligodendroglioma treated with upfront chemotherapy irrespective of tumor grade.

Reported survival figures can be misleading since they do not always factor in the types of treatment nor the genetic signature of the tumors. A 2005 study analyzed survival based on chromosomal deletions and the effects of radiation or chemotherapy as treatment, with the following results (both low-grade and anaplastic oligodendrogliomas): 1p/19q deletion with radiation = 121 months (mean), 1p/19q deletion with chemotherapy = over 160 months (mean not yet reached), no 1p/19q deletion with radiation = 58 months (mean), and no 1p/19q deletion with chemotherapy = 75 months (mean).

Given the indolent nature of this tumor and the potential morbidity associated with neurosurgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy, most neurooncologists will initially pursue a course of watchful waiting and treat patients symptomatically. Symptomatic treatment often includes the use of anticonvulsants for seizures and steroids for brain swelling.

The standard dosing schedule of temozolomide is five consecutive days of daily dosing during 28-day cycles. However, different dosing schedules may produce better results, such as continuous daily dosing using lower amounts of drug (e.g. 21-day dosing during 28-day cycles). As an example of an altered dosing schedule, promising results have been shown using lower daily doses on each day for 7 weeks, followed by a 4-week off periods. Regarding the duration of dosing, for oligodendrogliomas the duration prescribed by oncologists varies considerably ranging from 6 cycles to over 32 cycles (i.e. over three years). In one study, researchers compared patients who received temozolomide for at least 12 months on the 5/28 day cycle, dividing such patients into two groups: &quot;short term&quot; patients receiving temozolomide for 12–18 cycles and those &quot;long term&quot; patients receiving 19 or more cycles (range was 19 to 32 cycles). Researchers found that there was a statistically significant advantage for &quot;long term&quot; treatment (median progression free survival for &quot;short term&quot; patients was 95 weeks (follow-up of 73 weeks), but for &quot;long term&quot; patients the median progression free survival was not yet reached (follow-up of 134 weeks)).

Due to the diffusely infiltrating nature, oligodendrogliomas cannot be completely resected and are not curable by surgical excision. If the tumor mass compresses adjacent brain structures, neurosurgeons typically remove as much of the tumor as possible without damaging other critical, healthy brain structures. Surgery may be followed up by chemotherapy, radiation, or a mix of both, however recent studies suggest that radiation does not improve overall survival (even when age, clinical data, histological grading, and type of surgery are considered).

==Prognosis==
Oligodendrogliomas, like all other infiltrating gliomas, have a very high (almost uniform) rate of recurrence and gradually increase in grade over time. Recurrent tumors are generally treated with more aggressive chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Recently, stereotactic surgery has proven successful in treating small tumors that have been diagnosed early.

Long-term survival is reported in a minority of patients. With aggressive treatment and close monitoring, it is possible to outlive the typical life expectancies for low grade oligodendroglioma. Westergaard&#x27;s study (1997) showed that patients younger than 20 years had a median survival of 17.5 years. For patients that are over 30, the survival rate is lower but as treatment options grow, the survival rate is higher. However, a patient with bad general health is more likely to die sooner than those that have good general health. Another study shows a 34% survival rate after 20 years. However, as discussed above, such figures can be misleading since they do not factor in the types of treatment nor the genetic signature of the tumors. Additionally, such historic data loses significance due to the relatively long survival of patients (compared to other types of brain tumors) and the introduction of newer treatment options over time. In a 2019 study, an 80% survival rate was reported at 15 years for 1p/19q co-deleted oligodendroglioma treated with upfront chemotherapy irrespective of tumor grade.

<text>Lubyanka () is the popular name for the building which contains the headquarters of the FSB on Lubyanka Square in the Meshchansky District of Moscow, Russia. It is a large Neo-Baroque building with a facade of yellow brick designed by Alexander V. Ivanov in 1897 and augmented by Aleksey Shchusev from 1940 to 1947. It was previously the national headquarters of the KGB. Soviet hammer and sickles can be seen on the building&#x27;s facade.

== Description ==
The Lubyanka building is home to the Lubyanka prison, the headquarters of the Border Guard Service, a KGB museum, and a subsection of the FSB. Part of the prison was turned into a prison museum, but a special authorization is required for visits.

The lower floors are made of granite with emblazoned Soviet crests.

== History ==
=== Origins ===
The Lubyanka was originally built in 1898 as a revenue house by the All-Russia Insurance Company (&quot;Rossiya Insurance Company&quot;), on the spot where Catherine the Great had once headquartered her secret police. The building was designed by the architect Alexander V. Ivanov. It is noted for its parquet floors and pale green walls. Belying its massiveness, the edifice avoids an impression of heroic scale: isolated Palladian and Baroque details, such as the minute pediments over the corner bays and the central loggia, are lost in an endlessly repeating palace facade where three bands of cornices emphasize the horizontal lines. A clock is centered in the uppermost band of the facade.

A fountain used to stand in front of the building, at the center of Lubyanka Square.

Following the Bolshevik Revolution, in 1918 the structure was taken over by the government, for use as the headquarters of the secret police, then called the Cheka. The prison became operational in 1920. Its prisoners included Boris Savinkov, Osip Mandelstam, Gen. Władysław Anders, and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. In Soviet Russian jokes, it was referred to as &quot;the tallest building in Moscow&quot;, since Siberia (a euphemism for the Gulag labour camp system) could be seen from its basement. The prison is on the top floor, but since there are no windows on that floor, most prisoners, and therefore popular conception, thought they were being detained in its basement.

=== KGB ===
During the Great Purge, the offices became increasingly cramped due to staff numbers. In 1940, Aleksey Shchusev was commissioned to enlarge the building. By 1947, his new design had doubled Lubyanka&#x27;s size horizontally, with the original structure taking up the left half of the facade (as viewed from the street). He added another storey and extended the structure by incorporating backstreet buildings. Shchusev&#x27;s design accentuated Neo-Renaissance detailing, but only the right part of the facade was constructed under his direction in the 1940s, due to the war and other hindrances.

Raoul Wallenberg was detained in the Lubyanka prison, where he reportedly died in 1947. According to the KGB, prisoners&#x27; interrogations stopped at Lubyanka in 1953 after the death of Stalin.
In 1957, Russia&#x27;s largest toy shop opened on the opposite side of Lubyanka Square, where a medieval cannon foundry was previously located. In 1958, the fountain at the center of Lubyanka Square was replaced by an 11-ton (or 14-ton, or 15-ton) statue of Felix Dzerzhinsky (&quot;Iron Felix&quot;), founder of the Cheka.

In 1972, Vasili Mitrokhin moved 300,000 KGB files from the Lubyanka building that he gave to the British intelligence in 1992.
The building&#x27;s asymmetric facade survived intact until 1983, when the original structure was reconstructed to match the new build, at the urging of Communist Party General Secretary and former KGB Director Yuri Andropov in accordance with Shchusev&#x27;s plans.

Although the Soviet secret police changed its name many times, their headquarters remained in this building. Secret police chiefs from Lavrenty Beria to Andropov used the same office on the third floor, which looked down on the statue of Cheka founder Felix Dzerzhinsky. A prison on the ground floor of the building figures prominently in a book written by the author Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, &quot;The Gulag Archipelago&quot;. Famous inmates held, tortured and interrogated there include Sidney Reilly, Greville Wynne, Raoul Wallenberg, Ion Antonescu, Osip Mandelstam, Genrikh Yagoda, János Esterházy, Alexander Dolgun, Rochus Misch, and Walter Ciszek.

During the 1980s, the prison was turned into a cafeteria for KGB staff.

=== Post-KGB ===
After the dissolution of the KGB in 1991, the Lubyanka became the headquarters of the Border Guard Service of Russia, as well as the Lubyanka prison, and is one directorate of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB). A museum of the KGB (now called Историко-демонстрационный зал ФСБ России, Historical Demonstration hall of the Russian FSB) was opened to the public.

In 1990, an employee of the Lubyanka, Katya Mayorova, became Miss KGB, the first official &quot;security services beauty title&quot;. In 1990, the Solovetsky Stone was erected across from the Lubyanka, to commemorate the victims of political repression. In August 1991, the statue of Felix Dzerzhinsky was dismantled and removed from the center of the Lubyanka Square. That same year, Western visitors were allowed to tour the building&#x27;s prison for the first time.

Remains of Adolf Hitler, as well as those of Joseph and Magda Goebbels, were presented at the Lubyanka in a 2004 documentary.

Hitler&#x27;s personal Golden Party Badge, which was discovered by the Red Army after the capture of Berlin, was stored in the Lubyanka. The badge was stolen in 2005, when guards thought a cat had set off the alarms, allowing the burglar to escape.

In 2015, the Lubyanka&#x27;s front door was set on fire by Pyotr Pavlensky, a performance artist. He was released from jail six months later. In 2017, a huge church was consecrated next to the Lubyanka building on the grounds of the Sretensky Monastery. The church is dedicated to the New Martyrs and Confessors of the Russian Orthodox Church, including those who were executed at Lubyanka. In December 2019, a shooting took place around the Lubyanka.

== Modernity ==
In 2008, the wing of the house from Myasnitskaya Street received the status of a cultural heritage site. In 2011, it underwent reconstruction. During this period, information appeared about the installation of a helipad on the roof of the building. According to the head of Rosokhrankultura Viktor Petrakov, it has existed for a long time. Although the roof of the building was not protected, representatives of the Moscow Department of Cultural Heritage stated that the project was not approved and the reconstruction was carried out without proper documentation. Details of the restoration of the facades, which took place in 2013-2014, were not disclosed due to the secret status of the object.
Thanks to the activities of government agencies that worked in the building, the toponym &quot;Lubyanka&quot; has become a household name. Phraseological units associated with the house appeared at different times.

Rallies and pickets are regularly held near the walls of the FSB building and the nearby Solovetsky Stone monument. In October 2018, endless single-person rallies were held near the house in support of prisoners in the cases of the and organizations. In November 2016, the artist Petr Pavlensky held an action - setting fire to the main entrance of the building as a protest &quot;against continuous terror.&quot; He was fined for damaging a cultural heritage site, although it later emerged that the original door had been removed long ago.

<doc id="1021163" wikidata="Q435525" url="?curid=1021163" title="Chihiro Onitsuka">
<text>(born October 30, 1980) is a Japanese singer-songwriter.

In 2000, Onitsuka released her debut single &quot;Shine&quot; and gained recognition when its follow-up &quot;Gekkou&quot; became a hit. &quot;Insomnia&quot;, her first studio album, released in the following year, topped the Japanese Oricon charts and has sold more than a million copies. She won the prize for lyrics of the 43rd Japan Record Awards in 2001 with &quot;Memai&quot;, one of the singles from her debut album.

Onitsuka has suffered physical and mental illnesses, affecting her career. She put her recording career on hold until March 2007, after some confrontations with record labels and management during the mid-2000s.

By 2019 Onitsuka had released seven studio albums, twenty singles, five compilations, and several DVDs, selling at least 4.1 million units.

==Early life==
Her parents encouraged Onitsuka to listen to Western music. By the time she was ten, she wrote her first poems, receiving praise from her parents, friends, and teachers, who called them &#x27;earnest efforts&#x27;. However, she thought that just writing &#x27;earnestly&#x27; wasn&#x27;t enough, and from that time onward, she tried to write every day; by the time she was in junior high school, she began to gain more confidence.

Influence from Alanis Morissette in junior high school, and Jewel in high school strongly compelled Onitsuka to become a singer-songwriter. With some 70 original compositions and several other auditions under her belt, Onitsuka entered the 1998 Virgin Tokyo Artists Audition, going on to winning Grand Prize. Onitsuka then started her career as a professional and moved to Tokyo in spring 1999 after graduating from high school.

==Career==
===2000–2001: &quot;Gekkou&quot; and &quot;Insomnia&quot;===
Onitsuka&#x27;s debut single &quot;Shine&quot; was released on February 9, 2000. Despite promotion, it failed commercially and did not enter any charts.

In August 2000, Onitsuka released &quot;Gekkō&quot; as the second single from her debut studio album, &quot;Insomnia&quot;. The song served as the theme song to the Japanese television series &quot;Trick&quot;, starring Yukie Nakama and Hiroshi Abe. The song debuted at number 30 on the Oricon Weekly Singles Chart and peaked at number 11. It has sold over 561,000 physical units and 500,000 digital units and remains Onitsuka&#x27;s best-selling song. The double-A-side single, &quot;Memai&quot;/&quot;Edge&quot; was released as the fourth single from her debut album. It peaked at number six on the Oricon Weekly Singles chart and was certificated platinum by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ). &quot;Memai&quot; later earned a Japan Record Awards for Best Lyrics at the 2001 ceremony.

Following of the success of the singles, Onitsuka&#x27;s debut studio album &quot;Insomnia&quot; was released in March 2001 to commercial success, peaking at number one on the Oricon Weekly Albums chart and having sold over 1,300,000 copies. The album later earned a Rock Album of the Year at the Japan Gold Disc Award. In support of the album, Onitsuka embarked on her first concert tour &quot;Chihiro Onitsuka Live Tour 2001&quot; in April 2001. In the same month, she released her second video album, &quot;Me and My Devil&quot;, which includes a collection of Onitsuka&#x27;s music videos.

While &quot;Insomnia&quot; remained in the charts, Onitsuka released the double-A-side single &quot;Infection&quot;/&quot;Little Beat Life&quot; as the lead single from her second album &quot;This Armor&quot; in September 2001. Four days after its release, the September 11 attacks occurred. As the lyrics of &quot;Infection&quot; can be interpreted as referring to the incident, EMI Music Japan cancelled further promotion to avoid causing controversy. The single was a commercial hit, peaking at number five on the Oricon Weekly Singles chart and selling over 170,000 copies. In November 2001, her live video album &quot;Cradle on My Noise Live: Live Insomnia Video Edition&quot; was released. It includes Onitsuka&#x27;s performance in Shibuya, Tokyo during her Chihiro Onitsuka Live Tour 2001.

===2002–2003: &quot;This Armor&quot; and &quot;Sugar High&quot;===
Onitsuka&#x27;s second studio album &quot;This Armor&quot; was released in March 2002. The album was a commercial success, peaking at number three on the Oricon Weekly Albums chart and has since sold over 500,000 copies in Japan. The album was followed by the single &quot;Ryūseigun&quot;, which served as the theme song to the second season of the Japanese television series &quot;Trick&quot; and peaked at number seven on the Oricon Weekly Singles chart.

Shortly after the album came out, Onitsuka embarked on her second concert tour &quot;Live Vibe 2002&quot;. However, she was diagnosed with acute gastroenteritis from overworking and cancelled two shows in the tour. After the tour, she took hiatus for several months to recover physically. In November 2002, she made her comeback with the performance at the Nippon Budokan, the first show of her third concert tour &quot;Chihiro Onitsuka Ultimate Crash &#x27;02&quot;.

Onitsuka&#x27;s third studio album &quot;Sugar High&quot; was released in December 2002. The ballad-filled album met with a commercial success, peaking at number two on the Oricon Weekly Albums chart and having been certificated gold by RIAJ. The album includes &quot;Castle Imitation&quot;, the theme song for the PlayStation 2 role-playing game, &quot;Breath of Fire: Dragon Quarter&quot;.

In January 2003, the documentary television program, &quot;Artist Document Kami ga Maioriru Shunkan: Chihiro Onitsuka 22 sai no Sugao&quot; was broadcast on NHK. Onitsuka released a single &quot;Sign&quot;. To promote the single, she appeared several television variety shows, including &quot;Mezamashi TV&quot; and &quot;Waratte Iitomo!&quot;. The single peaked at number four on the Oricon Weekly Singles chart, becoming Onitsuka&#x27;s highest-charting song on the chart. Her follow-up single &quot;Beautiful Fighter&quot; was released in August 2003. It was commercially less successful than her previous singles, selling only 36,000 copies. However, it peaked at number nine on the Oricon Weekly Singles chart.

On September 10, 2003, Onitsuka announced she would take a hiatus until the end of the year to undergo a surgery to remove polyps and recover from her poor throat condition. Shortly before the announcement, she finished the recording of &quot;Ii Hi Tabidachi, Nishi e&quot;, a cover of Momoe Yamaguchi. The song was released in October 2003 and sold 83,000 copies, making it her sixth best-selling song. The song served as the theme song to West Japan Railway Company&#x27;s Discover West campaign. In November 2003, she released &quot;Watashi to Waltz o&quot;, which served as the theme song to the third season of &quot;Trick&quot;, as well as her previous hits &quot;Gekkō&quot; and &quot;Ryūseigun&quot;. The song became her last single under EMI Music Japan.

===2004–2006: &quot;Sodatsu Zassō&quot; and two-year hiatus===
In March 2004, the box album titled &quot;Single Box&quot; was released without her approval. It managed to sell approximately 3,000 copies and entered on the Oricon Weekly Albums chart at number one hundred and six. Her fourth studio album was set to be released in the same year, but the album was cancelled and substituted by the release of the box album.

On June 18, 2004, she transferred to Sony Music Artists as a production label and A&amp;M Records as a record label. In September 2004, she performed &quot;King of Pain&quot;, &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot;, and premiered her original song &quot;Sodatsu Zassō&quot; at Sweet Love Shower 2004. The performance gained great public attention as she appeared in hard rock style costume, breaking down her previous pure image. The song was released in October 2004 and peaked at number ten on the Oricon Weekly Singles chart. After the release, she announced that she would put her career on hiatus again. This hiatus lasted until March 2007, when she performed at AP Bang! Tokyo Creators Meeting. At one point she said that the reason of her departure from the music scene was because of mental fatigue caused by the series of new releases and tight schedules. However, in an interview printed in the October 19, 2007, issue of the Japanese popular music magazine Barfout, Onitsuka said that in 2004 she had attempted suicide by overdosing on medication. In addition, Onitsuka mentioned a polyp on her vocal cords around that time, as well as an eating disorder that saw her weight drop as low as 79 pounds (36 kilograms).

In December 2004, Onitsuka&#x27;s first compilation album &quot;The Ultimate Collection&quot; was released simultaneously with the release of her sixth video album &quot;The Complete Clips&quot; via EMI Music Japan, her former record label. The two records were both released without her involvement; today, they are treated as unofficial albums. The compilation album was a commercial success, selling over 230,000 copies in Japan and having been certificated platinum by RIAJ. While it peaked at number three on the Oricon Weekly Albums chart, it entered &quot;G-Music&quot; East Asian Chart at number two.

On July 26, 2005, a man who kept ringing the doorbell of Onitsuka&#x27;s house for thirty minutes with a bouquet in his hands was arrested for housebreaking. In September 2005, EMI Music Japan released Onitsuka&#x27;s second compilation album &quot;Singles 2000–2003&quot;, which has sold 60,000 copies in Japan.

===2007–2010: &quot;Las Vegas&quot; and &quot;Dorothy&quot;===
In April 2007, Onitsuka founded her individual production company Napoleon Records. In the following month, her comeback single &quot;Everyhome&quot; was released as the lead single from her fourth studio album &quot;Las Vegas&quot;. The album was released in October 2007 and reached number six on the Oricon Weekly Albums chart and number one on the G-Music East Asian Chart. The second single from the album, &quot;Bokura Barairo no Hibi&quot; peaked at number thirteen on the Oricon Weekly Singles chart.

On April 26, 2008, she held her first solo show since &quot;Unplugged &#x27;03&quot; in 2003, entitled &quot;Chihiro Onitsuka Concert Nine Dirts and Snow White Flickers&quot; at Bunkamura Orchard Hall, Shibuya. &quot;Hotaru&quot;, the lead single from Onitsuka&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;Dorothy&quot;, was released on August 6, 2008, and reached number eleven on the Oricon Weekly Singles chart. The song served as the theme song to the Japanese film &quot;Last Game Saigo no Soukei Sen&quot; (2008). On September 26, 2008, she announced the cancellation of the scheduled &quot;Chihiro Onitsuka Concert Tour 2008 &#x27;Vegas Code&#x27;&quot; due to her poor physical condition.

In September 2009, Onitsuka released her fifth studio album &quot;Dorothy&quot;. The album was preceded by four singles: &quot;Hotaru&quot;, &quot;X&quot;/&quot;Last Melody&quot;, &quot;Kaerimichi o Nakushite&quot;, and &quot;Kagerō&quot;, all of which entered within top 20 on the Oricon Weekly Singles chart. The album peaked at number ten in Japan, and number four on the G-Music East Asian chart.

In April 2010, the compilation album &quot;One of Pillars: Best of Chihiro Onitsuka 2000–2010&quot; was released. Although the album is Onitsuka&#x27;s third compilation release, it was the first compilation album which was released under her approval. The album was less of a commercial success than her previous albums, and only managed to peak at number thirteen on the Oricon Weekly Albums chart, selling approximately 16,000 copies.

On August 18, 2010, it was reported that Onitsuka was a victim of domestic violence by her then-boyfriend. On September 17, the suspect, Yūsuke Komiya, was arrested.

===2011–2015: &quot;Ken to Kaede&quot; and &quot;Good Bye Train: All Time Best 2000–2013&quot;===
In February 2011, Onitsuka transferred her record label to For Life Music and released her first single under the label, &quot;Aoi Tori&quot; in August 2011. In April 2011, Onitsuka&#x27;s sixth studio album &quot;Ken to Kaede&quot; was released. The album reached number sixteen on the Oricon Weekly Albums chart and has sold 11,000 copies in Japan. To promote the album, Onitsuka embarked on the concert tour &quot;Chihiro Onitsuka Concert Tour 2011: Hotel Murderess of Arizona Acoustic Show&quot;. In September 2011, Onitsuka served as a main personality on the web series &quot;Chihiro Onitsuka: Houchou no Ue de Utatanet&quot;. Her first cover album &quot;Famous Microphone&quot; was released in May 2012 and peaked at number thirty-four on the Oricon Weekly Albums chart.

On June 22, 2012, Onitsuka opened a Twitter account. She posted several violent tweets toward celebrities like Akiko Wada and Shinsuke Shimada. These tweets were promptly deleted, and the next day she offered an apology for her remarks.

In March 2013, Onitsuka embarked on the concert tour &quot;Chihiro Onitsuka Tour Show 2013 Itazura Pierrot&quot;. She released the single &quot;Itazura Pierrot&quot; exclusively at the tour venues. In December 2013, Onitsuka released the double-A-side single &quot;This Silence is Mine&quot;/&quot;Anata to Science&quot;. The former served as the theme song to the action role-playing video game &quot;Drakengard 3&quot;. On the same day of the release, her fourth compilation album &quot;Good Bye Train: All Time Best 2000–2013&quot; was released. The album was a commercial failure, only managing to peak at number sixty-eight on the Oricon Albums chart.

In January 2014, Onitsuka embarked on the concert tour &quot;Heart Beat Tour 2014&quot;, as the vocalist of the band Chihiro Onitsuka and Billy&#x27;s Sandwiches. Her single &quot;Inori ga Kotoba ni Kawaru Koro&quot; was released in May 2014 and served as the theme song to the Japanese supernatural horror film &quot;Ju-On: The Beginning of the End&quot;. In September 2014, the debut album of Chihiro Onitsuka and Billy&#x27;s Sandwiches &quot;Tricky Sisters Magic Burger&quot; was released. The follow-up single &quot;Starlight Letter&quot; was released in April 2015 with access exclusive for her fan club. She also wrote a song &quot;Natsu no Tsumi&quot; for Natsumi Hanaoka&#x27;s debut single. The song helped her earn a Japan Record Awards nomination for Best New Artist.

===2016–present: &quot;Syndrome&quot; and upcoming eighth studio album===
On January 28, 2016, Onitsuka&#x27;s performance, entitled Chihiro Onitsuka &quot;Tune Hour 2016&quot;, was broadcast live on Ustream, in the performance, she made a strong impression that she had recovered from her bad vocal condition. In April 2016, Onitsuka embarked on the concert tour Tigerlily.

In November 2016, Onitsuka released her first single under Victor Entertainment, &quot;Good Bye My Love&quot;, as the lead single from her eighth studio album. Although the song only managed to peak at number thirty-five on the Oricon Weekly Singles chart, it became her best-selling single in the previous seven years since &quot;Kagerō&quot;. Onitsuka&#x27;s eighth studio album, &quot;Syndrome&quot; was released on February 1, 2017. The album sold better than her label expected and sold out in the several CD stores. &quot;Syndrome&quot; peaked at number fifteen on the Oricon Weekly Albums chart and spent nine weeks there, selling more than 11,000 copies. To promote the album, Onitsuka embarked on the concert tour of the same title as the album from April 2017 to July 2017. In June 2017, Onitsuka released her first live album &quot;Tiny Scream&quot;, which compiled from her performance at Breeze Tower, Osaka in June 2016, and Nakano Sun Plaza, Tokyo in November 2016. The album peaked at number twenty-two on the Oricon Weekly Albums chart and topped the Onkyo High-resolution audio chart. In August 2017, Onitsuka performed at one of the biggest music festivals in Japan, Rock in Japan Festival.

In June 2018, Onitsuka embarked on the concert tour &quot;Under Babies&quot;. On July 27, 2018, Onitsuka announced that she had been married since 2015. &quot;Hinagiku&quot;, the lead single from Onitsuka&#x27;s ninth studio album, was released in August 2018. In December 2018, Onitsuka performed two concerts entitled Beekeeper, in Osaka and Tokyo.

==Artistry==
In 2002, music critic Tetsu Misaki noted that Onitsuka was one of the few pop singers to sing about anger, citing lyrics such as in &quot;Shine&quot; (2000) and in &quot;Gekkō&quot; (2000). He praised her &quot;strong spirit&quot; and writing without hesitation, but felt like her lyrics were not like standard poetry, as they dealt with unpolished things.

Misaki also noted that her lyrics were difficult to interpret, despite the fact that she does not use complicated words. He contrasted her lyrics to that of Ayumi Hamasaki who, in the early 2000s, wrote about an &quot;easy to understand sadness,&quot; whereas it was not so clear what caused the sadness in Onitsuka&#x27;s lyrics. Misaki further noted Onitsuka&#x27;s use of body parts in her lyrics, especially legs, which is not common in Japanese popular music.

Misaki noted that Onitsuka&#x27;s song titles had little to do with their lyrical content causing discord. He pointed out &quot;Gekkō&quot; as being moonless, &quot;Memai&quot; not to do with dizziness and &quot;Rasen&quot; which, instead of having a spiral theme to the lyrics, seemed to talk about moving forward. However, &quot;Memai&quot; can be interpreted as a psychological dizziness because of the instability of the narrator and her need to be emotionally sheltered. &quot;Rasen&quot; can be interpreted either as the end of a chapter in her life, which is often called a spiral, and the beginning of a new and better one; or as a suicide song, and the spiral of emotions that lead there, such as anger, doubt, not being able to forget a loved one.

==Domestic violence==
On August 18, 2010, Onitsuka was assaulted by her boyfriend Yusuke Komiya in her apartment. Onitsuka and Komiya had been dating since September 2009 and the two shared an apartment together. Late at night on August 18, Komiya was out drinking and came home completely drunk. While Onitsuka was sleeping, Komiya punched her in the eyes. Onitsuka then tried to retaliate but was severely beaten resulting in several broken ribs. Onitsuka began her lawsuit against him on December 16, 2010.

<doc id="1021164" wikidata="Q1346753" url="?curid=1021164" title="Ependymoma">
<text>An ependymoma is a tumor that arises from the ependyma, a tissue of the central nervous system. Usually, in pediatric cases the location is intracranial, while in adults it is spinal. The common location of intracranial ependymomas is the floor of the fourth ventricle. Rarely, ependymomas can occur in the pelvic cavity.

Syringomyelia can be caused by an ependymoma.
Ependymomas are also seen with neurofibromatosis type II.

==Signs and symptoms==
Source:
* severe headache
* visual loss (due to papilledema)
* vomiting
* bilateral Babinski sign
* drowsiness (after several hours of the above symptoms)
* gait change (rotation of feet when walking)
* impaction/constipation
* back flexibility

==Morphology==
Ependymomas are composed of cells with regular, round to oval nuclei. There is a variably dense fibrillary background. Tumor cells may form gland-like round or elongated structures that resemble the embryologic ependymal canal, with long, delicate processes extending into the lumen; more frequently present are perivascular pseudorosettes in which tumor cells are arranged around vessels with an intervening zone consisting of thin ependymal processes directed toward the wall of the vessel.

It has been suggested that ependymomas are derived from radial glia, despite their name suggesting an ependymal origin.

===Ependymoma tumors===
Ependymomas make up about 5% of adult intracranial gliomas and up to 10% of childhood tumors of the central nervous system (CNS). Their occurrence seems to peak at age 5 years and then again at age 35. They develop from cells that line both the hollow cavities of the brain and the central canal containing the spinal cord, but they usually arise from the floor of the fourth ventricle, situated in the lower back portion of the brain, where they may produce headache, nausea and vomiting by obstructing the flow of cerebrospinal fluid. This obstruction may also cause hydrocephalus. They may also arise in the spinal cord, conus medullaris and supratentorial locations. Other symptoms can include (but are not limited to): loss of appetite, difficulty sleeping, temporary inability to distinguish colors, uncontrollable twitching, seeing vertical or horizontal lines when in bright light, and temporary memory loss. It should be remembered that these symptoms also are prevalent in many other illnesses not associated with ependymoma.

About 10% of ependymomas are benign myxopapillary ependymoma (MPE). MPE is a localized and slow-growing low-grade tumor, which originates almost exclusively from the lumbosacral nervous tissue of young patients. On the other hand, it is the most common tumor of the lumbosacral canal comprising about 90% of all tumoral lesions in this region.

Although some ependymomas are of a more anaplastic and malignant type, most of them are not anaplastic. Well-differentiated ependymomas are usually treated with surgery. For other ependymomas, total surgical removal is the preferred treatment in addition to radiation therapy. The malignant (anaplastic) varieties of this tumor, malignant ependymoma and the ependymoblastoma, are treated similarly to medulloblastoma but the prognosis is much less favorable. Malignant ependymomas may be treated with a combination of radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Ependymoblastomas, which occur in infants and children younger than 5 years of age, may spread through the cerebrospinal fluid and usually require radiation therapy. The subependymoma, a variant of the ependymoma, is apt to arise in the fourth ventricle but may occur in the septum pellucidum and the cervical spinal cord. It usually affects people over 40 years of age and more often affects men than women.

Extraspinal ependymoma (EEP), also known as extradural ependymoma, may be an unusual form of teratoma or may be confused with a sacrococcygeal teratoma.

==Treatment==
Guidelines for initial management for ependymoma are maximum surgical resection followed by radiation. Chemotherapy is of limited use and reserved for special cases including young children and those with tumor present after resection. Prophylactic craniospinal irradiation is of variable use and is a source of controversy given that most recurrence occurs at the site of resection and therefore is of debatable efficacy. Confirmation of cerebrospinal infiltration warrants more expansive radiation fields.

Prognosis of recurrence is poor and often indicates palliative care to manage symptoms.

<doc id="1021168" wikidata="Q3474237" url="?curid=1021168" title="Newhalem, Washington">
<text>Newhalem (&quot;Lushootseed&quot;: ) is a small unincorporated community on the Skagit River in the western foothills of the North Cascades, in Whatcom County, northwestern Washington, United States.

==Description==
Newhalem is a company town owned by Seattle City Light and populated entirely by employees of the Skagit River Hydroelectric Project, or of local county, state or federal agencies. The town is not open to permanent residents who do not work for these agencies. The Ross Lake National Recreation Area surrounds Newhalem on all sides, and the North Cascades National Park boundary is approximately one mile to the north and south of the town. Newhalem does not have an assigned US Postal Service zip code and thus, for postal purposes, is considered part of Rockport (98283).

The name Newhalem has its roots in a local indigenous language as meaning &#x27;Goat Snare&#x27;, as the natives used to trap mountain goats in the area.

In pre-colonial times, the site was inhabited by members of the Upper Skagits.

There was a school in Newhalem a long time ago but it was demolished because the population had severely dropped. Now the students have about a -hour bus to Concrete.

==Climate==
Newhalem has plentiful rainfall year-round, but with significantly less rainfall in the summer months than in winter. According to the Köppen climate classification, Newhalem has an oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;).

==Newhalem in literature and film==
The writer Tobias Wolff lived in Newhalem as a boy in the late 1950s, after his mother moved from west Seattle to marry a mechanic who lived in one of the company houses. In his memoir, &quot;This Boy&#x27;s Life&quot;, he calls this isolated settlement &quot;Chinook,&quot; and describes how the nearest high school was a long bus ride away, in a slightly larger hamlet called Concrete. In the 1993 film version of &quot;This Boy&#x27;s Life&quot;, starring Robert De Niro and Leonardo DiCaprio, the two places are combined and called &quot;Concrete.&quot;

Portions of the 1983 Hollywood movie &quot;WarGames&quot;, starring Matthew Broderick, were filmed in Newhalem (most notably the scenes of the &quot;Cheyenne Mountain Complex&quot;, filmed in an abandoned gravel pit northwest of the town).

==Newhalem summer softball tournament==
On every third weekend of July since 1977 there is a softball tournament held between competitors hailing from across the Skagit Valley.

==Highway 20==
Newhalem is the final place on Highway 20 to purchase supplies before crossing Rainy Pass and entering Eastern Washington.

<doc id="1021169" wikidata="Q7369758" url="?curid=1021169" title="Rosseau, Ontario">
<text>Rosseau is a community in the District of Parry Sound in Ontario, Canada, located in the township of Seguin. It is situated on the north shore of Lake Rosseau, a popular vacationing area. It is one of the ends of the Rosseau-Nipissing Road, which stretches all the way up to Lake Nipissing, near North Bay, Ontario. An Ontario Historical Plaque was erected by the province to commemorate the Rosseau-Nipissing Road&#x27;s role in Ontario&#x27;s heritage.

Rosseau was formerly an incorporated village, which was amalgamated into the newly created Seguin Township on January 1, 1998.

The town shops are mostly arts and crafts shops with a few exceptions. One of them is the famous Rosseau General Store, which has stood since the late 19th century. The town has a marina and public beach area that has undergone renovations including new boat launches and large docks, a pavilion and public washrooms. The town also has a restaurant and a cafe. There are many shops; Rosseau is a tourist area, with many people visiting in the summer months to enjoy the scenery, shop for arts and crafts, or stop at the historic buildings. The town also hosts summer farmers markets and the Rosseau Fall Fair in late August, when people from all over Ontario come to have fun. Rosseau is serviced by roads which provide access to Huntsville, Parry Sound, Bracebridge, Windermere and other small communities in the area. Most lake travellers are familiar with the famous lighthouse which light still shines.

The local post office in the centre of the village services locals with lock boxes and one rural route.

The townsfolk and tourists of Rosseau in the late 19th century and early 20th century welcomed visitors arriving by steamboat, by singing the Rosseau Song (arrival song):
:&quot;Oh we&#x27;ll sing a little song of Rosseau,&quot;
:&quot;It&#x27;s the best old town that I know&quot;
:&quot;Oh you Rosseau, where the summer breezes blow,&quot;
:&quot;Where the skies are the clearest and the girls that you meet are the fairest,&quot;
:&quot;Oh you Rosseau, you&#x27;re the best old town that I know.&quot;

As the steamboat departed at the end of the visitors’ holiday, the visitors wistfully returned the favour by singing the Rosseau Song (departing song) to the townsfolk:
:&quot;Rosseau Town—again it&#x27;s time to say to Rosseau Town –Good-bye&quot;
:&quot;When we came, we all were smiling, now we leave you with a sigh&quot;
:&quot;But when summer comes once more&quot;
:&quot;We&#x27;ll return to you again&quot;
:&quot;Oh Rosseau Town, again it&#x27;s time to say to Rosseau Town—Good-by.&quot;

The first verse was sung to the same tune as the Cobalt Song, which adopted the original tune of the Rosseau Song. The second verse was sung to a different tune, which was likely improvised.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Rosseau had a population of 288 living in 95 of its 149 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 223. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

<text>Horst Berger (1928-2019) was a structural engineer and designer known for his work with lightweight tensile architecture. After receiving a degree in Civil Engineering in 1954 from Stuttgart University in Stuttgart, Germany, he began working in 1955 at the Bridge and Special Structures Department of Wayss and Freitag in Frankfurt. In 1960, he joined Severud Associates in New York city and worked on projects such as the St. Louis Arch, Madison Square Garden, and Toronto City Hall.

After forming Geiger Berger Associates in 1968 with air supported roof inventor David Geiger, the firm gained international recognition for its incorporation of lightweight fabric structures into permanent architectural designs.

During his time at Geiger Berger Associates, Horst Berger had the challenge of engineering the roof designed by architect Fazlur Rahman Khan of Skidmore, Owings and Merrill for the Haj Terminal at the Jeddah Airport. This tensile fabric structure consists of 210 roof units contained in ten modules that are supported on steel pylons.

In 1990 Horst Berger was asked to create a tensile fabric roof for the Denver International Airport. Challenges of snow loading and attaching the rigid walls to the fabric roof made it one of Berger’s toughest projects. The unique design with the roofing structure gave the terminal a more spacious layout.

In 1990 he became a professor at the School of Architecture of the City College of New York.

While studying and working in New York, Berger married an American woman Gretchen (Gay) Smart. They had four children, Ralf, Susie, Paul and Barbara; Barbara died in 2011, aged 53.

<text>Giant cockroaches, or blaberids (family Blaberidae), are the second-largest cockroach family by number of species. Mostly distributed in warmer climates worldwide, this family is based on the American genus &quot;Blaberus&quot;, but much of the diversity is also found in Africa and Asia.

==Description==
They are the only ovoviviparous cockroach family. The ootheca is seen very briefly before being retracted into the body, where soon after the young nymphs hatch inside, the female gives live birth. The cerci are smaller compared to other families, and most of the time are covered by wings. They&#x27;re mostly found in caves, rotting logs or buried under leaf litter. Many are often kept as pets or as feeder insects, such as &quot;Blaberus&quot;, &quot;Gromphadorhina&quot; or &quot;Macropanesthia&quot;.

===Notable species===
Notable species within this family include:
* Cape mountain cockroach – &quot;Aptera fusca&quot;
* Dwarf cave cockroach – &quot;Blaberus atropos&quot; (syn. &quot;Blaberus fusca&quot;)
* Death&#x27;s head cockroach – &quot;Blaberus craniifer&quot;
* False death&#x27;s head cockroach – &quot;Blaberus discoidalis&quot;
* Giant cave cockroach – &quot;Blaberus giganteus&quot;
* Dubia cockroach – &quot;Blaptica dubia&quot;
* Orange head cockroach – &quot;Eublaberus posticus&quot;
* Glowspot cockroach – &quot;Lucihormetica verrucosa&quot;
* Beetle cockroach – &quot;Diploptera punctata&quot;
* Chrome cockroach – &quot;Gyna caffrorum&quot;
* Cuban, or green banana cockroach – &quot;Panchlora nivea&quot;
* Halloween hissing cockroach – &quot;Elliptorhina javanica&quot;
* Wide-horned hissing cockroach – &quot;Gromphadorhina oblongonota&quot;
* Madagascar hissing cockroach – &quot;Gromphadorhina portentosa&quot;
* Speckled cockroach – &quot;Nauphoeta cinerea&quot;
* Surinam cockroach – &quot;Pycnoscelus surinamensis&quot;
* Australian wood cockroach – &quot;Panesthia&quot; spp. including &quot;P. cribrata&quot;
* Giant burrowing cockroach – &quot;Macropanesthia rhinoceros&quot;
* Emerald cockroach – &quot;Pseudoglomeris magnifica&quot;

<text>The Nikon D2X is a 12.4-megapixel professional digital single-lens reflex camera (DSLR) that Nikon Corporation announced on September 16, 2004. The D2X was the high-resolution flagship in Nikon&#x27;s DSLR line until June 2006 when it was supplanted by the D2Xs and, in time, the Nikon D3 range, Nikon D4 range, the Nikon D5 and the Nikon D6— the latter four using a FX full-format sensor.

== Technology ==

The D2X uses a DX-format CMOS sensor supplied by Sony instead of either a charge-coupled device or the Nikon proprietary LBCAST sensor which had both dominated Nikon&#x27;s digital SLR lineup until the D2X. The camera supports the sYCC color space. The CMOS sensor used in the D2X has the ability to resolve about nine times more than the human eye. At 90 line pairs/millimeter (90 lp/mm), the sensor can resolve extremely fine detail. This makes the camera perform exceptionally well when used as a landscape or scenic imager, since it can better resolve smaller detail in distant objects.

The D2X surpasses the D2H and its successor the D2Hs by providing 5 frame/s at 12 megapixels, and 8 frames/second at 6.8 megapixels with its high-speed crop mode. In high-speed crop mode, the camera sacrifices pixels in favour of speed and crops the image to 50% of a 35 mm frame to enable continuous shooting at up to 8 frames per second (vs. 5 frame/s at full resolution).

It incorporates some other innovations such as refinements of the metering and autofocus systems. At the same time, the camera is able to make use of virtually all of Nikon&#x27;s F-Mount lenses, including most legacy lenses. It has a rated shutter life of 200,000+ images, which is generally double or triple than less costly cameras.

It is one of very few cameras with a built-in &quot;third-eye&quot; which records the color of ambient light, giving the D2X an additional tool to accurately compute the white-balance for each image, instead of relying on calculations based only on subjects within the picture frame.

At the time of its release, the D2X had the highest concentration of pixels (pixel pitch) of any Nikon DSLR made to date. While its resolving capabilities are impressive, the very small resulting pixel size puts the camera at a disadvantage when working in low light by introducing slight noise in underexposed areas. The D2X has excellent noise reduction software built into the camera, so its images reflect the very high quality one would expect from an expensive digital SLR.

== Audience ==

The D2X was aimed at professional users. It replaced the D1X and complemented Nikon&#x27;s D2Hs camera with which it shares a body. It was a very important model for Nikon given the 3½ years which had elapsed between the D1X and D2X, during which time competitive pressure mounted on the D1X.

== Competition ==
The principal competitive cameras for the D2X were the full-frame Canon EOS-1Ds Mark II and the Canon EOS-1D Mark II N. There was also some competitive overlap between the full-frame Canon EOS 5D and the D2Xs, although they were not direct competitors.

An unresolved debate rages about the respective technical compromises of the DX-format sensor and full frame sensors (100% of a 35 mm film frame) offered in competition with the D2X&#x27;s DX format. Each format offers advantages and disadvantages which become more or less important in different usage settings (e.g. studio vs sport, indoor vs outdoor, wide angle vs telephoto). Nikon, convinced that the design characteristics of the DX format are best choice for its customers and target markets, had committed itself publicly to the DX-format sensor and its line of DX lenses is specifically designed for the smaller sensor. This philosophy remained until 2007, at which point Nikon&#x27;s new generation of professional-level digital SLRs - the Nikon D3 and Nikon D700 - adopted a full-frame sensor.

Nikon&#x27;s D2X was awarded best product accolades for 2005–6 by the European Imaging and Sound Association. Named European Professional Camera of the Year, the D2X&#x27;s &#x27;extraordinary performance&#x27; was praised by the judges.

== Nikon D2Xs ==
Nikon D2Xs is a digital single-lens reflex camera announced June 1, 2006, replacing the professional Nikon D2X.

Its improvements over the original D2X include:
* Automatic viewfinder masking in high-speed crop mode
* Increased buffer capacity to 60 frames in continuous shooting
* Additional ISO steps between 800 and 1600
* Improved metering for High Speed Crop
* More Autofocus options
* An AF system that can now detect focus at lower contrast and in lower light
* Higher capacity battery rated to 3,800 exposures per charge
* Improved Auto-ISO features
* Image verification
* Ability to save and load camera settings from a memory card
* 2.5 inch (64 mm) 230,000 pixel LCD with 170 degree viewing angle (same as D200)
* Menu look ported from the D200
* Black and White mode
* Additional color mode selections
* Locking USB connector
* Support for multiple custom curves
* A lockable recent settings menu
* Improved GPS data recording
* AF and VR mode recording in shooting data
* In-camera cropping

The original D2X gets the majority of these upgrades with a simple firmware update, with the exceptions of:
* Automatic viewfinder masking in High-Speed Crop mode
* 2.5 inch (64 mm) 230,000 pixel LCD with 170 degree viewing angle (the viewing angle is the area of improvement—size remains the same)

The larger capacity EN-EL4e is compatible with the original D2X and will give it the same improved battery life.

<text>Immunohistochemistry is a form of immunostaining. It involves the process of selectively identifying antigens in cells and tissue, by exploiting the principle of antibodies binding specifically to antigens in biological tissues. Albert Hewett Coons, Ernest Berliner, Norman Jones and Hugh J Creech was the first to develop immunofluorescence in 1941. This led to the later development of immunohistochemistry.

Immunohistochemical staining is widely used in the diagnosis of abnormal cells such as those found in cancerous tumors. In some cancer cells certain tumor antigens are expressed which make it possible to detect. Immunohistochemistry is also widely used in basic research, to understand the distribution and localization of biomarkers and differentially expressed proteins in different parts of a biological tissue.

==Sample preparation==

Immunohistochemistry can be performed on tissue that has been fixed and embedded in paraffin, but also cryopreservated (frozen) tissue. Based on the way the tissue is preserved, there are different steps to prepare the tissue for immunohistochemistry, but the general method includes proper fixation, antigen retrieval incubation with primary antibody, then incubation with secondary antibody.

=== Tissue preparation and fixation ===
Fixation of the tissue is important to preserve the tissue and maintaining cellular morphology. The fixation formula, ratio of fixative to tissue and time in the fixative, will affect the result. The fixation solution (fixative) is often 10% neutral buffer formalin. Normal fixation time is 24 hours in room temperature. The ratio of fixative to tissue ranges from 1:1 to 1:20. After the tissue is fixed it can be embedded in paraffin wax.

For frozen sections, fixation is usually performed after sectioning if not new antibodies are going to be tested. Then acetone or formalin can be used. 

=== Sectioning ===
Sectioning of the tissue sample is done using a microtome. For paraffin embedded tissue 4 μm is normal thickness, and for frozen sections 4 – 6 μm. The thickness of the sliced sections matters, and is an important factor in immunohistochemistry. If you compare a section of brain tissue measuring 4 μm with a section measuring 7 μm, some of what you see in the 7 μm thick section might be lacking in the 4 μm section. This shows the importance of detailed methods related to this methodology. The paraffin embedded tissues should be deparaffinized to remove all the paraffin on and around the tissue sample in xylene or a good substitute, followed by alcohol.

=== Antigen retrieval ===
Antigen retrieval is required to make the epitopes accessible for immunohistochemical staining for most formalin fixed tissue section. The epitopes are the binding sites for antibodies used to visualize the targeted antigen which may be masked due to the fixation. Fixation of the tissue may cause formation of methylene bridges or crosslinking of amino groups, so that the epitopes no longer are available. Antigen retrieval can restore the masked antigenicity, possibly by breaking down the crosslinks caused by fixation. The most common way to perform antigen retrieval is by using high-temperature heating while soaking the slides in a buffer solution. This can be done in different ways, for example by using microwave oven, autoclaves, heating plates or water baths. For frozen sections, antigen retrieval is generally not necessary, but for frozen section that has been fixed in acetone or formalin, can antigen retrieval improve the immunohistochemistry signal.

=== Blocking ===
Non-specific binding of antibodies can cause background staining. Although antibodies bind to specific epitopes, they may also partially or weakly bind to sites on nonspecific proteins that are similar to the binding site on the target protein. By incubating the tissue with normal serum isolated from the species which the secondary antibody was produced, the background staining can be reduced. It is also possible to use commercially available universal blocking buffers. Other common blocking buffers include normal serum, non-fat dry milk, BSA, or gelatin. Endogenous enzyme activity may also cause background staining but can be reduced if the tissue is treated with hydrogen peroxide.

==Sample labeling==
After preparing the sample, the target can be visualized by using antibodies labeled with fluorescent compounds, metals or enzymes. There are direct and indirect methods for labeling the sample.

===Antibody types===
The antibodies used for detection can be polyclonal or monoclonal. Polyclonal antibodies are made by using animals like guinea pig, rabbit, mouse, rat, or goat. The animal is injected with the antigen of interest and trigger an immune response. The antibodies can be isolated from the animal&#x27;s whole serum. Polyclonal antibody production will result in a mixture of different antibodies and will recognize multiple epitopes. Monoclonal antibodies are made by injecting the animal with the antigen of interest and then isolating an antibody-producing B cell, typically from the spleen. The antibody producing cell is then fused with a cancer cell line. This causes the antibodies to show specificity for a single epitope.

For immunohistochemical detection strategies, antibodies are classified as primary or secondary reagents. Primary antibodies are raised against an antigen of interest and are typically unconjugated (unlabeled). Secondary antibodies are raised against immunoglobulins of the primary antibody species. The secondary antibody is usually conjugated to a linker molecule, such as biotin, that then recruits reporter molecules, or the secondary antibody itself is directly bound to the reporter molecule.

=== Detection methods ===
The direct method is a one-step staining method and involves a labeled antibody reacting directly with the antigen in tissue sections. While this technique utilizes only one antibody and therefore is simple and rapid, the sensitivity is lower due to little signal amplification, in contrast to indirect approaches.

The indirect method involves an unlabeled primary antibody that binds to the target antigen in the tissue. Then a secondary antibody, which binds with the primary antibody is added as a second layer. As mentioned, the secondary antibody must be raised against the antibody IgG of the animal species in which the primary antibody has been raised. This method is more sensitive than direct detection strategies because of signal amplification due to the binding of several secondary antibodies to each primary antibody.

The indirect method, aside from its greater sensitivity, also has the advantage that only a relatively small number of standard conjugated (labeled) secondary antibodies needs to be generated. For example, a labeled secondary antibody raised against rabbit IgG, is useful with any primary antibody raised in rabbit. This is particularly useful when a researcher is labeling more than one primary antibody, whether due to polyclonal selection producing an array of primary antibodies for a singular antigen or when there is interest in multiple antigens. With the direct method, it would be necessary to label each primary antibody for every antigen of interest.
=== Reporter molecules ===
Reporter molecules vary based on the nature of the detection method, the most common being chromogenic and fluorescence detection. In chromogenic immunohistochemistry an antibody is conjugated to an enzyme, such as alkaline phosphate and horseradish peroxidase, that can catalyze a color-producing reaction in the presence of a chromogenic substrate like diaminobenzidine. The colored product can be analyzed with an ordinary light microscope. In immunofluorescence the antibody is tagged to a fluorophore, such as fluorescein isothiocyanate, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate, aminomethyl Coumarin acetate or Cyanine5. Synthetic fluorochromes from Alexa Fluors is also commonly used. The fluorochromes can be visualized by a fluorescence or confocal microscope.

For chromogenic and fluorescent detection methods, densitometric analysis of the signal can provide semi- and fully quantitative data, respectively, to correlate the level of reporter signal to the level of protein expression or localization.

===Counterstains===

After immunohistochemical staining of the target antigen, another stain is often applied. The counterstain provide contrast that helps the primary stain stand out and makes it easier to examine the tissue morphology. It also helps with orientation and visualization of the tissue section. Hematoxylin is commonly used.

=== Troubleshooting ===
In immunohistochemical techniques, there are several steps prior to the final staining of the tissue that can cause a variety of problems. It can be strong background staining, weak target antigen staining and presence of artifacts. It is important that antibody quality and the immunohistochemistry techniques are optimized. Endogenous biotin, reporter enzymes or primary/secondary antibody cross-reactivity are common causes of strong background staining. Weak or absent staining may be caused by inaccurate fixation of the tissue or to low antigen levels. These aspects of immunohistochemistry tissue prep and antibody staining must be systematically addressed to identify and overcome staining issues.
Methods to eliminate background staining include dilution of the primary or secondary antibodies, changing the time or temperature of incubation, and using a different detection system or different primary antibody. Quality control should as a minimum include a tissue known to express the antigen as a positive control and negative controls of tissue known not to express the antigen, as well as the test tissue probed in the same way with omission of the primary antibody (or better, absorption of the primary antibody).
==Diagnostic immunohistochemistry markers==

Immunohistochemistry is an excellent detection technique and has the tremendous advantage of being able to show exactly where a given protein is located within the tissue examined. It is also an effective way to examine the tissues. This has made it a widely used technique in neuroscience, enabling researchers to examine protein expression within specific brain structures. Its major disadvantage is that, unlike immunoblotting techniques where staining is checked against a molecular weight ladder, it is impossible to show in immunohistochemistry that the staining corresponds with the protein of interest. For this reason, primary antibodies must be well-validated in a Western Blot or similar procedure. The technique is even more widely used in diagnostic surgical pathology for immunophenotyping tumors (e.g. immunostaining for e-cadherin to differentiate between ductal carcinoma in situ (stains positive) and lobular carcinoma in situ (does not stain positive)). More recently, immunohistochemical techniques have been useful in differential diagnoses of multiple forms of salivary gland, head, and neck carcinomas.

The diversity of immunohistochemistry markers used in diagnostic surgical pathology is substantial. Many clinical laboratories in tertiary hospitals will have menus of over 200 antibodies used as diagnostic, prognostic and predictive biomarkers. Examples of some commonly used markers include:
* BrdU: used to identify replicating cells. Used to identify tumors as well as in neuroscience research.
* Cytokeratins: used for identification of carcinomas but may also be expressed in some sarcomas.
* CD15 and CD30: used for Hodgkin&#x27;s disease.
* Alpha fetoprotein: for yolk sac tumors and hepatocellular carcinoma.
* CD117 (KIT): for gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) and mast cell tumors.
* CD10 (CALLA): for renal cell carcinoma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
* Prostate specific antigen (PSA): for prostate cancer.
* estrogens and progesterone receptor (ER &amp; PR) staining are used both diagnostically (breast and gyn tumors) as well as prognostic in breast cancer and predictive of response to therapy (estrogen receptor).
* Identification of B-cell lymphomas using CD20.
* Identification of T-cell lymphomas using CD3.

* PIN-4 cocktail, targeting p63, CK-5, CK-14 and AMACR (latter also known as P504S), and used to distinguish prostate adenocarcinoma from benign glands.

==Directing therapy==
A variety of molecular pathways are altered in cancer and some of the alterations can be targeted in cancer therapy. Immunohistochemistry can be used to assess which tumors are likely to respond to therapy, by detecting the presence or elevated levels of the molecular target.

===Chemical inhibitors===
Tumor biology allows for a number of potential intracellular targets. Many tumors are hormone dependent. The presence of hormone receptors can be used to determine if a tumor is potentially responsive to antihormonal therapy. One of the first therapies was the antiestrogen, tamoxifen, used to treat breast cancer. Such hormone receptors can be detected by immunohistochemistry.
Imatinib, an intracellular tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was developed to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia, a disease characterized by the formation of a specific abnormal tyrosine kinase. Imitanib has proven effective in tumors that express other tyrosine kinases, most notably KIT. Most gastrointestinal stromal tumors express KIT, which can be detected by immunohistochemistry.

===Monoclonal antibodies===
Many proteins shown to be highly upregulated in pathological states by immunohistochemistry are potential targets for therapies utilising monoclonal antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies, due to their size, are utilized against cell surface targets. Among the overexpressed targets are members of the EGFR family, transmembrane proteins with an extracellular receptor domain regulating an intracellular tyrosine kinase. Of these, HER2/neu (also known as Erb-B2) was the first to be developed. The molecule is highly expressed in a variety of cancer cell types, most notably breast cancer. As such, antibodies against HER2/neu have been FDA approved for clinical treatment of cancer under the drug name &quot;Herceptin&quot;. There are commercially available immunohistochemical tests, Dako HercepTest, Leica Biosystems Oracle and Ventana Pathway.

Similarly, epidermal growth factor receptor (HER-1) is overexpressed in a variety of cancers including head and neck and colon. Immunohistochemistry is used to determine patients who may benefit from therapeutic antibodies such as Erbitux (cetuximab). Commercial systems to detect epidermal growth factor receptor by immunohistochemistry include the Dako pharmDx.

== Mapping protein expression ==
Immunohistochemistry can also be used for a more general protein profiling, provided the availability of antibodies validated for immunohistochemistry. The Human Protein Atlas displays a map of protein expression in normal human organs and tissues. The combination of immunohistochemistry and tissue microarrays provides protein expression patterns in a large number of different tissue types. Immunohistochemistry is also used for protein profiling in the most common forms of human cancer.
