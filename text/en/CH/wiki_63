<text>Roy Lee Lassiter (born March 9, 1969) is an American former professional soccer player. who played as a forward. He played the first few years of his professional career in Costa Rica. He returned to the United States to play in Major League Soccer when that league was launched in 1996, and from 1996 to 1999 he was one of the most prolific goal scorers in MLS. Lassiter served as the assistant coach of MLS Next Pro club Houston Dynamo 2. On Thursday, June 15, 2023, Lassiter was named Head Coach of Carolina Core FC.

He is the father of Ariel Lassiter, who plays for CF Montréal of MLS.

==Early life and education==
Lassiter was born in Washington, D.C., but grew up in Raleigh, North Carolina where he attended Athens Drive High School. He was the North Carolina State 4-A Player of the Year as a senior and a high school All-American. That year, he led his high school soccer team to the state championship while scoring a state record 47 goals. He also played for a local youth club, 69 Raleigh Rockets, which beat to the LaJolla Nomads 3–0, Roy scored all three goals, in the 1986 Noitis National Club Championship Cup. Lost in the 1986 Southern Regional Finals, in Plano TX, to the Dallas Titans 3–2, before the McGuire Cup. Lassiter attended Lees-McRae College in 1987, won the D3 National Championship 1988. He then transferred to North Carolina State University in 1989, where he was a 1991 First Team All-ACC and All South.

==Club career==
While convalescing, Lassiter was contacted by Turrialba from Costa Rica in 1992. As Lassiter recalls it, &quot;I have no idea how they got my name. They paid for my trip down there while still recovering from my leg injury, and I signed a contract.&quot; He also played for Carmelita and in summer 1995, Alajuelense sold him to Major League Soccer. In August 1995, Lassiter was arrested in connection with two burglaries that took place in 1992 after a Raleigh police detective read a newspaper article that mentioned a goal Lassiter scored in a U.S. friendly match with Benfica. Lassiter was sentenced to 30 days in jail.

In 1996, Lassiter won the top goalscorer award in Major League Soccer, scoring 27 goals for Tampa Bay Mutiny, after when he was loaned for 6 months to Italian Serie B side Genoa. His record in the league&#x27;s inaugural season was tied several times, but stood until it was broken in 2018 by Josef Martínez of Atlanta United FC.

Lassiter was traded to D.C. United in 1998 for Roy Wegerle. He played two seasons in DC, winning the MLS Cup in 1999. Lassiter was traded to the Miami Fusion in 2000 due to salary cap, as Lassiter sought a significant pay raise yet D.C. United were near their salary cap limit. He was then traded to the Kansas City Wizards in 2001, and back to DC in the middle of the 2002 season. He ended his MLS career with 88 regular season goals, a record surpassed in 2004 by Jason Kreis. Lassiter added 13 goals in MLS playoffs and is 3rd in that category behind Carlos Ruiz and Landon Donovan.

He ended his professional career with A-League&#x27;s Virginia Beach Mariners in 2003 as player/assistant coach, but played a few games with Laredo Heat of the Premier Development League and the exhibition Austin Posse in 2004 to help promote their clubs.

==International career==
Lassiter was called up to the U.S. national team in January 1992. He earned his first cap as a substitute for Eric Wynalda in a 1–0 loss to the Commonwealth of Independent States in Miami. However, he broke his leg in a training ground collision with Bruce Murray a few days later. His second cap with the national team came over three years later as a substitute for Frank Klopas in an August 16, 1995 1–0 loss to Sweden in Norrköping. On October 8, 1995, he played a third time for the national team, again as a substitute, scoring the game-winning goal in a 4–3 victory over Saudi Arabia. Lassiter&#x27;s career continued to rise, and he earned his first start for the national team in December 1996 and became a regular for much of 1997. While Lassiter played consistently for the U.S. in 1997, his appearances tapered off in 1998 and he was selected as an alternate for the 1998 FIFA World Cup roster. He played only one game in 2000, his last with the national team. He represented his country in four FIFA World Cup qualification matches and finished his international career with 34 caps and 4 goals.

<doc id="1029473" wikidata="Q279588" url="?curid=1029473" title="A1 Grand Prix">
<text>A1 Grand Prix Operations Ltd. operated as A1 Grand Prix (A1GP) was a &quot;single-make&quot; open-wheel auto racing series that ran from 2005 until 2009. It was unique in its field in that competitors solely represented their nation as opposed to themselves or a team, the usual format in most formula racing series. As such, it was often promoted as the &quot;World Cup of Motorsport&quot;. The series was ratified by the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA), and races were held in the traditional Formula One off-season, the northern hemisphere winter. The nation-based A1GP concept was founded by Sheikh Maktoum Hasher Maktoum Al Maktoum of Dubai, initially in 2003. After a successful first season of A1GP, it was announced on 29 September 2006 that Maktoum was to sell his position as chairman and director of A1GP. The transfer of his share in the organisation of A1 Grand Prix to RAB Capital was finalized in December 2006. Tony Teixeira took control of the series in 2006, and the series later liquidated after failing to host any races during the 2009–10 season.

==History==
The nation-based A1GP concept was founded by Sheikh Maktoum Hasher Maktoum Al Maktoum of Dubai, initially in 2003. Once the series had received the backing of the FIA, a management structure including new executive directors Brian Menell and Tony Teixeira were appointed to oversee the sale of franchises for the operation of international teams. Thirty franchises were made available; twenty-three of them were restricted to specified nations, while the other seven were opened to tender for nations that had not been initially targeted.

===First season===
Twenty-five of the franchises were purchased in time for the 2005–06 A1 Grand Prix season, which began on 25 September 2005 with the A1 Grand Prix of Nations Great Britain at the Brands Hatch circuit in Kent, United Kingdom. The first season was planned for 12 rounds (24 races, with two each weekend); however the cancellation of a race scheduled for Curitiba, Brazil in January 2006 reduced this number to 11. Nelson Piquet Jr. won the inaugural race of the series for A1 Team Brazil. Their winning form was not to continue. Wins at Estoril and Malaysia saw A1 Team France build up a sizeable gap. By the start of the winter break, France had run away with the lead with A1 Team Switzerland 28 points behind. At the final race of the season in Shanghai, A1 Team France were crowned the first-ever A1 Grand Prix world champions with 172 points. Switzerland were second with 121 points and A1 Team Great Britain third with 97 points.

Katherine Legge was the first woman to drive A1 Grand Prix cars during test session in December 2005 on Dubai Autodrome.

===Second season===
Changes were made for the 2006–07 season to race durations and distances to improve the spectacle for attendees and TV viewers. The 2006–07 schedule was released on 7 July 2006, with the first race at Circuit Park Zandvoort on 1 October 2006, and the last race at Brands Hatch on 29 April 2007. New teams Team Singapore and Team Greece joined the competition but Team Turkey failed to secure funding for the season. Team Austria, Team Japan, Team Portugal and Team Russia did not return for the second season. However, after securing funding Team Portugal competed in the final four rounds of the second season in South Africa, Mexico, China and Britain. Team Germany won the series with 128 points, 35 points lead ahead of Team New Zealand.

On 29 September, Sheikh Maktoum announced he was resigning his position as chairman and chief executive of the series, seeking to have his place taken by increased shareholder interests:

Maktoum announced his intended resignation in September and his exit from the organisation was confirmed in December.

===Third season===

The 2007–08 season was the final season that used the Lola-Zytek A1GP car, with rule changes including two mandatory pit-stops in the Feature Race and an introduction of E30 biofuel as the cars&#x27; fuel. Team Switzerland was the winning team with Neel Jani behind the wheel.

===Fourth season===
In what proved to be the series&#x27; final season, the 2008–09 season was the only season in which the &quot;Powered by Ferrari&quot; A1GP car was used. According to 2007–08 champion Neel Jani, 90% of teams in the paddock warned Teixeira ahead of time that this car change was untimely and an inefficient use of funds. Rule changes included shorter qualifying sessions, a pit-stop during the now longer Sprint Race, removal of limits on Friday test drivers, and reduced Sprint Race points scoring.&lt;ref name=&quot;New 08/09 Rules&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the season, three rounds (in Italy, Indonesia, and Mexico) were cancelled for various reasons, and a proposed race in Brazil fell through. Team Ireland won the series with Ulsterman Adam Carroll.

===Fifth season (cancelled)===
The opening round of the season, scheduled as part of the already well established Nikon SuperGP race meeting, was cancelled five days before practice was due to begin. With cars and series infrastructure still tied up in London and no comment forthcoming from A1GP, organisers in Australia were forced to announce the series would not appear at what had been a high-profile addition to the A1 Grand Prix calendar. The event was underwritten by the Queensland state government, who mentioned the possibility of taking legal recourse against A1 Grand Prix.

The series was thrown into further doubt as more races were cancelled, with an announcement made on 5 November 2009 stating that the races in China and Malaysia would not be taking place. The last race that was to be held in the season, the Dutch round, was switched for Superleague Formula. This put an end to the hopes the season would start and also put the future of the series in doubt.

===Series collapse and liquidation===
Chairman Tony Teixeira announced in October 2007 that Italian manufacturer Ferrari would design and build the engines for six years, and that Ferrari would consult in the design and manufacture of the car. 
The Ferrari involvement was intended to ease some of the concerns regarding A1GP&#x27;s ongoing financial viability, the continued input of existing backers, and the platform&#x27;s ability to attract sponsors. CEO Pete da Silva reported a loss for the initial season, and yet RAB Capital paid $200 million to the exiting Dubai founder for his 80% stake. Before the 2008–09 &quot;Powered by Ferrari&quot; season was to begin, Bloomberg reported that RAB Capital announced that the A1GP investment had been written down for a third time. A1 Team Australia boss Alan Jones later suggested that &quot;it is common knowledge that Mr Teixeira bought RAB Capital out from A1GP&quot; before the current season, yet A1GP prominently displayed RAB Capital branding until A1GP discontinued racing operations in 2009.

Following doubts that the fifth season would go ahead due to financial constraints and reports that engine suppliers Ferrari would pull out over non-payments, Teixeira announced that the series had secured its long-term future, following a financial restructuring. As part of the restructuring, administration had been applied for the previously liquidated A1 Grand Prix Operations Ltd.

A dispute over the ownership of the series&#x27; cars was heard on 18 January 2010 at the High Court of Justice in London, with a judicial decision on 21 January 2010 ruling that the Administrator, Tim Bramston, had won the case with A1 Holdings. The assets were awarded to A1 Grand Prix Operations, and therefore Bramston became their administrator. Bramston said he was trying to secure the best price in liquidation and would not rule out a sale to an entity controlled by Teixeira.

RAB Capital&#x27;s Special Situations fund missed out on the market recovery of 2009 and its shareholders forced manager RAB to allow the entire fund to be put up for sale through a Dutch auction.

While the A1GP liquidators were apparently selling all intellectual property rights along with cars, it is unclear if a buyer was also expected to assume franchise agreements and financial obligations, or if the series and its necessary operating entities could be bought free and clear of any and all claims by Teixeira, Lyndhurst, and RAB. The liquidators appointed GoIndustry DoveBid to handle the sale of the assets, and the liquidators are seeking £10 million for the assets.

If a revival plan for the series could not be agreed with interested investment parties then the A1 Grand Prix assets were to be put up for auction.

===Rumoured revivals===
On 5 July 2010 Autosport magazine published in its &quot;rumours &amp; speculation&quot; blog that the series, in one form or another, was to be revived for a new 2011–12 season, citing an unidentified source who claims backing from a group of new investors. The season would constitute 18 countries making up the grid and ten race weekends, spread out either side of Christmas 2011, visiting many of the series&#x27; previous venues. The series would also run under a new model, similar to the GP2 Series whereby teams are responsible for finding their own funding.

In 2011 rumours surfaced of A1GP&#x27;s potential return with a new name. The series was to be called the A10 World Series, keeping the A1 from A1GP to signify the continuation of the idea. The series was billed as a Global single seater series with 600BHP V10 engines. A source told Autosport magazine that the A10 World Series would use A1GP&#x27;s idea of pitting countries against each other. However, the holding company for the series was formally dissolved in early 2012.

In 2014 ISRA (International Sport Racing Association) took 2005–08 A1 Grand Prix racing cars (Lola-Zytek) and created a single-seater competition named Formula Acceleration 1, which was part of Acceleration 2014.

In May 2015 AFRIX Motorsport of South Africa announced that they had purchased the remaining 21 &#x27;Powered by Ferrari&#x27; A1GP cars – together with their engines and spares, but less engine management electronics and steering wheels – from Delivered on Time, a freight company that had been granted a lien on the vehicles &quot;in lieu&quot; of unpaid bills. AFRIX stated that the cars were to form the basis for a one-make series to be run in South Africa during the southern hemisphere summer.

Announced in May 2023, A1GP was planned to make a return with a 100 million dollar funding.

===Champions===
==Teams==

Each A1 Grand Prix team represented a nation. Drivers must have the same nationality as the team they drove for. The team car should also represent the country. The team owner, principal and crew, however, did not need to have the same nationality as the team.

Twenty-nine nations started one race in A1GP – as in the table below:

==Drivers==

==Race weekend==
A1 Grands Prix of Nations took place over a three-day period, from Friday to Sunday. The teams were given five sets of dry weather slick tires, and two sets of wet weather treaded tires per weekend. However, if the weather was extreme, the team could be given more wet weather tires at the expense of the slick tires. The race weekend started with two one-hour practice sessions held on the Friday, and then another on the Saturday morning. A two-hour qualifying session took place on Saturday afternoon, and two races took place on Sunday. Primarily, the three practice sessions were for car setup and track familiarisation before the official competition began with Saturday qualifying. Three different drivers could participate in the three practice sessions; the driver elected for qualifying or for one of the races was required to have taken part in at least one such practice session.

===Qualifying===
A1 Grand Prix used a unique qualifying format, which began at 14:00 local time on the Saturday of the race weekend, to determine the grid lineup for Sunday&#x27;s races, the Sprint Race and the Main Race. The qualifying period was split into four, ten-minute sessions. Each car was permitted three laps per session, including the laps required for leaving the pits, and for re-entering it. This allowed one lap to set a competitive time. There was a five-minute break between sessions, which added up to a total of 55 minutes for qualifying. The grid for the Sprint Race was set based on the cars&#x27; fastest time from either the first or the second session. The grid for the Feature Race was determined the same way, but using sessions three and four. However, if there was a red flag due to an accident on the circuit, the timing to the end of qualifying continued to run.

===Sprint race===
The Sprint Race used the grid determined in sessions one and two of the previous day&#x27;s qualifying session, and was held in the early afternoon. The race began from a rolling start, and its duration was a maximum of 24 minutes plus one additional lap. Additionally, each team had to make one mandatory pit stop between laps four and eight. Drivers were permitted four uses of PowerBoost during the Sprint Race.

===Feature race===
The Feature Race used the grid determined in sessions three and four of the previous day&#x27;s qualifying session, and was held mid-afternoon. The race began from a standing start, and was a race of approximately , with a maximum time limit of 69 minutes plus one lap. Teams had to make two mandatory pit stops during the Feature Race, one between laps eight and sixteen, and another during a pit window, which was not announced until the first window has closed. Drivers were permitted eight uses of PowerBoost during the Feature Race.

====Pit stop====
Each team had to complete three compulsory pit stops over the course of the race weekend – one during the Sprint Race, and two during the Feature Race. During the pit stop, all four tyres on the car had to be changed. A total of eight mechanics could be used during the stop, however, only four were allowed to &#x27;touch the car&#x27;, none of which (save the so-called &quot;lollipop man&quot; that directed the car into its pit) could be present in the pit lane before the car came to a complete halt. Refuelling was also not permitted; infringements of these rules or of the pit-lane speed limit resulted in the imposition of a drive-through penalty.

At the end of Season 3, A1GP released the results of the season&#x27;s pit stop times. Although having never won a race, A1 Team Australia had the fastest pit crew of all teams.

===Scoring===
Unlike almost all other forms of auto racing, drivers did not score points individually; instead the points they earn were ascribed to their national team. This means that teams could change drivers between rounds, which was often necessary because some drivers had commitments in other formulae, and still accumulate points to their score.

Points were awarded for the first ten places but the amounts changed during the series&#x27; run: 15 for the winner, 12 for second place, 10 for third place, 8 for fourth place, 6 for fifth place, 5 for sixth place, and so on with 4, 3, 2, and one point for tenth place. Points were awarded in a different way for the Sprint Race: 10 for the winner, counting down 8, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 point for eighth place. In addition, one point was awarded to the team that set the fastest single lap time in either the Sprint or Main Race. Cash prizes were also awarded.

Below is a list of pointscoring systems used to determine the winner of the A1 Grand Prix World Cup of Motorsport since the 2005–06 season. The World Cup of Motorsport was awarded to the A1 Grand Prix team which accumulated the most points over the course of a season.

==Chassis and engines==

The A1GP formula provided a single &quot;spec&quot; car for each team. Each car was mechanically identical, built with many technical restrictions designed to limit performance, reduce running costs, and prevent any one or number of teams gaining an advantage through better equipment.

===First generation===

The Lola A1GP, chassis Lola B05/52, was used in the first three seasons. These chassis were fitted with 3.4-litre Zytek engines delivering up to in PowerBoost mode, and ran on Cooper tyres.

===Second generation===

A1GP partnered with Ferrari in the 2008–09 season to run upgraded Ferrari F2004 chassis, with the intention of using the cars for six seasons. The original 3.0L Ferrari V10 engine was replaced with a 4.5-litre Ferrari/Maserati V8 engine was capable of delivering up to in PowerBoost mode. Michelin took over the tyre contract for the final season.

==Broadcasters==
Richard Dorfman was the A1GP&#x27;s director of broadcasting.
All broadcaster information is correct for the 2008–09 season.
==Controversies==
===2006–07 A1 Grand Prix of Nations, Beijing, China===
The first Chinese round of the 2006–07 A1GP took place on the streets of Beijing. However, the tight hairpin at the end of the back straight was too tight for the cars to negotiate safely, as it was a 180 degree left turn. Cars were running wide and stopping mid corner; therefore, the sessions were red flagged.

A shorter circuit was created, creating another, less tight hairpin halfway up the straight, bypassing most of the old straight. This corner was still not ideal, as drivers ran wide despite the corner being wider and had to avoid the pitlane entry barrier. It had to suffice, though, as otherwise the race would have been cancelled.

However, another problem arose in qualifying when manhole covers on the roads were coming undone due to the racing cars&#x27; high downforce and low ride height. Grid positions were decided based on practice times. Some advertising banners also came loose around the circuit.

It was announced that the races would start behind the safety car, as the first corner was also deemed unsafe.

Both races were uneventful, particularly the Sprint Race, which took place almost entirely behind the safety car after course officials failed to remove a single spun car in a timely fashion.

<doc id="1029488" wikidata="Q7409861" url="?curid=1029488" title="Sammy White (baseball)">
<text>Sammy Charles White (July 7, 1927 – August 4, 1991) was an American Major League Baseball catcher and right-handed batter who played with the Boston Red Sox (1951–59), Milwaukee Braves (1961) and Philadelphia Phillies (1962). He was a solid defensive catcher, with a good arm and the ability to get the most out of a Boston pitching staff that included Mel Parnell, Ellis Kinder, Bill Monbouquette, Mike Fornieles and Frank Sullivan.

White was born in Wenatchee, Washington. A college baseball player and All-American college basketball player at the University of Washington, he signed his first professional baseball contract with the Seattle Rainiers of the Pacific Coast League in 1949. After the 1949 minor league season ended, the Minneapolis Lakers asked White to join their National Basketball Association team. But the Red Sox, who had acquired White&#x27;s contract during 1949, were furious and prevented White from doing that.

On June 11, 1952, White hit a ninth-inning grand slam off of Satchel Paige, turning a 9–7 deficit into an 11–9 walk-off victory over the St. Louis Browns. After rounding third base, White dropped to the ground and crawled to home, kissing the plate. An All-Star in 1953, White enjoyed his best season with the bat in 1954, hitting .282 with 14 home runs and 75 runs batted in (RBIs). In a May 1, 1955, game against the Cleveland Indians, White ruined Bob Feller&#x27;s no-hitter with a single in the 7th inning. Feller posted a 2–0 shutout, and set a major league record with his 12th one-hitter in that game. After nine productive years in Boston, White was traded to the Cleveland Indians just before the outset of the 1960 season. But White balked at the trade (even though Cleveland was a pennant contender and the Red Sox were an also-ran at the time) and retired, sitting out the season. Granted his release, he played for the Braves in 1961, and finished his career with Philadelphia one year later, playing for a former Red Sox teammate, skipper Gene Mauch. In eleven seasons, he was a career .262 hitter with 66 homers and 421 RBIs in 1043 games.

During his career with the Red Sox, White was one of the players featured in the Norman Rockwell painting &quot;The Rookie&quot;. He also opened a bowling alley, Sammy White&#x27;s Brighton Bowl, a few miles from Fenway Park, and became a professional bowler. After baseball, White moved to Hanalei, Hawaii, where he became a professional golfer for the Princeville organization. He died in Princeville, Hawaii, at the age of 64.

;Highlights
*&quot;All-Star&quot; (1953)
*Became the only 20th-century player to score three runs in one inning (against the Detroit Tigers, on June 18, 1953, when the Red Sox scored a modern major league record 17 runs in one inning)
*Caught Mel Parnell&#x27;s no-hitter on July 14, 1956

<text>Red lemonade &quot;()&quot; is a soft drink sold in Ireland and regarded as distinctively a part of the cultural identity of Irish people.

Lemonade in Ireland traditionally comes in three varieties – red, brown and white. All three are lemon-flavoured, but there is a marked difference in taste between the varieties. Red lemonade is particularly associated with festive occasions, but can also be a folk remedy.

Red lemonade is drunk on its own and is also served as a mixer with spirits in Ireland, particularly in whiskey. Major brands of red lemonade include TK (formerly Taylor Keith), Country Spring, Finches, Nash&#x27;s, Maine, and C&amp;C. There was an urban myth that European Union authorities had banned red lemonade, but in fact the authorities had simply banned a cancer-causing dye.

<doc id="1029492" wikidata="Q1788296" url="?curid=1029492" title="Communist Party of Nepal (Marxist–Leninist–Maoist)">
<text>The Communist Party of Nepal (Marxist–Leninist–Maoist), abbreviated CPN (MLM), was a minor communist party in Nepal. The party was as founded in 1981 by Krishna Das Shrestha. Initially known as the Nepal Marxist-Leninist Party, Shrestha had broken away from the Bagmati District Committee, which functioned semiautonomously, of the Communist Party of Nepal in 1969. Krishna Das Shrestha was the party president.

During the 1990 popular uprising against the monarchy, the group formed part of the radical United National People&#x27;s Movement. In 1991, the party was one of the organizations that founded the Samyukta Jana Morcha but left it following the election.

CPN (MLM) took part in the Joint People&#x27;s Agitation Committee, which had called for a general strike on 6 April 1992. Violence erupted in the capital during the strike, and according to the human rights NGO HURON 14 people were killed in police firing. Ahead of the 1992 elections to local bodies, CPN (MLM) took part in forming a front together with the Samyukta Jana Morcha, Nepal Workers Peasants Party, Communist Party of Nepal (15 September 1949) and Nepal Communist League.

In 1996, CPN (MLM) denounced the Mahakali Treaty between India and Nepal. In the parliamentary elections in 1999, CPN (MLM) had put up three candidates. CPN (MLM) later joined the United Left Front, which demands a Constitutional Assembly as the solution to the political crisis. In 2005, CPN (MLM) merged with a splinter group, Nepal Samyabadi Party (Marksbadi-Leninbadi-Maobadi) of Nanda Kumar Prasai, and formed the Communist Party of Nepal (Marxist-Leninist-Maoist Centre). In 2009, CPN (MLM) merged with the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist).

<text>The Infiniti Q45 is a full-size, rear-drive, five-passenger luxury sedan (F-segment in Europe) marketed as the flagship model of Infiniti, Nissan&#x27;s luxury division — across three generations spanning model years 1989-2006.

The first generation Q45 (1989–1999) was based on the Nissan President; the second (1997–2000) and third (2002–2006) generations were rebadged variants of Nissan&#x27;s JDM Cima. Infiniti discontinued the Q45 after MY 2006.

== First generation (G50; 1989–1996)==
The first generation Q45 came to market in 1989 as a 1990 model with a high-output 4.5 L &quot;VH45DE&quot; DOHC 32V V8 engine rated at and in North American trim. All Q45s included a viscous limited-slip differential and a multi-link suspension at the front and rear. Nissan chose to position it as a luxurious performance sedan, installing technology that would achieve this purpose, and used the letter &quot;Q&quot; from the western tradition of the Q-car meant to imply that its unassuming appearance hid its performance capabilities. At launch, the sedan had a single option, the Touring Package, which added Nissan&#x27;s Super HICAS four-wheel steering system, a decklid spoiler, and alloy wheels.

In Japan, it was marketed as the Nissan Infiniti Q45, and was exclusive to &quot;Nissan Prince Store&quot; locations, as its platform twin the President was exclusive to &quot;Nissan Store&quot; locations. The G50 chassis continued in production in Japan until 2002 as the President in both regular and extended wheelbase versions. The Japanese version had many options that never appeared on the North American G50.

The contemporary upstart luxury marque Lexus (Toyota) had managed to challenge the established dominance of European full-size luxury cars with the LS 400, so the Q45 seemed poised for similar success with comparable specifications and price to the LS 400 while featuring more emphasis upon handling. However, the Q45 did not achieve similar sales volumes, which was attributed to the car&#x27;s unconventional styling, particularly the grille and lack of interior woodgrain or chrome trim. There was also an unusual advertising campaign which did not include actual photos or information about the car. By 1995, the price had risen to , slowing sales.

In 1993 the Infiniti brand was launched in Australia with the sole model on offer being the Q45. With a price of A$140,000, the Q45 sold poorly and the brand was subsequently withdrawn from the market in 1996.

===Design===
According to the design team, the Q45 was meant to &quot;express the Japanese concept of luxury&quot; by incorporating traditional Japanese craftsmanship; as initially released, there was no front grille and no wood paneling on the dashboard. Nissan received assistance from Poltrona Frau for the minimalist interior. A grille was added in 1993 and interior wood had appeared by 1995.

Nissan had launched a program called the &quot;901 Movement&quot; or &quot;901 Activity&quot; in 1985, with the goal of &quot;realizing the No. 1 operating performance in the world by 1990&quot;, making Nissan&#x27;s the best handling lineup in the industry. Other vehicles resulting from the &quot;901&quot; program included the 300ZX (Z32), Primera (P10), Silvia (S13), and Skyline (R32); the multi-link suspension of the Q45 was derived from the Z32.

In 1989 (as a 1990 model) &quot;Full-Active Suspension&quot; was introduced with the Q45a model, which employed 10 sensors sending signals to microprocessor-controlled one-way hydraulic actuators at each wheel, designed to reduce body roll, dive, and pitch. The suspension provides an active response to road features up to approximately 3 Hz, a limit imposed by minimizing the size of the additional hardware and power losses required to pressurize the hydraulic accumulator; it added and reduced fuel economy by 10%. The system was brought to the United States starting in 1990 for the 1991 model year. At about the same time, Toyota marketed a limited-production Celica Active Sports (ST183) in Japan with its Toyota Active Control Suspension. Mercedes-Benz also developed a similar system named Active Body Control, which was introduced a decade later in 1999 on the C215 CL-Class.

The Q45t model added Nissan&#x27;s Super HICAS four wheel steering system and firmer suspension. A trunklid spoiler was included, reducing drag. However, HICAS was deleted for the 1995 Q45t.

===Equipment===
Standard equipment included a Bose sound system, leather interior, power adjustable front passenger seats with two position memory feature that also electrically adjusted the steering wheel, exterior mirrors, one-touch power windows, digital climate control, and keyless entry system.

Revisions in 1993 included 17:1 steering (except on the Q45t, which retained the original 15.1:1 ratio), lower ratio 1st and 2nd gears, and a dynamically smooth suspension, thicker glass, keyless remote, auto-dim rear-view mirror, dipping side view mirrors, revised transmission heat exchanger and external ATF filter, revised oval intake ports and revised disc injectors, fog lights and metal-backed camshaft timing chain guides.

===Models===
Infiniti offered the Q45 in three trim levels: base, Q45t, and Q45a. All models featured a multi-link suspension at both the front and rear wheels, and the Q45t and Q45a added a rear stabilizer bar, with the Q45a model being larger in diameter; both models have a 1 mm smaller in diameter front sway bar, rear spoiler, BBS forged alloy wheels, 4-wheel steering.

Externally, the 1994 and later model year Q45 can be distinguished by a chrome grille. HICAS and the faster steering ratios was discontinued in the 1995 Q45t model and the Q45a model was not imported in 1996. 1996 models do not feature variable valve timing like the 1990-1995 models do. OBD-II was added for the 1996 model year.

== Second generation (Y33; 1997–2000)==
The second generation Q45 was a lightly revised variant of the Nissan Cima for the Japanese domestic market, which shared a common platform with the Cedric / Gloria (Y33 generation). For most of its vehicles, Infiniti uses a naming convention that combined a letter indicating the series or market position, followed by a two-digit number for engine displacement; for instance, the first generation Q45 (G50) name designates the flagship (Q-series) followed by 45 for its 4.5-liter V8; the second-generation Q45 was an exception (as was the QX4, derived from the contemporary Nissan Pathfinder), as it used a smaller &quot;VH41DE&quot; engine.

===Design===
Styling featured an inverse curve C-pillar, and a pronounced full-length horizontal character beltline. Despite the shorter wheelbase in the Y33 compared to the G50, rear legroom increased by ; however, the trunk was faulted by owners as being small, with a volume of . Standard features for the second-generation Q45 included traction control, leather interior with faux wood trim, single (later dual) zone climate control, Bose audio system with eight speakers and in-dash single disc CD player, auto dimming rear view mirror, automatic light on and delay off timer, steering wheel-mounted cruise control and head unit controls. Also standard was a memory system for the driver&#x27;s seat and steering wheel. Available options included an integrated satellite navigation system, 6-disc CD autochanger and heated seats.

The touring package, again badged as the Q45t, featured 17-inch wheels and tires, electronically modulated performance-tuned suspension, blackout grille, blackout headlight treatment, and performance style steering wheel.

The front suspension was changed to a MacPherson strut; rear suspension was similar to the G50, using a multilink design. The second generation Q45 (Y33) was equipped with a viscous LSD and electronic traction control as standard features. Compared to the first generation (G50), the Y33 was approximately lighter, and the steering ratio was slowed further, from 17.0:1 to 18.5:1. As &quot;Edmunds&quot; noted for the 1997 model year, &quot;The Q45 no longer has aspirations to be a sport sedan, its prime duties now are interstate cruising.&quot;

===Performance===
The Q45 (Y33) equipped with the &quot;VH41DE&quot; producing and was able to accelerate from 0 to in approximately 7.5 seconds.

===Updates===
The Q45 front and rear fascias were slightly revised for 1999; HID headlights and an analog clock became standard equipment. Five-spoke 17&quot; aluminum alloy wheels and an electronic adjustable suspension became standard on the Q45t.

The Q45 Anniversary Edition, limited to 3,000 units, offered highest trim level available for the second-generation Q45, available on 2000 models and standard on the 2001 models. The package included all features of the Q45t model along with &quot;Anniversary Edition&quot; markings on the tailgate badge, ignition key, front seat embossing and floor mats as well as genuine wood trim, wood tone/leather steering wheel, special bright machine finish 17-inch performance wheels and exclusive body color door handles.

== Third generation (F50; 2001–2006)==

Introduced at the 2000 New York Auto Show, the third generation Q45 (F50) was, like the preceding Q45 (Y33), based on the JDM Cima and was powered by a new twin-cam 4.5 L &quot;VK45DE&quot; V8 engine using a 5-speed automatic transmission with overdrive. Marketing began in April 2001, for the 2002 model year, at a starting MSRP of . The Q45 was noted for its distinctive &quot;gatling gun&quot; style HID headlights with 11 bulbs on each side, including seven for the HID low-beam xenon headlights.

At its introduction, Brock Yates, writing for &quot;Car and Driver&quot;, compared the third generation Q45 against close market competitors, calling it a &quot;superbly refined, comfortable, and distinctive machine.&quot;

===Design and features===
Development began in 1996, with exterior designs by Mamori Aoki frozen in 1998 and patented in March 2000. Aoki said the styling was meant to evoke &quot;a driver&#x27;s car, not a chauffeur-driven limousine.&quot; 

Assembled In Tochigi, Japan, the third generation Q45 (F50) was wider, with a longer wheelbase and a larger interior volume than its prior generation (Y33). Torsional rigidity was improved by 40%. The suspension used front struts and multi-link rear, with anti-roll bars front and rear.

The third generation Q45 was the first Infiniti with a laser-based autonomous cruise control system. Standard equipment included a leather interior, power sunroof, 8-way power front seats, remote keyless entry, rain-detecting wipers, tire pressure monitoring system and side curtain airbags. The center console features two sizes of concealed cup holders and a hatch under the armrest and a second, deeper compartment. Standard electronics include: CD, 8 speaker Bose audio system, trip computer, rear view parking camera system, and voice-activated navigation system with &quot;plan&quot; (standard map-like view) and &quot;bird&#x27;s eye&quot; (three-dimensional) display modes. The voice recognition, by Visteon, is trained to recognize 50,000 words in 150 dialects. The 2002 Q45 was the first vehicle ever to offer voice-controlled navigation and a reverse parking camera outside Japan, following the JDM 1991 Toyota Soarer. Bodywork seated five passengers with an aerodynamic drag coefficient of 0.30. 

The optional Premium Package included adjustable suspension, 18-inch 8-spoke titanium-color sport alloy wheels, 245/45R18 V-rated tires, rear monitor, rear power sunshade and rear door manual sunshades, climate controlled front seats with heating and cooling functions and perforated leather inserts, navigation system with 7.0-inch LCD display, Intelligent Cruise Control, satellite radio, auto open/close trunk, heated power-reclining rear seats with memory, rear controls for audio and HVAC and rear HVAC vents in B-pillar and front seatback grips — and available chrome-finished 18-inch wheels in place of the titanium wheels.

===Performance===
The &quot;VK45DE&quot; has a maximum output of and , motivating the Q45 (F50) sedan from 0 to in 6.0 seconds.

===Updates===
The 2003 model received a revised security system, numerically higher final drive ratio (for better acceleration - decreased highway fuel economy), reprogrammed TCU, and a mid-year satellite radio option. The CD changer could load CDs directly at the dashboard head unit.

For 2005, the Q45 received a mild facelift, with revised front and rear fascias; hood; grille; trunk decklid and finisher; headlights; side, front and rear chrome accent trim; and integrated fog lights and LED taillights. The interior featured re-contoured double-stitched seating, all white luminescent gauge markings, genuine metal knobs for accessory controls, a darker shade of maple interior trim, recalibrated transmission and new 17&quot; alloy wheels. 1129 Q45s were marketed in the United States for 2005.

==Replacement==
Infiniti discontinued marketing the Q45 in the USA after model year 2006, its flagship position assumed by a newly redesigned Infiniti M35/45, an mid-luxury (executive) car shorter in length than the Q45, though with greater interior room and performance, as well as featuring a rear multilink suspension and front double wishbone.

A new Infiniti flagship was anticipated by the end of the 2000s decade. According to Mark Igo, the general manager of Infiniti North America, &quot;the new Q will make the brand better, but it is questionable whether it will be very profitable&quot;.

Infiniti introduced the next iteration of its flagship, the Y51 series Infiniti M37/56/Nissan Fuga in November 2009. Continuing as a mid-luxury car, the new Infiniti M is only shorter than the final generation Q45, with the same width dimensions of and height of compared to the F50 series Cima of height.

By August 2010 the Nissan Cima, on which the final generation Q45 essentially was based, had been discontinued in Japan, along with its Nissan President sibling. This made the second generation Nissan Fuga the marque&#x27;s top-of-the-line flagship sedan. When the Fuga assumed the role as flagship sedan of Nissan Japan August 2010, it became the first time that Nissan didn&#x27;t sell a premium luxury V8 sedan in Japan, although the Fuga&#x27;s North American cousin, the Infiniti M56, is offered with a V8 shared with the Infiniti QX56.

In May 2012, Nissan released a new version of the Cima in Japan, based on the Fuga Hybrid (Infiniti M35h).

On 17 December 2012, Infiniti announced that all of its future sedan offerings will use the Q prefix, starting from the Q50 as a G37 replacement, Q70 for its M35/45/56 replacement, and a rumored Q80 for the new flagship model.

<text>CBC News is the division of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation responsible for the news gathering and production of news programs on the corporation&#x27;s English-language operations, namely CBC Television, CBC Radio, CBC News Network, and CBC.ca. Founded in 1941 by the public broadcaster, CBC News is the largest news broadcaster in Canada and has local, regional, and national broadcasts and stations. It frequently collaborates with its organizationally separate French-language counterpart, Radio-Canada Info.

==History==
The first CBC newscast was a bilingual radio report on November 2, 1936. The CBC News Service was inaugurated during World War II on January 1, 1941, when Dan McArthur, chief news editor, had Wells Ritchie prepare for the announcer Charles Jennings a national report at 8:00 pm. Previously, CBC relied on The Canadian Press to provide it with wire copy for its news bulletins. Readers who followed Jennings were Lorne Greene, Frank Herbert and Earl Cameron. &quot;CBC News Roundup&quot; (French counterpart: &quot;La revue de l&#x27;actualité&quot;) started on August 16, 1943, at 7:45 pm, being replaced by &quot;The World at Six&quot; on October 31, 1966.

On English-language television the first newscast, part of &quot;CBC Newsmagazine&quot;, was given on September 8, 1952, on CBLT (Toronto), the only English station then telecasting. Later that year &quot;CBC National News&quot; was introduced (anchors: Larry Henderson, Earl Cameron, Stanley Burke), then changing its name to &quot;The National&quot; in 1970.

The CBC began delivering news online in 1996 via the Newsworld Online website. The CBC News Online site launched in 1998. In 2017, CBC News relaunched its flagship newscast, &quot;The National&quot;, with four co-anchors based in Toronto, Ottawa and Vancouver and later two anchors Monday through Thursday and a single anchor on Friday and Sunday.

==News output==
In November 2023, the CBC joined with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, and 69 media partners including Distributed Denial of Secrets and the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) and more than 270 journalists in 55 countries and territories to produce the &#x27;Cyprus Confidential&#x27; report on the financial network which supports the regime of Vladimir Putin, mostly with connections to Cyprus, and showed Cyprus to have strong links with high-up figures in the Kremlin, some of whom have been sanctioned. Government officials including Cyprus president Nikos Christodoulides and European lawmakers began responding to the investigation&#x27;s findings in less than 24 hours, calling for reforms and launching probes.

===Television===

The Television News section of CBC News is responsible for the news programs on CBC Television and CBC News Network, including national news programs like &quot;The National&quot;, &quot;Marketplace&quot;, &quot;The Fifth Estate&quot;, and &quot;The Investigators&quot; with Diana Swain. It is also responsible for &quot;The Weekly with Wendy Mesley&quot; until its cancellation in September 2020. They are also responsible for news, business, weather and sports information for Air Canada&#x27;s inflight entertainment.

====Local====

Most local newscasts on CBC Television are branded as &quot;CBC News: [city/province name]&quot;, such as &quot;CBC News: Toronto at Six&quot;. Local radio newscasts are heard on the half-hour during morning and afternoon drive shows and on the hour at other times during the day.

===Radio===

The Radio News section of CBC News produces on-the-hour updates for the CBC&#x27;s national radio newscasts and provides content for regional updates. Major radio programs include &quot;World Report&quot;, &quot;The World at Six&quot;, &quot;The World This Hour&quot; and &quot;The World this Weekend&quot;. The majority of news and information is aired on CBC Radio One. All newscasts are available on demand online, via apps or via voice-activated virtual assistants.

===Online===
CBC News Online is the CBC&#x27;s CBC.ca news website. Launched in 1996, it was named one of the most popular news websites in Canada in 2012. The website provides regional, national, and international news coverage, and investigative, politics, business, arts and entertainment, investigative, politics, business, entertainment, Indigenous, health, science and tech news. An Opinion section was reintroduced in November 2016. Many reports are accompanied by podcasting, audio and video from the CBC&#x27;s television and radio news services. CBC News content is available on multiple platforms including Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

In November 2022, the CBC launched CBC News Explore, a free ad-supported streaming television service. In addition to existing CBC news and information programming, new original programming on the service includes &quot;About That&quot;, a daily news and interview show hosted by Andrew Chang; &quot;Planet Wonder&quot;, an environmental news series hosted by Johanna Wagstaffe; &quot;Big&quot;, a documentary series about industry; and &quot;This Week in Canada&quot;, which highlights local news stories from the CBC&#x27;s local news bureaux in various cities.

=== Network ===
CBC News Network (formerly CBC Newsworld) is an English-language news channel owned and operated by the CBC. It began broadcasting on July 31, 1989, from several regional studios in Halifax, Toronto, Winnipeg and Calgary. It was revamped and relaunched as the CBC News Network in 2009 as part of a larger renewal of the CBC News division. Current programs include &quot;CBC News Now&quot; (based in Toronto with Heather Hiscox, Suhana Meharchand, Carole MacNeil, John Northcott, Andrew Nichols (weekdays) and Aarti Pole and Michael Serapio (weekends), &quot;Power &amp; Politics&quot; (based in Ottawa with host David Cochrane), and &quot;The National&quot; (with Adrienne Arsenault (Toronto), Ian Hanomansing (Vancouver) and Rosemary Barton hosting the weekly &quot;At Issue&quot; panel (Ottawa)). The network dropped the four-anchor format on January 22, 2020, and had Arsenault and Chang co-anchor from Monday through Thursday with Hanomansing as solo anchor for the Friday and Sunday editions. Barton became the chief political correspondent for CBC News; she continues to host &quot;The National&quot;&#x27;s weekly &quot;At Issue&quot; political panel along with her own politics based program, &quot;Rosemary Barton Live&quot; which airs on Sundays. In early 2023, CBC dropped the co-anchor format in favour of single anchor everyday. Adrienne Arsenault continues to host the show Monday through Thursday with Hanomansing hosting on Friday and Sunday.

===Weather centre===
In November 2005, the CBC News Weather Centre was established to cover local and international weather, using in part data provided by Environment Canada. Claire Martin was hired to serve as the primary face of the Weather Centre.

In April 2014, the national weather centre was effectively disbanded due to CBC budget cuts (Martin had left the CBC a few months prior). Weather presenters at local CBC stations were retained but with the added responsibility of supplying reports for &quot;The National&quot; and CBC News Network.

In November 2014, citing difficulties implementing this new system, the CBC announced a one-year trial content sharing partnership with The Weather Network, the privately owned cable specialty channel, which went into effect on December 8. Under the partnership, in exchange for access to weather-related news coverage from the CBC, The Weather Network provides the national weather reports seen on &quot;The National&quot; and CBCNN daytime programming, as well as local forecasts for CBC Toronto&#x27;s weekend newscasts. Apart from Toronto, weather coverage during local newscasts was not affected, and CBC Vancouver meteorologist Johanna Wagstaffe continues to provide weather coverage for the Vancouver-based (primetime) editions of &quot;CBC News Now&quot; on CBC News Network.

Most local CBC stations have retained their weather team to provide local weather information, including:
* Johanna Wagstaffe – CBC Vancouver meteorologist
* John Sauder – CBC Manitoba meteorologist
* Jay Scotland – CBC PEI meteorologist
* Karen Johnson – CBC Toronto and Windsor weather specialist
* Catherine Verdon-Diamond – CBC Montreal weather specialist
* Tanara McLean – CBC Edmonton/Calgary weather specialist

The content partnership with the Weather Network has continued beyond the original one-year period, and has been expanded. The weather section of CBC.ca has been phased out in favour of forecasts from The Weather Network, and local CBC news headlines are displayed on the latter&#x27;s website.

==Bias allegations==
Public surveys in 2002 suggest that the CBC was viewed with potential left-wing bias. 

In 2009, CBC President Hubert Lacroix commissioned a study to determine whether its news was biased, and if so, to what extent. He said: &quot;Our job — and we take it seriously — is to ensure that the information that we put out is fair and unbiased in everything that we do.&quot; The study suggests Canadians perceived the CBC as having a more left-of-centre bias than other Canadian news organizations.

A 2017 survey of Canadians suggested that CBC TV was the most biased national news media outlet (perceived biased by 50% of Canadians overall, tied with &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;) followed closely by CBC Radio (perceived biased by 49% of Canadians overall). Respondents, especially those from Alberta, predominantly saw a bias towards CBC TV and radio coverage favouring the Liberal party, a view that held consistently across Conservative, Liberal and NDP voters.

== Hall of Fame ==
The CBC News Hall of Fame was established in 2015 to honour men and women who have shaped Canadian journalism. Located in CBC&#x27;s Toronto headquarters, inductees include:

* 2015 – Knowlton Nash
* 2016 – Joe Schlesinger
* 2017 – Barbara Frum
* 2018 – Trina McQueen
* 2019 – Matthew Halton and Peter Stursberg
* 2020 – Ernest Tucker
* 2021 – Rassi Nashalik

==Ombudsman==

The CBC sets out to maintain its accuracy, integrity and fairness in its journalism. As a Canadian institution and a press undertaking, the CBC set out the Journalistic Standards and Practices and works in compliance with these principles. Balanced viewpoints must be presented through on-the-air discussions. As it is with other public and private journalistic undertakings, credibility in the eyes of the general population is seen as the corporation&#x27;s most valuable asset. The CBC Ombudsman is completely independent of CBC program staff and management, reporting directly to the President of the CBC and, through the President, to the corporation&#x27;s board of directors.

<text>National Collector&#x27;s Mint, Inc. is a Westchester County, New York based company that sells privately produced coins, tokens, commemoratives, and collectibles. The company does not produce coins that are legal tender in the United States and they are not affiliated, endorsed, or licensed by the U.S. government or the United States Mint. However, the company does also act as a retailer, reselling government proof coins and other legal tender. The mint also creates non-currency coins for large corporations.

==9/11 coinage incident==
The company&#x27;s repeated attempts to profit from the 9/11 attacks led Senator Charles Schumer to refer to the company as a &quot;despicable scam.&quot; The company was penalized for fraud in 2004, when State Supreme Court Justice Thomas J. McNamara fined the National Collector&#x27;s Mint for engaging in false advertising and deceptive business practices when issuing their Freedom Tower Silver Dollar coins.

Sales of the Freedom Tower Silver Dollar coins were halted by a court order in October 2004 at the request of then New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer. The company received approval from the officials of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands to produce legal tender coinage on their behalf, but Spitzer noted the Commonwealth is not authorized to issue its own currency. It was also indicated that the exact amount of silver contained in the commemorative was not clear to customers. A judge ruled in 2004 the company was guilty of fraud, false advertising and deceptive business. Subsequent ads for the new Freedom Tower coins indicated the actual silver weight (45 mg, or 0.00145 troy oz.) rather than the thickness of silver in mils used.

Senator Charles Schumer and Representative Jerrold Nadler said the claim the silver was recovered from the vaults beneath the World Trade Center ruins cannot be substantiated and called on the Federal Trade Commission to stop National Collector&#x27;s Mint from selling the Sept. 11 coins, which are seen as taking sales away from an official Sept. 11 medal that benefits the National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum being built at the World Trade Center site.

In contrast to the NCM&#x27;s unsubstantiated claims, a sizeable number of coins that can be traced back to the WTC vaults exist; unlike the NCM&#x27;s offerings, these coins were certified and graded by PCGS, and profits from their sales were donated to recovery funds.

In 2013, the company settled out of court and agreed to pay a $750,000 fine to the FTC for misrepresenting the authenticity of their 9/11 products.

<doc id="1029502" wikidata="Q1397013" url="?curid=1029502" title="Farnsworth House">
<text>The Edith Farnsworth House, formerly the Farnsworth House, is a historical house designed and constructed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe between 1945 and 1951. The house was constructed as a one-room weekend retreat in a rural setting in Plano, Illinois, about 60 miles (96 km) southwest of Chicago&#x27;s downtown. The steel and glass house was commissioned by Edith Farnsworth.

Mies created a 1,500-square-foot (140 m2) structure that is widely recognized as an exemplar of International Style of architecture. The retreat was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2006, after being listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. The house is owned and operated as a house museum by the National Trust for Historic Preservation.

In celebration of the 2018 Illinois Bicentennial, the Farnsworth House was selected as one of the Illinois 200 great places by the American Institute of Architects Illinois component (AIA Illinois) and was recognized by &quot;USA Today Travel&quot; magazine, as one of AIA Illinois&#x27; selections for Illinois &quot;25 Must See Buildings&quot;.

==History==
Ludwig Mies van der Rohe was retained by Farnsworth to design a weekend retreat during a dinner party in 1945. The wealthy client wanted to build a very special work of modern architecture, however, toward the end of construction, a dispute arose between architect and client that interfered with completion of the building.

Farnsworth had purchased the wooded, nine-acre riverfront property from the publisher of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, Robert R. McCormick. Mies developed the design in time for it to be included in an exhibition on his work at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1947. After completion of design, the project was placed on hold awaiting an inheritance from an ailing aunt of Farnsworth. Mies was to act as the general contractor as well as architect. Work began in 1950 and was substantially completed in 1951. The commission was an ideal one for any architect, but was marred by a very publicized dispute between Farnsworth and Mies that began near the end of construction. The total cost of the house was $74,000 in 1951 ($734,635 in 2020 dollars). A cost overrun of $15,600 over the initially approved construction budget of $58,400, was due to escalating material prices resulting from inflationary commodities speculation (in anticipation of demand arising from the mobilization for the Korean War). Near the completion of construction, the architect filed a lawsuit for non-payment of $28,173 in construction costs. The owner then filed a counter suit for damages due to alleged malpractice. The architect&#x27;s attorneys proved that Farnsworth had approved the plans and budget increases, and the court ordered the owner to pay her bills. Farnsworth&#x27;s malpractice accusations were dismissed as unsubstantiated. It was a bitter and hollow victory for Mies, considering the painful publicity that followed.

Writing about the conflict in 1998, author Alice T. Friedman asserted that &quot;[t]here is no evidence to suggest that [Farnsworth] sought to have her behavior challenged by the &#x27;inner logic&#x27; of Mies&#x27;s unyielding architectural vision; on the contrary, she seems to have had a clear idea about how she wanted to live and she expected the architect to respect her views... [S]he soon discovered that what Mies wanted, and what he had thought he had found in her, was a patron who would put her budget and her needs aside in favor of his own goals and dreams as an architect.&quot;

==Encroachment and sale==
In 1968, the local highway department condemned a portion of the property adjoining the house for construction of a raised highway bridge over the Fox River, encroaching upon the original setting of the design. Farnsworth sued to stop the project, but lost the court case. She sold the house in 1972, retiring to her villa in Italy.

In 1972, the Edith Farnsworth House was purchased by British property magnate, art collector, and architectural aficionado Peter Palumbo. He removed the bronze screen enclosure of the porch, added air conditioning, electric heat, extensive landscaping, and his art collections to the grounds, including sculptures by Andy Goldsworthy, Anthony Caro, and Richard Serra. At the time, the interior was furnished with furniture Mies designed in the 1930s, but produced more recently by Knoll, as well as designs by Mies&#x27; grandson, Dirk Lohan, a Chicago architect Palumbo commissioned specifically for the house.

In 2001, Palumbo struck a deal with the state of Illinois, which agreed to buy the house for $7 million and open it full-time to the public, but state officials withdrew from the deal in early 2003, saying $7 million was too much to spend at a time of financial crisis.

After owning the property for 31 years, Palumbo removed the art and put the property up for sale with Sotheby&#x27;s in 2003, raising serious concerns about the future of the building. Preservationists and contributors from around the world, including the Friends of the Farnsworth House, began a concerted preservation and fund-raising effort to keep the house on its original site. With this financial support, the National Trust for Historic Preservation and Landmarks Illinois were able to purchase the house in December 2003 for a reported $7.5 million. Now operated as a house museum, the Farnsworth House is open to the public, with tours conducted by the National Trust. The house is listed in the National Register and is designated a National Historic Landmark by the United States Department of the Interior.

==Configuration==
The essential characteristics of the house are immediately apparent. The extensive use of clear floor-to-ceiling glass opens the interior to its natural surroundings to an extreme degree. Two distinctly expressed horizontal slabs, which form the roof and the floor, sandwich an open space for living. The slab edges are defined by exposed steel structural members painted pure white. The house is elevated above a flood plain by eight wide flange steel columns which are attached to the sides of the floor and ceiling slabs. The slab ends extend beyond the column supports, creating cantilevers. A third floating slab, an attached terrace, acts as a transition between the living area and the ground. The house is accessed by two sets of wide steps connecting ground to terrace and then to porch.

Mies found the large open exhibit halls of the turn of the century to be very much in character with his sense of the industrial era. Here he applied the concept of an unobstructed space that is flexible for use by people. The interior appears to be a single open room, its space ebbing and flowing around two wood blocks; one a wardrobe cabinet and the other containing a kitchen, toilet, and fireplace block (the &quot;core&quot;). The larger fireplace-kitchen core seems to be a separate house nesting within the larger glass house. The building is essentially one large room filled with freestanding elements that provide subtle differentiation within an open space, implied but not dictated, zones for sleeping, cooking, dressing, eating, and sitting. Very private areas such as toilets, and mechanical rooms are enclosed within the core. Drawings recently made public by the Museum of Modern Art indicate that the architect provided ceiling details that allow for the addition of curtain tracks that would allow privacy separations of the open spaces into three &quot;rooms&quot;.

Mies applied this space concept, with variations, to his later buildings, most notably at Crown Hall, his Illinois Institute of Technology campus masterpiece. The notion of a single room that can be freely used or zoned in any way, with flexibility to accommodate changing uses, free of interior supports, enclosed in glass and supported by a minimum of structural framing located at the exterior, is the architectural ideal that defines Mies&#x27; American career. The Farnsworth House is significant as his first complete realization of this ideal, a prototype for his vision of what modern architecture in an era of technology should be.

==Architecture as an expression of the times==
The Farnsworth House addresses basic issues about the relationship between the individual and his society. Mies viewed the technology-driven modern era in which an ordinary individual exists as largely beyond one&#x27;s control. But he believed the individual can and should exist in harmony with the culture of one&#x27;s time for successful fulfillment. His career was a long and patient search for an architecture that would be a true expression of the essential soul of his epoch, the Holy Grail of German Modernism. He perceived our epoch as the era of industrial mass production, a civilization shaped by the forces of rapid technological development. Mies wanted to use architecture as a tool to help reconcile the individual spirit with the new mass society in which the individual exists.

His answer to the issue is to accept the need for an orderly framework as necessary for existence, while making space for the freedom needed by the individual human spirit to flourish. He created buildings with free and open space within a minimal framework, using expressed structural columns. He did not believe in the use of architecture for social engineering of human behavior, as many other modernists did, but his architecture does represent ideals and aspirations. His mature design work is a physical expression of his understanding of the modern epoch. He provides the occupants of his buildings with flexible and unobstructed space in which to fulfill themselves as individuals, despite their anonymous condition in the modern industrial culture. The materials of his buildings, industrial manufactured products such as mill-formed steel and plate glass, certainly represent the character of the modern era, but he counterbalances these with traditional luxuries such as Roman travertine and exotic wood veneers as valid parts of modern life. Mies accepted the problems of industrial society as facts to be dealt with, and offered his idealized vision of how technology may be made beautiful and support the individual as well. He suggests the downsides of technology, decried by late nineteenth century critics such as John Ruskin, can be solved with human creativity, and shows us how in the architecture of this house.

Reconnecting the individual with nature is one of the great challenges of an urbanized society. The rural site offered Mies an opportunity to bring the human relationship to nature into the forefront. Here he highlights the individual&#x27;s connection to nature through the medium of a synthetic shelter. Mies said: &quot;We should attempt to bring nature, houses, and the human being to a higher unity.” Glass walls and open interior space are the features that create an intense connection with the outdoor environment, while providing a framework reduces opaque exterior walls to a minimum. The careful site design and integration of the exterior environment represents a concerted effort to achieve an architecture wedded to its natural context.

Mies conceived the building as an indoor-outdoor architectural shelter simultaneously independent of and intertwined with the domain of nature. Mies did not build on the flood-free upland portions of the site, choosing instead to tempt the dangerous forces of nature by building directly on the flood plain near the edge of the river. Philip Johnson referred to this type of experience of nature as &quot;safe danger&quot;. The enclosed space and porch are elevated five feet on a raised floor platform, just slightly above the 100-year flood level, with a large intermediate terrace level.

The house has a distinctly independent personality, yet also evokes strong feelings of a connection to the land. The levels of the platforms restate the multiple levels of the site, in a kind of poetic architectural rhyme, not unlike the horizontal balconies and rocks do at Wright&#x27;s Fallingwater.

The house was anchored to the site in the cooling shadow of a large and majestic black maple (which was removed in 2013 due to age and damage). As Mies often did, the entrance is located on the sunny side, facing the river instead of the street, moving visitors around corners, and revealing views of the house and site from various angles as they approach the front door. The simple elongated cubic form of the house is parallel to the flow of the river, and the terrace platform is slipped downstream in relation to the elevated porch and living platform. Outdoor living spaces were designed to be extensions of the indoor space, with an open terrace and a screened porch (the screens have been removed). Yet the synthetic element always remains clearly distinct from the natural by its geometric forms that are highlighted by the choice of white as their primary color.

==Integration with nature==
=== Natural setting ===
The Farnsworth House sits isolated on a floodplain that faces the Fox River, establishing the architect&#x27;s concept of simple living. Open views from all sides of the building help enlarge the living space area and aid flow between the living space and its natural surroundings.

Due to the floodplain, the Farnsworth House stands as an independent structure; construction materials include steel, concrete, natural stone, and glass. The steel, painted white, creates the structure that supports the floor and ceiling slabs. They are composed of concrete, along with radiant coil set in the floor used for heating purposes. The remainder of the exterior consists of the 1/4-inch-thick glass panels serving as walls.

=== Flooding ===

Due to the Farnsworth House&#x27;s location in the Fox River floodplain, the site often experiences low-level flooding. Despite the precautions taken in the design, waters have risen substantially inside of the structure multiple times in excess of FEMA 500-year flood levels.

* 1954: three years after the completion of the House, flood waters rose over 2&#x27; in the interior living space.
* 1996: a Mesoscale Convective System with rainfall of over 16&quot; caused widespread flash flooding in the region. The water rose to over 5&#x27; on the interior of the Farnsworth House, causing significant damage to utilities, wood veneers, glass, and furnishings. 
* 1997: approximately 2&quot; of water made it into the interior of the structure. After this event, Peter Palumbo and Dirk Lohan embarked on a costly restoration project (estimated at $500,000).
* 2008: the house was flooded by rains from the remnants of Hurricane Ike. Water levels reached approximately above the floor and the stilts upon which the house rests. Much of the furniture was saved by elevating it above the flood waters. The house was closed to the public for the remainder of 2008 for repairs and reopened for public visitation in spring 2009.

The National Trust for Historic Preservation has been developing a flood mitigation plan to deal with the ongoing threat to the structure posed by the river.

== Other structures ==
=== Barnsworth Gallery ===
It was announced in 2011 that the Illinois Institute of Technology was going to build a permanent exhibition space for the wardrobe that Edith Farnsworth commissioned for the Farnsworth House. The wardrobe was extensively damaged in the 1996, 1997, and 2008 floods, with its large size rendering any possible evacuation attempt costly and difficult. In an attempt to protect the wardrobe, curators of the Farnsworth House decided to have the wardrobe put on permanent display near the visitor center on the site, which is well above the 500-year flood plain. Under the direction of Professor Frank Flury, students of the Illinois Institute of Technology designed and constructed the Barnsworth Gallery to house the wardrobe and serve as an exhibition space.

==Criticism and acclaim==
The building design received accolades in the architectural press, resulting in swarms of uninvited visitors trespassing on the property to glimpse this latest Mies building. As a result of the accusations contained in Edith Farnsworth&#x27;s lawsuit, the house soon became a prop in the larger national social conflicts of the McCarthy era. The weekend house became a lightning rod for anti-modernist publications, exemplified in the April 1953 issue of &quot;House Beautiful&quot;, which attacked it as a &quot;communist-inspired effort&quot; to supplant traditional American styles. Large areas of glass wall, flat roofs, purging of ornament, and a perceived lack of traditional warmth and coziness were characteristics of the International Style that were particular talking points of attack.

The poor energy efficiency of the Farnsworth House has been widely discussed as well. Farnsworth herself expressed dismay at the house&#x27;s poor temperature control and tendency to attract insects when illuminated at night.

Nonetheless, the Farnsworth House has continued to receive critical acclaim as a masterpiece of the modernist style, and Mies went on to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his contribution to American architecture and culture. Architect and critic Philip Johnson openly confessed how he was inspired by the design in the construction of his own Glass House in New Canaan, Connecticut in 1947 as his personal residence.
In the twenty-first century, Pulitzer Prize-winning architectural critics Paul Goldberger and Blair Kamin have both declared the house a masterpiece of modern architecture. Its timeless quality is reflected by the reverent fascination in the minimalist house shown by a new generation of design professionals and enthusiasts.

In 2021, the New York Times named it as one of the 25 most significant works of architecture since World War II.

==Rededication==
On November 17, 2021, Edith Farnsworth&#x27;s birthday, a rededication of the house on its 70th anniversary was livestreamed on its Facebook and Instagram pages, during which it was officially renamed the Edith Farnsworth House in recognition of its owner&#x27;s contribution to its benchmark design as well as her achievements as a research physician, classical violinist, poet, translator, and patron of the fine arts. &quot;We hope this seemingly simple act of inserting her first name has the larger effect of inserting her into the ongoing history of modern architecture,&quot; said Scott Mehaffey, executive director of the Edith Farnsworth House.

== In popular culture ==

June Finfer’s &quot;Glass House&quot; was produced in New York in 2010.

In 2016, the movie, &quot;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice&quot;, featured a house modeled after the Farnsworth House. The follow-up film &quot;Justice League&quot; also features the same house in a trailer released at the 2017 San Diego Comic-Con.

In January 2019, writer-director Richard Press and HanWay Films announced an upcoming Farnsworth House film project starring Elizabeth Debicki as Dr. Edith Farnsworth and Ralph Fiennes as Ludwig Mies van der Rohe.

<text>Mayenne (, ) is a commune in the Mayenne department, northwestern France. It is a subprefecture of the department. It is situated on the river Mayenne.

==History==
In medieval times, the town was the seat of the Lords of Mayenne. The town originated when Juhel II of Mayenne (lord of Mayenne, Gorron and Ambrières (1110–1161)) built a monastery near the gate of the pre-existing castle, which led to the formation of the settlement.

Mayenne was besieged twice during the French Wars of Religion, in 1574 and 1590, and suffered substantial damage. It was rebuilt and re-embellished in the following century thanks to the help of Cardinal Mazarin. It however suffered from plague in 1707.

On 9 June 1944, during World War II, it was bombed by the RAF, which caused heavy damage and numerous casualties.

==Population==

==Main sights==
* The Château, built in the 10th century (900–920) is an exceptional example of a palace dating from the Carolingian period. Reception room, tower and cellar are remarkably well preserved. The dungeon and ramparts, built in the 13th century to transform the castle into a fortress, still proudly dominate the river and the town of Mayenne. The vaulted rooms and the chapel still have thirteenth century decorations. The chapel dating from the 19th century with its baroque decoration bears witness to the long period of time he was a prison. Once used as a prison, since 2008 it is home to the &quot;Musée du Château de Mayenne&quot; (the Mayenne Castle Museum).
* The Basilica of Notre-Dame, founded in 1100. Of the original building, only the piers and the arcades of the nave remain.
* Romanesque church of St. Martin, enlarged in neo-medieval style during the nineteenth century.

==Notable people==
* Guy Chantepleure, writer

<doc id="1029526" wikidata="Q1796937" url="?curid=1029526" title="Grille (car)">
<text>In automotive engineering, a grille covers an opening in the body of a vehicle to allow air to enter or exit. Most vehicles feature a grille at the front of the vehicle to protect the radiator. Merriam-Webster describes grilles as &quot;a grating forming a barrier or screen; especially: an ornamental one at the front end of an automobile.&quot; The word &#x27;grille&#x27; is commonly misspelled as &#x27;grill&#x27; which instead refers to the cooking method. Other common grille locations include below the front bumper, in front of the wheels (to cool the brakes), in the cowl for cabin ventilation, or on the rear deck lid (in rear engine vehicles). Grilles evolved from previously installed gravel shields that were designed to protect exposed radiators typically used on cars until the early 1930s.

==Design==
The front fascia of a motor vehicle has an important role in attracting buyers. The principal function of the grille is to admit cooling air to the car&#x27;s radiator. However, the look of the vehicle &quot;matters a great deal more than whether the design features actually serve any function.&quot; As one of the main visual components on the front of vehicles, &quot;an inspired grille design makes a car attractive and shapes its identity by tying it to the carmaker&#x27;s history and reputation.&quot;

Currently, big grilles are primarily cosmetic. The grille is often a distinctive styling element, and many marques use it as their primary brand identifier. For example, Jeep has trademarked its seven-bar grille style.

Rolls-Royce is known for arranging its grille bars by hand to ensure that they appear perfectly vertical. Other makers known for their grille styling include Bugatti&#x27;s horse-collar, BMW&#x27;s split kidney, Rover&#x27;s chrome &quot;teeth&quot;, Mitsubishi&#x27;s forward swept, fighter aircraft-style grilles for their cars 2008 Lancer and Lancer Evo X, Dodge&#x27;s cross bar, Alfa Romeo&#x27;s six-bar shield, Volvo&#x27;s slash bar, Nissan&#x27;s trapezoid shaped chrome surround, Mazda&#x27;s rotary engine shape, Audi&#x27;s relatively new, so-called &quot;single-frame&quot; grille, Pontiac&#x27;s split horizontal grille and an egg-crate grille on late-generation Plymouths, and Lexus&#x27;s spindle-shaped grille. The unusual 1971 Plymouth Barracuda grille is known as a &quot;cheesegrater&quot;. Ford&#x27;s three-bar grille, introduced on the 2006 Fusion, has become distinctive as well. Porsche, a long-time manufacturer of air-cooled cars, continues to minimize the prominence of a &quot;grille&quot; on the marque&#x27;s modern water-cooled vehicles in keeping with that heritage.

The contrary styling pattern also occurs. Starting from the late 1930s, Cadillac would alternate its pattern from horizontal bars to various patterns of crosshatching as a simple way of making the car look new from year to year, for this make did not have a standard grille form. Sometimes there is a sort of fashion trend in grille bars. For example, in the early years after World War II, many American car makers generally switched to fewer and thicker grille bars.

A billet grille is an aftermarket part that is used to enhance the style or function of the original OEM grille. They are generally made from billet, solid bar stock aircraft-grade aluminum, although some are CNC machined from one solid sheet of aluminum.

Active Air Flap System was developed by Hyundai Mobis on June 17, 2021. Based on the existing radiator grille, the grille itself has evolved to move according to the cooling water temperature. When the engine coolant temperature is high, the air flap is opened to increase cooling efficiency through air suction. On the contrary, when the temperature drops, the air flap is automatically closed to reduce air resistance to increase fuel efficiency and electricity consumption.

Customizers would alter the grille as a matter of course in personalizing their car, taking the grille bar from another make, for example. Even sheet metal with patterned holes for ventilation grating sold to homeowners for repair has been found filling the grille opening of custom cars.

===Electric Vehicles===
The emergence of electric vehicles (EV) in the automotive market has prompted a fundamental reevaluation of grille design, as electric motors need little to no front vent cooling compared to a traditional combustion engine. Still, customer expectations of grilles dominating the front of cars have proven strong enough that companies like Nissan have reincorporated cosmetic grilles into their EV designs in response to mixed consumer reception of early grilleless models. Designs that fully do away with any visual reference to traditional front grilles have tended to come from new auto makers that exclusively produce EVs, such as Tesla, Inc. or Rivian, as these companies do not have an established historical brand language of grilles.

==Grille types==
Per mounting location on the car body:
* Radiator grille (front engine vehicle);
* Roof or trunk grilles (rear engine vehicles);
* Bumper skirt grilles (front and rear);
* Fender grilles (brake ventilation duct covers);
* Hood scoop grille (to allow intercooler air flow)

===Per style===
The American aftermarket restyling industry defines two major grille styles:
* OEM factory-style grilles – Such grilles have no difference with those manufactured by the automobile producers;
* Custom style – produced in small quantities and have an assortment of materials.

===Per fastening method===
* Bolt over style
In this installation method, the billet grille simply bolts over the existing OEM plastic grille. This method does not require drilling or cutting of the OEM grille shell. Hidden bolts, brackets and clamps are used for this simple installation. The downside is it may not look as clean as the replacement style, because you can still see the OEM grille underneath. Bolt overs should take no more than 30 minutes to install.

* Replacement style
The OEM grille must first be removed and then the replacement billet grille must be mounted in place of the OEM grille. Drilling and sometimes cutting is required for this method. Installation instructions are provided by the grille manufacturer, but are still a challenging job.

===History===

Grilles on automobiles have taken on different designs through the years. This feature first appeared on automobiles in 1903. Several years later, the arch-shaped design became common and became the standard design on automobile grilles for many years. The &quot;split&quot; grille design first appeared in 1923 on the Alfa Romeo sports car.

In the 1930s and 1940s, automobile manufacturers became creative with their grille designs. Some of these designs were bell-shaped (Buick, Chevrolet, and Pontiac), split and slightly folded (Silver Arrow, Mercury, 1946 Oldsmobile), cross-shaped (pre-war Studebaker Champion models, 1941 Cadillac, 1942 Ford), while some including Packard, Rolls-Royce, and MG-TC models still followed the older arch-shaped design.

Grilles took on a new look after World War II. Following the introduction of the 1947 Buick, Studebaker, and Kaiser, grilles became shorter and wider to accommodate for the change in design.

<text>Ye Shengtao (28 October 1894 – 16 February 1988) also known as Ye Shaojun, was a Chinese writer, journalist, educator, publisher and politician. He was a founder of the Association for Literary Studies (), the first literature association during the May Fourth Movement in China. He served as the Vice-Minister of Culture of the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

Throughout his life, he was dedicated to publishing and language education. He subscribed to the philosophy that &quot;Literature is for Life&quot; ().

== Educational and journalistic ideologies ==
=== Literature is for life (文學為人生) ===
Ye was passionate in reflecting the real life in his works:

== Contribution to literature ==

Ye discovered that many people in the New China were selfish, apathetic, hypocritical and conservative. People gave up their values in exchange for a stable life. Ye&#x27;s works shared a sense of irony. He expressed his discontent in a bid to arouse the awareness of the public towards these social weaknesses. Ye was not only writing stories, but also reporting the fallacies in society. His writings were not only for leisure but feeding the rest by knowing and reflecting the reality, &quot;...the basic requirement for writing fiction is a pair of penetrating and observant eyes and my eyes are not penetrating enough...Of course, it is not necessary to train one&#x27;s eyes just for the sake of writing but trained eyes do, in reality, nourish life.&quot; (Ye Shengtao, &#x27;Guoqu Suitan&#x27;, op. cit., p. 46.)

===Children&#x27;s literature: A mind training for the young===
Ye&#x27;s first academic essay was about children&#x27;s literature, called Children&#x27;s Concept (), criticizing how feudalism affected children&#x27;s lives in China.

In fact, Ye was the first writer who created fairy tales in the 1920s. His writing &quot;The Scarecrow&quot; (&quot;Dào cǎo rén &quot; 《稻草人》) was published in 1923. This children&#x27;s reading was very popular among numerous youngsters. Another &#x27;fairy tale was &quot;A Stone Figure of an Ancient Hero&quot;. (&quot;Gǔdāi yīngxióng de shíxiàng&quot; 《古代英雄的石像》) This story was about a stone which had been sculpted into a hero statue. The message behind this easy-to-read story was to ridicule the authorities who were arrogant and insensitive to his people.

<doc id="1029528" wikidata="Q181903" url="?curid=1029528" title="Algeria national football team">
<text>The Algeria national football team () represents Algeria in men&#x27;s international football, and is governed by the Algerian Football Federation. The team plays their home matches at the 5 July Stadium in Algiers and Miloud Hadefi Stadium in Oran. Algeria joined FIFA on 1 January 1964, a year and a half after gaining independence. They are the current champions of the FIFA Arab Cup.

The North African team has qualified for four World Cups in 1982, 1986, 2010 and 2014. Algeria has won the Africa Cup of Nations twice, once in 1990, when they hosted the tournament, and again in Egypt in 2019. They were also champions of the 2021 FIFA Arab Cup, the 1991 Afro-Asian Cup of Nations, the men&#x27;s football tournament of the 1978 All-Africa Games and the men&#x27;s football tournament of the 1975 Mediterranean Games.

The traditional rivals of Algeria are mainly: Egypt, Morocco, and Tunisia. Algeria has also had very competitive matches against Nigeria, especially in the 1980s during Algeria&#x27;s best football generation, against Mali due to sharing a common border and a long-standing competitive rivalry, and against Senegal, where Algeria&#x27;s first global success began. For the Algerians, their biggest victory on the world stage was their 2–1 win against West Germany during the 1982 FIFA World Cup in which the African nation shocked the world. Algeria has produced many talented players throughout its history and is considered one of the best teams in African football history. At the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, Algeria became the first African team to score at least four goals in a match at a World Cup, which was against South Korea.

==History==
===The ALN football team, 1957–1958===
On 1956, in Tunis, Tunisia, was formed the first team to represent Algeria, the Armée de Libération Nationale (ALN) team by Ahmed Benelfoul and Habib Draoua. The team was approved by the FLN in May 1957 and was managed by Salah Saidou and the player Abdelkader Zerrar was the captain. The first game was played on 1 June 1957 against Tunisia in the Stade Chedly Zouiten. In April 1958, the team was dissolved and was replaced by the FLN team.

===The FLN football team, 1958–1962===
The FLN football team was a team made up mainly of professional players in France, who then joined the Algerian independence movement of the National Liberation Front (FLN), and assisted in organizing football matches against national football teams. The FLN linked African football to anti-colonial resistance using the idea of Pan-Africanism as a legitimizing tool and symbol of national identity. The French authorities easily obtained the non-recognition of the team by FIFA.

===The Beginning, 1962===
Football in Algeria was established in the 1830s by European settlers bringing the sport to the country. The Algerian football team was established in 1962 after gaining independence from France, as the successor of the FLN football team. Under French rule, Algeria was not allowed to have a national team, the FLN football team was sort of a rebellion against the French colonization. All of their games were considered friendlies and were unrecognized by FIFA. During a press conference in Tunis, the Algerian football team refused to make any political statements, referring to football as a sport rather than a political influence. After the Algerian national football team was officially recognized by FIFA in 1963, the team only qualified to the 1968 Africa Cup of Nations and failed to qualify for the next five editions of the African cup until 1980.

===The best XI, 1980–1990===

====1982 FIFA World Cup====
Algeria caused one of the great World Cup upsets on the first day of the tournament with a 2–1 victory over current European champions West Germany. In the final match in the group between West Germany and Austria, with Algeria and Chile having already played their final group game the day before, the European teams knew that a West German win by 1 or 2 goals would qualify them both, while a larger West German victory would qualify Algeria over Austria, and a draw or an Austrian win would eliminate the West Germans. After 10 minutes of all-out attack, West Germany scored through a goal by Horst Hrubesch. After the goal was scored, the two teams kicked the ball around aimlessly for the rest of the match. Chants of &quot;Fuera, fuera&quot; (&quot;Out, out&quot;) were screamed by the Spanish crowd, while angry Algerian supporters waved banknotes at the players. This performance was widely deplored, even by the West German and Austrian fans. Algeria protested to FIFA, who ruled that the result be allowed to stand; FIFA introduced a revised qualification system at subsequent World Cups in which the final two games in each group were played simultaneously.

====1986 FIFA World Cup====

In 1984, Algeria took third place in the 1984 Africa Cup of Nations in Ivory Coast. During the 1986 Africa Cup of Nations, the national teams recorded two defeats and one draw and was eliminated in the first round. In Mexico, at the 1986 World Cup, the Algerians were not able to pass the first round once again in a group that included Northern Ireland (1–1 draw), Brazil (1–0 loss), and Spain (3–0 loss). Only one Algerian scored during this competition: Djamel Zidane. From thereon, Algeria failed to qualify for another World Cup until 2010.

====1990 African Cup of Nations====

In 1990, Algeria hosted the 1990 Africa Cup of Nations for the first time and were strongly considered to win the competition. drawn in Group A, the Algerians started the tournament by beating Nigeria 5–1, with doubles by Djamel Menad and Rabah Madjer and a goal by Djamel Amani. After a great start with a convincing victory against the Nigerians, they then beat Ivory Coast 3–0, with goals by Djamel Menad, Tahar Chérif El-Ouazzani, and Chérif Oudjani. The last game of the group, Algeria beat Egypt 2–0, with goals by Djamel Amani and Moussa Saïb. After a perfect start with three wins in as many games, Algeria beat Senegal 2–1 in the semi-finals after Djamel Menad and Djamel Amani scored in front of 85,000 fans in the Stade du 5 Juillet to reach the final for the second time in history. In the final against Nigeria, in front of 105,302 fans in the same stadium, Chérif Oudjani, in the 38th minute, enabled Algeria to win the African Cup of Nations for the first time. Djamel Menad was crowned top scorer of the competition with four goals.

===The dark years, 1992–2008===

After winning the 1990 African Cup of Nations and barely missing out in qualifying to the 1990 World Cup, Algerian football was still at its peak. However, with Algeria being on the brink of a civil war in the early 90s, social and political unrest started having a negative impact in every domain in the country including football. Although Algeria qualified to the 1992 African Cup of Nations, the title holders were disappointing and were eliminated in the first round of the competition.

In the 1994 African Cup of Nations Algeria was disqualified from the tournament after fielding an ineligible player, and many fans back home strongly criticized the staff of the team, accusing them of being irresponsible and unprofessional. In 1996, Algeria returned to African Cup of Nations, but were eliminated by hosts South Africa in the quarter-finals. The Algerians failed to qualify for the following World Cups in 1998, 2002 and 2006. During the 1998 African Cup of Nations, Algeria finished last in its group with three defeats and was eliminated in the group stage. Algerian football was losing its reputation and the team that was once considered one of the best teams in Africa, was no longer feared.

In the 2000 African Cup of Nations, the Fennecs passed the first round only to lose to 2–1 to eventual champions Cameroon in the quarter-finals. Algeria once more failed to pass the first round in the African competition in 2002. but in the 2004, Algeria, coached by Rabah Saadane were looking good and full of confidence, After drawing the first game of the group 1–1 against tournament favorites Cameroon, Algeria recorded a historic win against archrivals Egypt 2–1. After a good start by Algeria, the north African side surprisingly lost the last game of the group against Zimbabwe 2–1 However, because of the 2–1 victory against Egypt, Algeria finished second in their group and advanced to the next round. Their next opponent was Morocco and after a goalless game for over 80 minutes, Algeria took the lead in the 84th minute after a goal from Abdelmalek Cherrad, nearly seconds before the final whistle Morocco scored which meant the two sides would have to play in extra time, where Morocco would go on to win 3–1. The loss against their North African neighbors was heartbreaking, and after that game, Algeria failed to qualify for the following two Africa Cup of Nations in 2006 and 2008 and nothing seemed to be working for Algerian football.

===The return===

====2010 World Cup qualifiers====

On 11 October 2008, Algeria returned to the top 20 African teams in the Fifa ranking by finishing first in their group ahead of Senegal, Gambia, and Liberia for the second round in the combined 2010 World Cup and 2010 African Cup of Nations qualifications. In the third and final round of the qualifiers, Algeria was joined by Zambia, Rwanda, and Egypt in group C. Egypt was widely considered the favorites to win the group and qualify for the World Cup. However, in June 2009, Algeria beat the double African champions Egypt 3–1 which ultimately changed the teams objectives from just qualifying for the African Cup of Nations, to qualifying for the World Cup after a 24-year absence. The next game was against Zambia where the Desert Foxes won 2–0 in Lusaka. Algeria then again beat Zambia at home in Blida 1–0 followed by a 3–1 win against Rwanda, the Algerians ensured that the qualification for the World Cup would go down to the wire with a final encounter against Egypt in Cairo, where only a loss by three goals would stop the Fennecs from going to South Africa. Prior to the game, the Algerian team bus was attacked in Cairo by Egyptian fans, leaving several team members injured. This led to a diplomatic row between the two countries. The attack prior to the game left the Algerian players in shock which resulted in a 2–0 loss in a controversial situation, conceding a goal just within a couple seconds from the final whistle. The loss would mean that the two north African sides would have a to play a playoff game in Sudan with the winner qualifying to the world cup in South Africa. Algeria won 1–0 after a stunning goal from Anthar Yahia and qualified for the World Cup for the third time in their history.

====2010 Africa Cup of Nations====

After qualifying to the 2010 world cup at the expense of Egypt, Algeria was gaining back the respect that they lost in the early 90s. So they came in the 2010 tournament full of confidence. Being drawn in Group A, with Angola, Malawi, and Mali, Algeria started poorly, surprisingly losing 3–0 to group outsiders Malawi. After that loss Algeria had to prove that the first game was only a mistake and in the following game against Mali they won 1–0 thanks to a Rafik Halliche header. In the last match, they drew 0–0 with Angola, which sent them to the second round, finishing with the same number of points as Mali, but with a superior head-to-head record. Playing in Cabinda, Algeria faced Ivory Coast in the quarterfinals who were considered heavy favorites. After trailing 1–0, Karim Matmour equalized in the first half, the Algerians were having a great game but as the game was heading into extra time Keita gave the Ivorians the lead in the 89th minute, a goal which seemed sure to seal their victory. However, the Algerians equalized with Madjid Bougherra just 2 minutes later in added time, and in extra time a perfect Karim Ziani cross found Hamer Bouazza who gave the Fennecs the lead.
Algeria shocked the whole continent with a convincing win against a Cote Ivoire team that was considered the best in Africa. Next Algeria faced Egypt in the semi-finals, tensions were still high between the two nations after the World Cup qualification play-off incident and fans from both sides felt it was a must win game for them. Unfortunately for Algeria, things did not go as planned. After waves of controversial decisions from the referee for both sides, Algeria ended the game with 3 red cards which led to Egypt winning 4–0 which was the biggest defeat in the history of the teams&#x27; meetings. Algeria then lost 1–0 to Nigeria in the third-place game and finished fourth in the competition.

====2010 FIFA World Cup====

Algeria was drawn in Group C with England, USA, Slovenia. The north African side came in the tournament in poor form, losing nearly all their world cup preparation games in friendlies. In their first game they lost to Slovenia 0–1. The match was scoreless until Slovenia&#x27;s captain Robert Koren scored in the 79th minute after Abdelkader Ghezzal was sent off for his second bookable offence. In their second group game, Algeria drew with England leading to mass celebration throughout the world&#x27;s Algerian communities. The Fennecs lost their final group game to the United States 1–0 thanks to a Landon Donovan winner in second-half injury time. Algeria exited the championship as one of two teams, along with Honduras, to fail to score a goal.

====2010–11: A team in trouble====
After the World Cup, bad results were growing and growing with no wins. After a 2–1 home loss to Guinea in a friendly match and a 1–1 draw at home to Tanzania, veteran manager
Rabah Saâdane resigned and was replaced with Abdelhak Benchikha. The newly appointed coach tried to bring in new faces to the squad to bolster their offense but poor results continued for Benchikha&#x27;s side who started off with a 2–0 away loss to Central African Republic. There was a little bit of hope restored for the Algerians after they beat Morocco 1–0 at home after a goal from Hassan Yebda but After they lost 4–0 to Morocco in the return leg, their manager resigned. Algeria failed to qualify for the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations and the nightmare continued.

====2011–12: The arrival of Halilhodžić====
After new coach Vahid Halilhodžić was appointed, he got a few decent results before the start of the World cup qualifiers. The Bosnian coach&#x27;s debut resulted in a 1–1 away draw against Tanzania, they then beat Central African Republic 2–0 with goals coming from Hassan Yebda and Foued Kadir. After a good game against Tanzania and a convincing win against The Central African Rep, the Algerian fans started to believe in their national team again and put all their trust in coach Vahid to revive the national team, and that is exactly what happened as the good results kept on coming, Algeria then beat Niger 3–0 in a friendly, and with the start of the 2014 Fifa World Cup qualifiers Algeria beat Rwanda 4–0 to start off brightly. Qualifying for The 2013 African cup of Nations was the next target for Les Fennecs and they started off with beating Gambia 2–1 in Banjul followed by a 4–1 victory in Blida to advance to the final qualifying round, where the Algerians would take on north African neighbors Libya. The desert warriors ended up winning 3–0 on aggregate against the Libyans to qualify for the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations.

====2013 Africa Cup of Nations: Disappointing results====
Algeria arrived to the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations with plenty of confidence and with the emergence of Islam Slimani and El Arbi Hillel Soudani, as well as the addition to the squad of talented Valencia CF winger Sofiane Feghouli, Algeria was even considered one of the favorites to win the competition, but unfortunately for them they lacked experience and despite clear domination against their opponents, they finished last in their group after losing the first game against Tunisia 1–0 after a crucial 90&#x27;minute goal from Youssef Msakni. In their second game against Togo, Algeria was widely expected to come out with a victory but again the lack of experience was once again crucial, after dominating the game, they conceded two goals and were officially eliminated from the competition. The last game against Ivory Coast ended in a 2–2 draw. The Algerian fans were extremely disappointed with their team&#x27;s early exit from the competition, and the Algerian media even speculated coach Vahid would be sacked, but the president of the Algerian Football Federation decided to maintain Vahid.

====Road to Brazil 2014====
After a disappointing campaign in the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations, and the Algerian Football Federation confirming their manager&#x27;s stay. Algeria would then focus on their World cup qualifying campaign which they had a decent start to with one win and one loss, They continued their campaign winning 3–1 versus Benin at home and beating them again 3–1 away in Benin. After travelling to Kigali to face Rwanda, a 1–0 away victory guaranteed them the first-place position in their group which means they would advance to the final round of the qualifying campaign. Their last game didn&#x27;t have any effect on the standings but Algeria still won 1–0 versus Mali national football team. After topping group H, Algeria was drawn with Burkina Faso as their final opponent. The 1st leg was held in Burkina Faso and the second was in Algeria. The first leg ended in a highly-competitive 3–2 loss to Burkina Faso. The second leg was also a tightly contested, competitive match with Algeria managing a 1–0 victory to advance to the 2014 World Cup.

===Making history, 2014 FIFA World Cup===
Algeria were drawn in Group H with World Cup favorites Belgium, Russia, and South Korea. In their opening game against Belgium, Sofiane Feghouli scored Algeria&#x27;s first World Cup goal for 28 years giving his team the lead 1–0. Eventually, Belgium caught up and scored two goals to give themselves a 2–1 victory. In their second game against South Korea, the Algerians needed a strong win to have a good chance of going to the next round. They won 4–2, with Yacine Brahimi scored the fourth goal against the opposition to set a record of being the first African team to score four or more goals in a single match in the World Cup. On 26 June, Algeria played Russia for second place in Group H. Russia scored the opening goal but Islam Slimani became a hero by scoring the equalizer to carry Algeria to the second round of the World Cup for the first time. In the second round, Algeria was able to hold eventual champions Germany to a goalless draw for 90 minutes. In extra-time the Germans scored twice while Algeria scored a lone goal from Abdelmoumene Djabou. The match that ended in elimination for the Algerian team.

===Decline (2015–2018)===
After coach Vahid decided to opt out of a contract extension following their World Cup, Lorient coach Christian Gourcuff was appointed by FAF president Mohamed Raouraoua to help Algeria reach its goals.

====2015 Africa Cup of Nations====
After topping their 2015 Africa Cup of Nations qualification group which consisted of Mali, Malawi, and Ethiopia, Algeria were heavy favorites to win the 2015 edition of the tournament hosted in Equatorial Guinea. Algeria were drawn in a very group that included South Africa, Ghana, and Senegal. Algeria struggled in the first game against the South Africans and were a goal down before finally beating them 3–1. In the second game against Ghana, the Black Stars were in desperate need of a victory after losing the first game to Senegal, after 90 minutes, and while the game looked like it was heading to a goalless draw with neither side looking dangerous, Asamoah Gyan struck before the final whistle to give a 1–0 victory to Ghana. In the last game of the group against Senegal, Algeria looked better and after goals from Riyad Mahrez and youngster Nabil Bentaleb the Foxes were through to the next round. The Desert Foxes finished second in their group behind Ghana despite their goal difference due to their head-to-head record. Ivory Coast awaited them, where Wilfried Bony would score twice for an eventual 2–1 win for the Elephants, eliminating the Desert Foxes from the competition.

====2017–2018: Africa Cup of Nations and World Cup qualification====

Manager Christian Gourcuff was widely criticized after the African Cup exit, he continued being criticized for his tactics and results, losing 2–1 in a friendly against Guinea and drawing 2–2 Against Tanzania. Although Algeria would achieve wins at home, such as the 7–0 return leg win against Tanzania the team was very fragile on away games and conceded too many goals. The Tanzania win allowed them to reach the Final round of the 2018 World Cup qualifiers. Algeria were drawn in a group with Nigeria, Cameroon and Zambia with only the team finishing top of the group qualifying to the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

After a 3–3 away draw against Ethiopia, Manager Christian Gourcuff resigned from his position. Milovan Rajevac was then appointed manager in June 2016, but resigned 4 months later after Algeria&#x27;s first World cup qualifying game ended in a home draw against Cameroon. The Algerian Football federation then hired Georges Leekens who did no better than his predecessor by losing to Nigeria 3–1 during match day 2 of the World cup Qualifiers in November 2016.

Leekens then coached Algeria during the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations where the desert foxes had a horrible campaign drawing against Zimbabwe and Senegal and losing against Tunisia which resulted in an early group stage elimination. The African nation was on a steady decline and once again Algeria would get a new coach after Leekens resigned right after the African Cup and FAF president Raouraoua also left his position and was replaced by Kheiredine Zetchi. The new president came with new ideas, he brought in Spanish coach Lucas Alcaraz to try to kick start the national team once again, however the Spaniard was sacked after poor results which meant Algeria would miss the 2018 Fifa World cup. Missing the World cup was a huge upset in the country.

In November 2017, Former Algerian Superstar Rabah Madjer was appointed as manager, the decision to bring in Madjer was a controversial one as he hadn&#x27;t coached any team for over 10 years and did have a past failed coaching experience with Algeria. Madjer wouldn&#x27;t last very long either, after a couple of bad results in friendly matches including a 3–0 loss against Portugal, he would also be sacked after only 7 months in charge. Within four years of the end of the 2014 World cup, Algeria had five different coaches with the performances and results only getting worse.

===2019–2024: The Belmadi era===


After a slew of underperforming coaches, the federation appointed former Algerian international Djamel Belmadi on 2 August 2018. Belmadi was a young coach and had mainly previously coached in Qatar. However, due to his unsuccessful tenure with the Qatar national team, when they were eliminated early in the 2015 AFC Asian Cup, skepticism arose about the manager. Algeria&#x27;s performance in the 2019 AFCON qualification, while acceptable, also suffered setback, such as a shocking 0–1 away loss to Benin and two 1–1 draws to less known Gambia, raising big concerns over Algeria in the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations. Thus, Algeria was not expected to contend for the trophy, but was nonetheless expected to proceed at least to the quarter-finals. In spite of criticisms of Belmadi, Algeria topped group C won all three matches including a 1–0 victory over 2018 FIFA World Cup&#x27;s participant Senegal. Algeria&#x27;s solid performance continued with a 3–0 win over Guinea in the round of sixteen; before they overcame Ivory Coast in a hard-fought encounter which they won in a penalty shootout 4–3, after having drawn 1–1 after 120 minutes. The Algerians then went on to defeat Nigeria 2–1 with a dying minute&#x27;s free kick shot by Riyad Mahrez. Facing Senegal once again in the final, Baghdad Bounedjah scored the only goal of the game as Algeria won 1–0, earning them their second title since 1990. This made Algeria the second North African side after Egypt to win more than one AFCON trophy.

To continue off the high of the African Cup win, Algeria competed in the 2021 FIFA Arab Cup which was held in Qatar. As the tournament did not occur during the international break, Belmadi was unable to coach and national team veteran and assistant coach Madjid Bougherra filled in. Algeria managed to stay undefeated through the group stages. Their first match ended in a 4–0 win over Sudan with goals from Bounedjah, Benlamri, and Soudani. The second match against Lebanon ended in a 2–0 win with goals from Brahimi and Meziani. The last match for the top of Group D ended in a tie against Egypt, putting Egypt at the top of the group due to their fewer fouls throughout the tournament. This brought them to the knockout stages where they started with a match against Morocco. Brahimi scored off a penalty that was immediately equalized by Morocco&#x27;s Nahiri. After Belaili scored in overtime and Morocco equalized again, the game went onto a penalty shootout that ended in a 5–3 win for Algeria, moving them to the semi-finals against the host country, Qatar. Benlamri took the lead in the 59th minute but when the unnecessary 5 minutes of stoppage time extended to 7 minutes for Qatar to score off a corner, the game appeared to be heading into overtime. However, the referee kept the match going when Qatar regained possession beyond reason which backfired when Algeria made a counterattack that ultimately led to a free kick scored by Belaili at 90+17&#x27;, with the game concluding at a record 90+19&#x27;. The Arab Cup final against neighbours Tunisia ended regular time in a scoreless draw. In overtime, Algeria took the lead with a goal by Sayoud in the 99th minute. The match ended with Tunisia attempting to equalise on a corner and go into a penalty shootout. However, Tunisia missed the chance when Algeria gained possession for a counter-attack by Brahimi to conclude the match with a goal at 120+5&#x27; and winning the team another trophy.

AFCON 2022 came off to a rough start. Their first match against Sierra Leone ended in a scoreless draw for 1 point each. Their second match ended in their first loss since 2019 against Equatorial Guinea, losing 0–1, ending their 35-game unbeaten streak, 2 games away from the record held by Italy. The Algeria team suffered a defeat to Ivory Coast which led to their early exit at the group stages of the AFCON 2021.

<text>Sarkis Zeitlian (; 1930abducted on 28 March 1985) was a Lebanese Armenian journalist and political leader of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF). He was abducted on 28 March 1985 in West Beirut, Lebanon and presumably murdered under unknown circumstances. At the time of his abduction, Zeitlian was director of the ARF&#x27;s international media network. Zeitlian was a member of the Political Bureau of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation; the highest ranking subdivision of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation.

==Life==
Born in 1930, in Khdr Bek on the slopes of Musa Dagh, Zeitlian was part of a family that had participated in the famous defense of Musa Dagh against the Turkish genocidal onslaught during World War I. His grandmother, Varter, had fought beside the Armenian freedom fighters; his father, Tovmas was one of the youth who acted as messengers, and later, joining the Armenian company of the French Foreign Legion, had shared in the victory at the Battle of Arara in 1918.

Sarkis Zeitlian received his education first in Anjar, then in the Armenian monastic compound of Jerusalem, and finally at the Nshan Palanjian Jemaran or Academy in Beirut where he received his degree from the Armenian Studies Department. At the Jemaran, Zeitlian studied under such noted leaders of the First Armenian Republic (1918–1920) as Levon Shant, Nigol Aghpalian, Simon Vratsian, and Garo Sassouni.

In 1954, Zeitlian was sent to Cairo, Egypt, where he taught Armenian studies at Kalousdian Armenian School and joined the editorial staff of the ARF organ &quot;Housaper&quot;. In 1959, he was appointed editor of &quot;Housaper&quot;.

In 1957, Sarkis Zeitlian married his colleague at Kalousdian School, author Sona Simonian. In 1963, the Zeitlian family moved to Lebanon, where Sarkis became the Dean of Anjar&#x27;s Harach School. During his tenure, a high school and boarding facilities were added to the institution and its Alumni Association was formed. Sarkis Zeitlian also held important positions in the ARF․ As chairman of the party&#x27;s Anjar &quot;Red Mountain&quot; Committee, he supervised important community projects such as the reallocation of land and housing among townspeople.

In 1965, Sarkis Zeitlian moved with his family from Anjar to Beirut and became the editor of the ARF organ &quot;Aztag&quot;. He taught Armenian studies courses at the Nshan Palanjian Jemaran. From 1968 until his election to the ARF Bureau (the party&#x27;s highest decision-making body) in 1972, Sarkis Zeitlian was first a member and then chairman of the ARF Central Committee of Lebanon. Sarkis Zeitlian became the editor of the ARF Bureau organ Aztag Shapatoriag-Troshag in 1969.

===Lebanese civil war, disappearance and aftermath===
During the Lebanese Civil War, Sarkis Zeitlian played a decisive role. He helped develop and implement the &quot;positive neutrality&quot; policy of the ARF, and created and maintained a united Armenian front by forging an alliance of Lebanese Armenian political parties.

In the dire circumstances of Lebanon, despite sustaining material losses and fully aware of the many dangers he faces as an ARF political and community leader and the editor of the ARF Bureau organ, Sarkis Zeitlian remained on the political forefront in Lebanon. In 1978, during one of the most dangerous and chaotic stages of the civil war, when secret service organizations of foreign countries were operating freely, and especially when journalists were being killed or abducted for exercising free speech, Sarkis Zeitlian became Editor-in-Chief of Aztag Shapatoriag-Troshag, the ARF Bureau organ, set the policy and ideological guidelines of the ARF media worldwide, and took on other party responsibilities. His input was decisive during the work to revise the ARF Program at the party&#x27;s 21st and 22nd World Congresses. He stressed the importance of the fundamentally national-Armenian basis of the ARF ideology, despite the presence of a loud socialist internationalist faction within the party.

Sarkis Zeitlian was abducted in Beirut on 28 March 1985. It appears that he was killed by his abductors. However, the details remain mired in controversy.

Zeitlian&#x27;s daughter, Heghnar Zeitlian Watenpaugh, later became a historian specializing in Middle Eastern visual culture. There have been tributes made to him. as well.

<doc id="1029530" wikidata="Q1814596" url="?curid=1029530" title="Symphony-Concerto (Prokofiev)">
<text>Sergei Prokofiev&#x27;s Symphony-Concerto in E minor, Op. 125 (also widely referred to as Sinfonia Concertante) is a large-scale work for cello and orchestra.

The Symphony-Concerto was premiered on 18 February 1952 by Mstislav Rostropovich, to whom the work was dedicated. It was originally presented as Prokofiev&#x27;s Second Cello Concerto, but Prokofiev subsequently revised and changed its title. It is among Prokofiev&#x27;s final completed works.

==History==
Prokofiev began work on what would become the Symphony-Concerto after completing his Cello Sonata in 1949. The work was commissioned by Aleksandr Kholodilin, the head of the music division of the Committee on Artistic Affairs, with the completion date specified as 1 November 1951.

The work drew, in part, on material contained in Prokofiev&#x27;s earlier Cello Concerto, which was premiered in 1938. Drafts of the new work were provided to Rostropovich for technical correction and refinement.

The work was first performed, as Prokofiev&#x27;s Second Cello Concerto, on 18 February 1952 in Moscow, with Rostropovich as soloist and Sviatoslav Richter as conductor. Following a review by the Union of Soviet Composers, the concerto was further revised and retitled as the &quot;Симфония-концерт&quot; (commonly rendered in English as &quot;Symphony-Concerto&quot;). Prokofiev died before the final version was performed: the first performance of that version took place on 9 December 1954 with Rostropovich as soloist, accompanied by the Danish State Radio Symphony Orchestra under the direction of Thomas Jensen.

The Symphony-Concerto was one of several compositions for cello on which Prokofiev worked from the late 1940s until his death. In addition to the Cello Sonata, Prokofiev also commenced work on two unfinished works: a sonata for unaccompanied cello (for which he wrote 14 pages of sketches), and a Cello Concertino (later completed by Rostropovich).

==Music==
The work is scored for two flutes (second doubling piccolo), two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, four horns, two trumpets, three trombones, tuba, timpani, cymbals, tambourine, triangle, bass drum, snare drum, celesta, and strings. 

It has a typical performance duration of about 40 minutes and consists of three movements with the following tempo markings:
The piece is noted for its extreme difficulty due to the length of the concerto, runs, and high positions among many other technical difficulties. The end of the concerto requires the cellist to play off the fingerboard, reaching as high as an E7, the extreme upper limit of the cello&#x27;s range.

==Biography==

===Family===
Zheng Zhenduo was born on 19 December 1898 in Yongjia, Zhejiang Province. His ancestral home was in Changle, Fujian province. He was born in a poor family. Together with two younger sisters, he was raised by his mother because his father and grandfather died when he was still a teenager.

He was named &quot;Zhenduo&quot; (振鐸) by his grandfather. &quot;Zhen&quot; (振) denotes arousing an action and &quot;Duo&quot; (鐸) is a kind of big bell. His grandfather wanted him to ring like a great bell to summon and to arouse people. In addition, his grandfather gave him the childhood name &quot;Mu Guan&quot; (木官; lit. &#x27;Wooden official&#x27;).

===Schooling===
In 1917, Zheng began studying at the Beijing Railway Management School and graduated in March 1921. Beyond classroom, he read a lot of books and developed an enormous interest in social sciences, Chinese literature and Western literature and thus developed a critical mind. During the May Fourth Movement, he was a student representative, spreading the news of student movements in Beijing. In 1919, he helped publish two magazines called &quot;New Society&quot; (新社會; &quot;Xin Shehui&quot;) and &quot;National Salvation Speeches Weekly&quot; (救國講演周報; &quot;Jiuguo jiangyan zhoubao&quot;).

In January 1921, Zheng Zhenduo and twelve others, including Mao Dun and Ye Shengtao founded the earliest literary society of the New Literature Movement, Literary Research Association (文學研究會; &quot;Wenxue yanjiu hui&quot;; also known as the &quot;Literary Association&quot;), which advocated realism and opposed art for art&#x27;s sake.

===Careers throughout his life===
Zheng had been a journalist, a modern writer, archeology and a literature scholar throughout his life.

In May 1921, Zheng helped set up a drama society called &quot;Demotic Opera Troupe&quot; (民眾戲劇社; &quot;Minzhong Xiju She&quot;) with Mao Dun, Ye Shengtao, Chen Dabei, Ouyang Yuqian, Xiong Foxi and other writers. They published a monthly magazine named &quot;Drama&quot; (戲劇; &quot;Xiju&quot;) on 31 May in the same year.

In 1922, Zheng established the first magazine for children, &quot;Children&#x27;s World&quot; (兒童世界). In January 1923, he became the chief editor of a monthly magazine of novel, &quot;Fiction Monthly&quot;. After the May 30 Incident in 1925, he helped founding a newspaper called &quot;Gongli Ribao&quot; (公理日報). From then on, he wrote many books including &quot;Zhongguo Wenxue Shi&quot; (中國文學史; lit. &#x27;History of Chinese Literature&#x27;) and &quot;1943 Diary&quot; (1943年日記).

Zheng had been a scholar giving lectures in universities, a researcher of the academy and a journalist since 1931. He taught in the Department of Chinese in Yenching University, in Jinan University from 1935 to 1941 as the Dean of faculty of Arts and in Peking University since 1953. After 1949, he became the Secretary for the Culture Department and Cultural Heritage Department in China.

===Exile to France===
In April 1927, Chiang Kai-shek launched a sudden attack on thousands of suspected Communists in the area he controlled. Many innocent students and movement activists were killed. Writers, including Zheng, were under political pressure. Therefore, he left his family for France in May 1927. During the years living in Paris, he kept mailing his diary to his wife, which was published as a book named &quot;Diary of Travels in Europe&quot; (歐行日記; &quot;Ouxing Riji&quot;).

===Return to China===
He continued his journalistic career after coming back to China in 1929 and founded &quot;Jiuwang Ribao&quot; (救亡日報). In October 1945, he founded a weekly magazine called &quot;Democracy&quot; (民主) to oppose the civil war and Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s pro-American policy.

===Cultural Preservation===
Due to the invasion of Japanese troops, Shanghai was besieged starting from 1937 and many significant cultural assets were lost. In the light of this, Zheng devoted himself to the rescue and protection of aged Chinese documents and antiques. Chen was a founding member of the Shanghai &quot;Rare Book Preservation Society&quot; and its leader. Disguising himself as a staff member in a stationery store, named Chan Sixun (陳思訓), he managed to save many aged books from damage or loss to the outside world.

===Death===
On 17 October 1958, Zheng led national cultural delegates to visit Arabia and Afghanistan. He died in the crash of a Tupolev Tu-104 in Kanash, Chuvashia, Soviet Union during the journey.

==Journalism==
Zheng started his journalistic career in the 1920s during the May Fourth Movement. Together with some classmates including Zhong Tao (仲陶), he got a first taste of editing in starting a publication named &quot;Jiuguo Jiangyan Zhoukan&quot; (救國講演周刊). The magazine - being published in Wenzhou for only 6 to 7 times - was closed by the authorities since it enraged a government official.

As one of the founders of a youth magazine, &quot;Xin Shehui&quot; (新社會), Zheng aimed at criticizing the Beijing government. It began its publication on 1 November 1919, which consisted of four pages. The aims of the magazine was to:

#advocate the social service
#discuss society problems
#introduce social theories
#research on common people education
#record society matters
#criticize society shortcomings
#narrate society real states
#report news of the organization

Zheng gave many speeches about the student movement in Beijing. On top of criticizing, he wanted to make good use of the New Culture Movement to publicize and promote new social ideals for the Chinese future development. Chen Duxiu suggested that &quot;Xin Shehui&quot; could be edited with a more approachable style accepted by the general public. The magazine was finally published on 1 November 1919 throughout China, arousing tides of attention from the public, especially amongst the young readers. However, as Zheng and his co-editors were still inexperienced in editing by that time, the magazine was thought to be immature in editing and too sloganeered. On the hand, the content of the magazine upset the military side of the government. Thus, in one month&#x27;s time, the government called the publication to a halt.

In addition, he established &quot;Literary Study Society&quot; (文學研究會; &quot;Wenxue Yanjiu Hui&quot;) with Mao Dun and Ye Shengtao in November 1920. In January 1923, he took over the position of chief editor of &quot;Fiction Monthly&quot; from Mao Dun. He was the chief editor on and off for nearly 9 years. He advocated a literary advocacy of &quot;Blood and Tears&quot; and supported a writing style of realism.

In June 1925, he founded a newspaper called &quot;Kongli Ribao&quot; (公理日報) with Wu Yuzhi and Ye Shengtao in Shanghai. This newspaper was aimed at criticizing the &quot;May Thirtieth Incident&quot; and the rising foreign imperialism in China.

Also, he contributed in various newspapers like &quot;Jiuguo Jiangyan Zhoubao&quot; (救國講演周報) and &quot;Xinxue Bao&quot; (新學報) to awaken Chinese people from old traditions. These articles were mainly about social issues and the evil deeds of the old traditional practices. Zheng wrote articles from different aspects like the liberation of women, morality, social psychology and the liberation of political power. They all advocated more people to rethink the old values position.

==Contribution to literature==

===Translation===
Zheng was proficient in foreign languages including English, Russian, Indian languages, Greek and Latin. He did a great job in translating a lot of Russian and Indian literature.

Zheng had started translation of Russian literature since early 20s. His works included the works, paper and preface of Turgenev (1818-1883), Gogol (1809-1852), Chekov (1860-1904), Gorky (1868-1936) and Tolstoy (1828-1910).

Zheng also translated many Indian literature. He mainly translated the poems as well as the Indian ancient-times fable such as Rabindranath Tagore (1861-1941). Zheng had translated a prominent number of Tagore&#x27;s poems to Chinese since the 1920s. In October 1922, he published his translation of Stray Birds (飛鳥集). In August 1925, he published The Indian Fable (印度寓言). There were 55 translation works of his in total.

Zheng started his study in Greek and Roman literature in his early age. In 1929, he published &quot;The Story of Love&quot; (戀愛的故事). Afterwards he translated &quot;Heroes of Greek and Roman Mythology&quot; (希臘羅馬神話傳說中的英雄傳說). Then in 1935, he published a book called &quot;Greek Mythology&quot; (希臘神話), an analysis of Ancient Greek mythology. In a second edition of &quot;Greek Mythology&quot; published after the creation of the People&#x27;s Republic, his introduction included Karl Marx&#x27;s well-known &quot;A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy&quot;.

===Literature Union===
As the previous newspapers and magazines were banned by the government, Zheng believed that a proper established literature union would make things run easier. In January 1921, he established &quot;Wenxue Yanjiu Hui&quot; (&quot;Literary Study Society&quot; 文學研究會), which literally means literature research union, with Mao Dun, Ye Shengtao and 12 other people in the related field.

The Union&#x27;s first publication was &quot;Wenxue Xunkan&quot; (文學旬刊). It was published along with the well known newspaper called &quot;Shishi Xinbao&quot; (&quot;Current events newspaper&quot; 時事新報). He revealed the goal of the publication and the literature views of the union. He believed that literature is important and capable to influence the society. It was not merely an era, a place or one&#x27;s reflection, but it acted as a frontier, which could affect the morality of human beings. Also, he strongly opposed to the old style of Chinese literature, of setting leisure and religions as main themes. He supported the writing of life – one theme in new realism literature approach.

He also expressed his view on the development of Chinese literature. As the connection between the Chinese literature and the world&#x27;s literature was far too little, the Chinese lofty spirit could not be shared by the rest of the world. He treated that as the Chinese&#x27;s biggest humiliation. Therefore, he was so devoted in the field of literature, eagered to strive for a higher position of the Chinese literature in the world. Under the influence of the May Fourth Movement, he thought that the major responstility of the Chinese Literature was to inspire youngsters&#x27; revolutionary mission in order to strengthen the power of China.

===Realism===
Within the May Fourth movement, he adhered the direction of realism for New literature era. He thought literature liked &#x27;mirror of a life&#x27;. This means his writing mostly revealed the real faces of societies. Also, he put a lot of emphasis on the importance of creative living. During his long composing and researching career, he showed a fully comprehensive realism of literature. He thought that literature must contribute to &quot;life&quot;:

:We need the &quot;blood&quot; of literature, &quot;tears&quot; of literature. Both of them will become the trend of Chinese literature; the writing consists of not only &quot;blood&quot; and &quot;tears&quot;, but also consists of &quot;literature&quot;; the &quot;blood&quot; and &quot;tears&quot; experience and feeling of author are aesthetic for success in writing.

Literature should consist of the highest ideal of the author, which form the soul of the article, in order to make it meaningful to the readers and the whole of society.

===Classical literature===
Starting from the late 1920s, Zheng was teaching Chinese literature History in universities. At that time, he did much in making research in Chinese classical writing. For example, he used his pen name, Bao Fun, to write &quot;Yuenqu Xulu&quot; (元曲敍錄) in the &quot;Novel Monthly&quot; (小說月報). Also, he finished editing &quot;The History of the Chinese Literature&quot; (中國文學史) in 1930.

===Romanticism===
Zheng put heavy emphasis on emotional elements in literature, highlighting its importance in distinguishing between literature and science. He advocated that literature functions to instill a passion in the readers&#x27; heart. One example was the historical novel, &quot;Arrest of the Fire Stealer&quot; (取火者的逮捕).

<doc id="1029537" wikidata="Q456122" url="?curid=1029537" title="Alexandre de Beauharnais">
<text>Alexandre François Marie, Viscount of Beauharnais (; 28 May 1760 – 23 July 1794) was a French politician and general of the French Revolution. He was the first husband of Joséphine Tascher de La Pagerie, who later married Napoleon Bonaparte and became empress of France. Beauharnais was executed by guillotine during the Reign of Terror.

==Family==
Beauharnais was born to the noble Beauharnais family in Fort-Royal (now Fort-de-France), Martinique, in the French West Indies. He was the son of Governor François de Beauharnais, Marquis de la La Ferté-Beauharnais, and Marie Anne Henriette Françoise Pyvart de Chastullé. On 13 December 1779 in Paris, he married Joséphine Tascher de la Pagerie, the future Empress of France. They had two children, Eugène (1781–1824) and Hortense (1783–1837).

==Career==
Beauharnais began his military career in an infantry regiment at Martinique. He served in the American Revolutionary War under the Count of Rochambeau, and became acquainted with the court of King Louis XVI upon his return to France. A supporter of the French Revolution, Beauharnais was elected a deputy of the nobility to the Estates-General of 1789, where he was one of the first nobles to go over to the Third Estate, and voted in favor of the abolition of feudalism.

Beauharnais played a prominent role in the succeeding National Constituent Assembly, serving as its president from 19 June to 3 July 1791 and from 31 July to 14 August 1791. He then returned to the army with the rank of colonel, and was employed in the Army of the North. Promoted to general in 1792, at the start of the French Revolutionary Wars, Beauharnais refused in June 1793 the post of Minister of War. He was appointed commander-in-chief of the Army of the Rhine in 1793.

==Death==
On 2 March 1794, the Committee of General Security ordered his arrest. Accused of having poorly defended Mainz during the siege in 1793, and considered an aristocratic suspect, he was jailed in Carmes Prison and sentenced to death during the Reign of Terror. His wife, Joséphine, was jailed in the same prison on 21 April 1794 but was freed three months later, thanks to the fall of Maximilien Robespierre. Beauharnais was guillotined, together with his cousin Augustin, on the &quot;Place de la Révolution&quot; (today&#x27;s &quot;Place de la Concorde&quot;) in Paris on 23 July 1794, five days before the end of the Reign of Terror.

==Ancestry==
His paternal grandparents Claude de Beauharnais (1680–1738) and Renée Hardouineau (1696–1744) were married in La Rochelle during 1713. His father François de Beauharnais, Marquess de la La Ferté-Beauharnais (1714–1800) served as Governor of Martinique. Alexandre was the third of three sons born to him by his first wife Marie Henriette Pyvart de Chastullé (1722–1767) - the first died in infancy, and the second was Francis VI of Beauharnais. His father was remarried in 1796 to Eugenie de Tascher de la Pagerie (1739–1803).

<doc id="1029554" wikidata="Q1784364" url="?curid=1029554" title="Hu (mythology)">
<text>Hu (&quot;&quot;), in ancient Egypt, was &quot;the personification of a religious term, the &#x27;creative utterance&#x27;&quot; and closely connected to Sia. Hu was deification of the first word, the word of creation, that Atum was said to have exclaimed upon ejaculating in his masturbatory act of creating the Ennead.

Hu is mentioned already in the Old Kingdom Pyramid texts (PT 251, PT 697) as companion of the deceased pharaoh. Together with Sia, he was depicted in the retinue of Thoth.

In the Middle Kingdom, all gods participated in Hu and Sia, and were associated with Ptah who created the universe by uttering the word of creation. Hu was rarely depicted visually, when Hu was depicted it would be as an anthropomorphic deity.

In the New Kingdom, both Hu and Sia together with Heka, Irer and Sedjem were members of the creative powers of Amun-Ra. By the time of Ptolemaic Egypt, Hu had merged with Shu (air).

<text>Hu () is a Chinese surname. In 2006, it was the 15th most common surname in China. In 2013, it was the 13th most common in China, with 13.7 million Chinese sharing this surname. In 2019, Hu dropped to 15th most common surname in Mainland China.

Some other, less common surnames pronounced Hu include , , , , , , , and . In Cantonese, “胡” is also pronounced as &quot;Wu&quot; or &quot;Woo&quot;.

==Meaning==
In Classical Chinese, &quot;hú&quot; 胡 meant: &quot;dewlap; wattle&quot; and was a variant Chinese character for &quot;how; why; what&quot; (&quot;he&quot; ), &quot;long-lasting; far-reaching&quot; (&quot;xia&quot; ), &quot;part of a dagger-axe&quot;, &quot;hu-&quot; in &quot;butterfly&quot; (&quot;hudie&quot; ), or possibly &quot;Northern Barbarians&quot;.

== History ==
According to tradition, the Hu (胡) surname has several historical origins. First, Hu could derive from the family of Duke Hu of Chen. King Wu of Zhou (r. 1046-043 BCE) enfeoffed his son-in-law Gui Man 媯滿 (supposedly a descendant of the legendary sage king Emperor Shun) with the state of Chen (in modern Henan Province). His posthumous name was Duke Hu, and his descendants adopted Hu as their surname. Second, Hu could derive from two Zhou vassal states named Hu 胡, one located near Luohe (Henan Province) or another near Fuyang (Anhui Province). Third, Hu could derive from non-Chinese people adopting it as their surname. For example, in the 496 Change of Xianbei names to Han names, Hegu/Gegu 紇骨 was changed to Hu 胡. Fourth, Hu could derive from the clan name of the ancient Tiele people within the Xiongnu confederation.

Non-Chinese peoples and ethnic minorities in China sometimes took the Chinese exonym for their ethnic group as their surname. The best example is Hu 胡, which was anciently used to refer to &quot;barbarian&quot; groups on the northern and western frontiers of China.

&quot;Hu&quot; (胡) was used for various northern and western peoples of non-Han Chinese stock. It has been used for people of Persian, Sogdian, Turkic, Xianbi, Indian and Kushan origin and occasionally for the Xiongnu (probably because of their connections with the Tonghu or Eastern Hu – a separate tribe conquered by the Xiongnu).

Two historically significant Hu names are &quot;Donghu&quot; 東胡 (literally &quot;Eastern Barbarians&quot;) &quot;ancient Mongolian nomadic group&quot; and the &quot;Wu Hu&quot; 五胡 (&quot;Five Barbarians&quot;) &quot;five nomadic tribes involved in the Wu Hu uprising&quot; (304-316 CE) against the Jin dynasty. Hu (Foochow Romanized: Hù; POJ: Hô or Ô) was also one of the eight surnames of the first Han Chinese clans who first moved out the Central Plains into Fujian province (八姓入閩; Foochow Romanized: Báik Sáng Ĭk Mìng) during this conflict.

The Hồ 胡 clan which founded the Hồ dynasty in Vietnam originated in Zhejiang province of China.

The Hu family of Xidi are descended from Hu Shiliang, from Wuyuan, who was a descendant of Hu Changyi, a son of Emperor Zhaozong of Tang who was adopted by the Wuyuan Hu family.

Based on a study in 2020, Hu is a common surname in Italy due to significant amount of immigration population from Zhejiang.

The surname 虎 (Hǔ), which means &quot;Tiger&quot;, is rare in China to the point where many people are not aware that it is used as a surname. Some believe it comes from the name of a 4,300-year-old chancellor, while others believe it originates among the Hui Muslim minority.

<text>Walter Ernest Butler (23 August 1898 – 1 August 1978) was a working occultist, author and the founder and first director of Servants of the Light in Britain.

==Early life==
His first training in the mysteries was with Robert King, a bishop in the Liberal Catholic Church, who trained him as a medium. Butler later became a priest in the Liberal Catholic Church.

While in India, he studied with Indian mystics and also came into contact with Theosophist mystic Annie Besant, who politely rejected his requests to study with her. He returned to England and joined Dion Fortune&#x27;s Society of the Inner Light in 1925, where he continued to train and participate until sometime toward the end of World War II.

==Career==
In 1962 he met Gareth Knight and, with Knight, began to develop a correspondence course in Qabalah for Helios Books. During this time he also rejoined the Society of the Inner Light, where he met Michael Nowicki and Dolores Ashcroft-Nowicki. By 1973, the Helios Course in the Practical Qabalah had gained popularity and was spun off to form the Servants of the Light, for which Ernest was the first Director of Studies. He remained director of studies until shortly before his death, when he passed that responsibility to Dolores Ashcroft-Nowicki.

==Personality and personal life==

W. E. Butler worked many years as an engineer. Later on he was a member of the technical staff at University of Southampton, England.
By the 1970s, Butler was living in a Tudor cottage with limestone walls and a thatched roof, Little Thatches, which was located in Hillstreet, Calmore, Southampton .
Janine Chapman met Butler in the 1970s, noting that he had a Yorkshire accent, and commenting on a &quot;paternal sort of goodness about him&quot;. She moreover highlighted that he had &quot;the very pale white skin of a Celt, a round face, thin lips, and a kindly smile.&quot;

I first met Mr Butler at a meeting of the Society of the inner Light at Steeles Road in the mid 60&#x27;s. We were taking tea when I noticed this odd looking character over in the corner and I went over and introduced myself. He was wearing a trilby hat (indoors) and a dog collar so that, at first, I thought he was a vicar. He was quite hard of hearing at this time and had an analogue hearing aid consisting of a long wire and a box that clipped on to his lapel. Later, when he pulled out his wallet to give me a card with his address, some bits fell to the floor and when I picked them up for him I spotted a red card and he said &quot;Ah yes, the old complaint.&quot; He was a card carrying diabetic. He had a good sense of humour and told me that he liked to take the mickey out of people - particularly the Irish. I intimated that I didn&#x27;t think that this was the greatest idea at the time.

Its current home field is Nordre Åsen, after the club stopped playing at Bislett after the 2012 season. In past decades it has gained a reputation as a talent factory for the larger clubs in Norwegian football, and it has produced several players for the national team such as Daniel Braaten, Daniel Fredheim Holm, Omar Elabdellaoui and Mohammed Abdellaoue. Other notable players include Paul Miller. Skeid played in 1. divisjon in 2009 after a short stint in the 2. divisjon. They finished champions of the Second Group of 2. divisjon in 2008.

In the media, there was speculation in values in the order of NOK 30 million (NOK).

Skeid decided that the money from Hagen will not be used short term, but function as a long-term fund and that only the return of the money will be used to further develop the club and its facilities.

They played in the Norwegian top flight between 1938–1970 (Norwegian League did not play between 1940–1947 due to World War II), 1972–1975 (4 seasons), 1978–1980 (3 seasons), 1996–1997 (2 seasons). Their recent season in the top division was in the 1999 Tippeligaen.

== 2020 - ==
Skeid startet the year 2020 with a new head coach, when Gard Holme signed on to lead the squad on January 6. He took over a team that lost 8 players from the most used starting lineup in 2019, and due to a strict economy Skeid only signed new players from 2. and 3. Division.

The season was put on a hold at the start of the year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and did not start until July, when it started with a reduced schedule. During the season, Skeid played homegames at 3 different venues due to problematic circumstances regarding the artificial turf at Nordre Åsen.

Nonetheless, Holme led Skeid to a promotion playoff in his first season, which they lost against Asker on penalties after both games ended 1-1.

Skeid lost a couple of key players before the 2021 season when Idar Nordby Lysgård (Mjøndalen), Henning Tønsberg Andresen (Ull/Kisa), Taofeek Ismaheel (Fredrikstad) and Hassan Yusuf (Grorud) all left the team, while legendary player Daniel Braathen hang up his boots after a great career.

The ”new” team started the season strong, and it looked like Skeid would challenge for promotion with Arendal and Egersund as their greatest rivals. Head coach Gard Holme also changed the formation from the previous year and played more of a 3-4-3 / 3-5-2-formation this season.

Top scorer Johnny Buduson got injured midway through the season, and Holme chose to play youngster Abel Stensrud at his spot for the rest of the season. That turned out to be a great choice, as Stensrud scoret 19 goals on the last 12 games and ended up top scorer in the division.

In the end of October Skeid clinched promotion back to the OBOS-ligaen (Division 1) after a 12-0-win over Rosenborg 2 in front of over 800 people in the crowd at Nordre Åsen. It had been a tough season with both Egersund and Arendal fighting for promotion, but in the end Skeid ended up on top.

Skeid started the year of 2022 rough as top scorer Abel Stensrud and Simen Hestnes both left the team when their contracts expired, and they signed for Odd and KFUM Oslo shortly after. Head Coach Holme brought in Bendik Rise (Hødd), Morten Renå Olsen (Strømmen) and Sulayman Bojang (FK Haugesund) to the during the winter.

Skeid started the season badly, and halfway through the season Skeid was in 15th place in the table with only Stjørdals-Blink behind them and Grorud a couple of points in front of them. During the summer break Skeid brought in a couple of players on loan: Kristoffer Hoven (Sogndal) and Simen Kvia-Egeskog (Viking) where both loaned in, while Maxwell Effiom (Sandnes Ulf) and Per-Magnus Steiring (Kongsvinger) signed on, Effiom for two years while Steiring signed on for the remainder of the season.

After the summer break, things turned for Skeid, and they got 22 points from the remaining games, and ended the season in 14th place, which meant relegation playoff against Arendal from division 2. Skeid went on to beat Arendal 6-0 at home and 2-1 away to remain in OBOS-ligaen another year.

During the winter break before the 2023 season Skeid again lost a couple of key players when captain Fredrik Berglie departed for Sandefjord while young talent Jakob Napoleon Romsaas departed for Tromsø up north. Skeid brought in Fredrik Flo (Sandefjord) and Torje Naustdal (FK Haugesund) to bolster the squad, while Kristoffer Hoven and Per Magnus Steiring both signed two year deals the 2022 season concluded. Skeid also brought in goalkeeper Simen Vidtun Nilsen on loan from Sarpsborg 08 as the new first choice in goal.

Midway through the season Skeid where at relegation point in the table after 11 points on the first 15 games, and with team still on relegation in August, head coach Gard Holme resigned. His replacement for the remaining of the season was experienced head coach Arne Erlandsen, but he couldn&#x27;t save the team from relegation. After only a single win and eleven losses on his twelve games in charge, Skeid ended the season rock bottom with only 14 points on 30 games.

In December 2023 Skeid made history when 31 year old Vilde Mollestad Rislaa was announced as new head coach, the first female head coach for the men&#x27;s first team in the club&#x27;s 107 year old history.

Rislaa took over a team with several key members of the team departing, but a couple of the players that supporters thought would leave decided to stay after Rislaa talked with the players and told them about her plans for the team and the upcoming season. Throughout pre-season Rislaa focused hard on the defensive culture in the team, and took that focus with here into the season.

Skeid had a strong season and were in the fight for promotion throughout 2024. When autumn came it became clear that the fight would stand between Skeid and Tromsdalen, but Skeid prevailed with three straight wins at the end of the season to secure promotion. Skeid ended with 58 points on 26 games and 53-20 in goal difference, with only 7 goals conceded on away soil.

<text>Vernon Phillips Watkins (27 June 1906 – 8 October 1967) was a Welsh poet and translator. He was a close friend of fellow poet Dylan Thomas, who described him as &quot;the most profound and greatly accomplished Welshman writing poems in English&quot;.

==Early life and studies==
Vernon Watkins was born in Maesteg in Glamorgan, and brought up mainly in Swansea. His birth coincided with slight earth tremors; another baby born that night was christened John Earthquake Jones. His parents were William Watkins, a manager for Lloyds Bank in Wind Street, Swansea, and Sarah (&quot;Sally&quot;), daughter of James Phillips and Esther Thomas of Sarnau, Meidrim. James Phillips was a Congregationalist, reputed to know most of the Welsh Bible by heart. Sarah had a love of poetry and literature; her headmistress arranged for her to spend two years as a pupil-teacher in Germany. William Watkins and Sarah Phillips married in 1902, and had three children, Vernon, Marjorie, and Dorothy. The family lived at &quot;Redclliffe&quot;, a large Victorian house about from Swansea, at Caswell Bay.

Watkins read fluently by the age of four, and at five announced that he would be a poet, although he did not wish to be published until after his death. He wrote poetry and read widely from eight or nine years of age and was especially fond of the works of John Keats and Shelley. He received his later education at a preparatory school in Sussex, Repton School in Derbyshire, and Magdalene College, Cambridge.

In his early years at Repton, Watkins&#x27; quiet, gentle character provoked regular bullying from older boys, though in his last years he attained more popularity as he was able to show capacity in tennis and cricket. After he died, in 1968, the school wrote that he was &quot;perhaps the best poet Repton has had&quot;.[7] His headmaster at Repton was Geoffrey Fisher, who became Archbishop of Canterbury. Despite his parents being Nonconformists, Watkins&#x27; school experiences influenced him to join the Church of England. He read modern languages at Cambridge, but left before completing his degree.

==Career==

===Dylan Thomas and the Swansea Group===
He met Dylan Thomas, who was to be a close friend, in 1935 when Watkins had returned to a job in a bank in Swansea. About once a week Thomas would come to Watkins&#x27; parents&#x27; house, situated on the very top of the cliffs of the Gower peninsula. Watkins was the only person from whom Thomas took advice when writing poetry and he was invariably the first to read his finished work. They remained lifelong friends, despite Thomas&#x27;s failure, in the capacity of best man, to turn up to the wedding of Vernon and Gwen in 1944. Watkins was godfather to Thomas&#x27;s son Llewelyn, the others being Richard Hughes and Augustus John.

Thomas used to laugh affectionately at his friend&#x27;s gossamer-like personality and extreme sensibility. A story is told that one evening in Chelsea, during the war time blackout, they were walking along and Vernon tripped over something and fell to the ground. Thomas looked with a torch to see what the offending object was and to his delight all that they could find was a small, black feather (FitzGibbon 1966). 

With Thomas, Watkins was one of a group of Swansea artists known as the &quot;Kardomah boys&quot; (because they frequented the Kardomah Café in Castle Street). Others among this Swansea Group were the composer Daniel Jenkyn Jones, writer Charles Fisher and the artists Alfred Janes and Mervyn Levy. 

&quot;Letters to Vernon Watkins&quot; by Dylan Thomas was published in 1957, four years after his death in New York. It proved to be the first in a number of books that linked Watkins and Thomas. The 1983 book &quot;Portrait of a Friend&quot; by Watkins&#x27; wife Gwen (&quot;née&quot; Davies) deals with the relationship between the two poets, and in 2013 Parthian Books published &quot;Vernon Watkins on Dylan Thomas and Other Poets &amp; Poetry&quot;, a collection of previously-unpublished critical work with a foreword by Rowan Williams. &quot;Poems for Dylan,&quot; a collection of poems written by Watkins to Thomas, appeared from Gomer Press in 2003. It opens with the obituary Watkins wrote for his friend, which was originally published in &quot;The Times&quot; on 10 November 1953. &quot;Poems for Dylan&quot; also contains two poems (&#x27;At Cwmrhydyceirw Quarry&#x27; and &#x27;Cwmrhydyceirw Elegaics&#x27;) centred upon the quarry in Cwmrhydyceirw where, in August 1963, Watkins and the sculptor Ron Cour picked out the stone that would be inscribed with lines from &#x27;Fern Hill&#x27; and placed in Cwmdonkin Park as a permanent memorial to Thomas. &#x27;Cwmrhydyceirw Elegaics&#x27; had first seen publication in the January 1968 issue of Poetry magazine.

===Bletchley Park and marriage===
Watkins met Gwen, who came from Harborne, Birmingham, at Bletchley Park, where he worked during the Second World War as a cryptographer, and she, as a member of the WAAF. They were both engaged in breaking the Luftwaffe AuKa tactical codes in Block F (A). Gwen was at first billeted at Stony Stratford but later moved to RAF Church Green at Bletchley. They were both Flight Sergeants and were stationed at Bletchley from June 1942 until May 1945.

They were married at the church of St Bartholomew-the-Great, in London on 2 October 1944. The couple had five children. One of their grandchildren, Marley Watkins, is a professional footballer who has represented the Welsh national team.

==Poetry==
Watkins&#x27; ambitions were for his poetry; in critical terms they were not to be fulfilled. On the other hand, he became a major figure for the Anglo-Welsh poetry tradition, and his poems were included in major anthologies. During the war he was for a time associated with the New Apocalyptics group. With his first book &quot;Ballad of the Mari Llwyd&quot; (1941) accepted by Faber &amp; Faber, he had a publisher with a policy of sticking by their authors. In his case this may be considered to have had an adverse long-term effect on his reputation, in that it is sometimes thought that he over-published. Of the book, the publisher said:

&quot;Mr Vernon Watkins is a Welsh poet whose work hitherto has appeared only in periodicals and in recent anthologies. The only influence apparent upon his poetry is one he has thoroughly assimilated - that of W. B. Yeats. Otherwise his style differs radically from that of any of his older contemporaries, except for a racial quality which gives it something in common with that of Dylan Thomas. Mr Watkins is undoubtedly a poet with an uncommon sense of rhythm as well as of imagery.&quot;
The British Library holds a manuscript draft of the poem with annotations by T. S. Eliot, showing Eliot at work as editor and board member at the publishing house Faber - his &quot;day job&quot; since 1925. The Library also holds the Watkins Papers which include autograph and typewritten poems chiefly from his seven published volumes, but also some unpublished poems. In 2016, another collection of Watkins&#x27;s draft poems was acquired from the widow of Watkins.

Watkins wrote poetry for several hours every night and by way of contrast, Caitlin, Dylan Thomas&#x27;s wife, could not recall her husband staying in even for one night during their whole married life. As well as Yeats Vernon was familiar with T. S. Eliot and Philip Larkin whose affectionate recollection of him can be found in his &quot;Required Writing: Miscellaneous Pieces 1955-1982&quot; (2012). He was awarded a University of Wales honorary Doctorate of Literature in 1966 after retiring from his job at the bank. He was being considered for Poet Laureate at the time of his death.


A poem by Watkins from &quot;The Anglo-Welsh Review&quot;; the widow mentioned may be Caitlin Thomas.

==Death and memorial==

Watkins had developed a serious heart condition, which he made light of, insisting on playing his beloved tennis and squash with his usual vigour. He died on 8 October 1967, aged 61, playing tennis in Seattle, where he had gone to teach a course on modern poetry at the University of Washington. Philip Larkin wrote his obituary.

His body was returned to Britain, and was buried in Gower, at St Mary&#x27;s Church, Pennard. A small granite memorial to him stands at Hunt&#x27;s Bay, Gower, on which are inscribed two lines from his poem &quot;Taliesin in Gower&quot;: &quot;I have been taught the script of stones, and I know the tongue of the wave.&quot;

A portrait of Watkins by his friend Alfred Janes may be seen in the Glynn Vivian Art Gallery, Swansea. A group portrait of the Kardomah Boys by Jeff Phillips was unveiled at Tapestri Arts Centre in Swansea in June 2011. Featured in the painting are Vernon Watkins, John Pritchard, Dylan Thomas, Daniel Jones and Alfred Janes. The picture is based on a BBC &quot;Radio Times&quot; front cover from October 1949.

In March 2012, Rowan Williams, Archbishop of Canterbury, presented a portrait of Watkins in the BBC Radio 3 programme &quot;Swansea&#x27;s Other Poet&quot;. Williams regards Watkins as &quot;one of the 20th century&#x27;s most brilliant and distinctive yet unjustly neglected voices&quot;.

In October 2014 Swansea Council unveiled a blue plaque for Watkins outside the building on the corner of St Helen&#x27;s Road and Beach Street in the city, where he spent 38 years working for Lloyds Bank. On 3 November 2014 the &quot;Poem of the Week&quot; in &quot;The Guardian&quot; was Watkins&#x27; &quot;Three Harps&quot;.

Most of Watkins&#x27;s manuscripts are held by the National Library of Wales, Aberystwyth.

<text>Alissos () is a village and a community in the municipal unit of Dymi, Achaea, Greece. It is located near the Gulf of Patras, 3 km east of Kato Achaia, 3 km southwest of Kaminia and 17 km southwest of Patras. The community consists of the villages Alissos, Kamenitsa, Paralia Alissou and Profitis Elissaios. The Greek National Road 9 (Patras - Pyrgos) and the railway from Patras to Pyrgos run between Alissos and Paralia Alissou.

==History==
Alissos was known as Lisarea or Lysaria (; ) during the period of Frankish rule in the late Middle Ages. According to the &quot;Chronicle of the Morea&quot;, it was a fief of the Barony of Akova, held in the late 1270s by Margaret of Lisarea (or Jeanne), a cousin of Walter of Rosières, baron of Akova. She married Geoffrey II of Briel. The fief was then inherited by their daughter, Helen, and her husband, Vilain II of Aulnay, Baron of Arcadia. Lisarea disappears thereafter, until ca. 1377, when it was held by Centurione I Zaccaria.

<text>Jamal Ahmad Mohammad Ali Al Badawi aka Jamal Abu Abed Al Rahman Al Badawi () (1960 or 1963 – 1 January 2019) was a Yemeni who was indicted as an accomplice for his role in the 2000 USS &quot;Cole&quot; bombing off the coast of Aden, Yemen, which killed 17 American sailors on 12 October 2000.
He was captured in Yemen and sentenced to death on 29 September 2004. Al-Badawi was also indicted on 15 May 2003, by the United States for the USS &quot;Cole&quot; bombing and the attempted attack on . He is thought to have travelled to Saudi Arabia and purchased a small boat and then a truck and trailer to transport it. This boat sank from the weight of the explosives while preparing the USS &quot;The Sullivans&quot; plot. Al-Badawi is also thought to have leased the safehouses used in these endeavors. &quot;Fox News&quot; called Al-Badawi a &quot;mastermind&quot; of the Cole bombing.

Only two of the six charged by Yemen in the attack were sentenced to death; the other four were sentenced to 5–10 years imprisonment. After hearing his sentence, Al-Badawi declared &quot;This is an unjust verdict, this is an American verdict. There are no human rights in the world, except for the Americans. All the Muslims in the world are being used to serve American interests.&quot; His family announced they would appeal. Because he was being held by U.S. forces, the other defendant sentenced to death, Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, was tried and sentenced &quot;in absentia&quot;.

Al-Badawi twice escaped from Yemeni prison, once after his death sentence was issued, and was being sought as an FBI Most Wanted Terrorist fugitive. He was killed by an American drone strike by a kinetic Hellfire variant with pop-up blades on 1 January 2019, that was conducted in Ma&#x27;rib Governorate, Yemen.

==Escape from Yemeni prison==
Al-Badawi was one of the &quot;Cole&quot; defendants who had previously escaped from Yemeni custody during a prisoner transfer in April 2003, but he was later recaptured in March 2004.

By June 2003, al-Badawi had been added to the FBI Seeking Information - War on Terrorism list.

Once again in custody, al-Badawi was removed from FBI Seeking Information wanted list on 10 October 2004.

According to a BBC report, al-Badawi was one of 23 people who escaped from a Yemeni jail on 3 February 2006, 12 of them Al-Qaeda members.

On 23 February 2006, the U.S. FBI confirmed the latest escape, as they issued a national Press Release naming al-Badawi as one of the first new additions, since inception in 2001, to the FBI Most Wanted Terrorists list.
He appeared on the FBI list with three new photos, including an enhanced black and white of the original grainy color photo. He was listed by the FBI on his new wanted poster under the name Jamel Ahmed Mohammed Ali Al-Badawi.

On 17 October 2007, al-Badawi surrendered to Yemeni authorities as part of an agreement with al-Qaeda militants. Following his surrender, Yemeni authorities released him in return for a pledge not to engage in any violent or al-Qaeda-related activity, despite a $5 million reward for his capture.

Al-Badawi was mentioned frequently during Guantanamo captive Abd Al Rahim Hussein Mohammed Al Nashiri&#x27;s Combatant Status Review Tribunal.

<text>Liang Qichao (Chinese: 梁啓超 ; Wade–Giles: &quot;Liang2 Chʻi3-chʻao1&quot;; Yale: &quot;Lèuhng Kái-chīu&quot;; ) (February 23, 1873 – January 19, 1929) was a Chinese politician, social and political activist, journalist, and intellectual. His thought had a significant influence on the political reformation of modern China. He inspired Chinese scholars and activists with his writings and reform movements. His translations of Western and Japanese books into Chinese further introduced new theories and ideas and inspired young activists.

In his youth, Liang joined his teacher Kang Youwei in the Hundred Days&#x27; Reform of 1898. When the movement was defeated, he fled to Japan and promoted a constitutional monarchy and organized political opposition to the dynasty. After the revolution of 1911, he joined the Beiyang government, serving as the chief justice and the first president of the currency system bureau. He became dissatisfied with Yuan Shikai and launched a movement to oppose his ambition to be emperor. After Yuan&#x27;s death, he served as the finance chief of the Duan Qirui cabinet and as supervisor of the Salt Administration. He advocated the New Culture Movement and supported cultural change but not political revolution.

==Biography==
===Family===
Liang Qichao was born in a small village in Xinhui, Guangdong Province on February 23, 1873. Liang&#x27;s father, Liang Baoying (, Cantonese: &quot;Lèuhng Bóu-yīng&quot;; courtesy name Lianjian ; Cantonese: &quot;Lìhn-gaan&quot;), was a farmer and local scholar, but had a classical background that emphasized on tradition and education for ethnic rejuvenescence allowed him to be introduced to various literary works at six years old. By the age of nine, Liang started writing thousand-word essays and became a district-school student soon after. Liang had two wives: Li Huixian (; Cantonese: &quot;Léih Waih-sīn&quot;) and Wang Guiquan (; Cantonese: &quot;Wòhng Gwai-chyùhn&quot;). They gave birth to nine children, all of whom became successful individuals through Liang&#x27;s strict and effective education. Three of them were scientific personnel at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, including Liang Sicheng, the prominent historian of Chinese architecture.

===Early life===
Liang passed the &quot;Xiucai&quot; degree provincial examination at the age of 11. In 1884, he undertook the arduous task of studying for the traditional governmental exams. At the age of 16, he passed the &quot;Juren&quot; second level provincial exams and was the youngest successful candidate at that time.

In 1890, Liang failed in his &quot;Jinshi&quot; degree national examinations in Beijing and never earned a higher degree. He took the exams along with Kang Youwei, a famous Chinese scholar and reformist. According to one popular narrative of Liang&#x27;s failure to pass the Jinshi, the examiner was determined to flunk Kang for his heterodox challenge to existing institutions, but since the exams were all anonymous, he could only presume that the exam with the most unorthodox views was Kang&#x27;s. Instead, Kang disguised himself by writing an examination eight-legged essay espousing traditionalist ideas and passed the exam while Liang&#x27;s paper was assumed to be Kang&#x27;s and picked out to be failed.

Inspired by the book &quot;Illustrated Treatise on the Maritime Kingdoms&quot; by the reform Confucian scholar Wei Yuan, Liang became extremely interested in western political thought. After returning home, Liang went on to study with Kang Youwei, who was teaching at &quot;&quot; in Guangzhou. Kang&#x27;s teachings about foreign affairs fueled Liang&#x27;s interest in reforming China.

In 1895, Liang went to the capital Beijing again with Kang for the national examination. During the examination, he was active in the Gongche Shangshu movement. After failing to pass the examination for a second time, he stayed in Beijing to help Kang publish &quot;Domestic and Foreign Information&quot;. He also helped to organize the , where Liang served as secretary. For time, he was also enlisted by the governor of Hunan, Chen Baozhen to edit reform-friendly publications, such as the Hunan Daily (&quot;Xiangbao&quot; ) and the Hunan Journal (&quot;Xiang xuebao&quot; ).

=== Reform movements ===
As an advocate of constitutional monarchy, Liang was unhappy with the governance of the Qing Government and wanted to change the status quo in China. He organized reforms with Kang Youwei by putting their ideas on paper and sending them to the Guangxu Emperor (reigned 1875–1908) of the Qing dynasty. This movement is known as the &quot;Wuxu Reform&quot; or the Hundred Days&#x27; Reform. Their proposal asserted that China was in need of more than self-strengthening, and called for many institutional and ideological changes such as getting rid of corruption and remodeling the state examination system. Liang thus was a major influence in the debates on democracy in China.

This proposal soon ignited a frenzy of disagreement, and Liang became a wanted man by order of Empress Dowager Cixi, the leader of the political conservative faction who later took over the government as regent. Cixi strongly opposed reforms at that time and along with her supporters, condemned the &quot;Hundred Days&#x27; Reform&quot; as being too radical.

In 1898, the Conservative Coup ended all reforms, and Liang fled to Japan, where he stayed for the next 14 years. While in Tokyo he befriended the influential politician and future Japanese Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi. In Japan, he continued to actively advocate the democratic cause by using his writings to raise support for the reformers’ cause among overseas Chinese and foreign governments. He continued to emphasize the importance of individualism, and to support the concept of a constitutional monarchy as opposed to the radical republicanism supported by the Tokyo-based &quot;Tongmenghui&quot; (the forerunner of the Kuomintang). During his time in Japan, Liang also served as a benefactor and colleague to Phan Boi Chau, one of Vietnam&#x27;s most important anticolonial revolutionaries.

In 1899, Liang went to Canada, where he met Dr. Sun Yat-Sen among others, then to Honolulu in Hawaii. During the Boxer Rebellion, Liang was back in Canada, where he formed the &quot;Chinese Empire Reform Association&quot;. This organization later became the Constitutionalist Party which advocated constitutional monarchy. While Sun promoted revolution, Liang preached incremental reform.

In 1900–1901, Liang visited Australia on a six-month tour that aimed at raising support for a campaign to reform the Chinese empire and thus modernize China through adopting the best of Western technology, industry and government systems. He also gave public lectures to both Chinese and Western audiences around the country. This visit coincided with the Federation of the six British colonies into the new nation of Australia in 1901. He felt this model of integration might be an excellent model for the diverse regions of China. He was feted by politicians, and met the first Prime Minister of Australia, Edmund Barton. He returned to Japan later that year.

In 1903, Liang embarked on an eight-month lecture tour throughout the United States, which included a meeting with President Theodore Roosevelt in Washington, DC, before returning to Japan via Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

While living in Japan in 1905, Liang supported the Constitutionalist movement within the Qing administration.

The descendant of Confucius Duke Yansheng was proposed as a replacement for the Qing dynasty as Emperor by Liang Qichao.

===Politician===
For the construction of the modernization, Liang focused on two relative questions in politics. The first one was the ways that transformed people became citizen for modernization, and Liang thought Chinese needed to improve civic ethos to build the nation-state in the Qing dynasty, and the second one was the question of the citizenship, and Liang thought both of them were important to support the reformation in the Qing dynasty. In Liang&#x27;s view, Chineseness was a cultural concept rather than an ethnic concept. Liang viewed China as weak not because of ethnic Manchu rule, but because of its cultural customs formed over millennia. From his perspective, an &quot;imperial strategy&quot; to combine all Chinese ethnicities into one nation was the best path to a strong China.

With the overthrow of the Qing dynasty, constitutional monarchy became an increasingly irrelevant topic. Liang merged his renamed Democratic Party with the Republicans to form the new Progressive Party. He was very critical of Sun Yatsen&#x27;s attempts to undermine President Yuan Shikai. Though usually supportive of the government, he opposed the expulsion of the Nationalists from parliament.

Liang&#x27;s thought was influenced by the West, and he learned about the new political thought and regimes of the Western countries, and he learned these from the Japanese translation books, and he learned the Western thought through Meiji Japan to analyze the knowledge of the West.

In 1915, he opposed Yuan&#x27;s attempt to make himself emperor. He convinced his disciple Cai E, the military governor of Yunnan, to rebel. Progressive party branches agitated for the overthrow of Yuan and more provinces declared their independence. The revolutionary activity that he had frowned upon was utilized successfully. Besides Duan Qirui, Liang was the biggest advocate of entering World War I on the Allied side. He felt it would boost China&#x27;s status and also ameliorate foreign debts. He condemned his mentor, Kang Youwei, for assisting in the failed attempt to restore the Qing in July 1917. After failing to turn Duan Qirui and Feng Guozhang into responsible statesmen, he gave up and left politics.

Liang favored nationalism that incorporated different ethnic groups of the Qing empire to oppose Western imperialists. Despite the failures of his reforms, Liang&#x27;s idea of Chinese nationalism based on the civic idea of Five Races Under One Union inspired Sun Yat-sen and the Kuomintang&#x27;s nationalism, as well as the nationalist rhetoric of the CCP.

== Contributions to journalism ==
===As a journalist===
Lin Yutang once called Liang &quot;the greatest personality in the history of Chinese journalism,&quot; while Joseph Levenson, author of &quot;Liang Ch&#x27;i-ch&#x27;ao and the Mind of Modern China&quot;, described Liang as &quot;a brilliant scholar, journalist, and political figure.&quot;

Liang Qichao was the &quot;most influential turn-of-the-century scholar-journalist,&quot; according to Levenson. Liang showed that newspapers and magazines could serve as an effective medium for communicating political ideas.

Liang, as a historian and a journalist, believed that both careers must have the same purpose and &quot;moral commitment,&quot; as he proclaimed, &quot;by examining the past and revealing the future, I will show the path of progress to the people of the nation.&quot; Thus, he founded his first newspaper, called the &quot;Qing Yi Bao&quot; (), named after a student movement of the Han dynasty.

Liang&#x27;s exile to Japan allowed him to speak freely and exercise his intellectual autonomy. During his career in journalism, he edited two premier newspapers, &quot;Zhongwai Gongbao&quot; () and &quot;Shiwu Bao&quot; (). He also published his moral and political ideals in &quot;Qing Yi Bao&quot; () and &quot;New Citizen&quot; ().

In addition, he used his literary works to further spread his views on republicanism both in China and across the world. Accordingly, he had become an influential journalist in terms of political and cultural aspects by writing new forms of periodical journals. He published his articles in the magazine New Youth to expand the thought of science and democracy in the 1910s. Furthermore, journalism paved the way for him to express his patriotism.

===&quot;New Citizen Journal&quot;===
Liang produced a widely read biweekly journal called &quot;New Citizen&quot; (&quot;Xinmin Congbao&quot; ), first published in Yokohama, Japan on February 8, 1902.
The journal covered many different topics, including politics, religion, law, economics, business, geography and current and international affairs. In the journal, Liang coined many Chinese equivalents for never-before-heard theories or expressions and used the journal to help communicate public opinion in China to faraway readers. Through news analyses and essays, Liang hoped that the &quot;New Citizen&quot; would be able to start a &quot;new stage in Chinese newspaper history.&quot;

A year later, Liang and his co-workers saw a change in the newspaper industry and remarked, &quot;Since the inauguration of our journal last year, there have come into being almost ten separate journals with the same style and design.&quot;

Liang spread his notions about democracy as chief editor of the &quot;New Citizen Journal&quot;. The journal was published without hindrance for five years but eventually ceased in 1907 after 96 issues. Its readership was estimated to be 200,000.

===Role of the newspaper===

As one of the pioneers of Chinese journalism of his time, Liang believed in the &quot;power&quot; of newspaper, especially its influence over government policies. In 1896, he wrote an editorial for the first issue of &quot;Shiwu bao&quot; (Contemporary affairs) titled, &quot;On the Benefits of the Press to State Affairs.&quot; In the editorial, Liang compared the circulation of information in a country to the blood and pulse of a body. Liang wrote that China was weak due to blockages of communication between the rulers, ministers, the people, and between China and the outside world. He criticized the Qing dynasty for its control on information, which to Liang implied a failure of political rationality.

Liang both praised Western freedom of the press and criticized Western media narratives of China for legitimizing colonization and conquest.

Using newspapers and magazines to communicate political ideas: Liang realised the importance of journalism&#x27;s social role and supported the idea of a strong relationship between politics and journalism before the May Fourth Movement, (also known as the New Culture Movement). He believed that newspapers and magazines should serve as an essential and effective tool in communicating political ideas. The magazine New Youth became an important way to show his thought in the New Culture Movement, and his articles spread the ideas to the youth in that period. He believed that newspapers did not only act as a historical record, but was also a means to &quot;shape the course of history.&quot;

Press as a weapon in revolution: Liang also thought that the press was an &quot;effective weapon in the service of a nationalist uprising&quot;. In Liang&#x27;s words, the newspaper is a “revolution of ink, not a revolution of blood.” He wrote, &quot;so a newspaper regards the government the way a father or elder brother regards a son or younger brother — teaching him when he does not understand, and reprimanding him when he gets something wrong.&quot; Undoubtedly, his attempt to unify and dominate a fast-growing and highly competitive press market has set the tone for the first generation of newspaper historians of the May Fourth Movement.

Newspaper as an educational program: Liang was well aware that the newspaper could serve as an &quot;educational program&quot;, and said, &quot;the newspaper gathers virtually all the thoughts and expressions of the nation and systematically introduces them to the citizenry, it being irrelevant whether they are important or not, concise or not, radical or not. The press, therefore, can contain, reject, produce, as well as destroy, everything.&quot;

For example, Liang wrote a well known essay during his most radical period titled &quot;The Young China&quot; and published it in his newspaper &quot;Qing Yi Bao&quot; () on February 2, 1900. The essay established the concept of the nation-state and argued that the young revolutionaries were the holders of the future of China. This essay was influential on the Chinese political culture during the May Fourth Movement in the 1920s.

Weak press: However, Liang thought that the press in China at that time was quite weak, not only due to lack of financial resources and to conventional social prejudices, but also because &quot;the social atmosphere was not free enough to encourage more readers and there was a lack of roads and highways that made it hard to distribute newspapers&quot;. Liang felt that the prevalent newspapers of the time were &quot;no more than a mass commodity&quot;. He criticized that those newspapers &quot;failed to have the slightest influence upon the nation as a society&quot;.

==Literary career==

Liang Qichao was both a traditional Confucian scholar and a reformist. Liang Qichao contributed to the reform in late Qing by writing various articles interpreting non-Chinese ideas of history and government, with the intent of stimulating Chinese citizens&#x27; minds to build a new China. In his writings, he argued that China should protect the ancient teachings of Confucianism, but also learn from the successes of Western political life and not just Western technology.

Liang shaped the ideas of democracy in China, using his writings as a medium to combine Western scientific methods with traditional Chinese historical studies. Liang&#x27;s works were strongly influenced by the Japanese political scholar Katō Hiroyuki, who used methods of social Darwinism to promote the statist ideology in Japanese society. Liang drew from much of his work and subsequently influenced Korean nationalists in the 1900s.

After the failure of constitutional reform, Liang founded the literary journal &quot;New Fiction&quot; as part of his effort to encourage intellectuals to use fiction for pedagogical and political purposes. Its inaugural editorial includes a saying by Liang which became famous: &quot;to renew a people, we must first renew their fictions.&quot; In &quot;New Fiction&quot;, Liang published his novella &quot;The Future of New China&quot;. The novella depicts arguments between two characters who support constitutional monarchy and republican revolution respectively. The characters contest their political differences but are also connected through their desire to revive Chinese culture and the nation.

===Historiographical thought===
Liang Qichao&#x27;s historiographical thought represents the beginning of modern Chinese historiography and reveals some important directions of Chinese historiography in the twentieth century.

For Liang, the major flaw of &quot;old historians&quot; () was their failure to foster the national awareness necessary for a strong and modern nation. Liang&#x27;s call for new history not only pointed to a new orientation for historical writing in China, but also indicated the rise of modern historical consciousness among Chinese intellectuals. He advocated the Great Man theory in his 1899 piece, &quot;Heroes and the Times&quot; (, &quot;Yīngxióng yǔ Shíshì&quot;), and he also wrote biographies of European state-builders such as Otto von Bismarck, Horatio Nelson, Oliver Cromwell, Lajos Kossuth, Giuseppe Mazzini, and Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour; as well as Chinese men including Zheng He, Tan Sitong, and Wang Anshi.

During this period of Japan&#x27;s challenge in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–95), Liang was involved in protests in Beijing pushing for an increased participation in the governance by the Chinese people. It was the first protest of its kind in modern Chinese history. This changing outlook on tradition was shown in the historiographical revolution () launched by Liang Qichao in the early twentieth century. Frustrated by his failure at political reform, Liang embarked upon cultural reform. In 1902, while in exile in Japan, Liang wrote &quot;The New Historiography&quot; (), which called on Chinese to study world history to understand China rather than just Chinese history. The article also attacked old historiographical methods, which he lamented focused on dynasty over state; the individual over the group; the past but not the present; and facts, rather than ideals.

===Translator===

Liang was head of the Translation Bureau and oversaw the training of students who were learning to translate Western works into Chinese. He believed that this task was &quot;the most essential of all essential undertakings to accomplish&quot; because he believed Westerners were successful - politically, technologically and economically.

Philosophical Works: After escaping Beijing and the government crackdown on anti-Qing protesters, Liang studied the works of Western philosophers of the Enlightenment period, namely Hobbes, Rousseau, Locke, Hume and Bentham, translating them and introducing his own interpretation of their works. His essays were published in a number of journals, drawing interest among Chinese intellectuals who had been taken aback by the dismemberment of China&#x27;s formidable empire at the hands of foreign powers.

Western Social and Political Theories: In the early 20th century, Liang Qichao played a significant role in introducing Western social and political theories into Korea such as Social Darwinism and international law. Liang wrote in his well-known manifesto, &quot;New People&quot; ():

:&quot;“Freedom means Freedom for the Group, not Freedom for the Individual. (…) Men must not be slaves to other men, but they must be slaves to their group. For, if they are not slaves to their own group, they will assuredly become slaves to some other.”&quot;

===Poet and novelist===
Liang advocated reform in both the genres of poem and novel. The &quot;Collected Works from the Ice-Drinker&#x27;s Studio&quot; () is his representative works in literature compiled into 148 volumes.

Liang gained his idea of calling his work as &quot;Collected Works of Yinbingshi&quot; from a passage of Zhuangzi. It states that &quot;Every morning, I receive the mandate [for action], every evening I drink the ice [of disillusion], but I remain ardent in my inner mind&quot; (). As a result, Liang called his workplace as &quot;The Ice-drinker&#x27;s studio&quot; (Yinbingshi), and addressed himself as &quot;Yinbingshi Zhuren&quot; (), literally &quot;Host of the Ice-drinker&#x27;s studio&quot;, in order to present his idea that he was worrying about all the political matters, so he would still try his best to reform the society by the effort of writings.

Liang also wrote fiction and scholarly essays on fiction, which included &quot;Fleeing to Japan after failure of Hundred Days&#x27; Reform&quot; (1898) and the essay &quot;On the Relationship Between Fiction and the Government of the People&quot; , 1902). These novels emphasized modernization in the West and the call for reform.

===Educator===
In the early 1920s, Liang retired from politics and taught at the Tung-nan University in Shanghai and Tsinghua University Research Institute in Peking. He founded the &quot;Jiangxue she&quot; (Chinese Lecture Association) and brought important intellectual figures to China, including Driesch and Rabindranath Tagore. Academically he was a renowned scholar of his time, introducing Western learning and ideology, and making extensive studies of ancient Chinese culture. He was impacted by a social-Darwinian perspective to researched approaches to combine the western thought and Chinese learning.

As an educator, Liang Qichao thought children were the future of the development of China, and he thought the education was significant for children&#x27;s growth, and the traditional education approaches needed to be changed, and the educational reformation was important in Modern China. He thought children needed to cultivate creative thinking and improve the ability of understanding, and the new school became important to instruct children in the new approaches in the education. 

During this last decade of his life, published studies of Chinese cultural history, Chinese literary history and historiography. Liang reexamined the works of Mozi, and authored, amongst other works, &quot;The Political Thought of the Pre-Qing Period&quot;, and &quot;Intellectual Trends in the Qing Period.&quot; He also had a strong interest in Buddhism and wrote historical and political articles on its influence in China. Liang influenced many of his students in producing their own literary works. They included Xu Zhimo, renowned modern poet, and Wang Li, an accomplished poet and founder of Chinese linguistics as a modern discipline.

<text>Illustrated [[Apocalypse]] manuscripts are manuscripts that contain the text of Revelation or a commentary on Revelation and also illustrations. Most of these Apocalypses were written between 1250 and 1400. The English Apocalypses are part of a larger group of Apocalypses called: the Anglo-Norman Apocalypses.

These manuscripts can be divided by the language and form of the Apocalypse text. Many manuscripts have a Latin text, others have an Anglo-Norman prose text and others have a French verse text combined with a Latin text. Two manuscripts do not have a separate text, but incorporate excerpts from the text into the illustrations.
The illustrations can be divided into several iconographic groups. 

Paul Meyer and Léopold Delisle, in their book &quot;L&#x27;Apocalypse en français au XIIIe siècle (Paris MS fr. 403)&quot;, 2 vols., Paris, 1901, were the first scholars to try to list, describe and categorize the Apocalypse manuscripts. 

M. R. James also wrote about illustrated Apocalypse manuscripts in his book &quot;The Apocalypse in Art&quot;, London, 1931.
Since M. R. James&#x27; work, there have been a number of more recent studies by R. Freyhan, George Henderson, Peter Klein, Suzanne Lewis, Nigel Morgan and Lucy Sandler.

<doc id="1029590" wikidata="Q1049117" url="?curid=1029590" title="Shinsekai">
<text>is an old neighbourhood located next to south Osaka City&#x27;s downtown &quot;Minami&quot; area. The neighbourhood was created in 1912 with New York (specifically, Coney Island) as a model for its southern half and Paris for its northern half. At this location, a Luna Park amusement park operated from 1912 until it closed in 1923. The centrepiece of the neighbourhood was Tsutenkaku Tower (the &quot;tower reaching to heaven&quot;).

As a result of minimal redevelopment after World War II, the area has become one of Japan&#x27;s poorest. 

==History and reputation==

Despite its negative image and commonly held reputation as Osaka&#x27;s most dangerous area, Shinsekai boasts a colourful history and unique identity. At the beginning of the 20th century the neighbourhood flourished as a local tourist attraction showcasing the city&#x27;s modern image. After World War II, the area served to entertain the laborers who were rebuilding Osaka. Shinsekai&#x27;s status as a dangerous area owes much to criminal activity that flourished in the decades before the 1990s.

Whether the stigma surrounding Shinsekai is deserved is open to debate. Many Osakans claim to be afraid to set foot in the area. The travel guide &quot;Lonely Planet Japan&quot;, warns visitors to &quot;keep their wits about them&quot; as Shinsekai may be the &quot;closest thing in Japan to a dangerous neighbourhood&quot;. Although in the 15th edition of this travel guide, published in 2017, this is not mentioned anymore. 

Continuing the area&#x27;s chequered fortunes of recent years, in place of rampant criminality, Osaka&#x27;s large permanent settlement of homeless has taken root in the areas around Shinsekai. Homeless men, often elderly, from all over Japan come to Osaka to escape the stigma of hometown societal shame and wander the streets around the area. The neighbourhood is also home to a large presence of prostitutes and a concentration of Osaka&#x27;s cross-dressing community.

===Attractions===

Though its elements of seediness and destitution are often highlighted, Shinsekai is also home to a large number of legitimate business outlets. It is the scene of low-cost restaurants, cheap clothing stores, cinemas, shogi and mahjong clubs, and pachinko parlours.

Shinsekai has several fugu (blowfish) restaurants, but the neighbourhood&#x27;s real culinary forte is kushi-katsu. The neighbourhood abounds with kushi-katsu restaurants offering various kinds of meat, fish, and vegetables all breaded and deep fried on small sticks for around each.

Shinsekai lies west of Tennoji Zoo, Tennoji Park, and the Osaka Municipal Museum of Art. To the south is Spa World and the now-closed Festival Gate, a compact amusement park built to rejuvenate Osaka&#x27;s most run-down area. Instead of trying to blend the park into Shinsekai, its construction resulted in virtually barricading it from the surrounding neighbourhood. It remained open for nearly seven years but in February 2004 a joint-venture behind the operation went into bankruptcy, effectively shutting down the complex for the most part. As an amusement space, it was no match for nearby Universal Studios Japan, which opened in 2001. In early 2008, the city began calling for tenders from prospective buyers although, by this point, a crepe shop adjoining Spa World was the only business still operating in the empty complex.

The top of Tsutenkaku Tower provides a panoramic and unobstructed view of Osaka. The original Tsutenkaku Tower, completed in 1912 and tall, was designed to resemble both the Eiffel Tower (at the top) and the Arc de Triomphe (at the base), and was one end of a tramway connecting the neighborhood with the Luna Park grounds. It was damaged by fire in 1943 and disassembled, then replaced in 1956 with the current structure, which is tall and designed by Tachū Naitō (also known for the design of Tokyo Tower).

<doc id="1029596" wikidata="Q157697" url="?curid=1029596" title="Juniperus chinensis">
<text>Juniperus chinensis, the Chinese juniper, is a species of plant in the cypress family Cupressaceae, native to China, Myanmar, Japan, Korea and the Russian Far East. Growing tall, it is a very variable coniferous evergreen tree or shrub.

A variety of &quot;Juniperus chinensis&quot; referred to as &quot;Shimpaku&quot; is one of the top species used in the Japanese art of bonsai. Among the multiple cultivars of Shimpaku found in Japan, the most desirable due to its tight, fine foliage and excellent growing habits, is the &quot;Itoigawa&quot; variety.
==Growth==
The leaves grow in two forms, juvenile needle-like leaves long, and adult scale-leaves 1.5–3 mm long. Mature trees usually continue to bear some juvenile foliage as well as adult, particularly on shaded shoots low in the crown. This species is often dioecious (either male or female plants), but some individual plants produce both sexes of flowers. The blue-black berry-like cones grow to 7–12 mm in diameter, have a whitish waxy bloom, and contain 2–4 seeds; they mature in about 18 months. The male cones, 2–4 mm long, shed their pollen in early spring.

==Cultivation and uses==
This popular ornamental tree or shrub for gardens, parks, and in tough coastal conditions of hot sun and sandy fast-draining soils, has more than 100 named cultivars selected for various characteristics, such as yellow foliage (e.g. cvs. &#x27;Aurea&#x27;, &#x27;Tremonia&#x27;), permanently juvenile foliage (e.g. cv. &#x27;Shoosmith&#x27;), columnar crown shape (cv. &#x27;Columnaris&#x27;), abundant cones, spiral branch pattern (e.g. cv. &#x27;Kaizuka&#x27;), etc. First popular in the United States in the Los Angeles gardens in Mediterranean style homes, and now commonly found along both the West and East Coast in beach and coastal areas.

The Chinese juniper is widely used in bonsai, both as individual plants, such as the 250-year-old &quot;Omiya tree&quot; in the Birmingham Botanical Gardens in the UK, and in groups, such as the well-known &quot;Goshin&quot; on display at the National Bonsai and Penjing Museum at the US National Arboretum. The cultivar &#x27;Shimpaku&#x27; is a very important bonsai subject.

===AGM cultivars===
The following cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit:

* &#x27;Aurea&#x27; (golden Chinese juniper)
* &#x27;Blaauw&#x27;
* &#x27;Grey Owl&#x27;
* &#x27;Kaizuka&#x27;
* &#x27;Plumosa Aurea&#x27;
* &#x27;Pyramidalis&#x27;
===&quot;Juniperus&quot; × &quot;pfitzeriana&quot;===
The hybrid between &quot;Juniperus chinensis&quot; and &quot;Juniperus sabina&quot;, known as &quot;Juniperus&quot; × &quot;pfitzeriana&quot; (Pfitzer juniper, synonym &quot;J.&quot; × &quot;media&quot;), is also very common as a cultivated plant. This hybrid grows only as a shrub, never a tree, making it suitable for smaller gardens:
* &#x27;Old Gold&#x27; 
* &#x27;Sulphur Spray&#x27;

<text>Rebel is a 1969 novel by Ghanaian writer Bediako Asare about the conflict between tradition and modernity in Africa. The novel was published as part of the influential Heinemann African Writers Series. 

== Plot ==
Set on an imaginary island off the African coast, it tells the story of the remote village of Pachanga, still unknown to the rest of the island, and the inhabitants who still live a traditional lifestyle, untouched by modern innovations. According to Asare, their existence is far from idyllic. They are governed by a Mzee Matata, a fetish priest, who refuses to allow any innovations to undermine his authority, but after many years of cultivating the same land and fishing the same stream, the soil is overworked, the fish are being rapidly depleted, and the villagers are facing starvation.

Only one villager, Ngurumo, dares to challenge the fetish priest by suggesting that the villagers relocate to a fertile valley on the other side of the jungle. Mzee Matata rejects this idea, arguing that the villagers are suffering because they have displeased the gods. He regards Ngurumo as a threat, and attempts to have him killed during a hunting expedition. When this fails, Ngurumo realizes how dangerous it is for him to remain in the village, and together with his wife Seitu, he sneaks away at night and builds a new life for himself in the valley.

To Mzee Matata, Mgurumo&#x27;s disappearance and the possibility that he is living well while the rest of the people suffer is a serious challenge to his authority, especially as the people are starving. At a meeting of the entire village, he explains to them that the gods are angry with Pachanga because of Ngurumo and because the villagers have abandoned the ancient practice of human sacrifice. That night, he sends a group of hunters led by Fundi to the valley to bring back Ngurumo and Seitu so that they can be sacrificed and the village spared.

Ngurumo and Seitu are brought back to the village and prepared for sacrifice. As Mzee Matata raises his knife to plunge it into Seitu&#x27;s belly, there is suddenly a loud pop, and he falls dead to the ground. He was shot by Shabani, a government surveyor, who happened upon the valley by chance just as the ceremony was about to take place. Shabani startles the villagers with his stick (his rifle) which can kill a powerful fetish priest at a distance and the many other wonders he shows them. He befriends Ngurumo and begins to prepare him for a new leadership role for the villagers. He is, however, insistent that the choice be made democratically, and that Ngurumo be elected. His chief rival is Fundi, who inherits the role of fetish priest from Mzee Matata.

Ngurumo wins the election and takes a group of men to the valley to build a new villager. Upon their return, they discover that Fundi has attempted a coup: Shabani was killed by a python in a trap set for him by Fundi, and Seitu has been kidnapped and will only be released, according to Fundi, if Ngurumo hands his authority to him. Ngurumo leads another group of men to rescue Seitu just as she is about to be killed, then returns to the village and challenges Fundi to a fight to the death. After winning the struggle, he leads the people to the new village, and plans on sending an expedition across the mountains to the modern people that Shabani described.

== Analysis ==
The plot of &quot;Rebel&quot; is not sophisticated, and in many instances is reminiscent of colonial works by Rudyard Kipling or H. Rider Haggard, depicting the cruelty of a &quot;primitive&quot; society not yet rescued by the forces of civilization (though in this case, civilization is brought by an African, rather than a white imperialist). In this sense, Asare&#x27;s book is unusual in African literature in the importance it places on Western civilization and ideas and its disparaging attitude toward traditional African customs. It often tends to preach, particularly when Shabani explains to Ngurumo the benefits of democracy.

It is important as a reflection of Asare&#x27;s and other African intellectuals&#x27; views on how to liberate their countries from colonialism—in fact, the book never mentions where Pachanga is located, and it could be a metaphor for any country in Africa during the post-colonial period. Through this book, Asare seems to say that the best possible future for entire continent lies, not in attempting to revive the ancient tribal past, but in looking to modern ideas and democratic principles, even if this means the complete rejection of long-established traditions.

<text>A naval flight officer (NFO) is a commissioned officer in the United States Navy or United States Marine Corps who specializes in airborne weapons and sensor systems. NFOs are not pilots (naval aviators), but they may perform many &quot;co-pilot&quot; or &quot;mission specialist&quot; functions, depending on the type of aircraft. Until 1966, their duties were performed by both commissioned officers known as Naval Aviation Officers (NAO) and senior enlisted personnel known as Naval Aviation Observers (NAO).

In 1966, enlisted personnel were removed from naval aviation observer duties. The principal catalyst for this action was due to many of the aircraft that NAOs flew having nuclear weapons missions and concerns within the OPNAV staff and the Office of the Secretary of Defense over enlisted personnel having the ability to release/drop nuclear weapons. The enlisted NAOs continued to serve in enlisted Naval Aircrewman roles while NAO officers received the newly established Naval Flight Officer (NFO) designation, and the NFO insignia was introduced. NFOs in the U.S. Navy begin their careers as unrestricted line officers (URL), eligible for command at sea and ashore in the various naval aviation aircraft type/model/series (T/M/S) communities and, at a senior level, in command of carrier air wings and aircraft carriers afloat and functional air wings, naval air stations and other activities ashore. They are also eligible for promotion to senior flag rank positions, including command of aircraft carrier strike groups, expeditionary strike groups, joint task forces, numbered fleets, naval component commands and unified combatant commands.

A small number of U.S. Navy NFOs have later opted for a lateral transfer to the restricted line (RL) as aeronautical engineering duty officers (AEDO), while continuing to retain their NFO designation and active flight status. Such officers are typically graduates of the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School and/or the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School with advanced academic degrees in aerospace engineering or similar disciplines. AEDO/NFOs are eligible to command test and evaluation squadrons, naval air test centers, naval air warfare centers, and hold major program management responsibilities within the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR).

Similarly, U.S. Marine Corps NFOs are also considered eligible for command at sea and ashore within Marine aviation, and are also eligible to hold senior general officer positions, such as command of Marine aircraft wings, Marine air-ground task forces (MAGTFs), joint task forces, Marine expeditionary forces, Marine Corps component commands and unified combatant commands.

The counterpart to the NFO in the United States Air Force is the combat systems officer (CSO), encompassing the previous roles of USAF navigator, weapon systems officer and electronic warfare officer. Although NFOs in the Navy&#x27;s E-2 Hawkeye aircraft perform functions similar to the USAF air battle manager in the E-3 Sentry AWACS aircraft, their NFO training track is more closely aligned with that of USAF combat systems officers.

The United States Coast Guard had a short-lived NFO community in the 1980s and 1990s when it operated E-2C Hawkeye aircraft on loan from the Navy. Following a fatal mishap with one of these E-2C aircraft at the former Naval Station Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico, the Coast Guard returned the remaining E-2Cs to the Navy and disestablished its NFO program.

==Training==
===Overview===

Training for student NFOs (SNFOs) starts out the same as for student naval aviators (SNAs), with the same academic requirements and nearly identical physical requirements. The only real distinction in physical requirements is that SNFOs may have less than 20/40 uncorrected distance vision. Both SNAs and SNFOs complete Naval Introductory Flight Evaluation (NIFE) at Naval Aviation Schools Command (NAVAVSCOLSCOM) at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida before splitting off into different primary training tracks.

The SNFO program has continued to evolve since the 1960s. Today, SNFOs train under the Undergraduate Military Flight Officer (UMFO) program at Training Air Wing 6 at NAS Pensacola, alongside foreign students from various NATO, Allied and Coalition navies and air forces. All Student NFOs begin primary training at Training Squadron TEN (VT-10), flying the T-6A Texan II trainer, eventually moving on to advanced training at Training Squadron 4 (VT-4) or Training Squadron 86 (VT-86). Upon graduation from their respective advanced squadron, students receive their &quot;wings of gold&quot; and are designated as naval flight officers. After winging, students conduct follow-on training at their respective fleet replacement squadron (FRS) before proceeding to their initial operational assignments in combat coded, deployable fleet aviation squadrons for what is nominally a three year assignment during which time they will become Mission Commander qualified in their respective fleet aircraft.

===NFO training squadrons===

===Naval Introductory Flight Evaluation===
All SNFOs and SNAs start their aviation training with naval introductory flight evaluation (NIFE). NIFE consists of several phases: academics, ground school, flight training, and physiology. The academics portion spans three weeks and covers aerodynamics, engines, FAA rules and regulations, navigation, and weather. Academics phase is followed by one week of ground school. Every student then enrolls in one of two civilian flight schools located near NAS Pensacola. Students complete approximately 9 hours of flight training in a single engine aircraft. NIFE flights can be waived based on proficiency for students entering training with a private pilot license. After the flight phase, students will complete training in aerospace physiology, egress, and water &amp; land survival.

===Primary===
After completing NIFE, all SNFOs report to VT-10 under Training Air Wing 6 to begin primary training. All training in VT-10 is done in the Beechcraft T-6A Texan II and consists of two stages (each stage consist of ground school, simulator events, and flight events):
* Familiarization Stage (aircraft systems, emergency procedures, basic communication, take-off/landing, ELPs, spins, precision aerobatics, course rules)
* Navigation Stage (Instrument and visual flight procedures, airway navigation, tactical route construction)

After graduating from Primary, SNFOs will select between multi crew aviation or strike aviation. Students selected for multi-crew training (E-2 Hawkeye, P-8A Poseidon, E-6B Mercury) will continue on to the Maritime Command and Control (MC2) curriculum at VT-4. Those that select strike aviation will continue to Intermediate training and remain at VT-10.
===Intermediate===
SNFOs destined for carrier-based strike fighter and electronic attack aircraft remain in VT-10 and continue to fly in the T-6A Texan II. Training consists of four stages:
* Single ship instrument stage (building upon instrument procedures in primary 1 and 2, VFR pattern, GPS navigation)
* Section instrument stage (instrument flying in formation)
* Tactical formation stage (rendezvous, tactical formation, tail-chase)
* Section visual navigation stage (visual navigation flying in formation)

===Maritime Command and Control (MC2)===
After primary, students who have selected E-2, P-8 or E-6s check into VT-4 for Maritime Command and Control (MC2) training. The MC2 program was developed to allow SNFOs to receive advanced platform-specific training while still at NAS Pensacola, and to receive their wings before progressing to their respective fleet replacement squadron (FRS) for training in their ultimate operational combat aircraft. All MC2 training is conducted in the Multi-Crew Simulator (MCS), a new simulator system that allows students to train independently, as a single-ship crew, or as a multi-ship mission. MC2 training has two phases: Intermediate and Advanced. Advanced phases are specific to the selected platform and consist of Advanced Maritime Patrol and Reconnaissance (P-8A Poseidon), Advanced Strategic Command and Control (E-6B Mercury) and Advanced Airborne Command and Control (E-2 Hawkeye).

====MC2 Intermediate====
SNFOs begin MC2 training in the MC2 Intermediate syllabus. These classes include a combination of SNFOs who selected &quot;big wing&quot; aviation out of VT-10 Primary training. Training in this phase builds upon the instrument training from Primary and includes:
* Operational flight planning, instruments, and navigation (international flight rules and TACAN navigation)
* Communications and navigation systems (comm systems and INS, GPS, and RADAR theory and navigation)
* Sensor and link operations (RADAR, IFF, and IR theory and data link employment)
* Fleet operations

Upon completion of MC2 Intermediate, SNFOs will select between E-2C/D Hawkeyes, P-8A Poseidons or E-6B Mercurys. From there all SNFOs remain at VT-4 for Advanced training in their respective pipelines.

====Advanced MC2====
Advanced MC2 training is platform-specific training in VT-4 via the MCS, allowing SNFOs destined for the carrier-based E-2 community or the land-based P-8 or E-6 communities to begin learning their responsibilities on their fleet aircraft. The development of this program relieves the associated fleet replacement squadrons from teaching SNFOs the basics of naval aviation and to focus more on advanced fleet tactics, thus streamlining FRS training, reducing costs and increasing training effectiveness and efficiency and providing fleet with better-trained, mission-capable NFOs. Upon completion of advanced stage training, students receive their &quot;wings of gold&quot; and are designated as naval flight officers.

SNFOs progress through one or two of four strands, depending on what platform they select.

Advanced Airborne Command and Control consists of:
* Airborne early warning (E-2 capabilities and mission overview)
* Air intercept control (airborne battlefield command and control, tactics, and strike techniques)

Advanced Maritime Patrol and Reconnaissance consists of:
* Surface search and littoral surveillance (community overview, target identification, sensor employment)
* Electronic warfare and acoustic operations (EW introduction, sonar theory)
* Maritime patrol and reconnaissance (coordinated operations)

Advanced Strategic Command and Control consists of:
* Strategic operations (community overview, operations, strategic command structure)
* Strategic communications and procedures

===Advanced strike===
SNFOs report to VT-86 and fly the T-45C Goshawk. Training consists of five phases:
* Contact phase (T-45 systems, emergency procedures, carrier operations, night operations, communications)
* Strike phase (air-to-ground radar, low level flying, mission planning, fuel awareness)
* Close air support phase (CAS procedures and communications)
* Basic fighter maneuver phase (BFM practice)
* All weather intercepts phase (air-to-air radar, air intercepts, GPS)

After graduating from advanced strike training, Navy SNFOs will select:
* EA-18G Growler
* F/A-18F Super Hornet

Marine SNFOs will select:
* F/A-18D Hornet

==Comparison with naval aviators==
Naval flight officers operate some of the advanced systems on board most multi-crew naval aircraft, and some may also act as the overall tactical mission commanders of single or multiple aircraft assets during a given mission. NFOs are not trained to pilot the aircraft, although they do train in some dual-control aircraft and are given the opportunity to practice &quot;hands on controls&quot; basic airmanship techniques. Some current and recently retired naval aircraft with side-by-side seating are also authorized to operate under dual-piloted weather minimums with one pilot and one NFO. However, in the unlikely event that the pilot of a single piloted naval aircraft becomes incapacitated, the crew would likely eject or bail out, if possible, as NFOs are not qualified to land the aircraft, especially in the carrier-based shipboard environment.

NFOs serve as weapon systems officers (WSOs), electronic warfare officers (EWO), electronic countermeasures officers (ECMO), tactical coordinators (TACCO), bombardiers, and navigators. They can serve as aircraft mission commanders, although in accordance with the OPNAVINST 3710 series of instructions, the pilot in command, regardless of rank, is always responsible for the safe piloting of the aircraft.

Many NFOs achieve flight/section lead, division lead, package lead, mission lead and mission commander qualification, even when the pilot of the aircraft does not have that designation. Often, a senior NFO is paired with a junior pilot (and vice versa). NFO astronauts have also flown aboard the Space Shuttle and the International Space Station as mission specialists and wear NFO-astronaut wings.

Like their naval aviator counterparts, NFOs in both the Navy and Marine Corps have commanded aviation squadrons, carrier air wings, shore-based functional air wings and air groups, Marine aircraft groups, air facilities, air stations, aircraft carriers, amphibious assault ships, carrier strike groups, expeditionary strike groups, Marine aircraft wings, Marine expeditionary forces, numbered fleets, and component commands of unified combatant commands. Three NFOs have reached four-star rank, one as a Marine Corps general having served as the Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps, and the other two as Navy admirals, one having served as Vice Chief of Naval Operations before commanding U.S. Fleet Forces Command &amp; U.S. Atlantic Fleet, U.S. Pacific Command (USPACOM) and U.S. Central Command (USCENTCOM), and the other having commanded U.S. Pacific Command, having previously commanded U.S. Pacific Fleet. Another former NFO who retrained and qualified as a Naval Aviator also achieved four-star rank as a Marine Corps general, commanded U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) and later served as Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (VCJCS).

In some quarters, NFO careers may be viewed more restrictive than their Naval Aviator (e.g., pilot) counterparts. For example, NFOs only serve aboard multi-crew naval aircraft and as certain multi-crew aircraft are retired from the active inventory, NFOs can become displaced, as happened with the withdrawal of the A-3 and EA-3, A-5 and RA-5, A-6, EA-6A, EA-6B, F-4 and RF-4, F-14 and S-3 and ES-3 from active service. In addition, as avionics have become more advanced, the need for some multi-crew aircraft using one or more NFOs has been reduced.

However, the majority of NFOs (as well as Naval Aviators) from aircraft being retired have historically been afforded the opportunity to transition to another aircraft platform, such as F-4 and F-14 transitions to the F/A-18D and F/A-18F, A-6 transitions to the F-14, EA-6B, S-3, and F/A-18D, S-3 transitions to the P-3/P-8, E-2, E-6, and F/A-18F, EA-6B transitions to the EA-18G, and P-3 and EP-3 transitions to the P-8. Although it is true that Naval Aviators can also transition their piloting expertise into civilian careers as commercial airline pilots and that NFOs are not able to similarly translate their skills into this career field unless augmented by associated FAA pilot certificates, the military aviation career opportunities of NFOs remain on par with their Naval Aviator counterparts, as do their post-military career prospects in the civilian sector in defense, aviation &amp; aerospace, as well as other career pursuits beyond that of civilian commercial airline pilot.

==Notable NFOs==
Vice Admiral Walter E. &quot;Ted&quot; Carter Jr. became the 62nd superintendent of the U.S. Naval Academy on July 23, 2014. He graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1981, was designated a Naval Flight Officer in 1982, and graduated from the U.S. Navy Fighter Weapons School (TOPGUN) in 1985. Carter&#x27;s career as an aviator includes extensive time at sea, deploying around the globe in the F-4 Phantom II and the F-14 Tomcat. He has landed on 19 different aircraft carriers, to include all 10 of the Nimitz class carriers. Carter flew 125 combat missions in support of joint operations in Bosnia, Kosovo, Kuwait, Iraq and Afghanistan. He accumulated 6,150 flight hours in F-4, F-14, and F/A-18 aircraft during his career and safely completed 2,016 carrier-arrested landings, the record among all active and retired U.S. Naval Aviation designators.

As a captain, Rear Admiral Richard Dunleavy was the first NFO to command an aircraft carrier, the (CV 43). He previously flew the A-3 Skywarrior, A-5 Vigilante, RA-5C Vigilante and A-6 Intruder. Later in his career, he was promoted to rear admiral and vice admiral, and was the first NFO to hold the since disestablished position of Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Air Warfare (OP-05). He retired in 1993 as a Rear Admiral.

Rear Admiral Stanley W. Bryant was the first NFO selected for the Navy&#x27;s Nuclear Power Program as a Commander in 1986. As a Captain, he became the first NFO to command a nuclear aircraft carrier when he took command of (CVN 71) in July 1992. In his first posting following promotion to Flag rank, he became the first NFO and first carrier aviator to command the Iceland Defense Force in Keflavik, Iceland in 1994. He was the first NFO appointed to the position of Deputy Commander (then DCINC), U.S. Naval Forces Europe and retired from that position in 2001.

Commander William P. Driscoll was the first NFO to become a flying ace, having achieved five aerial kills of VPAF fighter aircraft during the Vietnam War. Driscoll received the service&#x27;s second-highest decoration, the Navy Cross, for his role in a 1972 dogfight with North Vietnamese MiGs. Driscoll separated from active duty in 1982 but remained in the United States Naval Reserve, flying the F-4 Phantom II and later the F-14 Tomcat in a Naval Air Reserve fighter squadron at NAS Miramar, eventually retiring in 2003 with the rank of Commander (O-5).

Admiral William Fallon, an NFO who flew in the RA-5C Vigilante and the A-6 Intruder, was the first NFO to achieve four-star rank. As a three-star vice admiral, he was the first NFO to command a numbered fleet, the U.S. 2nd Fleet. He later served in four separate four-star assignments, to include command of two unified combatant commands. This included service as the 31st Vice Chief of Naval Operations from October 2000 to August 2003; the Commander, U.S. Fleet Forces Command and U.S. Atlantic Fleet from October 2003 to February 2005; Commander, U.S. Pacific Command (USPACOM) from February 2005 until March 2007; and Commander, U.S. Central Command (USCENTCOM) from March 2007 until his retirement in March 2008.

Captain Dale Gardner was the first NFO to qualify and fly as a NASA Mission Specialist astronaut aboard the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; on mission STS-8. He previously flew the F-14 Tomcat. He retired in 1990.

Rear Admiral Benjamin Thurman Hacker was the first NFO flag officer, having been selected in 1980. He previously flew the P-2 Neptune and P-3 Orion. He retired in 1988.

Admiral Harry B. Harris Jr., was the last Commander, U.S. Pacific Command (USPACOM) prior to its re-designation as U.S. Indo-Pacific Command (USINDOPACOM). He was the first NFO from the land-based maritime patrol aviation community to command a numbered fleet, the U.S. 6th Fleet, and later commanded the U.S. Pacific Fleet. He is also the first member of the Navy&#x27;s land-based maritime patrol aviation community, pilot or NFO, to promote to four-star rank. He previously flew the P-3C Orion and retired in 2018.

Vice Admiral David C. Nichols was the deputy coalition air forces component commander (deputy CFACC) during Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. He was the first NFO to command the Naval Strike and Air Warfare Center, the second NFO to command a numbered fleet, the U.S. 5th Fleet, and was later deputy commander of U.S. Central Command. He previously flew the A-6 Intruder and retired in 2007.

General William L. Nyland, USMC was the first Marine Corps NFO to achieve four-star rank as Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps. As a lieutenant general, he was also the first NFO to serve as deputy commandant for aviation. He previously flew the F-4 Phantom II and the F/A-18 Hornet. He retired in 2005.

Lieutenant General Terry G. Robling, USMC was the first Marine Corps NFO to command United States Marine Corps Forces, Pacific following an assignment as the deputy commandant for aviation. He previously flew the F-4 Phantom II and the F/A-18 Hornet. He retired in 2014.

Vice Admiral Nora W. Tyson was the Commander, United States Third Fleet from 2015 to 2017, and previously Deputy Commander, U.S. Fleet Forces Command. She was the first female NFO to command a warship, the amphibious assault ship (LHD 5), and the first female naval officer to command an aircraft carrier strike group, Carrier Strike Group Two, aboard the (CVN 77). She previously flew the land-based EC-130Q Hercules and the E-6 Mercury TACAMO aircraft. She was the first woman to command a U.S. Navy fleet, the U.S. 3rd Fleet. She retired in 2017.

Colonel John C. Church Sr., USMC was the first NFO to command a Marine F-4 squadron. He commanded VMFA-115, the Silver Eagles, from 1983 to 1984. As a Captain, Colonel Church, &quot;the Silver Fox&quot;, had previously served with VMFA-115 during the Vietnam War, during which time he and his pilot, Captain James &quot;Rebel&quot; Denton, were shot down and subsequently rescued. Colonel Church amassed more than 500 missions in the F-4. He retired in 1990.

==Fleet==
Eligible fleet platforms for NFOs are as of August 2022 are as follows:
* E-2C/D Hawkeye
* F/A-18F Super Hornet
* EA-18G Growler
* EP-3E Aries II
* P-8A Poseidon
* E-6B Mercury
* MQ-4C Triton (unmanned aircraft, remotely piloted)

In the EA-18G Growler, NFOs are designated as electronic warfare officers (EWOs) and may also be mission commanders.

In the E-2C Hawkeye and E-2D Advanced Hawkeye, NFOs are initially as designated radar officers (RO), then upgrade to air control officers (ACO) and finally to combat information center officers (CICO) and CICO/mission commanders (CICO/MC).

In the E-6B Mercury, NFOs are initially designated as airborne communications officers (ACOs), then upgrade to combat systems officers (CSOs), and finally to mission commanders (CSO/MC).

In the EP-3E Aries, NFOs are initially designated as navigators (NAV) and eventually upgrade to electronic warfare officer/signals evaluator (EWO SEVAL) and EWO/SEVAL/mission commander (SEVAL/MC).

In the F/A-18D Hornet, the NFO position is known as the weapon systems officer (WSO) and may also be mission commander qualified. Flown only within the U.S. Marine Corps, the last Marine Corps officers to be assigned to the F/A-18D as WSOs received their NFO wings in 2022. The F/A-18D will be eventually replaced in Marine Corps service with the single-seat, STOVL, F-35B Lightning II. 

In the F/A-18F Super Hornet, the NFO position is known as the weapon systems officer (WSO) and may also be mission commander qualified.

In the P-8A Poseidon, the NFO is initially designated as a co-tactical coordinator (COTAC) and upgrades to tactical coordinator (TACCO) and then TACCO/mission commander (TACCO/MC).

A single USN or USMC NFO is assigned to the United States Navy Flight Demonstration Squadron, the Blue Angels, as &quot;Blue Angel #8&quot;, the Events Coordinator. This is an operational flying billet for this officer and he or she previously flew the twin-seat F/A-18D &quot;Blue Angel 7&quot; aircraft (which had replaced the F/A-18B previously used), and now flies the twin-seat F/A-18F &quot;Blue Angel 7&quot; aircraft with the team&#x27;s advance pilot/narrator. They function as the advance liaison (ADVON) at all air show sites and the events coordinator provides backup support to the narrator during all aerial demonstrations.

NFOs have also served as instructors in the twin-seat F-5F Tiger II at the Navy Fighter Weapons School (now part of the Naval Aviation Warfighting Development Center (NAWDC)) and as instructors in twin-seat F/A-18Bs and F/A-18Fs in USN and USMC F/A-18 fleet replacement squadrons and the Navy Fighter Weapons School (NFWS, also known as TOPGUN). They have also flown a number of USAF and NATO/Allied aircraft via the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Personnel Exchange Program (PEP), to include, but not limited to, the USAF F-4 Phantom II, F-15E Strike Eagle and E-3 Sentry, the Royal Air Force Buccaneer S.2, Tornado GR1/GR1B/GR4/GR4A and Nimrod MR.2, and the Royal Canadian Air Force CP-140 Aurora.

In all, the specific roles filled by an NFO can vary greatly depending on the type of aircraft and squadron to which an NFO is assigned.

<text>The Ghana national football team represents Ghana in men&#x27;s international football. The team is named the Black Stars after the Black Star of Africa in the flag of Ghana. It is governed by the Ghana Football Association, the governing body for football in Ghana. Prior to 1957, it played as the Gold Coast.

Ghana qualified for the FIFA World Cup for the first time in 2006. The team has won the Africa Cup of Nations four times (1963, 1965, 1978, and 1982), while finishing as runners-up five times (1968, 1970, 1992, 2010, and 2015). They have also qualified for the CHAN four times, finishing as runners-up twice (2009 and 2014). 

The Official Jersey colours for the Black Stars and other national teams of Ghana are White for home games and Yellow for away games.

==History==
On 19 August 1962 at the Accra Sports Stadium, hosted Real Madrid, who were at the time Spanish champions, former European champions and intercontinental champions and drew 3–3.

Charles Kumi Gyamfi became coach in 1961, and they won successive African Cup of Nations titles, in 1963 and 1965. The Black Stars achieved their record win, 13–2 away to Kenya, after the second of these. They reached the final of the tournament in 1968 and 1970, losing 1–0 on both occasions, to DR Congo in 1968 and Sudan in 1970. Their domination of the tournament earned them the nickname &quot;the Black Stars of Africa&quot; in the 1960s.

Fortunes changed for the Black Stars however, after they failed to qualify for 3 successive African Cup of Nations in the 1970s. In the early 1980s however, with emerging talents such as Abedi Pele, the Black Stars beat Libya in the 1982 African Cup of Nations final hosted by Libya to win their fourth and to date, last continental title. Fortunes changed again however, as in the 1984 tournament, they were knocked out in the group stages, and did not qualify for the 1986, 1988 and 1990 tournaments. In 1992 however, the Black Stars would come runners-up to the Ivory Coast in a penalty shootout after a goalless draw, which saw every player on the pitch take a penalty, in which they were beaten 11-10. The Black Stars were at a disadvantage however, as African Footballer of the Year winner and the tournament&#x27;s best player, Abedi Pele, had been suspended for the final.

Tensions among the squad led to the parliamentary and executive to intervene and settle issues between star players Abedi Pele and Tony Yeboah. In the 1990s, this may have played some part in the failure of the team to build on the successes of the national underage teams. However, the generation of Black Stars players who went to the 2001 FIFA World Youth Championship final became the &quot;core&quot; of the team at the 2002 African Cup of Nations, going undefeated for a year in 2005 and qualifying for the final tournament of the 2006 FIFA World Cup. The Black Stars started by succumbing to a 2–0 defeat to eventual champions Italy, and wins over Czech Republic (2–0) and United States (2–1). This saw them advance through to the second round, where they lost 3–0 to Brazil.

Under head coach Milovan Rajevac, the Black Stars went on to secure a 100% win record in their qualification campaign, winning their group and becoming the first African team to qualify for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. In the final tournament, they were placed in Group D with Germany, Serbia and Australia, advancing to the round of 16 where they played the United States, winning 2–1 in extra time to become only the third African nation to reach the World Cup quarter-finals. They then lost to Uruguay in a penalty shootout in the quarter-finals, after Uruguayan forward Luis Suárez blocked a header with his hand in the penalty box in extra time and was sent off. Asamoah Gyan missed the penalty given for the handball, with the score remaining at 1-1. Ghana went on to lose the penalty shootout 4-2, not making it to the semi-finals which would have been the first time an African country qualified for the semi-finals of a World Cup.

In 2013, it became the only team in Africa to reach 4 consecutive semi-finals of the CAF Africa Cup of Nations twice, the first time since between 1963 and 1970.

The Black Stars were sufficiently ranked by FIFA to start their qualifying for the 2014 World Cup in the second round. They won their group, and in the following round qualified for the 2014 World Cup finals in November 2013, after beating Egypt 7–3 on aggregate in a 2-legged play-off. They were drawn in Group G for the finals, where they faced Germany, Portugal, and the United States. They exited in the group stages recording 1 draw and 2 losses. However, they were the only team to not lose to Germany in the tournament, and the only team to hold onto a lead against the Germans at any point, drawing 2-2 (and leading 2-1) with the eventual winners.

In the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations, they reached the final, to be denied the title on penalties against Ivory Coast. While their 2017 Africa Cup of Nations campaign ended in a 4th place finish - the third one in 4 consecutive editions of the tournament - in the qualifiers for the 2018 World Cup, they finished behind Egypt and Uganda in their final group. At the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations, they were eliminated by Tunisia in the Round of 16. In 2021, Manager Rajevac was brought back, but the Black Stars ended up failing to win a match at the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations where they lost 2–3 to debutants the Comoros after an André Ayew red card to finish bottom of their group. Thus, they failed to progress beyond the group stage for the first time since 2006. They drew 0–0 in a match against Nigeria and drew 1–1 in Nigeria to qualify for the 2022 FIFA World Cup on away goals. During the 2022 FIFA World Cup, Ghana lost their first match against Portugal (3–2). They earned their first and only victory in their second match against South Korea 3–2 after an insane thriller. In a &quot;must win match to qualify&quot; against Uruguay, the opponent that kicked out Ghana 12 years ago, Ghana instead lost 2–0 and thus finished bottom; however, despite failing to avenge the loss, South Korea&#x27;s 2–1 win over Portugal ensured Ghana to have a consolation prize by also sending out Uruguay from the competition on the virtue of goals scored.

Ghana shockingly failed to qualify for the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations, as they finished bottom of the group below Angola, Sudan, and Niger. Meaning The Black Stars will miss out on the tournament since 2004.

== Culture ==
=== Kits and crest ===

Adopted following the independence of Ghana in 1957, the black star has been included in the Black Stars&#x27; kits. The &quot;Black Stars&quot;&#x27; kits were sponsored by Puma SE from 2005, with the deal ending in 2014.

Between 1990 and 2006 the Ghana national team used the kit in the colours of the national flag of Ghana, with gold, green and red used, as in the team&#x27;s crest and also known as the Pan-African colours. The gold with green and red kit concept and design was used in the 60s and 70s, and designed with gold and green vertical stripes and red shoulders. An all black second kit was introduced in 2008 and in 2015, Black Stars&#x27; gold-red-green coloured kit and all black coloured kit is to be reassigned to the position of 1st and 2nd kits following the induction of a brown with blue and gold coloured Black Stars 3rd kit in 2012.

The team&#x27;s kit for the 2014 FIFA World Cup was ranked as the best kit of the tournament by BuzzFeed.


===Grounds===
The training facilities and training grounds are located at Agyeman Badu Stadium, Berekum Sports Stadium in Brong-Ahafo, the Tema Sports Stadium in Tema and the multi-functional Lizzy Sports Complex in Legon.

===Organization and finance===
The Black Stars had no official head because of &quot;corrupt&quot; practices by the then president, Kwesi Nyantakyi and vice-president George Afriyie, with Frank Davis as director of football, and Edward Bawa as treasurer. The Ghana Football Association (GFA) signed a CN¥92.2 million (US$15 million) deal with Ghanaian state-run oil and gas exploration corporation, Ghana National Petroleum Corporation (GNPC), to sponsor the Black Stars and the renewable contract saw the oil and gas exploration corporation become the global headline sponsor of the Black Stars, with a yearly Black Stars player salary wage bill, following the gold mining corporations Ashanti Goldfields Corporation and Goldfields Ghana Limited (GGL), which had been sponsoring the Black Stars since 2005.

On 28 August 2013, Ghana Football Association (GFA) launched a TV channel and named GFA TV. The channel has the exclusive rights to broadcast all the Black Stars&#x27; matches. In November 2013, the Black Stars signed a 2013–2015 CN¥30.6 million (US$5 million) and an additional classified multi-million private bank sponsorship deal with the Ghanaian state-run private banking institution UniBank.

===Supporters===

The Black Stars maintain an average stadium match attendance of 60,000+ and a match attendance high of 80,000+, such as in the case of its 2010 FIFA World Cup quarter-final against Uruguay which was attended by 84,017 spectators. Ghana&#x27;s match against England on 29 March 2011 had the largest away following for any association football national team since the re-opening of Wembley Stadium in 2007. The match was watched by 700 million people around the world.

Following the team&#x27;s appearances at the 2006 and 2010 World Cup tournaments, they were greeted by some hundred avid fans dancing and singing at Kotoka International Airport in Accra.

===Rivalries===
A rivalry is with the Super Eagles, the Nigeria national team. The &quot;Battle of Supremacy on the Gulf of Guinea&quot; is between two of the &quot;most successful teams on the African continent&quot;. The proximity of the two countries to each other, a dispute between the different association football competitions and wider diplomatic competition for influence across West Africa add to this rivalry. The match between these two countries is called the Jollof derby.

Other rivalries include the rivalry with Egypt and international rivalries with USA as well as Uruguay.

===Media and arts===
Match schedules are broadcast in English as in the case of inter-continental matches and in Akan nationally by Adom TV, PeaceFM, AdomFM and HappyFM. During the scheduled qualification for the 2014 World Cup national broadcaster GTV, a sub-division of the Ghana Broadcasting Corporation (GBC), broadcast to the Ghanaian public home qualifiers with away qualifiers broadcast by the satellite television broadcasting corporation Viasat 1. The friendly match against Turkey in August 2013 was televised by Viasat 1 and the qualifiers for the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations and the 2018 Inter-Continental Championships are scheduled for public broadcast by the corporations GFA TV, GBC and Viasat 1.

Products including books, documentary films, Azonto dances and songs have been made in the name of the team. These may be intended with commercial motives and are focused on previous and future World Cups or Africa Cup of Nations tournaments.

* Books: books have been published on the team&#x27;s history and participation in tournaments. These include &quot;Ghana, The Rediscovered Soccer Might: Watch Out World!&quot;, about the history and performance of the Black Stars and association football national teams that the Black Stars have played against, and &quot;The Black Stars of Ghana&quot; by Alan Whelan; about Black Stars commencing their progress through the final rounds of the 2010 World Cup and into the quarter-finals.
* Documentary films: In 2010 Miracle Films Ghana Limited showcased a vintage documentary film picture, &quot;Kwame Nkrumah &amp; Ghana&#x27;s Black Stars&quot;, about Osagyefo Kwame Nkrumah &quot;Africa&#x27;s man of the 2nd millennium&quot; and &quot;Pan-African pioneer&quot;, who invested energy into making Ghana&#x27;s association football national team – the Black Stars – a force in African soccer.
* Nickname: The Black Star Line, a shipping industry line incorporated by the founder of the Back-to-Africa movement, civil rights movement leader Marcus Garvey and the organiser of the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League (UNIA) from 1919 to 1922, gives the Ghana team its nicknames, the Black Stars of West Africa and the Black Stars of Africa.
* Dances: upon the Black Stars scoring against opposition teams, dance forms of the Ghanaian Azonto were performed by Black Stars players in their goal celebrations in match victories at the 2010 World Cup and in 2013, an elite dance version of the Ghanaian Azonto named; &quot;()&quot; (&quot;shrimp&quot;), was established and showcased at the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations by the Black Stars players. Black Stars goal celebrations in match victories at the 2014 World Cup and upon scoring against opposition teams, are to establish and showcase Alkayida.
* Songs: On occasions of past World Cups or African Championships, a number of musicians with music producers created hiplife football songs which were composed in the Akan language – the 2006 World Cup song, &quot;&quot;, (Black Stars, We are moving forward) musical composed by the Musicians Union of Ghana, is to motivate the Black Stars to perform creditably in its quest for the capturing of the World Cup trophy. Black Stars&#x27; captain and top-goalscorer Asamoah Gyan recorded and released a Hiplife song with &#x27;Castro The Destroyer&#x27;, where he features under the alias &#x27;Baby Jet&#x27;. The song is entitled &quot;African Girls&quot; and is sung in the Akan language and was launched onto the Ghanaian screens, continental West Africa screens and onto the Sub-Saharan Africa screens. The music video shows the &quot;Asamoah Gyan Dance&quot; goal celebration which he demonstrated at the 2010 World Cup. The song &quot;African Girls&quot; won an award at the Ghana Music Awards in 2011. The 2010 World Cup song, &quot;Ghana Black Stars (Official Song 2010 World Cup)&quot; composed by Ghanaian hiplife music group &quot;Kings and Queens Entertainment&quot; approved by the Ghana Football Association (GFA) as GFA has indicated that the Black Stars are a protected brand.

===FIFA World Cup===

Ghana have qualified for 4 FIFA World Cup tournaments; 2006, 2010, 2014, and 2022. In 2006, it was the only African side to advance to the second round of the World Cup in Germany, and was the 6th nation in a row from Africa to progress beyond the group stages of the World Cup. It had the youngest team in the 2006 edition with an average age of 23 years and 352 days, and were praised for their improving performance. FIFA ranked it 13th out of the 32 countries who competed in the tournament.

In the 2010 World Cup, it progressed beyond the group stages of the World Cup in South Africa, and reached the quarter-finals where it was eliminated by Uruguay. It was defeated on penalty shootout after Luis Suárez hand-balled on the goal line into extra time, preventing a possible winning goal. Of the 32 countries that participated in the 2010 edition, FIFA ranked it 7th.

After beating Egypt 7–3 on aggregate in November 2013, it qualified for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. It was drawn in Group G with Germany, United States and Portugal. For the first time, it fell in the group stage, tying Germany 2–2 and

<text>The Committee of Members of the Constituent Assembly () was an anti-Bolshevik government that operated in Samara, Russia, during the Russian Civil War of 1917–1922. It formed on June 8, 1918, after the Czechoslovak Legion had occupied the city.

==Nomenclature==
In Russian, the committee was called &quot;Комитет членов Учредительного собрания,&quot; transliterated as &quot;Komitet chlenov uchreditelnogo sobraniya.&quot; The initial consonants of the first and third words gave Комуч, transliterated as &quot;Komuch,&quot; as the shorthand name for the committee.

==History==

Komuch proclaimed itself the highest authority in Russia, temporarily acting on behalf of the Russian Constituent Assembly in the territory occupied by the interventionists and the White Movement until the convocation of a new Assembly. Initially, Komuch consisted of five Socialist-RevolutionariesVladimir Vol&#x27;skii (chairman), Ivan Brushvit, Prokopiy Klimushkin, Boris Fortunatov and Ivan Nesterovformer members of the Constituent Assembly that had been dissolved by the Bolsheviks. Two other members, N. Shmelev and V. Abramov, are named in a declaration issued by Komuch that reinstated freedoms and set forth fundamental principles. Its executive body was the &quot;Council of Department Heads&quot; led by Yevgeny Rogovsky.

The Committee grew in size as members, mainly Socialist-Revolutionaries, of the former Constituent Assembly travelled to Samara. By the end of September 1918, it numbered 96 members.

On 8 June 1918, after the Revolt of the Czechoslovak Legion, Brushvit convinced the legion to occupy Samara. According to William Henry Chamberlin, &quot;A committee of five members of the dissolved Constituent Assembly, all Socialist Revolutionaries, Brushvit, Fortunatov, Klimushkin, Volsky and Nesterov, thereupon assumed civil and military power in Samara City and Province.&quot;

Having seized power with the help of the Czech Legion, Komuch announced the &quot;reinstatement&quot; of various democratic freedoms. An eight-hour working day was established and plant and factory committees (&quot;fabzavkomy&quot;, from &quot;fab&quot;richno-&quot;zav&quot;odskiye&quot; kom&quot;itety&quot;&quot;) and trade unions were permitted, as were conferences and congresses of workers and peasants. Soviet decrees were abrogated and all industry and financial establishments returned to their former owners, along with the freedom to pursue private enterprise. City dumas, zemstva and other municipal institutions were also reinstated.

Paying lip service to the socialization of land, Komuch provided landowners with an opportunity to recover their confiscated lands from peasants and harvest the winter crops of 1917. Expeditions were sent to the rural areas of Russia to protect landowners, kulaks and their property and, later, to mobilize the People&#x27;s Army of Komuch (the &quot;People&#x27;s Army&quot;).

From June to August 1918, Komuch&#x27;s influence spread from Samara into the provinces of Simbirsk, Kazan, Ufa and Saratov. In September, however, the People&#x27;s Army suffered a number of defeats by the Soviet Red Army and withdrew from much of the territory.

Komuch participated with the Provisional Siberian Government in the State Conference held in Ufa held between 8 and 23 September 1918. Some of the 170 delegates present also represented other smaller regions. While the conference was in progress, &quot;Komuch&quot; suffered two significant defeats, losing control of Kazan on 10 September and of Simbirsk two days later. The conference, meanwhile, established the short-lived Provisional All-Russian Government.

After Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak&#x27;s coup, the provisional government and other institutions were dissolved by General Vladimir Kappel in November 1918.

<text>The Aerial Gunner Badge was a military aeronautical badge of the United States Army Air Forces and was issued during the Second World War. The badge was first created and authorized on April 29, 1943 to recognize both the training and hazardous duty of aerial gunners, who manned defensive machineguns on board such aircraft as the B-17, B-24, B-25, B-26 and B-29 bombers. The Aerial Gunner Badge appeared as a standard observer badge, upon which was centered a winged bullet. It was primarily awarded to USAAF enlisted aircrewmen, but a small number of commissioned officers also qualified and were awarded this insignia, to include film actor Clark Gable. 

The Aerial Gunner Badge was issued until 1953, in the newly created United States Air Force (1947). The Aerial Gunner Badge was declared obsolete and phased out in favor of the Aircrew Badge.

Those having received the Aerial Gunner Badge were permitted to wear the original badge until 1955, at which time the badge was no longer authorized for display on an Air Force uniform.
Prior to the establishment of the Aerial Gunner Badge, these airman could compete in an aerial gunnery competition to earn the Distinguished Aerial Gunner Badge. This lasted from 1926–1932. Beyond this, there was no badge displayed on the uniform to denote one as an aerial gunner.

<text>MySpell is a free spell checker, written to explore how affix compression could be implemented.

It used to be included with the OpenOffice.org office suite and Mozilla client software, and was replaced with the more powerful Hunspell library between 2006 and 2008.

MySpell license is based on the 2-clause BSD license, but has an additional clause requiring to explicitly mark any modified versions.

==Background==
MySpell was started by Kevin Hendricks in an attempt to integrate various open-source spelling checkers into the OpenOffice.org build. With a little prodding from Kevin Atkinson, the author of Pspell and Aspell, a new spelling checker (MySpell) was written in C++ that supported affix compression, based on Ispell.

==Locale (language) files==
Every locale (language for a specific territory) can have files for spelling, hyphenation and a thesaurus. These files will be all found together in one folder. The spell checking is done using the .aff file for the locale together with the .dic file. The .dic file is a list of words along with a group of letters which refer to the affixes found in the .aff file. This saves space because instead of having to include all forms of a word, like jump (jumping, jumps, jumped), the .dic file will include the word once and the references to the affixes in the .aff file allow the construction of all the other forms.

It is not enough to copy the files for a locale into the folder. As there are multiple locales, automatic loading of all dictionaries would cause a considerable overhead. Hence, only those locales listed in dictionary.lst are accessible. Dictionary.lst can be edited with a simple text editor, but front ends provide a more user-friendly way of adding new locales.

==MySpell with other programs==
MySpell also is or has been used by other programs:
*AbiWord
*Aegisub 2.0 can use a dictionary created for MySpell by adding AFF and DIC files to the Dictionary folder.
* NXT, a CAT suite from the Swiss firm , can optionally use MySpell dictionaries for spell-checking.
Aspell and Vim 7 can now use a dictionary created for MySpell.

<doc id="1029639" wikidata="Q2658171" url="?curid=1029639" title="Rallye des Pharaons">
<text>The Rallye des Pharaons (French for &quot;Pharaohs Rally&quot;) was a rally-raid event that took place in Egypt between 1982 and 2015. Cairo was both the starting and finishing point at the foot of the pyramids of Giza, and the rally covered roughly around . It was similar in format to the Dakar Rally in that it took place in desert conditions and cars, trucks, and motorcycles were all permitted to compete.

==History==
The first Pharaohs Rally was held in 1982 from an idea of Jean-Claude Morellet. In 1998 the organization was taken over by JVD, a company managed by Jacky Ickx, Vincenzo Lancia and Daniele Cotto, and the name was changed to Pharaons International Cross Country Rally.

The competition is valid for the FIM Cross-Country Rallies World Championship since 2000 and for the FIA Cross-Country Rally World Cup since 2005.

Tragedy struck on September 29, 2004, when three-time Dakar Rally winner Richard Sainct was killed when his motorcycle ran off the course. KTM, who Sainct rode for, pulled all other factory racers from the rest of the rally in respect for Sainct.

2015 marked the last year that the event was run due to difficulties in receiving support from the FIA and the Egyptian government.
Rally des Pharaons restarted in 1998 after it wasn&#x27;t held for 1 year in 1997 under the name of Rally of Egypt with joint organisation of Siag Travel with JVD and has stayed with this name in 1998-1999-2001-2002, and then JVD changed the name to Rally des Pharaons crosscountry.

<doc id="1029641" wikidata="Q3274767" url="?curid=1029641" title="Ratri">
<text>Ratri (, ; also referred to as Nisha), is a Vedic goddess in Hinduism. She is the personification of the night. The majority of references to Ratri are found in Rigveda and she is described as the sister of Ushas, the personification of dawn. Together with Ushas, she is referred to as a powerful mother and strengthener of vital power. She represents cyclic rhythmic patterns of the cosmos. Her physical appearance isn&#x27;t explicitly mentioned, but she is described as a beautiful maiden. 

One hymn in the Rigveda and five hymns in the Atharvaveda are dedicated to her. In later Tantric texts she occupies an important position. She is associated with Ushas, Indra, Rta, Satya in Rigveda, whereas in Atharvaveda she is associated with Surya. The Brahmanas and the Sutra literature often mention Ratri.

<doc id="1029642" wikidata="Q16200706" url="?curid=1029642" title="Flight officer">
<text>The title flight officer was a military rank used by the United States Army Air Forces during World War II, and also an air force rank in several Commonwealth countries, where it was used for female officers and was equivalent to the rank of flight lieutenant. The term flight officer is sometimes used today to describe job title positions as aircrew members.

== Aircrew function ==

A flight officer is a member of the aircrew of an aircraft who is responsible for specific functions. The flight officer may function as the navigator, responsible for planning the journey, advising the pilot while en route, and ensuring that hazards or obstacles are avoided. The flight officer may also be responsible for operating aircraft mission/weapon systems, including mission planning, mission timing, threat reactions, aircraft communications, and hazard avoidance. In the United States Navy and Marine Corps and formerly United States Coast Guard, officer aircrew members responsible for operating airborne weapon and sensor systems are called naval flight officers. The title of flight officer is also used for police officers who serve as pilots in law enforcement aviation units.

== Military rank ==
=== United States ===
==== United States Army ====

Flight officer was a United States Army Air Forces rank used during World War II, from 1942 to 1945; the rank being created on 10 September 1942. On 5 November 1942 military glider pilots were commissioned as flight officers after the completion of their training. The new rank insignia was nicknamed &quot;the blue pickle.&quot;

The rank is equivalent to Warrant Officer Junior Grade (WOJG) which is today&#x27;s Warrant Officer (NATO grade: W-1). Enlisted and aviation cadet trainees who successfully passed air qualification training were appointed as Flight Officers and served as rated pilots, navigators, flight engineers, bombardiers and glider pilots. At the end of World War II, the Army Air Forces discontinued the use of the rank of flight officer. By then, all of the service&#x27;s flight officers had either been promoted to commissioned officer ranks during the course of the war or discharged.

In the late 1940s, following the creation of the separate United States Air Force in 1947, the United States Army required more pilots. However, congressionally-imposed commissioned officer strength levels prevented pilot expansion. The Army requested authority to establish the flight officer/warrant officer program. This proposal was rejected because the Army already had three groups of personnel – enlisted, warrant officer, and commissioned officer. As a fallback position, the United States Department of the Army decided that the grade of flight officer was in reality a warrant officer grade with a restriction to the warrant officer junior grade rank (WOJG).

The Warrant Officer Flight Program began in 1949 and the first warrant officer Army Aviators graduated from it in 1951. The program was suspended in 1959 but reestablished in 1963, and as of January 2022 it has been in continuous operation ever since. Most of the warrant officers were initially trained to fly helicopters; the Army had begun a helicopter pilot training course for officers in 1948. Flight warrant officer candidates had to be between the ages of 18 and 28 when they began training, though they could begin training at age 17 if they were about to have their 18th birthday.

From 1947 until creation of the United States Army Aviation Branch in 1983, Army commissioned officers rated as &quot;Army Aviators&quot; remained commissioned in their Army &quot;basic branch,&quot; which included &quot;armor,&quot; &quot;Corps of Engineers,&quot; &quot;infantry,&quot; &quot;field artillery,&quot; &quot;Medical Service Corps,&quot; &quot;Military Intelligence Corps,&quot; and &quot;Transportation Corps,&quot; and continued to wear that branch&#x27;s insignia while assigned to aviation units, generally alternating between aviation assignments and &quot;basic branch&quot; assignments in successive tours of duty. Army Aviation warrant officers rated as Army Aviators wore the generic &quot;Army Warrant Officer Branch&quot; insignia (except for certain warrant officers assigned to &quot;air cavalry&quot; units, who like commissioned officers assigned to &quot;cavalry&quot; units, were authorized to wear &quot;cavalry&quot; insignia, while assigned to cavalry units), but were administratively managed by the Army &quot;Warrant Officer Aviation Branch&quot; in the Army Personnel Center, and, as today, continued to serve in successive aviation assignment tours.

Army Aviators, both commissioned and warrant officers, piloted Army aircraft (both rotary-wing and fixed-wing) and performed missions including: artillery spotting, tactical observation, scouting, and reconnaissance, and casualty evacuation roles, as well as battlefield troop lift, cargo transport, armed/attack helicopter, electronic surveillance, and communications/electronic warfare missions. Under the provisions of the Key West Agreement of 1948, the Pace-Finletter MOU 1952, and the Johnson-McConnell agreement of 1966, the Army agreed with the Air Force that the Air Force would (1) provide all fixed-wing close air support for the Army, (2) permit the Army unlimited use of helicopters, (3) limit the Army&#x27;s weight limit on fixed-wing aircraft, (4) provide most Army fixed-wing tactical airlift support, and (5) relinquish claims to most types of tactical helicopters.

==== Civil Air Patrol ====

The rank of flight officer was re-instituted by the United States Air Force&#x27;s civilian auxiliary, the Civil Air Patrol (CAP), in the mid-1980s, replacing the former ranks of warrant officer and chief warrant officer, new entrants for which had been eliminated by the Air Force in 1959 and discontinued with the retirement of the last Air Force chief warrant officer in the United States Air Force Reserve in 1992. CAP officers between the ages of 18 and 20 are eligible for promotion to the ranks of flight officer, technical flight officer and senior flight officer. Requirements for promotion to each grade generally are the same as for promotion to CAP second lieutenant, first lieutenant, and captain, respectively, and those flight officers who choose to enter the commissioned ranks are promoted to these respective ranks when they reach the age of 21.

=== Commonwealth countries ===

Flight officer was established as a rank equivalent to flight lieutenant in the women&#x27;s air services of several Commonwealth countries. The rank was used by the United Kingdom′s Women&#x27;s Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF) and its successor, the Women&#x27;s Royal Air Force (WRAF), until 1968, and by Princess Mary&#x27;s Royal Air Force Nursing Service (PMRAFNS) until 1980. It was also used in the Women&#x27;s Royal Australian Air Force before it was absorbed into the Royal Australian Air Force in 1977.

<text>Clandon Park House is an early 18th-century grade I listed Palladian mansion in West Clandon, near Guildford in Surrey.

It stands in the south east corner of Clandon Park, a agricultural parkland estate which has been the seat of the Earls of Onslow for over two centuries. The house and gardens were given to the National Trust in 1956, but the park remains in private ownership. Some of the house&#x27;s contents have also been acquired by the Trust in lieu of estate duty.

Construction of the house, designed by Italian architect Giacomo Leoni, began about 1730, and the interiors were finished by continental sculptors and plasterers in the 1740s. It replaced an Elizabethan house. The park was landscaped by Lancelot &#x27;Capability&#x27; Brown in 1781, and there are two formal gardens on either side of the house. On the Epsom Road, leading to the park and house, are the Grade II* 18th century wrought iron gates with armorial overthrow, which Brown installed, and the gatehouses (1776), designed by Brown himself.

Near the house is a Māori meeting house, one of only four outside New Zealand, that was brought to England in the late 19th century. After being transferred to the National Trust, the house underwent restoration before it was opened to the public, and later became a wedding venue and filming location for period dramas.

Clandon Park House was badly damaged by fire in April 2015, probably caused by an electrical fault in the basement, leaving it &quot;essentially a shell&quot;, with only one room, the Speaker&#x27;s Parlour, intact. Thousands of historic artefacts, paintings, and items of furniture were lost in what has been described as a national tragedy. In January 2016, the National Trust announced that some of the principal rooms on the ground floor would be fully restored to the original 18th-century designs, and upper floors will be used for exhibitions and events. However, the Trust has since announced in 2022 its intention to restore only the Speaker&#x27;s Parlour, the external walls, the roof and the windows and conserve the rest of the house in its ruined state while making it accessible to the public.

==History==
The estate and Elizabethan house, together with Temple Court Farm at Merrow, was purchased in 1641 from Sir Richard Weston of nearby Sutton Place, by Sir Richard Onslow, MP for Surrey in the Long Parliament and great-grandfather of Thomas Onslow, 2nd Baron Onslow, who rebuilt it. Many members of the Onslow family followed political careers; three of them, including Arthur Onslow, were Speakers of the House of Commons. Their portraits would later hang in the Speaker&#x27;s Parlour at Clandon House.
The house was built, or perhaps thoroughly rebuilt, in about 1730–33 (the latter date is on rainwater heads) by Thomas Onslow, 2nd Baron Onslow to the design of the Venetian architect Giacomo Leoni. It is a rectangular building of red brick and stone dressings. Clandon House interiors, completed in the 1740s, featured a two-storey Marble Hall, containing marble chimney pieces by the Flemish sculptor Michael Rysbrack, and a rococo plasterwork ceiling by Italian-Swiss artists Giuseppe Artari and Bagutti.

Clandon Park was landscaped by Lancelot &#x27;Capability&#x27; Brown in 1776–81, replacing a French garden and transforming part of a disused canal into an ornamental lake. A porte-cochère was added to the principal façade in 1876. A sunken Dutch garden was created by Frances, Countess of Onslow at the north front of the house in the late 19th century. In 1895, the house was investigated for paranormal activity by John Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute and Ada Goodrich Freer on behalf of the Society for Psychical Research. During World War I, the Onslow family created and managed a hospital in Clandon House for the war injured.

===Slavery===
The house has been described as having been built in part with the profits from slavery. Elizabeth Knight inherited her wealth from Charles Knight, her uncle. Charles was a slave trader and plantation owner. Elizabeth inherited a plantation called Whitehall in St Thomas-in-the-East, Jamaica, and the enslaved workers who worked there, producing sugar and rum. Elizabeth&#x27;s husband Thomas Onslow was the founder of a ship insurance company that dealt with slave ships. The slave plantation was passed down the generations of the Onslow family. At any one time between 87 and 150 enslaved people were captive on the plantation.

===Acquisition by the National Trust===
In 1945, ownership of Clandon House was passed in trust to William Onslow, 6th Earl of Onslow on the death of his father, who had offered Clandon House to be used by the Public Record Office to protect government documents from destruction by bombs in the war. The family moved out to facilitate this. In 1956, the Earl decided that he wished to donate Clandon House to the nation. The house could not be donated directly by the Onslows, so the Earl arranged for his aunt, Gwendolen, Countess Iveagh, the daughter of William Hillier, 4th Earl of Onslow and a former MP herself, to purchase Clandon House from the Onslows for £1. The National Trust would only accept the house if it also received a substantial monetary endowment. This was arranged, and Clandon House with seven acres of land – including Hinemihi – were donated to the National Trust.

Historian James Lees-Milne described the house in 1942 as &quot;dirty and in decay&quot;, and Merlin Waterson, former director of historic properties at the National Trust, said it was &quot;much depleted when it came to the Trust&quot;. Its state rooms were almost empty, but as well as many paintings and items of furniture belonging to the Onslow family, the house also contained some 18th-century porcelain, textiles and furniture donated by Hannah Gubbay, a member of the Sassoon family.

===1968 – 2014===
It was extensively restored and redecorated between 1968 and 1970 by the interior designer John Fowler, who set out to &quot;capture the spirit of the rooms and its period rather than to replicate exact historical detail&quot;. Other pieces were acquired from the National Trust&#x27;s extensive collections, and notable antiques that had a long-standing association with the property were also bought for display in the house. Many historians have criticised Fowler&#x27;s design choices at Clandon House. Merlin Waterson admits &quot;he was not given clear enough guidance on what was historically appropriate&quot;. However, Neil Cossons, a historian and museum director, has noted &quot;[Fowler] was ever anxious to avoid the &quot;dead hand of the restorer&quot;. In these interiors nothing jarred and they were completely in keeping with the romantic taste of the period&quot;. In 1978, a parterre designed by John Fowler and Paul Miles was laid out on the south front, replacing early 20th-century flower beds.

By the 2000s, the house contained, among other things, the Ivo Forde Meissen collection of Italian comedy figures, Mortlake tapestries, and other rich textiles and carpets. Due to its extensive costs of upkeep, the National Trust gained a marriage licence for the property, and it had become a popular local wedding venue. It was also in part or whole rented out occasionally to the media for various productions, including 2008&#x27;s &quot;The Duchess&quot; starring Keira Knightley.

In their 2012 At Risk Register, English Heritage described the park still owned by the Earl of Onslow as highly vulnerable, with extensive significant problems, and &quot;unsympathetically managed thus affecting the overall integrity of the design and the setting of the house&quot;. Discussions about the development of a proposed business park were ongoing.

===2015 fire===

On the afternoon of 29 April 2015, a fire started in the house&#x27;s basement and quickly spread to the roof. At 16:09, Surrey Fire and Rescue Service received an emergency call, and the fire was subsequently attended by a total of 16 fire engines and more than 80 personnel. While fire fighters tackled the blaze, National Trust volunteers were joined by conservators in salvaging furniture and works of art. Items were first stored on the lawns then placed in bubble wrap and sent to a local storage unit. After the fire around 600 &quot;significant items&quot; were rescued. The fire and rescue service remained at the property for a further ten days until the fire had been fully extinguished and then began an investigation into the cause of the fire.

A significant number of items were salvaged, but the house was left &quot;essentially a shell&quot; according to Dame Helen Ghosh, director general of the National Trust, with the roof, ceilings and floors having fallen into the basement, leaving just one room intact. One of the footballs kicked across no-man&#x27;s land on the first day of the Battle of the Somme in 1916 was among the thousands of historic items destroyed, but the six Victoria Crosses thought to have been destroyed were replicas – the originals were held in a bank vault. Although some paintings and furniture were rescued by staff, many tapestries and some items of porcelain were heavily damaged. A large portrait of Richard Onslow, 1st Baron Onslow who was Speaker of the House of Commons in the early 18th century, was saved after being cut from its frame. Among the items workers prioritised to rescue were the regimental colours. An official investigation concluded that the fire was probably caused by a fault on an electrical distribution board in the basement.

==Restoration project==

In January 2016, the National Trust announced that a number of the principal rooms were going to be restored to the original 18th-century designs, and the &quot;less architecturally significant&quot; upper floors were to be fully modernised for holding exhibitions, events and performances. The cost of the restoration work is being funded by an insurance payout estimated at £65 million. A spokesman for the trust said it would also be asking supporters for donations to cover any shortfall in the budget.

Rupert Onslow, 8th Earl of Onslow who owns and manages Clandon Park, whose family were the last private owners of Clandon House, criticised the decision to build &quot;a replica&quot; of the house, saying the money might be better spent on adding properties in need of genuine conservation to the National Trust&#x27;s collection as opposed to creating a replica of Clandon House. The Earl said, &quot;Clandon is lost. It&#x27;s a ruin now. It decayed instantly. If the National Trust wants a replica, let them build it somewhere else.&quot; He also said that the last thing he wanted was a &quot;Vulgar mock-Georgian footballers&#x27; wives house.&quot; However, the trust said the insurance policy did not allow it to spend the money elsewhere, and it could only be spent at Clandon. The Georgian Group welcomed the decision, calling the fire a national tragedy, and lending support for the restoration project, but reversed its position in September 2017 when the shortlist of design teams being considered for the restoration, and their initial proposals, were revealed.

In December 2017, architects Allies and Morrison were unanimously chosen as the winner of an international design competition to restore Clandon Park House.

In 2022, the Trust announced its intention to drop the previously announced restoration project, on account of few original features surviving, in favour of only restoring the Speaker&#x27;s Parlour (the only room to survive the fire intact), the external walls and the windows and conserve the rest of the house in its ruined state and make it accessible to the public with new walkways to provide a unique insight into the construction of an 18th century stately home. The Trust also plans to add a new rooftop terrace, with the possibility of a new refreshment stand, to offer views of the surrounding countryside. 

==Maori meeting house==

A Māori meeting house or wharenui named &quot;Hinemihi&quot; stands in the gardens. It was originally situated near Lake Tarawera in New Zealand and provided shelter to the people of Te Wairoa village during the eruption of Mount Tarawera in 1886. The building was covered in ash and surrounded by volcanic debris, but its occupants survived. It remained half buried until 1892 when William Onslow, 4th Earl of Onslow, then Governor General of New Zealand, bought it and had it fully restored and shipped to England. There are only three other Māori meeting houses outside New Zealand.

The National Trust has refurbished the Maori meeting house, replacing the roof, cleaning and repainting carvings, and replacing carvings that were lost. The roof is thatched, based on a misinterpretation of a photograph of the house covered in ash. Its original roof was of shingles. The New Zealand Historic Places Trust and the British Museum were consulted over this work. The meeting house is still important for cultural activities among the Māori. The nature of Hinemihi and its meaning for the local and expatriate Maori community in London was explored by Cecilie Gravesen in her experimental film &quot;Between Humans and Other Things&quot; (2010). During the 2012 Summer Olympics, the New Zealand team visited Hinemihi.

==Surrey Infantry Museum==

Colonel JW Sewell reached agreement with the National Trust to re-establish the Queen&#x27;s Royal Surrey Regiment Museum at Clandon House. The museum opened in 1981 with exhibits including uniforms, medals, weapons, regalia, photographs and memorabilia. The regiment&#x27;s archives and library are located at the Surrey History Centre in Woking. After being upgraded in 2001, in July 2011 with part funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund the museum merged with those of the Princess of Wales&#x27;s Royal Regiment and the Queen&#x27;s Royal Surrey Regiment to become the Surrey Infantry Museum. The museum&#x27;s displayed medal collection included six Victoria Crosses, including those awarded to: Lieutenant Wallace Duffield Wright; Lance Corporal Leonard James Keyworth; Corporal John McNamara; Second Lieutenant Arthur James Terence Fleming-Sandes. The museum, housed in the basement, was totally destroyed in the fire.

<text>Christopher Bellard (born June 17, 1979), known professionally as Young Maylay, is an American rapper, record producer and actor based in Los Angeles. He is best known for his portrayal of Carl &quot;CJ&quot; Johnson, the main character of the 2004 video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot;.

== Early life ==
Christopher Bellard was born and raised in Los Angeles, California. Growing up in poverty, in a crime-ridden neighborhood, amid gang violence and gangsta rap inspired his rapping career.
He grew up with close affiliates of the Crips gang. Bellard is the younger cousin of actor and rapper Shawn Fonteno, who played Franklin Clinton, one of the protagonists of &quot;Grand Theft Auto V&quot;.

== Music career ==

===Early years: 2000–2005===
His rapping career eventually took off in 2000, at the age of 21. With help from King T, Maylay made his first appearance in Killa Tay&#x27;s Thug Thisle, with the song &quot;#1 Hottest Coast (Killa Cali)&quot; in 2000. Later he appeared in Rodney O &amp; Joe Cooley&#x27;s Summer Heat in 2002. Since then, he has been featured on many releases across the West Coast. Maylay wrote the majority of King T&#x27;s album &quot;Ruthless Chronicles&quot;. He founded his independent label in 2005 with the money from GTA San Andreas and released his debut mixtape in the same year.

===Pre-Lench Mob: 2006–2008===
In 2006, Maylay was featured in Deeyah&#x27;s single &quot;What Will It Be&quot; with a music video. In the same year, he appeared in DJ Crazy Toones&#x27; CT Experience, it was the first collaboration of the trio &quot;DJ Crazy Toones, WC and Young Maylay&quot;. In 2007 the trio began working in Maylay&#x27;s album &quot;The Real Coast Guard&quot;. The album was released in 2008 and later that year, WC signed Young Maylay to Bigg Swang/Lench Mob.

===Lench Mob days: 2008–present===
Lench Mob Records were set in 2006 to put out Ice Cube&#x27;s and WC&#x27;s records, but later other artists were signed, like Young Maylay, who is considered a veteran by Ice Cube. DJ Crazy Toones created two blogs for Maylay, the first is called &quot;Who&#x27;s Young Maylay? Mix Blog&quot; and the second is called &quot;Young Maylay, WC &amp; Bad Lucc Mix Blog&quot;.

Young Maylay is working on three albums, by himself, WC and Crazy Toones. Young Maylay is featured on two tracks by Ice Cube called &quot;Y&#x27;all Know Who I Am&quot; and &quot;Too West Coast&quot; on the album &quot;I Am the West&quot;.

In 2010 Young Maylay was featured on two tracks on the album &quot;DJ Premier Presents Year Round Records - Get Used To Us&quot;. The track &quot;Temptation&quot; is a solo performance, while the track &quot;Ain&#x27;t Nuttin&#x27; Changed (remix)&quot; is a collaborative effort with Blaq Poet and MC Eiht.

In an interview, when asked about a new album, Maylay said:

=== OBG Rider Clicc ===
OBG Rider Clicc is Young Maylay&#x27;s rap trio (with &quot;Young Dre The Truth&quot; and &quot;Killa Polk&quot;) the group first appeared in &quot;Young Dre&#x27;s&quot; album called &quot;Revolution In Progress The Movement&quot; with the single Let&#x27;s Get The Game Bacc Right. and later appeared with &quot;Compton Cavie&quot;, Dresta and BG Knocc Out with the song &quot;Wes Indeed&quot; in the Cali Luv mixtape.

== &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot; ==
Maylay was working in New York when he received a phone call from DJ Pooh, who was in a meeting with staff from Rockstar Games. They started a regular conversation about music which, unknown to Maylay, occurred on speakerphone. Rockstar staff heard the conversation, and after the conversation between the two ended, they encouraged Pooh to bring Maylay in to audition. A few weeks after the audition, Rockstar reviewed the tapes and decided on Maylay for the role of the main character of &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot;, Carl &quot;CJ&quot; Johnson. When asked in 2021 if he would consider reprising the role of CJ in any future &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; titles if given the opportunity, Maylay stated that he would never voice CJ again due to conflicts with Rockstar Games.

== Maylaynium Muziq ==
Malaynium Muziq is Young Maylay&#x27;s own independent record label based in Studio City, California. His mixtapes were released on this label.

<doc id="1029651" wikidata="Q2083824" url="?curid=1029651" title="Mare Nostrum (board game)">
<text>Mare Nostrum is a board game for 3 to 5 players, designed by Serge Laget and published in 2003 by Eurogames. It was also the name of a 1983 board game in the Fronte Mare series.

== Gameplay ==

Players assume the roles of one of five Mediterranean empires - Rome, Greece, Babylon, Egypt or Carthage.
Units are placed on a game board representing the Mediterranean and the surrounding area, divided into provinces which contain one or more resources.

Players take turns in rounds of three phases:

;Commerce Phase
:Players receive cards for each resource they control. Once the players have taken their resources, the player who controls most caravans and markets (the &quot;Director of Commerce&quot;) chooses how many cards will be traded, and each player puts down that many resource cards from their hand. The Director of Commerce then chooses a card from an opponent&#x27;s face-up cards and adds it to their hand. That player picks an opponent&#x27;s card, and so on until all cards have been taken.
;Political Phase
:The player who controls the most cities and temples (the &quot;Political Leader&quot;) chooses the order in which players may make purchases. Players may buy buildings which improve resource production, military units (see Military Phase, below), or buy &quot;Heroes&quot; or &quot;Wonders&quot; which confer special advantages and count towards winning the game.
;Military Phase
:The player with the most military units on the board (the &quot;Military Leader&quot;) chooses the order in which players may make military moves. Players may move units around the board in order to control provinces or to attack other players&#x27; units. Travel by sea is accomplished using ships as bridges. Combat is resolved by rolling one six-sided dice per unit attacking, adding them together, and then dividing by five (rounding down). That many of the opponent&#x27;s units are destroyed.

The first player to do any of the following wins the game:
* hold four Hero and/or Wonder cards
* build the Pyramids

== Game interest ==
&quot;Mare Nostrum&quot; is intended by the designer to be a more playable version of Civilization. The goal of the game is to bring glory to your civilization by acquiring great heroes and by building architectural wonders in your kingdom. Prominently featured in the game are historic personalities such as Julius Caesar, Cleopatra, Hammurabi, as well as the Seven Wonders of the World.

The game incorporates many features found in other games, for example:
* Resource production, management and trading (&quot;The Settlers of Catan&quot;)
* Military strategy (Risk)
* Diplomacy and sea travel bridging (Diplomacy)
* Player asymmetry (Citadels)

The game itself supports three to five players, but it is best played with all five.

The game has been criticised as being too inflexible in the player&#x27;s roles; for example, Rome must play aggressively while Egypt must trade. Further, players are forced (to a certain extent) into certain actions early in the game; if Egypt is allowed to acquire too many resource cards they will quickly build the Pyramids; if Rome is not then held in check they will achieve military victory. However, once the game has been played a few times these strategies become less effective and the game opens out again.

== Expansions ==
&quot;Mare Nostrum: Mythology Expansion&quot; adds mythological and religious elements to the game. These include:

* A sixth civilization (the legendary Atlantis), including an add on map board and pieces for a sixth player
* Gods such as Isis and Baal who grant powerful favors
* A role and phase in which offerings can be made to the gods
* Mythological creatures such as the griffin, the centaur, and the phoenix
* A variety of mythological heroes such as Ulysses, Medusa, and Hercules
* A thirteenth resource (Pottery)
* A thoroughly revised

<text>Harold Hall &quot;Doc&quot; Keen (1894–1973) was a British engineer who produced the engineering design, and oversaw the construction of, the British bombe, a codebreaking machine used in World War II to read German messages sent using the Enigma machine. He was known as &quot;Doc&quot; Keen because of his habit of carrying tools and paperwork in a case resembling a doctor&#x27;s bag. After the war he was awarded the O.B.E.

== Career before World War II ==
Keen was born in the borough of Shoreditch in east London in 1894. By age 18 he had moved to Kentish Town and began studying Electrical Engineering. In 1912 he joined the British Tabulating Machine Company (BTM), established to import and assemble American punched card technology. In 1916, Keen joined the Royal Flying Corps and was assigned to the ground staff of a bomber squadron in northern France. In 1919 he returned to BTM and married an Eva Burningham. In 1921, Keen moved with BTM to Letchworth in Hertfordshire. Two years later, he was appointed head of the Experimental Department, and his innovations there gained him the reputation as the leading British innovator of punched-card technology; Keen was granted more than sixty patents. In the 1930s he became Chief Engineer.

==World War II – British bombes==


A machine called the &quot;cryptologic bomb&quot; (Polish: &quot;bomba kryptologiczna&quot;) had been produced by the Polish codebreakers in their successful breaking of Enigma before 1939. It was, however, useful only as long as the Germans continued with particular weaknesses in operating procedure, which they gradually tightened up, so that the Polish success rate diminished dramatically. Alan Turing designed the British bombe on a more general principle, the assumption of the presence of text, called a &quot;crib&quot;, that cryptanalysts could predict was likely to be present at a defined point in the message. This technique is termed a &quot;known plaintext attack&quot; and had been used to a limited extent by the Poles, e.g., the Germans&#x27; use of &quot;ANX&quot; — German for &quot;To,&quot; followed by &quot;X&quot; as a spacer.

As chief engineer at the British Tabulating Machine Company at Letchworth Keen was approached to turn these ideas into a working reality. The first bombe, which was based on Turing&#x27;s original design, was installed in Hut 1 at Bletchley Park on 18 March 1940 and was named &quot;Victory&quot;. The second bombe, named &quot;Agnus dei&quot;, later shortened to &quot;Agnes&quot;, or &quot;Aggie&quot;, was equipped with an important additional feature, the &quot;diagonal board&quot; that had been designed by Gordon Welchman. It was installed on 8 August 1940; &quot;Victory&quot; was later returned to Letchworth to have a diagonal board fitted.

During 1940, 178 messages were broken on the two machines, nearly all successfully. Because of the danger of bombes at Bletchley Park being lost if there were to be a bombing raid, five bombe outstations were established, at Adstock, Gayhurst, Wavendon, Stanmore, and Eastcote. The bombe was referred to by Group Captain Winterbotham as a &quot;Bronze Goddess&quot; because of its colour. The devices were more prosaically described by operators as being &quot;like great big metal bookcases&quot;.

<text>Châtellerault (; Poitevin-Saintongeais: &quot;Châteulrô/Chateleràud&quot;; ) is a commune in the Vienne department in the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region in France. It is located in the northeast of the former province Poitou, and the residents are called &quot;Châtelleraudais&quot;.

==Geography==
Châtellerault lies on the river Vienne, a few km downstream from its confluence with the Clain in Cenon-sur-Vienne.

==History==
Châtellerault was an important stronghold on the northern march of Poitou, established by the Count of Poitiers to secure his borders in the early 10th century. The count&#x27;s local representative, the Vicomte de Châtellerault was established as a hereditary appointment by the time of Airaud who was probably a kinsman of the counts of Auvergne and dukes of Aquitaine; his heirs were &quot;vicomtes&quot; (viscounts) until the mid-11th century.

The daughter of Aymeric I, Ænor of Châtellerault (c. 1103 – c. 1130), whose mother had been the &quot;mistress&quot; in the new courtly love poetry of the troubadour lord William, sixth Count of Poitiers and ninth Duke of Aquitaine, who lodged in his tower the &quot;Dangereuse de Châtellerault&quot;, married his son, William X of Aquitaine, and was mother of Eleanor of Aquitaine.

The title, &quot;Vicomte de Châtellerault,&quot; passed in turn to each of three great French noble families: La Rochefoucauld, Lusignan and, from the thirteenth century until the French Revolution, to the family of Harcourt.

However, in return for services offered to the Crowns of Scotland and France, the title of Duc de Châtellerault (1548) was presented to James Hamilton, 2nd Earl of Arran, Chief of the Name, and regent of Scotland during the infancy of Mary, Queen of Scots, and of France. This title, though now without any benefices, remains in contention between the heir male and the heir general of Arran, respectively the Duke of Abercorn and the Duke of Hamilton. (See Chatelherault Country Park, Lanarkshire.)

==Economy==
From medieval times, Châtellerault was known for its cutlery and swordmaking industry, and in 1816 the commune became a center for arms manufacture for the French government. The Manufacture d&#x27;armes de Châtellerault was one of France&#x27;s four principal state-owned arms manufacturers, providing most of the infantry small arms used by the French Army and Navy. &quot;MAC&quot; was created in 1819, and operated continually until it was closed as a weapon manufacturing facility in 1968. It saw the creation in 1886, and later the mass production, of the Lebel rifle which was the main French infantry weapon used during the First World War (1914–1918). It also was the source of the first 500,000 production Model 1891 Mosin–Nagant rifles, as the Russian armament industry could not tool up quickly enough to produce them for the rearmament of the Imperial Russian Army.

The facility has now been transformed into the central repository (Centre des Archives de l&#x27;Armement et du Personnel) of all the French military archives related to armament matters. Archived and declassified MAC records are open to bona fide scholars and researchers upon written request.

<doc id="1029682" wikidata="Q730869" url="?curid=1029682" title="Hideo Higashikokubaru">
<text>is a Japanese politician. He originally rose to fame as a comedian and actor under the stage name , and was known for his role in the popular game show &quot;Takeshi&#x27;s Castle&quot;.

He served as the governor of Miyazaki Prefecture from 2007 to 2011, resigning to run against incumbent Shintarō Ishihara for Governor of Tokyo in the 2011 election, where he came in second. He was elected to the House of Representatives in the general election of 2012, but resigned in December 2013.

== Early life ==
Higashikokubaru was born in Miyakonojō, a city in Miyazaki Prefecture and attended Senshu University from 1976 to 1980, where he majored in economics. After graduating from Senshu, Higashikokubaru apprenticed to Takeshi Kitano and became a comedian in 1982.

He appeared on &quot;Takeshi&#x27;s Castle&quot;, which was dubbed on United States television as &quot;Most Extreme Elimination Challenge&quot; (&quot;MXC&quot;); Higashikokubaru was dubbed as &quot;Kenny Blankenship&quot; in the American version.

== Incidents ==
On December 9, 1986, Higashi was one of those who were arrested at the offices of &quot;Friday&quot; magazine, after he and other members of Takeshi Kitano&#x27;s group attacked the magazine offices (among others spraying fire extinguishers) to protest a critical article about Takeshi Kitano that the magazine had published. All attackers were sentenced to six months in prison, suspended for two years.

On October 13, 1998, a manager of a so-called image club (a type of brothel) was arrested for employing underage girls. A 16-year-old employee pointed Higashi out as one of her customers. He was interrogated several times by the police, but was not indicted as he claimed he did not know the girl was under 18. His then-wife apologized on his behalf to the Japanese public via the media, and he himself took a five-month voluntary break from his work as an entertainer.

On November 22, 1999, at a year-end-party held for Takeshi Kitano office employees, he kicked another participant in the head, injuring him. He was prosecuted for this, and fined, after which he again took a voluntary leave from his entertainment activity.

Higashikokubaru shifted his interest to politics around 1999 after being involved in these publicized incidents. He enrolled in the School of Letters, Arts and Sciences II at Waseda University in 2000, and graduated in March 2004, re-entering as a politics and economics student in April 2004. He divorced from his wife in February 2006 and dropped out of Waseda in March 2006.

==Governor of Miyazaki==
On January 21, 2007, Higashi was elected governor of Miyazaki Prefecture, replacing former governor Tadahiro Ando, who resigned after being arrested for bid rigging. He used his official name (Hideo Higashikokubaru) as governor of Miyazaki.

He declared a state of emergency in Miyazaki during a major outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in May 2010.

He decided not to run for re-election in 2010, and left office on January 20, 2011.

==Later activity==
Higashikokubaru ran in the Tokyo gubernatorial election on April 10, 2011, in which he lost to incumbent governor Shintarō Ishihara.

Both Higashikokubaru and Ishihara ran as proportional representation candidates for the Japan Restoration Party in the December 2012 general election for the House of Representatives.

Higashikokubaru resigned from the JRP in December 2013 stating that &quot;the political ideology and policies of the Japan Restoration Party as well as their directions have changed and they are now far different from mine.&quot;

Following the resignation of Tokyo governor Naoki Inose on December 19, Higashikokubaru was widely rumored to be a potential candidate for the gubernatorial election in February 2014. He denied that he had resigned in order to run for the governorship, saying &quot;the timing is a little too good. People would suspect I&#x27;m up to something. I&#x27;m not. For me, [Inose&#x27;s resignation] is just troublesome.&quot; On January 10 he stated that he had &quot;2,000%&quot; &quot;no scheme, plan, or intention&quot; to run.

== Personal ==
Higashikokubaru is an active runner and has completed several marathons. He ran the Lake Saroma ultra-marathon in 13 hours in June 1995, and has also run the Gold Coast Marathon and Okinawa Marathon three times each. He also played handball in high school and competed in the National Sports Festival of Japan in 1975.

<text>Saint Peter&#x27;s tomb is a site under St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica that includes several graves and a structure said by Vatican authorities to have been built to memorialize the location of Saint Peter&#x27;s grave. St. Peter&#x27;s tomb is alleged near the west end of a complex of mausoleums, the Vatican Necropolis, that date between about AD 130 and AD 300. The complex was partially torn down and filled with earth to provide a foundation for the building of the first St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica during the reign of Constantine I in about AD 330. Though many bones have been found at the site of the 2nd-century shrine, as the result of two campaigns of archaeological excavation, Pope Pius XII stated in December 1950 that none could be confirmed to be Saint Peter&#x27;s with absolute certainty. Following the discovery of bones that had been transferred from a second tomb under the monument, on June 26, 1968, Pope Paul VI said that the relics of Saint Peter had been identified in a manner considered convincing. Circumstantial evidence was provided to support the claim.

The grave allegedly lies at the foot of the aedicula beneath the floor. The remains of four individuals and several farm animals were found in this grave. In 1953, after the initial archeological efforts had been completed, another set of bones were found that were said to have been removed without the archeologists&#x27; knowledge from a niche (&quot;loculus&quot;) in the north side of a graffiti wall that abuts the red wall on the right of the aedicula. Subsequent testing indicated that these were the bones of a 60- to 70-year-old man. Margherita Guarducci argued that these were the remains of Saint Peter and that they had been moved into a niche in the graffiti wall from the grave under the aedicula &quot;at the time of Constantine, after the peace of the church&quot; (313). Antonio Ferrua, the archaeologist who headed the excavation that uncovered what the Catholic Church says is Saint Peter&#x27;s Tomb, said that he was not convinced that the bones that were found were those of Saint Peter.

==Death of Peter at Vatican Hill==

The earliest reference to Saint Peter&#x27;s death is in a letter of Clement, bishop of Rome, to the Corinthians (&quot;1 Clement&quot;, a.k.a. &quot;Letter to the Corinthians&quot;, written AD). The historian Eusebius, a contemporary of Constantine, wrote that Peter &quot;came to Rome, and was crucified with his head downwards,&quot; attributing this information to the much earlier theologian Origen, who died AD. St. Peter&#x27;s martyrdom is traditionally depicted in religious iconography as crucifixion with his head pointed downward.

Eusebius, in his book &quot;Church History&quot;, explains that the burial sites of Saints Peter and Paul were still known in his time. Eusebius supports this account with information from Caius, an early 3rd century Christian writer who lived during the time of Pope Zephyrinus. In a debate with Proclus, a leader of the Phrygian heresy, Caius claims he can show the burial places of Peter and Paul at the Vatican and the Ostian Way.

Peter&#x27;s place and manner of death are also mentioned by Tertullian () in &quot;Scorpiace&quot;, where the death is said to take place during the Christian persecutions by Nero. Tacitus (56–117) describes the persecution of Christians in his Annals, though he does not specifically mention Peter. &quot;They were torn by dogs and perished, or were nailed to crosses, or were doomed to the flames and burnt.&quot; Furthermore, Tertullian says these events took place in the imperial gardens near the Circus of Nero. The Great Fire of Rome destroyed the Circus Maximus and most of the rest of the city in the year 64 AD.

==Tracing the original tombs==
Dionysius of Corinth mentions the burial place of Peter as Rome when he wrote to the Church of Rome in the time of the Pope Soter (died 174), thanking the Romans for their financial help. &quot;You have thus by such an admonition bound together the planting of Peter and of Paul at Rome and Corinth. For both of them planted and likewise taught us in our Corinth. And they taught together in like manner in Italy, and suffered martyrdom at the same time.&quot;
Catholic tradition holds that the bereaved Christians followed their usual custom in burying him as near as possible to the scene of his suffering. According to Catholic lore, he was laid in ground that belonged to Christian proprietors, by the side of a well-known road leading out of the city, the Via Cornelia (site of a known pagan and Christian cemetery) on the hill called Vaticanus. The actual tomb was an underground vault, approached from the road by a descending staircase, and the body reposed in a sarcophagus of stone in the center of this vault.

&quot;The Book of Popes&quot; mentions that Pope Anacletus built a &quot;sepulchral monument&quot; over the underground tomb of Saint Peter shortly after his death. This was a small chamber or oratory over the tomb, where three or four persons could kneel and pray over the grave. The pagan Roman Emperor, Julian the Apostate, mentions in 363 A.D. in his work &quot;Three Books Against the Galileans&quot; that the tomb of Saint Peter was a place of worship, albeit secretly.

There is evidence of the existence of the tomb (trophoea, i.e., &quot;trophies&quot;, as signs or memorials of victory) at the beginning of the 3rd century, in the words of the priest Caius refuting the Montanist traditions of a certain Proclus: &quot;But I can show the trophies of the Apostles. For if you will go to the Vatican, or to the Ostian way, you will find the trophies of those who laid the foundations of this church.&quot;
These tombs were the objects of pilgrimage during the ages of persecution, and it will be found recorded in certain &quot;Acts of the Martyrs&quot; that they were seized while praying at the tombs of the Apostles.

During the reign of the Roman Emperor Valerian, Christian persecution was particularly severe. The remains of the dead, and particularly the Christian dead, had lost their usual protections under Roman law. Some have conjectured that the remains of Peter and Paul may have been removed temporarily from their original tombs in order to preserve them from desecration by the Romans. They may have been removed secretly by night and hidden in the Catacombs of St Sebastian in 258 AD, being returned to their original tombs in 260 when Valerian&#x27;s reign ended. However, no evidence exists to verify these claims.

==Constantine&#x27;s basilica==
When the Church was once more at peace under Constantine the Great, Christians were able at last to build edifices suitable for the celebration of Mass. The resting places of the relics of the Apostles were naturally among the first to be selected as the sites of great basilicas. The emperor supplied funds for these buildings.

Between 320 and 327, Constantine built a five-aisled basilica atop the early Christian necropolis that was purported to be Peter&#x27;s resting place. Much of the Vatican Hill was leveled to provide a firm foundation for the first St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica. The altar of the Basilica was planned to be located directly over the tomb. The matter was complicated by the upper chamber or memoria above the vault. This upper chamber had become endeared to the Romans during the ages of persecution, and they were unwilling that it should be destroyed. The memoria was turned into the Chapel of the Confession. Above that was the main floor of the Basilica, with the raised altar directly over the Chapel of the Confession.

The &quot;Book of Popes&quot; details certain adornments that Constantine apparently added to Saint Peter&#x27;s tomb at this time. The sarcophagus itself is said to have been enclosed on all sides with bronze, measuring in each dimension. On top of that was laid a gold cross weighing and featuring an inscription, which translates from Latin as &quot;Constantine Augustus and Helena Augusta This House Shining with Like Royal Splendor a Court Surrounds.&quot; However, any treasures that may have been present at the tomb are presumed to have been taken by the Saracens during their Sack of the church in 846.

The skull of Saint Peter is claimed to reside in the Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran since at least the ninth century, alongside the skull of Saint Paul.

==Modern excavation==
A tomb had been discovered at the beginning of the 16th century, when the foundations were being laid for the four twisted columns of Gian Lorenzo Bernini&#x27;s &quot;Confessio&quot;. Construction of Constantine&#x27;s Old St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica and of foundations for Bernini&#x27;s &quot;Baldacchino&quot; destroyed most of the vaulting of these semi-subterranean burial chambers. Among them was the so-called &quot;Tomb of the Julii&quot; with mosaics that appeared to be Christian.

The burial chambers were uncovered again in 1939 as workmen dug a tomb for Pope Pius XI. Over the next ten years, Ludwig Kaas oversaw an archaeological excavation of the pagan mausoleum complex under the foundations of St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica (the Vatican Necropolis), dating to the 2nd and 3rd centuries. No mausoleum had ever been built directly beneath the present high altar of St Peter&#x27;s, which did however contain shallow burials, one dated by an impressed tile to the reign of Vespasian; subsequently they had been attended with care, as later burials clustered round but did not encroach upon the space. There was a small niched monument built into a wall &quot;ca.&quot; 160. The discoveries made the pages of &quot;Life&quot; magazine.

===Saint Peter&#x27;s relics allegedly discovered in 1942===
In 1942, the Administrator of St. Peter&#x27;s, Ludwig Kaas, found remains in a second tomb in the monument. Being concerned that these presumed relics of a saint would not be accorded the respect they deserved, and having little understanding of correct archeological procedures, he secretly ordered these remains stored elsewhere for safe keeping.

After Kaas&#x27;s death, Margherita Guarducci discovered these relics by chance. She informed Pope Paul VI of her belief that these remains were those of Saint Peter. The anthropological tests on the relics fragmented was done by Professor Venerando Correnti of Palermo University in 1962, the results suggested that the bone fragments belong to a man who was a 60–70 years old and of robust physique. The examinations suggested that the feet of the person were viciously cut as Romans did to crucified corpses because it was easier than removing nails.

On June 26, 1968, Pope Paul VI announced that the relics of Saint Peter had been discovered, though only circumstantial evidence supports this claim. This includes nearby graffiti of Saint Peter&#x27;s name, claiming that he was buried there. On November 24, 2013, a portion of these relics were displayed publicly for the first time, after Pope Francis celebrated the closing &#x27;Year of Faith&#x27; Mass.

==Donation of nine bone fragments in 2019==
On July 2, 2019, it was announced that Pope Francis had transferred nine bone fragments to Orthodox Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew of Constantinople. Bartholomew, the highest ranking hierarch of the Eastern Orthodox Christian Church, described the gesture as &quot;brave and bold.&quot; Pope Francis has said his decision was born &quot;out of prayer&quot; and intended as a sign of the ongoing work towards communion between the Orthodox and Catholic Churches. The majority of Saint Peter&#x27;s remains still reside in Rome, preserved under the high altar of St Peter&#x27;s Basilica.

==Jerusalem ossuaries==
In 1953, two Franciscan friars discovered hundreds of 1st century ossuaries stored in a cave on the Mount of Olives near Jerusalem. The archaeologists claimed to have discovered the earliest physical evidence of a Christian community in Jerusalem, and that some of the ossuaries were inscribed with names congruent with many commonly found in the Bible; the name inscribed on one ossuary, for instance, was interpreted as reading (, &quot;Simon, the Son of Jonah&quot;). However, several scholars, both Protestant and Catholic, disputed that the tomb belonged to Peter, one of the reasons being that there was no inscription referring to him as () or &quot;Peter&quot;. Dr. Stephen Pfann of the University of the Holy Land says the inscription actually reads as , the Barzillai being a famous family in Jerusalem. The 43 inscriptions discovered in the Dominus Flevit cemetery between May 1953 and June 1955 were published with photographs by P. B. Bagatti and J. T. Milik in 1958.

==Nearby papal tombs==
Very little is known about the burial of Peter&#x27;s immediate successors, prior to the period when popes are known with relative certainty to have been buried in the various Catacombs of Rome. Burial near Peter, on Vatican Hill, is attributed to: Pope Linus, Pope Anacletus, Pope Evaristus, Pope Telesphorus, Pope Hyginus, Pope Pius I, Pope Anicetus (later transferred to the Catacomb of Callixtus), Pope Victor I. Epigraphic evidence exists only for Linus, with the discovery of a burial slab marked &quot;Linus&quot; in 1615; however, the slab is broken such that it could have once read &quot;Aquilinus&quot; or &quot;Anullinus&quot;.

With three exceptions, each pope before Anicetus, the first pope known to have been entombed in the Catacombs, is traditionally regarded as having been buried near Peter. A notable exception is Pope Clement I, who was traditionally regarded as having been martyred in the Black Sea near Crimea. Similarly, the original tombs of Pope Alexander I and Pope Sixtus I are unknown, although there are several churches positing mutually contradictory claims of translation.
==In popular culture==
Two books were written about the tomb and bones of St. Peter: &quot;The Bones of St Peter&quot; by John Evangelist Walsh and &quot;The Fisherman&#x27;s Tomb&quot; by John O&#x27;Neill.

In April 2017, CNN&#x27;S &quot;Finding Jesus Faith Fact Forgery&quot; show featured the story of St. Peter&#x27;s bones and tomb in its 5th episode from season 2.

The tomb makes an appearance in the 2009 film &quot;Angels &amp; Demons&quot; in which a container hidden within the tomb holding antimatter is set to explode, destroying Vatican City and symbolically Catholicism itself.

<text>The Vancouver International Film Festival (VIFF) is an annual film festival held in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, for two weeks in late September and early October.

The festival is operated by the Greater Vancouver International Film Festival Society, a provincially-registered non-profit and federally-registered charitable organization, which also runs the year-round programming of the Vancity Theatre and Lochmaddy Studio Theatre at the VIFF Centre.

Both in terms of admissions and number of films screened (133,000 and 324 respectively in 2016), VIFF is among the five largest film festivals in North America. The festival screens films annually from approximately 73 countries on 10 screens.

The festival has three main programming platforms: East Asian film, Canadian film, and nonfiction films. Besides films from around the world, VIFF also includes talks, workshops, performances, and other special events related to cinema.

==History==
The festival was first launched in 1958; however, facing financial and organizational difficulties in the late 1960s, it was discontinued after the 1969 festival. The Greater Vancouver International Film Festival Society was incorporated in the early 1980s and relaunched the festival in its current form in 1982, under the leadership of Leonard Schein.

In 2019, Member of Parliament Hedy Fry, chairwoman of the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage, announced that the Government of Canada would provide over $1.4 million in funding for that year&#x27;s festival, as well as for cultural infrastructure upgrades to its main theatre.

==Venues==

The relaunched festival was staged entirely at the city&#x27;s independent Ridge Theatre, although the festival has since expanded into a multi-venue event headquartered at the VIFF Centre in downtown Vancouver.

The VIFF Centre hosts VIFF&#x27;s year-round programming, workshops, special events and collaborates with local organizations for special events.

<text>André Thierstein Heinz (born December 9, 1969) is an American environmentalist. A descendant of Henry J. Heinz, he is the son of John Heinz and Teresa Heinz. 

==Biography==
Heinz has been active in the field of sustainable development since 1993, when he began working for William McDonough, the noted green architect and designer, on sustainable design issues and projects. At the same time, Heinz joined the board of The Heinz Endowments, where he oversaw the creation of an environmental grant-making program through a series of 14 topical environmental colloquia that convened leaders from around the world. He continues to serve on the Endowments board and on its Joint Investment Committee, which oversees the management of the $1.5 billion endowment.

Following a six-month urban redevelopment project for the City of Pittsburgh, where he applied his knowledge together with colleagues at Carnegie Mellon University, Heinz began research for Paul Hawken on his latest book titled &quot;Natural Capitalism.&quot; It chronicles examples of 75 percent or greater resource productivity at zero-to-negative cost, and suggests principles to help replicate those successes. Simultaneously, Heinz co-founded in 1995 the first U.S. office of The Natural Step, a Sweden-based nonprofit organization specialized in education and consulting around sustainable development.

In 1999, after receiving a masters in environmental management at the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, where he specialized in industrial environmental management and industrial ecology, Heinz accepted a job offer to run the international office of The Natural Step in Stockholm. In 2004, Heinz left The Natural Step to focus on U.S. presidential politics as a surrogate spokesperson specializing in environmental policy and issues. Since then, he has turned his attention yet again to Scandinavia as the founder of Sustainable Technology Capital, a growth-stage, private equity management firm focused on Nordic Cleantech.

===Personal life===
Heinz is a son of Henry John Heinz III, a U.S. Senator killed in a 1991 plane crash, and Maria Teresa Thierstein Simões-Ferreira, a businesswoman and philanthropist. He has a younger brother, Christopher, and an elder brother, John IV. His mother later married John Kerry, making Heinz a stepbrother of Alexandra Kerry and Vanessa Kerry.

Heinz married Maria Marteinsdottir in Sweden on 20 Aug 2016

<doc id="1029697" wikidata="Q897901" url="?curid=1029697" title="Brood (comics)">
<text>The Brood are a fictional race of insectoid, parasitic, extraterrestrial beings appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, especially &quot;Uncanny X-Men.&quot; Created by writer Chris Claremont and artist Dave Cockrum, they first appeared in &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #155 (March 1982).

==Concept and creation==
According to Dave Cockrum, the Brood were originally conceived to serve as generic subordinates for the main villain of &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #155: &quot;We had Deathbird in this particular story and Chris [Claremont] had written into the plot &#x27;miscellaneous alien henchmen.&#x27; So I had drawn Deathbird standing in this building under construction and I just drew the most horrible looking thing I could think of next to her.&quot;

==Biology==

===Physical characteristics===
The Brood are an alien race of insectoid beings. They are a specialized race, one that has evolved to reproduce and consume any available resource. They are sadistic creatures that enjoy the suffering they cause others, especially the terror their infection causes their hosts. 

Despite their resemblance to insects, the Brood have endoskeletons as well as exoskeletons. Also unlike insects, they have fanged jaws instead of mandibles. Their skulls are triangular and flat, with a birthmark between their eyes. Their two front legs are tentacles they can use to manipulate objects.

Due to their natural body armor and fangs, the Brood are very dangerous in combat. In addition, they have stingers that can deliver either paralyzing or killing venom.

===Reproduction===
The Brood reproduce asexually and have no clear gender. They reproduce by forcibly implanting their eggs into other sentient organism. Each host can only support one egg. Upon hatching, the host dies as the Brood egg releases mutagenic enzymes into the bloodstream. At the same time, the Broodling mentally attacks and assimilates its host.

They use a hive mind to pass memory to their hosts, which also passes an individual&#x27;s knowledge, given to a broodling, to the hive and back to the queen, meaning newborn brood know what any member of the race knows. Until the embryo gains the host&#x27;s body the embryo can only gain temporary control of the host, often without the host noticing as the host is unaware when it loses control.

If the host possesses any powers, the resultant Brood will inherit them. The persona of the host once the Brood is &quot;born&quot; appears to be extinguished, but in some cases, the host&#x27;s will may be strong enough to survive and coexist with the Brood&#x27;s. However it is implied that hosts with advanced healing ability are unable to turn, for example when an egg was implanted in Deadpool, instead of turning into a Brood, a small Brood burst out of Deadpool&#x27;s body.

===Civilization===
The Brood have a civilization based on the typical communal insect societies, such as those of the bees and ants. The Empress is the absolute ruler, while the Queens lead individual Brood colonies and the &quot;sleazoids&quot; do all the work; despite their evil, they never rebel against their Queens, perhaps due to the latter&#x27;s telepathic abilities. However, the Queens have no allegiance to each other. Some roles have proven to be flexible.

* The Empress is the ruler of the Brood and contains the species&#x27; hive mind. She exercises almost total control over her progeny, including determining which Brood become Queen and which remain Warrior-Prime. The Empress is larger than other Brood and has horns, whiskers, and telepathic powers.
* The Firstborn are the children and servants of the Empress. Because they are not born from hosts, they do not possess the Warrior-Prime ability to conceal their appearance by shifting into their host-forms. The Firstborn are larger than other Broods and possess biological armor and teleportation, but lack wings.
* The Brood Queens fulfill the mental command of the Empress and can communicate with their spawn via telepathy. Additionally, they lead Brood colonies and have venomous stingers.
* The Broodlings are Brood workers and warriors who are organized into several different roles, among them Weaponeers, Clan-Masters, Hunt-Masters, Huntsmen, Tech Handlers, and Scholars. Elite Broodlings are known as Warriors-Prime.
* The Brood King is a mutant Brood created when a King egg is implanted in its host. Unlike those infected with Queen or Drone eggs, the Brood King cannot infect others. It is later revealed that the King-type egg was created from Kree experimentation. Understanding the Brood&#x27;s volatile nature, the Kree created an egg-like device that can disrupt the species&#x27; matriarchy, control them, and use them as weapons to disrupt rival advanced civilizations. Broo, a Brood drone who developed sentience, later eats the device, temporarily giving him its properties.

== Technology ==
The Brood, like most alien species, possess advanced technology, however due to their nature it&#x27;s unknown if they developed it themselves or assimilated it for their own benefit. These include:
* Interstellar warships: despite using the Acanti, the Brood also use actual ships, however with a mixture of organic and inorganic material.
* Energy-based weapons
* Psi-scream weapons: gun-like devices that attacks the minds of targets with subconscious fears and hatreds.
* Inhibitor fields that block telepathy.
* Nanotechnology
* Teleportation

==Fictional species biography==
The Brood are the Main Universe&#x27;s first natural predators, spawned on a dark galaxy prior to the emergence of Galactus from his incubator. Their planet of origin is unknown, but it is rumored that the Brood originated from another dimension. They were eventually found and captured by the Kree Empire, along with other hive species, so they could weaponize them and use them against rival empires. The Supreme Intelligence approved of the idea, stating that they could be used against the Shi&#x27;ar Empire, although, he sees that it&#x27;ll take millions of years to create a large enough army to fully be unleashed as a weapon against their enemies.

In the next eight million years of experimentation, the Black Judges deemed the Brood a major success and were unleashed on the Shi&#x27;ar Galaxy where the Brood found certain large space-dwelling creatures that they decided to prey to use as living starships to infest neighboring star systems and initiating an intergalactic campaign to build a fearsome empire. These space-dwelling creatures included the whale-like Acanti and the shark-like Starsharks.

Years later, Kree warrior Mar-Vell, has been ordered to make contact with the stranded Grand Admiral Devros on a planet in the Absolom Sector, a region known to be infested with Brood, Mar-Vell&#x27;s team, which includes the medic Una and Colonel Yon-Rogg, was ambushed by Brood warriors after landing on the planet and taken prisoner by the Brood-infected Devros. The colony&#x27;s Brood Queen impregnates each captive with Brood embryos, but Mar-Vell and Una manage to escape, destroy both leaders of the Brood colony, and ridding themselves of their infections using Una&#x27;s modified omni-wave projector which had been designed to eliminate Brood embryos. After rescuing Colonel Yon-Rogg, the trio escape the planet and are rescued by the Shi&#x27;ar royal Deathbird.

Deathbird later allies with The Brood to gain their help deposing her sister Lilandra Neramani as ruler of their empire. As a reward for their help, Deathbird gives the Brood Lilandra, the X-Men, and Carol Danvers, along with Fang of the Imperial Guard, to use as hosts. The Brood infect the entire party, except for Danvers, who they perform experiments on because of her half-human/half-Kree genes. Wolverine&#x27;s adamantium skeleton allowed his healing ability to purge him of the embryo, and he helps the others escape. He is unable to save Fang, who becomes a Brood warrior before they leave.

The Brood Queen orders her forces to find them, until she is contacted by the Queen embryo that is implanted in Cyclops. It explains that the X-Men are returning to Broodworld. Resigned to their dooms, the heroes help the Acanti recover the racial Soul, a supernatural force that must be passed from one Acanti leader (&quot;The Prophet-Singer&quot;) to the next. The Soul is located in a crystalline part of the dead Acanti Prophet-Singer&#x27;s brain.

Afterwards, the Prophet-Singer leads the Acanti to safety in deep space. Returning to Earth with the Starjammers, the X-Men defeat and detain the Brood Queen infecting Charles Xavier. The advanced medical facilities at the Starjammers&#x27; disposal are able to transfer the consciousness of Xavier from the Brood Queen&#x27;s body to a new cloned body, enabling Xavier to walk again.

A Brood-filled starshark later crashes on Earth, leading to the infection of several nearby humans by the Brood. One of the victims is allowed to live as a human assistant, but when he leads the aliens to some mutants, the Brood infect him and the mutants as well. It is revealed that the Brood can morph into the host&#x27;s form or a hybrid of the two forms. In the course of the battle, an Earth woman named Hannah Connover is infected with a queen, though this problem would not develop until later.

Another branch of the Brood manage to land on Earth and infect more mutants, along with the Louisiana Assassins Guild of which X-Man Gambit is a member. The X-Men kill most of the infected people. They and Ghost Rider manage to rescue many of the Brood&#x27;s other uninfected prisoners, only to have the &quot;Spirit of Vengeance&quot; become infected himself. Psylocke manages to separate Ghost Rider from the Brood host before it could kill Danny Ketch, the current host of the Ghost Rider, and he and the X-Men saved New Orleans.

Hannah Connover, previously infected with a Queen, soon begins to demonstrate attributes of Brood. She uses her new-found &quot;healing&quot; powers to become a faith healer and cure many people with her reverend husband, but secretly her Brood nature causes her to infect many people with embryos. Across the Galaxy, on the &quot;true&quot; Brood Homeworld, the Brood Empress sends her &quot;firstborn&quot; Imperial Assassins to kill Hannah for going against the Empress&#x27; wishes. Unable to stop future waves of Assassins from coming, the X-Man, Iceman, freezes Connover, putting her in suspended animation and causing the current firstborn to kill themselves, as in their minds the mission was accomplished. Connover is assumed to still be in suspended animation with her Queen host in the custody of the X-Men.

In &quot;Contest of Champions II&quot;, the Brood and the Badoon abduct several heroes and pose as a benevolent species willing to give the heroes access to advanced technology after competing against each other in a series of contests. However, in reality, the Brood intend to use Rogue, infested with a Brood Queen, to absorb the powers of the contest winners and become unstoppable. Fortunately, Iron Man realizes that the Brood are drugging food to amplify aggression- relying on his armor&#x27;s own life-support systems to prevent him succumbing to the &#x27;infection&#x27;- and is able to uncover the plot.

Although the Queen had already absorbed the powers and skills of the various contest winners- in the form of Captain America, Thor, the Hulk, Spider-Man, Jean Grey and the Scarlet Witch-, the remaining heroes managed to defeat her. The Brood Queen was extracted from Rogue with the aid of Carol Danvers, who forced the Brood Queen to flee by threatening to kill Rogue. After confirming that Rogue was cured, the heroes returned home.

A mixed team of X-Men and Fantastic Four was formed to investigate what happened to the NASA space station Simulacra, only to discover that it had been taken over by the Brood scouting party, leading the way to Earth for the Brood armies. After battling them, they left the station leaving the infected crew members alive despite the desires of Wolverine and Emma Frost to kill them due to the interference of the Invisible Woman. Soon a Brood invasion arrived at New York City. The X-Men and Fantastic Four defended the city from the Brood despite facing overwhelming odds. Using an enhanced Cerebro, Emma Frost projected a telepathic hallucination of the Phoenix and Galactus appearing in the city, which caused the Brood to panic and recall their forces to the dozens of Acanti ships after which they fled Earth.

It was also revealed that at some point in the dawn of civilization during the year 2610 BC, a spaceship filled with Brood crash landed in Egypt, marking the end of the second great dynasty. They went as far as turning a Pharaoh into one of their own and it also would have been the end of days if not for Imhotep and a group of soldiers, among them En Sabah Nur, who were able to successfully fend off the invasion. Imhotep himself killed the Queen.

The Brood return to Earth in the &quot;Ms. Marvel&quot; series and battle Carol Danvers, who as Binary played a key role in their earlier defeat. Strangely enough, none of the Brood present recognize who she is, possibly because of her inability to fully access her cosmic powers, which also changed her physical appearance. The Brood are also stalked and summarily exterminated by the alien hunter called Cru, with whom Ms. Marvel also came into violent contact.

It later turned out that there had been escape pods from the Acanti, and the other one had the Brood Queen who had landed on Monster Island. Cru itself was back on Earth, having regenerated and was searching the Brood Queen. Ms. Marvel, seeing her as a threat, fought Cru again and in the process merged part of their minds temporarily making them unable to use their powers and therefore vulnerable to the Brood. The Brood Queen had established a nest on the island and infected the Moloids with their eggs. Ms. Marvel then discovered that the Brood Queen who ruled over the Brood of Sleazeworld had survived and now had a crystalline form. Upon arriving on the island, Operation: Lightning Storm strike team and Wonder Man battled the Brood, while Cru and Ms. Marvel having regained the ability to use their powers fought the Brood Queen. In the process Cru was killed, after which the Brood Queen was taken into space by Ms. Marvel who destroyed her with a nuclear weapon.

During the invasion of Annihilus and his Annihilation Wave, the Brood were decimated, and the species is now on the brink of extinction.

Some Brood appear in the arena of planet Saakar in the &quot;Planet Hulk&quot; storyline of &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot;, one of them even becoming a main character. A Brood referred to as &quot;No-Name&quot;, who becomes a genetic queen because their race is becoming rarer, becomes the lover of insect king Miek and also appears in &quot;World War Hulk&quot;. When it is discovered that Miek was the one who let the Hulk&#x27;s shuttle explode, No-Name and Hulk attack Miek. Near the end of the War the &quot;Earth Hive&quot;, the shared consciousness of every insect on Earth, use Humbug as a Trojan Horse to deal a crippling blow to No-Name, rendering her infertile and poisoning the last generation of hivelings, growing in Humbug&#x27;s body. No-Name is a rarity among the Brood, as she learned to feel compassion for other living beings.

The Brood reappeared once again in the pages of &quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot;, however these Brood are revealed to be actual genetically grown hybrids created by a geneticist known only as Kaga who started growing and redesigning them with missing data about post M-Day work on Henry McCoy&#x27;s research computers.

In the 2011 &quot;Meanwhile&quot; storyline &quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot;, S.W.O.R.D. scientists successfully find a way to remove a Brood embryo from a human host, but not before the Brood they are studying escape and attack, prompting a botched rescue mission led by Abigail Brand and another rescue mission led by the X-Men.

Given the chance to lower the Brood&#x27;s numbers further, they discovered that the Annihilation event had caused the interstellar ecosystem to destabilize, since the Brood, dangerous as they are, served as natural predators for even worse species. These remaining species are now breeding out of control and present a greater threat than the Brood ever did. With no other choice, the X-Men act to prevent the Brood extinction. According to Bishop, there would be a race of benevolent Brood in the future, prompting the X-Men to willingly serve as Brood hosts, so that they could instill them with the same compassion felt by No-Name. After being connected with the hive-mind, the X-Men learned of a nearby Brood who was born with the ability to feel compassion, making him the Brood equivalent of a mutant. While such Brood are typically destroyed upon hatching by their kind, this one was permitted to live due to the Brood&#x27;s dwindling numbers. After rescuing the Brood mutant and defeating the Brood in battle and allowing them to escape, the X-Men had their Brood embryos removed, to be raised aboard the Peak, with the Brood mutant acting as their mentor.

The 2012 X-Men subseries &quot;Wolverine and the X-Men&quot; featured a Broodling as a student at Wolverine&#x27;s Jean Grey School for Higher Learning. Nicknamed &quot;Broo&quot; by Oya, the Broodling was a mutant, and both intelligent and non-violent able to wear clothing and glasses (which he felt made him look less frightening). Broo expressed a desire to join the Nova Corps. In a possible future timeline seen by Deathlok, Broo joined the X-Men.

During the &quot;Age of Ultron&quot; storyline, it is revealed that while in a hidden S.H.I.E.L.D. substation decades in the past, the future-Wolverine released and was infected by a less menacing Brood. When he cut the embryo out of his body, the Brood Collective responded to the attack by altering the physical structure of all future Brood to the form it is now known for.

During the &quot;Infinity&quot; storyline, a Brood Queen appeared as a member of the Galactic Council where she represents the Brood race, which indicates that the Brood Empress was apparently one of the casualties of the Annihilation Wave. She later made a deal with J&#x27;son, the former Emperor of the Spartoi Empire which consisted in J&#x27;son surrendered the planet Spartax to the Brood, and in exchange, J&#x27;son would acquire one planet for every ten worlds they conquered ever since.

In &quot;Spider-Man and the X-Men&quot;, the Brood made a pact with the Symbiotes but ended up being betrayed and possessed until Spider-Man, with the help of the X-Men and S.W.O.R.D managed to defeat them.

During &quot;The Black Vortex&quot; storyline, the deal between the Brood Queen and J&#x27;son is discovered as the Brood began their takeover of Spartax and use the entire planet as hosts. The plot is foiled once Kitty Pryde is cosmically powered by the Black Vortex and banishes the Brood from the planet.

Later the Galactic Council manipulated Thanos into attacking the Earth so he could make way for them to raze the planet, the Queen of the Brood was killed by Angela before she and the other leaders of the Galactic Council could begin their attack.

Dario Agger and Roxxon Energy Corporation managed to obtain some Brood. Using some parasites on some wolves, Agger and one of his scientists sent them to track down Weapon H. When Weapon H slayed them, Dario Agger had Brood Drones, Brood-infected Space Sharks, and a Brood-infected human riding an Acanti into attacking Weapon H. After the Brood Drones and Brood-Space Sharks are slain and the Acanti is knocked out, the Brood-infected human states to Weapon H that Roxxon wants to hire him. Weapon H stated that those who claim to help people will kill them anyway and has the Brood-infected human carry a message to Roxxon to leave him alone.

Later a Brood Queen came to Earth to find the perfect host so she can initiate the process to become the new Brood Empress. Her attempts at targeting astronauts were thwarted by the discovery that J. Jonah Jameson is the perfect host but Frank Castle was able to interfere.

When the New Mutants returned from a space adventure with a mysterious egg which turned out to be extremely valuable to rival alien nation-states of the Kree and the Shi&#x27;ar, as well as the Brood, as shown by the Kree and Shi&#x27;ar fighting over its location and the Brood invading Earth to get it back. The X-Men beat them back while Broo and his colleagues studied the egg and learn that it actually was the King Egg, a superweapon developed by Kree scientists thousands of years before the modern Marvel Universe on the Kree capital world of Hala, to foster the Brood race and instill a patriarchal element that, when activated, could give one member a supercharged version of the Empress&#x27; pheromonal control to turn the entire Brood species into a controllable army. This would allow the Kree to set the deadly predators against rival intergalactic powers and consume them.

This leads every Brood Queen to send their swarms in pursuit of it, to prevent any loss of their power in the Brood hive-mind. The Brood initially attacked Earth, but a small team of X-Men including Cyclops, Jean Grey, Havok, Vulcan and Broo was able to get the King Egg off of Earth and lead the aliens off-planet. The Brood followed after them, with the X-Men eventually ending up alongside the Starjammers and members of the Shi&#x27;Ar Imperial Guard. After crash-landing on an abandoned planet, it initially looks like the assembled heroes are going to be overwhelmed and wiped out by the sheer magnitude of Brood attacking them. As the various factions of the Brood descended upon the X-Men in a massive battle, the Brood suddenly stopped in place. But just as the Brood surround them, to everyone&#x27;s surprise, the Brood halt their attack when Broo eats the King Egg. This enhances Broo&#x27;s biology, increasing his pheromone output to the point where even the Brood Queens become subservient of him. For all intents and purposes, eating the egg turned Broo into the Brood King.

Some time later, the X-Men got a distress call from deep space and find that the galaxy’s Brood problem is not as solved as they’d thought! When the X-Men’s close friend Broo became the Brood King, he gained the ability to control the savage alien race he was both a part of and so different from. Now he is experiencing his own nightmare scenario, the Brood are killing his friends, and there is nothing he can do to stop it! Rogue Brood factions have begun running wild. It was soon revealed that Nightmare is the force behind the recent Brood expansion, using his abilities to usurp control of the race whenever Broo is asleep, and he&#x27;s doing this specifically to take revenge on the X-Men for Jean Grey&#x27;s earlier victory over him, while the new Brood Empress, unhappy with the fact Broo had control of the entire Brood, used this opportunity to break free of him. The Empress also blames the Kree for creating the King Egg that gave Broo control over her race, and has a convoluted scheme to convert superheroes into Brood to use them as an army against the Kree; the part-Kree Captain Marvel is particularly key to this plot. However the plan backfired when the Empress killed Binary, enraging Carol to the point she created a black hole which killed not only the Empress but her loyal Brood too.

Summers eventually escaped, and began infecting other humans (Including the AoA version of Joseph &quot;Robbie&quot; Robertson, as well as friends of Misty Knight and Colleen Wing).

<doc id="1029709" wikidata="Q3541302" url="?curid=1029709" title="Volcano tectonic earthquake">
<text>A volcano tectonic earthquake or volcano earthquake is caused by the movement of magma beneath the surface of the Earth. The movement results in pressure changes where the rock around the magma has a change in stress. At some point, this stress can cause the rock to break or move. This seismic activity is used by scientists to monitor volcanoes. The earthquakes may also be related to dike intrusion and/or occur as earthquake swarms. Usually they are characterised by high seismic frequency and lack the pattern of a main shock followed by a decaying aftershock distribution of fault related tectonic earthquakes.

== Cause of volcano tectonic earthquakes ==

One possible scenario resulting in a possible volcano tectonic earthquake occurs in tectonic subduction zones. The compression of plates at these subduction zones forces the magma beneath them to move. Magma can not move through the newly compressed crust as easily. This means it tends to pool in magma chambers beneath the surface and between the converging tectonic plates. Many of the famous and most well known volcanoes are of this type, including those of the Ring of Fire. As the plates move, magma underground may be forced in and out of these chambers and form intrusions into surrounding crust. This movement is capable of causing the unstable rocks around it to cave in or shift. The movement of this magma as described, causes measurable seismic activity. Where plates diverge such as at mid-ocean ridges the magma also can move into storage chambers and form intrusions again causing shifts in the rocks around them that can be detected as earthquakes. This is separate from earthquakes directly related to faults. However it is known than tectonic earthquake triggering has occurred with some volcanic eruptions, and there may be other associations of these in place and time with some eruptions, which could cause confusion because of the similar terminology.

Scientists monitoring volcanoes have noticed that magma movement may lead to earthquake swarms depending on the movement of magma and the interaction with rock beneath the ground. Additionally, the volatility of volcanoes and the accompanying earthquakes has been shown to be linked to dike induced stress and the interaction this causes between the magma, rock, and wall of the chamber.

== Importance ==
Volcano tectonic seismicity is an important tool as it may predict the eruptions of volcanoes. Seismic activity occurs as a precursor to most large eruptions. Rarely, because of complex interactions, it may appear to settle just before an eruption. Such tectonic events can predict eruptions in long-dormant volcanoes and the size of the magma pocket. Some notable examples of eruptions preceded by volcano tectonic earthquakes include ones at Nevado del Ruiz (1985), Pinatubo (1991), Unzen (1990), and Cotopaxi (2002). Quakes with volcano-tectonic characteristics accompany magmatic intrusions in near real time.

== Use in monitoring volcanoes ==

Nearly every recorded volcanic eruption has been preceded by some form of earthquake activity beneath or near the volcano. This does not mean that always this activity will give sufficient warning of an eruption. However, for individual volcanoes, the relationship between earthquakes and magma movement or possible eruptions has resulted in approximately 200 of the world&#x27;s volcanoes being seismically monitored. The recording of several years of background seismic data has allowed classification of volcanic earthquakes. These earthquakes tend to occur in swarms as opposed to mainshock–aftershock sequences, have smaller maximum sizes than tectonic structure earthquakes, have similar waveform patterns, increase in number before eruptions, and occur near or beneath the site of the eruption. Volcano tectonic earthquake seismicity typically originates lateral to the site of the volcanic eruption to come, at tectonic fault structures a few kilometres away. Such earthquakes have a large non-double couple component to their focal mechanism.

Other types of seismic activity monitored in relation to volcanoes and their eruptions are long period seismic waves (caused by sudden sporadic movement of magma that had previously not been moving due to a blockage), and harmonic tremor (indicating steady magma movement).

<doc id="1029711" wikidata="Q7556691" url="?curid=1029711" title="Solar zenith angle">
<text>The solar zenith angle is the zenith angle of the sun, i.e., the angle between the sun’s rays and the vertical direction. It is the complement to the solar altitude or solar elevation, which is the altitude angle or elevation angle between the sun’s rays and a horizontal plane. At solar noon, the zenith angle is at a minimum and is equal to latitude minus solar declination angle. This is the basis by which ancient mariners navigated the oceans. Solar zenith angle is normally used in combination with the solar azimuth angle to determine the position of the Sun as observed from a given location on the surface of the Earth.

==Formula==
formula_1

where
* formula_2 is the &quot;solar zenith angle&quot;
* formula_3 is the &quot;solar altitude angle&quot;, formula_4
* formula_5 is the hour angle, in the local solar time.
* formula_6 is the current declination of the Sun
* formula_7 is the local latitude.

== Derivation of the formula using the subsolar point and vector analysis ==

While the formula can be derived by applying the cosine law to the zenith-pole-Sun spherical triangle, the spherical trigonometry is a relatively esoteric subject. 

By introducing the coordinates of the subsolar point and using vector analysis, the formula can be obtained straightforward without incurring the use of spherical trigonometry.

In the Earth-Centered Earth-Fixed (ECEF) geocentric Cartesian coordinate system, let formula_8 and formula_9 be the latitudes and longitudes, or coordinates, of the subsolar point and the observer&#x27;s point, then the upward-pointing unit vectors at the two points, formula_10 and formula_11, are

formula_12
formula_13

where formula_14, formula_15 and formula_16 are the basis vectors in the ECEF coordinate system.

Now the cosine of the solar zenith angle, formula_17, is simply the dot product of the above two vectors

formula_18

Note that formula_19 is the same as formula_6, the declination of the Sun, and formula_21 is equivalent to formula_22, where formula_5 is the hour angle defined earlier. So the above format is mathematically identical to the one given earlier. 

Additionally, Ref. also derived the formula for solar azimuth angle in a similar fashion without using spherical trigonometry.

=== Minimum and Maximum ===


At any given location on any given day, the solar zenith angle, formula_17, reaches its minimum, formula_25, at local solar noon when the hour angle formula_26, or formula_27, namely, formula_28, or formula_29. If formula_30, it is polar night.

And at any given location on any given day, the solar zenith angle, formula_17, reaches its maximum, formula_32, at local midnight when the hour angle formula_33, or formula_34, namely, formula_35, or formula_36. If formula_37, it is polar day.

===Caveats===
The calculated values are approximations due to the distinction between common/geodetic latitude and geocentric latitude. However, the two values differ by less than 12 minutes of arc, which is less than the apparent angular radius of the sun.

The formula also neglects the effect of atmospheric refraction.

==Applications==

===Sunrise/Sunset===

Sunset and sunrise occur (approximately) when the zenith angle is 90°, where the hour angle &quot;h&quot;0 satisfies
formula_38

Precise times of sunset and sunrise occur when the upper limb of the Sun appears, as refracted by the atmosphere, to be on the horizon.

===Albedo===
A weighted daily average zenith angle, used in computing the local albedo of the Earth, is given by
formula_39
where &quot;Q&quot; is the instantaneous irradiance.

===Summary of special angles===

For example, the solar elevation angle is:
* 90° at the subsolar point, which occurs, for example, at the equator on a day of equinox at solar noon
* near 0° at the sunset or at the sunrise
* between −90° and 0° during the night (midnight)

An exact calculation is given in position of the Sun. Other approximations exist elsewhere.

<doc id="1029720" wikidata="Q4758995" url="?curid=1029720" title="Andrew Young (poet, born 1885)">
<text>Andrew John Young (29 April 1885 – 25 November 1971) was a Scottish poet and clergyman, although recognition of his poetry was slow to develop.

==Life==
Andrew Young was born to the stationmaster of Elgin in Scotland in 1885. Two years later his father moved to Edinburgh, where young Andrew attended the Royal High School and later took an arts degree at the University of Edinburgh. The disappearance of his brother David in discreditable circumstances in 1907 so affected him that he gave up his intention to become a barrister and instead studied theology at the local New College. Old habits died hard, however, and his first collection of poems, &quot;Songs of Night&quot;, a work of Swinburnean aestheticism, was published in 1910 at his father&#x27;s expense - pillar of the presbytery though he was.

Ordained into the United Free Church of Scotland in 1912, Young was appointed two years later to his first ministry in the village of Temple, Midlothian, and married Janet Green, who was lecturing in English at a teacher training college in Glasgow. Thereafter she devoted her energies to looking after their two children, Anthony (1915–1987) and Alison (1922–2001), and making it possible for her husband to pursue his literary career.

After the hiatus of war service, Young&#x27;s next appointment took him to Sussex where in 1920 he became the minister of the Presbyterian Church at Hove. In that year too &quot;Boaz and Ruth&quot;, his next collection was published, shortly followed by several more. The style was now that of the Georgian poets, among whom he had many friends. In 1939 he applied for admission to the Anglican ministry and in 1941 became Vicar of the rural parish of Stonegate in East Sussex. In 1959 he was enabled to retire and moved to Yapton, where he had become a canon of the nearby Chichester Cathedral.

==Later writing==
Young came to reject his former style upon achieving the honed and focused nature poetry of &quot;Winter Harvest&quot; (1933) and the four later collections that he called his canon. Earlier poems were now &#x27;quarried&#x27; and rewritten in his new style. The change was signalled by signing these poems as Andrew Young, rather than A.J.Young as formerly, and it was only from the publication of the 1960 &quot;Collected Poems&quot; that editors began to use selections from the earlier work again. His new manner was characterised by sharp observation and the movement of the poetry towards a striking final image, as in the short &quot;Essex Salt-Marsh&quot;.

::Now the tide’s task is done,
::Marsh runnels turn and chuckling run
::Or come to a standstill,
::The level ground for them a breathless hill.

::And as they run or faint
::Through mud that takes the sunset’s paint,
::The gullies they have worn
::Shine as with purple grapes and golden corn.

There were several musical settings of his poetry, including the incidental music composed by Imogen Holst for his play &quot;Nicodemus&quot; (1937). &quot;Christmas Day&quot; from his collection &quot;Speak to the Earth&quot; (1939) also proved popular with composers and was set by Mervyn Roberts (1947), Robin Milford (1949), Neil Butterworth (1954), and Elizabeth Poston (1967).

The work of his later years included the two long religious poems of &quot;Out of the World and Back&quot; (1958), highly regarded at the time, and several prose works dealing with botany and the landscape. His literary reputation was being fostered in these years by Leonard Clark, who made selections and collections of his poetry between 1959 and 1974. Thereafter his daughter, who had married the poet Edward Lowbury, continued the work.

Recognition of Young&#x27;s writing came slowly. The Royal Society of Literature awarded him the Benson Medal in 1939 and gave him an honorary fellowship in 1951. In that year too he received an honorary degree from the University of Edinburgh and, in the following year, was awarded the Queen&#x27;s Gold Medal for Poetry.

<doc id="1029726" wikidata="Q928430" url="?curid=1029726" title="DAMS">
<text>DAMS (formerly Driot-Arnoux Motorsport, currently Driot Associés Motor Sport; racing as DAMS [[Lucas Oil]] for sponsorship reasons) is an auto racing team from France, involved in many areas of motorsport. DAMS was founded in 1988 by Jean-Paul Driot and Formula One driver René Arnoux. In 2022 it was bought by ex-F1 driver Charles Pic. It is headquartered near Le Mans, only 2 km from the Bugatti Circuit.

DAMS has enjoyed success in both drivers and team championships in multiple formula series across the world, and has helped launch the careers of several high profile drivers.

==History==
The year after its foundation, DAMS joined the International Formula 3000 Championship. They stayed in F3000 until 2001. DAMS were one of many French teams that were part of the Elf young driver sponsorship program.

Aside from F3000, DAMS planned to join the F1 World Championship in , with a car (the GD-01) developed by Reynard, but lack of funds prevented the team from advancing.

DAMS enter in sports car racing since 1997 until 2002 where it helped the &quot;Michel Vaillant&quot; movie, preparing and racing cars in the 24 Hours of Le Mans.

In August 2019, founder Jean-Paul Driot died, aged 68. His two sons, Olivier and Gregory Driot, took over as co-team principals, until former Formula 1 driver Charles Pic bought the team in February 2022.

===Formula 3000/GP2 Series/FIA Formula 2 Championship===
Right from its inception, the French team entered the FIA International Formula 3000 Championship, which they won in 1990 with Érik Comas, 1992 with Olivier Panis and 1994 with Jean-Christophe Boullion.

In 13 years, 1989 to 2001, DAMS won 4 team titles, 3 drivers titles, 21 wins, 19 pole positions and 19 fastest laps, making DAMS one of the most successful Formula 3000 teams with Super Nova Racing and Arden International.

The team competed in the GP2 Series since its beginning in 2005, winning races with drivers José María López and Nicolas Lapierre.
DAMS was associated with the Toyota Drivers Program (TDP) from 2006 to 2009, and ran their drivers in the GP2 Series. In 2006, it was Franck Perera and then Kazuki Nakajima in 2007, who finished 5th in the GP2 championship and raced in the last Formula One Grand Prix of the season with Williams. Following this he won a full-time race seat with the team for 2008 and was retained for the 2009 season. In 2008, TDP driver Kamui Kobayashi replaced Nakajima at DAMS GP2 and became the Toyota Racing test driver. Kobayashi stayed on in 2009, and was partnered by Jérôme d&#x27;Ambrosio for these two years. Neither driver was able to put together a consistent run of form in the main GP2 Series championships, but Kobayashi did win the 2008–09 Asian championship with the team.
D&#x27;Ambrosio remained with the team for 2010, and was paired with Ho-Pin Tung, who replaced the Sauber-bound Kobayashi. As part of an agreement with the Renault Formula One team, both were nominated as Renault F1 test drivers, and the DAMS GP2 cars were liveried in an identical yellow-and-black scheme to the Renault R30 chassis. D&#x27;Ambrosio won the sprint race at Monaco, but his form thereafter was disappointing and he was rested for one of the rounds in favour of Romain Grosjean, another driver with Renault F1 links. Grosjean later got the opportunity to move into the team full-time when Tung, yet to score a point after 12 races, sustained a broken vertebra in a racing accident. D&#x27;Ambrosio, Grosjean and Tung finished 12th, 14th and 28th respectively in the drivers&#x27; championship, whilst DAMS finished sixth position in the teams&#x27; championship. Grosjean remained with the team for 2011, with Norwegian rookie Pål Varhaug replacing D&#x27;Ambrosio, who graduated to F1 with the Virgin Racing team. DAMS retained its links with Renault, although these were somewhat diluted by the F1 team&#x27;s new sponsorship deal with Lotus Cars, which also backed the rival ART team in GP2. Grosjean dominated the year, winning both the Asian and main series championships. DAMS also won the Asian teams&#x27; title, but Varhaug&#x27;s failure to score points in the main series saw the team beaten to the championship by Addax.

For the 2012 season, Grosjean moved to the Lotus (formerly Renault) Formula One team, and Varhaug switched to the Auto GP World Series; they were replaced by series veteran Davide Valsecchi and reigning British F3 champion Felipe Nasr. Valsecchi began the season strongly, winning an unprecedented three races in a row in Bahrain, and later prevailed over closest rival Luiz Razia to win the championship, whilst Nasr finished on the podium four times to finish tenth in the championship, the second-highest rookie behind James Calado. Between them, Valsecchi and Nasr scored enough points to win DAMS&#x27;s first GP2 Teams&#x27; Championship, six points ahead of ART, competing under the Lotus GP banner.

The team wrapped up both the 2014 Drivers&#x27; and Teams&#x27; Championships, with Jolyon Palmer winning the former. DAMS went into the 2015 season with Red Bull Junior Team driver Pierre Gasly and 2014 GP3 champion Alex Lynn as their driver lineup. The team struggled in the Bahrain feature race with Gasly being involved in a fourth lap collision with Arthur Pic, Raffaele Marciello and Norman Nato and Lynn falling down the order after driving into the back of Alexander Rossi and damaging his front wing. Both drivers finished outside the points in the following day&#x27;s sprint race. The team had an improved weekend in Barcelona, with Lynn taking his first GP2 victory in the sprint race and Gasly joining him on the podium in third.

In 2018, the team fielded Nicholas Latifi and Alexander Albon in the FIA Formula 2 Championship. The team secured third place in the constructors&#x27; championship and took 5 wins during the season (4 for Albon and 1 for Latifi). The team&#x27;s 2018 lineup will race together for the first time in three years in the 2022 Formula One World Championship for the Williams team.

For the 2019 season, the team hired Sérgio Sette Câmara to replace Albon, who was promoted to Formula 1 with Toro Rosso for 2019. They won the Teams&#x27; Championship with 418 points, and 6 wins (5 for Latifi, who was promoted to Formula 1 for 2020 to drive for Williams, and 2 for Sette Câmara, who later moved on to Formula E to drive for the GEOX Dragon team.

For the 2020 season, the team hired Sean Gelael and Dan Ticktum to race for them. After a disappointing season, the team slumped to 8th in the Teams&#x27; Championship, accumulating a total of 115.5 points, with Ticktum scoring both of their wins (at Spielberg, and at Silverstone.) 

For the 2021 season, the team hired two new drivers Roy Nissany and Marcus Armstrong to replace the Carlin-bound Ticktum and the WEC-bound Gelael. Scoring only one win all year (through Armstrong at Jeddah, the team once again finished 8th in the Teams&#x27; Championship, with 65 points.

For the 2022 season, the team stayed with Nissany for another season and hired Japanese rookie Ayumu Iwasa. 2022 was seen as an improvement for DAMS, as they finished 6th in the Teams&#x27; Championship. They scored a total of 2 wins (both scored by Iwasa), and 161 points (141 for Iwasa, who finished 5th in the Drivers&#x27; Championship; and 20 for Nissany, who finished 19th.)

For the 2023 season, the team stuck with Iwasa for his second year in the category, and hired Monegasque rookie Arthur Leclerc from Prema&#x27;s Formula 3 team.

===A1 Grand Prix, Formula Renault and Formula E===
In the 2003 and 2004 seasons, DAMS took part in the Formula Renault V6 Eurocup, which they won that same year with Argentinian José María López. In 2005 the team entered the World Series by Renault. Since 2005, DAMS joined the GP2 Series but also the A1 Grand Prix where it serviced three teams.

Driot is one of the owners of the A1 Team France. DAMS also managed A1 Team Switzerland, A1 Team Mexico and later A1 Team South Africa in the A1 Grand Prix championships. With A1 Team France, DAMS was the first winner of the series winning 13 of the 22 races including in the 2005–06 season.

For the 2007–08 season, A1 Team France and South Africa collaborated closely to finalize the car like it was previously done with A1 Team Switzerland.

The team joined the new Formula E championship in 2014 under the name e.dams, with collaboration from Alain Prost. Sébastien Buemi was runner-up in the inaugural season and champion in 2015–16, having claimed 8 wins and 13 podiums in 23 races. Nicolas Prost finished sixth and third respectively, claiming three wins. In the 2016–17 season, the team clinched their third straight constructors&#x27; title but Buemi lost the title to Lucas di Grassi at the final round in Montreal. Buemi also had to miss the New York City rounds due to commitments in the World Endurance Championship and was replaced by Pierre Gasly.

The following season saw the team&#x27;s final season with Renault in Formula E fail to see any of their drivers win a single race in the championship. Their highest finish was 2nd for Buemi in Marrakesh. The team could only finish fifth in the constructors&#x27; championship. At the end of the season, Nicolas Prost left the team.

For the 2018–19 season, the team switched to Nissan and originally hired Alexander Albon to partner Buemi, however on 26 November 2018 Albon was released from his contract with the team to instead drive in the 2019 Formula One season with the Toro Rosso team. Four days later, the team signed Oliver Rowland, who raced for the team in the 2017 FIA Formula 2 Championship. As is traditional with Nissan factory teams, their car numbers are 22 and 23, since the numbers 2 and 3 are pronounced &quot;ni&quot; and &quot;san&quot; in Japanese.

Under the Nissan banner, the team couldn&#x27;t win any championship. Their first powertrain named &quot;Nissan IM01&quot; proved to be controversial as e.dams were the only team to use a dual-motor setup, having scored six poles with this powertrain. This was eventually outlawed in technical regulations for the 2019–20 season. Despite being forced by rules to significantly change their powertrain design, Nissan e.dams improved in the COVID-impaced 2019–20 season, ending up second in Teams&#x27; Championship instead of fourth.

After two disappointing seasons in a row with a 10th place in the 2020–21 season and a 9th position in the 2021–22 season, Nismo decided to part ways with DAMS and operate the team on their own.

=== Sports car racing ===

Starting from 1997, Driot&#x27;s team diversified into sports car racing, entering the FIA GT Championship in partnership with Panoz. Splitting up in the following year, DAMS ran a Lola B98/10 with a Judd engine in the SportsRacing World Cup, winning four races, as well as participating in the American Le Mans Series and the 24 Hours of Le Mans.

In 2000 and 2001, DAMS associated themselves with General Motors, preparing the works Cadillac Northstar LMP prototypes for the American Le Mans Series, FIA Sportscar Championship and the 24 Hours of Le Mans, but failed to get any competitive results.

DAMS (running the Bob Berridge Racing Lola) helped the &quot;Michel Vaillant&quot; movie crew in the 2002, 24 Hours of Le Mans entering with a Lola B98/10-Judd as &quot;Vaillante&quot; and a Panoz LMP-1 Roadster-S-Élan as &quot;Leader&quot;.

They then switched their effort to an FIA GT return. In 2003, they tried entering two Nissan 350Z, but once again funds prevented the French team from developing the Japanese car. In 2004, they teamed with Lamborghini and entered two Murciélago R-GT cars in the final rounds of the FIA GT Championship.

==Notable drivers==
Several drivers have enjoyed success during and after their time with DAMS, including Formula One Grand Prix winners Olivier Panis and Pierre Gasly, 24 Hours of Le Mans winners Allan McNish, Sébastien Bourdais, Kazuki Nakajima, Sébastien Buemi, Neel Jani, Kamui Kobayashi and José María López, as well as multiple Formula One drivers. Success has also been achieved by former drivers in US open wheel racing: Bourdais winning four consecutive Champ Car World Series title, and Marcus Ericsson winning the 2022 Indianapolis 500.

Drivers who have won titles while driving for DAMS include Sébastien Buemi in Formula E, Érik Comas, Jean-Christophe Boullion and Olivier Panis in Formula 3000, José María López in Formula Renault, Kevin Magnussen and Carlos Sainz, Jr. in the World Series by Renault, and GP2 winners Romain Grosjean, Davide Valsecchi and Jolyon Palmer.

<text>Jean-Louis Schlesser (born 12 September 1948) is a French racing driver who has competed in both circuit racing and cross-country rallying. He is the nephew of Jo Schlesser, a former Formula One driver. Jean-Louis entered two Formula One races five years apart. At the 1988 Italian Grand Prix, he and race leader Ayrton Senna crashed out after colliding; the race was ultimately the only one of the 1988 Formula One season which was not won by a McLaren.

==Early career==
Schlesser grew up in Morocco before returning to France to study and to complete military service. He began racing in the early 1970s after enrolling at the racing school at Le Mans, starting with numerous rally events. In 1976, he entered Formula Three, alternating between the French and European series for the next six years, and sharing the 1978 French championship with Alain Prost. In 1977 he began racing sports cars, and in 1981 he attempted the Le Mans 24 Hours for the first time, placing second with Philippe Streiff and Jacky Haran. He also began racing touring cars in 1980, competing in the French Supertouring Championship. In 1982, he moved from Formula Three to Formula Two, but it was not a success. Nonetheless, he moved into Formula One in 1983, while continuing to race sports cars and touring cars.

==Formula One==
Schlesser was working as a test driver for Williams when he gained his first taste of Formula One (F1) in early 1983 when he bought a drive in the RAM team&#x27;s March-RAM 01-Cosworth. His first race was the non-championship Race of Champions at Brands Hatch, where he started last of the 13 entrants and finished 6th. A week later, at the French Grand Prix at Paul Ricard, he was the slowest of the 29 cars in qualifying and thus failed to qualify. He did not take part in another F1 race for five years, though he continued to test for Williams, and was active in sports car racing.

===1988 Italian Grand Prix===
In 1988, Williams called upon Schlesser to deputise for an unwell Nigel Mansell at the Italian Grand Prix at Monza. With 26 of the 31 cars allowed to start, Schlesser qualified 22nd, and thus made his Grand Prix debut the day before his 40th birthday.

In the race, Schlesser worked his way up to 11th, while Ayrton Senna led from pole position in his McLaren. In the closing stages, the Ferraris of Gerhard Berger and Michele Alboreto started to catch Senna, and were only a few seconds behind at the start of lap 49, with three laps remaining. At that point, Senna came up to lap Schlesser for the second time. Going into the tight Rettifilo chicane at the end of the start-finish straight, Schlesser went wide, expecting Senna to pass on the inside, and in the process locked his brakes. Wishing to keep his car on the track, Schlesser turned inside, and his left front wheel hit Senna&#x27;s right rear. With the rear suspension broken, the McLaren spun and beached itself on a kerb, leaving the Ferraris to secure a one-two finish on home soil, less than a month after Enzo Ferrari&#x27;s death. The collision also prevented the McLaren team from winning all 16 races of the 1988 season.

Afterwards, Schlesser said that he did not think the collision was his fault. Nonetheless, he made a tearful apology to Senna.

Twenty-five years later, at the 2013 Monaco Grand Prix, McLaren chairman Ron Dennis was reintroduced to Schlesser. Dennis said, &quot;This is the man who ruined my life and our perfect record back in 1988.&quot; Schlesser said that &quot;what happened that day at Monza kept you hungry.&quot;

==Touring car and sports car racing==
The mid-1980s saw Schlesser perform in touring cars and sports cars, winning the French Touring Car Championship in 1985 with a TWR Rover Vitesse, as well as driving the works TWR Jaguars in the World Sportscar Championship. In 1986 he raced in the British Touring Car Championship, again in a TWR Rover Vitesse.

In 1988, he joined the Sauber-Mercedes squad full-time, winning the German Supercup and finishing the World Sportscar Championship in second place, (behind Martin Brundle). before winning the WSC title in 1989 and 1990, on this occasion sharing the title with co-driver Mauro Baldi. His last season in WSC was 1991 during which he raced alongside Michael Schumacher with Sauber-Mercedes. He also won the &quot;Classic Masters&quot; title at the 1994 Race of Champions.

== Off-road racing ==
After a first outing in 1984, Schlesser began to compete regularly in the Paris-Dakar Rally in 1989. In 1992 he began to build his own dune buggies to compete in the Dakar and other desert marathons and European bajas. His first buggy, the Porsche-powered Schlesser Original, debuted in 1992 in the Baja Portugal 1000, which Schlesser won outright, beating the works Citroën cars with a two-wheel-drive vehicle and without a navigator by his side.

He went on to several 2WD class and overall wins the following years, before taking the overall victory in the 1999 and 2000 editions of the Dakar (respectively, Granada-Dakar and Paris-Dakar-Cairo). In the 2001 Dakar he was near victory but penalised one hour for unsportsmanlike conduct after illegally blocking his closest competitor both at the start and during the penultimate stage.

Returning to the podium for 2004 Dakar Rally with third overall, and once again in 2007, beating many factory efforts and winning stages, Schlesser and his team continued to compete in the event until 2008 Dakar Rally. That year, the rally raid was cancelled due to concerns over a possible terrorist attack. The outfit had three cars entered but did not return for the 2009 event.

He also won the FIA Cross Country Rally World Cup from 1998 to 2002 and the 2 WD FIA Cross Country Rally World Cup several times.
Schlesser won every edition of the Africa Eco Race from its establishment in 2009 to 2014.

<text>Garrick Gaieties is a revue with music by Richard Rodgers and lyrics by Lorenz Hart, the first successful musical by this songwriting team.

It debuted in 1925 on Broadway and was the first of three &quot;Garrick Gaiety&quot; revues, which were subsequently produced in 1926 and 1930. The show parodied current subjects, such as the New York City Subway system and the Theatre Guild (producer of the show). The &quot;Garrick Gaieties&quot; is remembered as &quot;bringing Rodgers and Hart their first major recognition.&quot; Their hit song &quot;Manhattan&quot; was introduced in this revue.

==Productions and history==
The revue first opened on Broadway at the Garrick Theatre on May 17, 1925, as a 2-performance benefit for the Theatre Guild. The reviews were favorable, and Rodgers and others persuaded the Theatre Guild to continue the production, which re-opened on June 8, 1925 and ran until November 28, for 211 performances. Several writers contributed the material for the sketches, including Edith Meiser, Sam Jaffe, Benjamin Kaye, Morrie Ryskind and Howard J. Green.

Directed by Philip Loeb with musical staging by Herbert Fields, the cast included Romney Brent, June Cochrane, Sterling Holloway, Libby Holman, Philip Loeb, Edith Meiser, Sanford Meisner, Betty Starbuck and Lee Strasberg.

===Subsequent productions===
There were two sequels, also titled &quot;Garrick Gaieties&quot;. They were produced on Broadway by the Theatre Guild with direction by Philip Loeb at the Guild Theatre, and opened, respectively, on May 10, 1926, June 4, 1930, and, in a return engagement for 10 performances, October 16, 1930. Sterling Holloway appeared in all of the sequels, and Edith Meiser appeared in all but the final one. Notable performers included Imogene Coca and Rosalind Russell. Ruth Tester sang, &quot;Sing Something Simple&quot;.

The music and lyrics for the 1926 Gaieties were written by Rodgers and Hart and introduced their famous song &quot;Mountain Greenery&quot;. The music and lyrics for the 1930 version were written by many, including Marc Blitzstein, Vernon Duke, Ira Gershwin, and Johnny Mercer.

==Sketches and musical numbers==
The opening number, &quot;Soliciting Subscriptions&quot; was a spoof of the Theatre Guild&#x27;s &quot;serious pretensions&quot;, along with the following song, &quot;Gilding the Guild&quot;. Ryskind wrote skits including a satire of President and Mrs. Calvin Coolidge, and a parody of the Scopes Trial, which was dropped from the show after William Jennings Bryan died on July 25, 1925. Libby Holman&#x27;s solo, &quot;Black and White&quot; was later dropped. Sterling Holloway and June Cochrane introduced the song &quot;Manhattan&quot;, as its &quot;easygoing strolling melody and ingeniously rhymed lyric related all of the everyday pleasures to be found in New York&quot;. The &quot;wittily unsentimental&quot; &quot;Sentimental Me&quot; was praised by the critics and was a hit money-maker as well.

<doc id="1029740" wikidata="Q711431" url="?curid=1029740" title="Leon Chwistek">
<text>Leon Chwistek (Kraków, Austria-Hungary, 13 June 1884 – Barvikha near Moscow, Russia, 20 August 1944) was a Polish logician, philosopher, mathematician, avant-garde painter, theoretician of modern art and literary critic.

==Career and philosophy==
In 1919 he was one of the founders of the Polish Mathematical Society. From 1922, he lectured in mathematics for natural scientists at the Jagiellonian University, where he obtained his habilitation in 1928 in mathematical logic.

Starting in 1929, Chwistek was a Professor of Logic at the University of Lwów in a position for which Alfred Tarski had also applied. His interests in the 1930s were in a general system of philosophy of science, which was published in a book translated in English 1948 as &quot;The Limits of Science&quot;.

In the 1920s–30s, many European philosophers attempted to reform traditional philosophy by means of mathematical logic. Leon Chwistek did not believe that such reform could succeed. He thought that reality could not be described in one homogeneous system, based on the principles of formal logic, because there was not one reality but many.

After the outbreak of World War II and the occupation of Lwów (renamed to Lviv) by the USSR, he remained at the university. He also started cooperation with &quot;Czerwony Sztandar&quot;. In September 1940, he joined the Union of Soviet Writers of Ukraine. In June 1941, just before the entry of the German troops, he evacuated from Lviv together with the Soviet troops deep into Russia. From 1941 to 1943, he lived in Tbilisi, where he taught mathematical analysis, and from 1943 in Moscow. He was active in the Union of Polish Patriots in the USSR.

Chwistek argued against the axiomatic method by demonstrating that the extant axiomatic systems are inconsistent.

==Artist==
Chwistek developed his theory of the multiplicity of realities first with regard to the arts. He distinguished four basic types of realities, then matched them with four basic types of painting.

The four types of realities were:
:1. popular reality (common-sense realism)
:2. physical reality (constructed by physics)
:3. phenomenal reality (sensory impressions)
:4. visionary/intuitive reality (dreams, hallucinations, subconscious states).

The types of painting corresponding to the above were:
:1. Primitivism
:2. Realism
:3. Impressionism
:4. Futurism
Chwistek never intended his views to constitute a new metaphysical theory. He was a defender of &quot;common sense&quot; against metaphysics and irrational feeling. His theory of plural reality was merely an attempt to specify the various ways in which the term, “real,” is used.
Chwistek&#x27;s fellow artist and closest friend, Stanislaw Ignacy Witkiewicz, harshly criticized his philosophical views. Witkiewicz&#x27;s own philosophy was based on a monadic character to the individual&#x27;s existence, embracing a multiplicity of existences, with the world being made up of a multiplicity of Particular Existences. In his 1919 painting titled &quot;Fencing&quot; inspirations from avant-garde trends prior to World War I such as cubism, Italian futurism, and Robert Delaunay’s simultanism can be observed.

<doc id="1029742" wikidata="Q7138466" url="?curid=1029742" title="Parkfield earthquake">
<text>Parkfield earthquake is a name given to various large earthquakes that occurred in the vicinity of the town of Parkfield, California, United States. The San Andreas fault runs through this town, and six successive magnitude 6 earthquakes occurred on the fault at unusually regular intervals, between 12 and 32 years apart (with an average of every 22 years), between 1857 and 1966. The latest major earthquake in the region struck on September 28, 2004.

Earthquakes may occur regularly here because the location is about midway on a fault segment between a &quot;locked&quot; segment to the south (last major earthquake 1857) and a &quot;creeping&quot; segment to the north where two tectonic plates are continuously moving without major earthquakes.

==Research==

Geologists who hoped to study what happens before a quake, and in particular any signs that might enable them to predict future earthquakes, installed an elaborate array of seismometers, creepmeters, strainmeters, and other instruments in and around Parkfield starting in 1985. Scientists with the USGS and UC Berkeley had predicted, with a 90 to 95% confidence level, that an earthquake would strike the Parkfield area between 1985 and 1993. This was known as the Parkfield Earthquake Prediction and the Parkfield Earthquake Experiment, conducted by the USGS. Attempts at predicting the quake continued until January 2001, but an earthquake of 5.5 magnitude or greater did not occur from 1985 until the 2004 quake.

In June 2004, the USGS in partnership with the National Science Foundation began drilling a deep hole to house instruments to monitor the fault at depth. This action was a part of the San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth (SAFOD) program.

Because of the regularity of large events (&gt;5.5) at the Parkfield location (events in 1857, 1881, 1901, 1922, 1934, and 1966), and the fact that the waveforms from many of these events were almost identical, it was believed that the same segment of fault ruptured each time. This led to the prediction in 1984 of a similar event in 1993.

==2004 event==
The 6.0 magnitude primary shock in 2004 was the result of a fault movement of about 18 inches (.5 meter). There have been no indications found that could have been used to predict this earthquake. Although well overdue, the probability of this quake occurring in 2004 has been estimated at ten percent. The magnitude of the event was consistent with previous earthquakes in this region.

Substantial aftershocks continued for more than a week after the initial event, moving in a northwesterly progression. In early October, there was a cluster of small earthquakes near Paso Robles near a parallel fault to the west. These may be in response to the transfer of stress to these faults after the release of stress at Parkfield. Past earthquakes have also occurred to the east of Parkfield at about the same distance from the San Andreas fault near Coalinga and Avenal.

==Recent developments==
In December 2004, seismologists at the University of California, Berkeley announced the discovery of subtle tremors near Cholame, a hamlet near the San Andreas fault directly south of Coalinga. This is in a region of the locked fault below the Parkfield episodes, last creating an 8.0 magnitude quake at Fort Tejon in 1857. These tremors were discovered using deep borehole seismometers that avoid surface noise. The spectral signatures of these motions are more similar to those of magma movement near volcanoes than of typical earthquakes, but it is believed that the motions are not due to magma or fluid motion. It is hoped that this new discovery may sometime inform scientists as to the degree of danger presented by known locked faults. It is not currently expected that this knowledge will be refined into a precise predictive tool.

==Fort Tejon earthquake==
What is possibly the largest earthquake on the San Andreas fault in the last several hundred years is the 1857 Fort Tejon earthquake, with a fault rupture from the general vicinity of Parkfield to San Bernardino in Southern California, a distance of about and an offset of about 9 meters (30 feet). The epicenter of this earthquake is (by various sources) believed to be somewhere in the region from Cholame to Parkfield, a location at the extreme northern end of the locked portion of the fault and at the southern end of the rapidly periodic segment. It is believed that this earthquake was preceded by a magnitude 6.0 foreshock that was centered at Parkfield.

<text>Naum (Bulgarian and ), also known as Naum of Ohrid or Naum of Preslav (c. 830 – December 23, 910), was a medieval Bulgarian writer and missionary among the Slavs, considered one of the Seven Apostles of the First Bulgarian Empire. He was among the disciples of Cyril and Methodius and is associated with the creation of the Glagolitic and Cyrillic script. Naum was among the founders of the Pliska Literary School. Afterwards Naum worked at the Ohrid Literary School. He was among the first saints declared by the Bulgarian Orthodox Church after its foundation in the 9th century. The mission of Naum played significant role by transformation of the local Early Slavs into Bulgarians.

== Life ==
Information about his early life is scarce. According to the Second Life of Saint Naum, he grew up in Moesia, which was the Byzantine designation for Bulgaria. According to the hagiography of Clement of Ohrid by Theophylact of Ohrid and some other sources, Naum took part in the historic mission to Great Moravia together with Cyril and Methodius, their disciples Gorazd, Clement of Ohrid, Angelar and Sava and other Slavic missionaries in 863.

=== Great Moravia and Lower Panonia===
For the next 22 years, he worked with Cyril and Methodius and other missionaries in translating the Bible into Old Church Slavonic and promoted it in Great Moravia and Principality of Lower Pannonia. In 867 or 868 he became a priest in Rome, ordained along with two other disciples of Cyril and Methodius, Gorazd and Clement of Ohrid, by bishops Formosus and Gauderic. For the purpose of the mission to Moravia, the missionaries devised the Glagolitic alphabet, the first alphabet to match the specific features of the Slavic language. Its descendant script, Cyrillic, is still used by many languages today. The missionaries also wrote the first Slavic Civil Code, which was used in Great Moravia. However, the missionary work ran into opposition from German clerics who opposed their efforts to create a Slavic liturgy. By 885, the two main patrons for the missionaries, Rastislav of Moravia of Great Moravia and Prince Koceľ of Lower Pannonia, as well as Cyril and Methodius had died, and the pressure from the German Church became increasingly more hostile. After a brief period of imprisonment due to the ongoing conflict with the German clerics, Naum, together with some of the missionaries (including Clement of Ohrid and Angelar) headed to Bulgaria.

=== First Bulgarian Empire ===
In 886 the governor of Belgrade, then in Bulgaria, welcomed the disciples of Cyril and Methodius. Bulgaria was ruled then by Knyaz Boris, who converted to Christianity in 864. After the christianization the religious ceremonies were conducted in Greek by a Byzantine clergy. Fearing growing Byzantine influence Boris viewed the adoption of the Old Church Slavonic as a way to preserve the political independence of Bulgaria. With such views, Boris made arrangements for the establishment of two literary academies where theology was to be taught in the Slavonic language. The first of the schools was founded in the capital, Pliska, and the second school in Ohrid, in the region of Kutmichevitsa. The development of Old Church Slavonic literacy had the effect of preventing the assimilation into the neighboring cultures and promoted the formation of a distinct Bulgarian identity. 

Naum moved initially to the capital Pliska together with Clement, Angelar and possibly Gorazd (according to other sources, Gorazd was already dead by that time). In Bulgaria, he spent the next 25 years of his life. Naum was one of the founders of the Pliska Literary School where he worked between 886 and 893. In 893, shortly after his rise to power, the new Bulgarian ruler Simeon the Great, summoned an ecclesiastical council in the new capital Preslav, where Clement was ordained bishop of Drembica and Velika. To replace Clement in Ohrid, Simeon sent Naum, who until then had been active in Preslav. Afterwards, Naum continued Clement&#x27;s work at Ohrid, another important centre of Slavic learning. In these years the Cyrillic script was created in the Preslav literary school, and was adopted in Bulgaria, possibly following Naum&#x27;s initiative. In 905 Naum founded a monastery on the shores of Lake Ohrid, which later received his name. He died there in 910 and Clement initiated the process of his canonization. In this way Naum became the first &quot;native&quot; saint of Bulgaria.

===Legacy===
The cults towards him are revered particularly in the region of Ohrid. It spread in the first half of the 18th century with the development of Moscopole as a center of Orthodox culture and with the development of the Archbishopric of Ohrid. His name became more popular and reached Mount Athos and even Vienna. The members of the Bektashi order also went on pilgrimage to the monastery of Saint Naum, believing their saint Sarı Saltık to be buried in it. Saint Naum&#x27;s original feast day was December 23, but in 1727 on the authority of the Archbishop of Ohrid, it was changed to June 20.

St. Naum Peak on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica, is named after him.

<text>Aleksandr Yakovlevich Khinchin (, ), July 19, 1894 – November 18, 1959, was a Soviet mathematician and one of the most significant contributors to the Soviet school of probability theory.

Due to romanization conventions, his name is sometimes written as &quot;Khinchin&quot; and other times as &quot;Khintchine&quot;.

==Life and career==
He was born in the village of Kondrovo, Kaluga Governorate, Russian Empire. While studying at Moscow State University, he became one of the first followers of the famous Luzin school. Khinchin graduated from the university in 1916 and six years later he became a full professor there, retaining that position until his death.

Khinchin&#x27;s early works focused on real analysis. Later he applied methods from the metric theory of functions to problems in probability theory and number theory. He became one of the founders of modern probability theory, discovering the law of the iterated logarithm in 1924, achieving important results in the field of limit theorems, giving a definition of a stationary process and laying a foundation for the theory of such processes.

Khinchin made significant contributions to the metric theory of Diophantine approximations and established an important result for simple real continued fractions, discovering a property of such numbers that leads to what is now known as Khinchin&#x27;s constant. He also published several important works on statistical physics, where he used the methods of probability theory, and on information theory, queuing theory and mathematical analysis.

In 1939 Khinchin was elected as a Correspondent Member of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR. He was awarded the USSR State Prize (1941), and the Order of Lenin.

<text>The Cornish rebellion of 1497 (Cornish: &quot;Rebellyans Kernow&quot;), also known as the First Cornish rebellion, was a popular uprising in the Kingdom of England, which began in Cornwall and culminated with the Battle of Deptford Bridge near London on 17 June 1497. 

The insurgent army mainly comprised Cornishmen, although it also gathered support from Devon, Somerset, and other English counties. The rebellion was a response to hardship caused by the raising of war taxes by King Henry VII to finance a campaign against Scotland. Cornwall suffered particularly because the king had recently stopped the legal operation of Cornish tin mining.

The rebellion&#x27;s immediate outcome was military defeat, the execution of its main leaders, and death or other punishment for many of its participants. It may have led Perkin Warbeck, a pretender to the English throne, to choose Cornwall as his base later in the year for another attempt to overthrow Henry VII: an episode known as the Second Cornish uprising of 1497. Eleven years later, however, the king addressed the principal Cornish grievance by allowing tin production to resume legally, with a measure of autonomy.

== Background ==

A series of actions by King Henry VII in late 1496 and early 1497 increased the immediate hardships of many of his subjects, especially in Cornwall.

In 1496, after disagreements regarding new regulations for the tin-mining industry, the king, working partly through the Duchy of Cornwall, suspended the operation and privileges of the Cornish stannaries, a major part of the economy of the county. The privileges, which included exemption from certain royal and local taxes, had been granted by Edward I in 1305. 

Being threatened in 1496–7 with invasion by James IV of Scotland and the pretender Perkin Warbeck, Henry VII levied an extraordinary series of financial demands on his subjects: a forced loan in late 1496, and in early 1497 a double portion of fifteenths and tenths taxation and a special subsidy levy. The burden fell more heavily on Cornwall than most areas, particularly in the collection of the forced loan.

==Rebellion==
===Beginnings in Cornwall===
The first stirrings of protest arose in the parish of St Keverne on the Lizard peninsula, where there already was resentment against the actions of Sir John Oby, provost of Glasney College in Penryn, the tax collector for that area. In reaction to King Henry&#x27;s tax levy, Michael Joseph (An Gof), a blacksmith from St. Keverne and Thomas Flamank, a lawyer of Bodmin, incited many of the people of Cornwall into armed revolt. Flamank formulated the aim of the rebellion as being to remove the two servants of the king seen as responsible for his taxation policies: Cardinal John Morton (the Lord Chancellor) and Sir Reginald Bray (the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster). This emphasis created some room to argue that the uprising was not treasonous, but petitionary in nature. The rebels included at least two former MPs, Flamank (MP for Bodmin in 1492) and William Antron (MP for Helston in 1491–1492).

===March to London===
An army some 15,000 strong marched into Devon, attracting support in the form of provisions and recruits as they went. In Devon, however, support for the rebellion was far lower than in Cornwall, probably because the stannaries there had accepted new regulations in 1494, and had avoided the penalties inflicted on their Cornish counterparts. 

Entering Somerset, the rebel army came to Taunton, where it is reported that they killed one of the commissioners of the subsidy, i.e. a collector of the offending tax. At Wells they were joined by James Touchet, the seventh Baron Audley, who had already been in correspondence with An Gof and Flamank. As a member of the nobility with military experience he was gladly received and acclaimed as their leader. The rebels then continued towards London, marching via Salisbury and Winchester.

===Manoeuvres near London===
King Henry had been preparing for war against Scotland. When he learned of the close approach of the West Country rebels to London, and of their strength, he diverted his main army of 8,000 men under Lord Daubeny to meet them, while a defensive force under the Earl of Surrey was sent to the Scottish border. Daubeny&#x27;s army camped on Hounslow Heath on 13 June. At the same time, there was general alarm among the citizens of London, many of whom mobilised to defend the city. The next day, a detachment of 500 of Daubeny&#x27;s spearmen clashed with the rebels near Guildford.

Until then, the rebel army had met virtually no armed opposition, but neither had they gained significant numbers of new recruits since passing through Somerset. Now instead of approaching London directly they skirted to the south, since Flamank believed they would gain popular support from Kent, on the far side (south-eastern side) of London. Accordingly, after Guildford they moved via Banstead to Blackheath, an area of high ground south-east of the city, which they reached on 16 June. No Kentish uprising had materialised, however. On the contrary, forces of Kentish men had been mobilised against them under loyalist nobles, the Earl of Kent, Lord Abergavenny, and Lord Cobham.

Since the King had now mustered a large army in London, the outlook for the rebels was clearly grim, and there was much dismay and disunity among them that night in their camp on Blackheath. An Gof was adamant in preparing for battle. But many wanted to give themselves up: the original call to arms had not always been to commit the treason of direct warfare against the King, but to make him change his chief advisors and taxation policies. There were thousands of desertions from the insurgency that night.

==Battle of Deptford Bridge==

===Setting and deployments===

The Battle of Deptford Bridge (also known as Battle of Blackheath) took place on 17 June 1497 on a site in present-day Deptford in south-east London, on the River Ravensbourne, and was the culminating event of the Cornish Rebellion. After leaving the West Country and approaching London, the insurgency had failed to attract enough new support or to move quickly enough to catch the king unprepared. The insurgents were now on the defensive. The king had mustered an army of some 25,000 men while the rebels, after late desertions, were down to 10,000 men or fewer. They also lacked the supporting cavalry and artillery arms essential to the professional forces of the time.

The king had spread word that he would attack the rebels on Monday 19 June, but in fact he did so early on the 17th. He regarded Saturday as his &quot;lucky day&quot;. His forces were composed of three battalions, deployed so as to surround the high ground of Blackheath where the rebel army had camped and where its greater part was still positioned.

===Fighting===

The strongest of the king&#x27;s battalions, under Lord Daubeny, attacked along the main road from London. This involved crossing Deptford Bridge (near the point where Ravensbourne River becomes Deptford Creek before joining the river Thames). The rebels were well enough prepared to have positioned guns and archers there, which inflicted severe casualties on the company of spearmen under Sir Humphrey Stanley tasked with securing the bridge. Stanley&#x27;s company nevertheless succeeded in driving off the gunners and archers, killing some of them.

Lord Daubeny now led the attack up into the rebels&#x27; main position on the heath. So bold was his leadership that he became separated, surrounded by the enemy, and temporarily captured. The rebels could have killed him, but actually let him go unhurt. Overwhelmingly outnumbered, surrounded, poorly trained and equipped and lacking cavalry, their fight was now hopeless and their concern was probably to minimise the reprisals that would follow the battle. 

The rebels were routed. Of their leaders, Thomas Flamank and Lord Audley were captured on the field of battle. Michael Joseph (An Gof) fled, apparently to seek sanctuary in the Friars&#x27; Church (near the former palace where the Greenwich Old Royal Naval College now stands), but was intercepted before he could enter.

===Aftermath===

After the battle, the King toured the battlefield, knighting the most valiant of his soldiers, and then returned over London Bridge into the city, where he similarly rewarded a few others, including the mayor, for their services in guarding London and feeding the army. Then he attended an impromptu service of thanksgiving at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

It was proclaimed that soldiers who had taken rebels prisoner could privately ransom them, and keep or sell their possessions.

==Outcomes of the rebellion==

An Gof and Flamank were executed at Tyburn on 27 June 1497. An Gof is recorded to have said before his death (while tied to a hurdle being dragged towards the place of execution) that he should have &quot;a name perpetual and a fame permanent and immortal&quot;. The two of them had been sentenced to be hanged, drawn and quartered. However the king accorded them the mercy of a quicker death, by hanging only, before their bodies were decapitated and quartered. The London Chronicler stated that their heads were set on London Bridge, the quarters of Flamank on four of the city gates, and the quarters of An Gof sent to be displayed at various points in Cornwall and Devon. Two other 16th-century sources (Hall and Polydore Vergil) report that although the king originally planned to have the quartered limbs exhibited in various parts of Cornwall, he was persuaded not to further antagonise the Cornish by doing this.

Audley, as a peer of the realm, was beheaded on 28 June at Tower Hill. His head, in common with those of An Gof and Flamank, was displayed on London Bridge.

In due course, severe monetary penalties, extracted by Crown agents, pauperised sections of Cornwall for years to come. Estates were seized and handed to more loyal subjects. After the phase of punishment, however, in 1508 the king acted to redress the Cornish grievances. He granted a pardon to the tinners for continuing to produce tin in contravention of the Duchy of Cornwall&#x27;s regulations; the regulations themselves were rescinded; and the power of the Cornish Stannary Parliament to approve any regulations in the industry was reinstated. 

==Memorials==

In 1997, a commemorative march named Keskerdh Kernow (Cornish: &quot;Cornwall marches on&quot;) retraced the original route of the Cornish from St. Keverne to Blackheath, London, to celebrate the quincentennial (500th anniversary) of the Cornish Rebellion. A statue depicting the Cornish leaders, &quot;Michael An Gof&quot; and Thomas Flamank, was unveiled at An Gof&#x27;s village of St. Keverne and commemorative plaques were also unveiled at Guildford (a stone memorial on Guild Down at the Mount) and on Blackheath.

The name of Cornwall&#x27;s rugby league team, the Cornish Rebels, was inspired by the Cornish Rebellion of 1497.

In 2017 Peabody Trust/Family Mosaic unveiled a memorial sundial bench to commemorate the battle in Deptford. The memorial was designed and made by London mosaic artist Gary Drostle.

A stone monument commemorating the rebels Thomas Flamank and Michael Joseph is located outside 43 Fore Street in Bodmin.

<text>The Touques () is a small coastal river in Pays d&#x27;Auge in Normandy, France. The Touques is officially navigable up to the Pont des Belges, from its estuary. Its source is in the Perche hills, south of Gacé. The river runs northwards, and flows into the English Channel between the communes of Deauville and Trouville-sur-Mer in North-Western Calvados. Two ports, the Port of Trouville-sur-Mer and Port of Deauville are situated on the river mouth opposite each other.

The Touques was diverted and straightened at the end of the 19th century and the neighbouring swamps dried and built on. Trouville-Deauville station was built on the river&#x27;s former bed.

Trouville&#x27;s harbour dock wall was rebuilt at the end of the 1990s due to erosion of the dock&#x27;s stone wall.

The Touques flows through the following &quot;départements&quot; and towns:

*Orne: Gacé
*Calvados: Lisieux, Pont-l&#x27;Évêque, Touques, Trouville-sur-Mer, Deauville

<doc id="1029753" wikidata="Q16240635" url="?curid=1029753" title="457 plan">
<text>The 457 plan is a type of nonqualified, tax advantaged deferred-compensation retirement plan that is available for governmental and certain nongovernmental employers in the United States. The employer provides the plan and the employee defers compensation into it on a pretax or after-tax (Roth) basis. For the most part, the plan operates similarly to a 401(k) or 403(b) plan with which most people in the US are familiar. The key difference is that unlike with a 401(k) plan, it has no 10% penalty for withdrawal before the age of 55 (59 years, 6 months for IRA accounts) (although the withdrawal is subject to ordinary income taxation). These 457 plans (both governmental and nongovernmental) can also allow independent contractors to participate in the plan, where 401(k) and 403(b) plans cannot.

==Changes with EGTRRA 2001==
The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (EGTRRA) made a number of changes in how governmental 457 plans are treated, the most notable of which is that the coordination of benefits limitation was removed. This allows a person whose employer has a 401(k) or 403(b) and a 457 to defer the maximum contribution amounts to both plans instead of coordinating the total and only being able to meet a single limit amount. Thus, participants can contribute the maximum $19,500 for 2021 into their 401(k) and also the maximum $19,500 into their 457 plan. If they are at least 50 at the end of the current tax year, they can contribute the additional catch-up amount into each plan, also, meaning an additional $6,500 into the 401(k) and another $6,500 into his governmental 457 (catch-up contributions are not provided for nongovernmental 457 plans). The total would then be $52,000 deferred instead of the $26,000 [19,500 + 6,500] that would have been allowed if the coordination of benefits provision had not been repealed in regard to the governmental 457 plan. As a result, many governmental employers have now set up 457 and 401(k) plans for their employees, and nonprofit employers have set up 403(b) and 457 plans, each allowing their employees to invest in both. Some state universities and school districts have access to all three tax-deferred plans. However, the total combined annual contribution to 401(k) and 403(b) plans is subject to the $19,500 limit and $6,500 catch-up limit.

Other notable changes made in the EGTRRA legislation were increasing the maximum deferral amount from the approximately $8,500 that was previously allowed to the same maximum elective deferral amount that 401(k) plans and now 403(b) plans allow, and easing restrictions on some plan rollovers. Governmental 457 plans may be rolled into other types of retirement plans with few restrictions beyond the normal ones for any other type of employer-provided plan, which includes separation of service or disability. This includes other gastro-401(k) and 403(b) plans and also IRAs. IRAs have much greater flexibility in withdrawal and conversion privileges. In contrast, nongovernmental 457 plans can only be rolled into another nongovernmental 457 plan.

==Changes with the Small Business Jobs Act==
The Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 enabled 457(b) plans to include Roth accounts, which were previously only available only in 401(k) and 403(b) plans. This change took effect January 1, 2011. Contributions to Roth accounts are made on an after-tax basis, but distributions of both principal and earnings are generally tax-free.

===Catch-up provisions===
The 457 plan allows for two types of catch-up provisions. The first is similar to other defined contribution plans and amounts to an additional $6,500 that can be contributed as noted above. This option for making catch-up contributions is only available under governmental 457 plans. The second option is much more complicated and is available under both governmental and nongovernmental plans. It can be elected by an employee who is within 3 years of normal retirement age (and perhaps eligible retirement at any age). This second catch-up option is equal to the full employee deferral limit or another $19,500 for 2021. Thus, a person over 50 within 3 years of retirement and who has both a 457 and a 401(k) could defer a total of $66,500 [19,500 + 19,500 for 457 and 19,500 + 8,000 for 401(k)] into his retirement plans by using all of his catch-up provisions. The second type of catch-up provision is limited to unused deferral limits from previous years. An employee who had deferred the maximum amount of money into the 457 plan every year he was employed previously would not be able to use this extra catch-up.

==Governmental and nongovernmental plans==
The two primary types of plans are governmental and nongovernmental. Some governmental plans were under 457(g), but those plans may no longer be created. Most governmental and nongovernmental plans are 457(b) plans.

===Nongovernmental plans===

Nongovernmental 457 plans have a number of restrictions that governmental ones do not. Money deferred into nongovernmental 457 plans may not be rolled into any other type of tax-deferred retirement plan. It may be rolled only into another nongovernmental 457 plan. Also, money deferred into nongovernmental plans is not set aside in a trust for the exclusive benefit of the employee making the deferral. The Internal Revenue Code requires that money in a nongovernmental 457 plan remains the property of the employer and not taxable until time of distribution for specific situations as allowed by the original 457 plan or in cases of withdrawals for emergency cash needed situations. If funds are set aside or provided in a separate account for the employee or in the employee&#x27;s name then that type of 457 plan is not a tax-deferred plan and becomes a nongovernmental 457(b) funded pretax plan.

====457(b) (eligible) plans====
Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) legislation has said that nongovernmental plans must be limited to some group of more highly compensated employees. The level of compensation required is not specified by ERISA, but it must be according to some ascertainable standard that the employer sets. The same highly compensated limit ($125,000 a year for the preceding year of 2019 and $130,000 for the preceding year of 2020 or 2021) in place for 401(k) discrimination testing would likely be acceptable, as would restricting the plan to some class of employees such as directors or officers. Because of this limitation to higher-compensation employees, 457(b) plans are occasionally referred to as &quot;top hat&quot; plans.

====457(f) (ineligible) plans====
IRS code section 457(f) allows for nongovernmental, nonprofit organizations to set up a plan that can be tax deferred and exceed the normal defined contribution employee deferral limit. Ineligible 457 plans are made available because nonprofit organizations are not allowed to have another kind of nonqualified deferred-compensation plan.

Generally, these deferred amounts would be currently taxable under section 83 of the code, unless the employee faces a &quot;substantial risk of forfeiture&quot;, which has been clarified by the IRS to mean that in addition to the money remaining available to general creditors of the organization, it must also be subject to a vesting schedule wherein it will be forfeited if the employee does not stay with the employer for the full vesting period. When the risk of forfeiture is gone, the value of the property given to the employee ceases to be deferred from taxation and is included in current ordinary gross income.

Another plan design, the rabbi trust, gives the employee deferred money in a trust and is funded, but must be available to creditors. This is to make the employer junior to general creditors, so that the employee can avoid current inclusion into income.

These general deferral of current income conditions of section 83 (as explained in revenue ruling 60-31) would give the 457(f) plan the deferral of tax desired.

In 2004, Congress passed a tax act that added Section 409A to the tax code and applies to deferred nonqualified compensation, which also covers some 457(f) plans. This was in response to the executive bonus plans given to key employees at Enron, which allowed them early access to their deferred compensation if financial conditions of the employer deteriorated (&quot;i.e.&quot;, if Enron got into trouble).

<text>The North Fork Toutle River is a tributary of the Toutle River in southwestern Washington in the United States. The river has its headwaters near Spirit Lake, on the north side of Mount St. Helens, and flows to the Toutle River, about upstream of its confluence with the Cowlitz River. The largest tributary is the Green River, which joins near the unincorporated town of Toutle.
The North Fork&#x27;s watershed was severely affected by the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, which coated the valley with ash and filled it with successive mudflows. The result of the eruption was that many hillsides were stripped of forest, and as a result erosion has increased dramatically and the North Fork is now extremely laden with sediment. Previously, Spirit Lake was the source of the river, but eruptions blocked the outlet and Spirit Lake no longer drains directly into the North Fork; instead, a tunnel was excavated in 1985 to connect the lake with South Coldwater Creek, a tributary of the North Fork. Once a mature river, the North Fork has transformed into a braided stream of relatively young origin, and its valley floor is less than three decades old. The Toutle River Sediment Retention Structure was built by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on the river in 1989 to prevent this sediment from traveling downstream and clogging the shipping channel of the Columbia River.

The upper part of the North Fork Toutle River watershed was redirected to the crater of Mount St. Helens itself until 1982. The river&#x27;s headstreams begin on a volcanic ash deposit roughly long and deep, which is the source of much of the excess sediment.

<doc id="1029755" wikidata="Q7556077" url="?curid=1029755" title="Solar azimuth angle">
<text>The solar azimuth angle is the azimuth (horizontal angle with respect to north) of the Sun&#x27;s position. This horizontal coordinate defines the Sun&#x27;s relative direction along the local horizon, whereas the solar zenith angle (or its complementary angle solar elevation) defines the Sun&#x27;s apparent altitude.

==Conventional sign and origin==
There are several conventions for the solar azimuth; however, it is traditionally defined as the angle between a line due south and the shadow cast by a vertical rod on Earth. This convention states the angle is positive if the shadow is east of south and negative if it is west of south. For example, due east would be 90° and due west would be -90°. Another convention is the reverse; it also has the origin at due south, but measures angles clockwise, so that due east is now negative and west now positive.

However, despite tradition, the most commonly accepted convention for analyzing solar irradiation, e.g. for solar energy applications, is clockwise from due north, so east is 90°, south is 180°, and west is 270°. This is the definition used by NREL in their solar position calculators and is also the convention used in the formulas presented here. However, Landsat photos and other USGS products, while also defining azimuthal angles relative to due north, take counterclockwise angles as negative.

==Conventional Trigonometric Formulas==
The following formulas assume the north-clockwise convention. The solar azimuth angle can be calculated to a good approximation with the following formula, however angles should be interpreted with care because the inverse sine, i.e. or , has multiple solutions, only one of which will be correct.
:formula_1

The following formulas can also be used to approximate the solar azimuth angle, but these formulas use cosine, so the azimuth angle as shown by a calculator will always be positive, and should be interpreted as the angle between zero and 180 degrees when the hour angle, , is negative (morning) and the angle between 180 and 360 degrees when the hour angle, , is positive (afternoon). (These two formulas are equivalent if one assumes the &quot;solar elevation angle&quot; approximation formula).

:formula_2

So practically speaking, the compass azimuth which is the practical value used everywhere (in example in airlines as the so called course) on a compass (where North is 0 degrees, East is 90 degrees, South is 180 degrees and West is 270 degrees) can be calculated as 

:formula_3

The formulas use the following terminology:
*formula_4 is the solar azimuth angle
*formula_5 is the solar zenith angle
*formula_6 is the hour angle, in the local solar time
*formula_7 is the current sun declination
*formula_8 is the local latitude

In addition, dividing the above sine formula by the first cosine formula gives one the tangent formula as is used in &quot;The Nautical Almanac&quot;.

== The formula based on the &quot;subsolar point&quot; and the atan2 function==
A 2021 publication presents a method that uses a solar azimuth formula based on the subsolar point and the atan2 function, as defined in Fortran 90, that gives an unambiguous solution without the need for circumstantial treatment. The subsolar point is the point on the surface of the Earth where the Sun is overhead.

The method first calculates the declination of the Sun and equation of time using equations from The Astronomical Almanac, then it gives the x-, y- and z-components of the unit vector pointing toward the Sun, through vector analysis rather than spherical trigonometry, as follows:

:formula_9

where

*formula_7 is the declination of the Sun,
*formula_11 is the latitude of the subsolar point,
*formula_12 is the longitude of the subsolar point, 
*formula_13 is the Greenwich Mean Time or UTC,
*formula_14 is the equation of time in minutes, 
*formula_15 is the latitude of the observer, 
*formula_16 is the longitude of the observer, 
*formula_17 are the x-, y- and z-components, respectively, of the unit vector pointing toward the Sun. The x-, y- and z-axises of the coordinate system point to East, North and upward, respectively. 

It can be shown that formula_18. With the above mathematical setup, the solar zenith angle and solar azimuth angle are simply

:formula_19, 
:formula_20. (South-Clockwise Convention)

where
*formula_21 is the solar zenith angle,
*formula_22 is the solar azimuth angle following the South-Clockwise Convention.

If one prefers North-Clockwise Convention, or East-Counterclockwise Convention, the formulas are

:formula_23, (North-Clockwise Convention)
:formula_24. (East-Counterclockwise Convention)

Finally, the values of formula_25, formula_26 and formula_27 at 1-hour step for an entire year can be presented in a 3D plot of &quot;wreath of analemmas&quot; as a graphic depiction of all possible positions of the Sun in terms of solar zenith angle and solar azimuth angle for any given location. Refer to sun path for similar plots for other locations.

<text>The Beijing central business district, or Beijing CBD (), is a central business district and the primary area for finance, media, and business services in Beijing, China.

Beijing CBD occupies 3.99 km2 of the Chaoyang District on the east side of the city. Geographically situated to the east of the city center, sandwiched between the 3rd Ring Road and the 4th Ring Road, the Beijing CBD is currently undergoing large-scale development.

==Economic history and importance==
As Beijing is becoming one of the most important international financial centers in China, Beijing CBD was recently positioned as the secondary core area in Beijing&#x27;s International Financial Center Development strategic plan published in May, 2008. Beijing CBD is also emerging as China&#x27;s media center as Beijing Television Station (BTV) just moved in its new headquarters (Beijing TV Centre) in this area and the new CCTV Headquarters was officially opened on the night of 15 June 2008.

In the eight years since the government decided to speed up construction of the district, the Beijing CBD has attracted 117 Fortune 500 businesses in the financial, media, information technology, consulting and service industries. More than 60 percent of overseas-funded companies in Beijing are in the CBD. A majority of foreign embassies in Beijing - the No 1, No 2 and No 3 embassy districts are now concentrated in the Beijing CBD and its neighboring areas.

The Beijing CBD Administrative Committee, established in 2001, is in charge of planning and management and aims to facilitate investments and improve the work environment for professionals. The committee provides information to investors on laws, taxes and state policies as well as a one-stop service, which has simplified approval procedures and raised efficiency.

The establishment of the Beijing CBD Chamber of Finance, the Beijing CBD Chamber of Media Industry and Beijing CBD Association of Property Management &amp; Real Estate Development has facilitated communication and cooperation between the government and enterprises. The Beijing CBD International Business Festival and Beijing CBD International Forum have put the Beijing CBD on the map worldwide.

<text>Denver, formerly known as Dry Pond, is a census-designated place and unincorporated community in Lincoln County, North Carolina, United States. As of the 2010 census it had a population of 2,309.

Known as “Dry Pond” until 1873, it was renamed “Denver” (after the capital of the then territory of Colorado) as a marketing and growth strategy directed towards the emerging railroad industry. The name change was championed by D. Matt Thompson, a local principal. The town was incorporated as such from 1877 until 1971, when the town lost its charter and was reincorporated back into Lincoln County.

==Geography==
Denver is situated on North Carolina State Highway 16, west of Lake Norman. It is about north of downtown Charlotte and southeast of Newton. Denver&#x27;s northern border is the Catawba County line.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Denver CDP has a total area of , of which , or 0.14%, are water.

Denver&#x27;s ZIP code is 28037. The elevation is above sea level.

==Demographics==

The census of 2000 for Denver&#x27;s zip code 28037 shows a total population of 13,030 with a median age of 41 years. The racial makeup was 83.9% White, 5.8% African American, and 1.5% other races. There were 5,052 households, 77.5% being family households. The average household size was 2.56 people. 82.9% of the residents had a high school education or higher, and 20.4% had a Bachelor&#x27;s Degree or higher.

70.7% of residents over 16 were employed, with 84.7% of those commuting to work alone in a vehicle. The largest employers were Manufacturing at 20.2%, &#x27;Transportation and warehousing, and utilities&#x27; at 11.6%, and Construction at 10.0%. The median household income was $52,304. 3.7% of families were below the poverty line. The median house value was $162,000 with 75.8% having a mortgage, contract to purchase, or similar debt.

==History==
===Period of foundation===
The community of Dry Pond derived its name from a small pond, which once stood at what is now the corner of Highway 16 Business and Campground Road, now the site of the local First Federal branch. The pond would dry up in the heat of summer months.

===18th century===
Adam Sherrill and his family first settled in the area in 1747, and they were followed by John Beatty two years later. The actual location of Denver was first settled around 1770. People of Scotch-Irish and German descent from Pennsylvania, were among the first white settlers. Most of the early Scotch Irish were Presbyterians, and their first place of worship in what would become the Denver area was John Beatty&#x27;s house, which was located about one mile west of Beatty&#x27;s Ford, near the present-day Triangle community. Now known as Unity Presbyterian, the first meetinghouse for this congregation was originally built of logs. In 1808, it was decided to erect a larger building, and a plot of several acres was conveyed for the purpose by James Little to &quot;James Connor, Alexander Brevard, John Reid and Joseph Graham, trustees.&quot; Dr Humphrey Hunter, a native of Ireland and a soldier in the American Revolutionary War, was pastor from 1796 to 1804. Next came Rev. Henry N. Pharr. He was succeeded by Patrick Sparrow, whose father was a potter at Vesuvius furnace, part of the Graham family&#x27;s local iron industry. Sparrow was the first professor of languages at Davidson College, and afterwards president of Hampden–Sydney College in Virginia. A long-time minister at Unity was Robert Hall Morrison, who was first president of Davidson College.

The Presbyterians were soon joined by early Methodists from Maryland, who initially took up residence near what is now Terrell. Longtime leaders of the Methodists in the region were Rev. Daniel Asbury and Rev. Jeremiah Munday, pioneer Methodist ministers. When he was younger, Asbury traveled to Kentucky with some family members (among them the Callaways) and, along with their leader Daniel Boone, he and approximately 20 people were taken hostage by a band of Shawnee. They were carried to the far northwest (present-day Ohio) and held in captivity for five years. Asbury later was traded to the British in what is now Detroit, and returned to his home in Virginia. In 1791, Asbury established in Lincoln County the first Methodist church west of the Catawba River, which is now known as Bethel United Methodist Church. Rev. Jeremiah Mundy was a native of Virginia and came to Lincoln County in 1799. He was a soldier in the Revolutionary War three years and a minister for 35 years. These Methodists brought with them the institution of &quot;camp meeting&quot;, which quickly became one of the most important traditions for the region. Interdenominational from the beginning, the local Rock Springs Camp Meeting grows out of these early meetings and traces its history to 1794, when Daniel Asbury, William McKendree (who would become a bishop), William Fulwood and James Hall, a Presbyterian, held the first gathering near present-day Rehobeth Church in Terrell.

===Native Americans===

Most of the land that these Europeans claimed had long been the home of the Catawba and Cherokee people. The Catawba River in this part of North Carolina acted as a border between the two nations, who were often at odds with each other. In the earliest days of European settlement, there were episodes of violence between the Native Americans and the new settlers, and eventually a fort was constructed near present-day Statesville to help provide a level of defense for the western portion of the colony.

===General William Lee Davidson===

On February 1, 1781, British forces under the command of Lt. General Cornwallis clashed with North Carolina troops led by Brig. Gen. William Lee Davidson at Cowan&#x27;s Ford, the southernmost limit of present-day Denver. The British were pursuing Nathanael Greene&#x27;s forces following the Patriot victory at Cowpens, South Carolina, and Davidson&#x27;s troops had been sent to stall and harass his advance. With Davidson was Captain Joseph Graham, a local, who had raised 56 cavalrymen. He had promised that those who furnished their own horses and equipment and served six weeks would be considered as having served a tour of three months.

Local blacksmiths made 45 rough swords for the new mounted troops. Only fifteen of Graham&#x27;s troops had pistols, but all had rifles, not the ideal weapon for horseback fighting. Davidson, charged with guarding four of the Catawba River crossings, had sent 500 troops to Beattie&#x27;s Ford, keeping only 25 at Cowan&#x27;s. But the river was high and Cornwallis did not have access to his heavy guns. Led by a local Tory guide, Frederick Hager, the British began to cross the river early as the Americans were still sleeping. The sentry was not alerted until Cornwallis&#x27; troops were within 100 yards of the shore. The battle began, and the strong current was on the American&#x27;s side. Greatly outnumbered, the local forces were able to hold their own, slowly falling back into the woods while returning fire. The British finally took the ford and advanced. General Davidson was shot, and the militia, seeing this, fled. Major Graham&#x27;s cavalry covered their retreat. The battle had helped a larger force under the command of Daniel Morgan reach the Yadkin River unopposed. It is said that Frederick Hager was the man who shot the gun that killed General Davidson.

===19th century===

Most of the early settlers were subsistence farmers who relied heavily upon hunting to supplement their tables. Grist mills and saw mills were among the first local industries, but the production of iron soon became the biggest industry for the area. By 1810, Lincoln County boasted six ironmaking operations, including Vesuvius, Mt. Welcome, Mount Tirzah, Mount Carmel, High Shoals, and Madison. A number of individuals and partners took the lead in establishing ironworks in eastern Lincoln County, most just to the west of present-day Denver, near Pumpkin Center and in the direction of Iron Station. The partnership of Peter Forney, Joseph Graham, John Davidson, and Alexander Brevard was responsible for the construction of Vesuvius Furnace in 1795. Peter Forney built Madison Iron Furnace along Leeper&#x27;s Creek in 1809. These two sites, like other local ironworks, changed hands at various points. Other individuals involved in the development of the iron industry in Lincoln County include Turner Abernethy, John Fulenwider, Dr. William Johnston, Jonas W. Derr, and J.F. Reinhardt. James Madison Smith later erected Stonewall Furnace in 1862 to help meet the demand for iron brought on by the Civil War. Operations at Rehoboth (begun in the 1820s) and Madison furnaces also resumed during the turbulent years from 1862 to 1865 to supply much-needed iron for the Southern war effort.

===Dry Pond===
There was a Dry Pond Post Office beginning right before the Civil War, although it moved across the line to Catawba County near what is now Kiestler&#x27;s Store Road in December 1868. In 1873, in an attempt to attract a railroad spur and thinking that the moniker &quot;Dry Pond&quot; didn&#x27;t present a nice enough image for the railroad planners, headmaster of the local Rock Springs Academy, D. Matt Thompson, led the effort to have Dry Pond renamed for the capital of Colorado, which was just then petitioning for statehood.

In the years before the Civil War, North Carolina&#x27;s wealthy class in need of a break from the summer heat, could escape to Lincoln County&#x27;s Catawba Springs resort. The popular antebellum destination, named for the Catawba people formerly living in the area, was built amidst seven mineral springs near Denver. Guests vacationed there as early as the 1790s. In 1824, geology professor Denison Olmstead recommended the waters of the springs for complaints concerning the liver and weakness. There is little evidence that healing actually occurred; nonetheless Catawba Springs became a popular stop on the stagecoach lines from Salisbury to Asheville.

Revolutionary War veteran and state legislator Captain John Reid was the first known proprietor of Catawba Springs. After his death in 1821, the spa passed through a series of owners: Charles Jugnot, William Simonton, and Joseph Hampton. In 1838, Hampton renovated and expanded Catawba Springs, including the construction of a two-story, 100-room hotel. After the renovation, during parties and on holidays, as many as 500 guests assembled on the porch of the hotel. Before that time, the spa could only accommodate sixty to seventy guests in its cabins. Most guests were members of the southern planter class from North and South Carolina. Among the names of prominent North Carolina families listed in the hotel records are the Grahams, Brevards, Alexanders, Caldwells, Davidsons, and Polks. Some guests made their way to the spa from Mississippi, Alabama, and Louisiana. Students from nearby Davidson College could also be found enjoying themselves there on the weekends. During the early 1840s, Peter S. Ney ran a school for boys at the resort known as Stewart&#x27;s Seminary.

===American Civil War===
During the Civil War, the local area raised two units for the Confederacy. In March 1862, a group of local men, most of whom were related, formed a company known as the &quot;Dry Pond Dixies&quot; (Company G, 52nd regiment of North Carolina Troops) and joined the Confederacy. Added to their number were a number of Quakers from Randolph County, who did not fight but tended the wounded. The second group was known as the Beatty&#x27;s Ford Rifles (Company K 23rd Regiment).

The Civil War put an end to the southern planter aristocracy, and with its patron base depleted, Catawba Springs closed in the mid-1860s. As North Carolina recovered from the war, railways and eventually good highways, led to the opening of mountain resorts. A similar, but unrelated, resort operated under the name &quot;Sparkling Catawba Springs&quot; in Catawba County during the latter part of the 19th and early 20th century. The buildings were demolished in 1930, and the springs now bubble invisibly into a farm pond. A faint, lingering scent of sulfur is all that remains.

===Town incorporation===
In October 1874, Denver&#x27;s first postmaster, John A. Kids, was appointed. Mail to the Catawba Springs post office was transferred to the Denver post office the next year. Two years later, the community was incorporated as a town by the state of North Carolina. Unfortunately for the citizens of the area, the railroad chose not to run through the growing small town, and it began to dry up like the pond for which it was originally named.

For much of its existence, &quot;downtown&quot; consisted of a few houses, a handful of stores, a couple of churches, a school, a barber shop, a post office, a bank, and a cotton gin. The 1902 Soil Survey map of the Hickory, North Carolina area, shows Denver having a small grid of streets running along what are now Highway 16 Business and Campground Road. By 1914, the soil survey map of Lincoln County showed only a grid of three short streets running northwest to southeast parallel to what is now Highway 16 Business and one street running parallel to Campground Road (which still exists and was called by locals for many years &quot;Back Street&quot;). Apparently, one of the short streets perpendicular to Campground Road ran beside what is now the telephone building on St. James Church Road, and another of these perpendicular streets connected to what is now Campground Road right at the Rock Springs Campground. Another part of the &quot;street grid&quot; for Denver was Cemetery Road. It ran beside Denver United Methodist Church and was perpendicular to Highway 16, then turned in front of the community cemetery and intersected with Campground Road. The portion that ran beside the church and perpendicular to the highway was &quot;graded under&quot; by the church in the late 1990s.

For a brief period during the 1890s–1910s, Denver was home to small-scale gold prospecting, particularly in the area near the former Triangle School and the community now known as Westport.

===20th century to present===

Denver remained largely a farming community, with cotton as the primary cash crop supplemented by &quot;truck farming&quot; vegetables to area towns (with tomatoes and strawberries being among the most often marketed vegetable crops). Members of local families began commuting to work in textile mills in the surrounding communities of Mooresville, Lincolnton, Cornelius, Maiden, and Mount Holly just before World War II, and continued up until the early 1970s. Having failed to elect a local government for many years, Denver lost its official incorporated status in 1971 by vote of the state legislature.

It was the filling of a much larger pond, Lake Norman, that led Denver to grow in ways that its early boosters probably could have never fathomed. In 1962, Duke Power built the Cowans Ford Dam, flooding the fertile farmland along the Catawba River &quot;bottoms&quot;, the land which had attracted the area&#x27;s first settlers. Soon, weekend and summer &quot;getaway&quot; homes began to appear lakeside, and after a few years, these were replaced by more luxurious lake homes, as individuals began to move to the area to live near the water. Denver is now largely a bedroom community for Charlotte, which is to the south.

One of Denver&#x27;s major features is its &quot;main street&quot;, which is now known as Old Highway 16. This road, once State Highway 16, was one of North Carolina&#x27;s first state highways, receiving that designation in 1928. Present-day Highway 16 is a four-lane road running along the southwest edge of the community.

During the 1970s, the town hosted one of the largest cross-country motorcycle races in the nation, the &quot;Denver 100&quot;, which was a successful fundraiser for the local volunteer fire department. Participants rode through the center of barns, along creek banks, and through pastures—most of which have now disappeared under various housing developments.

Up until recently, most African Americans in the area lived in the community known as &quot;Little Egypt&quot;, which is the general area near East Lincoln High School along Saint James Church Road.

Denver is home to the Rock Springs Campground that has been the site of revivals and camp meetings since 1794.

Major local industries included modular home builder R-Anell Homes, which recently moved from Denver to a manufacturing facility in Cherryville.

===National Register of Historic Places===
The William A. Graham Jr. Farm, Munday House, and Rock Springs Camp Meeting Ground are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Transportation==

*NC 16 – There are two NC 16&#x27;s that go from northwest to southeast in Denver. The NC 16 going through town is referred to by locals as &quot;Old 16&quot; or &quot;16 Business&quot;, while the outer route has higher speed limits and is known as &quot;New 16&quot; or &quot;16 Bypass&quot;.
*NC 150 – This highway intersects NC 150 at the northwest corner of Denver and leads to Mooresville to the east and Maiden and Lincolnton to the west.

==Parks==

*Beatty&#x27;s Ford Park (includes boat access for Lake Norman) – This park includes a picnic shelter, restrooms, disc golf, a walking trail, a volleyball court, horseshoe pits, a splash pad area during summer months, two children&#x27;s playgrounds, and an outdoor fireplace.

==Education==
Rock Springs Academy, one of the original schools in the community, evolved into Rock Springs School, which was a comprehensive 1–12 school until nearby East Lincoln High School was built in 1967. At that time, Rock Springs became an elementary school. The original mascot for Rocks Springs was &quot;The Warriors&quot;, and the school colors were black and gold; in the 1990s, this was changed to &quot;sailors&quot;. The mascot for East Lincoln High School is &quot;The Mustangs&quot;, and the school colors are orange and green with the hues changing slightly over the years. The spring for which the academy was named lies near the Rock Springs Campground on Campground Road.

<text>Haig–Simons income or Schanz–Haig–Simons income is an income measure used by public finance economists to analyze economic well-being which defines income as consumption plus change in net worth. It is represented by the mathematical formula:

:I = &quot;C&quot; + Δ&quot;NW&quot;

where &quot;C&quot; = consumption and Δ&quot;NW&quot; = change in net worth.

Consumption refers to the money spent on goods and services of any kind. From a perfect theory view, consumption does not include capital expenditures, and the full spending would be amortized.

==History==

The measure of the income tax base equal to the sum of consumption and change in net worth was first advocated by German legal scholar Georg von Schanz. His concept was further developed by the American economists Robert M. Haig and Henry C. Simons in the 1920s and 1930s.

Haig defined personal income as &quot;the money value of the net accretion to one&#x27;s economic power between two points of time,&quot; a formulation that was intended to include the taxpayer&#x27;s consumption.

That was thought by Simons to be interchangeable with his own formulation:
:&quot;Personal income may be defined as &quot;the algebraic sum of (1) the market value of rights exercised in consumption and (2) the change in the value of the store of property rights between the beginning and end of the period in question.&quot;

In this concept, all inflows and outflows of resources are considered taxable income in a broad sense, including donations and windfall gains.

==Schanz–Haig–Simons income tax vs. cash-flow consumption tax==

A cash-flow consumption tax is intended to confine the cash-flow tax burden to an individual&#x27;s annual consumption and to remove nonconsumption expenses and current savings from the tax base. The base is calculated by combining the year&#x27;s gross receipts and savings withdrawals, and then subtracting the year&#x27;s business and investment expenses and the year&#x27;s additions to savings. Progressive rates are applied to the resulting sum.

By contrast, the base for a theoretically correct Schanz–Haig–Simons (SHS) income tax is each individual&#x27;s annual consumption plus current additions to savings. Thus current receipts that are otherwise taxable remain in the tax base, even if they are saved, and withdrawals from earlier savings are not currently taxed since they were assessed in a prior year. Stated differently, the SHS tax base has two components—current consumption and current savings (including current appreciation accruing to earlier investments)—whereas a cash-flow consumption tax has only a single component—current consumption.

In spite of their differences, however, both a cash-flow consumption tax and an SHS tax require that dollars paid out as business or investment expenses be eliminated from the base. This is necessary under a cash-flow consumption tax because business and investment expenses are not consumption and it is necessary under an SHS tax because these expenditures are neither consumption nor additions to savings. Since business and investment outlays have no place in the base of either tax, intuition suggests that business and investment interest expenses would be treated identically under a cash-flow consumption tax and an SHS tax. But they are not. The SHS tax and the cash-flow consumption tax take different structural approaches to the treatment of business and investment interest outlays although both systems share the general objective of removing current business and investment costs from the tax base.

==Tax on Haig–Simons income==

===Tax on change in wealth===
The Haig–Simons equation is different from the USA&#x27;s individual income tax base calculations. For example, any employer contributions to employee health insurance are not included in taxable employee income. Under the Haig–Simons definition of income, such contributions would be included in income. Such contributions might not be included in a Haig–Simons income tax base, however, if their exclusion reflected &quot;an appropriate adjustment in measuring ability to pay.&quot;

===Tax on consumption===
The European Union and most states in the USA employ a tax on Haig–Simons income with a consumption tax. In the European Union, a value added tax applies to purchases of goods and services on each level of exchange until it reaches the ultimate consumer. In the US, most states tax purchases of goods with a sales tax.

==Criticisms of the definition==

Some argue that the definition is tautological:
*it is &quot;little more than an accounting identity, a tautology: it tells us only that all income is either spent [consumption] or not [savings], which is obvious enough&quot;.

Others observe that it is &quot;only a surrogate utility measure.&quot;

Some fault it for neutrality between savings and consumption.

Some scholars resist these criticisms, to the extent they conceive of Haig–Simons as dependent on utility; Simons rejected utility as the basis of the ability-to-pay standard. Indeed, Simons rejected both the notion that humans are &quot;equally efficient pleasure machines,&quot; and the idea that taxation can take account of interpersonal utilities. Simons sought a measurable definition for income, but his solution is open to criticism for reifying troubling dichotomies; for example, the Haig–Simons definition depends on the distinction between market and non-market values.

<doc id="1029768" wikidata="Q7893533" url="?curid=1029768" title="United States v. X-Citement Video, Inc.">
<text>United States v. X-Citement Video, Inc., 513 U.S. 64 (1994), was a federal criminal prosecution filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California in Los Angeles against X-Citement Video and its owner, Rubin Gottesman, on three charges of trafficking in child pornography, specifically videos featuring the underaged Traci Lords. In 1989, a federal judge found Gottesman guilty and later sentenced him to one year in jail and a $100,000 fine.

The defense challenged the constitutionality of certain sections of the federal laws against child pornography, claiming they were unconstitutionally vague. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit agreed and reversed the district decision in 1992.
The case was appealed again to the Supreme Court, which, in turn, by a 7-2 vote, reversed the ruling of the Ninth Circuit on November 29, 1994, because the relevant sections could be interpreted in a way that is constitutional.

==Background==
In 1986, federal and local authorities discovered that actress Traci Lords had made pornographic movies while she was underage. This incident formed the basis of several actions against people working in the pornography industry.

Rubin Gottesman owned X-Citement Video. In June 1986 he was visited by Los Angeles Police Officer Steven Takeshita and FBI Agent Nellie Magdaloyo. They posed as pornography retailers who wanted to buy videos from him. They made several more visits that year, culminating in Gottesman sending Lords videos to Hawaii in early 1987. In the course of the investigation, they witnessed Gottesman giving acknowledgement of prior knowledge that Lords was underage during the making of those movies.

==Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling==
The Ninth Circuit ruled that the sections in the Protection of Children Against Sexual Exploitation Act of 1977 dealing with the interstate transportation of underage pornography is unconstitutional. Part of the relevant provision states:

&quot;(a) Any person who:&quot;
&quot;(1) knowingly transports or ships in interstate or foreign commerce by any means, including by computer or mails, any visual depiction, if&quot;
:&quot;(A) the producing of such visual depiction involves the use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct and&quot;
:&quot;(B) such visual depiction is of such conduct;&quot;
&quot;shall be punished as provided in subsection (b) of this section.&quot;

The defense asserted that the word &quot;knowingly&quot; in section (1), judging from the grammar, did not extend to the conduct described in subsection (A) or (B).

If interpreted this way, the result would be that anybody buying or selling movies without knowing their content might be held criminally liable. This was the basis for the Ninth Circuit Court finding the law in violation of the First Amendment.

==Supreme Court==
The decision was appealed to the United States Supreme Court. With a majority of 7–2, they ruled to reverse the decision of the Ninth Circuit and uphold the criminal conviction.

They explained that if a law can be interpreted in a way that is constitutional, then that interpretation must be used rather than declaring the law unconstitutional. In effect, they made the word &quot;knowingly&quot; extend to the other clauses.

Justice Antonin Scalia filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justice Clarence Thomas joined. In Scalia&#x27;s dissent, he acknowledged this rule but only in cases where the new interpretation does not need an ungrammatical reading of the statute.

Gottesman was incarcerated at the Federal Medical Center, Fort Worth, Texas and released on June 20, 1997.
