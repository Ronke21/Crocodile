<text>Damian Robert Nesta “Jr. Gong” Marley (born 21 July 1978) is a Jamaican reggae musician. The second youngest child of Bob Marley, he is the recipient of four Grammy Awards.

==Early life, education and family==
Marley is the youngest son of legendary reggae singer Bob Marley. He is the only child born to Marley and Cindy Breakspeare, a Jamaican jazz singer and crowned Miss World 1976. Like several of Bob&#x27;s children, Damian was born out of wedlock and outside of Bob&#x27;s marriage to singer Rita Marley. After seeing the film &quot;Damien - Omen II&quot;, which is about the coming of the Antichrist, one of Bob&#x27;s last requests in Germany was to have Damian&#x27;s name changed. &quot;Damien being a devil...It was inappropriate for him as a Rastafarian to have a child with that name,&quot; Bob said and Damian&#x27;s name was later changed.

Damian was two years old when his father died. His nickname &quot;Junior Gong&quot; is derived from his father&#x27;s nickname of &quot;Tuff Gong&quot;.

==Career==
===Early releases (1992–2004)===
At the age of 13, Marley formed a musical group by the name of the Shephards, which included the daughter of Freddie McGregor and son of Third World&#x27;s Cat Coore. The group opened the 1992 Reggae Sunsplash festival.
The band fell apart in the early 1990s, and Damian started his solo career.

With the backing of his father&#x27;s label, Tuff Gong, he released his 1996 debut album &quot;Mr. Marley&quot;, which surprised many who were unaccustomed to hearing a Marley deejaying rather than singing.
Marley released his second studio album &quot;Halfway Tree&quot;. The name &quot;Halfway Tree&quot; comes from his mother Cindy Breakspeare being from the rich part of town, and his father Bob Marley coming from the poor part of town, thus him being &quot;a tree halfway in between the &#x27;rich&#x27; world and &#x27;poor&#x27; world.&quot; Additionally, Halfway Tree is a well-known landmark that marks the cultural center of Half-Way-Tree, the clock tower that stands where the historical eponymous cotton tree once stood is featured prominently behind Marley on the cover of the album. The album was released on 11 September 2001 and received the 2002 Grammy Award for Best Reggae Album. It was co-produced by Damian Marley and his brother Stephen Marley, who had also produced Damian&#x27;s debut album &quot;Mr. Marley&quot;.

===&quot;Welcome to Jamrock&quot; (2005)===

Marley released his third studio album &quot;Welcome to Jamrock&quot; which was released on 12 September 2005 in the United States and 13 September 2005 in the United Kingdom. The album sold 86,000 copies in its first week of release, and was eventually certified gold after selling 500,000 copies in the United States. 

Damian&#x27;s half-brother, Stephen Marley, was a producer and co-writer of the hugely successful song of the same name. The lyrics to the single &quot;Welcome to Jamrock&quot;, which was performed over a riddim produced by Sly and Robbie for Ini Kamoze some 20 years earlier, centered around poverty, politics and crime in Jamaica. While the single was controversial at home over its perceived negative viewpoint of the island, many praised the content of the song. Dr Clinton Hutton, professor at the University of the West Indies, said of the single: &quot;&#x27;Jamrock&#x27; uses the icon of the inner city, of alienation, of despair, of prejudice, but of hope, of Jamaican identity, to remind us of the fire of frustration, the fire of creativity, the fire of warning to open up our eyes and look within to the life we are living. And still some of us don&#x27;t want to hear and to look and say enough is enough.&quot; The single reached number 13 on the UK Singles Chart and number 55 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. It was also number 100 on the Top 100 Songs of the Decade listing by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;.

Other notable singles from the album include &quot;The Master Has Come Back&quot;, &quot;Road to Zion&quot; featuring Nas, and &quot;Khaki Suit&quot; featuring Bounty Killer and Eek-A-Mouse.

===&quot;Distant Relatives&quot; (2006–2010)===

At the 2006 Grammy Awards, he won Best Reggae Album and Best Urban/Alternative Performance for &quot;Welcome to Jamrock&quot;. He is the only Jamaican reggae artist in history to win two Grammy Awards on the same night. He is also the only reggae artist to win in the Best Urban/Alternative Performance category at the Grammy Awards.
In 2008, he made an appearance on singer Mariah Carey&#x27;s &quot;E=MC²&quot; album as a featured artist on the album track &quot;Cruise Control&quot;. At the 2009 Grammy Awards news of a collaborative album between Marley and Nas was announced, when Nas told MTV reporters &quot;Right now, I&#x27;ll tell you first, I&#x27;m working on an album with Damian Marley. We tryin&#x27; to build some schools in Africa with this one, and trying to build empowerment. We&#x27;re tryin&#x27; to show love and stuff with this album. So, the record&#x27;s ... all about really the &#x27;hood and Africa also as well.&quot;

On 17 May 2010, Marley released &quot;Distant Relatives&quot;, a collaborative album with Nas. The album title refers not only to the bond between the artists but the connection to their African ancestry, which inspired the album both musically and lyrically. They have previously collaborated on &quot;Road to Zion&quot;, on Marley&#x27;s &quot;Welcome to Jamrock&quot; album. The album joins two different flavours of music with Marley&#x27;s dub-rock aesthetic and Nas&#x27; flow. Damian and Stephen produced much of the album. The proceeds of this album will go to building schools in the Congo.

The album debuted at number five on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart with first-week sales of 57,000 copies. It serves as Nas&#x27;s tenth top-ten album and Marley&#x27;s second top-ten album in the United States. The album also entered at number four on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Digital Albums, and at number one on its R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums, Rap Albums, and Reggae Albums charts.
Internationally, &quot;Distant Relatives&quot; attained some chart success. It entered at number 33 on the European Top 100 Albums chart. In the United Kingdom, it debuted at number 30 on the UK Albums Chart and at number four on the R&amp;B Albums Chart. In Canada, the album entered at number 9 on the Top 100 Albums chart. In Germany, it debuted at number 38 on the Media Control Charts.
The first single, &quot;As We Enter&quot;, was released on iTunes on 23 February 2010. It peaked at number 10 on the iTunes Hip Hop/Rap charts and number 41 on the iTunes Music charts. The single debuted at number 39 on the UK Singles Chart.
At a sold-out panel discussion on the African diaspora and its relation to music, sponsored by National Geographic, Damian and Stephen Marley and Nas were among the several hip-hop and reggae musicians voicing their solidarity. The discussion focused on the collaborations between artists of the two genres, and highlighted the &quot;Distant Relatives&quot; project.

===&quot;SuperHeavy&quot; (2011–2015)===
The existence of SuperHeavy was secret until May 2011. Mick Jagger, English musician and the lead vocalist of rock band The Rolling Stones, announced its formation on 20 May 2011. SuperHeavy was Dave Stewart&#x27;s idea. Inspired by the sounds washing into his home in Saint Ann&#x27;s Bay, Jamaica, Stewart urged Jagger to fuse their sound with that of Indian orchestras. Stewart and Jagger had mutual liking for Indian orchestrations; thus, A. R. Rahman was added to the supergroup, as well as British singer Joss Stone. The name of the band is said to be inspired by Muhammad Ali.
The group began recording their self-titled debut album in early 2009 at a studio in Los Angeles. They recorded about 35 hours of music. The album was previewed at Jim Henson Studios, Los Angeles, on 30 June 2011. The band played eight of the recorded songs at the event.

&quot;Miracle Worker&quot; was released on iTunes as the album&#x27;s lead single on 7 July 2011. It is a reggae song performed by Marley, Stone and Jagger. The single entered at number 195 on the UK Singles Chart. The music video was released on YouTube on 12 August 2011. Directed by Stewart and filmed at Paramount Studios in Los Angeles, the video features all five members of the band.
&quot;Satyameva Jayathe&quot; (the national motto of India, which literally translates as &quot;Truth Alone Triumphs&quot;) was released as the second single from the album on 9 August 2011, a week before India&#x27;s Independence Day on 15 August. Composed by Rahman to have an Indian feel, Jagger sings in Sanskrit on the song, which also features Stewart, Stone and Marley. The song premiered exclusively on Radio Mirchi 98.3 FM on 9 August across twenty-two Indian cities, and Tata DoCoMo is set to simultaneously promote the song and the album on mass media.
&quot;Beautiful People&quot; reached number 64 on the Dutch Single Top 100 chart.

Damian also worked with electronic artist Skrillex on a song called &quot;Make It Bun Dem&quot; in 2012. This song also appears in the 2012 game Far Cry 3. Affairs of the Heart was a massive hit in Jamaica, topping the reggae charts.
===&quot;Stony Hill&quot; (2017–present)===
Damian Marley released his fourth studio album, &quot;Stony Hill&quot;, in July 2017. Its first single &quot;Nail Pon Cross&quot; was released in August 2016. The album won the Grammy Award for Best Reggae Album at the 60th Annual Grammy Awards.

==Musical style==
Marley has described his music as &quot;dancehall and reggae. I&#x27;ve noticed ... people trying to separate the two of them,&quot; he continues. &quot;It&#x27;s Jamaican culture in general. I don&#x27;t try to classify or separate.&quot;
&quot;Distant Relatives&quot; fused hip hop and reggae musical elements, Marley and Nas also incorporated samples from African music into the album. The album&#x27;s lyrical content heavily revolves around themes concerning Africa, from ancestry and poverty, with social commentary of the United States and Africa. The track &quot;Count Your Blessings&quot; reflects on the plight of Africa.

<doc id="1035407" wikidata="Q2654697" url="?curid=1035407" title="RMS Arlanza (1911)">
<text>RMS &quot;Arlanza&quot; was a ocean liner of the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company. She was built in Belfast in 1912 for RMSP&#x27;s scheduled route between England and South America. She was a Royal Navy armed merchant cruiser from 1915 until 1920. She returned to civilian liner service in 1920 and was scrapped in 1938.

==Development==
Owen Philipps had become Chairman of RMSP in 1903, and over the next five years had introduced five new, larger ships on the company&#x27;s premier route between Southampton and the east coast of South America. The new ships came to be called the &quot;A-series&quot;, as each had a name beginning with that letter.

Philipps was interested in using steam turbines in the &quot;A-series&quot;, and discussed this with Charles Parsons who invented the turbine. But when the RMSP ordered the first member of the series, RMS &quot;Aragon&quot;, turbines were new to merchant shipping and almost untried. She and the next four &quot;A-series&quot; ships were therefore ordered with a pair of conventional quadruple-expansion engines powering a pair of screws.

After the fifth ship, RMS &quot;Asturias&quot;, was completed in 1908, it was clear that fuel consumption by steam turbines tended to be high, propellers driven directly by turbines were too fast for merchant service, and turbines running slowly enough to give a slow propeller speed for merchant service were inefficient. Reduction gearing was therefore being applied to allow turbines to run efficiently at high speed but drive propellers at low speed.

After &quot;Asturias&quot; another four &quot;A-series&quot; liners were built to a revised and enlarged design, with three screws instead of two. Each of the two outer screws was driven by a four-cylinder triple-expansion engine. The middle screw was driven by a low-pressure steam turbine, driven by exhaust steam from the low-pressure cylinders of the two reciprocating engines.

==Building==
&quot;Arlanza&quot; was the first of the &quot;A-series&quot; ships to have three screws and a low-pressure turbine. Harland and Wolff in Belfast built her and her engines. She was launched on 23 November 1911 and completed on 8 June 1912.

The ship had berths for 400 first class, 230 second class and 760 third class passengers: a total of 1,390. She had five holds and refrigerated cargo space for frozen meat.

==Early civilian career==
&quot;Arlanza&quot; began her maiden voyage from Southampton on 21 June 1912. Two years later, on 27 June 1914, she gave a short publicity cruise for UK dignitaries, South American ambassadors and a former prime minister of China. UK guests included the Earl of Coventry, Earl of Dundonald, Marquis of Douglas and Clydesdale, Lord Aberconway, Sir Edward Elgar, Admiral Sir Herbert Purey-Cust, Admiral Sir Archibald Douglas and Major General Sir Douglas Hadden.

After the UK entered the First World War, &quot;Arlanza&quot; remained in civilian service until early in 1915. On 16 August 1914 she was of the coast of Brazil with more than 1,000 people aboard when the German auxiliary cruiser intercepted her with the order &quot;Stop or I will open fire&quot;. Next the German ship ordered her to dismantle her radio aerials and throw them overboard. &quot;Arlanza&quot; was then asked how many women and children she had aboard. When she replied &quot;335 women, 97 children&quot;, the German ship ordered her to proceed.

==HMS &quot;Arlanza&quot;==
In April 1915 the Admiralty requisitioned &quot;Arlanza&quot; and her &quot;A-series&quot; sisters , &quot;Andes&quot; and for conversion into armed merchant cruisers. &quot;Arlanza&quot; was armed with six guns, and commissioned at Birkenhead on 24 April 1915 into the 10th Cruiser Squadron. &quot;Andes&quot; and &quot;Alcantara&quot; were also commissioned into the 10th Cruiser Squadron, which joined the Northern Patrol that was part of the First World War Allied naval blockade of the Central Powers. The Squadron patrolled about of the North Sea, Norwegian Sea and Arctic Ocean, to prevent German access to or from the North Atlantic.

Late in 1915 &quot;Arlanza&quot; was sent to Arkhangelsk with a £500,000 consignment of platinum bullion. On her return voyage she was to bring a Russian delegation to Britain for a conference with the UK and France. On 21 October she left the Russian port, preceded by minesweeping naval trawlers and followed by a convoy of merchant ships. Once she was clear of the part of the White Sea thought to be at risk of mines, the trawlers left her. An hour later a mine holed her near her forward hold.

&quot;Arlanza&quot;″s bow dipped lower in the water, but the bulkhead doors between her watertight compartments were closed and prevented her from sinking. Some of her lifeboats were launched and the Russian delegation was taken off. An accident when lowering one of the lifeboats dropped a number of Russian representatives and Royal Navy sailors into the icy water, but all were rescued. One of the trawlers returned to assist but struck one of &quot;Arlanza&quot;″s propellers, which had been raised by the lowering of her bow. The trawler was holed and sank, but &quot;Arlanza&quot; remained afloat. Everyone who had been taken off returned aboard &quot;Arlanza&quot;.
A party from the ship travelled by reindeer sledge across of snowy tundra to the Sami village of Yukanski for supplies. The ship remained at Yukanskie anchorage. On 10 November the armed merchant cruiser reached &quot;Arlanza&quot;. The next day they exchanged supplies: &quot;Orotava&quot; furnishing the damaged cruiser with steel cable in exchange for surplus cordite and ammunition. On 12 November &quot;Arlanza&quot;″s captain embarked on &quot;Orotava&quot; with 29 of his officers, one petty officer and 221 of his ratings to return to the UK. A reduced crew of nine officers and 100 men stayed aboard &quot;Arlanza&quot; in the White Sea, making temporary repairs to enable her to return to Ireland.

On 7–9 April &quot;Arlanza&quot; moved to the Kola Inlet. On 3 June 1916 the Thames tug &quot;Racia&quot; reached Kola Inlet to tow the cruiser back to Belfast. On 26 June the tug started to tow the cruiser home, with the cruiser using her own engines to assist as required. One source claims that the task proved too much for the tug, but &quot;Arlanza&quot; managed to return to Ireland under her own power. However, &quot;Arlanza&quot;″s log does not record &quot;Racia&quot; casting off. The two ships were still together on 30 June, but it is not clear whether the tug was still towing the cruiser by then. &quot;Arlanza&quot; reached Belfast on 8 July 1916 for repairs.

On 9 November &quot;Arlanza&quot; sailed to Liverpool, and on 21 November she returned to service on the Northern Patrol. From 10 July 1917 until the end of the war performed Atlantic convoy duties. This included a trip to South America in 1918, carrying the members of a special diplomatic mission from the British Foreign Office. She was decommissioned in April 1920 and returned to her owners.

==Later civilian career==

&quot;Arlanza&quot; resumed commercial service in July 1920. She remained continuously in regular liner service, whereas each of her surviving sisters now undertook cruising at least part-time and in some cases full-time. In 1924 she took Harland and Wolff Chairman Lord Pirrie to the River Plate to assess facilities for the newly ordered RMSP liners and . In 1929 &quot;Arlanza&quot; was converted from coal to oil fuel.

On 7 December 1929 in the Bay of Biscay &quot;Arlanza&quot; and a German ship went to help the Italian cargo ship , which was sinking. &quot;Arlanza&quot; rescued all of the crew except three, who were rescued by the German ship. the Italian Government, Lloyd&#x27;s of London and RMSP awarded medals and made presentations to a number of &quot;Arlanza&quot;″s crew for the bravery and outstanding seamanship they showed in the rescue. Able Seaman William Bonas, for example, received a bronze Lloyd&#x27;s Medal for Saving Life at Sea and a bronze Medaglia al valore di Marina.

In 1930 &quot;Arlanza&quot; took King Alfonso XIII of Spain home to Santander after a visit to Britain. In 1931 she took the Prince of Wales and Prince George from Brazil to Lisbon after their tour of South America.

In August 1938 &quot;Arlanza&quot; visited South America for the last time. In Buenos Aires a cheering crowd bade her farewell as she left port. In Montevideo &#x27;s Royal Marines Band played her out of port and the event was broadcast by radio throughout Uruguay. On 6 September she reached Southampton and entered port flying a paying-off pennant from her mainmast.

On 15 July 1938 Metal Industries Ltd contracted to buy &quot;Arlanza&quot; for £30,000 for scrap. Royal Mail Lines handed her over on 14 September and she was broken up at Rosyth.

<doc id="1035417" wikidata="Q417619" url="?curid=1035417" title="Nitric oxide synthase">
<text>Nitric oxide synthases () (NOSs) are a family of enzymes catalyzing the production of nitric oxide (NO) from L-arginine. NO is an important cellular signaling molecule. It helps modulate vascular tone, insulin secretion, airway tone, and peristalsis, and is involved in angiogenesis and neural development. It may function as a retrograde neurotransmitter. Nitric oxide is mediated in mammals by the calcium-calmodulin controlled isoenzymes eNOS (endothelial NOS) and nNOS (neuronal NOS). The inducible isoform, iNOS, involved in immune response, binds calmodulin at physiologically relevant concentrations, and produces NO as an immune defense mechanism, as NO is a free radical with an unpaired electron. It is the proximate cause of septic shock and may function in autoimmune disease.

NOS catalyzes the reaction:
* 2 L-arginine + 3 NADPH + 3 H+ + 4 O2 formula_1 2 citrulline +2 nitric oxide + 4 H2O + 3 NADP+

NOS isoforms catalyze other leak and side reactions, such as superoxide production at the expense of NADPH. As such, this stoichiometry is not generally observed, and reflects the three electrons supplied per NO by NADPH.

Eukaryotic NOS isozymes are catalytically self-sufficient. The electron flow is: NADPH → FAD → FMN → heme → O2. Tetrahydrobiopterin provides an additional electron during the catalytic cycle which is replaced during turnover. Zinc, though not a cofactor, also participates but as a structural element. NOSs are unique in that they use five cofactors and are the only known enzyme that binds flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), flavin mononucleotide (FMN), heme, tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) and calmodulin.

== Species distribution ==

Arginine-derived NO synthesis has been identified in mammals, fish, birds, invertebrates, and bacteria. Best studied are mammals, where three distinct genes encode NOS isozymes: neuronal (nNOS or NOS-1), cytokine-inducible (iNOS or NOS-2) and endothelial (eNOS or NOS-3). iNOS and nNOS are soluble and found predominantly in the cytosol, while eNOS is membrane associated. Evidence has been found for NO signaling in plants, but plant genomes are devoid of homologs to the superfamily which generates NO in other kingdoms.

== Function ==

In mammals, the endothelial isoform is the primary signal generator in the control of vascular tone, insulin secretion, and airway tone, is involved in regulation of cardiac function and angiogenesis (growth of new blood vessels). NO produced by eNOS has been shown to be a vasodilator identical to the endothelium-derived relaxing factor produced in response to shear from increased blood flow in arteries. This dilates blood vessels by relaxing smooth muscle in their linings. eNOS is the primary controller of smooth muscle tone. NO activates guanylate cyclase, which induces smooth muscle relaxation by:
* Increased intracellular cGMP, which inhibits calcium entry into the cell, and decreases intracellular calcium concentrations
* Activation of K+ channels, which leads to hyperpolarization and relaxation
* Stimulates a cGMP-dependent protein kinase that activates myosin light chain phosphatase, the enzyme that dephosphorylates myosin light chains, which leads to smooth muscle relaxation.

eNOS plays a critical role in embryonic heart development and morphogenesis of coronary arteries and cardiac valves.
The neuronal isoform is involved in the development of nervous system. It functions as a retrograde neurotransmitter important in long term potentiation and hence is likely to be important in memory and learning. nNOS has many other physiological functions, including regulation of cardiac function and peristalsis and sexual arousal in males and females. An alternatively spliced form of nNOS is a major muscle protein that produces signals in response to calcium release from the SR. nNOS in the heart protects against cardiac arrhythmia induced by myocardial infarction.
The primary receiver for NO produced by eNOS and nNOS is soluble guanylate cyclase, but many secondary targets have been identified. S-nitrosylation appears to be an important mode of action.

The inducible isoform iNOS produces large amounts of NO as a defense mechanism. It is synthesized by many cell types in response to cytokines and is an important factor in the response of the body to attack by parasites, bacterial infection, and tumor growth. It is also the cause of septic shock and may play a role in many diseases with an autoimmune etiology.

NOS signaling is involved in development and in fertilization in vertebrates. It has been implicated in transitions between vegetative and reproductive states in invertebrates, and in differentiation leading to spore formation in slime molds. NO produced by bacterial NOS is protective against oxidative damage.

NOS activity has also been correlated with major depressive episodes (MDEs) in the context of major depressive disorder, in a large case-control treatment study published in mid-2021. 460 patients with a current major depressive episode were compared to 895 healthy patients, and by measuring L-citrulline/L-arginine ratio before and after 3–6 months of antidepressant treatment, results indicate that patients in a major depressive episode have significantly lower NOS activity compared to healthy patients, whilst treatment with antidepressants significantly elevated NOS activity levels in patients in a major depressive episode.

== Classification ==

Different members of the NOS family are encoded by separate genes. There are three known isoforms in mammals, two are constitutive (cNOS) and the third is inducible (iNOS). Cloning of NOS enzymes indicates that cNOS include both brain constitutive (NOS1) and endothelial constitutive (NOS3); the third is the inducible (NOS2) gene. Recently, NOS activity has been demonstrated in several bacterial species, including the notorious pathogens Bacillus anthracis and Staphylococcus aureus.

The different forms of NO synthase have been classified as follows:

=== nNOS ===

Neuronal NOS (nNOS) produces NO in nervous tissue in both the central and peripheral nervous systems. Its functions include:

* Synaptic plasticity in the central nervous system (CNS)
* Smooth muscle relaxation
* Central regulation of blood pressure
* Vasodilatation via peripheral nitrergic nerves

Neuronal NOS also performs a role in cell communication and is associated with plasma membranes. nNOS action can be inhibited by NPA (N-propyl-L-arginine). This form of the enzyme is specifically inhibited by 7-nitroindazole.

The subcellular localisation of nNOS in skeletal muscle is mediated by anchoring of nNOS to dystrophin. nNOS contains an additional N-terminal domain, the PDZ domain.

The gene coding for nNOS is located on Chromosome 12.

=== iNOS ===

As opposed to the critical calcium-dependent regulation of constitutive NOS enzymes (nNOS and eNOS), iNOS has been described as calcium-insensitive, likely due to its tight non-covalent interaction with calmodulin (CaM) and Ca2+. The gene coding for iNOS is located on Chromosome 17. While evidence for ‘baseline’ iNOS expression has been elusive, IRF1 and NF-κB-dependent activation of the inducible NOS promoter supports an inflammation mediated stimulation of this transcript. iNOS produces large quantities of NO upon stimulation, such as by proinflammatory cytokines (e.g. Interleukin-1, Tumor necrosis factor alpha and Interferon gamma).

Induction of the high-output iNOS usually occurs in an oxidative environment, and thus high levels of NO have the opportunity to react with superoxide leading to peroxynitrite formation and cell toxicity. These properties may define the roles of iNOS in host immunity, enabling its participation in anti-microbial and anti-tumor activities as part of the oxidative burst of macrophages.

It has been suggested that pathologic generation of nitric oxide through increased iNOS production may decrease tubal ciliary beats and smooth muscle contractions and thus affect embryo transport, which may consequently result in ectopic pregnancy.

=== eNOS ===

Endothelial NOS (eNOS), also known as nitric oxide synthase 3 (NOS3), generates NO in blood vessels and is involved with regulating vascular function. The gene coding for eNOS is located on Chromosome 7. A constitutive Ca2+ dependent NOS provides a basal release of NO. eNOS localizes to caveolae, a plasma membrane domain primarily composed of the protein caveolin 1, and to the Golgi apparatus. These two eNOS populations are distinct, but are both necessary for proper NO production and cell health. eNOS localization to endothelial membranes is mediated by cotranslational N-terminal myristoylation and post-translational palmitoylation. As an essential co-factor for nitric oxide synthase, tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) supplementation has shown beneficial results for the treatment of endothelial dysfunction in animal experiments and clinical trials, although the tendency of BH4 to become oxidized to BH2 remains a problem.

=== bNOS ===
Bacterial NOS (bNOS) has been shown to protect bacteria against oxidative stress, diverse antibiotics, and host immune response. bNOS plays a key role in the transcription of superoxide dismutase (SodA). Bacteria late in the log phase who do not possess bNOS fail to upregulate SodA, which disables the defenses against harmful oxidative stress. Initially, bNOS may have been present to prepare the cell for stressful conditions but now seems to help shield the bacteria against conventional antimicrobials. As a clinical application, a bNOS inhibitor could be produced to decrease the load of Gram positive bacteria.

== Chemical reaction ==
Nitric oxide synthases produce NO by catalysing a five-electron oxidation of a guanidino nitrogen of -arginine (-Arg). Oxidation of -Arg to -citrulline occurs via two successive monooxygenation reactions producing &quot;N&quot;ω-hydroxy--arginine (NOHLA) as an intermediate. 2 mol of O2 and 1.5 mol of NADPH are consumed per mole of NO formed.

== Structure ==

The enzymes exist as homodimers. In eukaryotes, each monomer consisting of two major regions: an N-terminal oxygenase domain, which belongs to the class of heme-thiolate proteins, and a multi-domain C-terminal reductase, which is homologous to NADPH:cytochrome P450 reductase () and other flavoproteins. The FMN binding domain is homologous to flavodoxins, and the two domain fragment containing the FAD and NADPH binding sites is homologous to flavodoxin-NADPH reductases. The interdomain linker between the oxygenase and reductase domains contains a calmodulin-binding sequence. The oxygenase domain is a unique extended beta sheet cage with binding sites for heme and pterin.

NOSs can be dimeric, calmodulin-dependent or calmodulin-containing cytochrome p450-like hemoprotein that combines reductase and oxygenase catalytic domains in one dimer, bear both flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and flavin mononucleotide (FMN), and carry out a 5`-electron oxidation of non-aromatic amino acid arginine with the aid of tetrahydrobiopterin.

All three isoforms (each of which is presumed to function as a homodimer during activation) share a carboxyl-terminal reductase domain homologous to the cytochrome P450 reductase. They also share an amino-terminal oxygenase domain containing a heme prosthetic group, which is linked in the middle of the protein to a calmodulin-binding domain. Binding of calmodulin appears to act as a &quot;molecular switch&quot; to enable electron flow from flavin prosthetic groups in the reductase domain to heme. This facilitates the conversion of O2 and -arginine to NO and -citrulline. The oxygenase domain of each NOS isoform also contains an BH4 prosthetic group, which is required for the efficient generation of NO. Unlike other enzymes where BH4 is used as a source of reducing equivalents and is recycled by dihydrobiopterin reductase (), BH4 activates heme-bound O2 by donating a single electron, which is then recaptured to enable nitric oxide release.

The first nitric oxide synthase to be identified was found in neuronal tissue (NOS1 or nNOS); the endothelial NOS (eNOS or NOS3) was the third to be identified. They were originally classified as &quot;constitutively expressed&quot; and &quot;Ca2+ sensitive&quot; but it is now known that they are present in many different cell types and that expression is regulated under specific physiological conditions.

In NOS1 and NOS3, physiological concentrations of Ca2+ in cells regulate the binding of calmodulin to the &quot;latch domains&quot;, thereby initiating electron transfer from the flavins to the heme moieties. In contrast, calmodulin remains tightly bound to the inducible and Ca2+-insensitive isoform (iNOS or NOS2) even at a low intracellular Ca2+ activity, acting essentially as a subunit of this isoform.

Nitric oxide may itself regulate NOS expression and activity. Specifically, NO has been shown to play an important negative feedback regulatory role on NOS3, and therefore vascular endothelial cell function. This process, known formally as &quot;S&quot;-nitrosation (and referred to by many in the field as &quot;S&quot;-nitrosylation), has been shown to reversibly inhibit NOS3 activity in vascular endothelial cells. This process may be important because it is regulated by cellular redox conditions and may thereby provide a mechanism for the association between &quot;oxidative stress&quot; and endothelial dysfunction. In addition to NOS3, both NOS1 and NOS2 have been found to be &quot;S&quot;-nitrosated, but the evidence for dynamic regulation of those NOS isoforms by this process is less complete. In addition, both NOS1 and NOS2 have been shown to form ferrous-nitrosyl complexes in their heme prosthetic groups that may act partially to self-inactivate these enzymes under certain conditions. The rate-limiting step for the production of nitric oxide may well be the availability of -arginine in some cell types. This may be particularly important after the induction of NOS2.

==Inhibitors==
Ronopterin (VAS-203), also known as 4-amino-tetrahydrobiopterin (4-ABH4), an analogue of BH4 (a cofactor of NOS), is an NOS inhibitor that is under development as a neuroprotective agent for the treatment of traumatic brain injury. Other NOS inhibitors that have been or are being researched for possible clinical use include cindunistat, A-84643, ONO-1714, L-NOARG, NCX-456, VAS-2381, GW-273629, NXN-462, CKD-712, KD-7040, and guanidinoethyldisulfide, TFPI among others.

<text>The Virginia Beach Mariners were an American soccer club, who formerly played in the USL First Division of the United Soccer Leagues, the second division in the US Soccer hierarchy behind Major League Soccer. On March 30, 2007 the team folded due to lack of ownership.

The Mariners played at the Virginia Beach Sportsplex in Virginia Beach, Virginia, from 1999 up to their demise in 2007.

The team was founded in 1994 as the &quot;Hampton Roads Hurricanes&quot;, but they changed their name to Mariners after the first year. For the 2003 season, the team changed their name from Hampton Roads Mariners to the more widely recognizable Virginia Beach Mariners. The team went on a one- year hiatus in 1997, after which they joined the A-League.

In 2006, the Mariners added a USL Premier Development League club, the Virginia Beach Submariners. Shortly after the termination of the Mariners, the Submariners were taken over by the Hampton Roads Piranhas, a women&#x27;s W-League soccer club, who renamed the team the Hampton Roads Piranhas to reflect the change of ownership.

<doc id="1035450" wikidata="Q192572" url="?curid=1035450" title="In silico">
<text>In biology and other experimental sciences, an in silico experiment is one performed on a computer or via computer simulation software. The phrase is pseudo-Latin for &#x27;in silicon&#x27; (correct ), referring to silicon in computer chips. It was coined in 1987 as an allusion to the Latin phrases , , and , which are commonly used in biology (especially systems biology). The latter phrases refer, respectively, to experiments done in living organisms, outside living organisms, and where they are found in nature.

==History==
The earliest known use of the phrase was by Christopher Langton to describe artificial life, in the announcement of a workshop on that subject at the Center for Nonlinear Studies at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in 1987. The expression &quot;in silico&quot; was first used to characterize biological experiments carried out entirely in a computer in 1989, in the workshop &quot;Cellular Automata: Theory and Applications&quot; in Los Alamos, New Mexico, by Pedro Miramontes, a mathematician from National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), presenting the report &quot;DNA and RNA Physicochemical Constraints, Cellular Automata and Molecular Evolution&quot;. The work was later presented by Miramontes as his dissertation.

&quot;In silico&quot; has been used in white papers written to support the creation of bacterial genome programs by the Commission of the European Community. The first referenced paper where &quot;in silico&quot; appears was written by a French team in 1991. The first referenced book chapter where &quot;in silico&quot; appears was written by Hans B. Sieburg in 1990 and presented during a Summer School on Complex Systems at the Santa Fe Institute.

The phrase &quot;in silico&quot; originally applied only to computer simulations that modeled natural or laboratory processes (in all the natural sciences), and did not refer to calculations done by computer generically.

==Drug discovery with virtual screening==
In silico study in medicine is thought to have the potential to speed the rate of discovery while reducing the need for expensive lab work and clinical trials. One way to achieve this is by producing and screening drug candidates more effectively. In 2010, for example, using the protein docking algorithm EADock (see Protein-ligand docking), researchers found potential inhibitors to an enzyme associated with cancer activity &quot;in silico&quot;. Fifty percent of the molecules were later shown to be active inhibitors &quot;in vitro&quot;. This approach differs from use of expensive high-throughput screening (HTS) robotic labs to physically test thousands of diverse compounds a day, often with an expected hit rate on the order of 1% or less, with still fewer expected to be real leads following further testing (see drug discovery).

As an example, the technique was utilized for a drug repurposing study in order to search for potential cures for COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2).

==Cell models==

Efforts have been made to establish computer models of cellular behavior. For example, in 2007 researchers developed an in silico model of tuberculosis to aid in drug discovery, with the prime benefit of its being faster than real time simulated growth rates, allowing phenomena of interest to be observed in minutes rather than months. More work can be found that focus on modeling a particular cellular process such as the growth cycle of &quot;Caulobacter crescentus&quot;.

These efforts fall far short of an exact, fully predictive computer model of a cell&#x27;s entire behavior. Limitations in the understanding of molecular dynamics and cell biology, as well as the absence of available computer processing power, force large simplifying assumptions that constrain the usefulness of present in silico cell models.

==Genetics==
Digital genetic sequences obtained from DNA sequencing may be stored in sequence databases, be analyzed (see Sequence analysis), be digitally altered or be used as templates for creating new actual DNA using artificial gene synthesis.

==Other examples==
In silico computer-based modeling technologies have also been applied in:
* Whole cell analysis of prokaryotic and eukaryotic hosts e.g. &quot;E. coli&quot;, &quot;B. subtilis&quot;, yeast, CHO- or human cell lines
* Discovery of potential cure for COVID-19.
* Bioprocess development and optimization e.g. optimization of product yields
* Simulation of oncological clinical trials exploiting grid computing infrastructures, such as the European Grid Infrastructure, for improving the performance and effectiveness of the simulations.
* Analysis, interpretation and visualization of heterologous data sets from various sources e.g. genome, transcriptome or proteome data
* Validation of taxonomic assignment steps in herbivore metagenomics study.
* Protein design. One example is RosettaDesign, a software package under development and free for academic use.

<doc id="1035451" wikidata="Q402345" url="?curid=1035451" title="Rauma Line">
<text>The Rauma Line () is a long railway between the town of Åndalsnes (in Rauma Municipality in Møre og Romsdal county), and the village of Dombås (in Dovre Municipality in Innlandet county), in Norway. Running down the Romsdalen valley, the line opened between 1921 and 1924 as a branch of the Dovre Line, which connects to the cities of Oslo and Trondheim. Originally intended as the first stage to connect Ålesund, and possibly also Molde and Kristiansund, no extensions have ever been realized. The unelectrified line is served four times daily with SJ Norge&#x27;s Class 93, although in the summer the service only operates from Åndalsnes to Bjorli as a tourist service. CargoLink operates a daily freight train.

The line features two horseshoe curves and has a elevation drop. Among the line&#x27;s features is the Kylling Bridge and views of the mountainous valley. Five stations remain in use: Dombås, Lesja, Lesjaverk, Bjorli and Åndalsnes. There have been launched plans to replace the line with a high-speed railway.

Freight train service have started up again (as of 2021); previously the freight trains discontinued service in 2018.

==Route==

The long Rauma Line runs from Dombås Station on the Dovre Line to Åndalsnes Station. Dombås is located at above mean sea level (AMSL) and the railway falls to AMSL at Åndalsnes. The line has standard gauge, has 103 bridges and 5 tunnels, but unlike the Dovre Line is not electrified. The line has five stations still in use. The line is equipped with Global System for Mobile Communications – Railway (GSM-R), but lacks centralized traffic control (CTC). The infrastructure is owned and operated by the Norwegian National Rail Administration.

Dombås is located from Oslo on the Dovre Line. North of the station, both lines run into each their own tunnel, collectively known as the Dombås Tunnel, with the Rauma Line heading northwest into the flat Lesja area. At from Dombås, the line runs across the Jora Bridge, an long arch bridge with a main span of main span. After passing the now closed and demolished Bottheim Station, the line reaches Lesja Station, which is from Dombås. Although not normally manned, it can be manned if needed for trains to pass. The line then passes the closed Lora Station, before reaching Lesjaverk Station, which is from Dombås. The next station is Bjorli, which is manned and located from Dombås. Located at AMSL, it serves an Alpine skiing center during the winter.

The next section of railway sees a major drop in elevation. The line crosses the river Rauma on the Stuguflåt Bridge, and then runs through the long Stavem Tunnel. It is constructed as part of a horseshoe curve, and the railway continues, backtracking further down the valley and reaching Verma Station. It is located from Dombås and at elevation; it is normally unmanned, but is manned in case trains need to pass. Immediately after the station comes the long Kylling Tunnel, which puts the railway in the right angle to cross Rauma on the Kylling Bridge. The long arch bridge with a long main span has a clearance to the river below. The section from Verma Station and past Kylling Bridge acts as a new horseshoe curve.

The last part of the line is the most scenic, with excellent views of the valley of Romsdalen, including the Romsdalsalpene, and features such as Trollveggen and Romsdalshorn. The line continues past Flatmark Station, Marstein Station, Romsdalshron Station, runs through the long Åk Tunnel before reaching Åndalsnes Station. The station is from Oslo and serves a town with 3,000 people located on a fjord.

==History==

===Planning===
Following the plans of a railway between Oslo and Trondheim via Dovre, members of parliament from Møre og Romsdal asked the Ministry of the Interior to also make plan for a branch to the coast of Møre og Romsdal. There were made three proposals for a route: via Surnadal to Kristiansund, via Sunndal to Molde and via Romsdalen to Ålesund.

The first official plans for a railway through Romsdalen was made following a meeting in Romsdal County Council in 1872, who appointed a committee to look into the construction of a railway from Mjøsa via Gudbrandsdalen and Romsdalen to Romsdal. Two years later, the council bought shares for 100,000 Norwegian speciedaler () while municipalities and private investors bought shares for 396,532 specidaler.

In part because of the intense rivalry between the three regions, County Governor Alexander Kielland was forced to call a referendum, which resulted in a majority for the Romsdalen route. However, no specific political decisions was made until 1908, when plans for the line were made part of a national railway plan, approved by the Parliament of Norway on 9 and 10 June. At the time, the line was estimated to cost .

On 18 July 1909, the Ministry of Labour gave permission for surveying, which started on 8 August. The Railway Board send a proposal for a plan for the Rauma Line to the ministry on 23 May 1910, which was passed by parliament on 20 July. However, the vote did not include any allocation of money. Additional surveying started on 18 August 1911 and was led by W. Sandberg. This time two alternatives were to be surveyed, one with a maximum gradient of 2.6 percent, and one with 2.0. On 29 June, the government approved a concession for the line to be built as a private railway. The final plan for construction was presented by the Railway Board to the ministry of 17 June 1912, and was passed by parliament on 27 July.

===Construction===
Construction started on 12 January 1912 at Dombås. The work was divided into four geographic divisions, with offices located at Åndalsnes, Ormheim, Sørsletten and Holaker. The working week consisted of six days, with a ten-hour working day during summer, eight hours during winter and nine hours in spring and autumn. From 1921, a new law reduced the work week to 48 hours. The entire construction took 14,462,247 man-hours. The number of people employed varied between 615 and 550. Most of the workforce consisted of people from other parts of the country, and some foreigners, mostly from Sweden. The navvies were often unmarried and spent large parts of their income on alcohol.

In Åndalsnes, a cutting was made for the line and the earthwork from the cutting was used to create artificial land for the station and port. To secure sufficient water for the locomotives, the municipality built a larger water supply, including a new dam at Bjørmosen, which could secure per year for the railway. The stations were built in wood in a simple, balanced style similar to what was found on the Dovre Line. The buildings were designed in-house by NSB Arkitektkontor; the main architect being Gudmund Hoel, while other major contributors were Bjarte Baastad and Gerhard Fischer. Some minor buildings were reused designs from the Dovre Line by Erik Glosimodt.

The railway opened in three stages: the from Dombås to Bjorli on 19 November 1921, and the from Bjorli to Verma on 25 November 1923. Until the whole line was taken into use, there was a roundhouse in use at Bjorli. The line was officially opened on 29 November 1924 and regular operations started the next day.

===Operation===
Maintenance was originally organized with under two track masters, one in Åndalsnes and one in Dombås, and subdivided into 17 divisions. Each division had two employees, a platelayer foreman and a platelayer, in addition to four seasonal workers during the summer. Each division had a railway-owned house for the family of the two platelayers. Later the areas were merged to a single track master in Åndalsnes. During the Second World War, the line was bombed by Germany. This caused among other things the restaurant at Bjorli to burn down.

In 1923, parliament voted to expend the line to Ålesund, but did not follow up with any grants. The decision was annulled in 1935, but local interests continued to pursue an expansion. However, there was no local consensus for any one line; there was a conflict between the three areas of Sunnmøre, Romsdal and Nordmøre, each who wanted a different branch to their city, and a conflict between building railways and roads. In 1953, the proposals were finally discarded by regional politicians. However, proposals have since regularly been made.

The line played an important role in the World War II in 1940, when Germany attacked Norway (&quot;Operation Weserübung&quot;). Bergen and Trondheim and with a little delay Oslo, were quickly occupied by Germany, but not Åndalsnes, Ålesund and Molde. This allowed British forces to land in this area, and the king, government and the gold reserve could be sent to the United Kingdom.

Regular use of steam locomotives in passenger trains was terminated from 1 June 1958, when Di 3 locomotives were taken into use. From 1 June 1965, steam locomotives were no longer used for freight trains. In 1960, Ålesund Airport, Vigra was opened, and in the following decade also Molde Airport, Årø and Kristiansund Airport, Kvernberget opened. This resulted in a reduction of passengers on the railway, although the rail fares remained considerably lower than air fares. The infrastructure was upgraded between 1973 and 1983 for NOK 70; this included replacing all wooden sleepers with concrete sleepers, and replacing the sand with ballast.
In 1996, the government had proposed closing the night train service, after suggestions from NSB. The railway company was losing money on operating the night services, and stated that they needed a subsidy of , or NOK 400 per passenger, to retain the service. That year, the line had a ridership of 108,800, down from 116,500 in 1966. The service was kept after a parliamentarian compromise to convert NSB to a company in exchange for keeping the service.

In 2000, NSB introduced the new two-car Class 93 diesel multiple units on the Rauma Line. In October, the night train service was terminated and replaced by a night express bus. The original seating configuration in Class 93 was for 88 seats, but due to customer complaints about lack of seat pitch, NSB has reconfigured the trains in 2006 to 76 seats. Starting in 2003, NSB and the tourist board in Rauma started cooperating with running tourist trains during the summer. Aimed primarily at tourists arriving by cruise ship at Åndalsnes, the trains use longer time to Dombås, allowing for longer stops underway for passengers to disembark and board to look at various attractions. On special occasions, a steam train is used in the tourist runs.

==Service==

SJ Norge operates passenger train services on the line. Using Class 93 trains, they operate four services in each direction per day. Travel time is 1 hour and 17 minutes, and serves mostly as a feeding service to express trains on the Dovre Line. At Åndalsnes there are coordinating buses to the populated areas on the coast, such as Ålesund and Molde. During the summer, from June through August, NSB operates the trains as tourists trains, involving an audio guide over the speakers, the train driving extra slow past landmarks, and the train stopping altogether at Kylling Bridge and at Trollveggen. The travel time increases to 1 hour and 35 minutes. CargoLink operates freight trains on the line, with one service per day per direction during the night.

==Future==

There have been proposals to reduce or eliminate passenger transport on the line. A report by the Institute of Transport Economics in 2004 concluded that the low population density, the lack of termination in a city and the nature of being a branch line with correspondence at Dombås made it impossible to attract sufficient ridership to make operations profitable.

The lobbyist organisation Norsk Bane has paid for an investigation made by Deutsche Bahn which proposes to construct a high-speed railway between Ålesund and Oslo, which would run through Romsdalen. The line would connect to a proposed high-speed line between Oslo and Trondheim at Dombås, but would avoid going through Åndalsnes and instead pass through the village of Bjorli, through the Valldalen valley, before reaching the village of Valldal in Sunnmøre. The branch would be long, of which would run in tunnel and be on bridges and viaducts. It is estimated to cost NOK 30 billion and give a travel time of 2 hours and 33 minutes from Ålesund to Oslo. Because of 1.25 percent gradients, the line is suitable for freight trains. During daytime, freight trains would operate on the line in , while they could operate slower during the night. The proposal calls for twelve trains per direction per day between Ålesund and Oslo, and six trains per day between Ålesund and Trondheim.

The travel time Ålesund–Oslo by bus and train (using the Rauma Line) is (as of 2018) around 7 hours 55 minutes (by car slightly less), and Åndalsnes–Oslo around 5 hours 30 minutes (by car slightly more). Air travel has a leading market share with 606,000 passengers Ålesund–Oslo and 370,000 Molde-Oslo year 2016.

<text>Winnipeg North Centre was a federal electoral district in Manitoba, Canada, that was represented by a Member of Parliament (MP) in the House of Commons of Canada from 1925 to 2004. It is a largely working class riding in Winnipeg and has traditionally had a large Jewish and immigrant population.

The riding was created in 1924 and was first used for the 1925 federal election when it elected J.S. Woodsworth of the Independent Labour Party as its first MP. Woodsworth had previously represented Winnipeg Centre since the 1921 election. Woodsworth was re-elected there in 1926 and 1930. He held the seat for the party through the 1935 election and 1940 elections until his death in 1942. In 1932, Woodsworth helped found the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) in 1932 and was named its first leader. 

After Woodsworth&#x27;s death in 1942, a by-election held that year was won by Stanley Knowles of the CCF. Knowles held the seat until the 1958 election that returned a landslide for John Diefenbaker&#x27;s Progressive Conservative Party of Canada and elected Tory John MacLean in Winnipeg North Centre.

Out of parliament, Knowles went to work for the Canadian Labour Congress, and played a leading role in creating the alliance between the CLC and the CCF that led to the creation of the New Democratic Party (NDP) in 1961. Knowles won Winnipeg North Centre for the NDP in the 1962 election, and held the riding until his retirement in 1984.

In the 1984 election, the riding stayed in NDP hands with the election of Cyril Keeper. The NDP lost the riding in the 1988 election, however, when David Walker of the Liberal Party of Canada took the seat. Walker was re-elected in the 1993 election.

In the 1997 election, the NDP retook the riding (which since had its name changed to Winnipeg Centre) with Pat Martin becoming the MP. Martin retained the seat in the 2000 election.

The electoral district was abolished in 2003 when it was redistributed between Winnipeg North, Winnipeg Centre and Kildonan—St. Paul ridings.

Martin was re-elected to Parliament in Winnipeg Centre riding in the 2004 election.

This riding elected the following members of Parliament:

<text>The &quot;Pretty Little Lightning Paw&quot; E.P. is an EP by Thee Silver Mt. Zion Memorial Orchestra &amp; Tra-La-La Band under the name Thee Silver Mountain Reveries. It was released May 2004 on Constellation Records. The name the band assumed for this EP was temporary; they have since reverted to using Thee Silver Mt. Zion Memorial Orchestra.

Many of the band members switched instruments for this recording. For example, Sophie Trudeau, who usually plays violin, plays bass guitar. Ian Ilavsky, usually one of the band&#x27;s guitarists, plays drums. When recording was complete, the EP was played on a boombox and rerecorded from that, giving it a rough sound.

On the track, &quot;There&#x27;s a River in the Valley Made of Melting Snow&quot;, the Hebrew lyric, &quot;baruch atta adonai&quot; (), means &quot;bless the Lord&quot;.

<doc id="1035470" wikidata="Q10681911" url="?curid=1035470" title="Stroke recovery">
<text>The primary goals of stroke management are to reduce brain injury and promote maximum patient recovery. Rapid detection and appropriate emergency medical care are essential for optimizing health outcomes. When available, patients are admitted to an acute stroke unit for treatment. These units specialize in providing medical and surgical care aimed at stabilizing the patient&#x27;s medical status. Standardized assessments are also performed to aid in the development of an appropriate care plan. Current research suggests that stroke units may be effective in reducing in-hospital fatality rates and the length of hospital stays.

Once a patient is medically stable, the focus of their recovery shifts to rehabilitation. Some patients are transferred to in-patient rehabilitation programs, while others may be referred to out-patient services or home-based care. In-patient programs are usually facilitated by an interdisciplinary team that may include a physician, nurse, pharmacist, physical therapist, occupational therapist, speech and language pathologist, psychologist, and recreation therapist. The patient and their family/caregivers also play an integral role on this team. Family/caregivers that are involved in the patient care tend to be prepared for the caregiving role as the patient transitions from rehabilitation centers. While at the rehabilitation center, the interdisciplinary team makes sure that the patient attains their maximum functional potential upon discharge. The primary goals of this sub-acute phase of recovery include preventing secondary health complications, minimizing impairments, and achieving functional goals that promote independence in activities of daily living.

In the later phases of stroke recovery, patients are encouraged to participate in secondary prevention programs for stroke. Follow-up is usually facilitated by the patient&#x27;s primary care provider.

The initial severity of impairments and individual characteristics, such as motivation, social support, and learning ability, are key predictors of stroke recovery outcomes. Responses to treatment and overall recovery of function are highly dependent on the individual. Current evidence indicates that most significant recovery gains will occur within the first 12 weeks following a stroke.

==History of stroke neuro-rehabilitation==
In 1620, Johann Jakob Wepfer, by studying the brain of a pig, developed the theory that stroke was caused by an interruption of the flow of blood to the brain. After that, the focus became how to treat patients with stroke.

For most of the last century, people were discouraged from being active after a stroke. Around the 1950s, this attitude changed, and health professionals began prescription of therapeutic exercises for stroke patient with good results. At that point, a good outcome was considered to be achieving a level of independence in which patients are able to transfer from the bed to the wheelchair without assistance.

In the early 1950s, Twitchell began studying the pattern of recovery in stroke patients. He reported on 121 patients whom he had observed. He found that by four weeks, if there is some recovery of hand function, there is a 70% chance of making a full or good recovery. He reported that most recovery happens in the first three months, and only minor recovery occurs after six months. More recent research has demonstrated that significant improvement can be made years after the stroke.

Around the same time, Brunnstrom also described the process of recovery, and divided the process into seven stages. As knowledge of the science of brain recovery improved, intervention strategies have evolved. Knowledge of strokes and the process of recovery after strokes has developed significantly in the late 20th century and early 21st century.

==Current perspectives and therapeutic avenues==

===Motor re-learning===

&quot;Neurocognitive Rehabilitation by Carlo Perfetti concept&quot;, widespread in many countries, is an original motor re-learning theories application.

====Constraint-induced movement therapy====

The idea for constraint-induced therapy is at least 100 years old. Significant research was carried out by Robert Oden. He was able to simulate a stroke in a monkey&#x27;s brain, causing hemiplegia. He then bound up the monkey&#x27;s good arm, and forced the monkey to use his bad arm, and observed what happened. After two weeks of this therapy, the monkeys were able to use their once hemiplegic arms again. This is due to neuroplasticity. He did the same experiment without binding the arms, and waited six months past their injury. The monkeys without the intervention were not able to use the affected arm even six months later. In 1918, this study was published, but it received little attention.

Eventually, researchers began to apply his technique to stroke patients, and it came to be called constraint-induced movement therapy. Notably, the initial studies focused on chronic stroke patients who were more than 12 months past their stroke. This challenged the belief held at that time that no recovery would occur after one year. The therapy entails wearing a soft mitt on the good hand for 90% of the waking hours, forcing use of the affected hand. The patients undergo intense one-on-one therapy for six to eight hours per day for two weeks.

Evidence that supports the use of constraint induced movement therapy has been growing since its introduction as an alternative treatment method for upper limb motor deficits found in stroke populations. Recently, constraint induced movement therapy has been shown to be an effective rehabilitation technique at varying stages of stroke recovery to improve upper limb motor function and use during activities of daily living. These may include, but are not limited to, eating, dressing, and hygiene activities. CIMT may improve motor impairment and motor function, but the benefits have not been found to convincingly reduce disability, with further research required. Using functional activities as part of the CIMT treatment has been shown to enhance functional outcomes in one&#x27;s activities of daily living. Occupational therapists are uniquely qualified to provide function-based treatment in conjunction with a CIMT approach. The greatest gains are seen among persons with stroke who exhibit some wrist and finger extension in the affected limb. Transcranial magnetic stimulation and brain imaging studies have demonstrated that the brain undergoes plastic changes in function and structure in patients that perform constraint induced movement therapy. These changes accompany the gains in motor function of the paretic upper limb. However, there is no established causal link between observed changes in brain function/structure and the motor gains due to constraint induced movement therapy.

Constraint induced movement therapy has recently been modified to treat aphasia in patients post CVA as well. This treatment intervention is known as Constraint Induced Aphasia Therapy (CIAT). The same general principals apply, however in this case, the client is constricted from using compensatory strategies to communicate such as gestures, writing, drawing, and pointing, and are encouraged to use verbal communication. Therapy is typically carried out in groups and barriers are used so hands, and any compensatory strategies are not seen.

====Mental practice/mental imagery====
Mental practice of movements, has been shown in many studies to be effective in promoting recovery of both arm and leg function after a stroke. It is often used by physical or occupational therapists in the rehab or homehealth setting, but can also be used as part of a patient&#x27;s independent home exercise program. Mental Movement Therapy is one product available for assisting patients with guided mental imagery.

===Brain repair===

====Electrical stimulation====

Such work represents a paradigm shift in the approach towards rehabilitation of the stroke-injured brain away from pharmacologic flooding of neuronal receptors and instead, towards targeted physiologic stimulation. In layman&#x27;s terms, this electrical stimulation mimics the action of healthy muscle to improve function and aid in retraining weak muscles and normal movement. Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) is commonly used in &#x27;foot-drop&#x27; following stroke, but it can be used to help retrain movement in the arms or legs.

====Bobath (NDT)====

In patients undergoing rehabilitation with a stroke population or other central nervous system disorders (cerebral palsy, etc.), Bobath, also known as Neurodevelopmental Treatment (NDT), is often the treatment of choice in North America. The Bobath concept is best viewed as a framework for interpretation and problem solving of the individual patient&#x27;s presentation, along with their potential for improvement. Components of motor control that are specifically emphasized, are the integration of postural control and task performance, the control of selective movement for the production of coordinated sequences of movement and the contribution of sensory inputs to motor control and motor learning. Task practice is a component of a broad approach to treatment that includes in-depth assessment of the movement strategies utilized by the patient to perform tasks, and identification of specific deficits of neurological and neuromuscular functions. Many studies have been conducted comparing NDT with other treatment techniques such as proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF stretching), as well as conventional treatment approaches (utilizing traditional exercises and functional activities), etc. Despite being widely used, based on the literature, NDT has failed to demonstrate any superiority over other treatment techniques available. In fact, the techniques compared with NDT in these studies often produce similar results in terms of treatment effectiveness. Research has demonstrated significant findings for all these treatment approaches when compared with control subjects and indicate that overall, rehabilitation is effective. It is important to note, however, that the NDT philosophy of &quot;do what works best&quot; has led to heterogeneity in the literature in terms of what constitutes an NDT technique, thus making it difficult to directly compare to other techniques.

====Mirror Therapy====

Mirror therapy (MT) has been employed with some success in treating stroke patients. Clinical studies that have combined mirror therapy with conventional rehabilitation have achieved the most positive outcomes. However, there is no clear consensus as to its effectiveness. In a recent survey of the published research, Rothgangel concluded that

==== Robotic Rehabilitation ====
Robot-assisted training enables stroke patients with moderate or severe upper limb impairment to perform repetitive tasks in a highly consistent manner, tailored to their motor abilities. High intensity repetitive task practice delivered via robot-assisted therapy is recommended to improve motor function in individuals in the inpatient, outpatient and chronic care settings. These therapies have achieved the highest level of evidential support by the American Heart Association (Class I, Level of Evidence A) for the outpatient and chronic care settings and Class IIa Level of Evidence for the inpatient setting.

Electromechanical and robot-assisted arm training may improve arm function (measured using the &#x27;arm function outcome measure&#x27;) and may significantly improve activities of daily living (ADL) scores.

==Stem cells therapies (in research)==

===Use of bone-marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in the treatment of ischemic stroke===

The terminal differentiation of some somatic stem cells has recently been called into question after studies of transplanted haematopoietic stem cells showed the development of myoblasts, endothelium, epithelium and neuroectodermal cells, suggesting pluripotency. These findings have led to MSCs being considered for treatment of ischemic stroke, specifically in directly enhancing neuroprotection and the neurorestorative processes of neurogenesis, angiogenesis and synaptic plasticity.

====Possible mechanisms of neurorestoration and neuroprotection by MSCs after stroke====

Transdifferentiation of MSCs into excitable neuron-like cells has been shown to be possible in vitro and these cells respond to common central nervous system neurotransmitters. However, it is unlikely that this degree of transdifferentiation occurs in vivo and that &lt;1% of injected MSCs become truly differentiated and integrate in the damaged area. This suggests that transdifferentiation of MSCs into neurons or neuron-like cells is not a major mechanism by which MSCs cause neurorestoration.

Induction of neurogenesis (development of new neurons) is another possible mechanism of neurorestoration; however its correlation with functional improvement after stroke is not well established. The inducted cells likely originate from the ventricular zone, subventricular zone and choroid plexus, and migrate to the areas in their respective hemispheres which are damaged. Unlike the induction of neurogenesis, the induction of angiogenesis (development of new blood vessels) by MSCs has been associated with improvements in brain function after ischemic strokes and is linked to improved neuronal recruitment. In addition, synaptogenesis (formation of new synapses between neurons) has been shown to increase after MSC treatment; this combination of improved neurogenesis, angiogenesis and synaptogenesis may lead to a more significant functional improvement in damaged areas as a result of MSC treatment.

MSC treatment also has shown to have various neuroprotective effects, including reductions in apoptosis, inflammation and demyelination, as well as increased astrocyte survival rates. MSC treatment also appears to improve the control of cerebral blood flow and blood–brain barrier permeability, as well as what is currently thought to be the most important mechanism of MSC treatment after stroke, the activation of endogenous neuroprotection and neurorestoration pathways by the release of cytokines and trophic factors.

Although activation of endogenous neuroprotection and neurorestoration probably has a major part in the improvement of brain function after stroke, it is likely that the functional improvements as a result of MSC treatment are due to combined action via multiple cellular and molecular mechanisms to affect neurorestoration and neuroprotection, rather than just a single mechanism. These effects are also modulated by key variables, including the number of and type of MSCs used, timing of treatment relative to when the patient&#x27;s stroke occurred, route of delivery of the MSCs, as well as patient variables (e.g. age, underlying conditions).

====What this means for stroke patients and the limitations or concerns with MSCs as a potential treatment====

If MSC treatment becomes available for stroke patients, it is possible that current mortality and morbidity rates could substantially improve due to the direct enhancement of neuroprotection and neurorestoration mechanisms rather than only indirect facilitation or prevention of further damage, e.g. decompressive surgery. However, for MSC treatment to be used effectively and safely in a clinical setting, more research needs to be conducted, specifically in the areas of determining the relative influences of key variables (especially patient variables) on patient outcomes as well quantifying potential risks, e.g. tumour formation. Although ethical concerns are mostly limited to the use of embryonic stem cells, it may also be important to address any possible ethical concerns (however unlikely) over the use of somatic stem cells.

==Training of muscles affected by the upper motor neuron syndrome==
Muscles affected by the upper motor neuron syndrome have many potential features of altered performance including: weakness, decreased motor control, clonus (a series of involuntary rapid muscle contractions), exaggerated deep tendon reflexes, spasticity and decreased endurance.
The term &quot;spasticity&quot; is often erroneously used interchangeably with upper motor neuron syndrome, and it is not unusual to see patients labeled as spastic who demonstrate an array of UMN findings.

It has been estimated that approximately 65% of individuals develop spasticity following stroke, and studies have revealed that approximately 40% of stroke patients may still have spasticity at 12 months post-stroke. The changes in muscle tone probably result from alterations in the balance of inputs from reticulospinal and other descending pathways to the motor and interneuronal circuits of the spinal cord, and the absence of an intact corticospinal system. In other words, there is damage to the part of the brain or spinal cord that controls voluntary movement.

Various means are available for the treatment of the effects of the upper motor neuron syndrome. These include: exercises to improve strength, control and endurance, nonpharmacologic therapies, oral drug therapy, intrathecal drug therapy, injections, and surgery.

While Landau suggests that researchers do not believe that treating spasticity is worthwhile, many scholars and clinicians continue to attempt to manage/treat it.

Another group of researchers concluded that while spasticity may contribute to significant motor and activity impairments post-stroke, the role of spasticity has been overemphasized in stroke rehabilitation.
In a survey done by the National Stroke Association, while 58 percent of survivors in the survey experienced spasticity, only 51 percent of those had received treatment for the condition.

===Nonpharmacologic therapies===
Treatment should be based on assessment by the relevant health professionals, although there is evidence that caregivers utilise social media communities to source information related to stroke recovery. For muscles with mild-to-moderate impairment, exercise should be the mainstay of management, and is likely to need to be prescribed by a physiotherapist.

Muscles with severe impairment are likely to be more limited in their ability to exercise and may require help to do this. They may require additional interventions, to manage the greater neurological impairment and also the greater secondary complications. These interventions may include serial casting, flexibility exercise such as sustained positioning programs, and patients may require equipment, such as using a standing frame to sustain a standing position. Applying specially made Lycra garments may also be beneficial.

==== Interventions for age-related visual problems in patients with stroke ====
With the prevalence of vision problems increasing with age in stroke patients, the overall effect of interventions for age-related visual problems is currently uncertain. It is also not sure whether people with stroke respond differently from the general population when treating eye problems. Further research in this area is needed as current body of evidence is very low quality.

====Physiotherapy====
Physiotherapy is beneficial in this area as it helps post-stroke individuals to progress through the stages of motor recovery. These stages were originally described by Twitchell and Brunnstrom, and may be known as the Brunnstrom Approach. Initially, post-stroke individuals have flaccid paralysis. As recovery begins, and progresses, basic movement synergies will develop into more complex and difficult movement combinations. Concurrently, spasticity may develop and become quite severe before it begins to decline (if it does at all). Although an overall pattern of motor recovery exists, there is much variability between each individual&#x27;s recovery. As previously described, the role of spasticity in stroke rehabilitation is controversial. However, physiotherapy can help to improve motor performance, in part, through the management of spasticity. Repetitive task training (RTT), which involves the active practice of task-specific motor activities, improves upper and lower limb function, with improvements being sustained 6-months post-treatment. More research is needed on the type and amount of training.

Unaddressed spasticity will result in the maintenance of abnormal resting limb postures which can lead to contracture formation. In the arm, this may interfere with hand hygiene and dressing, whereas in the leg, abnormal resting postures may result in difficulty transferring. In order to help manage spasticity, physiotherapy interventions should focus on modifying or reducing muscle tone. Strategies include mobilizations of the affected limbs early in rehabilitation, along with elongation of the spastic muscle and sustained stretching. In addition, the passive manual technique of rhythmic rotation can help to increase initial range. Activating the antagonist (muscle) in a slow and controlled movement is a beneficial training strategy that can be used by post-stroke individuals. Splinting, to maintain muscle stretch and provide tone inhibition, and cold (i.e. in the form of ice packs), to decrease neural firing, are other strategies that can be used to temporarily decrease the extent of spasticity. The focus of physiotherapy for post-stroke individuals is to improve motor performance, in part, through the manipulation of muscle tone.

===Oral drug therapies===
Oral medications used for the treatment of spasticity include: diazepam (Valium), dantrolene sodium, baclofen, tizanidine, clonidine, gabapentin, and even cannabinoid-like compounds.³ The exact mechanism of these medications is not fully understood, but they are thought to act on neurotransmitters or neuromodulators within the central nervous system (CNS) or muscle itself, or to decrease the stretch reflexes. The problem with these medications is their potential side effects and the fact that, other than lessening painful or disruptive spasms and dystonic postures, drugs in general have not been shown to decrease impairments or lessen disabilities.

===Intrathecal drug therapy===
Intrathecal administration of drugs involves the implantation of a pump that delivers medication directly to the CNS. The benefit of this is that the drug remains in the spinal cord, without traveling in the bloodstream, and there are often fewer side effects. The most commonly used medication for this is baclofen but morphine sulfate and Fentanyl have been used as well, mainly for severe pain as a result of the spasticity.

===Injections===
Injections are focal treatments administered directly into the spastic muscle. Drugs used include: Botulinum toxin (BTX), phenol, alcohol, and lidocaine. Phenol and alcohol cause local muscle damage by denaturing protein, and thus relaxing the muscle. Botulinum toxin is a neurotoxin and it relaxes the muscle by preventing the release of a neurotransmitter (acetylcholine). Many studies have shown the benefits of BTX and it has also been demonstrated that repeat injections of BTX show unchanged effectiveness.

===Surgery===
Surgical treatment for spasticity includes lengthening or releasing of muscle and tendons, procedures involving bones, and also selective dorsal rhizotomy. Rhizotomy, usually reserved for severe spasticity, involves cutting selective sensory nerve roots, as they probably play a role in generating spasticity.

==Post-stroke pain syndromes==
Chronic pain syndromes are common in about one half of stroke patients. Central post-stroke pain (CPSP) is neuropathic pain which is caused by damage to the neurons in the brain (central nervous system), as the result of a vascular injury. One study found that up to 8% of people who have had a stroke will develop central post-stroke pain, and that the pain will be moderate to severe in 5% of those affected. The condition was formerly called &quot;thalamic pain&quot;, because of the high incidence among those with damage to the thalamus or thalamic nuclei. Now known as CPSP, it is characterized by perceived pain from non-painful stimuli, such as temperature and light touch. This altered perception of stimuli, or allodynia, can be difficult to assess due to the fact that the pain can change daily in description and location, and can appear anywhere from months to years after the stroke. CPSP can also lead to a heightened central response to painful sensations, or hyperpathia. Affected persons may describe the pain as cramping, burning, crushing, shooting, pins and needles, and even bloating or urinary urgency. Both the variation and mechanism of pain in CPSP have made it difficult to treat. Several strategies have been employed by physicians, including intravenous lidocaine, opioids/narcotics, anti-depressants, anti-epileptic medications and neurosurgical procedures with varying success. Higher rates of successful pain control in persons with CPSP can be achieved by treating other sequelae of stroke, such as depression and spasticity. As the age of the population increases, the diagnosis and management of CPSP will become increasingly important to improve the quality of life of an increasing number of stroke survivors.

===Hemiplegic shoulder pain===
==== Cause ====
Hemiplegic shoulder pain (shoulder pain on the stroke-affected side of the body) is a common source of pain and dysfunction following stroke. The cause (etiology) of hemiplegic shoulder pain remains unclear. Possible causes may include shoulder subluxation, muscle contractures, spasticity, rotator cuff disorders or impingement, and complex regional pain syndrome. Overall, the shoulder is very mobile, and relies on muscles and ligaments to support it, therefore, if a stroke damages the neurons that control those muscles and ligaments, the joint can be affected and pain may result.

==== Pharmacological therapies ====
Analgesics (ibuprofen and acetaminophen) may offer some pain relief for generalized hemiplegic shoulder pain. For people with spasticity associated shoulder pain, botulinum toxin injections into the shoulder muscles has also been shown to provide significant pain relief and improve range of motion. Subacromial corticosteroid injections can be effective for people with shoulder pain related to injury/inflammation of the rotator cuff region.

==== Non-pharmacological treatment ====
There are several non-pharmacological interventions which are recommended for prevention and treatment of post-stroke hemiplegic shoulder pain. These include proper positioning, range of motion exercises, motor retraining, and adjuvant therapies like neuromuscular electric stimulation (NMES) (e.g. functional electric stimulation (FES)). The use of slings remains controversial. Functional electric stimulation (FES) is a NMES technique where nerves or muscles affected by stroke receive bursts of low-level electrical current. The goal of FES is to strengthen muscle contraction and improve motor control. It may be effective in reducing subluxation and the pain associated with subluxation. Different slings are available to manage shoulder subluxation. However, the use of slings remains controversial and may increase the risk of adverse effects on symmetry and balance between the left and right shoulders, and can impact peoples&#x27; body image.

=== Shoulder subluxation ===
Glenohumeral (or shoulder) subluxation is defined as a partial or incomplete dislocation of the shoulder joint that typically results from changes in the mechanical integrity of the joint. Subluxation is a common problem with hemiplegia, or weakness of the musculature of the upper limb. Traditionally this has been thought to be a significant cause of post-stroke shoulder pain, although a few recent studies have failed to show a direct correlation between shoulder subluxation and pain.

The exact cause of subluxation in post-stroke patients is unclear but appears to be caused by weakness of the musculature supporting the shoulder joint. The shoulder is one of the most mobile joints in the body. To provide a high level of mobility the shoulder sacrifices ligamentous stability and as a result relies on the surrounding musculature (i.e., rotator cuff muscles, latissimus dorsi, and deltoid) for much of its support. This is in contrast to other less mobile joints such as the knee and hip, which have a significant amount of support from the joint capsule and surrounding ligaments. If a stroke damages the upper motor neurons controlling muscles of the upper limb, weakness and paralysis, followed by spasticity occurs in a somewhat predictable pattern. The muscles supporting the shoulder joint, particularly the supraspinatus and posterior deltoid become flaccid and can no longer offer adequate support leading to a downward and outward movement of arm at the shoulder joint causing tension on the relatively weak joint capsule. Other factors have also been cited as contributing to subluxation such as pulling on the hemiplegic arm and improper positioning.

Diagnosis can usually be made by palpation or by feeling the joint and surrounding tissues, although there is controversy as to whether or not the degree of subluxation can be measured clinically. If shoulder subluxation occurs, it can become a barrier to the rehabilitation process. Treatment involves measures to support the subluxed joint such as taping the joint, using a lapboard or armboard. A shoulder sling may be used, but is controversial and a few studies have shown no appreciable difference in range-of-motion, degree of subluxation, or pain when using a sling. A sling may also contribute to contractures and increased flexor tone if used for extended periods of time as it places the arm close to the body in adduction, internal rotation and elbow flexion. Use of a sling can also contribute to learned nonuse by preventing the functional and spontaneous use of the affected upper extremity. That said, a sling may be necessary for some therapy activities. Slings may be considered appropriate during therapy for initial transfer and gait training, but overall use should be limited. As the patient begins to recover, spasticity and voluntary movement of the shoulder will occur as well as reduction in the shoulder subluxation. Slings are of no value at this point.

Functional electrical stimulation (FES) has also shown promising results in treatment of subluxation, and reduction of pain, although some studies have shown a return of pain after discontinuation of FES. More recent research has failed to show any reduction of pain with the use of FES.

Logical treatment consists of preventive measures such as early range of motion, proper positioning, passive support of soft tissue structures and possibly early re-activation of shoulder musculature using functional electrical stimulation. Aggressive exercises such as overhead pulleys should be avoided with this population.

== Rehabilitation ==
Cognitive rehabilitation for spatial neglect following stroke

The current body of evidence is uncertain on the efficacy of cognitive rehabilitation for reducing the disabling effects of neglect and increasing independence remains unproven. However, there is limited evidence that cognitive rehabilitation may have an immediate beneficial effect on tests of neglect. Overall, no rehabilitation approach can be supported by evidence for spatial neglect.

Rehabilitation for improving automobile driving after stroke

The current body of evidence is uncertain whether the use of rehabilitation can improve on-road driving skills following stroke. There is limited evidence that training on a driving simulator will improve performance on recognizing road signs after training. The findings are based on low-quality evidence as further research is needed involving large numbers of participants.

Yoga for stroke rehabilitation

Based on low quality evidence, it is currently uncertain whether yoga has a significant benefit for stroke rehabilitation on measures of quality of life, balance, strength, endurance, pain, and disability scores. Yoga may reduce anxiety and could be included as part of patient-centred stroke rehabilitation. Further research is needed assessing the benefits and safety of yoga in stroke rehabilitation.

Action observation for upper limb rehabilitation after stroke

The latest scientific evidence indicates that action observation is beneficial in improving upper limb and hand function in patients with stroke. Thus, action observation therapy is generally associated with better arm and hand function, with no significant adverse events. The findings are based on low to moderate quality evidence.

Cognitive rehabilitation for attention deficits following stroke

The current body of scientific evidence is uncertain on the effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation for attention deficits in patients following stroke. While there may be an immediate effect after treatment on attention, the findings are based on low to moderate quality and small number of studies. Further research is needed to assess whether the effect can be sustained in day-to-day tasks requiring attention.

Motor imagery for gait rehabilitation after stroke

The latest evidence supports the short-term benefits of motor imagery (MI) on walking speed in individuals who have had a stroke, in comparison to other therapies. MI does not improve motor function after stroke and does not seem to cause significant adverse events. The findings are based on low-quality evidence as further research is needed to estimate the effect of MI on walking endurance and the dependence on personal assistance.

==Apraxia==

An uncommon, less understood result of stroke is a condition called apraxia. This condition was initially recognized as: &#x27;Disorders of the execution of learned movements which cannot be accounted for by either weakness, incoordination, or sensory loss, nor by incomprehension of, or inattention to commands.&#x27; Several forms of apraxia are recognized. Limb-kinetic apraxia is the inability to make precise or exact movements with a finger, an arm or a leg. idiomotor apraxia is the inability to carry out a command from the brain to mimic limb or head movements performed or suggested by others. Conceptual apraxia is similar to idiomotor apraxia, but infers a more profound malfunctioning in which the function of tools or objects is no longer understood. Ideational apraxia is the inability to create a plan for a specific movement. Buccofacial apraxia, or facial-oral apraxia, is the inability to coordinate and carry out facial and lip movements such as whistling, winking, coughing, etc. on command. Constructional apraxia affects the person&#x27;s ability to draw or copy simple diagrams, or to construct simple figures. Oculomotor apraxia is a condition in which the patient finds it difficult to move his/her eyes. Many believe that the most common form of apraxia is idiomotor apraxia, in which a disconnection between the area of the brain containing plans for a movement and the area of the brain that is responsible for executing that movement occurs.

Unlike many effects of stroke, where the clinician is able to judge the particular area of the brain that a stroke has injured by certain signs or symptoms, the causation of apraxia is less clear. A common theory is that the part of the brain that contains information for previously learned skilled motor activities has been either lost or cannot be accessed. The condition is usually due to an insult to the dominant hemisphere of the brain. More often this is located in the frontal lobe of the left hemisphere of the brain. Treatment of acquired apraxia due to stroke usually consists of physical, occupational, and speech therapy. The Copenhagen Stroke Study, which is a large important study published in 2001, showed that out of 618 stroke patients, manual apraxia was found in 7% and oral apraxia was found in 6%. Both manual and oral apraxia were related to increasing severity of stroke. Oral apraxia was related with an increase in age at the time of the stroke. There was no difference in incidence among gender. It was also found that the finding of apraxia has no negative influence on ability to function after rehabilitation is completed. The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is currently sponsoring a clinical trial to gain an understanding of how the brain operates while carrying out and controlling voluntary motor movements in normal subjects. The objective is to determine what goes wrong with these processes in the course of acquired apraxia due to stroke or brain injury.

==Lateral medullary syndrome==

Lateral medullary syndrome, also known as Wallenberg&#x27;s syndrome, is caused by blockage of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) or the vertebral arteries. Signs and symptoms include decreased pain and temperature on the same side of the face and opposite side of the body compared to the lesion, ataxia on the same side of the lesion, and Horner&#x27;s syndrome on the same side of the face.

Treatment in the acute setting is mostly focused on symptomatic management. After initial treatment in the hospital, some patients will need short-term placement in a nursing home or rehabilitation facility before going home. In hospital settings the doctors work with speech pathologists in issues like these. Typically, a commonly used tool to assess the degree of severity of dysphagia and speech issues is the Barnes Jewish Hospital Stroke Dysphagia Screen, which offers a validated guide to assessing plan of action (solid food diet, all liquid diet, IV hydration, etc.) for the patient while in the hospital and the proper course of action in the outpatient setting. Rehabilitation in Wallenberg&#x27;s Syndrome focuses on improving balance, coordination, working on activities of daily living, and improving speech and swallowing function. Severe nausea and vertigo can be present and limit progress in rehabilitation and recovery. Symptomatic treatment with anti-emetics and medications for the hiccups are important. Commonly used anti-emetics include ondansetron, metoclopramide, prochlorperazine, and promethazine. These medications are also used to treat hiccups, along with chlorpromazine. There are case reports of other medications useful in treating hiccups in Wallenberg&#x27;s Syndrome including baclofen and anti-epileptic medications. The prognosis for someone with lateral medullary syndrome depends upon the size and location of damaged area of the brain stem. Some individuals recover quickly while others may have significant neurological disabilities for months to years after the initial injury.

==Post-stroke depression==

Depression is a commonly reported consequence of stroke and is seen in 25–50% of patients. The &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual&quot; (DSM-IV-TR) defines post-stroke depression as &quot;a mood disorder due to a general medical condition (i.e. stroke) that is judged to be due to the direct physiological effects of [that] condition&quot;. Post-stroke depression may involve depressed mood and decreased interest and pleasure that impairs social and occupational functioning, but does not necessarily need to meet the full criteria of a major depressive disorder.

The first studies to look for an association between specific stroke lesions and the occurrence of depression reported a correlation between left frontal lesions and major depression. Damage to the frontal noradrenergic, dopaminergic, and serotonergic projections were thought to cause a depletion of catecholamines, leading to depression. However, more recent studies have demonstrated that the anatomic aspects of a lesion do not necessarily correlate with the occurrence of depression. Other psychological factors can lead to the development of depression including personal and social losses related to the physical disabilities often caused by a stroke.

The incidence of post-stroke depression peaks at 3–6 months and usually resolves within 1–2 years after the stroke, although a minority of patients can go on to develop chronic depression. The diagnosis of post-stroke depression is complicated by other consequences of stroke such as fatigue and psychomotor retardation – which do not necessarily indicate the presence of depression. Loss of interest in activities and relationships should prompt an evaluation for depression.

Traditionally, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), such as nortriptyline, have been used in the treatment of post-stroke depression. More recently, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as fluoxetine and citalopram, have become the pharmacologic therapy of choice due to the lower incidence of side effects. Also, psychologic treatment such as cognitive behavioral therapy, group therapy, and family therapy are reported to be useful adjuncts to treatment.

Overall, the development of post-stroke depression can play a significant role in a patient&#x27;s recovery from a stroke. The severity of post-stroke depression has been associated with severity of impairment in activities of daily living (ADLs). By effectively treating depression, patients experience a greater recovery of basic ADLs such as dressing, eating and ambulating, as well as instrumental ADLs, such as the ability to take care of financial and household matters. In essence, recognition and treatment of post-stroke depression leads to greater functional ability for the patient over time.

== Cognitive Impairment and Therapy ==
Cognitive impairment is indisputably one of the biggest threats following stroke. The prevalence of cognitive impairment is quite high, however it varies based on the population within which the stroke has occurred. Many different causes can contribute to the acquirement of cognitive impairment after stroke. Among the most common are lesions on specific anatomical structures, such as the hippocampus or entorhinal cortex, white matter lesions, and cerebral microbleeds. The extent and type of cognitive impairment depend on the area of the brain affected by the stroke. However, in general, most cognitive impairment always includes either memory, attention, language, or orientation problems.

There has not been any medication developed yet to treat cognitive deficits resulting from strokes. Although some drugs have shown to be helpful with executive function problems, neither of them has demonstrated significant effects on activities of daily living. Thus, it is important that more work is done on pharmacotherapy and its potential benefits for patients with cognitive decline after stroke.

Ongoing research has examined the use of cognitive therapy which consists of intense cognitive training. One of the biggest problems of cognitive training is its actual transfer to the real world. Even though some therapies have been proven to produce improvements on specific tasks, the patients did not experience any improvements in their everyday functioning. For this reason, scientific teams have been trying to develop a reliable transfer package that could be used to train and improve instrumental activities of daily living. Daily instrumental activities can be understood as those activities that allow an individual to live independently. Even though they are not necessary for living, however, these activities may significantly improve the quality of life. Examples of these activities include cooking, transportation, laundry, and managing finances.

<text>Postumius Rufius Festus Avienius (sometimes erroneously Avienus) was a Latin writer of the 4th century AD. He was a native of Volsinii in Etruria, from the distinguished family of the Rufii Festi.

Avienius is not identical with the historian Festus.
== Background==
Avienius made a free translation into Latin of Aratus&#x27; didactic poem &quot;Phaenomena&quot;. He also took a popular Greek poem in hexameters, &quot;Periegesis,&quot; briefly delimiting the habitable world from the perspective of Alexandria, written by Dionysius Periegetes in a terse and elegant style that was easy to memorize for students, and translated it into an archaising Latin as his &quot;Descriptio orbis terrae&quot; (&quot;Description of the World&#x27;s Lands&quot;). Only Book I survives, with an unsteady grasp of actual geography and some far-fetched etymologies: see Ophiussa.

He wrote &quot;Ora Maritima&quot;, a poem claimed to contain borrowings from the 6th-century BC &quot;Massiliote Periplus&quot;. Avienius also served as governor of Achaia and Africa.

According to legend, when asked what he did in the country, he answered &quot;Prandeo, poto, cano, ludo, lavo, caeno, quiesco&quot;:

However this quote is a misattribution and likely comes from the works of Martial.

<text>A pastry fork, dessert fork, pie fork or cake fork is a fork designed for eating pastries and other desserts from a plate. The fork has three or four tines. The three-tine fork has a larger, flattened and beveled tine on the side while the four-tine fork has the first and second tine connected or bridged together and beveled.

Pastry forks range in size from (in English pastry fork sets) to as serving pieces in silverware (sterling and silver plate) place settings. In many fine place settings, the pastry fork and pie fork may be two separate forks as well.

It is typically designed so that it can be used with the right hand, while the left hand holds the plate. It therefore has the left side widened to be used like a knife to cut the food when pressed down on the plate. Left-handed pastry forks have the right side widened instead.

Anna M. Mangin was awarded a patent on March 1, 1892, for a pastry fork for mixing pastry dough.

<text>Antonio Fernós Isern (May 10, 1895 – January 19, 1974) was the first Puerto Rican cardiologist and the longest serving Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico in the United States Congress.

==Early years==
Fernós Isern was born in San Lorenzo, Puerto Rico, and attended primary and intermediate schools in Caguas. His family moved to Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania, during his mid-year in high school. He finished his high school education in the Pennsylvania State Normal School. After completing his pre-medical training, he applied and was accepted to the College of Physicians and Surgeons of the University of Maryland, College Park and earned his doctor&#x27;s degree in May 1915.

Fernós Isern returned to the island and settled in the city of Caguas where he practiced medicine for two years. Between the years 1918 and 1933 he held various administrative positions in the health services of Puerto Rico. In 1918, he was the Director for the City of San Juan. From 1919 to 1921, Fernós Isern was the Under-Secretary of Health. From 1921 to 1923, he was the Director of Health in the city. From 1923 to 1929, Fernós Isern was once again Under-Secretary of Health. He was the Secretary of Health from 1930 to 1933.

==First Puerto Rican cardiologist==
In 1933, Fernós Isern resigned as health commissioner and went to New York City where he completed his residency in cardiology at Columbia University and thus became the first Puerto Rican cardiologist. Upon his later return to Puerto Rico, Fernós Isern became a professor at the Public School of Tropical Medicine of Puerto Rico. He had previously served as both assistant professor and associate professor at this institution.

==Political career==

In 1937, Fernós Isern joined Luis Muñoz Marín to organize the Partido Popular Democrático (Popular Democratic Party). In 1941, he served as the Director of Civil Defense for the San Juan Metropolitan Area. In 1942, he returned to head the Department of Health and the Administration of Public Housing, in addition to serving as Director of the War Effort Office for Puerto Rico. From 1943 to 1946, Fernós Isern was also the acting governor of Puerto Rico during the Governorship of Rexford G. Tugwell, under appointment as Permanent Acting Governor approved by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

==Resident Commissioner==
In 1946, Jesús T. Piñero, the first Puerto Rican to serve as governor of Puerto Rico, appointed Fernós Isern as his replacement in the position of Resident Commissioner to the U.S. Congress after unanimous endorsement from the island legislature. Fernós Isern was re-elected on four consecutive occasions, serving a total of nineteen years. As Resident Commissioner, Fernós Isern played a very important role in convincing the Government of the United States to give Puerto Ricans the right to govern their island. In 1947, the Crawford Project, allowing Puerto Ricans to elect their governor, was approved by Congress and signed into law by President Harry S Truman.

On June 8, 1950, the United States Senate approved Public Law 600, permitting Puerto Rico to establish its own constitutional local autonomous government. Fernós Isern served as president of the Constitutional Convention which drafted the Constitution of the Commonwealth (Estado Libre Asociado).

==Later years==
Fernós Isern did not seek re-election in 1964. He returned to Puerto Rico from Washington, D.C., and was elected to the Puerto Rican Senate, serving between 1965 and 1969. After he retired from politics, Fernós Isern returned to the University of Puerto Rico as Resident Scholar where he wrote a monumental political work, in two parts, i.e., &quot;El Estado Libre Asociado&quot; (The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico) and &quot;Filosofía y Doctrina del Estadolibrismo (Philosophy and Doctrine of the Puerto Rican Commonwealth)&quot;.

Fernós Isern died in San Juan, Puerto Rico, on January 19, 1974, and was buried with full state honors in the Santa María Magdalena de Pazzis Cemetery located in Old San Juan, Puerto Rico.

==Legacy==
His memory is honored at the Capitol in San Juan with a bust facing the urn preserving the original Constitution of Puerto Rico. His collected papers are held in trust at the Fernós Isern room at the Inter American University Law School in Hato Rey, San Juan.

<text>The Atlas languages are a subgroup of the Northern Berber languages of the Afro-Asiatic language family spoken in the Atlas Mountains of Morocco. By mutual intelligibility, they are a single language spoken by perhaps 14 million people; however, they are distinct sociolinguistically and are considered separate languages by the Royal institute of the Amazigh culture.

<doc id="1035482" wikidata="Q477145" url="?curid=1035482" title="Mount Eden">
<text>Mount Eden is a suburb in Auckland, New Zealand whose name honours George Eden, 1st Earl of Auckland. It is south of the Central Business District (CBD). Mt Eden Road winds its way around the side of Mount Eden Domain and continues to weave back and forth as it descends into the valley; it runs south from Eden Terrace to Three Kings. Mt Eden village centre is located roughly between Valley Road and Grange Road. The domain is accessible on foot from many of the surrounding streets, and by vehicle from Mt Eden Road. The central focus of the suburb is Maungawhau / Mount Eden, a dormant volcano whose summit is the highest natural point on the Auckland isthmus.

==History==

===Pre-European===
In pre-European times Mount Eden was utilised as a fortified hill pā by various Māori iwi (tribes). The pā is thought to have been abandoned around 1700 AD after conflict between the resident Waiohua people and the Hauraki tribes The earth ramparts and terraces from this period contribute to the distinctive outline of the hill today.

===European settlement===
Following a gift of land from Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei Mount Eden began being subdivided and sold off to settlers in 1841. The land was mostly used for farming to support the Borough of Auckland. Due to population growth in Auckland Mount Eden would start having suburban development in the late 1800s. In 1873, Alfred Cucksey established a store in what would later become Mount Eden Village.

The Colonial Ammunition Company, first formed in 1885, was based at Mount Eden. The steel Mount Eden Shot Tower, completed in 1914, was the major supplier of ammunition in New Zealand until World War II, and was classified as a Category I heritage building by Heritage New Zealand in 1983.

Mount Eden developed from a rural and agricultural area to a suburban one between 1840 and the 20th century. Access to the water supply of the City of Auckland, piped gas from Auckland, and electric trams were some of the main driving factors behind the urbanisation of the area. By 1895 cattle driving was outlawed in the area. By 1930 the last large block of land was subdivided.

Mount Eden is now a &quot;leafy suburb&quot; consisting predominantly of large houses from the first half of the 20th century, many with verdant gardens and large trees. In the 19th century, on the eastern slopes of Mt Eden were constructed several large country houses set in extensive grounds. These included &quot;Harewood House&quot; (since demolished and now the site of the Mater Hospital), Justice Gillies &quot;Rocklands Hall&quot; (now a hostel), Alfred Buckland&#x27;s &quot;Highwic&quot; (now a museum), the Hellaby family&#x27;s &quot;Florence Court&quot;, Josiah Clifton Firth&#x27;s &quot;Clifton House&quot; (both still private residences) and Professor Sir Algernon Thomas&#x27; &quot;Trewithiel&quot; (the garden is partially preserved in Withiel Thomas Reserve and the reduced house at 114 Mountain Road). Close by the current Government House (the official Auckland residence of the Governor General) is Eden Garden, an ornamental public garden set up in a disused quarry.
In the 1950s and 1960s the inner suburbs became unfashionable and the old houses of the Mt Eden area were comparatively cheap to buy. Mt Eden developed a slightly bohemian image during this time as a community of artists, writers, teachers and university lecturers made it their home. Mt Eden village is still regarded by many as the &quot;Home Of Arts&quot; in Auckland, due to the large amount of creative activity in and around the suburb and the large number of artists who live nearby.

The Presbyterian Boys&#x27; Hostel at 22 View Road is a historic building that became the first home for many young men, who moved to Auckland to train in government and industry at low rates of pay.

===Transport===

In Mt Eden, the plentiful supply of volcanic stone (a suitable material for building roads), as well as the ready supply of labourers from the Mt Eden Prison, allowed for a progressive development of early roads, many of which still exist today as main arterial routes. Early roads were metal or made from scoria. Toll gates were established on several main roads, including Mt Eden Road and Dominion Road, during the 19th century in order to help pay for their upkeep.

Public transportation extended from the inner city to the surrounding areas in the late 1870s and early 1880s with horse-drawn buses being the first mode of regular public transportation in the late 1870s. In 1881, a railway opened that connected Newmarket to Helensville and stopped in Mt Eden. At the beginning of the 20th century, trams began connecting Mt. Eden, Balmoral, Kingsland, and Mt Albert with the city. The trams ran for the last time in the 1950s. Trams were replaced with trolley buses. The trolley buses were replaced with diesel buses in the 1970s.

===Local government===
Mt Eden falls within the Epsom constituencies for the national Parliament. In terms of local government, Mt Eden comes under the Albert-Eden Local Board, of Auckland Council.

During the 19th century, the planning and maintenance of the main arterial roads (Mt Eden Road and Dominion Road) provided the impetus to form local governing bodies in the area. The Mt Eden Highway Board held its first meeting in 1868; it covered the area of Mt Eden, Eden Valley, Sandringham, and Balmoral. At the time, it was responsible for building and maintaining the roads and dealing with the pigs, horses, cattle, and sheep that freely roamed the area. In 1882 it became the Mt Eden Road Board. In 1906 Mt Eden gained borough status and the Mt Eden Borough Council was formed. In 1989 the Borough Council amalgamated with Auckland City Council in a nationwide local government reorganisation. And in November 2010, the City Council was dissolved and was incorporated into the new larger Auckland Council.

===Housing===
Housing in Mount Eden ranges from 19th century Victorian villas to modern apartments. Mount Eden&#x27;s continual development has resulted in a range of types of homes. Some areas such as around Balmoral Road predominantly features villas whereas areas further from the Auckland city centre are comprised primarily of bungalows. The majority of early homes are wooden but two stone homes are still extant. Most of the early homes were constructed from kauri, matai, and totara. King Edward Street and Burnley Terrace have special heritage protections due to their Victorian and Edwardian villas that have remained mostly the same for over a century.

During the 1870s many middle class residents left the urban central city for areas such as Mount Eden due to a desire for healthier living conditions. Many large homesteads were built around this time, although few survive.

Homes in the 20th century were built with a mix of styles including Arts and Crafts, modernism, and Spanish Mission. Traditionally homes were standalone but during the interwar period apartment blocks started being built. Multi unit homes were built more frequently after WW2 but were often derided due to lacking architectural merit. The construction of a high rise apartment around the base of Mount Eden led to restrictions on building height to preserve views of the mountain. The desirability of the area and protections for existing buildings has led to many non-residential buildings being converted into apartments. Notable examples include the former council chambers and fire station and the Mt Eden Congregational Church.

===Economy===
Initially Mt Eden&#x27;s economy was based upon agricultural and small shops that serviced residents. With the railway connection in the 1880s industrial businesses start popping up although Mt Eden remained rural. The most notable industrial business was the Colonial Ammunition Company which was formed in 1888 by Major John Whitney. In the 1960s Mount Eden&#x27;s economy was primarily timber working, engineering products, and warehousing. These manufacturing industries have been gradually shutting down, with former sites being developed into residential housing.

<text>The Zenati languages are a branch of the Northern Berber language family of North Africa. They were named after the medieval Zenata Berber tribal confederation. They were first proposed in the works of French linguist Edmond Destaing (1915) (1920–23). Zenata dialects are distributed across the central Berber world (Maghreb), from northeastern Morocco to just west of Algiers, and the northern Sahara, from southwestern Algeria around Bechar to Zuwara in Libya. The most widely spoken Zenati languages are Tmazight of the Rif in northern Morocco and Tashawit Berber in northeastern Algeria, each of which have over 3 million speakers.

==Languages==

===Kossmann (2013)===
According to Kossmann (2013: 21–24), Zenati is a rather arbitrary grouping, in which he includes the following varieties:
* Riffian (Riffian Berber, or Rif-Berber, local name: &quot;Tmaziɣt&quot;, north of Morocco); Includes Arzew dialect, in Arzew in western Algeria
*Eastern Morocco Zenati (north east of Morocco)
* Iznasen
* Eastern Middle Atlas: Ait Seghrouchen and a group of dialects including Ait Warain (Ayt Warayn) (north-central Morocco)
*Western Algerian, west of Algiers (a diffuse group):
**Beni Snous (Tlemcen) dialect, in western Algeria near the border
**Jebel Bissa (intelligible with Shenwa)
**Shenwa (Chenoua), between Tipasa and Ténès in north-central Algeria west of Algiers
**Beni Messaoud (Shenwa?)
**Beni Menacer
**Metmata (of Algeria; distinct from Matmata Berber of Tunisia)
**etc. (see article)
* Shawiya (Chaouia), around Batna and Khenchela, south of Constantine in northeastern Algeria
*Mzab–Wargla (Northern Saharan oases):
** South Oran and Figuig, in the ksours along the Algerian–Moroccan border and in Figuig in southeastern Morocco
** Gourara Berber (Taznatit) (Gourara, southwestern Algeria, around Timimoun)
** Tidikelt and Tuat (Touat, Algeria)
** Mozabite aka &quot;Mzab, Tumzabt&quot; (northern Algerian Sahara, near Ghardaia)
** Wargla (Ouargli aka &quot;Tagergrent, Teggargarent&quot;), northern Algerian Sahara, near Ouargla
** Oued Righ Berber (incl. Touggourt; Ethnologue name &quot;Temacine Tamazight&quot;) in Oued Righ, around Touggourt and Temacine, Algeria
* Southeastern Tunisian–Libyan: Djerbi (island of Djerba), Douiret (Douiret in southern Tunisia), Matmata Berber (Matmata), Sened and Zuwara Berber (Zuwara in northwestern Libya)

==Features==
According to Kossmann (1999:31-32, 86, 172), common innovations defining the Zenati languages include:
* The vowel &quot;a-&quot; in nominal prefixes is dropped in a number of words when it precedes CV, where C is a single consonant and V is a full (non-schwa) vowel. For example, &quot;afus&quot; &quot;hand&quot; is replaced with &quot;fus&quot;. (A similar development is found in some Eastern Berber languages, but not Nafusi.)
* Verbs whose original aorist forms end in &quot;-u&quot; while their perfect forms end in &quot;-a&quot; end up with &quot;-a&quot; in the aorist as well, leaving the aorist / perfect distinction unmarked for these verbs. For example, *&quot;ktu&quot; &quot;forget&quot;, Siwi &quot;ttu&quot;, becomes Ouargli &quot;tta&quot;. (This also affects Nafusi.)
* Verbs consisting (in the aorist) of two consonants with no vowel other than schwa fall into two classes elsewhere in Berber: one where a variable final vowel appears in the perfect form, and one which continues to lack a final vowel in the perfect. In Zenati, the latter class has been entirely merged into the former in the perfect, with the single exception of the negative perfect of *&quot;əɣ s&quot; &quot;want&quot;. For example, Kabyle (non-Zenati) &quot;gər&quot; &quot;throw&quot;, pf. &quot;-gər&quot; (int. &quot;-ggar&quot;), corresponds to Ouargli (Zenati) &quot;gər&quot;, pf. &quot;-gru&quot;. (This change too also affects Nafusi; Basset (1929:9) gives examples where it appears not to occur in Chenoua.)
* Proto-Berber *&quot;-əβ&quot; has become &quot;-i&quot; in Zenati. For example, *&quot;arəβ&quot; &quot;write&quot; becomes &quot;ari&quot;. (This change also occurs in varieties including the Central Atlas Tamazight dialect of the Izayan, Nafusi, and Siwi.)
* Proto-Berber palatalised &quot;k´&quot; and &quot;g´&quot;, corresponding to &quot;k&quot; and &quot;g&quot; in non-Zenati varieties, become &quot;š&quot; and &quot;ž&quot; in Zenati (although a fair number of irregular correspondences for this are found.) For example, &quot;k´ăm&quot; &quot;you (f. sg.)&quot; becomes &quot;šəm&quot;. (This change also occurs in Nafusi and Siwi.)

In addition to the correspondence of &quot;k&quot; and &quot;g&quot; to &quot;š&quot; and &quot;ž&quot;, Chaker (1972), while expressing uncertainty about the linguistic coherence of Zenati, notes as shared Zenati traits:
* A proximal demonstrative suffix &quot;this&quot; &quot;-u&quot;, rather than &quot;-a&quot;
* A final &quot;-u&quot; in the perfect of two-consonant verbs, rather than &quot;-a&quot; (e.g. &quot;yə-nsu&quot; &quot;he slept&quot; rather than &quot;yə-nsa&quot; elsewhere)
These characteristics identify a more restricted subset of Berber than those previously mentioned, mainly northern Saharan varieties; they exclude, for example, Chaoui and all but the easternmost Rif dialects.

<text>Truth or dare? is a mostly verbal party game requiring two or more players. Players are given the choice between answering a question truthfully, or performing a &quot;&quot;. The game is particularly popular among adolescents and children, and is sometimes used as a when gambling.

== History ==
The game has existed for hundreds of years, with at least one variant, &quot;questions and commands&quot;, being attested as early as 1712:

Truth or dare may ultimately derive from command games such as the ancient Greek basilinda (in Greek: βασιλίνδα). This game is described by Julius Pollux: &quot;in which we are told a king, elected by lot, commanded his comrades what they should perform&quot;.

<text>The Mzab–Wargla languages or Northern Saharan oasis dialects are a dialect cluster of the Zenati languages, within the Northern Berber subbranch. They are spoken in scattered oases of Algeria and Morocco.

== Subclassification==
;Kossmann (2013)

Maarten Kossmann (2013) listed six &quot;Northern Saharan oasis&quot; dialects:
*South Oranie and Figuig
*Gurara
*Tuwat-Tidikelt
*Mzab
*Wargla
*Wad Righ (Tugurt)

;Ethnologue (2009)
In &quot;Ethnologue&quot; XVI (2009), the &quot;Mzab–Wargla&quot; languages are listed as:
*Tagargrent (Wargli)
*Temacine Tamazight (Tugurt)
*Taznatit (&quot;Zenati&quot;: Gurara, Tuwat and South Oran)
*Tumzabt (Mozabite)
Unlike Kossmann, &quot;Ethnologue&quot; considers the Berber dialect spoken in Tidikelt as a separate branch of the Zenati group, distinct from Tuwat.

;Blench
Roger Blench (2006) listed eight varieties:
*Gurara
*Mzab, Ghardaia (Mozabite)
*Wargla
*Tugurt
*Seghrušen
*Figuig
*Senhaja
*Iznacen

However, Senhaja is actually an Atlas language.

<doc id="1035505" wikidata="Q5879376" url="?curid=1035505" title="Pool Sharks">
<text>Pool Sharks (also sometimes known as The Pool Shark) is a 1915 silent short film. The film is notable for being the film acting and writing debut of W. C. Fields and also features early instances of stop-motion animation during a game of pool.

==Plot summary==
Following a standard style of the era, the film is a romantic slapstick comedy short. Fields and his rival (played by Bud Ross) vie over the affections of a woman (played by Marian West). When their antics get out of hand at a picnic, it is decided that they should play a game of pool. Both of them are pool sharks, and after the game turns into a farce, a fight ensues. Fields throws a ball at his rival, who ducks. The ball flies through the window and breaks a hanging goldfish bowl, soaking the woman they are fighting over and leaving goldfish in her hair. She storms into the pool hall and rejects both men.

==Production==
It was one of two short films Fields made for a company called Gaumont, distributed by Mutual. He and Ross made another short around the same time, &quot;His Lordship&#x27;s Dilemma.&quot;

===Casting===
Fields helped make this film in New York City, taking time off from the Ziegfeld Follies, as publicity for the film pointed out. Vaudeville was Fields&#x27; primary vocation, and after completing &quot;Pool Sharks&quot; and &quot;His Lordship&#x27;s Dilemma&quot; it would be nine years before he made his next known film, 1924&#x27;s &quot;Janice Meredith&quot;.

Fields wore his obviously fake moustache in this film, as he did in all of his silent films. His character and mannerisms bear some resemblance to Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s, although the persona Fields later developed in his sound comedies is foreshadowed during the picnic scene, when Fields&#x27;s character dumps a small child out of a chair so that he can steal it to get closer to the woman he is chasing.

===Animation===

Fields was an expert juggler. As with his early films, &quot;Pool Sharks&quot; was intended to highlight a pool ball juggling act that featured in the actor&#x27;s vaudeville show. In the final film, however, there is only a brief shot of Fields juggling several billiard balls, as his act was largely replaced with several poorly edited stop motion sequences depicting impossible shots, such as the balls jumping off the table and re-racking themselves on the wall. Though innovative for the time, they are poorly animated, with obvious edits, and the animator&#x27;s hand can actually be seen moving the balls along in one of the frames.

==Reaction==
Today, &quot;Pool Sharks&quot; is best remembered as Fields&#x27; first film effort. Film historian William K. Everson critiques the film as an &quot;auspicious debut&quot;, with Fields&#x27; routines and pacing already finely honed.

<text>Radiopharmacology is radiochemistry applied to medicine and thus the pharmacology of radiopharmaceuticals (medicinal radiocompounds, that is, pharmaceutical drugs that are radioactive). Radiopharmaceuticals are used in the field of nuclear medicine as radioactive tracers in medical imaging and in therapy for many diseases (for example, brachytherapy). Many radiopharmaceuticals use technetium-99m (Tc-99m) which has many useful properties as a gamma-emitting tracer nuclide. In the book &quot;Technetium&quot; a total of 31 different radiopharmaceuticals based on Tc-99m are listed for imaging and functional studies of the brain, myocardium, thyroid, lungs, liver, gallbladder, kidneys, skeleton, blood and tumors.

The term &quot;radioisotope&quot;, which in its general sense refers to any radioactive isotope (radionuclide), has historically been used to refer to all radiopharmaceuticals, and this usage remains common. Technically, however, many radiopharmaceuticals incorporate a radioactive tracer atom into a larger pharmaceutically-active molecule, which is localized in the body, after which the radionuclide tracer atom allows it to be easily detected with a gamma camera or similar gamma imaging device. An example is fludeoxyglucose in which fluorine-18 is incorporated into deoxyglucose. Some radioisotopes (for example gallium-67, gallium-68, and radioiodine) are used directly as soluble ionic salts, without further modification. This use relies on the chemical and biological properties of the radioisotope itself, to localize it within the body.

==History==
See nuclear medicine.

==Production==

Production of a radiopharmaceutical involves two processes:

* The production of the radionuclide on which the pharmaceutical is based.
* The preparation and packaging of the complete radiopharmaceutical.

Radionuclides used in radiopharmaceuticals are mostly radioactive isotopes of elements with atomic numbers less than that of bismuth, that is, they are radioactive isotopes of elements that also have one or more stable isotopes. These may be roughly divided into two classes:

* Those with more neutrons in the nucleus than those required for stability are known as proton-deficient, and tend to be most easily produced in a nuclear reactor. The majority of radiopharmaceuticals are based on proton deficient isotopes, with technetium-99m being the most commonly used medical isotope, and therefore nuclear reactors are the prime source of medical radioisotopes.
* Those with fewer neutrons in the nucleus than those required for stability are known as neutron-deficient, and tend to be most easily produced using a proton accelerator such as a medical cyclotron.

== Practical use ==
Because radiopharmeuticals require special licenses and handling techniques, they are often kept in local centers for medical radioisotope storage, often known as radiopharmacies. A radiopharmacist may dispense them from there, to local centers where they are handled at the practical medicine facility.

==Drug nomenclature for radiopharmaceuticals==
As with other pharmaceutical drugs, there is standardization of the drug nomenclature for radiopharmaceuticals, although various standards coexist. The International Nonproprietary Name (INN) gives the base drug name, followed by the radioisotope (as mass number, no space, element symbol) in parentheses with no superscript, followed by the ligand (if any). It is common to see square brackets and superscript superimposed onto the INN name, because chemical nomenclature (such as IUPAC nomenclature) uses those. The United States Pharmacopeia (USP) name gives the base drug name, followed by the radioisotope (as element symbol, space, mass number) with no parentheses, no hyphen, and no superscript, followed by the ligand (if any). The USP style is not the INN style, despite their being described as one and the same in some publications (e.g., &quot;AMA,&quot; whose style for radiopharmaceuticals matches the USP style). The United States Pharmacopeial Convention is a sponsor organization of the USAN Council, and the USAN for a given drug is often the same as the USP name.

<text>&#x27; (Latin for &quot;Marine map and description of the Northern lands&quot;; commonly abbreviated &#x27;) is the first map of the Nordic countries to give details and place names, created by Swedish ecclesiastic Olaus Magnus and initially published in 1539. Only two earlier maps of the Nordic countries are known, those of Jacob Ziegler (Strasbourg, 1532) and Claudius Clavus (15th century).

The map is centered on Scandia, which is shown in the largest size text on the map and placed on the middle of Sweden. The map covers the Nordic lands of &quot;Svecia&quot; (Svealand) and &quot;Gothia&quot; (Götaland) (both areas in Sweden), &quot;Norvegia&quot; (Norway), Dania (Denmark), Islandia (Iceland), Finlandia (Finland), Lituania (Lithuania) and Livonia (Estonia and Latvia). The map is framed with longitudes and latitudes running from 55° to the Arctic Circle.

The 1.70 m wide by 1.25 m tall map was printed in black and white from nine 55x40 cm woodcut blocks sequenced from west to east and north to south and identified in the center with the letters A through I.

==History==
The map was created in Rome during 1527–39 by Olaus Magnus (1490–1557), who arrived on a diplomatic visit for the Swedish government and stayed on, likely because his brother Johannes Magnus became involved in a religious feud with King Gustav I of Sweden.

To construct the map, Magnus drew from a variety of ancient sources including Ptolemy&#x27;s map in &quot;Geographia&quot;, and contemporary sources such as the work of Astronomer Jacob Ziegler. In addition to cartographic sources, Magnus also relied on the descriptions of sailors and his own observations.

It took 12 years to make and the first copies were printed in 1539 in Venice.

Olaus complemented the map with &quot;Historia de gentibus septentrionalibus&quot; (&quot;A description of the Northern peoples&quot;) printed in Rome, 1555. These Latin notes were translated by Olaus into Italian (1565) and German (1567).

==Surviving copies==

All of the original map&#x27;s copies passed out of public knowledge after 1574, and the map was largely forgotten – perhaps because few copies were printed and Pope Paul III asserted a 10-year &quot;copyright.&quot; It was later widely questioned whether the map had ever existed.

In 1886, Oscar Brenner found a copy at the &quot;Hof- und Staatsbibliothek&quot; in Munich, where it currently resides. In 1961, another copy was found in Switzerland, brought to Sweden the following year by the Uppsala University Library; as of 2007 it is stored there at the Carolina Rediviva library. The copies differ slightly from each other.

==Adaptations==
A downscaled adaptation of the &#x27;Uppsala&#x27; copy or similar was printed in Rome by Antoine Lafréry in 1572.

He has edited and written various comic books, the first of which was &quot;Bad Planet&quot;. He made his directorial debut with the crime thriller &quot;Dark Country&quot; (2009), in which he also starred.

==Early life and education==
Thomas Elliott III was born on February 22, 1969, in Baltimore, Maryland, the son of Cynthia (&quot;née&quot; Jane), an antiques dealer, and Thomas Elliott, Jr., a genetic engineer. He later changed his name to Thomas Jane. 

He attended Thomas Sprigg Wootton High School but dropped out and started taking acting classes while working at a hardware store. He later moved to Hollywood to pursue an acting career. He was initially homeless and lived out of his car, often doing street performances to earn money: &quot;I had two songs in my repertoire that I hammered to death, &#x27;Hey Joe&#x27; and &#x27;Knockin&#x27; on Heaven&#x27;s Door&#x27;. People used to pelt me with change just to shut me up.&quot;

==Career==
Jane began his acting career in 1986 at age 17 after his acting coach suggested he audition for the lead male role opposite Vijayashanti in the Indian romantic comedy &quot;Padamati Sandhya Ragam&quot; (1987), which was being filmed in the Washington metropolitan area. As a result, he spent eight months filming including six months in India. The production ran out of money to pay him, so the actor was given an RV used in the film which he sold to finance his move to Hollywood.

After arriving in Hollywood, Jane&#x27;s early roles included Zeph in &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; (1992), directed by Fran Rubel Kuzui, and the film &quot;Nemesis&quot; (1992). He also had supporting roles in several high-profile films, including &quot;The Crow: City of Angels&quot; (1996), &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; (1997), &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot; (1998), &quot;Thursday&quot; (1998), and &quot;Magnolia&quot; (1999). After receiving critical acclaim as baseball player Mickey Mantle in &quot;61*&quot;, Jane received offers for leading roles beginning with Andre Stander in the South African film &quot;Stander&quot; (2003), for which he gained further critical acclaim.

Along with director Jonathan Hensleigh and Avi Arad, Jane has said he was the first and only actor to be asked to play the title role in the film &quot;The Punisher&quot; (2004). He turned down the role twice, as he did not have much interest in the superhero genre. When they asked him the second time to play the Punisher, Tim Bradstreet&#x27;s artwork of the character secured his interest. After finding out that the character was not a traditional superhero, but more of an antihero and a vigilante crime fighter, he accepted, became a fan, then trained for several months with Navy SEALs, gaining more than of muscle.

In addition to starring in the film, he contributed his voice to the video games &quot;The Punisher&quot; and &quot;Gun&quot;. He also co-owns RAW, an entertainment company which he runs with Steve Niles and Tim Bradstreet. RAW Studios, the company&#x27;s comic-book division, released &quot;Bad Planet&quot; (written by Jane) through Image Comics. Jane became a spokesperson for Niles and the cover model for comic-book character Cal McDonald in 2006. In addition to his screen work, Jane has appeared several times on stage, and received strong critical reviews as Tom in Tennessee Williams&#x27; &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot;, and as Chris in Arthur Miller&#x27;s &quot;All My Sons&quot;. He has also portrayed a fictionalized version of himself in an episode of the television series &quot;Arrested Development&quot;.

Jane did not return in the planned sequel to &quot;The Punisher&quot;. Lions Gate Entertainment had approved a direct sequel due to the strong sales of the film on DVD. However, the project lingered in development for over three years. Jonathan Hensleigh completed a first draft of the script before leaving the project in 2006. John Dahl was in talks to direct the film, but cited his dislike of the script and the reduced budget as his reasons for refusing. In a statement on May 15, 2007, and in two audio interviews, Jane said that he pulled out of the project due to creative differences and the studio&#x27;s further reduction of the budget.

Jane said in June 2007 that Zack Snyder had expressed interest in casting him for the role of the Comedian for the adaptation of Alan Moore&#x27;s graphic novel &quot;Watchmen&quot;, but because he was too busy, he turned down the role, which was eventually given to Jeffrey Dean Morgan. The same year he starred in Frank Darabont&#x27;s adaptation of the Stephen King novella, &quot;The Mist&quot;. His directorial debut was the 2009 film &quot;Dark Country&quot;, in which he also played the main character. In 2009, Jane starred with Ving Rhames in the crime film &quot;Give &#x27;Em Hell, Malone&quot;, which premiered at San Diego Comic-Con.

On December 18, 2008, HBO announced it was picking up the black comedy &quot;Hung&quot;, and Jane was contracted to star in the show. He plays the character of Ray Drecker, a high-school history teacher and basketball coach, who after attending a self-help class while being down on his luck, decides to market the large size of his penis as a path to success. The series was renewed for a second season, which aired in the summer of 2010. The show was renewed for a final season, which aired in fall of 2011.

Jane appeared on the June/July 2010 cover of &quot;Men&#x27;s Fitness&quot; magazine. He voiced the character Jonah Hex in an animated short as a companion piece on the Special Edition Blu-ray and two-disc Special Edition DVD release of &quot;&quot;.

On June 7, 2012, Jane released a digital EP, &quot;Don&#x27;t Come Home&quot;, under the pseudonym Rusty Blades. At the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con, Jane debuted an independently financed &quot;Punisher&quot; short film, &quot;Dirty Laundry&quot;, directed by Phil Joanou and co-starring Ron Perlman.

On February 1, 2017, Syfy began a two-episode debut of the second season of its critically acclaimed &quot;murder mystery in space&quot;, &quot;The Expanse&quot;. Jane portrays the lead role of Detective Joe Miller in this futuristic saga, in which humans have colonized both Mars and the Asteroid Belt. The series premiered December 2015, and continued through six seasons, with Jane appearing in the first four of them.

Jane co-starred in Shane Black&#x27;s &quot;The Predator&quot; (2018), a direct sequel to the 1987 film &quot;Predator&quot; and the 1990 film &quot;Predator 2&quot;.

Jane plays a lead role in the Australian crime drama series &quot;Troppo&quot;, the first season of which aired in 2022 and the second in 2024. 

In August 2024, actor Jon Bernthal revealed that he trained with Thomas Jane to prepare for his role in the Disney+ series &quot;&quot;. The collaboration, which brought together two actors known for portraying the Punisher, highlights Jane&#x27;s continued influence in the action genre. 

==Personal life==
In 1989, Jane married actress Aysha Hauer, daughter of Rutger Hauer. They divorced in 1995.

After meeting through mutual friends in 2001, Jane and actress Patricia Arquette became engaged in 2002 and had a daughter together before marrying on June 25, 2006, at the Palazzo Contarini del Bovolo in Venice, Italy. In January 2009, Arquette filed for divorce from Jane on the grounds of irreconcilable differences, but the couple reconciled and Arquette sought to abandon the divorce petition six months later. However, they proceeded with the divorce, which was finalized on July 1, 2011. The pair were granted joint custody of their child.

Jane and former &quot;Hung&quot; co-star Anne Heche announced that they were in a relationship in 2019; however, they had separated by the time of Heche&#x27;s death in 2022.

Jane is known for his preference for going barefoot, including at film premieres and while on set.

<doc id="1035512" wikidata="Q381371" url="?curid=1035512" title="Aerobie">
<text>An Aerobie is a flying ring used in a manner similar to a chakram or flying disc (Frisbee), for recreational catches between two or more individuals. Its ring shape of only about thickness
makes the Aerobie lighter and more stable in flight than a disc.
It can be bent to tune it for straighter flight.
Since it has very low drag and good stability, it can be thrown much further than a flying disc. The Aerobie was used to set two former world records for thrown objects.

Designed in 1984 by Stanford engineering lecturer Alan Adler, the Aerobie has a polycarbonate core with soft rubber bumpers molded onto the inner and outer rims. The outer rim has a spoiler designed for stability.

In the 1970s, Alan Adler began attempting to improve the flying disc, considering its design characteristics. He tried streamlining the shape to reduce drag, but this resulted in a disc that was more unstable in flight. This led to the development of the predecessor of the Aerobie, which was called the &quot;Skyro&quot;. About a million of this model were sold. In 1980, it was used to set a Guinness World Record throw of . It lacked the spoiler rim of the Aerobie. It had low drag, but was stable at only a certain speed. The later introduction of the spoiler, which balanced the lift, made the ring stable &quot;over a wide range of speeds&quot;. After testing several models, the ideal shape was found, and the Aerobie was produced. Adler founded Superflight, Inc. (later known as Aerobie, Inc.) in 1984. 

In 2017, the rights to the Aerobie flying ring and other Aerobie assets were sold to Swimways, a subsidiary of Spin Master, and the company was renamed to AeroPress, Inc. 

==Characteristics==
The Aerobie allows for throws over unusually long distances. It flies faster and further than a common flying disc. When well tuned, it can fly in a straight line, &quot;like a puck on an invisible sheet of ice&quot;. It does not have the tendency to roll when thrown level, as a flying disc does. Similarly to a disc, an Aerobie can be thrown in a curved path by throwing it in a slant. Its lift depends on its speed relative to the air. Therefore, throwing into the wind makes it fly higher and throwing with the wind makes it fly lower.

===Advantages===
The Aerobie&#x27;s ring shape allows it to be caught in a variety of different ways. For example, it can be caught by thrusting a forearm, the head (when the ring is thrown high), or even a foot through the middle. Games such as &quot;Aerosticks&quot; and Aerogoal are designed specifically for the Aerobie.

===Disadvantages, special care===
An Aerobie ring does not float in water. It can be easier to lose than a flying disc, especially over long distances and its low profile can make it hard to spot on the ground. It also gets caught on tree branches more easily.

The Aerobie is best thrown in a wide open area such as a football or soccer field, away from bodies of water, roofs, trees, roads, etc. Adequate light is also important.

==World records==
The Aerobie Pro was used to set the Guinness World Record twice for the &quot;longest throw of an object without any velocity-aiding feature&quot;. The Aerobie&#x27;s first Guinness World Record was set by Scott Zimmerman at in 1986 at Fort Funston, San Francisco. The 1986 record was broken by Erin Hemmings with a throw of on July 14, 2003 at Fort Funston. Hemmings&#x27; Aerobie was airborne for 30 seconds (not an official measurement) and was the first thrown object to break the quarter-mile barrier (402 meters or 1,320 feet).

Previous to the 1986 record, the Aerobie held the world record at . It does not appear that this was recorded by Guinness. On June 7, 1988, the Aerobie became the first object to be thrown across Niagara Falls with a throw by Scott Zimmerman. In April 1987, Zimmerman threw a silver dollar taped to an Aerobie across the Potomac River.

Since the introduction of the Aerobie, Superflight has offered reward money for various landmark throws. While details of the earlier rewards are unclear, the current reward is $1,000 to anyone who sets the Guinness World Distance Record.

<text>Herut () was the major conservative nationalist political party in Israel from 1948 until its formal merger into Likud in 1988. It was an adherent of Revisionist Zionism.

==Early years==
===Foundation and platform===
Herut was founded by Menachem Begin on 15 June 1948 as a successor to the Revisionist Irgun, a militant group in Mandate Palestine. The new party was a challenge to the Hatzohar party established by Ze&#x27;ev Jabotinsky. Herut also established an eponymous newspaper, with many of its founding journalists defecting from Hatzohar&#x27;s &quot;HaMashkif&quot;. 

Objection to withdrawal of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and negotiations with Arab states formed the party&#x27;s main platform in the first Knesset election. The party vigorously opposed the ceasefire agreements with the Arab states until the annexation of Gaza Strip and the West Bank, both before and after the election. Herut differentiated itself by refusing to recognise the legitimacy of the Kingdom of Jordan after the armistice, and frequently used the slogan &quot;Two banks of the Jordan River&quot; in claiming Israel&#x27;s right to the whole of Eretz Israel/Palestine. According to Joseph Heller, Herut was a one-issue party intent on expanding Israel&#x27;s borders.

Herut&#x27;s socio-economic platform represented a clear shift to the right, with support for private initiative, but also for legislation preventing the trusts from exploiting workers. Begin was at first careful not to appear anti-socialist, stressing his opposition to monopolies and trusts, and also demanding that &quot;all public utility works and basic industries must be nationalized&quot;. Herut was from the outset inclined to sympathise with the underdog, and, according to Hannah Torok Yablonka, &quot;tended to serve as a lodestone for society&#x27;s misfits&quot;. 

===1949 elections===

Herut&#x27;s political expectations were high as the first election approached in 1949. It took credit for driving the British government out and as a young movement, reflecting the &quot;esprit&quot; of the nation, it perceived its image as being more attractive than the old establishment. They hoped to win 25 seats, which would place them second and make them leader of the opposition, with potential for a future gain of government power. This analysis was shared by other parties. At the elections, Herut only won 14 seats with 11.5 percent of the votes, making it the fourth-largest party in the Knesset; Hatzohar, on the other hand, failed to cross the electoral threshold of 1 percent and disbanded shortly thereafter.

===Opposition to Herut===
Though practical differences between the two parties were less dramatic than the rhetoric suggested, both the Labor Zionist establishment and the opposition Herut emphasised those differences to mobilise their voters.

The hostility between Begin and Israel&#x27;s first Prime Minister, the Mapai leader David Ben-Gurion, which had begun over the Altalena Affair, was evident in the Knesset. Ben-Gurion coined the phrase &quot;without Herut and Maki&quot; (Maki was the Communist Party of Israel), a reference to his position that he would include any party in his coalition, except those two. In fact, Herut was approached at least three times (1952, 1955, and 1961) by Mapai for government negotiations; Begin turned down each offer, suspecting that they were designed to divide his party. The ostracism also expressed itself in the Prime Minister&#x27;s refusal to refer to Begin by name from the Knesset Podium, using instead the phrase &quot;the person who sits next to M. K. Badar&quot;, and boycotting his Knesset speeches.

Ben-Gurion&#x27;s policy of ostracising Revisionism was performed systematically, as seen in the legal exclusion of fallen Irgun and Lehi fighters from public commemoration and from benefits to their families. Herut members were excluded from the highest bureaucratic and military positions.
Herut also met fierce resistance from the broader Jewish diaspora. When Begin visited New York City in December 1948 over twenty prominent Jewish intellectuals, including Albert Einstein, Hannah Arendt, Zellig Harris, and Sidney Hook signed an to &quot;The New York Times&quot;. The letter condemned Herut and Begin for their part in the Deir Yassin massacre and likened the party &quot;in its organization, methods, political philosophy and social appeal to the Nazi and Fascist parties&quot; and accused it of preaching &quot;an admixture of ultranationalism, religious mysticism, and racial superiority&quot;.

===Decline===
In the municipal elections of 1950, Herut lost voters to the centrist General Zionists, who also attracted disillusioned voters from Mapai and established themselves as a tough opposition rival to Herut. At the second national convention, Begin was challenged by more radical elements of his party. They wanted a more dynamic leadership, and thought he had adapted himself to the system. At the convention, Begin&#x27;s proposal to send children abroad for security reasons, although there was a precedent for such a measure, sounded defeatist, and it was unanimously rejected. It was considered to have hurt the party&#x27;s image. In March 1951, Herut lost two of its Knesset seats, with the defection of Ari Jabotinsky and Hillel Kook from the party to sit as independent MKs. Referring to previous written commitments, the party sought to revoke its Knesset membership, but the issue was still not settled by the next election three months later.

Critics of the party leadership pointed out that the party had changed and lost its status as a radical avant-garde party. Uncompromising candidates had been removed from the party list for the upcoming elections, economic questions loomed large in the propaganda, and Mapai had co-opted some of the Herut agenda, not least by declaring Jerusalem as Israel&#x27;s capital. These critics and outside commentators thought that Herut seemed irrelevant.

In the 1951 elections, Herut won eight seats, six less than previously. Begin resigned as leader, a move he had considered before the election because of the internal criticism. He was replaced by Aryeh Ben-Eliezer, whose leadership was nipped in the bud when he suffered a heart attack in late 1951. Ya&#x27;akov Rubin became party secretary general. Despite sending the party his resignation letter in August 1952 and going abroad to Europe, the party&#x27;s national council voted instead to make Ben-Eliezer deputy chairman and grant Begin a six month leave of absence. Begin did not return to public life until January 1952, prompted to do so by the growing debate around the Reparations Agreement between Israel and the Federal Republic of Germany.

As a young party without institutions paralleling those of Mapai, who were predominant in most areas of social life, Herut was at a serious disadvantage. Its leaders were politically inexperienced and clung to the principle of not – as representatives of the entire nation – accepting financial support from any interest groups. They were prevented from building a strong and competent party structure because of this.

==Begin&#x27;s return==
The Reparations Agreement between Israel and West Germany of 1952 brought Begin back into politics. It gave the party new momentum, and it proved an effective weapon against the General Zionists. The Reparations Agreement awoke strong sentiments in the nation, and Begin encouraged civil disobedience during the debate on the affair. The largest demonstrations gathered 15,000 people, and Herut reached far beyond its own constituency. The party let the issue fade from the agenda only after having wrested a maximum of political capital from it.

The third national convention included a fierce debate about democracy and legitimate political actions. There was strong sentiment in favour of using the barricades, but Begin vigorously resisted it. The government of the nation, he claimed, could only be established via the ballot box. The convention gave Begin important legitimacy by sending a message to the public that the party was law-abiding and democratic. At the same time, it secured the support of the hard-liners who would not compromise on its principles.

Economic and fiscal policy were given greater emphasis, and the party attacked the Histadrut for its dual role as employer and trade union. It proposed to outlaw such concentration of power and also abolish party control of agricultural settlements. Herut reasoned that workers were empowered by private enterprise. A 25 per cent tax cut was also envisioned.

In the 1955 election, the party nearly doubled its seats to 15, and became the second-largest party in the Knesset, behind Mapai. Apart from an improved campaign, the accomplishment was attributed to the activist party platform in a situation of deteriorating security, to more support from recent immigrants and other disgruntled elements, and to disillusionment with the economic situation. The Kastner trial also played into Herut&#x27;s hands, when, together with Maki, they helped bring down Moshe Sharett&#x27;s government in 1954 through a motion of no-confidence over the government&#x27;s position in the trial.

Herut added another seat in the 1959 elections, feeding on feelings of resentment against the dominant left that existed mainly among new Sephardi and Mizrahi immigrants. The party failed, however, to maintain the momentum of the previous election, and to make substantial gains, as had been hoped. As the young nation grew stronger, the public did not feel the same existential dread, lessening the impact of Herut&#x27;s activist message, especially after the Suez crisis, in which Ben-Gurion&#x27;s performance was perceived favourably. The Wadi Salib riots a few months before the election caused the government to play the role of maintainer of law and order, which resonated well among the middle class. Mapai exploited the situation successfully by depicting Begin as dangerous.

==Gahal alliance==
Herut helped bring down the government again in 1961 when they and the General Zionists tabled a motion of no confidence over the government&#x27;s investigation into the earlier Lavon Affair; in the resulting 1961 election, the party maintained its 17 seats. Toward the end of the Fifth Knesset in 1965, and in preparation for the upcoming election, Herut joined with the Liberal Party (itself a recent merger of the General Zionists and the Progressive Party) to form Gahal (a Hebrew acronym for the Herut-Liberal Bloc (Hebrew: גוש חרות-ליברלים, &quot;Gush Herut-Liberalim&quot;)), although each party remained independent within the alliance. The merger helped moderate Herut&#x27;s political isolation and created a right-wing opposition bloc with a broader base and more realistic chance to lead the government. The full alliance did not survive, however, because seven members of the Liberal Party, mostly former Progressives, soon defected from the Liberals and formed the Independent Liberals; they disagreed with the merger, identifying Herut and Begin as too right-wing. Mapai also experienced defections at the time, and the Knesset session closed with Gahal holding 27 seats, second only to Mapai&#x27;s remaining 34.
Over time, the public perception of both Herut and its leader had changed, despite the ostracism imposed by Prime Minister Ben-Gurion. Begin had remained the main opposition figure, against the dominant politicians of the left, particularly in debates regarding such heated issues as the Lavon investigation and Israel&#x27;s relationships to Germany. This prominence evaded much of the ostracism&#x27;s impact, and Ben-Gurion&#x27;s hostility became ever more savage. He eventually started to liken Begin to Hitler – an attitude that backfired, making Begin to stand out as a victim. The political climate took a favourable turn for Revisionism and Herut in mid-1963, when Levi Eshkol replaced Ben-Gurion as Prime and Defense Minister. A government resolution in March 1964 calling for the reinterment of Zeev Jabotinsky&#x27;s remains in Israel attests to this. Fallen Irgun and Lehi militants also began to be commemorated more equally, with their reputations being rehabilitated.

In the 1965 elections, Gahal won only 26 seats, well below that of the left&#x27;s new Alignment, which won 45. In Herut&#x27;s search for a scapegoat, its leadership was questioned by many; they considered that Begin, despite his achievements, brought an indelible stigma from his militant days before and around independence, scaring off voters. Internal opposition arose, and Herut&#x27;s eighth convention in June 1966 became turbulent. The opposition group sensed that Begin&#x27;s leadership position was too strong to challenge; so, they concentrated on winning control over the party organization. They won overwhelming victories in all votes for the composition of party institutions. Begin responded by putting his own political future at stake. He threatened to leave the party chair, and maybe also his seat in the Knesset. Begin&#x27;s move mobilized delegates in emphatic support for him, but the party convention still ended with great internal tension, and without a party chairman; the chair would be vacant for eight months. Party opposition to Begin&#x27; leadership came to a showdown a month after the convention, when Haim Amsterdam, an assistant to one of the opposition leaders, Shmuel Tamir, published a devastating attack on Begin in &quot;Ha&#x27;aretz&quot;; this led to the suspension of Tamir&#x27;s party membership. The leaders of the opposition then established a new party in the Knesset, the Free Center, with the loss of three seats for Herut. After this revolt, Begin returned to party leadership.

==Government participation==

Gahal joined the government on the first day of the Six-Day War, with both Begin and the Liberal&#x27;s Yosef Sapir becoming a Minister without Portfolio; Ben-Gurion&#x27;s Rafi also joined, with Moshe Dayan becoming Defense Minister. The national unity government was Begin&#x27;s own brainchild. This had a significant positive effect on his image. Critics agree that it was a major turning point in Herut&#x27;s road to power, since it granted it the legitimacy it had been denied up until then. The national unity government was more than an emergency solution in a time of existential danger; it reflected a relaxation of ideological tension, which enabled the government to outlive the emergency. Moreover, Begin and Ben-Gurion were reconciled. Ben-Gurion needed him in his bitter rivalry with Eshkol and Begin surprised his adversary by proposing to Eshkol that he should step aside in favor of Ben-Gurion as the leader of an emergency government. The proposition was turned down, but Ben-Gurion, who recently had compared Begin to Hitler, now praised his responsibility and patriotism.

The outcome of the war strengthened Herut. The principle of the indivisibility of the land had seemed like an archaic principle with little practical significance, but now, it emerged from the fringe of consciousness to the core of national thought. Begin saw it as his first mission in the government to secure the fruits of the victory by preventing territorial withdrawal and promoting settlement.

Despite the breakaway of the Free Center, Gahal retained its representation in the Knesset in the 1969 elections, and several of their candidates were elected as mayors. Herut was included in the new government of Golda Meir with six ministers (out of 24). The recruitment of Major-General Ezer Weizman, the first general to join Herut and a nephew of Israel&#x27;s first President, was a considerable public relations achievement. The Government participation did not last long, since Gahal left in early 1970 over the acceptance of the Rogers Plan, which included approval of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 242, a move that was largely dictated by Begin.

==Merging into Likud==

In September 1973, Gahal merged with the Free Centre, the National List and the non-parliamentary Movement for Greater Israel to create Likud, again with all parties retaining their independence within the union. Within Likud, Herut continued to be the dominant party. In the 1973 elections, Likud capitalized on the government&#x27;s neglect in the Yom Kippur War, and gained seven seats, totalling 39.

In the following years, Likud sharply criticized the government&#x27;s accords with Egypt and Syria. Stormy demonstrations were organized in conjunction with Gush Emunim, signifying an important political alliance. In the 1977 elections, Likud emerged victorious, with 43 seats, the first time the right had won an election. Begin became Prime Minister, retaining his post in the 1981 elections. In 1983, he stood down, and Yitzhak Shamir took over as Herut (and, therefore, Likud) party leader and Prime Minister.

Herut was finally disbanded in 1988, when Likud dissolved its internal factions to become a unitary party.

==Knesset election results==
==Legacy==

In 1998, Benny Begin (son of Menachem Begin), Michael Kleiner, and David Re&#x27;em broke away from Likud in protest at Benjamin Netanyahu&#x27;s agreement to the Wye River Memorandum and the Hebron Agreement, which had ceded land to the Palestinians. They named their new party Herut – The National Movement, and tried to claim it as the successor to the original party. However, in reality, it was a new and separate party. Today, the party ideology continues through the Magshimey Herut movement.

<doc id="1035517" wikidata="Q2572622" url="?curid=1035517" title="Rank (album)">
<text>Rank is the only official live album by English band The Smiths. It was released a year after the band’s breakup, in September 1988, through Rough Trade Records, and reached No. 2 in the British charts. In the United States, the album was released on Sire Records and made No. 77.

==Background==

&quot;Rank&quot; was released as a contractual obligation. It was recorded almost two years earlier on 23 October 1986 at National Ballroom in Kilburn, London, and is a fourteen-track distillation (of 21 songs) by singer Morrissey from the complete concert recording that had earlier been transmitted by BBC Radio 1. The album rode high on the Smiths nostalgia and the success of Morrissey&#x27;s debut solo album, &quot;Viva Hate&quot;, earlier the same year.

The songs omitted from the recording of the Kilburn show are: &quot;I Want the One I Can&#x27;t Have&quot;, &quot;There Is a Light That Never Goes Out&quot;, &quot;Frankly, Mr. Shankly&quot;, &quot;Never Had No One Ever&quot;, &quot;Meat Is Murder&quot;, and &quot;How Soon Is Now?&quot; Also, some edits can be readily heard in the concert itself, such as at the end of &quot;I Know It&#x27;s Over&quot; when the crowd starts cheering. In late 2008 video footage appeared from the show on YouTube.

According to The Smiths biographers Johnny Rogan and David Bret, Morrissey originally titled the album &quot;The Smiths in Heat&quot;. Rough Trade objected and Morrissey proposed &quot;Rank&quot;, &quot;as in &#x27;J. Arthur&#x27;&quot; (&quot;J. Arthur Rank&quot; is Cockney rhyming slang for &quot;wank&quot;).

===Packaging===
The album cover for &quot;Rank&quot;, designed by Morrissey, is a photo of actress Alexandra Bastedo. The image is from photographer John D. Green&#x27;s 1967 book &quot;Birds of Britain&quot;. The gatefold album&#x27;s interior features a photo of several Smiths fans ripping apart Morrissey&#x27;s shirt. That picture was taken by Ian Tilton at the 1986 Factory Records &quot;Festival of the Tenth Summer&quot; concert at G-Mex Centre in Manchester, England.

==Track listing==
All tracks written by Johnny Marr and Morrissey except &quot;His Latest Flame&quot; (Doc Pomus, Mort Shuman), &quot;The Draize Train&quot; (Marr) and the very beginning of &quot;The Queen Is Dead&quot; where an audio recording of Sergei Prokofiev&#x27;s classical piece &quot;Montagues and Capulets&quot; was played to introduce the band.

==Personnel==

===The Smiths===
* Morrissey – vocals
* Johnny Marr – lead guitar
* Andy Rourke – bass guitar
* Mike Joyce – drums
* Craig Gannon – rhythm guitar

===Technical staff===
* Pete Dauncey and Grant Showbiz – producers

<doc id="1035527" wikidata="Q247527" url="?curid=1035527" title="Clearasil">
<text>Clearasil is an American brand of skin care and acne medication, whose products contain chiefly benzoyl peroxide, sulfur and resorcinol, triclosan, or salicylic acid as active ingredients. Clearasil has a wide range of products both for rapid and sometimes slow acne treatment and for everyday prevention. The products are marketed to customers worldwide.

==History==
Clearasil was invented in the United States in 1950 by Ivan Combe with the help of chemist Kedzie Teller. At this time, it was the first dermatological brand created specially for younger skin to fight against pimples (acne). The active ingredients in the original product were sulfur and resorcinol, similar to the pre-existing adult acne product Acnomel. Combe used the popular ABC television show &quot;American Bandstand&quot; to help promote the product and its superior smell.

In 1960 the brand was bought by Richardson-Vicks. In 1975, Wolfman Jack signed a contract promoting the product Clearasil Acne Ointment. In 1985 Richardson-Vicks was acquired by Procter &amp; Gamble together with Clearasil. In 2000 Clearasil moved to the Boots Group portfolio. In 2006 Boots Healthcare International was purchased by the British-Dutch company Reckitt Benckiser.

==Controversy==
A 2018 ad titled &quot;Pimples Make Terrible Prom Dates&quot; was called homophobic by critics, who accused it of promoting anti-gay stereotypes. The ad features 2 teenage girls preparing for Prom, when one discovers a pimple. The pimple is shown as an effeminate man with a shrieking voice in a pink ruffled suit who punctuates his words with a flamboyant kick before flipping his hair back and settling into a pointed toe pose. After, an application of Clearasil kills it, and their prom dates are saved.

<text>An astrological age is a time period which, according to astrology, parallels major changes in the development of human society, culture, history, and politics. There are twelve astrological ages corresponding to the twelve zodiacal signs in western astrology. One cycle of the twelve astrological ages is called a Great Year, comprising 25,772 solar years, at the end of which another cycle begins.

Some astrologers believe that during a given age, some events are directly caused or indirectly influenced by the astrological sign associated with that age, while other astrologers believe that astrological ages do not influence events in any way.

Astrologers do not agree upon exact dates for the beginning or ending of the ages, with given dates varying by hundreds of years.

==Overview==
There are three broad perspectives on the astrological ages:

# Archeoastronomers do not necessarily believe in astrology as a science, but rather study the cultural traditions of societies that did refer extensively to astrology.
# Astrologers have been interested in relating world history to the astrological ages since the late 19th century; however, most astrologers study horoscopes, not astrological ages.
# The pop-culture concept of the Age of Aquarius referring to major societal changes of the 1960s, popularized in the 1967 musical (and subsequent 1979 film) &quot;Hair&quot;.

The following table of astrological ages was compiled by Neil Mann, giving commonly cited durations for each era, as well as developments in human history typically believed to have been influenced by the vernal equinox sign of their age. He notes that the claims of zodiac influences on human history are biased, relying on widely varying dates for events and selective cherry picking of evidence.

===Contentious aspects===
Definitive details on the astrological ages are lacking or disputed. The 20th-century British astrologer Charles Carter stated that &quot;It is probable that there is no branch of Astrology upon which more nonsense has been poured forth than the doctrine of the precession of the equinoxes.&quot;

Neil Spencer in his 2000 book &quot;True as the Stars Above&quot; expressed a similar opinion about the astrological ages. Spencer characterizes the concept as being &quot;fuzzy&quot;, &quot;speculative&quot;, and the least-defined area of astrological lore. Derek and Julia Parker state that it is impossible to state the exact date for the start of any astrological age and acknowledge that many astrologers believe the Age of Aquarius has arrived while many say the world is at the end of the Age of Pisces.

Ray Grasse states in &quot;Signs of the Times&quot; that &quot;there is considerable dispute over the exact starting and ending times for the different Great Ages.&quot; Paul Wright in &quot;The Great Ages and Other Astrological Cycles&quot; says that much of the uncertainty related to the astrological ages is because many astrologers have a poor understanding of the meaning of the astrological symbolism and &quot;even poorer historical knowledge&quot;.

===Consensus approach===
Though so many issues are contentious or disputed, there are two aspects of the astrological ages that have virtually unanimous consensus—firstly, the theorized link of the astrological ages to the axial precession of the Earth and commonly referred to as &quot;precession of the equinoxes&quot;; secondly, that, due to the nature of the precession of the equinoxes, the progression of the ages proceeds in reverse direction through the zodiacal signs.

===Ages of equal or variable lengths===
Astrologers use many ways to divide the Great Year into twelve astrological ages. There are two popular methods. One method is to divide the Great Year into twelve astrological ages of approximately equal lengths of around 2156 years per age based on the vernal equinox (also known as &quot;vernal point&quot;) moving through the sidereal zodiac. Another method is to significantly vary the duration of each astrological age based on the passage of the vernal equinox measured against the actual zodiacal constellations. Each of those twelve sections of the Great Year can be called either an astrological age, Precessional Age, or a Great Month.

The method based on the zodiacal constellations has a flaw in that from the reckoning of classical-era astronomer/astrologers like Claudius Ptolemy, many constellations overlap, a problem only eliminated in the past 200 years by the adoption of official constellation boundaries. For example, by 2700 CE the vernal point will have moved into Aquarius, but from a classical-era point of view, the vernal point will also point to Pisces due to the pre-boundary overlap.

===Age transitions===
Many astrologers consider the entrance into a new astrological age a gradual transition called a &quot;cusp&quot;. For example, Ray Grasse states that an astrological age does not begin at an exact day or year. Paul Wright states that a transition effect does occur at the border of the astrological ages. Consequently, the beginning of any age cannot be defined to a single year or a decade but blend its influences with the previous age for a period of time until the new age can stand in its own right. In Nicholas Campion&#x27;s &quot;The Book of World Horoscopes&quot; there are six pages listing researchers and their proposed dates for the start of the Age of Aquarius indicating that many researchers believe that each age commences at an exact date.

===Other opinions===

====Ages exactly 2,000 years each====
Many astrologers find ages too erratic based on either the vernal point moving through the randomly sized zodiacal constellations or sidereal zodiac and, instead, round all astrological ages to exactly 2000 years each. In this approach the ages are usually neatly aligned so that the Aries age is found from 2000 BC to AD 1, Pisces age AD 1 to AD 2000, the Aquarian Age AD 2000 – AD 4000, and so on. This approach is inconsistent with the precession of the equinoxes. Based on precession of the equinoxes, there is a one-degree shift approximately every 72 years, so a 30-degree movement requires 2160 years to complete.

====Ages involving the opposite sign====
An established school of thought is that an age is also influenced by the sign opposite to the one of the astrological age. Referring back to the precession of the Equinoxes, as the Sun crosses one constellation in the Northern Hemisphere&#x27;s spring Equinox (21 March), it will cross the opposite sign in the spring Equinox in the Southern Hemisphere (21 September). For instance, the Age of Pisces is complemented by its opposite astrological sign of Virgo (the Virgin); so a few refer to the Piscean age as the &#x27;Age of Pisces-Virgo&#x27;. Adopting this approach, the Age of Aquarius would become the Age of Aquarius-Leo. In his writings Ray Grasse also espouses the link between each sign of the zodiac and its opposite sign.

==History==
===Hipparchus and the discovery of the precession of the equinoxes===
Hipparchus of Nicaea (c. 190–120 BCE) is often credited with the discovery of the precession of the equinoxes, a fundamental astronomical phenomenon that plays a crucial role in the concept of astrological ages. Precession refers to the gradual shift in the orientation of Earth&#x27;s axis of rotation, which causes the positions of the equinoxes to move slowly westward along the ecliptic, completing a full cycle approximately every 26,000 years.

Hipparchus made this discovery while comparing his observations of the positions of stars with records from earlier astronomers, particularly those from Babylon. He noticed that the positions of certain fixed stars had shifted relative to the equinoxes over time, an observation that could not be explained by the prevailing astronomical models of his time. In his work, Hipparchus noted that the position of the vernal equinox had shifted by about 2° relative to the stars over the course of a century, which implied a slow, continuous motion of the celestial sphere.

This discovery was groundbreaking because it revealed that the celestial sphere was not as fixed as previously thought. Hipparchus&#x27; calculation of the precession rate was remarkably close to the modern value, estimating it at roughly 1° per century, which is only slightly different from the current measurement of approximately 1° every 72 years.

Hipparchus&#x27; findings were later documented by the Alexandrian astronomer Claudius Ptolemy in his seminal work, the &quot;Almagest&quot; (c. 150 CE), where he further refined and expanded upon Hipparchus&#x27; observations. Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Almagest&quot; became the standard reference for astronomers for many centuries and solidified the concept of precession in the astronomical canon.

The recognition of precession had profound implications for astrology, particularly in the development of the concept of astrological ages. As the equinoxes precess through the zodiac, they mark the beginning and end of these ages, each lasting roughly 2,160 years, based on the 12 zodiacal constellations. The shift from one age to another is thought to bring about significant cultural and spiritual changes, a belief that has influenced astrological thought since antiquity.

===Post-Hipparchus===
====Trepidation====
In the early post-Hipparchus period, two schools of thought developed about the slow shift of the fixed sphere of stars as discovered by Hipparchus. One school believed that at 1 degree shift per 100 years, the sphere of fixed stars would return to its starting point after 36,000 years. The trepidation school believed that the fixed stars first moved one way, then moved the other way – similar to a giant pendulum. It was believed that the &#x27;swinging&#x27; stars first moved 8 degrees one direction, then reversed this 8 degrees travelling the other direction.

Theon of Alexandria in the 4th century AD includes trepidation when he wrote &quot;Small Commentary to the Handy Tables&quot;. In the 5th century AD, the Greek Neoplatonist philosopher Proclus mentions that both theories were being discussed. The Indians around the 5th century AD preferred the trepidation theory but because they had observed the movement of the fixed stars by 25 degrees since ancient times (since around 1325 BC), they considered that trepidation swung back and forth around 27 degrees.

The significant early exponent of the &#x27;circular 36,000&#x27; years method was Ptolemy and, due to the status placed upon Ptolemy by later scholars, the Christian and Muslim astronomers of the Middle Ages accepted the Great Year of 36,000 years rather than trepidation. However some scholars gave credence to both theories based on the addition of another sphere which is represented in the Alfonsine tables produced by the Toledo School of Translators in the 12th and 13th centuries. The Alfonsine tables computed the positions of the sun, moon, and planets relative to the fixed stars. The Italian astronomer Cecco d&#x27;Ascoli, professor of astrology at the University of Bologna in the early 14th century, continued to have faith in trepidation but believed it swung 10 degrees in either direction. Copernicus refers to trepidation in &quot;De revolutionibus orbium coelestium&quot; published in 1543.

====Mithraism====
Hipparchus&#x27; discovery of precession of the equinoxes may have created the Mithraic Mysteries, colloquially also known as Mithraism, a 1st – 4th century neo-Platonic mystery cult of the Roman god Mithras. The near-total lack of written descriptions or scripture necessitates a reconstruction of beliefs and practices from the archaeological evidence, such as that found in Mithraic temples (in modern times called &quot;mithraea&quot;), which were real or artificial caves representing the cosmos. Until the 1970s most scholars followed Franz Cumont in identifying Mithras as a continuation of the Persian god Mithra. Cumont&#x27;s continuity hypothesis led him to believe that the astrological component was a late and unimportant accretion.

Cumont&#x27;s views are no longer followed. Today, the cult and its beliefs are recognized as a synthesis of late-classical Greco-Roman thought, with an astrological component even more astrology-centric than Roman beliefs generally were during the early Roman Empire. The details remain debated.

As far as axial precession is concerned, one scholar of Mithraism, David Ulansey, has interpreted Mithras as a personification of the force responsible for precession. He argues that the cult was a religious response to Hipparchus&#x27;s discovery of precession, which – from the ancient geocentric perspective – amounted to the discovery that the &quot;entire cosmos&quot; (i.e., the outermost celestial sphere of the fixed stars) was moving in a previously unknown way. Ulansey&#x27;s analysis is based on the &quot;tauroctony&quot;: the image of Mithras killing a bull that was placed at the center of every Mithraic temple. In the standard tauroctony, Mithras and the bull are accompanied by a &quot;dog&quot;, a &quot;snake&quot;, a &quot;raven&quot;, a &quot;scorpion&quot; and two identical young men, with torches.

According to Ulansey, the tauroctony is a schematic star chart. The bull is Taurus, a constellation of the zodiac. In the astrological age that preceded the time of Hipparchus, the vernal equinox had taken place when the Sun was in the constellation of Taurus, and during that previous epoch the constellations of Canis Minor (The Dog), Hydra (The Snake), Corvus (The Raven), and Scorpius (The Scorpion) – that is, the constellations that correspond to the animals depicted in the tauroctony – all lay on the celestial equator (the location of which is shifted by the precession) and thus had privileged positions in the sky during that epoch. Mithras himself represents the constellation Perseus, which is located directly above Taurus the Bull: The same location occupied by Mithras in the tauroctony image. Mithras&#x27; killing of the Bull, by this reasoning, represented the power possessed by this new god to shift the entire cosmic structure, turning the cosmic sphere so that the location of the spring equinox left the constellation of Taurus (a transition symbolized by the killing of the Bull), and the Dog, Snake, Raven, and Scorpion likewise lost their privileged positions on the celestial equator.

The iconography also contains two torch-bearing twins (Cautes and Cautopates) framing the bull-slaying image – one holding a torch pointing up and the other a torch pointing down. These torch-bearers are sometimes depicted with one of them (torch up) holding or associated with a Bull and a tree with leaves, and the other (torch down) holding or associated with a Scorpion and a tree with fruit. Ulansey interprets these torch-bearers as representing the spring equinox (torch up, tree with leaves, Bull) and the autumn equinox (torch down, tree with fruit, Scorpion) in Taurus and Scorpius respectively, which is where the equinoxes were located during the preceding &quot;Age of Taurus&quot; symbolized in the tauroctony as a whole.

From this, Ulansey concludes that Mithraic iconography was an &quot;astronomical code&quot; whose secret was the existence of a new cosmic divinity, unknown to those outside the cult, whose fundamental attribute was his ability to shift the structure of the entire cosmos, and thereby to control the astrological forces believed at that time to determine human existence. That gave him the power to grant his devotees success during life and salvation after death (i.e., a safe journey through the planetary spheres and a subsequent immortal existence in the sphere of the stars).

====Rate of precession====
Though the one degree per hundred years calculated for precession of the equinoxes as defined by Hipparchus and promulgated by Ptolemy was too slow, another rate of precession that was too fast also gained popularity in the 1st millennium AD. By the fourth century AD, Theon of Alexandria assumed a changing rate (trepidation) of one degree per 66 years. The tables of the Shah (Zij-i Shah) originate in the sixth century, but are lost, but many later Arabic and Persian astronomers and astrologers refer to them and also use this value. 

These later astronomers-astrologers or sources include: Al-Khwarizmi, Zij al Sindhind or &quot;Star Tables Based on the Indian Calculation Method&quot;(c. 800); &quot;Tabulae probatae&quot; or &quot;az-Zig al-mumtan&quot; (c. 830); Al-Battani, Albategnius, al-Zij (c. 880); and al-Sufi, Azophi (c. 965); Al Biruni (973–1048), &quot;al Canon al Masud&quot; or &quot;The Masʿūdic Canon&quot;; Arabic fixed star catalogue of 1 October 1112 (ed. Paul Kunitzsch); and &quot;Libros del Saber de Astronomía&quot; by Alfonso X of Castile (1252–1284).

====Anno Domini====
There exists evidence that the modern calendar developed by Dionysius Exiguus in the 6th century AD commencing with the birth of Jesus Christ at AD 1 was influenced by precession of the equinoxes and astrological ages. Dionysius&#x27; desire to replace Diocletian years (Diocletian persecuted Christians) with a calendar based on the incarnation of Christ was to prevent people from believing the imminent end of the world. At the time it was believed that the Resurrection and end of the world would occur 500 years after the birth of Jesus. The current Anno Mundi calendar theoretically commenced with the creation of the world based on information in the Old Testament. It was believed that based on the Anno Mundi calendar Jesus was born in the year 5500 (or 5500 years after the world was created) with the year 6000 of the Anno Mundi calendar marking the end of the world.

Anno Mundi 6000 (approximately AD 500) was thus equated with the Second Coming of Christ and the end of the world. Since this date had already passed in the time of Dionysius, he therefore searched for a new end of the world at a later date. He was heavily influenced by ancient cosmology, in particular the doctrine of the Great Year that places a strong emphasis on planetary conjunctions. This doctrine says that when all the planets were in conjunction that this cosmic event would mark the end of the world. Dionysius accurately calculated that this conjunction would occur in May AD 2000. Dionysius then applied another astronomical timing mechanism based on precession of the equinoxes. Though incorrect, some oriental astronomers at the time believed that the precessional cycle was 24,000 years which included twelve astrological ages of 2,000 years each. Dionysius believed that if the planetary alignment marked the end of an age (i.e. the Pisces age), then the birth of Jesus Christ marked the beginning of the Age of Pisces 2,000 years earlier. He therefore deducted 2,000 years from the May 2000 conjunction to produce AD 1 for the incarnation of Christ.

====Mashallah ibn Athari====
The renowned Persian Jewish astronomer and astrologer Masha&#x27;Allah (c.740 – 815 CE) employed precession of the equinoxes for calculating the period &quot;Era of the Flood&quot; dated as 3360 BCE or 259 years before the Indian Kali Yuga, believed to have commenced in 3101 BCE.

====Giovanni Pico della Mirandola====
The 15th century Italian Renaissance philosopher Giovanni Pico della Mirandola published a massive attack on astrological predictions, but he did not object to all of astrology and he commented on the position of the vernal point in his day. Pico was aware of the effects of precession of the equinoxes and knew that the first point of Aries no longer existed in the constellation of Aries. Pico not only knew that the vernal point had shifted back into Pisces, he stated that in his time, the vernal point (zero degrees tropical Aries) was located at 2 degrees (sidereal) Pisces. This suggests that by whatever method of calculation he was employing, Pico expected the vernal point to shift into (sidereal) Aquarius age 144 years later as a one degree shift takes 72 years.

====Isaac Newton====
Isaac Newton (1642 – 1726–27 ) determined the cause of precession and established the rate of precession at 1 degree per 72 years, very close to the best value measured today, thus demonstrating the magnitude of the error in the earlier value of 1 degree per century.

==Calculation aspects==

The Earth, in addition to its diurnal (daily) rotation upon its axis and annual rotation around the Sun, incurs a precessional motion involving a slow periodic shift of the axis itself: approximately one degree every 72 years. This motion, which is caused mostly by the Moon&#x27;s gravity, gives rise to the precession of the equinoxes in which the Sun&#x27;s position on the ecliptic at the time of the vernal equinox, measured against the background of fixed stars, gradually changes with time.

In graphical terms, the Earth behaves like a spinning top, and tops tend to wobble as they spin. The spin of the Earth is its daily (diurnal) rotation. The spinning Earth slowly wobbles over a period slightly less than 26,000 years. From our perspective on Earth, the stars are ever so slightly &#x27;moving&#x27; from west to east at the rate of one degree approximately every 72 years. One degree is about twice the diameter of the Sun or Moon as viewed from Earth. The easiest way to notice this slow movement of the stars is at any fixed time each year. The most common fixed time is at the vernal equinox around 21 March each year.

In astrology, an astrological age has usually been defined by the constellation or superimposed sidereal zodiac in which the Sun actually appears at the vernal equinox. This is the method that Hipparchus appears to have applied around 127 BC when he calculated precession. Since each sign of the zodiac is composed of 30 degrees, each astrological age might be thought to last about 72 (years) × 30 (degrees) = about 2160 years.

This means the Sun crosses the equator at the vernal equinox moving backward against the fixed stars from one year to the next at the rate of one degree in seventy-two years, one constellation (on average) in about 2148 years, and the whole twelve signs in about 25,772 years, sometimes called a Platonic Year. However the length of the ages are decreasing with time as the rate of precession is increasing. Therefore, no two ages are of equal length.

===First point of Aries alignment – the fiducial point===
Approximately every 26,000 years the zodiacal constellations, the associated sidereal zodiac, and the tropical zodiac used by western astrologers basically align. Technically this is when the tropical and sidereal &quot;first point in Aries&quot; (Aries 0°) coincided. This alignment is often called the point and, if the fiducial point could be found, fairly exact timeframes of all the astrological ages could be accurately determined if the method used to determine the astrological ages is based on the equal-sized 30 degrees per age and do not correspond to the exact constellation configuration in the sky.

However this fiducial point is difficult to determine because while there is no ambiguity about the tropical zodiac used by western astrologers, the same cannot be said of the sidereal zodiac used by Vedic astrologers. Vedic astrologers do not have unanimity on the exact location in space of their sidereal zodiac. This is because the sidereal zodiac is superimposed upon the irregular zodiacal constellation, and there are no unambiguous boundaries of the zodiacal constellations.

Modern day astronomers have defined boundaries, but this is a recent development by astronomers who are divorced from astrology, and cannot be assumed to be correct from the astrological perspective. While most astronomers and some astrologers agree that the fiducial point occurred in or around the 3rd to 5th centuries AD, there is no consensus on any exact date or tight timeframe within these three centuries. A number of dates are proposed by various astronomers and even wider timeframes by astrologers. (For an alternative approach to calibrating precession, see Alternative approach to calibrating precession in New, alternative, and fringe theories section below).

As an example of a mystic contemporary approach to precession, in Max Heindel&#x27;s astrology writings, it is described, that last time the starting-point of the sidereal zodiac agreed with the tropical zodiac occurred in AD 498. A year after these points were in exact agreement, the Sun crossed the equator about fifty seconds of space into the constellation Pisces. The year following it was one minute and forty seconds into Pisces, and so it has been creeping backward ever since, until at the present time the Sun crosses the equator in about nine degrees in the constellation Pisces. Based on this approach, it will thus be about 600 years before it actually crosses the celestial equator in the constellation Aquarius. However this is only one of many approaches and so this must remain speculation at this point of time.

==Present and future ages==

===Age of Pisces (Piscean Age)===
Symbol for Pisces: 

When the March equinox occurs in Pisces.

====Timeframes====

*&quot;Zodiacal 30 degrees&quot;:
**Neil Mann interpretation: began c. AD 1 and ends c. AD 2150
**Heindel-Rosicrucian interpretation: began c. AD 498 and ends c. AD 2654

===Age of Aquarius (Aquarian Age)===

Symbol for Aquarius: 

When the March equinox occurs in Aquarius.

====Timeframes====
In 1928, at the Conference of the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in Leiden, the Netherlands, the edges of the 88 official constellations became defined in astronomical terms. The edge established between Pisces and Aquarius locates the beginning of the Aquarian Age around the year 2600.

The Austrian astronomer examined the question of when the Age of Aquarius begins in an article published in 1992 by the Austrian Academy of Science: with the German title (&quot;The Start of the Aquarian Age, an Astronomical Question?&quot;). Based on the boundaries accepted by IAU in 1928, Haupt&#x27;s article investigates the start of the Age of Aquarius by calculating the entry of the spring equinox point over the parallel cycle (d = – 4°) between the constellations Pisces and Aquarius and reaches, using the usual formula of precession (Gliese, 1982), the year 2595. However Haupt concludes:
*&quot;Zodiacal 30 degrees&quot;:
**Neil Mann interpretation: begins AD 2150.
**Dane Rudhyar&#x27;s interpretation states that the Age of Aquarius will begin in AD 2062.
**Nicholas Campion in &quot;The Book of World Horoscopes&quot; indicates that he has collected over 90 dates provided by researchers for the start of the Age of Aquarius and these dates have a range of over 2,000 years commencing in the 15th century AD. The range of dates for the possible start of the Aquarian Age range from 1447 to 3621.
*&quot;Constellation boundary year&quot;:
**Hermann Haupt interpretation: begins c. AD 2595.

====Astrological predictions====
There is an expectation that the Aquarian Age will usher in a period of group consciousness. Marcia Moore and Mark Douglas write that the lighting up of the earth artificially by electricity is a sign of the Age of Aquarius.

==Sub-periods of ages==
Many research astrologers believe that the astrological ages can be divided into smaller sections along the lines of &#x27;wheels within wheels&#x27;. The most common method is to divide each astrological ages into twelve sub-periods. There are two common ways of undertaking this process and two ways of applying these sub-periods. Furthermore, some astrologers divide the ages in different ways. For example, David Williams employs a decanate sub-division whereby each age is divided into three equal sections.

===Aries to Pisces sub-periods===
The most popular method of sub-dividing astrological ages is to divide each age equally into twelve sub-periods with the first sub-period Aries, followed by Taurus, Gemini, and so on, until the last sub-division, Pisces. Charles Carter was an early advocate of this approach. Technically this approach is based on the twelfth harmonic of the zodiacal signs.

===Dwadasamsa sub-periods===
The alternative approach is to apply a method commonly used in Vedic astrology but with long antecedents also in Western astrology. This method also divides each astrological age into twelve sub-periods but the first sub-period for each sign is the same as the sign itself, then with the following sub-periods in natural order. For example, the twelve dwadasamsa of Aquarius are Aquarius, Pisces, Aries, Taurus, and so on, until the last dwadasamsa – Capricorn. Technically this approach is based on attributes of both the twelfth and thirteenth harmonics of the zodiacal signs and can be considered to be halfway between the 12th and 13th harmonics.

===Sub-period direction (forward or retrograde?)===
There are two ways of applying the above sub-periods to the astrological ages.
*Natural Order – The most common way is to arrange the sub-periods so that they go forward in the natural order. Therefore, if the Aries to Pisces method is adopted for example in the Aquarian Age, the first sub-period is Aries, followed by Taurus, Gemini and so on until the last sub-division – Pisces. This is the approach made by Charles Carter. If the dwadasamsa sub-period is adopted they also progress in the natural order of the signs. For example, the twelve dwadasamsa of Aquarius are Aquarius, Pisces, Aries, Taurus, and so on, until the last dwadasamsa – Capricorn.
*Geometric Order (Retrograde) – The other approach is to arrange the sub-periods geometrically and reverse the direction of the sub-periods in line with the retrograde order of the astrological ages. For example, if applying the Aries to Pisces method, the first sub-period of any astrological age is Pisces, followed by Aquarius, Capricorn, and so on, until the last sub-period – Aries. Charles Carter indicated there was some merit to this approach. If applying the dwadasamsa sub-period system geometrically for example the first sub-period in the Aquarian Age is Capricorn, followed by Sagittarius, Scorpio, and so on, until the last sub-period – Aquarius. This approach is adopted by Terry MacKinnell, Patrizia Norelli-Bachelet and David Williams applied his [decans] (threefold division) geometrically thus supporting this approach.

==New, alternative, and fringe myths==
Due to the lack of consensus of almost all aspects of the astrological ages, except for the astrological ages relationship to precession of the equinoxes and the retrograde order of the astrological ages, there are alternative, esoteric, innovative, fringe and newly expressed ideas about the astrological ages which have not established credibility in the wider astrological community or among archaeoastronomers.

===Alternative approach to calibrating precession===
Terry MacKinnell has developed an alternative approach to calibrating precession of the equinoxes to determine the Astrological Age. His major point of departure from the traditional modern approach is how he applies the vernal equinox to the zodiacal constellations. Instead of referring to the position of the Sun at the vernal equinox (a &#x27;modern&#x27; mathematical technique developed by the Greeks in the late 1st millennium BC), he refers to the heliacal rising constellation on the day of the vernal equinox. This approach is based on the ancient approach to astronomical observations (the same ancient period that also saw the invention of the zodiacal constellations) prior to the development of mathematical astronomy by the ancient Greeks in the 1st millennium BC. All ancient astronomical observations were based on visual techniques.

Of all the key techniques used in ancient times, the most common in Babylon (most likely the source of astrology) and most other ancient cultures were based on phenomena that occurred close to the eastern or western horizons.

The heliacal rising constellation at the vernal equinox is based on the last zodiacal constellation rising above the Eastern Horizon just before dawn and before the light of the approaching Sun obliterates the stars on the eastern horizon. Currently at the vernal equinox the constellation of Aquarius has been the heliacal rising constellation for some centuries. The stars disappear about one hour before dawn depending upon magnitude, latitude, and date. This one hour represents approximately 15 degrees difference compared to the contemporary method based on the position of the Sun among the zodiacal constellations.

Each age is composed of 30 degrees, therefore, 15 degrees represents about half an age or about 1080 years. Based on the heliacal rising method, the Age of Aquarius arrived about 1,080 years earlier than the modern system. John H Rogers in part one of his paper &quot;Origins of the ancient constellations&quot; also states that using the ancient heliacal rising method compared to the (modern) solar method produces a result that is approximately 1,000 in advance.

Using this approach, the astrological ages arrive about half an age earlier compared to the common contemporary approach to calibrating precession based on modern mathematical techniques. Thus, MacKinnell has the Aquarian Age arriving in the 15th century while most astrologers have the Age of Aquarius arriving in the 27th century, almost 700 years in the future.

<text>Domain Technologie Control (DTC) was a web hosting control panel aimed at providing a graphics-oriented layout for managing commercial hosting of web servers, intended for shared web hosting servers, virtual private servers (VPSes), and dedicated servers. Domain Technologie Control is free software released under the GNU LGPL v2.1 license. It is fully skinnable and translated into several languages.

Domain Technologie Control allows the administrator to create web hosting plans that provide email and FTP accounts, domain purchasing, subdomains, SSH, and MySQL databases to the end users under controllable quota for the web sites that these users own. DTC also maintains the automation of billing, generates backup scripts, and monitors traffic (per user and per service) using a single system, UID or GID. Also integrated into DTC are the support ticket system and customizable HTTP error pages.

DTC itself manages its own MySQL database to store its setup configuration, web hosting plans, and users. It has support for many other free software: MySQL, Apache, PHP, qmail, Postfix, Courier, Dovecot, ProFTPd, Webalizer, mod-log-sql, and more. It also connects to dtc-xen to manage and monitor the usage of Virtual Private Servers (VPS).

DTC is fully open source (LGPL). DTC is also the first web hosting control panel that has reached inclusion in major distributions like Debian (since Lenny in 2009), Ubuntu (since 2008) and FreeBSD.

<text>Arthur Kornberg (March 3, 1918 – October 26, 2007) was an American biochemist who won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1959 for the discovery of &quot;the mechanisms in the biological synthesis of ribonucleic acid and deoxyribonucleic acid&quot; together with Spanish biochemist and physician Severo Ochoa of New York University. He was also awarded the Paul-Lewis Award in Enzyme Chemistry from the American Chemical Society in 1951, an L.H.D. degree from Yeshiva University in 1962, and the National Medal of Science in 1979. In 1991, Kornberg received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement and the Gairdner Foundation Award in 1995.

Kornberg&#x27;s primary research interests were in biochemistry, especially enzyme chemistry, deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis (DNA replication) and studying the nucleic acids which control heredity in animals, plants, bacteria and viruses.

==Early life and education==
Born in New York City, Kornberg was the son of Jewish parents Joseph and Lena (née Katz) Kornberg, who emigrated to New York from Austrian Galicia (now part of Poland) in 1900 before they were married. His paternal grandfather had changed the family name from Queller (also spelled Kweller) to avoid the draft by taking on the identity of someone who had already completed military service. Joseph married Lena in 1904. Joseph worked as a sewing machine operator in the sweat shops of the Lower East Side, Manhattan for almost 30 years, and when his health failed, opened a small hardware store in Brooklyn, where Arthur assisted customers at the age of nine. Joseph spoke at least six languages although he had no formal education.

Arthur Kornberg was educated first at Abraham Lincoln High School and then at City College of New York. He received a B.S. in 1937, followed by a Doctor of Medicine at the University of Rochester in 1941. Kornberg had a mildly elevated level of bilirubin in his blood— jaundice due to a hereditary genetic condition known as Gilbert&#x27;s syndrome—and, while at medical school, he took a survey of fellow students to discover how common the condition was. The results were published in Kornberg&#x27;s first research paper in 1942.

Kornberg&#x27;s internship was at Strong Memorial Hospital in Rochester, New York, in 1941–1942. After completing his medical training, he joined the armed services as a lieutenant in the United States Coast Guard, serving as a ship&#x27;s doctor in 1942 in the Caribbean. Rolla Dyer, the Director of National Institutes of Health, had noticed his paper and invited him to join the research team at the Nutrition Laboratory of the NIH. From 1942 to 1945, Kornberg&#x27;s work was the feeding of specialized diets to rats to discover new vitamins.

==Research and career==
The feeding of rats was boring work, and Kornberg became fascinated by enzymes. He transferred to Dr Severo Ochoa&#x27;s laboratory at New York University in 1946, and took summer courses at Columbia University to fill out the gaps in his knowledge of organic and physical chemistry while learning the techniques of enzyme purification at work. He became Chief of the Enzyme and Metabolism Section at NIH from 1947–1953, working on understanding of ATP production from NAD and NADP. This led to his work on how DNA is built up from simpler molecules.

While working at NIH, he also researched at Washington University in St. Louis (in the lab of Carl Ferdinand Cori and Gerty Cori in 1947), and the University of California, Berkeley (in the lab of Horace Barker in 1951).

In 1953 he became professor and head of the department of microbiology, Washington University in St. Louis, until 1959. Here he continued experimenting with the enzymes which created DNA. In 1956 he isolated the first DNA polymerizing enzyme, now known as DNA polymerase I. This got him elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1957 and won him the Nobel prize in 1959. 

In 1960, he was elected to the American Philosophical Society, received a LL.D. again from City College and a D.Sc. at the University of Rochester in 1962. He became professor and executive head of the department of biochemistry, Stanford University, in 1959. In an interview in 1997, Arthur Kornberg (referring to Josh Lederberg) said: &quot;Lederberg really wanted to join my department. I knew him; he&#x27;s
a genius, but he&#x27;d be unable to focus and to operate within a small family group like ours, and so, I was instrumental in establishing a department of genetics [at Stanford] of which he would be chairman.&quot;

Kornberg&#x27;s mother died of gas gangrene from a spore infection after a routine gall bladder operation in 1939. This started his lifelong fascination with spores, and he devoted some of his research efforts to understanding them while at Washington University. From 1962 to 1970, in the midst of his work on DNA synthesis, Kornberg devoted half his research effort to determining how DNA is stored in the spore, what replication mechanisms are included, and how the spore generates a new cell. This was an unfashionable but complex area of science, and although some progress was made, eventually Kornberg abandoned this research.

The Arthur Kornberg Medical Research Building at the University of Rochester Medical Center was named in his honor in 1999.

Until his death, Kornberg maintained an active research laboratory at Stanford and regularly published scientific journal articles. For several years the focus of his research was the metabolism of inorganic polyphosphate.

The &quot;Kornberg school&quot; of biochemistry refers to Arthur Kornberg&#x27;s many graduate students and post-doctoral fellows, i.e., his intellectual children, and the trainees of his trainees, i.e., his intellectual grandchildren. Kornberg&#x27;s intellectual children include I. Robert Lehman, Charles C. Richardson, Randy Schekman, William T. Wickner, James Rothman, Arturo Falaschi and Ken-ichi Arai.

==Personal life==
On November 21, 1943, Kornberg married Sylvy Ruth Levy, also a biochemist of note. She worked closely with Kornberg and contributed significantly to the discovery of DNA polymerase. According to their second son, Thomas, “the joke in the family—and it was just a joke—was that when the prize was announced, she said &#x27;I was robbed!’”

Arthur and Sylvy Kornberg had three sons: Roger David Kornberg (1947), Thomas B. Kornberg (1948), and Kenneth Andrew Kornberg (1950). Roger is Professor of Structural Biology at Stanford University, and the 2006 laureate of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Thomas discovered DNA polymerase II and III in 1970 and is now a professor at the University of California, San Francisco. Kenneth is an architect specializing in the design of biomedical and biotechnology laboratories and buildings.

Arthur Kornberg was married three times. His first two wives predeceased him. Sylvy Kornberg died in 1986. Arthur Kornberg remarried in 1988 but his second wife, the former Charlene Walsh Levering, died in 1995. In December 1998 Arthur Kornberg married Carolyn Frey Dixon.

When he was in his eighties, Kornberg continued to conduct research full-time at department of biochemistry at Stanford. He died on October 26, 2007, at Stanford Hospital from respiratory failure.

<doc id="1035549" wikidata="Q847381" url="?curid=1035549" title="Sierra Madre (California)">
<text>The Sierra Madre (Spanish for &quot;mother range&quot;) is a mountain range in southwestern California. It forms the southernmost part of the California Coast Ranges and lies mostly in Santa Barbara County, with a small portion extending into Ventura County. The Sierra Madre has a northwest-to-southeast orientation, bordered on the north and northeast by the Cuyama River and Cuyama Valley, and on the south and east by the drainage of the Sisquoc River.

Before the middle of the twentieth century, the term &quot;Sierra Madre&quot; referred to the portion of the Transverse Ranges north of the Los Angeles Basin, now known as the San Gabriel Mountains. In 1965, the United States Board of Geographic Names assigned the name Sierra Madre to the range in Santa Barbara County. 

==Geography==
The Sierra Madre range trends from northwest to southeast, and is approximately long. High peaks in the range include MacPherson Peak at in elevation, and the highest point in the range, Peak Mountain at in elevation. Snow falls on the higher elevations during the winter months.
The range forms the southwestern side of the Cuyama Valley. The La Panza Range is a northern extension of the Sierra Madre, located in eastern San Luis Obispo County.

The Sierra Madre is almost entirely within the Los Padres National Forest, and marks the northern boundary of the San Rafael Wilderness area. The southeastern extent of the range is about north of the city of Santa Barbara, and the northwestern extent of the range is about north by northwest of the city.

To the southeast, the range merges with the San Rafael Mountains of the Transverse Ranges System, in a complex topography of unnamed ranges. The adjacent highest point of the San Rafael Mountains, and in all Santa Barbara County, is Big Pine Mountain ().

==Natural history==

The Sierra Madre lies in the region historically inhabited by the Chumash people, who used sites in the mountains for sacred ceremonies and rites. Numerous petroglyphs can still be found in the area, including the Painted Rock Site, identified as &quot;S&#x27;ap&#x27;aski&quot; or House of the Sun in Chumash tradition.

The predominant vegetation type on the mountains is chaparral shrubland, with oak woodlands that occur in microclimates, both of the California interior chaparral and woodlands sub-ecoregion. The higher elevations support California mixed evergreen forest and small areas of coniferous forest habitats.

The mountains are one of the most important undeveloped habitat areas of the endangered California condor.

Geologically, the mountains are mostly sedimentary rock of Tertiary age, with some marine and non-marine sedimentary rocks of Eocene and Upper Cretaceous age. There is a large proportion of sandstone, and one region in the eastern portion of the range is made up of Neogene sediments.

The mountain range is almost entirely uninhabited, except for portions of the lower slopes to the north, which have been developed for oil and gas production at the South Cuyama Oil Field. One difficult, single-lane dirt road follows the mountain crest; it often is closed after storms, and is normally only passable by four-wheel-drive vehicles or motorcycles.

<doc id="1035550" wikidata="Q460011" url="?curid=1035550" title="Stephens Island (New Zealand)">
<text>Stephens Island () is at the northernmost tip of the Marlborough Sounds in the South Island of New Zealand. It lies two kilometres to the northeast of Cape Stephens, the northernmost point of D&#x27;Urville Island. The island is in size, and rises high from the sea.

==History==
The island was owned by the Ngāti Koata iwi but was taken by the government to build a lighthouse in 1891. The Māori called it Takapourewa (&quot;around the tower&quot;) but explorer Captain Cook renamed it Stephens Island in 1770 after Sir Philip Stephens, Secretary of the Admiralty.

The island featured in local mythos as the place where a local lighthouse keeper&#x27;s cat, named Tibbles, was claimed to have caused the extinction of Lyall&#x27;s wren in 1894. However, this belief was erroneous, an urban legend. While this cat did kill one of the last birds seen, a few more specimens were obtained in the following years, by which time the island also hosted numerous feral cats, and the island was only the last refuge of the bird, which had become extinct on the mainland many centuries earlier due to Polynesian rat predation.

Farming and grazing reduced the island&#x27;s original vegetation cover by around 90%, before being made a wildlife sanctuary in 1966 and a nature reserve in 1997. In 2012 the Treaty of Waitangi settlement between Ngāti Koata and the New Zealand Government required joint management by Ngāti Koata and the Department of Conservation.

==Conservation==
Today, the best known resident of Stephens Island is the tuatara. The island is a sanctuary for this rare order of reptile which is now extinct on the mainland, except in tightly controlled reserves including ecological islands.

Stephens Island is internationally important for nature conservation. While most attention has focused on the tuatara, the significant and unique factors include:
* Endemic species – those found nowhere else, either because they evolved here or because they have become extinct everywhere else – such as Hamilton&#x27;s Frog, perhaps the rarest frog in the world and the Ngaio Weevil, a large flightless Weevil
* Unusual species such as the tuatara (&quot;Sphenodon punctatus&quot;), which is the sole survivor of a group of reptiles that otherwise appears to have been extinct elsewhere in the world for more than 60 million years
* Rare species – such as the Stephen&#x27;s Island gecko and Cook Strait click beetle that are only found in a handful of other places, and for which Stephens Island is a stronghold
* Common species in unusual abundance – such as the more than one million seabirds, vast numbers of wētā and darkling beetles and many more
* Stephens Island is a part of a complex ecosystem that includes a vast area of ocean. An enormous number of seabirds link this small (154 ha) island to a vast marine ecosystem. The sea provides nutrients, the seabirds carry these to the island and Takapourewa provides a sanctuary for nesting birds, free of mammalian land predators.

==Geography==
In natural character, Stephens Island is a rugged landmass dominated by maritime influences. Visually the island is connected to the adjacent larger D&#x27;Urville Island, and Stephens Island is the largest of the family of islands, islets and rock stacks that characterise this southwestern side of the Cook Strait. Although uninhabited, the island has been extensively modified by land clearance and farming, but retains much of its wild natural character. From sea level the lighthouse is a prominent visual feature, while from the air the cluster of buildings and farmed landscape are obvious.

The surrounding sea is rich with marine life, albeit strongly modified and depleted by fishing, and historically by hunting of whales and seals. The island overlooks one of the great whale migration routes, most notably for humpback whales. Marine mammals such as New Zealand Fur Seals and various dolphin species are seen around the island.

This is an area of strong winds (mean annual wind speed ), strong currents and broken restless seas. The island also harbours strong gradations of weather between the often cloud-covered summit and the wave-lashed shores. There are also distinct differences between the relatively more exposed western and the less exposed eastern shores. Rainfall averages a modest .

==Geology==
Stephens Island is characterised by the Stephens Formation, a geological unit comprising 1100 meters of southeast-dipping sedimentary rocks ranging from mudstone with limestone lenses to volcanogenic sandstone and conglomerate. As the youngest formation within the Maitai Group, these rocks constitute the most northerly exposure of the Nelson Regional Syncline, displaying an overturned orientation on the syncline&#x27;s eastern limb. Indurated with widespread metamorphic prehnite, pumpellyite, and lawsonite, the formation is subdivided into Queens Beach, Incline, Takapourewa, and Titapua Members, with no discernible top or bottom boundaries. Notably, the oldest rocks, found in the Queens Beach Member, consist of a 150-meter layer of rounded cobble conglomerate enclosing angular blocks of coarse volcanogenic sandstone. Within one such block, measuring 4 meters in length and up to 1.5 meters in thickness, a diverse but moderately preserved marine fossil assemblage dominated by brachiopods and pectinid bivalves of Late Permian age is identified. The contemporaneous formation of the fossiliferous sandstone and conglomerate suggests a Late Permian age, although the potential for a younger (Triassic) age cannot be ruled out. Additionally, Late Quaternary deposits, including loess and windblown sand, are present in localized areas.

<text>A radio scanner or simply scanner is a radio receiver that can automatically tune discrete frequencies, scanning over a frequency band to find a signal until the initial transmission ceases.

The term &quot;scanner&quot; generally refers to a communications receiver that is primarily intended for monitoring VHF and UHF landmobile radio systems, as opposed to, for instance, a receiver used to monitor international shortwave transmissions, although these may be classified as scanners too.

More often than not, these scanners can also tune to different types of modulation as well (AM, FM, SSB, etc.). Early scanners were slow, bulky, and expensive. Today, modern microprocessors have enabled scanners to store thousands of channels and monitor hundreds of channels per second. Recent models can follow trunked radio systems and decode APCO-P25 digital transmissions. Both hand held and desktop models are available. Scanners are often used to monitor police, fire and emergency medical services. Radio scanning also serves an important role in the fields of journalism and crime investigation, as well as a hobby for many people around the world.

== History and use ==
Scanners developed from earlier tunable and fixed-frequency radios that received one frequency at a time. Non-broadcast radio systems, such as those used by public safety agencies, do not transmit continuously. With a radio fixed on a single frequency, much time could pass between transmissions, while other frequencies might be active. A scanning radio will sequentially monitor multiple programmed channels, or scan between user defined frequency limits and user defined frequency steps. The scanner will stop on an active frequency strong enough to break the radio&#x27;s squelch setting and resume scanning other frequencies when that activity ceases.

Scanners first became popular and widely available during the popularity height of CB radio in the 1970s. The first scanners often had between four and ten channels and required the purchase of a separate crystal for each frequency received. A US patent was issued to Peter W. Pflasterer on June 1, 1976. An early 1976 US entry was the Tennelec MCP-1, sold at the January 1976 Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago.

== Features ==

Many recent models will allow scanning of the specific DCS or CTCSS code used on a specific frequency should it have multiple users. Memory banks are also common. For example, one memory bank can be assigned to air traffic control, another can be for local marine communications, and yet another for local police frequencies. These can be switched on and off depending on the user&#x27;s preference. Most scanners also have a weather radio band, allowing the listener to tune into weather radio broadcasts from a NOAA transmitter. The weather function may also include S.A.M.E. (Specific Area Message Encoding) capability, this allows users to only receive alerts for specific counties that are programmed via the keypad.

Some scanners are equipped with Fire-Tone out. Fire tone out decodes Quick Call type tones and acts as a pager when the correct sequence of tones is detected.

Modern scanners allow hundreds or thousands of frequencies to be entered via a keypad and stored in various &quot;memory banks&quot; and can scan at a rapid rate for activity due to modern microprocessors.

Active frequencies can be found by searching the internet and frequency reference books or can be discovered through a programmable scanner&#x27;s search function. Antenna modifications may be used. For example, an external antenna can be used for a desktop scanner or an extendable antenna for a hand held unit will provide greater performance than the original equipment &quot;stock&quot; antennas provided by manufacturers.

== Uses ==
Scanners are often used by hobbyists, railfans, aviation enthusiasts, auto race fans, siren enthusiasts, off-duty emergency services personnel, and reporters.

Many scanner clubs exist to allow members to share information about frequencies, codes, and operations. Many have internet presence, such as websites, email lists or web forums.

== Legislation ==

=== Australia ===

It is legal to possess a scanner in Australia and to listen to any transmission that is not classified as telecommunication (i.e. anything not connected to the telephone network). Phone app police scanners are also legal.

=== Austria ===
Possession of a radio scanner is legal. However, article 93 of the &quot;Telekommunikationsgesetz&quot; prohibits the intentional reception of signals by third parties without authorization from the user.

=== Brazil ===

In Brazil, it is legal to have a scanner, but the user is required to have an amateur radio license. Individuals are prohibited from spreading or recording any information obtained through scanning.

=== Belgium ===

In Belgium it is allowed to possess and listen to a scanner. Although it is only allowed to listen to frequencies where you have a permission to listen to. Without permission it is only allowed to listen to HAM Radio or other so called &#x27;free to listen&#x27; channels
=== Canada ===

In Canada, according to the Radiocommunication Act, it is completely legal to install, operate or possess a radio apparatus that is capable only of the reception of broadcasting (digital and analogue, but not encrypted data) provided that private information is not passed on or disclosed to any other person(s) or party(s).

A situation that occurred in the Toronto area on 28 June 2011 involving York Regional Police officer Constable Garrett Styles was picked up by scanners. Online streaming of communications between the fatally injured officer and police dispatch were picked up by local media. The tragedy was widely reported before the officer&#x27;s family was notified and several media outlets rebroadcast the recorded emergency transmission. A police initiative pressuring the government to create legislation to stop online streaming of scanner captured police communications was announced in April 2012. Although it is currently legal to stream information from a scanner in Canada, using the information for profit is not legal. Some Canadian police forces use encrypted communications which cannot legally be decrypted and streamed onto the Internet. Applications are available permitting anyone with an Internet-ready computer or smartphone to access scanner communications that are streamed onto the Internet by private individuals who possess the appropriate scanner and computer equipment.

=== Germany ===
German law does not prohibit possession of a scanner. However, the &quot;Abhörverbot&quot; laid down in article 5 of the &quot;Telekommunikation-Medien-Datenschutz-Gesetz (TTDSG&quot;) stipulates that it is only legal to listen to or otherwise take knowledge of the contents of four classes of transmissions: those intended for the user of the radio receiver, those made by licensed amateur radio operators, those intended for the general public, and those intended for an indefinite group of people. Violation of this provision is punishable by up to two years in prison or a fine. This prohibition was previously included in the &quot;Telekommunikationsgesetz&quot;, but was moved to the &quot;TTSDG&quot; as a part of the German telecom law reform in 2021.

Until 2016, the &quot;Telekommunikationsgesetz&quot; only prohibited the act of listening to other classes of transmissions. This was broadened as a response to a decision of the Cologne Administrative Court, which in 2008 questioned whether the mere reception and decoding of aircraft transponder signals to display aircraft movements on a screen could be considered listening, as it lacks an acoustic element. This updated wording was carried over to the &quot;TTDSG&quot; in 2021.

=== Ireland ===
Unlicensed possession of a wireless telegraphy apparatus is generally prohibited under Section 3 of the &quot;Wireless Telegraphy Act 1926&quot;, subject to exemptions. One such exemption covers most apparatuses only capable of reception, including radio scanners. 

Moreover, Section 11(2) of the Act states that &quot;no person shall improperly divulge the purport of any message, communication, or signal sent or proposed to be sent by wireless telegraphy.&quot; The aforementioned exemption echoes this wording as a condition of use of covered receive-only apparatuses. No further information regarding the scope of this prohibition is provided.

The Airport Bye-Laws for the Cork Airport and the Dublin Airport specifically ban monitoring air traffic control or airport or airline operational frequencies with radio receiving or recording equipment.

=== Italy ===

Owning a scanner that is able to intercept the frequencies of law enforcement is illegal and carries a jail sentence from eighteen months to five years, as per Article 617 of the Civil Penal Code.

=== Japan ===
It is legal to possess, install and operate a scanner in Japan. The radio law prohibits from disclosing or passing on information received to other persons and using the information to gain personal profit. It is illegal to listen to telephone communication and those transmitted using tapping devices. An amateur radio license is required when amateur radio apparatus is used to listen to radio.

=== Mexico ===

In Mexico, it is legal to have an unblocked scanner and listen to any radio spectrum frequencies, including encrypted and cellular band. According to the Federal Law of General Ways of Communication, individuals are prohibited from spreading any information obtained via a scanner.

=== Netherlands ===

In the Netherlands, it is legal to listen to any radio spectrum frequency because of the &quot;freedom of information&quot;-doctrine. However, if a &quot;special&quot; (i.e., unusual) effort is needed to intercept the information on a frequency (such as decrypting encrypted traffic or using an unauthorized or bootleg radio), then it is considered illegal. In 2008, the Dutch Supreme Court ruled that receivers that can solely be used to detect certain frequencies (such as radar detectors) are illegal because they cannot be used to &quot;convey knowledge or thoughts&quot; and thus are not covered by the aforementioned doctrine.

=== New Zealand ===

In New Zealand, according to section 133A of the Radiocommunications Act of 1989, it is legal to possess and use a scanner at any time to tune to any private voice radio (but not encrypted data), provided that private information is not passed on or disclosed to any other person(s) or party(s).

=== Switzerland ===
Possession of a radio scanner is legal in Switzerland. However, it may only be used to listen to public radio traffic such as CB radio and amateur radio, as well as airband frequencies.

=== United Kingdom ===

In the United Kingdom, it is not illegal to own or use a scanner except in particular circumstances. For example, particular transmissions or frequencies should only be listened to with authorization an example of this being UK aviation frequencies and police radio, which in many other countries may be publicly listened to (and are even available to be streamed online) but in the UK are restricted. Many emergency services have now switched to digital encrypted radio systems, so that it is more difficult for the general public to listen to them.

=== United States ===
The legality of radio scanners in the United States varies considerably between jurisdictions, although it is a federal crime to monitor encrypted cellular phone calls. Five U.S. states restrict the use of a scanner in an automobile. Although scanners capable of following trunked radio systems and demodulating some digital radio systems such as APCO Project 25 are available, decryption-capable scanners would be a violation of United States law and possibly laws of other countries.

A law passed by the Congress of the United States, under the pressure from cellular telephone interests, prohibited scanners sold after a certain date from receiving frequencies allocated to the Cellular Radio Service. The law was later amended to make it illegal to modify radios to receive those frequencies, and also to sell radios that could be easily modified to do so. This law remains in effect even though no cellular subscribers still use analog technology. There are Canadian and European unblocked versions available, but these are illegal to import into the U.S. Frequencies used by early cordless phones at 43.720–44.480 MHz, 46.610–46.930 MHz, and 902.000–906.000 MHz can still be picked up by many commercially available scanners, however. The proliferation of scanners led most cordless phone manufacturers to produce cordless handsets operating on a more secure 2.4 GHz system using spread-spectrum technology. Certain states in the United States such as New York and Florida, prohibit the use of scanners in a vehicle unless the operator has a radio license issued from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) (Amateur Radio, etc.) or the operator&#x27;s job requires the use of a scanner in a vehicle (e.g., police, fire, utilities). Many scanner user manuals include a warning saying that, while it is legal to listen to almost every transmission a scanner can receive, but there are some that persons should not intentionally listen to (such as telephone conversations, pager transmissions, or any scrambled or encrypted transmissions) under the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, and that modifications to do so are illegal.

In some parts of the United States, there are extra penalties for the possession of a scanner during a crime, and some states, such as Michigan, also prohibit the possession of a scanner by a person who has been convicted of a felony in the last five years.

It is illegal to use police scanners while driving in Florida, Indiana, Kentucky, New York, and Minnesota.

It is also illegal to use police scanners in furtherance of a crime in California, New Jersey, Michigan, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont, Virginia, Nebraska and West Virginia.

Many people including siren enthusiasts, aviation enthusiasts, and more use scanner audio or footage and post them online or live-stream them. Older people who are involved in these group (mainly siren enthusiasts) have said that putting siren activation tones in videos is either illegal or dangerous. Their reasoning is that in 2017 a very large siren system in Dallas, Texas had been hacked and all of the sirens in Dallas County went off in the middle of the night. According to some siren enthusiasts the hack was done by using a two-way radio and using a video online using activation tones from Dallas County&#x27;s dispatch center. The hacker then transmitted the video with tones in it over the dispatch frequency which led to all of the sirens going off in Dallas. More of these hacks happened in places such as Cincinnati, Ohio, Milwaukee, Wisconsin and other cities. After this many siren enthusiasts stopped putting activation tones in videos so that they would not be used maliciously. A lot of arguments in the siren community have spun up after these hacks. Some enthusiasts began altering or pitch shifting tones so that they do not sound like the real activation tones and some still keep them in there, however they put a disclaimer in the description of the video saying they will not be held responsible for misuse of activation tones. The reason why activation tones are in videos in the first place is to alert the enthusiasts of when said siren is about to go off. With this being in mind, this is what some sources say about putting scanner audio in videos (including tones). Section 705 of the Communications Act States that: No person not being authorized by the sender shall intercept any radio communication and divulge or publish the existence, contents, substance, purport, effect, or meaning of such intercepted communication to any person. 47 U.S.C. § 605(a). The penalties for violating this section are severe: a fine of not more than $2000, imprisonment, or both or, where such violation is “willful&quot; and for purposes of direct or indirect commercial advantage or private financial gain,” a fine of up to $50,000 and imprisonment of not more than two years for the first such conviction and up to $100,000 and five years for subsequent convictions. In addition, the statute provides for a private civil remedy to any person aggrieved by a violation of this section. The FCC regulations implementing this section more specifically provide those messages originated by “privately-owned non-broadcast stations . . . may be broadcast only upon receipt of prior permission from the non-broadcast licensee.” When people read this, they took it as putting scanner broadcasts online is illegal. This is not true because it only refers to the interception of broadcasts. This means it is still legal to put scanner audio in videos, but you cannot re-broadcast them over said frequency. Since most police, fire, EMS, and public safety frequencies are public and publicly available in the FCC Database, you can still put audio in videos no matter what the audio is.

In the United States, licensed amateur radio operators with a valid FCC license may possess amateur radio transceivers capable of reception beyond the amateur radio bands per an FCC Memorandum &amp; Order known as FCC Docket PR91-36 (also known as FCC 93-410).

<doc id="1035576" wikidata="Q837996" url="?curid=1035576" title="Super Dollfie">
<text>, often abbreviated SD, is a brand of ball-jointed doll, or BJD, made by the Japanese company Volks. They are made to be easy to customize and are primarily marketed to adult doll collectors and customizers. They are cast in polyurethane resin, a porcelain-like, hard, dense plastic. The most common standard models are about 60 cm, or 24 inches, tall, taller and heavier than most comparable Western dolls. They are designed in a style which is both realistic and influenced by anime, and most models are anatomically correct. The various body parts have ball joints for articulation, and are strung together with a thick elastic cord.

The term &quot;dollfie&quot; is a portmanteau formed from the words &quot;doll&quot; and &quot;figure&quot;. The original Dollfie dolls are Barbie sized vinyl figures, and the term &quot;Super Dollfie&quot; was introduced to distinguish the larger resin dolls. Super Dollfie, or even just Dollfie, are sometimes erroneously used as a generic terms to refer to BJDs made by other companies. However, both Super Dollfie and Dollfie are registered trademarks and should only be used for Volks products.

==Overview==
Super Dollfie dolls are made to be easy to customize. The hair is a wig that can easily be changed. The head can be opened to change the eyes and adjust the stringing. The face paint can be removed and the head repainted. Optional hands and feet are available, and heads and other body parts are removable and interchangeable. The resin parts themselves can be carved or sanded to reshape them.

Super Dollfie are not widely distributed, and, with a few exceptions, new dolls are only available directly through Volks own events or stores, either online, or through their brick and mortar stores called &quot;Tenshi no Sumika&quot; (angel&#x27;s nest), located throughout Japan, in South Korea and until March 2014 in Los Angeles, California.

Super Dollfie are collectible, customizable dolls marketed to adults. They vary in price from about 36 000 yen (about US $400) for the smallest, unassembled standard models, up to about 150 000 yen (about US $2000) for the most exclusive larger limited dolls that come with outfits and accessories.

On the secondary market, limited and skillfully customized Super Dollfie often fetch a price far higher than the original. There is a thriving second hand market online, where dolls are bought and sold on auction sites, as well as forums.

New models are regularly released at &quot;Dolls Party&quot;, or &quot;Dolpa&quot;, (:ja:ドールズパーティー) promotional convention-like events organized by Volks several times a year in locations around Japan. Here fans can buy and sell limited and customized dolls, accessories and clothes. Dolpas have grown in scale over the years and the Dolls Party held at Tokyo Big Sight regularly has 15 000 attendees.

&quot;Tenshi no Sato&quot; (angel&#x27;s home) in Kyoto is Volks headquarters and Super Dollfie museum. Here exclusive doll models are sold, and events are held where special limited editions are released. Doll repair services are also available and classes are held teaching various customization methods. Tenshi no Sato is surrounded by a traditional Japanese garden where visitors can photograph their dolls. To gain entrance visitors have to book reservations in advance.

Following the introduction of Super Dollfie an increasing number of Asian ball-jointed doll companies have been established, most of them based in South Korea.

==History==

In the late 1990s Volks produced a line of 1:6 scale articulated vinyl figures for hobbyist customers to finish to their own taste. Volks named these figures &quot;Dollfie&quot;, a portmanteau of &quot;doll&quot; and &quot;figure&quot;.

The first &quot;Super Dollfie&quot; was designed in 1999 by the sculptor Akihiro Enku. Enku sculpted a one-off doll for his wife, 57 cm tall, in what would become the Super Dollfie size and style. An executive director at Volks noticed the doll and wondered if they would be made in larger numbers.

The first Super Dollfie release was four different models, Kira, Nana, Sara and Megu, which all shared the same head mold, the standard SD &quot;Four Sisters&quot; head.

At this time Volks was a producer of resin figure kits, and the early Super Dollfie were made and sold similarly to resin kits, in very small quantities (almost build to order), and in parts, for the customer to assemble. Volks has stated that they were trying to create a female market for resin kits, which were male dominated up to that point.

The first generation SD bodies were highly detailed, but had some difficulty remaining standing, and their ball joints were very prominent.

All Super Dollfie dolls were female, until 2001 when the first boy doll, Licht, was released. The first release was a limited run of only 50 dolls, but sales were so successful that the doll was rereleased two times, and many other male dolls followed.

In 2003, Volks released a new &#x27;skin type&#x27; (resin mixture) of the dolls called &quot;Pure Skin&quot;. Pure skin has a less plastic and more skin-like, translucent look and feel. The Super Dollfie body was improved with better poseability and less conspicuous ball joints. During the change, Volks gradually phased out production of &quot;old skin&quot; dolls in favor of pure skin.

Old skin body parts were available separately, so buyers could easily get pieces and assemble their own custom doll. After the change to pure skin, only certain hands and feet are available to buy as optional parts, and only a few pure skin head molds and body types are readily available as completed standard models. The majority of Super Dollfie models are now only available as limited editions, already assembled, painted, and fully clothed.

Following the 2003 changes of the dolls, Volks expanded their business internationally. The same year they held the first Dolpa in South Korea, and also opened the first Korean store. In 2004 the Super Dollfie museum &quot;Tenshi no Sato&quot; was opened in Kyoto. In November 2005 Volks USA opened their first American Tenshi no Sumika store in Los Angeles, California, and they have been holding Dolpa events in New York City every summer since 2006.

In 2008 Japan Today reported that Volks annual sales were $50 million and that they have about 30 shops worldwide.

==Culture==
There is a sizeable community dedicated to Super Dollfie and other ball-jointed dolls. The largest English BJD forum has over 30,000 members as of March 2011. Doll owners customize their dolls and share photos and photo stories online. The dolls are usually named by their owner, and sometimes assigned individual characteristics and personality traits. In the West, enthusiasts organize offline doll meetups and conventions, which include other BJDs along with Super Dollfie. In Japan, Volks hold Dolpa conventions and Tenshi no Sumika store meetups. These are exclusively Super Dollfie events, and other BJD brands are not allowed.

Super Dollfie is associated with the Gothic Lolita and Lolita fashion subcultures in Japan, as well as the Cosplay subculture, with some dressing their Super Dollfie up as famous characters. Volks have a history of collaborating with Lolita fashion designers going back to 2002, when they released limited edition Super Dollfie with clothes designed by Baby, The Stars Shine Bright, Black Peace Now and Atelier-Pierrot.

The character Momoko from the Lolita fashion-themed movie Kamikaze Girls was released as a limited Super Dollfie, wearing a Baby, The Stars Shine Bright outfit, coinciding with the release of the movie in Japan in 2004. Baby, The Stars Shine Bright have created several other Super Dollfie outfits as well. Some sold separately, some with limited edition dolls. They have also made matching human and doll sized outfits, like the outfits worn by the limited edition Toppi and Luna released in early 2007.

The Gothic Lolita fashion designer H. Naoto created an exclusive outfit for a limited Super Dollfie in 2006, and have since created several other Super Dollfie outfits.

Super Dollfie are influenced by the anime style, but they also have some more direct ties with anime and manga. In 2003, the android character Chi from the manga and anime Chobits, as well as Yumi and Sachiko from Maria-sama ga Miteru were produced as limited edition Super Dollfie. The main characters in the manga and anime Rozen Maiden are all BJD-like &quot;living dolls&quot;, and five of them were released as limited Super Dollfie dolls in 2005 and 2007.

Super Dollfie have also been featured in various work. A fashion shoot with Super Dollfie was featured in the November 2007 issue of Vogue Nippon. The virtual band Mistula is composed of customized ball-jointed dolls, several of which are Super Dollfie. The 2006 &quot;Kawaii&quot; episode of the British TV series Japanorama featured a segment on Super Dollfie.

==Super Dollfie models==
Super Dollfie, or SD, was the first model, introduced in 1999. The current pure skin models are about 55 cm (22 inches) tall, while the original version was slightly taller at 57 cm (23 inches). Among fans they are sometimes referred to as &quot;Super Dollfie 10&quot; or &quot;SD10&quot; to specifically refer to the size versus the whole line of dolls.

Super Dollfie 13, or SD13, are more mature and slightly taller than the plain Super Dollfie, SD13 boys are 60 cm (24 inches), and girls 57 cm. When they were released in December 2001 they were an improvement on the original SD body, with less prominent ball joints.

Mini Super Dollfie, or MSD, are more childlike and shorter, about 42 cm (17 inches) tall. They were introduced in September 2001.

The standard names SD, SD13 and MSD, or just &quot;mini&quot;, are sometimes used to describe the size of BJDs from other companies as well, compare with Ball-jointed doll sizes and types.

Yo-SD, from the Japanese , are only available as limited editions, but they have been released several times. Younger looking than MSD, they are 26.5 cm tall, and were first released in 2004.

DearSD, or Dear Super Dollfie, is the latest available Super Dollfie model. It was first released in 2015, in commemoration of the 16th anniversary of Super Dollfie. The DearSD is very similar in height to the MSD, standing at 43 cm tall. However, the proportions of a DearSD are more childlike since the DearSD is meant to depict a toddler. The DearSD body is asexual, allowing owners of this doll to customize it into a boy or a girl. The DearSD is currently a limited model, made available for sale in small batches to collectors in Japan. It will be sold again in limited runs, but a date for the next sale has yet to be announced.

In addition to these models, there are also the limited edition SD16 and SD17, which are more mature than SD13 and about 65 cm (25.6 inches) tall, and SDCute, which are about as tall as MSD, but more mature. The regular SD versions are anatomically correct, but there are also limited genderless &quot;Tenshi&quot;, or angel, editions. Sei-Tenshi and Rei-Tenshi are smaller than Yo-SD and not for sale, but only given out at promotional events.

Super Dollfie buyers can also create a customized doll with the &quot;Full Choice System&quot;, or FCS. Through FCS, the buyer selects from various options including body type, head mold, eye color, wig style, and cosmetics style, and the doll is then assembled by Volks. Different FCS head molds are distinguished by numbers, not names like the pre-assembled models, with for example F-16 being a popular mold. FCS is not available online, but only through Volks physical Tenshi no Sumika stores or through Tenshi no Sato, where the FCS service has additional options.

<text>A toaster pastry is a type of bakers&#x27; confection. They are thin rectangles often made of rice bran, molasses, flour, syrup, and shortening, which on one side usually has a coating of icing that has been dried with starch. They contain sweet, syrupy fillings, often fruit preserves or other flavoring ingredients such as chocolate or cinnamon. As the name suggests, toaster pastries are often heated in a toaster or oven. They are already fully cooked however, and may be eaten unheated as well.

==Brands==
The following list includes some popular brands of toaster pastries:
* Pop-Tarts: the top selling brand of toaster pastry for many years, first introduced by Kellogg&#x27;s in 1964.
* Toast&#x27;em Pop Ups: Toast&#x27;ems began production in February 1964 as Post Country Squares. The name changed in 1965 to Toast&#x27;em Pop Ups. The brand was sold to Schulze and Burch in 1971.
* Toaster Strudels: Pillsbury&#x27;s Toaster Strudel is a toaster pastry meant to taste like a traditional German strudel with icing. The icing comes in a removable plastic package, and the pastries must be frozen, unlike other toaster pastries.
* Toastettes: Nabisco (which is now owned by Kraft Foods) created their toaster pastry in 1967 called &quot;Toastettes&quot;, to compete with Kellogg&#x27;s Pop-Tarts. The brand was discontinued in 2002 after a failed marketing effort to tie Toastettes in with Nabisco&#x27;s children&#x27;s brands. Nabisco also made toaster pastries with the name &quot;Kool Stuf&quot;, which was also later discontinued.
* Toastables: The Quaker Oats Company, now a subsidiary of PepsiCo, produces &quot;Toastables&quot;.
* Nature&#x27;s Path: Developing many flavors, Nature&#x27;s Path creates organic toaster pastries.

<doc id="1035585" wikidata="Q1158206" url="?curid=1035585" title="Damani Ralph">
<text>Damani Ralph (born 6 November 1980) is a Jamaican retired footballer who played as a forward. His professional career spanned five years, two with Chicago Fire S.C. (2003–2004) and three with FC Rubin Kazan (2005–2007). He also earned 18 caps with the Jamaica national football team from 2002 to 2005. He has been a Licensed FIFA player agent with ICM Stellar Sports since 2011 and is currently its vice president of soccer in North America.
==Early life and career==
Ralph began playing football as a boy in Jamaica. This included time with Harbour View and St. George&#x27;s College before moving to the United States. Ralph began his career in America playing college soccer at Meridian Community College in Meridian, Mississippi, where he scored 59 goals in 45 games and was named MVP of the NJCAA Tournament. After two years with Meridian, Ralph left for the University of Connecticut, where he continued his dominant play. During his two years at Connecticut he scored 28 goals and added 11 assists, and was a Hermann Trophy finalist his senior year.

==Professional==

===Major League Soccer===

Ralph was drafted 18th overall by the Chicago Fire in the 2003 MLS SuperDraft. He quickly earned a spot in the starting lineup, and finished the season with 11 goals and 6 assists in 25 games. In scoring 11 goals, Ralph broke the MLS record for goals scored by a rookie, previously held by Rodrigo Faria, Josh Wolff, and Jeff Cunningham, and was named MLS Rookie of the Year for his accomplishments. In his second year with the Fire, he scored 11 goals again and added 3 assists to lead the team in scoring. Ralph scored the game-winning goal in the 2003 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup final to win the Fire their third U.S. Open Cup.

===Europe===

Ralph got to contributing to the Fire almost immediately, which quickly caught the attention of European teams. In 2004, following his rookie season, there were rumors that Ralph would move to the Spanish club Malaga, but MLS turned down a reputed $1 million (U.S.) transfer offer. However, in 2005 Ralph finally secured his long desired transfer to Europe. The move was for undisclosed terms - thought to be $2 million (U.S.) - to Russian Club FC Rubin Kazan. The contract would run for three years with a starting yearly salary of $650,000.

In his first season for Rubin, he scored only twice in 25 league games as his team gained a fourth-place finish.

==Injury and retirement==
In February 2006, before the new Russian season started, Ralph had surgery in Germany to repair damage to his left knee. Later that year he was treated for a second time and he was sidelined for over 2.5 years after undergoing a third consecutive knee operation at the start of 2008.

===Attempted Return to MLS===
After almost three years out of professional football due to injury, during which he finished his economics degree at the University of Connecticut, Ralph reappeared on trial with Major League Soccer club New York Red Bulls during their 2010 pre-season. The trial ended without a contract offer from the club.

==International career==
Ralph struggled to cement a starting place on the Jamaica national team, largely because of competition from a number of naturalized Jamaican forwards from England. He made his debut in an August 2002 friendly match against Grenada and earned 18 caps, scoring once. He played in 8 FIFA World Cup qualification matches.

His final international was an October 2005 friendly against Australia.

<doc id="1035587" wikidata="Q4750906" url="?curid=1035587" title="Anahim Volcanic Belt">
<text>The Anahim Volcanic Belt (AVB) is a west–east trending chain of volcanoes and related magmatic features in British Columbia, Canada. It extends from Athlone Island on the Central Coast, running eastward through the strongly uplifted and deeply dissected Coast Mountains to near the community of Nazko on the Interior Plateau. The AVB is delineated as three west-to-east segments that differ in age and structure. A wide variety of igneous rocks with differing compositions occur throughout these segments, comprising landforms such as volcanic cones, volcanic plugs, lava domes, shield volcanoes and intrusions.

Volcanic activity has occurred repeatedly in the AVB for the last 15 million years, during which time three major magmatic episodes took place 15–13, 9–6 and 3–1 million years ago. These major magmatic episodes are represented by plutons, dike swarms, volcanic fields and large shield volcanoes. Volcanic activity in the last 1 million years has been relatively minor and localized, having produced small lava flows and cones. The last eruptive period took place at the easternmost end of the volcanic belt 7,200 years ago, with magma-induced earthquakes having occurred as recently as 2007–2008.

==Geology==

The AVB is one of the six volcanic provinces in British Columbia that formed during the Neogene–Quaternary period. It consists mainly of alkaline to peralkaline rocks that range from oversaturated, highly evolved phonolites and rhyolites to more undersaturated lavas. Several AVB centres overlie Miocene flood basalts of the Chilcotin Group, which in turn overlie Devonian to Jurassic rocks of the Stikinia volcanic arc terrane. In some places the AVB lavas imperceptibly merge with the Chilcotin Group basalts as the two volcanic zones were active simultaneously from the Neogene to Quaternary.

This west–east trending volcanic belt is about long, extending from the Central Coast through the Coast Mountains to near the community of Nazko on the Interior Plateau. Its orientation is unique among the Neogene–Quaternary volcanic provinces of British Columbia in that it is perpendicular to the major geomorphological, structural and tectonic elements of the Canadian Cordillera. Three segments comprise the AVB: the western segment, which has been reduced to remnants of eruptive breccia, high-level plutons and dike swarms; the central segment, which consists of predominantly shield volcanoes; and the eastern segment, which consists of several small cinder cones and is the location of all modern volcanic activity.

Several tectonic models have been proposed to explain the origin of the AVB. These include rifting, a mantle hotspot, a plate-edge effect or slab window leading to magma ascent along the northern edge of the Juan de Fuca Plate, or a propagating crack controlled by stress fields related to large-scale plate tectonics of western North America. The generally preferred tectonic model is a mantle hotspot as the AVB decreases in age from west to east, a trend that is consistent with the westward motion of North America at the rate of about per year. There are also observed chemical differences between the oldest (western) and youngest (eastern) basalts. The youngest basalts are undersaturated alkaline lavas and are classified as basanite, suggesting a deeper source zone for magma in the Nazko area compared to the rest of the AVB.

===Western segment===
The Bella Bella and Gale Passage dike swarms on the Central Coast of British Columbia form the westernmost extent of the AVB. They are both over wide, with individual dikes measuring up to thick. Both swarms attain K–Ar ages of 12.5 to 14.5 million years and consist of a bimodal suite of basalt, trachyte and comendite. Basaltic and comenditic dikes are the most abundant, distributed in about equal proportions. Near the centre of each dike swarm are erosional remnants of rhyolite breccia with locally occurring rhyolite flows that comprise the Bella Bella Formation. The breccias contain a high content of coarse basement clasts, indicating that they are the product of explosive volcanism. Rhyolites associated with the Bella Bella dike swarm are distributed on Denny Island whereas rhyolites belonging to the Gale Passage dike swarm are found on the northern ends of Athlone Island and Dufferin Island.

Exposed in high cliffs along the Dean and Burke channels is the King Island Pluton. This easterly trending intrusion has a length of over and a width of , cutting across the predominantly northwest structural trend of the Coast Plutonic Complex. Two distinct phases of magmatism created the King Island Pluton 10.3 to 13 million years ago. The first and principal phase formed the core of the pluton which comprises coarse-grained syenite. These rocks form most of the pluton exposures at sea level. The second phase resulted in the creation of a marginal zone of alkali granite at the extreme western end of the King Island Pluton, as well as satellite stocks west of the main pluton.

===Central segment===

Three large shield volcanoes and two locally extensive volcanic fields form the central AVB. They are chemically bimodal, consisting mainly of mafic and felsic lavas with almost no intermediate lavas having been verified. The shield volcanoes share a similar evolution, having formed by an early stage of predominately voluminous felsic volcanism and a late stage of relatively minor mafic volcanism. Although the felsic lavas produced during the early evolutionary stage were high in silica content, they remained fluid enough to build felsic shields.

The volcanic fields consist of lavas that range from basanites and trachybasalts to evolved trachytes and phonolites. They comprise several small volcanoes that are in the form of cones, domes and plugs, most of which likely experienced episodic and short-lived activity. In contrast, the few larger structures in each volcanic field experienced multiple eruptive events over a longer timespan. Both fields were active contemporaneously throughout much of the Pleistocene.

====Shield volcanoes====
The Rainbow Range is a diameter, moderately dissected shield volcano that was active 8.7 to 6.7 million years ago. Four volcanic episodes characterized by highly fluid alkaline and peralkaline lava flows created an thick assemblage exposed on the north flank. A basal sequence of comenditic trachyte flows are unconformably overlain by flows and flow breccias of mugearite which in turn are overlain by a thick sequence of columnar-jointed comendite flows. Late stage volcanism resulted in the creation of scattered hawaiite dikes, plugs and minor capping flows over the north flank. Accompanying the northeastern flank is Anahim Peak, a trachyte plug surrounded by a pile of hawaiite flows that are four to eight times thicker than those of the Rainbow Range. The abnormal thicknesses of the Anahim Peak hawaiite flows coupled with a significantly coarser-grained groundmass and higher percentage of phenocrysts than the upper portions of the flows suggest that they were ponded during eruption, possibly as lava lakes within a former cinder cone.
To the east lies the Ilgachuz Range, a slightly smaller and less deeply dissected shield volcano that formed 6.1 to 4.0 million years ago. Its nearly circular and gently sloping structure, in diameter, consists of four assemblages that were deposited in six major episodes of activity. The lower shield assemblage represents the oldest exposed rocks in the Ilgachuz Range. It comprises pyroclastic breccias, domes and lava flows of alkali rhyolite that have been hydrothermally altered. The overlying upper shield assemblage, which forms the bulk of the Ilgachuz Range, encompasses a series of comendite and pantellerite flows and domes that are interbedded with flows of alkali basalt and hawaiite. Formation of the shield was followed by collapse of a small central caldera in which the intracaldera assemblage was deposited. This assemblage consists of a thick sequence of tuffs that are overlain by a ponded single cooling unit of trachyte more than in thickness. The postcaldera assemblage comprises alkali basalt and hawaiite flows that issued from flank vents and from a few small vents within the central caldera. These are the youngest lavas of the Ilgachuz Range.

The Itcha Range is the easternmost and youngest of the three AVB shield volcanoes, having formed between 3.8 and 0.8 million years ago. With a diameter of , the Itcha Range is also the smallest AVB shield. Its structure is unique among the AVB shields in that it consists of small coalescing volcanic units rather than a stratiform volcanic pile. The basal unit comprises a series of aphyric trachyte flows and domes with minor flow-banded rhyolite, rhyolitic tuffs and thin hawaiite flows. This unit is overlain by a sequence of alkali-feldspar porphyritic trachytes which occur as pyroclastic deposits as well as small lava flows and domes. These trachytes are overlain and intruded by alkali-feldspar porphyritic quartz-trachytic and trachytic plugs, lava flows, pyroclastic flows, debris flows and dikes in the middle of the shield. The uppermost shield-forming unit consists of megacrystic trachyte flows that are distributed throughout the western part of the Itcha Range. Formation of the shield was followed by the eruption of basanites, alkali basalts and hawaiites from small cinder cones, tuff rings and fissures in the eastern half of the shield.

====Volcanic fields==== 
The Satah Mountain volcanic field is a linear region of cones and domes extending south from the Itcha Range to just north of Chantslar Lake. Volcanism along the entire length of the volcanic field 2.5 to 1.4 million years ago was characterized by the eruption of generally small volumes of magma that erupted at various times and at various locations. The eruption rates were high enough to build a north–south trending ridge upon which most of the volcanoes are located. This elongated feature, known as Satah Ridge, rises above the surrounding plateau surface with an average topographic prominence of . The alignment of the Satah Mountain volcanic field corresponds with the orientation of two sets of normal faults in the Itcha Range, suggesting that volcanism there may have been controlled by a fault system. More than 20 volcanoes have been identified throughout the Satah Mountain volcanic field, with Satah Mountain and Mount Punkutlaenkut being the largest. Smaller centres include Jorgensen Hill, Sugarloaf Mountain, Turbo Lake, White Creek and Holte Creek.

The Baldface Mountain volcanic field is a group of scattered cones east of the Itcha Range. Argon–argon dating of seven cones indicate the volcanic field was active 2.5 to 0.91 million years ago, during which time the Itcha Range and the Satah Mountain volcanic field were also areas of volcanicity. Baldface Mountain is the largest and one of the oldest volcanoes in the Baldface Mountain volcanic field. It consists of a 2.37 million year old cone of aphanitic phonolite and porphyritic trachyte with feldspar phenocrysts. A basaltic lava flow near the head of Moore Creek has an age of 3.91 million years, similar to the oldest rocks known from the Itcha Range or the Chilcotin Group basalts of the surrounding plateau. The relation of this flow to the Baldface Mountain volcanic field is in question as its source and extent have not been identified.

===Eastern segment===

Nazko Cone is the main eruptive centre forming the eastern segment of the AVB. It consists of overlapping piles of basaltic flows and cones that were formed during at least three eruptive periods. The first volcanic episode is represented by a subaerial basalt flow that forms the base of the volcano. It was deposited during a Pleistocene interglacial stage 0.34 million years ago and is extensively eroded. The second episode is constituted by a subglacial mound of hyaloclastite that formed under the Cordilleran Ice Sheet, perhaps during the Fraser Glaciation which took place between 25,000 and 10,000 years ago. It forms the western side of Nazko Cone and is dominated by blocks of highly vesicular, glassy basalt. The third episode is defined by coalescing pyroclastic cones and associated lava flows that formed subaerially during the Holocene. Radiocarbon dating of bog peat above and below a tephra layer near Nazko Cone suggest that the latest eruption took place about 7,200 years ago. This is the only known Holocene eruption from Nazko Cone as no other tephra layers have been identified.

From 9 October 2007 to 15 May 2008, a series of earthquakes measuring up to 2.9 magnitude occurred in the Nechako Basin about west of Nazko Cone. Most of them occurred below the surface, indicating they originated within the lowermost crust. Analysis of seismic waves suggest that the earthquake swarm was caused by brittle failure and fracturing of rock at depth from magma intrusion. No volcanic eruption was likely as the number and size of the tremors were too small. Although these volcano tectonic earthquakes were too small to be felt, they generated substantial local interest as they represented a significant concentration of seismic activity within the Anahim Volcanic Belt.

<text>The Biu–Mandara or Central Chadic languages of the Afro-Asiatic family are spoken in Nigeria, Chad and Cameroon.

A reconstruction of Proto-Central Chadic has been proposed by Gravina (2014).

==Languages==
===Gravina (2014)===
Gravina (2014) classifies Central Chadic as follows, as part of a reconstruction of the proto-language. Letters and numbers in parentheses correspond to branches in previous classifications. The greatest changes are breaking up and reassigning the languages of the old Mafa branch (A.5) and Mandage (Kotoko) branch (B.1).

<text>The Battle of Baxter Springs, more commonly known as the Baxter Springs Massacre, was a minor battle of the American Civil War fought on October 6, 1863, near the present-day town of Baxter Springs, Kansas.

In late 1863, Quantrill&#x27;s Raiders, a large band of pro-Confederate bushwhackers led by William Quantrill, was traveling south through Kansas along the Texas Road to winter in Texas. Numbering about 400, this group captured and killed two Union teamsters who had come from a small Federal Army post called Fort Baxter (frequently referred to as Fort Blair). The bushwhackers assaulted the fort but were repulsed, eventually retreating to the prairie, where they attacked a separate Union column, leaving only a few survivors.

==Fight at the fort==
Quantrill decided to attack Fort Baxter and divided his force into two columns, one under him and the other commanded by a subordinate, David Poole. Poole and his men proceeded down the Texas Road, where they encountered Union soldiers, most of whom were African Americans. They chased and attacked the Union troops, killing some before the soldiers reached the earth-and-log Fort Baxter. The garrison there consisted of about 25 cavalry and 65–70 infantry of the United States Colored Troops.

Poole&#x27;s column attacked the fort, but the garrison fought them off. First Lieutenant James Burton Pond received the Medal of Honor for leading the defense of the fort. The citation for his Medal of Honor reads:

:For extraordinary heroism on 6 October 1863, while serving with Company C, 3d Wisconsin Cavalry, in action at Baxter Springs, Kansas. While in command of two companies of Cavalry, First Lieutenant Pond was surprised and attacked by several times his own number of guerrillas, but gallantly rallied his men, and after a severe struggle drove the enemy outside the fortifications.. First Lieutenant Pond then went outside the works and, alone and unaided, fired a howitzer three times, throwing the enemy into confusion and causing him to retire.

The American flag remained standing over the fort thanks to the bravery of the 2nd Kansas Colored Infantry, who helped rally the federal soldiers.

==Massacre of Blunt&#x27;s column==
Moving out onto the prairie, Quantrill&#x27;s column encountered a Union detachment escorting Maj. Gen. James G. Blunt, who was moving his command headquarters south from Fort Scott, Kansas to Fort Smith, Arkansas. Quantrill&#x27;s men greatly outnumbered the Union forces.

Wearing Federal uniforms and thereby taking the Federals by surprise, Quantrill&#x27;s column killed most of the detachment, including many who attempted to surrender. Among the dead was a military band, Maj. Henry Z. Curtis (son of Maj. Gen. Samuel R. Curtis), and Johnny Fry (first official westbound rider of the Pony Express), a total of 103 men. Also killed was James R. O&#x27;Neill, an artist-correspondent for &quot;Leslie&#x27;s Weekly&quot;. When a few men escaped to Fort Baxter, soldiers went out to search for survivors; there were few, but Blunt was among them.

After the massacre of Blunt&#x27;s troops, Quantrill sent a demand ordering Pond to surrender the fort. Pond refused the surrender. Quantrill&#x27;s subordinate, William T. Anderson, known as &quot;Bloody Bill,&quot; wanted to attack the fort again, but Quantrill refused, and the guerrillas left for Texas.

==Aftermath==
Blunt was removed from command for failing to protect his column, but he was soon restored. Union supporters called the killings a massacre; the conflict at Baxter Springs was characteristic of the vicious Kansas–Missouri border warfare. Fort Baxter was temporarily reinforced, but by the end of 1863, the Union Army pulled its troops back to Fort Scott, which was better fortified. Before abandoning the fort, U.S. forces demolished it and removed everything usable to prevent use by the enemy. Quantrill and Anderson would continue to disagree on conducting warfare on the Kansas–Missouri border. In 1864, the two split their forces, limiting the bushwhackers&#x27; use to fighting in Missouri only.

Baxter Springs later developed as the first &quot;cow town&quot; in Kansas, a way station for cattle drives to markets and railroads further north. By 1875, it had a population estimated at 5,000.

<doc id="1035594" wikidata="Q1134269" url="?curid=1035594" title="Rinoa Heartilly">
<text>is a character and the co-protagonist of Square&#x27;s (now Square Enix) 1999 role-playing video game &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot;. She is a teenaged member of a resistance faction known as the Forest Owls. After she recruits protagonist Squall Leonhart and his friends, she decides to stay with his group and falls in love with Squall in the process. During their adventure, she is briefly possessed by the evil sorceress Ultimecia and becomes a sorceress herself once the spirit leaves her body. After defeating Ultimecia, Rinoa and Squall become a couple. Rinoa has also made cameo appearances in other &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; and Square Enix games.

Character artist Tetsuya Nomura designed her to be cute, not beautiful, as he wanted to create a character whose personality would leave an impression on the player. He felt that the more realistic graphical capabilities the original PlayStation could provide, along with advances like full motion video, made female characters too beautiful and was overshadowing their personalities. The design team set out from the beginning to make Rinoa&#x27;s clothing more realistic than past &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games.

Critics and players alike have praised Rinoa for her personality and her beauty. They also praised her romance with Squall, calling both their relationship and &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot; one of the most romantic &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; titles. Some reviewers, however, called their relationship forced and criticized that they expressed their feelings so late in the story.

==Character design==
Character artist Tetsuya Nomura found Rinoa the hardest character to design in &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot;. Nomura emphasized that he tried to avoid letting the possibilities presented by the recent advancements in full-motion video technology become the entire focus. He believed that these innovations might tempt developers to make their female characters &quot;too beautiful&quot; and focus more on physical appearance than personality. With this concern in mind, Nomura set out to avoid making Rinoa gorgeous and simply make her &quot;cute&quot; instead. To further emphasize this, he wrote a list of vocabulary traits and physical habits for Rinoa&#x27;s character that he felt conveyed this idea of &quot;cute, not gorgeous&quot;, and sent them to scenario writer Kazushige Nojima along with the character&#x27;s design.

Designers also based Rinoa&#x27;s appearance on feedback Nojima got after developing &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;. The women on the development team wanted a different design as they were concerned it was not realistic for a female character to fight in a miniskirt. Yoshinori Kitase, the director of &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot;, designed the game&#x27;s logo, which shows a male and female character embracing. Kitase wanted to make fans curious about why the couple was embracing. The games&#x27; Event Director Hiroki Chiba said that his favorite moment in the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; franchise was Squall and Rinoa&#x27;s embrace with Faye Wong&#x27;s &quot;Eyes On Me&quot; playing. Chiba listened to the song many times to make the scene&#x27;s action line up precisely.

For the &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; series, some parts of Squall&#x27;s design were changed to reference Rinoa&#x27;s, most notably the wings in his jacket. Nomura stated that the reason Rinoa did not appear in the franchise was because he did not have a clear understanding of Rinoa&#x27;s personality. Rinoa&#x27;s first voiced appearance was in &quot;Dissidia Final Fantasy NT&quot;, with Kana Hanazawa providing her voice in Japanese, and Skyler Davenport performing the English version.

==Appearances==
===In &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot;===
Rinoa Heartilly is the 17-year-old daughter of General Caraway, a high-ranking officer in the Galbadian army, and Julia Heartilly, a famous singer. Over the course of the game, she falls in love with the protagonist, Squall Leonhart. Rinoa is a member of the &quot;Forest Owls&quot;, a tiny resistance faction seeking to liberate the small nation of Timber from Galbadian occupation. She is called the &quot;princess&quot; of the group. Rinoa first meets Squall at the SeeD inauguration ball at Balamb Garden. During the dance, she manages to charm the usually antisocial Squall into dancing with her. She then hires Squall and his mercenary friends Zell Dincht and Selphie Tilmitt to fight for the Forest Owls. After failing to assassinate Sorceress Edea for her crimes against Timber, the Forest Owls escape the sorceress and Rinoa decides to stay with the group.

While at the Fishermans Horizon, she shares a moment with Squall during a concert performed by other members of her group. Later on, the evil Sorceress Ultimecia possesses Rinoa after losing control of Edea, which causes Rinoa to fall into a coma-like state. Ultimecia then uses Rinoa to release Sorceress Adel from her orbital prison. Ultimecia then possesses Adel and leaves Rinoa to die. Squall rescues her and the two share another personal moment on the Ragnarok spaceship. Rinoa discovers that she now has Edea&#x27;s magical powers from her time possessed by Ultimecia, making her a Sorceress as well. Fearful of sorceresses, the Esthar government imprisons her but Squall convinces himself to rescue her. During the game&#x27;s ending, she reunites with Squall and kisses him on the Balamb Garden balcony for the first time.

===Other appearances===
Rinoa appears in Square&#x27;s and Sony&#x27;s PlayStation 2 technology demo. Originally a pre-rendered video, the demo recreated the ballroom dance scene in real-time. She appears in several other games, such as the 2012 rhythm video game &quot;Theatrhythm Final Fantasy&quot; and in the role-playing video game &quot;Puzzle &amp; Dragons&quot; as part of a &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; collaboration. Her outfits are available for players to put on their characters in the video game &quot;Gunslinger Stratos 2&quot;. Rinoa, accompanied by her pet dog Angelo, appears as a playable character in &quot;Dissidia Final Fantasy NT&quot;. Rinoa and Angelo are also available for recruitment in the free-to-play mobile game &quot;Dissidia Opera Omnia&quot;.

==Reception==
Rinoa Heartilly has been mostly well received by video game critics and the general public. Japanese fans voted Rinoa as the tenth favorite female &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; character in an official Square Enix survey in 2013. In 2020 NHK conducted an All-&quot;Final Fantasy&quot; Grand Poll of Japanese players, with Rinoa ranked as the thirty fifth greatest &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; character by Japanese respondents. David Smith at &quot;IGN&quot; UK regarded her as one of the franchises&#x27; most memorable characters.

Natalie Flores from &quot;Paste Magazine&quot; praised her character arc as Rinoa starts as a pacifist heroine and becomes motivated to aid SeeD to defeat Edea and Ultimecia. Mike Gorby, writing for &quot;Goomba Stomp&quot;, observed that Rinoa subverts gender stereotypes and roles expected of a typical female character and compared her favorably to Squall as he found her more realistic. When &quot;Game Revolution&quot;″s Johnny Liu expressed the wish that the game had voice acting, he specifically mentioned Rinoa. She has been noted due to her beauty by multiple video game publications. &quot;IGN&quot;″s Justin Kaehler and Naomi Cheung remembered the &quot;hot&quot; Rinoa as one of the game&#x27;s main strengths. &quot;GamesRadar&quot; described her as &quot;rough around the polygonal edges&quot;, but also &quot;feminine enough to make fanboys latch on for years to come&quot;.

Some critics focused on the relationship between Rinoa and Squall. &quot;IGN&quot; noted that their first dance together was both cute and awkward. Aneni Soren of &quot;RPGamer&quot; wrote a feature article about the &quot;great&quot; relationship between Squall and Rinoa. Jenni Lada of &quot;TechnologyTell&quot; ranked &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot; as the third most romantic &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; game. &quot;IGN&quot;″s Ryan Clements called &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot; &quot;one of the best examples of the innocent relationship&quot; based on how subtle it was. &quot;IGN&quot; UK also ranked the pair as one of the best romances in &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; and gaming in general. &quot;RPGFan&quot; found their relationship complicated to like as despite Rinoa&#x27;s being easygoing with Squall on their first meetings with the protagonist, the fact that she previously dated the antagonistic Seifer made it complicated to take Rinoa properly and instead cannot find himself able to flirt with Rinoa back.

On the other hand, Charlie Barratt of &quot;GamesRadar&quot; listed her as an example of &quot;lazy character cliches&quot;. Ashley Reed of &quot;GamesRadar&quot; criticized the over-reliance of Rinoa&#x27;s character on the damsel in distress cliche, alongside other traits that made the character unlikable. Brett Elston, also from &quot;GamesRadar&quot;, believed her character was too stereotypical. Elston opined that the couple&#x27;s relationship was a &quot;most forced, uninteresting romance&quot; comparing them to the main cast from the film &quot;Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot;″s Jeff Lundigran criticized that they did not express their feelings until late in the game and that players expected more romance from the game&#x27;s promotional images. Reflecting on the divisive reception received, Flores from &quot;Paste Magazine&quot; called them the most misunderstood characters in the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series.

A popular fan theory about the game was that the overarching antagonist of &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot;, Ultimecia, is Rinoa from the future. Reed also included the theory of Rinoa being Ultimecia on the list of top nine lingering plotlines in video games. According to Glenn Morrow of &quot;RPGamer&quot;, most of the arguments in favor of it have potential but also opined that the theory is &quot;in no way&quot; plausible. Kitase debunked this theory when interviewed during the PAX West 2017 event, conceding that while there are similarities, such as both being sorceresses, they are not the same person.

===Legacy===
According to &quot;Official PlayStation Magazine&quot;, &quot;the &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot; characters have certainly been embraced by the Japanese gaming public. At the Tokyo Game Show [1999], there were hundreds of people dressed up as &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot; characters&quot;, including Rinoa. Scenario writer Kazushige Nojima said that &quot;it is scary to think about the impact that a game can give to the society&quot;. Art director Yusuke Naora also said that &quot;I sometimes really admire them for the time, energy, and money they spent on the costumes&quot;. Rinoa, an English post-metal group active from 2007 to 2010, was named after the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; character. The 2010 film &quot;Scott Pilgrim vs. the World&quot; includes a dream sequence referencing a similar scene involving Squall and Rinoa at the end of the game. In 2011, American beauty YouTuber Michelle Phan made a tutorial on how to recreate Rinoa Heartilly&#x27;s make-up.

<doc id="1035597" wikidata="Q1318674" url="?curid=1035597" title="Testbed">
<text>A testbed (also spelled test bed) is a platform for conducting rigorous, transparent, and replicable testing of scientific theories, computing tools, and new technologies.

The term is used across many disciplines to describe experimental research and new product development platforms and environments. They may vary from hands-on prototype development in manufacturing industries such as automobiles (known as &quot;mules&quot;), aircraft engines or systems and to intellectual property refinement in such fields as computer software development shielded from the hazards of testing live.

==Software development==

In software development, testbedding is a method of testing a particular module (function, class, or library) in an isolated fashion. It may be used as a proof of concept or when a new module is tested apart from the program or system it will later be added to. A skeleton framework is implemented around the module so that the module behaves as if already part of the larger program.

A typical testbed could include software, hardware, and networking components. In software development, the specified hardware and software environment can be set up as a testbed for the application under test. In this context, a testbed is also known as the test environment made of: 
* Testing hardware equipment (test bench, optical table, custom testing rig, dummy equipment as simulates an actual product or its counterpart, external environment means, like showers, heaters, fans, vacuum chamber, anechoic chamber).
* Computing equipment (processing units, data centers, in-line FPGA, environment simulation equipment).
* Testing software (DAQ / oscilloscopes, visualisation and testing software, environment software to feed dummy equipment with data).

Testbeds are also pages on the Internet where the public are given the opportunity to test CSS or HTML they have created and want to preview the results, for example:
* The Arena web browser was created by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and CERN for testing HTML3, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), Portable Network Graphics (PNG) and the libwww.
* The Line Mode browser got a new function to interact with the libwww library as a sample and test application.
* The libwww was also created to test network communication protocols which are under development or to experiment with new protocols.

==Aircraft development==

In aircraft development there are also examples of testbed use like in development of new aircraft engines when these are fitted to a testbed aircraft for flight testing. Such usage of testbeds was originally pioneered by Rolls Royce in their development of jet engines.

<text>The Lawrence Massacre (also known as Quantrill&#x27;s Raid) was an attack during the American Civil War (186165) by Quantrill&#x27;s Raiders, a Confederate guerrilla group led by William Quantrill, on the Unionist town of Lawrence, Kansas, killing around 150 men and boys.

The attack, on the morning of Friday August 21, 1863, targeted Lawrence due to the town&#x27;s long support of abolition and its reputation as a center for the Jayhawkers, who were free-state militia and vigilante groups known for attacking plantations in pro-slavery Missouri&#x27;s western counties.

It is the worst mass shooting in Kansas history.

==Background==

By 1863, Kansas had long been the center of strife and warfare over the admission of slave states versus free states.

In the summer of 1856, the first sacking of Lawrence sparked a guerrilla war in Kansas that lasted for years. John Brown might be the best-known participant in the violence of the late 1850s, participating on the abolitionist or Jayhawker side, but numerous groups fought for each side during the &quot;Bleeding Kansas&quot; period.

By the beginning of the American Civil War, Lawrence was already a target for pro-slavery ire, having been seen as the anti-slavery stronghold in the state and, more importantly, a staging area for Unionist and Jayhawker incursions into Missouri. Initially, the town and surrounding area were extremely vigilant and reacted strongly to rumors that enemy forces might be advancing on the town. By the summer of 1863, none of the threats had materialized, so citizen fears had declined, and defense preparations were relaxed.

==Motivations==

===Retaliation for Jayhawker attacks===

Lawrence was a headquarters for a band of Jayhawkers (sometimes called &quot;Red Legs&quot;), who had initiated a campaign in late March 1863 with the purported objective to eliminate civilian support for the Confederate guerrillas. In describing the activities of these soldiers, U.S. Army General Blunt stated,

A reign of terror was inaugurated, and no man&#x27;s property was safe, nor was his life worth much if he opposed them in their schemes of plunder and robbery.

Many Jayhawker leaders like Charles &quot;Doc&quot; Jennison, James Montgomery, and George Henry Hoyt terrorized Western Missouri, angering both pro-slavery and anti-slavery civilians and politicians alike. The historian Albert Castel thus concludes that revenge was the primary motive, followed by a desire to plunder.

The survivors confirmed the retaliatory nature of the attack on Lawrence. According to Castel,

The universal testimony of all the ladies and others who talked with the butchers of the 21st ult. is that these demons claimed they were here to revenge the wrongs done their families by our men under Lane, Jennison, Anthony and Co.

Charles L. Robinson, the first governor of Kansas and an eyewitness to the raid, also characterized the attack as an act of vengeance:

Before this raid the entire border counties of Missouri had experienced more terrible outrages than ever the Quantrill raid at Lawrence... There was no burning of feet and torture by hanging in Lawrence as there was in Missouri, neither were women and children outraged. Robinson explained that Quantrill targeted Lawrence because Jayhawkers had attacked Missouri &quot;as soon as war broke out&quot; and Lawrence was &quot;headquarters for the thieves and their plunder.&quot;

Quantrill said his motivation for the attack was &quot;to plunder, and destroy the town in retaliation for Osceola.&quot; That was a reference to the Union&#x27;s attack on Osceola, Missouri in September 1861, led by Senator James H. Lane. Osceola was plundered, and nine men were given a drumhead court-martial trial and executed.

===Collapse of the Women&#x27;s Prison in Kansas City===

The collapse of the Women&#x27;s Prison in Kansas City is also often believed to have inspired some to join in on the attack. In a bid to put down the Missouri guerrilla raiders operating in Kansas, General Thomas Ewing, Jr. issued in April 1863 &quot;General Order No. 10,&quot; which ordered the arrest of anyone giving aid or comfort to Confederate guerrillas. This meant chiefly women or girls who were relatives of the guerrillas. Ewing confined those arrested in makeshift prisons in Kansas City. The women were sequentially housed in two buildings which were considered either too small or too unsanitary, before being moved to an empty property at 1425 Grand. This structure was part of the estate of the deceased Robert S. Thomas, George Caleb Bingham&#x27;s father-in-law. In 1861 Bingham and his family were living in the structure, but in early 1862 after being appointed treasurer of the state of Missouri, he and his family relocated to Jefferson City. Bingham had added a third story to the existing structure to use as a studio.

At least ten women or girls, all under the age of 20, were incarcerated in the building when it collapsed on August 13, 1863, killing four: Charity McCorkle Kerr, Susan Crawford Vandever, Armenia Crawford Selvey, and Josephine Anderson—the 15-year-old sister of William T. &quot;Bloody Bill&quot; Anderson. A few days later, Nannie Harris died from her wounds. Survivors of the collapse included Jenny Anderson (crippled by the accident), Susan Anne Mundy Womacks, Martha &quot;Mattie&quot; Mundy, Lucinda &quot;Lou&quot; Mundy Gray, Elizabeth Harris (later married to Deal), and Mollie Grindstaff. Anderson&#x27;s 13-year-old sister, who was shackled to a ball-and-chain inside the jail, suffered multiple injuries including two broken legs. Rumors circulated (later promulgated by Bingham who held a personal grudge against Ewing and who would seek financial compensation for the loss of the building) that the guards undermined the structure to cause its collapse. A 1995 study of the events and affidavits surrounding the collapse concludes this is &quot;the least plausible of the theories.&quot; Instead, testimony indicated that alterations to the first floor of the adjoining Cockrell structure for use as a barracks caused the common wall to buckle. The weight of the third story on the former Bingham residence contributed to the resultant collapse.

Even before the collapse of the jail, the arrest and planned deportation of the girls had enraged Quantrill&#x27;s guerrillas; George Todd left a note for General Ewing threatening to burn Kansas City unless the girls were freed. While Quantrill&#x27;s raid on Lawrence was planned before the collapse of the jail, the deaths of the guerrillas&#x27; female relatives undoubtedly added to their thirst for revenge and blood lust during the raid.

==Attack==

The attack was the product of careful planning. Quantrill had gained the confidence of many of the leaders of independent Bushwhacker groups and chose the day and time of the attack well in advance. Different Missouri rider groups approached Lawrence from the east in several independent columns. They converged with well-timed precision in the final miles before Lawrence during the pre-dawn hours of the chosen day. Many of the men had been riding for over 24 hours to make the rendezvous and had lashed themselves to their saddles to keep riding if they fell asleep. Almost all were armed with multiple six-shot revolvers.

Henry Thompson, a black servant from Hesper, attempted to run on foot to Lawrence to warn the town of hundreds of raiders making their way toward Lawrence. Thompson made it as far as Eudora, Kansas before stopping from exhaustion. An unidentified man riding a chaise nearby rode by to ask Thompson if he needed help. Thompson replied that he had run from Hesper and needed to warn Lawrence. While Thompson and the man on the chaise were able to gather some Eudorans to ride into Lawrence to warn the city to the west, none of them made it in time.

Around 450 guerrillas arrived on the outskirts of Lawrence shortly after 5 a.m. A small squad was dispatched to the summit of Mount Oread to serve as lookouts, and the remainder rode into town. One of the first deaths was the pastor and lieutenant of the 2nd Kansas Colored Regiment, Samuel S. Snyder, who was outside milking his cows when he was shot by the passing raiders, who were making their way into town. Snyder&#x27;s death was witnessed by his longtime friend Reverend Hugh Fisher. Their initial focus was the Eldridge House, a large brick hotel in the heart of Lawrence. After gaining control of the building (which then served as Quantrill&#x27;s headquarters during the raid), Quantrill&#x27;s force broke into smaller groups that fanned out throughout the town. Over four hours, the raiders pillaged and burned a quarter of the buildings in Lawrence, including all but two businesses. They looted most of the banks and stores in town and killed over 150 people, all of them men and boys. According to an 1897 account, among the dead, were 18 of 23 unmustered army recruits. By 9 a.m., the raiders were on their way out of town, evading the few units that came in pursuit, and eventually splitting up to avoid Union pursuit of a unified column into Missouri.

Some families attempted to make the run towards Mount Oread in a last-ditch flight for safety.

The raid was less of a battle and more of a mass execution. Two weeks before the attack, a Lawrence newspaper had boasted, &quot;Lawrence has ready for any emergency over five hundred fighting men...every one of who would like to see [Quantrill&#x27;s raiders]&quot;. However, a squad of soldiers temporarily stationed in Lawrence had returned to Fort Leavenworth, and due to the surprise, swiftness, and fury of the initial assault, the local militia was unable to assemble and mount a defense. Most of those Quantrill and his raiders killed were not carrying any weapon. Before the Lawrence Massacre, a previous attack on Lawrence, the Sacking of Lawrence, saw the pro-slavery attackers, led by Samuel J. Jones, a pro-slavery Missourian who served as Sheriff of Douglas County, demanding that the citizens of Lawrence give up their firearms to the raiders. Many citizens initially refused, but by the end of the sacking itself, many in Lawrence were left without a weapon of any sort, which, along with the swiftness of the Lawrence Massacre later on, saw Lawrence left defenseless against the attack.

Because revenge was a principal motive for the attack, Quantrill&#x27;s raiders entered Lawrence with lists of men to be killed and buildings to be burned. Senator James H. Lane was at the top of the list. Lane was a military leader and chief political proponent of the jayhawking raids that had cut a swath of death, plundering, and arson through western Missouri (including the destruction of Osceola) in the early months of the Civil War. Lane escaped death by racing through a cornfield in his nightshirt. John Speer, who Lane had put into the newspaper business, was one of Lane&#x27;s chief political backers and was also on the list. Speer likewise escaped execution, but two of his sons were killed in the raid. (One of Speer&#x27;s sons may have been the same John L. Speer that appeared on a list of Red Legs previously issued by the Union military.) Speer&#x27;s youngest son, 15-year-old Billy, may have been included on the death lists, but Quantrill&#x27;s men released him after he gave them a false name. (Billy Speer later shot one of the raiders during their exit from Lawrence, causing one of the few casualties among Quantrill&#x27;s command while in Lawrence.) Charles L. Robinson, first governor of Kansas and a prominent abolitionist, may also have been on the list, although he was not killed. This according to Richard Cordley, a minister in Lawrence and a survivor of the attack:

Ex-Governor Charles Robinson was an object of special search among them. He was one of the men they particularly wanted. During the whole time they were in town he was in his large stone barn on the hillside. He had just gone to the barn to get his team to drive out into the country, when he saw them come in and saw them make their first charge. He concluded to remain where he was. The barn overlooked the whole town, and he saw the affair from beginning to end. Gangs of raiders came by several times and looked at the barn and went round it, but it looked so much like a fort, that they kept out of range.

Cordley was also on the list of men Quantrill wanted to kill. In some of his writings, Quantrill later lamented that he did not kill Cordley, &quot;The Abolition Preacher.&quot;

While many of the victims had been specifically targeted beforehand, executions were more indiscriminate among segments of the raiders, particularly Todd&#x27;s band that operated in the western part of Lawrence. The men and boys riding with &quot;Bloody Bill&quot; Anderson also accounted for a disproportionate number of the Lawrence dead. The raid devolved into extreme brutality; according to witnesses, the raiders murdered a group of men and their sons who had surrendered under assurances of safety, murdered a father who was in a field with his son, shot a defenseless man who was lying sick in bed, killed an injured man who was being held by his pleading wife, and bound a pair of men and forced them into a burning building where they slowly burned to death. Another dramatic story was told in a letter written on September 7, 1863, by H.M. Simpson, whose entire family narrowly escaped death by hiding in a nearby cornfield as the massacre raged all around them:

My father was very slow to get into the cornfield. He was so indignant at the ruffians that he was unwilling to retreat before them. My little children were in the field three hours. They seemed to know that if they cried the noise would betray their parents whereabouts, and so they kept as still as mice. The baby was very hungry &amp; I gave her an ear of raw green corn which she ate ravenously.

Many have characterized Quantrill&#x27;s decision to kill young boys alongside adult men as a particularly reprehensible aspect of the raid. Bobbie Martin is generally cited as being the youngest victim; some histories of the raid state he could have been as young as ten to twelve years old, while others state he was fourteen. Most accounts state he was wearing a Union soldier uniform or clothing made from his father&#x27;s uniform; some state he was carrying a musket and cartridges. (For perspective on the age of participants in the conflict, it has been estimated that about 800,000 Union soldiers were seventeen years of age or younger, with about 100,000 of those being fifteen or younger.) Most of Quantrill&#x27;s guerrilla fighters were teenagers. One of the youngest was Riley Crawford, who was 13 when taken by his mother to Quantrill after her husband was shot and her home burned by Union soldiers.

==Aftermath==
Once the confederates withdrew to the southeast, Lane led a small group of survivors of the massacre in pursuit of Quantrill&#x27;s men and was joined by a force of about 200 U.S. Army cavalrymen, commanded by Major Preston B. Plumb. They overtook the raiders south of the town of Brooklyn, Kansas and fought the first of several engagements, beginning with the Skirmish near Brooklyn, Kansas.

The Lawrence massacre was one of the bloodiest events in the history of Kansas. The Plymouth Congregational Church in Lawrence survived the attack, but a number of its members were killed and records destroyed. Cordley, the pastor at Plymouth, said to his congregation a few days after the attack, &quot;My friends, Lawrence may seem dead, but she will rise again in a more glorious resurrection. Our ranks have been thinned by death, but let us &#x27;close-up&#x27; and hold the ground [of Kansas]. The conflict may not be ended, but the victory must be ours. We may perish but the principles for which we contend will live.&quot;

A day after the attack, some of the surviving citizens of Lawrence lynched a member of Quantrill&#x27;s Raiders who was caught in the town. On August 25, General Ewing authorized General Order No. 11 (not to be confused with Grant&#x27;s infamous General Order of the same name) evicting thousands of Missourians in four counties from their homes near the Kansas border. Virtually everything in these counties was then systematically burned to the ground. The action was carried out by the infamous Jayhawker, Charles &quot;Doc&quot; Jennison. Jennison&#x27;s raids into Missouri were thorough and indiscriminate. They left four counties in western Missouri wasted, save for the standing brick chimneys of the two-story period houses, which are still called &quot;Jennison Monuments&quot; in those parts.

George Miller, a Missouri abolitionist and preacher, described the role of the Lawrence Massacre in the region&#x27;s descent into the horror of total war on the civilian populations of both eastern Kansas and western Missouri:

Viewed in any light, the Lawrence Raid will continue to be held, as the most infamous event of the uncivil war! The work of destruction did not stop in Kansas. The cowardly criminality of this spiteful reciprocity lay in the fact that each party knew, but did not care, that the consequences of their violent acts would fall most heavily upon their own helpless friends. Jenison in 1861 rushed into Missouri when there was no one to resist, and robbed and killed and sneaked away with his spoils and left the union people of Missouri to bear the vengeance of his crimes. Quantrell in 1863 rushed into Lawrence, Kansas, when there was no danger, and killed and robbed and sneaked off with his spoils, leaving helpless women and children of his own side to bear the dreadful vengeance invoked by that raid. So the Lawrence raid was followed by swift and cruel retribution, falling, as usual in this border warfare, upon the innocent and helpless, rather than the guilty ones. Quantrell left Kansas with the loss of one man. The Kansas troops followed him, at a respectful distance, and visited dire vengeance on all western Missouri. Unarmed old men and boys were accused and shot down, and homes with their now meagre comforts were burned, and helpless women and children turned out with no provision for the approaching winter. The number of those killed was never reported, as they were scattered all over western Missouri.

After the attack, Quantrill led his men south to Texas for the winter. By the next year, the raiders had disintegrated as a unified force and could not achieve similar successes. Quantrill died of wounds he received in Kentucky in 1865, with only a few staunch supporters left. Among those who remained by his side were Frank James and his younger brother, Jesse James.

After Quantrill&#x27;s attack, the U.S. Army erected several military posts on Mount Oread (of which a few were named Camp Ewing, Camp Lookout, and Fort Ulysses) to keep guard over the rebuilt city. No further attacks were made on Lawrence, and these installations were eventually abandoned and dismantled after the war.

*The Lawrence massacre is a central episode in &quot;Wildwood Boys&quot; (William Morrow: New York, 2000), a biographical novel about Bloody Bill Anderson by James Carlos Blake.
*The battle is also depicted in the Steven Spielberg-produced 2005 miniseries &quot;Into the West&quot; and in Ang Lee&#x27;s 1999 film &quot;Ride with the Devil&quot;, as well as the Audie Murphy western &quot;Kansas Raiders&quot; (1950).
*The 1940 film &quot;Dark Command&quot;, based on a novel of the same name, is a fictionalized account of the events in much more of a classic B-movie western style. The film bore no resemblance to the events of history.
*The 1979 TV movie &quot;The Legend of the Golden Gun&quot; was about chasing down Quantrill and had some fiction in about Custer.
*There is a section in Charles Portis&#x27;s 1968 book, &quot;True Grit&quot; in which the characters Marshal Rooster Cogburn and Texas Ranger LaBoeuf argue about Quantrill. LaBoeuf calls him a murderer; Cogburn, who &quot;rode with&quot; Quantrill, calls him a patriot. LaBoeuf ends the argument after Cogburn refers to &quot;Captain Quantrill,&quot; ridiculing the title: &quot;Captain of what?&quot; This conversation later appeared in the 1969 and 2010 films.
*In Telltale&#x27;s 2012 video game &quot;The Walking Dead&quot;, Quantrill&#x27;s raid is mentioned as two characters, Lee and Omid, bond over Civil War history.
*In &quot;Weekend Warriors&quot; the 6th episode of season 1 of &quot;Psych&quot;, originally aired August 11, 2006, a reenactment of the battle in Lawrence, KS, where Quantrill is killed is the scene for the murder that is the focus of the episode.
*The 1968 movie &quot;Bandolero!&quot; references the event.

<text>Johnathan Richard Buck (born July 7, 1980) is an American former professional baseball catcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Kansas City Royals, Toronto Blue Jays, Florida/Miami Marlins, New York Mets, Pittsburgh Pirates, Seattle Mariners and Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. He went to high school in Taylorsville, Utah.

==Career==

===Houston Astros===
Buck was initially drafted by the Houston Astros in the 7th round of the 1998 Amateur Draft. He was signed to a minor league contract on June 11, 1998.

By 2002, Buck was highly regarded for his defensive ability, becoming one of the game&#x27;s top minor league catchers and 68th top prospect in all of baseball. In 2003, Buck moved farther up prospect lists. He was listed as the 21st-best prospect in baseball by John Sickels.

===Kansas City Royals===
On June 24, 2004, the Astros traded him to the Kansas City Royals as part of a three-way deal to acquire Carlos Beltrán, sending Buck and cash to Kansas City and Octavio Dotel to the Oakland Athletics. Mark Teahen and Mike Wood went from the Athletics to the Royals as well. The Royals immediately put Buck in their starting lineup, replacing injured veteran Benito Santiago. Buck made his major league debut on June 25. Although he initially appeared overmatched by major-league pitching—his batting average reached a low of .138 on July 7—he impressed the team with his defensive ability and his handling of pitchers. His hitting improved with time, and by September 25 he had raised his average to .243 with 12 home runs, and 30 RBIs.

In 2006, Buck fought with teammate Runelvys Hernández in the Royals dugout during a game against the Indians.

===Toronto Blue Jays===

On December 16, 2009, Buck signed a one-year contract with the Toronto Blue Jays worth $2 million. On April 29, 2010. Buck hit 3 home runs in a single game against the Oakland Athletics. Buck was elected to the 2010 American League All-Star team on July 4, along with fellow Blue Jays Vernon Wells and José Bautista. In his first All-Star Game, he went 1–2 with a double. Buck finished his only season in Toronto with career-highs in batting average (.281), hits (115), home runs (20), RBI (66), doubles (25), slugging percentage (.489), and on-base plus slugging (.802).

===Florida/Miami Marlins===
Buck agreed to a three-year contract with the Florida Marlins worth $18 million on November 15, 2010. The deal was confirmed on November 17, 2010. In his first game with the Marlins, he hit a grand slam off New York Mets pitcher Mike Pelfrey.

In 2011, he had the lowest percentage of runners caught stealing of all major league catchers, at 17%.

In 2012, Buck hit .192/.297/.347 with 12 home runs and 41 RBI in 106 games while throwing out 27% of runners.

===New York Mets===
On November 19, 2012, Buck was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays along with Josh Johnson, José Reyes, Mark Buehrle, and Emilio Bonifacio, in exchange for Jeff Mathis, Adeiny Hechavarria, Henderson Álvarez, Yunel Escobar, Jake Marisnick, Anthony DeSclafani, and Justin Nicolino. On December 17, 2012, the Blue Jays traded him, Noah Syndergaard, Travis d&#x27;Arnaud, and Wuilmer Becerra to the New York Mets for R. A. Dickey, Josh Thole, and Mike Nickeas.

Buck began 2013 as the starting catcher, with Anthony Recker as his backup. After a great April in which he hit .241/.269/.575 with 9 home runs and 25 RBI, Buck cooled down some. On August 17, Buck was placed on paternity leave, and he was replaced on the roster by the catcher he was traded with, Travis d&#x27;Arnaud. d&#x27;Arnaud took the starting role when Buck returned, and Buck would soon be traded.

===Pittsburgh Pirates===
On August 27, 2013, Buck and Marlon Byrd were traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates in exchange for infield prospect Dilson Herrera and a player to be named later, identified on August 29 as Vic Black. He finished the season as the backup to Russell Martin. In 110 games total (9 with Pittsburgh), he hit .219/.285/.362 with 15 home runs and 62 RBI.

===Seattle Mariners===
On January 14, 2014, Buck agreed to a 1-year, $1 million deal with the Seattle Mariners. He was projected to split time at catcher with Humberto Quintero and Mike Zunino. On July 7, Buck&#x27;s 34th birthday, the Mariners designated him for assignment. After clearing waivers unclaimed, Buck became a free agent.

===Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim===
Buck was signed to a minor league contract by the Los Angeles Angels on July 21, 2014. He was assigned to the Triple-A Salt Lake Bees. The Angels designated Buck for assignment on October 7, 2014, after claiming Alfredo Marte and Roger Kieschnick on waivers. He rejected an assignment to Triple-A, becoming a free agent.

===Retirement===
In January 2015, Buck agreed to a minor league contract with the Atlanta Braves. The contract included an invitation to major-league spring training. Buck was expected to start the 2015 season at Triple-A. However, on March 26, he announced that he was retiring from baseball.

==Personal life==
Buck&#x27;s wife Brooke gave birth to twins twelve weeks prematurely in May 2008. The twins&#x27; names are Cooper and Brody. In August 2013, his wife gave birth to their third son, Bentley.

In December 2011, Buck assisted in rescuing two elderly women from an overturned car in Sunrise, Florida.

<doc id="1035611" wikidata="Q3854317" url="?curid=1035611" title="Battle of Marais des Cygnes">
<text>The Battle of Marais des Cygnes () took place on October 25, 1864, in Linn County, Kansas, during Price&#x27;s Missouri Campaign during the American Civil War. It is also known as the Battle of Trading Post. In late 1864, Confederate Major-General Sterling Price invaded the state of Missouri with a cavalry force, attempting to draw Union troops away from the primary theaters of fighting further east. After several victories early in the campaign, Price&#x27;s Confederate troops were defeated at the Battle of Westport on October 23 near Kansas City, Missouri. The Confederates then withdrew into Kansas, camping along the banks of the Marais des Cygnes River on the night of October 24. Union cavalry pursuers under Brigadier General John B. Sanborn skirmished with Price&#x27;s rearguard that night, but disengaged without participating in heavy combat.

Overnight, Sanborn&#x27;s troops were reinforced by cavalry under Lieutenant Colonel Frederick W. Benteen, bringing the total Union strength to 3,500. The battle began early the next morning as Sanborn drove Major General John S. Marmaduke&#x27;s Confederate rearguard from its position north of the river. Union troops captured cannons, prisoners, and wagons during this stage of the fighting. Marmaduke attempted to make a stand at the river crossing, but his position was outflanked by a Union cavalry regiment, forcing him to abandon it. A rearguard action by Confederate Brigadier General John B. Clark Jr.&#x27;s 1,200-man brigade bought Price more time to retreat and disengage. Some of Price&#x27;s men were still caught near Mine Creek later that morning and were badly beaten in the Battle of Mine Creek. That evening, the Battle of Marmiton River became the day&#x27;s third action, after which Price burned his supply train so it no longer slowed the retreat. After another defeat at the Second Battle of Newtonia on October 28, Price&#x27;s column retreated to Texas through Arkansas and the Indian Territory. Only 3,500 of the 12,000 men Price had brought into Missouri remained in his force.

==Background==

When the American Civil War began in 1861, the state of Missouri was a slave state, but did not secede because the state was politically divided. Governor Claiborne Fox Jackson and the Missouri State Guard (MSG) supported secession and the Confederate States of America, while Brigadier General Nathaniel Lyon and the portion of the Union Army under his command supported the United States and opposed secession. Under Major General Sterling Price, the MSG defeated Union armies at the battles of Wilson&#x27;s Creek and Lexington in 1861, but by the end of the year, Price and the MSG were restricted to the southwestern portion of the state due to the arrival of Union reinforcements. Meanwhile, Jackson and a portion of the state legislature voted to secede and join the Confederate States of America, while another element voted to reject secession, essentially giving the state two governments. In March 1862, a Confederate defeat at the Battle of Pea Ridge in Arkansas gave the Union control of Missouri. For the rest of the year, and through 1863, Confederate activity in the state was largely restricted to guerrilla warfare and raids.

By the beginning of September 1864, events in the eastern United States, especially the Confederate defeat in the Atlanta campaign, gave incumbent president Abraham Lincoln, who supported continuing the war, an edge in the 1864 United States presidential election over George B. McClellan, who promoted ending the war. At this point, the Confederacy had very little chance of winning the war. Meanwhile, in the Trans-Mississippi Theater, the Confederates had defeated Union attackers in the Red River campaign in Louisiana in March through May. As events east of the Mississippi River turned against the Confederates, General Edmund Kirby Smith, commander of the Confederate Trans-Mississippi Department, was ordered to transfer the infantry under his command to the fighting in the Eastern and Western Theaters. This proved to be impossible, as the Union Navy controlled the Mississippi River, preventing a large-scale crossing.

Despite having limited resources for an offensive, Smith decided that an attack designed to divert Union troops from the principal theaters of combat would have the same effect as the proposed transfer of troops. Price and the new Confederate Governor of Missouri Thomas Caute Reynolds suggested that an invasion of Missouri would be an effective offensive; Smith approved the plan and appointed Price to command the campaign. Many of the Union troops previously defending Missouri had been transferred out of the state, leaving the Missouri State Militia as the state&#x27;s primary defensive force. Price expected that the offensive would create a popular uprising against Union control of Missouri, divert Union troops away from principal theaters of combat, and aid McClellan&#x27;s chance of defeating Lincoln. Price&#x27;s column entered the state on September 19. This force was formally known as the Army of Missouri and contained three divisions, which were commanded by Major Generals James F. Fagan and John S. Marmaduke and Brigadier General Joseph O. Shelby. The Confederates had 13,000 cavalrymen and 14 small-bore cannons.

==Prelude==

By September 24, Price&#x27;s column had reached Fredericktown, where he learned that the town of Pilot Knob and the St. Louis &amp; Iron Mountain Railroad were held by Union forces under the command of Brigadier General Thomas Ewing Jr. Price had no interest in allowing an enemy force to operate in the rear of his army while he advanced to St. Louis, so he sent Marmaduke and Fagan&#x27;s divisions to Pilot Knob; Shelby and his men operated north of the town. On September 26, Ewing&#x27;s command fought off Fagan&#x27;s division at Arcadia before withdrawing to the defenses of Fort Davidson. The next day, Price moved against the fort and offered Ewing surrender terms; the latter refused, as he was afraid of being executed for his unpopular issuance of General Order No. 11 the previous year. Holding out, the Union defenders repulsed multiple assaults, before slipping out of the fort at 03:00 on September 28. The Confederates suffered at least 800 casualties during the engagement and their morale decreased, leading Price to abandon the attempt against St. Louis.

After abandoning the St. Louis thrust, Price&#x27;s army headed for Jefferson City, although the Confederates were slowed by bringing along a large supply train. On October 7, the Confederates approached Jefferson City, which was held by about 7,000 men mostly inexperienced militia commanded by Brigadier General Egbert Brown. Faulty Confederate intelligence placed the Union strength at 15,000, and Price, fearing another defeat like Pilot Knob, decided not to attack the city, and began moving his army toward Boonville the next day. Boonville was in the pro-Confederate region of Little Dixie, and Price was able to recruit new soldiers. Estimates of the number of new recruits vary between writers: the historian Charles D. Collins states 1,200 men; Christopher Phillips, writing for the Kansas City Public Library, provides 2,000 men; and the historian Kyle Sinisi states that a minimum of 2,500 men joined the Confederates in the region. Price, needing weapons, authorized two raids away from his main body of troops: Brigadier General John B. Clark Jr. and 1,800 men were sent to Glasgow, and Brigadier General M. Jeff Thompson led Shelby&#x27;s Iron Brigade to Sedalia. Both raids were successful. Price&#x27;s army next fought a series of engagements as it moved westwards towards Kansas City, Missouri, culminating in the Battle of Westport on October 23. At Westport, the Confederates were soundly defeated by the commands of Major Generals James G. Blunt and Alfred Pleasonton. Shelby&#x27;s men provided the Confederates with a rearguard, and the Army of Missouri retreated southwards.

The Confederates still had a large supply train with them, slowing the retreat. By the evening of October 24, the Army of Missouri had entered Kansas; Confederate soldiers looted and burned as they went. That night, Price camped near Trading Post in Linn County, with the camp split into two segments by the Marais des Cygnes River. Price believed that the Union pursuers would attempt to swing around his flank and block his path of retreat and was not expecting a significant Union force to attack the Trading Post position. Meanwhile, the Union pursuers were at West Point, Missouri. Blunt suggested an ambitious flanking movement, but was overruled by Major General Samuel R. Curtis, commander of the Department of Kansas. The plan would have involved only using a token force to attack the Confederate position at the Marais des Cygnes and slipping most of the rest of the Union army around the Confederate flank to attack Price&#x27;s army in the morning. Both the flanking movement and crossing a river at night posed risks, and Blunt&#x27;s plan did not consider the fact that the terrain south of the Marais des Cygnes was not conducive to rapid movement. It also assumed that the Confederates would remain stationary. Instead, Curtis ordered Pleasonton to make a frontal attack against Price. Pleasonton, who was heavily fatigued, gave temporary control of his division to Brigadier General John B. Sanborn.

Sanborn moved against Price with a cavalry force at Trading Post late on the night of the 24th. His line, which consisted of the 4th Iowa Cavalry Regiment and three companies of the 2nd Colorado Cavalry Regiment on the right and the 6th and 8th Missouri State Militia Cavalry Regiments on the left, made contact with Fagan&#x27;s Confederates, who were now serving as the Confederate rearguard. A brief friendly fire incident involving the 4th Iowa Cavalry and the 2nd Colorado Cavalry ensued due to the Iowans being unaware of the presence of the Colorado unit in their front, as well as some light skirmishing with Fagan&#x27;s forces. Sanborn was unsure of the Confederates&#x27; strength, but thought it might be as many as 10,000 men. With his men fatigued and operating in a thunderstorm, he withdrew most of his line, except for the 6th Missouri State Militia Cavalry, which continued skirmishing throughout the night. Fagan informed Price of the action, and the Confederates began retreating about midnight.

==Battle==
At around 01:00 the next morning, Curtis was informed that Sanborn had disengaged. Wishing to continue to press Price, he ordered Sanborn to attack at daybreak. Curtis had some of his staff officers assist Sanborn, who had been at least partially stymied by lack of staff assistance. An artillery battery was deployed at this time. Around 02:00, Fagan and Shelby withdrew their troops, and Marmaduke aligned his division to serve as a rearguard; it was over 2,000-strong. Marmaduke withdrew his main force south of the river, but left a skirmish line on a pair of mounds that were tall. During the night, part of the 2nd Colorado Cavalry broke through the Confederate skirmish line before withdrawing again. A Missouri State Militia unit and the 4th Iowa Cavalry also advanced under cover of darkness. During the night, Sanborn was reinforced by elements of Lieutenant Colonel Frederick W. Benteen&#x27;s cavalry brigade. One of Benteen&#x27;s regiments was detached to guard a river crossing to the north to prevent a Confederate flanking attack. At 04:00, Sanborn&#x27;s artillery, six 3-inch ordnance rifles, opened fire on the Confederate line.

At daybreak, the 4th Iowa Cavalry on the Union right attacked, using the broken ground as cover. Union artillery fired on the mounds, but despite aiming at a 15° elevation, overshot the elevated Confederate positions. Some of the misses struck the Confederate camp, accelerating its evacuation. Confederate marksmanship at that portion of the line was very poor, and the Iowans easily took the position, which consisted of one of the mounds. The 6th and 8th Missouri State Militia Cavalry Regiments attacked on the other end of the line. Again, the fire from the Confederate defenders was ineffective. Both sides were hampered by the rough terrain. The Confederate commander facing the two militia cavalry regiments feared being isolated from Marmaduke&#x27;s main body on the other side of the river, so the mound was abandoned. The retreat was not detected until after the position had been completely abandoned. The historian Kyle Sinisi wrote that casualties during this stage of the fighting &quot;appear to have been almost nonexistent&quot;. With Confederate resistance north of the river broken, Sanborn deployed the 3rd Iowa Cavalry Regiment and the 10th Missouri Cavalry Regiment, as well as the 2nd Arkansas Cavalry Regiment, to exploit the breakthrough.

The 2nd Arkansas Cavalry spearheaded the pursuit. Union forces captured 100 Confederate soldiers, as well as two cannons and some wagons, north of the river, including around the Trading Post settlement. Large quantities of equipment, personal effects, and partially cooked food were found left in the camp, including the partially butchered carcasses of livestock. Marmaduke had positioned men and three cannons from Hynson&#x27;s Texas Battery just south of the river crossing, and these Union troops were temporarily halted, as there were not enough Union soldiers on the field to challenge the Confederate line directly. The river crossing was obstructed with two downed trees and some men from Colonel Thomas R. Freeman&#x27;s command. Sanborn ordered the 7th Provisional Enrolled Missouri Militia to cross the river upstream from the Confederate position, successfully outflanking the Confederate line and opening a path across the river. As the 7th Provisional Enrolled Missouri Militia cleared the approach from the flank, the 2nd Arkansas also drove across the river. A tributary of the Marais des Cygnes, named Big Sugar Creek, presented another challenge to the crossing. An alternate crossing of the Marais des Cygnes bypassed this roadblock, but Sanborn was not aware of its existence.

Serving as a rearguard, Clark aligned his brigade in the path of the Union advance. This line was spotted by Sanborn&#x27;s men after they forced their way through some forest growth around the river. Sanborn drew up a line with two Provisional Enrolled Missouri Militia units thrown out as skirmishers, and the 2nd Arkansas Cavalry, 2nd Colorado Cavalry, and two additional militia units forming his main line. Confused as to what to do, Sanborn left to personally find Curtis for orders and left Colonel John E. Phelps, commander of the 2nd Arkansas Cavalry, in charge in his absence. Phelps&#x27;s orders were not to attack unless reinforced, but he assaulted Clark&#x27;s line with 200 men from his own unit and the two Missouri State Militia commands anyway. The attack was initially successful, but halted and was repulsed. Curtis and Pleasonton had joined Sanborn by this point, and observed the 2nd Arkansas&#x27; repulse. They attempted to bring more troops to Phelps&#x27; support, but Price&#x27;s wagons had cut up the roads during their retreat, making maneuvers difficult.

By 09:00, Pleasonton, who had regained command of his division from Sanborn, formed a line with the cavalry brigades commanded by Sanborn, Benteen, and Colonel John F. Philips. A small unit of Union artillery also joined the line. Sanborn&#x27;s command outflanked the right of Clark&#x27;s line and forced the Confederates to withdraw; another Confederate cannon was captured when Hynson&#x27;s battery abandoned it during the retreat. Clark&#x27;s brigade formed a new line containing around 1,200 men, but the weight of the 3,500 Union troopers now present was too much for the Confederates. After Philips&#x27;s troops threatened his left, Clark ordered a retreat from the field around 10:00. Colonel Colton Greene and his 3rd Missouri Cavalry Regiment provided a rearguard for the Confederates.

==Aftermath==

Later that morning, Philips and Benteen&#x27;s troops encountered some of Price&#x27;s men at the crossing of Mine Creek. The Union troops quickly attacked, and the ensuing Battle of Mine Creek became one of the largest battles between mounted cavalry during the war. The Confederates suffered a serious defeat, as several cannons and about 600 men, including Marmaduke, were captured. Shelby&#x27;s division served as a rearguard, fighting the Battle of Marmiton River that evening. By the end of October 25, Price&#x27;s army was so shattered and demoralized that the historian Albert E. Castel described it as essentially an armed mob. That night, Price burned most of his wagon train near Deerfield, Missouri so that it was no longer an encumbrance. By October 28, the Confederates had reached Newtonia, Missouri, where they were defeated by the commands of Blunt and Sanborn in the Second Battle of Newtonia. Price&#x27;s army began to disintegrate, and the Confederates retreated first into Arkansas and then into the Indian Territory and Texas. Price&#x27;s Raid, the last major offensive in the Trans-Mississippi Theater, was a failure. By December, Price only had 3,500 men left in an army that had begun the campaign with 12,000.

==Legacy==

Over of the battlefield are preserved by government agencies: by the Kansas Department of Fish and Wildlife, and by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service; the land under the control of the latter agency is within Marais des Cygnes National Wildlife Refuge. , 92 percent of the battlefield retains historical integrity; of this, only 19 percent is included in the wildlife refuge. Since the land is preserved as a wildlife site instead of a historic site, the only public interpretation of the battle is some signage and trails present at a rest stop maintained by the Kansas Department of Transportation. U.S. Route 69 and Kansas State Highway 52 run through the northern portion of the battlefield, although the landscape is generally free from major development. , the site of the battle is not listed on the National Register of Historic Places, although a 2010 survey performed by the American Battlefield Protection Program determined that it is likely eligible for listing.

<text>Chris Wingert (born June 16, 1982) is an American professional soccer player for New York Cosmos B in the National Premier Soccer League. He spent fourteen seasons of his professional career in Major League Soccer (MLS) with the Columbus Crew (2004–2005), Colorado Rapids (2006–2007), Real Salt Lake (2007–2014, 2016–2017) and New York City FC (2015–2016). He was a starting defender with Real Salt Lake&#x27;s MLS Cup Championship team in 2009.

==Career==

===College===
Wingert attended St. John the Baptist Diocesan High School and played college soccer for St. John&#x27;s University, where he was the 2003 Hermann Trophy winner as that year&#x27;s best collegiate player.

During his college years Wingert also played with the Brooklyn Knights in the USL Premier Development League.

===Professional===

The Columbus Crew drafted Wingert in the second round (twelfth overall) in the 2004 MLS SuperDraft. Despite his collegiate success, MLS teams were skeptical about his ability to adapt to the faster and more physical professional game. Nevertheless, Wingert managed to earn a spot on a very good Crew team and was a versatile member of the squad for two years. While in Columbus, he played as both a defender and a defensive midfielder. On January 20, 2006, the Crew traded Wingert to Colorado Rapids for a fourth-round pick in the 2007 MLS SuperDraft.

On July 13, 2007, Real Salt Lake acquired Wingert from Colorado for a first-round pick in the 2008 MLS Supplemental Draft and a second-round pick in the 2009 supplemental draft.

After eight years with Salt Lake, Wingert was selected in the tenth round of the 2014 MLS Expansion Draft by expansion club New York City FC. The club also selected fellow Salt Lake teammate Ned Grabavoy.

Wingert was waived by New York City on January 30, 2016. Three days later, on February 2, he was claimed off of waivers by Real Salt Lake, starting his second stint with the club. He announced his retirement as a professional soccer player on February 19, 2018.

===International===
Wingert made his first international appearance for the United States against Sweden on January 24, 2009.

===Personal===
Wingert is the son of Norm Wingert who played for the Philadelphia Atoms in the North American Soccer League.

==Honors==

<text>The Little Red School House and Elisabeth Irwin High School, also referred to as LREI, is a school in Manhattan, New York City. It was founded by Elisabeth Irwin in 1921 as the Little Red School House and is one of the city&#x27;s first progressive schools. Created as a joint public-private educational experiment, the school tested principles of progressive education that had been advocated since the turn of the 20th century by John Dewey. The founders postulated that the lessons of progressive education could be applied successfully in the crowded, ethnically diverse public schools of the nation&#x27;s largest city.

==History==
The school was founded in 1921 as a joint private-public educational experiment by reformer Elisabeth Irwin, and was well known as a testing ground for new concepts in education.

In 1932, after the onset of the Great Depression caused the Public Education Association to withdraw the funding that had allowed the school to exist within the New York City public school system, William O&#x27;Shea, the superintendent of schools – who had previously tried to close down the program because of its progressive ideas – announced that the school would be eliminated because of a budgetary crisis. Parents raised sufficient funds to pay for salaries, but O&#x27;Shea refused to accept the money, and the school was forced to turn to private funding. It moved to a building on Bleecker Street provided at no cost by the First Presbyterian Church and began a new life as an independent school.

The Little Red School House consists of a lower school, a middle school, and a high school. In the 1940s the Little Red School House&#x27;s high-school students decided they wanted their school to be named after its founder, Elisabeth Irwin, making the full title of the institution The Little Red School House and Elisabeth Irwin High School.

==Buildings==
The Little Red School House and Elisabeth Irwin High School occupy two separate buildings, with a third space housing athletic facilities.

The middle-and-lower-school building is located at 272 Avenue of the Americas (Sixth Avenue) at Bleecker Street, while Elisabeth Irwin High School is at 40 Charlton Street between Sixth Avenue and Varick Street. In June 2008, LREI announced the acquisition of additional space with the purchase of 42 Charlton Street, directly next door. The new townhouse was to be renovated and connected to the existing building. A separate building, the Thompson Street Gym, houses facilities for physical education and athletics. In November 2018, the school announced that it had purchased 15 Van Dam Street, directly behind the Charlton Street campus. The building contains the Soho Playhouse, and formerly housed the Huron Club, a social club frequented by members of the Democratic Party.

==College placement==
In 2017, graduates attended New York University, Boston University, California Institute of the Arts, Duke University, Princeton University, and many more. In 2015, graduates from Elisabeth Irwin High School attended Bennington College, Bard College, Skidmore College, Ithaca College, Northwestern University, Pitzer College, Sarah Lawrence College the University of Delaware and Vassar College, along with 38 other colleges and universities. In 2013, graduates attended Bard College, Kenyon College, Bennington College, Brown University, Cornell University, Sarah Lawrence College and the University of Colorado at Boulder, along with 22 other institutions, and in 2012, Bennington College, Hampshire College, Kenyon College, Skidmore College, and Wesleyan University, as well as 28 other schools.

==Extracurricular activities==

===Sports===
LREI&#x27;s sports teams include soccer (boys, girls and MS co-ed), volleyball (HS girls, MS co-ed), cross-country track (co-ed), basketball (Varsity, boys and girls and JV boys), spring track (co-ed), tennis (co-ed), softball (girls), baseball (boys), swimming (co-ed) and fencing (co-ed).

<text>The Garibaldi Volcanic Belt is a northwest–southeast trending volcanic chain in the Pacific Ranges of the Coast Mountains that extends from Watts Point in the south to the Ha-Iltzuk Icefield in the north. This chain of volcanoes is located in southwestern British Columbia, Canada. It forms the northernmost segment of the Cascade Volcanic Arc, which includes Mount St. Helens and Mount Baker. Most volcanoes of the Garibaldi chain are dormant stratovolcanoes and subglacial volcanoes that have been eroded by glacial ice. Less common volcanic landforms include cinder cones, volcanic plugs, lava domes and calderas. These diverse formations were created by different styles of volcanic activity, including Peléan and Plinian eruptions.

Eruptions along the length of the chain have created at least three major volcanic zones. The first began in the Powder Mountain Icefield 4.0 million years ago. Mount Cayley began its formation during this period. Multiple eruptions from 2.2 million to 2,350 years ago created the Mount Meager massif, and eruptions 1.3 million to 9,300 years ago formed Mount Garibaldi and other volcanoes in the Garibaldi Lake area. These major volcanic zones lie in three echelon segments, referred to as the northern, central, and southern segments. Each segment contains one of the three major volcanic zones. Apart from these large volcanic zones, two large poorly studied volcanic complexes lie at the northern end of the Pacific Ranges, namely Silverthrone Caldera and Franklin Glacier Complex. They are considered to be part of the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt, but their tectonic relationships to other volcanoes in the Garibaldi chain are unclear because of minimal studies.

==Geology==

===Background===
Prior to Garibaldi Belt formation, a number of older, but related volcanic belts were constructed along the Southern Coast of British Columbia. This includes the east–west trending Alert Bay Volcanic Belt on northern Vancouver Island and the Pemberton Volcanic Belt along the coastal mainland. The Pemberton Belt began its formation when the former Farallon Plate was subducting under the British Columbia Coast 29 million years ago during the Oligocene epoch. At this time, the north-central portion of the Farallon Plate was just starting to subduct under the U.S. state of California, splitting it into northern and southern sections. Between 18 and five million years ago during the Miocene period, the northern remnant of the Farallon Plate fractured into two tectonic plates, known as the Gorda and Juan de Fuca plates. After this breakup, subduction of the Juan de Fuca Plate might have been coincident with the northern end of Vancouver Island eight million years ago during the late Miocene period. This is when the Alert Bay Belt became active. A brief interval of plate motion adjustment about 3.5 million years ago may have triggered the generation of basaltic magma along the descending plate edge. This eruptive period postdates the formation of the Garibaldi Belt and evidence for more recent volcanism in the Alert Bay Belt has not been found, indicating that volcanism in the Alert Bay Belt is likely extinct.

Bedrock under the Garibaldi chain consists of granitic and dioritic rocks of the Coast Plutonic Complex, which makes up much of the Coast Mountains. This is a large batholith complex that was formed when the Farallon and Kula plates were subducting along the western margin of the North American Plate during the Jurassic and Tertiary periods. It lies on island arc remnants, oceanic plateaus and clustered continental margins that were added along the western margin of North America between the Triassic and Cretaceous periods.

===Formation===
The Garibaldi Belt has formed in response to ongoing subduction of the Juan de Fuca Plate under the North American Plate at the Cascadia subduction zone along the British Columbia Coast. This is a long fault zone running off the Pacific Northwest from Northern California to southwestern British Columbia. The plates move at a relative rate of over per year at a somewhat oblique angle to the subduction zone. Because of the very large fault area, the Cascadia subduction zone can produce large earthquakes of magnitude 7.0 or greater. The interface between the Juan de Fuca and North American plates remains locked for periods of roughly 500 years. During these periods, stress builds up on the interface between the plates and causes uplift of the North American margin. When the plate finally slips, the 500 years of stored energy are released in a mega-earthquake.

Unlike most subduction zones worldwide, there is no deep oceanic trench present in the bathymetry of the continental margin in Cascadia. This is because the mouth of the Columbia River empties directly into the subduction zone and deposits silt at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean to bury the oceanic trench. Massive floods from prehistoric Glacial Lake Missoula during the Late Pleistocene also deposited massive amounts of sediment into the trench. However, in common with other subduction zones, the outer margin is slowly being compressed, similar to a giant spring. When the stored energy is suddenly released by slippage across the fault at irregular intervals, the Cascadia subduction zone can create very large earthquakes, such as the magnitude 9.0 Cascadia earthquake on January 26, 1700. However, earthquakes along the Cascadia subduction zone are fewer than expected and there is evidence of a decline in volcanic activity over the past few million years. The probable explanation lies in the rate of convergence between the Juan de Fuca and North American plates. These two tectonic plates currently converge to per year. This is only about half the rate of convergence of seven million years ago.

Scientists have estimated that there have been at least 13 significant earthquakes along the Cascadia subduction zone in the past 6,000 years. The most recent, the 1700 Cascadia earthquake, was recorded in the oral traditions of the First Nations people on Vancouver Island. It caused considerable tremors and a massive tsunami that traveled across the Pacific Ocean. The significant shaking associated with this earthquake demolished houses of the Cowichan Tribes on Vancouver Island and caused several landslides. Shaking due to this earthquake made it too difficult for the Cowichan people to stand, and the tremors were so lengthy that they were sickened. The tsunami created by the earthquake ultimately devastated a winter village at Pachena Bay, killing all the people that lived there. The 1700 Cascadia earthquake caused near-shore subsidence, submerging marshes and forests on the coast that were later buried under more recent debris.

Many thousand years of dormancy are expected between large explosive eruptions of volcanoes in the Garibaldi Belt. A possible explanation for the lower rates of volcanism in the Garibaldi chain is that the associated terrain is being compressed in contrast to the more southern portions of the Cascade Arc. In continental rift zones, magma is able to push its way up through the Earth&#x27;s crust rapidly along faults, providing less chance for differentiation. This is likely the case south of Mount Hood to the California border and east-southeast of the massive Newberry shield volcano adjacent to the Cascade Range in central Oregon because the Brothers Fault Zone lies in this region. This rift zone might explain the massive amounts of basaltic lava in this part of the central Cascade Arc. A low convergence rate in a compressional setting with massive stationary bodies of magma under the surface could explain the low volume and differentiated magmas throughout the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt. In 1958, Canadian volcanologist Bill Mathews proposed there could be a connection between regional glaciation of the North American continent during glacial periods and higher rates of volcanic activity during regional glacial unload of the continent. However, this is hard to predict due to the infrequent geological record in this region. But there is specific data, including the temporal grouping of eruptions synglacially or just postglacial within the Garibaldi Belt, that suggests this could be probable.

===Glaciovolcanism===

Dominating the Garibaldi chain are volcanoes and other volcanic formations that formed during periods of intense glaciation. This includes flow-dominated tuyas, subglacial lava domes and ice-marginal lava flows. Flow-dominated tuyas differ from the typical basaltic tuyas throughout British Columbia in that they are composed of piles of flat-lying lava flows and lack hyaloclastite and pillow lava. They are interpreted to have formed as a result of magma intruding into and melting a vertical hole through adjacent glacial ice that eventually breached the surface of the glacier. As this magma ascends, it ponds and spreads into horizontal layers. Lava domes that were formed mainly during subglacial activity comprise steep flanks made of intense columnar joints and volcanic glass. Ice-marginal lava flows form when lava erupts from a subaerial vent and ponds against glacial ice. The Barrier, a lava dam impounding Garibaldi Lake in the southern segment, is the best represented ice-marginal lava flow in the Garibaldi Belt.

Flow-dominated tuyas and the absence of subglacial fragmental deposits are two uncommon glaciovolcanic features in the Garibaldi chain. This is due to their different lava compositions and decline of direct lava-water contact during volcanic activity. The lava composition of these volcanic edifies changes their structure because eruption temperatures are lower than those associated with basaltic activity and lava containing silica increases thickness and glass differentiation temperatures. As a result, subglacial volcanoes that erupt silicic content melt less qualities of ice and are not as likely to contain water close to the volcanic vent. This forms volcanoes with structures that display their relationship with the regional glaciation. The surrounding landscape also changes the flow of meltwater, favouring lava to pond within valleys dominated by glacial ice. And if the edifice is eroded, it could change the prominence of fragmental glaciovolcanic deposits as well.

===Southern segment===

On the eastern side of Howe Sound lies the southernmost zone of volcanic activity in the Garibaldi chain. This zone, known as the Watts Point volcanic centre, is a small outcrop of volcanic rock that is a portion of a subglacial volcano. The outcrop covers an area of about and an eruptive volume of roughly . The location is heavily forested and the BC Rail mainline passes through the lower portion of the outcrop about above sea level. It represents a feature in the Squamish volcanic field.

Mount Garibaldi, one of the larger volcanoes in the southern Garibaldi Belt with a volume of , is composed of dacite lavas that were erupted in the past 300,000 years. It was constructed when volcanic material erupted onto a portion of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet during the Pleistocene period. This created the unique asymmetrical shape of the mountain. Successive landslides on Garibaldi&#x27;s flanks occurred after glacial ice of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet retreated. Subsequent volcanism about 9,300 years ago produced a long dacite lava flow from Opal Cone on Garibaldi&#x27;s southeastern flank. This is unusually long for a dacite flow, which commonly travel only short distances from a volcanic vent due to their high viscosity. The Opal Cone lava flow represents one of the most recent volcanic features at Mount Garibaldi.

On the western shore of Garibaldi Lake, Mount Price represents a stratovolcano with an elevation of . It was constructed during three periods of activity. The first phase 1.2 million years ago formed a hornblende andesite stratovolcano on the drift-covered floor of a circular basin. After this stratovolcano was constructed, volcanism moved to the west where a series of andesite-dacite lava flows and pyroclastic flows were extruded during a period of Peléan activity 300,000 years ago. This created the high cone of Mount Price, which was later buried under glacial ice. Before Mount Price was overridden by glacial ice, volcanic activity took place on its northern flank where a satellite vent is present. Renewed activity took place at Clinker Peak on the western flank of Mount Price around 13,000 years ago. This produced the Rubble Creek and Clinker Ridge andesite lava flows that extend to the northwest and southwest. After these flows traveled , they were dammed against glacial ice to form an ice-marginal lava flow more than thick known as The Barrier.
Cinder Cone on the north shore of Garibaldi Lake is a cinder cone partly engulfed by the Helmet Glacier. It consists of volcanic ash, lapilli and dispersed ropy and lava bomb segments that bring the cone&#x27;s prominence to . Its minimal degree of erosion indicates that it might have erupted in the past 1,000 years. A series of basaltic andesite flows were erupted from Cinder Cone about 11,000 years ago that traveled into a deep north trending U-shaped valley on the eastern flank of The Black Tusk. Subsequent volcanism produced another sequence of basaltic lava flows 4,000 years ago that flowed in the same glacial valley.

The Black Tusk, a black pinnacle of volcanic rock on the northwestern shore of Garibaldi Lake, is the glacially eroded remnant of a much larger volcano that formed during two periods of volcanic activity. The first between 1.1 and 1.3 million years ago erupted hornblende andesite lava flows and tuffs. These volcanics compose mountain ridges southwest, southeast and northwest of the prime volcanic structure. Subsequent erosion demolished the newly formed volcano. This ultimately exposed the roots of the cone, which currently form the rugged edifice of The Black Tusk. After the cone was eroded, a series of hypersthene andesite lava flows were erupted between 0.17 and 0.21 million years ago. These end at adjacent ice-marginal lava flows that form cliffs. This eruptive phase also produced a lava dome that comprises the current high pinnacle. Consequently, the regional Late Pleistocene ice sheet carved a deep north-trending U-shaped valley into the eastern flank of the second-stage cone. Here, subsequent lava flows from Cinder Cone filled the valley.

===Central segment===
Immediately southeast of Mount Cayley lies Mount Fee, an extensively eroded volcano containing a north–south trending ridge. It is one of the older volcanic features in the central Garibaldi chain. Its volcanics are undated, but its large amount of dissection and evidence of glacial ice overriding the volcano indicates that it formed more than 75,000 years ago before the Wisconsinan Glaciation. Therefore, volcanism at Mount Fee does not display evidence of interaction with glacial ice. The remaining product from Fee&#x27;s earliest volcanic activity is a minor portion of pyroclastic rock. This is evidence of explosive volcanism from Fee&#x27;s eruptive history, as well as its first volcanic event. The second volcanic event produced a sequence of lavas and breccias on the eastern flank of the main ridge. These volcanics were likely placed when a sequence of lava flows and broken lava fragments erupted from a volcanic vent and moved down the flanks during the construction of a large volcano. Following extensive dissection, renewed volcanism produced a viscous series of lava flows forming its narrow, flat-topped, steep-sided northern limit and the northern end of the main ridge. The conduit for which these lava flows originated from was likely vertical in structure and intruded through older volcanics deposited during Fee&#x27;s earlier volcanic events. This volcanic event was also followed by a period of erosion, and likely one or more glacial periods. Extensive erosion following the last volcanic event at Mount Fee has created the rugged north–south trending ridge that currently forms a prominent landmark.

Ember Ridge, a volcanic mountain ridge between Tricouni Peak and Mount Fee, consists of at least eight lava domes composed of andesite. They were likely formed between 25,000 and 10,000 years ago when lava erupted beneath glacial ice of the Fraser Glaciation. Their current structures are comparable to their original forms due to the minimal degree of erosion. As a result, the domes display the shaps and columnar joints typical of subglacial volcanoes. The random shaps of the Ember Ridge domes are the result of erupted lava taking advantage of former ice pockets, eruptions taking place on uneven surfaces, subsidence of the domes during volcanic activity to create rubble and separation of older columnar units during more recent eruptions. The northern dome, known as Ember Ridge North, covers the summit and eastern flank of a mountain ridge. It comprises at least one lava flow that reaches a thickness of , as well as the thinnest columnar units in the Mount Cayley volcanic field. The small size of the columnar joints indicates that the erupted lava was cooled immediately and are mainly located on the dome&#x27;s summit. Ember Ridge Northeast, the smallest subglacial dome of Ember Ridge, comprises one lava flow that has a thickness no more than . Ember Ridge Northwest, the most roughly circular subglacial dome, comprises at least one lava flow. Ember Ridge Southeast is the most complex of the Ember Ridge domes, consisting of a series of lava flows with a thickness of . It is also the only Ember Ridge dome that contains large amounts of rubble. Ember Ridge Southwest comprises at least one lava flow that reaches a thickness of . It is the only subglacial dome of Ember Ridge that contains hyaloclastite. Ember Ridge West comprises only one lava flow that reaches a thickness of .
To the northwest, Mount Cayley constitutes the largest and most persistent volcano in the central Garibaldi Belt. It is a highly eroded stratovolcano composed of dacite and rhyodacite lava that was deposited during three phases of volcanic activity. The first eruptive phase started about four million years ago with the eruption of dacite lava flows and pyroclastic rock. This resulted in the creation of Mount Cayley itself. Subsequent volcanism during this volcanic phase constructed a significant lava dome. This acts like a volcanic plug and composes the lava spines that currently form pinnacles on Cayley&#x27;s rugged summit. After Mount Cayley was constructed, lava flows, tephra and welded dacite rubble were erupted. This second phase of activity million years ago resulted in the creation of the Vulcan&#x27;s Thumb, a craggy volcanic ridge on the southern flank of Mount Cayley. Lengthy dissection from an extended period of erosion demolished much of the original stratovolcano. Volcanic activity after this prolonged period of erosion produced thick dacite lava flows from parasitic vents 300,000 years ago that extended into the Turbid and Shovelnose Creek valleys near the Squamish River. This subsequently created two minor parasitic lava domes 200,000 years ago. These three volcanic events are in contrast to several others around Cayley in that they do not show signs of interaction with glacial ice.

Pali Dome, an eroded volcano north of Mount Cayley, consists of two geological units. Pail Dome East is composed of a mass of andesite lava flows and small amounts of pyroclastic material. It lies on the eastern portion of the large glacial icefield that covers much of the Mount Cayley volcanic field. Much of the lava flows form gentle topography at high elevations but terminate in finely jointed vertical cliffs at low elevations. The first volcanic activity likely occurred about 25,000 years ago, but it could also be significantly older. The most recent volcanic activity produced a series of lava flows that were erupted when the vent area was not covered by glacial ice. However, the flows show evidence of interaction with glacial ice in their lower units. This indicates that the lavas were erupted about 10,000 years ago during the waning stages of the Fraser Glaciation. The ice-marginal lava flows reach thicknesses of up to . Pali Dome West consists of at least three andesite lava flows and small amounts of pyroclastic material; its vent is presently buried under glacial ice. At least three eruptions have occurred at Pali Dome East. The age of the first volcanic eruption is unknown, but it could have occurred in the past 10,000 years. The second eruption produced a lava flow that was erupted when the vent area was not buried under glacial ice. However, the flow does show evidence of interaction with glacial ice at its lower unit. This indicates that the lavas were erupted during the waning stages of the Fraser Glaciation. The third and most recent eruption produced another lava flow that was largely erupted above glacial ice, but was probably constrained on its northern margin by a small glacier. Unlike the lava flow that was erupted during the second eruption, this lava flow was not impounded by glacial ice at its lower unit. This suggests that it erupted less than 10,000 years ago when the regional Fraser Glaciation retreated.

Cauldron Dome, a subglacial volcano north of Mount Cayley, lies west of the massive glacier covering much the region. Like Pali Dome, it is composed of two geological units. Upper Cauldron Dome is a flat-topped, oval-shaped pile of at least five andesite lava flows that resembles a tuya. The five andesite flows are columnar jointed and were likely extruded through glacial ice. The latest volcanic activity might have occurred between 10,000 and 25,000 years ago when this area was still influenced by glacial ice of the Fraser Glaciation. Lower Cauldron Dome, the youngest unit comprising the entire Cauldron Dome subglacial volcano, consists of a flat-topped, steep-sided pile of andesite lava flows long and a maximum thickness of . These volcanics were extruded about 10,000 years ago during the waning stages of the Fraser Glaciation from a vent adjacent to upper Cauldron Dome that is currently buried under glacial ice.
Lying at the northern portion of the Mount Cayley volcanic field is a subglacial volcano named Slag Hill. At least two geologic units compose the edifice. Slag Hill proper consists of andesite lava flows and small amounts of pyroclastic rock. Lying on the western portion of Slag Hill is a lava flow that likely erupted less than 10,000 years ago due to the lack of features indicating volcano-ice interactions. The Slag Hill flow-dominated tuya northeast of Slag Hill proper consists of a flat-topped, steep-sided pile of andesite. It protrudes through remnants of volcanic material erupted from the Slag Hill proper, but it represents a separate volcanic vent due to its geographical appearance. This small subglacial volcano possibly formed between 25,000 and 10,000 years ago throughout the waning stages of the Fraser Glaciation.

Ring Mountain, a flow-dominated tuya lying at the northern portion of the Mount Cayley volcanic field, consists of a pile of at least five andesite lava flows lying on a mountain ridge. Its steep-sided flanks reach heights of and are composed of volcanic rubble. This makes it impossible to measure its exact base elevation or how many lava flows constitute the edifice. With a summit elevation of , Ring Mountain had its last volcanic activity between 25,000 and 10,000 years ago when the Fraser Glaciation was close to its maximum. Northwest of Ring Mountain lies a minor andesite lava flow. Its chemistry is somewhat unlike other andesite flows comprising Ring Mountain, but it probably erupted from a volcanic vent adjacent to or at Ring Mountain. The part of it that lies higher in elevation contains some features that indicate lava-ice interactions, while the lower-elevation portion of it does not. Therefore, this minor lava flow was likely extruded after Ring Mountain formed but when glacial ice covered a broader area than it does currently, and that the lava flow extends beyond the region in which glacial ice existed at that time.

===Northern segment===

The Mount Meager massif is the most voluminous composite volcano in the Garibaldi chain and British Columbia, as well as the most recent to erupt. It has a volume of and consists of an eroded stratovolcano, ranging in composition from andesite to rhyodacite. Several dissected lava domes and volcanic plugs are present on its glaciated summit, as well as a clearly defined volcanic crater with a lava dome placed within it. At least eight volcanic vents compose the complex and have been the sources for volcanic activity throughout massif&#x27;s 2.2 million year history. A well-documented history of volcanism is present at the Mount Meager massif, with its most recent eruption about 2,350 years ago that was similar in character to the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens and the continuous eruption of Soufrière Hills on the island of Montserrat. This is the largest recorded Holocene explosive eruption in Canada, originating from a volcanic vent on the northeastern flank of Plinth Peak. It was Plinian in nature, sending an eruption column at least high into the stratosphere. As prevailing winds carried ash of the column eastwards, it deposited across British Columbia and Alberta. Subsequent pyroclastic flows were sent down the flanks of Plinth Peak for and were later succeeded by the eruption of a lava flow that demolished many times. This created thick agglutinated rubble that successfully blocked the adjacent Lillooet River to form a lake. Subsequently, the breccia dam collapsed to produce a catastrophic flood that deposited house-sized boulders more than downstream. After the flood took place, a small dacite lava flow was erupted that later solidified to form a series of well-preserved columnar joints. This is the last phase of the 2350 BP eruption, and subsequent stream erosion has cut through this lava flow to form a waterfall.

A group of small volcanoes on the upper Bridge River, known as the Bridge River Cones, includes stratovolcanoes, volcanic plugs and lava flows. These volcanoes are unlike others throughout the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt in that they are mainly composed of volcanic rocks with mafic compositions, including alkaline basalt and hawaiite. The different magma compositions might be related to a smaller degree of partial melting in the Earth&#x27;s mantle or a descending plate edge effect. The oldest volcano in the group, known as Sham Hill, is a high volcanic plug with a potassium-argon date of one million years. It is about wide and its uncovered glaciated surface is strewn with glacial erratics. Its massive level rock columns were constructed inside the main volcanic vent of a stratovolcano that has since been reduced by erosion. To the southeast, the Salal Glacier volcanic complex was constructed between 970,000 and 590,000 years ago. It consists of subaerial tephra and thin lava flow deposits that are surrounded by thick ice-ponded lava flows. These ice-marginal lava flows were created when lava ponded against glacial ice in the nearby valleys before the Wisconsin Glaciation. North of the Salal Glacier complex lies a small basaltic stratovolcano named Tuber Hill. It began to form about 600,000 years ago when adjacent valleys were filled by glacial ice. When lava flows were erupted from Tuber Hill, they interacted with the valley-filling glaciers on its southern flank and produced a glacial meltwater lake. Here, more than of stacked hyaloclastite, lahars and lacustrine tuff were deposited. A series of pillow lavas were also deposited during this eruptive period. The most recent volcanic activity in the Bridge River volcanic field produced a series of basaltic lava flows in the regional valleys that overlie till of the last glacial period. The age of these valley-filling lava flows is unknown but the presence of unconsolidated glacial till under the flows suggests that they are less than 1,500 years old.

To the northwest, the Franklin Glacier Complex is a set of volcanic bedrock that encompasses an area long and wide. It has an elevation of over and is largely destroyed by erosion. A series of dikes and subvolcanic intrusions compose the complex, a few of which seem to represent vents for the overlying sequence of volcanic deposits. Volcanics include dacite breccia and small remnants of hornblende andesite lava flows associated with tuffs that reach thick. The complex is poorly known due to minimal studies, but potassium-argon dates obtained from some of the subvolcanic intrusions indicate that Franklin formed during two volcanic events, each separated by about five million years of dormancy. The first event occurred between six and eight million years ago when volcanic activity in the Garibaldi Belt had not moved to its current location, but was becoming more aerially restricted within a large band to the east and west. During this period, volcanic activity in the Garibaldi Belt and other portions of the northern Cascade Arc took place mainly at the Franklin Glacier Complex and in the Intermontane Belt further east. When the Garibaldi Belt moved to its current location five million years ago, another volcanic event occurred at the Franklin complex. This final and most recent volcanic event occurred between two and three million years ago, about a million years after Mount Cayley to the south began its formation.
Silverthrone Caldera is the largest and best-preserved of the two caldera complexes in the northern Garibaldi chain, the other being the Franklin Glacier Complex to the east-southeast. The caldera has a diameter of and contains breccia, lava flows and lava domes. Like Franklin to the east-southeast, the geology of Silverthrone is poorly known due to minimal studies. The region surrounding the Silverthrone complex is significantly jagged due to the mountainous terrain of the Coast Mountains. Near vertical flanks extend from near sea level to more than in elevation. Silverthrone is significantly younger than the Franklin Glacier Complex to the east-southeast and its volcanics likely have ages comparable to other volcanics throughout the Garibaldi chain. The oldest volcanics at the Silverthrone Caldera complex are composed of volcanic breccias, some of which became fused together by intense volcanic heat from when the deposits were first erupted. After these volcanics were deposited, a series of dacite, andesite and rhyolite lava flows were erupted upon volcanic breccia from the first volcanic phase. These eroded lava flows in total are thick. Volcanics in the lower portion of this series of lava flows give a potassium-argon date of 750,000 years while volcanics slightly above the lava flows are 400,000 years old. The most recent volcanic activity produced a series of andesite and basaltic andesite lava flows down Pashleth Creek and the Machmell and Kingcome river valleys. The lava flow extending from near Pashleth Creek to down the Machmell River valley is over in length. Its small amount of erosion indicates that it could be 1,000 years old or younger.

===Geothermal and seismic activity===
At least four volcanoes have had seismic activity since 1985, including Mount Garibaldi (three events), Mount Cayley (four events), Mount Meager massif (seventeen events) and the Silverthrone Caldera (two events). Seismic data suggest that these volcanoes still contain active magma chambers, indicating that some Garibaldi Belt volcanoes are likely active, with significant potential hazards. The seismic activity corresponds with some of Canada&#x27;s recently formed volcanoes and with persistent volcanoes that have had major explosive activity throughout their history, such as Mount Garibaldi and the Mount Cayley and Mount Meager massifs.
A series of hot springs adjacent to the Lillooet River valley, such as the Harrison, Sloquet, Clear Creek and Skookumchuck springs, are not known to occur near areas with recent volcanic activity. Instead, many are located close to 16–26 million year old intrusions that are interpreted to be the roots of heavily eroded volcanoes. These volcanoes formed part of the Cascade Volcanic Arc during the Miocene period and their intrusive roots extend from the Fraser Valley in the south to Salal Creek in the north. The relationship of these hot springs to the Garibaldi Belt is not clear. However, a few hot springs are known to exist in areas that have experienced relatively recent volcanic activity. About five hot springs exist in valleys near Mount Cayley and two small groups of hot springs are present at the Mount Meager massif. The springs at Meager massif might be evidence of a shallow magma chamber beneath the surface. No hot springs are known to exist at Mount Garibaldi like those found at Mount Meager and Mount Cayley, although there is evidence of abnormal high heat flow at the adjacent Table Meadows and other locations. Abnormal warm water adjacent to Britannia Beach could be geothermal activity linked to the Watts Point volcanic zone.

==History==

===Human occupation===
People have used resources in and around the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt for centuries. Obsidian was collected by the Squamish Nation for making knives, chisels, adzes and other sharp tools in pre-contact times. This material appears in sites dated 10,000 years old up to protohistoric time periods. The source for this material is found in upper parts of the mountainous terrain that surround Mount Garibaldi. At Opal Cone, lava of the Ring Creek flow was normally heated to cook food because its pumice-like texture is able to maintain heat. It also did not break after it was used for a long period of time.

A large pumice outcrop adjacent to the Mount Meager massif has been mined several times in the past, and extends more than in length and in width with a thickness of about . The deposit was first hired by J. MacIsaac, who died in the late 1970s. In the mid-1970s the second hirer, W.H. Willes, investigated and mined the pumice. It was crushed, removed then stored close to the village of Pemberton. Later, the bridge that was used to access the pumice deposit was washed out. Mining operations resumed in 1988 when the deposit was staked by L.B. Bustin. In 1990, the pumice outcrop was bought by D.R. Carefoot from the owners B. Chore and M. Beaupre. In a program from 1991 to 1992, workers evaluated the deposit for its properties as a construction material, absorber of oil and stonewash. About of pumice was mined in 1998 by the Great Pacific Pumice Incorporation.

The hot springs associated with Meager and Cayley have made these two volcanoes targets for geothermal explorations. At Mount Cayley, temperatures of to more than have been measured in shallow boreholes on its southwestern flank. Further north, geothermal exploration at the Mount Meager massif has been undertaken by BC Hydro since the late 1970s. Bottom hole temperatures have been calculated at an average of to , with being the highest recorded temperature. This indicates that the area around Meager is a major geothermal site. The geothermal power is expected to run throughout Western Canada and the likelihood of it extending into the western United States is probable.

===Early impressions===
The belt of volcanoes has been the subject of myths and legends by First Nations. To the Squamish Nation, Mount Garibaldi is called &quot;Nch&#x27;kay&quot;. In their language it means &quot;Dirty Place&quot;. This name of the mountain refers to the volcanic rubble in the area. This mountain, like others located in the area, is considered sacred as it plays an important part of their history. In their oral history, they passed down a story of the flood covering the land. During this time, only two mountains peaked over the water, and Garibaldi was one of them. It was here that the remaining survivors of the flood latched their canoes to the peak and waited for the waters to subside. The Black Tusk on the northwestern end of Garibaldi Lake and Mount Cayley northwest of Mount Garibaldi are called &quot;tak&#x27;takmu&#x27;yin tl&#x27;a in7in&#x27;axa7en&quot; in the Squamish language, which means &quot;Landing Place of the Thunderbird&quot;. The Thunderbird is a legendary creature in North American indigenous peoples&#x27; history and culture. The rocks that make up The Black Tusk and Mount Cayley were said to have been burnt black by the Thunderbird&#x27;s lightning.

===Protection and monitoring===

A number of volcanic features in the Garibaldi Belt are protected by provincial parks. Garibaldi Provincial Park at the southern end of the chain was established in 1927 to protect the abundant geological history, glaciated mountains and other natural resources in the region. It was named after the stratovolcano Mount Garibaldi, which in turn was named after the Italian military and political leader Giuseppe Garibaldi in 1860. To the northwest, Brandywine Falls Provincial Park protects Brandywine Falls, a high waterfall composed of at least four basaltic lava flows with columnar joints. Its name origin is unclear, but it may have originated from two surveyors named Jack Nelson and Bob Mollison.

Like other volcanic zones in Canada, the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt is not monitored closely enough by the Geological Survey of Canada to ascertain how active its magma system is. This is partly because several volcanoes in the chain are located in remote regions and no major eruptions have occurred in Canada in the past few hundred years. As a result, volcano monitoring is less important than dealing with other natural processes, including tsunamis, earthquakes and landslides. However, with the existence of earthquakes, further volcanism is expected and would probably have considerable effects, particularly in a region like southwestern British Columbia where the Garibaldi volcanoes are located in a highly populated area.

==Volcanic hazards==
The volcanoes comprising the Garibaldi chain are adjacent to the highly populated southwest portion of British Columbia. Unlike the central Cascade Arc, renewed volcanic activity in the Garibaldi Belt at a single feeder to create stratovolcanoes is not typical. Instead, volcanic activity results in the formation of volcanic fields. Of the entire Cascade Arc, the Garibaldi chain has the lowest rate of volcanic activity. In the past two million years, the volume of erupted material in the Garibaldi Belt has been less than 10% of that in the U.S. states of California and Oregon and about 20% of that within the U.S. state of Washington. As a result, the risk of eruptions throughout this part of the Cascade Arc is minor. Individual volcanoes and volcanic fields remain quiet for a long period of time and certain vents may never erupt again. However, considerable volcanic activity has taken place in the geologically recent past, most notably the explosive eruption that occurred at the Mount Meager massif 2,350 years ago.

Jack Souther, a leading authority on geothermal resources and volcanism in the Canadian Cordillera has stated, &quot;at present the volcanoes of the Garibaldi Belt are quiet, presumed dead but still not completely cold. But the flare-up of Meager Mountain 2,500 years ago raises the question, &#x27;Could it happen again?&#x27; Was the explosive eruption of Meager Mountain the last gasp of the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt or only the most recent event in its on-going life? The short answer is nobody really knows for sure ... So just in case I sometimes do a quick check of the old hot-spots when I get off the Peak Chair ...&quot; Recent seismic imaging from Geological Survey of Canada employees supported lithoprobe studies in the region of Mount Cayley in which scientists found a large reflector interpreted to be a pool of molten rock roughly below the surface. The existence of hot springs at the Mount Meager massif and Mount Cayley indicates that magmatic heat is still present beneath or near these volcanoes. This long history of volcanic activity along a still active plate boundary indicates that volcanic eruptions in the Garibaldi Belt have not ended and risks for future eruptions remain.

===Tephra===

The largest threat from volcanoes in the Garibaldi chain would likely be due to tephra released during explosive eruptions. Mount Meager massif in particular poses a major long-distance threat to communities throughout southern British Columbia and Alberta because of its explosive history. It is estimated that over 200 eruptions have occurred throughout the entire Cascade Volcanic Arc in the past 12,000 years, many of them in the United States. Many eruptions in the western United States have sent large amounts of tephra in southern British Columbia. However, all major cities in southwestern British Columbia with populations more than 100,000 are located west of the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt and prevailing winds travel eastwards. Therefore, these communities are less likely to have large amounts of tephra. In the Lower Mainland, a thick layer of volcanic ash can deposit once every 10,000 years and once every 1,000 years. More minor amounts of volcanic ash can be expected more commonly. During Mount St. Helens&#x27; eruption in 1980, of tephra was deposited from southeastern British Columbia to Manitoba.

Even though all major cities in southwestern British Columbia are located west of the Garibaldi chain, future eruptions are expected to have significant impacts on the adjacent townships of Squamish and Whistler. An eruption column released during Peléan activity would discharge large amounts of tephra that would endanger aircraft. Tephra may also melt the large sheets of glacial ice east of Garibaldi and cause floods. This could later endanger water supplies from Pitt Lake and fisheries on the Pitt River. An explosive eruption and the associated tephra may also create temporary or longer-term water supply difficulties for Vancouver and most of southern British Columbia. The water reservoir for the Greater Vancouver drainage area is south of Mount Garibaldi.

===Landslides and lahars===
Several landslides and lahars have occurred throughout the Garibaldi Belt. At the Mount Meager massif, considerable landslides have occurred from Pylon Peak and Devastator Peak in the past 10,000 years that have reached more than downstream in the Lillooet River valley. At least two significant landslides from the southern flank of Pylon Peak 8,700 and 4,400 years ago dumped volcanic debris into the adjacent valley of Meager Creek. More recently, a large landslide from Devastation Glacier buried and killed a group of four geologists on July 22, 1975. The estimated volume of this landslide is . A considerable landslide as large as Meager&#x27;s largest throughout the Holocene would likely produce a lahar that would devastate most of the growth in the Lillooet River valley. If such an event would occur without it being identified by authorities who would send out a public warning, it would kill hundreds or even thousands of residents. Because of this, computer programs would be able to identify the approaching information and activate an automatic notice when a large lahar is identified. A similar system for identifying such lahars exists at Mount Rainier in the U.S. state of Washington.

Large landslides from Mount Cayley have occurred on its western flank, including a major debris avalanche about 4,800 years ago that dumped an areal extent of of volcanic material into the adjacent valley bottom. This blocked the Squamish River for a long period of time. Although there are no known eruptions from the massif in the past 10,000 years, it is associated with a group of hot springs. Evans (1990) has indicated that a number of landslides and debris flows at Mount Cayley in the past 10,000 years might have been caused by volcanic activity. Since the 4,800 BP landslide, a number of more minor landslides have occurred at it. In 1968 and 1983, a series of landslides took place that caused considerable damage to logging roads and forest stands, but did not result in any casualties.

===Lava flows===
The threat from lava flows in the Garibaldi Belt is minor unless an eruption takes place in winter or under or adjacent to areas of glacial ice, such as ice fields. When lava flows over large areas of snow, it creates meltwater. This can produce lahars that could flow further than the associated lavas. If water were to enter a volcanic vent that is erupting basaltic lava, it may create a massive explosive eruption. These explosions are generally more extreme than those during normal basaltic eruptions. Therefore, the existence of water, snow, or glacial ice at a volcanic vent would increase the risk of an eruption having a large impact on the surrounding region. Subglacial eruptions have also caused catastrophic glacial outburst floods.

<text>Neurulation refers to the folding process in vertebrate embryos, which includes the transformation of the neural plate into the neural tube. The embryo at this stage is termed the neurula.

The process begins when the notochord induces the formation of the central nervous system (CNS) by signaling the ectoderm germ layer above it to form the thick and flat neural plate. The neural plate folds in upon itself to form the neural tube, which will later differentiate into the spinal cord and the brain, eventually forming the central nervous system. Computer simulations found that cell wedging and differential proliferation are sufficient for mammalian neurulation.

Different portions of the neural tube form by two different processes, called primary and secondary neurulation, in different species.
* In primary neurulation, the neural plate creases inward until the edges come in contact and fuse.
* In secondary neurulation, the tube forms by hollowing out of the interior of a solid precursor.

==Primary neurulation ==

=== Primary neural induction ===
The concept of induction originated in work by Pandor in 1817. The first experiments proving induction were attributed by Viktor Hamburger to independent discoveries of both Hans Spemann of Germany in 1901 and Warren Lewis of the USA in 1904. It was Hans Spemann who first popularized the term “primary neural induction” in reference to the first differentiation of ectoderm into neural tissue during neurulation. It was called &quot;primary&quot; because it was thought to be the first induction event in embryogenesis. The Nobel prize-winning experiment was done by his student Hilda Mangold. Ectoderm from the region of the dorsal lip of the blastopore of a developing salamander embryo was transplanted into another embryo and this &quot;organizer&quot; tissue “induced” the formation of a full secondary axis changing surrounding tissue in the original embryo from ectodermal to neural tissue. The tissue from the donor embryo was therefore referred to as the inducer because it induced the change. While the organizer is the dorsal lip of the blastopore, this is not one set of cells, but rather is a constantly changing group of cells that migrate over the dorsal lip of the blastopore by forming apically constricted bottle cells. At any given time during gastrulation there will be different cells that make up the organizer.

Subsequent work on inducers by scientists over the 20th century demonstrated that not only could the dorsal lip of the blastopore act as an inducer but so could a huge number of other seemingly unrelated items. This began when boiled ectoderm was found to still be able to induce by Johannes Holtfreter. Items as diverse as low pH, cyclic AMP, even floor dust could act as inducers leading to considerable consternation. Even tissue which could not induce when living could induce when boiled. Other items such as lard, wax, banana peels and coagulated frog’s blood did not induce. The hunt for a chemically based inducer molecule was taken up by developmental molecular biologists and a vast literature of items shown to have inducer abilities continued to grow. More recently, the inducer molecule has been attributed to genes and in 1995, there was a call for all the genes involved in primary neural induction and all their interactions to be catalogued in an effort to determine “the molecular nature of Spemann’s organizer”. Several other proteins and growth factors have also been invoked as inducers including soluble growth factors such as bone morphogenetic protein, and a requirement for “inhibitory signals” such as noggin and follistatin.

Even before the term induction was popularized, several authors, beginning with Hans Driesch in 1894, suggested that primary neural induction might be mechanical in nature. A mechanochemical-based model for primary neural induction was proposed in 1985 by G.W. Brodland and R. Gordon. An actual physical wave of contraction has been shown to originate from the precise location of the Spemann organizer which then traverses the presumptive neural epithelium and a full working model of how primary neural inductions was proposed in 2006. There has long been a general reluctance in the field to consider the possibility that primary neural induction might be initiated by mechanical effects. A full explanation for primary neural induction remains yet to be found.

=== Shape change ===
As neurulation proceeds after induction, the cells of the neural plate become high-columnar and can be identified through microscopy as different from the surrounding presumptive epithelial ectoderm (epiblastic endoderm in amniotes). The cells move laterally and away from the central axis and change into a truncated pyramid shape. This pyramid shape is achieved through tubulin and actin in the apical portion of the cell which constricts as they move. The variation in cell shapes is partially determined by the location of the nucleus within the cell, causing bulging in areas of the cells forcing the height and shape of the cell to change. This process is known as apical constriction. The result is a flattening of the differentiating neural plate which is particularly obvious in salamanders when the previously round gastrula becomes a rounded ball with a flat top. See Neural plate.

=== Folding ===
The process of the flat neural plate folding into the cylindrical neural tube is termed primary neurulation. As a result of the cellular shape changes, the neural plate forms the medial hinge point (MHP). The expanding epidermis puts pressure on the MHP and causes the neural plate to fold resulting in neural folds and the creation of the neural groove. The neural folds form dorsolateral hinge points (DLHP) and pressure on this hinge cause the neural folds to meet and fuse at the midline. The fusion requires the regulation of cell adhesion molecules. The neural plate switches from E-cadherin expression to N-cadherin and N-CAM expression to recognize each other as the same tissue and close the tube. This change in expression stops the binding of the neural tube to the epidermis.

The notochord plays an integral role in the development of the neural tube. Prior to neurulation, during the migration of epiblastic endoderm cells towards the hypoblastic endoderm, the notochordal process opens into an arch termed the notochordal plate and attaches overlying neuroepithelium of the neural plate. The notochordal plate then serves as an anchor for the neural plate and pushes the two edges of the plate upwards while keeping the middle section anchored. Some of the notochodral cells become incorporated into the center section neural plate to later form the floor plate of the neural tube. The notochord plate separates and forms the solid notochord.

The folding of the neural tube to form an actual tube does not occur all at once. Instead, it begins approximately at the level of the fourth somite at Carnegie stage 9 (around embryonic day 20 in humans). The lateral edges of the neural plate touch in the midline and join together. This continues both cranially (toward the head) and caudally (toward the tail). The openings that are formed at the cranial and caudal regions are termed the cranial and caudal neuropores. In human embryos, the cranial neuropore closes approximately on day 24 and the caudal neuropore on day 28. Failure of the cranial (superior) and caudal (inferior) neuropore closure results in conditions called anencephaly and spina bifida, respectively. Additionally, failure of the neural tube to close throughout the length of the body results in a condition called rachischisis.

=== Patterning ===
According to the French Flag model where stages of development are directed by gene product gradients, several genes are considered important for inducing patterns in the open neural plate, especially for the development of neurogenic placodes. These placodes first become evident histologically in the open neural plate. After sonic hedgehog (SHH) signalling from the notochord induces its formation, the floor plate of the incipient neural tube also secretes SHH. After closure, the neural tube forms a basal or floor plate and a roof or alar plate in response to the combined effects of SHH and factors including BMP4 secreted by the roof plate. The basal plate forms most of the ventral portion of the nervous system, including the motor portion of the spinal cord and brain stem; the alar plate forms the dorsal portions, devoted mostly to sensory processing.

The dorsal epidermis expresses BMP4 and BMP7. The roof plate of the neural tube responds to those signals by expressing more BMP4 and other transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) signals to form a dorsal/ventral gradient among the neural tube. The notochord expresses SHH. The floor plate responds to SHH by producing its own SHH and forming a gradient. These gradients allow for the differential expression of transcription factors.

=== Complexities of the model ===
Neural tube closure is not entirely understood. Closure of the neural tube varies by species. In mammals, closure occurs by meeting at multiple points which then close up and down. In birds, neural tube closure begins at one point of the midbrain and moves anteriorly and posteriorly.

==Secondary neurulation==
Primary neurulation develops into secondary neurulation when the caudal neuropore undergoes final closure. The cavity of the spinal cord extends into the neural cord. In secondary neurulation, the neural ectoderm and some cells from the endoderm form the medullary cord. The medullary cord condenses, separates and then forms cavities. These cavities then merge to form a single tube. Secondary neurulation occurs in the posterior section of most animals but it is better expressed in birds. Tubes from both primary and secondary neurulation eventually connect at around the sixth week of development.

In humans, the mechanisms of secondary neurulation plays an important role given its impact on the proper formation of the human posterior spinal cord. Errors at any point in the process can yield problems. For example, retained medullary cord occurs due to a partial or complete arrest of secondary neurulation that creates a non-functional portion on the vestigial end.

== Early brain development ==
The anterior portion of the neural tube forms the three main parts of the brain: the forebrain (prosencephalon), midbrain (mesencephalon), and the hindbrain (rhombencephalon). These structures initially appear just after neural tube closure as bulges called brain vesicles in a pattern specified by anterior-posterior patterning genes, including Hox genes, other transcription factors such as Emx, Otx, and Pax genes, and secreted signaling factors such as fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and Wnts. These brain vesicles further divide into subregions. The prosencephalon gives rise to the telencephalon and diencephalon, and the rhombencephalon generates the metencephalon and myelencephalon. The hindbrain, which is the evolutionarily most ancient part of the chordate brain, also divides into different segments called rhombomeres. The rhombomeres generate many of the most essential neural circuits needed for life, including those that control respiration and heart rate, and produce most of the cranial nerves. Neural crest cells form ganglia above each rhombomere. The early neural tube is primarily composed of the germinal neuroepithelium, later called the ventricular zone, which contains primary neural stem cells called radial glial cells and serves as the main source of neurons produced during brain development through the process of neurogenesis.

== Non-neural ectoderm tissue ==

Paraxial mesoderm surrounding the notochord at the sides will develop into the somites (future muscles, bones, and contributes to the formation of limbs of the vertebrate ).

== Neural crest cells ==

Masses of tissue called the neural crest that are located at the very edges of the lateral plates of the folding neural tube separate from the neural tube and migrate to become a variety of different but important cells.

Neural crest cells will migrate through the embryo and will give rise to several cell populations, including pigment cells and the cells of the peripheral nervous system.

==Neural tube defects==

Failure of neurulation, especially failure of closure of the neural tube are among the most common and disabling birth defects in humans, occurring in roughly 1 in every 500 live births. Failure of the rostral end of the neural tube to close results in anencephaly, or lack of brain development, and is most often fatal. Failure of the caudal end of the neural tube to close causes a condition known as spina bifida, in which the spinal cord fails to close.

<text>The Battle of Mine Creek, also known as the Battle of Little Osage, was fought on October 25, 1864, in Linn County, Kansas, as part of Price&#x27;s Missouri Campaign during the American Civil War. Major-General Sterling Price had begun an expedition in September 1864 to restore Confederate control of Missouri. After being defeated at Westport near Kansas City on October 23, Price&#x27;s army began to retreat south through Kansas. Early on October 25, Price&#x27;s army was defeated at the Marais des Cygnes. After Marais des Cygnes, the Confederates fell back, but were stalled at the crossing of Mine Creek while a wagon train attempted to cross.

Union cavalry commanded by Colonel John F. Philips and Lieutenant Colonel Frederick W. Benteen caught up to Price&#x27;s army while it was stalled at the creek crossing. Confederate cavalry commanded by Major General James F. Fagan and Brigadier General John S. Marmaduke attempted to defend against the Union assault, but were soundly defeated. Many Confederate soldiers were captured, including Marmaduke. Later on the 25th, Price was again defeated at the Battle of Marmiton River. After Marmiton River, Price destroyed many of his wagons. On October 28, the Union defeated Price again at the Second Battle of Newtonia, and the shattered Confederate army reached Texas in December. The site of the battle was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973 as the Battle of Mine Creek Site, and the Kansas Historical Society created the Mine Creek Battlefield State Historic Site in 1974. Mine Creek is considered to be one of the largest battles between mounted cavalry during the war.

==Background==
During the American Civil War, in the fall of 1864, Major General Sterling Price led an expedition into Missouri hoping to capture that state for the Confederacy and affect the 1864 United States Presidential Election. Price formed an army consisting of three divisions (commanded by Major General James F. Fagan and Brigadier Generals John S. Marmaduke and Joseph O. Shelby) and left Arkansas for Missouri in September. On September 26, Price&#x27;s army found and assaulted a Union force near Pilot Knob. Price&#x27;s army was repulsed in the ensuing Battle of Fort Davidson, although the Union garrison retreated after the battle. The Confederates then moved north towards the Missouri River and captured a small Union force at the Battle of Glasgow on October 15 and began moving towards Kansas City.

Union columns commanded by Major Generals Samuel R. Curtis and Alfred Pleasonton began pursuing Price, who won another victory at the Second Battle of Lexington on October 19. A delaying action at the Battle of Little Blue River (October 21) allowed Union forces to catch up with Price. After smaller clashes at the battles of Second Independence (October 22) and the Big Blue River (October 22 and 23), Curtis and Pleasonton decisively defeated Price&#x27;s army at the Battle of Westport on October 23.

The Confederates began retreating through Kansas, and early on October 25, Price&#x27;s army was defeated in a small action near the Marais des Cygnes River. Price&#x27;s army was slowed during the retreat by a large supply train, which halted at the ford at Mine Creek. Union cavalry caught up to the stalled Confederates during the late morning on the 25th.

==Opposing forces==

===Union===

The Union forces pursuing Price&#x27;s column were all organized into the Army of the Border, commanded by Curtis. Curtis&#x27; army contained two divisions. The first was commanded by Major General James G. Blunt and consisted of four brigades, commanded by Colonels Charles R. Jennison, Thomas Moonlight, Charles W. Blair, and James H. Ford. The division was almost entirely cavalry, and contained militia units, especially in Blair&#x27;s brigade. Blunt&#x27;s men were from Kansas, Wisconsin, and the Colorado Territory. Curtis&#x27; second division was commanded by Pleasonton, and also contained four brigades. Pleasonton&#x27;s brigades were commanded by Colonel John F. Philips, Brigadier Generals John McNeil and John B. Sanborn, and Lieutenant Colonel Frederick W. Benteen. Like Blunt&#x27;s division, Pleasonton&#x27;s division was primarily cavalry and contained a substantial militia element. Pleasonton&#x27;s units were from Missouri, Kansas, Illinois, Iowa, and Indiana.

===Confederate===

Price had divided his force into three divisions, commanded by Marmaduke, Shelby, and Fagan. Fagan&#x27;s division contained four brigades, commanded by Brigadier General William L. Cabell and Colonels William F. Slemons, Archibald S. Dobbins, and Thomas H. McCray. Several miscellaneous units were assigned to Fagan&#x27;s division, but not placed in any brigade. Fagan&#x27;s units were from Arkansas and Missouri. Marmaduke&#x27;s division consisted of two brigades, commanded by Brigadier General John Bullock Clark Jr. and Colonel Thomas R. Freeman. Marmaduke&#x27;s men were from Missouri, Arkansas, and Texas. Shelby&#x27;s division contained three brigades, commanded by militia officer M. Jeff Thompson and Colonels Sidney D. Jackman and Charles H. Tyler. The men of Shelby&#x27;s division were from Arkansas and Missouri. Price&#x27;s army consisted almost entirely of cavalry.

==Battle==
Despite the skirmish near the Marais des Cygnes, Price did not believe his force was in substantial danger, and sent Shelby&#x27;s division towards Fort Scott to make an attempting at capturing the post. Marmaduke and Fagan remained with some of the wagon train near the crossing of Mine Creek, north of the Little Osage River. The crossing of Mine Creek was not easily navigated, and a pileup soon formed. The Confederates decided to make a stand north of the creek in an attempt to protect the wagons. Fagan and Marmaduke formed an -long line, with Fagan on the left and Marmaduke on the right. Four cannons were positioned in the center of the line, and two more were posted on each flank. The Confederate line was defended by an estimated 7,000 men.

Some of the leading Union troops caught up with the Confederate column. However, Blunt&#x27;s division was lagging, and would not arrive in time for the battle. Philips&#x27; brigade reached the field first, and a long-range fight began. The Confederates used their artillery; Philips&#x27; force lacked artillery, and was forced to be contented with long-range fire from repeating rifles. Cabell entertained the thought of attacking Philips with his brigade of Confederates, but decided against a charge due to the disorganization of the Confederate line and the arrival of Benteen&#x27;s Union brigade. Combined, Philips&#x27; and Benteen&#x27;s brigades numbered about 2,500 to 2,600 men. Despite being outnumbered, the Union commanders decided to attack the Confederate line. One of the driving factors behind the decision to attack was Benteen&#x27;s belief that the Confederates had made an error in the emplacement of their artillery. The Confederate cannons were placed close to the front line, and would only have the chance to fire one or two rounds before a cavalry charge could reach them.

The Union charge was made while the cavalrymen were still mounted; the Confederate forces were also on horseback. The Union attack faltered during the middle of the charge, when both the 10th Missouri Cavalry of Benteen&#x27;s brigade and Philips&#x27; brigade stopped the attack before reaching the Confederate line. The 10th Missouri had met heavy small arms fire from the Confederate lines stopped under the fire, and Philips halted his brigade to keep in line with Benteen. This left the Union cavalrymen stationary and vulnerable to a potential Confederate counterattack. The Confederates were too disorganized to attempt a counterattack and the 4th Iowa Cavalry of Benteen&#x27;s brigade broke the impasse by renewing the attack. The 3rd Iowa Cavalry followed the 4th Iowa, and eventually the whole of Benteen&#x27;s brigade rejoined the charge. Benteen&#x27;s force aimed for the center of Marmaduke&#x27;s side of the Confederate line, and Philips&#x27; brigade headed towards Fagan&#x27;s left flank once the unit resumed forward progress.

Once Benteen and Philips reached the main Confederate line, the position did not hold long. The Union troopers&#x27; repeating rifles gave them a firepower advantage over the Confederates, who were mostly armed with single-shot weapons. Clark&#x27;s Confederate brigade became engaged in a melee, and quickly fell back. Marmaduke&#x27;s other brigade, Freeman&#x27;s, contained mainly newly recruited men and fell back before the Union charge completely reached their line. After Clark and Freeman fell back, the position of Cabell&#x27;s Confederate brigade became exposed, and it too retreated. Soon, almost the entire Confederate line was in retreat towards the crossing of Mine Creek. Unable to cross the creek, many of the Confederates soldiers were captured. One of the prisoners was Marmaduke himself. The Confederate general was captured by Private James Dunlavy of the 3rd Iowa. As a reward for capturing Marmaduke, Dunlavy was given military leave for the remainder of his time of service. Dunlavy later received the Medal of Honor for &quot;[g]allantry in capturing Gen. Marmaduke&quot;. Cabell was also made a prisoner, and the Union troops captured either eight or ten cannons.

Philips&#x27; and Benteen&#x27;s brigades crossed the ford and continuing pursuing the Confederates. Confusion began to overtake the field, partially because many of the Confederates were wearing captured Union uniforms. Fagan attempted to rally his forces into a line capable of halting the Union pursuit, but the attempt failed. Pleasonton and Curtis arrived on the field late in the fighting, and the battle ended when Pleasonton ordered Benteen and Philips to stop the pursuit.

==Aftermath==
Confederate casualties are estimated to have numbered around 1,200. Union losses were around 100 to 110. Shelby&#x27;s division returned in time to provide a rear guard for the defeated Confederates. Price&#x27;s surviving wagons would again be delayed late on the 25th, this time at the crossing of the Marmaton River. After a short fight at the Battle of Marmiton River, Price decided to destroy all of the wagons that did not contain essential military supplies. The retreating Confederates were again defeated at the Second Battle of Newtonia on October 28. After the defeat at Newtonia, Price&#x27;s army began to fall to pieces, and was pursued by Curtis&#x27; army all the way to the Arkansas River. By December, the shattered remainder of Price&#x27;s army reached Texas, with the campaign having ended in a decisive defeat. The defeat of Price&#x27;s expedition marked the last major Confederate operation in the Trans-Mississippi Theater. Mine Creek gained the distinction of being one the largest battles between mounted cavalry in the war.

==Legacy==
The site of the battle was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973 as the Battle of Mine Creek Site. At the time of the listing, the site was considered to be in &quot;good&quot; condition, although the prairie has been converted into cultivated agricultural land, a pond has been constructed, and the number of trees on the site has increased. The Kansas Historical Society has also preserved the site as Mine Creek Battlefield State Historic Site; the site was officially founded in 1974. Marked trails are present at the site, allowing visitors to view the significant features of the battlefield. A visitor&#x27;s center has also been constructed.

As of 2019, the American Battlefield Trust and its partners have acquired and preserved of the battlefield.

On November 15, 2004, the History Channel released a documentary about the battle titled &quot;Mine Creek: The Lost Battle of the Civil War&quot;.

<doc id="1035634" wikidata="Q7782507" url="?curid=1035634" title="Therapeutic abortion committee">
<text>Therapeutic abortion committees (commonly known as TACs) were committees established under the Canadian &quot;Criminal Code&quot;. Each committee consisted of three medical doctors who would decide whether a request for an abortion fit within the exception to the criminal offence of procuring a miscarriage, i.e. performing an abortion. The Criminal Code only permitted lawful abortion if continuation of a pregnancy would cause a woman medical harm, as certified by a TAC. The TACs were almost always composed of men, due to fewer women practicing medicine and even fewer having these types of high level positions. These restrictions on abortion were struck down as unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of Canada in its decision in &quot;R v Morgentaler&quot; in 1988.

==Abortion law in Canada prior to 1968==
Prior to 1968, abortion was a criminal offence in Canada. Any woman who sought an abortion was potentially committing a criminal offence. If a doctor performed an abortion on compassionate or medical grounds, the doctor ran the risk of being prosecuted under the Criminal Code.

In many cases, judges were willing to convict but juries were unwilling to condemn any qualified medical doctor acting in good faith with the intention to protect the health of a patient.

==Introduction of therapeutic abortion committees in 1968==
In 1968, the federal Minister of Justice, Pierre Trudeau, introduced the &quot;Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1968–69&quot; to amend the &quot;Criminal Code&quot; in many respects, including in relation to abortion. The bill introduced the concept of therapeutic abortion committees, which could approve abortions for medical reasons. The committees were based in hospitals and had to be composed of three doctors. The doctor who proposed to perform an abortion could not be a member of the committee which considered the request.

==Text of the law==
Following the passage of the &quot;Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1968–69&quot;, the provisions dealing with abortion read as follows:

:&quot;251. (1) Every one who, with intent to procure the miscarriage of a female person, whether or not she is pregnant, uses any means for the purpose of carrying out his intention is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for life.&quot;

:&quot;(2) Every female person who, being pregnant, with intent to procure her own miscarriage, uses any means or permits any means to be used for the purpose of carrying out her intention is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for two years.&quot;
:&quot;(4) Subsections (1) and (2) do not apply to&quot;

::&quot;(a) a qualified medical practitioner, other than a member of a therapeutic abortion committee for any hospital, who in good faith uses in an accredited or approved hospital any means for the purpose of carrying out his intention to procure the miscarriage of a female person, or&quot;

::&quot;(b) a female person who, being pregnant, permits a qualified medical practitioner to use in an accredited or approved hospital any means described in paragraph (a) for the purpose of carrying out her intention to procure her own miscarriage,&quot;

:&quot;if, before the use of those means, the therapeutic abortion committee for that accredited or approved hospital, by a majority of the members of the committee and at a meeting of the committee at which the case of such female person has been reviewed,&quot;

::&quot;(c) has by certificate in writing stated that in its opinion the continuation of the pregnancy of such female person would or would be likely to endanger her life or health, and&quot;

::&quot;(d) has caused a copy of such certificate to be given to the qualified medical practitioner.&quot;

These were the provisions of the law which the Supreme Court ruled to be unconstitutional in &quot;R v Morgentaler&quot;.

==The law in operation==

===Abortion clinics not covered===
Abortion clinics were illegal under this law; in Québec only, authorities concluded in the 1970s that the law was unenforceable after a number of unsuccessful criminal cases against doctors. Most notably Henry Morgentaler openly operated clinics as a form of civil disobedience in order to establish a judicial test case based on the legal defence of necessity.

===Variation from hospital to hospital===
Even within the hospital system, there were great discrepancies between what different TAC&#x27;s in different hospitals would be willing to consider a risk to a woman&#x27;s health.

In some hospitals, mental health problems resulting from carrying a pregnancy to term were acceptable to the TAC as endangering a woman&#x27;s health. This made abortion partially accessible (albeit with at best limited access and some rather unacceptable delays) in some communities as women could claim to be suicidal and on this basis insist that continuation of the unwanted pregnancy represented an imminent danger to mental health.

In other TAC&#x27;s the law was interpreted much more closely, making it difficult to get an abortion in the hospital even if they did have a TAC.

In some cases, procedures required to protect a woman&#x27;s life were not available during pregnancy. A prime example would be cancer treatments such as chemotherapy which would do extensive and irreversible harm to an embryo or foetus if done during pregnancy but which, if not done in a timely fashion, can allow the cancer to spread to a point at which the condition is fatal and no longer successfully medically treatable.

These were the cases which the TAC&#x27;s were originally intended to address, but many hospitals were unwilling to perform abortions at all.

===No requirement for hospitals to provide abortions===
Hospitals had therapeutic abortion committees only if they opted to provide abortions, and there was and is no requirement that they do so. As well, the requirement for three doctors to sit on a committee, in addition to the doctor who proposed to perform an abortion, meant that abortions were only available in hospitals where there were four doctors familiar with the procedure.

===Net effect of the law===
The end result was a very limited access to lawful abortion which varied widely from one town or province to another. Many towns and cities did not have any hospital that provided abortions.

==Supreme Court rules the provisions are unconstitutional==
In 1988, a case involving Morgentaler reached the Supreme Court of Canada. The court ruled that the provisions relating to abortion were contrary to section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Although there was no single majority judgment, the three judgments finding the provisions unconstitutional concluded that the delays and limited access to abortion inherent in the system of therapeutic abortion committees violated the right to security of the person of a woman seeking an abortion. The delays and limited access potentially had a profound impact on a woman&#x27;s health and thus infringed her rights to liberty and security of the person, contrary to section 7 of the Charter.

The court held that this section of the &quot;Criminal Code&quot; was unconstitutional and inoperative. The effect of the decision was that abortion was decriminalized in Canada.

==Senate rejects attempt to re-criminalize==
Following the Supreme Court decision, the Progressive Conservative government of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney explored legislative options in response to the decision. In 1990, a compromise bill, Bill C-34 passed the Commons. Similar to the previous requirement for approval by a TAC, it would have required the consent of one additional doctor, other than the one who proposed to perform the abortion. Although Bill C-34 passed the Commons, it was defeated in a tie vote in the Senate of Canada, marking the end of criminalisation of abortion in Canada.

<doc id="1035652" wikidata="Q3161096" url="?curid=1035652" title="James Gabriel (politician)">
<text>James Gabriel (Mohawk) is a politician, a former chief of Kanesatake, a First Nations settlement within the boundaries of the city of Oka, Quebec. He was elected three times as Grand Chief, serving from 1995 to 2004. His tenure in office was controversial, marked by bitter divisions between his supporters and opponents that resulted in violence in January 2004.

==Early life and education==
James Gabriel was born to a European-Canadian mother and Mohawk father. Under the matrilineal kinship system at Kanesatake, children are traditionally considered to be born into the mother&#x27;s clan, so Gabriel did not have a formal kinship relationship through his mother with the community. He grew up at Kanesatake, and both he and his father are registered as members of the community. He grew up bilingual in French and English. (In a 2004 article, Benoit Aubin suggested that such differences between maternal ancestries was part of the divide in the Nation between modernists like Gabriel and traditionalists like Steven Bonspille, John Harding (Sha ko hen the tha), and Pearl Bonspille, his opponents on the chiefs&#x27; council in the early 2000s, after he was re-elected as Grand Chief.)

==Cultural context==
In 1991, following the lengthy Oka Crisis, which brought federal troops to the community, the 1700 members of Kanesatake changed their means of selecting leaders. Until then the people had continued their traditional selection of chiefs by clan mothers, from those persons with hereditary rights to the position. Inheritance and property was passed through the maternal line. Clan mothers could remove chiefs of whom they disapproved.

In 1991, the Nation conducted its first popular elections to choose persons as chiefs for the six-person council and as Grand Chief. Jerry Peltier was the first to be popularly elected as Grand Chief. A number of issues have increased political competition in the community.

==Career==
Gabriel became active in tribal politics during and after the Oka crisis. He was first elected as grand chief in 1995, succeeding Peltier. He was elected three times, serving into 2004. By his last term in office, the six-person chiefs&#x27; council was evenly split among opponents and supporters.

Gabriel was concerned that increases in the sales of contraband cigarettes, were becoming an avenue of the drug trade and organized crime in Kanesatake. In an interview he said, &quot;When tax rollbacks killed the cigarette trade, they recycled into booze, drugs, weapons, illegal immigrants, anything with a cash value.&quot;

Critics suggest he and supporters unjustly branded several community members as criminals. Gabriel agreed with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) that the community&#x27;s tobacco stores (in which contraband cigarettes of disputed origin were sold tax-free to non-natives) should be removed from the community. Opposing council members and community members, largely traditionalists, disputed this conclusion, as well as other positions of Gabriel.

In a 2001 referendum, 61% of Kanesatake voters approved removal of Gabriel from office. He kept his position following a court&#x27;s ruling in his favor, which determined that the referendum was not the means to end his tenure. The reasons for Gabriel&#x27;s unpopularity in this period are disputed. His supporters in 2003-04 claim that he lost popularity by not adequately confronting organized crime, while his opponents claim his unpopularity resulted from his promotion of bill S-24 (see below), which changed conditions for the settlement in relation to other levels of government.

===Outsourcing control of finances===
In 2002, Gabriel allowed the federal government to hire the private firm of PriceWaterhouseCoopers to audit and assume control over the band&#x27;s finances. (He claimed the decision was necessary in light of the $1.2 million deficit). Numerous questions were raised by a later audit, but accusations that Gabriel had defrauded the community were not supported.

==Policing and conflict==
In late 2003, Gabriel arranged with Canada&#x27;s Indian Affairs Department for an emergency loan of $900,000 to the community&#x27;s police force. He secretly hired aboriginal policemen from other reserves as special forces for an anti-crime, drug raid. Opponents believed Gabriel intended to use these officers against the local cigarette dealers. (He informed his supporters on the band council about the planned actions, but not the three council members who opposed him.)

On January 12, 2004, Gabriel bypassed the Kanesatake Police Commission and led a force of 67 police officers to the local police station to take control. (The community&#x27;s police chief, Tracy Cross, was not a supporter of Gabriel and opposed these actions). Many local residents resisted this effort, and a standoff resulted, with 200 people surrounding the station and hired forces inside.

Gabriel&#x27;s allies requested assistance from the Sûreté du Québec (SQ). In 1990 the provincial police had been involved in the prolonged 78-day Oka standoff and were not eager to return to this First Nation&#x27;s internal politics. Fearing renewed violence, the provincial authorities refused to send in the SQ. They negotiated an agreement by which the private forces were given safe passage out of the community. On the same night, Gabriel&#x27;s house and car were burned down but no one was there or injured. Other protests and violence broke out across the community. The grand chief took his family to safety in the neighbouring community of Laval.

Disputes continued through 2004 over the leadership of the Kanesatake police force. An interim director was appointed but his power was limited to Mohawk who lived outside Kanesatake in nearby Oka. Leadership of the police was contested. Gabriel&#x27;s status in the community was a matter of controversy in 2004-05. Some believe he was legitimately removed as Grand Chief in January 2004, while others (in and out of the community) rejected this interpretation. 
In early June 2005 the Sûreté du Québec Command testified to their understanding that the tobacco/drug raid was intended to replace both Police Chief Cross and the Police Commission. The S.Q. and RCMP Command had both argued with Gabriel against conducting the raid. They testified that it was poorly planned and that Gabriel relied on dubious evidence in his decisionmaking.

Gabriel was defeated for the position of grand chief by opponent Steven Bonspille in the June 26, 2005 elections, losing with 344 votes to Bonspille&#x27;s 375. The six band council chiefs elected were a slate of Gabriel supporters, and resulted in a new council. Their political differences resulted in difficult governance. He declined to run for re-election after his first term.

Some aboriginal groups in Canada, including the powerful Assembly of First Nations, have openly sided with Gabriel in this dispute, as has the &quot;Parti Québécois&quot;. Gabriel&#x27;s supporters believe that the provincial government capitulated to organized crime at Kanesatake in early 2004 by allowing him to be driven from the community. His opponents argue that his rule over the community was heavy-handed and arbitrary. They said his efforts to stop the contraband cigarette trade were an intrusion into accepted community practices.

==S-24==
Gabriel helped to negotiate the passage of S-24, a federal bill which, according to its backers, was meant to clarify the Kanesatake community&#x27;s relationship to the federal government. Because Kanesatake is not a &quot;reserve&quot; but a &quot;settlement&quot;, it has not been subject to the provisions of Canada&#x27;s Indian Act. Opponents of S-24 believe that the bill was intended to reduce the community&#x27;s autonomy.

A community referendum narrowly passed the bill by two votes. Many residents boycotted the electoral process entirely. Some believed Gabriel intended to convert Kanesatake into a municipality under Canada law. Such action would have increased the powers of the federal and provincial governments over the community.

<text>Robert Byron Hardy (born 16 August 1980) is an English musician and the bassist in the band Franz Ferdinand.

==Biography==
Hardy grew up in the outskirts of Bradford and attended Bradford Grammar School. Hardy is an artist with an interest in music while friend and bandmate Alex Kapranos is a musician interested in art; this is one of the primary reasons for how their friendship was established. Through Hardy&#x27;s friends from the Glasgow School of Art, Kapranos developed an interest in the work of the Dadaists and the Russian Constructivists. Many of the earlier shows of the band would come about thanks to the band&#x27;s art world contacts.

Hardy is a painter, vegan and safety campaigner.

==Equipment==
Hardy plays a 1974 and a 1978 Rickenbacker 4001s / Hagström / Fender Precision. He previously used an SWR Goliath bass cabinet but now uses an Ampeg SVT Pro head and Ampeg 8x10 cabs. He uses Ernie Ball strings – roundwounds, medium gauge. His plectrum is a custom .60 mm magnesium/teflon amalgam.

<text>Ali Curtis (born December 18, 1978) is a sports executive and former American soccer player. He was the 1999 Hermann Trophy and 2000 MAC Award winner before playing in Major League Soccer from 2001 to 2004. Curtis became the first African American General Manager in Major League Soccer&#x27;s history when he joined the New York Red Bulls in 2014. He was most recently the General Manager of Toronto FC.

==Career==

===College===
A native of Ann Arbor, MI, Ali Curtis had an extraordinary career playing college soccer at Duke University, where he scored 53 goals and 28 assists from 1997 to 2000, and, in his junior season won the Hermann Trophy, and in his senior season won the MAC Award, both recognizing college soccer&#x27;s best player. He ranks as the all-time leading goal-scorer in Duke soccer history.

===MLS===
After graduating from Duke, Curtis was drafted second overall in the 2001 MLS SuperDraft by the Tampa Bay Mutiny. From 2001 through 2004, Curtis spent time with three MLS Clubs - Tampa Bay Mutiny, D.C. United and FC Dallas (formerly Dallas Burn).

==Post-playing career==
During college, Curtis studied finance and worked on Wall Street in the summer. After Curtis&#x27;s playing career, he worked for the investment bank JP Morgan from 2004 through 2007. He worked in JP Morgan&#x27;s Chicago and Los Angeles offices. In 2007, Curtis returned to MLS and held various positions in the league office, and was eventually appointed the league&#x27;s Senior Director of Player Relations and Competition.

On December 23, 2014, the New York Red Bulls hired Curtis to replace Andy Roxburgh as the club&#x27;s sporting director. In his first season in charge New York captured the Eastern Conference regular season title and the MLS Supporters&#x27; Shield. After another winning season in 2016, Curtis left the Red Bull organization shortly before the 2017 season. During his tenure at Red Bull, Curtis achieved success in multiple areas - player signings (Tyler Adams, Kemar Lawrence, Aaron Long, etc.), player transfers (Matt Miazga/Chelsea FC), player development (USL Champion).

On 4 January 2019, Curtis was named the general manager of Toronto FC. Toronto FC finished the 2021 MLS season in second-last place, and on November 22, 2021, Curtis left his post as general manager. Curtis&#x27; final season at TFC was seen as largely disappointing, defined by the hiring of Chris Armas who was terminated only 171 days after his appointment, and a controversial off-field incident which saw Toronto FC striker Jozy Altidore exiled from the club for 2 months.

===Personal life===
Curtis is married to a marketing executive who works for Creative Artist Agency. He and his wife have two children.

<text>Paul Robert Thomson (born 15 September 1976) is a Scottish musician who was the drummer for the Glasgow-based band Franz Ferdinand from their formation in 2002 until October 2021.

== Biography ==
Thomson has always been interested in music, able to play various instruments such as guitar, keyboard and bass guitar in addition to the drums.

During the late 1990s, he was drummer of The Yummy Fur and was at one point part of The Purple Bajengas and Pro Forma. It was in The Yummy Fur that Thomson would meet Alex Kapranos. When The Yummy Fur broke up, Thomson had various odd jobs DJing and working as a nude model at the Glasgow School of Art. He is also the drummer in the Glasgow band Amor, with Luke Fowler, Richard Youngs and Michael Francis Duch.

In 2001, Thomson joined Franz Ferdinand, originally playing guitar. He later switched to drums. He also does backing vocals, and sang lead on the German version of &quot;Tell Her Tonight&quot; from B-side of the &quot;Michael&quot; single. The English version is from &quot;Franz Ferdinand&quot;.

His record label, NEW! (which started in 2005), only releases material on vinyl records.

Thomson resided in Glasgow with his now ex-wife Esther (DJ and lead singer of Cash Machine). Together they DJ&#x27;d as Polyester (Paul and Esther). They had a baby boy named Georgie in July 2006, and on 19 September 2008 (while Franz Ferdinand were supposed to be headlining a concert) they had another boy and named him Ronnie. Because of Thomson&#x27;s absence, Franz Ferdinand played a semi-acoustic set and swapped the headlining spot with The Ting Tings. Thomson also has a show on Subcity Radio called &quot;they&#x27;re only records paul&quot; which runs fortnightly on Thursdays.

In June 2008, it was announced that Thomson was now endorsing Highwood Drums, a UK custom company becoming a Highwood artist.

Thomson is the son of Bert and Ellen Thomson. He has one sister, Hazel. In 2009, he was voted Scotland&#x27;s Greatest Ever Drummer by the readers of Dear Scotland.

In October 2021, the band announced on Twitter that Thomson would be leaving Franz Ferdinand after 20 years. The announcement was accompanied by a statement by Thomson and a photograph of him passing his drumsticks to his replacement, Audrey Tait.

<doc id="1035677" wikidata="Q658334" url="?curid=1035677" title="Barcarolle">
<text>A barcarolle ( ; from French, also barcarole; originally, Italian barcarola or barcaruola, from &#x27;boat&#x27;) is a traditional folk song sung by Venetian gondoliers, or a piece of music composed in that style. In classical music, two of the most famous barcarolles are Jacques Offenbach&#x27;s &quot;Belle nuit, ô nuit d&#x27;amour&quot;, from his opera &quot;The Tales of Hoffmann&quot;; and Frédéric Chopin&#x27;s Barcarolle in F-sharp major for solo piano.

==Description==

A barcarolle is characterized by a rhythm reminiscent of the gondolier&#x27;s stroke, almost invariably in metre at a moderate tempo.

While the most-famous barcarolles are from the Romantic period, the genre was known well enough in the 18th century for Burney to mention, in &quot;The Present State of Music in France and Italy&quot; (1771), that it was a celebrated form cherished by &quot;collectors of good taste&quot;.

==Notable examples==
The barcarolle was a popular form in opera, where the apparently artless sentimental style of the folklike song could be put to good use. In addition to the Offenbach example: Paisiello, Weber, and Rossini wrote arias that were barcarolles; Donizetti set the Venetian scene at the opening of &quot;Marino Faliero&quot; (1835) with a barcarolle for a gondolier and chorus; and Verdi included a barcarolle in &quot;Un ballo in maschera&quot; (i.e., Richard&#x27;s atmospheric &quot;Di’ tu se fidele il flutto m’aspetta&quot; in Act I). The traditional Neapolitan barcarolle &quot;Santa Lucia&quot; was published in 1849. The 32nd Sultan of the Ottoman Empire, Sultan Abdulaziz (1830–1876), also composed a barcarolle, entitled &quot;La Gondole Barcarolle&quot;.

Arthur Sullivan set the entry of Sir Joseph Porter&#x27;s barge (also bearing his sisters, cousins and aunts) in &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot; to a barcarolle, as well as the Trio &quot;My well-loved lord and guardian dear&quot; among Phyllis, Earl Tolloller and the Earl of Mountararat in Act I of &quot;Iolanthe&quot;. Schubert, while not using the name specifically, used a style reminiscent of the barcarolle in some of his most famous songs, including especially his haunting &quot;Auf dem Wasser zu singen&quot; (&quot;To be sung on the water&quot;), D.774.

Other notable barcarolles include: the second movement of Ludwig van Beethoven’s Piano Sonata in G, Opus 79; the three &quot;Venetian Gondola Songs&quot; from Mendelssohn&#x27;s &quot;Songs Without Words&quot;, Opp. 19, 30 and 62; the &quot;June&quot; barcarolle from Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;The Seasons&quot;; Charles-Valentin Alkan&#x27;s Barcarolles from his chants, Opp. 38a, 38b, 65, 67, and 70; Camille Saint-Saëns&#x27;s Barcarolle for violin, cello, harmonium (or organ) and piano; Béla Bartók&#x27;s &quot;Barcarolla&quot; from &quot;Out of Doors&quot;; Barcarolle, Op. 27, no. 1, by Moritz Moszkowski, and several examples by Anton Rubinstein, Mily Balakirev, Alexander Glazunov, Edward MacDowell, Mel Bonis, Ethelbert Nevin; and a series of thirteen for solo piano by Gabriel Fauré.

In the 20th century, further examples include: Agustín Barrios&#x27;s &quot;Julia Florida&quot;; the second movement of Villa-Lobos&#x27;s Trio No. 2 (1915) (which contains a Berceuse-Barcarolla); the first movement of Francis Poulenc&#x27;s &quot;Napoli&quot; suite for solo piano (1925); George Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Dance of the Waves&quot; (1937, unpublished); Ned Rorem&#x27;s three Barcarolles for piano, composed in Morocco (1949); the Barcarolle from Gian-Carlo Menotti&#x27;s ballet &quot;Sebastian&quot;; the first movement of Nikolai Myaskovsky&#x27;s Piano Sonata no. 8, op. 83 (1949); &quot;Hello Young Lovers&quot; from Richard Rodgers&#x27; &quot;The King and I&quot; (1951); &quot;The Kings&#x27; Barcarolle&quot; from Leonard Bernstein&#x27;s &quot;Candide&quot; (1956); and Juan María Solare&#x27;s neoclassical &quot;Barcarola&quot; for piano (recording included in the album Sombras blancas). Dominick Argento&#x27;s 25-minute choral cycle &quot;Walden Pond&quot; (1996) is subtitled &quot;Nocturnes and Barcarolles for Mixed Chorus&quot;; the five-movement work makes extensive use of meter. The penultimate movement of Arnold Schoenberg&#x27;s Pierrot lunaire, &quot;Heimfahrt&quot;, is also labelled a barcarolle. Stephen Sondheim uses a barcarolle for the two princes&#x27; song &quot;Agony&quot; from his 1986 musical Into the Woods.

Bob Dylan’s song &quot;I&#x27;ve Made Up My Mind to Give Myself to You&quot; from his 2020 album &quot;Rough and Rowdy Ways&quot; uses Offenbach’s &quot;Barcarolle&quot; as a riff.

<text>The Établissements aéronautiques Roger Adam (Roger Adam Aeronautical Establishments) was a company that produced light aircraft in kit in France between 1948 and 1955 intended for amateur construction. The company was found by French engineer Roger Adam who was also the designer. One of their aircraft, the Adam RA-14 Loisirs became a real success. Around forty were built in France and the designs were sold in 1957 to the Canadian Maranda Aircraft Company which distributed them in North America where around thirty RA14BM1s were built.

<text>A is &quot;a musical composition usually in time that resembles a lullaby&quot;. Otherwise it is typically in triple meter. Tonally most berceuses are simple, often merely alternating tonic and dominant harmonies; since the intended effect is to put a baby to sleep, wild chromaticism would be somewhat inappropriate. Another characteristic of the &quot;berceuse&quot;, for no reason other than convention, is a tendency to stay on the &quot;flat side&quot;; noted examples including the berceuses by Chopin, who pioneered the form, Liszt, and Balakirev, which are all in D.

<text>James La Rue Avery (November 27, 1945 – December 31, 2013) was an American actor. He was best known for his roles as Philip Banks in &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot;, Judge Michael Conover on &quot;L.A. Law&quot;, Steve Yeager in &quot;The Brady Bunch Movie&quot;, and Dr. Crippen on &quot;The Closer&quot; (2005–2007); and as the voice actor for Shredder in &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; and Haroud Hazi Bin in &quot;Aladdin.&quot;

==Early life==
Avery was born on November 27, 1945, in Pughsville, Virginia (present-day Suffolk, Virginia), to mother Florence J. Avery. His father denied paternity and was not listed on his birth certificate. Florence would later move a teenaged James to Atlantic City, New Jersey, where he attended Atlantic City High School. He served in the U.S. Navy in the Vietnam War from 1968 to 1969, and eventually moved to San Diego, California, where he began to write poetry and TV scripts for PBS. He won an Emmy for production during his tenure there, and then received a scholarship to UC San Diego, where he attended Thurgood Marshall College (then Third College), earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in drama and literature in 1976.

==Career==
Avery began his career in the 1980s with appearances in television series such as NBC&#x27;s &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot;, Showtime sitcom &quot;Brothers&quot; as Bubba Dean, &quot;Amen&quot;, &quot;FM&quot; and &quot;L.A. Law&quot;. In the 1990s, he achieved prominence for his role as Philip Banks in &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot;, a character that was ranked number 34 in &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s &quot;50 Greatest TV Dads of All Time&quot;. After &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot; ended, he played the lead role of Alonzo Sparks in the UPN comedy series &quot;Sparks&quot; that lasted for two seasons. Other notable roles in television included Dr. Crippen in &quot;The Closer&quot;, Charles Haysbert in &quot;The Division&quot;, and Michael Kelso&#x27;s commanding officer at the police academy late in the series run of &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot;.

Among his most notable voice credits are the voices of Shredder in the first &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; animated series, Br&#x27;er Bear in the Disney World version of Splash Mountain and and James Rhodes/War Machine in the 1990s &quot;Iron Man&quot; series. He also lent his powerful bass voice as Junkyard Dog in &quot;Hulk Hogan&#x27;s Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Wrestling&quot; (1985–1986), Turbo in &quot;Rambo and the Forces of Freedom&quot; (1986), and Haroud Hazi Bin in &quot;Aladdin&quot; (1994).

Avery was the commencement speaker for his alma mater, UC San Diego&#x27;s Thurgood Marshall College, in 2007 and again in 2012.

==Personal life==
In 1988, Avery married his girlfriend Barbara. Barbara was later dean of student life at Loyola Marymount University. He had no biological children, but was a stepfather to Barbara&#x27;s son, Kevin Waters.

==Death, tributes and legacy==
On December 31, 2013, Avery died at the age of 68 at Glendale Memorial Medical Center. His publicist, Cynthia Snyder, told the Associated Press that Avery died following complications from open heart surgery.

Janet Hubert, who portrayed his on-screen wife Vivian on &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot; for the first three seasons, said after his death: &quot;RIP James, all the world is a stage, and we are all merely players in this production called LIFE.&quot; Will Smith commented on Avery&#x27;s death, saying: &quot;Some of my greatest lessons in acting, living, and being a respectable human being came through James Avery. Every young man needs an Uncle Phil. Rest in peace.&quot; Alfonso Ribeiro, who played Avery&#x27;s on-screen son Carlton said, “I&#x27;m deeply saddened to say that James Avery has passed away. He was a second father to me. I will miss him greatly&quot;. Joseph Marcell (Geoffrey) called Avery a &quot;gentle giant&quot;.

Avery&#x27;s remains were cremated and scattered near the Pacific Ocean. In April 2020, Will Smith reunited with the cast of &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot; on a video conference honoring Avery&#x27;s best moments on the show.

==AveryFest==
 AveryFest is an annual African-American cultural and music festival held in the United States. The event, named in honor of James Avery, had its inaugural event September 2, 2023 in Avery&#x27;s hometown of Suffolk, Virginia. The event will be held at Bennett&#x27;s Creek Park each year, only minutes away from the Pughsville neighborhood where Avery was born.

In 2023, the first year of the festival included special guest appearances from Avery&#x27;s wife, Barbara Avery, his TV wife from &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot;, actress Daphne Maxwell Reid, and a special jazz spotlight in memory of Avery, who loved jazz music.

<text>Kanał (, &quot;Sewer&quot;) is a 1957 Polish film directed by Andrzej Wajda. It was the first film made about the 1944 Warsaw Uprising, telling the story of a company of Home Army resistance fighters escaping the Nazi onslaught through the city&#x27;s sewers. The film is adapted from the story “They Loved Life” by Jerzy Stefan Stawinski. &quot;Kanał&quot; is the second film of Wajda&#x27;s War Trilogy, preceded by &quot;A Generation&quot; and followed by &quot;Ashes and Diamonds&quot;.

The film was the winner of the Special Jury Award at the 1957 Cannes Film Festival.

==Plot==
It is 25 September 1944, during the last days of the Warsaw Uprising. Lieutenant Zadra leads a unit of 43 soldiers and civilians to a new position amidst the ruins of the now isolated southern Mokotów district of Warsaw.

The composer Michał manages to telephone his wife and child in another part of the city that is being overrun by the Germans. After a few words, she tells him that the Germans are clearing the building and that they are coming for her. Then the line goes dead. The next morning, 23-year-old Officer Cadet Korab apologizes after walking into a room to find the second in command, Lieutenant Mądry, and messenger girl Halinka in bed together (Halinka later reveals that Mądry is her first lover). A German attack is stopped, but Korab is wounded while disabling a Goliath tracked mine.

Surrounded by the enemy, Zadra is ordered to retreat through the sewers to the city centre. Now down to 27 fit to travel, including Korab, they slog through the filth.

Daisy, their guide, asks Zadra to let her help Korab, claiming that the others can find their way easily enough. Zadra consents. However, the pair fall further and further behind. When they reach the designated exit at Wilcza Street, Korab is too weak to climb the upward sloping tunnel, so they rest for a while. He notices some graffiti on the opposite wall, but cannot quite make it out. Daisy tells him it says &quot;I love Janek&quot;, when the name is actually Jacek, Korab&#x27;s first name. She decides that they should head in the direction of the river, which is only a short distance away and drives him on, not letting him stop. Finally, they see sunlight. By this time, Korab is half blind and at the end of his strength. He cannot see that the exit is closed off by metal bars. Daisy finally reveals her feelings for him, kissing him before telling him that he can rest for a while.

The main group follows Zadra for a while, but they become lost without Daisy. Finally, when Zadra tells Sergeant Kula to order them onward after a brief rest, they remain where they are. Kula lies and tells Zadra they are following in order to get him to keep going. Eventually, the only remaining soldier following Zadra and Kula is the mechanic Smukły.

Meanwhile, Mądry, Halinka and Michał are also lost. Eventually, Michał loses his mind and wanders away, playing an ocarina. Upon reaching a dead end, Mądry cries out that he has somebody to live for. When Halinka asks who, he tells her that he has a wife and child. She asks him to turn off his flashlight, and then shoots herself. Mądry finds an exit, but as soon as he has climbed out of the sewer he is disarmed by a German soldier and placed into the courtyard along with others who have come through the same manhole. Despondent, he kneels beside the bodies of others who have already been executed.

Zadra, Kula and Smukły miss the exit at Wilcza Street but find another - however it is booby trapped. Smukły disarms two German grenades, but is killed by the third and last. Zadra and Kula emerge from the sewer to find themselves in a deserted part of the ruined city. When Zadra tells Kula to bring up the rest of the men, Kula admits he lied and that they left them behind a long time ago. Enraged, Zadra shoots Kula and reluctantly heads back down into the sewer to search for his men.

==Production==

The story and script were written by Jerzy Stefan Stawiński who himself survived in the sewers as an officer of Armia Krajowa (the Polish underground resistance Home Army) during the Warsaw Uprising of August 1944.

The film was produced by Zespół Filmowy &quot;Kadr&quot; at Wytwornia Filmow Fabularnych (Feature Film Studio) in Łódź, Poland.

&quot;Kanal&quot; premiered in Warsaw on April 20, 1957.

==Releases==

&quot;Kanał&quot; earned Wajda the Special Jury Prize at the 1957 Cannes Film Festival. The film is largely free of the overt communist propaganda that characterised its predecessor, &quot;A Generation&quot;. It was released after the fall of the Stalinist regime of Bolesław Bierut, which followed the death of Joseph Stalin.

In April 2019, a restored version of the film was selected to be shown in the Cannes Classics section at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival.

==Reception==

While Wajda’s debut film &quot;A Generation&quot; (1955) received a measured critical response, &quot;Kanal&quot; provoked widespread controversy and debate among Poles as to its merits. Donota Niemitz and Stefan Steinberg remark that “the film was not received favorably in Poland. The futile death of the uprising’s heroes, covered in dirt and excrement, did not correspond to the idealized picture of the nation’s martyrs.” Critic Leon Buko in &quot;Dziennik polski&quot; complained “This whole Warsaw, this whole Rising wallows in filth, in the gutters of history…”
, of the &quot;Trybuna Ludu&quot; wrote:

Biographer Boleslaw Michalek adds that Jackiewicz placed emphasis on the skeptical note in the film, its confrontation with the legend of the Warsaw Rising, and by and large this was how reviewers hailed &quot;Kanal&quot; as a landmark in Polish cinema.”

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 100% based on , with a weighted average rating of 8.1/10.

==Theme==

One of the principal themes in &quot;Kanał&quot; is “Polish heroism” and the notion that Poles have historically been prone to “acts of courage as futile as they [were] desperate.” Wajda initially considered referencing some celebrated - and semi-suicidal - cavalry charges in Polish history, including those during the Napoleonic era’s Battle of Samosierra, the Charge of Rokitna in WWI and the legend of the Charge at Krojanty, reputedly on German tanks in 1939. These were to be presented in a pre-credit sequence of but ultimately were abandoned.
Biographer Bolesław Michałek observes:

Historic manifestations of “romanticism and heroism” were deemed anachronistic in post-war Poland and challenged by appeals to “reason” and “political common sense.” Despite these political exposures, Wajda’s romantic, sensual style endows the characters in &quot;Kanał&quot; with “heroic dimensions.”

The descent into the sewers has been compared to Dante’s depiction of the souls damned in his Inferno, and acknowledged as such by Wajda. Biographer Bolesław Michałek writes:

==Political assessment==

The historical subject that Wajda addressed in &quot;Kanal&quot; was one of the most politically and socially charged topics in post-war Poland. Like the other films in his war trilogy, &quot;Kanal&quot; was “an honest and valuable attempt to portray the complexity of Polish contemporary history and politics.” The film “masterfully” dramatizes the tragic fate of the men and women of a small unit of Polish Home Army resistance fighters. Biographer Bolestaw Michalek provides the context:

Michalek adds that “Wajda’s treatment of the Warsaw Rising and the retreat through the sewers had a definite and deliberate historical and social edge.”

By the mid-1950s, two fundamental perceptions had become established among Poles regarding the event. One was a popular romantic image of gallant young martyrs who died defending the homeland. The second was official skepticism as to the purity of the high-command’s motives in committing men and women patriots to a doomed endeavor.

Wajda, responding to these dual social outlooks, attempted to synthesis these in &quot;Kanal&quot;. Polish critic commented on the contrasting “heroic dimensions” of the characters in Kanal and the “latent skepticism” concerning the 1944 uprising:

Wajda also managed to address the controversial topic of the lack of Soviet Union support for the Polish Home Army partisans, particularly in the Warsaw Uprising. The topic was not allowed to be openly discussed in communist Poland, where censors would remove such discussion, but &quot;they could not censor the silence&quot;, in the context of the movie scene where some civilians, hidden in the canals, await aid from the advancing Red Army, but instead notice the sudden silence, as the Russian artillery stops firing - an implied reference to the abandonment of the inconvenient Polish partisans by the Soviets.

<doc id="1035712" wikidata="Q1137258" url="?curid=1035712" title="Counts per minute">
<text>The measurement of ionizing radiation is sometimes expressed as being a &quot;rate&quot; of counts per unit time as registered by a radiation monitoring instrument, for which counts per minute (cpm) and counts per second (cps) are commonly used quantities.

Count rate measurements are associated with the detection of particles, such as alpha particles and beta particles. However, for gamma ray and X-ray dose measurements a unit such as the sievert is normally used.

Both cpm and cps are the rate of detection events registered by the measuring instrument, not the rate of emission from the source of radiation. For radioactive decay measurements it must not be confused with disintegrations per unit time (dpm), which represents the rate of atomic disintegration events at the source of the radiation.
==Count rates==

The count rates of cps and cpm are generally accepted and convenient practical rate measurements. They are not SI units, but are &quot;de facto&quot; radiological units of measure in widespread use.

Counts per minute (abbreviated to cpm) is a measure of the detection rate of ionization events per minute. Counts are only manifested in the reading of the measuring instrument, and are not an absolute measure of the strength of the source of radiation. Whilst an instrument will display a rate of cpm, it does not have to detect counts for one minute, as it can infer the total per minute from a smaller sampling period.

Counts per second (abbreviated to cps) is used for measurements when higher count rates are being encountered, or if hand held radiation survey instruments are being used which can be subject to rapid changes of count rate when the instrument is moved over a source of radiation in a survey area.

==Conversion to dose rate==
Count rate does not universally equate to dose rate, and there is no simple universal conversion factor. Any conversions are instrument-specific.

Counts is the number of events detected, but dose rate relates to the amount of ionising energy &quot;deposited&quot; in the sensor of the radiation detector. The conversion calculation is dependent on the radiation energy levels, the type of radiation being detected and the radiometric characteristic of the detector.

The continuous current ion chamber instrument can easily measure dose but cannot measure counts. However the Geiger counter can measure counts but not the energy of the radiation, so a technique known as energy compensation of the detector tube is used to produce a dose reading. This modifies the tube characteristic so each count resulting from a particular radiation type is equivalent to a specific quantity of deposited dose.

More can be found on radiation dose and dose rate at absorbed dose and equivalent dose.

==Count rates versus disintegration rates==

Disintegrations per minute (dpm) and disintegrations per second (dps) are measures of the activity of the source of radioactivity. The SI unit of radioactivity, the becquerel (Bq), is equivalent to one disintegration per second. This unit should not be confused with cps, which is the number of counts received by an instrument from the source. The quantity dps (dpm) is the number of atoms that have decayed in one second (one minute), not the number of atoms that have been measured as decayed.

The efficiency of the radiation detector and its relative position to the source of radiation must be accounted for when relating cpm to dpm. This is known as the counting efficiency. The factors affecting counting efficiency are shown in the accompanying diagram.

==Surface emission rate==
The surface emission rate (SER) is used as a measure of the rate of particles emitted from a radioactive source which is being used as a calibration standard. When the source is of plate or planar construction and the radiation of interest is emitting from one face, it is known as &quot;formula_1 emission&quot;. When the emissions are from a &quot;point source&quot; and the radiation of interest is emitting from all faces, it is known as &quot;formula_2 emission&quot;. These terms correspond to the spherical geometry over which the emissions are being measured.

The SER is the measured emission rate from the source and is related to, but different from, the source activity. This relationship is affected by the type of radiation being emitted and the physical nature of the radioactive source. Sources with formula_2 emissions will nearly always have a lower SER than the Bq activity due to self-shielding within the active layer of the source. Sources with formula_1 emissions suffer from self-shielding or backscatter, so the SER is variable, and individually can be greater than or less than 50% of the Bq activity, depending on construction and the particle types being measured. Backscatter will reflect particles off the backing plate of the active layer and will increase the rate; beta particle plate sources usually have a significant backscatter, whereas alpha plate sources usually have no backscatter. However alpha particles are easily attenuated if the active layer is made too thick. The SER is established by measurement using calibrated equipment, normally traceable to a national standard source of radiation.

==Ratemeters and scalers==
In radiation protection practice, an instrument which reads a rate of detected events is normally known as a ratemeter, which was first developed by R D Robley Evans in 1939. This mode of operation provides real-time dynamic indication of the radiation rate, and the principle has found widespread application in radiation survey meters used in health physics.

An instrument which totalises the events detected over a time period is known as a scaler. This colloquial name comes from the early days of automatic radiation counting, when a pulse-dividing circuit was required to &quot;scale down&quot; a high count rate to a speed which mechanical counters could register. This technique was developed by C E Wynn-Williams at The Cavendish Laboratory and first published in 1932. The original counters used a cascade of &quot;Eccles-Jordan&quot; divide-by-two circuits, today known as flip flops. Early count readings were therefore binary numbers and had to be manually re-calculated into decimal values.

Later, with the development of electronic indicators, which started with the introduction of the Dekatron readout tube in the 1950s, and culminating in the modern digital indicator, totalised readings came to be directly indicated in decimal notation.

===SI Units for radioactive disintegration===
* One becquerel (Bq) is equal to one disintegration per second; 1 becquerel (Bq) is equal to 60 dpm.
* One curie (Ci) an old non-SI unit is equal to or dps, which is equal to .

<text>The boobam is a percussion instrument of the membranophone family consisting of an array of tubes with membranes stretched on one end, the other end open. The tuning depends partly on the tension on the membrane and partly on the length of the tube.

==History==
In 1948 Harry Partch, an American composer, developed a system of music that depended on the building of various instruments that could play non-tempered scales. Some of them were based on Greek models and some on more primitive instruments like marimbas. Musician David &quot;Buck&quot; Wheat and his roommate in Sausalito, California, Bill Loughborough, a musician and electronic engineer, assisted Partch in the development of his instruments. Around 1955-1956 Partch designed and built an instrument he called the &quot;boo&quot;, short for &quot;bamboo marimba&quot;. This instrument, a lamellophone, consisted of sections of bamboo with one end closed, and a tongue cut in the side, tuned to the same pitch as the resonating chamber of the stopped bamboo section. The instrument is played with felt-covered sticks, and has a very dry, short duration percussive tone, but with a particular pitch.

Buck Wheat and Loughborough then moved onto a Sausalito barge with Jak Simpson who in 1954 had founded a business named the &quot;BooBam Bamboo Drum Company&quot;. Experimenting further with Partch&#x27;s boo concept, they hit on the idea of covering the closed section of the bamboo tube with a small drum head, dispensing with the tongue, and playing on the membrane of the head, instead. The specific pitch of the drum could be tuned by changing the tension on the drum head, and adjusting the length of the bamboo tube until a resonator of the desired pitch was obtained. The name &quot;boobam&quot; was coined in Mill Valley, California in 1954 and was described as &quot;bamboo spelled sideways&quot;. Buck Wheat was employed as a bass player on a cruise liner at the time, and he would buy large diameter giant bamboo while in the Philippines, and bring back it back to the states.

While the resonating the tubes were originally made from lengths of giant bamboo, pipes of wood, plastic, metal, and cardboard have since also been used. The membranes were originally goat or calfskin but most are now synthetic (plastic) drumheads.

Jazz groups were fascinated by the instrument and added the boobams to their percussion sections. In 1956 Chet Baker&#x27;s Ensemble used them on the Today Show. Their unique sound inspired Nick Reynolds of The Kingston Trio who eagerly included them on their tour with his percussion solo being featured on &quot;O Ken Karanga&quot; on the album &quot;College Concert&quot; recorded at UCLA in 1962.

==Construction==
Boobams are essentially tuned bongos constructed with a shell of natural bamboo, ABS, plywood, or other suitable material. The available width and depth of the shell, which contributes to the desired pitch, originally limited by the size of available bamboo found typically in the tropical islands of the Pacific Ocean. With the adoption of wood, plastic and other synthetic materials, a modern boobam can be made to produce virtually any desired pitch. Sets featuring the pitches of one, two, or three octaves of the common 12-tet scale have become common, and are available from several makers.

Similar instruments appear as ethnic drums in the Pacific Islands, but the modern instrument found its way into current use through its appearance on numerous recordings in Hollywood beginning in the 1950s. Two sets of boobams were owned and used by West Coast jazz drummer Shelly Manne for numerous recording sessions in the Los Angeles studios.

<text>Claudius Afolabi Siffre (born 25 June 1945), better known as Labi Siffre ( ), is a British singer, songwriter and poet. Siffre released six albums from 1970 to 1975 and four from 1988 to 1998. His compositions include &quot;It Must Be Love&quot;, which reached number 14 on the UK Singles Chart in 1971 (and was later covered by the band Madness), &quot;Crying Laughing Loving Lying&quot;, and &quot;(Something Inside) So Strong&quot;—an anti-apartheid song inspired by a television documentary in which white soldiers in South Africa were filmed shooting at black civilians in the street—which hit number 4 on the UK chart. The latter song won Siffre the Ivor Novello Award for Best Song Musically and Lyrically from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors, and it has been used in Amnesty International campaigns.

Siffre has published essays, the stage and television play &quot;Deathwrite&quot; and three volumes of poetry: &quot;Nigger&quot;, &quot;Blood on the Page&quot;, and &quot;Monument&quot;. In 2022, his life and work was explored in the series &quot;Imagine&quot;, under the title, &quot;Labi Siffre: This Is My Song&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Claudius Afolabi Siffre was born in 1945 as the fourth of five children at Queen Charlotte&#x27;s and Chelsea Hospital in Hammersmith, London, to a British mother of white British and Afro-Barbadian descent and a British Nigerian father. Siffre was brought up in Bayswater and Hampstead and educated at a Catholic independent day school, St Benedict&#x27;s School, in Ealing, West London. Despite his Catholic education, Siffre has stated that he has always been an atheist.

Siffre studied music at the Eric Gilder School of Music in Wardour Street, Soho, London. Gilder is remembered with gratitude in Siffre&#x27;s poem &quot;education education education&quot;. After leaving school, Siffre worked as a taxi driver and a deliveryman, before deciding to concentrate on music.

Siffre played jazz guitar at Annie Ross&#x27;s jazz club in Soho, London, in the 1960s as part of a Hammond organ, guitar, drums house band.

He released six albums between 1970 and 1975. In the early 1970s, three of his singles became hits: &quot;It Must Be Love&quot; (No. 14, 1971, and performed the song on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;) (later covered by and a No. 4 hit for Madness, for which Siffre himself appeared in the video); &quot;Crying Laughing Loving Lying&quot; (No. 11, 1972); and &quot;Watch Me&quot; (No. 29, 1972). In 1978, Siffre took part in the heats to represent the UK in the Eurovision Song Contest. He performed &quot;Solid Love&quot;, co-written with Tom Shapiro, which placed fifth of the 12 songs up for consideration at the A Song for Europe contest. Additionally, he co-wrote the song &quot;We Got It Bad&quot;, performed by Bob James, which came in 10th.

Siffre came out of self-imposed retirement from music in 1985, when he saw a television film from Apartheid South Africa showing a white soldier shooting at black children. He wrote &quot;(Something Inside) So Strong&quot; (No. 4, 1987), which he also performed on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, and released four more albums between 1988 and 1998.

Multiple parts of Siffre&#x27;s 1975 track &quot;I Got The...&quot; were sampled in popular hip hop songs in the 1990s, most notably in the 1999 Eminem single &quot;My Name Is&quot;. As a result of the song&#x27;s newfound fame, it was finally released as a single in 2003. The track was also featured in the &quot;Better Call Saul&quot; episode &quot;Bagman&quot;.

Siffre&#x27;s 1972 track &quot;My Song&quot;, the 10th track on his album &quot;Crying Laughing Loving Lying&quot;, was sampled by rapper Kanye West on the song &quot;I Wonder&quot; on his third album &quot;Graduation&quot;.

In February 2022, the BBC broadcast &quot;Labi Siffre: This Is My Song&quot;, as part of the &quot;Imagine&quot; series, in which Alan Yentob presented a film exploring Siffre&#x27;s life and work.

==Personal life==
Siffre met his partner Peter Lloyd in July 1964 and they were together for 48 years. They entered into a civil partnership in 2005, as soon as it was legally possible in the UK. From the mid-1990s until Lloyd&#x27;s death in 2013, he and Siffre lived in a &quot;ménage à trois&quot; with Rudolf van Baardwijk in the village of Cwmdu, near Crickhowell, South Wales. Siffre and van Baardwijk married in December 2014. Van Baardwijk died in 2016. Siffre now lives in Spain.

In 2014, Siffre appeared on the BBC Radio 4 series &quot;Great Lives&quot;, championing the life of British author Arthur Ransome. Siffre said that Ransome&#x27;s &quot;Swallows and Amazons&quot; books had taught him responsibility for his own actions and also a morality that has influenced and shaped him throughout his life.

<doc id="1035732" wikidata="Q990982" url="?curid=1035732" title="Magnolia tripetala">
<text>Magnolia tripetala, commonly called umbrella magnolia or simply umbrella-tree, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States in the Appalachian Mountains, the Ozarks, and the Ouachita Mountains. The name &quot;umbrella tree&quot; derives from the fact that the large leaves are clustered at the tips of the branches forming an umbrella-shaped structure.

==Description==
Umbrella magnolias have large shiny leaves 30–50 cm long, spreading from stout stems. In a natural setting the umbrella magnolia can grow 15 m tall. The flowers are large, appear in the spring, malodorous, 15–25 cm diameter, with six to nine creamy-white tepals and a large red style, which later develops into a red fruit (an aril) 10 cm long, containing several red seeds. These trees are attractive and easy to grow. The leaves turn yellow in the autumn. The leaves are clustered at the tip of the stem with very short internodes. The tree has reddish cone-shaped fruit, is shade tolerant, has shallow spreading roots, and is pollinated by beetles.

Leaves on &quot;M. tripetala&quot; trees are alternate, simple, and oblong. They are a dark green on top and pale green underneath the leaves. These leaves are clustered at the ends of branches, giving them the appearance of an umbrella. The leaves and arrangement resemble their relative &quot;M. macrophylla&quot;. These trees are naturally in rich and moist woods, along slopes, streams and ravines. The bark is thin and gray, mostly smooth and can have raised lenticels. Trees typically grow from single stems, though multiple stems are not uncommon. The flowers on &quot;M. tripetala&quot; have been described to have unpleasant smells but are not toxic to organisms. These trees grow at a moderate rate during the spring season. 

== Taxonomy ==
The name &quot;M. tripetala&quot; was originally described by Linnaeus in his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; in 1759. It is most commonly known as the umbrella magnolia or the umbrella tree. Tripetala comes from Latin and means &quot;three petals&quot;. This naming convention was used for the three petal-like sepals of the tree&#x27;s flowers. &quot;Magnolia tripetala&quot; is the accepted name of the species but has gone through multiple authors naming the species differently. Synonyms for &quot;M. tripetala&quot; include &quot;Kobus tripetala, Magnolia frondosa, Magnolia umbrella, Magnolia virginiana var. tripetala,&quot; and &quot;Magnolia umbrella var. tripetala&quot;. 

== Distribution and habitat ==
Umbrella magnolias have a native range from New York state to southern Florida. This range also expands as far west as Arkansas and parts of Oklahoma. It is located in deciduous forests of the Appalachian Mountains. Research has shown the species to be non-native to northern states such as Pennsylvania, and only being a recent arrival. This species has been cultivated in locations outsides its natural range, and has spread from these locations to nearby woodlands. &quot;Magnolia tripetala&quot; has been observed in forests outside its native range in multiple instances. Single individuals and small populations have been observed near areas where &quot;M. tripetala&quot; is in cultivation. &quot;Magnolia tripetala&quot; has been given the FACU wetland status, tending to prefer average to dry soil. The trees have low tolerance to drought and fire.
==Reproduction== 
&quot;Magnolia tripetala&quot; in cultivation can produce low viability pollen (9.4-31.7%). Actual seed productivity of the &quot;M. tripetala&quot; is less than their potential productivity. However, &quot;M. tripetala&quot; are characterized by a high seed germination rates, up to 94%. Optimal seed germination conditions for &quot;M. tripetala&quot; are protected ground or a greenhouse and stratification at 4 °C for 30 days.

==Notable trees==
The largest known &quot;Magnolia tripetala&quot; is 15.2 m in height with a trunk diameter of 87 cm in Bucks County, Pennsylvania.

==Uses==
&quot;Magnolia tripetala&quot; contains a substance called ethyl acetate in its branches, and this substance displays nematicidal activity. This activity allows it to specifically resist &quot;Bursaphelenchus xylophilus&quot;, &quot;Panagrellus redivivus&quot;, and &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot;.

&quot;Magnolia tripetala&quot; has been used as a parent with &quot;Magnolia obovata&quot; (Japanese cucumber tree), resulting in the hybrid &quot;Magnolia x pruhoniciana&quot;, an ornamental plant. The species is named for the park for which it was first discovered, Prühonice Park in the Czech Republic. The hybrid has resulted in multiple hybrid variants, including the named &#x27;Silk Road&#x27; and &#x27;Silver Parasol&#x27; cultivars. The variants are described to be deciduous, medium trees with elliptic to ovate leaves. The leaves are 20-45cm by 10-22cm and the flowers are white, 16-25cm across at the end of branches. The cultivars have fruits with features such as number of follicles or stamen scars that are intermediate between the parent species.

Umbrella magnolia leaves are eaten by a variety of animals. They often grow under the canopy of larger trees and support biodiversity in forested areas. These trees are notably used as specimen trees for their unique foliage. &quot;Magnolia tripetala&quot; is used as an ornamental in urban areas and used as focal trees in the garden setting.

== Diseases ==
Umbrella magnolias are victim to pests such as magnolia scales or yellow poplar weevils. Magnolia scales infest and slowly kill branches of many trees, including species of magnolias. Yellow poplar weevils infest the leaves of magnolias and can cause mortality.

== Conservation ==
&quot;Magnolia tripetala&quot; has a secure conservation status across multiple states in most of its native range. However there are multiple states where the tree is considered critically imperiled or exotic. Many states within the native range of &quot;M. tripetala&quot; have not assessed its endangerment status. States where there is no status ranking (SNR/SU/SNA) for &quot;M. tripetala&quot; include Missouri, Arkansas, Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, Massachusetts, and Connecticut. States where the tree is considered secure (S5) include North Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia, and Kentucky. &quot;Magnolia tripetala&quot; is critically imperiled (S1) in Oklahoma, Mississippi, Florida, and Indiana. Global status for &quot;M. tripetala&quot; is secure (G5) as of 1991. Global status is in need of review. Efforts to conserve &quot;M. tripetala&quot; have been taken by local and state-wide ecological groups and are still being recommended. As the tree grows on steep slopes, the trees and soil are subject to damage due to human traffic in its native range. &quot;Ailanthus altissima&quot; has been described as a competitor to &quot;M. tripetala&quot; and has been removed from its habitat to better support &quot;M. tripetala&quot; persistence.

== Ecology ==
&quot;Magnolia tripetala&quot; most commonly lives in slope forests on north-facing slopes. The tree has been seen to grow along streambanks as well as in many ravines. Beetles are the primary pollinators of &quot;M. tripetala&quot; and birds and squirrels disperse seeds. Beetles enter buds of the flowers to feed on pollen and move this pollen from male parts of the flower to female parts. The male reproductive parts of the flower mature first. These trees are slow to spread but seedlings are resilient. Flowers bloom in the spring while seeds mature and spread throughout the summer.

<text>The Aircraft Disposal Company (ADC), or Airdisco, was a British firm established in March 1920 to take advantage of the large number of World War I-surplus military aircraft on the market. The company changed name in 1925 to ADC Aircraft Limited.

==History==
In 1920 the British government, through the Disposal and Liquidation Commission of the Ministry of Munitions, sold the entire stock of surplus aircraft, aero-engines and related equipment held in the United Kingdom to the Imperial and Foreign Corporation Limited. The sale included more than 10,000 aircraft and 35,000 aero-engines, for the sum of £1,000,000 plus a 50% share of any profits. The Imperial and Foreign Corporation formed the Aircraft Disposal Company to sell the equipment and to take over the management of the storage organisation and the large aircraft depots throughout the country. The Handley Page Company were appointed sole managing and selling agents for ADC although problems with the financial arrangement soon put Handley Page at risk and the agreement was made in March 1921 between Handley Page Limited, Frederick Handley Page and ADC to stop ADC liquidating the Handley Page Company.

The former military aircraft were converted to various civil roles before being sold on while others were sold to military buyers. By 1925, it had sold 2,000 airframes and 3,000 engines, generating profits of over £2,500,000, of which half was returned to the British Treasury.

The company had several sites across Britain including of Regent&#x27;s Park in London known as Marylebone Green. Three of the National Aircraft Factories became part of the Aircraft Disposal Company including Aintree in Liverpool, Waddon in Croydon, and at Stockport near Manchester.

The company became known as &quot;Airdisco&quot; from its telegraphic address, &quot;Airdisco, London&quot;.

In 1926 eight A.D.C.1 fighters (developed from the Martinsyde Buzzard) were delivered to Latvia.

The company had offices at Regent House, 89 Kingsway London WC2. 

The company name was changed to ADC Aircraft Limited in 1925 and was finally wound up in 1930.

==Aircraft==
*Airdisco Phi-Phi
*A.D.C.1 (Martinsyde Buzzard)

==Aircraft engines==
The company produced a small range of aircraft engines under the direction of Frank Halford, the &#x27;Cirrus&#x27; line continued to be manufactured by Cirrus Aero Engines Ltd and their successors.

<text>Steeping is the soaking of an organic solid, such as leaves, in a liquid (usually water) to extract flavours or to soften it. The specific process of teas being prepared for drinking by leaving the leaves in heated water to release the flavour and nutrients is known as steeping. Herbal teas may be prepared by decoction, infusion, or maceration. Some solids are soaked to remove an ingredient, such as salt, where the solute is not the desired product. 

==Corn==
One example is the steeping of corn (or maize), part of the milling process. As described by the US Corn Refiners Association, harvested kernels of corn are cleaned and then steeped in water at a temperature of for 30 to 40 hours. In the process their moisture content rises from 15% to 45% and their volume more than doubles. The gluten bonds in the corn are weakened and starch is released. The corn is then ground to break free the germ and other components, and the water used (steepwater), which has absorbed various nutrients, is recycled for use in animal feeds.

==Tea==
Dried teas as loose tea or tea bags are prepared for drinking by steeping the leaves in just boiled or heated water to release the flavour and nutrients in the dried tea into the water. This is often done in a cup, mug, teapot, pitcher or urn. A tea infuser or a tea strainer may be used to assist in this process. There is a huge variety of teas available in the market with broad based categories like oolong, green, black, white etc. and other specialized ones catering to particular regions such as Assam, Darjeeling etc. Each tea has to be prepared properly pertaining to their make and quality.

==Beer==

Steeping grain is a part of making beer.

<text>Johnny Suede is a 1991 American film, the directorial debut of Tom DiCillo, and stars Brad Pitt and Catherine Keener in some of their earliest roles, along with Calvin Levels and Nick Cave.

==Synopsis==
Johnny Suede is a young man with an attitude and an immense pompadour, who aspires to be a rock n&#x27; roll star like his idol Ricky Nelson. He believes he has all the stylistic accoutrements sans a pair of black suede shoes. One night, a pair of black suede shoes mysteriously appear, landing on top of the telephone booth he was using.

Shortly thereafter, Johnny meets Darlette, a sultry bohemian with whom he sleeps. Despite Darlette&#x27;s jealous and abusive gun-toting boyfriend, Johnny sees Darlette daily. The destitute Johnny is forced to pawn his guitar to pay his rent while Darlette mysteriously vanishes. Johnny&#x27;s friend Deke lends him the money to get his guitar back from the pawnshop, and the duo forms a band. Sad and depressed about Darlette&#x27;s desertion, Johnny wanders around New York aimlessly until he meets Yvonne, a woman more intelligent than Johnny. Yvonne teaches him that there are things in life more important than a pair of black suede shoes.

==Cast==
==Production==
Around 1985, while taking acting classes in New York City, Tom DiCillo was impressed with the local punk movement and the resurgence of rockabilly led by acts like Elvis Costello, The Stray Cats and The Clash. Spinning personal experiences into monologues, he created a character whose vulnerability is obscured by a superficial fifties era cool, exaggerated to the point of foolishness. DiCillo first wove what he had into a one-hour one-man show, before setting the first draft of the screenplay to paper. Eight months later he had completed the fourth draft. Having received positive feedback from his friend Jim Jarmusch (with whom he had attended film school at New York University and had shot his first two films) , DiCillo approached German television, ZDF, who gave him eighty thousand dollars. Additional funding came from the National Endowment for the Arts for twenty-five thousand dollars, as well as a Panavision package and help with the script from the Sundance Lab. Around 1988 to 1989, while at the Cannes Film Festival, DiCillo stumbled into a deal with a South African producer wherein he sold worldwide rights to his film for three hundred thousand dollars; an arrangement he would later call, &quot;A shaky thing but still I felt it was worth the risk so I decided to go ahead with it.&quot;

=== Casting ===
Pre-production, early casting, and the search for Johnny quickly followed. By August 1989, having not found what they were looking for in New York, DiCillo and his casting director, Marcia Shulman, went to Los Angeles, where Brad Pitt was the second to last guy seen. DiCillo recalls, &quot;[He] didn’t have much on his resume. In fact he only had two things; he’d done a small Canadian TV series and he’d just finished shooting what he’d listed as his only real film credit — something called &quot;Thelma and Louise&quot; that no one had heard about because it hadn’t even been edited yet.&quot; Convinced Pitt was Johnny Suede, DiCillo forced the casting on his South African producer, who was thereafter replaced by Ruth Waldburger when the South African&#x27;s option expired. The film was ultimately shot in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, in 30 days, from November to December 1990.

=== Music ===
Original music for the film was performed by rockabilly guitar legend Link Wray. Subsequently, a version was released on Netflix that removed 8 minutes of Wray&#x27;s music. DiCillo objected to this version and subsequently was allowed to re-edit the film himself, removing scenes and voiceover that had been added by the distributor.

==Release and reception==
The film was entered into competition at the Locarno International Film Festival in Switzerland, where it was seen by Mark Tusk from Miramax who, convinced Pitt would become a film star, urged Harvey Weinstein to make the unprecedented step of purchasing the rights to a film he had not yet seen. &quot;Johnny Suede&quot; won Best Picture at the festival, and the distribution deal was sealed.

The movie reportedly grossed $90,091 at the US box office, against a production budget of $500,000, though this was in one cinema - its widest release.

==Home media==
The 2009 Anchor Bay release of this film includes an audio commentary track from DiCillo.

<text>Nordicity () is the degree of northernness. The concept was developed by Canadian geographer Louis-Edmond Hamelin in the 1960s based on previous work done in the Soviet Union. Hamelin&#x27;s system defined northern territories – like northern Canada – not by literal latitude, but as a continuum based on a number of natural and human factors.

Hamelin developed an index he called &quot;Valeurs polaires&quot; (French for &quot;polar values&quot;) or VAPO, where the North Pole had a VAPO of 1000. The nordicity index had 10 natural and human components:
#latitude
#summer heat
#annual cold
#types of ice
#total precipitation
#natural vegetation cover
#accessibility by means other than air
#air service
#population
#degree of economic activity

Each component was graded on the scale of 0–100 where 100 represented extreme nordicity, with the VAPO representing the sum of these ten components. Hamelin proposed that areas with a VAPO of more than 200 should be considered &quot;the North&quot;. He subdivided Canada into &quot;Extreme North&quot;, &quot;Far North&quot;, &quot;Middle North&quot;, and &quot;Near North&quot; () based on their VAPO. Using the VAPO, most of Canada outside the Southern Vancouver Island and the Lower Mainland, the Prairies, the Quebec City-Windsor Corridor, and most of the Maritimes exhibits some degree of nordicity. . His &quot;Extreme North&quot; included the northern portion of Canada&#x27;s Arctic Archipelago. The rest of the archipelago and tundra zone as well as parts of the boreal forest were included in the &quot;Far North&quot;.

The Canadian government uses a set system for measuring nordicity, which is used for determining a number of regulations in fields such as environmental protection, infrastructure, and many others. Northern Canada, apropos, is normally divided into three areas. The &quot;Middle North&quot; covering the northern parts of most provinces, as well as parts of the territories is largely populated by those of European descent and has significant resource extraction despite its low population. The &quot;Far North&quot; covers the northern part of the continent and the southern Arctic Archipelago. The &quot;Extreme North&quot; covers the northernmost islands and is largely uninhabitable. Other countries have their own systems of measuring nordicity.

The idea of nordicity and the changing conceptions of what is the north has also recently become a subject for historians.

<doc id="1035745" wikidata="Q5251735" url="?curid=1035745" title="Defuzzification">
<text>Defuzzification is the process of producing a quantifiable result in crisp logic, given fuzzy sets and corresponding membership degrees. It is the process that maps a fuzzy set to a crisp set.

It is typically needed in fuzzy control systems. These systems will have a number of rules that transform a number of variables into a fuzzy result, that is, the result is described in terms of membership in fuzzy sets. For example, rules designed to decide how much pressure to apply might result in &quot;Decrease Pressure (15%), Maintain Pressure (34%), Increase Pressure (72%)&quot;. Defuzzification is interpreting the membership degrees of the fuzzy sets into a specific decision or real value.

The simplest but least useful defuzzification method is to choose the set with the highest membership, in this case, &quot;Increase Pressure&quot; since it has a 72% membership, and ignore the others, and convert this 72% to some number. The problem with this approach is that it loses information. The rules that called for decreasing or maintaining pressure might as well have not been there in this case.

A common and useful defuzzification technique is &quot;center of gravity&quot;. First, the results of the rules must be added together in some way. The most typical fuzzy set membership function has the graph of a triangle. Now, if this triangle were to be cut in a straight horizontal line somewhere between the top and the bottom, and the top portion were to be removed, the remaining portion forms a trapezoid. The first step of defuzzification typically &quot;chops off&quot; parts of the graphs to form trapezoids (or other shapes if the initial shapes were not triangles). For example, if the output has &quot;Decrease Pressure (15%)&quot;, then this triangle will be cut 15% the way up from the bottom. In the most common technique, all of these trapezoids are then superimposed one upon another, forming a single geometric shape. Then, the centroid of this shape, called the &quot;fuzzy centroid&quot;, is calculated. The &quot;x&quot; coordinate of the centroid is the defuzzified value.

==Methods==
There are many different methods of defuzzification available, including the following:

* AI (adaptive integration)
* BADD (basic defuzzification distributions)
* BOA (bisector of area)
* CDD (constraint decision defuzzification)
* COA (center of area)
* COG (center of gravity)
* ECOA (extended center of area)
* EQM (extended quality method)
* FCD (fuzzy clustering defuzzification)
* FM (fuzzy mean)
* FOM (first of maximum)
* GLSD (generalized level set defuzzification)
* ICOG (indexed center of gravity)
* IV (influence value)
* LOM (last of maximum)
* MeOM (mean of maxima)
* MOM (middle of maximum)
* QM (quality method)
* RCOM (random choice of maximum)
* SLIDE (semi-linear defuzzification)
* WFM (weighted fuzzy mean)
The maxima methods are good candidates for fuzzy reasoning systems. The distribution methods and the area methods exhibit the property of continuity that makes them suitable for fuzzy controllers.

<text>PeoplePC is an Internet service provider owned by EarthLink.

== History ==
PeoplePC was founded by Nick Grouf, Max Metral and David Waxman, and launched in the United States in October 1999. It bundled personal computers with internet service and access to discounted products and services. Initially funded by SoftBank, the company&#x27;s mission was to &quot;democratize technology.&quot; Its business model included collective buying, which allowed the company to generate additional revenue from advertising, partnerships, and premium products.

In February 2000, the company announced that they would provide PCs and Internet access to all of the employees of Ford Motor Co. and Delta Air Lines. Ford announced a cooperation with PeoplePC shortly after and said they would provide all of their then 350,000 employees with internet access for as little as $5 a month. The deal with Delta led to a total of around 420,000 potential new customers for PeoplePC. The deal with Ford was eventually canceled.

In October it was announced, that PeoplePC would open European subsidiaries to enable overseas corporations and governments to offer their employees low-cost home computers and Internet access and later developed partnerships with Vivendi Universal, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Blue Cross Blue Shield, and the National Trades Union of Singapore. PeoplePC donated internet access to low-income families through President Clinton&#x27;s ClickStart initiative, and provided both computers and computer training to economically disadvantaged students through its PeopleGive program.

PeoplePC debuted on NASDAQ in August 2000 under the ticker PEOP at $10 a share and its stock declined quickly. In 2002 the company was acquired by EarthLink. PeoplePC has been managed by CEO Nick Grouf since 2002.

== Products and services ==
When the company started, PeoplePC focused on selling three-year memberships to consumers. As part of the membership, customers received a new computer, which was replaced every three years. They were also granted access to the company&#x27;s buyer&#x27;s club and were provided with Internet access and a warranty. PeoplePC then focused more on companies and their employees.

Today PeoplePC offers internet services in the main categories internet access, security &amp; tools, and website &amp; marketing. They also provide webmail service to their users without any extra charges.

== Recognitions ==
In 2006, J.D. Power and Associates ranked PeoplePC Online as the first value-priced dial-up provider to receive the highest ratings from customers in four factors: cost of service, billing, e-mail services, and offerings.

<text>Peter Zvi Malkin (; , May 27, 1927 – March 1, 2005) was a Polish-born Israeli secret agent and member of the Mossad intelligence agency. He was part of the team that captured Adolf Eichmann in Argentina in 1960 and brought him to Israel to stand trial for crimes against humanity.

==Biography==
Peter Zvi (&quot;Zvika&quot;) Malkin was born in Żółkiewka, Poland, to an observant Jewish family. In 1933, his family fled to Palestine to escape the rising tide of German anti-Semitism; his sister, Fruma, and her three children who remained behind with 150 other relatives, were murdered in the Holocaust. At the age of 12, Malkin was recruited into the Haganah as an explosives expert. He was an expert in martial arts and disguises.

Malkin was married to Roni (nee Thorner), with whom he had two daughters, Tami and Adi, and a son, Omer.

After retiring in 1976, Malkin devoted himself to painting and sculpture, which served as his cover during his Mossad years. His paintings from the 1960s until he died won international acclaim in London, Paris, Brussels and Israel. He also authored books, and served as a private international consultant on anti-terrorism methods.

Malkin spent his last years in New York City with his wife and children. He died on March 1, 2005.

==Intelligence career==
Malkin spent 27 years in the Mossad, first as an agent and later as Chief of Operations. As Chief of Operations he played a major role in the capture of Israel Bar, a Soviet spy who had penetrated the highest levels of Israeli government. He also led an operation against Nazi nuclear rocket scientists who assisted an Egyptian weapons development program after World War II.

Malkin established a unit known as Keshet whose expertise was infiltrating airline offices, travel agencies, airports, seaports and foreign embassies. On several occasions, he carried out wiretapping and other missions with Israeli actor Chaim Topol whose international fame diverted attention from Malkin.

Malkin&#x27;s most famous mission was on May 11, 1960, when he and a team of Mossad agents led by Rafi Eitan captured Adolf Eichmann, then living and hiding in Argentina. A senior Nazi bureaucrat, Eichmann had played a key role in organizing the extermination of Jews during World War II. &quot;Momentito, señor&quot; (One moment, sir) were the words he uttered in Spanish as he approached Eichmann. Eichmann began to fear for his life and turned to flee, but several of Malkin&#x27;s fellow agents blocked Eichmann&#x27;s path. Then Malkin grabbed him in a neck-lock, wrestled him to the ground, and bundled him in the car that took them to a safe house outside Buenos Aires. Malkin says he wore gloves so as not to touch the man.

Malkin took part in the Mossad&#x27;s assassinations after a terrorist attack targeting Israeli Olympic athletes in Munich in September 1972. He headed a group of agents from the Mossad&#x27;s burglary unit who planted a bomb under a telephone at Mahmoud Hamshari&#x27;s home who was the representative of the Palestine Liberation Organization to France.

In the mid 1980s, Malkin was recruited to go after former SS doctor Josef Mengele. Malkin and the team of ex-Mossad agents that he put together did not know at the time that Mengele was already dead. At the last minute, Malkin and the team called off the operation when they realized that it was a trap.

In 1989, Israeli newspaper &quot;Maariv&quot; cited him as &quot;one of the greatest figures ever in the history of the Mossad.&quot; Israeli journalist Uri Dan called him &quot;an extraordinary secret warrior.&quot;

Malkin is said to have been involved in the search for Yossele Schumacher in the 1960s.

==Cultural references==
The movie, &quot;The Man Who Captured Eichmann&quot; (1996) starring Robert Duvall as Adolf Eichmann, was based on his book &quot;Eichmann in My Hands&quot;. Arliss Howard played Malkin. Evan M. Wiener&#x27;s play &quot;Captors&quot; was also inspired by the book. Malkin was also portrayed by Oscar Isaac in the 2018 movie &quot;Operation Finale&quot; (with Ben Kingsley as Eichmann) and by Chaim Topol (as a character named Michael) in the 1979 film &quot;The House on Garibaldi Street&quot;.

<text>Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants is an international environmental treaty, signed on 22 May 2001 in Stockholm and effective from 17 May 2004, that aims to eliminate or restrict the production and use of persistent organic pollutants (POPs).

== History ==
In 1995, the Governing Council of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) called for global action to be taken on POPs, which it defined as &quot;chemical substances that persist in the environment, bio-accumulate through the food web, and pose a risk of causing adverse effects to human health and the environment&quot;.

Following this, the Intergovernmental Forum on Chemical Safety (IFCS) and the International Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS) prepared an assessment of the 12 worst offenders, known as the &quot;dirty dozen&quot;.

The INC met five times between June 1998 and December 2000 to elaborate the convention, and delegates adopted the Stockholm Convention on POPs at the Conference of the Plenipotentiaries convened from 22 to 23 May 2001 in Stockholm, Sweden.
The negotiations for the convention were completed on 23 May 2001 in Stockholm. The convention entered into force on 17 May 2004 with ratification by an initial 128 parties and 151 signatories. Co-signatories agree to outlaw nine of the dirty dozen chemicals, limit the use of DDT to malaria control, and curtail inadvertent production of dioxins and furans.

Parties to the convention have agreed to a process by which persistent toxic compounds can be reviewed and added to the convention, if they meet certain criteria for persistence and transboundary threat. The first set of new chemicals to be added to the convention were agreed at a conference in Geneva on 8 May 2009.

As of September 2022, there are 186 parties to the convention (185 states and the European Union). Notable non-ratifying states include the United States, Israel, and Malaysia.

The Stockholm Convention was adopted to EU legislation in Regulation (EC) No 850/2004. In 2019, the latter was replaced by Regulation (EU) 2019/1021.

==Summary of provisions==
Key elements of the Convention include the requirement that developed countries provide new and additional financial resources and measures to eliminate production and use of intentionally produced POPs, eliminate unintentionally produced POPs where feasible, and manage and dispose of POPs wastes in an environmentally sound manner. Precaution is exercised throughout the Stockholm Convention, with specific references in the preamble, the objective, and the provision on identifying new POPs.

==Persistent Organic Pollutants Review Committee==
When adopting the convention, provision was made for a procedure to identify additional POPs and the criteria to be considered in doing so. At the first meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP1), held in Punta del Este, Uruguay, from 2–6 May 2005, the POPRC was established to consider additional candidates nominated for listing under the convention.

The committee is composed of 31 experts nominated by parties from the five United Nations regional groups and reviews nominated chemicals in three stages. The Committee first determines whether the substance fulfills POP screening criteria detailed in Annex D of the convention, relating to its persistence, bioaccumulation, potential for long-range environmental transport (LRET), and toxicity. If a substance is deemed to fulfill these requirements, the Committee then drafts a risk profile according to Annex E to evaluate whether the substance is likely, as a result of its LRET, to lead to significant adverse human health and/or environmental effects and therefore warrants global action. Finally, if the POPRC finds that global action is warranted, it develops a risk management evaluation, according to Annex F, reflecting socioeconomic considerations associated with possible control measures. Based on this, the POPRC decides to recommend that the COP list the substance under one or more of the annexes to the convention. The POPRC has met annually in Geneva, Switzerland, since its establishment. 
The seventh meeting of the Persistent Organic Pollutants Review Committee (POPRC-7) of the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) took place from 10 to 14 October 2011 in Geneva. POPRC-8 was held from 15 to 19 October 2012 in Geneva, POPRC-9 to POPRC-15 were held in Rome, while POPRC-16 needed to be held online.

== Listed substances ==
There were initially twelve distinct chemicals (&quot;dirty dozen&quot;) listed in three categories. Two chemicals, hexachlorobenzene and polychlorinated biphenyls, were listed in both categories A and C. Currently, five chemicals are listed in both categories.

== Chemicals newly proposed for inclusion in Annexes A, B, C ==
POPRC-7 considered three proposals for listing in Annexes A, B and/or C of the convention: chlorinated naphthalenes (CNs), hexachlorobutadiene (HCBD) and pentachlorophenol (PCP), its salts and esters. The proposal is the first stage of the POPRC&#x27;s work in assessing a substance, and requires the POPRC to assess whether the proposed chemical satisfies the criteria in Annex D of the convention. The criteria for forwarding a proposed chemical to the risk profile preparation stage are persistence, bioaccumulation, potential for long-range environmental transport (LRET), and adverse effects.

POPRC-8 proposed hexabromocyclododecane for listing in Annex A, with specific exemptions for production and use in expanded polystyrene and extruded polystyrene in buildings. This proposal was agreed at the sixth Conference of Parties on 28 April-10 May 2013.

POPRC-9 proposed di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, hexa-, hepta- and octa-chlorinated naphthalenes, and hexachlorobutadiene for listing in Annexes A and C. It also set up further work on pentachlorophenol, its salts and esters, and decabromodiphenyl ether, perfluorooctanesulfonic acid, its salts and perfluorooctane sulfonyl chloride.

POPRC-15 proposed PFHxS for listing in Annex A without specific exemptions.

Currently, chlorpyrifos, long-chain perfluorocarboxylic acids and medium-chain chlorinated paraffins are under review.

== Controversies ==
Although some critics have alleged that the treaty is responsible for the continuing death toll from malaria, in reality the treaty specifically permits the public health use of DDT for the control of mosquitoes (the malaria vector). There are also ways to prevent high amounts of DDT consumed by using other malaria controls such as window screens. As long as there are specific measures taken, such as use of DDT indoors, then the limited amount of DDT can be used in a regulated fashion. From a developing country perspective, a lack of data and information about the sources, releases, and environmental levels of POPs hampers negotiations on specific compounds, and indicates a strong need for research.

Another controversy would be certain POPs (which are continually active, specifically in the Arctic Biota) that were mentioned in the Stockholm Convention, but were not part of the Dirty Dozen such as perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS). PFOS have many general uses such as stain repellents but have many properties which can make it a dangerous due to the fact that PFOS can be highly resistant to environmental breakdown. PFOS can be toxic in terms of increased offspring death, decrease in body weight, and the disruption of neurological systems. What makes this compound controversial is the economic and political impact it can have among various countries and businesses.

<doc id="1035772" wikidata="Q1456525" url="?curid=1035772" title="Timpanogos Cave National Monument">
<text>Timpanogos Cave National Monument is a United States National Monument protecting the Timpanogos Cave Historic District and a
cave system on Mount Timpanogos in American Fork Canyon in the Wasatch Range, near Highland, Utah, in the United States. The site is managed by the National Park Service. The trail to the cave entrance gains height, but it is paved and fairly wide, making it accessible for most people. The three caves of the system, one of which is specifically called Timpanogos Cave, are only viewable on guided tours when the monument is open, usually from May through September depending on snow conditions and funding. There is the standard tour going through the cave system, and an Introduction to Caving tour which teaches Leave No Trace caving and goes further into Hansen Cave.

==Three caves==
The three caves of the Monument that are tourable are: Hansen Cave, Middle Cave, and Timpanogos Cave. The three caves are connected by manmade tunnels blasted in the 1930s by the Works Progress Administration. The average temperature in the caves is 46 degrees Fahrenheit. Many colorful cave features or speleothems can be seen. Among the most interesting are the helictites, which are hollowed, twisted, spiraling straws of deposited calcite or aragonite. They are formed when water travels through the tube and then evaporates, leaving a trace mineral deposit at the end. Other speleothems found in the cave include: cave bacon, cave columns, flowstone, cave popcorn, cave drapery, stalactites and stalagmites.

==Discovery of the caves==
Martin Hansen (1847-1934) discovered what became known as Hansen Cave in October 1887, reportedly while cutting timber he tracked cougar footprints high up the side of American Fork Canyon. Many of the features and formations in this chamber were damaged or removed by the Duke Onyx Company and the general public before the cave was made a national monument.

In the summer of 1913, a second cave was discovered nearby. While in the area to explore Hansen Cave with their families, teenagers James Williams Gough (1897-1986) and Frank Johnson were climbing an adjacent slope when they discovered the entrance to what is now known as Timpanogos Cave. Several others later entered the cave and viewed many of the formations inside, including the Great Heart of Timpanogos. However, before long, knowledge of the cave and its entrance was lost. Some sources indicate that the entrance was lost due to a landslide in the area, while others say it was, in part, caused by the extreme secrecy of the original finders. Several years later, after hearing rumors of another cave, Vearl James Manwill (1900-1966) came with a group of associates (which later became the Payson Alpine Club) in search of the mysterious hidden cave. On August 14, 1921 he rediscovered it (although many sources credit him as having discovered the cave). He immediately shared the information with the other members of the group. Having in mind the extreme damage that had resulted in Hansen Cave, that very night, the group dedicated themselves to the preservation of the cave. Of that night, Manwill wrote in his journal that they discussed ways &quot;to preserve its beauty for posterity instead of allowing it to be vandalized as Hansen&#x27;s Cave had been.&quot; Shortly thereafter they reported their find to the US Forest Service.

Later that fall, on October 15, 1921, George Heber Hansen (1884-1951; Martin’s son) and Wayne Errol Hansen (1903-1989; Martin’s grandson), were hunting on the other side of the canyon. While using binoculars to try to find deer, they came across another hole in the mountain, in between the other two caves. In a few days they came back, with 74-year-old Martin Hansen. Martin was the first to enter the cave, now called Middle Cave.

Current tours of the cave system enter the caves though a manmade entrance very close to the entrance discovered by Martin Hansen. Passing through a manmade tunnel, tours continue on to Middle Cave, before passing through another manmade tunnel to Timpanogos Cave. Finally, tours return to the surface through a manmade exit near the original entrance.

==Administration==
Although the site was designated a national monument on October 14, 1922, the site was initially developed and maintained by the U.S. Forest Service. The National Park Service took over management in 1933. A number of park structures were built by the Works Progress Administration in the 1930s and early 1940s. The Timpanogos Cave Historic District was designated in 1982 to include these structures.

Middle Cave and Timpanogos Cave were discovered in an era where their formations and resources could be protected. The National Park Service, which oversees and preserves the cave complex, has continued to develop new ways to retain its natural features, including limiting lighting in the caves to retard growth of invasive organisms. Preservation is a high priority. The resource management team at the monument is actively involved in protecting the cave and its surroundings. The National Park Service is continually monitoring and striving to determine a successful balance between visitor access and cave preservation. A limited number of people per tour was implemented to help lessen the human impacts in the caves.

The National Park Service also balances preservation with the needs of the Monument&#x27;s staff. The Monument&#x27;s original visitor center burned down in 1991, and the visitor center was housed in a double wide trailer house for almost three decades. With the temporary visitor center in a dangerous rock-fall zone, plans for a new center came under consideration. Following the monument closing for the season in September 2018, construction began on the new trailhead and visitor center. The trail and monument reopened to the public in June 2019.

==Geology==
The cave system is located in the Deseret Limestone, a Mississippian age limestone formed around 340 million years ago. Notably the cave cavity was formed initially by a series of faults running off of the Wasatch fault. Since that time hydrothermal water action perhaps similar to that of Cave of the Winds in Colorado, and uplift of the Wasatch Mountains has formed the modern cave system. The speleothems first started to form within the last 750,000 years, based on paleomagnetism of iron deposits within the formations, as the cave system has been slowly lifted above the unnamed stream that flows though the canyon (and becomes the American Fork [river] at the mouth of the canyon).
