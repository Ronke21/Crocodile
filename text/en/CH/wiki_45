<doc id="1023035" wikidata="Q175315" url="?curid=1023035" title="New Zealand men's national football team">
<text>The New Zealand men&#x27;s national football team (; recognised as Aotearoa New Zealand by FIFA) represents New Zealand in men&#x27;s international football competitions. The team is governed by the governing body for football in New Zealand, New Zealand Football (NZF), which is currently a member of FIFA and the Oceania Football Confederation (OFC). The team&#x27;s official nickname is the All Whites ().

The team represented New Zealand at the FIFA World Cup tournaments in 1982 and 2010, and the FIFA Confederations Cup tournaments in 1999, 2003, 2009, and 2017. New Zealand is a six-time OFC Nations Cup champion. New Zealand was the only unbeaten country in the 2010 FIFA World Cup, drawing all three group stage games; nevertheless, they were eliminated in the group stage.

==History==
===Early years===
New Zealand&#x27;s first international football match was played in Dunedin at the old Caledonian Ground on 23 July 1904 against a team representing New South Wales. New Zealand lost by the game&#x27;s only goal, but drew with the same team 3–3 in a game at Athletic Park, Wellington seven days later. The following year the team played a Wellington representative side on 10 June before embarking on a tour of Australia, during which they played eleven representative sides, including three &quot;test matches&quot; against New South Wales. Of these three matches they won one, lost one, and drew one.

A New Zealand national team did not play again until 1922, when New Zealand played three official full internationals against Australia, played at Carisbrook in Dunedin, Athletic Park in Wellington, and Auckland Domain. The results were two 3–1 wins to New Zealand and a 1–1 draw in Wellington. In 1927, Canada became the second team to play in New Zealand as they played in four official matches with a win and a draw.

New Zealand would become one of the founder members of the Oceania Football Confederation in 1966 which was founded between Charlie Dempsey and his Australian colleague Jim Bayutti in founding the federation.

===Success for España &#x27;82===

At the beginning of the 1980s the All Whites were on a run of consecutive victories until the 1980 Oceania Cup in New Caledonia. New Zealand ended up having a disastrous campaign, losing 1–3 and 0–4 for Tahiti and Fiji respectively. In the last round without a possible qualification for the final they beat the Solomon Islands by a large score of 6–1. Primarily due to the poor campaign in this year&#x27;s Merdeka Tournament, the team did not have a strong reputation. 

The All Whites reputation was later improved when the team advanced to the final phase of the qualifiers for the 1982 World Cup. They had an almost perfect campaign with zero losses. The teams strength was highlighted by the 3–3 draw and the 1–0 victory against their team rival Australia, and a great 13-0 victory against Fiji. For the final phase the All Whites competed hard against China PR, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Thanks to a large 5-0 victory against the Saudis they had to compete in a play-off match against China. Due to the draw of points and on goal difference, and with decisive goals from Steve Wooddin and Wynton Rufer, they won 2–1, and achieved a historic classification for España &#x27;82. 

Up until the 1980s, the All Whites received criticism for having a high number of British players. Of the 22-man squad in their 1982 FIFA World Cup campaign, 11 members were born in the United Kingdom. This included the captain Steve Sumner and striker Steve Wooddin, who had both played club football in England before immigrating. They lost all three games conceding 12 goals and scoring just 2. Over the following decades the composition of the national squad changed and &quot;the face of football became increasingly Kiwi&quot;.

===Consolidation in Oceania===

Since the 1990s, United States college soccer has played a significant role in the development of New Zealand players. This influence began when former Scotland international Bobby Clark returned to the US after his 1994–96 stint as New Zealand head coach to take the head coaching job at Stanford University (he now holds the same position at Notre Dame). Clark began recruiting in New Zealand, and former New Zealand national players Ryan Nelsen and Simon Elliott played for him at Stanford. The trend that Clark started has continued to the present; more than two dozen New Zealanders are now playing for NCAA Division I men&#x27;s programmes in the US. A common next step in these players&#x27; career paths is a stint in Major League Soccer; ESPN soccernet journalist Brent Latham speculated in a March 2010 story that New Zealand&#x27;s 2010 FIFA World Cup squad could have more MLS players than the US squad.

However, Latham&#x27;s speculation did not prove true, as only one MLS player made the New Zealand squad for the World Cup. New Zealand formerly competed against Australia for top honours in the OFC. However, after Australia left to join the AFC in 2006, New Zealand were left as the only seeded team in the OFC. New Zealand qualified for the 2010 FIFA World Cup though exited the competition after the first round despite being the only team not to lose a game during the tournament because they drew 1–1 vs defending champions Italy, Slovakia and 0–0 vs Paraguay while eventual champions Spain lost to Switzerland. New Zealand notably finished above Italy in their group as Italy lost to Slovakia in their final group match and finished with two points compared to New Zealand&#x27;s three.
===Horror in Honiara and failures towards the World Cup===
After a very positive cycle for the All Whites, the team competed for the 2012 OFC Nations Cup as big favourites to win the title, doing well in the group stage, winning the first two games by slim scores (1–0 and 2–1), and a 1–1 draw against the Mandates Salomonense, however in the next phase, they faced New Caledonia in the semi-final, where they suffered a shameful defeat by 0–2, with goals from Bertrand Kaï in the 60th minute, and Georges Gope-Fenepej in the 90+2 minute to seal the defeat which was called &quot;Horror in Honiara&quot;. Even beating the Solomon Islands in the play-off for third place, this did not prevent the dismissal of the coach at the time Ricki Herbert, where after this embarrassing defeat, they would also be eliminated in the intercontinental play-off for the 2014 World Cup for Mexico by the score of 3–9 on aggregate.
In August 2014, Anthony Hudson was appointed manager of the All Whites. Hudson&#x27;s first game in charge of the national team was a 3–1 defeat away to Uzbekistan in September 2014. As a result of the All Whites playing &quot;just three matches&quot; in the previous year, which was &quot;the least of any country in world football&quot;, and having &quot;seven months without a match&quot; the All Whites dropped to 161 in the FIFA world rankings. The All Whites went on to win the 2016 OFC Nations Cup, winning four matches with the final being won via a penalty shootout after a 0–0 draw against Papua New Guinea, conceding only 1 goal, from a penalty, in the process. New Zealand&#x27;s victory saw them crowned Oceania champions making New Zealand the most successful national team in the competition&#x27;s history, having won the tournament five times, and also saw them qualify for the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup in Russia. The All Whites moved up 54 places in the world rankings in July and achieved 88th in the FIFA world rankings, the highest ranking in three years, on the back of the OFC Nations Cup victory that qualified them for the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup.

After a disappointing tournament at the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup where they finished bottom of their group which featured Russia, Mexico and Portugal, the national team fell 27 places to 122nd. In September 2017, New Zealand won the OFC Final against the Solomon Islands with an aggregate score of 8–3 to qualify for the inter-continental play-off qualifier against Peru, the fifth-ranked nation from the South America&#x27;s qualifiers. After holding Peru off in the first leg, they would go to lose 2–0 in the second leg to be eliminated from competition as Peru became the last team to qualify for the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

===Failure to qualify for the 2022 World Cup===
After the All Whites&#x27; stoppage for almost two years, they returned to play friendlies (in 2021), obtaining positive results in their three (four counting against Algeria A&#x27;) games played in that year. With the complications caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Qualifiers for the 2022 World Cup had to be held in the host country itself, Qatar, where the Kiwis managed to win all the games, as well as breaking artillery records, when the forward Chris Wood, became the All Whites&#x27; top scorer, after scoring twice against Fiji, surpassing the previous record holder, Vaughan Coveny.
With the continental victory, they qualified for the inter-confederation play-offs, where they disputed the vacancy against Costa Rica. They started by conceding a goal in the 3rd minute of the game to Joel Campbell, but New Zealand began to pressure the game a lot, and in the 39th minute of the game, Chris Wood scored a goal after a bad kick by Yeltsin Tejeda. However, his goal was disallowed when the video assistant referee (VAR) showed that Matthew Garbett had fouled Óscar Duarte before the goal. With the final whistle of the game, the New Zealanders failed to qualify for the cup, which was their third consecutive elimination in the inter-confederation play-offs. They were eliminated by Mexico in 2014, by Peru in 2018, and by Costa Rica in this 2022 edition.
After the qualifiers, the All Whites played a home and away series against their rivals Socceroos to mark the 100th anniversary of the first meeting between the two nations, which was first played in Dunedin in 1922.

==Team image==

=== Kit ===
New Zealand&#x27;s traditional home colours are white with a black trim, while its away kits are usually reversed, featuring black with a white trim. This reversal of the colour scheme by New Zealand&#x27;s football team is due to the fact that black was traditionally reserved for referees by FIFA.

===Nickname===
During the qualification for the 1982 FIFA World Cup, the team appeared for the first time in an all white uniform against Taiwan in 1981. This led a commentator to dub them the &quot;All Whites&quot;, a play on the traditional name &quot;All Blacks&quot; used for the national rugby team. The name stuck, and was popularised in the song &quot;Marching off to Spain&quot; with its chant refrain &quot;Kiwis! All Whites!&quot;. More recently, the nickname has been scrutinised by New Zealand Football due to its unintended racial overtones.

===Rivalries===

New Zealand&#x27;s long time rivals are Trans-Tasman neighbours Australia. The two teams&#x27; history dates back to 1922, where they first met in both their international debuts. The rivalry between the &quot;Socceroos&quot; (Australia) and the &quot;All Whites&quot; (New Zealand) is part of a wider friendly rivalry between the geographical neighbours Australia and New Zealand, which applies not only to sport but to the culture of the two countries. The rivalry was intensified when Australia and New Zealand were both members of the OFC, regularly competing in OFC Nations Cup finals and in FIFA World Cup qualifications, where only one team from the OFC progressed to the World Cup. Since Australia left the OFC to join the AFC in 2006, competition between the two teams has been less frequent. However, the rivalry between the two teams is still strong, with the occasional match receiving much media and public attention. The rivalry extends to club football, with New Zealand&#x27;s only fully professional team, the Wellington Phoenix, playing in the Australian A-League.

===Supporters===

The main supporters group of the New Zealand national team are known as the &#x27;White Noise&#x27;. White Noise was formed in November 2007 with the supporters group of the Wellington Phoenix, &#x27;Yellow Fever&#x27;, rebranding themselves when the national sides play.

===Home stadium===
New Zealand does not have a dedicated national stadium, instead the team plays at different venues throughout the country for exhibition or tournament purposes. In recent years, major international matches have usually been rotated around various large grounds, including Sky Stadium in Wellington and North Harbour Stadium in Auckland. International matches have also been played at the Mount Smart Stadium and Eden Park in Auckland.

<doc id="1023037" wikidata="Q5177553" url="?curid=1023037" title="Countryside Stewardship Scheme">
<text>The Countryside Stewardship Scheme was originally an agri-environment scheme run by the United Kingdom Government set up in 1991. In its original form it expired in 2014. It was relaunched for the Rural Development Programme England (RDPE) 2014-2020 with £3.1bn of government subsidy for agriculture and forestry, replacing the previous Environmental Stewardship scheme.

Countryside Stewardship:
*will contribute around £900 million to help protect and improve our environment. 
*will be open to all eligible farmers, foresters and land managers
*is a competitive targeted scheme, with grants awarded to those who will make the biggest improvements in their local area.
*replaces Environmental Stewardship (ES), the English Woodland Grant Scheme (EWGS) and capital grants from the Catchment Sensitive Farming (CSF) programme.

Forestry Commission and Natural England will jointly delivery Countryside Stewardship. Natural England will broadly lead on the set up and delivery of transactional services for Countryside Stewardship for the first year of the new scheme.

==Former CSS (1991-2014)==
In its first guise introduced as a five-year pilot project by the Countryside Commission in 1991, the scheme aimed to improve the environmental value of farmland throughout England. The administration of the scheme was taken over by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) on 1 April 1996, and the scheme expanded to include new landscapes and features, including whole farm plans for restoring and recreating traditional walls and ditches, wildlife corridors in arable areas using uncropped margins in arable fields (with management to benefit associated wild flowers and birds), traditional buildings, and old meadows and pastures (important for maintaining and increasing biodiversity). In the meantime, the scheme was incorporated under the umbrella of the European Community&#x27;s &#x27;agri-environment’ programme which aims to protect the environment and the countryside through the promotion of green farming practices, which enabled grants to be part-funded through the Community. The scheme was incorporated into the England Rural Development Programme on 1 January 2000.

In 2005, there were 16,636 agreement holders with 531,280 hectares under agreement.

The Countryside Stewardship Scheme closed to new applications in 2004 with the introduction of the Environmental stewardship (England) Scheme. Existing agreements continue to be honoured; the last agreements will expire in 2014. The scheme is currently administered by staff at Natural England.

==Rural Development Programme for England (RDPE) 2014-2020 ==
From 2014 to 2020 Rural Development Programme for England (RDPE) was originally adopted by the European Commission on 13 February 2015. The document follows the format laid down in the Commission Implementing Regulation (EC) No 808/2014.

<doc id="1023043" wikidata="Q7087116" url="?curid=1023043" title="Olive, the Other Reindeer">
<text>Olive, the Other Reindeer is a 1999 American animated Christmas comedy musical television film written by Steve Young, based on the 1997 children&#x27;s book by Vivian Walsh and J. Otto Seibold, and directed by Academy Award-nominated animator Steve Moore (credited as &quot;Oscar Moore&quot;). The feature was produced by Matt Groening&#x27;s The Curiosity Company and animated by DNA Productions. Drew Barrymore voices the title character, and she is credited as an executive producer on the special.

The special first aired on December 17, 1999, alongside &quot;Futurama&quot; on Fox, ten years after the premiere date of Groening&#x27;s television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. It was produced by Fox Television Studios and Flower Films. During its initial broadcast, the special brought in 6.06 million viewers, and an additional 5.22 million the following year. After airing again the following year, the special made its first cable television premiere on Nickelodeon on December 15, 2001; It would then premiere the following year on Cartoon Network on December 14, 2002, and aired during each holiday season until it was last seen on December 24, 2012. The special would also air on other local syndicated networks, such as The WB, MyNetworkTV, The CW and WGN-TV.

The story is based on the 1997 children&#x27;s book by Vivian Walsh and J. Otto Seibold and illustrated by J. Otto Seibold. In the song, &quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot;, the lyric &quot;All of the other reindeer&quot; can be misheard in dialects with the cot–caught merger as the mondegreen &quot;Olive, the other reindeer&quot;. The special was nominated for the Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program.

==Plot==
The story follows an anthropomorphic Jack Russell Terrier named Olive. While in town, she meets Martini, a con artist penguin recently fired from the city zoo, from whom she buys a counterfeit Rolex watch. When she returns home she finds her owner, Tim, sad that there &quot;won&#x27;t be any Christmas&quot; and disappointed that Olive does not behave like a normal dog. While tuning into the radio for comfort music, she hears a news report that Blitzen, one of Santa Claus&#x27;s reindeer, will not be able to fly this year and that &quot;all of the other reindeer&quot; would need to be able to pick up the slack. Her pet flea convinces Olive that the report actually said &quot;Olive, the other reindeer&quot;; when Tim tries to apologize, the flea mangles the apology such that Olive thinks Tim hates her. Upset, she runs away, hoping to save Christmas and re-earn Tim&#x27;s favor.

On the way to the bus station, a disgruntled Postman learns of Olive&#x27;s plan and vows to foil it, stating he wants Christmas ruined because he cannot handle the increased strain on the postal system during the holiday season (it is later revealed that his first time on the naughty list triggered a downward spiral making him more vengeful and even naughtier). After Martini helps Olive narrowly avoid the Postman&#x27;s attempt to frame Olive for mail fraud and capture her, Olive and Martini catch a bus to the North Pole, with the Postman in hot pursuit.

At a layover in Arctic Junction, Olive and Martini stop in a restaurant, where the Postman is waiting, disguised as a waitress, and kidnaps Olive. Olive escapes by finding a metal file, in a packaged addressed to her from a &quot;Deus Ex Machina&quot;. She escapes but misses her connecting bus. At a nearby bar, the local patrons are initially hostile before Olive convinces them to be humble and rekindle their Christmas spirit, which they do. Round John Virgin, the bar owner, takes Olive and Martini personally to the North Pole complex. At the gate, the security guard stubbornly turns Olive and Martini away; Martini devises a complex scheme to convince the guard to turn off the security system and gets Olive in. The Postman follows, delivering a parcel of counterfeit letters full of insults to Santa Claus. The letters nearly convince Santa that he is justified in cancelling the holiday before Olive points out that they lack postmarks. Olive takes Blitzen&#x27;s place but struggles to keep up with the flight.

At the first house, Santa realizes his bag has been switched with junk mail; Olive uses the scent to trace it, leading Santa&#x27;s sleigh to the Postman&#x27;s mail truck, where the Postman has also captured Martini. They retrieve the presents and rescue Martini, as Olive fashions cardboard mailers into wings to help her fly. Due to the reduced flight weight tolerance because of the missing reindeer, Martini must find his own way home, but Olive helps deliver the presents to the world. Just as they reach Olive&#x27;s home, the sleigh is surrounded by thick fog; Santa uses Olive&#x27;s scent tracking to lead the sleigh back to the North Pole (since Rudolph is only an urban legend). Santa and the reindeer thank Olive for her help and give her a gift of honorary antler ears before Comet gives her a ride home. Arriving home, Olive makes amends with Tim, who is happy to see her and proud of her bravery. Martini is now a postman, while the former Postman has been outfitted with packing tape and cardboard wings to become the city zoo&#x27;s new penguin.

<doc id="1023045" wikidata="Q5647478" url="?curid=1023045" title="Handled the ball">
<text>Handled the ball was formerly one of the methods of dismissing a batter in the sport of cricket, but was integrated into the Law on obstructing the field when the Laws of Cricket were rewritten in 2017. It dictated that either batter can be given out if they intentionally touch the ball with a hand that is not holding their bat. An exception was given if the batter handled the ball to avoid injury. It was governed by Law 33 of the 2000 Edition of the Laws, and was a rare way for a batter to be dismissed: in the history of cricket, there have been 61 instances in first-class matches and 5 occasions in List A games. In most cases this occurred when a batter thought that the ball was going to hit their wicket, and knocked it away from the stumps with their hand.

In international cricket, only ten dismissals have been in this fashion; on seven occasions in Test cricket and three times in One Day Internationals. The South African Russell Endean became the first victim of this method in international cricket when he was dismissed in a 1957 Test match against England. The final occurrence was in an ODI in 2015, when Chamu Chibhabha of Zimbabwe was given out against Afghanistan national cricket team. After the rebranding of the law, Mushfiqur Rahim handled the ball in a test match against New Zealand. On appeal, he was given out &#x27;Obstructing the field&#x27;.

== Definition ==
Handled the ball was Law 33 in the &quot;Laws of Cricket&quot; established by the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). A batter could be given out for handling the ball if, while playing a delivery, the batter intentionally touched the ball with one or both of their hands not holding the bat. A decision of not out would be reached if the batter handled the ball to avoid incurring an injury. A bowler did not receive credit for the wicket when a batter was dismissed in this fashion.

== History ==
As a method of dismissal, handling the ball was included in the Laws of Cricket from the original code, written in 1744. In that document, it stated that &quot;If ye Striker touches or takes up ye Ball before she is lain quite still, unless asked by ye Bowler or Wicket-keeper, its out.&quot; Similar wording remained in the revision made to the laws thirty years later. The first batter to be dismissed for handling the ball in first-class cricket was James Grundy, who suffered the fate while playing for the MCC against Kent in 1857. Prior to 1899, a batter could be given out for handling the ball even if they were doing so to remove a ball which had got stuck in their equipment or clothing. At the time, if one of the fielders removed the ball from the batter&#x27;s clothing, they could claim a catch. It was in such a situation that George Bennett, the first player to be given out handled the ball in English county cricket, was dismissed in 1872. The wicket of William Scotton in early 1887 was described by Gerald Brodribb as &quot;most unusual&quot;. In a match between the smokers and the non-smokers involved in the 1886–87 Ashes series, Scotton faced the final delivery of the contest. Eager to claim the ball as a souvenir of the high-scoring match, he defended the delivery and picked the ball up. The fielders—who also wanted the souvenir—appealed, and Scotton was ruled out.

An addition was made to the law in 1950 to allow umpires to give a batter not out if the ball should strike the hand after &quot;an involuntary action by the striker in the throwing up of a hand to protect his person&quot;. For a time, the act of handing the ball back to the fielding side was listed as not out under Law 33, and instead was considered to be part of a different method of dismissal: obstructing the field, covered in Law 37. The illegal nature of this offence was later returned to Law 33, but reverted to Law 37 in 2013. In 1948 the MCC issued a reminder to batsman, advising them not to handle the ball for any reason at any point during a cricket match, but it is relatively common for batters to pick the ball up and return it to the fielding side. Charles Wright was the first player to be dismissed for returning the ball to a fielder in first-class cricket; albeit wrongly. Brodribb relates that in an 1893 match, W. G. Grace influenced Wright to return the ball to him, and upon doing so, appealed. The umpire dismissed Wright, despite a clause added to the law nine years previous stating that a batter would not be ruled out if they were returning the ball at the request of the fielding side.

In 2013, the law received a major change. Prior to this, there had been ambiguity in certain situations whether handling the ball or obstructing the field was applicable. This ambiguity was removed by setting a clear demarcation point between the two as the point when the striker has &quot;finished playing the ball&quot;: before this point, handling the ball applies; thereafter, obstructing the field applies. The result was that only the striker could be dismissed handled ball, and only during the short period when the striker was playing (or attempting to play) the ball, either as a first or subsequent stroke. The act of handing the ball back to the fielding side, mentioned above, was therefore no longer regarded as the striker playing the ball, resulting in this event then being dealt with under &quot;obstructing the field&quot;.

In March 2017 it was announced by the MCC that the law on handled the ball would be completely removed and subsumed into the law on obstructing the field. This means that the act of handling the ball will still result in the batter&#x27;s dismissal, but will now always be recorded as obstructing the field. The new law came into effect on 1 October 2017.

In total, there were 63 occasions on which a batter has been given out handled the ball in first-class cricket and 5 instances in List A cricket. Brodribb suggests that it is likely that there should have been a significant number more dismissals than there have been for handling the ball: in addition to the cases where batter have returned the ball to the fielding side without permission, there are records of cases in which the umpires have been reticent to uphold an appeal. On one such instance, the umpire David Constant rejected an appeal against Younis Ahmed, saying that he thought the appeal was not serious.

== Occasions in international cricket ==

The first occasion of a batter being given out handled the ball in international cricket occurred during a Test match between South Africa and England in Cape Town in 1957. In the second innings of the match, the South African Russell Endean padded away a delivery from Jim Laker. The ball looped off his pads into the air, and was falling towards his stumps until Endean instinctively knocked it away with his free hand. He later suggested that he had &quot;thought of heading it away, but that seemed too theatrical&quot;. The second instance came 22 years later during a bad-tempered series between Australia and Pakistan that also involved another rare dismissal method: Mankading. Andrew Hilditch was the victim in this match; he picked up the ball and returned it to the bowler after a wayward throw from a fielder. The bowler, Sarfraz Nawaz, appealed for the wicket and Hilditch was given out. Another Pakistan player, Asif Iqbal, distanced himself from the incident, commenting that he felt &quot;there was no need for us to stoop so low as to appeal against Hilditch&quot;. Hilditch&#x27;s dismissal marked the only time that a non-striking batter has been given out for handling the ball. The next case also occurred in another match between Australia and Pakistan. Mohsin Khan defended a delivery from Geoff Lawson, which then landed behind him. Mohsin pushed the ball away from the stumps with his hand, resulting in the wicket.

Desmond Haynes was the fourth man to be dismissed for handling the ball in Test cricket, just over a year after Mohsin. Facing India in late 1983, Haynes had been struck on the bat and pad by the ball, which then headed towards the stumps. The West Indian batter redirected the ball away from the stumps with his free hand. Upon being given out, Haynes—who was ignorant of the law regarding handling the ball—argued with the umpire about the dismissal. After asking the bowler, Kapil Dev, if he wanted to withdraw his appeal, the umpire sent Haynes back to the pavilion. The first instance in One Day Internationals was in 1986, when the Indian batter Mohinder Amarnath knocked away a turning delivery from Australia&#x27;s Greg Matthews that was heading for the stumps. In 1993, Graham Gooch became the only player to be dismissed for handling the ball after scoring a century. Playing defensively to try and draw the Test match against Australia, Gooch blocked a short ball from Merv Hughes. The ball flicked off his bat and fell towards his stumps, prompting Gooch to instinctively punch the ball away: Australia won the match by 179 runs.

The dismissal of Daryll Cullinan in 1999 was the second instance in ODIs: facing the West Indian spinner Keith Arthurton, Cullinan fended the ball off into the ground. It bounced high in the air, and Cullinan removed his right hand from his bat to catch it as it fell again. Despite the fact that it was unlikely that the ball would land near the stumps, the West Indies captain, Brian Lara, appealed, and Cullinan was dismissed. The next occurrence was two years later, in a Test match between Australia and India. In the first innings of the match, Steve Waugh was struck on the pads by a delivery from Harbhajan Singh. The umpire turned down the appeal, but as he did so, the ball bounced and spun towards the stumps. Waugh was alerted by a shout from the non-striking batsman, and instinctively swept the ball away with his free hand. The most recent instance came during the same year as Waugh&#x27;s dismissal, in another Test match involving India. England&#x27;s Michael Vaughan missed an attempted sweep against Sarandeep Singh, and the ball trickled along the ground after striking his pads. Vaughan brushed the ball away with his hand, despite the fact that it was not travelling towards the stumps. Initially, he claimed that he was attempting to give the ball back to the fielder at short leg, but he later admitted that he &quot;should have just held up [his] hands and said &#x27;I got it all wrong, I&#x27;m an idiot&#x27;&quot;.

<text>Rite of Passage is a science fiction novel by American writer Alexei Panshin. Published in 1968 as an Ace Science Fiction Special, this novel about a shipboard teenager&#x27;s coming of age won that year&#x27;s Nebula Award, and was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1969.

== Plot summary ==

&quot;Rite of Passage&quot; is told as a flashback by Mia Havero, the daughter of the Chairman of the Ship&#x27;s Council, after she has completed her own rite of passage, also known as &quot;Trial&quot;. She has survived for thirty days on a colony planet with minimal supplies as part of her initiation into adulthood on one of several giant Ships that survived Earth&#x27;s destruction in AD 2041. To prevent overpopulation on the Ships, family units can only produce children with the approval of the Ship&#x27;s Eugenics Council. The penalty for breaking this rule is exile to a colony world.

By the year 2198, Mia Havero is twelve years old and, like most of Ship-bound humanity, regards the colonists as &quot;Mudeaters&quot;, a derogatory reference to frontier life on a planet. When she accompanies her father on a trading mission to the planet Grainau, Mia learns from the children of a Grainau official that the feeling is mutual; many on the colony worlds call Ship people &quot;Grabbies&quot; because they take whatever goods they cannot produce on the Ships in return for knowledge and technology (doled out sparingly), the heritage of Earth to which the ship residents have laid claim and which colonists are unable to maintain, being too busy staying alive.

When Mia returns to the Ship, in addition to her regular studies, she joins a survival class. Survival class is every thirteen-year-old&#x27;s preparation for &quot;Trial&quot;, the Ships&#x27; rite of passage into adulthood required within three months of turning fourteen. By requiring adolescents to experience the rigors and dangers of life on a colony planet, the Ships hope to avoid stagnation and ensure that those who survive are skilled enough to contribute significantly to Ship life. However, the mortality rate of Trial participants is fairly high, so no expense is spared to train the adolescents about to go through Trial so that they will survive the month spent planetside.

Mia&#x27;s companion in school and in survival class is Jimmy Dentremont, a highly gifted boy of her own age. Their initial rivalry turns to friendship and eventually blossoms into love. Both in and out of survival class, sometimes with Jimmy and sometimes with other children, Mia has a series of adventures that build her confidence, broaden her world, and prepare her for &quot;Trial&quot;. Her moral awareness also grows during this time, both through formal study of ethical theory and through reflection on the errors she inevitably makes as she risks new experiences.

Shortly after her fourteenth birthday, Mia and her class are dispatched to the planet Tintera to undergo their &quot;Trial&quot;. Having quarreled with Jimmy, Mia refuses to team with him, but still chooses the &quot;tiger&quot; strategy over the &quot;turtle&quot; strategy; that is, she chooses to act on this world rather than hide out for the month that she&#x27;s on planet. Mia soon encounters a party of rough men on horseback, who are herding &quot;Losels&quot;, native humanoids the Tinterans treat as domestic animals and use for simple labor, although they may be intelligent enough to be considered slaves. Mia escapes the Losel herders&#x27; attempted kidnapping, and when she reaches the nearest town, she is repulsed by the fact that all Tinterans are &quot;Free Birthers&quot;—they have no population control. She is also disturbed by their apparent practice of enslaving Losels.

After a second run-in with the Losel herders leaves Mia badly beaten and robbed of the signalling device she will need to return to her Ship, she is rescued by Daniel Kutsov, an old man who has been reduced to a simple, manual job as a result of past political activity. Kutsov treats Mia like an adopted grandchild and explains to Mia that her speech gives her away as being from the Ships. Kutsov tells Mia that Ship people are at best regarded with resentment, and at worst killed. Mia has already learned that the Tinterans have captured a scoutship from another Ship and arrested one of her fellow &quot;Trial&quot; participants. While recovering from her injuries in Kutsov&#x27;s house, she discovers that the prisoner is Jimmy Dentremont. Singlehanded, Mia stages a jailbreak and escapes to the wilderness with Jimmy, but not before the two witness the brutal killing of Kutsov in a roundup of political dissidents.

Riding through the night in the pouring rain, Mia and Jimmy set up a tent in the woods. While in the tent, they realize their feelings for each other and have sex. They arrive the following day at the military headquarters for the territory, where Jimmy retrieves his own signalling device. Before they leave the base, they also disable the captured scoutship.

Soon after Mia and Jimmy return from &quot;Trial&quot;, a Shipwide Assembly debates what to do about Tintera. The Tinterans are Free Birthers, possibly slavers, and a potential danger to the Ship itself. As Mia hears the Assembly&#x27;s debate, however, she understands that her views have changed. Her moral world has broadened to include the Tinterans as people, rather than faceless &quot;spear carriers&quot; to be used and discarded. Thus she cannot bring herself to condemn the Tinterans &quot;en masse&quot;. However, under the leadership of Mia&#x27;s father, who perceives the Tinterans as beyond re-education, the Assembly votes by an eight-to-five margin to destroy Tintera in the name of &#x27;moral discipline&#x27;. Mia and Jimmy, as adults, prepare to settle into their own living quarters on board Ship. Jimmy offers the hope that they will someday be in a position to change their society.

==Reception==
Algis Budrys praised &quot;Rite of Passage&quot; as an &quot;intensely believable, movingly personalized story,&quot; saying that &quot;each of the little, perfectly realized steps&quot; in the story &quot;is so perfectly done that one feels a real shock as one realizes that Panshin after all has never been a girl growing up aboard a hollowed-out planetoid.&quot; James Blish also received the novel favorably, saying &quot;[T]his is not just another starship book, but a fully realized, lived-in world. I found the novel a little long and slow-moving for my taste, but I was charmed by its heroine. . . . [E]ven the slow slow sections were a pleasure to read&quot;.

Aldiss and Wingrove, however, declared that the novel &quot;lacks the spark of life which might have fired its interesting subject matter . . . For all its craft and its attempt to create an intelligent updating of a Heinlein juvenile, it proves tiresome rather than inspired.&quot;

== Themes ==

The theme of generational conflict was timely in the novel&#x27;s year of publication, 1968. Long-lived adults form the overwhelming majority of the population aboard Mia&#x27;s ship. Although they are generally benevolent and trustworthy, the society they have created appears complacent and aimless. Just as Mia must escape from the self-imposed limits of her shipboard “quad” if she is to survive &quot;Trial&quot; and achieve adulthood, it seems that the society of the Ship will have to escape its comfortable routine of drifting from planet to planet if it is ever to make use of the heritage it preserves.

The coming of age theme is dramatized through the events of Mia&#x27;s &quot;Trial&quot;, a rite of passage that ensures her adulthood will be earned and meaningful. The theme is artfully elaborated in three folktales that appear in the narrative: “Bright Sam and Charming Ned,” told by a young scoutship pilot; “The Lady of Carlisle,” told by Mia herself; and a third tale (reduced at the editor&#x27;s behest to a brief summary) told by Daniel Kutsov. All three feature young people who face tests of courage or resourcefulness.

The ethical discussions in the novel are at an elementary level, as is appropriate for a teenage narrator. Mia&#x27;s final moral stance is broadly Kantian (Kant is the only philosopher she mentions by name) in that it demands respect for the personhood of others and forbids treating others as mere means. Mia&#x27;s moral maturity comes with her recognition that “the universe is filled with &quot;people&quot;, and there is not a single solitary spear carrier among them.”

Many classic science fiction novels end with the destruction of an entire planet and its inhabitants. Typically, as in the Skylark and Lensman novels of E. E. “Doc” Smith, such destruction is presented as a starkly necessary defense against alien beings who are incorrigibly dangerous or evil. &quot;Rite of Passage&quot; departs from this tradition by condemning the destruction of Tintera as an act that no one, in principle, could ever have the right to commit.

In the Ship&#x27;s Assembly, the proposal to destroy Tintera is debated in the context of an ongoing political controversy over what, if anything, the Ships owe to the planetary colonists. Mia&#x27;s father takes the position that the colonists will do best if they learn to fend for themselves and not expect aid from the Ships. Mia and Jimmy&#x27;s mentor, Joseph Mbele, believes that the Ships have an obligation to assist the colonists by sharing their knowledge, which Daniel Kutsov says is the heritage of all who survived the destruction of Earth. Both sides of the debate receive a respectful hearing at various places in the novel, and neither is presented as indisputably correct, but by the end of her story Mia has clearly come around to the view that the Ships have an obligation to the colonies.

Many of these themes appear in three other Panshin stories set in the same fictional future: “The Sons of Prometheus” (&quot;Analog&quot;, 1966), “A Sense of Direction” (&quot;Amazing&quot;, 1969), and “Arpad” (&quot;Quark 2&quot;, 1971). In “Arpad” there is a brief cameo appearance by Mia and Jimmy. All three stories are collected in Panshin&#x27;s &quot;Farewell to Yesterday’s Tomorrow&quot; (Berkley, 1975).

<text>Beurre noisette (, literally: hazelnut butter, loosely: brown butter) is a type of warm sauce used in French cuisine. It can accompany savoury foods, such as winter vegetables, pasta, fish, omelettes, and chicken. It has become a popular ingredient in other cultures as well, such as in contemporary American cuisine or the traditional American chocolate chip cookie. It is widely used in making French pastry. It has a deep yellow, almost brown, colour and a nutty scent and flavour from the heating process.

== Preparation ==
When unsalted butter is melted over low heat and allowed to separate into butterfat and milk solids, the latter naturally sink to the bottom of the pan and, if left warming over gentle heat, will begin to cook slightly and turn a deep brown color. As they reach a toasty hazelnut colour, the pan is removed from the heat. The result is called &quot;beurre noisette&quot;, or brown butter.

&quot;Beurre noisette&quot; may be used in its liquid state as a flavorful addition to many foods or cooled into a solid form. It has a nutty flavour and is particularly included in the batters for &quot;madeleines&quot; and &quot;financiers&quot;.

If &quot;beurre noisette&quot; is not mixed after preparation, but separated to the firm (protein) and liquid (fat) components, the latter is the type of clarified butter known as &quot;ghee&quot; in South Asia and &quot;samna&quot; in the Middle East countries.

<doc id="1023065" wikidata="Q688222" url="?curid=1023065" title="PrivatAir">
<text>Privatair [[S.A. (corporation)|SA]] was a Swiss airline headquartered in Meyrin, which operated business jets as well as scheduled services on behalf of major airlines. In addition the company operated crew and pilot training facilities. PrivatAir SA was a registered air carrier with two air operator&#x27;s certificates, in Switzerland and through its subsidiary PrivatAir GmbH in Germany. On 5 December 2018, PrivatAir filed for insolvency and ceased operations.

== History ==
PrivatAir was founded in 1977 as a corporate flying division of the Latsis family under the name Petrolair. In 1979, air traffic began on a Boeing 737-200 and offered business travel flights. In 1989, a Boeing 757 and a Gulfstream IV were added, and the name was changed to PrivatAir. On June 1, 1995, the company was then licensed by the Swiss Federal Office of Civil Aviation as a commercial airline.

In March 2001 the PrivatAir Group was formed. Also in March 2001, the PrivatAir Group gained ETOPS 180 minutes and FAA 129 Foreign Carrier approval as a designated carrier under the US-Switzerland bilateral &quot;open skies&quot; agreement. These approvals allow the company to offer the most direct routes across the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and unlimited operations to the US. At the time, PrivatAir was the only ad hoc commercial charter operator in the world with these approvals.

In February 2002, PrivatAir completed the construction of its private terminal in Geneva, where its headquarters were then based. The new &quot;C3&quot; terminal was a joint venture between PrivatAir and Geneva International Airport and offered VIP passenger services to PrivatAir&#x27;s customers. The corporate jet alliance AirClub was founded in Geneva in October 2012. In 2018 AirClub had eight members aside PrivatAir: ACM Air Charter, Air Alsie, Air Hamburg, Corporatejets, FLYINGGROUP, GlobeAir, London Executive Aviation and Masterjet.

In May 2003, PrivatAir and Swissport created the joint company PrivatPort, which is an executive-jet handling business. In October 2003, German subsidiary PrivatAir Germany GmbH, Düsseldorf, gained JAR – 145 approval from the German civil aviation authority, giving the company more autonomy and flexibility within the framework of its operations on behalf of Lufthansa and Airbus.

In November 2016, the majority of the company (51%) was taken over by the British investment company SilverArrow Capital.

In October 2018, the German aviation authorities suspended the licence of PrivatAir&#x27;s German subsidiary. On 5 December 2018, PrivatAir announced the end of operations and filed for insolvency for both its Swiss and German business units, citing negative commercial developments.

== Company overview ==

PrivatAir was made up of three divisions: &quot;Scheduled Services&quot;, &quot;Business Aviation&quot; which included aircraft management, charter, sales and &quot;PrivatTraining&quot;:

*PrivatAir specialised in scheduled and charter flights using mid-sized, long-range jets. Its main base is Geneva Airport and its contracted operational bases depend of the current scheduled operations contracts, e. g. Frankfurt Airport operating for Lufthansa.
*PrivatAir&#x27;s Business Aviation department provided service covering Aircraft Management, Aircraft Sales &amp; Acquisitions, Aircraft Charter, AirClub (corporate jet alliance), PrivatJetFuel (Fuel Management) and Ground Services (PrivatPort).
*PrivatTraining was an in-house training department focusing on safety, security and service in the industry. They also provide training programmes for private-jet operators, to help them fulfil regulatory obligations.

==Operations==
Aside from private and corporate charter services, PrivatAir also operated its aircraft on behalf of different international airlines on a long-term basis for scheduled flights.

From June 2002 to June 2008, Privatair operated on behalf of Lufthansa a non-stop transatlantic service from Düsseldorf to Newark near New York City. To record, this was the first transatlantic flight which took off exclusively with Business Class. For this purpose the German subsidiary PrivatAir GmbH with legal seat in Duesseldorf, Germany was created, which operated not only the four Airbus in own responsibility, but was responsible for all maintenance of the group airplanes. In addition the company added three Boeing business jets.

From 2003 to 2008, PrivatAir carried out charter traffic for Airbus between the plants in Hamburg-Finkenwerder and Toulouse. This was subsequently taken over by OLT Express Germany. PrivatAir also operated a variety of other regular scheduled flights on behalf major airlines such as Lufthansa from Frankfurt to Pune and Nairobi and for Saudia on domestic services.

In April 2015, Lufthansa announced it would reduce their involvement with PrivatAir with the route from Frankfurt to Dammam to be shut down by the end of October 2015. PrivatAir also operated flights to Libreville, Pointe-Noire, Accra, Bahrain and Tel Aviv on behalf of Lufthansa; these routes were all terminated a few years earlier. A route operated for Lufthansa to Nairobi ended on 31 August 2016. PrivatAir also operated aircraft on behalf of ECAir based at Maya-Maya Airport until 10 October 2016, when ECAir suspended its operations.

Between March 2016 and October 2017, PrivatAir operated a Boeing 737 on behalf of Scandinavian Airlines between Copenhagen and Boston.

As of 2017, PrivatAir also operated on selected routes for companies such as TUI fly Deutschland and Eurowings on leisure routes from Germany after the collapse of Air Berlin. In July 2018, Lufthansa suspended its route between Frankfurt and Pune, India which had been served by PrivatAir for several years. The route resumed in autumn 2018, however operated by Lufthansa&#x27;s own aircraft.

==Fleet==
As of December 2018, the joint PrivatAir fleet registered in Switzerland and Germany consisted of the following aircraft. Additionally, PrivatAir operated several business jets from Dassault, Bombardier and Gulfstream.

PrivatAir previously also operated more and a wider range of aircraft including Boeing 757 and 767s.

<text>Freddie Joe Ward (December 30, 1942 – May 8, 2022) was an American character actor. Starting with a role in an Italian television movie in 1973, he appeared in such diverse films as &quot;Escape from Alcatraz&quot;, &quot;Southern Comfort&quot;, &quot;The Right Stuff&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins&quot;, &quot;Tremors&quot; and &quot;Tremors 2: Aftershocks&quot;, &quot;Henry &amp; June&quot;, &quot;The Player&quot;, &quot;Swing Shift&quot;, &quot;Short Cuts&quot;, and &quot;30 Minutes or Less&quot;.

==Early life==
Freddie Joe Ward was born in San Diego on December 30, 1942. He was part Cherokee. His father was an alcoholic criminal who was repeatedly imprisoned and his mother left him when Fred was three. He was then raised by his grandmother until his mother had rebuilt her life and remarried a carnival worker. Before acting, Ward spent three years in the United States Air Force. He was also a boxer (breaking his nose three times) and worked as a lumberjack in Alaska, a janitor, and a short-order cook. He studied acting at New York&#x27;s Herbert Berghof Studio after serving in the U.S. Air Force. While living in Rome, he dubbed Italian movies into English and appeared in films by neorealist director Roberto Rossellini.

==Career==

=== 1970s ===
Ward became an actor after studying at Herbert Berghof Studio and in Rome. While in Italy, he worked as a mime. Upon returning stateside in the early 1970s, Ward spent time working in experimental theatre and doing some television work. He made his first American film appearance playing a cowboy in &quot;Hearts of the West&quot; (1975). His first major role came in the Clint Eastwood vehicle &quot;Escape from Alcatraz&quot; (1979) as fellow escapee John Anglin.

===1980s===
Ward played a violent National Guardsman in Walter Hill&#x27;s &quot;Southern Comfort&quot; (1981). His first starring role in a motion picture was &quot;&quot; (1982). He then starred as astronaut Gus Grissom in &quot;The Right Stuff&quot;, in the action movie &quot;Uncommon Valor&quot; with Gene Hackman, and in the drama &quot;Silkwood&quot; (all 1983).

After co-starring roles in &quot;Swing Shift&quot; (1984) and &quot;Secret Admirer&quot; (1985), Ward played the title hero in the action movie &quot;Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins&quot;, which was directed by Guy Hamilton. The film was supposed to be the first of a series based on &quot;The Destroyer&quot; series of novels. Though the movie was well promoted and he appeared on several movie magazine covers, it only grossed $15 million.

Ward played in a few low-budget productions until he returned to major cinema in 1988 as a cop in &quot;Off Limits&quot;, as Roone Dimmick in &quot;Big Business&quot;, and the father of Keanu Reeves&#x27; character in &quot;The Prince of Pennsylvania&quot;.

=== 1990s ===
In 1990, Ward starred as Earl Bassett in the monster movie &quot;Tremors&quot;, as the American erotic writer Henry Miller in &quot;Henry &amp; June&quot; (with Uma Thurman), and as cop Hoke Moseley in his self-produced &quot;Miami Blues&quot; (with Alec Baldwin and Jennifer Jason Leigh). That year he also played an FBI agent in Dennis Hopper&#x27;s film &quot;Catchfire&quot;.

After playing private detective H.P. Lovecraft in the 1991 HBO film &quot;Cast a Deadly Spell&quot; alongside Julianne Moore, Ward co-starred in the thriller &quot;Thunderheart&quot;, the Hollywood satire &quot;The Player&quot;, the mystery-drama &quot;Equinox&quot; and the TV western-comedy &quot;Four Eyes and Six Guns&quot;, for which he won a Cable ACE Award. He also did a cameo in &quot;Bob Roberts&quot;, starring Tim Robbins.

Ward&#x27;s leading roles include Lt. Brann in the two-character-thriller &quot;Two Small Bodies&quot;, fisherman Stuart Kane in the Robert Altman film &quot;Short Cuts&quot; (for which the whole ensemble won a Golden Globe; both 1993), a dangerous criminal in the comedy &quot;Naked Gun : The Final Insult&quot; (1994), the sailor in the French-avant-garde-drama &quot;The Blue Villa&quot; (1995), his reprised role in &quot;Tremors II: Aftershocks&quot; and the special agent in &quot;Chain Reaction&quot; (both 1996). He also appeared as Sheriff Bud Phillips in &quot;Best Men&quot;, as Dave Reimüller in &quot;...First Do No Harm&quot; with Meryl Streep (both 1997) and as Domenico Venier in &quot;Dangerous Beauty&quot; (1998).

=== 2000s ===
Ward was seen in many motion pictures, TV shows and videos in 2000. He starred in the action-thriller &quot;The Chaos Factor&quot; and appeared in the gangster movie &quot;Circus&quot;, the teen movie &quot;Road Trip&quot; and the horror sequel &quot;The Crow: Salvation&quot;.

In 2001, Ward was nominated for a Video Premiere Award as the best male actor for the direct-to-video-production &quot;Full Disclosure&quot;. He also co-starred in &quot;Joe Dirt&quot;, &quot;Summer Catch&quot;, &quot;Wild Iris&quot;, the mini-TV-series &quot;Dice&quot; and the comedic &quot;Corky Romano&quot;.

In 2002, Ward appeared in &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot;, &quot;Enough&quot; and &quot;Abandon&quot;. He had the starring role in &quot;Birdseye&quot; and signed in for the TV pilot for the drama &quot;Georgetown&quot; with Helen Mirren, but the series was never made. After roles in &quot;The Last Ride&quot;, &quot;10.5&quot; and &quot;Coast to Coast&quot; (all 2004) he took a short break from acting and returned as a guest in the TV series &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; and &quot;ER&quot; (2006 and 2007). He was next in the ensemble drama &quot;Feast of Love&quot;, the thriller &quot;Exit Speed&quot;, &quot;Management&quot; with Jennifer Aniston, &quot;The Wild Stallion&quot; DVD and as the boss Ashcroft in &quot;Armored&quot;.

Ward guest starred as Ronald Reagan in the French political thriller &quot;L&#x27;affaire Farewell&quot; (2009). He appeared in &quot;30 Minutes or Less&quot;, guest starred in the TV series &quot;United States of Tara&quot;, &quot;In Plain Sight&quot; and &quot;Leverage&quot; in 2012. In 2013, he had a guest role in &quot;2 Guns&quot; starring Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg.

==Personal life and death==
Ward married Marie-France Boisselle in 1995. They resided in Los Angeles. He had one son, Django Ward, a singer and guitarist, from his previous marriage to Silvia Ward.

Ward and his wife Marie-France both filed for divorce in August 2013, but they reconciled later that year.

Ward died on May 8, 2022, at the age of 79.

<doc id="1023076" wikidata="Q5381364" url="?curid=1023076" title="Environmental stewardship (England)">
<text>Environmental Stewardship is an agri-environment scheme run by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in England which aims to secure widespread environmental benefits. It was formally launched on 18 March 2005, although the first agreements did not start until 1 August 2005.

If Environment Stewardship is taken up across large areas of the countryside it will help to:
* Improve water quality and reduce soil erosion – by encouraging management which can help to meet these aims;
* Improve conditions for farmland wildlife – including birds, mammals, butterflies and bees;
* Maintain and enhance landscape character – by helping to maintain important features such as traditional field boundaries;
* Protect the historic environment – including archaeological features and artefacts.

The scheme, which replaces the older Countryside Stewardship and Environmentally Sensitive Area schemes, is composed of two levels: the Entry Level Stewardship (ELS), Organic Entry Level Stewardship (OELS) for Organic farms, Upland Entry Level Stewardship (UELS) comprising the lower levels; and the Higher Level Stewardship (HLS) for the upper level.

==Introduction==
Entry Level Stewardship aims to encourage large numbers of farmers and land managers (hereafter referred to as &#x27;applicants&#x27;) across England to deliver simple yet effective environmental management that goes beyond the Single Payment Scheme (SPS) requirement to maintain land in &quot;Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition&quot;.

Payouts are from £30/hectare for Entry Level Stewardship to £60/hectare for Organic ELS, and last either five or ten years. The scheme is non-competitive and payments awarded if the threshold 30 points per hectare is achieved when averaged over the farm.

Applicants are able to choose from a wide range of options (e.g. hedgerow management, low input grassland, buffer strips, management plans and options to protect soils), covering all farming types. Each option will earn &#x27;points&#x27; (e.g. 100 points per hectare) towards their points total.

==Applications==

When applying for ELS, applicants will first have to prepare a simple record of features on their farm called the Farm Environment Record (FER). This is done using the Farm Environment Record map supplied by RDS.
When they request their pre-filled application form and maps they are also given a ‘points target’ related to their farm size. There is no minimum holding size for entry into ELS.
Applicants have the flexibility to decide how much of each option to have, and where to put them, until they have chosen enough to reach their ‘points target’. They need to mark the location of some of these options on the Options map provided by RDS. If they agree to deliver enough ELS options to meet their points target they will be guaranteed entry into the scheme.

In applying for, and being accepted into, ELS they agree to:
a) identify, map and retain their FER features;
b) deliver the options selected in their application form in accordance with the management requirements; and
c) adhere to all the scheme terms and conditions contained in the ELS handbook, and in particular to follow Good Farming Practice throughout their farm, and to comply with the other additional requirements.

==Entry Level Stewardship==
Anyone who owns, farms or manages agricultural land can apply to take out an ELS agreement by contacting the appropriate regional office of Natural England by letter or phone. Online applications for ELS are also available.

Applicants for an ELS agreement will receive a scheme handbook in addition to the application pack. The handbook details the options for management that the applicant can choose to apply on their land. Each option carries a points score, either per agreement (for example for completing the mandatory Farm Environment Record (FER)), per hectare (e.g. grassland management), per metre (e.g. hedgerow management) or per feature (e.g. in-field trees). The scheme is non-competitive, so provided the grand total of the points is at least equal to 30 points per hectare averaged over the farm (i.e. for a 100 hectare farm 3000 points are required) then the application will become an agreement. All agreements are paid at a flat rate of £30 per hectare per year, and last 5 years.

The schemes have undergone several revisions since their inception.

==Organic Entry Level Stewardship==
This is very similar in nature to the Entry Level Scheme, except that it covers organic land only. Most of the options are the same in ELS and OELS, but some that are not appropriate (e.g. reduced artificial fertiliser inputs) are omitted. Like ELS the agreements last 5 years, but OELS land is paid at £60/hectare. It is possible to combine OELS with regular ELS on farms with a mixture of organic and conventionally farmed land.

==Higher Level Stewardship==
As the name suggests this is more targeted than (O)ELS, and not all land is eligible. It is designed to offer more support to more active and environmentally beneficial management practices. Unlike ELS it also offers grants for capital works, such as the restoration of traditional farm buildings. All Higher Level Stewardship (HLS) agreements must be underpinned with basic management from an ELS or OELS agreement, but in contrast to these schemes the agreement lasts 10 years. All agreements start at one of four start dates at three-monthly intervals through the year. The first HLS agreements started on 1 February 2006. There was a delay in the launch of HLS as a result of problems with the department&#x27;s computer system, &quot;Genesis&quot;, built by Atos Origin.

The application procedure is basically the same as for ELS but, due to the added complexity and competitiveness of the scheme and its highly targeted nature, a visit from a Natural England advisor is required. The payment received for HLS agreements is dependent on the precise options chosen, rather than a flat rate.

==Upland Entry Level Stewardship==

Is a new scheme following the same format as the entry level stewardship schemes. It was launched in 2010, with the first agreements running from 1 July 2010. It replaced the &#x27;Hill Farm Allowance Scheme&#x27;, a DEFRA and RPA run scheme.

==Management options covered by the ELS, OELS, HLS and UELS schemes==

* Hedgerow maintenance options. Important for wildlife as shelter and a food source for animals, for example small birds, dormice. A historic and cultural landscape feature, acting as a barrier to livestock. Hedgerows can also act as pollinators for orchard trees, the nectar and pollen also being of benefit to invertebrates such as bees. The management options encourage the practice of trimming the hedgerows less frequently, to allow them to grow, thicken, and bear fruit. There are other requirements such as not trimming during the bird breeding season so that the nesting birds are not disturbed, and not applying fertiliser or pesticides within 2 metres of them, to encourage wildlife biodiversity. The growth and protection of hedgerow trees is also encouraged under these options.
* Dry stone walling maintenance options. Important for similar reasons to hedgerows, including habitat for lichen, mosses and ferns.
* In field trees. Important habitat for animals, lichen etc. Even if the tree is dead it can offer habitat for birds and bats. Management options include not cultivating under the canopy of the tree, which helps to protect its roots.
* Woodland. Options to encourage structural diversity within and at the edges as many wildlife cannot tolerate a simple structure. Also options to let light into the woodland to help the understory develop.
* Historical orchard maintenance and creation.
* Archaeological sites, traditional farmland buildings and designed landscapes such as parkland. Options to help protect and in the case of the buildings and landscape, restore them.
* Buffer strips, field corners, beetle banks and field margins. Uncultivated grass areas, without fertiliser or pesticide application, these offer the growth of habitat for wildlife. They are also used to buffer watercourses, ponds or wild habitat from adjacent fields from intensive agricultural operations.
* Bird seed and nectar bearing crops. The latter for nectar feeding insects such as bees and butterflies.
* Options to encourage the stubble of harvested crops to be left over winter. This provides a winter food source for seed-eating birds, from spilt grain and the seeds of broadleaved weeds. They are also a habitat for brown hares, and early breeding site for ground-nesting birds such as lapwing and curlew.
* Where a winter crop is sown, there is an option to create unsown areas. These are beneficial to skylark birds that nest in vegetation less than 50 cm high.
* Prevention of soil erosion from converting steep slope arable land to grassland, and growing maize crops during the summer.
* Reducing or eliminating fertiliser and pesticide inputs on grassland and arable land, to increase species diversity.
* Maintaining and creating species rich grassland
* Encouraging mixed stock, e.g. sheep and cattle in the same field to encourage species diversity. This is because they graze to different levels, have different trampling effects, and their faeces can attract invertebrates.
* Access footpaths and payments for educational tours around farms.
* Maintenance and creation of ponds

==Objectives==
Environmental Stewardship has a number of wide-ranging objectives, which include:

*Protection of water and soil
*Prevention of erosion and water pollution
*Flood management
*Wildlife conservation
*Protect archaeological sites and historic features
*Provide public access to the countryside
*Conserve rare traditional livestock breeds and varieties

<text>Human resource management (HRM) is the strategic and coherent approach to the effective and efficient management of people in a company or organization such that they help their business gain a competitive advantage. It is designed to maximize employee performance in service of an employer&#x27;s strategic objectives. Human resource management is primarily concerned with the management of people within organizations, focusing on policies and systems. HR departments are responsible for overseeing employee-benefits design, employee recruitment, training and development, performance appraisal, and reward management, such as managing pay and employee benefits systems. HR also concerns itself with organizational change and industrial relations, or the balancing of organizational practices with requirements arising from collective bargaining and governmental laws.

The overall purpose of human resources (HR) is to ensure that the organization can achieve success through people. HR professionals manage the human capital of an organization and focus on implementing policies and processes. They can specialize in finding, recruiting, selecting, training, and developing employees, as well as maintaining employee relations or benefits. Training and development professionals ensure that employees are trained and have continuous development. This is done through training programs, performance evaluations, and reward programs. Employee relations deals with the concerns of employees when policies are broken, such as in cases involving harassment or discrimination. Managing employee benefits includes developing compensation structures, parental leave programs, discounts, and other benefits. On the other side of the field are HR generalists or business partners. These HR professionals could work in all areas or be labour relations representatives working with unionized employees.

HR is a product of the human relations movement of the early 20th century when researchers began documenting ways of creating business value through the strategic management of the workforce. It was initially dominated by transactional work, such as payroll and benefits administration, but due to globalization, company consolidation, technological advances, and further research, HR focuses on strategic initiatives like mergers and acquisitions, talent management, succession planning, industrial and labor relations, and diversity and inclusion. In the global work environment, most companies focus on lowering employee turnover and on retaining the talent and knowledge held by their workforce.
== History ==

===Precedent theoretical developments===
The human resources field began to take shape in 19th century Europe. It is built on a simple idea by Robert Owen (1771–1858) and Charles Babbage (1791–1871) during the Industrial Revolution. These men concluded that people were crucial to the success of an organization. They expressed the thought that well-being of employees led to perfect work; without healthy workers, the organization would not survive.

HR emerged as a specific field in the early 20th century, influenced by Frederick Winslow Taylor (1856–1915). Taylor explored what he termed &quot;scientific management&quot; (sometimes referred to as &quot;Taylorism&quot;), striving to improve economic efficiency in manufacturing jobs. He eventually focused on one of the principal inputs into the manufacturing process—labor—sparking inquiry into workforce productivity.

Meanwhile, in London C S Myers inspired by unexpected problems among soldiers who alarmed generals and politicians. During First World War 1914–1918, co-founded the National Institute of Industrial Psychology (NIIP) in 1921. He set seeds for the human relations movement, this movement, on both sides of the Atlantic, built on the research of Elton Mayo (1880–1949) and others to document through the Hawthorne studies (1924–1932) and other studies how stimuli, unrelated to financial compensation and working conditions, could yield more productive workers.
Work by Abraham Maslow (1908–1970), Kurt Lewin (1890–1947), Max Weber (1864–1920), Frederick Herzberg (1923–2000), and David McClelland (1917–1998), forming the basis for studies in industrial and organizational psychology, organizational behavior and organizational theory, was interpreted in such a way as to further claims of legitimacy for an applied discipline.

===Birth and development of the discipline===
By the time there was enough theoretical evidence to make a business case for strategic workforce management, changes in the business landscape—à la Andrew Carnegie (1835–1919) and John Rockefeller (1839–1937)—and in public policy—à la Sidney (1859–1947) and Beatrice Webb (1858–1943), Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal of 1933 to 1939—had transformed employer-employee relationships, and the HRM discipline became formalized as &quot;industrial and labor relations&quot;. In 1913 one of the oldest known professional HR associations—the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD)—started in England as the Welfare Workers&#x27; Association; it changed its name a decade later to the Institute of Industrial Welfare Workers, and again the next decade to Institute of Labour Management before settling upon its current name in 2000. From 1918 the early Soviet state institutions began to implement a distinct ideological HRM focus
alongside technical management—first in the Red Army (through political commissars alongside military officers), later (from 1933) in work sites more generally (through partorg posts alongside conventional managers).

In 1920, James R. Angell delivered an address to a conference on personnel research in Washington detailing the need for personnel research. This preceded and led to the organization of the Personnel Research Federation. In 1922 the first volume of &quot;The Journal of Personnel Research&quot; was published, a joint initiative between the National Research Council and the Engineering Foundation. Likewise in the United States, the world&#x27;s first institution of higher education dedicated to workplace studies—the School of Industrial and Labor Relations—formed at Cornell University in 1945. In 1948 what would later become the largest professional HR association—the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM)—formed as the American Society for Personnel Administration (ASPA).

In the Soviet Union, Stalin&#x27;s use of patronage exercised through the &quot;HR Department&quot; equivalent in the Bolshevik Party, its Orgburo, demonstrated the effectiveness and influence of human-resource policies and practices,
and Stalin himself acknowledged the importance of the human resource,
exemplified in his mass deployment of it, as in the five-year plans and in the Gulag system.

During the latter half of the 20th century, union membership declined significantly,
while workforce-management specialists continued to expand their influence within organizations. In US, the phrase &quot;industrial and labor relations&quot; came into use to refer specifically to issues concerning collective representation, and many companies began referring to the proto-HR profession as &quot;personnel administration&quot;.
Many current HR practices originated with the needs of companies in the 1950s to develop and retain talent.

In the late 20th century, advances in transportation and communications greatly facilitated workforce mobility and collaboration. Corporations began viewing employees as assets. &quot;Human resources management&quot; consequently, became the dominant term for the function—the ASPA even changing its name to the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) in 1998.

&quot;Human capital management&quot; (HCM) is sometimes used synonymously with &quot;HR&quot;, although &quot;human capital&quot; typically refers to a narrower view of human resources; i.e. the knowledge the individuals embody and can contribute to an organization. Other terms sometimes used to describe the HRM field include &quot;organizational management&quot;, &quot;manpower management&quot;, &quot;talent management&quot;, &quot;personnel management&quot;, &quot;workforce management&quot;, and simply &quot;people management&quot;.

===In popular media===
Several popular media productions have depicted human resource management in operation. The U.S. television series &quot;The Office&quot;, HR representative Toby Flenderson is sometimes portrayed as a nag because he constantly reminds coworkers of company policies and government regulations.
Long-running American comic strip &quot;Dilbert&quot; frequently portrays sadistic HR policies through the character Catbert, the &quot;evil director of human resources&quot;. An HR manager is the title character in the 2010 Israeli film &quot;The Human Resources Manager&quot;, while an HR intern is the protagonist in 1999 French film &quot;Ressources humaines&quot;. The main character in the BBC sitcom &quot;dinnerladies&quot;, Philippa, is an HR manager. The protagonist of the Mexican telenovela &quot;Mañana es para siempre&quot; is a director of human resources. &quot;Up In the Air&quot; is centered on corporate &quot;downsizer&quot; Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) and his travels. As the film progresses, HR is portrayed as a data-driven function that deals with people as human resource metrics, which can lead to absurd outcomes for real people.

== Practice ==

=== Business function ===
Dave Ulrich lists the function of human resources as:

* Aligning human resource strategy and human resource metrics with business strategy
* Re-engineering organization processes
* Listening and responding to employees, and managing transformation and change.

At the macro level, HR is in charge of overseeing organizational leadership and culture. HR also ensures compliance with employment and labor laws and often oversees employee health, safety, and security. Labor laws may vary from one jurisdiction to the next. In a workplace administered by the federal government, HR managers may need to be familiar with certain crucial federal laws, in order to protect both their company and its employees. In the United States of America, important federal laws and regulations include:

# Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938: It establishes a minimum wage and protects the right of certain workers to earn overtime.
# Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972: It strengthens the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission&#x27;s authority to prevent and address workplace discrimination and prohibits employers from making hiring, firing, or employment decisions based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, or age.
# Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993: It allows eligible employees to take up to twelve weeks of unpaid leave for family and medical reasons while ensuring they can return to their job afterward.
# Immigration Reform and Control Act: It requires employers to verify the identity and employment eligibility of all employees, prohibits the hiring of unauthorized workers, and establishes penalties for employers who hire undocumented immigrants while protecting employees from discrimination based on nationality or citizenship.

An important responsibility of HR is to ensure that a company complies with all laws and regulations, thus protecting the company from legal liability. In circumstances where employees exercise their legal authorization to negotiate a collective bargaining agreement, HR will typically also serve as the company&#x27;s primary liaison with employee representatives (usually a labor union). Consequently, the HR industry lobbies governmental agencies (e.g., in the United States, the United States Department of Labor and the National Labor Relations Board) to advance its priorities.

===Functions of Human resource management===

# Staffing: The process of the recruitment and selection of employees through the use of interviews, applications and networking. Staffing involves two main factors. The first is to attract talented recruits who meet the organization&#x27;s requirements, and doing so by using tools such as mass media; the second is to manage hiring resources. Managers can use hiring resources to exercise different strategies. 
# Training and Development:It involves a continuous process of training and developing competent and adapted employees. Here, motivation is seen as key to keeping employees highly productive. This includes employee benefits, performance appraisals, and rewards. Employee benefits, appraisals, and rewards are all encouragements to bring forward the best employees.
# Maintenance: involves keeping the employees&#x27; commitment and loyalty to the organization. Managing for employee retention involves strategic actions to keep employees motivated and focused so they remain employed and fully productive for the benefit of the organization. Some businesses globalize and form more diverse teams. HR departments have the role of making sure that these teams can function and that people can communicate across cultures and across borders. The discipline may also engage in mobility management, especially for expatriates; and it is frequently involved in the merger and acquisition process. HR is generally viewed as a support function to the business, helping to minimize costs and reduce risk.

Other Activities:
* Talent Acquisition: focuses on the long-term strategic planning required to identify, attract, and hire the top talent necessary to meet the organization&#x27;s needs.
* Talent Recruitment: involves identifying, attracting, and hiring suitable candidates to fulfill specific job openings and meet business needs.
* Talent Management: helps organizations identify key positions vital for long-term success, develop a pool of high-potential employees to fill these roles, and establish a framework for managing performance, developing leaders, retaining talent, and fostering organizational commitment.
* Compensation and Benefits: design competitive compensation and benefits packages to attract and retain talent.
* Employee Relations: manage employee relations issues, such as conflict resolution, employee grievances, and workplace investigations.
* Training and Development: develop and implement training programs and professional development opportunities for their employees.
* Performance Management: a systematic process focused on enhancing organizational effectiveness by designing human resource metrics and implementing performance management systems. This approach provides employees with clear feedback on their performance outcomes and areas for improvement, ensuring active engagement that aligns with and supports the organization’s tactical and strategic goals.
* Legal Compliance: ensure that organizations are compliant with labor laws and regulations, including employment standards, workplace safety, and anti-discrimination policies.

In startup companies, trained professionals may perform HR duties. In larger companies, an entire functional group is typically dedicated to the discipline, with staff specializing in various HR tasks and functional leadership engaging in strategic decision-making across the business. To train practitioners for the profession, institutions of higher education, professional associations, and companies have established programs of study dedicated explicitly to the duties of the function. Academic and practitioner organizations may produce field-specific publications. HR is also a field of research study that is popular within the fields of management and industrial/organizational psychology.One of the important goal of HRM is establishing with the notion of &quot;unitarism&quot; (seeing a company as a cohesive whole, in which both employers and employees should work together for a common good) and securing a long-term partnership of employees and employers with common interests.

===Code of ethics===
Code of ethics provides a framework for ethical behavior and professional conduct in HRM. It ensures integrity, fairness, and responsibility. Its function is to guide HR professionals and departments in upholding the rights, safety, and interests of all stakeholders. They are generally categorized into the following:

# Duties to the Public: HR professionals must act ethically, lawfully, and with integrity. They should address illegal acts, uphold public trust, maintain competence, and engage in continuous professional development.
# Duties to the Profession: HR professionals must uphold the reputation of the profession by avoiding misconduct, adhering to ethical codes, promoting a positive image, and cooperating with investigations or disciplinary processes.
# Duties to Clients and Employers: HR professionals must prioritize the best interests of employers and clients, ensure impartiality, disclose conflicts of interest, maintain accurate records, and safeguard confidentiality.
# Duties to Individuals: HR professionals must advance dignity, equity, and safety for all. They should respect privacy, avoid discrimination or harassment, report imminent risks of harm, and foster an inclusive workplace.
# Overarching Duties: HR professionals must foster trust, respect, and fairness in all relationships. They must act impartially, comply with laws, promote diversity, and resolve disputes ethically and professionally.

== Modern HR practices ==
Technology has a significant impact on HR practices. Utilizing technology makes information more accessible within organizations, eliminates time doing administrative tasks, allows businesses to function globally, and cuts costs. The adoption of modern business practices and information technology has transformed HR practices in the following ways:

=== E-recruiting ===
Recruiting has mostly been influenced by information technology. In the past, recruiters relied on printing in publications and word of mouth to fill open positions. Human Resource professionals were not able to post a job in more than one location and did not have access to millions of people, causing the lead time of new hires to be drawn out and tiresome. With the use of e-recruiting tools, HR professionals can post jobs and track applicants for thousands of jobs in various locations all in one place. Interview feedback, background checks and drug tests, and onboarding can all be viewed online. This helps HR professionals keep track of all of their open jobs and applicants in a way that is faster and easier than before. E-recruiting also helps eliminate limitations of geographic location.

=== Human resources information systems ===
HR professionals generally handle large amounts of paperwork on a daily basis, ranging from department transfer requests to confidential employee tax forms. Forms must be on file for a considerable period of time. The use of human resources information systems (HRIS) has made it possible for companies to store and retrieve files in an electronic format for people within the organization to access when needed, thereby eliminating the need for physical files and freeing up space within the office. HRIS also allows for information to be accessed in a timelier manner; files can be accessible within seconds. Having all of the information in one place also allows for professionals to analyze data quickly and across multiple locations because the information is in a centralized location. Human resource analytics can improve human resource management.

=== Virtual management ===
Technology allows HR professionals to train new staff members in a more efficient manner. This gives employees the ability to access onboarding and training programs from virtually anywhere. This eliminates the need of organizing costly face-to-face training and onboarding sessions. It allows management&#x27;s to provide necessary training for job success and monitor progress of their employees through virtual classrooms and computerized testing, predict the risk of employee turnover through data analysis, help HR to formulate relevant talent retention and incentive strategies, improve the personal development of the company, and maintain metrics that aid in performance management.

Virtual management also allows HR departments to quickly complete necessary paperwork for large numbers of new employees and maintain contact with them throughout their entire professional cycle within the organization. Through virtual management, employees gain greater control over their learning and development, feel more engaged with the organizational culture, and can participate in training at a time and place of their choosing, helping them manage their work–life balance and reducing layoffs and turnover.

=== Employer of record ===
An Employer of Record (EOR) is an arrangement in which a third-party organization serves as the official employer for a company&#x27;s workforce, handling various HR functions such as payroll, tax compliance, and employee benefits, while the client company retains day-to-day management of the workers. This arrangement eliminates the need for an organization to directly engage in HRM matters, allowing it to focus on other priorities.

=== HRM consultancies ===
HRM consultancies are private organizations that offer tailored solutions through specialized expertise for a fee. They design customized human resource strategies and processes to address each company&#x27;s unique needs. Their services include developing recruitment plans, compensation frameworks, training programs, and performance management systems, all aligned with specific HR practices and the organization&#x27;s goals and culture. By acting as consultants, they provide targeted solutions that help businesses optimize their workforce and achieve organizational objectives in complex and evolving market conditions.

== Careers ==
There are half a million HR practitioners in the United States and millions more worldwide. The Chief HR Officer or HR Director is the highest ranking HR executive in most companies. He or she typically reports directly to the chief executive officer and works with the Board of Directors on CEO succession.

Within companies, HR positions generally fall into one of two categories: generalist and specialist. Generalists support employees directly with their questions, grievances, and work on a range of projects within the organization. They &quot;may handle all aspects of human resources work, and thus require an extensive range of knowledge. The responsibilities of human resources generalists can vary widely, depending on their employer&#x27;s needs.&quot; Specialists, conversely, work in a specific HR function. Some practitioners will spend an entire career as either a generalist or a specialist while others will obtain experiences from each and choose a path later. Human resource consulting is a related career path where individuals may work as advisers to companies and complete tasks outsourced from companies.

Some individuals with PhDs in HR and related fields, such as industrial and organizational psychology and management, are professors who teach HR principles at colleges and universities. They are most often found in Colleges of Business in departments of HR or Management. Many professors conduct research on topics that fall within the HR domain, such as financial compensation, recruitment, and training.

== Professional associations ==

There are a number of professional associations, some of which offer training and certification. The Society for Human Resource Management, which is based in the United States, is the largest professional association dedicated to HR, with over 285,000 members in 165 countries. It offers a suite of Professional in Human Resources (PHR) certifications through its HR Certification Institute. An international provider of specialized certifications is Academy to Innovate HR (AIHR). The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, based in England, is the oldest professional HR association, with its predecessor institution being founded in 1918.

Several associations also serve specific niches within HR. The Institute of Recruiters (IOR) is a recruitment professional association, offering members education, support and training. WorldatWork focuses on &quot;total rewards&quot; (i.e., compensation, benefits, work life, performance, recognition, and career development), offering several certifications and training programs dealing with remuneration and work–life balance. Other niche associations include the American Society for Training &amp; Development and Recognition Professionals International.

A largely academic organization that is relevant to HR is the Academy of Management that has an HR division. This division is concerned with finding ways to improve the effectiveness of HR. The academy publishes several journals devoted in part to research on HR, including &quot;Academy of Management Journal&quot; and &quot;Academy of Management Review&quot;, and it hosts an annual meeting.

==Education==
Some universities offer programs of study for human resources and related fields. The School of Industrial and Labor Relations at Cornell University was the world&#x27;s first school for college-level study in HR. It currently offers education at the undergraduate, graduate, and professional levels, and it operates a joint degree program with the Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management. In the United States of America, the Human Resources University trains federal employees.

Many colleges and universities house departments and institutes related to the field, either within a business school or in another college. Most business schools offer courses in HR, often in their departments of management. In general, schools of human resources management offer education and research in the HRM field from diplomas to doctorate-level opportunities. The master&#x27;s-level courses include MBA (HR), MM (HR), MHRM, MIR, etc. (See Master of Science in Human Resource Development for curriculum.) Various universities all over the world have taken up the responsibility of training human-resource managers and equipping them with interpersonal and intrapersonal skills so as to relate better at their places of work. As Human resource management field is continuously evolving due to technology advances of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, it is essential for universities and colleges to offer courses which are future oriented.

===Theory and research===
Ongoing research investigates the relationship between human research management and performance and includes organization studies, industrial and organizational psychology, organizational theory and management science. Human resource management research can improve human resource management and HR initiatives. The effect size of human resource management decreases when correcting for past performance of employees.

<doc id="1023079" wikidata="Q408815" url="?curid=1023079" title="Malachite green">
<text>Malachite green is an organic compound that is used as a dyestuff and controversially as an antimicrobial in aquaculture. Malachite green is traditionally used as a dye for materials such as silk, leather, and paper. Despite its name the dye is not prepared from the mineral malachite; the name just comes from the similarity of color.

==Structures and properties==
Malachite green is classified in the dyestuff industry as a triarylmethane dye and also using in pigment industry. Formally, malachite green refers to the chloride salt , although the term malachite green is used loosely and often just refers to the colored cation. The oxalate salt is also marketed. The anions have no effect on the color. The intense green color of the cation results from a strong absorption band at 621 nm (extinction coefficient of ).

Malachite green is prepared by the condensation of benzaldehyde and dimethylaniline to give leuco malachite green (LMG):
Second, this colorless leuco compound, a relative of triphenylmethane, is oxidized to the cation that is MG:
A typical oxidizing agent is manganese dioxide.

Hydrolysis of MG gives an alcohol:
This alcohol is important because it, not MG, traverses cell membranes. Once inside the cell, it is metabolized into LMG. Only the cation MG is deeply colored, whereas the leuco and alcohol derivatives are not. This difference arises because only the cationic form has extended pi-delocalization, which allows the molecule to absorb visible light.
 

==Preparation==
The leuco form of malachite green was first prepared by Hermann Fischer in 1877 by condensing benzaldehyde and dimethylaniline in the molecular ratio 1:2 in the presence of sulfuric acid.

==Uses==
Malachite green is traditionally used as a dye. Kilotonnes of MG and related triarylmethane dyes are produced annually for this purpose.

MG is active against the oomycete &quot;Saprolegnia&quot;, which infects fish eggs in commercial aquaculture, MG has been used to treat &quot;Saprolegnia&quot; and is used as an antibacterial. It is a very popular treatment against &quot;Ichthyophthirius multifiliis&quot; in freshwater aquaria. The principal metabolite, leuco-malachite green (LMG), is found in fish treated with malachite green, and this finding is the basis of controversy and government regulation. See also Antimicrobials in aquaculture.

MG has frequently been used to catch thieves and pilferers. The bait, usually money, is sprinkled with the anhydrous powder. Anyone handling the contaminated money will find that on upon washing the hands, a green stain on the skin that lasts for several days will result.

===Niche uses===
 Numerous niche applications exploit the intense color of MG. It is used as a biological stain for microscopic analysis of cell biology and tissue samples. In the Gimenez staining method, basic fuchsin stains bacteria red or magenta, and malachite green is used as a blue-green counterstain. Malachite green is also used in endospore staining, since it can directly stain endospores within bacterial cells; here a safranin counterstain is often used. Malachite green is a part of Alexander&#x27;s pollen stain. Malachite green can also be used as a saturable absorber in dye lasers, or as a pH indicator between pH 0.2–1.8. However, this use is relatively rare. Leuco-malachite green (LMG) is used as a detection method for latent blood in forensic science. Hemoglobin catalyzes the reaction between LMG and hydrogen peroxide, converting the colorless LMG into malachite green. Therefore, the appearance of a green color indicates the presence of blood.

A set of malachite green derivatives is also a key component in a fluorescence microscopy tool called the fluorogen activating protein/fluorogen system. Malachite green is in a class of molecules called fluorophores. When malachite green&#x27;s rotational freedom is restricted, it transforms from a non fluorescent molecule to a highly fluorescent molecule. In the fluorogen activating protein tool, established by a group at Carnegie Mellon University, Malachite green binds a specific fluorogen activating protein to become highly fluorescent. Expression of the fluorogen activating protein as fusions of targeting domains can impart subcellular localization. Its use is similar to that of GFP but has the added benefit of having a &#x27;dark state&#x27; before the malachite green fluorophore is added. This is especially useful for FRET studies.

== Regulation ==
In 1992, Canadian authorities determined that eating fish contaminated with malachite green posed a significant health risk. Malachite green was classified a Class II Health Hazard. Due to its low manufacturing cost, malachite green is still used in certain countries with less restrictive laws for non aquaculture purposes. In 2005, analysts in Hong Kong found traces of malachite green in eels and fish imported from China. In 2006, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) detected malachite green in seafood from China, among others, where the substance is also banned for use in aquaculture. In June 2007, the FDA blocked the importation of several varieties of seafood due to continued malachite green contamination.

Malachite green has been banned in the United States since 1983 in food-related applications. The substance is also banned in the United Kingdom. It is prohibited from the use in food in Macao.
Animals metabolize malachite green to its leuco form. Being lipophillic (the leuco form has a log &quot;P&quot; of 5.70), the metabolite is retained in catfish muscle longer (HL = 10 days) than is the parent molecule (HL = 2.8 days).

==Toxicity==
The (oral, mouse) is 80 mg/kg. Rats fed malachite green experience &quot;a dose-related increase in liver DNA adducts&quot; along with lung adenomas. Leucomalachite green causes an &quot;increase in the number and severity of changes&quot;. As leucomalachite green is the primary metabolite of malachite green and is retained in fish muscle much longer, most human dietary intake of malachite green from eating fish would be in the leuco form. During the experiment, rats were fed up to 543 ppm of leucomalachite green, an extreme amount compared to the average 5 ppb discovered in fish. After a period of two years, an increase in lung adenomas in male rats was discovered but no incidences of liver tumors. Therefore, it could be concluded that malachite green caused carcinogenic symptoms, but a direct link between malachite green and liver tumor was not established.

==Detection==
Although malachite green has almost no fluorescence in aqueous solution (quantum yield 7.9x10−5), several research groups have developed technologies to detect malachite green. For example, Zhao et al., demonstrated the use of malachite green aptamer in microcantilever based sensors to detect low concentration of malachite green.

<doc id="1023085" wikidata="Q3184666" url="?curid=1023085" title="Joseph Breuer">
<text>Joseph Breuer, also known as Yosef Breuer (March 20, 1882 – April 19, 1980) was a rabbi and community leader in Germany and the United States. He was rabbi of one of the large Jewish synagogues founded by German-Jewish refugees fleeing Nazi oppression that had settled in Washington Heights, New York.

==Life and career==
Joseph Breuer was born in 1882 in Pápa, Hungary, to the local rabbi Solomon Breuer and Sophie Breuer &quot;née&quot; Hirsch, who was the youngest daughter of Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch of Frankfurt am Main, Germany. After the passing of Hirsch in 1888, Solomon Breuer was elected his successor as rabbi of the &quot;Austrittsgemeinde&quot; (seceded community) of Orthodox Jews known as Khal Adath Jeshurun. Here, Breuer Sr. founded a yeshiva called the Torah Lehranstalt and became its first Rosh Yeshiva.

Joseph studied at the Torah Lehranstalt until 1903, when he was awarded semicha, and in 1905 he completed university studies at the University of Strasbourg with a PhD on the work of legal scholar Anselm von Feuerbach. He became a teacher at the Realschule (secondary school) and lecturer at the Torah Lehranstalt. He married Rika Eisenmann of Antwerp, granddaughter of Eliezer Liepman Philip Prins in 1911. In 1919 he was also appointed rabbi of the Klaus synagogue of Frankfurt.

Following Solomon Breuer&#x27;s death, in 1926, Joseph Breuer succeeded him as Rosh Yeshiva which he practically had already been before his father&#x27;s death. Joseph Jonah Horowitz succeeded Solomon Breuer as rabbi. In 1933, with the rise of Nazism, he briefly moved the yeshiva to Fiume, Italy, where he had assumed the rabbinate, but this arrangement lasted only until the next year and the family and the yeshiva returned to Frankfurt. It was formally dissolved by the Nazis in 1935, but continued to function unofficially. On the day after Kristallnacht, Breuer was arrested but subsequently released. The family left Germany, initially to Antwerp. A former pupil was then, with the assistance of Bernard Revel, able to procure an affidavit of support, which enabled Breuer and his family to relocate to New York in 1939. Bernard Revel offered Joseph Breuer a teaching position in his institution, which he brusquely turned down. He reportedly said that he would rather &quot;clean the streets&quot;.

In New York, Breuer took the initiative to start a congregation with the numerous German refugees in Washington Heights, which would closely follow the morale and customs of its &quot;spiritual ancestor&quot; in Frankfurt. The congregation came to be called Khal Adath Yeshurun (KAJ), but is colloquially called &quot;Breuer&#x27;s&quot; after its founder. In addition, he founded Yeshiva Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch, a yeshiva elementary school and high school named after his illustrious grandfather. It was the first such school in the area that used the vernacular. He also founded a teachers&#x27; seminary for women that would be renamed the Rika Breuer Teachers&#x27; Seminary after his wife&#x27;s death. All institutions purported to follow the teachings and ideology of Breuer&#x27;s grandfather Hirsch. In 1958, the community invited Frankfurt-born Shimon Schwab, then of Baltimore, to assist with rabbinical duties.

Towards the end of his life, the name Levi was added to his own name as a blessing to recover from an illness. He died in 1980, survived by his children , Jacob, Samson, Rosy Bondi, Edith Silverman, Sophie Gutmann, Hanna Schwalbe and Meta Bechhofer.

==Views and philosophy==
Breuer was well known for his involvement in setting up an Orthodox Jewish infrastructure in post-World War II America. He wrote several books, including translations of and commentaries on the Biblical books of Jeremiah and Ezekiel; English translations of these appeared after his death.

Breuer can be considered the main post-war representative of the &quot;Torah im Derech Eretz&quot; movement in the United States. Apart from the above-mentioned books, he limited his written work to contributions to the community organ (&quot;Mitteilungen&quot;); some appeared in book form after his death. His influence was mainly due to his public speeches and his indefatigable work on the community&#x27;s services. A number of important ideas can be distinguished:
*Independent Orthodoxy: Breuer drew on his grandfather&#x27;s work of &quot;Austritt&quot; - the principle that Jewish communities can only truly claim to be Jewish if they are ideologically and otherwise independent from organizations that represent ideals contrary to halakha. In America, where the community organization was not enforced by local law, this became in Breuer&#x27;s mind an even stronger issue than in Europe. This stance also led to his involvement with Agudath Israel of America. He was stridently opposed to a Zionist state, and refrained from visiting Israel.
*&quot;Torah im Derech Eretz&quot;: Breuer saw the risk of misinterpretation of his grandfather&#x27;s ideas on how Judaism could be harmonised within limits with general culture of the outside world. He repeatedly stated that compromising on Jewishness and &quot;halakha&quot; was at variance with &quot;Torah im Derech Eretz&quot;. With the rise of the yeshiva movement, he also remarked that &quot;Torah im Derech Eretz&quot; was by no means a unique temporary measure - as was often claimed by protagonists of the &quot;Torah only&quot; view.
*&quot;Kosher ve-Yosher&quot;: Although one of the phenomena of post-World War II Orthodoxy has become the (re)introduction of stringencies in halakha, Breuer held that these should not be limited to the ceremonial sphere but also to the many financial and social laws of Judaism. He would, for example, refuse a hechsher to companies with bad financial records.

<text>Umbertide () is a town and &quot;comune&quot; (municipality) in the province of Perugia, in the Italian region of Umbria, at the confluence of the Reggia river and the Tiber. It is 30 km (19 mi) north of Perugia and 20 km (12 mi) south of Città di Castello. 

With 16,607 inhabitants according to the 2017 census, Umbertide is one of the larger towns of Umbria. As it is located in the river plain, it is basically flat. It is an industrial center producing machine tools, textiles, packaging material, and ceramics. Olive oil is also produced, especially in Pierantonio and in its southwestern part.

==Economy==

Umbertide has several factories supporting the automotive industry, including Tiberina Holding Srl, a car components group. Other important companies are Proma SpA, Modulo Srl, and Terex Italia Srl manufacturing under the Genie brandname.

== History==
Umbertide or the surrounding area was inhabited in pre-Roman and Roman times. At the top of Monte Acuto has been discovered an umbrian fortification (&quot;castelliere&quot;).

19th-century archaeologist Mariano Guardabassi even attributed a small building at Lame, about 1 km from the center of the modern town, to the Etruscans, although this is by no means certain The Roman town of &quot;Pitulum Mergens&quot;, destroyed by Totila in the mid-6th century, may account for Roman remains in S. Maria delle Sette. In its present incarnation, Umbertide was founded in the 8th or 10th century, depending on the scholar; its original name was Fratta, and it received its present name in 1863 in honor of then Crown Prince Umberto and of Uberto or Umberto margrave of Tuscany, whose four sons, Adalberto, Ingilberto, Benedetto and Bonifacio, according to tradition, rebuilt the town in 796 on the ruins of &quot;Pitulum Mergens&quot;.

==Main sights==

Although there are remains of the medieval walls, a few medieval houses, and part of the Rocca of Umbertide, or citadel, many of Umbertide&#x27;s best monuments are of later periods.

*Churches:
**Santa Maria della Reggia: the main church in town, a collegiate church often referred to simply as the &quot;Collegiata&quot;: it is an octagonal 16th century brick building topped by an elegant cupola, housing a few paintings by Niccolò Circignani. 
**Santa Maria della Pietà: with the attractive funerary chapel of the counts of Sorbello, is late medieval and Renaissance church. 
**Santa Croce: a 17th‑century church, now housing a painting gallery, including a &quot;Deposition&quot; by Luca Signorelli. 
**San Francesco: the largest church, built in Gothic architecture: in the early 21st century it was undergoing a major restoration that promised to be protracted. 
**Cristo Risorto: twentieth‑century church.

Beyond the city limits, the township&#x27;s principal monuments are:
*Castle of Civitella Ranieri, 5 km (3 mi) NE, one of the best-preserved medieval fortresses in Umbria.
*Abbey of S. Salvatore di Montecorona 4 km (2.5 mi) S, which has a beautiful eleventh‑century crypt with early Romanesque capitals and naïve 18th century painted ceilings.
*Castello di Polgeto, a medieval structure
*Abbey church of S. Bartolomeo de&#x27; Fossi, sited on a sharp ridge with distant views on either side
*Borgo Santa Giuliana, a walled medieval village

<doc id="1023088" wikidata="Q1130684" url="?curid=1023088" title="Feast of San Gennaro">
<text>The Feast of San Gennaro (in Italian: &quot;Festa di San Gennaro&quot;), also known as San Gennaro Festival, is a Neapolitan and Italian-American patronal festival dedicated to Saint Januarius, patron saint of Naples and Little Italy, New York.

His feast is celebrated on 19 September in the calendar of the Catholic Church.

In the United States, the &quot;Festa of San Gennaro&quot; is also a highlight of the year for New York&#x27;s Little Italy, with the saint&#x27;s polychrome statue carried through the middle of a street fair stretching for blocks.

== In Italy ==
=== History ===

On 19 September 305, Gennaro (), bishop of Benevento, was beheaded in Pozzuoli during the persecution of Christians by Diocletian. According to the legend,

San Gennaro was named patron and protector of the city, and is invoked by the people of Naples on several occasions, e.g. to ask for help, healing and special favors; memorably, he was called on to stop the 1631 eruption of Mount Vesuvius, and the lava – that was about to destroy the towns around it – slowed down.
Meanwhile, with very few exceptions, the blood miracle happens again and again, three times a year:
# the Saturday prior the first Sunday of May – the day when the saint&#x27;s body was transferred from Pozzuoli to Naples;
# on 19 September – the day of his martyrdom; 
# and, finally, on 16 December – date when the saint interceded to end the 1631 eruption of Mount Vesuvius.

=== Celebration ===


In Naples and neighboring areas, an annual celebration and feast of faith is held over the course of three days, commemorating Saint Gennaro. Throughout the festival, parades, religious processions and musical entertainment are featured.

The focus of the celebration is the miracle of San Gennaro&#x27;s blood melting, also simply known as the miracle of San Gennaro, or blood miracle.

== In the United States ==
=== Little Italy, New York ===
The festival was first celebrated in the United States in September 1926, when immigrants from Naples congregated along Mulberry Street in the Little Italy section of Manhattan in New York City to continue the tradition they had followed in Italy to celebrate Saint Januarius, the Patron Saint of Naples.

The immigrant families on Mulberry Street who started the feast, a group of cafe owners, erected a small chapel in the street to house the image of their patron Saint. They invited all to partake of their wares, asking the devoted to pin an offering to the ribbon streamers that are hung from the statue&#x27;s apron. This money was then distributed to the needy poor of the neighborhood. Originally a one-day religious commemoration, over time, the festival expanded into an 11-day street fair organized and run by people outside the neighborhood. It is now an annual celebration of food and drink, and a major tourist attraction.

Centered on Mulberry Street, which is closed to traffic for the occasion, the festival generally features sausages, &quot;zeppole&quot;, street vendors, games, parades and other such attractions. The Grand Procession is held starting at 2 p.m. on the last Saturday of the feast, immediately after a celebratory Mass at the Church of the Most Precious Blood. This is a Roman Catholic candlelit procession in which the statue of San Gennaro is carried from its permanent home in the Most Precious Blood Church through the streets of Little Italy.

Another festival is held with the same attractions in New York City&#x27;s other Little Italy, in the Fordham/Belmont community in the Bronx. The streets are closed to traffic, and the festivities begin early in the morning and proceed late into the night.

==== Corruption ====
In 1995, following the exposure of financial improprieties and mafia involvement, New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani declared that if the city&#x27;s San Gennaro festival did not remove corrupt elements, he would shut it down.
After Giuliani&#x27;s ultimatum, a community group was formed to manage the festival; the municipal government asked it to hire a professional manager, and it hired Mort Berkowitz to be the financial manager.

=== Other locations ===
Similar festivals have also been sponsored in other cities.

In 1980, Vincent Jimmy Palmisano brought the Feast of San Gennaro to the Las Vegas Valley, Nevada, for the first time. The event was hosted and entertained by Tony Sacca from 1986 to 2016, along with celebrities from the strip such as Pat Cooper, Ernest Borgnine, Jerry Vale, Liberace, Frankie Avalon.
The Las Vegas festival is now held twice a year, in the Spring and Fall. This bi-annual festival features traditional Italian cuisine, amusement rides and games, and entertainers such as Emilio Baglioni, Chazz Palminteri, Tommy DeVito from the Jersey Boys and Louis Prima&#x27;s daughter, Lena Prima.

In 2002, Jimmy Kimmel, Adam Carolla, and Doug DeLuca founded the Feast of San Gennaro Los Angeles, which is now a major annual event held every September in Hollywood.

In 2011, Hampton Bays (Long Island, New York) started their San Gennaro celebration. It has since grown rapidly to become the largest San Gennaro Feast on Long Island, and second only to the Little Italy Feast in New York State. The Hampton Bays Feast of San Gennaro draws a huge crowd, with live bands, raffles and prizes, and vendors selling food and drink.

In 2012, the Feast of San Gennaro of the Jersey Shore was established in Belmar, New Jersey, by Daniel Di Cesare, whose goal was to highlight the positive contributions of Italian Americans.

In 2013, the San Gennaro Festival was brought to Seattle, WA, by the Mascio family, who formed the San Gennaro Foundation Seattle. Held the second week of September, it includes the procession of the San Gennaro statue, live music and food. This three day festival is held in the heart of Georgetown, WA, where many of Seattle&#x27;s Italian community settled when they first arrived in Seattle.

<text>The Rural Development Service (RDS) was formerly part of the UK Government&#x27;s Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). It ceased to exist on 1 October 2006 following the creation of Natural England.

== History ==

The RDS was created in 2001, when the Farming and Rural Conservation Agency merged with the then Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food&#x27;s regional service centres.

The body was charged with the implementation of the England Rural Development Programme (ERDP), as well as a range of other rural services, placing the agency at the forefront of change in rural areas. The RDS employed 1,500, working with rural partners and local people to improve the environment, promote the conservation of wildlife and biodiversity and develop stronger rural economies and communities.

Following a review by Christopher Haskins, enacted in the Natural Environment and Rural Communities 2006 in March 2006, the agri-environment element of the RDS was integrated with English Nature and most of the Countryside Agency on 1 October 2006 to form Natural England. Smaller elements of the RDS went to the State Veterinary Service and the Regional Development Agency in each English region.

<doc id="1023101" wikidata="Q736587" url="?curid=1023101" title="Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral, Saint Petersburg">
<text>The Peter and Paul Cathedral () is a Russian Orthodox cathedral located inside the Peter and Paul Fortress in St. Petersburg, Russia. It is the first and oldest landmark in St. Petersburg, built between 1712 and 1733 on Hare Island along the Neva River. Both the cathedral and the fortress were originally built under Peter the Great and designed by Domenico Trezzini. The cathedral&#x27;s bell tower is the world&#x27;s tallest Orthodox bell tower. Since the belfry is not standalone, but an integral part of the main building, the cathedral is sometimes considered the second tallest Orthodox Church in the world. There is another Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul Church in St. Petersburg, located in Petergof.

== Architecture ==

The current building, the first stone church in St. Petersburg, was designed by Trezzini and built between 1712 and 1733. Its gold-painted spire reaches a height of and features at its top an angel holding a cross. This angel is one of the most important symbols of St. Petersburg.

The cathedral&#x27;s architecture also features a unique iconostasis (the screen which separates the nave of the church from the sanctuary). In the Eastern Orthodox Church the iconostasis is normally a flat wall or screen with three doors through it, the central Holy Doors used only for very solemn entrances, and the two side doors, by which the clergy and others enter and leave the sanctuary. However, at St. Peter and Paul, the iconostasis rises to form a sort of tower over the sanctuary.

The cathedral has a typical Flemish carillon, a gift of the Flemish city of Mechelen, Flanders.

==Church functions ==

The cathedral is dedicated to Saints Peter and Paul, the patron saints of the fortress (Saint Peter being the patron saint of the city). The current cathedral is the second one on the site. The first, built soon after Peter&#x27;s founding of the city, was consecrated by Archbishop Iov of Novgorod the Great in April 1704.

The cathedral was the cathedral church (i.e., the seat of the bishop; the term &quot;cathedral&quot;—&quot;sobor&quot; (&quot;собор&quot;) in Russian—can mean the seat of a bishop, but it can also mean simply a large or important church) of the city until 1859 (when St Isaacs became the city&#x27;s cathedral.) The current cathedral church of St. Petersburg is the Kazan Cathedral on Nevsky Prospect.

The cathedral was closed in 1919 and turned into a museum in 1925. It is still officially a museum; religious services, however, 
resumed in 2000.

==Imperial tombs==

The cathedral houses the remains of almost all the Russian emperors and empresses from Peter the Great to Nicholas II and his family, who were finally laid to rest in July 1998.

Of the post-Petrine rulers, only Peter II and Ivan VI are not buried here. Peter II is buried in the Cathedral of Michael the Archangel in the Moscow Kremlin; Ivan VI was executed and buried in the fortress of Shlisselburg or Kholmogory (alleged discovery at Kholmogory in 2010 currently under forensic investigation).

On September 28, 2006, 78 years after her death, Maria Feodorovna, Empress of Russia, was reinterred in the Cathedral of St Peter and Paul. Wife of Tsar Alexander III, and mother of Nicholas II (the last Russian tsar), Maria Feodorovna died on 13 October 1928 in exile in her native Denmark and was buried in Roskilde Cathedral in Denmark. In 2005, the governments of Denmark and Russia agreed that the empress&#x27;s remains should be returned to Saint Petersburg in accordance with her wish to be interred next to her husband.

== Bell tower ==


The bell tower (with spire) is the dominant feature of this cathedral and the fortress. It serves several functions as part of the structure:
* It is an architectural symbol, an important part of its shape and of the Peter and Paul Fortress.
* It is a part of the imperial tomb - the tombs are on the ground floor.
* It is a lightning rod protecting the cathedral.
* It is a viewing platform upon which excursions meet each hour from 12:00 till 18:00.
* It houses a carillon upon which concerts are periodically performed.
When renovators were cleaning the angel on the spire in 1997, they found a note in a bottle left in one of the folds of the angel&#x27;s gown. In the note, renovators from 1953 apologized for what they felt was rushed and shoddy work (Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev wanted the angel refurbished for the 250th anniversary of the city that year). It is said that the renovators in 1997 left another message for future generations, but the contents of that message have not been revealed.

===History of the carillon===
When Tsar Peter I of Russia visited the Netherlands in 1698 he heard the perfectly tuned Hemony carillons in Amsterdam and Leiden pealing all 24 hours of the day, every quarter of an hour automatically. Later in 1717 he visited Flanders incognito and climbed the tower of the Cathedral of Our Lady in Antwerp, where he must have heard one of the two Hemony carillons in one of the towers of this cathedral. He was impressed by the sound of a carillon and wanted one like these for his new cathedral in St. Petersburg. So he ordered it in 1720 from the Netherlands. In Amsterdam the only bellfounder at that time, , was married to the widow of Claude Fremy. This Claude Fremy had been a pupil of Hemony. So Jan Albert de Grave was presumably the bellfounder who made these bells. (Some years later he also made a carillon for Potsdam.) The people in St. Petersburg could only listen to this well-tuned instrument for a short time. In 1756 the tower burned down after a thunderstorm. All its bells were lost.

In 1757, only one year after this disaster, a new carillon was ordered from Holland - this time by a bell-founder in Hoorn named Johan Nicolaas Derck. He cast the bells, and clockmaker Barend Oortkras from the Hague brought them to St. Petersburg to install them. When he arrived, the tower was not rebuilt yet so he could not reinstall the bells. Oortkras stayed in St. Petersburg, but in 1764 he died in poverty before the tower was finished. This new carillon was installed in 1776 by the German clockmaker Johann Erdmann Rudiger. Rudiger also was hired to play the bells. Bell founder Derck could not tune his bells well, so Russian bell founders recast some of the bells in the 19th century. Audibly, this was not a success either. Thus in 2001 a new set of 51 bells were made in the south of the Netherlands. The bells were cast and the carillon installed by the Royal foundry workshop Petit &amp; Fritsen from Aarle-Rixtel in North Brabant. The carillon comprises 51 bells with a gross weight of ; the biggest bell weighs about , the smallest only . The carillon has a range of four octaves, so most classical and modern music can be performed on this instrument.

The Peter and Paul carillon is a gift to Saint Petersburg from the Government of Flanders and from more than 350 sponsors from different countries. The contribution was presented in the name of Her Majesty Queen Fabiola of Belgium, the Belgian King Boudewijn Fund, the Government of Flanders, the authorities of various Flemish cities and communities, including businesses, and financial institutions, cultural communities, schools and universities, and also ordinary citizens of Belgium, Russia, England, Germany, Lithuania, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, the US and Japan.

<text>Timothy Lewis – best known by the stage name Thighpaulsandra – is a Welsh experimental musician and multi-instrumentalist, known mostly for performing on synthesizers and keyboards. He began his career working with Julian Cope in the late 1980s, becoming a member of Cope&#x27;s touring band. A collaboration with Cope in 1993 followed, forming the experimental duo Queen Elizabeth. In 1997, former Cope guitarist Mike Mooney invited Thighpaulsandra to fill in for the departing Kate Radley on a Spiritualized tour, and he remained with the band until early 2008. In 1998, Lewis also became a member of the experimental band Coil. He has subsequently released several solo albums under the Thighpaulsandra moniker.

Lewis currently performs and records as part of URUK with Massimo Pupillo (of Italian band Zu) and UUUU, a band also featuring Valentina Magaletti and Wire members Graham Lewis and Matthew Simms. He has also been playing with The Charlatans&#x27; Tim Burgess since 2020, as part of Burgess&#x27; solo backing band. Since 2021 he has been touring with Hawkwind and appears as a performer and co-writer on their 2023 album The Future Never Waits.

==Career==
Beginning his career in the early 1980s with the hair metal band Temper Temper, he next became the house engineer and studio manager at Loco Studios near Newport. It was here that he first met Julian Cope and, as they bonded over a shared love of krautrock, Thighpaulsandra was invited to contribute synthesizers to Cope&#x27;s albums &quot;Autogeddon&quot;, &quot;20 Mothers&quot;, &quot;Interpreter&quot;, and &quot;Rite2&quot;. In 1997, he joined the band Spiritualized for a US tour and survived the cuts made to the band shortly thereafter. Thighpaulsandra can be heard on the records &quot;Live at the Albert Hall&quot;, &quot;Let It Come Down&quot;, &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; and &quot;Songs in A&amp;E&quot;. 
Thighpaulsandra also collaborated with Spiritualized&#x27;s Jason Pierce on the 2008 soundtrack to the Harmony Korine film &quot;Mister Lonely&quot;. In 1998 he began working with Coil with Peter Christopherson and John Balance, and performed on &quot;Astral Disaster&quot;, &quot;Musick to Play in the Dark Vol. 1&quot; and &quot;Musick to Play in the Dark Vol. 2&quot;. Thighpaulsandra was largely responsible for convincing Christopherson and Balance to perform live for the first time in over a decade, first appearing at the Julian Cope curated Cornucopea festival at the Royal Festival Hall in 2000.
As of 2021, Thighpaulsandra was working on upcoming Coil re-releases.

His first three solo releases came out via the Coil label, Eskaton. John Balance provided vocals for Thighpaulsandra&#x27;s first release &quot;Some Head EP&quot;, and Peter Christopherson designed the artwork for the &quot;I, Thighpaulsandra&quot; double album and for the following &quot;Double Vulgar&quot; albums. The artwork caused some controversy with several printers not willing to reproduce the controversial imagery. 
&quot;Double Vulgar II&quot; was delayed, possibly for the same reason, along with the passing of friend and colleague John Balance in 2004. Since leaving Spiritualized in 2008 Thighpaulsandra has worked with Elizabeth Fraser on her forthcoming solo album and was part of her group for a series of live shows at the Royal Festival Hall in 2012 as part of the Meltdown Festival. In September 2013 he joined Wire on their UK and European tours playing keyboards. After a hiatus from solo work, Thighpaulsandra released &quot;The Golden Communion&quot; in 2015.

In 2016 and 2017 respectively he began recording and touring with Massimo Pupillo (of Italian band Zu) as Uruk and Valentina Magaletti and Graham Lewis and Matthew Simns as UUUU.
Uruk have released two albums, &quot;I Leave A Silver Trail through Blackness&quot; in 2017 and &quot;Mysterium Coniunctionis&quot; in 2018.
UUUU&#x27;s first release, entitled &quot;UUUU&quot; is a full-length album released in 2017 and their second, an EP entitled &quot;UUUU-EP&quot;, was released in 2018.

From 2020 Thighpaulsandra has been playing with Tim Burgess. Thighpaulsandra is currently working on a new Laniakea album with Daniel O&#x27;Sullivan and Massimo Pupillo. From August 2021 he has been playing live with veteran psychedelic rockers Hawkwind, and appears on their latest album The Future Never Waits.

<text>The Mayor is the highest elected official in Tampa, Florida. Since its incorporation in 1856, the town has had 59 mayors. Tampa had no mayor from 1862 until 1866, during which time the city government was temporarily suspended during and immediately after the American Civil War.

==Election process==
In 1910, the white supremacist White Municipal Party was established in Tampa. It excluded African Americans from being members effectively excluding African American voters from having influence in the city&#x27;s mayoral elections from 1910 until 1947.

Since 1953, Tampa&#x27;s municipal elections (including those for mayor) have been non-partisan. All qualified candidates are entered into the general election without a primary election. Candidates are required to disclose a party affiliation. If no candidate wins a majority of the vote, a runoff election is held between the top two vote-getters to decide the outcome.

==Terms and term limits==
From the establishment of Tampa&#x27;s city charter of 1856 until 1896, Tampa&#x27;s mayors served one year terms. The term was extended to two years in 1896 and to four years in 1924.

From 1856 until 1920, Tampa mayors could not serve consecutive terms but were permitted to run again after being out of office for one full term. This resulted in several mayors serving multiple non-consecutive terms, especially in the late 1800s. In 1920, term limits were abolished entirely.

Since 1983, Tampa mayors have been limited to two consecutive terms, but they may run again after spending at least a full four-year term out of the office.

† Deceased in office.&lt;br&gt;
1 Following the lapse of the city charter in October 1869, Hillsborough County took over responsibility for providing principal services. However, Tampa needed some form of municipal government to monitor the services being provided by the county and the state. As a result, a municipal election was held on July 6, 1870, in which Henderson was elected mayor.

<doc id="1023108" wikidata="Q615697" url="?curid=1023108" title="Arcuate fasciculus">
<text>In neuroanatomy, the arcuate fasciculus (AF; ) is a bundle of axons that generally connects Broca&#x27;s area and Wernicke&#x27;s area in the brain. It is an association fiber tract connecting caudal temporal lobe and inferior frontal lobe.

==Structure==
The arcuate fasciculus is a white matter tract that runs parallel to the superior longitudinal fasciculus. Due to their proximity, they are sometimes referred to interchangeably. They can be distinguished by the location and function of their endpoints in the frontal cortex. The arcuate fasciculus terminates in Broca&#x27;s area (specifically BA 44) which is linked to processing complex syntax. However, the superior longitudinal fasciculus ends in the premotor cortex which is implicated in acoustic-motor mapping.

=== Connection ===
Historically, the arcuate fasciculus has been understood to connect two important areas for language use: Broca&#x27;s area in the inferior frontal gyrus and Wernicke&#x27;s area in the posterior superior temporal gyrus. It is mostly considered to be an oversimplification, but this model is still utilized because a satisfactory replacement has not been developed. The topographical relationships between independent measures of white matter and gray matter integrity suggest that rich developmental or environmental interactions influence brain structure and function. The presence and strength of such associations may elucidate pathophysiological processes influencing systems such as language and motor planning.

As the technique of diffusion MRI has improved, this has become a testable hypothesis. Research indicates more diffuse termination of the fibers of the arcuate than previously thought. While the main caudal source of the fiber tract appears to be posterior superior temporal cortex, the rostral terminations are mostly in premotor cortex, part of Brodmann area 44.

=== Developmental differences ===
Myelination is a process by which axons are covered with a protective substance called myelin that drastically increases the signaling efficiency of the neuron. The arcuate fasciculus is heavily myelinated in healthy adult brains. The density of this myelination has been found to predict the accuracy and speed to which one can comprehend sentences. However, the arcuate fasciculus of newborns is unmyelinated. The myelination process occurs gradually during childhood; myelin density has been shown to increase between the age of 3 and 10. A study comparing a group of 6-year-olds to a group of 3-year-olds found that the 6-year-olds had stronger functional connectivity of the arcuate fasciculus. The arcuate fasciculus is similarly undeveloped in non-human primates such as chimpanzees and macaques. This supports the theory that the arcuate fasciculus is a critical component in language.

=== Dorsal stream ===
The two-streams hypothesis of language proposes that there are two streams by which the brain processes language information: the dorsal and ventral streams. The basis of this model is generally accepted, however the details of it are highly contentious. The dorsal pathway consists of multiple fiber tracts, one of which is the arcuate fasciculus. The dorsal pathway as a whole is implicated in sensory-to-motor mapping and processing complex syntax.

== Role in language ==

=== Syntax ===
Syntax refers to a set of rules by which we order words within a language. Some researchers argue that syntax is what distinguishes language as a uniquely human capacity. Though the exact function of the arcuate fasciculus is still debated, the predominant theory is that it is involved with processing complex sequences of syntax. Studies indicate that as the arcuate fasciculus matures and undergoes myelination, there is a corresponding increase in the ability to process syntax. Furthermore, lesions in the arcuate fasciculus often result in difficulties with syntax. Researchers have found that when subjects are confronted with difficult syntactic structures, there is high synchronicity between the left frontal and parietal regions due to their connection by the arcuate fasciculus. This research further supports the arcuate fasciculus as the key component of human language.

=== Lateralization ===
The arcuate fasciculus is a bilateral structure; this means that it is present in both the right and left hemispheres of the brain. These fiber tracts are asymmetrical; the left arcuate fasciculus is stronger than the right. While the left arcuate fasciculus is thought to be the one involved with syntax processing, the right arcuate fasciculus has been implicated in prosody processing. Studies further suggest that the right arcuate fasciculus is involved with the ability to read emotion from human facial expression.

==Clinical significance==

=== Conduction aphasia ===
Historically the arcuate fasciculus has been linked to conduction aphasia, which is usually the result of damage to the inferior parietal lobule that extends into the subcortical white matter and compromises the arcuate fasciculus. This type of aphasia is characterized by difficulty with repetition and prevalent phonemic paraphasias. Patients otherwise exhibit a relatively normal control of language. The symptoms of conduction aphasia suggest that the connection between the posterior temporal cortex and frontal cortex plays a vital role in short-term memory of words and speech sounds that are new or have just been heard. The arcuate fasciculus is the main connection between these two regions. Studies that challenge the claim that the arcuate fasciculus is responsible for repetition cite that in some cases lesions to the arcuate fasciculus nor total agenesis produce conduction aphasia.

=== Progressive aphasia ===
Progressive aphasia is a type of aphasia that slowly worsens over time. It can affect both the production and comprehension of language. Progressive aphasic patients that have lesions in their arcuate fasciculus were especially deficient in their syntax processing abilities. Worsened syntax processing correlated with the degree of degradation in the arcuate fasciculus.

=== Tone deafness ===
In nine out of ten people with tone deafness, the superior arcuate fasciculus in the right hemisphere could not be detected, suggesting a disconnection between the posterior superior temporal gyrus and the posterior inferior frontal gyrus. Researchers suggested the posterior superior temporal gyrus was the origin of the disorder.

=== Stuttering ===
In stutterers, the arcuate fasciculus appears to have bilateral deficits that reduce it by one-third or more relative to non-stutterers. However, there is ongoing debate concerning the contribution of each hemisphere. Diffusion-based evidence of differences between stutterers and controls is not isolated to the arcuate fasciculus.

=== Specific language impairment ===
Specific language impairment is a disorder that prevents children from developing language normally. These children particularly have difficulty with the syntactic and hierarchal structures of language. Damage to the arcuate fasciculus is implicated as a possible cause of specific language impairment, however further data is required to validate this claim.

=== Dyslexia ===
Dyslexia is a disorder that is primarily characterized by reading deficits. Research has shown that decreases in the integrity of the arcuate fasciculus coincide with worsened reading ability in dyslexic subjects.

<text>Clubmoor is a neighbourhood of Liverpool, Merseyside, England, in the Liverpool City Council ward of Clubmoor. It is part of the Liverpool Walton parliamentary constituency since 2010; before then the ward had fallen under Liverpool West Derby since 1955.

At the 2001 Census, the population of Clubmoor ward was recorded as 13,387. The ward is heavily residential but with a few areas of employment such as the district centre known locally as &quot;Broadway&quot; situated on Broadway/Broad Lane.

As a Liverpool City Council ward, it is represented by three Labour Party councillors - Roz Gladden, Tim Jeeves and Sarah Morton. The local Member of Parliament is Labour MP Dan Carden.

==Description==
The Clubmoor area is situated in north-east Liverpool and is bordered by the nearby districts of Norris Green, Anfield and Tuebrook. The main Liverpool inner ring-road Queens Drive (A5058) passes through Clubmoor.

Transport wise, Clubmoor is well served by buses on the routes to Liverpool city centre and also on Queens Drive. Until 1960 it was served by Clubmoor railway station on the old loop line.

Schools in the area include Roscoe Primary School.

==History==
===Ammunition train incident===
During the Liverpool Blitz, a notable incident of the area was the ammunition train explosion of 1940. The train was leaving the docks in order to avoid the bombing, but it was hit near Breck Road railway station with the explosion sent the debris flying in all directions. A train wheel smashed through the doorway of a pub, killing the manager. The driver of the train, George Roberts acted extremely selflessly and managed to detach the back end of the train and sent it away to stop it from catching fire. One of the men was off duty railwayman John Guinan from Witton Road who ran to help as soon as he heard the blast. To this day, many of the surrounding houses have been affected by the blast.

===Post 1945-Present day===
During the 1950s, US Troops from RAF Burtonwood and RAF Sealand used the open spaces in Clubmoor for playing baseball. This land as well as the nearby Breckside park depot was also used for storing Tanks, Ack Ack guns, Landing crafts etc. there to prepare them for shipping to Europe and Africa. Houses were also built next to the railway depot with the streets with American States as names.

<text>Grassendale is a suburb of Liverpool, Merseyside, England. It is in the south of the city, bordered by Aigburth, Garston and Mossley Hill.

==History==
The hamlet of Grassendale was acquired by Robert de Blackburn, the lord of the manor of Garston, from Richard de Toxteth in the 14th century. In the 19th century it developed as a residential suburb. Grassendale was made into an ecclesiastical parish in 1855 following the opening of St Mary&#x27;s Church in August 1853. Grassendale was recorded as a site with Catholic landowners in 1717. The Roman Catholic church of St. Austin, served by the English Benedictines, opened in 1838.

==Description==
Grassendale is an almost entirely residential suburb which consists of large, detached 19th century villas. The area is particularly green, and houses are commonly set well back from the road. This district retains classic-style streetlamps.

Grassendale Park and Cressington Park were designated as conservation areas on 13 November 1968. The ward, which contains both parks and the housing, is called Cressington.

<text>Mossley Hill is a suburb of Liverpool and ward of Liverpool City Council. Located 3.5 miles southeast of the city centre, it is bordered by the suburbs of Aigburth, Allerton, Childwall, Garston, and Wavertree. At the 2001 Census, the population was 12,650, increasing to 13,816 at the 2011 Census.

==Overview==
Mossley Hill is considered an affluent area and is mostly residential with a few local businesses. Housing is mainly semi-detached, with occasional detached and numerous terraced streets. It lies on the border of two Parliamentary constituencies: Liverpool Riverside and Liverpool Wavertree. It is represented on Liverpool City Council by councillors from the Mossley Hill ward, though parts of it stretch into the Greenbank and Church wards.

The suburb is the location of Dovedale Primary School, whose alumni includes George Harrison, John Lennon, Peter Sissons, Jimmy Tarbuck, and John Power. Calderstones School, which Lennon attended when it was called Quarry Bank, is located nearby. Liverpool College, which was a fee-paying independent school until 2013, is also located within the area. Liverpool&#x27;s only grammar school, the Liverpool Blue Coat School, is also nearby in the neighbouring suburb of Wavertree. The area is home to two student accommodation buildings, the Greenbank Halls of Residence and the now-defunct Carnatic Halls of Residence, both catering to students of the University of Liverpool.

Mossley Hill&#x27;s local park is Greenbank Park, one of the most popular parks in Liverpool; two more of the city&#x27;s most popular parks, Sefton Park and Calderstones Park, are also nearby. The Millennium Green, accessible from Penny Lane or Oakdale Road, is a small popular green space hosting wildflower fields and woods and is a popular dog walking area. Sudley House is one of seven museums and art galleries run by National Museums Liverpool, displaying paintings by Gainsborough and Turner, among others. Mossley Hill Athletic Club are a voluntary multi-sports club offering facilities for archery, crown green bowling, cricket, football, rugby, hockey, running, and tennis. There is also a women&#x27;s football team, Mossley Hill LFC, who play in the Northern Combination Women&#x27;s Football League.

Mossley Hill railway station on Rose Lane and West Allerton railway station on Booker Avenue are located in Mossley Hill. Both stations offer regular services to Liverpool city centre (an approx 11 minute journey time), Warrington (27 minute journey) and Manchester Oxford Road (a 57-minute journey). There are connections to Birmingham via Liverpool South Parkway.

Spire Hospital Liverpool, formerly Lourdes Hospital, on Greenbank Road is Liverpool&#x27;s first private hospital. It faces Greenbank Park.

Mossley Hill has one mosque called the Islamic Institute and numerous churches, including Anglican parishes (St Matthew and St James and St Barnabas), Roman Catholic parishes (St Anthony of Padua), and four Free Churches (Dovedale Baptist Church, Allerton United Reformed, Elm Hall Drive Methodist, and Bethel Presbyterian Church in Wales). Dove Community Church ceased to exist in 2006 and was replaced by Wavertree Christian Fellowship. Another church in the area is Ramilies Road Chapel.

==Penny Lane==
Mossley Hill became famous when the Beatles&#x27; song &quot;Penny Lane&quot;, written about the Mossley Hill street of the same name, was released in 1967. The street receives thousands of annual tourist visits. The street was also briefly the home of singer Freddie Mercury during his pre-Queen days in 1969, when he lived above the Dovedale Towers pub while fronting a local band called Ibex.

<doc id="1023119" wikidata="Q15261816" url="?curid=1023119" title="Netherley, Liverpool">
<text>Netherley is an area in the city of Liverpool, Merseyside, England. It is bordered by Belle Vale and situated near to Huyton, Tarbock and Halewood.

Netherley is a leafy suburb of Liverpool, Merseyside, England. It is in the south of the city surrounded mostly by farmland and countryside, Liverpool City Council ward of Belle Vale. At the 2001 Census, Netherley had a population of 8,068 (3,703 males, 4,365 females).

==Description==
Netherley is predominantly a residential area located on the eastern side of Liverpool and is taken up by 44% green belt which restricts potential industrial growth.

However Netherley&#x27;s Caldway Drive is the new location for the Belle Vale Junior Football League which had to relocate from playing fields in nearby Belle Vale to accommodate the building of a new school.

== History ==
Netherley was built on farmland on the edge of Gateacre in 1968 for tenants moved out of unfit housing in Liverpool city centre.

Lee Manor High School, built in 1970, was originally called Netherley Community Comprehensive School. The school changed its name to Lee Manor High School in the early 1990s and closed in 2000.

Many of Netherley&#x27;s flats and maisonettes were demolished between 1983 and 1985 to make way for new houses. Lee Valley Housing took over management of council properties in 2003, making improvements to 1,700 homes.

==Crime==
The area has a relatively low crime rate and high employment in 2020.

==Economy==
The area lost a major local employer, HPL Jars &amp; Containers, in 2006. After thirty plus years, it was bought out by M&amp;H Plastics and production was transferred out of the area.

== Education ==
St. Gregory&#x27;s Catholic Primary School received an excellent Ofsted report in 2005. Built at the same time as the local housing, the school has adapted over the years to meet the demands of the area, such as admitting a large number of pupils from Cross Farm School which was closed by the local educational authority due to a surplus of places in the area. The nearby Norman Pannell Primary School is also a popular school in Netherley.

<doc id="1023122" wikidata="Q7085164" url="?curid=1023122" title="Old Swan">
<text>Old Swan is an eastern neighbourhood of Liverpool, Merseyside, England, bordered by Knotty Ash, Stoneycroft, Broadgreen, Fairfield and Wavertree. At the 2011 Census, the population was 16,461.

==Description==
Old Swan is centred on the road junction between Prescot Road, running east to west, Derby Lane (from the north) St Oswald Street (from the south) and Broadgreen Road (from the south-east). It is named after a public house called the Three Swans, which served the pack-horse route along Prescot Lane (now Prescot Road) in the 18th century. The name was derived from the coat of arms of local landowners, the Walton family.
The inn stood at the corner of Prescot Lane and Pettycoat Lane (now Broadgreen Road). The junction later acquired two more pubs, the Swan Vaults (now called the Old Swan) and the Cygnet (now closed), while the original pub was replaced by another, the Red House (now closed); this has become a branch of Costa Coffee.

==Geography==
The A57 road passes through Kensington and Fairfield before running through Old Swan and then through Knotty Ash, towards Prescot and on to St Helens.

Housing in the district is mostly in densely packed terraced houses, though there are exceptions. Doric Park is tucked away behind rows of terraced houses. Liverpool Shopping Park runs parallel to Old Swan. The retail park is currently being improved and phase 2 opened in autumn 2020.

==Health==
There are numerous primary care services located within Old Swan, including a NHS walk-in health centre, along with an urgent care unit, a GP practice on Derby Lane, and several pharmacies and opticians. 

There are also several dentists practices within the ward.

Old Swan also has an emergency ambulance station which is located on St. Oswalds Street.

==Government==
Old Swan&#x27;s representation on Liverpool City Council is largely through the Old Swan ward, though parts also lie in Tuebrook and Stoneycroft ward.
The elected councillors for Old Swan ward are Councillor William Shortall (Labour Party), Councillor Joanne Calvert (Independent) and Councillor Rona Heron (Liverpool Community Independents).

Old Swan is represented by Paula Barker MP (Labour Party) and is in the parliamentary constituency of Liverpool Wavertree; prior to the constituency&#x27;s re-creation the area was part of Liverpool Broadgreen.

==Council Services==

Old Swan library is managed by Liverpool City Council. It was built with Victorian black and white features, originally opening in 1913 as a reading room, and has its own garden, the entrance to which is on the A57.

==Economy==

Old Swan has a varied collection of clothes and food shops situated along Prescot Road serving local residents. In addition, the area is also served by a large Tesco supermarket and an Aldi facing it across St. Oswald Street. Further down Prescot Road, away from the city centre, is a Sainsbury&#x27;s supermarket in neighbouring Knotty Ash ward. During 2011, Asda took over the Netto premises, and it is now an Asda supermarket. In July 2015, work began refurbishing the Red House pub and a Costa Coffee store was opened later the same month.

==Transport==
Fairly regular bus routes 7, 8, 9 and 10/10A/10B connect Old Swan to Liverpool City Centre and in the opposite direction to Huyton, Prescot, St Helens and Warrington. Old Swan has other bus links - routes 60, 61, 62, 68/68A, 81/81A and 102, which do not serve Liverpool City Centre but provide important links to other areas of Liverpool including Aigburth, Anfield, Bootle, Childwall, Clubmoor, Croxteth, Fazakerley, Hunt&#x27;s Cross, Mossley Hill, Norris Green, Orrell Park, Speke, Toxteth, Tuebrook, Walton, Wavertree, West Derby, Woolton and Liverpool John Lennon Airport.

There is a bus depot in Old Swan on Green Lane. It is owned by Arriva North West.

The M62 motorway starts at the end of Broadgreen Road out of the city, and is the east gateway into the city via Edge Lane Drive.

The nearest railway stations to Old Swan are Broad Green railway station and Wavertree Technology Park railway station. Both are operated by Northern and served by local stopping trains to and from Liverpool Lime Street.
The Merseytram System (Line 2) was due to run through Old Swan but this has now been cancelled after funding from the British Government was denied. 

The Old Swan Tramway was one of the first street tramways in Britain, opening in 1861.

==Education==
There are six schools in Old Swan, including Broadgreen Primary School, St Anne&#x27;s Stanley C of E Primary, St Oswald&#x27;s Catholic Primary, Corinthian Avenue Primary, St Cuthbert Catholic Primary and Dixons Broadgreen Academy, a secondary school with an adjoining sixth form. There are also three nurseries in the area.

==Places of worship==
The Parish Church is St Anne&#x27;s on Prescot Road. In September 2022, Lady Dodd endowed stained glass windows at St Anne&#x27;s Church, in memory of her late husband, Sir Ken Dodd.

<doc id="1023126" wikidata="Q5378002" url="?curid=1023126" title="England Rural Development Programme">
<text>England Rural Development Programme was the instrument by which the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) fulfilled its rural development obligations in England, as set out by the European Union. It is derived primarily from Council Regulation European Union Regulation No. 1257/1999 and the related successive implementing Commission Regulations (1750/1999 and subsequent amending regulations 445/2002, 817/2004).

==England Rural Development Programme 2000-2006==

The England Rural Development Programme 2000-2006 included the following schemes:

*Environmental Stewardship Scheme (introduced in March 2005): Provides funding to farmers and other land managers in England who deliver effective environmental management on their land.
*Countryside Stewardship Scheme (closed to new applicants and superseded by the Environmental Stewardship Scheme): Made payments to farmers and other land managers to enhance and conserve English landscapes, their wildlife and history and to help people to enjoy them.
*Environmentally Sensitive Areas Scheme (closed to new applicants and superseded by the Environmental Stewardship Scheme): Offered incentives to encourage farmers to adopt agricultural practices which would safeguard and enhance parts of the country of particularly high landscape, wildlife or historic value.
*Energy Crops Scheme Provided establishment grants for short-rotation coppice and miscanthus, and aid to help short-rotation coppice growers set up producer groups.
*Farm Woodland Premium Scheme (closed to new applicants and superseded by the English Woodland Grant Scheme): Provided annual financial incentives to farmers to convert productive agricultural land to woodland with the objective of enhancing the environment, improving the landscape, providing new habitats and increasing biodiversity.
*Woodland Grant Scheme (closed to new applicants and superseded by the English Woodland Grant Scheme): Provided grants for the establishment of woodland.
*English Woodland Grant Scheme (introduced in 2005): Provides a suite of grants aimed at sustaining and increasing the public benefits given by existing woodlands and helping to create new woodlands to deliver additional public benefit. 
*Organic Farming Scheme (closed to new applicants and superseded by the Environmental Stewardship Scheme): Provided financial help during the process of converting from conventional to organic farming methods.
*Hill Farm Allowance: Aims to contribute to the maintenance of the social fabric in upland communities through support for continued agricultural land use and help to preserve the farmed upland environment by ensuring that land in the Less Favoured Areas is managed in a sustainable way.
*Rural Enterprise Scheme (closed to new applicants): Provided assistance for projects that help to develop more sustainable, diversified and enterprising rural economies and communities with the primary aim of helping farmers adapt to changing markets and develop new business opportunities. It also had a broader role in supporting the adaptation and development of the rural economy, community, heritage and environment.
*Vocational Training Scheme (closed to new applicants): Provided funding for vocational training activities that contribute to an improvement in the occupational skill and competence of farmers and other persons involved in forestry and farming activities and their conversion (i.e. diversification into non farming or forestry activities, or a change from one type of agricultural activity to another).
*Processing and Marketing Scheme (closed to new applicants): Provided support for capital investment in projects aimed at improving the processing and marketing of agricultural products in order to increase their competitiveness in the market place and their added value.

The England Rural Development Programme for 2000-2006 ended on 31 December 2006.

==Further EU legislation==

Council Regulation (EC) 1290/2005 of 21 June 2005 on the financing of the common agricultural policy provided for the creation of the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) for the financing of rural development programmes. Council Regulation 1698/2005 set out four objectives for support for rural development:

(a) improving the competitiveness of agriculture and forestry by supporting restructuring, development and innovation;
(b) improving the environment and the countryside by supporting land management;
(c) improving the quality of life in rural areas and encouraging diversification of economic activity.

to be achieved by means of four axes:

Axis I: Improving the competitiveness of the agricultural and forestry sector
Axis II: Improving the environment and the countryside
Axis III: The quality of life in rural areas and diversification of the rural economy
Axis IV: Leader

Each axis contained a range of measures that may be adopted by Member States.

==Rural Development Programme for England 2007-2013==

A consultation on the priorities for the next Programme for 2007-2013 ran from 27 February to 22 May 2006. However, finalisation of the Programme has been delayed due to the EU regulation that would give legal basis to European Council agreement on voluntary modulation, a method of funding which switches money from direct payments to farmers to Rural Development Programmes, having been blocked by the European Parliament.

On 19 March 2007, the European Agriculture Council voted unanimously in favour of a regulation on voluntary modulation tabled by the German Presidency. The European Parliament agreed, on the basis of this text and associated declarations, to lift its 20% reserve on EU rural development budgets for 2007. This enables Member States to proceed to finalising their rural development programmes.

Defra announced a further consultation on the draft England Rural Development Programme 2007-2013 in the context of the Programme&#x27;s likely overall impact on the environment. The closing date is 5 July 2007. According to this consultation document, the measures proposed for the England Rural Development Programme 2007-2013 are:

Axis I:

*Provision of advisory services to farmers and forest holders.
*Support for the setting up of farm management, farm relief and farm advisory services, and forestry advisory services.
*Modernisation of agricultural holdings.
*Improvement of the economic value of forests.
*Support for adding value to agricultural and forestry products.
*Promotion of cooperation for the development of new products, processes and technologies.
*Support for investment in infrastructure related to the development and adaptation of agriculture and forestry.

Axis II:

*Support for farming in Less Favoured Areas.
*Support for agri-environment schemes.
*Support for non-productive investments in agri-environment measures.
*Support for the establishment of permanent woodland and short-rotation coppice on agricultural land.
*Support for the management of existing woods and forests.
*Promotion of cooperation for the development of new products, processes and technologies.
*Support for non-productive investments in forestry measures.

Axis III:

*Support for farm business restructuring through the development of diversified activities.
*Support for the creation and development of micro-enterprises.
*Encouragement for tourism activities.
*Provision for more and better basic services for the economy and the rural population.
*Support for village renewal and development.
*Conservation and enhancement of the rural heritage.
*Provision of training in support of measures in Axis III.
*Provision of support for skills acquisition and animation with a view to preparing and implementing a local development strategy.

Axis IV:
*Support for Local Action Groups.
*Support for cooperation actions across regions or countries.
*Support for the effective design and implementation of LAG local development strategies.

==Rural Development Programme for England (RDPE) 2014-2020==
From 2014 to 2020 Rural Development Programme for England (RDPE) was originally adopted by the European Commission on 13 February 2015. The document follows the format laid down in the Commission Implementing Regulation (EC) No 808/2014. Version 15 was finally modified on 8 June 2022 in a document endorsed by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development and Defra.

<doc id="1023147" wikidata="Q215427" url="?curid=1023147" title="Fireball (album)">
<text>Fireball is the fifth studio album by English rock band Deep Purple, released in 1971 as the second album with the Mark II line-up, consisting of Ritchie Blackmore, Ian Gillan, Roger Glover, Jon Lord and Ian Paice. It was recorded at various times between September 1970 and June 1971. It became the first of the band&#x27;s three UK No. 1 albums, though it did not stay on the charts as long as its predecessor, &quot;Deep Purple in Rock&quot;. Even though the album has sold over a million copies in the UK, it has never received a certification there.

==Background==
The album was the first that Deep Purple worked on after establishing their career with &quot;In Rock&quot;, which had been a critical and commercial success, staying on the charts for over a year. Because of this, the group were in continual demand for live concerts, which began to affect band members&#x27; health. Keyboardist Jon Lord suffered back problems (dating back to his days in The Artwoods when he had to transport a Hammond organ to gigs without the assistance of a road crew), and bassist Roger Glover had stomach problems which prevented him from performing live on several occasions. Guitarist Ritchie Blackmore felt he had been vindicated by the decision to concentrate on hard rock, and believed the group&#x27;s success was largely because of him. This led to increasing conflict with singer Ian Gillan and the relationship between the two began to become strained.

As with the previous album, sessions for the follow-up to &quot;In Rock&quot; were booked in the space of many months in between the bands touring commitments. On the first of these, in September 1970, the band completed just one song, &quot;Anyone&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, with the band struggling to come up with more ideas.

Further material for the album was rehearsed in Welcombe Manor, Devonshire in December 1970. The band cancelled several live performances in order to put together material that could serve as a follow-up to &quot;In Rock&quot;. &quot;Strange Kind of Woman&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Alone&quot; and &quot;The Mule&quot; were written during these sessions, and recorded in January 1971, with the first two coupled together as Deep Purple&#x27;s next single in February, to keep the band in the public eye while the album was still being worked on. Another song, &quot;Freedom&quot; was written at Welcombe and recorded during these sessions, but didn&#x27;t make the final track listing. Other material was recorded in-between gigs through to March. &quot;Strange Kind of Woman&quot; was added to the group&#x27;s live set at the end of January, quickly developing into a showpiece for Gillan to sing back Blackmore&#x27;s guitar riffs in a call and response manner. The last song to be recorded was &quot;Demon&#x27;s Eye&quot; in June.

Meanwhile, their American record label, Warner Bros, grew impatient waiting for the new album, as the band had an American tour booked for July. As a result, &quot;Demon&#x27;s Eye&quot; could not make the final tracklist there, with the label opting to include &quot;Strange Kind Of Woman&quot; instead.

==Chart performance==
&quot;Fireball&quot; reached the No. 1 position on the UK albums chart, while also hitting No. 1 in several other European countries, such as Germany, Austria, and Sweden. In North America, it outperformed its predecessor, &quot;In Rock&quot;, reaching No. 32 in the US and No. 24 in Canada.

==Singles==
The original UK version had &quot;Demon&#x27;s Eye&quot; as its third track, but did not include &quot;Strange Kind of Woman&quot;, which was instead released as a single there. The US version includes the latter track in place of the former. The boogie-inspired &quot;Strange Kind of Woman&quot; single reached No. 8 in the UK and Germany, and No. 1 in Denmark. &quot;Fireball&quot;, the album&#x27;s title track, was also released as a single and reached No. 15 in the UK.

&quot;Strange Kind of Woman&quot; has been a staple of the live set up to the present day, and &quot;Fireball&quot; also made a few live appearances, mainly as an encore as it required Ian Paice to use a double bass drum, which was set up during the break after the main set. &quot;Strange Kind of Woman&quot; and &quot;The Mule&quot; were played regularly live throughout 1972 (and appear on the live album &quot;Made in Japan&quot;), with the latter replacing an instrumental &quot;Paint It Black&quot; as a vehicle for Paice&#x27;s drum solo. 1971&#x27;s Fireball Tour frequently featured &quot;No No No&quot; in addition to the three aforementioned songs.

&quot;Anyone&#x27;s Daughter&quot; was played on the 1993–1994 tours, while &quot;Fools&quot;, &quot;No One Came&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Alone&quot;, and &quot;Demon&#x27;s Eye&quot; have all made periodic appearances in various tours since 1996.

==Releases and reissues==
The original vinyl release was in a gatefold sleeve, with a generic Harvest LP-bag and a lyric-insert.

In September 2010, a limited-edition 24k gold CD was released by Audio Fidelity. The CD was mastered from the original master tapes by Steve Hoffman. The gold CD contained the original USA track listing with &quot;Strange Kind of Woman&quot; and does not have &quot;Demon&#x27;s Eye&quot;.

==Response==
Most of the band do not consider the album a classic, although it is one of Ian Gillan&#x27;s favourites. He stated in a 1974 interview: &quot;The reason I liked that so much was because I thought, from a writing point of view, it was really the beginning of tremendous possibilities of expression. And some of the tracks on that album are really, really inventive.&quot; However, Gillan also said that the inclusion of &quot;Anyone&#x27;s Daughter&quot; on the album was &quot;a good bit of fun, but a mistake.&quot;

Ritchie Blackmore, in particular, stated publicly that he was not overly pleased with &quot;Fireball&quot;. He said of the production: &quot;That was a bit of a disaster, because it was thrown together in the studio. Managerial pressure, we had no time. &#x27;You gotta play here, here, there, then you&#x27;ve got to make an LP.&#x27; I told them, &#x27;if you want an LP, you&#x27;ve got to give us time.&#x27; But they wouldn&#x27;t. I just threw ideas to the group that I thought up on the spur of the moment.&quot;

Jon Lord stated that &quot;Fireball&quot; &quot;wanders slightly&quot; and &quot;goes to places that the band wasn&#x27;t expecting it to go to.&quot; Lord did praise several songs on the album, including &quot;No No No&quot; and &quot;Fools&quot;, and particularly singled out Ian Paice&#x27;s drumming on the title track.

==Later influences==
On 9 April 2011 episode of &quot;That Metal Show&quot;, guitar virtuoso Yngwie Malmsteen stated that his older sister had given him &quot;Fireball&quot; when he was eight years old, and &quot;it changed everything&quot; for him. Similarly, Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich stated that he purchased a copy of &quot;Fireball&quot; within 12 hours after his father had taken him to a 1973 Deep Purple concert in Copenhagen, and he credits the concert and album for sparking his interest in hard rock music.

Likewise, Michael Monroe stated on Eddie Trunk&#x27;s podcast that it was the first album he ever bought, and one of the first he ever heard along with &quot;Led Zeppelin II&quot;, and was a major influence to get him into a career in rock and roll.

King Diamond also mentions &quot;Fireball&quot; as the first studio album he purchased as a teenager and an important influence in his future career.

<doc id="1023150" wikidata="Q1815874" url="?curid=1023150" title="Pirate ship (ride)">
<text>A pirate ship is a type of amusement ride based on pirate ships, consisting of an open, seated gondola (usually in the style of a pirate ship) which swings back and forth, subjecting the rider to various levels of angular momentum. A variant where the riders must pull on ropes to swing the ride is known as a swing boat.

The first known predecessor of the ride was invented by Charles Albert Marshall of Tulsa, Oklahoma between 1893 and 1897. This ride was originally called &quot;The Ocean Wave&quot;.

The Ocean Wave was first used in the Marshall Bros Circus in 1897. The circus was run by Charles and his brothers Mike, Will, Ed, Tim, friends, and family.

== Height requirements ==
Height requirements for this type of ride vary from park to park. For example, Hersheypark, which has a Huss Pirate Boat, has a height requirement of or more to ride, while at LaRonde, which also has a Huss Pirate Boat, riders must be or taller. Huss recommends that the lowest a height requirement should be is , but parks can make it higher if they choose to.

== Pirate ship rides ==
There are a number of Swinging Ship-type rides, and multiple manufacturers.
*Chance Rides&#x27; original version is known as the &quot;Sea Dragon&quot; which are permanent or two trailer portable models. The later version is known as &quot;Pharaoh&#x27;s Fury&quot; and could be permanent or transported on one 53-foot trailer. 
*Fabbri&#x27;s version is known as the &quot;Pirate Ship&quot;, and can hold 40 passengers.
*HUSS&#x27; version is known as the &quot;Pirate Boat&quot;, and can hold up to 54 passengers in 9 rows.
*Intamin version is called &quot;Bounty&quot;.
*Mulligan&#x27;s version is known as the &quot;Sea Ray&quot;.
*SBF Visa&#x27;s version is known as &quot;Pirate&quot; and can accommodate 32 passengers.
*SDC makes a version called the &quot;Pirate Ship&quot;.
*Zamperla&#x27;s version is known as the &quot;Galleon&quot;, and has four sizes available, which can hold 33, 42, 54 or 84 passengers.
*Zierer&#x27;s version is known as the &quot;Viking Ship&quot; and can accommodate 40 passengers.
*Metallbau Emmeln&#x27;s version is known as the &quot;Schiffsschaukeln&quot; and can accommodate 24/40 passengers.
*Helmut Hauser
*DAL Amusements
*Staudenmeyer &amp; Weidmann&#x27;s version was most iconic from Wicksteed Park&#x27;s double pirate ship.

== Variants ==
* The Looping Starship, manufactured by Intamin is similar to a pirate ship, except that goes upside down. This gives the rider a feel of zero gravity for a moment as it swings back down while making 360° loops.
* Manufactured by Anton Schwarzkopf, the Shuttle Boat is a pirate ship ride which instead of swinging back and forth rides on a half pipe track. This idea would later be adopted by Zamperla and turned into the Rockin&#x27; Tug, featuring a ship that rotates about its own axis also.
* Some traveling fairs in Europe have pirate ships in which the riders can choose to stand up in cages located at the ends of the ships. These do not go upside down, but do swing to a horizontal position.
The names listed are given by the manufacturers, and individual parks may change the name of the ride itself. Many parks use a Viking Ship theme for their ride. Smaller versions of the ride are often called &quot;Swingboats&quot;.

<doc id="1023151" wikidata="Q3660981" url="?curid=1023151" title="Patterson Park">
<text>Patterson Park is an urban park in Southeast Baltimore, Maryland, United States, adjacent to the neighborhoods of Canton, Highlandtown, Patterson Park, and Butchers Hill. It is bordered by East Baltimore Street, Eastern Avenue, South Patterson Park Avenue, and South Linwood Avenue. The Patterson Park extension lies to the east of the main park, and is bordered by East Pratt Street, South Ellwood Avenue, and Eastern Avenue.

Patterson Park was established in 1827 and named for William Patterson (1752–1835). The park consists of open fields of grass, large trees, paved walkways, historic battle sites, a lake, playgrounds, athletic fields, a swimming pool, an ice skating rink and other signature attractions and buildings. At , Patterson Park is not the city&#x27;s largest park; however, it is nicknamed &quot;Best Backyard in Baltimore.&quot;

== Attractions and activities ==

Patterson Park has four main entrances at each corner. Its notable attractions include the boat lake (where fishing is permitted), the marble fountain, the Pulaski Monument, and the Patterson Park Observatory. The Patterson Park Observatory was built in 1891 as an observation tower for viewing the city and is still open to visitors. The park is also home to the Virginia S. Baker Recreation Center.

The park has smooth pathways suitable for biking and jogging. The sports fields are open for use to anyone who wants to play a game, and there are public tennis courts as well. There are two playgrounds for children as well as a fenced-in dog park. There is a swimming pool open during the summer and an ice skating rink that operates during winter. From spring to early autumn, several festivals are held in the park. The neighborhood surrounding the park is part of an innovative urban renewal campaign by the city and neighborhood leaders.

== Nature ==

There are no heavily forested areas of Patterson Park; however, there are plenty of open spaces. The boat lake, reconstructed in 2001 and set for a small renovation in 2022, is inhabited mostly by mallard ducks and nesting Green Heron, but its avian visitors include American Coots and Wood Ducks. Great Blue Heron and Black-crowned Night-Heron are occasionally seen on the lake. There are also fish, frogs, and turtles in the lake.

== History ==
The high ground at the northwest corner of Patterson Park, called Hampstead Hill, was the key defensive position for U.S. forces against British ground forces in the Battle of Baltimore during the War of 1812. The redoubt was known as Rodgers Bastion, or Sheppard&#x27;s Bastion, and was the centerpiece of the earthen line dug to defend the eastern approach to Baltimore, from the outer harbor in Canton north to Belair Road. On September 13, 1814, the day after the Battle of North Point, some 4,300 British troops advanced north on North Point Road, then west along the Philadelphia Road toward Baltimore, forcing U.S. troops to retreat to the defensive line. When the British began probing actions, the American line was defended by 100 cannon and more than 10,000 troops. The American defenses were far stronger than anticipated, and U.S. defenders at Fort McHenry successfully stopped British naval forces from advancing close enough to lend artillery support, and British attempts to flank the defense were countered. Thus, before dawn on September 14, 1814, British commander Colonel Arthur Brooke decided the land campaign was a lost cause, and ordered the retreat back to the ships, and the United States was thus victorious in the Battle of Baltimore.

William Patterson (d. 1835), a Baltimore merchant, donated to the city for a public walk in 1827, and the city purchased an additional from the Patterson family in 1860. Additions and improvements to the park made after 1859 were funded through the city&#x27;s &quot;park tax&quot; on its streetcars, which was initially set at 20% of the fare. During the Civil War, the site was used as a Union troop encampment. Additional purchases in later years increased the park size to its present .

Several public accommodations at the park such as the swimming pools, picnic pavilions, and playgrounds were managed as &quot;separate but equal&quot; until they were desegregated in 1956. The park is included in the Baltimore National Heritage Area.

On October 10, 1962, President John F. Kennedy visited Baltimore and landed in his helicopter at the park and took an open top car to the 5th Regiment Armory. He was in town prior to the midterm elections to stump for the Democratic ticket.

During the George Floyd protests of 2020, the Pulaski monument was vandalized, being spray-painted red with the words &quot;White Lies&quot; spray-painted on the base.

=== Patterson Park Observatory ===

The Observatory, previously known as the Pagoda, was designed in 1890 and completed in 1892 by Charles H. Latrobe, who was the general superintendent and engineer under the Park Commission, led along with architect George A. Frederick, who also designed Baltimore City Hall. It was designed as a people&#x27;s lookout tower with an Asian motif, inspired by Latrobe&#x27;s fascination with the East. The Observatory was designated as a Baltimore City Landmark in 1982.

<text>Stanisław Mieczysław Mazur (; 1 January 1905 – 5 November 1981) was a Polish mathematician and a member of the Polish Academy of Sciences.

Mazur made important contributions to geometrical methods in linear and nonlinear functional analysis and to the study of Banach algebras. He was also interested in summability theory, infinite games and computable functions.

==Lwów and Warsaw==
Mazur was a student of Stefan Banach at University of Lwów. His doctorate, under Banach&#x27;s supervision, was awarded in 1935. Mazur, with Juliusz Schauder, was an Invited Speaker of the ICM in 1936 in Oslo.

Mazur was a close collaborator with Banach at Lwów and was a member of the Lwów School of Mathematics, where he participated in the mathematical activities at the Scottish Café. On 6 November 1936, he posed the &quot;basis problem&quot; of determining whether every Banach space has a Schauder basis, with Mazur promising a &quot;live goose&quot; as a reward: 37 years later and in a ceremony that was broadcast throughout Poland, Mazur awarded a live goose to Per Enflo for constructing a counter-example.

From 1948 Mazur worked at the University of Warsaw. He also worked at the State Institute of Mathematics, which was incorporated into the Polish Academy of Sciences in 1952.

<text>Who Do We Think We Are is the seventh studio album by the English rock band Deep Purple, released on 12 January 1973 in the US and in February 1973 in the UK. It was Deep Purple&#x27;s last album by the Mark II line-up with singer Ian Gillan and bassist Roger Glover until 1984’s &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot;.

Musically, the record showed a move to a more blues-based sound, even featuring scat singing. Although its production and the band&#x27;s behaviour after its release showed the group in turmoil, with frontman Gillan remarking that &quot;we&#x27;d all had major illnesses&quot; and felt considerable fatigue, the album was a commercial success. Deep Purple became the top-selling U.S. artist in 1973. The album featured the energetic hard-rock single &quot;Woman from Tokyo,&quot; which while scarcely played during the 1970s, would become a live staple from the band&#x27;s 1984 reunion onward.

==Recording==

&quot;Who Do We Think We Are&quot; was recorded in Rome in July 1972 and Walldorf near Frankfurt in October 1972, using the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio.

&quot;Woman from Tokyo,&quot; the first track recorded in July, is about touring Japan for the first time (e.g. the lyric &quot;Fly into the Rising Sun&quot;). The only other track released from the Rome sessions is the outtake &quot;Painted Horse.&quot; The rest were recorded in Frankfurt after more touring (including Japan, which yielded &quot;Made in Japan&quot;). The group, riven with internal strife, struggled to come up with tracks they agreed upon. Members were not speaking to each other and many songs were finished only after schedules were arranged so they could record parts separately.

Of &quot;Mary Long,&quot; Gillan said: &quot;Mary Whitehouse and Lord Longford were particularly high-profile figures at the time, with very waggy-waggy finger attitudes… It was about the standards of the older generation, the whole moral framework, intellectual vandalism – all of the things that exist throughout the generations… Mary Whitehouse and Lord Longford became one person, fusing together to represent the hypocrisy that I saw at the time.&quot;

Ian Gillan left the band following this album, citing internal tensions – widely thought to include a feud with guitarist Ritchie Blackmore. However, in an interview supporting the Mark II Purple comeback album &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot;, Gillan stated that fatigue and management had a lot to do with it:
Added Jerry Bloom, editor of the book &quot;More Black than Purple&quot;:
The last Mark II concert in the 1970s before Gillan and Glover left was in Osaka, Japan on 29 June 1973.

==Album title and artwork==
The original album artwork has many quoted articles from newspapers. One of them is from magazine &quot;Melody Maker&quot; of July 1972, where drummer Ian Paice remarks:

 Another clipping simply has the Paice quote &quot;I bought it so i&#x27;ll bloody well boot it&quot;, which was his reply to an angry letter admonishing the drummer for kicking over his drum kit at the end of a live performance on the television show South Bank Pops from 1970.

On the back cover of earlier pressings, the opening track is listed as &quot;Woman from Tokayo.&quot; Coincidentally, Ian Gillan&#x27;s pronunciation of &quot;Tokyo&quot; does resemble this misspelling.

==Release==
Despite the chaotic birth of the album, &quot;Woman from Tokyo&quot; was a hit single and other songs picked up considerable airplay. In the United States, it sold half a million copies in its first three months, achieving a gold record award faster than any Deep Purple album released up to that time.

It hit number 4 in the UK charts and number 15 in the US charts. These numbers helped make Deep Purple the best-selling artist in the United States in 1973 (with the release of &quot;Made in Japan&quot; and the prior acclaim for &quot;Machine Head&quot; helping considerably).

In 2000 &quot;Who Do We Think We Are&quot; was remastered and re-released with bonus tracks. The last bonus track is a lengthy instrumental jam called &quot;First Day Jam&quot; that features Ritchie Blackmore on bass. Roger Glover, the group&#x27;s usual bassist, was absent, allegedly lost in traffic. Roger also did remixes of many tracks, but Mary Long was not included (it appears on 2002 box set, &quot;Listen, Learn, Read On&quot;).

In 2005 Audio Fidelity released their own re-mastering of the album on 24 karat Gold CD.

==Reception==

The album received mixed reviews. Ann Cheauvy of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; reviewed the album negatively and, comparing &quot;Who Do We Think We Are&quot; to Deep Purple&#x27;s breakthrough album &quot;In Rock&quot;, wrote that the former &quot;sounds so damn tired in spots that it&#x27;s downright disconcerting&quot;, and &quot;the band seems to just barely summon up enough energy to lay down the rhythm track, much less improvise.&quot; In a retrospective critical review, Eduardo Rivadavia of AllMusic expresses the same opinion and writes that, apart from &quot;Woman from Tokyo&quot;, the album&#x27;s songs are &quot;wildly inconsistent and find the band simply going through the motions&quot;, although he does praise &quot;Rat Bat Blue&quot;.

On the contrary, reviewer David Bowling writes in the Blogcritics site that &quot;Who Do We Think We Are&quot; &quot;is one of the band’s strongest and stands near the top of the Deep Purple catalogue in terms of quality&quot;, providing &quot;some of the best hard rock of the era&quot;.

<doc id="1023169" wikidata="Q783154" url="?curid=1023169" title="Polythene (album)">
<text>Polythene is the debut studio album by Welsh rock band Feeder. It was released 19 May 1997 on the Echo Label, and then re-issued on 28 October in the same year in an Enhanced CD version, featuring their UK top 40 breakthrough single &quot;High&quot; and its video. The original version of the album was deleted soon after and is relatively rare due to this reason.

Despite sizeable critical success, the album had minor commercial success, charting at number 65 in the UK albums chart. However, &quot;Polythene&quot; would later achieve Gold record status despite never having appeared in the top 50 of the album charts, a rare feat reflecting steady and consistent sales over a period of 20 years, rather than strong initial sales.

The album saw the group&#x27;s early take on a more grunge-influenced sound, which was not seen on their other albums that followed. Many critics at the time called the band the UK&#x27;s answer to the Smashing Pumpkins.

In April 1998, a VHS compilation of the music videos for the album&#x27;s singles was released, titled .

==Background==
&quot;Polythene&quot;&#x27;s working title was &quot;Here in the Bubble&quot;.

Prior to the release of &quot;Polythene&quot;, Feeder had released several singles, which helped them build a cult following.

The album carries over two tracks – &quot;Descend&quot; and &quot;Stereo World&quot; – from Feeder&#x27;s earlier EP, &quot;Swim&quot;.

==Reception==


The band&#x27;s second single off &quot;Polythene&quot;, &quot;Cement&quot; was given a 5/5 review rating by &quot;Kerrang!&quot;, and their &quot;Single of the Week&quot; accolade. The album itself was ranked 6th in the magazine&#x27;s best albums of the year chart. Metal Hammer voted it the best album of 1997 in its end of year critic&#x27;s poll.

&quot;Kerrang!&quot; later included &quot;Polythene&quot; in their &quot;200 Albums For the Year 2000&quot; list in the &quot;Essential Britrock&quot; category. It appeared at number 87 in an early 2005 &quot;Kerrang!&quot; magazine vote, ranking the top 100 British rock albums of all-time.

<doc id="1023174" wikidata="Q4094" url="?curid=1023174" title="Hilden">
<text>Hilden () is a town in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia. It is situated in the District of Mettmann, west of Solingen and east of Düsseldorf on the right side of the Rhine. It is a middle sized industrial town with a forest and numerous attractions.

The Mayor is Claus Pommer, who took office in 2020.

==Geography==

With approx. 57,000 inhabitants, Hilden is the fourth largest city in the District of Mettmann. In contrast to the surrounding cities, it has no suburban districts or incorporated villages. Hilden has a compact urbanized city centre and borders some smaller woods.

==History==
Hilden was named in written sources already in the 11th century. In the 13th century in the centre of the early settlement a Romanesque church was erected, which during the Reformation became Protestant. Later a second church for Catholics had been built. In the time of industrialization many factories especially in textiles, engineering and painting had been founded. In both World Wars the people of Hilden had many losses, a list of the soldiers&#x27; names is written on a memorial. During the Nazi rule Jews and opponents of the regime have been persecuted. In the factories forced labourers, allegedly 3000, have been employed.

In 1945 American troops, then units of the British Army of the Rhine had occupied the town, stationed in the local barracks erected in 1937. The relationship between the population and the British soldiers were good especially after Germany&#x27;s accession to NATO in May 1955, when former adversaries became allies. The initiative of the regiment to get in touch with local citizens led to the twin partnership Hilden - Warrington (1968), to school exchanges and various contacts between people. In March 1968 the British troops left Hilden, having been replaced by German military units which took over the barracks.

In the aftermath of the War refugees from East Germany found a new home in Hilden nearly doubling its population. In 1956 the Council of Hilden granted patronage to the association of refugees from the town and district of Wohlau, Lower Silesia. They held several meetings in Hilden with more than 1000 former Wohlau citizens having received refuge in various parts of Germany.

Since the 1960s thousands of foreign migrant workers were employed in various industrial sections. An economical boom in the following decades contributed to further expansion of the town.

==Politics==
Since World War II, Hilden had six mayors:

* Robert Gies – a Social Democrat and Mayor (1952–1969)
* Ellen Wiederhold – a Christian Democrat, the first female and longest ruling Mayor (1969–1994)
* Günter Scheib – a Social Democrat and Mayor (1994–2009)
* Horst Thiele – a Social Democrat and Mayor (2009–2014)
* Birgit Alkenings – a Social Democrat and Mayor (2014–2020)
* Claus Pommer – non-party and Mayor (2020 – now)
The current City Council, elected in 2009, consists of 40 members: 13 Christian Democrats, 13 Social Democrats, 6 Liberals, 4 Greens, 4 Civic Action and 4 Independents. In summer 2010 one member left the Christian Democrat faction and two members left the Liberals founding their own faction. Missing a formal coalition the Council rules with changing majorities.

==Economy==

Hilden was once home to textile factories, a big paint enterprise, pharmaceutical and metallurgic companies. After the economic crisis in the 1980s many of these companies have been closed. Flourishing companies now include the German headquarters of 3M and Qiagen, as well as many other businesses and enterprises from the technology and logistics sector.

==Transportation==
Until the 1960s Hilden had an old fashioned tram, that connected the city in three directions with Düsseldorf-Benrath, Solingen-Ohligs and Wuppertal-Vohwinkel. It was nearly a tourist attraction, as it was one of the few trams that operated on metre gauge track. Meanwhile, the trams have been replaced by buses.

Hilden station has local trains operating to Düsseldorf, Solingen and Dortmund. This service is now operated as line S 1 of the Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn, stopping at several newly built stations, including Hilden Süd station. Line S 1 continues past Düsseldorf to Düsseldorf Airport station and the Ruhr area.

Hilden is also accessible by the nearby intersecting freeways A3, A59 and A46.

Within Hilden, residential speed limits were reduced to in 1992 to encourage cycling. The main street in the center became a pedestrian zone.

==Festivities==
* carnival parade (in February)
* annual &quot;Hildener Jazztage&quot; - Hilden jazz days (in May/June)
* Schützenfest - festivity of St. Sebastian&#x27;s brotherhood (in June)
* exhibition of fire fighters&#x27; brigade (August/September)
* Day of German Reunification (on October 3)
* Christmas market (in December)

==Notable people==
*Wilhelm Fabry (1560–1634), founder of the scientific surgery
*Max Volmer (1885–1965), physical chemist
*Christian Petzold (born 1960), movie director 
*Michael Tarnat (born 1969), footballer
*Blumio (born 1985), rapper
*Julian Hanses (born 1997), racing driver

==Twin towns – sister cities==

Hilden is twinned with:
* Warrington, England, United Kingdom (1968)
* Nové Město nad Metují, Czech Republic (1989)

<text>Avellino () is a town and &quot;comune&quot;, capital of the province of Avellino in the Campania region of southern Italy. It is situated in a plain surrounded by mountains east of Naples and is an important hub on the road from Salerno to Benevento.

=== Climate ===

==History==
Before the Roman conquest, the ancient Abellinum was a centre of the Samnite Hirpini, located on the Civita hill some outside the current town, in what is now Atripalda. The city could correspond to the ancient &quot;Velecha&quot;, documented by coins found in the area. &quot;Abellinum&quot; was conquered by the Romans in 293 BC, changing name several times in the following centuries (&quot;Veneria&quot;, &quot;Livia&quot;, &quot;Augusta&quot;, &quot;Alexandriana&quot;, and &quot;Abellinatium&quot;). However, the construction of a true Roman town occurred only after the conquest by Lucius Cornelius Sulla in the civil wars in 89 BC. He razed the old site and in 82 BC founded the colony Veneria Abellinatium on the left bank of the river Sabato.

The new city was surrounded by massive walls and had an orthogonal &quot;hippodamian&quot; urban layout. In 7 AD Augustus changed its name to Livia Augusta in honour of his wife, Livia Drusilla who owned the territories between Abellinum and Aeclanum. In the 3rd century Alexander Severus expanded the colony under the title of Livia Augusta Alexandrina with a massive immigration of oriental settlers. This helped to spread ancient Levantine cults such as Sol Invictus in the territory.

There followed economic crises (III and IV centuries), violent earthquakes (346) and disastrous volcanic eruptions (472). The town was Christianised around 500, becoming an episcopal seat.

There were invasions of the Goths (535–555) and the Vandals. After the Lombard conquest of southern Italy, the ancient city was abandoned in 568 (it is disputed if completely or partly) and a new settlement grew on the Terra hill, corresponding to the modern Avellino.

Defended by a castle, it became part of the Duchy (later Principality) of Benevento and, after the latter&#x27;s fall, of the Principality of Salerno. In 1100, during the Norman rule of southern Italy, it was acquired by Riccardo dell&#x27;Aquila. Later, King Charles I of Anjou assigned it to the Montfort family, who were succeeded by the Del Balzo and the Filangieri.

The feudal rights to Avellino were purchased in 1581 by Don Marino I Caracciolo, duke of Atripalda, of a patrician family of Naples, who was made Prince of Avellino in 1589. Avellino became the main seat of the Caracciolo. Don Marino&#x27;s son and grandson were consecutively Grand Chancellor of the Kingdom of Naples and chevaliers of the Order of the Golden Fleece. The grandson, Don Marino II (1587–1630), was the patron of Giambattista Basile, author of the &quot;Pentamerone&quot;.

In 1820 Avellino was seat of revolutionary riots. However, the Unification of Italy some fifty years later did not bring any benefit to the city, being cut off from the main railway line Naples-Benevento-Foggia, and far from the sea as well.

In 1943 the city was bombed by Allied planes in an attempt to cut off the retreat of German panzer units over the important Bridge of Ferriera.

Avellino has suffered from seismic activity throughout its history and was struck hard by the earthquakes of 23 November 1980 and 14 February 1981. Avellino has also received ashfall from numerous eruptions of Vesuvius which lies almost due west; the city sits on type locality of pumice deposited from a Plinian eruption of Vesuvius about 3800 years ago.

==Government==
==Economy==
The 1980 Irpinia earthquake represented a turning point for the town and for the entire province of Avellino. Large amounts of money flowed in for infrastructure investment, and the extra money generated innovation and economic expansion more generally. By 2008 a per capita annual income level of €20,180 placed Avellino well above the regional average in terms of individual prosperity.

===Agriculture===
Agriculture was at the heart of Avellino&#x27;s economy until the mid-1970s, since then many younger people have moved away from family farms, and sometimes also migrated away from the area, in pursuit of higher wages. Nevertheless, tobacco, viticulture and especially the production of hazelnuts remain important to the local economy and, with increased investment in recent years, employ a number of people.

===Industry===
The manufacturing sector plays an important role in Avellino, with two industrial zones on the eastern and western peripheries of the main urban area, at &quot;Pianodardine&quot; suburb, Montefredane, Prata di Principato Ultra and Pratola Serra. Many small and medium-sized businesses are located in the industrial zones, including notably FMA (&quot;Fabbrica Motori Automobilistici&quot;, Automobile Engine Factory) who produces Fiat Pratola Serra modular engines for Fiat, Opel, Jeep, Lancia and Alfa Romeo, and creator of the &quot;multi-jet&quot; (fuel injected) car engine. 

==Transportation==

===Air===
The nearest airports are those of Salerno-Pontecagnano, to the southwest and Napoli-Capodichino, to the west.

===Rail===
The station, located where the city limits of Avellino meet Atripalda, was once the terminus for passenger rail services to Benevento, Cancello, and Rocchetta Sant&#x27;Antonio. The station provided a reliable link with Benevento and Salerno. A few long-distance trains to Naples and Rome were also added to try and reinvigorate the local economy, but these services came to an end in 2010, following cuts that saw the closure of the railway between Avellino and Rocchetta Sant&#x27;Antonio. A regional decree dated 9 August 2012 forced the closure of the remaining 19 local rail services. However, in response to protests from rail users a small number of services were reinstated on 28 October 2012.

===Road===
Avellino is served by two access points (&quot;Avellino Est/East&quot; and &quot;Avellino Ovest/West&quot;) on the A16 Autostrada (originally numbered A17, and known also as &quot;Autostrada of the two seas&quot;) which runs approximately west–east and links Naples to the west with Canosa di Puglia and Bari on the farther side of the country. Near Naples the A16 connects with the A3 Autostrada, ensuring good road access with the principal population centres across Italy. Also important is the so-called &quot;Ofantina&quot; superstrada (dual carriageway) linking with several locally important towns to the east and south, en route to Salerno.

===Public transport===

Public transportation in Avellino is provided by AIR Campania. Since 2023, the service includes trolleybuses (locally referred to, inaccurately, as the &quot;metropolitana leggera&quot;, or light metro), on a new trolleybus route that opened on 3 April 2023. A trolleybus system previously operated in Avellino from 1947 to 1973.

==Sport==

==Main sights==

The ruins of the ancient Roman Abellinum are situated near the modern village of Atripalda, east of modern Avellino. They include the &quot;forum&quot;, faced by temples, baths, parts of the Serino aqueduct and a patrician &quot;domus&quot;. There was also an amphitheatre and a brothel.

Avellino Cathedral, with its Romanesque crypt, stands on the site of a rich Roman villa which was built around 129 BC and abandoned after the eruption of Vesuvius, and an earthquake in 346 AD. The church and convent of Santa Maria delle Grazie were built in 1580.

There are some remains of the Lombard castle in Piazza Castello (Castle Square). Because the castle was built at the base of a small valley, its tactical purpose continues to puzzle modern-day historians throughout Europe.

The Fountain of Bellerophon was executed in the 17th century by Cosimo Fanzago.

<text>Richard G. &quot;Dik&quot; Evans (born 1957) is a British-Irish musician. He is a co-founder and guitarist of the band Virgin Prunes, and a co-founder and early guitarist of the band that later became U2. He is the older brother of U2 guitarist the Edge.

==Early life==
Richard G. Evans was born in Barking in 1957, the son of Welsh parents. His younger brother David is a guitarist better known by his stage name The Edge. At a young age, the family moved to Ireland. Evans first began to learn how to play guitar with an acoustic guitar bought by his brother, which the two shared.

==Career==
The band that would eventually be named U2 formed in Dublin on 25 September 1976. Dik and his brother Dave were two of six people to respond to a note that Larry Mullen Jr. posted on the notice board at Mount Temple Comprehensive School in search of musicians for a new band. The group set up in Mullen&#x27;s kitchen, with the Evans brothers on guitar; at the first meeting, the duo shared a single home-made instrument between them. They soon whittled down the lineup to a five-piece and settled on the name &quot;Feedback&quot; because it was one of the few technical terms they knew. Most of their initial material consisted of cover songs, which the band admitted was not their forte. Some of the earliest influences on the band were emerging punk rock acts, such as the Jam, the Clash, Buzzcocks, and Sex Pistols. The popularity of punk rock convinced the group that musical proficiency was not a prerequisite to success.

In April 1977, Feedback played their first gig for a paying audience at St. Fintan&#x27;s High School. Shortly after, the band changed their name to &quot;The Hype&quot;. Dik, who was older than the other band members and by this time at college, was becoming the odd man out. The rest of the band was leaning towards the idea of a four-piece ensemble. In March 1978, the group changed their name to &quot;U2&quot;. That same month, U2, as a four-piece without Dik, won a talent contest in Limerick sponsored by Harp Lager and the &quot;Evening Press&quot;. The win was an important milestone and affirmation for the fledgling band. Within a few days, Dik was officially phased out of the band with a farewell concert at the Presbyterian Church Hall in Howth. During the show, which featured the group playing cover songs as the Hype, Dik ceremonially walked offstage. The remaining four band members returned later in the concert to play original material as U2.

Evans was later a founding member of Dublin-based band The Virgin Prunes and their guitarist from 1977 to 1984. He co-founded the band The Kid Sisters, later known as The Screech Owls, along with the American musician Deborah &quot;Debbie&quot; Schow.

Recent solo work includes contributions to &quot;Snakes &amp; Ladders – A Festival of New Irish Music&quot;, curated by composer and former Virgin Prunes&#x27; band member, Daniel Figgis.

<text>The &quot;Kidd&quot;-class destroyers were a series of four guided-missile destroyers (DDGs) based on the . In contrast to their predecessor&#x27;s focus on anti-submarine warfare, the &quot;Kidd&quot;s were designed as more advanced multipurpose ships with the addition of considerably enhanced anti-aircraft capabilities. Originally ordered for the former Imperial Iranian Navy, the contracts were canceled when the 1979 Iranian Revolution began, and the ships were completed for the United States Navy. They were decommissioned in 1999 and sold to Taiwan, where they have served in the Republic of China Navy as the &quot;Kee Lung&quot; class since 2005.

==History==
These destroyers were originally ordered by the last Shah of Iran for service in the Persian Gulf in an air defence role around 1973/74. The original order of six ships was tentatively assigned hull numbers DD 993–998 by the U.S. Navy but it was reduced to four ships after U.S. Congress declined to halt the original production run of 30 &quot;Spruance&quot; ships. Compared to the preceding &quot;Spruance&quot; class, they retained the former&#x27;s anti-submarine capabilities while adding two Tartar-D missile launchers for the Mark 26/Standard anti-aircraft missile system. In order to operate more effectively in the Middle East, they also had four air conditioning plants to the Spruances&#x27; three, additional dust separators on their gas turbines&#x27; air intakes, and increased water distillation capacity. The Shah was overthrown in the Iranian Revolution, prior to Iran accepting delivery of the ships, causing the United States Navy to integrate the vessels into its own fleet in 1981–82 as the &quot;Kidd&quot; class.

On 3 February 1979, the Iranian government canceled the second two ships in the class, signing a memorandum of understanding indicating that they were available for acquisition by the U.S. Navy. On 21 February. 1979, the Iranian Prime Minister notified the U.S. government that Iran intended to terminate the contract of the first two ships, officially cancelling delivery on 8 March 1979.

Each ship in the class was named after a U.S. Navy Admiral who had died in combat in the Pacific in World War II:
* was named after Rear Admiral Isaac C. Kidd, who died on the bridge of his flagship, , during the attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941.
* was named after Rear Admiral Daniel Callaghan, who was killed during a surface action at the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, 13 November 1942, aboard .
* was named after Rear Admiral Norman Scott, who was killed during the same surface action that killed Admiral Callaghan at the First Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, aboard .
* was named after Rear Admiral Theodore Chandler, who died on 7 January 1945, as a result of burns received from a kamikaze crashing into his flagship, , the previous day.

Because they were equipped with heavy-duty air conditioning and other features that made them suitable in hot climates, they tended to be used in the Middle East, specifically the Persian Gulf itself. During their service with the U.S. Navy from the 1980s to the late 1990s, the ships were popularly known as the &quot;Ayatollah&quot; class.

In 1988–90, the &quot;Kidd&quot;s received the &quot;New Threat Upgrade&quot;, which allowed cooperative engagement with Aegis cruisers, enabling the cruisers to control the &quot;Kidd&quot;s″ surface-to-air missiles in flight while the destroyers remained electronically silent. However, the arrival of the Aegis-equipped destroyers led to the accelerated retirement of the &quot;Kidd&quot; class.

All four ships were decommissioned from the U.S. Navy in the late 1990s and were initially offered for sale to Australia in 1997 for A$30 million each. The Royal Australian Navy was a strong supporter of buying the &quot;Kidd&quot;-class destroyers to replace the &quot;Perth&quot; class as their air warfare ships. In 1999, the offer was rejected, based on extensive problems the Royal Australian Navy had encountered during the acquisition of two surplus s from the U.S. Navy in 1994. In the early 1990s the Labor government of Paul Keating chose to maintain the Royal Australian Navy&#x27;s existing &quot;Adelaide&quot;-class frigates instead of replacing them with the more expensive and much more labour-intensive, but more capable &quot;Kidd&quot;-class destroyers. Under the succeeding Liberal government of John Howard, in the mid-1990s they commenced the SEA 1390, also known as the FFG Upgrade Project, to improve the &quot;Adelaide&quot; frigates&#x27; capabilities; however, this project ran over costs and was behind schedule.

After the Australian refusal, the four ships were offered to Greece, which also refused.

==Sale and reactivation==
In 2001, the U.S. authorized the reactivation and sale of all four ships to Taiwan (Republic of China). All four have been transferred to the Republic of China Navy under the Kuang Hua VII program. They were sold for a total price of US$732 million with upgraded hardware, overhaul, activation, and training, and included a reduced missile loadout of 148 SM-2 Block IIIA and 32 RGM-84L Block II Harpoon anti-ship missiles. The reactivation was done in Charleston, South Carolina, by VSE/BAV.

===&quot;Kee Lung&quot;-class destroyers===
The first two ships, ex-&quot;Scott&quot; and ex-&quot;Callaghan&quot;, arrived at Su-ao, a military port in eastern Taiwan, in December 2005, and were named and in a commissioning ceremony on 17 December 2005. Following the tradition of ship class naming, ROCN has referred to these vessels as Kee Lung-class destroyers, with the ships named after military ports in Taiwan. The remaining two units, ex-&quot;Kidd&quot; and ex-&quot;Chandler&quot;, were delivered in 2006, and named and , respectively.

The opposition-led Legislature Yuan originally allocated only enough money to purchase half of the SM-2 missiles that the destroyers can carry; a further purchase of 100 supplemental SM-2MRs was included in the 2007 annual budget to ensure all four ships had a full load of SM-2.

By end of 2008, &quot;Su Ao&quot; was spotted to have eight HF-3 AShMs installed in place of eight Harpoon AShMs. It has been speculated from 2014 on that a navalized Sky Bow missile system, currently planned for an upcoming shipbuilding programme that involves the procurement of up to 15 general purpose frigates and three or four air defense destroyers, will also be replacing the Standard Missile system on these vessels. No plan for any Mk 26-compatible version of the Sky Bow III missile is ever known to have existed.

<text>Danny Dunn is a fictional character, the protagonist of a series of American juvenile science fiction/adventure books written by Raymond Abrashkin and Jay Williams beginning in 1956.

==Background==
The stories are set in the fictional American town of Midston. The plots feature characters who are interested in science and mathematics.

Abrashkin died in 1960, after publication of the fifth book. Williams, however, insisted on Abrashkin being given co-author credit on the subsequent ten books as well, since he had been instrumental in constructing the series. Ezra Jack Keats illustrated the first four novels in the series.

Although the exact location of Midston is not given, the authors wrote that a famed American of colonial times visited the town (when it was known as Middestown), implying Midston is somewhere in the original 13 states. In the book &quot;Danny Dunn and the Heat Ray&quot;, reference is made to U.S. Route 1 and U.S. Route 2 being located near Midston, and those roads meet only at Houlton, Maine.

==Characters==
Dunn is a boy, a fifth-grader when the series starts, although the school year ends at the end of the first book. He is looking forward to a career in science. According to book reviewer Andrew Frederick, Dunn is precocious and headstrong — a redhead whose adventures mainly include getting into and out of trouble.

===Other characters===
*Professor Euclid Bullfinch, a researcher at [fictional] Midston University. The Professor is also a musician who plays the bass viol (also known colloquially as the &quot;bull fiddle&quot;). He is plump and somewhat bald, and smokes a pipe in some of the books. Danny considers him a mentor, and Danny&#x27;s complicated problems often revolve around inventions by Bullfinch.
*Mrs. Dunn, Danny&#x27;s widowed mother, housekeeper for Professor Bullfinch.
*Classmate Irene Miller, Danny&#x27;s friend and next-door neighbor. Irene&#x27;s father teaches astronomy at Midston University. Irene made her first appearance in the third book and is particularly interested in physics.
*Classmate Joe Pearson, Danny&#x27;s friend. Joe is the poet of the group, and he often functions as an amusing sidekick to Danny, expressing bafflement at the complicated technology employed by Danny and the Professor.
*Classmate Eddie (&quot;Snitcher&quot;) Phillips, rival of Danny and a school bully.
*Doctor A.J. Grimes, a friend of Professor Bullfinch introduced in the first book, &quot;Danny Dunn and the Anti-Gravity Paint&quot;. Grimes is a curmudgeonly figure, rarely taking the teenagers seriously, and often trying to antagonize the Professor. Doctor Grimes is also a musician who plays the piccolo; he and Professor Bullfinch occasionally play duets. Tall and lanky, he is in many ways a contrast to his friend Bullfinch.

==Reception==
Floyd C. Gale of &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot; said in 1961 that &quot;Danny&#x27;s adventures are always based on a solid science foundation, once the authors&#x27; usually wild main premise is digested&quot;.

<doc id="1023195" wikidata="Q7761235" url="?curid=1023195" title="The Rock-afire Explosion">
<text>The Rock-afire Explosion (RAE) is an animatronic character band designed and manufactured by Creative Engineering, Inc. (CEI) for use in ShowBiz Pizza Place restaurants in the 1980s and early 1990s. The band&#x27;s characters were various anthropomorphized animals, including a brown bear, a grey wolf and a silverback gorilla. They performed medleys of classic rock, pop, and country music, as well as original compositions and comedic skits.

CEI was founded by inventor Aaron Fechter, who oversaw production of the animatronics and provided several of the characters&#x27; voices. The band was replaced by Chuck E. Cheese characters and renamed Munch&#x27;s Make Believe Band following ShowBiz Pizza&#x27;s decision to rebrand in the early 1990s. As relations with ShowBiz deteriorated, CEI began selling The Rock-afire Explosion to other restaurants and entertainment centers around the world, including Circus Pizza, Pistol Pete&#x27;s Pizza, and Billy Bob&#x27;s Wonderland.

The show was considered pioneering in the animatronic industry, featuring life-sized characters that were capable of advanced movement and facial expression. At the end of the show&#x27;s tenure, former Chuck E. Cheese marketing director Jul Kamen credited Rock-afire with being largely responsible for ShowBiz’s early financial success.

==Production==

Production of the show&#x27;s programming and audio was done in-house by Creative Engineering, Inc. (CEI) in Orlando, Florida. Nearly all Rock-afire shows were produced completely in-house, with CEI employees writing and performing songs and comedic skits. When ShowBiz began assuming control over programming, they used Songcode, a system inherited from their acquisition of Chuck E. Cheese (CEC).

Unlike other animatronic shows of the early 1980s, The Rock-afire Explosion (RAE) was life-sized, with most of the performers about the size of an average adult human. Fechter also implemented latex masks for the characters&#x27; faces, as opposed to the rubber and Styrofoam masks common in other animatronics. The latex masks fit over movable parts on the characters&#x27; faces, permitting a range of facial expressions, including smiling and the raising of eyebrows. Fechter also implemented computer programming that permitted some of the characters to move in rhythm with music.

===Technical specifications===

The Rock-afire Explosion uses four recorded tracks, two for audio and two for data. The data tracks are encoded using Biphase mark code produced during a programming process involving two computers. The circuitry of the RAE was originally purchased by CEI from Superscope, the makers of Pianocorder.

In the years following the separation from CEI, there was a need to upgrade the aging Songcode inherited from CEC, which was used following CEI&#x27;s departure. As technology evolved and ShowBiz became more involved in programming, they switched to a new programming system called APS (Animation Programming System), designed by Dave Philipsen. Video playback capabilities were added with the implementation of a new controller, Cyberstar, designed by Bill Synhorst of Triad Productions. It allowed direct communication with existing driver boards, eliminating the need for the Pianocorder playback board.

===Band members===
* Billy Bob Brockali – Bass / Vocals. He&#x27;s a brown bear from Tennessee who wore yellow and red overalls and played a wooden bass. He was the mascot for ShowBiz Pizza Place throughout its existence, and his image was on most of the chain&#x27;s merchandise. Preceded by Billy Wilbur from the Hard Luck Bears and Bear Country Jubilee. Sweet and naive, Billy Bob was usually a mediator to the band&#x27;s minor on-stage squabbles. Voice: Aaron Fechter
* Looney Bird – Vocals. Looney Bird shares Billy Bob&#x27;s stage, as he is Billy Bob’s best friend. His head was the only thing ever seen, the rest of him hiding in an oil drum. Some shows featured a segment where Looney Bird would answer fan mail. For this, the robot was retrofitted to include a pair of hands that held a piece of paper for him to read. Looney Bird was originally portrayed as having the personality of an alcoholic and frequently huffed gas to calm himself down. In the mid 1980s, his personality underwent a drastic change and he would be portrayed as an inventor and scientific genius. Preceded by Gooney Bird from the Hard Luck Bears and Bear Country Jubilee. Voice: Aaron Fechter
* Dook LaRue – Drums / Vocals. He is a mongrel with a smooth singing voice who aspired space travel and wore a space themed suit. Slightly dimwitted, Dook would often lose focus during shows and miss his cues. Preceded by Dingo Starr from the Wolf Pack Five. Voice: Duke Chauppetta (1980–1997, 2016–present)
* Fatz Geronimo – Keyboards / Vocals. He is a silverback gorilla. He is a parody of real-life entertainers Fats Domino and Ray Charles. Unofficial band front man, Fatz had a tendency to ramble. He introduced the most shows and ordered other band members around, leading him and Rolfe DeWolfe into many arguments. Preceded by Fats from the Wolf Pack Five. Voice: Burt Wilson (1980–2006, 2020-2023), Aaron Fechter (2006–2020), Shooter Jennings (2024-present)
* Beach Bear – Guitar / Vocals. He is a polar bear with a laid back attitude and a smooth singing voice who was a surfer. He originally had a crazy personality. He is wise and somewhat sarcastic. Beach Bear was carried over from the Wolf Pack Five. Voice: Aaron Fechter (1980–1982), Rick Bailey (1982–present)
* Mitzi Mozzarella – Vocals. She is a mouse and a cheerleader. A typical teenager, Mitzi was considered &quot;loose&quot; by the rest of the Rock-afire Explosion, and was obsessed with gossip, boyfriends, pop music, and Michael Jackson. Preceded by Queenie Fox and Mini Mozzarella from the Wolf Pack Five. Voice: Aaron Fechter (1980–1982), Monique Danielle (1982), Shalisa James (1982–present)
* Rolfe DeWolfe and Earl Schmerle – A ventriloquist/comedy act. Nominally a stand-up comedy act performed in between musical sets; Rolfe is a wolf, and Earl is his sentient ventriloquist puppet. Rolfe is portrayed as sarcastic, egocentric, and abrasive, with a tendency to be incredibly rude to both the band and the employees that work at Showbiz. He has a fondness for disco music, Kmart, and the works of Frank Sinatra. Earl was there to &quot;set him straight&quot; by calling his behaviors out, and by turning Rolfe into a joke. Rolfe was preceded by the Wolfman from the Wolf Pack Five, while Earl is an original character. Voice: Aaron Fechter (for both Rolfe and Earl)

The show also consists of several smaller prop characters, many of which did not have speaking roles. These included an animated Sun and Moon that provided background vocals from time to time, a birthday spider called Antioch who spoke in gibberish, and a bear cub known as Choo-Choo, who hid in a small tree stump in front of Dook&#x27;s drums and danced to the band&#x27;s music. One of the more notable prop characters was Birthday Bird, who was perched on the neck of Billy Bob&#x27;s guitar. Additionally, thirty stores were outfitted with &quot;Uncle Klunk&quot; (voice: Jeff Howell), a human character who replaced Rolfe and hosted talk-show segments with his bird sidekick, Click. The Klunk animatronics also served to be retrofitted into Santa Claus shows during the holidays.

==Later years at ShowBiz and Concept Unification==
ShowBiz Pizza Place was similar to (and competed with) Chuck E. Cheese&#x27;s Pizza Time Theatre, another animatronic restaurant chain that was popular in the United States. In the mid-1980s, both venues began to suffer financial difficulties, partially due to the video game crash of 1983 and also due to both companies having opened more restaurants than they could afford to maintain. When Pizza Time Theatre filed for bankruptcy in 1984, ShowBiz bought the company, hoping that new talent and merchandising opportunities could save both companies.

By 1985, Richard M. Frank had joined the company as CEO and chairman. The corporation maintained the two restaurant chains simultaneously for several years. Each continued its own stage shows and sold different merchandise. However, in the latter part of the decade, relations between Creative Engineering and ShowBiz began to sour. Aaron Fechter, the founder of Creative Engineering and creator of the Rock-afire Explosion, claimed that the fallout between his company and ShowBiz arose when ShowBiz asked him to sign away the licensing and copyrights to the Rock-afire Explosion, which would have allowed ShowBiz to cut production costs on the show, such as manufacture of future shows and royalty payments to Creative Engineering. Fechter refused, on the grounds that ShowBiz offered no monetary compensation for the rights.

ShowBiz began toying with the idea of adding licensed characters such as Spider-Man or Garfield to the Rock-afire show, and three ShowBiz locations actually replaced Billy Bob and Looney Bird with Yogi Bear and Boo Boo animatronics in 1987. Ideas to retrofit the Rock-afire into completely original characters were also proposed at the time by Creative Presentations Inc, a now-defunct animatronic company based in Schaumburg, Illinois, that already provided ShowBiz with new showtapes and replacement cosmetics for Rock-afire shows.

An experiment of Paul Linden and Dave Philipsen using JVC BR-7000 VHS Hi-Fi tape decks which integrated two stereo audio tracks, two longitudinal data tracks, and video led to a system in 1988 where television screens were installed above the Rock-afire stage as the company introduced their new Cyberstar TV screen system. During showtime, the characters were finally shown performing in video, as reel-to-reel formatted tapes began to be used less often. A reel-to-reel version of Cyberstar called &quot;Cybervision&quot; was tested at two restaurants in Austin, TX; Cybervision can be distinguished from Cyberstar by the fact that they only feature the animatronics, and no graphics or walkaround characters. Cyberstar was also implemented at Pizza Time Theatre, and remains in use at all Chuck E. Cheese&#x27;s locations, albeit using DVDs rather than VHS tapes.

The changes to the Rock-afire stage were very minor, as the company later decided to enact a process called &quot;Concept Unification,&quot; in which all ShowBiz Pizza locations would be remodeled into Chuck E. Cheese&#x27;s. The remodel included the elimination of all Rock-afire characters from merchandise and advertising, and retrofitting/reprogramming the Rock-afire Explosion animatronics into a show called Munch&#x27;s Make Believe Band, featuring the Chuck E. Cheese&#x27;s Pizza Time Theatre characters. Dook was moved to Billy Bob&#x27;s place and became Pasqually P. Pieplate, Looney Bird became Pizzacam, Beach Bear became Jasper T. Jowls, Fatz became Mr. Munch, Mitzi was moved to Dook&#x27;s place and became Helen Henny, The Sun became The Building, Choo-Choo became Munch Junior, and Rolfe became Chuck E. Cheese; The Moon was the only character carried over unchanged, and Antioch&#x27;s computer and air lines were reused for The Wink, an animated Chuck E. Cheese head over the stage that would wink at the end of each segment. Unused animatronics (which included Billy Bob, Earl, and Antioch) and props were either sold off, used for parts or destroyed.

After ties between Creative Engineering and ShowBiz were completely severed, &quot;Concept Unification&quot; was announced in November 1989 and locations were gradually converted throughout the early 1990s. As Concept Unification began at each location, the right and center stages of the Rock-afire show were shut down, leaving only the Rolfe and Earl characters operational. The two performed &quot;The Rolfe and Earle Show&quot; (Earl&#x27;s name was unintentionally misspelled), featuring the voices of Showbiz employees imitating Fechter&#x27;s voice; the two ran a highlight reel of old Rock-afire Cyberstar segments and wondered aloud what the band would do now, and hinted at the coming Chuck E. Cheese-themed show. &quot;The Rolfe and Earle Show&quot; was the final Rock-afire show produced for Showbiz.

==Later years==
As troubles began between CEI and Showbiz, the RAE was marketed to other restaurants and amusement parks around the world. In the 1990s, an update to the band, known as &quot;The New Rock-afire Explosion&quot;, was created, using new, smaller animatronics known as &quot;mijjins&quot;, as well as other features such as revolving stages and dance choreography. However, relatively few customers purchased the show.

Odyssey Fun World, an indoor amusement park located in Naperville, Illinois, and Tinley Park, Illinois, operated the New Rock-afire show in its restaurants.

Fechter terminated all of his employees over several years, with the last 3 being terminated in 2003. In the mid 2000s, spurred by the growing online Rock-afire fan community, Fechter reunited some of the Rock-afire performers and began to program shows set to fan-requested songs. Videos of the performances—posted to his YouTube upon completion—are credited with helping to further revive interest in the group and ShowBiz Pizza, and spurred individuals who owned their own Rock-afire bands to begin programming new shows themselves.

===Independent shows in the United States===
Aaron Fechter maintains his own Rock-afire show, which has been used to program new shows and perform for private guests. As of 2023, the show is temporarily defunct as Fechter is in the process of moving his collection to Palatka, Florida.

Smitty&#x27;s Super Service Station has a fully functional show in Sandy Hook, Mississippi.

The Rock-afire Explosion show at Billy Bob&#x27;s Wonderland in Barboursville, West Virginia, remains operational and was restored in 2021 after decades of disrepair.

David Ferguson of Pendleton, Indiana, has a Rock-afire installed in his barn, dubbed &quot;Goofy Gas Fillin&#x27; Station&quot;.

John Zerwas purchased a Rock-afire Explosion from Chimpy&#x27;s Pizza Safari, a restaurant, in 2005. His show is installed in his home in Minnesota.

A private collector from Missouri named Mike has every Rock-afire animatronic, but no stage, running in his basement.

Jack Turner, a close associate of Aaron Fechter and collector, has a fully operational Rock-afire show in his St. Joseph, Missouri warehouse.

Although the Volo Auto Museum received a Rock-afire Explosion show slated for installation in 2020, there were licensing issues with Aaron Fechter preventing operation. However, as of 2024, Volo Museum and Fechter came to an agreement and the show is now fully operational.

The Rock-afire Explosion performed at Rock-afire, an arcade bar in Kansas City, Missouri. However, the bar closed in February 2019.

===Independent public shows internationally===
The Dreamfactory &amp; World of Wonders in Degersheim, Switzerland has had a show since 1987, however it only became operational in 2021. This fully functional, newly restored show features a turntable that swaps between Rolfe&#x27;s stage and Uncle Klunk. It can be visited during the museum&#x27;s opening hours.
Wolmi Theme Park in Incheon, South Korea has a Rock-afire show in a restaurant in the park, playing four songs custom-made for the park by Aaron Fechter. 

The Hard Luck Bears Jamboree is a retrofitted Rock-afire Explosion show located in the Gulliver&#x27;s World, Gulliver&#x27;s Land, and Gulliver&#x27;s Kingdom theme parks. All characters with the exception of Looney Bird and Earl are bears, but retain their original names. The show has been criticized for its programming, voice acting, and poor condition as a result of Gulliver&#x27;s standards. As of 2023, however, the shows are being restored and programmed to original Rock-afire showtapes.

==Documentary==
&quot;The Rock-afire Explosion&quot;, a documentary about Chris Thrash, Aaron Fechter and the remaining Rock-afire Explosion fan base, was released at film festivals and special screenings around the United States in the fall of 2008. It was released on DVD in 2009. In 2011, it was released on iTunes.

== In popular culture ==
Billy Bob Brockali is referenced in the song &quot;Good Friday&quot; by the American band Why?, with the lyric, &quot;My fear of the bear at ShowBiz Pizza when I was six was overwhelming and not dissimilar to this&quot;.

<text>Patrick Michael Clancy (7 March 1922 – 11 November 1998), usually called Paddy Clancy or Pat Clancy, was an Irish folk singer best known as a member of the Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem. In addition to singing and storytelling, Clancy played the harmonica with the group, which is widely credited with popularizing Irish traditional music in the United States and revitalizing it in Ireland. He also started and ran the folk music label Tradition Records, which recorded many of the key figures of the American folk music revival.

==Early years==

Clancy was one of eleven children and the eldest of four boys born to Johanna McGrath and Bob Clancy in Carrick-on-Suir, County Tipperary. During World War II he served as a flight engineer in the Royal Air Force in India; he also reportedly had been a member of the Irish Republican Army. After his demobilization, Clancy worked as a baker in London. In 1947 he emigrated to Toronto, Canada with his brother Tom Clancy. The following year, the two brothers moved to Cleveland, Ohio to stay with relatives. Later, they attempted to move to California, but their car broke down and they relocated to the New York City area instead.

==Greenwich Village and Tradition Records==
After moving to Greenwich Village in 1951, both Paddy and Tom Clancy devoted themselves primarily to careers in the theater. In addition to appearing in various Off-Broadway productions and television shows, they produced and starred in plays at the Cherry Lane Theatre in Greenwich Village and at a playhouse in Martha&#x27;s Vineyard. Their productions included an 18-week run of Seán O&#x27;Casey&#x27;s &quot;The Plough and the Stars&quot;.

After losing money on some unsuccessful plays, the brothers began singing concerts of folk songs after their evening acting jobs were over. They soon dubbed these concerts &quot;Midnight Specials&quot; and the &quot;Swapping Song Fair.&quot; Paddy and Tom were often joined by other prominent folk singers of the day, including Pete Seeger, Woody Guthrie, and Jean Ritchie.

In 1956 their younger brother Liam Clancy immigrated to New York, where he teamed up with Tommy Makem, whom he had met while collecting folk songs in Ireland. The two began singing together at Gerde&#x27;s Folk City, a club in Greenwich Village. Paddy and Tom Clancy sang with them on occasion, usually in informal folk &#x27;sing-songs&#x27; in the Village. Around the same time, Paddy founded Tradition Records with folk-song collector and heiress Diane Hamilton, and in 1956 the Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem released their first album, &quot;The Rising of the Moon&quot;, with only Paddy&#x27;s harmonica as musical accompaniment.

However, the Clancys and Makem did not become a permanent singing group until 1959. In the meanwhile, Paddy Clancy signed and recorded established folk artists for Tradition Records, including Alan Lomax, Ewan MacColl, Paul Clayton, Ed McCurdy, Oscar Brand, and Jean Ritchie. Tradition also produced Odetta&#x27;s first solo LP, &quot;Odetta Sings Ballads and Blues&quot;, which Bob Dylan (a friend of the Clancys) later cited as his inspiration to become a folk singer. Carolyn Hester&#x27;s self-titled album with Tradition led to her first public recognition and her signing with Columbia Records.

In addition to planning what the label would record, Clancy edited many of the ensuing albums himself. While still president of Tradition Records, he went as a cameraman on an expedition to Venezuela in search of alluvial diamonds, ostensibly as part of a documentary crew.

==Clancy Brothers==

In the late 1950s, Clancy with his brothers and Makem began to take singing more seriously as a permanent career, and soon they recorded their second album, &quot;Come Fill Your Glass with Us&quot;. This album proved to be more successful than their debut album, and they began receiving job offers as singers at important nightclubs, including the Gate of Horn in Chicago and the Blue Angel in New York City. The group garnered nationwide fame in the United States after an appearance on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, which led to a contract with Columbia Records in 1961.

Over the course of the 1960s, the Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem recorded approximately two albums a year for Columbia. By 1964, &quot;Billboard Magazine&quot; reported that the group was outselling Elvis Presley in Ireland. Two of their albums, &quot;In Person at Carnegie Hall&quot; and &quot;The First Hurrah!&quot;, were also hits in the United States.

Paddy Clancy considered &quot;In Person at Carnegie Hall&quot; to be their best record.

The group performed together on stage, recordings, and television to great acclaim in the United States, Ireland, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia until Tommy Makem left to pursue a solo career in 1969. They continued performing first with Bobby Clancy and then with Louis Killen until Liam left in 1976 also to pursue a solo career. In 1977 after a short hiatus, the group reformed with Paddy, Tom, and Bobby Clancy and their nephew Robbie O&#x27;Connell. Liam returned in 1990 after the death of Tom Clancy.

In a 2008 documentary, &quot;The Yellow Bittern&quot;, Liam Clancy recalled Paddy as the &quot;alpha male&quot; of the group, who &quot;quietly laid down the law&quot; that his younger brothers and Makem followed &quot;without questioning his authority.&quot; On another occasion, Liam noted about Paddy: &quot;Being the eldest brother he was always the leader of the pack. His word was kind of gospel.&quot;

Paddy often acted as the spokesman for the Clancys, and he frequently included funny stories and jokes in his concerts. His signature song was the classic Irish drinking song, &quot;A Jug of Punch.&quot; He was also well known for his renditions of &quot;Mountain Dew,&quot; &quot;Rosin the Bow,&quot; &quot;The Foggy Dew,&quot; the humorous songs, &quot;The Old Woman from Wexford&quot; and &quot;Mr. Moses Ri-Tooral-I-Ay,&quot; the Scottish song, &quot;Johnny Lad&quot;, and several others.

==Return to Ireland and death==
After two decades in North America, in 1968 Clancy returned to live in Carrick-on-Suir, where he had bought a dairy farm and bred exotic cattle. When not on tour or working on his farm, he spent much of his time fishing, reading, and doing crossword puzzles.

In the late 1990s, he was diagnosed with a brain tumor. The tumor was successfully removed, but he was also stricken with terminal lung cancer around the same time. He continued performing until his failing health prevented him from doing so any longer.

Patrick Clancy died at home of lung cancer on 11 November 1998 at the age of 76. He was buried, wearing his trademark white cap, in the tiny village of Faugheen, near Carrick-on-Suir. He was survived by his widow, Mary Clancy (née Flannery), and their four children, Rory, Orla, Maura, and Conor. He was also survived by a daughter from his first marriage, Leish Clancy, and four siblings, Liam, Bobby, Peg, and Joan.

After his death, folklorist and broadcaster Ciarán Mac Mathúna identified him as the &quot;strong man&quot; of the Clancy Brothers, while Irish folk musician Mick Moloney asserted that he had been &quot;a powerful figure in a group of strong willed men...Paddy&#x27;s leadership quality always shone out when the Clancys performed.&quot; Moloney also noted what he saw as Clancy&#x27;s legacy: &quot;Irish music would not enjoy the success it has today if he had not made Irish music his career and paved the way for all of us.&quot;

<text>The Monon Railroad , also known as the Chicago, Indianapolis, and Louisville Railway from 1897 to 1971, was an American railroad that operated almost entirely within the state of Indiana. The Monon was merged into the Louisville and Nashville Railroad in 1971, and much of the former Monon right of way is owned today by CSX Transportation. In 1970, it operated of road on of track; that year it reported 1320 million ton-miles of revenue freight and zero passenger-miles. (It also showed zero miles of double track, the longest such Class I railroad in the country.)

*1847: The New Albany and Salem Railroad (NA&amp;S) is organized with James Brooks as president.
*1854: The NA&amp;S trackage stretches from the Ohio River (at New Albany) to Lake Michigan (at Michigan City).
*1859: The overextended and struggling NA&amp;S is renamed the Louisville, New Albany and Chicago Railroad (LNA&amp;C).
*April 30, 1865: The LNA&amp;C becomes one of twenty railroads to haul Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s funeral train, its portion being from Lafayette to Michigan City, Indiana.
*1873: The LNA&amp;C Railroad is reorganized as the Louisville, New Albany and Chicago Railway.
*1881: The LNA&amp;C consolidates with the Chicago and Indianapolis Air Line Railway, and the trackage of the new division is soon extended to reach into its namesake cities.
*July 1, 1897: The LNA&amp;C is reorganized as the Chicago, Indianapolis, and Louisville Railway.
*1932: The 300 pound (136 kg) Monon Bell is first presented as the trophy of the annual football game between DePauw University and Wabash College.
*1946: John W. Barriger III becomes president of the Monon, bringing aggressive plans for modernization.
*June 29, 1949: Final day of steam locomotive service, as the Monon becomes one of the first Class I railroads to fully convert to diesel motive power.
*January 11, 1956: The CI&amp;L officially adopts its longtime nickname, Monon, as its corporate title.
*1959: The Monon&#x27;s passenger service between Chicago and Indianapolis is discontinued. By 1965, only the &quot;Thoroughbred&quot; remained, with its single daily roundtrip from Chicago to Louisville.
*September 30, 1967: Final day of regularly scheduled passenger train service on the Monon.
*March 21, 1968: Merger with Louisville and Nashville Railroad announced to placate the Monon&#x27;s fear of lost business due to L&amp;N&#x27;s acquisition of a competing route, the Chicago and Eastern Illinois Railroad.
*July 31, 1971: The Monon is merged into the Louisville and Nashville Railroad.
*1972-1979: Amtrak operates the &quot;Floridian&quot; Chicago-Miami service over the former Monon Railroad&#x27;s tracks in Indiana. With the termination of this service in 1979, Bloomington, Indiana, and the rest of southern Indiana lose passenger railway service.
*1999: Portions of the line around Indianapolis are converted to a bicycle and pedestrian trail known as the Monon Trail.
*2004: CSX Transportation stops using the former Monon Railroad&#x27;s tracks through Bloomington, Indiana. Over the next decade, Bloomington sections of the tracks are converted to the B-Line Trail (within the city proper) and the Rail-Trail (south of the city).
*After 2009, the tracks between Munster and Hammond, Indiana, are removed and the line converted into another section of the Monon Trail.

==Colleges served==
The Monon served seven colleges and universities along its line:
*Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana
*Wabash College in Crawfordsville, Indiana
*DePauw University in Greencastle, Indiana
*Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana
*Butler University in Indianapolis, Indiana
*St. Joseph&#x27;s College in Rensselaer, Indiana
*West Baden Northwood Institute/College in West Baden Springs, Indiana.

The university traffic was important enough to the Monon that the railroad used the schools&#x27; colors on its rolling stock. The red and white of Wabash College (and similar to the colors of Indiana University) was used on the railroad&#x27;s passenger equipment, and the black and gold used by both DePauw University and Purdue University adorned the railroad&#x27;s diesel freight locomotives and later replaced the red and white on passenger equipment as well.

==Monon route==
The railroad got the name &quot;Monon&quot; from the convergence of its main routes in Monon, Indiana. From Monon, the mainlines reached out to Chicago, Louisville, Indianapolis, and Michigan City, Indiana. In Chicago the Monon&#x27;s passenger trains served Dearborn Station. Branches connected the Louisville mainline to Victoria and French Lick in Indiana.

The Monon&#x27;s main line ran down the middle of streets in several cities, notably Lafayette, New Albany, and Bedford. It also installed an unusual &quot;home grown&quot; warning signal at many grade crossings; these used a green signal light (similar to and adapted from a standard highway traffic signal) that stayed lit at all times, except when a train was approaching. A sign below or to the side of the signal read, &quot;STOP When Signal Is Out&quot; or &quot;DANGER when light is out cross at your own risk&quot;. This design was fail-safe, in that when the signal bulb was burned out, approaching vehicle drivers would assume a train was coming — until they eventually realized there was no train and just a burned-out signal.

The Monon had seven sections. Beginning in the north, Section One was from the Indiana line to Lafayette, passing through the Monon switch in Monon. As a primary passenger route, it connected to Section Four running between Lafayette and Bloomington. This route reached the Ohio River over Section Five from Bloomington to New Albany. From this southern route, Sections Six and Seven were spurs to the west. Section Six served the coal fields between Midland and Clay City, connecting to the main line at Wallace Junction, just south of Cloverdale. Section Seven provided passenger service to the resort hotels in West Baden and French Lick, through a connection at Orleans.

The other primary line, mainly a freight line, included Section Two from Michigan City on Lake Michigan to Monon and then Section three from Monon to Indianapolis. Although each route had its primary traffic type, freight and passengers were carried over all parts of the line.

===Section #2===

Monon to Indianapolis. Section #2 was a freight route between Monon and Indianapolis. The section of the line between Monon and Monticello is still in service and owned and operated by the Elkhart &amp; Western Railroad, a Pioneer Railcorp subsidiary. The rest has been completely abandoned and the rails removed. Much of the right-of-way has been returned to neighboring landowners. Where farm fields surround it, evidence of the route has nearly been obliterated as the land has been returned to farming. From 10th Street in Indianapolis, through Carmel and up to State Road 47 in Sheridan, the Monon Trail is now a bike and walking route following the right-of-way.

==The line today==

The remains of the line are operated by CSX Transportation. Large segments have been abandoned in recent years: most of the line from Monon southeast to Indianapolis, the line north from Monon to Michigan City, and the line segment between Cloverdale and Bedford (this segment was abandoned due largely to a washout). A portion of the French Lick branch is now home to a railroad museum.

Between Bedford and Mitchell, CSX owned the line but did not operate any of its own trains. Until 2009, the only service came from trains of the Indiana Rail Road, which in 2006 purchased the former Latta Subdivision of the Canadian Pacific Railway that connected with the former Monon at Bedford. INRD operated over the old Monon from Bedford to Louisville through trackage rights negotiated by the Latta Sub&#x27;s original owner, The Milwaukee Road, when the L&amp;N took over the Monon. Those trackage rights went from the Milwaukee Road to its buyer, The Soo Line Railroad; a subsidiary of the Canadian Pacific Railway. In 2009, INRD ended service and removed trackage from the former Monon junction in Bedford to the Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane Division west of Bedford. Consequently, CSX placed the ex-Monon line from Bedford south to Mitchell out of service.

CSX operated trains between Louisville and St. Louis, Missouri, over the Louisville-Mitchell segment; these trains had to make an unusual reverse movement to go from the Monon to the former Baltimore and Ohio Railroad line to St. Louis, owing to an unfavorable track arrangement at the crossing of the lines in Mitchell. As of 2009, CSX has stopped making regular movements over the line, with trains being shifted to the nearby Louisville and Indiana Railroad via a trackage rights agreement.
Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Cardinal&quot; train traverses the former Monon thrice weekly from Crawfordsville to the Indiana state line near Chicago. Station stops along the former Monon include Lafayette, Rensselaer, and Dyer.

The line through Lafayette was relocated in 2000 to an alignment along the Wabash River, parallel to the similarly relocated Norfolk Southern Railway line. Previously, the Monon Line ran down the middle of Fifth Street, with a hotel serving as its passenger station well into the Amtrak era.

The Monon Line has been abandoned in Hammond and Munster north of the junction with the Grand Trunk Western Railroad, but the corridor is planned to be rebuilt as the Northern Indiana Commuter Transportation District West Lake Corridor. Initially running as far south as Munster/Dyer Main Street, long-term plans would see services extend as far as Lowell and Valparaiso, Indiana.

==Museums==

The Indiana Railway Museum in French Lick operates trains south from French Lick to Cuzco, Indiana, out of the former Monon (Union) depot in French Lick, Indiana.

The Monon Connection, which opened in 2005. is on U.S. 421 north of Monon.
Located in a disused Monon railroad station, the Linden Railroad Museum is owned and operated by the Linden-Madison Township Historical Society. In 1852, the Michigan City, Salem and New Albany Railroad cut through Montgomery County. The old stage road between Crawfordsville and Linden was given to the railroad as an inducement to get it to build through Linden. 1852 also saw the building of the first Linden depot, on a site behind the present day post office. The building was moved to the current location in 1881 when the Toledo, St. Louis and Western Railroad was built through Linden, crossing the Monon at this location.

The John Hay Center in Salem has the Depot Railroad Station Museum, honoring the Monon. It has also been the home of the Monon Railroad Historical/Technical Society since summer 2012.

The Kentucky Railway Museum in New Haven, Kentucky, displays Monon&#x27;s Diesel Engine No. 32, an Electro-Motive Division (EMD) BL2 model, in its original black and gold paint scheme.

The French Lick West Baden Museum in French Lick acquired a major Monon Railroad Artifact collection in 2021 that is on display from November 2022 through mid-2023.

<text>Herol Graham (born 13 September 1959) is a British former professional boxer who competed from 1978 to 1998. A three-time world title challenger, he is generally acknowledged as one of the best British boxers of the post-war era to have never won a world championship. He beat Champions Lindell Holmes, Ayub Kalule and Vinny Pazienza.

==Amateur career==
===Highlights===
1976 Junior World Welterweight Champion (beat John Mugabi in final)

1977 Senior ABA Light-Middleweight finalist (lost to Steve Hopkin)

1978 Senior ABA Middleweight Champion

==Professional career==
In 1978, after winning the ABA middleweight title, Graham turned professional, fighting out of Brendan Ingle&#x27;s gym in the Wincobank area of Sheffield.

Graham went undefeated in his first 38 fights, winning the British, Commonwealth and European light-middleweight titles, as well as the British and European middleweight titles. He eventually lost his unbeaten record defending his European middleweight title against future world champion Sumbu Kalambay in 1987. Graham would go on to fight for world titles twice at middleweight and once at super middleweight. In his first attempt, challenging for the vacant WBA middleweight title, he took Mike McCallum to a close split decision; points deducted for a punch to the back of McCallum&#x27;s head 
ended up costing Graham the verdict. A year later, in another world title challenge, he lost to Julian Jackson for the vacant WBC middleweight title. After outclassing Jackson for nearly 4 rounds, Graham was knocked out cold before he hit the canvas by the now-famous devastating right cross known as the &#x27;Punch of the Century&#x27;.

Four years of inactivity were followed by an unexpected comeback in which Graham put together a series of victories to gain a last shot at a world title in March 1998. Challenging Charles Brewer for his IBF super middleweight title, Graham was stopped in the tenth round. Following this he retired from the ring and now lives in London, working as a personal trainer and specialising in boxing-based exercises.

In February 2009, Graham&#x27;s son was injured in what police described as a &quot;targeted shooting&quot; at Westfield, Sheffield.

Graham released his autobiography entitled &quot;Bomber: Behind the Laughter&quot; in 2011.

Graham has ongoing mental health issues from boxing injuries.

==Personal life==
Graham&#x27;s parents are Jamaican.

<text>Afognak (; also Agw&#x27;aneq in Alutiiq was an Alutiiq village on the island of Afognak in Kodiak Island Borough, Alaska, United States. It was located on Afognak Bay on the southwest coast of the island, three miles north of Kodiak Island. The site is now within the CDP of Aleneva.

== History ==

=== Prehistory ===
For more than 7,500 years, the Alutiiq people lived in hundreds of settlements in the Kodiak Archipelago. Like most other early native Alaskan peoples, the people of Afognak fished and hunted sea mammals from kayaks covered in seal skin. Men and women performed different tasks for the village. The people of Afognak traded services and goods with other settlements in Southeast Alaska and the Aleutian chain.

=== The Russian settlement period ===
The Russian American Company arrived on the island in 1784. The Russians invited and took several men from the village to hunt sea otters for sale in Europe. However, many people died as a result of mistreatment, and the smallpox epidemic of 1837–1840 killed many others in the archipelago. The Alutiiq began to change their lifestyle and governance. The name &quot;Afognak&quot; was derived from Afognak Island and was first reported in 1839 by Russian Sub-Lt. Mikhail Murashev. The natives and Russians on the island continued to fish, hunt, and gather food. Despite tensions between the two groups, many Russians and natives married and started families, and many natives learned Russian and converted to Russian Orthodoxy. The Alutiiq tradition was not abandoned, however, and was just added to. Many Russian workers who had married into the native community settled into the Russian American Company retirement communities upon their retirement. Eventually, the community of Russian Town, located next to Aleut Town, grew into the Afognak village, and the two merged.

=== The American period ===
The U.S. bought the occupation rights in 1867. Schools that only taught in English were established in regions where no one spoke the language, but by 1900, much of the younger community was trilingual, speaking Alutiiq, Russian, and English. In the late 1800s, the U.S. fishing business began to flourish. The business opened many canneries in Kodiak, Alaska, and fishermen from Scandinavia traveled to Alaska. The business in the area raised tension with the Alutiiq, who wanted to keep their fishing lifestyle. A post office was maintained intermittently from 1888 to 1964.

Afognak was covered by one meter (3 ft) of ash when Mount Katmai erupted in 1912. The 1964 Good Friday earthquake generated a tsunami which destroyed the village. With help from the Lions Club and the federal government, a new community was constructed on the northeast coast of Kodiak Island, called Port Lions in honor of the Lions Club who helped relocate the village. The former residents of Afognak moved permanently in December 1964, though 11 residents were still residing there as late as 1980.

==Demographics==
Afognak first appeared on the 1880 U.S. Census as an unincorporated village of 339 residents with a &quot;Creole&quot; (mixed Russian and native) majority of 195 and 144 Inuit minority. In 1890, the population also included Little Afognak, Cattanee and two Canneries. It continued to report until the 1960 census. With the 1964 Good Friday earthquake, most of the population departed. It did not appear on the 1970 census, but did in 1980 as an Alaskan Native Village designation. It has not reported separately since, but as of 2000, the original area that included Afognak is now mostly within the CDP of Aleneva.

==Geography==
Afognak was located on the southwestern shore of Afognak Island in Kodiak Island Borough, Alaska, United States. It is located three miles north of Kodiak Island.

<text>Langenfeld (Ripuarian: &quot;Langefääl&quot;) is a town in North Rhine-Westphalia (Germany) in the district of Mettmann. The suburban city is located between Düsseldorf and Cologne. Langenfeld was formed from the two localities of Richrath and Reusrath and received city rights in 1948.

==Economics==

Langenfeld has no public debt as of 3 October 2008. The debt clock installed at the town hall in 1997, showing the current debts of Langenfeld, the Rhineland, and the national debt, got demounted end of 2008 and handed over to Grevenbroich. In Langenfeld it had served its purpose, so the comment by former mayor Magnus Staehler. The town was honored for that with the prize &quot;Kommune des Jahres 2007&quot; (&quot;Municipality of the Year 2007&quot;) in the national contest &quot;Großer Preis des Mittelstandes&quot; (&quot;Grand Prize by Small Firms and Traders&quot;) of the Oskar-Patzelt-Siftung. To achieve that goal, on the one hand taxes got raised and in addition cuts of subsidies to clubs applied, so that debts halved from 1997 up to 2002. Being free of debt, and with that regaining free hand, was celebrated with a big party for the citizens at the first weekend in October under the slogan &quot;Golden Times&quot;. Up to 2013 the savings from that surpluses had strongly diminished again by the budget deficits of the following years.

===Transport===

Langenfeld is accessed by nearby highways A 3, A 59 and A 542, as well as the &quot;Bundesstrasse&quot; (federal route) B8. The mainline railway from Düsseldorf to Cologne runs through the town&#x27;s area as well. Public transport is provided by the S-Bahn line S6 and various bus lines operating under the umbrella of the VRR.

The nearest airports are Düsseldorf Airport (approx. 28 km) and Cologne Bonn Airport (approx. 35 km).

==Twin towns – sister cities==

Langenfeld is twinned with:
* Ennis, Ireland
* Gostynin, Poland
* Montale, Italy
* Senlis, France

==Notable people==
*Hans Anhalt, (1908 – 1975), Auschwitz guard and convicted war criminal
*Herbert Reul (born 1952), politician (CDU)
*Christian Menzel (born 1971), racing driver
*Cora Schumacher (born 1976), actress, model, racing driver and television presenter

<text>Gordon Rick Dwyer (born January 25, 1978) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey left winger who played five seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Tampa Bay Lightning, New York Rangers and Montreal Canadiens. He currently serves as the head coach and general manager of the Acadie–Bathurst Titan for the Quebec Maritimes Junior Hockey League (QMJHL).

==Playing career==
As a youth, Dwyer played in the 1992 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a minor ice hockey team from Drummondville. He attended Philemon Wright High School in Hull, Quebec, while playing for the Hull Olympiques of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL). He has also played for the Laval Titan, Beauport Harfangs, Drummondville Voltigeurs, and the Quebec Remparts in the QMJHL.

Dwyer was drafted by the St. Louis Blues in the 3rd round, 67th overall, of the 1996 NHL Entry Draft. Unable to reach a contract agreement with St. Louis, Dwyer re-entered the draft in 1998 and was selected by the Montreal Canadiens in the 6th round, 152nd overall.

While a member of the Tampa Bay Lightning, Dwyer achieved notoriety by receiving a 23-game suspension for leaving the penalty box to engage in a brawl, during which he verbally and physically abused officials, in a pre-season game against the Washington Capitals on September 19, 2000. The suspension stands as one of the longest in NHL history.

In 2004, he signed as a free agent by the Carolina Hurricanes but never played for them. He played for the Lowell Lock Monsters of the American Hockey League (AHL), where he had 9 points and 183 penalty minutes in 56 games. He remained with Lowell for the 2005–06 season, but due to a shoulder injury he played only 17 games with 4 points and 37 penalty minutes. Dwyer attended the Vancouver Canucks training camp in 2006 hoping to earn a roster space. He also attended the New York Islanders 2007 training camp where he was a late cut. Through 108 NHL contests he never scored a goal, though he obtained 5 assists and 394 penalty minutes.

Dwyer spent the latter half of the 2006–07 season with the Örebro Vipers of Swedish Division 1. In his first game for Örebro, he notched two assists, where he had 15 points and 16 penalty minutes in 11 games. In the 2007–08 season, he played for the Portland Pirates of the AHL, where he had 3 points and 27 penalty minutes in 13 games, and in Villingen-Schwenningen for the SERC Wild Wings in the German Bundesliga, where he had 7 points and 34 penalty minutes in 14 games. He returned to the Örebro Vipers for the 2008–09 season, where he had 7 points and 79 penalty minutes in 13 games.

==Coaching career==
Dwyer was named head coach and associate general manager of the Summerside Western Capitals of the Maritime Junior A Hockey League for the 2009–10 season. Dwyer led a rebuilding team to a regular-season record of 27–20–1–2. The Capitals finished third in the Roger Meek Division and won a seven-game division semifinal series against second-place Miramichi. The Capitals were then eliminated by eventual league champion Woodstock in a five-game division final. In 2010–11, Dwyer returned as the team&#x27;s head coach and associate director of hockey operations leading Summerside to a second-place finish with a 36–12–1–3 record. Under Dwyer&#x27;s guidance, the team went on to capture the Kent Cup as league champions with a 12–3 playoff record. Following the season, Dwyer was named the league&#x27;s coach of the year.

On May 17, 2011, Dwyer was named the head coach of the P.E.I. Rocket of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL). In &quot;The Hockey News&quot; 2011 edition of the 100 Most Powerful people in ice hockey, Dwyer was considered one of the top 40 under the age of 40. This recognition was attributed to his assistance in the development of Tuff &#x27;n Lite, a unisex cut resistant protective sport sock. The Rocket rebranded as the Charlottetown Islanders in 2013. On April 28, 2015, Dwyer was released after four years as head coach of the Rocket/Islanders earning a 116–133–9–14 overall record with the franchise, including a 35–28–1–4 his final post season when the Islanders defeated the Sherbrooke Phoenix to advance to the second round for the first time since 2004. At the time, he had been the longest-serving head coach in franchise history.

On June 15, 2015, Dwyer was named the head coach of the KHL Medveščak Zagreb of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL).

<doc id="1023229" wikidata="Q2481000" url="?curid=1023229" title="Ben Mezrich">
<text>Ben Mezrich ( ; born February 7, 1969) is an American author.

He has written well-known non-fiction books, including &quot;The Accidental Billionaires&quot; and &quot;The Antisocial Network&quot;, which have been turned into the films &quot;The Social Network&quot; and &quot;Dumb Money&quot;, respectively. Some of his books have been written under the pen-name Holden Scott.

==Early life and education==
Mezrich was born in Princeton, New Jersey, the son of Molli Newman, a lawyer, and Reuben Mezrich, a chairman of radiology at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. He has two brothers, including Josh Mezrich. He was raised in a Conservative Jewish household, and attended Princeton Day School, in Princeton, New Jersey. He graduated magna cum laude with a degree in Social Studies from Harvard University in 1991.

==Career==
Mezrich is best known for his first non-fiction work, &quot;Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six MIT Students Who Took Vegas for Millions&quot;. This book tells the story of a group of students from Massachusetts Institute of Technology who bet on blackjack games using a sophisticated card counting system, earning millions of dollars at casinos in Las Vegas and other gambling centers in the United States and the Caribbean. The story was made into the movie &quot;21&quot;, released in 2008. Despite being categorized as non-fiction many of the characters in &quot;Bringing Down the House&quot; are composite characters and some of the events described have been contested by the people the characters are based on. 

In 2004, Mezrich published &quot;Ugly Americans: The True Story of the Ivy League Cowboys Who Raided the Asian Markets for Millions&quot;. This book recounts the exploits of an American assistant securities trader, John Malcolm.

In 2005, Mezrich published &quot;Busting Vegas: The MIT Whiz Kid Who Brought the Casinos to Their Knees&quot;, a semi-sequel to &quot;Bringing Down the House&quot;. The book tells the story of another student involved in a similar Blackjack team, but one that used more advanced techniques than the ones discussed in the first book. As with &quot;Bringing Down the House&quot;, many of the events depicted in &quot;Busting Vegas&quot; were later contested by main character Semyon Dukach, who described the book as &quot;only about half true&quot;.
In 2007, Mezrich published &quot;Rigged: The True Story of a Wall Street Novice who Changed the World of Oil Forever&quot;, which recounts the formation of what would eventually become the Dubai Mercantile Exchange by two young visionaries, one in the New York Mercantile Exchange and the other in the Dubai Ministry of Finance.

Mezrich published a new book in July 2009 about Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, titled &quot;The Accidental Billionaires: The Founding of Facebook, A Tale of Sex, Money, Genius, and Betrayal&quot;. It debuted at No. 4 on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Nonfiction Bestseller List, and No. 1 on &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; Nonfiction Bestseller List.&quot; Aaron Sorkin adapted the book for the screenplay of the film &quot;The Social Network&quot;, which was released on October 1, 2010. It was directed by David Fincher and stars Jesse Eisenberg as Mark Zuckerberg and Andrew Garfield as Eduardo Saverin. Ten years later, in May 2019, Mezrich published a sequel centering on Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss: &quot;Bitcoin Billionaires: A True Story of Genius, Betrayal, and Redemption&quot;.

In 2014, Mezrich published &quot;Seven Wonders&quot;, his first novel since &quot;The Carrier&quot; in 2001. &quot;Seven Wonders&quot; is &quot;a fast-moving thriller involving murder, conspiracy, historical mystery, and the Seven Wonders of the World&quot;, according to Booklist. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; wrote that &quot;Mezrich has written a rollicking adventure with a fantastic behind-the-scenes tour of some of the world&#x27;s most intriguing spots.&quot;

His 2021 book, &quot;The Antisocial Network: The GameStop Short Squeeze and the Ragtag Group of Amateur Traders That Brought Wall Street to Its Knees&quot;, was adapted into the film &quot;Dumb Money&quot; directed by Craig Gillespie.

His 2023 book, &quot;Breaking Twitter: Elon Musk and the Most Controversial Corporate Takeover in History&quot;, is set to become a limited series.

==Personal life==
Mezrich has been married to Tonya M. Chen since 2006; they write the &quot;Charlie Numbers&quot; series together. He lives in Boston.

Mezrich was the co-host of season 3 of the GSN series &quot;World Series of Blackjack&quot; and &quot;World Blackjack Tour&quot;. He also represented Massachusetts as a contestant in the Sexiest Bachelor in America Pageant on Fox in 2000. &quot;Fatal Error&quot; is a TBS premiere movie adaptation of his second book, &quot;Reaper&quot;, starring Antonio Sabato, Jr. and Robert Wagner. &quot;Skin&quot; was originally written as an &quot;X-Files&quot; episode. &quot;Rigged&quot; was optioned by Mark Cuban&#x27;s company 2929, as was &quot;Q&quot;, a work of fiction by Mezrich. &quot;Ugly Americans&quot; has been optioned by Summit, with a screenplay written by Robert Schenkkan, Pulitzer Prize-winning writer of &quot;The Quiet American&quot;, and also a draft completed by Mezrich himself. Mezrich was the co-host of season 3 of the GSN series &quot;World Series of Blackjack&quot; and &quot;World Blackjack Tour&quot;. On August 9, 2016, 20th Century Fox acquired the film adaptation rights to Mezrich&#x27;s sci-fi novel &quot;Wolly,&quot; but the rights likely reverted back to Mezrich because of Disney&#x27;s acquisition of 21st Century Fox. Mezrich&#x27;s collaborator on &quot;Seven Wonders,&quot; film producer Beau Flynn, has set a television series adaptation for Amazon Prime Video with Simu Liu attached to both star in and produce the series.

<text>Rise Above Records is a London-based independent record label owned by Lee Dorrian, former member of Cathedral and Napalm Death.

==Founding==
Lee Dorrian started Rise Above Records in 1988 without the intention of the label being an ongoing position. It was during the same year that he had left his previous band, Napalm Death. Dorrian explained that it was predominantly done to &quot;get the dole off my back as they were asking a lot of questions as Napalm Death were on the front cover of the &quot;NME&quot; and on TV three times in one week, but I was still living in a council flat and couldn&#x27;t even afford the rent.&quot;

Rise Above Records was initially started up on the Enterprise Allowance Scheme, a Conservative government initiative which fronted cash to young entrepreneurs.

==Style==
Dorrian&#x27;s initial intention was to release hardcore punk music and limited edition releases. The label was named after the Black Flag song of the same name. The first release from the label was a Napalm Death live EP (Extended play) followed by releases from bands such as S.O.B. and Long Cold Stare.

Dorrian was a fan of bands such as Candlemass, Saint Vitus and Trouble but stated there &quot;wasn&#x27;t really a &#x27;doom scene&#x27; as such&quot; and that &quot;doom became an obsession&quot; for him. Finding that there were a scattered amount of doom metal groups in the United States (specifically Maryland), Dorrian attempted to &quot;give the scene a boost&quot; and released a compilation titled &quot;Dark Passages&quot;, a compilation stating that &quot;if people asked what doom was you could point to that record and there was something tangible to grab hold of.&quot; Dorrian found that the release &quot;didn&#x27;t get as many bands as we&#x27;d have liked, hence the reason why there are two Cathedral tracks on there.&quot; Dorrian admitted later that it took until 1997 &quot;that a new wave of doom bands started to appear. Ever since then it&#x27;s become really strong.&quot; Dorrian specifically noted Electric Wizard&#x27;s &quot;Come My Fanatics...&quot; as being &quot;the turning point of everything.&quot;

<text>George Edward Gray III(born March 11, 1967) is an American television personality and comedian. He is best known for hosting the game shows &quot;Extreme Gong&quot; and &quot;Weakest Link&quot;. Gray has also been the announcer of &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; since 2011.

==Early life and career==
Born in Ballwin, Missouri, Gray attended high school in Tucson, Arizona, and graduated from the University of Arizona. In college, he played drums with local band The Reason Why with his two English buddies Tony Randall and Shane Lamont. After working as a sketch and stand-up comedian, Gray&#x27;s first television hosting gig was for the Fox Movie Channel doing a show called &quot;FXM Friday Nights&quot;. He then appeared as co-host of the series &quot;Movies For Guys Who Like Movies&quot; on TBS.

==Hosting career==
Gray&#x27;s first in-studio show was &quot;Extreme Gong&quot;, an updated version of &quot;The Gong Show&quot;, on GSN in the late 1990s. He also hosted the first season of the American version of &quot;Junkyard Wars&quot;, which was nominated for a prime-time Emmy.

Gray was chosen in 2001 by NBC Enterprises to host the daily syndicated American version of the game show &quot;The Weakest Link&quot;, which aired from 2002–03. TV critic Steve Rogers likened Gray&#x27;s hosting style to the demeanor of a &quot;class clown&quot;, in contrast to the &quot;severe schoolmarm&quot; attitude of original &quot;The Weakest Link&quot; host Anne Robinson.

After hosting the reality series &quot;Todd TV&quot; on FX and the GSN special &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Greek Games&quot;, in late 2004, Gray went on to become the co-host of NBC&#x27;s &quot;$25 Million Dollar Hoax&quot;. He hosted ESPN&#x27;s reality sports competition &quot;I&#x27;d Do Anything&quot;. Beginning in 2006, Gray hosted the HGTV show &quot;What&#x27;s with That House?&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;That House&quot;), as well as HGTV&#x27;s &quot;Manland&quot; and the building competition &quot;Summer Showdown&quot;.

==&quot;The Price Is Right&quot;==
After previously appearing with a group of rotating auditioning announcers, Gray officially became the fourth regular announcer on &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; on April 18, 2011, succeeding Rich Fields.

On January 15, 2015, Gray fell off of a treadmill that he was describing during the show. Gray continued to describe the treadmill despite falling down, adding that &quot;Aspirin (was) not included&quot;. The video quickly went viral.

==Personal life==
Gray married Brittney Green, on April 13, 2019. The couple divorced in January 2025, citing “irreconcilable differences”.

===Health===
On the morning of April 20, 2020, Gray was hospitalized after suffering from three major heart attacks. He woke up with the chest pains and thought it was indigestion but his condition deteriorated. Gray suffered his first heart attack on the way to the hospital, his second after failed surgeries as he was walking around in the hospital, and his third as doctors were going to place a third stent in his heart. The surgeons then performed a quadruple bypass.

<text>Tri-Rail and Metrorail Transfer station is a Metrorail and Tri-Rail interchange station in Hialeah, Florida, northwest of the city of Miami proper.

This station is located near the intersection of East 25th Street and East 11th Avenue in Hialeah, Florida, officially opening for service on March 6, 1989. The station was built as a connection for the Tri-Rail and Metrorail rail systems; though the Amtrak station, which is served by the &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; and &quot;Silver Star&quot;, is located only a few blocks away, it is not officially connected to this station. The Amtrak station was scheduled to be moved to the Miami Intermodal Center by late 2018, but was delayed by several years due to a platform length issue. A third Tri-Rail/Metrorail transfer station began service on January 13, 2024 at MiamiCentral, which provides direct access into Downtown Miami along with additional transfer options such as Brightline and Metromover.

==Station layout==
The elevated Metrorail station is directly connected to the southbound Tri-Rail platform at the south end of the complex. Access between Tri-Rail platforms is available via an elevated overpass over the tracks at the north end of the complex.

<text>Witchfinder General was an English heavy metal band from Stourbridge. They were part of the new wave of British heavy metal scene and have been cited as a major influence on the doom metal genre. They were named after the 1968 British horror film &quot;Witchfinder General&quot;.

==History==

Witchfinder General formed in 1979 by Zeeb Parkes and Phil Cope in Stourbridge, England, as part of the new wave of British heavy metal movement during the early 1980s. They were strongly influenced by Black Sabbath, and have been described as one of the pioneers of the doom metal style. The band&#x27;s importance was acknowledged mostly after they disbanded. Witchfinder General disbanded sometime in 1984 amidst reported controversy of their sexually explicit album covers in the UK.

The band (minus vocalist and writer Zeeb Parkes) reformed in November 2006 – with new vocalist Gary Martin. The band released &quot;Buried Amongst the Ruins&quot; a compilation CD featuring the &quot;Burning a Sinner&quot; single, the &quot;Soviet Invasion&quot; EP, and four live tracks including a live version of the unreleased track &quot;Phantasmagorical&quot; in 2006. The band released their third full-length album &quot;Resurrected&quot; in 2008.

<doc id="1023271" wikidata="Q58765" url="?curid=1023271" title="Romance of the Western Chamber">
<text>Romance of the Western Chamber (), also translated as The Story of the Western Wing, The West Chamber, Romance of the Western Bower and similar titles, is one of the most famous Chinese dramatic works. It was written by the Yuan dynasty playwright Wang Shifu (王實甫), and set during the Tang dynasty. Known as &quot;China&#x27;s most popular love comedy,&quot; it is the story of a young couple consummating their love without parental approval, and has been seen both as a &quot;lover&#x27;s bible&quot; and &quot;potentially lethal,&quot; as readers were in danger of pining away under its influence.

== Contents of the play ==

Play I, Burning Incense and Worshiping the Moon

Play II, Icy Strings Spell Out Grief

Play III, Feelings Transmitted by Lines of Poetry

Play IV, A Clandestine Meeting of Rain and Clouds

Play V, A Reunion Ordained by Heaven

==Plot==
The play has twenty-one acts in five parts. It tells the story of a secret love affair between Zhang Sheng (张生), a young scholar, and Cui Yingying, the daughter of a chief minister of the Tang court. The two first meet in a Buddhist monastery. Yingying and her mother have stopped there to rest while escorting the coffin of Yingying&#x27;s father to their native town. Zhang Sheng falls in love with her immediately, but is prevented from expressing his feelings while Yingying is under her mother&#x27;s watchful eye. The most he can do is express his love in a poem read aloud behind the wall of the courtyard in which Yingying is lodging.

However, word of Yingying&#x27;s beauty soon reaches Sun the Flying Tiger, a local bandit. He dispatches ruffians to surround the monastery, in the hopes of taking her as his consort. Yingying&#x27;s mother agrees that whoever drives the bandits away can have Yingying&#x27;s hand in marriage, so Zhang Sheng contacts his childhood friend General Du, who is stationed not far away. The general subdues the bandits, and it seems that Zhang Sheng and Cui Yingying are set to be married. However, Yingying&#x27;s mother begins to regret her rash promise to Zhang Sheng, and takes back her word, with the excuse that Yingying is already betrothed to the son of another high official of the court. The two young lovers are greatly disappointed, and begin to pine away with their unfulfilled love. Fortunately, Yingying&#x27;s maid, Hongniang, takes pity on them, and ingeniously arranges to bring them together in a secret union. When Yingying&#x27;s mother discovers what her daughter has done, she reluctantly consents to a formal marriage on one condition: Zhang must travel to the capital and pass the civil service examination. To the joy of the young lovers, Zhang Sheng proves to be a brilliant scholar, and is appointed to high office. The story thus ends on a happy note, as the two are finally married.

==Historical development==

The original story was first told in a literary Chinese short story written by Yuan Zhen during the Tang dynasty. This version was called &quot;The Story of Yingying&quot;, or &quot;Yingying&#x27;s Biography&quot;. This version differs from the later play in that Zhang Sheng ultimately breaks from Yingying, and does not ask for her hand in marriage. Despite the unhappy ending, the story was popular with later writers, and recitative works based on it began accumulating in the centuries that followed. Perhaps bowing to popular sentiment, the ending gradually changed to the happy one seen in the play. The first example of the modified version is a &quot;chantefable&quot; (諸宮調, &quot;zhu gongdiao&quot;) titled Romance of the Western Chamber Zhu Gongdiao (西廂記諸宮調) by Master Dong (董解元, Dong Jieyuan, &quot;Jieyuan&quot; is an honorific meaning &quot;master&quot;) of the Jin dynasty (1115–1234). Wang Shifu&#x27;s play was closely modeled on this version.

==Reactions==
Due to scenes that unambiguously described Zhang Sheng and Cui Yingying fulfilling their love outside of the bond of marriage, moralists have traditionally considered &quot;The Story of the Western Wing&quot; to be an indecent, immoral, and licentious work. It was thus placed high on the list of forbidden books. Tang Laihe is reported to have said, &quot;I heard that in the 1590s the performance of the &quot;Hsi-hsiang chi&quot;...was still forbidden among [good] families.&quot; Gui Guang (1613–1673) called the work &quot;a book teaching debauchery.&quot; On the other hand, the famous critic Jin Shengtan considered it silly to declare a book containing sex to be immoral, since &quot;If we consider [sex] more carefully, what day is without it? What place is without it? Can we say that because there is [sex] between Heaven and Earth, therefore Heaven and Earth should be abolished?&quot;.

Since the appearance of this play in the thirteenth century, it has enjoyed unparalleled popularity. The play has given rise to innumerable sequels, parodies, and rewritings; it has influenced countless later plays, short stories, and novels and has played a crucial role in the development of drama criticism.

The theme of the drama is an attack on traditional mores, supporting the longing of young people in those days for freedom of marriage, although it follows the timeworn pattern of a gifted scholar and a beautiful lady falling in love at first sight. According to the orthodox viewpoint of Confucian society, love was not supposed to be a basis for marriage, as most marriages were arranged by the parents of the couples, but the happy ending of &quot;The Romance of the Western Chamber&quot; embodies the aspirations of people for more meaningful and happier lives.

Thus, the biggest difference between &quot;The Story of Yingying&quot; and &quot;The Story of the Western Wing&quot; lies in their endings—the former has a sad ending while the latter has a happy ending. What&#x27;s more,&quot;The Romance of the Western Chamber&quot; carries a more profound meaning in its conclusion, and directly suggests the ideal that all lovers in the world be settled down in a family union, with a more sharp-cut theme of attacking traditional mores and the traditional marriage system.

== Cultural influences ==
Since the first performance, &quot;The Romance of the Western Chamber&quot; has become the most popular love comedy in China. Nowadays, it is still actively performed on the stage. In the original traditional forms of art performance, such as Kun Opera and Beijing Opera, and other new forms of performance like musical and film. The resourceful maidservant Hongniang in the story is so prominent that evolves from a supporting role to an indispensable main character, becoming the synonym of marriage matchmaker in Chinese culture. In some local versions, the plays even is named by her name and the story itself is only slightly changed. &quot;The Romance of the Western Chamber&quot; also had profound influences on other literary works, such as &quot;Dream of the Red Chamber&quot;, the first of China&#x27;s Four Great Classical Novels, and another famous play, &quot;The Peony Pavilion&quot;, in the Ming dynasty. Jia Baoyu and Lin Daiyu reading &quot;Romance of the Western Chamber&quot; together is a very famous episode in the &quot;Dream of the Red Chamber&quot;. In chapter twenty-three, Lin Daiyu is surprised to find that Jia Baoyu is reading the play because in the Qing dynasty, this book was forbidden to read. At first, Baoyu tries to hide the book, but he could not hide it from her. Later, he expressed his love for Lin Daiyu through the famous sentences from the book.

== Artistic achievement ==
Artists working in different media—including painting, woodblock printmaking, and pottery decoration—drew upon the various literary works that told the story of Zhang Sheng and Cui Yingying, and their work relates to developments in Chinese literature and drama.

In the late Ming and early Qing dynasties, art that illustrated novels and dramatic productions became increasingly popular, and illustrations of &quot;The Romance of the Western Chamber&quot; were the most popular of all. Various Ming painters designed illustrations of the story, including Qian Gu, Tang Yin, and Chen Hongshou. One of the most accomplished renditions of the tale is the series of woodblock prints published, and probably designed, by Min Qiji (1580–after 1661) of Wucheng, Zhejiang province. His work, which dates to 1640, includes a frontispiece depicting Cui Yingying as well as one image for each of the twenty acts of the Yuan dynasty drama by Wang Shifu. Min Qiji&#x27;s album may also be one of the first to rely on the Chinese &quot;taoban&quot; 套板 printing technique, using six colors to fill in contours but also to add modeling and shading to the depicted images. A significant innovation of Min Qiji&#x27;s album is the presentation of scenes as if they were representations of dramatic performances or already-existing pictorial illustrations: the characters of the story appear as if they were paintings on handscrolls, folding fans, or standing screens; inscriptions on a bronze vessel; decorations on a lantern; and puppets used in a theatrical performance. It is possible that the innovative compositions of this album derive from designs by the Yuan artist Sheng Mao, also known as Sheng Mou (1271–1368). The album was likely meant to appeal to a wealthy customer who was a fan of the story.

From the 13th century to the 21st century, many scenes from &quot;The Romance of the Western Chamber&quot; decorated Chinese porcelain, although these have not been consistently recognized. Scenes from &quot;The Romance of the Western Chamber&quot; appear in porcelain of different periods, including the late Ming and early Qing dynasties. For example, the image of Yingying burning incense in the garden has become an archetype in Chinese art and is identifiable in decorated ceramics of the Jin, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties. Literary and dramatic scenes became popular as decorative patterns on blue-and-white porcelain produced in the Zhizheng era (1341–1367) of the Yuan dynasty. Allusions to &quot;The Romance of the Western Chamber&quot; in porcelain do not only draw upon Wang Shifu&#x27;s drama in the 13th century, but also relate to early poetry inspired by narratives of the Song dynasty, as well as dramas and story-telling performances of songs in the Jin dynasty.

<doc id="1023278" wikidata="Q159004" url="?curid=1023278" title="Thomas DiLorenzo">
<text>Thomas James DiLorenzo (; born August 8, 1954) is an American author and former university economics professor who is the President of the Ludwig von Mises Institute. He has written books denouncing President Abraham Lincoln and is well known among economists for his work chronicling the history of antitrust policy in the United States. 

He is a research fellow at The Independent Institute, Board of Advisors member at CFACT, and an associate of the Abbeville Institute. He identifies with the Austrian School of economics. He has spoken in favor of secession and has been described as an ally of, or part of, the neo-Confederate movement.

==Life and work==
Thomas James DiLorenzo grew up in western Pennsylvania, descended from Italian immigrants. In an essay he attributed his individualism to playing sports. He began to study libertarianism in college.

He has a BA in Economics from Westminster College in Pennsylvania. He holds a PhD in Economics from Virginia Tech.

DiLorenzo has taught at the State University of New York at Buffalo, George Mason University, and the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga.

He is a former adjunct fellow of the Center for the Study of American Business at Washington University in St. Louis. From 1992 to 2020, he was a professor of economics at Loyola University Maryland Sellinger School of Business. As of 2020, DiLorenzo was no longer listed as active faculty at Loyola University, and instead as a professor emeritus. He is a research fellow at the Independent Institute.

DiLorenzo is a speaker at Mises Institute events and teaches some of its online courses. He writes for the blog LewRockwell.com. He was listed as an affiliated scholar though 2009 of the Institute for the Study of Southern Culture, which is run by the League of the South, a neo-Confederate group. The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) in 2004 described DiLorenzo as one of 10 key ideologues in the neo-Confederate movement.

==Views==

DiLorenzo writes about what he calls &quot;the myth of Lincoln&quot; in American history and politics. He has said, &quot;Lincoln is on record time after time rejecting the idea of racial equality. But whenever anyone brings this up, the Lincoln partisans go to the extreme to smear the bearer of bad news.&quot; DiLorenzo has spoken out in favor of the secession of the Confederate States of America, defending the right of these states to secede from an abolitionist perspective. He has described himself as a historical revisionist. He has called the American Civil War the &quot;War for Southern Independence&quot;. 

DiLorenzo is critical of Alexander Hamilton&#x27;s financial views, the concept of &quot;implied powers&quot; in the Constitution, the existence of a federal bank, and the use of Keynesian economics to increase the national debt.

DiLorenzo is critical of neoconservatism and military interventionism.

DiLorenzo is critical of the Sherman Act, noting that &quot;the Sherman Act was never intended to protect competition. It was a blatantly protectionist act designed to shield smaller and less efficient businesses from their larger competitors. There never was a golden age of antitrust.&quot;

DiLorenzo (by appealing to popular opinion) referred to Israel&#x27;s response to Hamas for what they did on October 7, as a genocide.

== Books ==
DiLorenzo has written extensively on Abraham Lincoln. According to one historian, &quot;Most historians are inclined to dismiss DiLorenzo as a crackpot. But... his books generally sell better than those of academic &#x27;Lincolnologists&#x27; and... [his] views help lay the foundation for conservative political action today&quot;, historian David Blight has recently suggested that we ignore these writings at our peril.&quot;

DiLorenzo&#x27;s book &quot;The Real Lincoln: A New Look at Abraham Lincoln, His Agenda, and an Unnecessary War&quot; is a critical biography published in 2002. Writing for &quot;The Daily Beast&quot;, Rich Lowry described DiLorenzo&#x27;s technique in this book as the following: &quot;His scholarship, such as it is, consists of rummaging through the record for anything he can find to damn Lincoln, stripping it of any nuance or context, and piling on pejorative adjectives. In DiLorenzo, the Lincoln-haters have found a champion with the judiciousness and the temperament they deserve.&quot;

In a review published by the Ludwig von Mises Institute, David Gordon described DiLorenzo&#x27;s thesis: Lincoln was a &quot;white supremacist&quot; with no principled interest in abolishing slavery, and believed in a strong central government that imposed high tariffs and a nationalized banking system. He attributes the South&#x27;s secession to Lincoln&#x27;s economic policies rather than a desire to preserve slavery. Gordon quotes DiLorenzo: &quot;slavery was already in sharp decline in the border states and the upper South generally, mostly for economic reasons&quot;.

Reviewing for &quot;The Independent Review&quot;, the magazine of The Independent Institute, a think tank associated with DiLorenzo, Richard M. Gamble of Palm Beach Atlantic University said that the book &quot;manages to raise fresh and morally probing questions&quot; and that DiLorenzo &quot;writes primarily not as a defender of the Old South and its institutions, culture, and traditions, but as a libertarian enemy of the Leviathan state&quot; but bemoans that DiLorenzo was &quot;careless&quot; in his handling of sources and despite his &quot;evident courage and ability&quot;, his execution was lacking. Gamble concludes that the book is a &quot;travesty of historical method and documentation&quot;. He said the book was plagued by a &quot;labyrinth of [historical and grammatical] errors&quot;, and that DiLorenzo has &quot;earned the... ridicule of his critics.&quot; 

In a review for the Claremont Institute, historian Ken Masugi writes that &quot;DiLorenzo adopts as his own the fundamental mistake of leftist multi-culturalist historians: confusing the issue of race with the much more fundamental one, which was slavery.&quot; He noted that in Illinois &quot;the anti-slavery forces actually joined with racists to keep their state free of slavery, and also free of blacks.&quot; Masugi called DiLorenzo&#x27;s work &quot;shabby&quot; and stated that DiLorenzo&#x27;s treatment of Lincoln was &quot;feckless&quot; and that the book is &quot;truly awful&quot;. In 2002, DiLorenzo debated Claremont Institute fellow professor Harry V. Jaffa on the merits of Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s statesmanship before and during the Civil War.

DiLorenzo&#x27;s book, &quot;Lincoln Unmasked: What You&#x27;re Not Supposed to Know About Dishonest Abe&quot; (2007), continues his explorations begun in &quot;The Real Lincoln.&quot; Reviews in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; both stated that the book seemed directed at unnamed scholars who had praised Lincoln&#x27;s contributions. Justin Ewers criticized DiLorenzo, saying this book &quot;is more of a diatribe against a mostly unnamed group of Lincoln scholars than a real historical analysis. His wild assertions – for example, that Lincoln held &#x27;lifelong white supremacist views&#x27; – don&#x27;t help his argument.&quot; &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; described this as a &quot;laughable screed,&quot; in which DiLorenzo &quot;charges that most scholars of the Civil War are part of a &#x27;Lincoln cult&#x27;;&quot; he particularly attacks scholar Eric Foner, characterizing him and others as &quot;cover-up artists&quot; and &quot;propagandists&quot;. 

Writing for the Mises Institute that DiLorenzo leads, David Gordon summarises DiLorenzo&#x27;s thesis: that Lincoln opposed the extension of slavery to new states because black labor would compete with white labor; that Lincoln hoped that all blacks would eventually be deported to Africa in order that white laborers could have more work. According to Gordon, DiLorenzo states that Lincoln supported emancipation of slaves only as a wartime expedient to help defeat the South. 

In a 2009 review of three newly published books on Lincoln, historian Brian Dirck linked the earlier work of Thomas DiLorenzo with that of Lerone Bennett, another critic of Lincoln. He wrote that &quot;Few Civil War scholars take Bennett and DiLorenzo seriously, pointing to their narrow political agenda and faulty research.&quot;

DiLorenzo&#x27;s 2008 book &quot;Hamilton&#x27;s Curse: How Jefferson&#x27;s Arch Enemy Betrayed the American Revolution--and What It Means for Americans Today&quot; expands on DiLorenzo&#x27;s libertarian, small government views and details ideological differences between &quot;Hamiltonians&quot; and &quot;Jeffersonians&quot; in the role of the central government.

== League of the South involvement ==
In 2009, Indiana University historian Carl R Weinberg wrote in the magazine of the Organization of American Historians that &quot;DiLorenzo has also allied himself with the neo-Confederate League of the South, which shares his view that slavery had little to do with the Civil War and that &#x27;big government&#x27; is the root of all evil.&quot; 

Congressman Lacy Clay criticized DiLorenzo for his associations with the group when DiLorenzo testified before the House Financial Services Committee at the request of former U.S. Congressman Ron Paul in 2011. &quot;Washington Post&quot; columnist Dana Milbank noted that the League of the South had listed DiLorenzo on its Web site as an &quot;affiliated scholar&quot; as recently as 2008. Milbank also wrote that DiLorenzo had in 2010 told a secessionist Web site, DumpDC, that &quot;secession is not only possible but necessary if any part of America is ever to be considered &#x27;the land of the free&#x27; in any meaningful sense&quot;.

DiLorenzo denied any affiliation with the group, telling a &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot; reporter that &quot;I don&#x27;t endorse what they say and do any more than I endorse what Congress says and does because I spoke at a hearing on Wednesday.&quot; An investigation was subsequently conducted by his employer, but no action was taken. In a LewRockwell.com column, he described his association with the League as limited to &quot;a few lectures on the economics of the Civil War&quot; he gave to The League of the South Institute about thirteen years ago. In a 2005 LewRockwell.com article, DiLorenzo addressed concerns against the League of the South&#x27;s core beliefs statement stating that neoconservative viewpoints were at odds with the League of the South&#x27;s statement, leading to vitriol. Further, DiLorenzo argues that the current Republican party is descended, not from the small-government views of Jefferson, but rather from the ideals of the Hamiltonian Federalist Party.

<text>Mike Keith (born September 11, 1967) is the radio play-by-play voice of the University of Tennessee Tennessee Volunteers football team.

==Early life==
Keith&#x27;s broadcasting ambitions began at age 7, when his father began taking him to University of Tennessee football and basketball games. While attending elementary school in Chattanooga, Tennessee, Keith was part of a reading program where he participated in a mock newscast. In 1977, his family moved to Franklin, Tennessee, a Nashville suburb. Keith attended high school at Battle Ground Academy in Franklin. He played a wide receiver, punter and defensive back as a member of the school&#x27;s football team.

==Broadcasting career==
After high school, Keith attended the University of Tennessee. Here, he began his broadcasting career as a student and continued after completing school. From 1987 to 1998, Keith worked for John Ward with the Vol Radio Network, a network that covers University of Tennessee athletics. From 1989 to 1998, Keith hosted daily sports talk shows on WIVK, a Knoxville, Tennessee radio station, and he covered University of Tennessee sports in Knoxville for WIVK-FM radio and WBIR-TV television.

In 1996, Bud Adams, the owner of the National Football League&#x27;s Houston Oilers announced he would move his team to Nashville. That same year, while the team was in still in Houston, Keith began hosting a pre-game show for Tennessee stations that carried the Oilers games. He served as the network’s scoreboard host in 1997 before moving into the booth as color analyst in 1998. In 1999, Keith took over the play-by-play duties.

Since taking over the play-by-play role, Keith has consistently announced every Titans touchdown with his signature phrase, &quot;Touchdown Titans!&quot; Keith&#x27;s most famous call is that of the Music City Miracle, near the end of his first season as play-by-play announcer. The unbelievable play resulted in a last-minute Titans win that kept them alive in the 1999-2000 NFL Playoffs and eventually led the team to Super Bowl XXXIV.

Since 1999, Keith has won the Tennessee Sportscaster of the Year Award twelve times. He hosted the television show &quot;Titans All Access&quot;, in addition to hosting daily Titans updates on Titans Radio, and hosting the weekly &quot;Mike Vrabel Show&quot;, a radio show which featured Mike Vrabel as co-host.

==Personal life==
Keith is married to his wife Michelle. They have a daughter and a son. He was also the play-by-play radio voice of the Arena Football League&#x27;s Nashville Kats. He also worked as the public address announcer for Battle Ground Academy’s home football games. Keith&#x27;s father, Bill, is president of FirstExpress, a truckload carrier company based in Nashville.

<doc id="1023294" wikidata="Q467588" url="?curid=1023294" title="America's Space Prize">
<text>America&#x27;s Space Prize was a US$50 million space competition in orbital spaceflight established and funded in 2004 by hotel entrepreneur Robert Bigelow. The prize would have been awarded to the first US-based privately funded team to design and build a reusable crewed capsule capable of flying 5 astronauts to a Bigelow Aerospace inflatable space module. The criteria also required the capsule be recovered and flown again in 60 days. The prize expired January 10, 2010, without a winner or any test flights attempted. The teams were required to have been based in the United States.

== History ==
The prize was announced by Bigelow on 17 December 2003—the 100th anniversary of the Wright brothers first powered aircraft flight.

==Prize rules==
A set of ten criteria were set up in order for a contestant to win the prize.
# The spacecraft must reach a minimum altitude of 400 kilometers (approximately 250 miles);
# The spacecraft must reach a minimum velocity sufficient to complete two (2) full orbits at altitude before returning to Earth;
# The spacecraft must carry no less than a crew of five (5) people;
# The spacecraft must dock or demonstrate its ability to dock with a Bigelow Aerospace inflatable space habitat, and be capable of remaining on station at least six (6) months;
# The spacecraft must perform two (2) consecutive, safe and successful orbital missions within a period of sixty (60) calendar days, subject to Government regulations;
# No more than twenty percent (20%) of the spacecraft may be composed of expendable hardware;
# The contestant must be domiciled in the United States of America.
# The contestant must have its principal place of business in the United States of America;
# The Competitor must not accept or utilize government development funding related to this contest of any kind, nor shall there be any government ownership of the competitor. Use in government test facilities shall be permitted; and
# The spacecraft must complete its two (2) missions safely and successfully, with all five (5) crew members aboard for the second qualifying flight, before the competition&#x27;s deadline of Jan. 10, 2010

==Contestants==
Since the launch of the prize, 40 companies had expressed interest, but either did not have the money which would apparently be needed, or, in the case of SpaceX, were ineligible due to having accepted government funding. Despite the lack of interest, Bigelow did not revise the prize rules, planning instead to seek transportation to space other ways.

A few contestants have been:

* Interorbital Systems
* JP Aerospace
* SpaceDev
* SpaceX

<doc id="1023301" wikidata="Q371255" url="?curid=1023301" title="Gas syringe">
<text>A gas syringe is a piece of laboratory glassware used to insert or withdraw a volume of a gas from a closed system, or to measure the volume of gas evolved from a chemical reaction. A gas syringe can also be used to measure and dispense liquids, especially where these liquids need to be kept free from air.

A gas syringe has an inner syringe chamber which has a ground glass surface. The syringe barrel also has a ground glass surface. The ground surface of the barrel moves freely within the ground glass surface of the syringe chamber with very little friction. The close mating of these ground glass surfaces also gives a reasonably gas-tight seal. Like a ground glass stopcock, the two parts of a gas syringe should preferably not be interchanged with another gas syringe of the same volume, unless told otherwise by the distributor. Gas syringes come in various sizes from 500 ml to 0.25 ml and tend to be accurate to between 0.01 and 1 ml, depending on the size of the syringe.

== Gas syringe use ==
A gas syringe can be used to measure gaseous products from a reaction.

When using a gas syringe to measure gases it is important to keep the syringe free from liquids. As gases can dissolve in liquids, especially under any resulting pressure, this may result in inaccurate measurements (Henry&#x27;s law).

The amount of gas in moles formed in a reaction can be measured by measuring the volume of gas evolved at standard (or known) pressure conditions (gas law, PV=nRT).

Accordingly, it is important that the syringe barrel should move freely within the syringe chamber, if one assumes that the measured gas is at standard temperature and pressure. Any friction would result in a pressure build-up in the syringe and would lead to an inaccurate measurement, that is, a lower amount of gas would be determined, than really obtained.

== Liquid use ==
Glass syringes are also conveniently used to measure and dispense solvents and other liquids. They are often used in air-free techniques to take solvents after they have been purified in stills, or from containers sealed with septa, to prevent gas entering the solution. They can also be use for transportation of substances that react spontaneously with air (pyrophoric reagents).

Liquids drawn up into a gas syringes can optionally be sparged with inert gas before dispensing into a reaction vessel such as a Schlenk flask. This is done by drawing the liquid into the syringe via a needle, inserting the needle into the septum sealing a flask under a positive pressure of an inert gas, removing the glass plunger, and allowing the gas to bubble through the liquid in the syringe for several minutes. The glass plunger is then re-inserted and the liquid is added to the reaction flask. Other techniques such as cannulation can also be used to transfer liquids instead.

<text>Auburn &quot;Pat&quot; Hare (December 20, 1930 – September 26, 1980) was an American electric blues guitarist and singer. His heavily distorted, power chord–driven electric guitar performances in the early 1950s is considered an important precursor of heavy metal music. His guitar work with Little Junior&#x27;s Blue Flames had a major influence on the rockabilly style, and his guitar playing on blues records by artists such as Muddy Waters was influential among 1960s British Invasion blues rock bands such as the Rolling Stones and the Yardbirds.

==Biography==
Hare, who was African-American, was born in Cherry Valley, Arkansas. He recorded at the Sun Studio in Memphis, Tennessee, serving as a sideman for Howlin&#x27; Wolf, James Cotton, Muddy Waters, Bobby Bland and other artists. Hare was one of the first guitarists to purposely use the effects of distortion in his playing.

In 1951, he joined a blues band formed by Junior Parker, called Little Junior&#x27;s Blue Flames. He played the electric guitar solo on &quot;Love My Baby&quot; (1953), which later inspired the rockabilly style. One of their biggest hits was &quot;Next Time You See Me&quot;, which in 1957 reached number 5 on the Billboard R&amp;B chart and number 74 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 pop chart.

His guitar solo on James Cotton&#x27;s electric blues record &quot;Cotton Crop Blues&quot; (1954) was the first recorded use of heavily distorted power chords, later an element of heavy metal music. According to Robert Palmer, &quot;Rarely has a grittier, nastier, more ferocious electric guitar sound been captured on record, before or since, and Hare&#x27;s repeated use of a rapid series of two downward-modulating power chords, the second of which is allowed to hang menacingly in the air, is a kind of hook or structural glue. [...] The first heavy metal record? I&#x27;d say yes, with tongue only slightly in cheek.&quot; The other side of the single was &quot;Hold Me in Your Arms&quot;; both songs &quot;featured a guitar sound so overdriven that with the historical distance of several decades, it now sounds like a direct line to the coarse, distorted tones favored by modern rock players.&quot; According to Allmusic, &quot;what is now easily attainable by 16-year-old kids on modern-day effects pedals just by stomping on a switch, Hare was accomplishing with his fingers and turning the volume knob on his Sears &amp; Roebuck cereal-box-sized amp all the way to the right until the speaker was screaming.&quot;

Hare was reported to have been introverted when sober (once married to Dorothy Mae Good, with whom he had a son and two daughters), but he had a serious problem with alcohol abuse. Shortly after the &quot;Cotton Crop Blues&quot; recording, he recorded a version of the early 1940s Doctor Clayton song &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Murder My Baby&quot; on May 14, 1954, which has since been released on the 1990 Rhino Records compilation album &quot;Blue Flames: A Sun Blues Collection&quot;. The record also features power chords, which remains &quot;most fundamental in modern rock&quot; as &quot;the basic structure for riff-building in heavy metal bands.&quot; According to Robert Palmer, the song is &quot;as heavy metal as it gets.&quot; According to the album liner notes, &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Murder My Baby&quot; is &quot;doubly morbid because he did just that&quot;. In December 1963, Hare shot his girlfriend dead in Minneapolis and also shot a policeman who came to investigate. At the time of his arrest, he was playing in the blues band of Muddy Waters. He was replaced in the band by the guitarist James &quot;Pee Wee&quot; Madison. Hare pleaded guilty to murder and spent the last 16 years of his life in prison, where he formed a band named Sounds Incarcerated. He developed lung cancer in prison and died in 1980 in Saint Paul, Minnesota.

<text>Katalla (pronounced &quot;KA-tell-ah&quot;, sometimes spelled Catalla) is a ghost town in the Valdez-Cordova Census Area in the U.S. state of Alaska, southeast of Cordova. The name of this town was sometimes spelled Catalla. It is now abandoned.

==Geography==

Katalla is located within the Chugach National Forest near Controller Bay and the Bering River.

==History==

Katalla was at the center of the now-abandoned Katalla oil field. This was the first discovery of commercial quantities of oil in Alaska (1902). The town reportedly had a population of 5,000 in 1907-1908.

This was the result of the announcement that the Copper River and Northwestern Railway (CR&amp;NW) was going to use the town&#x27;s location as its access to the Pacific Ocean and the Bering River coal fields. Violent storms in the fall of 1907 destroyed the jetty being built and it was decided to move the railroad&#x27;s terminus to nearby Cordova.

The famous &quot;ship of gold&quot; &quot;SS Portland&quot;, ran aground and sank at Katalla in November 1910, during one of these autumn storms. The town&#x27;s population continued to depend on the small oil field for income until December 25, 1933, when fire damaged its refinery and operations ceased. The town&#x27;s post office closed in 1943 and the town site was abandoned.

The oil and gas extraction rights for the Katalla area were granted to the Chugach Alaska Corporation by the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. Before that, however, at least some of the rights to the field were owned by the California-Mexican-Alaska Holding Company, which dissolved and sold its assets to the Alaska Coal, Oil &amp; By-Products Company in 1929.

A Korean coal mining consortium resurrected potential interest in Katalla after they did coal exploration in the Bering River coal fields in the early 1980s. Interest waned as the coal reserves did not appear economically viable, and a haul route to Katalla would by necessity have to cross areas subject to slope instability and periodic glacial dam outbursts from Bering Lake.

== Demographics ==
Katalla first appeared on the 1910 U.S. Census as an unincorporated village. It continued to report until 1940, after which it was abandoned.

<text>Harold Abraham McRae (; born July 10, 1945) is an American former left fielder in Major League Baseball who played for the Cincinnati Reds (1968, 1970–72) and Kansas City Royals (1973–87). Utilized as a designated hitter for most of his career, McRae batted and threw right-handed. He is the father of former major league outfielder Brian McRae.

==Biography==
===Playing career===
McRae was selected by the Reds in the 6th round of the 1965 draft with the 117th overall pick. In the pre-1969 offseason, playing winter ball in Puerto Rico, McRae suffered a multiple leg fracture sliding on the basepaths. In the words of Bill James in &quot;The Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract&quot;, &quot;Before the accident, McRae was a burner, a center fielder who could fly...after the accident, his speed was major league average.&quot; He was considered a below-average outfielder with the Reds.

In spring training 1969, McRae came to the Reds&#x27; camp with his leg still in a cast from the fracture. The same offseason, St. Louis Cardinals announcer Harry Caray had suffered multiple fractures being struck by a car while on foot. During a Reds-Cardinals preseason game where Caray was interviewing ballplayers on the field while still on crutches, Reds Manager Dave Bristol pointed in Caray&#x27;s direction and said to McRae, &quot;Look at that. There&#x27;s an old man. Broke two legs. Broke his shoulder. Broke his everything. And here he is walking around doing his job, doing anything he wants. Here you are, all you did was break your leg sliding into second base, and you can&#x27;t get your leg out of your goddam cast! You ought to be ashamed of yourself.&quot;

McRae later mentioned to Caray that it was &quot;one of the best motivational speeches he&#x27;d ever heard. He learned that he had to want to recover before he&#x27;d really be able to.&quot; Later in his career, Royals teammate Dan Quisenberry recalled, whenever a Royals player took time off because of injury, &quot;McRae gets dressed like a commando, hides in a trash can in the clubhouse, and then jumps out and &#x27;shoots&#x27; the guy...McRae believes that if a guy is hurt and can&#x27;t play, he&#x27;s dead to the club, so McRae shoots him and kills him.&quot;

McRae was traded along with Wayne Simpson to the Royals for Roger Nelson and Richie Scheinblum on December 1, 1972. McRae developed as a consistent designated hitter in the American League (AL). His playing career spanned 23 years, including 14 seasons with Kansas City. He was selected a three-time All-Star, he hit over .300 six times for the Royals and was named Designated Hitter of the Year three times both by &quot;The Sporting News&quot; and the Associated Press.
McRae led the AL batting title race entering the final game of the 1976 regular season which was a 5–3 loss to the Minnesota Twins at Royals Stadium on October 3. He lost out to teammate George Brett .3333 to .3326, with the race decided in the ninth inning when he grounded out to the shortstop immediately after Brett hit an inside-the-park home run to left field. He confronted Twins manager Gene Mauch on the field, with both being restrained by players and umpires. McRae accused Mauch of racism for allegedly ordering left fielder Steve Brye to let Brett&#x27;s fly ball drop in front of him. His claim was declared unsubstantiated by a post-season league investigation. Oddly, the other two of the top four finishers that season, the Minnesota Twins&#x27; Rod Carew and Lyman Bostock, played in that same game. McRae did end up leading the AL with a .407 on-base percentage. The following season, he led the majors with 54 doubles.

After his recovery from the leg fracture, McRae became known as &quot;the most aggressive baserunner of the 1970s,&quot; as quoted by James, &quot;a man who left home plate thinking &#x27;double&#x27; every time he hit the ball...he taught the younger players and reminded the veterans to take nothing for granted, and to take no prisoners on the bases.&quot; In game four of the 1980 World Series, McRae twice turned a seemingly routine single to center field into a two-base hit. McRae played hard—so hard, in fact, that the rule requiring a runner to slide into second base when breaking up a double play is still referred to as the Hal McRae Rule in honor of the man whose cross-body blocks into second base broke up a lot of double plays and second basemen at the same time.

In 1982, McRae had another outstanding year as he led the majors with 46 doubles and 133 RBI. He finished fourth in AL MVP voting.

In a 19-year major league career, McRae posted a .290 batting average (2091-for-7218) with 191 home runs, 1097 RBI, 484 doubles, 65 triples and 109 stolen bases in 2084 games played. He added a .351 on-base percentage and a .454 slugging average for a combined .805 OPS.

===Managerial career===
Following his playing retirement, McRae managed the Royals (1991–94) and Tampa Bay Devil Rays (2001–02). He also served as hitting coach for the Cincinnati Reds, Philadelphia Phillies, and St. Louis Cardinals. McRae, who won a World Series ring playing for Kansas City against the Cardinals in 1985, won a ring as a coach for the Cardinals when they defeated the Detroit Tigers in the 2006 World Series, four games to one.

McRae is perhaps well known for a profanity-laced tirade he went on as Royals&#x27; manager early in the 1993 season while being interviewed by reporters after a Royals loss. The tantrum included throwing numerous objects around his office, including a cup of Coke and his office phone, and one reporter left McRae&#x27;s office with a bloodied face. The tirade was captured on video and widely disseminated at the time. A video of the meltdown was later uploaded to YouTube and has 1.5 million views as of July 2024. McRae was not fired and continued to manage after the incident.

<doc id="1023324" wikidata="Q569178" url="?curid=1023324" title="Serge Savard">
<text>Serge Aubrey Savard (born January 22, 1946) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey defenceman, most famously with the Montreal Canadiens of the National Hockey League (NHL). He also served as the Canadiens&#x27; Senior Vice President of Hockey Operations and as their general manager. He is a businessman in Montreal, and is nicknamed &quot;The Senator.&quot; In 2017 Savard was named one of the 100 Greatest NHL Players in history.

==Playing career==
Savard played minor league hockey with the Montreal Junior Canadiens and the Omaha Knights. He made his NHL debut with the Montreal Canadiens in 1966-67. In 1968–69, his second full NHL season, he won the Conn Smythe Trophy as the playoffs&#x27; most valuable player, the first defenceman to do so. In fifteen seasons with the Canadiens, Savard played on eight Stanley Cup championship teams: 1967-68, 1968-69, 1970-71, 1972-73, 1975-76, 1976-77, 1977-78, and 1978-79. In 1978-79, he won the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy for perseverance and dedication to the game. Savard played the last two seasons of his career with the Winnipeg Jets before retiring in 1983. He was the second last active player of the Original Six era. (Wayne Cashman was the last, as he and the Boston Bruins advanced further in the playoffs that year than the Jets did.)

Savard was known for the &quot;Savardian Spin-o-rama&quot;, a quick pivoting turn with the puck done in order to evade opponents; the term was coined by sportscaster Danny Gallivan. Savard has said that it was Doug Harvey, a Montreal defenseman whom Savard idolized, who created the move which inspired him.

Savard played for Team Canada in the 1972 Summit Series against the Soviet Union. He was in the starting lineup for games 2 and 3 in Toronto and Winnipeg. He suffered a hairline fracture in his leg which forced him to sit out games 4 and 5. He returned to the lineup for the last three games, and was the only Canadian player to play in the 4 wins, and 1 tie game, without having played in a game they lost.

==Post-playing career==
After Savard retired as a player, he was named the general manager of the Canadiens, and served as the general manager of the Sherbrooke Canadiens of the American Hockey League. Savard won the Calder Cup with Sherbrooke in 1985. He was the general manager of the Montreal Canadiens when they won the Stanley Cup in 1985-86 and 1992-93 .

In 1994 he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. In 2004, he was made a Knight of the National Order of Quebec. He is currently the chairman of the annual Canada Day festivities in Montreal. He lived a few years in Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville, Quebec. His son Marc ran unsuccessfully in the 2004 Canadian federal election for the Liberal Party in the riding of Saint-Bruno-Saint-Hubert .

In 1998, he was ranked number 81 on &quot;The Hockey News&quot;&#x27; list of the 100 Greatest Hockey Players.

Since 1993, Savard has been a partner in a firm of real-estate developers, Thibault, Messier, Savard &amp; Associates, based in Montreal.

In September 2004, Savard was arrested in Montreal under suspicion of drunk driving. He pleaded not guilty in November 2004, but changed his plea to guilty in May 2006.

On November 18, 2006, the Montreal Canadiens retired his jersey number 18 in a ceremony at the Bell Centre.

In April 2012 after the dismissal of Pierre Gauthier, Montreal Canadiens owner Geoff Molson called upon Savard to assist and advise him in the team&#x27;s search for a new general manager.

Savard was part-owner in a resort called El Senador located in Cayo Coco, Cuba until it was sold in 2005. The name was a Spanish translation of his nickname.

Savard has been a longtime fan of harness racing. He has co-owned many successful horses, including Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame inductee Shadow Play and Meadowlands Pace champion Lawless Shadow.

==Awards==
*Won Stanley Cup — eight as a player (1968, 1969, 1971, 1973, 1976, 1977, 1978, and 1979), and two as a manager (1986, and 1993), all with the Montreal Canadiens

From June 2021 until December 2021, Gallacher co-presented &quot;The Great British Breakfast&quot; on the news channel GB News.

==Early life==
The daughter of Bernard Gallacher, a professional golfer and Ryder Cup captain, and Lesley Gallacher, Kirsty Gallacher was born in Edinburgh, Scotland. When her father got the job of professional at Wentworth Golf Club, they moved south to Virginia Water, England, when she was 18 months old. Gallacher and her younger brother and sister were raised on the Wentworth Estate, where their close neighbours included Bruce Forsyth. She was educated at Coworth Flexlands and St George&#x27;s School in Ascot, Berkshire.

==Career==
Approached by Mark Sharman, then deputy head of sport at Sky, at a Ryder Cup dinner, she began working as a production assistant in 1996, before moving on to the position of editorial assistant on Sky Sports.

<doc id="1023340" wikidata="Q4353503" url="?curid=1023340" title="Orca Inlet">
<text>Orca Inlet is an arm of Prince William Sound in southern Alaska. The town of Cordova was founded on its coast in 1906. All marine traffic reaches the town through Orca Inlet.

==Geography==
Orca Inlet lies south and east of Hawkins Island at . The Inlet is about long running southwest and about wide at its widest point. The south end opens into the Gulf of Alaska while the north end joins with Orca Bay.

The city of Cordova, Alaska is situated on the southeast shore of Orca Inlet.

==History==
Orca Inlet was listed in the Geographic Dictionary of Alaska in 1906, citing J.F. Moser&#x27;s report from 1897. The Orca Cannery operated on the south shore of the inlet; there was a post office at that location from 1894. The Odiak Cannery was located 3 miles (4.8 km) southwest of Orca, at the present location of Cordova.

There were once large Pacific razor clam beds in the intertidal zones of Orca Inlet which were harvested and shipped out of Cordova. Harvests reached 3.5 million pounds (1.6 million kilograms) at its peak. Populations began to decline in the late 1950s. When the 1964 Good Friday earthquake struck the clam beds were uplifted around exposing them out of the intertidal zone. This led to moderate mortality and eventually the industry crashed.

==Geology and currents==
Like other arms of Prince William Sound, Orca Inlet is a fjord. There are large areas on its coast with large rounded rocks as well as many cirques and hanging valleys. Glacial erosion created steep walls on the sides of the fjord. In one area the elevation rises to within of the coastline. The southern and central areas are filled with sediment making the area very shallow. These deposits resulted from the receded glacier that once filled the fjord as well as current inflow through the seaward end of the inlet from the Copper River and other smaller glacial streams. These deposits drift westward along the coast until they reach the entrance of Orca Inlet. Orca Inlet can serve as an entrance to Prince William Sound from the Gulf of Alaska but the shallow water limits the size of vessels that can use the route. In 1914, the southern two-thirds of the inlet was generally deep or less with a few, discontinuous channels, while the north part was deep.

Copper ore has been found in the area around Orca Inlet but there has been little development to mine it.

The tidal current flows southward on the flood and northward on the ebb. Mean velocity at the peak of the flood is and at the peak of the ebb.

<text>was a Japanese politician. He was a member of the House of Representatives of Japan and a member of the Liberal Democratic Party. He was Chief Cabinet Secretary in the government of Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda from 2007 to 2008 and twice Minister for Foreign Affairs, in the cabinets of Junichiro Koizumi and Shinzō Abe. He resigned as the Speaker of the House of Representatives on 21 April 2015 after suffering from a stroke.

==Early life and education==
Machimura was born on 17 October 1944. His father was Kingo Machimura the Governor of Hokkaido (1959–1971) and his grandfather was Kinya Machimura one of the founders of Hokkaido&#x27;s dairy industry. Machimura attended the University of Tokyo and Wesleyan University in the United States.

==Career==

Machimura was elected to his first term in the House of Representatives in the December 1983 election, and he was re-elected in each election since. He became Minister of Education, Science, Sports and Culture on 11 September 1997, as part of Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto&#x27;s second cabinet, and became State Secretary for Foreign Affairs on 31 July 1998, in Keizō Obuchi&#x27;s first cabinet. In March 2000, he became Special Advisor to the Prime Minister, serving under Obuchi and his successor, Yoshirō Mori. On 5 December 2000, he became Minister of Education, Science, Sports and Culture and Director-General of the Science and Technology Agency, before becoming Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology on 6 January 2001.

He was the Minister for Foreign Affairs under Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi from 27 September 2004 to 31 October 2005. His goals included signing a treaty with Russia relations with China and Korea form leader resolving a border dispute, and investigating the whereabouts of Japanese hostages who were kidnapped by North Korean agents during the 1970s and 1980s. He was replaced by Tarō Asō in the cabinet reshuffle that followed the 11 September 2005 election.

He was appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs again by Prime Minister Shinzō Abe on 27 August 2007. In 2006, Machimura became chairman of the &quot;Seiwa Seisaku Kenkyūkai&quot;, the LDP&#x27;s largest faction. As such, on 14 September 2007, he backed Yasuo Fukuda&#x27;s bid to become Abe&#x27;s successor, following Abe&#x27;s resignation on 12 September. Since 2007, Machimura had co-chaired his faction alongside Hidenao Nakagawa and Shūzen Tanigawa.

In Fukuda&#x27;s government, sworn in on 16 September 2007, Machimura became Chief Cabinet Secretary and State Minister in charge of abduction issues. He was replaced by Takeo Kawamura in the cabinet of prime minister Taro Aso, which was appointed on 24 September 2008.

He was the vice president of the Japan-China Friendship Parliamentarians&#x27; Union.

==Personal life==
On 18 December 2007, Machimura said at an official press conference that he believed in the existence of UFOs.

On 1 June 2015, he died after a cerebral infarction at a hospital in Tokyo.

<doc id="1023353" wikidata="Q1014918" url="?curid=1023353" title="Burgers' equation">
<text>Burgers&#x27; equation or Bateman–Burgers equation is a fundamental partial differential equation and convection–diffusion equation occurring in various areas of applied mathematics, such as fluid mechanics, nonlinear acoustics, gas dynamics, and traffic flow. The equation was first introduced by Harry Bateman in 1915 and later studied by Johannes Martinus Burgers in 1948. For a given field formula_1 and diffusion coefficient (or &quot;kinematic viscosity&quot;, as in the original fluid mechanical context) formula_2, the general form of Burgers&#x27; equation (also known as viscous Burgers&#x27; equation) in one space dimension is the dissipative system:

:formula_3

The term formula_4 can also rewritten as formula_5. When the diffusion term is absent (i.e. formula_6), Burgers&#x27; equation becomes the inviscid Burgers&#x27; equation:

:formula_7

which is a prototype for conservation equations that can develop discontinuities (shock waves).

The reason for the formation of sharp gradients for small values of formula_2 becomes intuitively clear when one examines the left-hand side of the equation. The term formula_9 is evidently a wave operator describing a wave propagating in the positive formula_10-direction with a speed formula_11. Since the wave speed is formula_11, regions exhibiting large values of formula_11 will be propagated rightwards quicker than regions exhibiting smaller values of formula_11; in other words, if formula_11 is decreasing in the formula_10-direction, initially, then larger formula_11&#x27;s that lie in the backside will catch up with smaller formula_11&#x27;s on the front side. The role of the right-side diffusive term is essentially to stop the gradient becoming infinite.

== Inviscid Burgers&#x27; equation==

The inviscid Burgers&#x27; equation is a conservation equation, more generally a first order quasilinear hyperbolic equation. The solution to the equation and along with the initial condition

:formula_19

can be constructed by the method of characteristics. Let formula_20 be the parameter characterising any given characteristics in the formula_10-formula_20 plane, then the characteristic equations are given by

:formula_23

Integration of the second equation tells us that formula_11 is constant along the characteristic and integration of the first equation shows that the characteristics are straight lines, i.e.,

:formula_25

where formula_26 is the point (or parameter) on the &quot;x&quot;-axis (&quot;t&quot; = 0) of the &quot;x&quot;-&quot;t&quot; plane from which the characteristic curve is drawn. Since formula_11 at formula_10-axis is known from the initial condition and the fact that formula_11 is unchanged as we move along the characteristic emanating from each point formula_30, we write formula_31 on each characteristic. Therefore, the family of trajectories of characteristics parametrized by formula_26 is

:formula_33

Thus, the solution is given by

:formula_34

This is an implicit relation that determines the solution of the inviscid Burgers&#x27; equation provided characteristics don&#x27;t intersect. If the characteristics do intersect, then a classical solution to the PDE does not exist and leads to the formation of a shock wave. Whether characteristics can intersect or not depends on the initial condition. In fact, the &quot;breaking time&quot; before a shock wave can be formed is given by

:formula_35

===Complete integral of the inviscid Burgers&#x27; equation===

The implicit solution described above containing an arbitrary function formula_36 is called the general integral. However, the inviscid Burgers&#x27; equation, being a first-order partial differential equation, also has a complete integral which contains two arbitrary constants (for the two independent variables). Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar provided the complete integral in 1943, which is given by

:formula_37

where formula_38 and formula_39 are arbitrary constants. The complete integral satisfies a linear initial condition, i.e., formula_40. One can also construct the general integral using the above complete integral.

==Viscous Burgers&#x27; equation==

The viscous Burgers&#x27; equation can be converted to a linear equation by the Cole–Hopf transformation,

:formula_41

which turns it into the equation

:formula_42

which can be integrated with respect to formula_10 to obtain

:formula_44

where formula_45 is an arbitrary function of time. Introducing the transformation formula_46 (which does not affect the function formula_1), the required equation reduces to that of the heat equation

:formula_48

The diffusion equation can be solved. That is, if formula_49, then

:formula_50

The initial function formula_51 is related to the initial function formula_52 by

:formula_53

where the lower limit is chosen arbitrarily. Inverting the Cole–Hopf transformation, we have

:formula_54

which simplifies, by getting rid of the time-dependent prefactor in the argument of the logarithm, to

:formula_55

This solution is derived from the solution of the heat equation for formula_56 that decays to zero as formula_57; other solutions for formula_11 can be obtained starting from solutions of formula_56 that satisfies different boundary conditions.

==Some explicit solutions of the viscous Burgers&#x27; equation==
Explicit expressions for the viscous Burgers&#x27; equation are available. Some of the physically relevant solutions are given below:

===Steadily propagating traveling wave===
If formula_52 is such that formula_61 and formula_62 and formula_63, then we have a traveling-wave solution (with a constant speed formula_64) given by

:formula_65

This solution, that was originally derived by Harry Bateman in 1915, is used to describe the variation of pressure across a weak shock wave. When formula_66 and formula_67 to

:formula_68

with formula_69.

===Delta function as an initial condition===
If formula_70, where formula_71 (say, the Reynolds number) is a constant, then we have

:formula_72

In the limit formula_73, the limiting behaviour is a diffusional spreading of a source and therefore is given by

:formula_74

On the other hand, In the limit formula_75, the solution approaches that of the aforementioned Chandrasekhar&#x27;s shock-wave solution of the inviscid Burgers&#x27; equation and is given by

:formula_76

The shock wave location and its speed are given by formula_77 and formula_78

===N-wave solution===
The N-wave solution comprises a compression wave followed by a rarafaction wave. A solution of this type is given by

:formula_79

where formula_80 may be regarded as an initial Reynolds number at time formula_81 and formula_82 with formula_83, may be regarded as the time-varying Reynold number.

==Other forms==

===Multi-dimensional Burgers&#x27; equation===
In two or more dimensions, the Burgers&#x27; equation becomes

:formula_84

One can also extend the equation for the vector field formula_85, as in

:formula_86

===Generalized Burgers&#x27; equation===

The generalized Burgers&#x27; equation extends the quasilinear convective to more generalized form, i.e.,

:formula_87

where formula_88 is any arbitrary function of u. The inviscid formula_6 equation is still a quasilinear hyperbolic equation for formula_90 and its solution can be constructed using method of characteristics as before.

===Stochastic Burgers&#x27; equation===

Added space-time noise formula_91, where formula_92 is an formula_93 Wiener process, forms a stochastic Burgers&#x27; equation

:formula_94

This stochastic PDE is the one-dimensional version of Kardar–Parisi–Zhang equation in a field formula_95 upon substituting formula_96.

The Nerang River rises in the McPherson Range in the Numinbah Valley on the New South Wales and Queensland border and heads north, then east where it flows through and reaching its mouth in the Gold Coast Broadwater at on the Gold Coast and emptying into the Coral Sea. The river descends over its course. Major crossings of the river occur at Nerang where the river is crossed by the Pacific Motorway and at Southport where the river is crossed by the Gold Coast Highway.

The Nerang River catchment is the largest and most significant river system on the Gold Coast. Its upper reaches in the McPherson Range and Springbrook Plateau deliver flows through significant rural areas and also feed into the Hinze Dam, creating Advancetown Lake, the Gold Coast&#x27;s main water supply, and Little Nerang Dam. These two reservoirs provide a large percentage of potable water for the Gold Coast and are managed by Gold Coast Water. The Hinze Dam has had a significant flood mitigation effect. In the river&#x27;s lower catchment, multi-branched canal developments and a number of artificial tidal and freshwater lake systems have influenced and altered large aras of the floodplain. These canal developments provide a range of opportunities for many residents including boating and recreational fishing. The canals and lakes provide habitat to a range of aquatic, terrestrial and marine flora and fauna. The canal systems provide for drainage of stormwater and contribute to flood mitigation, but can periodically be subject to contamination via stormwater drainage.

A number of islands are located in the canal region of the river&#x27;s lower catchment, including the Girung, Paradise, Chevron, Cronin and McIntosh Islands. Two man-made lakes are also located in the lower catchment, including the Lake Rosser and Lake Capabella.

The river&#x27;s mouth was once located much further south. In the early 1800s it entered the ocean at Broadbeach and by 1930 its mouth was located where Sea World now is. The main driving force for this movement is the northward drift of sand along the coast.

===Crossings===
A number of river crossings of the Nerang River are named, including the following listed below (from upstream to downstream), together with their location relative to tributaries of the river:
==Etymology==

The river was initially named the River Barrow by government surveyor Robert Dixon when he charted the Gold Coast in 1840, after Sir John Barrow, Secretary of the Admiralty. The surveyor general Thomas Mitchell later changed many places to Aboriginal names, and this included giving the Nerang River its present name. &quot;Neerang&quot; or &quot;neerung&quot; are Yugambeh words meaning &quot;little shark&quot; or &quot;shovel-nosed shark&quot;. But the local aboriginal people called the river Mogumbin or Been-goor-abee; and the peoples of the Tweed called it Talgai.

==History==
In June 1967, the development of an east coast low lead to the rising of waters in the river that went on to flood significant lands upriver from Surfers Paradise.

==Recreation==

===Surfers Riverwalk===
The City of Gold Coast council&#x27;s &quot;Surfers Riverwalk&quot; coastal pathway links Sundale Bridge, Macintosh Island, Budd&#x27;s Beach, Surfers Central Riverwalk, Cascade Gardens, the Gold Coast Convention and Exhibition Centre, Casino Island and Pacific Fair Shopping Centre.

===Boat ramps===
Boat ramps that are open to the public are located at Waterways Drive at Main Beach, Budds Beach, Evandale, on the Isle of Capri, TE Peters Drive at Broadbeach Waters (Convention Centre), Carrara Road, Carrara, and at the Nerang River Parklands.

==Nerang Riverkeepers Group==
Established in 2000, under the Beaches to Bushland Volunteer restoration program, the group works to restore local endemic species along the Nerang River. A major ongoing project is control of the invasive cats claw creeper, registered as a Weed of National Significance. Cat’s claw creeper was introduced to Australia. It is native to Central and South America and the West Indies. It was first reported as naturalised in the 1950s. The seeds spread by wind or water. A woody vine, it invades warm native forests killing native trees and undergrowth. If cut down it can regrow from persistent underground tubers.

<text>The National Enterprise Board (NEB) was a United Kingdom government body. It was set up in 1975 by the Labour government of Harold Wilson, to support the government&#x27;s interventionist approach to industry. In 1981 the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher, combined the NEB with the National Research Development Corporation (NRDC) to form the British Technology Group.

==Background==
The NEB was the brainchild of the economist Stuart Holland and the Shadow Secretary of State for Industry Tony Benn in the early-1970s, and was modelled on the Italian Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale (IRI), which was seen to have successfully restructured the Italian economy after World War II. In its original conception, the NEB was intended to extend public control and ownership of the economy, by taking a stake in the UK&#x27;s leading manufacturing firms, which would then be required to make planning agreements to meet economic targets. This was given impetus by a growing desire amongst Labour&#x27;s left-wing to fulfil the promise contained in Clause IV of the Party&#x27;s constitution, for social ownership of the economy. 

Although the leadership of the Labour Party did not fully accept these proposals, they appeared in the Labour Party&#x27;s manifesto for the February 1974 general election and the October 1974 election.

The Labour Party manifesto for the October 1974 general election stated:

We shall set up a National Enterprise Board to administer publicly-owned share-holdings: to extend public ownership into profitable manufacturing industry by acquisitions, partly or wholly, of individual firms; to stimulate investment; to create employment in areas of high unemployment; to encourage industrial democracy; to promote industrial efficiency; to increase exports and reduce our dependence on imports; to combat private monopoly; and to prevent British industries from passing into unacceptable foreign control.
A new and urgent Industry Act will provide for a system of Planning Agreements between the Government and key companies to ensure that the plans of those companies are in harmony with national needs and objectives and that Government financial assistance is deployed where it will be most effectively used. Wherever we give direct aid to a company out of public funds we shall reserve the right to take a proportionate share of the ownership of the company; and wherever possible this public support will be channelled through the Planning Agreements System.

==History==
The plans were outlined in the 1974 White Paper &quot;The Regeneration of British Industry&quot; and the Industry Act 1975 enacted these measures, establishing the NEB.

Its primary role was that of holding a substantial level of equity in major manufacturing companies. In its final form the NEB was watered down from its original proposals, with planning agreements being made voluntary instead of compulsory. It took equity in various companies including British Leyland, Rolls-Royce, Alfred Herbert, Sinclair Radionics, International Computers Limited (ICL) and Ferranti. 

===Activities===
In practice the NEB&#x27;s main activity became one of rescuing failing companies, with mixed results. It also made efforts to develop Britain&#x27;s fledgling electronics and computer industries.

One of the first tasks of the NEB was the production of the Ryder Report, named after the NEB&#x27;s new chairman, Lord Ryder, on the future of British Leyland.

In 1975 the NEB bailed out the struggling electronics firm Ferranti and effectively nationalised it, acquiring a 65% share of the company. After restructuring, it was returned to the private sector in 1980 as a profitable company.

Also in 1975, the NEB invested £25 million into the loss-making machine tool manufacturer Alfred Herbert to modernise the business and reduce borrowings, but this failed to turn the company around;
it was acquired by &quot;Tooling Investments&quot; in 1980 and went into receivership in 1982.

The loss-making Cambridge Instrument Company was acquired by the NEB in 1976, who performed a substantial reorganisation of the business. It was returned to profitability and privatised again in 1979.

The NEB invested money, and took equity in various small and medium sized companies. By 1977, the NEB had a holding in 16 different companies, including the British assets of the bankrupt Fairey Group which it acquired in a bidding contest.

In 1977 the NEB rescued Sinclair Radionics from bankruptcy, provided a loan facility and took effective control of the company by acquiring a 73% stake.

The memory and microprocessor company Inmos was set up by the NEB in 1978. It captured 60% of the global market in static RAM devices, but never made a profit and was sold in 1989.

The NEB only ever reached one planning agreement with a private company, when it bailed out Chrysler Europe in order to save jobs, however the planning agreement was breached in 1978 when Chrysler sold its operations to Peugeot.

===Demise===
After the Conservative Party took power in 1979 under Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s leadership, the NEB&#x27;s powers began to be eroded. The last Labour-appointed chairman of the NEB was Sir Leslie Murphy, who resigned with his entire board when Sir Keith Joseph (the new industry minister) decided to remove its responsibility for the government&#x27;s holding in Rolls-Royce later that year.

The next chairman was Sir Arthur Knight who was content to lose a number of companies, but strongly supported the Inmos microchip project. However he eventually became frustrated by the government and resigned in November 1980. The 1980 Industry Act and new Guidelines had restricted the NEB role to a catalytic investment role, nationally and regionally, particularly related to advanced technology and small firms.

Knight was succeeded by his deputy, Sir John King (later Lord King of Wartnaby), who proceeded, with some vigour, to dismantle most of the board&#x27;s remaining activities.

In 1981, under the chairmanship of Sir Frederick Wood, the NEB was combined with the National Research Development Corporation (NRDC) to form the British Technology Group (BTG).

In 1992 BTG was transferred to the private sector and in 1995 listed on the London stock exchange as BTG plc, when it became a leading technology transfer company that commercialised intellectual property acquired from research organisations and companies around the world.

<text>Sam Brown, pseudonym of Adam Culbert, is an American illustrator and author most noted for his website, explodingdog. The gimmick of the site is that he draws pictures based on titles that visitors to the site send him via email or Twitter. He has also written two books of art and short stories, &quot;Wish For Something Better&quot; and &quot;Amazing Rain&quot;, based on the art of his website.

Most of Sam Brown&#x27;s art is created in Adobe Photoshop on a Wacom tablet, although recently he has begun doing some drawings on paper. The fact that the art is produced on a computer is not readily apparent from viewing; other than occasional digital filters and transparency effects, the majority of the work is solid color-filled line drawings.

Recurrent themes in Sam Brown&#x27;s art include dogs, fish, birds, robots, alien visitors, evil (portrayed as a green liquid), clouds, dictators and rockets, although he will never draw monkeys. His people have a distinctive appearance, their faces a plain circle with a line drawn across the middle for the mouth and two scribbled circles for eyes. 

In 2007 Sam Brown became a member of the Dumbrella comic collective.

<doc id="1023378" wikidata="Q182264" url="?curid=1023378" title="Albite">
<text>Albite is a plagioclase feldspar mineral. It is the sodium endmember of the plagioclase solid solution series. It represents a plagioclase with less than 10% anorthite content. The pure albite endmember has the formula . It is a tectosilicate. Its color is usually pure white, hence its name from Latin, . It is a common constituent in felsic rocks.

== Properties ==
Albite crystallizes with triclinic pinacoidal forms. Its specific gravity is about 2.62 and it has a Mohs hardness of 6 to 6.5. Albite almost always exhibits crystal twinning often as minute parallel striations on the crystal face. Albite often occurs as fine parallel segregations alternating with pink microcline in perthite as a result of exolution on cooling.

There are two variants of albite, which are referred to as &#x27;low albite&#x27; and &#x27;high albite&#x27;; the latter is also known as &#x27;analbite&#x27;. Although both variants are triclinic, they differ in the volume of their unit cell, which is slightly larger for the &#x27;high&#x27; form. The &#x27;high&#x27; form can be produced from the &#x27;low&#x27; form by heating above High albite can be found in meteor impact craters such as in Winslow, Arizona. Upon further heating to more than the crystal symmetry changes from triclinic to monoclinic; this variant is also known as &#x27;monalbite&#x27;. Albite melts at .

Oftentimes, potassium can replace the sodium characteristic in albite at amounts of up to 10%. When this is exceeded the mineral is then considered to be anorthoclase.

== Occurrence ==

It occurs in granitic and pegmatite masses (often as the variety cleavelandite), in some hydrothermal vein deposits, and forms part of the typical greenschist metamorphic facies for rocks of originally basaltic composition. Minerals that albite is often considered associated with in occurrence include biotite, hornblende, orthoclase, muscovite and quartz.

== Discovery ==
Albite was first reported in 1815 for an occurrence in Finnbo, Falun, Dalarna, Sweden.

== Use ==
Albite is used as a gemstone, albeit semiprecious. Albite is also used by geologists as it is identified as an important rock forming mineral. There is some industrial use for the mineral such as the manufacture of glass and ceramics.

One of the iridescent varieties of albite, discovered in 1925 near the White Sea coast by academician Alexander Fersman, became widely known under the trade name belomorite.

<doc id="1023388" wikidata="Q10433" url="?curid=1023388" title="Eridanus (constellation)">
<text>Eridanus is a constellation which stretches along the southern celestial hemisphere. It is represented as a river. One of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century AD astronomer Ptolemy, it remains one of the 88 modern constellations. It is the sixth largest of the modern constellations. The same name was later taken as a Latin name for the real Po River and also for the name of a minor river in Athens.

==Features==
===Stars===
At its southern end is the magnitude 0.5 star Achernar, designated Alpha Eridani. It is a blue-white hued main sequence star 144 light-years from Earth, whose traditional name means &quot;the river&#x27;s end&quot;. Achernar is a very peculiar star because it is one of the flattest stars known. Observations indicate that its radius is about 50% larger at the equator than at the poles. This distortion occurs because the star is spinning extremely rapidly.

There are several other noteworthy stars in Eridanus, including some double stars. Beta Eridani, traditionally called Cursa, is a blue-white star of magnitude 2.8, 89 light-years from Earth. Its place to the south of Orion&#x27;s foot gives it its name, which means &quot;the footstool&quot;. Theta Eridani, called Acamar, is a binary star with blue-white components, distinguishable in small amateur telescopes and 161 light-years from Earth. The primary is of magnitude 3.2 and the secondary is of magnitude 4.3. 32 Eridani is a binary star 290 light-years from Earth. The primary is a yellow-hued star of magnitude 4.8 and the secondary is a blue-green star of magnitude 6.1. 32 Eridani is visible in small amateur telescopes. 39 Eridani is a binary star also divisible in small amateur telescopes, 206 light-years from Earth. The primary is an orange-hued giant star of magnitude 4.9 and the secondary is of magnitude 8. 40 Eridani is a triple star system consisting of an orange main-sequence star, a white dwarf, and a red dwarf. The orange main-sequence star is the primary of magnitude 4.4, and the white secondary of magnitude 9.5 is the most easily visible white dwarf. The red dwarf, of magnitude 11, orbits the white dwarf every 250 years. The 40 Eridani system is 16 light-years from Earth. p Eridani is a binary star with two orange components, 27 light-years from Earth. The magnitude 5.8 primary and 5.9 secondary have an orbital period of 500 years.
Epsilon Eridani (the proper name is Ran) is a star with one extrasolar planet similar to Jupiter. It is an orange-hued main-sequence star of magnitude 3.7, 10.5 light-years from Earth. Its one planet, with an approximate mass of one Jupiter mass, has a period of 7 years.

===Supervoid===

The Eridanus Supervoid is a large supervoid (an area of the universe devoid of galaxies) discovered . At a diameter of about one billion light years it is the second largest known void, superseded only by the Giant Void in Canes Venatici. It was discovered by linking a &quot;cold spot&quot; in the cosmic microwave background to an absence of radio galaxies in data of the United States National Radio Astronomy Observatory&#x27;s Very Large Array Sky Survey. There is some speculation that the void may be due to quantum entanglement between our universe and another.

===Deep-sky objects===

NGC 1535 is a small blue-gray planetary nebula visible in small amateur telescopes, with a disk visible in large amateur instruments. 2000 light-years away, it is of the 9th magnitude.

A portion of the Orion Molecular Cloud Complex can be found in the far northeastern section of Eridanus. IC 2118 is a faint reflection nebula believed to be an ancient supernova remnant or gas cloud illuminated by nearby supergiant star Rigel in Orion.

Eridanus contains the galaxies NGC 1232, NGC 1234, NGC 1291 and NGC 1300, a grand design barred spiral galaxy.

NGC 1300 is a face-on barred spiral galaxy located 61 (plus or minus 8) million light-years away. The center of the bar shows an unusual structure: within the overall spiral structure, a grand design spiral that is 3,300 light-years in diameter exists. Its spiral arms are tightly wound.

===Meteor showers===
The Nu Eridanids, a recently discovered meteor shower, radiate from the constellation between August 30 and September 12 every year; the shower&#x27;s parent body is an unidentified Oort cloud object. Another meteor shower in Eridanus is the Omicron Eridanids, which peak between November 1 and 10.

== Visualizations ==

Eridanus is depicted in ancient sky charts as a flowing river, starting from Orion and flowing in a meandering fashion past Cetus and Fornax and into the southern hemispheric stars. Johann Bayer&#x27;s Uranometria depicts the river constellation as a flowing river.

==History and mythology==
According to one theory, the Greek constellation takes its name from the Babylonian constellation known as the Star of Eridu (MUL.NUN.KI). Eridu was an ancient city in the extreme south of Babylonia; situated in the marshy regions it was held sacred to the god Enki-Ea who ruled the cosmic domain of the Abyss - a mythical conception of the fresh-water reservoir below the Earth&#x27;s surface.

Eridanus is connected to the myth of Phaethon, who took over the reins of his father Helios&#x27; sky chariot (i.e., the Sun), but didn&#x27;t have the strength to control it and so veered wildly in different directions, scorching both Earth and heaven. Zeus intervened by striking Phaethon dead with a thunderbolt and casting him to Earth. The constellation was supposed to be the path Phaethon drove along; in later times, it was considered a path of souls. Since &quot;Eridanos&quot; was also a Greek name for the Po (Latin &quot;Padus&quot;), in which the burning body of Phaethon is said by Ovid to have extinguished, the mythic geography of the celestial and earthly Eridanus is complex.

Another association with Eridanus is a series of rivers all around the world. First conflated with the Nile River in Egypt, the constellation was also identified with the Po River in Italy. The stars of the modern constellation Fornax were formerly a part of Eridanus.

==Equivalents==

The stars that correspond to Eridanus are also depicted as a river in Indian astronomy starting close to the head of Orion just below Auriga. Eridanus is called &quot;Srotaswini&quot; in Sanskrit, &quot;srótas&quot; meaning the course of a river or stream. Specifically, it is depicted as the Ganges on the head of Dakshinamoorthy or Nataraja, a Hindu incarnation of Shiva. Dakshinamoorthy himself is represented by the constellation Orion.

The stars that correspond to Eridanus cannot be fully seen from China. In Chinese astronomy, the northern part is located within the White Tiger of the West (西方白虎, &quot;Xī Fāng Bái Hǔ&quot;). The unseen southern part was classified among the Southern Asterisms (近南極星區, &quot;Jìnnánjíxīngōu&quot;) by Xu Guangqi, based on knowledge of western star charts.

<doc id="1023390" wikidata="Q20180462" url="?curid=1023390" title="Elastance">
<text>Electrical elastance is the reciprocal of capacitance. The SI unit of elastance is the inverse farad (F−1). The concept is not widely used by electrical and electronic engineers, as the value of capacitors is typically specified in units of capacitance rather than inverse capacitance. However, elastance is used in theoretical work in network analysis and has some niche applications, particularly at microwave frequencies.

The term &quot;elastance&quot; was coined by Oliver Heaviside through the analogy of a capacitor to a spring. The term is also used for analogous quantities in other energy domains. In the mechanical domain, it corresponds to stiffness, and it is the inverse of compliance in the fluid flow domain, especially in physiology. It is also the name of the generalized quantity in bond-graph analysis and other schemes that analyze systems across multiple domains.

==Usage==
The definition of capacitance (&quot;C&quot;) is the charge (&quot;Q&quot;) stored per unit voltage (&quot;V&quot;).

formula_1

Elastance (&quot;S&quot;) is the reciprocal of capacitance, thus,

formula_2

Expressing the values of capacitors as elastance is not commonly done by practical electrical engineers, but can be convenient for capacitors in series since their total elastance is simply the sum of their individual elastances. However, elastance is sometimes used by network theorists in their analyses. One advantage of using elastance is that an increase in elastance results in an increase in impedance, aligning with the behavior of the other two basic passive elements, resistance and inductance. An example of the use of elastance can be found in the 1926 doctoral thesis of Wilhelm Cauer. On his path to founding network synthesis, he developed the loop matrix A:

formula_3

where L, R, S, and Z are the network loop matrices of inductance, resistance, elastance, and impedance, respectively, and &quot;s&quot; is complex frequency. This expression would be significantly more complicated if Cauer had used a matrix of capacitances instead of elastances. The use of elastance here is primarily for mathematical convenience, similar to how mathematicians use radians rather than more common units for angles.

Elastance is also applied in microwave engineering. In this field, varactor diodes are used as voltage-variable capacitors in devices such as frequency multipliers, parametric amplifiers, and variable filters. These diodes store charge in their junction when reverse biased, which generates the capacitor effect. The slope of the voltage-stored charge curve in this context is referred to as &quot;differential elastance.&quot;

== Units ==
The SI unit of elastance is the reciprocal of the farad (F−1). The term &quot;daraf&quot; is sometimes used for this unit, but it is not approved by the SI and its use is discouraged. The term &quot;daraf&quot; is formed by reversing the word &quot;farad,&quot; in much the same way as the unit &quot;mho&quot; (a unit of conductance, also not approved by the SI) is formed by writing &quot;ohm&quot; backwards.

The term &quot;daraf&quot; was coined by Arthur E. Kennelly, who used it as early as 1920.

==History==
The terms &quot;elastance&quot; and &quot;elastivity&quot; were coined by Oliver Heaviside in 1886. Heaviside coined many of the terms used in circuit analysis today, such as impedance, inductance, admittance, and conductance. His terminology followed the model of resistance and resistivity, with the &quot;-ance&quot; ending used for extensive properties and the &quot;-ivity&quot; ending used for intensive properties. Extensive properties are used in circuit analysis (they represent the &quot;values&quot; of components), while intensive properties are used in field analysis. Heaviside&#x27;s nomenclature was designed to emphasize the connection between corresponding quantities in fields and circuits. 

Elastivity is the intensive property of a material, corresponding to the bulk property of a component, elastance. It is the reciprocal of permittivity. As Heaviside stated, 
Here, &quot;permittance&quot; is Heaviside&#x27;s term for capacitance. He rejected any terminology that implied a capacitor acted as a container for holding charge. He opposed the terms &quot;capacity&quot; (capacitance) and &quot;capacious&quot; (capacitive) along with their inverses, &quot;incapacity&quot; and &quot;incapacious.&quot; At the time, the capacitor was often referred to as a &quot;condenser&quot; (suggesting that the &quot;electric fluid&quot; could be condensed), or as a &quot;leyden,&quot; after the Leyden jar, an early capacitor, both implying storage. Heaviside preferred a mechanical analogy, viewing the capacitor as a compressed spring, which led to his preference for terms suggesting properties of a spring. 

Heaviside&#x27;s views followed James Clerk Maxwell&#x27;s perspective on electric current, or at least Heaviside&#x27;s interpretation of it. According to this view, electric current is analogous to velocity, driven by the electromotive force, similar to a mechanical force. At a capacitor, current creates a &quot;displacement&quot; whose rate of change is equivalent to the current. This displacement was seen as an electric strain, like mechanical strain in a compressed spring. Heaviside denied the idea of physical charge flow and accumulation on capacitor plates, replacing it with the concept of the divergence of the displacement field at the plates, which was numerically equal to the charge collected in the flow view.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, some authors adopted Heaviside&#x27;s terms &quot;elastance&quot; and &quot;elastivity.&quot; Today, however, the reciprocal terms &quot;capacitance&quot; and &quot;permittivity&quot; are almost universally preferred by electrical engineers. Despite this, elastance still sees occasional use in theoretical work. One of Heaviside&#x27;s motivations for choosing these terms was to distinguish them from mechanical terms. Thus, he selected &quot;elastivity&quot; rather than &quot;elasticity&quot; to avoid the need to clarify between &quot;electrical elasticity&quot; and &quot;mechanical elasticity.&quot;

Heaviside carefully crafted his terminology to be unique to electromagnetism, specifically avoiding overlaps with mechanics. Ironically, many of his terms were later borrowed back into mechanics and other domains to describe analogous properties. For example, it is now necessary to differentiate &quot;electrical impedance&quot; from &quot;mechanical impedance&quot; in some contexts. &quot;Elastance&quot; has also been used by some authors in mechanics to describe the analogous quantity, though &quot;stiffness&quot; is often preferred. However, &quot;elastance&quot; is widely used for the analogous property in the domain of fluid dynamics, particularly in fields such as biomedicine and physiology.

==Mechanical analogy==
Mechanical–electrical analogies are established by comparing the mathematical descriptions of mechanical and electrical systems. Quantities that occupy corresponding positions in equations of the same form are referred to as &quot;analogues.&quot; There are two main reasons for creating such analogies.

The first reason is to explain electrical phenomena in terms of more familiar mechanical systems. For example, the differential equations governing an electrical RLC circuit (inductor-capacitor-resistor circuit) are of the same form as those governing a mechanical mass-spring-damper system. In such cases, the electrical domain is translated into the mechanical domain for easier understanding.

The second, and more significant, reason is to analyze systems containing both mechanical and electrical components as a unified whole. This approach is especially beneficial in fields like mechatronics and robotics, where integration of mechanical and electrical elements is common. In these cases, the mechanical domain is often converted into the electrical domain because network analysis in the electrical domain is more advanced and highly developed.

===The Maxwellian analogy===
In the analogy developed by Maxwell, now known as the impedance analogy, voltage is analogous to force. The term &quot;electromotive force&quot; used for the voltage of an electric power source reflects this analogy. In this framework, current is analogous to velocity. Since the time derivative of displacement (distance) is equal to velocity and the time derivative of momentum equals force, quantities in other energy domains with similar differential relationships are referred to as &quot;generalized displacement,&quot; &quot;generalized velocity,&quot; &quot;generalized momentum,&quot; and &quot;generalized force.&quot; In the electrical domain, the generalized displacement is charge, which explains the Maxwellians&#x27; use of the term &quot;displacement&quot;.

Since elastance is defined as the ratio of voltage to charge, its analogue in other energy domains is the ratio of a generalized force to a generalized displacement. Therefore, elastance can be defined in any energy domain. The term &quot;elastance&quot; is used in the formal analysis of systems involving multiple energy domains, such as in bond graphs.

===Other analogies===
Maxwell&#x27;s analogy is not the only method for constructing analogies between mechanical and electrical systems. There are multiple ways to create such analogies. One commonly used system is the mobility analogy. In this analogy, force is mapped to current rather than voltage. As a result, electrical impedance no longer corresponds directly to mechanical impedance, and similarly, electrical elastance no longer corresponds to mechanical elastance.

<text>Gordon Rennie is a Scottish comics writer, responsible for &quot;White Trash: Moronic Inferno&quot;, as well as several comic strips for &quot;2000 AD&quot; and novels for &quot;Warhammer Fantasy&quot;.

In May 2008, he announced he was leaving comics to concentrate full-time on video games which &quot;are more fun, pay better and have a brighter future&quot;. However, he has since written several new series for &quot;2000 AD&quot;, Titan and others.

==Biography==

His first work was published in &quot;Blast!&quot; magazine in 1991, a metafictional Sherlock Holmes story called &quot;Sherlock Holmes in the Curious Case of the Vanishing Villain&quot;, painted by Woodrow Phoenix. It also had appearances by characters from other Victorian fiction including Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and characters from stories by Edgar Allan Poe.

He included a completely different &quot;White Trash&quot; in the same issue - a satirical journey through the USA, drawn by the New Zealand artist Martin Emond. Both these stories were later collected into one-shot graphic novels and published by Tundra Publishing. Two further planned collaborations with Phoenix, a one-shot graphic novel called &quot;Orson Welles: Special Agent!&quot; and &quot;Necronauts&quot;, later completed with Frazer Irving, were halted when Tundra Press ceased publishing in 1993.

Rennie&#x27;s first major series for the 2000 AD family was &quot;Missionary Man&quot;, which began in &quot;Judge Dredd Megazine&quot; vol.2 #29 (5/93) and ran between the latter and &quot;2000 AD&quot; for 74 episodes before finishing in 2002. Other original series include &quot;Witch World&quot; (1997) and &quot;Rain Dogs&quot; (2000). He also took over the exploits of the Judge Dredd villain Mean Machine (2000–2001), as well as the return of the original &quot;Rogue Trooper&quot; (2002–2004).

His works for &quot;2000 AD&quot; include the miniseries &quot;Necronauts&quot; (2000–2001), in which Harry Houdini, Arthur Conan Doyle, Charles Fort and H. P. Lovecraft team up to defeat an alien menace that seeks to destroy the human race. This was followed up by the series &quot;Caballistics, Inc.&quot;, a story about a recently privatized team of occult researchers, which included a combination of pop-cultural references and labyrinthine conspiracies.

By 2004, Rennie had become a writer on the Judge Dredd strip, following up a number of subplots initiated by its principal author, John Wagner, as well as developing his own situations and guest characters, some of whom have spun off into stories of their own. While the lengthier Judge Dredd adventures are typically scripted by Wagner, Rennie was awarded one in 2005. This story, &quot;Blood Trails&quot;, ran for ten episodes beginning in &quot;2000 AD&quot; prog 1440 (5/25/05).

His contribution to the series of novels expanding miniature wargaming platforms &quot;Warhammer Fantasy&quot;, &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot; and &quot;Battlefleet Gothic&quot; include &quot;Zavant&quot;, &quot;Ulli and Marquand&quot;, the Kal Jerico stories, &quot;Bloodquest&quot;, &quot;Execution Hour&quot; and &quot;Shadow Point&quot;.

Rennie has worked on computer games and was nominated for the 2006 BAFTA for his script on the Rogue Trooper game as well as a nomination for the 2012 Writers&#x27; Guild of Great Britain&#x27;s Best Videogame Script award along with co-scriptwriters Alan Barnes and Emma Beeby.

In May 2008, he was quoted as saying ,&quot;I got fed up with comics and quit last month to concentrate on games.&quot; Although he later said he was misquoted, and that he has not completely given up comics, as he would still be writing an ongoing series for &quot;2000 AD&quot;. At that time, Rennie was also planning a novel on the Romans in Scotland. He has since returned to &quot;2000 AD&quot; to write the serials &quot;Aquila&quot;, &quot;Jaegir&quot; and &quot;Survival Geeks&quot;.

He also co-wrote &quot;The Doomsday Quatrain&quot; and sections of &quot;1001 Nights&quot; with Emma Beeby for Big Finish Productions&#x27; &quot;Doctor Who&quot; main range of audio plays.

He is known for maintaining close links with the fan community, for example by contributing to small press comics such as &quot;Solar Wind&quot;, despite a public persona he describes as &quot;a grumpy Scottish &quot;.

<text>Tremolite is a member of the amphibole group of silicate minerals with composition Ca2(Mg5.0-4.5Fe2+0.0-0.5)Si8O22(OH)2. Tremolite forms by metamorphism of sediments rich in dolomite and quartz, and occurs in two distinct forms, crystals and fibers. Tremolite forms a series with actinolite and ferro-actinolite. Pure magnesium tremolite is creamy white, but the color grades to dark green with increasing iron content. It has a hardness on Mohs scale of 5 to 6. Nephrite, one of the two minerals known as the gemstone jade, is a green crystalline variety of tremolite.

The fibrous form of tremolite is one of the six recognised types of asbestos. This material is toxic, and inhaling the fibers can lead to asbestosis, lung cancer and both pleural and peritoneal mesothelioma. Fibrous tremolite is sometimes found as a contaminant in vermiculite, chrysotile (itself a type of asbestos) and talc.

==Occurrence==
Tremolite is an indicator of metamorphic grade since at high temperatures it converts to diopside.

Tremolite occurs as a result of contact metamorphism of calcium and magnesium rich siliceous sedimentary rocks and in greenschist facies metamorphic rocks derived from ultramafic or magnesium carbonate bearing rocks. Associated minerals include calcite, dolomite, grossular, wollastonite, talc, diopside, forsterite, cummingtonite, riebeckite and winchite.

Tremolite was first described in 1789 for an occurrence in Campolungo, Piumogna Valley, Leventina, Ticino (Tessin), Switzerland.

== Fibrous tremolite ==
One of the six recognized types of asbestos, approximately 40,200 tons of tremolite asbestos is mined annually in India. It is otherwise found as a contaminant.

<doc id="1023400" wikidata="Q271932" url="?curid=1023400" title="Helen Parkhurst">
<text>Helen Parkhurst (March 8, 1886 – June 1, 1973) was an American educator, author, lecturer, the originator of the Dalton Plan, founder of the Dalton School and host of &quot;Child&#x27;s World with Helen Parkhurst&quot; on ABC Television Network. Parkhurst took her cues from developmental psychologist Jean Piaget and education reformers such as John Dewey and Horace Mann, producing a progressive education philosophy emphasizing the development of the &quot;whole child&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Born in Durand, Wisconsin, she graduated from Wisconsin State Teachers College at River Falls in 1907, studied at the universities of Rome and Munich as well as with Maria Montessori and was awarded her M.A. in 1943 from Yale University. She taught briefly in Wisconsin, moved to Tacoma, Washington, in 1909, and returned to Wisconsin as the director of the department for the training of primary teachers at Stevens Point Normal School from 1913 until 1915. For a time, Parkhurst served as director of all Montessori schools in the United States.

==Career==
In 1920 she gained a disciple when college founder Belle Rennie visited from the UK. Rennie became an evangelist for the approach and she created the &quot;Dalton Association&quot; in Britain.

After further work with Montessori in Rome, Parkhurst wrote several books like &quot;Education on the Dalton Plan&quot; (1922), &quot;Work Rhythms in Education&quot; (1935), &quot;Exploring the Child&#x27;s World&quot; (1951), &quot;Growing Pains&quot; (1962) and &quot;Undertow&quot; (1963) and had her own national radio and television programs. Parkhurst hosted &quot;Child&#x27;s World&quot;, a children&#x27;s educational program on ABC Radio Network in New York City. In 1932 Belle Rennie published &quot;The Triumph of the Dalton Plan&quot; with the British educational psychologist Charles William Kimmins. 

Parkhurst was a 1948 recipient of a Radio - Television Critics Award and a 1949 recipient of the 13th American Exhibition of Educational Radio Programs Award.

Parkhurst was the author of &quot;Education on the Dalton Plan&quot;, which was published in 58 languages; &quot;Exploring the Child&#x27;s World&quot;, with an introduction by Aldous Huxley, and &quot;Growing Pains&quot;, a book about teenagers. Parkhurst was named one of the 100 Educators of All Time. Parkhurst was decorated by the Queen of Italy, Empress of Japan, and Queen of the Netherlands. Maria Montessori best summarized Parkhurst&#x27;s career by stating, &quot;Her intelligent activity is truly rare and precious.&quot; Eleanor Roosevelt greatly admired Parkhurst&#x27;s work and played a significant role in expanding the population and resources of her school.

==Legacy==
Parkhurst&#x27;s influence has spread across the globe, with schools in the Netherlands, England, Australia, Japan and others adopting the Dalton Plan of education. The Helen Parkhurst Exhibit at the Pepin County Museum traces the life and legacy of Parkhurst. There is a &quot;Helen Parkhurst Dalton School&quot; in Rotterdam and a Parkhurst Lecture Hall at UW-Stevens Point.

<doc id="1023439" wikidata="Q715175" url="?curid=1023439" title="Vanity (singer)">
<text>Denise Katherine Matthews (January 4, 1959 – February 15, 2016), known professionally as Vanity, was a Canadian singer, model, and actress. Known for her image as a sex symbol in the 1980s, she became an evangelist and renounced her career as Vanity in the 1990s.

Vanity was the lead singer of the female trio Vanity 6, which was created by the musician Prince. Known for their 1982 hit song &quot;Nasty Girl&quot;, they disbanded in 1983, when she decided to embark on a solo career. Vanity released two solo albums on the Motown Records label, &quot;Wild Animal&quot; and &quot;Skin on Skin&quot;. She had minor hit singles with &quot;Pretty Mess&quot;, &quot;Mechanical Emotion&quot;, &quot;Under the Influence&quot;, and &quot;Undress&quot; from the 1988 film &quot;Action Jackson&quot;. Vanity also had a successful career as an actress, starring in the films &quot;The Last Dragon&quot; (1985), and &quot;52 Pick-Up&quot; (1986), and &quot;Action Jackson&quot;.

After years of drug abuse, which caused health issues, Matthews became a born-again Christian in 1992. She later devoted herself to her church in Fremont, California. Matthews died on February 15, 2016, at age 57, due to kidney failure.

== Early life ==
Denise Katherine Matthews was born in Niagara Falls, Ontario, on January 4, 1959, the daughter of Helga Senyk and Levia James Matthews. Her mother was of Polish-Jewish descent, and her father was African-American. Matthews had three sisters, Patricia, Deborah, Renay and several half siblings.

Her father died when she was 15 years old. Matthews revealed to &quot;Jet&quot; in 1993 that her father physically and verbally abused her for years. The abuse caused her to have a negative self-image. &quot;For 15 years, he beat me badly... I wish I could see my father in heaven, but I won&#x27;t. He&#x27;s in hell,&quot; she said.

== Career ==

=== Early career: 1977–1981 ===
Matthews began entering local beauty pageants before moving to Toronto, where she modeled. She won the Miss Niagara Hospitality title in 1977 and went on to compete for Miss Canada in 1978. At age 17, she moved to New York City to further her career. She signed with Zoli Model Agency. However, because she was short in stature, her modeling career was limited to commercials and photoshoots and excluded runway work. Vanity appeared in commercials for Pearl Drops toothpaste before completing a modeling stint in Japan. She also appeared on the cover for Nightlife Unlimited&#x27;s 1980 album &quot;Let&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Do&quot; &quot;It&quot; &quot;Again&quot;.

Matthews had a small role in the horror movie &quot;Terror Train&quot; (1980), which was filmed in Montreal in 1979. She then went to Toronto to film the lead role in the 1980 B-movie &quot;Tanya&#x27;s Island&quot;. She was credited as D.D. Winters for both films.

=== Music and acting career: 1982–1993 ===
Matthews appeared on the cover of the funk band Cameo&#x27;s album cover, &quot;Alligator Woman&quot;, released in March 1982. She had met musician Prince at the American Music Awards earlier that year. After learning that she could sing, Prince later invited her to front a girl group he had formed called The Hookers. Prince initially wanted to name her &quot;Vagina,&quot; pronounced &quot;va-geen-na,&quot; which Matthews refused. They instead settled on Vanity, as he considered her to be the female form of himself. The group was renamed Vanity 6.

The group recorded one album, and had some success internationally with the single &quot;Nasty Girl&quot;. They wore lingerie and Vanity&#x27;s image became that of an erotic and sexy &quot;nasty girl&quot;. She later stated in a 1993 interview that she was uncomfortable with the image she was given, saying &quot;Prince created the whole Vanity 6 image. It bothered me at the time. I lied and said it was the image I wanted. I did it because he told me I had to do it. If I didn&#x27;t do it, I wouldn&#x27;t get paid. I got into it. I wanted the old Diana Ross image.&quot;

Vanity and Prince appeared on the cover of the April 28, 1983, issue of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine. In August 1983, she abruptly left the group and turned down a role in the 1984 film &quot;Purple Rain&quot;, which went to her replacement, Apollonia Kotero. In 1984, Vanity signed with Motown Records as a solo artist and recorded the funk-pop album &quot;Wild Animal&quot;. She had mild success on the US pop and R&amp;B charts with the singles &quot;Pretty Mess&quot; and &quot;Mechanical Emotion.&quot;

In 1985, Vanity made her mainstream film debut in &quot;The Last Dragon&quot;, which featured her song, &quot;7th Heaven.&quot; She wanted a role in the 1985 film &quot;The Color Purple&quot;, but Steven Spielberg thought she looked too young. In 1986, she released her second and last album, &quot;Skin on Skin&quot;, which produced the top 10 R&amp;B hit &quot;Under the Influence&quot;. That year, she also starred in the action film &quot;Never Too Young to Die&quot; opposite John Stamos and the Neo-noir crime film &quot;52 Pick-Up&quot;.

In 1987, Vanity guest-starred in an episode of &quot;Miami Vice&quot;″s third season. She went on to co-star in the 1988 film &quot;Action Jackson&quot;, her highest profile role, in which she starred opposite Carl Weathers, Craig T. Nelson, and Sharon Stone. Roger Ebert of &quot;The Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave a negative review to &quot;Action Jackson&quot;, but praised Vanity&#x27;s performance as &quot;the movie’s one redeeming merit&quot;. She also appeared nude in the April 1988 issue of &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine.

Vanity had a role on numerous TV programs. She appeared in &quot;Friday the 13th: The Series&quot; in the episode entitled &quot;Mesmer&#x27;s Bauble&quot; in 1989. She played a villain who tortured Nancy Allen&#x27;s character in the 1990 TV movie &quot;Memories of Murder&quot; and appeared in an episode of &quot;&quot; in 1992. Her last role was in the film &quot;Kiss of Death&quot; in 1993.

==Personal life==

=== Relationships ===
Matthews attended the American Music Awards where she met Prince in January 1982; they then began dating shortly after. She was also linked romantically to Adam Ant, who wrote the track &quot;Vanity&quot; about her on his 1983 &quot;Strip&quot; album, and Billy Idol.

During an appearance on &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot; in 1987, Matthews announced that she and Mötley Crüe bassist Nikki Sixx were engaged. She often joked that she would become Vanity 6 (Sixx) again. In his memoir, &quot;The Heroin Diaries: A Year in the Life of a Shattered Rock Star&quot;, Sixx detailed their volatile relationship and drug use. He stated that Vanity taught him how to freebase cocaine.

On her first anniversary of sobriety, Matthews married football player Anthony Smith of the Oakland Raiders in 1995. While working as an evangelist in San Jose, she read about Smith&#x27;s philanthropic activities in Los Angeles. &quot;The Lord told me that I would go down to L.A. and minister to him,&quot; she told &quot;Ebony&quot;. They met in late February 1995, and three days later, she proposed to him. After a one-month whirlwind romance, they married at Smith&#x27;s home in Playa del Rey in April. Smith later revealed that they often argued about her kind nature, which caused her to habitually invite homeless people into their home for food and showers and give out their home number to complete strangers. Due to his volatility, their marriage ended in 1996. After they separated, Smith was arrested for domestic violence involving another woman and was later convicted of three murders.

===Religion===
In 1992, Matthews met actor Sam J. Jones during the filming of &quot;Da Vinci&#x27;s War&quot;. Jones invited Matthews to read the Bible with him during a lunch break. Shortly thereafter, Matthews became a born-again Christian, and in several interviews, she stated that she would not play any more sexualized roles. Simultaneously, she renounced her stage name Vanity and reverted to Denise Matthews. She traveled extensively throughout the South with her friend/agent Benjamin Jimerson-Phillips, giving her testimony of conversion to Christianity.

In 1994, Matthews was hospitalized for three months for near-fatal kidney failure from a drug overdose. She recalled later that after being rushed to the hospital, doctors said she had three days to live while on life support. It was Jimerson-Phillips, who then sent Western Union telegrams to Prince, notifying him of her condition. She explained that Jesus appeared to her at this time and spoke to her, saying that if she promised to abandon her Vanity persona, he would save her.

Upon her recovery, Matthews ended her performing career by cutting off all ties with Hollywood and shunning her former life in show business. She devoted herself to being a born-again Christian. In 1995, she said, &quot;When I came to the Lord Jesus Christ, I threw out about 1,000 tapes of mine— every interview, every tape, every video, everything.&quot; Jimerson-Phillips stated: &quot;I was there at her apartment at The Grand in Sherman Oaks, when she just started dumping things down the incinerator. I grabbed some of the items including a painting titled Tailspin, by famed artist Olivia; a cassette hand painted by Prince of unreleased music; and an assortment of other items I didn&#x27;t want to see go into the trash. I even had to go down to the office and ask them to retrieve her gold album she had thrown away.&quot;

After a kidney transplant in 1997, Matthews dedicated the rest of her life full-time to Christ. She made speaking engagements at churches worldwide and she headed Pure Hearts Ministries in Fremont, California.

In 2010, Matthews released her autobiography, &quot;Blame It On Vanity: Hollywood, Hell and Heaven&quot;.

==Illness and death==
Due to kidney problems resulting from her decade-long cocaine addiction, Matthews had to undergo 20 minutes of peritoneal dialysis five times a day. She underwent a kidney transplant in 1997, but her health worsened in 2015 after she was diagnosed with sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis.

Matthews died in a Fremont, California, hospital on February 15, 2016, from kidney failure, aged 57. She left much of her estate to her church. After cremation, her ashes were scattered off the coast of Hawaii.

<doc id="1023468" wikidata="Q727306" url="?curid=1023468" title="Chabazite">
<text>Chabazite () is a tectosilicate mineral series in the zeolite group, closely related to gmelinite, with the chemical formula , where &quot;M&quot; is one or more metal cations. Recognized minerals in the series include Chabazite-Ca, Chabazite-K, Chabazite-Na, and Chabazite-Sr, depending on the prominence of the indicated cation.

Chabazite crystallizes in the triclinic crystal system with typically rhombohedral shaped crystals that are pseudo-cubic. The crystals are typically twinned, and both contact twinning and penetration twinning may be observed. They may be colorless, white, orange, brown, pink, green, or yellow. The hardness ranges from 3 to 5 and the specific gravity from 2.0 to 2.2. The luster is vitreous.

It was named chabasie in 1792 by Bosc d&#x27;Antic and later changed to the current spelling.

Chabazite occurs most commonly in voids and amygdules in basaltic rocks.

Chabazite is found in India, Iceland, the Faroe Islands, the Giants Causeway in Northern Ireland, Bohemia, Italy, Germany, along the Bay of Fundy in Nova Scotia, Oregon, Arizona, and New Jersey.

== Synthetic chabazite ==
Many different materials that are isostructural with the chabazite mineral have been synthesized in laboratories. SSZ-13 is a CHA type zeolite with an Si/Al ratio of 14. This is a composition not found in nature.

<text>The Edgerton Highway is a minor highway in the U.S. state of Alaska that extends from the Richardson Highway near Copper Center to the town of Chitina. The [[McCarthy Road]], within the Wrangell-Saint Elias National Park and Preserve, is a extension from Chitina to McCarthy.

The Edgerton Highway, named for U.S. Army Major General Glen Edgar Edgerton, a member of the Alaska Road Commission, follows an old pack trail along the Copper River, and is paved. The popular dip-net salmon fishery in Chitina causes the highway to be fairly heavily used in summer. It is part of Alaska Route 10.

==Route description==
The Edgerton Highway begins at its junction with the Richardson Highway at Pippin Lake in the rural community of Kenny Lake. The highway travels east-northeast through rural Kenny Lake before reaching an intersection with the Old Edgerton Highway and turning southeast. The highway continues through several miles of forest along the Copper River, crossing several small affluents. The roadway passes the Chitina Airport, ending at its junction with the McCarthy Road after passing through the very small town of Chitina.

==Recreation site==

Liberty Falls State Recreation Site is located at mile 23 of the highway. It is one of the smaller units of the Alaska State Parks system, at only . The site features a small campground and picnic area and, as the name suggests, a close-up view of a waterfall and the canyon created by Liberty Creek as it runs down to the Copper River.

<doc id="1023477" wikidata="Q7504160" url="?curid=1023477" title="Shrinky Dinks">
<text>Shrink art, Shrinky Dinks, or Shrinkles is a toy and activity kit consisting of sheets of polystyrene which can be cut with standard household scissors. When heated, the cut shapes become about nine times thicker while their horizontal and vertical dimensions reduce to about one-third the original size, resulting in hard, flat forms which retain their initial color and shape. They reached the height of their popularity in the 1980s and are still available from retailers. They can be used for a variety of things like charms and pins. Most sets are pre-printed with outline images of popular children&#x27;s characters or other subjects, which are then colored in before baking.

== History ==
Shrinky Dinks were invented in 1973 by Betty Morris and Kate Bloomberg, two housewives in Brookfield, Wisconsin, as a Cub Scout project with their sons. The first kits were sold at a local shopping mall and became very popular. Shrinky Dinks were soon licensed to be manufactured by the major toy companies of the time such as Milton Bradley, Colorforms, Western Publishing and Skyline Toys.

Alex Brands acquired Shrinky Dinks in 2014. As of 2020, the original brand &quot;Shrinky Dinks&quot; is owned by Just Play Products.

== Usage ==
The base material consists of thin, flexible polystyrene plastic (#6) sheets. Prior to heating, the plastic sheets can be colored with felt-tip pens, acrylic paint, colored pencils, etc. and cut into shapes. However, oily or waxy substances (such as cheap colored pencils, crayons or oil paint) are not suitable because they melt or burn in high heat. When heated with the Easy-Bake Oven, a conventional oven, or a heat gun, the plastic s and becomes thicker and more rigid, while retaining the colored design.

Although Shrinky Dinks are primarily an arts and crafts product marketed for children, adult crafters and artists also use the product for jewelry making and other projects. Blank sheets are available in bulk for this purpose.

== Applications ==

In 2008, University of California, Irvine Professor Michelle Khine applied Shrinky Dinks to create tiny structures for the application of microfluidics to topics such as stem cell research. In 2022, Michelle Khine researched the use of Shrinky Dinks for microscale diagnostics and wearable biosensors for monitoring health.

In 2009, an art therapy supervision class at Emporia State University explored the use of Shrinky Dinks in art therapy. In 2014, Shrinky Dinks were presented as an art therapy medium in a workshop at the American Art Therapy Association Conference.

In 2014, a team from Harvard University and MIT used Shrinky Dinks to create self-assembling robots.

== In popular culture ==

In 1992, the California rock band Sugar Ray formed with the name &quot;Shrinky Dinx&quot;, but later changed it upon threat of lawsuit from the Milton Bradley Company.

<text>WDDX (Web Distributed Data eXchange) is a programming language-, platform- and transport-neutral data interchange mechanism designed to pass data between different environments and different computers.

==History==
WDDX was created by Simeon Simeonov of Allaire Corporation in 1998, initially for the ColdFusion server environment. 
WDDX was open-sourced later that year. 

==Usage==
WDDX is functionally comparable to XML-RPC and WIDL. The specification supports simple data types such as number, string, boolean, etc., and complex aggregates of these in forms such as structures, arrays and recordsets (row/column data, typically coming from database queries).

The data is encoded into XML using an XML 1.0 DTD, producing a platform-independent but relatively bulky representation. The XML-encoded data can then be sent to another computer using HTTP, FTP, or other transmission mechanism. The receiving computer must have WDDX-aware software to translate the encoded data into the receiver&#x27;s native data representation. WDDX can also be used to serialize data structures to storage (file system or database). Many applications use WDDX to pass complex data to browsers where it can be manipulated with JavaScript, as an alternative to JSON.

Example from php.net:

&lt;wddxPacket version=&#x27;1.0&#x27;&gt;
 &lt;header comment=&#x27;PHP&#x27;/&gt;
 &lt;data&gt;
 &lt;struct&gt;
 &lt;var name=&#x27;pi&#x27;&gt;
 &lt;number&gt;3.1415926&lt;/number&gt;
 &lt;/var&gt;
 &lt;var name=&#x27;cities&#x27;&gt;
 &lt;array length=&#x27;3&#x27;&gt;
 &lt;string&gt;Austin&lt;/string&gt;
 &lt;string&gt;Novato&lt;/string&gt;
 &lt;string&gt;Seattle&lt;/string&gt;
 &lt;/array&gt;
 &lt;/var&gt;
 &lt;/struct&gt;
 &lt;/data&gt;
&lt;/wddxPacket&gt;

==Adoption==
WDDX is mainly used by ColdFusion and, as February 2022, still supported by Adobe.

Outside ColdFusion, libraries exist to read or write this format, Ruby, Python, PHP, Java, C++, .NET, Actionscript, lisp, Haskell, Perl.

PHP used to offer a comprehensive support for WDDX, which could be used as a format to store session information until the version 7.4. It has been removed since from the base language, but still available through PECL. The rationale was a lack of standardization of the format, and new formats like JSON more mainstream. A vulnerability was fixed in 2007.

<text>Izz El-Deen Sobhi Sheikh Khalil (alternately Ezzeddine) () (&quot;circa&quot; 1962/1964 – September 26, 2004) was a senior member of the military wing of the Palestinian Islamist organization Hamas when he was killed by setting an automobile booby trap on 26 September 2004, in the al-Zahera district of southern Damascus, Syria. He was from the Shajaiyeh district of Gaza City. Although no specific groups have taken responsibility for his assassination, it is consistent in style with previous Israeli-sponsored assassinations, and with Israeli pledges to assassinate Hamas leaders. 

The white Mitsubishi Pajero SUV he had just started was utterly demolished and burst into flames, charring the body almost beyond recognition. Pieces were assembled and scraped off the back seat to be carted to a nearby hospital for identification. Another car windshield and nearby ground-floor and second-story windows were shattered by the blast, and three Syrian civilians were injured.

Israeli military had said that two bus bombings that killed 16 civilians in the southern Israeli city of Beersheba on August 31 would be answered with a renewed assassination campaign against Hamas leaders.

Khalil was exiled from the Palestinian territories in 1992, one among a group of some 400 Palestinian militants who were deported to Lebanon in the early 1990s. He based himself in Damascus with other senior Hamas leaders, which was safer than the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

Khalil&#x27;s name was rendered Izz al-Din al-Sheikh Khalil by CNN, Izz Eldine Subhi Sheik Khalil by Fox News, Izz El-Deen Sheikh Khalil by the BBC, and Izz al-Din al-Shaikh Khalil by Al Jazeera. His first name is the same as Izz ad-Din al-Qassam, the namesake of the Qassam Brigades who spell it &quot;Ezzedeen&quot;.

<text>Franklinite is an oxide mineral belonging to the normal spinel subgroup&#x27;s iron (Fe) series, with the formula Zn2+Fe23+O4. 

As with another spinel member magnetite, both ferrous (2+) and ferric (3+) iron may be present in franklinite samples. Divalent iron and/or manganese (Mn) may commonly accompany zinc (Zn) and trivalent manganese may substitute for some ferric iron.

At its type locality, franklinite can be found with a wide array of minerals, many of which are fluorescent. More commonly, it occurs with willemite, calcite, and zincite. In these rocks, it forms as disseminated small black crystals with their octahedral faces visible at times. It may rarely be found as a single large euhedral crystal.

Franklinite is a major ore of the element zinc. It is named after its local discovery at the Franklin Mine and Sterling Hill Mines in New Jersey.

In 2023, Franklinite was designated the state mineral of New Jersey.

<doc id="1023525" wikidata="Q3090598" url="?curid=1023525" title="Box orbit">
<text>In stellar dynamics, a box orbit refers to a particular type of orbit that can be seen in triaxial systems, i.e. systems that do not possess a symmetry around any of its axes. They contrast with the loop orbits that are observed in spherically symmetric or axisymmetric systems.

In a box orbit, a star oscillates independently along the three different axes as it moves through the system. As a result of this motion, it fills in a (roughly) box-shaped region of space. Unlike loop orbits, the stars on box orbits can come arbitrarily close to the center of the system. As a special case, if the frequencies of oscillation in different directions are commensurate, the orbit will lie on a one- or two-dimensional manifold and can avoid the center. Such orbits are sometimes called &quot;boxlets&quot;.
