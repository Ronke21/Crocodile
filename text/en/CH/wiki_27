<text>Halstead is a town and civil parish in the Braintree District of Essex, England. Its population of 11,906 in 2011 was estimated to be 12,161 in 2019. The town lies near Colchester and Sudbury, in the Colne Valley. It is twinned with Haubourdin in the Nord department of France.

==History==
Halstead is an ancient community that developed initially on the hill to the north of the River Colne. Archaeological evidence indicates that Halstead has been occupied since the early Bronze Age. The sites of Iron Age and Roman settlements, including a villa, were discovered in the vicinity of Greenstead Hall, where Saxon pottery was also found. A Romano-British villa also lies in a field to the south of the River Colne at Blue Bridge, indicating early settlement in the fertile river valley. The name Halstead derives from the Old English &quot;gehæld / hald&quot; (refuge, shelter, healthy) and &quot;stede&quot; (site, place or farm), meaning &quot;healthy farm&quot; or &quot;place of refuge&quot;. After the Norman Conquest, in the Middle English of the 11th century, hald was written and spoken as halt, holt, or holð. Halstead is recorded in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; of 1086 as &quot;Haltesteda&quot; and thrice as &quot;Halsteda&quot; in the Hundred of Hinckford, where it was mainly held by many freemen as feu in 1066, at the time of King Edward. In 1086, Halstead was one of the largest 20% of settlements recorded in Domesday, and had four owners. Most of the manor of Halstead had been granted by King William to William de Warenne as tenant-in-chief and lord of most of its wealth, and about one-third of the manor of Halstead was possessed by Richard, son of count Gilbert as tenant-in-chief.

In the Rebellion of 1088, William de Warenne took the winning side of William Rufus and was named Earl of Surrey, while Richard supported Robert Curthose which led to retirement at a monastery and transfer of his portion of Halstead to his son Gilbert fitz Richard.

There was evidence of a market in Halstead before 1251 when a royal charter was granted for a weekly market and an annual fair. Further grants were made in 1330 and 1467 for the market which was then held in Chipping Hill. St Andrew&#x27;s Church was in existence by 1276 and the town developed around the Church and nearby market.

In about 1413 Holy Trinity Chapel was erected near the junction of the present Chapel Hill with Trinity Street and Mount Hill. This chapel disappeared by the 18th century and during 1843 it was replaced by Holy Trinity Church, a Gothic Revival building.

==Area==
The wide High Street is dominated by the 14th-century Church of St Andrew, which was extensively renovated in the Victorian period, but retains much older decoration, including tomb monuments from the 14th century and earlier.

The historic core of Halstead can be viewed on a walk up the market hill. Several buildings on the Market Hill contain structures that date from the 14th century including Whispers wine bar which was an oratory with six priests. It contains a fine wooden hammer-beam ceiling with carved angel newel-post. There is a river walk running through the town from east to west. Just outside the town is Broaks Wood, a popular area for walking owned by the Forestry Commission. Halstead Public Gardens were established in 1900 and are noted for their floral displays. The town has secured both Silver and Gold Awards in the annual Britain in Bloom competition on multiple occasions since 2000 and these displays have drawn many tourists to the town. The Antiques Centre inside Townsford Mill sells goods ranging from clothing to household items.

==Mills==
Townsford Mill spans the river at the bottom of the town houses. In 1818, Samuel Courtauld built two mills, Townsford at Halstead and another at Bocking. At the end of 1824, Halstead Mill was sold to Stephen Beuzeville. In 1825, Samuel installed a steam engine at Bocking Mill. An agreement dated 19 January 1825 was drawn up between Beuzeville and Samuel Courtauld and partners for the conversion of Halstead Mill for silk throwing. 

Beuzeville was to provide the expertise, capital and silk; Courtauld was to erect the power looms and operate the mill in return for a share in the profits; Beuzeville was to take delivery of the yarn and manufacture the crêpe, on which he was a technical expert with 20 years&#x27; experience. The mill appears to have been in operation by the summer of 1825, with Joseph Ash as manager.

The introduction of new technology was important, but the mills remained heavily dependent on labour, much of which was provided by Belgian refugees emigrating to avoid religious persecution.. The looms required supervision by an army of young female workers. Even in 1838, more than 92 per cent of the workforce was female.

In 1827 Stephen Beuzeville was declared bankrupt; a formal deed of sale dated 11 April 1828 was created between the commissioners in bankruptcy and Samuel Courtauld, whereby Halstead Mill (subject to charges of £300) was sold to Courtaulds for a cash payment of £1,500. Stephen and his father joined Courtaulds as employees.

On the death of Queen Victoria in 1902, much of the black crepe for her funeral cortege was made at Townsford Mill by Samuel Courtauld&#x27;s company. 

Parts of the original Courtauld factory are listed buildings and survived the wholesale demolition of the silk factory in the early 1980s. Principal amongst these is Factory Terrace - Victorian townhouses built for Courtauld&#x27;s managers which are Grade II* listed.

==Evans Electroselenium Ltd==
Arthur Evans was an industrialist, engineer and businessman who began manufacture of selenium photocells in a small workshop in Harlow, Essex, during the Second World War. These were of use in military applications and he was encouraged by the Government of National Unity to find larger premises and rapidly expand the business. He chose Halstead and found a site adjacent to St Andrews Church on Colchester Road. After the war, Evans Electroselenium Ltd (EEL) expanded into all types of scientific instruments which required photocells, including a flame photometer, colorimeters and atomic absorption instruments. Later, electrochemistry instruments were added. The business was eventually bought by Corning Inc and went through several mergers and acquisitions. Today it is part of Siemens Healthineers and operates only from the former Corning-EEL site in Sudbury, Suffolk. The Halstead site was redeveloped for housing as Evans Court in tribute to the founder. The Science Museum in London holds a collection of EEL scientific instruments. Others are held in the Halstead Town Museum collection.

==Amenities==
Halstead has a library in a large open-plan building, built in 1864–1866 as the corn exchange. It has also housed a technical school. Nearby Moyns Park, a Grade I listed Elizabethan country house, is where Ian Fleming put the finishing touches to his novel &quot;From Russia, with Love&quot;, according to the cover text of some recent editions.

The town history society holds regular monthly meetings. There is a town museum attached to the town council offices featuring historical artefacts and objects of local interest. The Colne Valley Postal History Museum is a privately run museum of British postal history with one of the largest collections of post office letter boxes and telephone kiosks and is situated on Head Street. It holds regular open days throughout the year. The redundant Trinity Church , which was designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott is used for occasional concerts and art exhibitions. The Empire Theatre in Butler Road hosts occasional bingo nights. Halstead is home to Hume&#x27;s Bakery, which opened in 1960 in the shop where it trades today.

The Jubilee Drinking Fountain was designed by the architect and architectural designer, Leonard Shuffrey. The stone drinking fountain was presented to the town by George Courtauld, and commemorates the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria.

<doc id="1017386" wikidata="Q1507736" url="?curid=1017386" title="Torp (architecture)">
<text>A  () is a type of cottage emblematic of the Swedish countryside. It comes from the Old Norse . In modern usage, it is the classic Swedish summer house, a small cottage painted in Falu red and white, and evidence of the way in which urbanization came quite late to all of Scandinavia. Its characteristic colour is ubiquitous in Sweden and became popular due to the paint&#x27;s affordability. In the meaning of &quot;simple second home&quot;, the concept exists under other names in Danish, Norwegian ( – but the term is also used in Norwegian) and Finnish ( or ).

The word is cognate with the English &quot;thorp&quot; (a secondary settlement or small group of houses in the countryside), which is found in many English placenames. Its meaning in Swedish has shifted over time. Before the 16th century, a &quot;torp&quot; was a separate farm, usually established by a farmer who had moved out from a village, and which often grew to become a village in its own right. In 16th-century Sweden, which at that time included Finland, a &quot;torp&quot; was the term for the smallest size of the farm, paying a quarter of a &quot;full&quot; farm&#x27;s taxes. When that classification became obsolete, a &quot;torp&quot; became a leased farm (with short lease times typically of one or two years), paid for with manual work on the owner&#x27;s fields.
Since the mid-20th century, most of the surviving &quot;torp&quot; cottages in Scandinavia have come to serve as summer homes for city dwellers. Before that, being brought up in a &quot;torp&quot; was a sign of relatively modest ancestry, with lower status than that of lifelong tenants—and very much lower than that of freeholding farmers, however small their farm—although &quot;torp&quot; dwellers were higher on the social scale than farmhands, maids and those who lived in paupers&#x27; cottages (&quot;backstugusittare&quot;).

In Danish and Norwegian, the common noun for an inhabitant of a torp is &quot;husmann/husmand&quot; – a man with a house. Such men owned their houses, but no land. In Swedish, the term &quot;husbonde&quot; remain in archaic form.

<doc id="1017399" wikidata="Q5470884" url="?curid=1017399" title="Fort Calgary">
<text>Fort Calgary was a North-West Mounted Police outpost at the confluence of the Bow and Elbow rivers in present-day Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Originally named Fort Brisebois, after the outpost&#x27;s first commander, the outpost was renamed Fort Calgary in June 1876.

The outpost was built in 1875 as a part of the North-West Mounted Police (NWMP) larger effort to curtail American rum and whisky runners in the region, and to establish relationships with the Indigenous peoples of the territory. The fort was expanded in 1882 after it was designated as a &quot;district post&quot;. The NWMP continued to use the fort until 1914 when the site was sold to Grand Trunk Pacific Railway. The fort was demolished to make way for a rail terminal, although the site&#x27;s significance was later recognized when it was named a National Historic Site in 1925.

In 1975, the municipal government of Calgary purchased a plot of land that included the National Historic Site and reopened it as Fort Calgary Historic Park in 1978. The historic park initially documented the NWMP role in the area, although its scope was expanded to focus on the Calgary&#x27;s history in 1995. Reconstruction of several former buildings within Fort Calgary took place in the 1990s. In 2024, the Fort Calgary Historic Park was rebranded as The Confluence Historic Site and Parkland.

==Background==
The confluence of the Bow and Elbow River, where the fort was built, is on the traditional territory of the Niitsitapi (Blackfoot Confederacy; Siksika, Kainai, Piikani), the îyârhe Nakoda (Chiniki, Bearspaw, Wesley), the Tsuut&#x27;ina people and Métis Nation, Region 3, and has been a significant age-old gathering place.

By the early 1870s, American whisky and rum runners were conducting trade with First Nations in the area. The illegal trade and American incursion prompted the government of Canada to create the North-West Mounted Police (NWMP) in 1873 to reassert Canadian sovereignty and curtail the whisky trade in the region. By 1874, the NWMP had captured or chased away most of the illegal traders, and had begun work on several forts in the area; believing that the lawlessness seen in the settlement of the American west was preventable if law enforcement was in place before settlers arrived into the area. After Fort Macleod was established, the whisky traders moved their operations further away from it. A decision was made to build an NWMP outpost at the midway point between Fort Macleod and Fort Edmonton in June 1875. &quot;F&quot; Troop, commanded by Éphrem-A. Brisebois, was tasked with establishing the outpost at the midway point.

==History==

The I. G. Baker Company arrived at the site in July 1875, having been hired to construct the NWMP outpost. The fort was initially planned to be located near present-day Holy Cross Centre, with an advanced troupe of &quot;F&quot; Troop marking a spot near the site. However, Brisebois elected to build the fort near the junction of the Bow and Elbow Rivers instead. Materials including spruce and pine were logged upstream and floated down to the site. The fort was originally bounded by a wooden palisade with several structures inside it; including a stables, barracks, guard room, and storage facilities. The fort was completed by December 1875, and cost the Canadian government C$2,476 to build. The outpost was initially known as the &quot;Bow River Fort&quot; until it was officially named &quot;Fort Brisebois&quot; in December 1875, after the commander of &quot;F&quot; Troop. However, Brisebois&#x27; superiors at NWMP headquarters had felt Brisebois misused his authority in naming the outpost and decided to rename the outpost &quot;Fort Calgary&quot; in June 1876. The name was recommended by James Macleod of the NWMP, who took the name from Calgary House in Scotland.

The outpost had inadequate heating and insulation after it was completed, resulting in poor living conditions for its garrison. Combined with Brisebois&#x27; poor leadership, the members of &quot;F&quot; Troop mutinied during the winter of 1875–76 and sent a delegation to the headquarters in Fort Macleod to list out complaints against the commander. Brisebois was not relieved immediately after that incident, although was eventually replaced by Lawrence Herchmer in August 1876.

The I. G. Baker Company incorporated the area around the fort as a part of its larger transportation network on the Whoop-Up Trail; and built a trading post and storehouse a few hundred metres away from the fort. The commercial opportunities provided by the transportation network also attracted the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, who relocated their trading post at the Ghost River to the Elbow River across from Fort Calgary. Initially, the outpost also housed a mission of the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate, although the mission later relocated upriver in 1875. By 1877, a permanent church was established at the I. G. Baker Company post. During the latter half of the 1870s, the area found itself as a stopover route for travellers going from Fort Benton, Montana to Fort Edmonton.

The decline in the illegal whisky and buffalo trade lessened the need for a fortified outpost in the area, resulting in the fort&#x27;s detachment to decline to four constables by 1880. However, the situation would reverse in the early 1880s, with several plans drafted to develop the area surrounding Fort Calgary. In August 1882, the outpost was designated as a &quot;district post,&quot; and its detachment was reinforced to provide a permanent police presence as well as enforce legal ordinances for the Canadian Pacific Railway reserve adjacent to the fort. James Walker, a former NWMP member and owner of the Bow River Saw and Planing Mill was contracted to expand the outpost. The contract called for the construction of a barracks, a guardroom with 12 holding cells, a hospital, officers&#x27; quarters, a sergeants&#x27; mess, and facilities for tradesmen. To accommodate the outpost&#x27;s expansion, the fort&#x27;s palisades were taken down, and several of the outpost&#x27;s older buildings were razed. The expansion cost the government approximately C$35,000.

From 1882 to 1902, a number of changes were made to the site, with buildings being torn down and built to address contemporary needs. Police operations at the fort ended in 1914, after Grand Trunk Pacific Railway bought the site for C$250,000. All the fort&#x27;s remaining buildings were demolished by Grand Truck Pacific Railway to make way for a rail terminal.

===Post-demolition history===
On 15 May 1925, the site where Fort Calgary stood was designated as a National Historic Site of Canada.

In 1975, the municipal government purchased the site, intending to develop it into a historic site. The city launched an archaeological study of the site to determine the exact location of the demolished fort. That year, archaeologists unearthed parts of the original wooden fort and its artifacts, although they were forced to quickly re-cover them due to their rapid and uncontrolled disintegration while exposed to open air. An interpretive centre was built on the site in 1977.

====Historic park====
The site was officially reopened as a historical museum, Fort Calgary Historic Park, in 1978. Initially, the museum&#x27;s exhibits were focused on the NWMP and their relationship with the First Nations, and the force&#x27;s perception in popular culture.

The museum&#x27;s operations were reoriented in 1995, changing the museum&#x27;s focus to one oriented towards the history of Calgary. Reconstructions of Fort Calgary&#x27;s stables and wagon shed were also erected during this period. In 2000, a replica of the NWMP&#x27;s two-storey barracks was completed on the site. After the final report from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada was released in 2015, the museum&#x27;s administration shifted its focus to better include indigenous perspectives of the site.

From 2014 to 2020, a three-phase expansion and restoration project of the historic site occurred, costing approximately C$36 million. The first stage includes restorations to Deane House and Hunt House, while the second phase saw the development of the &quot;F&quot; Troop memorial exhibit. The museum&#x27;s interpretive centre was renovated and expanded as a part of the final phase of the project. The expansion and renovations of the interpretive centre cost approximately C$10.4 million. 

On 2 May 2024 the Fort Calgary Historic Park was rebranded as The Confluence Historic Site and Parkland to better reflect the site&#x27;s history prior to the fort and to better reflect the location which the site is on.

==Grounds==

The Confluence Historic Site and Parkland is a historic site that sits on a grassy flood plain along the south shore of the Bow River, near the river junction with the Elbow river. However, the Fort Calgary National Historic Site of Canada designation is confined to a parcel of land surrounding the area where the fort originally stood, approximately in size.

The site contains several reconstructions of structures that were built within the fort, including the stables, wagon shed, and barracks modelled after the one built in 1888. The reconstructed buildings were completed during the 1990s and 2000. An interpretive centre was also erected on the site in 1977; with the size of the centre expanded to during the 2010s. Exhibits and audio-visual and interactive presentations of Calgary&#x27;s history and the NWMP are situated in the 1888 barracks and the interpretive centre.

In 2016, an art installation was unveiled at the site, with vertical wood slats topped with metal and placed on the outline of the original fort. The wood slats used for the installation is approximately the same height as the palisades used for Fort Calgary. From a certain angle, the wood slats are shaped to resemble 12 standing figures. The installation is illuminated with red lights during the night. The art installation is titled &quot;Marking&quot; and was created by Jill Anholt.

===Related landmarks===
Fort Calgary is also situated near two landmarks whose history is intertwined with the fort&#x27;s, the Deane House and Hunt House.

==== Deane House ====

The Deane House was built near Fort Calgary in 1906 for the superintendent of Fort Calgary, Captain Richard Burton Deane. He wrote about the house in his 1916 memoir &quot;Mounted Police Life in Canada&quot;. The house was originally constructed near 9th Ave and 6th St SE, facing east towards the barracks. Deane felt the previous superintendent&#x27;s house was not good enough for his wife Martha. Although the budget for the project was $5,000, the total cost was $6,200. In 1914, the Grand Trunk Railway bought the house and relocated to the southeast corner of the lot; serving as an office and station master&#x27;s house. The house was then purchased by C. L. Jacques in 1929 and moved across the Elbow River, where it stands today. It was used as a boarding house for several decades and was named Jasper Lodge. It was later purchased by Alex Brotherton who renamed the building Gaspé Lodge. Alex Brotherton died in the home in 1968 and the property was sold and proceeds divided among his children (Alfena Cunningham and Patrica Brotherton (Patricia Perkins), whose descendants still live in Calgary.

In 1973, the city bought the building and turned it into a cooperative studio space for artists and writers and an exhibition space called the Dandelion Gallery. In the summer of 1975, Joan Clark, Edna Alford and Velma Foster published the first edition of Dandelion Magazine, a publication that would become known as Alberta&#x27;s leading literary magazine. In 1978, the City closed the Dandelion Artists&#x27; Cooperative with plans to turn the house into a teahouse and restaurant. Today, the house continues to be owned by the city. It currently features a restaurant called Deane House and has undergone significant renovations as part of the MakeHistory upgrades to Fort Calgary.

==== Hunt House ====

The Hunt House is the oldest building in Calgary still located on its original site, 890 Ninth Avenue S.E. It was built between 1876 and 1881 for Métis employees of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company store located at 8th Street and 9th Avenue SE. The style of the original log building expresses a rare form of construction: unlike many H.B.C. buildings, the Hunt House did not employ post-on-sill construction, but rather the dovetail corner method typical of southern Alberta and expressive of American cultural influences.

The last person to live in the house was William Hunt, a rail worker, who died in the mid-1970s. It became an Alberta Provincial Historic Resource in 1977.

<doc id="1017407" wikidata="Q3307690" url="?curid=1017407" title="British Rail Class 175">
<text>The British Rail Class 175 Coradia 1000 is a type of diesel-hydraulic multiple unit (DHMU) passenger train from the Alstom Coradia 1000 family.

The fleet of 27 sets was ordered from the French train manufacturer Alstom during July 1997 and were constructed between 1999 and 2001 at Washwood Heath, Birmingham. Early plans for some of the fleet to be capable of were in place but subsequently abandoned. Driver training and extensive testing of the new fleet was performed at the Old Dalby Test Track from November 1999. The first Class 175 entered revenue service with the train operating company First North Western on 20 June 2000. Ownership of the fleet is held by Angel Trains, who has leased the fleet to various train operators. 

The first operator of the Class 175, North Western Trains (later known as &quot;First North Western&quot;), did not operate the fleet for long before Wales &amp; Borders was created and inherited it. During December 2003, the new franchisee Arriva Trains Wales took over the Class 175s, by which point early reliability problems had been mostly resolved. First TransPennine Express also briefly operated several. In February 2018, the entire Class 175 fleet was temporarily withdrawn from service for safety checks. During October 2018, the fleet was transferred to Transport for Wales Rail Services (KeolisAmey Wales), and then to the government-owned Transport for Wales Rail in February 2021.

==Background==
During July 1997, the train operating company North Western Trains placed an order reportedly valued at £64 million with the French train manufacturer GEC Alsthom (which in late 1998 would be rebranded as &quot;Alstom&quot;) for a total of 27 diesel multiple-units, comprising 11 two-carriage units with a top speed of , seven three-carriage units with a top speed of 100 mph, and nine three-carriage units with a top speed of . The specification called for the train to be a redesign of the Alstom Coradia Juniper family, with considerable emphasis placed on ride smoothness. Their introduction would enable the withdrawal of rolling stock dating back four decades by that point already. Manufacturing was undertaken at Alstom&#x27;s facility in Washwood Heath, Birmingham.

However, the company subsequently decided to reconfigure the order to instead cover 11 two-carriage and 16 three-carriage units, all of which possessed a maximum speed of 100 mph. In conjunction with the procurement of the new fleet, purpose-built facilities were established to service it at Chester TMD. This new depot was capable of refuelling, cleaning, washing, and performing general maintenance works for the whole Class 175 fleet.

The trains underwent low speed testing at the Severn Valley Railway prior to additional testing and driver training being conducted at the Old Dalby Test Track from November 1999. The first Class 175 entered revenue service on 20 June 2000.

==Description==
The Class 175 is a long distance diesel multiple-unit (DMU) that was built in either two-carriage or three-carriage configurations. The two-carriage units are numbered 175001–175011, while the three-carriage units 175101–175116. The individual carriages are labelled as coaches A–B–C, with the two-car units lacking a coach B. The interiors were built to a bespoke design specified by the initial operator, North Western Trains.

Various amenities are incorporated into the train. A relatively novel feature at the time was the presence of airline-style at-seat entertainment systems at some seats that enabled passengers with headphones to listen to radio and recorded audio tracks. Various noise-dampening measures were incorporated, such as a floating floor, acoustic ceiling panels, and high levels of insulation, to produce a relatively quiet interior; a low-noise air conditioning system was also fitted. The Class 175 is furnished with a passenger information system, consisting of onboard LED display and audio announcements that communicate both the destinations and arrivals. Each Class 175 has provisions to accommodate two disabled passengers in coach A, as well as for the storage for two bicycles in coach C.

The exterior of the Class 175 has been designed for improved aerodynamics over preceding rolling stock; it is equipped with a skirted underside and has been shaped to minimise exterior noise. Its launch operator stated that the train possessed both reduced drag and improved fuel efficiency over its existing rolling stock. The suspension system involved a dual air-and-spring arrangement that has been claimed to provide a smoother ride than the British Rail Class 465.

==Operations==

The Class 175 fleet was initially operated by First North Western (FNW), which placed them on routes serving Birmingham New Street, Crewe and Manchester to Llandudno, Holyhead, Barrow and Windermere. The type quickly displaced the elderly rolling stock that had been used on these routes, such as locomotive-hauled rakes of British Railways Mark 1 carriages. 

Early operations of the Class 175 were troubled by low unit availability on account of reliability problems; several services were substituted for by older locomotive-hauled trains at short notice. To address these issues, the fleet was subject to remedial work, which was largely centred around improvements to the performance of the brakes and bogies. These changes were reportedly successful, having resulted in the reliability of the trains improving substantially.

As part of a restructure of franchise areas, during October 2003, FNW&#x27;s services on the North Wales Coast Line from Birmingham and Manchester to Llandudno and Holyhead were transferred to the Wales &amp; Borders franchise. All 27 Class 175s were transferred to Wales &amp; Borders, who then sublet 11 to FNW. This arrangement was maintained following FNW&#x27;s Manchester to Barrow and Windermere services being transferred to First TransPennine Express (FTPE) in February 2004. After FTPE took delivery of Class 185 DMUs, this arrangement ceased during December 2006.
During December 2003, all of the Class 175s were transferred along with the Wales &amp; Borders franchise to the new franchisee Arriva Trains Wales. Their sphere of operations was promptly extended to South Wales via the Welsh Marches Line, serving destinations such as Cardiff, Swansea, Pembroke Dock, Fishguard and Milford Haven. In October 2018, the fleet passed with the franchise to Transport for Wales Rail Services; earlier that same year, the operator had announced its plans to replace the Class 175 with new-build Class 197 DMUs by 2023.

In 2019, a comprehensive refurbishment of the Class 175 fleet commenced. Performed at Alstom&#x27;s Widnes facility, this work saw various improved amenities being installed for passengers, such as re-covered seats, the addition of at-seat USB and electrical sockets, new carpets throughout, and various other new interior fittings; a new external livery was also applied. Refurbishment of the last unit was reportedly completed in January 2022. During February 2021, operation of the Class 175s was transferred along with the franchise to the Welsh Government-owned operator Transport for Wales Rail.

TfW Rail began to wind down its fleet of Class 175s in February 2023, with the placing into storage of 175002 and 175005. These units, along with three more (two of which had been damaged by fire in February 2023) were returned to lessor Angel Trains in May 2023. The last of the class were withdrawn by the end of 2023, being replaced by DMUs.

In August 2024, Rail Express reported that Great Western Railway were planning to lease the Class 175 fleet, and this was confirmed in November 2024 when the company formally signed the lease for the fleet. They are planned to enter service in 2025.

On 27 November 2024, Class 175 unit 175002 was the first unit to transfer to Great Western Railway.

===Accidents and incidents===
On 16 January 2010, unit 175103 operating the 08:30 service from to struck two cars at Moreton-on-Lugg crossing between Hereford and Leominster. The front seat passenger in one of the cars was fatally injured, although there were no casualties on the train. The train did not derail. The signaller had raised the barriers in error when the train was approaching the crossing, and he was arrested on suspicion of manslaughter in July 2010; he was convicted of charges under health and safety legislation following a trial at Birmingham Crown Court in 2013, and was fined £1,750 and ordered to carry out 275 hours of community service.

The same service collided with a trailer on the Morfa Main level crossing near Kidwelly on 31 January 2011. No-one was injured, but the unit involved, 175108, received nearly £82,000 worth of damage due to striking the trailer at . The farmer in charge of the trailer was sentenced to a 36-week suspended jail sentence and was ordered to carry out 200hours of community work.

On 19 December 2011, unit 175002 collided with a lorry at the Llanboidy level crossing near Whitland. The train was operating the service from Milford Haven to Manchester Piccadilly and the driver of the lorry was arrested on suspicion of endangering safety.

Class 175 units have caught fire in 2004 at (175008), 2009 at , 2011 at Manchester Piccadilly, 2017 both at Shrewsbury (175109) and between Chester and Crewe, 2018 at Deganwy, and in 2019 both near Pontrilas (175107) and at Gowerton (175102).

In February 2018, following the discovery of a number of instances of damaged wheels on Class 175 units, the entire fleet was temporarily withdrawn from service for safety checks. After further investigation, it was found that a track fault between Newport and Cwmbran had caused wheel damage to several trains, not only Class 175s but also some Class 158s.

On 8 February 2023, Transport for Wales Rail unit 175008 was travelling from to when the North Wales Fire and Rescue Service and Network Rail were alerted to a fire aboard the train. This was followed by two further fires, both at , on 22 February and 1 March 2023. All three fires were attributed to a build-up of &quot;debris, leaf litter, and other contaminants&quot; in the units&#x27; under-floor engine bays, a pre-existing problem for which a remediation programme was already underway at Chester Traincare Centre. Acknowledging that the three incidents in quick succession would &quot;raise concerns&quot;, TfW Rail decided on 2 March to temporarily withdraw from service all Class 175 units that had not been through the cleaning programme. This caused disruption to TfW operations, though the level of disruption reduced in the following days as cleaned units returned to service. A further remediation includes replacement of the engines&#x27; intercoolers.

<text>Lynda Maureen Haverstock ( Ham; born September 16, 1948) is the former leader of the Saskatchewan Liberal Party, was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan, and served as the 19th lieutenant governor of Saskatchewan from 2000 until July 2006. In 2007, she was named President/CEO of Tourism Saskatchewan.

== Biography ==
Born Lynda Maureen Ham and raised in Swift Current, Haverstock left high school after grade 10 to raise her infant daughter. As an adult, she returned to school to finish her education, and ultimately earned bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees in education, as well as a Ph.D. in psychology from the University of Saskatchewan. Haverstock rose to the forefront of the provincial Liberals in 1989 and was the first woman in Saskatchewan&#x27;s history to lead a political party. She brought the Liberals to realize a healthy increase in support, taking over 23 per cent of the vote in the 1991 provincial election. However, their numbers were spread too thinly across the province to translate into seats. Haverstock was the only Liberal to win a seat, in Saskatoon Greystone.

Under her leadership, the party grew significantly: in the 1995 provincial election, it increased its caucus in the Legislative Assembly to eleven, becoming the Official Opposition. The Liberals captured one-third of the popular vote.

Faced with of a coalition of Regina Liberals and former Tories who had unsuccessfully challenged her leadership, Haverstock resigned as leader in 1995. She spent the remainder of her legislative term as an independent member. In 1999, she retired from politics.

The Liberal Party continued to be divided by internal fighting and several members of the Legislative Assembly, including those who had opposed Haverstock, left in 1997 to join the Saskatchewan Party. The 1999 provincial election reduced the Liberals to three seats in the legislature. Since 2003, they have failed to elect any members.

After leaving politics, Haverstock worked briefly as a radio host before being appointed Lieutenant Governor of Saskatchewan in 2000. As the Queen&#x27;s representative, she was instrumental in organizing the province&#x27;s centennial celebrations in 2005. Haverstock&#x27;s term in office was extended and she remained Lieutenant Governor until July 31, 2006. During her tenure, she granted patronage to over one-hundred community-based organisations.

Dr. Lynda Haverstock is a member of the Order of Canada and the Saskatchewan Order of Merit, and has honorary doctorate degrees from the University of Regina, Royal Roads University (Victoria), and Queen&#x27;s University (Kingston). She is a recipient of the Distinguished Canadian Award and is named among the University of Saskatchewan&#x27;s 100 Alumni of Influence.

In June 2007, she became President/CEO of Tourism Saskatchewan, an arms-length, industry-driven authority responsible, in part, for marketing Saskatchewan as a destination. She has been successful in raising the profile of the organization and broadening awareness of Saskatchewan&#x27;s tourism sector. Under her direction, the province&#x27;s first Summit on Tourism was held in September 2007; six President&#x27;s Task Teams were formed to provide guidance on key challenges and issues; a Quality Assurance Program for the sector was introduced; and the first Tourism Advocacy Day at the provincial legislature was held in November 2011. Between 2006 and 2010, the province&#x27;s tourism revenues rose from $1.44 billion to $1.68 billion, and increase of 13.5 per cent.

Dr. Haverstock sits on the board of directors for Shaw Communications.

She and her husband Harley Olsen (former CEO of the Office of the Provincial Capital Commission and former Deputy Minister of Municipal Affairs) have four children and nine grandchildren.

Her brother Dennis Ham sat as a Conservative in the Saskatchewan assembly.

<doc id="1017417" wikidata="Q1978461" url="?curid=1017417" title="Nikon Coolpix 950">
<text>The Nikon Coolpix 950 was a digital camera released by Nikon in early 1999. The 950 model superseded the Coolpix 900 in the Nikon Coolpix series. The Coolpix 950 was a durable camera with swivel lens, magnesium body, a maximum resolution of 1600×1200 (1.92 Mpx), 3× optical zoom and a minimum focusing distance of 2 cm. It was in turn superseded by the Coolpix 990.

The 950 incorporated improvements over the 900 such as a stronger swivel hinge, a magnesium case (except the plastic battery door) and increased sensor resolution. The 950&#x27;s ability to capture directly in TIFF format was unusual for the time, although the file transfer time (depending on CF card write speed available at the time) could be over 30 seconds in this mode. The 950 came with a 8MB CF card, and the card could contain only 1 image file shot in the TIFF mode (~5.6MB). The maximum CF capacity for the 950 is 64MB.

Other advanced features of the 950 included shutter and aperture priority modes and the ability to custom-preset white balance. The 950 included a flash-sync socket for use with various Nikon external flash units (no shoe-mount was provided, however). As with all 9xx series, the lens movement during focusing and zooming was all internal, resulting in superior weather and dust resistance. The 950 shared with other 9xx series cameras the 28 mm filter threads and shared numerous Nikon and 3rd-party filters and diopter filters.

The 950, like all 9xx series Coolpix cameras, are still used as inexpensive microscopy cameras, primarily due to the exceptional macro capabilities. 28 mm threaded eyepiece adapters for popular commercial microscopes are widely available.

Modern digital cameras filter out most of the infrared spectrum that their sensors detect. The older generation of cameras, such as the Coolpix 950, however, did not filter so much IR light and are still useful today as inexpensive means to achieving this type of photography.

==Known issues==

A known issue with the camera was the battery compartment door, which was made from plastic. A somewhat cumbersome dual-action latching mechanism for the battery door often complicated this issue and, if operated incorrectly, could result in damage. Any damage to the battery door was troublesome, as the camera would not work at all if the door is unlatched. Fortunately, the door was and is an inexpensive part and could be replaced simply. Otherwise the (new to the 950) magnesium body proved a durable and rugged upgrade from the 900. 

Other known issues include the rubber finger grip, which could come loose, and while it caused no functional issues, it was bothersome and affected the &quot;feel&quot; of the camera in the shooting mode. The grip could be replaced with simple rubber cement. (Note: the grip is missing in the photo above.)

The body swivel bearing could become a bit wobbly over time. The 950 featured a much larger and improved bearing than the 900, and the loose bearing did not affect performance.

<doc id="1017418" wikidata="Q7894804" url="?curid=1017418" title="University Liggett School">
<text>University Liggett School, also known as Liggett, is a private, independent, secular school in Grosse Pointe Woods, Michigan, United States.

The school teaches grades PreK3 through twelve on one campus, consolidating its two campuses to one in the fall of 2012. According to the school, over 50 zip codes in Southeastern Michigan are represented by its student population. Over $2 million in merit- and need-based financial aid is awarded to new and returning students annually.

==History==

===The Liggett School===
In the spring of 1878, seven members of the Liggett family, headed by the Reverend James D. Liggett, settled in Detroit to establish a small, independent school for girls originally named The Detroit Home and Day School. In 1883, the school moved to a three-story brick building at the corner of Cass Avenue and Stimson Place. In 1914, the Albert Kahn-designed &quot;Eastern Liggett&quot; branch, on Burns Avenue at Charlevoix, was built and soon fully occupied. It would remain so until 1964, when classes would be held in a new building constructed on Briarcliff Drive in Grosse Pointe Woods. The Burns Avenue building was sold, and now houses the Detroit Waldorf School.

===Detroit University School===
Detroit University School, the second of Liggett’s predecessor schools, was founded in 1899 by Charles Bliss and Henry Gray Sherrard, who sought independence from public schools. In 1916, after a fire destroyed Detroit University School&#x27;s original building at Elmwood between Larned and Congress, it moved to what became known as the &quot;Castle,&quot; a Gothic-style former residence on Parkview Drive midway between Jefferson Avenue and the Detroit River. There it remained until 1928, when, with the help of Henry and Edsel Ford and many other Detroiters, the school relocated to Cook Road, then the eastern limits of Grosse Pointe.

===Grosse Pointe Country Day School===
Opened in 1915 in a white frame house (still standing at 301 Roosevelt Place in Grosse Pointe), Grosse Pointe Country Day School served boys and girls from kindergarten through ninth grade. A year later, classes opened in an English-style building located at Fisher Road and Grosse Pointe Boulevard. In 1941, Detroit University School and Grosse Pointe Country Day School joined forces under one board. For the day-to-day life of the schools, the major change was that Country Day sent its older boys to Detroit University School and became a school for girls.

===Grosse Pointe University School===
In 1954, the Country Day building was sold to the Grosse Pointe public schools and the girls joined the boys on the Cook Road campus, merging the schools to make Grosse Pointe University School. Minoru Yamasaki was commissioned to design a lower school, a middle school, and other facilities, such as a new gymnasium, an auditorium, a library, and fine arts rooms, to complement the two-story brick building erected in 1928.

In 1969, the need for an increase in space for the middle school was solved by merging Grosse Pointe University School with The Liggett School to form University Liggett School.
==Accreditations, Academics and Arts==

===Sports===
University Liggett School is accredited by the National Association of Independent Schools and Association of Independent Michigan Schools. ULS&#x27; sports teams compete with regional private and public high schools, such as Detroit Country Day School, Greenhills School, Oakland Christian, and Cranbrook Kingswood. Liggett competes athletically in the Michigan Independent Athletic Conference for most regular-season contests with many other similarly sized independent schools throughout Michigan. In 2017, the school became a member of the Catholic High School League. It also is a member of the Michigan High School Athletic Association and its 9-12 enrollment of 244 currently places it in MHSAA&#x27;s Class D.

University Liggett School has had three teams in the last two years compete in or win Michigan High School Athletic Association state championships. The girls basketball team was runner-up in the 2011 and 2012 seasons for Division III. The boys baseball team won the Division IV state title in 2011, was runner-up in the 2012 season, and won the state title again in 2013. The girls softball team was runner-up for the state title in 2013. Also, the boys ice hockey team won the Division III state title in 2012. In 2014, the girls ice hockey team won the Division I state title.

University Liggett School also has a &quot;FIRST&quot; Robotics Competition team that began its rookie season in 2010. The robotics team won the FIRST Robotics World Championship in 2022.

Midwest Premier League side Liquid Football used the stadium for their home games during the 2023 season.

===Arts===
University Liggett Schools students produce films and workshops made throughout the year, and the performing arts department launches two major theatrical productions annually: a drama each fall and a musical each winter. The school is active in the International Thespian Society and the Educational Theatre Association as Troupe 5253. The school&#x27;s Manoogian Arts Wing was added in 1981, under the planning of then-Arts head Ed Jacomo; it added arts facilities to the school, including a new dance studio, an art display, an audio-video editing studio, five arts classrooms, arts offices, and a conference room. Dr. Phillip Moss, a highly respected director and actor, is currently the chair of the creative and performing arts department of the school. Notable performances have included a 2011-2012 production of &quot;Chicago&quot; that was sent to national festival where many actors and crew received excellent and superior ratings.

<doc id="1017421" wikidata="Q798515" url="?curid=1017421" title="Backspace">
<text>Backspace (, codice_1) is the keyboard key that in typewriters originally pushed the carriage one position backwards, and in modern computer systems typically moves the display cursor one position backwards, deletes the character at that position, and shifts back any text after that position by one character.

==Nomenclature==

Although the term &quot;backspace&quot; is the traditional name of the key which steps the carriage back and/or deletes the previous character, typically to the left of the cursor, the actual key may be labeled in a variety of ways, for example &quot;delete&quot;, &quot;erase&quot;, or with a left pointing arrow. A dedicated symbol for &quot;backspace&quot; exists as U+232B ⌫ but its use as a keyboard label is not universal. Some very early typewriters labeled this key the &quot;backspacer&quot; key.

Backspace is distinct from the delete key, which in a teletypewriter would punch out all the holes in punched paper tape to strike out a character, and in modern computers deletes text at or &quot;following&quot; the cursor position. Also, the delete key often works as a generic command to remove an object (such as an image inside a document, or a file in a file manager), while backspace usually does not. Full-size Mac keyboards have two keys labeled &quot;delete&quot;; a key that functions as a backspace key, and a key that functions as a delete key. Smaller Mac keyboards, such as laptop keyboards, have only a key that functions as a backspace key.

==Combining characters==
In some typewriters, a typist would, for example, type a lowercase letter A with acute accent (á) by typing a lowercase letter A, backspace, and then the acute accent key. This technique (also known as overstrike) is the basis for such spacing modifiers in computer character sets such as the ASCII caret (^, for the circumflex accent). Backspace composition no longer works with typical modern digital displays or typesetting systems. It has to some degree been replaced with the combining diacritical marks mechanism of Unicode, though such characters do not work well with many fonts, and precomposed characters continue to be used. Some software like TeX or Microsoft Windows use the opposite method for diacritical marks, namely positioning the accent first, and then the base letter on its position.

==Use in computing==
===Common use===
In modern systems, the backspace key is often mapped to the delete character (0x7f in ASCII or Unicode), although the backspace key&#x27;s function of deleting the character before the cursor remains. In computers, backspace can also delete a preceding newline character, something generally inapplicable to typewriters.

The backspace key is commonly used to go back a page or up one level in graphical web or file browsers.

===^H===

Pressing the backspace key on a computer terminal would generate the ASCII code 08, BS or Backspace, a control code which would delete the preceding character. That control code could also be accessed by pressing (+, as H is the eighth letter of the Latin alphabet. Terminals which did not have the backspace code mapped to the function of moving the cursor backwards and deleting the preceding character would display the symbols ^H (caret, H) when the backspace key was pressed. Even if a terminal did interpret backspace by deleting the preceding character, the system receiving the text might not. Then, the sender&#x27;s screen would show a message without the supposedly deleted text, while that text, and the deletion codes, would be visible to the recipient. This sequence is still used humorously for epanorthosis by computer literates, denoting the deletion of a pretended blunder, much like a strikethrough; in this case, however, the ^H symbol is faked by typing a regular &#x27;^&#x27; followed by typing a regular &#x27;H&#x27;.

Example:
:&quot;Be nice to this fool&quot;^H^H^H^H&quot;gentleman; he&#x27;s visiting from corporate HQ.&quot;

====Alternatives====
An alternative sometimes seen is ^W, which is the shortcut to delete the previous word in the Berkeley Unix terminal line discipline. This shortcut has also made it into the insert mode of the Vi text editor and its clone Vim.

^U deletes a line.

==Other meanings==
In a mainframe environment, &quot;to backspace&quot; means to move a magnetic tape backwards, typically to the previous block.

<doc id="1017423" wikidata="Q1049960" url="?curid=1017423" title="Datagram Congestion Control Protocol">
<text>In computer networking, the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) is a message-oriented transport layer protocol. DCCP implements reliable connection setup, teardown, Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN), congestion control, and feature negotiation. The IETF published DCCP as , a proposed standard, in March 2006. provides an introduction.

==Operation==

DCCP provides a way to gain access to congestion-control mechanisms without having to implement them at the application layer. It allows for flow-based semantics like in Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), but does not provide reliable in-order delivery. Sequenced delivery within multiple streams as in the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) is not available in DCCP. A DCCP connection contains acknowledgment traffic as well as data traffic. Acknowledgments inform a sender whether its packets have arrived, and whether they were marked by Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN). Acknowledgements are transmitted as reliably as the congestion control mechanism in use requires, possibly completely reliably.

DCCP has the option for very long (48-bit) sequence numbers corresponding to a packet ID, rather than a byte ID as in TCP. The long length of the sequence numbers aims to guard against &quot;some blind attacks, such as the injection of DCCP-Resets into the connection&quot;.

==Applications==

DCCP is useful for applications with timing constraints on the delivery of data. Such applications include streaming media, multiplayer online games and Internet telephony. In such applications, old messages quickly become useless, so that getting new messages is preferred to resending lost messages. such applications have often either settled for TCP or used User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and implemented their own congestion-control mechanisms, or have no congestion control at all. While being useful for these applications, DCCP can also serve as a general congestion-control mechanism for UDP-based applications, by adding, as needed, mechanisms for reliable or in-order delivery on top of UDP/DCCP. In this context, DCCP allows the use of different, but generally TCP-friendly congestion-control mechanisms.

==Implementations==

The following operating systems implement DCCP:
* FreeBSD, version 5.1 as patch
* Linux since version 2.6.14, but marked deprecated since version 6.4 due to lack of maintenance and scheduled for removal in 2025.
Userspace library:
* DCCP-TP implementation is optimized for portability, but has had no changes since June 2008.
* GoDCCP purpose of this implementation is to provide a standardized, portable NAT-friendly framework for peer-to-peer communications with flexible congestion control, depending on application.

==Packet structure==

The DCCP generic header takes different forms depending on the value of X, the Extended Sequence Numbers bit. If X is one, the Sequence Number field is 48 bits long, and the generic header takes 16 bytes, as follows.


If X is zero, only the low 24 bits of the Sequence Number are transmitted, and the generic header is 12 bytes long.

==Current development==
Similarly to the extension of TCP protocol by multipath capability (MPTCP) also for DCCP the multipath feature is under discussion at IETF correspondingly denoted as MP-DCCP. First implementations have already been developed, tested, and presented in a collaborative approach between operators and academia and are available as an open source solution.

<doc id="1017427" wikidata="Q603741" url="?curid=1017427" title="Prodrug">
<text>A prodrug is a pharmacologically inactive medication or compound that, after intake, is metabolized (i.e., converted within the body) into a pharmacologically active drug. Instead of administering a drug directly, a corresponding prodrug can be used to improve how the drug is absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and excreted (ADME). 

Prodrugs are often designed to improve bioavailability when a drug itself is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. A prodrug may be used to improve how selectively the drug interacts with cells or processes that are not its intended target. This reduces adverse or unintended effects of a drug, especially important in treatments like chemotherapy, which can have severe unintended and undesirable side effects.
== History ==
Many herbal extracts historically used in medicine contain glycosides (sugar derivatives) of the active agent, which are hydrolyzed in the intestines to release the active and more bioavailable aglycone. For example, salicin is a β-D-glucopyranoside that is cleaved by esterases to release salicylic acid. Aspirin, acetylsalicylic acid, first made by Felix Hoffmann at Bayer in 1897, is a synthetic prodrug of salicylic acid. However, in other cases, such as codeine and morphine, the administered drug is enzymatically activated to form sugar derivatives (morphine-glucuronides) that are more active than the parent compound.

The first synthetic antimicrobial drug, arsphenamine, discovered in 1909 by Sahachiro Hata in the laboratory of Paul Ehrlich, is not toxic to bacteria until it has been converted to an active form by the body. Likewise, prontosil, the first sulfa drug (discovered by Gerhard Domagk in 1932), must be cleaved in the body to release the active molecule, sulfanilamide. Since that time, many other examples have been identified.

Terfenadine, the first non-sedating antihistamine, had to be withdrawn from the market because of the small risk of a serious side effect. However, terfenadine was discovered to be the prodrug of the active molecule, fexofenadine, which does not carry the same risks as the parent compound. Therefore, fexofenadine could be placed on the market as a safe replacement for the original drug. 

Loratadine, another non-sedating antihistamine, is the prodrug of desloratadine, which is largely responsible for the antihistaminergic effects of the parent compound. However, in this case the parent compound does not have the side effects associated with terfenadine, and so both loratadine and its active metabolite, desloratadine, are currently marketed.

== Recent prodrugs ==
Approximately 10% of all marketed drugs worldwide can be considered prodrugs. Since 2008, at least 30 prodrugs have been approved by the FDA. Seven prodrugs were approved in 2015 and six in 2017. Examples of recently approved prodrugs are such as dabigatran etexilate (approved in 2010), gabapentin enacarbil (2011), sofosbuvir (2013), tedizolid phosphate (2014), isavuconazonium (2015), aripiprazole lauroxil (2015), selexipag (2015), latanoprostene bunod (2017), benzhydrocodone (2018), tozinameran (2020) and serdexmethylphenidate (2021).

== Classification ==
Prodrugs can be classified into two major types, based on how the body converts the prodrug into the final active drug form: 
* Type I prodrugs are bioactivated inside the cells (intracellularly). Examples of these are anti-viral nucleoside analogs that must be phosphorylated and the lipid-lowering statins. 
* Type II prodrugs are bioactivated outside cells (extracellularly), especially in digestive fluids or in the body&#x27;s circulatory system, particularly in the blood. Examples of Type II prodrugs are salicin (described above) and certain antibody-, gene- or virus-directed enzyme prodrugs used in chemotherapy or immunotherapy.

Both major types can be further categorized into subtypes, based on factors such as (Type I) whether the intracellular bioactivation location is also the site of therapeutic action, or (Type 2) whether or not bioactivation occurs in the gastrointestinal fluids or in the circulation system.

== Subtypes ==
Type IA prodrugs include many antimicrobial and chemotherapy agents (e.g., 5-flurouracil). Type IB agents rely on metabolic enzymes, especially in hepatic cells, to bioactivate the prodrugs intracellularly to active drugs. Type II prodrugs are bioactivated extracellularly, either in the milieu of GI fluids (Type IIA), within the systemic circulation and/or other extracellular fluid compartments (Type IIB), or near therapeutic target tissues/cells (Type IIC), relying on common enzymes such as esterases and phosphatases or target directed enzymes. 

Importantly, prodrugs can belong to multiple subtypes (i.e., Mixed-Type). A Mixed-Type prodrug is one that is bioactivated at multiple sites, either in parallel or sequential steps. For example, a prodrug, which is bioactivated concurrently in both target cells and metabolic tissues, could be designated as a &quot;Type IA/IB&quot; prodrug (e.g., HMG Co-A reductase inhibitors and some chemotherapy agents; note the symbol &quot; / &quot; applied here). When a prodrug is bioactivated sequentially, for example initially in GI fluids then systemically within the target cells, it is designated as a &quot;Type IIA-IA&quot; prodrug (e.g., tenofovir disoproxil; note the symbol &quot; - &quot; applied here). Many antibody- virus- and gene-directed enzyme prodrug therapies (ADEPTs, VDEPTs, GDEPTs) and proposed nanoparticle- or nanocarrier-linked drugs can understandably be Sequential Mixed-Type prodrugs. To differentiate these two Subtypes, the symbol dash &quot; - &quot; is used to designate and to indicate sequential steps of bioactivation, and is meant to distinguish from the symbol slash &quot; / &quot; used for the Parallel Mixed-Type prodrugs.

<text>AC Comics (formerly known as Paragon Publications and Americomics) is a comic book publishing company started by Bill Black.

AC Comics specializes in reprints of Golden Age comics from now-defunct companies whose properties lapsed into public domain and were not reprinted elsewhere. It also publishes a number of Modern Age adventures starring the Golden Age superheroes that appeared in those stories. The most famous of those titles is &quot;Femforce&quot;, which features the adventures of an all-female superhero team, one of the first teams of this nature in the comics industry.

Based on its focus on Golden Age reprints and stories inspired by that style, AC has developed a reputation for straightforward, fun, and action-packed superhero tales which often avoid the darker themes of many modern comics. AC artists often make use of a style known as &quot;good girl art&quot;, made popular in the Golden Age era, which combines attractive, clean linework with elements of cheesecake and humor. In addition to superheroes, AC has attempted to preserve other comic book genres inspired by the series of the past, such as Westerns and jungle adventure.

==History==

=== Paragon Publications ===
AC Comics was founded as &quot;Paragon Publications&quot; in 1969, and released the first issue of &quot;Paragon Illustrated&quot; magazine in Fall of that year, followed by its first comic titles—&quot;Paragon Presents&quot; and &quot;White Savage&quot;—in 1970. Other titles from Paragon&#x27;s beginnings included &quot;Fem Fantastique&quot; and &quot;Paragon Golden Age Greats&quot; (1971), &quot;Macabre Western&quot; and &quot;Captain Paragon&quot; (1972), &quot;Paragon Magazine&quot; and &quot;Paragon Super Heroes&quot; (1973), &quot;Tara on the Dark Continent&quot; (1974), and &quot;Paragon Western Stars&quot; (1975). The company&#x27;s early titles were cheaply published black-and-white comics. Though the company published several titles simultaneously, they were only able to produce a total of three issues a year, since nearly all writing, inking, and editing on the comics was done by Bill Black himself during this period.

=== Americomics ===
In 1982, the company changed its name to &quot;Americomics&quot; before settling on &quot;AC Comics&quot; in 1984. The original plan behind the reintroduction as Americomics was to narrow the lineup to a single full-color anthology series, &quot;Americomics&quot;, which the publisher could put out on a consistent basis, rather than the earlier model of several black-and-white titles published sporadically.

The first issues of &quot;Americomics&quot; coincided with the independent comics boom, and the publisher responded to this unexpected success by expanding its lineup of titles to include several creator-owned series, such as &quot;Dragonfly&quot;. However, most of these titles were produced and funded by the creators themselves, with minimal creative oversight from Americomics.

=== AC Comics ===
In 1985, AC debuted &quot;Femforce&quot;, which it still publishes today. Other AC series include &quot;Best of the West&quot; (1998–2009) and the ongoing &quot;Men of Mystery Comics&quot;. Following the popularity of size-changing Femforce members Garganta and Tara, AC made the giantess concept a recurring theme in their comics. Tapping into this cult following, AC has released stories and anthologies specifically catered to fans of giant women, as well as DVD releases which embrace this theme in the tongue-in-cheek style of 1950s science fiction B-movies. An ongoing giantess feature known as &quot;Gargantarama&quot; has even been added to the company&#x27;s &quot;Femforce&quot; title.

By 1986, AC Comics had expanded to a staff of roughly 25 people. Production was largely handled through the mail, since only a handful of staff resided anywhere near AC&#x27;s Florida headquarters.

AC has expanded into other DVD projects which collect classic movie serials and other material now in the public domain, as well as low-budget films based on their own characters.

==Licenses==
AC Comics had used Charlton Comics characters, particularly the Blue Beetle and Captain Atom, in the comic title &quot;Sentinels of Justice&quot;. When the rights for these characters were sold to DC Comics, AC Comics created a second Sentinels of Justice team (writing the first out of continuity), composed of some of its original characters as well as ones from the public domain. Many of these are homages to Charlton and Quality Comics heroes, such as the Scarlet Scorpion (a stand-in for Blue Beetle) and the Blue Bulleteer (later Nightveil) who is based on the Fox Comics version of Phantom Lady. Still another Phantom Lady-inspired character was The Black Mistress, whose first episode was scripted by former Vampirella writer T. Casey Brennan.

<doc id="1017433" wikidata="Q977526" url="?curid=1017433" title="Cutting Crew">
<text>Cutting Crew are an English rock band formed in London in 1985. They are best known for their debut studio album &quot;Broadcast&quot; (1986) and hit singles, &quot;(I Just) Died in Your Arms&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ve Been in Love Before&quot;.

==History==
===1985–1986: Formation===
While still in his teens, Nick Van Eede (born Nicholas Eede) recorded a few UK solo singles in the late 1970s. Later, he was in the band the Drivers, which found success in Canada, particularly with their 1982 single &quot;Tears on Your Anorak&quot;. While touring Canada, the Drivers had a support band called Fast Forward, whose line-up included guitarist Kevin MacMichael. Van Eede was so impressed with MacMichael&#x27;s guitar playing that he asked him to form a new band with him. The Drivers broke up in 1984, but MacMichael continued to tour with Fast Forward. In 1985, MacMichael survived an accident when his tour bus drove off the side of a mountain, and he relocated to London, England to join forces with Van Eede. Initially, the two made demos before bassist Colin Farley and drummer Martin &quot;Frosty&quot; Beedle joined in 1986. They named the band &quot;Cutting Crew&quot; after a quote by Queen, who were once asked why they were not touring, and they replied, &quot;We&#x27;re a cutting crew&quot;, meaning they were only cutting records in the studio.

Having assembled the band, they invited representatives from various labels to a London recording studio to showcase the crew, and they were later signed by Siren Records, which was part of Virgin Records.

===1986–1988: &quot;Broadcast&quot; and breakthrough===
Their debut studio album, &quot;Broadcast&quot;, was released on Virgin Records in 1986. The song &quot;(I Just) Died in Your Arms&quot; was mixed in London at Utopia Studios by Tim Palmer. Although Virgin Records was already a major label in the UK, their debut song, &quot;(I Just) Died in Your Arms&quot;, provided the first US hit for Virgin as a full-fledged label. This song release quickly helped the band gain popularity. Virgin flew the band to New York City for initial recordings of the album, then to Australia to shoot music videos. The unknown band shot to No. 1 in the major US market, as well as smaller markets such as Canada and Norway, with their debut single. Their most popular single was a multiformat success in the US, where it also reached number four on the Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, No. 24 on the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart and—in an extended remix version—No. 37 on the Hot Dance/Club Play chart. The song peaked at No. 4 in another major market, the UK Singles Chart, as well as becoming a hit in the smaller Switzerland and South Africa markets. It went to No. 2 in Sweden and Ireland, and No. 9 in Austria. Keyboardist Tony Moore joined in 1986 and was a touring member of the band through 1988. 

The choice for follow-up single in the UK had been &quot;I&#x27;ve Been in Love Before&quot;, but that song spent only three weeks in the UK Top 40, peaking at No. 31. Their choice for follow-up single in the US was their third UK release, &quot;One for the Mockingbird&quot;, but the song was a relative commercial disappointment on both sides of the Atlantic, just cracking the Top 40 of the Hot 100 at No. 38 and hitting No. 29 on the Mainstream Rock chart in the US, No. 47 in Canada and No. 52 in the UK Singles Chart.

The band took a chance on &quot;I&#x27;ve Been in Love Before&quot; again, this time with greater success. The song became Cutting Crew&#x27;s second US Top 10 on the Hot 100, peaking at No. 9, and was their first major hit on the US Adult Contemporary chart, where it peaked at No. 2. This success prompted a UK re-release, and this time it spent five weeks in the UK Singles Chart Top 40, peaking at No. 24. The song failed to chart throughout most of Europe, but it peaked at No. 8 in Canada. Despite an unflattering review by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, Cutting Crew received a Grammy nomination as the Best New Artist of 1987.

===1988–1990: &quot;The Scattering&quot;===
Disputes with management led to a long recording hiatus, which stalled the band&#x27;s career momentum. Cutting Crew&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;The Scattering&quot;, was finally released in early 1989. Its lead single, &quot;(Between a) Rock and a Hard Place&quot; (CA 54, UK 66, U.S. 77), failed to reach the Top 40. Van Eede&#x27;s vocal style, however, did score a sizeable US Adult Contemporary hit with &quot;Everything but My Pride.&quot; That song peaked at No. 4 and stayed in the top 50 for 22 weeks. It climbed to No. 72 on the Canadian pop charts, though it failed to hit the US Hot 100. The prophetically named &quot;The Last Thing&quot; scaled the AC charts as high as No. 17 in early 1990 and went to No. 90 on the Canadian chart, and has been their final chart hit to date. Although a music video for the title track did air briefly in the UK and North America, &quot;The Scattering&quot; failed to chart.

===1991–1992: &quot;Compus Mentus&quot;===
Recorded at The Mill Studios in Cookham, Berkshire on the Thames and produced by Chris Neil. Farley and Beedle left the group in 1991 with no replacement, leaving only Eede and MacMichael in the group. Eede sang and played keyboards and MacMichael played all guitars (lead and bass). Standout tracks are &quot;Frigid as England&quot; written by Jeff Lowe, the plaintive &quot;Sweet Auburn&quot; and the darkly comic, &quot;Don&#x27;t Let It Bring You Down&quot;.

The album spawned one single, &quot;If That&#x27;s the Way You Want It.&quot; Neither the single nor the album itself charted. Within weeks of its release, Virgin Records was bought by EMI and the album became obsolete.

===1993–2005: Break-up and MacMichael&#x27;s death===
The band broke up in 1993; shortly after the release of their &quot;Compus Mentus&quot; studio album. After the break-up, MacMichael joined forces with Robert Plant of Led Zeppelin and played on his solo studio album &quot;Fate of Nations&quot;. On 31 December 2002, MacMichael died of lung cancer at the Queen Elizabeth II Health Sciences Centre in Halifax, Nova Scotia, at the age of 51.

===2005–2014: Reformation===
In 2003, Van Eede formed the group Grinning Souls. This group independently released the studio album &quot;Capture&quot; in 2005. The following year, Van Eede took the decision to re-release the album under the title &quot;Grinning Souls&quot;, this time crediting the work to Cutting Crew. Grinning Souls (the band) became Cutting Crew for all subsequent live work: Van Eede was the only original Cutting Crew member in the group.

The new band toured in Germany, Norway, the UK, Canada, Hungary, Switzerland and the USA with, amongst others, ABC, Berlin, Wang Chung, Supertramp, Level 42 and Midge Ure. In 2008, Cutting Crew signed a US deal with label Spectra Records.

===2015–2019: &quot;Add to Favourites&quot;===
In October 2015, Cutting Crew released their fifth studio album, &quot;Add to Favourites&quot;, through In Red Flynn label, via Cherry Red Records. It features &quot;Till the Money Run$ Out&quot;, which was released as the first single on 4 September 2015. The band line-up included guitarists Gareth Moulton and Joolz Dunkley, bassist Nick Kay, keyboardist Jono Harrison, drummer Martyn Barker and the Blackjack Horns. The band embarked on a UK tour shortly after its release.

===2020–present: &quot;Ransomed Healed Restored Forgiven&quot;===

At the end of 2018, Cutting Crew had announced, through their social networks, they had plans to release a new album featuring &quot;new songs and new versions of CC classics.&quot; Although they did not have any new releases for 2019, a press release made by January of the following year announced the release for their second official worldwide compilation album titled &quot;Ransomed Healed Restored Forgiven&quot;, featuring nine songs from their past catalogue reworked as orchestral renditions, as well as other versions. Soon afterwards, the release date was announced on 27 March 2020 by Van Eede in a short video through the Cutting Crew official Facebook page. On the same day, they released the lead single for this project, an eight-track digital EP of their signature song &quot;(I Just) Died in Your Arms&quot;, which also received a physical release, as well as a brand new video for the song uploaded on YouTube. 

The album was released on 24 April 2020, through August Day label, on digital platforms such as Spotify and Apple Music. But due to logistics limitations during the COVID-19 pandemic, its physical release was delayed until 8 May 2020. Along with its other formats there is a limited box edition containing three different CDs, as well as the physical CD edition of the reworked &quot;(I Just) Died in Your Arms&quot; EP, and a postcard signed by Van Eede himself. To promote the album, Van Eede spoke to several media outlets, such as &quot;American Songwriter&quot; and &quot;Forbes&quot;.
This greatest hits album has since spawned two more singles, the orchestral version of the &quot;Broadcast&quot; single &quot;One for the Mockingbird&quot;, and the orchestral version of &quot;The Scattering&quot; single &quot;Everything but My Pride&quot;. 

On 5 August 2020, it was announced a vinyl limited edition, with only 300 copies pressed, would be available for purchase solely through DTC, making this the first vinyl edition of one of the band&#x27;s releases since &quot;The Scattering&quot;. After Van Eede stated he had planned to do some concerts held in England in 2021 to support the album, the band announced on 7 September 2020 they would be the opening act for Go West&#x27;s upcoming tour to happen in 2021, but, after the sanitary measures regarding COVID-19 pandemic still happening, the joint tour was postponed to the first half of the following year. Cutting Crew&#x27;s setlist for this tour featured several cuts from &quot;Ransomed&quot;. After concluding touring the UK, Cutting Crew started their 35th Anniversary Tour in Germany.

<doc id="1017436" wikidata="Q207441" url="?curid=1017436" title="Senegal national football team">
<text>The Senegal national football team (French: &quot;Équipe de football du Senegal&quot;), nicknamed &quot;Les Lions de la Teranga&quot; (meaning: &quot;The Lions of Teranga&quot;), represents Senegal in men&#x27;s international association football and is operated by the Senegalese Football Federation.

One of Africa&#x27;s most famous national football teams, Senegal reached the quarter-finals of the 2002 FIFA World Cup, the second team from Africa to do so (after Cameroon in 1990). They managed to upset defending world champions France, finish second in their group, and beat Sweden in extra time in the round of 16, before losing to Turkey in the quarter-finals.

Senegal&#x27;s first appearance in the Africa Cup of Nations was in 1965, when they lost 1–0 to Ivory Coast for fourth place. They hosted the 1992 African Cup of Nations, where they made it to the quarter-finals, and finished as runners-up in both 2002 and 2019. Senegal would finally win their first AFCON title in 2021, defeating Egypt in the final on penalties following a 0–0 draw after extra time.

Along with Norway, Senegal is one of very few national football teams never to have lost against Brazil, having one win and one draw in friendly matches.

==History==
===Early history===
Senegal gained its independence from France on 4 April 1960, and the Senegalese Football Federation (FSF) was founded that year. The first Senegal match took place on 31 December 1961 against Dahomey (now Benin), a 3–2 loss. The FSF has been affiliated with FIFA since 1962 and has been a member of the Confederation of African Football (CAF) since 1963. Senegal&#x27;s first appearance in the Africa Cup of Nations was in 1965, where they finished second in their group, and lost 1–0 to Ivory Coast to finish in fourth place. After a group stage exit at the AFCON three years later, they would not qualify for the tournament until 1986.

===1990s and 2000s===
In the 1990 Africa Cup of Nations, Senegal finished fourth; they hosted the 1992 tournament, where after finishing second in their group, they were eliminated by Cameroon in the quarterfinals.
Senegal lost the 2002 final on a penalty shoot-out after drawing 0–0 with Cameroon. Later that year, Senegal made their debut appearance at the World Cup. After defeating defending world champions France in their opening game, they drew with Denmark and Uruguay to progress from the group stage, then beat Sweden in extra time in the round of 16 to reach the quarter-finals, one of only four African teams to do so (alongside Cameroon in 1990, Ghana in 2010 and Morocco in 2022). There, they lost to Turkey in extra time.

Senegal qualified for the 2008 Africa Cup of Nations, but finished third in their group with two points. They failed to make the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa, the first World Cup to be held in Africa.

===2010s===
Senegal was eliminated from the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations with zero wins and zero points.

After former manager Bruno Metsu died on 14 October 2013, many Senegalese players were recalled to appear and have a moment of silence in memory of the manager who helped them reach the quarter-final in the 2002 World Cup. All activities of the national league and the national team were suspended for a few days in his memory.

The West African nation narrowly missed the 2014 FIFA World Cup after losing in a round-robin match against Ivory Coast in the final qualification round. Senegal qualified for two Africa Cup of Nations tournaments before the next World Cup, being eliminated in the group stage in 2015 and reaching the quarterfinals in 2017. On 10 November 2017, after defeating South Africa 2–0, Senegal qualified for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, their first since 2002. Senegal defeated Poland 2–1 in their opening group match, thanks to an own goal by Thiago Cionek and a M&#x27;Baye Niang strike. In the next group stage match, Senegal drew 2–2 against Japan, with goals from Sadio Mané and Moussa Wagué. A 1–0 loss to Colombia in their final match meant they finished level on points with Japan, who progressed thanks to a superior fair play record. Thus, Senegal was eliminated in the group stage for the first time in its World Cup history.

Aliou Cissé, who participated in the 2002 AFCON, managed Senegal to a runner-up campaign in the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations. Having lost 1–0 to Algeria earlier in the tournament, Senegal lost 1–0 to them again in the final.

===2020s===
Deprived of many players due to COVID-19, Senegal participated in the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations, postponed to 2022 because of the pandemic; they beat Zimbabwe in their first match 1–0 and drew their next two games, enough to finish first in their group. In the round of 16, Senegal faced Cape Verde. Mané recorded a shot that hit the post in the first minute. Patrick Andrade was sent off in the 21st minute, after intervention of the video assistant referee. Despite their dominance, the first half ended without a single shot on target; Mané opened the scoring a few minutes into the second half, following a corner.

Senegal faced Equatorial Guinea in the quarter-finals. The Lions opened the scoring half an hour into the game, by Famara Diédhiou on a pass from Mané; Senegal eventually won 3–1. In the semi-finals, Senegal faced Burkina Faso, winning 3–1 again. In the final, Senegal faced Egypt, who eliminated hosts Cameroon in the semi-finals. In a penalty shoot-out, Mané scored the winning penalty, to bring Senegal its first Africa Cup of Nations title. Senegal returned home and took part in a victory parade that took place in the capital, Dakar. It ended up becoming the biggest party in the country&#x27;s history.

Senegal faced Egypt twice after the AFCON final, eliminating the Egyptians on penalties after being tied 1–1 on aggregate, to qualify for the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Mané eliminated his Liverpool teammate Mohamed Salah after scoring the winning penalty again.
The penalty shoot-out was however full of controversies with lasers being pointed at Egypt&#x27;s penalty takers and goalkeeper. FIFA fined Senegal&#x27;s football federation 175,000 Swiss francs as a result of the fan disorder.

For the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, Senegal were drawn in Group A along with the hosts Qatar, Ecuador and the Netherlands. Star man Mané missed out due to injury, but Senegal managed to progress from the group nonetheless. Though they lost their first game against the Netherlands 2–0, Senegal went on to claim six points against the hosts and then Ecuador in their final game, progressing to the Round of 16, where they lost 3–0 to England. It marked the second time Senegal had progressed past the group stage, in only their third appearance.

==Kit history==
Puma has been the manufacturer of Senegal&#x27;s kits since 2005 (except 2017, when Romai was the manufacturer). The home kit is typically white, and the away kit is green.

===FIFA World Cup===

Senegal have appeared in the finals of the FIFA World Cup on three occasions, in 2002 where they reached the quarter-finals, in 2018, and in 2022.

===Africa Cup of Nations===

Historically, Senegal was seen as a weaker side in the strong West African region. Although they finished in fourth place in two AFCON editions, Senegalese performance was overall still deemed as poor. Senegal remained under the shadow of West African giants Nigeria, Ivory Coast and Ghana for the majority of the 20th century.

In the 2000s, Senegal began to surge and became a more competitive opponent in the Africa Cup of Nations. Following a successful FIFA World Cup debut in 2002, in which the side reached the quarter-finals, Senegal established itself as a new powerhouse in Africa. The 2002 Africa Cup of Nations tournament marked a defeat to Cameroon 2–3 on penalties after a goalless draw in the final. Senegal once again finished as runners-up in 2019, losing the final 0–1 to Algeria, and finally won their first AFCON title in 2021.

<text>Lenzburg Castle () is a castle located above the old part of the town of Lenzburg in the Canton of Aargau, Switzerland. It ranks among the oldest and most important of Switzerland. The castle stands on the almost circular castle hill (altitude: 504 m), which rises approximately over the surrounding plain but is only about in diameter. The oldest parts of the castle date to the 11th century, when the Counts of Lenzburg built it as their seat. The castle, its historical museum and the castle hill with its Neolithic burial grounds are listed as heritage sites of national significance.

==History==
The prominent hill was already a settlement site in prehistoric times. For example, in 1959 a Neolithic gravesite was uncovered in the carpark. There have also been small discoveries from the Roman and Alemannic eras.

A legend tells that there was once a dragon living in a cave in the hillside, who was defeated by two knights, Wolfram and Guntram. The grateful people made the two Counts of Lenzburg and gave them permission to build a castle on the hilltop.

===Seat of nobility===

A charter dated 1036 names one Ulrich, Count of Aargau. He was the Emperor&#x27;s Vogt in Zürich and overseer of the abbeys of Beromünster and Schänis. The first definite record of the existence of a castle dates to 1077: Ulrich&#x27;s grandson, also Ulrich, had taken the emperor&#x27;s position in the Investiture Controversy and imprisoned two Papal legates for half a year. At that time the Counts of Lenzburg were among the most important feudal lords on the Swiss plateau and maintained close connections to the emperor.

The line died out in 1173. Ulrich IV, the last Count of Lenzburg, named Emperor Friedrich I Barbarossa as his personal heir in his will; they had been on the Second Crusade together. The emperor came to Lenzburg Castle and personally supervised the division of the estate, giving a majority of the lands to his son, the Count palatine Otto of Burgundy. However, after Otto&#x27;s death in 1200, the House of Hohenstaufen was forced to withdraw from the Aargau. By way of two neighbouring aristocratic houses (Andechs-Merania and Chalon), in about 1230 Lenzburg castle came by marriage into the possession of the Counts of Kyburg. They then founded a fortified market settlement at the western base of the castle hill, today&#x27;s town of Lenzburg.

Hartmann, the last Count of Kyburg, died in 1264 without male issue. Rudolph I, Count of Habsburg and later King of the Romans, placed the heir, Anna of Kyburg, under his protection and she later married Eberhard I of Habsburg-Laufenburg. In 1273 Rudolph took possession of the estate from his impoverished relatives and in 1275 held court there. However, the castle then declined into a regional seat of government, as the power of the Habsburgs shifted more and more to Austria. On 20 August 1306, Lenzburg received its charter as a town from Count Frederick the Fair. From 1339 on, Count Frederick II of Tyrol-Austria resided at the castle. He was to have married a daughter of King Edward III of England and had the Knights&#x27; Hall built for the purpose, but died in 1344 without ever seeing his bride, and the building remained incomplete. After 1369, the Schultheiss-Ribi family were tenants of the castle. In 1375 the castle underwent a siege by the Gugler.

===Bernese rule===

The latent tensions between Sigismund, King of Germany and Frederick IV, Duke of Austria exploded in 1415 at the Council of Constance, when Frederick assisted one of the three then reigning popes, Antipope John XXIII, in escaping from the town. Sigismund took the opportunity to harm his opponent, ordering his neighbours to seize his lands in the name of the Empire. Bern willingly conquered the western part of the Aargau.

The town of Lenzburg immediately surrendered to the advancing army on 20 April, but the castle for the moment remained untouched by the conflict. Konrad of Weinsberg, the king&#x27;s representative, attempted to secure it for the Empire and had it prepared for a siege. But by August he saw the futility of this plan and in 1418 returned the castle to the control of the Schultheiss family. After lengthy negotiations, Bern was able to secure control of the County of Lenzburg as subtenants in 1433 and finally in 1442 of the castle.

The first Bernese Landvogt took up residence in the castle in 1444, governing the district of Lenzburg from there. The duties of a Landvogt included collecting taxes, implementing administrative measures, judicial and police tasks and the power of military decree; they were also responsible for the upkeep of the castle. The Landvogt was elected from the ranks of the city council of Bern for four–year terms. The best known Landvogt of Lenzburg was Adrian I of Bubenberg, from 1457 to 1461, later Schultheiß of Bern and hero of the Battle of Morat.

In 1509–10, extensive work was carried out at the castle, including partial demolition and rebuilding of the unfinished Knights&#x27; Hall. In 1518 there was a serious fire; which buildings were destroyed is not recorded (most likely the &quot;Arburghaus&quot; on the north side). In 1520 the Landvogt received a new residence, the &quot;Landvogtei&quot;. During the Second war of Kappel in 1531, the castle served as base of operations for the Protestants.
In 1624 Landvogt Joseph Plepp drew the first precise drawings and plans of the castle, which at the time had more the appearance of a fortified farmhouse. His plans formed the basis for plans to expand it into a fortress. As the first step, in 1625 a double curtain wall and double gatehouse were constructed in a new position in the north section and the height of the earthen embankments on the east and south sides was increased. From 1642 to 1646, a wall eleven metres high was raised to form the east bastion. However, lack of money prevented execution of the remaining projects. Also, the east bastion had a major disadvantage: rainwater seeped through the adjacent walls and rendered the Landvogt&#x27;s residence uninhabitable due to persistent damp. For this reason a new residence was constructed in the north section between 1672 and 1674.

During the 18th century, the Bernese developed the castle into a large grain store. For this purpose, the individual buildings were connected and partially hollowed out. By this means storage for over 5,000 tonnes of wheat was provided.

In March 1798, Viktor von Wattenwyl, the 71st and last Landvogt, surrendered the castle to the advancing French troops.

===Leasehold and private possession===
In 1803 the Canton of Aargau was founded, and a year later the castle passed into its possession. The cantonal authorities were uncertain what use should be made of the castle and so it stood empty for almost twenty years. Using it for governmental purposes was out of the question for this symbol of the rule of the downtrodden. Finally, Christian Lippe, a teacher active in Hofwil, showed an interest. He rented the castle and in 1822 opened an educational institution based on the principles of Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi. While it flourished, it had 50 students and 12 teachers, with above all sons of prominent manufacturing families in Basel and Alsace receiving their education there. The &quot;Hintere Haus&quot; or rear building was used as the school building while the teachers lived in the &quot;Landvogtei&quot;. In 1853 the institution had to close because Lippe was gravely ill.
In 1860, the canton sold the castle for 60,000 francs to Konrad Pestalozzi-Scotchburn of Zürich. Little is known about him. In 1872, for 90,000 francs, the castle came into the possession of Friedrich Wilhelm Wedekind. He had emigrated to San Francisco after the failure of the March Revolution of 1849 and there made a sizeable fortune speculating in land during the California Gold Rush. Returning to Europe in 1864, in protest against Prussian domination of the German Empire he emigrated once more, this time to Switzerland, and settled in the castle. His 6 children, among them the singer Erika Wedekind and the authors Frank Wedekind and Donald Wedekind, spent their childhoods there.

To make division of the inheritance possible, the Wedekind family sold the castle in 1893 for 120,000 francs to the American industrialist Augustus Edward Jessup. He was from Philadelphia, but was a long-time resident of England. He was married to Mildred Marion Bowes-Lyon, the aunt of the Queen Mother, Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, and thus allied by marriage to the British royal family. Under Jessup&#x27;s leadership, the castle underwent a comprehensive renovation and by dismantling of the newer construction and military facilities was largely returned to its condition in the Middle Ages. In addition, he furnished the interiors with expensive furniture and installed modern facilities such as central heating, plumbing and electricity. He defrayed the half a million francs in costs from his personal fortune.

Another American industrial magnate, James Ellsworth, who collected medieval art, learnt that Lenzburg Castle contained a table from the period of Friedrich Barbarossa. Wishing to add it to his collection, he found it impossible to purchase it without also purchasing the entire castle. As a result, the castle changed hands in 1911 for 550,000 francs. His son, the Polar explorer Lincoln Ellsworth, inherited the castle in 1925 but lived there only intermittently.

===Recent history===
After Lincoln Ellsworth&#x27;s death in 1951, ownership of the castle passed to his widow Marie Louise Ellsworth-Ulmer. In 1956 she sold the castle together with its contents for 500,000 francs to a foundation set up by the town of Lenzburg and the Canton of Aargau. This made it possible to open the castle to the public. In 1960, the &quot;Stapferhaus Lenzburg&quot; cultural foundation was established and moved into the &quot;Hintere Haus&quot;. Between 1978 and 1986, the castle was once more thoroughly renovated, and a French-style garden established in the southwest section. In 1987, the canton transferred its comprehensive cultural history collections to the castle and opened the &quot;Historisches Museum Aargau&quot; (Historical Museum of the Aargau), which in 2007 became the &quot;Museum Aargau&quot; (Aargau Museum). Since 2009, the displays have been undergoing renovation in stages.

==Castle buildings==
The entrance to the castle is on the northeast side. Via either the old castle path or a stairway, one comes to the lower gatehouse, built in 1625, and then to the outer curtain wall. Inside the middle gatehouse (which was also built in 1625 and enlarged in 1761–62), the path makes a 180° turn and leads up to the drawbridge and through the inner gatehouse into the inner bailey.

On the east side, the inner bailey is protected and has 7 buildings arranged in a horseshoe. On the southwest side, the French-style garden is enclosed within the curtain wall. While the ground is fairly level within the walls of the castle, outside it falls off rapidly. Only on the eastern side, where it is possible to cross to the Goffersberg (altitude: 507 m), is the slope less steep, forming a saddle-shaped depression.

===North section===

The north section is a group of connected buildings, consisting of the upper gatehouse, the remains of the northern keep and the new Landvogt&#x27;s residence.

The upper gatehouse, the only entrance to the inner bailey, was constructed in 1518, in part on older foundations. It is thought that this was the location of the 1330 &quot;Arburghaus&quot; which was destroyed in the fire. Above the doorway is a plaque dated 1596 combining the coats of arms of the Empire, the Canton of Bern and the von Erlach family, and naming &quot;Anthoni von Erlach&quot; as Landvogt.

To the east of the gatehouse stands the north keep, since the complete rebuilding of 1718–20 connected to the adjacent buildings. The gatehouse and dungeons were once located here. Of the original building only the west wall and parts of the foundation of the south and east walls remain.

The new Landvogt&#x27;s residence was built in 1672–74 on the site of a 1625 guardhouse and laundry. The neighbouring &quot;Landvogtei&quot; at the northeast corner was at the time no longer inhabitable because of penetration of the walls by damp following the construction of the east bastion. Today the administrative centre of the Aargau Museum is located here.

===Landvogt&#x27;s residence===

The three-storey late Gothic &quot;Landvogtei&quot; with its stepped gable was built in 1520. It served as a new office and residence for the Bernese Landvögte after the destruction of the previous building dating to the 14th century in a fire in 1518. In contrast to the other buildings, the Landvogt&#x27;s residence does not back directly up to the ring wall, but is separated from it by a 1 to 2-metre gap. The exception is a small round tower at the southeast corner; built in 1626, it replaced a protruding bay that served as an outhouse.

The pentagonal stairway tower which was attached to the façade in 1630 replaced a steep staircase within the building. Its original onion dome was replaced with a hip roof in 1760. The foyer still dates back in part to around 1460. On the first upper floor a gallery, constructed in 1565, extends the length of the north side.

From 1646 until 1894, the building was uninhabitable because of encroachment of damp after the construction of the east bastion. Renovation was only possible after the removal of the embankment in 1902. The renovation included a new façade facing the inner bailey. Today the building houses part of the Aargau Museum, with a permanent exhibit on the lives of the castle owners from the late Middle Ages until the 20th century.

===East bastion===
The bastion on the eastern perimeter of the inner bailey was constructed in 1642–46, replacing a curtain wall with battlements, to close the gap between the &quot;Palas&quot; and the Landvogt&#x27;s residence and protect the castle from cannon bombardment from the Goffersberg. The adjacent residence was covered by a huge earthen embankment which absorbed moisture and rendered the building uninhabitable. In 1659, a clocktower was built on the east bastion; its pointed roof was replaced in 1760 with an onion dome.

In 1893–94, the exterior wall was lowered by 6.5 m, making it possible to free the walled-up windows on the south side of the Landvogt&#x27;s residence, and to dry out the walls. A rose garden was laid out on top of the now lower embankment. During the comprehensive renovation of 1978–86, the last remnant of the embankment was removed and a basement level excavated, which now houses part of the Aargau Museum.

===&quot;Palas&quot;===
The &quot;Palas&quot; (residence of the Count) was built in 1100 as a 4-storey, 18 m high fortified building. Together with the adjacent tower, it is one of the oldest buildings in the castle complex. The entrance was originally on the second floor, accessible only by way of a wooden outdoor staircase. The main floor had a fireplace, the top floor had the sleeping accommodations, and the lower two floors were storerooms.

During the period of the Bernese Landvögte, the building was called the &quot;Kill&quot; because the torture chamber was located in it. In 1598–99 a new arched entrance was built on the ground floor. Between 1978 and 1986, the division of the floors and connection to the stairs were rearranged to make it possible to use the building for the Historical Museum.

===Tower===
The tower (also called the South Keep) is 10 m square and has walls 3 m thick. It was built on to the Palas around 1170 and used its west end as a boundary wall. After the death of Ulrich IV, who had ordered it built, the work stopped and the building remained incomplete for almost 200 years. It was only finished in 1344. During the period of Bernese rule, beginning approximately in the early 17th century, the gaol was located on the first floor; it can still be visited today.

To create more storage space for grain, in 1728–29 the tower and the neighbouring Knights&#x27; Hall, and the well between them, were joined with an unornamented utility building. This required the removal of the north façade, because the tower was not aligned with the Knights&#x27; Hall. In 1896, Augustus Jessup had the granary demolished and the tower returned to its original state. The well, first mentioned in 1369, was left in the open once more. During the renovation of 1978–86, the division of the floors and connection to the stairs were rearranged to accommodate part of the Historical Museum.

===Knights&#x27; Hall===
The construction of the Knights&#x27; Hall began in 1339 under Habsburg rule. Duke Frederick II of Tyrol-Austria intended to marry the daughter of King Edward III of England at Lenzburg Castle, and thus ordered a suitable Gothic residential building to be erected. However, the young duke died in 1344 shortly before work could be completed, and the walls remained unplastered.

In 1508 the western part was in such bad condition that it had to be demolished and rebuilt. In the eastern part the exterior walls were left standing, but the interior was completely rearranged here, too. The building received new rafters and several columns to improve its load-bearing capacity, and the walls were now plastered. The length of the building was somewhat reduced, as the exterior wall at the west end was rebuilt a little further east.

Around 1590 the building had increasingly declined into a large barn, with grain storage and wine pressing. In the same period, it acquired embrasures. In 1758, the interior was once more completely changed; newly constructed intermediate floors made it possible to store even more grains.

In 1893, the building was restored as far as was possible to its original condition. The intermediate floors were removed and the pointed-arched windows restored to the great hall on the upper floor. Today the hall can be rented for social events.

===Stapfer House===

In 1599–1600, a plain two-storey building was added on the southwest side of the castle complex, the &quot;Hintere Haus&quot; or rear building. It was created by uniting the stable and mill under one roof. In 1705–07, the building was lengthened on the east side to create additional grain storage capacity. From 1822 to 1853, the educational reformer Christian Lippe headed an educational institution at the castle which used advanced teaching principles for the period. In 1893 the granary extension was demolished and replaced by a reconstructed battlement leading to the upper gatehouse.

Today the rear building is Stapfer House, named for Philipp Albert Stapfer, a revolutionary and a minister in the Helvetic Republic. Since 1960 it has served as the Events Centre of the Stiftung Stapferhaus Lenzburg (Lenzburg Stapfer House Foundation), offering a variety of cultural activities such as exhibitions on current events.

==Aargau Museum==
The &quot;Museum Aargau&quot; (Aargau Museum), until 2007 the &quot;Historisches Museum Aargau&quot; (Aargau Historical Museum), includes in addition to Lenzburg Castle Hallwyl Castle, and since 2009 Habsburg Castle and Königsfelden Abbey. It also has a collection of approximately 40,000 historic artefacts, assembled from various sources: cantonal property, private collections bequeathed to the canton, public collections, purchases, and gifts.

Lenzburg Castle contains five sections of the museum:
* Domestic museum: An exhibit on the way of life of the castle residents from the late Middle Ages through the Renaissance, the Baroque era, and the early modern period until 1900.
* Armoury: An exhibition of numerous weapons dating from the Middle Ages to the 18th century. The most valuable items are two swords which were used in the Battle of Sempach in 1386.
* Faith, Piety, Art: Various works of sacred art from the Canton of Aargau.
* The Culture of the Banquet and Silver from Aargau: An exhibit on 18th-century banqueting with numerous valuable table settings and secular silver.
* Children&#x27;s museum in the attic of the Landvogt&#x27;s residence.

The castle is reached from the carpark at the foot of the castle hill via a footpath or a lift between the tower and the Knights&#x27; Hall which provides access for the handicapped.

<text>Buckner &amp; Garcia was an American musical duo consisting of Jerry Buckner and Gary Garcia from Akron, Ohio. Their first recording was made in 1972, when they performed a novelty song called &quot;Gotta Hear the Beat&quot;, which they recorded as Animal Jack. Later, in 1980, they wrote a novelty Christmas song titled &quot;Merry Christmas in the NFL&quot;, imagining sports journalist Howard Cosell as Santa Claus. The recording was credited to Willis the Guard (a character performed by Atlanta radio personality Bob Carr) and fictional group Vigorish. The song reached No. 82 on the Billboard charts. In 1981, the duo wrote a faith-based country theme to back the poem &quot;Footprints in the Sand&quot;, performed by Edgel Groves, which reached No. 1 on many Country and Easy Listening radio stations. The duo also produced an extended version of the &quot;WKRP in Cincinnati&quot; theme song released on MCA Records in 1982.

However, the duo is best known for their hit novelty song &quot;Pac-Man Fever&quot;, released in 1981 on a local record label, BGO Records. Shortly after the duo signed a record deal with Columbia/CBS Records and the record was released nationally. An album of the same name quickly followed composed entirely of video game songs. The single and album both received gold records for combined sales of over two and a half million copies worldwide. The duo later followed up that single with &quot;Do the Donkey Kong&quot;, which only made the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Charts, peaking at No. 103.

==History==
The duo&#x27;s intended follow-up to &quot;Pac-Man Fever&quot; was &quot;E.T., I Love You&quot;, which was delayed for release by the label in favor of Neil Diamond&#x27;s unauthorized &quot;Heartlight&quot;. They released a re-recorded version of the song on their 1999 album &quot;Now &amp; Then&quot;. The Starlight Children&#x27;s Chorus recorded a cover version on their album &quot;E.T., I Love You &amp; Other Extra Terrestrial Songs for Children&quot;. In 1985, Anne Murray&#x27;s recording of &quot;On and On&quot;, a song written by Jerry Buckner, became a top 10 hit on the Country/Easy Listening charts.

In the mid-1990s, Sony Music Entertainment declined to re-release the &quot;Pac-Man Fever&quot; album to CD for reasons unknown. To meet the growing demand for a reissue of the album, the band released a re-recorded version on CD in 1999. When the duo re-formed the band in 1999 to re-record the album, Danny Jones became the group&#x27;s drummer, Whitaker having died in the interim. Stewart returned as bassist; none of the other band members returned. The duo followed this up with &quot;Now &amp; Then&quot;, an album that included four new songs including a new recording of &quot;E.T., I Love You&quot;.

The pair continued to collaborate, including writing and performing on many original songs for the national restaurant chain Waffle House jukeboxes, several of which were released on a pair of albums.

In 2009, &quot;Pac-Man Fever&quot; ranked at No. 98 on VH1&#x27;s &quot;Top 100 Greatest One-Hit Wonders of the 80s&quot; list. On June 10, 2010, the duo released a song titled &quot;Keepin&#x27; the Dream Alive&quot;, with part of the proceeds being donated to aid the All-American Soap Box Derby in their hometown of Akron.

On September 9, 2011, Buckner &amp; Garcia revealed its new song on Whiskey Media&#x27;s Big Live Live Show: Live 2, called &quot;Found Me the Bomb&quot;, which is about the gaming website Giant Bomb. The song was made after an interview in June 2011, in which Jerry Buckner and Gary Garcia called in during a live Pac-Man tournament Giant Bomb was having. Ryan Davis jokingly said during a podcast that the duo should make a song about them and then to his shock one day he received an mp3 containing the new song. The song was distributed free on giantbomb.com and also appeared on the Rock Band Network.

On November 17, 2011, Gary Garcia died unexpectedly at his home in Englewood, Florida, at age 63. Buckner later worked with Jamie Houston to write the song &quot;Wreck It, Wreck-It Ralph!&quot; for the Disney film &quot;Wreck-It Ralph&quot; (2012).

==Jerry Buckner==
Following Gary Garcia&#x27;s death in 2011, Jerry continued on as a songwriter, keyboardist, and arranger. His songs have been recorded by Anne Murray (&quot;On and On&quot;), Bertie Higgins (&quot;The Wall&quot;), Bobby Vinton (&quot;The Wall&quot;), and Seiko (&quot;So in Love with You&quot;). He has scored original music for television and motion picture soundtracks along with jingles for a variety of commercial clients including Coca-Cola, Papa John&#x27;s, DirecTV and Waffle House.

In 2012, Buckner co-produced and performed the title track to the hit Disney movie &quot;Wreck-It Ralph&quot;, which received numerous awards including Critics&#x27; Choice for &quot;Best Movie&quot;, Annie Awards for &quot;Best Movie&quot; and &quot;Best Soundtrack&quot;, and was nominated for an Oscar.

Original members of the duo&#x27;s band consisted of Ginny Whitaker (drums), Larry McDonald (bass guitar), Chris Bowman (lead and rhythm guitar), Rick Hinkle (lead and rhythm guitar on &quot;Pac-Man Fever&quot;, &quot;Mousetrap&quot; and &quot;Goin&#x27; Berserk&quot;), Mike Stewart (Moog synthesizer on &quot;Mousetrap&quot; and &quot;Goin&#x27; Berserk&quot;), and David &quot;Cozy&quot; Cole (syndrum on &quot;Pac-Man Fever&quot;). Steve Carlisle and Sharon Scott provided background vocals on &quot;Pac-Man Fever&quot;.

<doc id="1017445" wikidata="Q1610051" url="?curid=1017445" title="Teddington Lock">
<text>Teddington Lock is a complex of three locks and a weir on the River Thames between Ham and Teddington in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames, England. Historically in Middlesex, it was first built in 1810.

The limit of legal powers between the Port of London Authority, the navigation authority downstream to the North Sea and that upstream to small headwaters of the river, the Environment Agency, is marked nearby by an obelisk on the &quot;Surrey&quot; (towpath, right) bank. The weir named Teddington Weir marks the river&#x27;s usual tidal limit and is the lowest on the Thames. This lock is the lowest full-tide lock and second lowest of all-tide locks on the Thames.

The complex of civil engineering or infrastructure in essence consists of a large long weir and three locks: a conventional launch lock in regular use, very large barge lock and a small skiff lock. The barge lock was made to accommodate long barges, steamers or passenger ferries and has an additional set of gates half-way to operate more quickly for shorter craft. The staggered structures incorporate two reinforced narrow islands. The upper island is traversed by and accessible by the lock gates or Teddington Lock Footbridge.

==Location and design==
The greater lock is against the general south (right, towpath or Surrey) bank of the river which is for 500 m north-east here; a middle lock being that most regularly used spans a long thin island which has lawns, places for boat owners to sit and a lock keeper&#x27;s cabin and short thin island which is a thin wedge of concrete and a broad canoe/kayak stepped portage facility.

The river downstream of the lock is the Richmond and Twickenham reach of the Tideway, a reach of semi-tidal river due to the fact the Richmond Lock and half-tide barrages limits the fall of water thereby maintaining a head of water to aid navigability at and around low tide.

Though the weir at Teddington Weir marks the managed river&#x27;s usual tidal limit, after prolonged rainfall causing very high fluvial flow, specifically at high tide, a higher limit of slack water (stand of the tide) causes eddies to arise as far upstream as the top of this reach, the next lock.

The large, bow-shaped Teddington Weir is against the opposite bank. A series of two footbridges at differing heights make up a structure which crosses the locks, the middle island that has the lock keeper&#x27;s cabin and the weir pool, Teddington Lock Footbridge.

==History==
===First lock, 1810===
The Navigation Act obtained in April 1771 by the Thames Navigation Commission did not allow them to build locks below Maidenhead Bridge, but from 1802, several plans for locks in the First District of the Thames, stretching from Staines to Teddington, were drawn up. Stephen Leach took over the post of Clerk of Works for the First District in 1802, following the retirement of Charles Truss at the age of 82. Just before his retirement, Truss proposed locks at Molesey and Teddington, each having a weir with long tumbling bays, similar to modern practice. John Rennie had suggested a series of long cuts in 1794, and Truss adopted the same idea. Rennie and William Jessop again proposed four long cuts in 1805, each about , but the Navigation Committee were thwarted by strong opposition from landowners.

Zacchary Allnutt, by then Surveyor for the Second and Third Districts, stretching from Staines to Mapledurham near Reading, suggested locks at Chertsey, Sunbury and Teddington in 1805. Rennie submitted new proposals in 1809 for nine locks between Staines and Twickenham; two would be without weirs, seven would require large weirs to be built. Finally Leach drafted plans in 1810, which he suggested were &quot;at once practicable and expedient, the least expensive, and the most likely to pass through Parliament without opposition and yet calculated to remedy the most prominent evils complained of.&quot; An Act of Parliament was obtained by the City of London Corporation in June 1810, which authorised construction of locks and weirs at Chertsey, Shepperton, Sunbury and Teddington. Each would be with the associated weirs having ample capacity for flood conditions. Rennie, Leach and the Navigation Committee visited the sites in July, to finalise the positioning of the lock. Leach then took charge of the work, which was undertaken by contractors Joseph Kimber and John Dows who also built Sunbury Lock.

Work at Teddington started in September 1810, but there were delays caused by flooding in November and December, and Leach awarded the contractors an extra £500. The lock was finished and opened in June 1811, but the weir was incomplete. The cofferdam protecting the works would need to be removed as river levels rose in the winter, which would have delayed completion until the following July, and so again Leach stepped in, awarding advance payments to the contractors, which enabled them to finish on time. The lock was further upstream than the present lock complex at the point where the footbridge now crosses. It comprised three pairs of gates as stipulated in the act. Total cost for lock, cut, weir, ballast and ground was £22,035 10&quot;s.&quot; &quot;d.&quot; () of which the land from Lord Dysart&#x27;s estate cost £282 10&quot;s.&quot; 5&quot;d.&quot;. The lock was, at first, highly unpopular with the local fishermen and bargemen. After attempts to smash it, the lock keeper was granted permission to keep &quot;a blunderbuss with bayonet attached thereto&quot; to ward off attacks.

===Rebuild, 1857===
By 1827 the timber lock needed considerable repair and in 1829 the weir was destroyed by an accumulation of ice. It is noted that in 1843 the lock keeper prevented a steam vessel from ascending the lock. At that time steam vessels were limited to travel as far (upstream) as Richmond. As originally built, the lock had timber sides up to normal head water level, and turf above that. The crest of the weir was above low water level at Teddington, but following the removal of the piers of old London Bridge (demolished 1831) in 1832, the drop increased to and increased to when dredging of the river was carried out. At tidally lower water occasional grounding of barges took place below the bottom sill.

Consideration was given to removing the lock altogether in 1840. However, it was decided to rebuild the lock and in June 1854 proposals included providing capacity for seagoing craft with a side lock for pleasure traffic. In June 1857 the first stone of the new lock was laid at the present position, the central of the three, opened in 1858 together with the narrow skiff lock. The boat slide, separate, was added in 1869 and in the 1870s the weir collapsed twice causing enormous damage. After the weir had been rebuilt in 1871, sluice bays spanned around , similar to the tumbling bays.

===Footbridges and barge lock===
The footbridges were opened in 1889 and finally the barge lock, the largest lock on the river, was built in 1904–1905. of the extracted gravel was used to raise the level of Cross Deep Ait, a former ait adjacent to Swan Island downstream, to protect it from flooding. The footbridges are Grade II listed.

===World War II===
In 1940 Teddington Lock was the assembly point for an enormous flotilla of small ships from the length of the River Thames to be used in the evacuation of Dunkirk.

=== 21st century===

Early twenty-first century renovation and improvement work in the area around the locks was undertaken as part of the Thames Landscape Strategy Teddington Gateway project.
In 2009, a local community group initiated a feasibility study for exploiting Teddington&#x27;s weir for electricity generation, inspired by similar community-led generation schemes; Torrs Hydro and Settle Hydro. The study was encouraging and the &quot;Ham Hydro&quot; project now proposes using three reverse-Archimedean screws with a total output of . Environmental concerns, notably those raised by anglers about the potential effect on fish populations, prompted further environmental surveys during 2012. The outcome of these considerations is awaited before the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames will determine whether planning permission is to be granted for the scheme.

==Access to and across the lock==

The lock is on the towpath on the Surrey side in Ham about a mile below Kingston-upon-Thames. Parking is generally over 100 m distant. The nearest road is Riverside Drive in Ham. Alternatively the lock can be reached from Ferry Road Teddington over the footbridges which cross the river there.

==Reach above the lock==

Located above the lock is Trowlock Island, towards the Teddington bank, followed by Steven&#x27;s Eyot in the centre of the river. There are then Kingston Railway and Kingston Bridges. After the river then curves sharply to the right with Thames Ditton Island towards the village of the same name. Finally before Molesey Lock is Hampton Court Bridge.

Despite settlements on both sides of the lock having formed part of London since the 1960s, the banks are still often referred to as the &quot;Middlesex&quot; and &quot;Surrey&quot; banks.

On the Middlesex (Teddington etc.) side of the river going upstream, the bank generally consists of homes and gardens/communal grounds up to and inclusive of Hampton Wick at Kingston Bridge; Teddington Studios, Lensbury Club, watersports clubs/a football club and the nature reserve at Trowlock are on the stretch. Above Kingston Bridge is Hampton Court Park, which stretches as far as Hampton Court Bridge. Half the Longford River, which feeds the water-features of Hampton Court Palace, runs out of a grated culvert opposite Raven&#x27;s Ait and below the Water Gallery. After Hampton Court Bridge (along the side of the weir stream) the bank adopts food/hotel use then residential use.
On the Surrey side is a consistent green buffer and towpath between the river and Ham/Kingston, widening to Canbury Gardens, until the high-rise town centre is reached. The town&#x27;s buildings switch to entertainment immediately south of Kingston Bridge. After the canalised mouth of the Hogsmill the riverside switches to a promenade with road by residential uses until Seething Wells reservoirs. Raven&#x27;s Ait is upstream of the bridges in the centre of the river at Surbiton, followed by a marina. Long and Thames Dittons&#x27;s riverside homes and pubs follow until beyond Thames Ditton Island. A riverside park and playing fields flank the mouth of the Mole until Hampton Court Bridge, near to the top of the reach, overlooking part of the Palace. Hampton Court railway station is before the bridge and just above it is Molesey Lock.

===Boats===
There are navigation transit markers between Kingston Bridge and Raven&#x27;s Ait on the Hampton Court bank, to allow river users to check their speed. A powered boat may not pass except in emergencies between the markers in less than one minute. The reach is home to at least five sailing clubs, five rowing clubs, two skiffing and punting clubs, the Royal Canoe Club and two Sea Cadet centres. Numerous pleasure boats ply for trade, London Riverboat services and chartered trips between Kingston and Hampton Court.

===Thames Path===
The Thames Path as its towpath follows the Surrey side to Kingston Bridge where it crosses to run alongside Hampton Court Park, before returning to what is traditionally (and in navigation use) termed the &quot;Surrey side&quot; at Hampton Court Bridge.

===Sinuosity===
The river makes an acute inside angle on this reach — Teddington and Molesey locks are less than half the distance apart by land.
===Sports clubs on the reach===

* Royal Canoe Club
* Kingston Rowing Club 
* Walbrook Rowing Club 
* Tiffin School Boat Club 
* Kingston Grammar School Boat Club 
* Kingston University Boat Club 
* The Skiff Club 
* Dittons Skiff and Punting Club 
* Thames Sailing Club
* Tamesis Sailing Club
* Minima Yacht Club

==Popular culture and the media==

The lock was the location of the Fish-Slapping Dance sketch in &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;.

In episode 1 of series 5 of the BBC TV police drama &quot;New Tricks&quot;, the villain is arrested at Teddington Lock.

Thames Television had its purpose-built Teddington Studios at Teddington Lock.

In a third-season episode of &quot;Murder Maps&quot; Teddington Lock was the location of the brutal murder of two teenage girls in the summer of 1953. The murderer, Alfred Whiteway was apprehended, found guilty and was executed in December 1953.

In Ben Aaronovitch&#x27;s &quot;Rivers of London&quot; book series Teddington Lock marks the limit of the authority between the old man of the river, Father Thames and the newer Mother Thames in the Tidal Reaches

<doc id="1017447" wikidata="Q652675" url="?curid=1017447" title="Johari window">
<text>The Johari window is a technique designed to help people better understand their relationship with themselves and others. It was created by psychologists Joseph Luft (1916–2014) and Harrington Ingham (1916–1995) in 1955, and is used primarily in self-help groups and corporate settings as a heuristic exercise. Luft and Ingham named their model &quot;Johari&quot; using a combination of their first names.

==Description==
In the exercise, someone picks a number of adjectives from a list, choosing ones they feel describe their own personality. The subject&#x27;s peers then get the same list, and each picks an equal number of adjectives that describe the subject. These adjectives are then inserted into a two-by-two grid of four cells.

In &quot;Inside Organizations: 21 Ideas for Managers&quot; (1990), Charles Handy calls this concept the &quot;Johari House with four rooms&quot;. Room one is the part of ourselves that both we and others can see into. Room two contains aspects that others see but we are unaware of. Room three is the private space we know but hide from others. Room four is the unconscious part of us that neither we ourselves nor others see.

== The four quadrants ==

; Arena/Open 
:The open area is that part of our conscious self – our attitudes, behavior, motivation, values, and way of life – that we are aware of and that is known to others. We move within this area with freedom. We are &quot;open books&quot;.
;Façade/hidden
:Adjectives selected by the subject, but not by any of their peers, go in this quadrant. These are things the peers are either unaware of, or that are untrue but for the subject&#x27;s claim.

;Blind Spot
:Adjectives not selected by subjects, but only by their peers go here. These represent what others perceive but the subject does not.

;Unknown
:Adjectives that neither the subject nor the peers selected go here. They represent the subject&#x27;s behaviors or motives that no one participating recognizes – either because they do not apply or because of collective ignorance of these traits.

== Johari adjectives ==
The participant can use adjectives like these as possible descriptions in the Johari window. 

*able
*accepting
*adaptable
*bold
*brave
*calm
*caring 
*cheerful
*clever
*complex 
*confident
*dependable
*dignified
*empathetic
*energetic
*extroverted
*friendly
*giving
*happy
*helpful
*idealistic
*independent
*ingenious
*intelligent
*introverted
*kind
*knowledgeable
*logical
*loving
*mature
*modest
*nervous
*observant
*organized
*patient
*powerful
*proud
*quiet
*reflective
*relaxed
*religious
*responsive
*searching
*self-assertive
*self-conscious
*sensible
*sentimental
*shy
*silly
*smart
*spontaneous
*sympathetic
*tense
*trustworthy
*warm
*wise
*witty

== Motivational equivalent ==
The concept of meta-emotions categorized by basic emotions offers the possibility of a meta-emotional window as a motivational counterpart to the meta-cognitive Johari window.

==Therapy==
One therapeutic target may be the expansion of the Open (Arena) square at the expense of both the Unknown square and the Blind Spot square, resulting in greater knowledge of oneself, while voluntary disclosure of Private (Hidden or Facade) squares may result in greater interpersonal intimacy and friendship.

<doc id="1017449" wikidata="Q5358448" url="?curid=1017449" title="Electronic voting in Belgium">
<text>Electronic voting in Belgium started in 1991 when two locations were chosen to experiment on different electronic voting systems during the 24 November 1991 general elections. The law of 16 July 1991 to permit this experiment was passed by an absolute majority with no opposition at all. One of the systems tested was based on a touch panel similar to those used in the Netherlands. The other system, still in use in 2004, is based on a magnetic card and an electronic ballot marking device with a light pen.

The experiments in 1991 were carried out in the Dutch-speaking municipality of Waarschoot (East Flanders) and the French-speaking municipality of Verlaine (Liège) during the general election of 24 November 1991.

In 1994 (European and local elections) the electronic voting experiment was extended to around 22% of the Belgian population. Every kind of voting area was tested: big cities, small villages, French speaking, Dutch speaking or legally speaking both languages.

In 1999 the system was extended to 44% of the population. However, due to lobbying from groups like PourEva and increasing doubt about the system, new tests were done and more controls were added. The most important test is the introduction of optical reading of paper ballots in two areas. This test was scheduled for 3 elections up to 2003 and was not re-conducted. The test was successful and gave no problems, despite this being the first election to use it. Optical reading of eVoting is Voter Verified Paper Audit Trail and guarantees the possibility of a human recount. The extra control introduced is the creation of an expert committee to monitor the electronic election process. That committee discovered the high dependency of the ministry of interior toward the vendor of the eVoting system.

In 2000 the local elections in Auderghem (part of Brussels) were contested in all available Belgian courts and the issue of legality of eVoting was raised before the European Court of Human Rights. The European court discarded the request without analysing the content.

In 2003 a new eVoting system was introduced to try to convince citizens that the system was safe. In the two locations that originally started eVoting, a &quot;Ticketing&quot; system was introduced. The principle of this is to add a printer next to the voting machine (magnetic card and light pen), and a paper copy of the vote is printed and approved by the voter. Once the elections are finished, all the paper votes (tickets) are counted and compared to the electronic result. In case of discrepancy, the paper version rules. The paper count and the electronic count matched nowhere, and it was decided (against the law) to favour the electronic result, which was considered more reliable. The law to organise this new test stated explicitly that this was for one election only.

In 2004, for the European elections, all the tests were ended and all 44% of the population already voting electronically did so with the magnetic card. Ticketing or Optical Reading were no longer used. Since 1999 no further locations migrated from paper to eVoting. The equipment acquired in 1994 was not supposed to be used in 2004; however, the government chose to use it for one more year.

As of 2024, electronic voting is used:
* In all 19 municipalities of the Brussels-Capital Region
* In all 9 municipalities of the German-speaking Community of Belgium
* In none of the (remaining, i.e. non-German-speaking) municipalities of Wallonia
* In 159 of the 300 municipalities of Flanders

==Reported problems==

In the elections on 18 May 2003 there was an electronic voting problem reported where one candidate got 4096 extra votes. The error was only detected because she had more preferential votes than her own list which is impossible in the voting system. The official explanation was &quot;the spontaneous creation of a bit at the position 13 in the memory of the computer&quot;.

One likely explanation for the error was a single-event upset caused by a cosmic ray, which the voting system did not protect against.

Furthermore, a sourcecode analysis of the DigiVote system in 2004 found several obvious errors with the security of the encryption keys, leaking of sensitive information, and lack of defensive secure coding practices. The voting system was also found to be vulnerable to a limited replay attack.

Note that DigiVote is a trade name owned by German-based company Brähler ICS Konferenztecknik AG (also spelt Brahler and Braehler in non German speaking regions) which manufactures battery powered radio audience response voting units for use in meetings and should not be confused with the ballot system used in Belgium.

<doc id="1017456" wikidata="Q592895" url="?curid=1017456" title="Koushun Takami">
<text>is a Japanese author and journalist. He is best known for his 1999 novel &quot;Battle Royale&quot;, which was later adapted into two live-action films, directed by Kinji Fukasaku, and four manga series.

Takami was born on 10 January 1969 in Amagasaki, Hyōgo Prefecture near Osaka and grew up in the Kagawa Prefecture of Shikoku. After graduating from Osaka University with a degree in literature, he dropped out of Nihon University&#x27;s liberal arts correspondence course program. From 1991 to 1996, he worked for the news company &quot;Shikoku Shimbun&quot;, reporting on various fields including politics, police reports, and economics.

Kōshun Takami was born . His new given name is a play on word on his original one. Hiroharu is a homophone of &quot;large spring&quot;. The author then adopted the kanjis 広春 (large spring) and used their on&#x27;yomi pronunciation to form his new name: Kōshun.

&quot;Battle Royale&quot; was completed after Takami left the news company. It was rejected in the final round of the 1997 literary competition Japan Grand Prix Horror Novel, due to its controversial content depicting Junior High School children forced to kill one another. When finally published in April 1999, it went on to become a bestseller, and only a year later was made into both a manga and a feature film.

The novel was translated into English by Yuji Oniki and published by Viz Media in 2003. An expanded English edition was later published by Haika Soru, a division of Viz Media, in 2009. The first manga also began being released in English in 2003, by Tokyopop, with the last volume published in 2006. As well as being critically acclaimed, the &quot;Battle Royale&quot; series has become infamous not only in Japan, but around the world and has earned cult status.

Since &quot;Battle Royale&quot;, Takami has not released any work.

<text>Caversham Lock is a lock and main weir on the River Thames in England at Reading, Berkshire. Both the lock and main weir are connected to De Bohun Island (colloquially known as Lock Island). The Thames Navigation Commissioners built the original lock in 1778. Additional sluices north of View Island and Heron Island form the whole weir complex. A footbridge, known as The Clappers, passes over the weir and all three islands to connect Lower Caversham to Reading.

The weir is upstream of the lock and in the mid-channel. Kings Meadow, Reading, and buildings comprising homes and office blocks adjoin to the south of the lock itself. The island contains a typical lock-keeper&#x27;s house, a crane depot, small boatyard, and large boathouse owned by the Environment Agency for occasional use by that authority and police in river patrol and maintenance of boats.

The head of water provided by the weir is used by Reading Hydro to generate up to 46 kW of electricity.

==History==

A weir, mill, ferry, and flash lock on the site were referenced in 1493 when granted to Notley Abbey. The pound lock opened in 1778, but the long promised lock house was not built until after 1819. In 1871 Reading Corporation planned to build a swing bridge over the lock upstream, but did not implement the plan. The lock was rebuilt in 1875.

==Access to and across the lock==
The lock is about 400 metres east of Reading railway station and well connected to Kings Meadow, the largest park of central Reading.

Access to the north is to part of the Lower Caversham neighborhood of the former village of Caversham (considered a Reading suburb administratively since it joined the Borough of Reading), and the route is open as a public footpath.

==Reach above the lock==
Soon after the lock, there is Reading Bridge followed by Fry&#x27;s Island in the middle of the river. The built-up part of Reading stretches 500m (on the southern side) to Caversham Bridge. A gangway spans from Reading to Pipers Island, with a restaurant that covers more than 75% of the gangway.

The northern bank passes by Caversham. St Mary&#x27;s Island is close to the bank at the far end of Caversham (seen on maps also as Upper and Lower Large). Further west of St Mary&#x27;s Island, Mapledurham House comes into view as the river continues almost northwards towards Mapledurham Lock.

Reading Amateur Regatta is held annually in June between St Mary&#x27;s Island and Caversham Bridge. Reading Festival is held on August Bank Holiday at Little John&#x27;s Farm on Richfield Avenue near Caversham Bridge. A temporary structure called Reading Festival Bridge links the site with parking and camping areas along the north bank open meadows during the festival. In these areas the Chiltern Hills can be seen in the background.
On the south bank, after the farmed meadows, is Tilehurst, where the river veers briefly north with the two islands of Appletree Eyot and Poplar Island in the center of the river. The railway runs adjacent to the river for more than 600 meters on a high brick embankment to enable it to cut through the end of the escarpment further upstream, on which most of Purley-on-Thames lies.

The Thames Path follows the southern bank. A footpath follows the north bank between Reading and Caversham bridges.&lt;br&gt;
There is an orphan section of the original towpath 1 km downstream of Mapledurham Lock, inaccessible except by boat.

<text>The Strachey method for magic squares is an algorithm for generating magic squares of singly even order 4&quot;k&quot; + 2. An example of magic square of order 6 constructed with the Strachey method:

Strachey&#x27;s method of construction of singly even magic square of order &quot;n&quot; = 4&quot;k&quot; + 2.

1. Divide the grid into 4 quarters each having &quot;n&quot;2/4 cells and name them crosswise thus

2. Using the Siamese method (De la Loubère method) complete the individual magic squares of odd order 2&quot;k&quot; + 1 in subsquares A, B, C, D, first filling up the sub-square A with the numbers 1 to &quot;n&quot;2/4, then the sub-square B with the numbers &quot;n&quot;2/4 + 1 to 2&quot;n&quot;2/4,then the sub-square C with the numbers 2&quot;n&quot;2/4 + 1 to 3&quot;n&quot;2/4, then the sub-square D with the numbers 3&quot;n&quot;2/4 + 1 to &quot;n&quot;2. As a running example, we consider a 10×10 magic square, where we have divided the square into four quarters. The quarter A contains a magic square of numbers from 1 to 25, B a magic square of numbers from 26 to 50, C a magic square of numbers from 51 to 75, and D a magic square of numbers from 76 to 100. 

3. Exchange the leftmost k columns in sub-square A with the corresponding columns of sub-square D.

4. Exchange the rightmost k - 1 columns in sub-square C with the corresponding columns of sub-square B.
 
5. Exchange the middle cell of the leftmost column of sub-square A with the corresponding cell of sub-square D. Exchange the central cell in sub-square A with the corresponding cell of sub-square D.

The result is a magic square of order &quot;n&quot;=4&quot;k&quot; + 2.

<text>Sydney Goodsir Smith (26 October 1915 – 15 January 1975) was a New Zealand-born Scottish poet, artist, dramatist and novelist. He wrote poetry in literary Scots, sometimes referred to as Lallans, and was a major figure of the Scottish Renaissance.

==Life==

He was born in Wellington, New Zealand, the son of Catherine Goodsir Gelenick and Sydney Smith, a pioneer in forensic science who later became a Regius Professor in forensic medicine at the University of Edinburgh.

He moved to Edinburgh with his family in 1928. He was educated at Malvern College. He went to the University of Edinburgh to study medicine, but abandoned that, and started to study history at Oriel College, Oxford; whence he was expelled, but managed to complete a degree. He also claimed to have studied art in Italy, wine in France and mountains in Bavaria.

In the late 1930s, Smith was introduced to the works of Hugh MacDiarmid by Hector MacIver, a literary critic who taught English at Edinburgh&#x27;s Royal High School. In a letter dated 1 November 1941 he informed MacDiarmid that he &#x27;gave up writing English for Scots&#x27; after reading &quot;A Drunk Man Looks at the Thistle&quot; (1926).

His first poetry collection, &quot;Skail Wind&quot;, was published in 1941. &quot;Carotid Cornucopius&quot; (1947) was a comic novel about Edinburgh. &quot;Under the Eildon Tree&quot; (1948), a long poem in 24 parts, is considered by many his finest work; &quot;The Grace of God and the Meth-Drinker&quot; is a much-anthologised poem. His &quot;A Short Introduction to Scottish Literature&quot;, based on four broadcast talks, was published in 1951.

His play &quot;The Wallace&quot; was broadcast on the radio in a BBC production by Finlay J. MacDonald on 30 November 1959. It was staged at the Kirk&#x27;s Assembly Hall in a production by Peter Potter as part of the 1960 Edinburgh International Festival, with Ian Cuthbertson in the leading role. The play was revived by the Scottish Theatre Company in 1985. &quot;Kynd Kittock&#x27;s Land&quot; (1964) was a poem commissioned by the BBC for television broadcast. Other works broadcast by the BBC as dramas or poetic dialogues include &quot;The Death of Tristram and Iseult&quot; (1947), &quot;The Vision of the Prodigal Son&quot; (1959), &quot;The Stick Up&quot; or &quot;Full Circle&quot; (1961), &quot;The Twa Brigs&quot; (1964), &quot;A Night at Ambrose&#x27;s&quot; (1972), &quot;Macallister&quot; (1973), and &quot;Gowdspink in Reekie&quot; (1976). Unpublished works include &quot;Bottled Peaches&quot;, a novel which draws on his life as a student in Oxford, and &quot;The Merrie Life and Dowie Death of Colickie Meg&quot;, a dramatic adaptation and continuation of &quot;Carotid Cornucopius&quot;.

As a young man, Smith&#x27;s ambition was to be an artist. While travelling in Europe in 1936–37, he made drawings in Switzerland, Germany, Italy and France. In post-war Scotland he made sketches of contemporary subjects and drawings to illustrate his poems. He also sketched and painted watercolours on trips to the Highlands with Denis Peploe and Sorley MacLean. Drawings collected by the architect Ian Begg were published in a book edited by Joy Hendry in 1998. Smith was art critic of &quot;The Scotsman&quot; from 1960 to 1967.

Smith was a member of the Scottish Arts Club and was associated with the editorial board for the &quot;Lines Review&quot; magazine.

He died in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh after a heart attack outside a newsagents on Dundas Street in Edinburgh, and was buried in Dean Cemetery in the northern 20th century section, towards the north-west. His second wife, Hazel Williamson, lies with him.

<text>Blake&#x27;s Lock is a lock situated on the River Kennet in Reading, Berkshire, England. It is on the short reach of the River Kennet which is administered as if it were part of the River Thames and is hence owned and managed by the Environment Agency.

==History==
The first mile of the Kennet from its junction with the River Thames has been navigable since the 13th century. Blake&#x27;s Lock was originally a flash lock known as Brokenburglok. In 1404 the Abbot of Reading Abbey, who had control of the River Kennet, made an agreement with the town&#x27;s guild to allow craft to pass through the lock between sunrise and sunset on payment of a one penny toll. By 1794, not much had changed, with John Rennie, the engineer of the Kennet and Avon Canal describing it as &quot;a very bad and inconvenient staunch lock&quot;.

The lock was converted to a timber-constructed pound lock in 1802 to improve navigation from the Thames into the River Kennet enabling boats to travel all the way to the Bristol area. The lock retains its manual beams (not the originals, new beams were fitted in 2006), so far avoiding the progress towards hydraulic power. The lock was closed during winter 2017-18 for work that included repairing and re-sheeting the lock gates and refurbishing the chamber walls.

==Riverside Museum at Blake&#x27;s Lock==

Next to the lock is the Riverside Museum at Blake&#x27;s Lock which tells the story of Reading&#x27;s two rivers — the Kennet and the Thames. The museum occupies two former industrial buildings, the Screen House and the Turbine House. Exhibits include a gypsy caravan and information about the Romani people, a medieval mill wheel, preserved turbine machinery, and seasonal art exhibits.

<text>Charles Richard Gough (born 5 April 1962) is a Scottish former professional footballer who played as a defender.

Gough played in the successful Dundee United team of the early 1980s, winning the Scottish league title in 1982–83 and reaching the European Cup semi-final in 1984. Gough joined Tottenham Hotspur in 1986 and captained them in the 1987 FA Cup Final. He then moved to Rangers and captained them to nine successive Scottish league titles. He subsequently had spells with Kansas City Wizards, Rangers again, San Jose Clash, Nottingham Forest (on loan) and Everton.

He won 61 international caps for Scotland and played in the finals of three major tournaments.

Gough had a brief spell as manager of Livingston. He is currently an ambassador for Rangers.

==Early life==
Richard Gough was born in Stockholm, Sweden, to a Swedish mother. His father (former Charlton Athletic player Charlie Gough), was from Hillington in Glasgow. Richard&#x27;s paternal grandfather was from Dennistoun. Gough&#x27;s parents met when she worked in London as a nurse. The family relocated in 1965 to South Africa where Richard grew up. He attended King Edward VII and Highlands North High School in Johannesburg. He began his career playing with the Wits University club.

==Playing career==

===Club===
Aged 15, Gough went to Ipswich Town before Gough signed for Charlton Athletic as an apprentice professional in July 1978, staying there a year. He returned to South Africa when enduring home-sickness play for Wits University for a brief period in 1979. He then had trials in Scotland with Rangers, Dundee United and Aberdeen. his trial with United was a reserve game away to Arbroath in which Walter Smith played left-back. Jim McLean signed Gough for Dundee United in February 1980. He played for Dundee United for six seasons finishing with 23 goals in 165 appearances. Gough helped them to the Scottish League title in 1982–83. Dundee United also reached the 1983–84 European Cup semi-final against Roma during his time at the club.

In 1986, Gough was sold to English First Division club Tottenham Hotspur for £750,000 He played for slightly over a year and captained the Tottenham team which lost to Coventry City in the 1987 FA Cup Final.

Gough returned to Scotland, joining Rangers early in the 1987–88 season, and became the first Scottish player to be transferred to a Scottish team for over £1,000,000. His debut was at Tannadice Park, in a defeat against former club Dundee United. He was named the SFWA Footballer of the Year in 1988–89. Gough remained at Ibrox until 1997, captaining the side that achieved nine consecutive League titles. He won 9 league titles, 3 Scottish Cups and 6 League Cups at Rangers. In all, he played 427 games with Rangers, scoring 37 goals.

In May 1997, Gough moved to Kansas City Wizards, in the United States&#x27; nascent professional league, Major League Soccer. In October 1997, he returned to Rangers due to injury issues at Ibrox. He resumed his MLS career with the San Jose Clash in 1998. He played 36 games in total in MLS, scored 2 goals and was named in the MLS Best XI for his 1997 season with the Wizards. Gough also went on loan to Nottingham Forest from March until May 1999, playing seven matches as the club was relegated.

After leaving San Jose Clash he linked up with former boss Walter Smith at Everton. He played two seasons at Goodison Park making 38 appearances and scoring once against Southampton. During his time at Everton he was made captain for the 2000–01 season and retired from playing in May 2001.

Gough agreed to play as a guest for Australian team Northern Spirit in October 2001, but had to withdraw due to injury.

===International===
Gough was also a regular in the Scotland national team in the 1980s. He made his debut against Switzerland in 1983, and went on to gain 61 caps. Gough played in two World Cups (1986 and 1990). He captained his country in the 1992 European Championships in his birthplace, Sweden.

Gough scored six international goals. In 1985, he scored the only goal of the game when Scotland beat England 1–0 at Hampden Park. He scored two goals in February 1989 in a 3–2 World Cup qualifier win away to Cyprus, with the second being scored in the sixth minute of added time.

His international career was ended prematurely however, after he was critical of coaches Andy Roxburgh and Craig Brown and withdrew himself from further selection.

==Managerial career==
On 30 November 2004, Gough landed his first and only managerial position with the then Scottish Premier League side Livingston. After a difficult season where the club battled relegation, Gough resigned and cited disagreements with the club&#x27;s owner over the budget for signing players as the reason. The club was also fined £15,000 by the SFA for a breach of transfer regulations over the signing of Hassan Kachloul during Gough&#x27;s time as manager although there was no suggestion that Gough himself was responsible for the breach of regulations.

==Later career==
Gough supported the Rangers Supporters&#x27; Trust and Dave King&#x27;s takeover of Rangers, and was appointed as a global ambassador for the club on 21 September 2015.

==Personal life==
Gough has resided in San Diego, California, since 1997.

<doc id="1017477" wikidata="Q3502290" url="?curid=1017477" title="Blonde stereotype">
<text>Blonde stereotypes are stereotypes of blonde-haired people. Sub-types of this stereotype include the &quot;blonde bombshell&quot; and the &quot;dumb blonde&quot;. Blondes have historically been portrayed as physically attractive, though often perceived as less intelligent compared to their brunette counterparts. There are many blonde jokes made on these premises. However, research has shown that blonde women are not less intelligent than women with other hair colors.

The blonde bombshell is one of the most notable and consistently popular female character types in cinema. Many Hollywood celebrities have used it to their advantage, including Jean Harlow, Marlene Dietrich, Marilyn Monroe, Jayne Mansfield, Brigitte Bardot and Mamie Van Doren.

==Background==
There are several aspects to the stereotypical perception of blonde-haired women.

In contemporary popular culture, it is often stereotyped that men find blonde women more physically attractive than women with other hair colors. For example, Anita Loos popularized this idea in her 1925 novel &quot;Gentlemen Prefer Blondes&quot;. Blondes are often assumed to have more fun; for example, in a Clairol commercial for hair colorant, they use the phrase &quot;Is it true blondes have more fun?&quot; Some women have reported they feel other people expect them to be more fun-loving after having lightened their hair. In much of the Americas, the blonde stereotype is associated with being less serious or less intelligent. However, an analysis of IQ data carried out by the National Longitudinal Surveys on a survey database of American &quot;baby boomers&quot; (NLSY79 data), the natural blonde women in this population category (excluding African American and Hispanic persons) have a slightly higher mean IQ than brunettes, black and red-haired women.

On the other hand, a blonde woman is often perceived as making little use of intelligence and as a &quot;woman who relies on her looks rather than on intelligence.&quot; At the same time, people tend to presume that blondes are less serious-minded and less intelligent than brunettes, as reflected in &quot;blonde jokes&quot;. The root of this notion may be traced to Europe, with the &quot;dumb blonde&quot; in question being a French courtesan named Rosalie Duthé, satirised in a 1775 play &quot;Les Curiosités de la Foire&quot; for her habit of pausing a long time before speaking, appearing not only stupid but literally dumb (meaning mute). The latter stereotype of &quot;dumb blonde&quot; is exploited in blonde jokes. In Brazil, this extends to blonde women being disparaged, as reflected in sexist jokes, as sexually licentious.

Alfred Hitchcock preferred to cast blonde women for major roles in his films as he believed that the audience would suspect them the least, comparing them to &quot;virgin snow that shows up the bloody footprints&quot;, hence the term &quot;Hitchcock blonde&quot;. This stereotype became so ingrained that it spawned counter-narratives, such as in the 2001 film &quot;Legally Blonde&quot;, in which Reese Witherspoon succeeds at Harvard Law School despite biases against her beauty and blonde hair, and terms such as cookie-cutter blonde (CCB), implying standardized blonde looks and standard perceived social and intelligence characteristics of a blonde. Many actors and actresses in Latin America and Hispanic United States have blonde hair and blue eyes and/or pale skin, such as Christina Aguilera and Shakira.

==Typology==

Annette Kuhn divides blonde stereotypes in cinema into three categories in &quot;The Women&#x27;s Companion to International Film&quot;:
* The &quot;ice-cold blonde&quot;: Kuhn defined it as &quot;a blonde who hides a fire beneath an exterior of coldness&quot;. She provided Grace Kelly as an example. English actress Madeleine Carroll originated the role in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;The 39 Steps&quot; (1935), with Kelly among those who would follow her.
* The &quot;blonde bombshell&quot;: Kuhn defined it as &quot;a blonde with explosive sexuality and is available to men at a price&quot;. She provided Brigitte Bardot, Lana Turner, Jean Harlow, Joan Blondell, Mae West, Barbara Eden, Marilyn Monroe, and Diana Dors as examples.
* The &quot;dumb blonde&quot;: Kuhn defined it as &quot;a blonde with an overt and natural sexuality and a profound manifestation of ignorance&quot;. She provided Jayne Mansfield, Marion Davies, Alice White, Marie Wilson, and Mamie Van Doren as examples.

In cognitive linguistics, the stereotype uses expressivity of words to affect an emotional response which determines a gender role of a certain kind. In feminist critique, stereotypes like the &quot;blonde bombshell&quot; or the &quot;dumb blonde&quot; are seen as negative images that undermine the power of women.

=== Blonde bombshell===

The blonde bombshell is a gender stereotype that connotes a very physically attractive woman with blonde hair. A review of English language tabloids from the United Kingdom has shown it to be a recurring blonde stereotype, along with &quot;busty blonde&quot; and &quot;blonde babe&quot;.

Jean Harlow started the stereotype with her film &quot;Bombshell&quot; of 1933. Following her, Marilyn Monroe, Jayne Mansfield and Mamie Van Doren helped establish the stereotype typified by a combination of curvaceous physique, very light-colored hair and a perceived lack of intelligence. During the 1950s, the &quot;blonde bombshell&quot; started to replace the &quot;Femme fatale&quot; as the mainstream media stereotype. Marjorie Rosen, a historian of women in films, says of the two top blonde bombshells of the time that &quot;Mae West, firing off vocal salvos with imperious self-assurance, and Jean Harlow, merchandising her physical allure for the masses, transformed the idea of passive female sexuality into an aggressive statement of fact&quot;.

===Dumb blonde===

The notion of &quot;dumb blonde&quot; has been a topic of academic research reported in scholarly articles and university symposia, which tend to confirm that many people hold to the perception that light-haired women are less intelligent than women with dark hair. It is believed the first recorded &quot;dumb blonde&quot; was an 18th-century blonde French courtesan named Rosalie Duthé whose reputation of being beautiful and dumb, even in the literal sense of not talking much, inspired a play about her called &quot;Les Curiosités de la Foire&quot; (Paris 1775).

While there is no evidence that suggests that blondes are less intelligent than other people, it has been suggested earlier that the state of being blonde probably creates opportunities that do not require investing in education and training. A possible earlier hypothetical explanation is that physically attractive women have less pressing incentives to cultivate and demonstrate their intellect to ensure their future, since physically attractiveness is an asset, or correlatively that intelligent women have less pressing incentives to dye their hair to a presumed attractive color. The purported validity of this explanation is purely hypothetical and has been corroborated earlier by its applicability to a similar pervasiveness of the &quot;dumb athlete&quot; stereotype. At the same time, newer data have shown that natural blondes have the highest IQ among white women, which is already explained by the scientists as possible greater incentive to intellectual activity in the place where the blonde grew up, which directly refutes the earlier suggestion that blondes have less intellectual incentives. The dumb blonde stereotype (and the associated cognitive bias) may have some negative consequences and it can also damage a blonde person&#x27;s career prospects.

&quot;Gentlemen Prefer Blondes&quot; (1925) by Anita Loos originated as a comic novel and explores the appeal of blonde women. It spawned a musical on Broadway, and two films released in 1928 and 1953. The &quot;Encyclopedia of Hair&quot; describes Marilyn Monroe&#x27;s blonde role in the second film as that of &quot;a fragile woman who relied on her looks rather than on intelligence—what some people refer to as &#x27;dumb blonde&#x27;.&quot; At the same time, in the film she demonstrates a certain amount of wit regarding her life position expressed in the song &quot;Diamonds Are a Girl&#x27;s Best Friend&quot;. Madonna emulated that screen-persona of Monroe in her music video &quot;Material Girl&quot;.

Many blonde actresses have played stereotypical &quot;dumb blondes&quot;, including Monroe (dyed blonde), Judy Holliday, Jayne Mansfield (dyed blonde), Carol Wayne and Goldie Hawn. Goldie Hawn is best known as the giggling &quot;dumb blonde&quot;, stumbling over her lines, especially when she introduced &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot; &quot;News of the Future&quot;. In the American sitcom &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; the blonde girl (originally Chrissy, played by Suzanne Somers, and later Cindy and Terri) is sweet and naïve, while the brunette (Janet, played by Joyce DeWitt) is smart.

Country music star Dolly Parton who recorded a song called &quot;Dumb Blonde&quot;, famously said that dumb blonde jokes about her do not offend her because, &quot;I know I am not dumb, and I am not blonde.&quot;

==Blonde jokes==
There is a category of jokes called &quot;blonde jokes&quot; that employs the dumb blonde stereotype. It overlaps at times with other jokes that portray the subject of the joke as promiscuous and/or stupid. Some blonde jokes rely on sexual humour to portray or stereotype their subjects as promiscuous. Many of these are rephrased sorority girl or Essex girl jokes, much as other jokes about dumb blondes are based on long-running ethnic jokes. Many of these jokes are mere variants on traditional ethnic jokes or jests about other identifiable groups (such as Italian jokes involving Carabinieri, Sardarji jokes or Pathan jokes). Similar jokes about stereotyped minorities have circulated since the seventeenth century with only the wording and targeted groups changed.

Blonde jokes have been criticized as sexist by several authors, as most blondes in these jokes are female, although male variations also exist. In fact, dumb blonde jokes are overwhelmingly female-specific: according to an extensive search in various publications and on the Internet, about 63% of dumb blonde jokes are directed exclusively at women (compared to less than 5% that directly referenced dumb blonde men). Research indicates that because of this, men report being amused by blonde jokes significantly more than women do. The fact that most of these jokes target the invariably dim-witted, and sexually promiscuous, women makes them even more sexist. In the 20th century, a class of meta-jokes about blondes (i.e. jokes about blonde jokes) has emerged. In a typical plot of this type, a blonde complains about the unfairness of the stereotype propagated by blonde jokes, with a punch line actually reinforcing the stereotype.

==Blondes versus brunettes==

In a 16 November 2011 article titled &quot;Blondes vs. Brunettes: TV Shows with Betty and Veronica-Style Love Triangles&quot;, media critic Tucker Cummings cited several TV shows that featured a &quot;classic war between blonde and brunette love interests&quot;, including &quot;The Office&quot; (where lighter-haired Pam Beesly competes with brunette Karen Filipelli for the attention of Jim Halpert), &quot;Suits&quot; (where blonde Jenny Griffith competes with brunette Rachel Zane for the attention of Mike Ross), and &quot;Dexter&quot; (where blonde Rita Bennent and brunette Lila West compete for the affections of Dexter Morgan, the main character). Typically, she wrote, &quot;... the blonde (is) stable, and typifies the &#x27;girl next door,&#x27; while (the) ... brunette, is haughty, and a bit more exotic.&quot; In Archie comics, Betty Cooper and Veronica Lodge have been engaged in a mostly friendly competition for over 70 years.

A number of studies have been conducted over the years to measure society&#x27;s attitude toward blondes and brunettes. Wortham, et al. have shown that more men find brunettes more physically attractive. A Cornell University study showed that blonde waitresses receive larger tips than brunettes, even when controlling for other variables such as age, breast size, height and weight.

In a 2012 interview with NBC News, Lisa Walker, Sociology Department Chair at the University of North Carolina said that hair color &quot;absolutely&quot; plays a role in the way people are treated and claimed that numerous studies had shown that blonde women were paid higher salaries than other women. In a study by Diana J. Kyle and Heike I. M. Mahler (1996), the researchers asked subjects to evaluate photographs of the same woman with &quot;natural&quot; (not dyed) looking brown, red, and blonde hair in the context of a job application for an accounting position. The researchers found that the blonde-haired applicant was rated as significantly less capable than her brunette counterpart. In addition, participants designated the female applicant&#x27;s starting salary as significantly lower when she was depicted as a blonde than when she was shown with brown hair.

A study that looked at the CEOs of the Financial Times Stock Exchange&#x27;s (FTSE) top 500 companies investigated how hair color could be a potential barrier to professional success. In another study by Brian Bates, two sets of MBA graduates were given the same Curriculum vitae of the same women split between two sets of attached photos - blonde and brunette. The brunette was considered more for a managerial position and for a higher salary. A 2011 University of Westminster study evaluated how men perceived women who entered a London nightclub as a blonde or a brunette. The study, published in the Scandinavian Journal of Psychology, used the same woman and had her dye her hair a different color for each visit. The results showed that, as a blonde, she was more likely to be approached for conversation than as a brunette. However, when the researchers interviewed the men who spoke to her, the men rated her more intelligent and physically attractive as a brunette than as a blonde.

==Counter representation==
At the same time, there are many examples where the stereotype is exploited only to combat it. The film &quot;Legally Blonde&quot; starring Reese Witherspoon featured the stereotype as a centrepiece of its plot. However, the protagonist turns out to be very intelligent and is shown to have been underachieving due to society&#x27;s low expectations of her.

Singer Dolly Parton, aware of this occasional characterization of her, addressed it in her 1967 hit &quot;Dumb Blonde&quot;. Parton&#x27;s lyrics challenged the stereotype, stating &quot;just because I&#x27;m blonde, don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m dumb &#x27;cause this dumb blonde ain&#x27;t nobody&#x27;s fool&quot;. Parton has said she was not offended by &quot;all the dumb-blonde jokes because I know I&#x27;m not dumb. I&#x27;m also not blonde.&quot;

The author of the comic strip &quot;Blondie&quot;, Chic Young, starting with &quot;Dumb Dora&quot;, gradually transformed the titular character into a smart, hard-working, family-oriented woman.

<text>Marsh Lock is a lock and weir situated on the River Thames in England, about 1 mile upstream of Henley Bridge in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire. The lock is close to the Berkshire bank, but accessed from the Oxfordshire side via two long walkways, the downstream one being near Mill Meadows. The first pound lock was built by the Thames Navigation Commission in 1773.

The weir consists of a series of iron watergates running from the lock to the Oxfordshire bank near the mills. It is situated between the two walkways.

==History==
The earliest record of a flash lock is in 1580, but the lock and weir existed for some time before that. The pound lock was the third downstream of the eight locks built after the Thames and Isis Navigation Act 1750 (24 Geo. 2. c. 8), and was completed in fir wood in 1773. Humphrey Gainsborough, a non-conformist minister at Henley Congregational Church was concerned in the building of the lock. He was an inventor and the brother of the artist Thomas Gainsborough. By 1780 the lock was reported as decaying fast, and in 1787 it was rebuilt of oak. The first lock-house was built in 1813. Positioned as it was on the opposite side of the tow path, the lock was considered &quot;Extremely inconvenient and dangerous for barges&quot; in 1814 and there are some indications that the flash lock was still in use.

In 1843 the lock was in poor condition and plans were drawn up to rebuild it on the opposite side of the river. However these came to nothing and the lower walkway was built about this time. The weir was rebuilt after 1879 but with some complaints about its unattractiveness. There were again proposals to move the lock across the river but it was rebuilt of more solid timber and reopened in 1886. The lock was rebuilt again in 1914. The weir was reconstructed in 2004 by Mowlem PLC to a design by Halcrow Group.

==Access to the lock==

Because the lock is unusually situated on the opposite side of the river to the towpath, a long wooden bridge was built from the Oxfordshire bank to carry the path out to the lock island below the weir, and then back again to the riverbank above the weir. This feature is unique on the River Thames.

==Reach above the lock==
At the lock and beyond it on the Berkshire bank there are steep hills, which give way to Wargrave Marsh, an expanse of water meadows, after the entrance to the Hennerton Backwater. At this point, Bolney Ferry used to operate across the river. The island here is called Ferry Eyot and it is followed by Poplar Eyot and Handbuck Eyot. This chain of islands lies off a range of large houses at Shiplake.

The river then rejoins Hennerton Backwater and passes Wargrave on the Berkshire bank while there is then open farmland on the Shiplake bank. The River Loddon flows in on the Berkshire side and the river is crossed by Shiplake Railway Bridge just below Shiplake Lock. The Wargrave &amp; Shiplake Regatta takes place on the reach downstream of the railway bridge in August.

==Thames Path==
The Thames Path follows the river on the western bank and then takes a diversion through Shiplake, rejoining the river at Shiplake Lock. This diversion arises because: firstly, the towpath used to cross the river at Bolney Ferry and return at Lashbrook Ferry a short way upstream; secondly there is no easy access to rejoin the path for the section between Lashbrook Ferry and Shiplake Lock.

<doc id="1017480" wikidata="Q1771989" url="?curid=1017480" title="Muslim Council of Britain">
<text>The Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) is an umbrella body of Muslim organisations in the United Kingdom, with over 500 affiliated mosques and organisations. It was formed in 1994 in response to British government&#x27;s expressed wish for a single representative body of Muslims it could talk to. It has been called the best known and most powerful of the Muslim organisations founded since 1990.

==History==
The Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) was formed in 1994 in response to an expressed wish by the British government for a single representative body of Muslims that it could talk to. The core of the organisation was made up of Muslim professionals who had worked under the banner of UK Action Committee for Islamic Affairs (UKACIA). Once formed, the MCB had ready access to parliamentarians and policy makers. Its views were expressly sought by the government, civil servants and media channels.

The cosy relationship with the government soured after the September 11 attacks, when the British government was looking to MCB for support of its participation in the war in Afghanistan. But MCB opposed the war, based on its affiliates&#x27; wishes, and temporarily fell out of favour with the government. Thus began a strange love-hate relationship between the MCB and the government, say Peter Morey and Amina Yaqin, which continues to this day.

Between 2001 and 2006, the MCB refused to send an official representative to attend the Holocaust Memorial Day commemorations. Threatened with derecognition and withdrawal of some funds, it sent representatives in 2007. However, after the 2009 Israeli offensive in Gaza, MCB reverted to its original policy, receiving renewed aspersions about its lack of commitment to multiculturalism and to tackling extremism.

In 2009, Daud Abdullah, the deputy general secretary of MCB, signed a declaration in Istanbul which called for a jihad in response to the Israeli assault on Gaza and endorsed Hamas attacks on foreign troops, including possibly British troops. The government asked Abdullah to step down and, when he declined, suspended its formal relationship with MCB. Following MCB&#x27;s categorical assurances the following year that it did not support attacks on British troops and that Abdullah&#x27;s signing of the declaration was in personal capacity, the government lifted the suspension, but not long before the Labour Party lost power in the 2010 election.
The Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition that came to power in 2010 tacitly reinstated the non-engagement policy, which continues to this day.

According to scholar Toby Archer, the break had been imminent since 2006. The 2005 London bombings showed the government that its existing engagement policies were not successful, and MCB&#x27;s channelling of the Muslim anger against British foreign policy, including the Iraq War, made it appear disloyal to the government. After the 2006 election, a new Ministry of Communities and Local Government was created; Ruth Kelly, the minister, started talking to alternative Muslim voices and came to the conclusion that MCB was not representative of the Muslim viewpoint in general.

== Organisation ==
The MCB is an umbrella body with 400 to 500 individual Muslim organisations as its affiliates, which include mosques and schools. The leaders are elected once every two years by the affiliate organisations.

Most of the affiliate organisations are small, but some are organisations of national prominence, such as the Muslim Association of Britain. MCB is said to be dominated by groups that have their roots in &quot;anti-colonial political Islam from Middle East and South Asia&quot;, in particular Pakistan, Bangladesh and Arab countries. According to &quot;The Economist&quot;, the Islamists from these countries held a big share of the top positions. Other commentators state that it was influenced initially by followers of Jamaat-e-Islami, a radical Islamist organisation in South Asia. But this influence is seen to be reducing, with younger British-born activists coming through.

The Secretary General from 1997 to 2006, Iqbal Sacranie, received a knighthood in the 2005 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours for his longstanding service to the community and interfaith dialogue. The current Secretary General, since 2021, is Zara Mohammed, a faith leader from Glasgow, Scotland.

===Funding===
The MCB&#x27;s core administrative expenses are funded entirely by affiliation fees from members, as well as donations from individuals and grant-giving organisations. The MCB also runs projects to raise the capability of British Muslim communities and to widen good practice. All MCB projects self-fundraise through sponsorship, donations or grants, and MCB does not have a central &#x27;pot&#x27; of money to fund internal or externally-led projects.

In 2005, the MCB received a project-specific £150,000 Government grant for a number of specific projects. These were: the MCB leadership development programme; the MCB leadership mentoring programme; MCB direct, a web portal for information on Islam and Muslims; a British citizenship programme; and the British Muslim Equality Programme. The MCB had requested £500,000 and was criticised for accepting even the lower actual figure because it might be perceived as threatening its independent status.

===Campaigns and projects===
* &quot;Towards Greater Understanding&quot; is a 2007 document produced by the MCB &quot;intended to be used, as a source of reference by schools when reviewing their policies and practices in relation to meeting the needs of their South-Asian Muslim pupils&quot;. The report claims to be an attempt at education because &quot;South-Asian Muslims are experiencing racism and Islamophobia both personally and institutionally through forms of marginalisation, discrimination, prejudice and stereotyping&quot;.
* Visit My Mosque day: Facilitated by the MCB first in 2005, this initiative encourages mosques across the UK to hold open days at the same time. In 2016 over 80 mosques took part, including mosques in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland; the figure exceeded 200 in February 2018.

=== Muslim women ===
In 2018, the MCB launched the &quot;Women in Mosques Development Programme&quot;, which aimed to train women to run mosques and other organisations and institutions through personal 1-1 mentoring and specialised workshops over a period of six months. Regarding the limited number of Muslim women on trustee or management boards of mosques, the MCB stated that &quot;the lack of diversity is unacceptable&quot;. In 2011, the MCB expressed that a woman not covering their face with a veil is shortcoming, and Muslims that advocate such behaviour are in jeopardy of &quot;rejecting Islam&quot;.

==Views==
The MCB condemned the 2003 invasion of Iraq as &quot;a massive disconnect between public opinion – including Muslim opinion – on the one side and the political classes on the other&quot;. The group condemns terrorism by Muslims and non-Muslims alike and has urged Muslims to help in the fight against terrorism. Nevertheless, though the MCB has unequivocally condemned terrorism committed by Muslims against Jews and Jewish targets both in Britain and in other countries, it has never condemned Islamic terrorism against Jews in Israel or in the Palestinian territories. Following allegations that police had wire-tapped a Muslim member of parliament, the Council said it was vital &quot;to hold to account the improper behaviour of senior police officers.&quot;

In 2004, the MCB criticised Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O&#x27;Connor, head of the Catholic Church of England and Wales, when he said that Muslim leaders were not doing enough to denounce terrorists who carried out attacks &quot;in the name of Allah&quot;, while clarifying that they denounced terrorism.

Following the 7 July 2005 London bombings, the MCB issued statements expressing its disgust at the events: &quot;All of us must unite in helping the police to capture these murderers.&quot;

In February 2006, the MCB urged MPs to vote for the House of Lords&#x27; amendment to the Terrorism Act 2006, which removed the &quot;glorification of terrorism&quot; clause from the bill. They stated that the bill was perceived as &quot;unfairly targeting Muslims and stifling legitimate debate&quot;. The bill was eventually passed without the amendment by 315 votes to 277. The opposition of the council to the clause and to British policy in Iraq attracted both praise and criticism. Sunny Hundal wrote in an exchange with Iqbal Sacranie: &quot;In order to defeat violent extremism, we must understand what motivates these people and what turns them into killers. What puts them in that frame of mind? The Iraq War alone is not enough.&quot; He also criticised what he saw as close links between the MCB and the Labour Party. Sacranie conceded that &quot;propaganda literature may well play a role&quot;, but emphasised: &quot;such propaganda can only be effective because of the conducive atmosphere we have helped create.&quot;

The MCB has co-operated with trade unions and issued a joint statement with the Trades Union Congress urging better community relations and encouraging Muslims to join trade unions.

On 3 March 2008, the MCB criticised the Foreign Secretary David Miliband&#x27;s response to Israel&#x27;s killing of over 100 Palestinians in Gaza as &quot;blatantly one-sided.&quot; It said, &quot;If we are serious about wanting peace, we must act as honest brokers, not partisan bystanders.&quot;

When schoolteacher Gillian Gibbons was jailed in Sudan for allowing her class to name a teddy bear Muhammad, the same as the Muslim prophet, the MCB condemned the incident as &quot;a gross overreaction&quot; and said the Sudanese authorities lacked basic common sense.

Following the fatal bombing of Manchester Arena in May 2017, MCB Secretary General Harun Khan condemned the attack, saying &quot;This is horrific, this is criminal. May the perpetrators face the full weight of justice both in this life and the next.&quot;

==Controversies==

=== Reservations ===
MCB&#x27;s claims of being representative of British Muslims have been questioned. Since 2009, successive British governments have maintained a policy of &quot;non-engagement&quot; with the Muslim Council of Britain based on claims that the group is not sufficiently representative and that some of its former officials have made favourable remarks about extremists in the past.

=== Holocaust ===
Between 2001 and 2007, the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) expressed its unwillingness to attend the Holocaust Memorial Day ceremony and associated events. In a press release dated 26 January 2001 the Council listed two points of contention that prevented them from attending the event, which were that it &quot;totally excludes and ignores the ongoing genocide and violation of Human Rights in the occupied Palestinian territories, in Jammu and Kashmir and elsewhere&quot; and that &quot;It includes the controversial question of alleged Armenian genocide as well as the so-called gay genocide.&quot;

Since 2007, the MCB has called for the day to be replaced by a &quot;Genocide Memorial Day&quot;. On 3 December 2007, the MCB voted to end the boycott. Assistant general secretary Inayat Bunglawala argued it was &quot;inadvertently causing hurt to some in the Jewish community&quot;. It drew criticism; for example Anas al-Tikriti said: &quot;rather than a mere remembrance of victims of one of the most heinous crimes in history&quot;, Holocaust Memorial Day has &quot;become a political event&quot; which &quot;glorifies the state of Israel, turning a collective blind eye to the immeasurable suffering of Palestinians at the hands of Israelis every single day.&quot;

===Sectarianism===
Historically, MCB has constantly spoken out against sectarianism. In 2013, the council signed an intra-faith unity declaration between a number of Islamic schools and branches within both Sunni and Shia denominations of Islam.

The MCB has been criticised by Martin Bright, among others, for failing to be truly representative. He said, in response to an article by Madeleine Bunting: &quot;any body that represents itself as speaking for the Muslim community must demonstrate that is entirely non-sectarian and non-factional. The MCB has consistently failed in this area and the Government should consider cutting all ties until it has thoroughly reformed itself.&quot; Bunting disagreed, saying: &quot;To the extent that the government over-relied on the MCB, it was due to the laziness of the government wanting only to hear one voice&quot;. She said it would be &quot;absurd to exclude the MCB, the biggest Muslim organisation in this country and the one that has achieved the greatest degree of non-factionalism and non-sectarianism.&quot;

===Homosexuality===
The MCB opposed the 2003 repeal of Section 28, which prohibited the &quot;promotion of homosexuality&quot; by local authorities, on the grounds that presenting &quot;homosexual practice as equivalent to marriage or in a morally neutral way is deeply offensive to Muslims&quot; and that a repeal &quot;undermines the institution of the family and will damage the fabric of our society&quot;. Yet, in April 2007, the Muslim Council of Britain issued a statement supporting the government legislation &quot;prohibiting discrimination in the provision of goods and services on grounds of sexual orientation&quot;.

On 3 January 2006, Iqbal Sacranie told BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;PM&quot; programme he believes homosexuality is &quot;not acceptable&quot; and denounced same-sex civil partnerships as &quot;harmful&quot;. Gay rights campaigners, such as Peter Tatchell, called for a &quot;dialogue&quot; between the MCB and gay organisations. In April 2007, the MCB formally declared its support for the Equality Act, which outlaws discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation. The journalist Brian Whitaker said: &quot;the Muslim Council of Britain has begun to move towards accepting homosexuality&quot;.

===Schools and education===
MCB guidance for schools says that parents of Muslim children should be allowed to withdraw their children from school activities involving mixed swimming, dance, sex and relationship education, music, drama, and figurative drawing on religious grounds. On farm visits, touching or feeding pigs should be prohibited. It also warns that pupils and parents may refuse to shake hands with the opposite sex during prize-giving ceremonies. The &quot;Daily Express&quot; newspaper referred to the publication as demanding &quot;Taleban-style&quot; conditions. It said music lessons were unacceptable to around 10% of Muslim pupils.

Based on information from the MCB, Stoke-on-Trent City Council issued a Ramadan guide to all schools. The document said schools should reschedule swimming lessons (to avoid swallowing water), sex education and examinations (as Ramadan can disrupt sleeping patterns and concentration) so they are outside the month of Ramadan.

===&quot;Jyllands-Posten&quot; Muhammad cartoons controversy===
When editorial cartoons of Muhammad were printed in the Danish daily newspaper on 30 September 2005, the MCB saw them as reflecting &quot;the emergence of an increasingly xenophobic tone being adopted towards Muslims in parts of the Western media&quot; and argued, &quot;We should not allow our valued freedoms in Europe to be abused by those deliberately seeking to provoke hatred and division between communities&quot;. At the same time, it said they regarded &quot;the violent threats made against Danish and EU citizens by some groups in the Muslim world as completely unacceptable.&quot;

===Istanbul Declaration controversy===
In March 2009, &quot;The Observer&quot; reported that people including Daud Abdullah, the Deputy Secretary General of the MCB, had signed what has become known as the Istanbul Declaration (not to be confused with the 2004 Istanbul summit) in January of that year. This was in reaction to Israeli military action in Gaza of December 2008 and January 2009. As reported, the Declaration implored the &quot;Islamic Nation&quot; to oppose by any means all individuals deemed supportive of the &quot;Zionist enemy&quot; (meaning Israel). At the time of signing, political leaders, including the British Prime Minister, Gordon Brown had suggested providing peacekeeping naval forces to monitor arms-smuggling between Gaza and Egypt.

Hazel Blears, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government in the UK, published an open letter saying the government would have no further dealings with the MCB until it distanced itself from the declaration and Abdullah resigned. Abdullah responded in &quot;The Guardian&quot; by describing her remarks as a &quot;misguided and ill-advised attempt to exercise control.&quot; He later said he intended to sue Blears for libel if she did not retract her letter and apologise.

===Islamophobia in the Conservative Party===

The Muslim Council of Britain has repeatedly demanded an investigation into Islamophobia in the Conservative Party. In June 2018, the organisation said there are now &quot;more than weekly incidents&quot; involving Conservative candidates and representatives. In an open letter, the organisation told chairman Brandon Lewis he must &quot;ensure racists and bigots have no place&quot; in the party. The Conservative Muslim Forum accused the Conservative Party of a failure to take action on Islamophobia and joined calls for an independent inquiry. In addition, 350 mosques and 11 umbrella organisations across the UK have urged the Conservatives to launch internal inquiry into Islamophobia claims. In July, the organisation repeated its call for an independent inquiry into Islamophobia and accused the Conservatives of turning blind eye to Islamophobia claims.

===Unfair media coverage===
In July 2019, The Muslim Council of Britain began to launch a &quot;campaign in Parliament for fairer media coverage&quot;. After viewing over 10,000 articles and TV clips, the MCB suggested that 43% of media clips portray Muslims with a negative association. In regards to Muslims, the British media &quot;tended to focus on a narrow range of issues and recurrent, negative types of characterization&quot;. The MCB also condemned the BBC drama series &quot;Bodyguard&quot;, stating that it &quot;pandered to stereotypes of Muslim women who wear the hijab as oppressed or subservient&quot;.

<doc id="1017481" wikidata="Q7561977" url="?curid=1017481" title="Sonning Lock">
<text>Sonning Lock is a lock and associated weir situated on the River Thames at the village of Sonning near Reading, Berkshire, England. The first lock was built by the Thames Navigation Commission in 1773 and it has been rebuilt three times since then. There is a weir a little upstream at the top of the island where Sonning Backwater separates from the main course of the river.

==History==

A weir at Sonning is recorded as belonging to the Blunte family in the 15th century. This was associated with the mill and fisheries and mention is made of a &quot;Locke-heise&quot; at this time. The flash lock was replaced in 1773 by the pound lock. This was the highest upstream of the eight locks constructed after the Thames and Isis Navigation Act 1750 (24 Geo. 2. c. 8). It was commissioned in 1771 but took two years to build. Fir wood was originally used for these locks, but this decayed very quickly and was replaced at Sonning by oak in 1787. Repairs took place in 1827 when the old flash lock was brought back temporarily into use. By this time a lock house had been built.

The lock-keeper from 1845 to 1878 was James Sadler, a poet and beekeeper. He wrote verses about the river and about bees, and is credited with the invention of the Berkshire hive. One of his works &quot;The Thames from Oxford to Windsor&quot; is a rhymed list of the locks, bridges and towns.

The lock was rebuilt in 1868. The weirs were reconstructed in 1898 and further rebuilding of the lock occurred in 1905.

==Access to the lock==
The lock is a short walk upstream from Sonning Bridge, which itself is close to the centre of Sonning. It is also accessible via a short footpath between St Andrew&#x27;s Church and the river. The path by the river continues into the town of Reading.

==Reach above the lock==

On the southern Berkshire bank, on the approach into Reading is the Thames Valley Park. Beyond the northern Oxfordshire bank are Caversham Lakes which include the Redgrave Pinsent Rowing Lake and the Thames &amp; Kennet Marina. Access to these is on the upper part of the reach, opposite the entrance to the River Kennet at Blake&#x27;s Lock. There is a bend in the river before Herons Island, View Island and Caversham Lock. Sonning Regatta takes place at Sonning in May, while Reading Town Regatta and Thames Valley Park Regatta are held further upstream in June.

There are navigation transit markers just downstream of the entrance to the Thames &amp; Kennet Marina, to allow river users to check their speed.
;Thames Path
The Thames Path stays on the southern bank all the way to Caversham Lock, crossing the River Kennet on Horseshoe Bridge, which is attached to Brunel&#x27;s Great Western Railway Bridge.

<text>The Popovtsy () or Popovschina () are a Christian group in Russia which originated in the 17th century. They were one of the two main factions of Old Believers, along with the Bezpopovtsy (&quot;priestless ones&quot;).

==Historical background==
After the reforms of Patriarch Nikon of Moscow in the 1650s, many members of the Russian Orthodox Church refused to acknowledge the changes which he had made to bring the church in line with the Greek Orthodox Church.

As none of the bishops joined the Old Believers (except Bishop Paul of Kolomna, who was executed), ordained priests of the Old Rite would have soon become extinct. Two responses appeared to this dilemma: the &quot;priested&quot; Old Believers (поповцы, Popovtsy). and the &quot;priestless&quot; Old Believers (беспоповцы, Bezpopovtsy). As opposed to the Bezpopovtsy, the Popovtsy recognised the validity of the priesthood of clergy ordained by the State Church, receiving them into their fold, creating their own ecclesiastical structure, which would later break into a number of smaller movements (e.g., those who accepted the priesthood of the Belokrinitskaya hierarchy, the so-called Beglopopovtsy who rejected this hierarchy, the Belovodskaya hierarchy, etc.).

The Popovtsy represented the more moderate conservative opposition, who strove to continue religious and church life as it had existed before the reforms of Patriarch Nikon. They recognised ordained priests from the new style Russian Orthodox church who joined the Old Believers and who had denounced the Nikonian reforms. Popovtsy have priests, bishops and all sacraments, including the Eucharist.

==Spiritual centres of the Popovtsy==

In the 18th - 19th centuries, the Popovtsy lived in communities on the Vetka Island on the Sozh River, in Starodub, along the Irgiz River, in monasteries of the province of Nizhny Novgorod along the Kerzhenets River, although they were scattered throughout Russia and even far beyond its boundaries. In the late 18th - early 19th century their spiritual centre was located in Moscow at the Rogozhskoye cemetery.

==Edinovertsy==

Around 1800, a group of Popovtsy, mainly merchants from Moscow seeking the abrogation of discriminating legislation which obstructed their commercial activities, offered to acknowledge the leadership of the Synod of the Russian Orthodox State Church, on condition that they would be allowed to use the old books and rites. They came to be known as &quot;Edinovertsy&quot; and are generally not regarded as Old Believers, but rather &quot;Old-Ritualists&quot;.

==Belokrinitskaya hierarchy==
In 1846, the Popovtsy convinced Metropolitan Ambrose Amvrosii (Popovich, 1791-1863), a deposed Greek Orthodox bishop of Bosnia (who had been removed under Turkish pressure) to become an Old Believer and to consecrate three Russian Old Believers priests as bishops. In 1859, the number of Old Believer bishops in Russia had reached ten, and they established their own episcopate, the so-called Belokrinitskaya Hierarchy.

==Beglopopovsty; Novozybkovskaya hierarchy==

Not all priested Old Believers recognised this hierarchy. These dissenters were called беглопоповцы (beglopopovtsy) and obtained their own hierarchy in the 1920s. The priested Old Believers are thus represented by two churches that have the same beliefs, but treat each other&#x27;s hierarchies as illegitimate. It is now known as the Russian Old-Orthodox Church.

==Modern situation==

The Popovtsy were hostile towards the October Revolution of 1917. For some time (in the early 1920s), the Soviet regime was rather tolerant towards the Old Believers as a whole, but in the 1930s, Old Believers too were subjected to severe repressions. Most of their churches were confiscated or demolished. During the Soviet period, the social strata which had been traditionally the backbone of the Old Believer population - peasants, cossacks, craftsmen, artisans, merchants and entrepreneurs, were practically extinguished. Nowadays Old Believers&#x27; churches are restored and recognized by the State.

==Popovtsy Churches==

The two churches of the &quot;Popovtsy&quot; are:

* Belokrinitskaya Hierarchy, also known as &quot;Belokrinitskoe Soglasie&quot;, and officially called Russian Orthodox Oldritualist Church, has its centre situated at the Rogozhskoe cemetery in Moscow. It is the largest popovtsy church in modern Russia. In the 19th century, the Belokrinitskaya Hierarchy was subject to a schism of Okruzhnyy Raskol.
* Novozybkovskaya Hierarchy, officially known as the Russian Old-Orthodox Church, former beglopopovtsy.

==The US==
In the 21st century, over 7,000 Old Believers live in the US, including members of the Popovtsy, with settlements in Oregon and Alaska.

<doc id="1017492" wikidata="Q673031" url="?curid=1017492" title="Wolf tone">
<text>A wolf note, or simply a &quot;wolf&quot;, is an undesirable phenomenon that occurs in some bowed-string instruments, most famously in the cello. It happens when the pitch of the played note is close to a particularly strong natural resonant frequency of the body of the musical instrument. A wolf note is hard for the player to control: instead of a solid note it tends to produce a thin &quot;surface&quot; sound, sometimes jumping to the octave of the intended note. In extreme cases, a &quot;stuttering&quot; or &quot;warbling&quot; sound is produced, as in the sound example. This sound may be likened to the howling of a wolf. A somewhat similar sound is the beating produced by a wolf interval, which is usually the interval between E and G of the various non-circulating temperaments.

==Stringed instruments==
The physics behind the warbling wolf was first explained by C. V. Raman. He used simultaneous measurements of the vibrating string and the vibrating body of the cello, to show that the warbling sound is caused by an alternation of two different types of string vibration. All bowed string vibration is “stick-slip oscillation”. One of the vibration types involves a single slip in every cycle of the note, but the other type involves two slips per cycle.

Frequently, the wolf is present on or in between the pitches E and F on the cello, and around G on the double bass.
A wolf can be reduced or eliminated with a piece of equipment called a wolf note eliminator. There are several types. The one illustrated is a metal tube and mounting screw with an interior rubber sleeve, that fits around one of the lengths of string below the bridge. The position of the tube must be adjusted so that the short section of string resonates exactly at the frequency at which the wolf occurs. It works in the same way as a tuned-mass damper, often used to reduce vibration of bridges or tall buildings.

An older device on cellos was a fifth string that could be tuned to the wolf frequency; fingering an octave above or below also attenuates the effect somewhat, as does the trick of squeezing with the knees.

While it has been said that Lou Harrison wrote a piece (evidently reworked as the second movement of the &quot;Suite for Cello and Harp&quot;) that exploited the wolf specific to Seymour Barab&#x27;s new cello, there is no clear evidence that this occurred.

&quot;Naldjorlak I&quot;, composed by Éliane Radigue for realisation exclusively by the cellist Charles Curtis, is in fact composed solely around the manipulation of the wolf note of Curtis&#x27;s cello.

During that time, Gordon wrote the band&#x27;s hit singles &quot;Seether&quot; and &quot;Volcano Girls&quot;. After leaving Veruca Salt, she released two solo albums, &quot;Tonight and the Rest of My Life&quot; (2000) and &quot;Bleeding Heart Graffiti&quot; (2006). She then rejoined Veruca Salt for their album &quot;Ghost Notes&quot; (2015).

==Early life==
Nina Rachel Gordon Shapiro was born November 14, 1967, in Washington, D.C. Her father was a law student at the time of her birth. She was raised along with her brother, Jim Shapiro, in several different locations, moving between Washington, D.C., and Madison, Wisconsin, before settling in Chicago when Gordon was a teenager. Gordon has commented that her parents had a turbulent relationship and eventually divorced in her childhood. Gordon attended high school at the Latin School of Chicago. While attending college, Gordon intended to major in music, but ultimately graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in art history from Tufts University. She is Jewish.

==Career==
===1992–1996: Veruca Salt formation and &quot;American Thighs&quot;===
Veruca Salt was formed in Chicago in 1992 by Gordon and Louise Post. Introduced by Gordon&#x27;s good friend, actress Lili Taylor, Gordon and Post quickly became friends and began playing music together. In 1993, they enlisted bassist Steve Lack and Gordon&#x27;s brother Jim Shapiro, a guitarist who joined as the band&#x27;s drummer as a favor to his sister. Gordon and Post both sang and played guitar on Veruca Salt&#x27;s material during the 1990s. The two were also the band&#x27;s primary songwriters, each writing their songs separately.

Veruca Salt released a self-funded demo tape and shopped it to labels while playing a handful of small club shows. The buzz around the band grew, and after only a few live gigs, the band was signed to Minty Fresh Records and began recording with producer Brad Wood, who had recently worked on Liz Phair&#x27;s critically acclaimed &quot;Exile in Guyville&quot;.

The band released an orange 7&quot; single for the song &quot;Seether,&quot; which Gordon wrote. The song was a distorted alt-rocker about an angry and misunderstood woman. Compared to the rest of Veruca Salt&#x27;s material, &quot;Seether&quot; sounded very pop. They sent &quot;Seether&quot; to radio, as it was the most radio-friendly song they had written, and the reaction was positive. It quickly became a hit on college and alternative stations. The album was not complete, and the band rushed to finish it before &quot;Seether&quot; lost its radio momentum. The song ended up peaking at #8 on the Modern Rock charts and became a hit on MTV.

Veruca Salt&#x27;s debut studio album &quot;American Thighs&quot; was released through Minty Fresh on September 27, 1994, and re-released on November 8, 1994, by the major label Geffen Records after the label signed the band following an intense bidding war. The album peaked at #69 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 200 and was eventually certified gold. The second single, &quot;Number One Blind,&quot; written by Gordon and Shapiro, peaked at #20 on the Modern Rock charts, but did not do as well as &quot;Seether&quot;. Gordon and Post were unhappy with the song&#x27;s video, and it was pulled after airing fewer than five times on MTV&#x27;s &quot;120 Minutes&quot;.

To support the album, Veruca Salt toured, opening for acts such as Hole, Live and PJ Harvey. They also headlined a club tour, after which they entered the studio with Bob Rock to record their second album. The band was inspired to work with Rock after hearing Metallica&#x27;s &quot;Enter Sandman&quot; over the house PA system before a Veruca Salt concert at an outdoor music festival. The band released an EP in 1996 titled &quot;Blow It Out Your Ass It&#x27;s Veruca Salt&quot; to tide fans over until their next album. It was produced by Steve Albini and contains the Gordon-penned &quot;Shimmer Like a Girl&quot; and &quot;New York Mining Disaster 1996&quot;.

During this time, Gordon also collaborated with other musicians on side projects. With Scott Miller, she co-wrote the song &quot;The Softest Tip of Her Baby Tongue,&quot; which appeared on The Loud Family&#x27;s 1996 album &quot;Interbabe Concern&quot;. She worked with James Iha on the Smashing Pumpkins song &quot;...Said Sadly&quot; (the b-side to their 1995 single &quot;Bullet with Butterfly Wings&quot;), and also recorded duets with Fig Dish and Triple Fast Action.

===1997–1998: &quot;Eight Arms to Hold You&quot; and departure from Veruca Salt===
Veruca Salt&#x27;s second album &quot;Eight Arms to Hold You&quot;, which was released February 11, 1997, on Geffen Records, proved to be a difficult and dividing album. Some fans of &quot;American Thighs&quot; were disappointed by the polished, hard-rock and distinctively Bob Rock production, in comparison to the laid back, indie buzz-bin vibe of &quot;American Thighs&quot;. The new album garnered mixed reviews from music critics, as well. Band members later admitted that the recording process for this album was more tense than the previous one, and the creative differences between Gordon and Post increased.

However, &quot;Eight Arms to Hold You&quot; sold well due to the success of the first single, &quot;Volcano Girls,&quot; written by Gordon. It was a catchy, power-pop tantrum that matched the success of &quot;Seether,&quot; peaking at #8 on the Modern Rock charts. The album peaked higher (Billboard Top 200 at 55) than &quot;American Thighs&quot;, but sales dropped off when the second single &quot;Shutterbug&quot; failed to chart, despite a high-budget video and &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; performance. Three more singles were sent to radio (&quot;The Morning Sad,&quot; &quot;Straight,&quot; and &quot;Benjamin&quot;) but none of them did well enough to warrant a video. The Gordon-penned &quot;Benjamin&quot; was released internationally as the third and last commercial single from the album despite having no video and no promotion.

After recording the album, Shapiro left the band and was replaced on drums by Stacy Jones. Veruca Salt toured extensively for &quot;Eight Arms to Hold You&quot;, opening for Bush as well as doing a lengthy international headlining club tour.

Gordon and Post then started work on Veruca Salt&#x27;s third album. However, the tension between the two soon came to a head, and after an argument with Post, Gordon left the band in early 1998. Jones left the band at the same time, and Gordon and Jones dated for the next few years. In 1998, Gordon sang on James Iha&#x27;s solo album &quot;Let It Come Down&quot; on the song &quot;Beauty.&quot;

===1999–2001: Start of solo career and &quot;Tonight and the Rest of My Life&quot;===
Soon after leaving Veruca Salt, Gordon demoed solo material in Boston with friends Kay Hanley and Michael Eisenstein from the band Letters to Cleo. Shortly after, she began recording with &quot;Eight Arms&quot; producer Bob Rock. The album, titled &quot;Tonight and the Rest of My Life&quot;, was finished in early 1999 and was set to be released by the Outpost Records label, owned by Geffen Records, in August 1999. However, the merger of Geffen Records with Interscope Records forced Outpost Records to fold, leaving Gordon without a label.

A few months later, Gordon was signed by Warner Bros. Records. &quot;Tonight&quot; was finally released on June 27, 2000. The first single, also titled &quot;Tonight and the Rest of My Life,&quot; did well on radio and was later included in commercials for hit films such as &quot;Chocolat&quot; and &quot;The Notebook&quot; in addition to an appearance on an episode of &quot;Charmed&quot;. The second single &quot;Now I Can Die&quot; did not perform as well, but the third single, a radio-only single titled &quot;2003,&quot; performed better despite having little promotion and no video. Gordon toured with David Gray as an opening act, and did a headlining tour with Paloalto.

&quot;Tonight and the Rest of My Life&quot; peaked at a disappointing 123 on the Billboard Top 200. However, it floated around the mid-100s for months, and sold close to 300,000 copies in the U.S. and 50,000 in Japan.

===2002–2011: &quot;Bleeding Heart Graffiti&quot; and career hiatus===
In the early 2000s, Gordon and Post reconciled via email, but the two did not work together professionally for years afterward. Post recruited new musicians for Veruca Salt, and the band released studio albums in 2000 and 2006 without Gordon.

After Gordon finished promoting &quot;Tonight and the Rest of My Life&quot; in late 2001, she took a break and began writing material for her second solo album. However, she did not get into the studio again until late 2003, and Gordon said it was because she wanted to write a lot of great material. To tide fans over, Gordon released b-side material from &quot;Tonight&quot; on her website and a demo for a song called &quot;The Time Comes,&quot; which was featured in the independent film &quot;Stealing Innocence&quot;. Around that time, she moved to California.

Gordon began recording her second album with Ethan Johns in late 2003, and via her website stated she was excited with the direction the album was going, even though it was very mellow and sad. Gordon finished recording with Johns in early 2004 and stated that she had named it &quot;Even the Sunbeams&quot;. A few months later, Gordon admitted she was unhappy with the album and she was not going to release it. The only song that surfaced from this recording session was &quot;Lighter on the Moon,&quot; which was available on Gordon&#x27;s MySpace page. In April 2006, Gordon said in the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s a really sad and really slow record. I guess that&#x27;s how I was feeling at the time, but when I sorta snapped out of that, I thought, &#x27;I don&#x27;t know that I want this to be the album I put out next.&#x27; It&#x27;s really a lovely record, but it didn&#x27;t have the spirit of the records I&#x27;ve made in the past.&quot; Some songs were re-recorded and included on her next album. The remaining songs were eventually made available free on her website as an EP titled &quot;Songs from Even the Sunbeams&quot;.

During this time, Gordon was performing at Largo in Los Angeles, for &quot;Bring the Rock&quot; nights, covering songs by N.W.A, Skid Row, Backstreet Boys, Phil Collins, and others. Her cover of N.W.A&#x27;s &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot; gained her popularity on Internet music blogs. She also wrote a song with Fefe Dobson titled &quot;Get You Off&quot; for Dobson&#x27;s album &quot;Sunday Love&quot; (on which Gordon also sang back-up), as well as a song for Courtney Jaye&#x27;s album &quot;Traveling Light&quot; titled &quot;This Is the Day,&quot; which she wrote with her boyfriend Jeff Russo.

Still seeing promise in the material from &quot;Even the Sunbeams&quot;, Gordon booked producer and long-time friend Bob Rock to record an album in 2005. In a few months, Gordon re-did most of the songs and recorded new songs, as well. The album, now titled &quot;Bleeding Heart Graffiti&quot;, was released August 8, 2006. The first song to see the light of day from the project was the b-side &quot;The Blue Hour,&quot; a half-French, half-English rock song that could be heard on Gordon&#x27;s website.

The lead single from &quot;Bleeding Heart Graffiti&quot;, &quot;Kiss Me &#x27;Til It Bleeds&quot; was released in mid-July. There was a physical promotional single for &quot;Kiss Me &#x27;Til It Bleeds&quot; and it contained the &quot;Bleeding Heart Graffiti&quot; album track &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Me Down,&quot; as well as Gordon&#x27;s previous hit single, &quot;Tonight and the Rest of My Life&quot;. Almost all radio stations received digital copies of the single rather than physical CD singles, however. After &quot;Bleeding Heart Graffiti&quot;, Gordon did not release any new music during the rest of the decade.

In the late 2000s, Gordon had two children with her boyfriend, musician Jeff Russo. Gordon and Russo later married.

===2012–present: Rejoining Veruca Salt and &quot;Ghost Notes&quot;===

In 2012, with Veruca Salt on hiatus, the original members – Gordon, Post, Lack, and Shapiro – met with each other for the first time since the 1990s. In 2013, the band announced that their original lineup had officially gotten back together. The band announced tour dates in April 2014 and released a 10&quot; single on Record Store Day. That year, they played several concerts in the United States and Australia.

The fifth Veruca Salt album, &quot;Ghost Notes&quot;, contained songs about the original members&#x27; breakup and eventual reunion. It was released on July 10, 2015, to favorable reviews.

<text>&quot;As the Stomach Turns&quot; is a series of comedy sketches parodying the soap opera &quot;As the World Turns&quot; (or its title, at any rate) featured on &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot;, with one installment airing on &quot;Carol Burnett &amp; Company&quot;. The sketch was created by show writers Kenny Solms and Gail Parent. &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; introduced the series during its first season in 1967–68 and continued to air new installments for the remainder of its 11-season run, through its final season in 1977–78. The final installment of &quot;As the Stomach Turns&quot; did not air until September 8, 1979, on a different four-week summer series titled &quot;Carol Burnett &amp; Company&quot;. This was the only installment of &quot;As the Stomach Turns&quot; that did not air on &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot;, which completed its run almost a year and a half earlier on March 29, 1978.

==Premise==
The sketch&#x27;s premise was to describe, in great detail, the problems of a woman in her 30s named Marian Clayton (played by Carol Burnett), who lived in the fictional town of Canoga Falls. The first installment aired on the 21st episode of the first season on February 12, 1968. As introduced by Lyle Waggoner, it was supposed to be the final episode of a 15-year long soap opera.

The sketch dealt with problems that were more likely to be seen on a soap opera than in real life, although many skits were inspired by popular television shows or movies. An example of the latter is a spoof of &quot;The Exorcist&quot; when Marian&#x27;s niece Raven (played by guest Bernadette Peters) came to visit her and was possessed by a devil, Marian assumed, because Raven was such a nice girl normally. Otto Blackflag, the town exterminator, now styling himself as a freelance exorcist (played by Tim Conway and using the same mock Romanian accent that he would use to play the character Mr. Tudball) exorcised the demon from Raven&#x27;s body. This same sort of plot was eventually done, in all seriousness, on &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; decades later.

Another movie parody saw Marian meet the bedraggled &quot;Richard Dryface,&quot; played by guest Steve Martin in a spoof of &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot;, complete with a grey, bulbous-headed alien played by Conway.

The sketch also touched on stereotypical aspects of production values in American soaps. Many times, Marian forgot what she wanted to say, reminiscent of the times when soap operas were broadcast live and actors routinely forgot their next line. The &quot;soap&#x27;s sound effects people&quot; would frequently either miss their cues to ring Marian&#x27;s doorbell or telephone, or they would ring them too soon, leaving &quot;the actress playing Marian&quot; high and dry to the point that, after multiple times of trying to hint that she was waiting for a sound effect and getting complete silence, she was forced to answer her door or the phone before they rang (after which the sound effect would finally be heard––at the completely wrong time) in order to keep the plot moving. On live soap opera productions, these were big problems; due to the live nature of the show, they happened fairly frequently and were subsequently spoofed at length on &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot;.

In addition to the missed cues, the sketch was notorious for overusing loud and plangent organ music, a reference to a time when soap operas would have in-house organists play dramatic music as well as the show&#x27;s theme song (when this skit first ran, organ music was still in wide use on the serials). Organ music was eventually discontinued in the mid-1970s, around the time &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; wrapped up its run, so when the sketch is seen in syndication today, it brings back a sense of production technique that is now seen by many younger soap viewers as archaic and outdated.

One of the sketch&#x27;s recurring characters is Marian&#x27;s &quot;ne&#x27;er-do-well&quot; daughter (played by Vicki Lawrence) who arrives at the door holding a baby (a doll), usually says &quot;Don&#x27;t you recognize me mother? I&#x27;m your daughter,&quot; then leaves after giving the baby to Marian who immediately stashes it in the umbrella stand. This was a parody of the fact that traditional soap operas have little use for child characters, either dropping them from the plot line shortly after they are introduced or unnaturally aging them into adulthood or, more recently, into the teenage years (for example, a young character might be sent upstairs to put on his or her shoes and never be referred to again).

The sketch also marks the first appearances of Harvey Korman&#x27;s Mother Marcus character, who had also become a recurring resident of Canoga Falls, as well as Tim Conway&#x27;s Oldest Man character, who within the confines of the series, played several characters, including Marian&#x27;s grandfather, her Uncle Waldo, insurance agent Duane Toddleberry, and obscene phone caller Marvin Peterson Jr.

The sketch was famous for the parody ending in which the announcer would ask foreboding, progressively nonsensical questions about the characters while focusing on their puzzled reactions.

==Trivia==
* In her 1996 memoir, &quot;As My World Still Turns&quot;, actress Eileen Fulton, who has starred on the CBS soap &quot;As the World Turns&quot; for over four decades, claimed credit for coming up with the concept for &quot;As the Stomach Turns&quot;. Fulton stated that when she was contacted to be a guest star on &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot;, she suggested a parody of a soap called &quot;As the Stomach Turns&quot;. Ultimately Fulton ended up not appearing on the show, but the &quot;Stomach Turns&quot; sketch did.
* Cher appeared on an episode of &quot;As the Stomach Turns&quot; as Pocahontas Pirelli, &quot;the town half-breed: half-Indian, and half-dressed,&quot; which was a play on her hit song of the time, &quot;Half-Breed.&quot; She came in wearing a Native American headdress and a bikini top.
* In an early sketch, Carol Burnett opens the door to find Harvey Korman as Mother Marcus for the character&#x27;s first appearance on the show. When rehearsing the sketch, Korman never appeared in costume but spoke in the voice. When Burnett opened the door in dress rehearsal it was the first time she had actually seen him dressed up as the character. Burnett&#x27;s reaction (pausing, struggling to regain her composure before slamming the door in his face, then cracking up when she opened the door again (with Harvey holding Mother Marcus&#x27; chest that had been &quot;hit by the door&quot;) to move the script along) was completely genuine.
* In addition to Mother Marcus, several other characters who appeared at the door and had it slammed in their faces also held their noses or foreheads when the door reopened.
* In &quot;Hot in Cleveland,&quot; season 4, episode 14, Canoga Falls is revealed to be Victoria Chase’s hometown. Carol Burnett guest star as Victoria’s mother, who Victoria (Wendie Malick) hasn’t visited in twelve years. The episode reunites Carol Burnett with Betty White, who often guest starred on Carol Burnett’s variety show and was in the last installment of “As the Stomach Turns” on &quot;The Carol Burnett Show.&quot;

<text>Umeå ( , , , ; ; ; ; ) is a city in northeast Sweden. It is the seat of Umeå Municipality and the capital of Västerbotten County.

Situated on the Ume River, Umeå is the largest locality in Norrland and the thirteenth largest in Sweden, with a wider municipal population of 132,235 inhabitants in the beginning of 2023. When Umeå University was established in 1965, growth accelerated, and the amount of housing has doubled in 30 years from 1980 to 2010. , Umeå was gaining around 1,000 inhabitants per year and the municipality plans for having 200,000 inhabitants by 2050. The projection of municipality size in 2050 has, however, been questioned as an overestimation in an independent study.

Umeå is a university town and centre of education, technical and medical research in northern Sweden. The two universities located in the city, Umeå University and one of the 3 main branches of SLU, host around 40,000 enrolled students, which corresponds to around 30% of the total population. CRISPR gene editing was developed by researchers, headed by Emmanuelle Charpentier at Umeå University, being awarded the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Umeå was the European Capital of Culture during 2014, along with Riga in Latvia. Umeå is certified by the EarthCheck Sustainable Destinations program.

Consulates from ten countries can be found in Umeå (2021): Denmark (from 1848), Finland (from 1921), France (from 1989), Iceland (from 2002), Italy (from 2012), Latvia (1939–1940; again from 2014), Lithuania (from 2012), Norway (from 1963), and the Republic of Seychelles (from 2001).

Umeå has been the home of Rally Sweden since 2022.

== History ==
People have lived in the Umeå river valley for at least three thousand years. The oldest rock carvings near Umeå, ten kilometers west of the city at Norrforsen, are from about 3,000 BCE. In some places, there are remains of settlements and cultivation from the Bronze Age to the 11th century. During that period, the climate was mild, allowing for the cultivation of barley and wheat, while moose and beaver were hunted further inland.

The first written mention of Umeå dates from the 14th century. Before this time, the northern parts of Sweden, including the counties of Västerbotten and Norrbotten, were mostly settled by nomadic Sami people, though there is no evidence of a permanent settlement at the exact location of the city. The name is believed to derive from the Old Norse word &quot;Úma,&quot; meaning &#x27;roaring&#x27;. The name of the town would therefore mean &quot;The Roaring River&quot;.

The coast was permanently settled by Germanic peoples who traveled north along the Bothnian Bay by boat, which explains the Germanic names of towns and villages along the coast. Southern Västerbotten (including Umeå and Skellefteå) has had permanent Germanic settlements since at least the 14th century, and possibly since the Viking Age, or even earlier.

Umeå initially developed as a parish, with a wooden church and a trading post located in what is now known as Backen (or Kyrkbacken). Its location near the coast and by a river was probably one of the reasons that people chose to settle there.

For the next few centuries, Umeå remained a collection of scattered parishes where merchandise originating from the Sami people was traded. It was the last inhabited area before the northern wilderness. However, no proper town was built at the location selected by the king, and Umeå lost its town privileges in the 1590s.

In 1622, Gustavus Adolphus re-established the town. By 1638, it had about 40 houses. It suffered from Russian attacks in 1714 and in 1720, when it was burnt to the ground during the Russian Pillage of 1719–21. At the close of the Finnish War in 1809, a Russian army under Michael Andreas Barclay de Tolly captured Umeå and occupied it from June to August.

In 1874, the town plans were improved following a government mandate. Umeå had already begun making structural changes when, on 25 June 1888, a fire devastated the eastern parts of the town, leaving at least 2,300 of its 3,000 inhabitants homeless. During the restoration, almost 3,000 silver birch trees were planted along wide avenues to prevent future fires from spreading. For this reason Umeå is sometimes known as &quot;Björkarnas Stad&quot;, the &quot;City of Birches&quot;. The name of the Umeå ice-hockey team, Björklöven, translates to &quot;The Birch Leaves&quot;.

== Geography ==

Umeå is situated on the inlet of the Gulf of Bothnia at the mouth of the Ume River, in the south of Västerbotten. Umeå is about north of Stockholm and about south of the Arctic Circle. It is the largest city north of the Stockholm-Uppsala region, and is sometimes referred to as the regional centre of northern Sweden.

The nearby community of Holmsund serves as Umeå&#x27;s port, with a ferry line connecting it to Vaasa () in Finland. This close connection to Finland influences Umeå’s population, with many Sweden Finns residing in the city.

== Demography ==

The population of Umeå has grown consistently since the 1960s, when the university was built. In part because of the university, the town has attracted many residents from outside of Sweden, as well as students from other regions of Sweden.

As of 2015, 10.4% of the population in the municipality of Umeå were foreign-born. The largest national origin group is from Finland, followed by Iraq, Iran and Somalia.

In April 2017 the Jewish association in Umeå closed after receiving multiple threats from neo-Nazis, allegedly associated with the Nordic Resistance Movement.

The Bothnia Line (&quot;Botniabanan&quot;) connects to Umeå from the south, it runs along the High Coast via Örnsköldsvik to Umeå. This railway was opened on 28 August 2010. The new railway line is long, containing 140 bridges and of tunnels. It provides Umeå with a fast train connection to Stockholm ( hours). A new railway station, Umeå East Station, was built in connection to Norrland&#x27;s University Hospital and Umeå University.

The Wasaline ferry takes four hours to arrive in Vaasa, Finland.

Umeå is located along the Blue Highway, which is an international tourist route from Mo i Rana, Norway to Pudozh, Russia via Finland.

== Culture ==
The Opera of northern Sweden, the Norrland Opera, is based in the city, as is the English-language non-profit Umeå Theatre Company and the Museum of Contemporary Art and Visual Culture. The annual Umeå Jazz Festival is one of the larger Scandinavian festivals for modern jazz.

Well-known metal bands from Umeå include Cult of Luna, Gotham City, Hollow, Meshuggah, Mexicoma, Nocturnal Rites and Persuader. During the 1990s, the influence of Umeå hardcore punk bands such as Final Exit, Step Forward, Refused, Abhinanda, Shield and Doughnuts and the local labels Desperate Fight Records and Busted Heads Records led to the growth of Umeå&#x27;s hardcore scene. Independent record label Ny Våg is headquartered in Umeå, and have released records of Umeå artists such as AC4, Masshysteri and Invasionen.

In 2009 the town was designated European Capital of Culture for 2014, along with Riga.

Umeå is the centre of television in northern Sweden; SVT Nord and TV4&#x27;s northern region office are both based in the city. The main newspapers of the county of Västerbotten, Västerbottens-Kuriren and Västerbottens Folkblad are also based in Umeå.

The background and setting for the video game &quot;Unravel&quot; are based on landscapes around Umeå.

== Sports ==

The city of Umeå currently hosts four major sports clubs. The women&#x27;s football club is Umeå IK. The men&#x27;s hockey team IF Björklöven was very successful in the 1980s but has been less successful in recent years. Björklöven are currently playing in the Swedish second-tier league HockeyAllsvenskan while Umeå IK plays in the top Swedish women&#x27;s football league Damallsvenskan. IBK Dalen and IKSU are among the major floorball teams in Sweden; both teams has been in the Swedish Championships finals two years in a row ().

Umea is also the host city of the FIA World Rally Championship&#x27;s Rally Sweden. In 2021 it was announced that Rally Sweden would relocate to the northern Swedish city of Umeå after being held in the province of Värmland since its foundation. The primary reason for its relocation was that Umeå is considered a more snow safe region

== Education and research ==
Umeå University has about 37,000 students and 4,200 staff. The establishment of the university in the mid-1960s led to a population expansion from about 50,000 inhabitants to today&#x27;s 121,032. The expansion continues, with about 1100 new inhabitants every year, and has made Umeå a modern, somewhat intellectual city to add to the traditional basis of heavy industry for cities along the coast of northern Sweden (Norrland). In 1951 the university&#x27;s library was recognised as important for northern Sweden. The library is given a copy of every new book printed in Sweden. 

The Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences or &quot;Sveriges Lantbruksuniversitet&quot; is a university in Sweden. Although its head office is located in Uppsala (Ultuna), the university has several campuses in different parts of Sweden, including Umeå. Unlike other government-run universities in Sweden, it is funded through the budget for the Ministry of Enterprise and Innovation.

The university hospital serves the entire region of northern Sweden.

== Economy ==
Key research fields of the University are life sciences (especially medical and cell and the molecular biology of plants), human-technology interaction, social welfare, ecology and gender perspectives.

The Umeå University works collaboratively with companies such as ABB, Volvo, Skanska, Ericsson, and Öhrlings PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC).

The Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU) in Umeå, with Umeå Plant Science Centre, is another major site of research and education.

<text>Sollefteå () is a locality and the seat of Sollefteå Municipality in Västernorrland County, Sweden.

==History==

The earliest written account on Sollefteå is found in a script dating back to 1270. During this time the name of the village was given as De Solatum - a name that can be interpreted as a composition of &quot;Sol&quot; (sun) and &quot;at&quot; (property) i.e. literally The sunlit region. &quot;De Solatum&quot; also can be interpreted as desolation, which means loneliness or remoteness (see Remote and isolated community).

With Sollefteå being located at the lowest rapids of the Ångermanälven thereby making it the last outpost to which it was possible to sail. The village developed into a municipality. The town changed from a commercial town into a town dominated by the military when the two regiments T 3 (Logistics) and I 21 (Infantry) were located there in 1898 and 1911 respectively.

In 1902 Sollefteå obtained the status of market town or &quot;köping&quot; before finally being granted a town charter in 1917 thereby making it a city.

It is now the seat of the much larger Sollefteå Municipality. Sollefteå is, despite its small population, for historical reasons normally still referred to as a &quot;city&quot;. 

== Notable buildings ==

=== The pharmacy ===

The pharmacy building was erected in 1889. It is a brick building, two and a half storeys high. The style of the building is influenced by the late 19th-century architectural style and is dominated by the neo-Gothic style. The house was designed by the architect Niclas Wahrgren.

The many various architectural styles represented in the building is seen in the medieval inspired crenellated corner tower, Norman arches, North German gothic styles, blind windows with pointed arches and portico supported by columns. There are also renaissance elements in the design, for example the staircase&#x27;s orientalic/antique and geometric mosaics with meanders. The overall style of the building is reminiscent of the palatial buildings erected on Strandvägen in Stockholm and in the Stenstaden in Sundsvall at the same time.

In 1984, the building was declared a historic building and thereby protected from demolition or major alterations. It is today the home of the local library as well as the city&#x27;s museum.

=== Hotel Appelbergs ===

The hotel is located in the centre of Sollefteå, along the pedestrian district. It is also the oldest hotel in the city, built in 1882 by timberman and innkeeper Erik Appelberg.

The hotel became a hub for timber-merchants as well as local potentates. Notable guests include Crown Princess Stéphanie of Austria, King Oscar II and Gustav V of Sweden, and Kaiser Wilhelm II. The hotel also provided accommodation for King Chulalongkorn of Siam and four of his princes during their tour of Ångermanland in the early 20th century. Their journey is commemorated in the hotel with a plaque, and in the village of Utanede with a royal pavilion.

The building is a good example of the early architecture of Sollefteå, being built of wood.

=== Multrå transmitter ===
The Multrå transmitter is a facility for FM/TV broadcasting with a 288 metre tall mast.

==Climate==
The nearest weather station to Sollefteå is located in Österforse, slightly more than by air to its south-west. The station&#x27;s slightly more southerly latitude is likely even exceeded by a 50–80 metres higher elevation depending on location within Sollefteå. This likely renders Sollefteå slightly milder, particularly during afternoons.

Österforse has a subarctic climate (Dfc) that is quite moderate in nature considering its inland position and latitude. Summer days are very warm for North Central Sweden, being heavily affected by its low elevation in comparison to areas further west such as Östersund. Temperatures are heavily dependent on wind direction and the convergences of warm southerly and cold northerly air. Temperature inversion is also a factor due to its position beneath the mountain range. As a result, cold snaps can be quite extreme, resulting in an all-time low of . The all-time heat record is from July 2, 2015 with in an otherwise chilly summer.

* Madison, Mississippi

Madison has been Sollefteå&#x27;s sister city since 1997. Talks began in 1995 when Madison officials were meeting with the board of Sollefteå-based forestry products company, Haglof, Inc, for the latter was interested in opening a plant in Madison. The Madison officials came to Sollefteå and were more interested to learn about Swedish culture.

A delegation of 30 members of the city of Sollefteå&#x27;s board came to Madison to tour the city and make the sister city relationship official.
During the visit, Haglof opened its new office in Madison, and another Swedish company, Mini Tube, was also interested in opening offices in Madison.

After the people of the delegation of Sollefteå came to Madison, the latter sent 34 delegates to Sollefteå, once again to tour the city. The Madison delegates learned about Swedish culture and traditions, came to Haglof Inc.&#x27;s facilities, and toured an environmental center.

Because of Sollefteå&#x27;s and Madison&#x27;s relationship, the Swedish-American Chamber of Commerce was created in the latter.

<text>Alneda () (meaning &quot;the call&quot; in Arabic) is a former al-Qaeda-run website, which was located at: AlNeda.com. It was shut down in 2002.

It was being hosted in Malaysia by the internet service provider Malaysia Technology Development Corporation, and first appeared shortly after the September 11, 2001 Terrorist Attacks. It had encrypted information to direct members to more secure websites, featured news on Al Qaeda, published Fatwas and books, and had media, including videos of Osama bin Laden.

Many attempts were made to shut down in 2002 (mostly through DoS attacks), until one American porn-site owner named Jon Messner finally took control of the website. Messner used the Arabic translation service at ajeeb.com to read messages left on the site. For five days, people thought that it was still the real Al Qaeda site. After a post on an Islamic message board at 4:30 a.m. on July 20 warned people not to go, the site was taken down in a website defacement. After this message Messner posted an image of the Great Seal of the United States with the words, &quot;Hacked, Tracked, and Now Owned by the United States&quot;. It is now a link to ItsHappening.com, a website about current events.

The site briefly re-appeared on www.news4arab.org, but it was taken down again.

Alneda was run by the Saudi militant Yusuf al Ayiri, who was killed in a shootout with Saudi security forces in June 2003.

==Captives in the &quot;war on terror&quot;==

Several of the captives held in extrajudicial detention in the United States Guantanamo Bay detention camps had their continued detention justified by having documents containing their names listed on Alneda&#x27;s web-pages.

<text>The Cristero War (), also known as the Cristero Rebellion or  , was a widespread struggle in central and western Mexico from 3 August 1926 to 21 June 1929 in response to the implementation of secularist and anticlerical articles of the 1917 Constitution. The rebellion was instigated as a response to an executive decree by Mexican President Plutarco Elías Calles to strictly enforce Article 130 of the Constitution, a decision known as the Calles Law. Calles sought to limit the power of the Catholic Church in Mexico, its affiliated organizations and to suppress popular religiosity.

The rural uprising in north-central Mexico was tacitly supported by the Church hierarchy, and was aided by urban Catholic supporters. The Mexican Army received support from the United States. American Ambassador Dwight Morrow brokered negotiations between the Calles government and the Church. The government made some concessions, the Church withdrew its support for the Cristero fighters, and the conflict ended in 1929. The rebellion has been variously interpreted as a major event in the struggle between church and state that dates back to the 19th century with the War of Reform and as the last major peasant uprising in Mexico after the end of the military phase of the Mexican Revolution in 1920.

== Background ==

=== Mexican Revolution ===
The Mexican Revolution started in 1910 against the dictatorship of Porfirio Díaz and for the masses&#x27; demand of land for the peasantry. Francisco I. Madero was the first revolutionary leader. He was elected president in November 1911 but was overthrown and executed in 1913 by conservative General Victoriano Huerta in a series of events now known as the Ten Tragic Days. After Huerta seized power, Archbishop Leopoldo Ruiz y Flóres from Morelia published a letter condemning the coup and distancing the Church from Huerta. The newspaper of the National Catholic Party, representing the views of the bishops, severely attacked Huerta and so the new regime jailed the party&#x27;s president and halted the publication of the newspaper. Nevertheless, some members of the party participated in Huerta&#x27;s regime, such as Eduardo Tamariz. The revolutionary generals Venustiano Carranza, Francisco Villa and Emiliano Zapata, who won against Huerta&#x27;s Federal Army under the Plan of Guadalupe, had friends among Catholics and the local parish priests who aided them but also blamed high-ranking Catholic clergy for supporting Huerta.

=== 1917 Mexican Constitution ===
The 1917 Constitution was drafted by the Constituent Congress convened by Venustiano Carranza in September 1916, and it was approved on 5 February 1917. It was based on the previous 1857 Constitution, which had been instituted by Benito Juárez. Articles 3, 27, and 130 of the 1917 Constitution contained articles that restricted the power and the influence of the Catholic Church.

The first two sections of Article 3 stated: &quot;I. According to the religious liberties established under article 24, educational services shall be secular and, therefore, free of any religious orientation. II. The educational services shall be based on scientific progress and shall fight against ignorance, ignorance&#x27;s effects, servitudes, fanaticism and prejudice.&quot; The second section of Article 27 stated: &quot;All religious associations organized according to article 130 and its derived legislation, shall be authorized to acquire, possess or manage only the necessary assets to achieve their objectives.&quot;

The first paragraph of Article 130 stated: &quot;The rules established at this article are guided by the historical principle according to which the State and the churches are separated entities from each other. Churches and religious congregations shall be organized under the law.&quot;

The Constitution also provided for mandatory registration of all churches and religious congregations and forbade priests to involve themselves in politics or inherit from anyone other than close relatives. It also allowed each state to control the number of priests in its territory (some reduced it to zero), forbade the wearing of religious garb outside of church premises, and excluded offenders from a trial by jury. Carranza declared himself opposed to the final draft of Articles 3, 5, 24, 27, 123 and 130, but the Constitutional Congress contained only 85 conservatives and centrists who were close to Carranza&#x27;s moderate liberalism. Against them were 132 delegates of a more radical and anti-clerical mindset.

Article 24 stated: &quot;Every man shall be free to choose and profess any religious belief as long as it is lawful and it cannot be punished under criminal law. The Congress shall not be authorized to enact laws either establishing or prohibiting a particular religion. Religious ceremonies of public nature shall be ordinarily performed at the temples. Those performed outdoors shall be regulated under the law.&quot;
=== Conflict between church and state ===
The Mexican Revolution was the costliest conflict in Mexican history. The overthrow of the dictator Porfirio Díaz caused political instability, with many contending factions and regions. The Catholic Church and the Díaz government had come to an informal &quot;modus vivendi&quot; in which the state formally maintained the anticlerical articles of the liberal Constitution of 1857 but it failed to enforce them. A change of leadership or a wholesale overturning of the previous order were potential sources of danger to the Church&#x27;s position. In the democratizing wave of political activity, the National Catholic Party (&quot;Partido Católico Nacional&quot;) was formed.

After president Francisco I. Madero was overthrown and assassinated in a February 1913 military coup which was led by General Victoriano Huerta, supporters of the Porfirian regime were returned to their posts. After the ouster of Huerta in 1914, members of the National Catholic Party and high-ranking Church figures were accused of collaborating with the Huerta regime, and the Catholic Church was subjected to revolutionary hostilities and fierce anticlericalism by many northern revolutionaries. The Constitutionalist faction won the revolution and its leader, Venustiano Carranza, had a new constitution drawn up, the Constitution of 1917. It strengthened the anticlerical provisions of the previous document, but President Carranza and his successor, General Alvaro Obregón, were preoccupied by their struggles with their internal enemies and as a result, they were lenient in their enforcement of the Constitution&#x27;s anticlerical articles, especially in areas where the Church was powerful. 

Carranza was the first president under the 1917 Constitution but he was overthrown by his former ally Álvaro Obregón in 1919. Obregón took over the presidency in late 1920 and effectively applied the Constitution&#x27;s anticlerical laws in areas in which the Church was fragile. The uneasy truce with the Church ended with Obregón&#x27;s 1924 handpicked succession of the atheist Plutarco Elías Calles. Mexican &quot;Jacobins&quot;, supported by Calles&#x27;s central government, engaged in secularization campaigns to eradicate what they called superstition and fanaticism, which included the desecration of religious objects as well as the persecution and the murder of members of the clergy.

When Calles and his Labor Party came to power in 1924, the administration believed that the Church was challenging its revolutionary initiatives and legal basis and resolved to strictly enforce the Constitution&#x27;s secularist articles. To confront the Church&#x27;s influence, laws were brought into force to execute on the constitutional provisions, which triggered a ten-year-long religious conflict in which thousands of armed civilians were killed by the Mexican Army. Some have characterized Calles as the leader of an atheist state and his program as being one to eradicate religion in Mexico, although Calles also supported the creation of the Mexican Catholic Apostolic Church in 1925, a national church independent from the Vatican and accepting of the secularist Constitution. Calles applied the anticlerical laws stringently throughout the country and added his own anticlerical legislation. In June 1926, he signed the &quot;Law for Reforming the Penal Code&quot;, which was popularly called the Calles Law. It provided specific penalties for priests and individuals who violated the provisions of the 1917 Constitution. For instance, wearing clerical garb in public, outside church buildings, earned a fine of 500 pesos (then the equivalent of US$250), and priests who criticized the government could be imprisoned for five years. Some states enacted their own anticlerical measures. Chihuahua enacted a law permitting only one priest to serve all Catholics in the state. To help enforce the law, Calles expropriated church property, expelled all foreign priests and closed monasteries, convents and religious schools.

=== Protests and radicalization ===
In response to the measures, Catholic organizations began to intensify their resistance. The most important Catholic group was the National League for the Defense of Religious Liberty, founded in 1924, which was joined by the Mexican Association of Catholic Youth, founded in 1913, and the Popular Union, a Catholic political party founded the previous year.

Later in 1926, Calles intensified tensions against the clergy by ordering all local churches in and around Jalisco to be bolted shut. The places of worship remained shut for two years. On 14 July, Catholic bishops endorsed plans for an economic boycott against the government, which was particularly effective in west-central Mexico (the states of Jalisco, Michoacán, Guanajuato, Aguascalientes, and Zacatecas). Other states that saw minor uprising were the following Oaxaca, Colima, Sonora, and Nayarit. Catholics in those areas stopped attending movies and plays and using public transportation, and Catholic teachers stopped teaching in secular schools.

The fomenting conflict attracted the attention of Pope Pius XI, who issued a series of papal encyclicals from 1925 to 1937. On 18 November 1926, he issued &quot;Iniquis afflictisque&quot; (&quot;On the Persecution of the Church in Mexico&quot;) to denounce the violent anticlerical persecution in Mexico. Despite the government&#x27;s promises, the persecution of the Church continued. In response, Pius issued &quot;Acerba animi&quot; on 29 September 1932.

The bishops asked to have the offending articles of the Constitution amended. Pope Pius XI explicitly approved the plan. The Calles government considered the bishops&#x27; activism to be sedition and had many more churches closed. In September 1926, the episcopate submitted a proposal to amend the Constitution, but the Mexican Congress rejected it on 22 September.


==Rebellion==

The government called the rebels &quot;Cristeros&quot; since they invoked the name of Jesus Christ under the title of &quot;Cristo Rey&quot; or &quot;Christ the King&quot;, and the rebels soon took to using the name themselves. The rebellion is known for the Feminine Brigades of St. Joan of Arc, a brigade of women who assisted the rebels in smuggling guns and ammunition, and for certain priests who were tortured and murdered in public and later canonized by Pope John Paul II. The rebellion eventually came to an end following a settlement brokered by the American Ambassador Dwight W. Morrow, with financial relief and logistical assistance provided by the Knights of Columbus.

===Beginning of violence===
On 3 August, four days after the Calles Law came into force, in Guadalajara, Jalisco, some 400 armed Catholics shut themselves in the Church of Our Lady of Guadalupe (&quot;Santuario de Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe&quot;). They exchanged gunfire with federal troops and surrendered when they ran out of ammunition. According to American consular sources, the battle resulted in 18 dead and 40 wounded. The following day, in Sahuayo, Michoacán, 240 government soldiers stormed the parish church. The priest and his vicar were killed in the ensuing violence.

On 14 August, government agents staged a purge of the Chalchihuites, Zacatecas, chapter of the Association of Catholic Youth and executed its spiritual adviser, Father Luis Bátiz Sainz. The execution caused a band of ranchers, led by Pedro Quintanar, to seize the local treasury and to declare themselves in rebellion. At the height of the rebellion, they held a region including the entire northern part of Jalisco. Luis Navarro Origel, mayor of Pénjamo, Guanajuato, led another uprising on 28 September. His men were defeated by federal troops in the open land around the town but retreated into the mountains, where they engaged in guerrilla warfare. In support of the two guerrilla Apache clans, the Chavez and Trujillos helped smuggle arms, munitions and supplies from the U.S. state of New Mexico.

That was followed by a 29 September uprising in Durango, led by Trinidad Mora, and an 4 October rebellion in southern Guanajuato, led by former General Rodolfo Gallegos. Both rebel leaders adopted guerrilla tactics since their forces were no match for federal troops. Meanwhile, rebels in Jalisco, particularly the region northeast of Guadalajara, quietly began assembling forces. Led by 27-year-old René Capistrán Garza, the leader of the Mexican Association of Catholic Youth, the region would become the main focal point of the rebellion.

The formal rebellion began on 1 January 1927, with a manifesto sent by Garza, &quot;A la Nación&quot; (&quot;To the Nation&quot;). It declared that &quot;the hour of battle has sounded&quot; and that &quot;the hour of victory belongs to God.&quot; With the declaration, the state of Jalisco, which had been seemingly quiet since the Guadalajara church uprising, exploded. Bands of rebels moving in the &quot;Los Altos&quot; region northeast of Guadalajara began seizing villages and were often armed with only ancient muskets and clubs. The rebels had scarce logistical supplies and relied heavily on the Feminine Brigades of St. Joan of Arc and raids on towns, trains, and ranches to supply themselves with money, horses, ammunition, and food. By contrast, the Calles government was supplied with arms and ammunition by the American government later in the war. In at least one battle, American pilots provided air support for the Federal Army against the Cristero rebels.

The Calles government failed at first to take the threat seriously. The rebels did well against the &quot;agraristas&quot;, a rural militia recruited throughout Mexico, and the Social Defense forces, the local militia, but were at first always defeated by regular federal troops, who guarded the main cities. The Federal Army then had 79,759 men. When the Jalisco federal commander, General Jesús Ferreira, moved in on the rebels, wired to army headquarters that &quot;it will be less a campaign than a hunt&quot;. That sentiment was held also by Calles.
However, the rebels planned their battles fairly well considering that most of them had little to no previous military experience. The most successful rebel leaders were Jesús Degollado, a pharmacist; Victoriano Ramírez, a ranch hand; and two priests, Aristeo Pedroza and José Reyes Vega. Reyes Vega was renowned, and Cardinal Davila deemed him a &quot;black-hearted assassin&quot;. At least five priests took up arms, and many others supported them in various ways.

Many of the rebel peasants who took up arms in the fight had different motivations from the Catholic Church. Many were still fighting for agrarian land reform, which had been years earlier the focal point of the Mexican Revolution. The peasantry was still upset of the usurpation of its rightful title to the land.

The Mexican episcopate never officially supported the rebellion, but the rebels had some indications that their cause was legitimate. Bishop José Francisco Orozco of Guadalajara remained with the rebels. Although he formally rejected armed rebellion, he was unwilling to leave his flock.
On 23 February 1927, the Cristeros defeated federal troops for the first time at San Francisco del Rincón, Guanajuato, followed by another victory at San Julián, Jalisco. However, they quickly began to lose in the face of superior federal forces, retreated into remote areas, and constantly fled federal soldiers. Most of the leadership of the revolt in the state of Jalisco was forced to flee to the U.S. although Ramírez and Vega remained.

In April 1927, the leader of the civilian wing of the Cristiada, Anacleto González Flores, was captured, tortured, and killed. The media and the government declared victory, and plans were made for a re-education campaign in the areas that had rebelled. As if to prove that the rebellion was not extinguished and to avenge his death, Vega led a raid against a train carrying a shipment of money for the Bank of Mexico on 19 April 1927. The raid was a success, but Vega&#x27;s brother was killed in the fighting.

The &quot;Reconcentración&quot; policy, was a policy of forced resettlement by the government during the cristero period of villages destroyed during the numerous battles . rather than suppressing the revolt, gave it new life, as thousands of men began to aid and join the rebels in resentment for their treatment by the government. When rains came, the peasants were allowed to return to the harvest, and there was now more support than ever for the Cristeros. By August 1927, they had consolidated their movement and had begun constant attacks on federal troops garrisoned in their towns. They would soon be joined by Enrique Gorostieta, a retired general hired by the National League for the Defense of Religious Liberty.

On 21 June 1927, the first Women&#x27;s Brigade was formed in Zapopan. It began with 16 women and one man, but after a few days, it grew to 135 members and soon came to number 17,000. Its mission was to obtain money, weapons, provisions, and information for the combatant men and to care for the wounded. By March 1928, some 10,000 women were involved in the struggle, with many smuggling weapons into combat zones by carrying them in carts filled with grain or cement. By the end of the war, it numbered some 25,000. Several female Catholic activists groups formed during this time, and women were instrumental in the formation of activist groups to promote a movement in response to the anticlerical campaigns of the period.

With close ties to the Church and the clergy, the De La Torre family was instrumental in bringing the Cristero Movement to northern Mexico. The family, originally from Zacatecas and Guanajuato, moved to Aguascalientes and then, in 1922, to San Luis Potosí. It moved again to Tampico for economic reasons and finally to Nogales (both the Mexican city and its similarly named sister city across the border in Arizona) to escape persecution from authorities because of its involvement in the Church and the rebels. The Cristeros maintained the upper hand throughout 1928, and in 1929, the government faced a new crisis: a revolt within army ranks that was led by Arnulfo R. Gómez in Veracruz. The Cristeros tried to take advantage by a failed attack on Guadalajara in late March 1929. The rebels managed to take Tepatitlán on 19 April, but Vega was killed. The rebellion was met with equal force, and the Cristeros were soon facing divisions within their own ranks. Another difficulty facing the Cristeros and especially the Catholic Church was the extended period without a place of worship. The clergy faced the fear of driving away the faithful masses by engaging in war for so long. They also lacked the overwhelming sympathy or support from many aspects of Mexican society, even among many Catholics.

===Diplomacy===
In October 1927, the American ambassador, Dwight Morrow, initiated a series of breakfast meetings with Calles at which they would discuss a range of issues from the religious uprising to oil and irrigation. That earned him the nickname &quot;the ham and eggs diplomat&quot; in U.S. papers. Morrow wanted the conflict to end for regional security and to help find a solution to the oil problem in the U.S. He was aided in his efforts by Father John J. Burke of the National Catholic Welfare Conference. Calles&#x27;s term as president was coming to an end, and ex-President Álvaro Obregón had been elected president and was scheduled to take office on 1 December 1928. Obregón had been more lenient to Catholics during his time in office than Calles, but it was also generally accepted among Mexicans, including the Cristeros, that Calles was his puppet leader. Two weeks after his election, Obregón was assassinated by a Catholic radical, José de León Toral, which gravely damaged the peace process.
In September 1928, Congress named Emilio Portes Gil as interim president with a special election to be held in November 1929. Portes was more open to the Church than Calles had been and allowed Morrow and Burke to restart the peace initiative. Portes told a foreign correspondent on 1 May 1929, that &quot;the Catholic clergy, when they wish, may renew the exercise of their rites with only one obligation, that they respect the laws of the land.&quot; The next day, the exiled Archbishop Leopoldo Ruíz y Flores issued a statement that the bishops would not demand the repeal of the laws but only their more lenient enforcement.

Morrow managed to bring the parties to agreement on 21 June 1929. His office drafted a pact called the &quot;arreglos&quot; (&quot;agreement&quot;), which allowed worship to resume in Mexico and granted three concessions to the Catholics. Only priests who were named by hierarchical superiors would be required to register; religious instruction in churches but not in schools would be permitted; and all citizens, including the clergy, would be allowed to make petitions to reform the laws. However, the most important parts of the agreement were that the Church would recover the right to use its properties, and priests would recover their rights to live on the properties. Legally speaking, the Church was not allowed to own real estate, and its former facilities remained federal property. However, the Church effectively took control over the properties. In the convenient arrangement for both parties, the Church ostensibly ended its support for the rebels.

Over the previous two years, anticlerical officers, who were hostile to the federal government for reasons other than its position on religion, had joined the rebels. When the agreement between the government and the Church was made known, only a minority of the rebels went home, mainly those who felt their battle had been won. On the other hand, since the rebels themselves had not been consulted in the talks, many felt betrayed, and some continued to fight. The Church threatened those rebels with excommunication and the rebellion gradually died out. The officers, fearing that they would be tried as traitors, tried to keep the rebellion alive. Their attempt failed, and many were captured and shot, and others escaped to San Luis Potosí, where General Saturnino Cedillo gave them refuge.

The war had claimed the lives of some 90,000 people: 56,882 federals, 30,000 Cristeros, and numerous civilians and Cristeros who were killed in anticlerical raids after the war had ended. As promised by Portes Gil, the Calles Law remained on the books, but there were no organized federal attempts to enforce it. Nonetheless, in several localities, officials continued persecution of Catholic priests, based on their interpretation of the law.

In 1992, the Mexican government amended the constitution by granting all religious groups legal status, conceding them property rights, and lifting restrictions on the number of priests in the country.

===American involvement===

====Mexican American resistance====
While the war was raging on in Mexico, Cristero exiles and other Mexican immigrants and refugees would attend sermons by banished Cristero priests denouncing President Plutarco Elías Calles&#x27; regime and the Cristero War. These attendees would also help generate sympathy in the United States for the Cristero War by printing newspaper articles about the war and would create religious nationalistic organizations such as &quot;Unión Nacionalista Mexicana (&quot;Nationalist Mexican&#x27;s Union in English) to gather funds for the war effort. There were some within these groups that would contribute more military aid to the Cristeros, with actions including smuggling arms across the U.S.-Mexican border, providing espionage against the Mexican government, recruiting new troops to aid the Cristeros, and inciting armed revolts within Mexico. Despite all of these efforts, their contribution to the war was largely limited due to distrust from the United States government who saw an armed Catholic movement as dangerous and would send more troops to the border, which would cause more persecution and discrimination to Mexican Catholics, Cristero exiles, and refugees.

====Knights of Columbus====
Created in New Haven, Connecticut in 1882, the Knights of Columbus would establish its first chapter in Mexico called &quot;Caballeros de Colón&quot; (Knights of Columbus in Spanish) in Mexico City in 1905. Established by California railroad mogul and Knight John B. Frisbie, a resident of Mexico City, the first chapter would be made up of mostly Irish and Irish-Mexicans before more Mexicans would join the organization. The Knights of Columbus would eventually become one of Mexico&#x27;s biggest and most monumental Catholic organizations, with a total of 5,102 members across 45 councils nationwide. The Knights of Columbus would start out in western states, an area where the Catholic Church was widespread, such as Puebla, Hidalgo, Michoacán, Guanajuato, and Jalisco, before spreading to Nayarit, Veracruz, Coahuila, Durango, and Chihuahua. Mexican members of the Knights of Columbus would also be involved with other Catholic organizations such as the Young Men&#x27;s Catholic Association and &quot;La&quot; &quot;Liga Nacional Defensora de la Libertad Religiosa&quot; (National League for the Defense of Religious Liberty in English). The Knights of Columbus would create religious schools throughout Mexico in 1923 as a way to create a &quot;National Crusade in Defense of Catholicism&quot;. Furthermore, &quot;La Liga&quot; would create a popular, nationwide boycott in 1925 to protest the government&#x27;s treatment of Catholics and the ongoing anti-religious sentiment present throughout the government. The Knights of Columbus also helped to generate propaganda and support for the Cristero War, framing the war as a story of martyrs and heroes, standing up for their religion in the face of an oppressive government.

American councils and Mexican councils, mostly newly formed, of the Knights of Columbus, both opposed the persecution by the Mexican government. So far, nine of those who were beatified or canonized were Knights. The American Knights collected more than $1 million to assist exiles from Mexico, fund the continuation of the education of expelled seminarians, and inform U.S. citizens about the oppression. They circulated five million leaflets about the war in the United States, held hundreds of lectures, spread the news via radio, and paid to &quot;smuggle&quot; a friendly journalist into Mexico so he could cover the war for an American audience.

In addition to lobbying the American public, the Knights met United States President Calvin Coolidge and pressed him for US intervention on behalf of the rebels. According to former Supreme Knight of the Knights of Columbus, Carl A. Anderson, two-thirds of Mexican Catholic councils were shut down by the Mexican government. In response, the Knights of Columbus published posters and magazines which presented Cristero soldiers in a positive light. In the mid-1920s, the anti-Catholic Ku Klux Klan denounced the Knights of Columbus&#x27;s Mexican Fund.

==Aftermath==
The government often did not abide by the terms of the truce. For example, it executed some 500 Cristero leaders and 5,000 other Cristeros. Catholics continued to oppose Calles&#x27;s insistence on a state monopoly on education, which suppressed Catholic education and introduced secular education in its place: &quot;We must enter and take possession of the mind of childhood, the mind of youth.&quot; Calles&#x27;s military persecution of Cristeros after the truce would be officially condemned by Mexican President Lázaro Cárdenas and the Mexican Congress in 1935. Between 1935 and 1936, Cárdenas had Calles and many of his close associates arrested and forced them into exile soon afterwards. Freedom of worship was no longer suppressed, but some states refused to repeal Calles&#x27;s policy. Relations with the Church improved under President Cárdenas.

The government&#x27;s disregard for the Church, however, did not relent until 1940, when President Manuel Ávila Camacho, a practicing Catholic, took office. During Cárdenas presidency, Church buildings in the country continued in the hands of the Mexican government, and the nation&#x27;s policies regarding the Church still fell into federal jurisdiction. Under Camacho, bans against Church anticlerical laws were no longer enforced anywhere in Mexico.

The effects of the war on the Church were profound. Between 1926 and 1934, at least 40 priests were killed. There were 4,500 priests serving the people before the rebellion, but by 1934, there were only 334 licensed by the government to serve 15 million Catholics. The rest had been eliminated by emigration, expulsion, assassination, or not obtaining licenses. In 1935, 17 states had no registered priests.

The end of the Cristero War affected emigration to the United States. &quot;In the aftermath of their defeat, many of the Cristeros – by some estimates as much as 5 percent of Mexico&#x27;s population – fled to the United States. Many of them made their way to Los Angeles, where they were received by John Joseph Cantwell, bishop of what was then the Los Angeles-San Diego diocese.&quot; Under Archbishop Cantwell&#x27;s sponsorship, the Cristero refugees became a substantial community in Los Angeles, California, in 1934 staging a parade some 40,000-strong throughout the city. Additionally, several other cites such as Chicago, Illinois, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and San Antonio, Texas. Many cities saw an increase in Mexican Catholics fleeing because of the war. Immigration to other countries such as Canada, Rome, Cuba occurred as well.

===Cárdenas era===
The Calles Law was repealed after Cárdenas became president in 1934. Cárdenas earned respect from Pope Pius XI and befriended Mexican Archbishop Luis María Martínez, a major figure in Mexico&#x27;s Catholic Church who successfully persuaded Mexicans to obey the government&#x27;s laws peacefully. The Church refused to back Mexican insurgent Saturnino Cedillo&#x27;s failed revolt against Cárdenas although Cedillo endorsed more power for the Church.

Cárdenas&#x27;s government continued to suppress religion in the field of education during his administration. The Mexican Congress amended Article 3 of the Constitution in October 1934 to include the following introductory text: &quot;The education imparted by the State shall be a socialist one and, in addition to excluding all religious doctrine, shall combat fanaticism and prejudices by organizing its instruction and activities in a way that shall permit the creation in youth of an exact and rational concept of the Universe and of social life.&quot;

The implementation of socialist education met with strong opposition in some parts of academia and in areas that had been controlled by the Cristeros. Pope Pius XI also published the encyclical &quot;Firmissimam constantiam&quot; on 28 March 1937, expressing his opposition to the &quot;impious and corruptive school&quot; (paragraph 22) and his support for Catholic Action in Mexico. That was the third and last encyclical published by Pius XI that referred to the religious situation in Mexico. The amendment was ignored by President Manuel Ávila Camacho and was officially repealed from the Constitution in 1946. Constitutional bans against the Church would not be enforced anywhere in Mexico during Camacho&#x27;s presidency.

====Cristeros&#x27; targeted violence against government forces and public school teachers====

Many former Cristeros took up arms again and fought as independent rebels and some Catholics joined them. They targeted unarmed public school teachers who implemented secular education and committed atrocities against them. Government supporters blamed the atrocities on the Cristeros in general. Some of the teachers who were paid by the government refused to leave their schools and communities, and as a result, they sustained mutilations when Cristeros cut their ears off. Thus, the teachers who were murdered during the conflict are frequently referred to as &quot;maestros desorejados&quot; (&quot;teachers without ears&quot;).

In some cases, teachers were tortured and killed by former Cristero rebels. It is calculated that approximately 300 rural teachers were killed between 1935 and 1939, and other authors calculate that at least 223 teachers were victims of the violence which occurred between 1931 and 1940, the acts of violence which occurred during this period included the assassinations of Carlos Sayago, Carlos Pastraña, and Librado Labastida in Teziutlán, Puebla, the hometown of President Manuel Ávila Camacho; the execution of a teacher, Carlos Toledano, who was burned alive in Tlapacoyan, Veracruz; and the lynching of at least 42 teachers in the state of Michoacán.

====Cristeros, Priests and Catholic civilians victims of government violence====

The Catholic Church has recognized several of those who were killed in the Cristero War as martyrs, including Miguel Pro, a Jesuit who was shot dead without trial by a firing squad on 23 November 1927, for his alleged involvement in an assassination attempt against former President Álvaro Obregón, though his supporters maintained that he was executed for carrying out his priestly duties in defiance of the government. His beatification occurred in 1988.

On 21 May 2000, Pope John Paul II canonized a group of 25 martyrs who were killed during the Cristero War. They had been beatified on 22 November 1992. Of this group, 22 were secular clergy, and three were laymen. They did not take up arms but refused to leave their flocks and ministries and were shot or hanged by government forces for offering the sacraments. Most were executed by federal forces. Although Pedro de Jesús Maldonado was killed in 1937, after the war ended, he is considered a member of the Cristeros.

The Catholic Church recognized 13 additional victims of the war as martyrs on 20 November 2005, thus paving the way for their beatifications. This group was mostly lay people, including Luis Magaña Servín and 14-year-old José Sánchez del Río. On 20 November 2005, at Jalisco Stadium in Guadalajara, José Saraiva Cardinal Martins celebrated the beatifications. Furthermore, some religious relics have been brought to the United States from Jalisco and are currently located at Our Lady of the Mount Church in Cicero, Illinois.

The war would lead to refugees and exiles to flee to the United States, mostly from the central-Pacific region, as state-enforced violence towards Catholics would lead religious Mexicans from states such as Hidalgo, Jalisco, Michoacán, and Guanajuato to leave for the United States. Within these new arrivals, there were 2,500 exiles with positions within the Catholic Church in Mexico, creating a Cristero Diaspora alongside other refugees, immigrants, and non-clergy exiles. Most of these refugees were also farmers, ranchers, and laborers, and due to increased transportation services between the United States and Mexico, immigration was easier than ever before. These immigrants would take industrial and labor-intensive jobs within the United States, particularly in California, Texas, Colorado, and New Mexico. This led to the creation of many churches and religious institutions in many states with Cristo Rey and Our Lady of Guadalupe as names, as well as to the building of seminaries to house displaced clergy members and several convents housing nuns . 

==In popular culture==
The novel &quot;José Trigo&quot; by Fernando del Paso partly centers on the Cristero War. Graham Greene&#x27;s 1940 novel &quot;The Power and the Glory&quot; deals with the Mexican government&#x27;s attempt to suppress the Catholic Church during the war.

Many films, shorts, and documentaries about the war have been produced since 1929 such as &quot;Cristiada&quot; (aka &quot;For Greater Glory&quot;) from 2012.

Several ballads, or &quot;corridos&quot;, were composed in the period of the war by federal troops and Cristeros.

Cristeros are also mentioned in the 2019 James Ellroy novel &quot;This Storm&quot;

The Cristero War is also mentioned in the 1955 Juan Rulfo novel &quot;Pedro Páramo&quot;.

<text>Mettmann () is a town in the northern part of the Bergisches Land, in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. It is the administrative centre of the district of Mettmann, Germany&#x27;s most densely populated rural district. The town lies east of Düsseldorf and west of Wuppertal.

==History==
Located on the ancient trade route &quot;strata coloniensis&quot; the Lotharingian hamlet of Medamana (&quot;engl.&quot; between the streams, which bears an etymological similarity to the origins of the name for the Northern Italian city of Milan (&quot;lat.&quot; Mediolanum)) first appeared in the charter of the last Carolingian King, Louis the Child, 904 AD, thus existing &quot;officially&quot; for more than 1100 years.

In 1363 Mettmann was one of eight administrative burghs in the Earldom of Berg and Jülich. Later the burgh became independent at the hand of Counsellor to the Earl of Cleves and was allowed to build a wall and choose a mayor. The ability to toll and tax allowed the burgh to develop in commerce and trade.

In 1806 Mettmann became a part of the Grand Duchy of Berg under the rule of Napoleon&#x27;s brother-in-law, Joachim Murat. During this time, Mettmann&#x27;s burgomaster was called &quot;Monsieur le Maire.&quot; Mettmann remained French for about 10 years and became a part of Prussia&#x27;s Province of Jülich-Cleves-Berg following Napoleon&#x27;s defeat at the Battle of Leipzig in 1813. As the result of the Congress of Vienna (1814–15), in 1822 it was adsorbed into the Prussian Rhine Province.

However, the Prussian rulers did not prove to be very popular, as during the bread-riots of 1848–49 and the ensuing political upheavals, which hit the district of Düsseldorf among the hardest, policing was done from Berlin, excluding local accountability. Thus, the Prussian government regarded the Rhinelands as more of a colony, furnishing the bureaucracy, which was based in Düsseldorf, with civil servants that were drafted in from other regions of Prussia.

Mettmann was liberated from the National Socialist Dictatorship April 16, 1945, by a vanguard of the US Ninth Army and then became a part of the British military administration under which the Northern Rhineland was redemocratised. Since 1946, Mettmann is a part of the Land North Rhine-Westphalia and from 1949 of West Germany. Since 1990 it belongs to the unified Federal Republic of Germany.

==Demographics==

In the years following Germany&#x27;s loss of World War II in 1945, Mettmann saw significant population increases driven mostly by the resettlement of citizens previously living in the eastern territories that had been ceded to Poland. Having seen almost no war-time destruction and being situated in a traditionally strong economic region, the town soon prospered, in line with a general period of rapid economic growth that acquired the moniker Wirtschaftswunder (&quot;economic miracle&quot;).

A shortage of industrial workers led to several recruitment campaigns in Mediterranean countries, starting with Italy in the early 1960s, and followed by Turkey later that decade. These communities soon thrived and established cultural markers such as the Pizza and kebab restaurants that are now ubiquitous throughout western Germany. Later events such as the Lebanese Civil War and the Balkan Wars were also reflected in the town&#x27;s makeup, which now comprises communities of Turks, Kurds, Kashubians, Old Prussians, Silesians, Poles, Greeks, Croatians, Serbs, Albanians, Bosnians and Lebanese heritage, each distinct but generally well-integrated into the Rhenish-Westphalian majority population and its traditions.

Due to festivals and other events that took place in Mettmann to which many Brazilians were flown in, the town also became the host of a sizeable Brazilian community, this fact was also featured in the German movie &quot;Samba in Mettmann&quot; by the German/Italian filmmaker duo Hape Kerkeling and Angelo Colagrossi.

==Government and politics==
Mettmann gave its name to the District of Mettmann. Although the administrative centre of the District of Mettmann changed often over the years, in 1954 the parliament of the Land North Rhine-Westphalia eventually decided to make Mettmann the district&#x27;s administrative centre. In 1974–75, with the administrative boundary reform, the district lost several councils to the neighbouring cities Düsseldorf, Duisburg, Essen, and Wuppertal. The district name also changed from Düsseldorf-Mettmann to Mettmann during this reform. However, the regional Board of Inland Revenue—the &quot;Finanzamt Düsseldorf-Mettmann&quot;—serves both the municipalities forming the district of Mettmann, as well as the city of Düsseldorf proper.

<text>Skellefteå (, ) is a city in Västerbotten County, Sweden, with a population of 36,388. It is the seat of Skellefteå Municipality, which had 77,322 inhabitants in 2024.

The city is historically industrial, with mining being a large part of that industry, especially for gold, leading to the city being nicknamed &quot;Guldstaden&quot; (&quot;gold town&quot;). Politically, Skellefteå is a Social Democratic stronghold. The city is a well-known ice hockey town, with its main team Skellefteå AIK playing in the Swedish top division: the SHL, which they have won on several occasions; most recently in 2024.

The city was incorporated in 1845 and grew to its current population size in the 1950s and 1960s, growing only slowly since. It is the second largest city in Västerbotten after Umeå and is located roughly halfway between it and Luleå. The Skellefte River passes through the city and it is located around from the Bothnian Bay open sea. Skellefteå is served by Skellefteå Airport, IATA airport code SFT but locally known as &quot;Falmark&quot; because of the village nearby, also around from the city centre to the south.

==History==

The name Skellefteå is recorded to having been spelled as &quot;Skelepht&quot; in 1327. On Carta marina the name is spelt &quot;Skellitta&quot;. The origin of the name remains unknown, but is assumed to be of Sami origin.

From the 14th century on, attempts were made to Christianize Skellefteå. A parish was formed and a church built. However, for the most part, the entire large Northern Swedish territory of Norrland was not Christianized until several hundred years after the rest of Sweden, and many northern areas such as Skellefteå remained unexplored well past the Middle Ages.

Not before the very end of the 17th century did the indigenous Sami people of Northern Sweden begin turning to Christianity, much due to the efforts by the Northern Swedish superintendent Mathias Steuchius, who worked hard to accomplish this. Several Sami shamans were killed for this reason.

Eventually, the reason for the sudden awakened interest towards Skellefteälven and the surrounding areas was the great northern fishing grounds of salmon.

The actual city of Skellefteå is one of the youngest cities of Norrland. It was founded in 1845 by the vicar Nils Nordlander.

==Economy==
Major industries include:
*Boliden AB, a big mining and smelting company
*Skellefteå Kraft, largest power company in Skellefteå
*Northvolt, lithium-ion battery cell manufacturing company

The city will become the home of a massive battery plant made by Northvolt by circa 2023.

The largest private employer in Skellefteå is the mining company Boliden AB, with about 1,200 employees. The mine&#x27;s copper ore contains particles of gold, silver and platinum. Skellefteå is still referred to as the &quot;Goldtown&quot;.

During the 1990s, the computer industry flourished, subsidiaries of Ericsson and Tieto Enator becoming important employers.

==Climate==
Skellefteå has a subarctic climate (Dfc) with mild summers and cold, long and snowy winters. The climate is somewhat moderated by the Bothnia Bay, although maritime effects are limited, ensuring warm summer temperatures for a coastal area so far north. In the last century, as part of global climate warming, an increase in summer temperatures as well as an earlier arrival of spring and a later onset of winter have been observed. Precipitation is moderate, the maximum precipitation is in the second half of summer. The difference in average hours of sunshine between months is large: December has very little due to both very short days and high cloud cover, while June has a lot due to long days and relatively clear weather.


==Transportation==
The European route E4 highway provides the main road connection to the city, providing direct connections to cities like Stockholm and Sundsvall going south and Luleå going north. Riksväg 95 also serves the city.

There is a railway branch line running through Skellefteå, although with no passenger traffic, making it the largest city in Sweden without it. The line is still served by Freight traffic. There were plans to start night trains going from Stockholm to Skellefteå, with service being expected to commence in April 2022. Due to a decision from Trafikverket, the planned night trains were cancelled before they started running. The closest train station in use is located in Bastuträsk, from which trains heading to several cities including Stockholm, Umeå and Luleå depart, operated by Norrtåg and Vy. There goes a bus to Skellefteå from Bastuträsk, intended for transfers to and from the trains.

The High-speed rail line Norrbotniabanan is planned to go through the city, providing it with rail service for the first time since 1990. As a part of this, a new station will be constructed close to the city centre. Service is expected to begin in 2030.

<doc id="1017534" wikidata="Q463953" url="?curid=1017534" title="Lady Wu (wife of Sun Jian)">
<text>Lady Wu (died 202), personal name unknown, was a Chinese noble lady, aristocrat and posthumously honoured as Empress of Eastern Wu state. She was the wife of the warlord Sun Jian, who lived during the late Eastern Han dynasty of China. She bore Sun Jian four sons and a daughter – Sun Ce, Sun Quan, Sun Yi, Sun Kuang and Lady Sun. She was posthumously honoured as Empress Wulie in 229 by her second son Sun Quan, who became the founding emperor of the state of Eastern Wu in the Three Kingdoms period.

==Early life and marriage to Sun Jian==
Lady Wu was from Wu County, Wu Commandery, which is around present-day Suzhou, Jiangsu, but she grew up in Qiantang County in present-day Hangzhou, Zhejiang. She was orphaned at a young age as both of her parents died so she lived with her younger brother, Wu Jing.

Sun Jian heard of her beauty and character and desired to marry her. However, Lady Wu&#x27;s relatives disliked Sun Jian, whom they perceived as an idler and a rascal, so they wanted to reject his proposal. Sun Jian was embarrassed and angry at their decision. Lady Wu told her relatives, &quot;Why bring disaster upon yourselves just because of your love for me? If this turns out to be a bad marriage, I&#x27;ll accept it as my fate.&quot; Lady Wu&#x27;s relatives then agreed to her marriage to Sun Jian. She bore Sun Jian four sons and a daughter. She probably married Sun Jian in 175 or earlier because their first child, Sun Ce, was born that year.

According to a story in &quot;In Search of the Supernatural&quot;, Lady Wu dreamt about the moon entering her body before she gave birth to Sun Ce. Later, before she gave birth to Sun Quan, she had a similar dream about the sun entering her body. When she asked her husband about her strange dreams, he said, &quot;The sun and the moon capture the true essence of yin and yang. They are very auspicious symbols. My descendants will become great men!&quot;

In 190, when Sun Jian raised an army to join the campaign against Dong Zhuo, he relocated his family from Changsha Commandery (長沙郡; covering present-day Changsha and parts of Hunan) to Shu County (), Lujiang Commandery (), which is in present-day Shucheng County, Anhui. In Shu, Sun Ce met and befriended Zhou Yu, who was about the same age as him. Zhou Yu offered to let Sun Ce and his family stay with him and he paid respects to Lady Wu as though she was his real mother. Zhou Yu and Sun Ce became very close friends.

==Life during Sun Ce&#x27;s conquests in Jiangdong==
Sun Jian was killed in action at the Battle of Xiangyang in 191 against Liu Biao&#x27;s forces. He was succeeded by his eldest son Sun Ce. Around the time, Lady Wu&#x27;s younger brother Wu Jing was appointed by the warlord Yuan Shu as the Administrator () of Danyang Commandery (丹楊郡; around present-day Xuancheng, Anhui), but had yet to assume his appointment. Wu Jing was at Qu&#x27;e County (曲阿縣; in present-day Danyang, Jiangsu) then, so Sun Ce brought his family to Qu&#x27;e County to join his uncle.

Between 194 and 199, Sun Ce embarked on a series of conquests in the Jiangdong (or Wu) region to seize territories from the local governors and warlords in the area. He left his mother and family members in Qu&#x27;e County, but later had them relocated to Liyang County (歷陽縣; present-day He County, Anhui) and Fuling County (阜陵縣; around present-day Quanjiao County, Anhui) consecutively. After Sun Ce had conquered Wu (around present-day Suzhou) and Kuaiji (around present-day Shaoxing, Zhejiang) commanderies, he relocated his family to Wu County, which was Lady Wu&#x27;s hometown.

When Sun Ce was in power in Jiangdong, he encountered a Taoist priest called Yu Ji, who had attracted a sizeable following for spreading his faith and for his alleged healing powers. Sun Ce accused Yu Ji of heresy and had him arrested. Many women came to see Lady Wu and implored her to save Yu Ji, so Lady Wu asked her son to release Yu Ji. She said, &quot;Yu Ji brings good luck to the army and heals the soldiers. You shouldn&#x27;t kill him.&quot; However, Sun Ce insisted that Yu Ji was a heretic and was corrupting the masses through his &quot;teachings&quot;, so he had Yu executed.

Lady Wu was known for her wisdom and shrewdness in politics. The &quot;Kuaiji Dianlu&quot; () recorded one incident in which Sun Ce wanted to kill Wei Teng (), an Officer of Merit () serving under him, when Wei opposed his views. The other officials were afraid and did not know what to do. Lady Wu showed up, stood beside a well, and told her son, &quot;You&#x27;ve recently established a foothold in Jiangnan and there are many things you still need to do. You should treat men of talent with respect, pardon them for their minor mistakes and honour them for their contributions. Officer Wei has been performing his duties faithfully. If you kill him today, tomorrow others will rebel against you. I don&#x27;t wish to see a tragedy occur, so I&#x27;ll throw myself into this well.&quot; Sun Ce was shocked and he immediately released Wei Teng.

==Life during Sun Quan&#x27;s administration==
Sun Ce was assassinated in 200 CE by the servants of Xu Gong, a commandery administrator whom he killed earlier. He was succeeded by his younger brother, Sun Quan, who was still young when he took over the reins of power. Lady Wu rendered much assistance to Sun Quan in administering political and military affairs. She was worried that Sun Quan would be too young to handle the precarious situation in Jiangdong. She consulted Dong Xi about her incertitude, and Dong Xi emboldened the former by saying, &quot;The lands east of the Yangzi enjoy natural barriers from mountains and rivers, while the good government and virtue of Sun Ce have already attracted the people, lord Sun Quan can build on these foundations, so that great and small may follow his commands.

Around 202, the warlord Cao Cao, who controlled the Han central government, demanded that Sun Quan send one of his sons to the imperial capital Xu (許; present-day Xuchang, Henan) as a hostage so as to secure Sun&#x27;s allegiance towards him. When Sun Quan gathered his subjects to discuss the issue, they could not arrive at a conclusion. Personally, Sun Quan was not in favour of yielding to Cao Cao&#x27;s demand, so he had another meeting with only his mother and Zhou Yu. Zhou Yu advised Sun Quan against sending a hostage while Lady Wu endorsed Zhou&#x27;s suggestion and asked her son to treat Zhou like an elder brother. Sun Quan heeded their advice.

Before her death in 202, Lady Wu summoned Zhang Zhao, Dong Xi and others and instructed them to help Sun Quan in governing the territories in Jiangnan. She was buried at Gaoling (高陵; believed to be somewhere in present-day Suzhou, Jiangsu). In 229, when Sun Quan declared himself Emperor and established the state of Eastern Wu, he granted his mother the posthumous title &quot;Empress Wulie&quot; ().

==In &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;==
In the 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, Lady Wu had a fictional younger sister who also married Sun Jian. The elder Lady Wu was the mother of Sun Ce and Sun Quan while the younger one bore Lady Sun and Sun Lang. The younger Lady Wu was also known as &quot;Wu Guotai&quot; (吳國太; literally &quot;Elder Lady Wu of the State&quot;). Wu Guotai lived longer than her sister because she played a significant role in the marriage of her daughter to Liu Bei in 209.

<doc id="1017558" wikidata="Q2716921" url="?curid=1017558" title="Daft Club">
<text>Daft Club is the first remix album by the French electronic music duo Daft Punk, released on 1 December 2003 by Virgin Records. The album features numerous remixes of tracks from their second album, &quot;Discovery&quot; (2001), and one from their debut, &quot;Homework&quot; (1997).

The album received mixed reviews from critics who often considered the remixes of songs from &quot;Discovery&quot; inferior to their original counterparts.

==Background==
The name of the album comes from Daft Punk&#x27;s online music service, which featured remixed songs, a live recording of Daft Punk performing at the Que Club (which would later be released as &quot;Alive 1997&quot;), and an a cappella and instrumental version of &quot;Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger&quot;. The service was available for free to people who bought initial pressings of the &quot;Discovery&quot; album. Each album included a &quot;Daft Club&quot; membership card, which granted access to the Daft Club website. The service ended in January 2003.

In regards to the album and online music service, Thomas Bangalter stated:

Limited edition copies of the film &quot;Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem&quot; featured &quot;Daft Club&quot; as a second disc. The track &quot;Something About Us (Love Theme from Interstella 5555)&quot; is omitted from this version. A limited edition of this album was also released in Japan. It includes an extra track and a bonus DVD-Video. The DVD contains a preview of &quot;Interstella 5555&quot;, interviews in English with Daft Punk, a music video for &quot;Crescendolls&quot; from the film and a video for &quot;Something About Us&quot; that includes a montage of various scenes.

Tracks from &quot;Discovery&quot; were remixed in &quot;Daft Club&quot; except &quot;Nightvision&quot;, &quot;Superheroes&quot;, &quot;High Life&quot;, &quot;Veridis Quo&quot; and &quot;Short Circuit&quot;. In place of these tracks are additional remixes of &quot;Face to Face&quot;, &quot;Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger&quot; and &quot;Aerodynamic&quot;, respectively. Also featured is the &quot;Aerodynamic&quot; B-side titled &quot;Aerodynamite&quot;, the previously unreleased track &quot;Ouverture&quot; and a remix of the &quot;Homework&quot; track &quot;Phoenix&quot;.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Daft Club&quot; received mixed reviews. An extremely negative review by &quot;Pitchfork&quot; features an artist&#x27;s illustrated interpretations of how the remixed songs compare to the original versions. The review also stated that [the album]&#x27;s contributors &quot;all seem intent upon completely decimating the source material&quot; and that &quot;to listen to Daft Club front-to-back is–and it&#x27;s pointless to exaggerate here–to watch a loved one be physically dismembered.&quot;

<text>&quot;Treehouse of Horror&quot;, or &quot;The Simpsons&#x27; Treehouse of Horror&quot;, is the third episode of the second season of the American animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. It originally aired on Fox in the United States on October 25, 1990. The episode was inspired by 1950s horror comics, and begins with a disclaimer that it may be too scary for children. It is the first Treehouse of Horror episode. These episodes do not obey the show&#x27;s rule of realism and are not treated as canon. The opening disclaimer and a panning shot through a cemetery with humorous tombstones were features that were used sporadically in the &quot;Treehouse of Horror&quot; series and eventually dropped. This is also the first episode to have the music composed by Alf Clausen.

The plot revolves around three scary stories told by the Simpson children in the family&#x27;s treehouse. The first segment involves a haunted house that is based on various haunted house films, primarily &quot;The Amityville Horror&quot; (1979) and &quot;Poltergeist&quot; (1982). In the second segment, Kang and Kodos are introduced when the Simpsons are abducted by aliens. The third segment is an adaptation of Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s 1845 poem &quot;The Raven&quot;. James Earl Jones guest starred in all three segments. The episode was received positively, being included in several critics&#x27; &quot;best of&quot; lists. Critics singled out &quot;The Raven&quot; for praise, although &quot;Simpsons&quot; creator Matt Groening was concerned that it would be seen as pretentious.

==Plot==
On Halloween, Bart, Lisa and Maggie sit in the treehouse and tell scary stories. Homer, who had just come home from trick or treating, eavesdrops on them.

&quot;Bad Dream House&quot; (told by Bart)

The Simpsons move into an eighteen bedroom house they got a good deal on. The walls of the cursed house begin to bleed and objects begin to fly through the air, Lisa senses an evil presence in the house (judging by the ghostly, echoing voice that tells the family to get out). There is also a portal to another dimension, a vortex, in the kitchen: Homer tests it out by throwing an orange in it.

A piece of paper is thrown back at him as a response (on it is written &quot;Quit throwing your garbage into our dimension&quot;). Marge expresses the desire to leave, but Homer asks her to sleep on it. That night, the house possesses Homer and the children, manipulating their minds and making them chase each other with axes and knives. Unlike the others however, Marge is using her knife to spread mayonnaise on a sandwich and intervenes, breaking the trance. Afterwards, Lisa discovers the source of the haunting—a Native American burial ground hidden in the basement (something which the realtors had apparently mentioned to Homer repeatedly). After the house threatens them again, Marge confronts the house, demanding that it treat them with respect during their stay. The house thinks it over and opts to destroy itself rather than live with the Simpsons.

&quot;Hungry Are the Damned&quot; (told by Bart)

The Simpsons are abducted from their backyard by two aliens named Kang and Kodos. The aliens take the Simpsons to their home planet Rigel IV for a feast. En route they present the Simpsons with enormous amounts of food and watch eagerly as the Simpsons gorge themselves.

Suspicious of the aliens&#x27; intentions, Lisa finds a book in the kitchen titled &quot;How to Cook Humans&quot;. Kang blows off space dust obscuring the real title, &quot;How To Cook for Forty Humans&quot;. Enraged at Lisa&#x27;s mistrust, the aliens return the Simpsons to Earth, rebuking the family for ruining their chance at paradise on the planet.

&quot;The Raven&quot; (read by Lisa)

In this adaptation of Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s &quot;The Raven&quot;, Bart is depicted as the raven, Homer appears as the poem&#x27;s narrator, and Marge appears in a portrait as Lenore. The Narrator, infuriated by the Raven&#x27;s mockery of his grief over his lost Lenore, flies into a fit of rage chasing it across his study, ending with the Raven&#x27;s eventual victory and the Narrator staring helplessly at it as he sits on the floor amid a scatter of books and broken objects.

Back at the treehouse, Bart, Lisa and Maggie find they are not frightened by any of the stories, considering them to be tame by today&#x27;s standards. They climb down the treehouse and sleep peacefully, while Homer lies awake in bed, terrified of the stories. As they&#x27;re lying in bed, Homer notices the Bart raven outside their bedroom window.

==Production==
Unlike a typical &quot;Simpsons&quot; episode, &quot;Treehouse of Horror&quot; is divided into three segments. It is the first in the &quot;Treehouse of Horror&quot; series of Halloween themed &quot;Simpsons&quot; episodes. It is considered to be non-canon and takes place outside the normal continuity of the show. A &quot;Treehouse of Horror&quot; episode has since aired around Halloween every season. Part of the series&#x27; attraction for the writers is that they are able to break the rules and include violence that would not make it into a regular episode. The episode was inspired by EC Comics horror comics, such as &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot;. In the first segment, several haunted house films are parodied, including &quot;House of Usher&quot;, &quot;The Haunting&quot;, &quot;The Amityville Horror&quot; and &quot;The Shining&quot;. The haunted house being built on a burial ground is inspired by the 1982 film &quot;Poltergeist&quot;. The house was also designed to look like the Addams family house. The second segment&#x27;s cookbook is a reference to the 1962 &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; episode &quot;To Serve Man&quot;. The third segment reimagines Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s &quot;The Raven&quot;.

In 2011, staff writer Al Jean commented on the episode: &quot;The idea of it to parody EC Comics was really original and kind of shocking for a cartoon on network television. [Executive producer] Jim Brooks said, &#x27;We better have a disclaimer at the beginning of this Halloween show,&#x27; so Marge came out and warned people that they were going to see something scary. And the funny thing is it&#x27;s now very tame by our Halloween standards and by network animation standards.&quot; According to M. Keith Booker, author of &quot;Drawn to Television&quot;, the warning only made the episode more attractive to children. The entire segment was a parody of the opening of the 1931 film &quot;Frankenstein&quot;. While similar &quot;warnings&quot; were used to open the second and third &quot;Treehouse&quot; episodes, these quickly became a burden to write and there was no warning for the fourth episode. Instead, it had Marge ask Bart to warn people how frightening the show was during his introduction paying homage to &quot;Night Gallery&quot;. The tradition was revived for &quot;Treehouse of Horror V&quot;; after that, they were permanently dropped and the writers did not make any attempts at reviving them. In the opening segment of the episode, and the four subsequent episodes, the camera zooms through a cemetery where tombstones with humorous epitaphs can be seen. These messages include the names of canceled shows from the previous television season and celebrities such as Walt Disney and Jim Morrison. They were last used in &quot;Treehouse of Horror V&quot;, which included a solitary tombstone with the words &quot;Amusing Tombstones&quot; to signal this. The tombstone gags were easy for the writers in the first episode, but like Marge&#x27;s warnings, they eventually got more difficult to write, so they were abandoned. Of the series, &quot;Treehouse of Horror&quot; was the only one that included a treehouse as a setting. &quot;Treehouse of Horror&quot; was the first time an alternate version of the theme that airs over the end credits was used. Originally it was supposed to use a theremin (an early electronic musical instrument), but one could not be found that could hit all the necessary notes.

Alf Clausen, who has scored most of the &quot;Simpsons&quot; music, began his work on the show with this episode. The first segment, &quot;Bad Dream House&quot;, was written by John Swartzwelder and directed by Wes Archer. The voice of the house was provided by cast member Harry Shearer. Jay Kogen and Wallace Wolodarsky wrote the second segment, &quot;Hungry are the Damned&quot;, and Rich Moore directed it. Sam Simon wrote the third segment, &quot;The Raven&quot;, and David Silverman directed it. The segment was based on Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s 1845 narrative poem &quot;The Raven&quot;. During production, &quot;Simpsons&quot; creator Matt Groening was nervous about &quot;The Raven&quot; because it did not have many gags, and felt it would be &quot;the worst, most pretentious thing [they had] ever done&quot; on the show. American actor James Earl Jones guest starred in the episode as a moving man, Serak the Preparer (one of the aliens) and the narrator of &quot;The Raven&quot;. Unable to work with the rest of the cast, Jones recorded his lines at the Village Recorder in West Los Angeles; he chewed on a cookie close to his microphone to perform drooling sounds for the aliens.

The sibling aliens Kang and Kodos first appeared on the show on this episode. Every &quot;Treehouse of Horror&quot; episode since this one must have Kang and Kodos as characters, states an unofficial &quot;Simpsons&quot; rule. Despite this rule, the writers say the duo will often be forgotten and then added at the last second, leading to brief appearances. The idea of Kang and Kodos came from Kogen and Wolodarsky. In the script, Kang and Kodos were shown as &quot;an octopus in a space helmet with a trail of goo&quot;. The finished design was based on the cover of an EC Comics issue. Although originally designed to constantly drool, Groening suggested that they not drool all the time to make the animation process easier. However, the animators did not mind the work, leading to the drooling staying in the script. Kang and Kodos&#x27;s names are derived from two &quot;Star Trek&quot; characters. Kang was a Klingon captain portrayed by actor Michael Ansara in the episode &quot;Day of the Dove&quot;, whereas Kodos the Executioner was a human villain from &quot;The Conscience of the King&quot;. Harry Shearer voices Kang, and Dan Castellaneta voices Kodos. A third alien named Serak the Preparer also made its first and only appearance in the series.

==Reception==
In its original broadcast, &quot;Treehouse of Horror&quot; finished 25th in ratings for the week of October 22–28, 1990, with a Nielsen rating of 15.7, equivalent to approximately 14.6 million viewing households. It was the highest-rated show on Fox that week, beating &quot;Married... with Children&quot;.

Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. In 1998, &quot;TV Guide&quot; listed it in its list of top twelve &quot;Simpsons&quot; episodes. &quot;The Guardian&quot; named it one of the five greatest episodes in &quot;Simpsons&quot; history. The authors of the book &quot;I Can&#x27;t Believe It&#x27;s a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide&quot;, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, said the first two segments worked better than the third, &quot;but this is a marvelous episode, and set a high standard for the Halloween specials to come&quot;. In 2008, Canwest News Service chose &quot;Treehouse of Horror&quot; as one of the top five scariest episodes from television&#x27;s past. They singled out Marge saying &quot;This family has had its differences and we&#x27;ve squabbled, but we&#x27;ve never had knife fights before, and I blame this house&quot; as a memorable line from the episode. Two of the episode&#x27;s segments were singled out by critics as exemplary parts of the &quot;Treehouse of Horror&quot; series. &quot;The Raven&quot; was selected as the second best &quot;Treehouse of Horror&quot; segment by Ryan J. Budke of TV Squad in 2005. Budke described the segment as &quot;one of the most refined &quot;Simpsons&quot; pop references ever&quot; and knows &quot;people [who] consider this the point that they realized &quot;The Simpsons&quot; could be both highly hilarious and highly intelligent&quot;. &quot;Hungry are the Damned&quot; was selected as the fifth best &quot;Treehouse of Horror&quot; segment by Eric Goldman, Dan Iverson and Brian Zoromski of IGN in 2008. The IGN reviewers singled out the &quot;How to Cook for Forty Humans&quot; section of the segment as its funniest moment.

Critics also praised the episode&#x27;s relationship to various television shows and Poe&#x27;s &quot;The Raven&quot;. Michael Stailey of &quot;DVD Verdict&quot; described the three &quot;Treehouse of Horror&quot; segments as &quot;brilliantly crafted tales capturing the best elements of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, &quot;Outer Limits&quot;, and &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;, injecting them into the Simpsons&#x27; universe&quot;. DVD reviewer Doug Pratt described &quot;The Raven&quot; as a &quot;perfect adaptation&quot;. Kurt M. Koenigsberger said in his book &quot;Leaving Springfield&quot; that &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, while &quot;not strictly a literary form... is certainly the most literate of all situation comedies&quot;. Koenigsberger uses &quot;The Raven&quot; as one example in support of the statement &quot;&quot;The Simpsons&quot; is steeped in the American literary context into which Arnold Bennett made such a splash on his tour in 1911.&quot;

==In popular media==
A clip from the &quot;Hungry are the Damned&quot; segment is shown on a TV in a hotel room in Gus Van Sant&#x27;s 1991 film &quot;My Own Private Idaho&quot;.

<text>A business telephone system is a telephone system typically used in business environments, encompassing the range of technology from the key telephone system (KTS) to the private branch exchange (PBX).

A business telephone system differs from an installation of several telephones with multiple central office (CO) lines in that the CO lines used are directly controllable in key telephone systems from multiple telephone stations, and that such a system often provides additional features for call handling. Business telephone systems are often broadly classified into key telephone systems and private branch exchanges, but many combinations (hybrid telephone systems) exist.

A key telephone system was originally distinguished from a private branch exchange in that it did not require an operator or attendant at a switchboard to establish connections between the central office trunks and stations, or between stations. Technologically, private branch exchanges share lineage with central office telephone systems, and in larger or more complex systems, may rival a central office system in capacity and features. With a key telephone system, a station user could control the connections directly using line buttons, which indicated the status of lines with built-in lamps.

==Key telephone system==

Key telephone systems are primarily defined by arrangements with individual line selection buttons for each available telephone line. The earliest systems were known as &quot;wiring plans&quot; and simply consisted of telephone sets, keys, lamps, and wiring.

&quot;Key&quot; was a Bell System term of art for a customer-controlled switching system such as the line buttons on the phones associated with such systems. The electrical components that allow for the selection of lines and features such as hold and intercom are housed in a panel or cabinet, called the &quot;key service unit&quot; or &quot;key system unit&quot; (KSU).

The wiring plans evolved into modular hardware building blocks with a variety of functionality and services in the 1A key telephone system developed in the Bell System in the 1930s.

Key systems can be built using three principal architectures: electromechanical shared-control, electronic shared-control, or independent key sets.

New installations of key telephone systems have become less common, as hybrid systems and private branch exchanges of comparable size have similar costs and greater functionality.

===Electromechanical shared-control key system===

Before the development of large-scale integrated circuits, key systems typically consisted of electromechanical components, such as relays, as were larger telephone switching systems.

The systems marketed in North America as the 1A, 1A1, 1A2 Key System, and the 6A, are typical examples and were sold for many decades. The Western Electric 1A family of key telephone units (KTUs) was introduced in the late 1930s and remained in use until the 1950s. 1A equipment was primitive and required at least two KTUs per line; one for line termination and one for station (telephone instrument) termination. The telephone instrument commonly used by 1A systems was the WECo 300/400-series telephone. Introduced in 1953, 1A1 key systems simplified wiring with a single KTU for both line and station termination, and increased the features available. As the 1A1 systems became commonplace, requirements for intercom features grew. The original intercom KTUs, WECo Model 207, were wired for a single talk link, that is, a single conversation on the intercom at a time. The WECo 6A dial intercom system provided two talk links and was often installed as the dial intercom in a 1A1 or 1A2 key system. The 6A systems were complex, troublesome, and expensive, and never became popular. The advent of 1A2 technology in 1964 simplified key system setup and maintenance. These continued to be used throughout the 1980s when the arrival of electronic key systems with their easier installation and greater features signaled the end of electromechanical key systems.

Two lesser-known key systems were used at airports for air traffic control communications, the 102 and 302 key systems. These were uniquely designed for communications between the air traffic control tower and radar approach control (RAPCON) or ground control approach (GCA) and included radio line connections.

Automatic Electric Company also produced a family of key telephone equipment, some of it compatible with Western Electric equipment, but it did not gain the widespread use enjoyed by Western Electric equipment.

===Electronic shared-control system===
With the advent of LSI ICs, the same architecture could be implemented much less expensively than was possible using relays. In addition, it was possible to eliminate the many-wire cabling and replace it with much simpler cable similar to (or even identical to) that used by non-key systems. Electronic shared-control systems led quickly to the modern hybrid telephone system, as the features of PBXs and key systems quickly merged. One of the most recognized such systems is the AT&amp;T Merlin.

Additionally, these more modern systems allowed a diverse set of features including:
* Answering machine functions
* Automatic call accounting
* Caller ID
* Remote supervision of the entire system
* Selection of signaling sounds
* Speed dialing
* Station-specific limitations (such as no long-distance access or no paging)

Features could be added or modified simply using software, allowing easy customization of these systems. The stations were easier to maintain than the previous electromechanical key systems, as they used efficient LEDs instead of incandescent light bulbs for line status indication.

LSI also allowed smaller systems to distribute the control (and features) into individual telephone sets that don&#x27;t require any single shared control unit. Such systems were dubbed &quot;KSU-less&quot;; the first such phone was introduced in 1975 with the Com Key 416. Generally, these systems are used with relatively few telephone sets and it is often more difficult to keep the feature set (such as speed-dialing numbers) in synchrony between the various sets.

==Hybrid key telephone system==
Into the 21st century, the distinction between key systems and PBX systems has become increasingly blurred. Early electronic key systems used dedicated handsets which displayed and allowed access to all connected PSTN lines and stations. 

The modern key system now supports SIP, ISDN, analog handsets (in addition to its own proprietary handsetsusually digital) as well as a raft of features more traditionally found on larger PBX systems. Their support for both analog and digital signaling, and of some PBX functionality gives rise to the &quot;hybrid&quot; designation.

A hybrid system typically has some call appearance buttons that directly correspond to individual lines and/or stations, but may also support direct dialing to extensions or outside lines without selecting a line appearance.

The modern key system is usually fully digital, although analog variants persist and some systems implement VOIP services. Effectively, the aspects that distinguish a PBX from a hybrid key system are the amount, scope, and complexity of the features and facilities offered.

==Private branch exchange==


A PBX is a telephone exchange or switching system that serves a private organization. A PBX permits the sharing of central office trunks between internally installed telephones, and provides intercommunication between those internal telephones within the organization without the use of external lines. The central office lines provide connections to the public switched telephone network (PSTN) and the concentration aspect of a PBX permits the shared use of these lines between all stations in the organization. Its intercommunication ability allows two or more stations to directly connect while not using the public switched telephone network. This method reduces the number of lines needed from the organization to the public switched telephone network.

Each device connected to the PBX, such as a telephone, a fax machine, or a computer modem, is referred to as an extension and has a designated extension telephone number that may or may not be mapped automatically to the numbering plan of the central office and the telephone number block allocated to the PBX.

Initially, PBX systems offered the primary advantage of cost savings for internal phone calls: handling the circuit switching locally reduced charges for telephone service via central-office lines. As PBX systems gained popularity, they began to feature services not available in the public network, such as hunt groups, call forwarding, and extension dialing. From the 1960s, a simulated PBX, known as Centrex, provided similar features from the central telephone exchange.

A PBX differs from a key telephone system (KTS) in that users of a key system manually select their own outgoing lines on special telephone sets that control buttons for this purpose, while PBXs select the outgoing line automatically. The telephone sets connected to a PBX do not normally have special keys for central-office line control, but it is not uncommon for key systems to be connected to a PBX to extend its services.

A PBX, in contrast to a key system, employs an organizational numbering plan for its stations. In addition, a dial plan determines whether additional digit sequences must be prefixed when dialing to obtain access to a central office trunk. Modern number-analysis systems permit users to dial internal and external telephone numbers without special codes to distinguish the intended destination.

===History===

The term PBX originated when switchboard operators managed company switchboards manually using cord circuits. As automated electromechanical switches and later electronic switching systems gradually replaced the manual systems, the terms &quot;private automatic branch exchange (PABX)&quot; and &quot;private manual branch exchange (PMBX)&quot; differentiated them. Solid-state digital systems were sometimes referred to as &quot;electronic private automatic branch exchanges (EPABX)&quot;. , the term PBX is by far the most widely recognized. The abbreviation now applies to all types of complex, in-house telephony switching systems.

Two significant developments during the 1990s led to new types of PBX systems. One was the massive growth of data networks and increased public understanding of packet switching. Companies needed packet-switched networks for data, so using them for telephone calls proved tempting, and the availability of the Internet as a global delivery system made packet-switched communications even more attractive. These factors led to the development of the voice over IP PBX, or IP PBX.

The other trend involved the idea of focusing on core competence. PBX services had always been hard to arrange for smaller companies, and many companies realized that handling their own telephony was not their core competence. These considerations gave rise to the concept of the hosted PBX. In wireline telephony, the original hosted PBX was the Centrex service provided by telcos since the 1960s; later competitive offerings evolved into the modern competitive local exchange carrier. In voice-over IP, hosted solutions are easier to implement as the PBX may be located at and managed by any telephone service provider, connecting to the individual extensions via the Internet. The upstream provider no longer needs to run direct, local leased lines to the served premises.

====Manual PBX====
Many manufacturers provided manually operated private branch exchange systems in various sizes and features; examples are pictured here:
===System components===

A PBX system often includes the following:
* Cabinets, closets, vaults, and other housings
* Console or switchboard allowing an operator to control incoming calls
* Interconnecting wires and cables
* Logic cards, switching and control cards, power cards, and related devices that facilitate PBX operation
* Microcontroller or microcomputer for arbitrary data processing, control and logic
* Outside trunks connecting the PBX to the public switched telephone network
* Stations, or telephone sets, sometimes called &quot;lines&quot; by metonymy
* The PBX&#x27;s internal switching network
* Uninterruptible power supply (UPS) consisting of sensors, power switches, and batteries

===Current trends===
Since the advent of Internet telephony (Voice over IP) technologies, PBX development has tended toward the IP PBX, which uses the Internet Protocol to carry calls. Most modern PBXs support VoIP. ISDN PBX systems also replaced some traditional PBXs in the 1990s, as ISDN offers features such as conference calling, call forwarding, and programmable caller ID. As of 2015, ISDN is being phased out by most major telecommunication carriers throughout Europe in favor of all-IP networks, with some expecting complete migration by 2025.
Originally having started as an organization&#x27;s manual switchboard or attendant console operated by a telephone operator or just simply the &quot;operator&quot;, PBXs have evolved into VoIP centers that are hosted by the operators or even manufacturers.

Even though VoIP is considered by many people as the future of telephony, the circuit switched network remains the core of communications, and the existing PBX systems are competitive in services with modern IP systems. Five distinct scenarios exist:
* Hosted/virtual PBX (hosted and circuit-switched) or traditional Centrex
* IP Centrex or hosted/virtual IP (hosted and packet-switched)
* IP PBX (private and packet-switched)
* Mobile PBX solution (mobile phones replacing or used in combination with fixed phones)
* PBX (private and circuit-switched)

For the option to call from the IP network to the circuit-switched PSTN (SS7/ISUP), the hosted solutions include interconnecting media gateways.

===Home and small-business usage===
Historically, the expense of full-fledged PBX systems has put them out of reach of small businesses and individuals. However, since the 1990s many small, consumer-grade, and consumer-size PBXs have become available. These systems are not comparable in size, robustness, or flexibility to commercial-grade PBXs, but still provide many features.

The first consumer PBX systems used analog (POTS) telephone lines, typically supporting four private analog and one public analog line. They were the size of a small cigar box. In Europe, these systems for analog phones were followed by consumer-grade PBXs for ISDN. Using small PBXs for ISDN is a logical step since the ISDN basic rate interface provides two logical phone lines (via two ISDN B channels) that can be used in parallel. With the adoption of VoIP by consumers, consumer VoIP PBXs have appeared, with PBX functions becoming simple additional software features of consumer-grade routers and switches. Additionally, many telecommunications providers now offer hosted PBX systems where the provider actually hosts the PBX and the phone handsets are connected to it through an internet connection.

Open source projects have provided PBX-style features since the 1990s. These projects provide flexibility, features, and programmability.

===PBX functions===
Functionally, the PBX performs four main call processing duties:
* Establishing connections (circuits) between the telephone sets of two users (e.g. mapping a dialed number to a physical phone, ensuring the phone isn&#x27;t already busy)
* Maintaining such connections as long as the users require them (i.e. channeling voice signals between the users)
* Disconnecting those connections as per the user&#x27;s requirement
* Providing information for accounting purposes (e.g. metering calls)

In addition to these basic functions, PBXs offer many other calling features and capabilities, with different manufacturers providing different features in an effort to differentiate their products.
Common capabilities include (manufacturers may have a different name for each capability):

* Auto attendant
* Auto dialing
* Automated directory services (where callers can be routed to a given employee by keying or speaking the letters of the employee&#x27;s name)
* Automatic call distributor
* Automatic ring back
* Busy override
* Call blocking
* Call forwarding on busy or absence
* Call logging
* Call park
* Call pick-up
* Call transfer
* Call waiting
* Call whisper
* Camp-on
* Conference call
* Custom greetings
* Customized abbreviated dialing (speed dialing)
* Direct inward dialing (DID)
* Direct inward system access (DISA) (the ability to access internal features from an outside telephone line)
* Do not disturb (DND)
* Follow-me, also known as find-me: Determines the routing of incoming calls. The exchange is configured with a list of numbers for a person. When a call is received for that person, the exchange routes it to each number on the list in turn until either the call is answered or the list is exhausted (at which point the call may be routed to a voice mail system).
* Interactive voice response
* Local connection: Another useful attribute of a hosted PBX is the ability to have a local number in cities in which you are not physically present. This service essentially lets you create a virtual office presence anywhere in the world.
* Music on hold
* Night service
* Public address voice paging
* Shared message boxes (where a department can have a shared voicemail box)
* Voice mail
* Voice message broadcasting
* Welcome message

===Interface standards===

Interfaces for connecting extensions to a PBX include:
* DECT – a standard for connecting cordless phones.
* Internet Protocol – For example, H.323 and SIP.
* POTS (plain old telephone service) – the common two-wire interface used in most homes. This is cheap and effective and allows almost any standard phone to be used as an extension.
* proprietary – the manufacturer has defined a protocol. One can only connect the manufacturer&#x27;s sets to their PBX, but the benefit is more visible information displayed and/or specific function buttons.

Interfaces for connecting PBXs to each other include:
* DPNSS – for connecting PBXs to trunk lines. Standardized by British Telecom, this usually runs over E1 (E-carrier) physical circuits.
* Internet Protocol – H.323 and the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) are IP-based solutions for multimedia sessions.
* Primary rate interface (ISDN) – Provided over T1 (23 bearer channels and 1 signaling channel) or E1 carriers.
* Proprietary protocols – if equipment from several manufacturers is on-site, the use of a standard protocol is required.
* QSIG – for connecting PBXs to each other, usually runs over T1 (T-carrier) or E1 (E-carrier) physical circuits.

Interfaces for connecting PBXs to trunk lines include:
* Internet Protocol – H.323, SIP, MGCP, and Inter-Asterisk eXchange protocols operate over IP and are supported by some network providers.
* ISDN – the most common digital standard for fixed telephony devices. This can be supplied in either Basic (2-circuit capacity) or Primary (24- or 30-circuit capacity) versions. Most medium to large companies would use Primary ISDN circuits carried on T1 or E1 physical connections.
* RBS (robbed bit signaling) – delivers 24 digital circuits over a four-wire (T1) interface
* standard POTS (plain old telephone service) lines – the common two-wire interface used in most domestic homes. This is adequate only for smaller systems and can suffer from not being able to detect incoming calls when trying to make an outbound call (commonly called glare).

Interfaces for collecting data from the PBX:
* File – the PBX generates a file containing the call records from the PBX.
* Network port (listen mode) – an external application connects to the TCP or UDP port. The PBX streams information to the application.
* Network port (server mode) – the PBX connects to another application or buffer.
* Serial interface – historically used to print every call record to a serial printer. In modern systems, a software application connects via serial cable to this port.

A data record from a PBX or other telecommunication system that provides the statistics for a telephone call is usually termed a &quot;call detail record&quot; (CDR) or a Station Messaging Detail Record (SMDR).

===Hosted PBX systems===
Virtual PBX systems or hosted PBX systems deliver PBX functionality as a service, available over the public switched telephone network (PSTN) or the Internet. Hosted PBXs are typically provided by a telephone company or service provider, using equipment located in the premises of a telephone exchange or the provider&#x27;s data center. This means the customer does not need to buy or install PBX equipment. Generally, the service is provided by a lease agreement and the provider can, in some configurations, use the same switching equipment to service multiple hosted PBX customers.

The first hosted PBX services were feature-rich compared to most premises-based systems of the time. Some PBX functions, such as follow-me calling, appeared in a hosted service before they became available in hardware PBX equipment. Since its introduction, updates and new offerings have moved feature sets in both directions. It is possible to get hosted PBX services that include feature sets from minimal functionality to advanced feature combinations.

In addition to the features available from premises-based PBX systems, hosted PBX:
* allows a single number to be presented for the entire company, despite its being geographically distributed. A company could even choose to have no premises, with workers connected from home using their domestic telephones but receiving the same features as any PBX user.
* allows multimodal access, where employees access the network via a variety of telecommunications systems, including POTS, ISDN, cellular phones, and VOIP. This allows one extension to ring in multiple locations (either concurrently or sequentially).
* allows scalability so that a larger system is not needed if new employees are hired, and so that resources are not wasted if the number of employees is reduced.
* eliminates the need for companies to manage or pay for on-site hardware maintenance.
* supports integration with custom toll plans (that allow intra-company calls, even from private premises, to be dialed at a cheaper rate) and integrated billing and accounting (where calls made on a private line but on the company&#x27;s behalf are billed centrally to the company).

===Hosted PBX providers===
The ongoing migration of most major telecommunication carriers to IP-based networks, coupled with the rise in Cloud Communications has resulted in a significant rise in the uptake of hosted PBX solutions.

====Mobile PBX====
A mobile PBX is a hosted PBX service that extends fixed-line PBX functionality to mobile devices such as cellular handsets, smartphones, and PDA phones by provisioning them as extensions. Mobile PBX services also can include fixed-line phones. Mobile PBX systems are different from other hosted PBX systems that simply forward data or calls to mobile phones by allowing the mobile phone itself, through the use of buttons, keys, and other input devices, to control PBX phone functions and to manage communications without having to call into the system first.

A mobile PBX may exploit the functionality available in smartphones to run custom applications to implement the PBX-specific functionality.

In addition, a mobile PBX may create extension identifiers for each handset that allow to dial other cell phones in the PBX via their extension shortcut, instead of a PSTN number.

====IP-PBX====
An IP PBX handles voice calls over the Internet Protocol (IP), bringing benefits for computer telephony integration (CTI). An IP-PBX can exist as physical hardware or can carry out its functions virtually, performing the call-routing activities of the traditional PBX or key system as a software system. The virtual version is also called a &quot;Soft PBX&quot;.

<doc id="1017564" wikidata="Q20604" url="?curid=1017564" title="Trevi, Umbria">
<text>Trevi (; ) is an ancient town and (municipality) in Umbria, Italy, on the lower flank of overlooking the wide plain of the Clitunno river system. Located in the Province of Perugia, it is 10 km (6 mi) SSE of Foligno and 20 km (12 mi) north of Spoleto. It is one of I Borghi più belli d&#x27;Italia (&quot;The most beautiful villages of Italy&quot;).

The population of the was c. 8,000 in 2004, with the town proper accounting for about half of that; the rest lives in the (boroughs) of Borgo, Bovara, Cannaiola, Coste, Pigge, Manciano, Matigge, Parrano, Picciche, San Lorenzo and Santa Maria in Valle. The historical subdivisions of Trevi proper are the terzieri of Castello, Matiggia e Piano; they come into play only for the Palio.

Most of the town, densely inhabited and of decidedly medieval aspect, lies on sharply sloping terrain, only the very center being more or less flat. It commands one of the best views in Umbria, extending over 50 km (30 mi) in most westerly directions. Trevi is served by the main rail line from Rome to Ancona as well as the line from Florence to Rome via Perugia.

==Geography==

The territory of the extends over 71 km2 from the valley (210 m) to Mts. Brunette (1422 m) and Serano (1429 m) and can be divided into three more or less equal zones: plain, hills, and mountain; each with its own characteristic vegetation. In the plain, the very fertile land is well irrigated by many watercourses, heirs for the most part to the of Antiquity, and is suited to annual crops. The hills, of a very loose alkaline limestone with excellent drainage, are an ideal terrain for the intensive and highly specialized cultivation of olive trees that produce a very characteristic and highly prized oil. Finally, the mountains are covered in meadows and forests, primarily deciduous.

The natural environment of the territory as a whole remains largely unspoiled, this despite being significantly populated for millennia. The mountainous area is now witnessing a considerable depopulation — as elsewhere in Italy, in the second half of the 20th century settlements at the highest elevations have been rapidly losing their inhabitants to the plains. The most important growth areas since the period following World War II have been Borgo Trevi (commercial, residential, and offices), Pietrarossa (industrial), and Matigge (light and medium industry, commercial).

Many rivers and canals, none of them very large, run in a general south-to-north direction, converging into a single river near Bevagna. Their courses are by now highly artificial, the result of land and water management projects undertaken over many centuries, since they are recorded at least as early as the time of Theodoric the Great (6th century) and have continued down to our own time with the construction of dams and works to regularize the seasonal waters of the Marroggia that had been subject to frequent torrential overflows with sudden and disastrous results.

The most important of the year-round watercourses is the Clitunno River, celebrated in antiquity as the Clitumnus, whose deified waters were reputed to have miraculous properties and which have been lauded in prose and verse by Pliny the Younger, Propertius, Claudian, Addison, Byron and Carducci.

Trevi borders the following municipalities: Campello sul Clitunno, Castel Ritaldi, Foligno, Montefalco, Sellano, Spoleto.

==History==

In Antiquity, Pliny the Elder mentioned Trevi as a city of the ancient Umbrians, which has been confirmed by the find of an Umbrian inscription within the territory of the comune, at Bovara, in the 1950s. &quot;Treviae&quot; is also mentioned in the 5th‑century Bordeaux Itinerary. After the earliest period, the history of which is essentially unknown, but to which the walls in the core hill portion of the town attest, dated to the 1st century BC, the first stage of the development of Trevi beyond the hill took place under the Empire, when Hadrian restored the main road through the territory, the Via Flaminia, thus spurring the growth of a suburb in the plain at the place now called Pietrarossa, where sporadic excavations over several centuries have brought to light many remains: among them Roman baths that appear to have been still more or less in use in the time of St. Francis, who is known to have visited the area and to have advised people to bathe there.

In antiquity Trevi is said to have had jurisdiction over much of the valley below, all the way to the Monti Martani that form the central backbone of Umbria. The seat of a bishop until the 11th century, Trevi was a Lombard gastaldate, then, in the early 13th century, freed itself of outside rulership to become a free commune. It generally allied itself with Perugia in order to defend itself from nearby Spoleto, and fought several wars with other neighboring communes, with varying outcomes, including invasion by Spoleto in the 14th century and a brief but unhappy rule of the Trinci warlords of Foligno. In 1438 Trevi passed under the temporal rule of the Church as part of the legation of Perugia, and thenceforth its history merges first with that of the States of the Church, then (1860) with the united Kingdom of Italy.

Trevi&#x27;s best fortunes were in the 15th century, when its commercial importance was such that it was called &quot;il porto secco&quot; — the dry port. In 1470, along with Foligno, Trevi became the fourth town in Italy to have a printing press, managed by the first known printing company. The wealth of this period can still be seen in a number of Renaissance mansions in town.

Durastante Natalucci (1687–1772) was an Italian historian who specialized in the history of Trevi.

==Main sights==

Trevi is enclosed in two circuits of medieval walls; in the late 20th century, the inner circuit was shown to be of Roman origin.

Trevi has about twenty old churches, several of which are of note:
*The &quot;Duomo &quot;of &quot;Sant&#x27; Emiliano &quot;is a Romanesque building with a carved door and an apse with carved corbels, the interior of which was significantly reworked in the 18th century.
*The &quot;Madonna delle Lacrime&quot; is a medieval conventual church with large votive frescoes, including an Adoration of the Magi by Pietro Perugino, his last known signed and dated work. The chapel of Saint Francis was frescoed by Lo Spagna, one of Perugino&#x27;s pupils.
*S. Martino, with Lombard lapidary remains and good paintings by Mezzastris.
*S. Francesco, a large Gothic building, now housing a museum.
*San Pietro in Bovara is a medieval monastery in Bovara
*Santo Stefano in Manciano, another monastery in Manciano, has only its church remaining.

The territory of the &quot;comune&quot; is particularly rich in Romanesque churches: some of those in the plain, erected on the Roman Via Flaminia when that road was in use, and incorporating a fair amount of Roman spolia, remain as markers of the road&#x27;s course.

==Museums==

Trevi&#x27;s main museum is the Museo S. Francesco, attached to the Gothic church of that name, now secularized; it contains some slight Roman lapidary material, but a more important collection of Umbrian painting from the late Middle Ages through the 17th century: the main work is the &quot;Coronation of the Virgin&quot; altarpiece by Lo Spagna, originally in San Martino. Particularly notable are a group of ex-votos representative of 16th‑ through 18th‑century folk art.

The Museo della Civiltà dell&#x27; Olivo provides an educational look at the olive industry, from the planting of the olive through its processing into oil; the Trevi Flash Art Museum (Now Museum of Palazzo Lucarini) houses contemporary art exhibitions.

==Economy==

The mainstays of Trevi&#x27;s economy are olive oil and tourism.

The &quot;comuni&quot; of Trevi and Spoleto are known for the quality of their oil, a result of near-ideal calcareous soil with excellent drainage, just the right altitude for the cultivation of olive trees, and favourable climatic conditions on the west-facing lower slopes of the Apennine mountain range.

Trevi&#x27;s good train and highway access has made the town the most convenient base for visiting central Umbria for those who rely on public transportation; the unusual number of good restaurants in the &quot;comune&quot; is partly the cause, partly the result of increased tourism.

Trevi also has some light industry and food processing other than olive oil.

==Holidays and local events==
The patron saint of Trevi is St. Emiliano; his feast is celebrated on January 27 with a night-time procession of the &quot;Illuminata&quot;, in which his statue is carried out of the Duomo around the city along the line of the earliest medieval walls.

Shrove Tuesday sees a public celebration in the main piazza, and August a 3‑week-long music festival; but the main annual festivals take place in October: the Palio on the first Sunday, the Celery and Sausage Fair (&quot;Sagra del Sedano Nero e della Salsiccia&quot;) on the third Sunday, and a historical pageant on the fourth Sunday.

<text>Jonny Walker (born September 13, 1974) is an American former professional soccer goalkeeper who is currently the associate head coach of the University of Memphis Women&#x27;s Soccer Team. Walker played professionally in Chile and the United States, including two stints with Major League Soccer (MLS). He earned three caps with the United States Men&#x27;s National Team (USMNT). Walker was the first American to establish a successful professional soccer career in South America.

==Playing career==
In the summer of 1994, Jonny Walker played for the Memphis Jackals of the USISL. He then played one season with the University of Louisville and still holds the record for most saves in a match (17), versus Evansville (September 8, 1994). He also has the most saves in a single season for a Cardinal with 151 (1994). He was named to the All-Metro Conference First Team in 1994. Walker represented the University of Louisville at the 1995 World University Games in Japan. He also participated in the 1995 Olympic Festival games in Denver, where he played for the South Team. Walker was one of only two goalkeepers in the country to be invited for full time residency at the ARCO Olympic Training Center in preparation for the &#x27;96 Olympic Games.

Upon the formation of Major League Soccer (MLS) in 1996, Walker was drafted 28th overall in the 1996 MLS Supplemental Draft, and became a third-string goalkeeper of the 1996 Dallas Burn, behind Mark Dodd. Unhappy with his situation, he left MLS and played for the now-defunct Jacksonville Cyclones of the A-League.

On a recommendation, Walker went to Chile and signed with First Division Club, Universidad Católica. They loaned him out to Club Deportivo Huachipato of Chile&#x27;s First Division in 1998, in which we was named Team MVP, then U. Catolica brought him back the following year. He became the starting goalkeeper for the club, playing in multiple Copa Libertadores tournaments, which included wins against Argentina&#x27;s Boca Juniors and Brazil&#x27;s Flamengo. From 1997 to 2002, Walker broke numerous national records for Universidad Catolica. In 1999, U. Catolica finished runners-up in the Chilean National Championship. In 2001, Walker received Chilean Goalkeeper of the Year honors, while U. Catolica finished Runners-Up in the Chilean National Championship. That year, U. Catolica advanced to play in Copa Mercosur for the fourth straight season. They also competed in the Copa Libertadores. In 2002, Walker was named Best Goalkeeper of the Chilean Apertura National Championship as well set a Club record going 708 minutes (almost nine games) without being scored on, a record that held until 2008. Also in 2002, Walker led U. Catolica to win the Chilean Apertura National Championship. He was also named Best Goalkeeper in Round One of prestigious South American Championship, Copa Libertadores, later that year.

In 2003, Walker signed with Chilean club, Colo-Colo, the only Chilean club to ever win the Copa Libertadores. Colo Colo finished Runners-Up in the Chilean Apertura National Championship that year and also played in the 2003 Copa Libertadores.

Walker came back to the US later that year, signing with the MetroStars, after starting goalkeeper Tim Howard signed with Manchester United. In 2003 with the MetroStars, Walker became the third goalkeeper in MLS history to finish a season with sub-1.00 Goals Against Average (GAA), capturing the league-best 0.95 GAA. That same year, Walker was the MLS Player of the Month for August and the MetroStars finished as Runners-Up in the US Open Cup. In 2005, The MetroStars signed Tony Meola and traded Walker to the Columbus Crew. With the Crew, Walker won the team&#x27;s 2005 Defensive Player of the Year and finished second in MLS with a GAA of 1.12. At the end of 2005 season, Walker injured his back and was sidelined until he retired in 2006 due to a chronic, inoperable back injury.

Walker started and played three matches for the United States Men&#x27;s National Team, including a 1–0 shutout win over Mexico on April 28, 2004. His first cap was against Denmark in January 2004.

Walker has been very involved with the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, giving free soccer clinics to kids who raise the most money through their soccer club for the Soccer Kicks for Cancer program. In 2005, Walker was named the Ambassador for the State of Tennessee for the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society.

==Coaching career==
In the fall of 2009, Jonny Walker became the Goalkeeper Coach for the University of Memphis Women&#x27;s Soccer Team. In 2010, Walker moved to Assistant Coach and then promoted to Associate Head Coach in 2019 and continues in that position to date. From 2009 to 2019, Walker has helped coach the Lady Tigers to five conference championship titles.

<doc id="1017567" wikidata="Q706885" url="?curid=1017567" title="Jānis Rudzutaks">
<text>Jānis Rudzutaks (; – 29 July 1938) was a Latvian Bolshevik revolutionary and a Soviet politician. He was executed during the Great Purge.

== Early life ==
Rudzutaks was born in the Kuldīga district of the Courland Governorate (present-day Kursīši parish, Saldus municipality, Latvia), the son of a farmhand. He started work as a swineherd after two years at parish school. In 1903 at the age of 16, he ran away to Riga, where he worked in a factory. Two years later he joined the Latvian Social Democratic Labour Party.

In 1907, Rudzutaks was arrested because of his political views and was sentenced to 10 years of hard labor by military court. He served a part of his sentence in Riga and was then transferred to Butyrka prison in Moscow. Rudzutaks was released after the February Revolution of 1917.

== Political career ==
After his release, Rudzutaks served in various positions in the All-Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) (RCP(b)) and the trade unions. As head of the State Water Transport Administration in 1918–19, he organised the emergency delivery of food supplies along the Volga to Moscow to enable the city to function during the civil war&#x27;s first month. In November 1919 he was posted to Tashkent as a member of the Turkestan Commission in charge of imposing communist rule in Central Asia. In March 1920 he was elected to the Central Committee of the RCP(b).

In November 1920 he was appointed Secretary of the All-Russian Central Council of Trade Unions. In that role he supported Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s position both against the Workers&#x27; Opposition, who wanted to put the unions in control of industry, and against the left, led by Leon Trotsky, who proposed incorporating the unions in the state apparatus. At the Tenth Congress of the RCP(b), which was dominated by arguments over the future of the unions, he was re-elected to the Central Committee with 467 votes - nine more than Josif Stalin.

Rudzutaks was ousted from his position as Secretary during the All Russian Congress of Trade Unions in May 1921, when he and the chairman, Mikhail Tomsky were blamed by Lenin and the Central Committee for failing to block a resolution put forward by the veteran Marxist, David Riazanov, that would have allowed union leaders to be elected by their own members rather than being selected by the party.

In April he was sent back to Tashkent, with Tomsky, to supervise the establishment of the Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. Alexander Barmine, the Soviet official who greeted them on arrival, remembered Rudzutaks as &quot;a tall fellow with spectacles and curly hair, his strong features set in a round face.&quot;

In April 1922 Rudzutaks was a member of the Soviet delegation at the Genoa Conference, where his task appears to have been to alert Moscow whenever the unpredictable foreign minister, Georgy Chicherin, departed from his negotiating brief. From 1922 to 1923 he was the chairman of Central Asian bureau of the Central Committee of the RCP(b).

In April 1923 Rudzutaks was recalled to Moscow to work as one of three secretaries of the Central Committee, working alongside Stalin, who was General Secretary. Early in 1924, Lenin wrote his famous Testament, calling for Stalin to be sacked. It was frequently rumoured that Lenin&#x27;s intention was to install Rudzutaks as the new General Secretary.

This story was mentioned in the memoirs of the Old Bolshevik Anastas Mikoyan, and in the novel &quot;Children of the Arbat&quot; by Anatoly Rybakov. It may be why Stalin removed him from the secretariat in May 1924 after Lenin&#x27;s death. He continued to hold high office, and backed Stalin against Trotsky and other opponents, including his former colleague, Tomsky.

From 1924 until 1934 he was the People&#x27;s Commissar (i.e., minister) for transportation. In 1926 Rudzutaks was appointed Deputy Chairman of the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars (the equivalent of Deputy Premier) and held this position until 1937. In January 1926 he was made a candidate member of the Politburo. In July he was raised to full membership in place of Grigory Zinoviev, who was expelled as a member of the left opposition.

In February 1932 Rudzutaks gave up his place on the Politburo on being appointed chairman of the Central Control Commission, and of &quot;Rabkrin&quot;, making him the principal judge in cases involving alleged breaches of Communist Party discipline. He was, outwardly, totally loyal to Stalin, maintaining that even to question whether Stalin should be subject to re-election was a betrayal of the Party. However, in February 1934, he was removed and replaced by the more hard-line Lazar Kaganovich. He was restored to the Politburo, but only as a candidate member, implying that he had been demoted.

== Arrest and execution ==
Rudzutaks was suddenly expelled from the Politburo and Central Committee on 24 May 1937 and arrested the next day, shortly after the arrest of the Red Army Marshal Mikhail Tukhachevsky. There are two conflicting stories about the circumstances of Rudzutaks&#x27;s arrest. One, published in the Soviet press in 1963, is that he was in a lively conversation in his dacha with Aleksandr Gerasimov and two other painters when he was seized. The other is that he was holding a supper party after a visit to the theatre, when the NKVD arrived and arrested everyone present.

Yevgenia Ginzburg, wife of a senior Bolshevik who survived the gulag, wrote about being forced to share a cell in Butyrki prison with 37 other women, four of whom were dressed in &quot;absurd low-cut evening dresses, crumpled and bedraggled with high heeled shoes.&quot; A fellow prisoner explained that they were Rudzutaks&#x27;s former dinner guests, who had been held for three months, and &quot;the poor things haven&#x27;t been allowed any parcels, so they&#x27;re still in their evening dress.&quot;

This was the first arrest of a sitting member or candidate member of the Politburo — with no record of ever having opposed the party line — and a signal that no one, however senior, apart from Stalin himself, was safe. Stalin&#x27;s crony Vyacheslav Molotov was asked, some 40 years later, to explain, and said that Rudzutaks was arrested because &quot;he was too easygoing about the opposition and considered it all nonsense, trifles. That was unforgivable&quot; and because &quot;he indulged too much in partying with philistine friends&quot;.

Rudzutaks showed great courage under torture. Molotov was one of a delegation from the Politburo who confronted him in prison, and recalled: &quot;Rudzutak said he had been badly beaten and tortured. Nevertheless he held firm. Indeed, he seemed to have been cruelly tortured&quot;.

He broke down under torture and confessed to being a spy, but retracted and insisted that he was innocent. He was included in a list of 118 former high-ranking Bolsheviks, which was passed to Stalin in July 1938, just as Lavrentiy Beria was about to take over control of the NKVD from the murderous Nikolai Yezhov.

Stalin instructed that they all be shot. At his trial, which lasted 20 minutes, Rudzutaks submitted a written statement protesting that &quot;there is in the NKVD an as yet not liquidated center which is craftily manufacturing cases, which forces innocent persons to confess. There is no opportunity to prove one’s non-participation in crimes to which the confessions of various persons testify. The investigative methods are such that they force people to lie and to slander entirely innocent persons&quot;. He was sentenced to death and executed on 28 July 1938.

After Stalin&#x27;s death, Rudzutaks was one of the first victims of the terror to have his case posthumously reviewed. He was cleared of all charges in 1955. His case featured prominently in Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s famous Secret Speech to the 1956 Communist Party congress.

<text>Wild Rivers is a water park in Irvine, California, United States. It opened in July 1986 on the site of the former Lion Country Safari. Following the expiration of its lease with The Irvine Company, it closed on September 25, 2011. Since the closure, there have been plans to recreate Wild Rivers in Irvine on or near the Orange County Great Park, which have been under development. The developers secured full funding and commenced construction on July 1, 2021, confirming the park&#x27;s reopening for Summer 2022. The new Wild Rivers location held its soft opening on July 10, 2022, up until its official grand opening as of July 29, 2022 and is 50% bigger than the old park.

== Original park ==
===History===
Before Wild Rivers was built, the land was a drive-through zoo called Lion Country Safari, which went bankrupt and closed in 1984. The park&#x27;s owner still held 13 years on the original 29-year lease for the land, which he then subleased to the operators of the Wild Rivers water park, the Camp Frasier (later Camp James) summer camp and the Verizon Wireless Amphitheatre.

Construction on Wild Rivers &quot;Mountain Top&quot; which would serve as the launch point for their largest rides, began in 1985 and the park itself opened in 1986. Congo River Rapids, Rattlesnake, and Python were the first large scale long form rides to open.

In early 2011, Wild Rivers announced that it had lost its lease with The Irvine Company. Both the park and the adjacent Camp James were scheduled to close at the end of the 2011 season. The park was planned to be demolished with 1,750 apartments being built in its place. A new water park was planned to be built on public land near the Orange County Great Park, and was scheduled to open to the public in May 2014.

== New water park at the Orange County Great Park ==
===History===
Since 2012, there had been attempts to redevelop Wild Rivers on or near the Orange County Great Park. A new Wild Rivers park was originally slated to open in May 2014, but it was then delayed a year later to May 2015 before it was cancelled altogether due to financial and land approval issues. In March 2016, the plans were revived and three months later, on June 26, 2016, the Great Park Board proposed two sites: one 35 acres and the other 60 acres. In late April 2017, Wild Rivers successfully negotiated a contract with the Irvine City Council, acting as the Orange County Great Park, paving the way for their return to Irvine as soon as summer 2019. As of March 2018, the park was planning on opening in a site on the former Marine Corps Air Station El Toro at the eastern corner of Marine Way and Skyhawk, but were waiting on environmental studies and approval from the US Navy. In August 2018, Wild Rivers announced that the park would not open until 2020 at the earliest, and as of April 2019 they had not finalized the lease terms and environmental study, and their exclusive agreement to negotiate with the city had expired. In January 2020, the city reached a tentative agreement with Wild Rivers for a new location within Great Park at the southern corner of Great Park Boulevard and Skyhawk, and the lease was approved in April. In July 2020, the park submitted plans to the city for review, and was planning to open in May 2022.

Construction of the park began in July 2021, after $60 million in financing was lined up, and 20 attractions were planned. Season passes for the 2022 season went on sale in November 2021.

<doc id="1017582" wikidata="Q559324" url="?curid=1017582" title="Captain Future">
<text>Captain Future is a pulp science fiction hero – a space-traveling scientist and adventurer – originally published in the United States in his namesake pulp magazine from 1940 to 1944. The character was created by editors Mort Weisinger and Leo Margulies. The majority of the stories were authored by Edmond Hamilton. A number of adaptations and derivative works followed.

A 1978–79 Japanese anime (キャプテン・フューチャー) was dubbed into several languages, including Spanish, French, German, Italian and Arabic. His francophone name is , although he is better known in francophone countries under the name .

==Origins==

Although sometimes mistakenly attributed to science fiction writer Edmond Hamilton, who indeed authored most of the Captain Future stories, the character was created by Better Publications editors Mort Weisinger and Leo Margulies before the 1st World Science Fiction Convention in 1939 and then announced there.

The original character was published by Ned Pines&#x27; Thrilling/Standard/Better publications company. A different Captain Future was published in Pine&#x27;s Nedor Comics line.

==Stories and art==
The stories were published in American pulp magazines from 1940 to 1951, featuring bright-colored cover illustrations by Earle K. Bergey and two fellow pulp artists. Captain Future&#x27;s originating adventures appeared in his namesake magazine, which ran from 1940 to 1944, coinciding with World War II. Bergey painted twelve of the seventeen &quot;Captain Future&quot; covers, and all ten subsequent &quot;Startling Stories&quot; covers under which additional Captain Future novels and novelettes were published. Of note, Bergey&#x27;s art for &quot;Captain Future&quot;, beginning with the third issue, marks the start of his groundbreaking work in the fields of science fiction and fantasy illustration.

While the first four issues of the &quot;Captain Future&quot; pulp are subtitled &quot;Wizard of Science&quot;, the remaining thirteen issues bear the header, &quot;Man of Tomorrow&quot;, shifting focus to the humanity of the titular hero, whose given name is Curtis Newton. A brilliant scientist and adventurer, Newton roams the solar system as Captain Future—solving problems, righting wrongs, and vanquishing futuristic supervillains. Published by Better Publications, an imprint of the expansive Thrilling Group of pulps, &quot;Captain Future&quot; gave readers the only explicitly science fiction and fantasy pulp hero in the history of American pulps.
The series makes assumptions about the Solar System which are outlandish by modern standards but which still seemed plausible, at least to most readers, when the stories were written. Every one of the planets of the Solar System, and many of the moons and asteroids, are suitable for life; most are occupied by humanoid extraterrestrials. The initial adventures take place in the planets of the Solar System. Later installments (after Captain Future invents the &quot;vibration drive&quot;) take the hero to other stars, other dimensions and even the distant past and almost to the end of the Universe. As an example, they visit the planet Aar in the Deneb system, which is the origin planet for Earth humans, as well as many other humanoids across the Solar System and beyond.

==Story overview==
Initially, the story was set in 1990. Hamilton quickly avoided exact dates except for past events, such as the voyages of the astronauts who first landed on most of the other planets of the Solar System. In later stories, if the date was asked or revealed, it was done so discreetly.

The series begins when genius scientist Roger Newton, his wife Elaine, and his fellow scientist Simon Wright leave planet Earth to do research in an isolated laboratory on the Moon, and to escape the predations of Victor Corvo (originally: Victor Kaslan), a criminal politician who wished to use Newton&#x27;s inventions for his own gain. Simon&#x27;s body is old and diseased and Roger enables him to continue doing research by transplanting his healthy brain into an artificial case (originally immobile—carried around by Grag—later equipped with lifter units). Working together, the two scientists create an intelligent robot called Grag, and an android with shape-shifting abilities called Otho. One day, Corvo arrives on the Moon and murders the Newtons; but before he can reap the fruits of his atrocity, Corvo and his killers are in turn slain by Grag and Otho.

The deaths of the Newtons leave their son, Curtis, to be raised by the unlikely trio of Otho, Grag, and Simon Wright. Under their tutelage, Curtis grows up to be a brilliant scientist and as strong and fast as any champion athlete. He also grows up with a strong sense of responsibility and hopes to use his scientific skills to help people. With that goal in his mind, he calls himself &quot;Captain Future&quot;; Simon, Otho and Grag are referred to as the &quot;Futuremen&quot; in subsequent stories. Other recurring characters in the series are the old space marshal Ezra Gurney, the beautiful Planet Patrol agent Joan Randall (who provides a love interest for Curtis), and James Carthew, President of the Solar System whose office is in New York City and who calls upon Future in extreme need.

Captain Future faces many enemies in his career but his archenemy is Ul Quorn, who is the only recurring villain in the series and appears in two different stories. He is part Martian - therefore called the &quot;Magician of Mars&quot; - but also the son of Victor Corvo, who murdered the Newtons. Quorn is a scientist whose abilities rival those of Captain Future.

==Stories==

== Characters ==
; Captain Future: Tall, athletic and handsome, with red hair, Captain Future was born on the Moon as Curtis Newton. After the death of his parents, he was trained by Professor Simon, Otho and Grag in all scientific and athletic pursuits necessary to fight crime and injustice across the Solar System.
; Prof. Simon Wright: A human brain living in a transparent, nuclear-powered life support case, with tentacle-mounted optics. He is Captain Future&#x27;s mentor and chief consultant in scientific matters.
; Grag and Otho: Grag is a seven-foot-tall metallic robot. Otho is a white-skinned android. Both were created by Roger Newton with artificial intelligence and human emotions to be friends and helpers to mankind. Grag and Otho have a friendly rivalry. Grag is big and strong, but not very bright, while Otho is quick-witted, agile, and (with the aid of a special chemical) able to alter his physical appearance.
; Eek and Oog: Grag and Otho&#x27;s pets, respectively. Eek is a &quot;moonpup&quot;, a canine creature which does not need air to survive and consumes soft metals for food. Oog is an amorphous being called a mimic, an artificially created pet that can change its shape as Otho does. Both are telepathic, and are attached to their respective master.
; Joan Randall: A beautiful female agent of the Planetary Police on Earth. She has brunette hair (or blonde hair in the anime adaptation). She shares a mutual romantic attraction with Curtis, but their respective duties prevent them from taking their relationship further.
; Marshall Ezra Gurney: A high-ranking veteran officer in the Planetary Police.
; Ul Quorn: Son of Victor Corvo, the man who murdered Captain Future&#x27;s parents. A scientific genius, he has chosen to use his intellect for evil purposes.
; Johnny Kirk: An orphan boy and a dedicated fan of the Futuremen. During his debut appearance in &quot;The Magician of Mars&quot;, he impresses Captain Future with his determination to become one of his crew, and is later entrusted to Joan and the Planetary Police to be trained as a future crew-member. He has an expanded role and different name (Ken Scott) in the anime.

== Technology ==
Captain Future&#x27;s spaceship, named the &quot;Comet,&quot; has been designed by himself and is superior to all other spaceships in the solar system. A research ship, the &quot;Comet&quot; has a compact on-board laboratory. It is also equipped with a camouflage device giving it the appearance of an actual comet, and armed with &quot;proton cannons&quot;. She only receives faster-than-light propulsion late in the series of novels. In the animated series, she has a &quot;hyperspace drive&quot; (in the Japanese version referred to as &quot;Warp Engine&quot;) and also a small auxiliary shuttlecraft called the &quot;Cosmoliner.&quot;

==Adaptations and other derivative works==

===Anime===


In 1978, one year after Hamilton&#x27;s death, Japanese company Toei Animation produced a anime television series of 53 episodes, based on 13 of the stories. Despite the differences in cultural references and medium, the animated series was true to the original in many ways, from the didactic scientific explanations to the emphasis on the usefulness of brains as opposed to brawn.

The series was translated in several languages and distributed globally. The four episodes comprising the series&#x27; second story arc were dubbed into English and released on video by ZIV International in the early 1980s as &quot;The Adventures of Captain Future&quot;. In the late 1980s, Harmony Gold dubbed the series&#x27; initial four-part story as an edited &quot;TV movie&quot; simply entitled &quot;Captain Future&quot;, but with alterations regarding some character names (different from those in Hamilton&#x27;s stories - whether for licensing law or other reasons, remains a broad field for speculation). A Blu-ray Box in Japanese only was released in September, 2016 (Box 1) and November, 2016 (Box 2). A German &quot;Limited Collectors Edition&quot; Blu-ray Box was released in December 2016, featuring not only the remastered Japanese uncut version (with German subtitles) but also the heavily cut German version.

While only eight episodes in total were dubbed into English, the series met huge success particularly in Japan, France, where the title and lead character&#x27;s name were changed to &quot;Capitaine Flam&quot;, in Italy with the translated title of &quot;Capitan Futuro&quot;, in Latin America and Spain with the title &quot;Capitán Futuro&quot;, in Taiwan with the title &quot;太空突擊隊&quot; (&quot;Space Commando&quot;). The Arabic-language version has the title of فارس الفضاء (Faris al-Fadha&#x27;a, or &quot;The Knight of Space&quot;) and was broadcast many times during the 1980s.

The series was also broadcast in Germany, where it appeared under its original title. However, this version was cut by about a quarter of the original length, which mainly affected violent scenes or those considered &quot;expendable&quot; for the storylines.

==== Score ====
The original incidental music was composed by Yuji Ohno, while the English-dubbed version had a new soundtrack composed by Mark Mercury. Mercury&#x27;s work survived on the Latin American version, but a new opening was added for it, composed by Shuki Levy and sung by Chilean performer Juan Guillermo Aguirre (a.k.a. &quot;Capitán Memo&quot;).

For the German version, a completely new soundtrack was created by German composer Christian Bruhn. To this day, the futuristic synth disco funk soundtrack is considered cult for giving the series the right feeling. A soundtrack CD was released in 1995. A remix of the theme &quot;Feinde greifen an&quot; (&quot;enemies attack&quot;) by German DJ Phil Fuldner, called &quot;The Final&quot;, entered the top ten of the German and Austrian single charts in 1998.

====Episodes====
===Related works by Allen Steele===
&quot;The Death of Captain Future&quot; (&quot;Asimov&#x27;s Science Fiction&quot;, October 1995) is a novella by American writer Allen Steele set in Steele&#x27;s &quot;Near Space&quot; realistic near future setting of expansion into the solar system. Here, Steele contrasts the more gritty setting with the naïvety of the titular character. In story, a man named Bo McKinnon collects &quot;ancient pulp magazines&quot; and acts out a fantasy life based on the Captain Future stories. The novella won the 1996 Hugo Award for Best Novella. An audio drama version of the story appeared as a play produced by Seeing Ear Theater. &quot;The Exile of Evening Star&quot; (&quot;Asimov&#x27;s Science Fiction&quot;, January 1999) continues and concludes the story. It includes many quotes from the original magazines.

Steele&#x27;s &quot;Avengers of the Moon: A Captain Future Novel&quot; (Tor Books 2017) is a continuity reboot which gently updates the narrative (including the science) to fit with a more modern sensibility. It was authorized by Hamilton&#x27;s estate. The novel features the main characters from the original stories and presents a new origin story for its protagonist. &quot;The Return of Ul Quorn&quot;, a quartet novella series published by the revived &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; magazine, followed as the sequel of &quot;Avengers of the Moon&quot;; the first entitled &quot;Captain Future in Love&quot; (2019), the second entitled &quot;The Guns of Pluto&quot; (2020), the third entitled &quot;1,500 Light Years from Home&quot; (2021), and the fourth entitled &quot;The Horror at Jupiter&quot; (2021). &quot;The Guns of Pluto&quot; included a reprint of Hamilton&#x27;s story &quot;The Harpers of Titan&quot; and &quot;1,500 Light Years from Home&quot; included a long-lost musical parody.
===Comics===
In the 1980s, German publisher Bastei-Verlag released a &quot;Captain Future&quot; comic series based on the anime series, with original adventures. In February 2025, French comic artist Alexis Tallone and author Sylvian Runberg obtained permission from Toei Animation to release a Captain Future comic based on the first story, &quot;Captain Future and the Space Emperor&quot;. While the anime design of the characters is largely retained, several changes were made to reflect their pulp fiction origins and actual technological advances since the stories were first penned.

=== Feature film ===
In March 2010, German Director Christian Alvart (&quot;Pandorum&quot;, &quot;Case 39&quot;) secured the film rights for Captain Future and is working on a live-action adaptation in 3D.

In 2015, a short trailer of a CGI version of &quot;Captain Future&quot; by Prophecy FX was leaked. The trailer was said to be a study for a yet-undisclosed project. In March 2016, Chris Alvart confirmed in an interview on a RocketBeansTV podcast to have acquired the design rights from TOEI Animation so that the movie will have the look and feel of the animated series.

===Other appearances===
*The Japanese TV series &quot;Captain Ultra&quot;, a placeholder series between two actual Ultraman series, was more or less a live-action adaptation of the &quot;Captain Future&quot; series (which has remained popular in Japan as well). The characters were all present, even if the names were changed.
*In the German Netflix series &quot;Dark,&quot; Mikkel Nielsen is given a &quot;Captain Future&quot; magazine to occupy himself while he recuperates in hospital from injuries while cave exploring. When he tells the nurse looking after him he is from the future, his claims are simply dismissed as having an overactive imagination inspired by the magazine.
*In the TV series &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;, a Captain Future magazine cover is featured as a wall poster beside the entrance door in Leonard&#x27;s and Sheldon&#x27;s apartment.
*In &quot;Cat Planet Cuties&quot;, Episode 9 features a well known song from the anime television series of Captain Future.
*In the Pre-Crisis DC Comics, a character named Edmond Hamilton was featured as a minor adversary of Superman. This character, as a result of his homonymy with the science fiction author and his most famous work, took up the identity of Colonel Future and ended up battling Superman despite having heroic intentions. This character is a homage to the real Edmond Hamilton and his work in DC Comics.

==Moons of Pluto==
In the story &quot;Calling Captain Future&quot;, three (then undiscovered) moons of Pluto are named Charon, Styx, and Cerberus after mythological characters associated with the Greek god Pluto. Three of Pluto&#x27;s five moons were ultimately given the names Charon, Styx, and Kerberos (the Greek spelling of Cerberus).

<doc id="1017591" wikidata="Q2659593" url="?curid=1017591" title="Charlie X">
<text>&quot;Charlie X&quot; is the second broadcast episode of the first season of the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Written by Dorothy C. Fontana from a story by Gene Roddenberry, and directed by Lawrence Dobkin, it first aired on September 15, 1966.

In the episode, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; picks up an unstable 17-year-old boy who spent 14 years alone on a deserted planet and lacks the training and restraint to handle his superhuman mental powers wisely.

== Plot ==
The USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; meets the merchant vessel &quot;Antares&quot; to take charge of Charlie Evans, the sole survivor of a transport ship that crashed on the planet Thasus. For fourteen years, 17-year-old Charlie grew up there alone, stranded in the wreckage, learning how to talk from the ship&#x27;s computer systems, which remained intact. Charlie is to be transported to his nearest relatives on the colony Alpha V. Crew members aboard &quot;Antares&quot; speak praises about Charlie, but seem pleased to see him removed from their ship. He tells Dr. McCoy the crew of &quot;Antares&quot; did not like him very much, and that all he wants is for people to like him.

Despite his eagerness to please, Charlie becomes obnoxious since his lack of upbringing has left him with no knowledge of social norms or control of his emotions. He latches on to Captain Kirk as a father figure and develops an infatuation with Yeoman Janice Rand. He demonstrates extraordinary powers of telepathy and matter transmutation, though the crew initially fail to recognize the cause. Charlie meets Rand in the recreation room, where Mr. Spock plays a Vulcan lyrette and Lt. Uhura suddenly starts singing. Charlie is annoyed with being a subject in Uhura&#x27;s performance, as well as with Rand paying more attention to the song than to him, so he causes Uhura to temporarily lose her voice and Spock&#x27;s instrument to malfunction.

When the &quot;Antares&quot; is nearly out of sensor range, it transmits a message to the &quot;Enterprise&quot;. The message is cut off before it can convey a warning. Scanners show the &quot;Antares&quot; has been reduced to debris.

Kirk tries to teach Charlie martial arts. Sam, Kirk&#x27;s training partner, laughs at one of Charlie&#x27;s falls, and Charlie makes him &quot;vanish&quot;. Shocked, Kirk calls for security guards to escort Charlie to his quarters. Charlie makes all phasers on the ship disappear, but ultimately yields to Kirk&#x27;s order that he return to his quarters. Records show that Charlie&#x27;s abilities are the same as those of Thasians, but the medical examination McCoy conducted when Charlie came on board confirmed that he is human. Charlie admits he used his powers to remove a vital component of the &quot;Antares&quot; warp core, causing the ship to explode. Frustrated at the adversarial turn in his relationship with the crew, Charlie breaks out of his quarters and begins to use his powers on the crew - changing their physical forms or freezing them according to his whim. When Rand resists his romantic advances and slaps him, he makes her &quot;disappear.&quot; When Kirk demands to know if Rand is dead or alive, Charlie refuses to tell him.

Realizing Charlie&#x27;s powers are too great to be controlled, Kirk opts to divert from Alpha V so as to at least keep Charlie away from a civilized world, where he would wreak havoc. Charlie discovers Kirk&#x27;s plans, and takes control of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;. Speculating that controlling the &quot;Enterprise&quot; may sap Charlie&#x27;s power, Kirk orders all of the ship&#x27;s systems to be activated and attacks Charlie. Though his hypothesis proves incorrect, it distracts Charlie from fleeing a Thasian ship that had been pursuing them.

The ship approaches and restores the &quot;Enterprise&quot; and its crew to their proper forms - although they admit they cannot restore the &quot;Antares&quot;. The Thasian commander says that his race gave Charlie his powers so he could survive on their world, but these powers (which they can&#x27;t remove from him) make him too dangerous to live among humans. Charlie begs Kirk not to let the aliens have him, since the Thasians lack any physical form or capacity for love. However, the Thasians reject Kirk&#x27;s argument that Charlie belongs with his own kind, and with a final echoing wail of &quot;I wanna stay!&quot; Charlie is transported away and Yeoman Rand begins crying.

== Production history ==

The premise for this episode formed part of Gene Roddenberry&#x27;s original March 1964 pitch for &quot;Star Trek&quot;, under the name &quot;The Day Charlie Became God&quot;. When the series entered production, Roddenberry assigned it to Dorothy C. Fontana to dramatize.

For a while during production, the episode was known as &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Law&quot;; a name which survived in the James Blish adaptation of the episode for Bantam Books. In a scene in the script which did not air, Charlie&#x27;s Law is stated as &quot;You&#x27;d better be nice to Charlie ... or else.&quot;

Gene Roddenberry made an uncredited audio cameo as the cook (or mess officer) who exclaims that the turkey-shaped meatloaf in the galley ovens has turned into real turkeys. This was his only speaking role in &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot;.

== Reception ==
Zack Handlen of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; gave the episode a &quot;B&quot; rating. Handlen marked the episode down for its poor treatment of Yeoman Janice Rand and use of the &quot;god-child&quot; cliché, but praised more &quot;disturbing&quot; elements of the episode, such as Charlie&#x27;s pranks and his eventual fate.

In 2016, Syfy ranked guest star Robert Walker&#x27;s performance as Charlie as the 6th best guest star on the original series and Uhura&#x27;s singing as the character&#x27;s seventh best moment in &quot;Star Trek&quot;.

In 2024 &quot;Hollywood.com&quot; ranked Charlie X at number 13 out of the 79 original series episodes, calling it &quot;bold, primary-colored fantasia of ‘60s pop art&quot;.

<doc id="1017592" wikidata="Q541526" url="?curid=1017592" title="Robert Wilson (director)">
<text>Robert Wilson (born October 4, 1941) is an American experimental theater stage director and playwright who has been described by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;[America]&#x27;s – or even the world&#x27;s – foremost vanguard &#x27;theater artist. He has also worked as a choreographer, performer, painter, sculptor, video artist, and sound and lighting designer.

Wilson is best known for his collaboration with Philip Glass and Lucinda Childs on &quot;Einstein on the Beach&quot;, and his frequent collaborations with Tom Waits. In 1991, Wilson established The Watermill Center, &quot;a laboratory for performance&quot; on the East End of Long Island, New York, regularly working with opera and theater companies, as well as cultural festivals. Wilson &quot;has developed as an avant-garde artist specifically in Europe amongst its modern quests, in its most significant cultural centers, galleries, museums, opera houses and theaters, and festivals&quot;.

== Early life and education ==
Wilson was born in Waco, Texas, the son of Loree Velma (née Hamilton) and D.M. Wilson, a lawyer.
He had a difficult youth as the gay son of a conservative family. &quot;When I was growing up, it was a sin to go to the theater. It was a sin if a woman wore pants. There was a prayer box in school, and if you saw someone sinning you could put their name in the prayer box, and on Fridays everyone would pray for those people whose names were in the prayer box.&quot; He was stuttering and taken to a local dance instructor called Bird &quot;Baby&quot; Hoffman, who helped him overcome his stutter.
After attending local schools, he studied business administration at the University of Texas from 1959 to 1962.

He moved to Brooklyn, New York in 1963 to change fields, study art and architecture. At some point he went to Arizona to study architecture with Paolo Soleri at his desert complex. Wilson found himself drawn to the work of pioneering choreographers George Balanchine, Merce Cunningham, and Martha Graham, among others. He engaged in therapeutic theater work with brain-injured and disabled children in New York. He received a BFA in architecture from the Pratt Institute in 1965. He directed a &quot;ballet for iron-lung patients where the participants moved a fluorescent streamer with their mouths while the janitor danced dressed as Miss America&quot;. During this period, he also attended lectures by Sibyl Moholy-Nagy (widow of László Moholy-Nagy), and studied painting with artist George McNeil.

== Career ==

=== Theater ===

In 1968, he founded an experimental performance company, the Byrd Hoffman School of Byrds (named for a teacher who helped him manage a stutter while a teenager). With this company, he directed his first major works, beginning with 1969&#x27;s &quot;The King of Spain&quot; and &quot;The Life and Times of Sigmund Freud&quot;. He began to work in opera in the early 1970s, creating &quot;Einstein on the Beach&quot; with composer Philip Glass and choreographer Lucinda Childs. This work brought the artists worldwide renown. Following &quot;Einstein&quot;, Wilson worked increasingly with major European theaters and opera houses. For the New York debut of his first opera, the Metropolitan Opera allowed Wilson to rent the house on a Sunday, when they did not have a production, but would not produce the work.

In 1970, Wilson and a group of collaborators, including choreographer Andy deGroat and the dancer and actor Sheryl Sutton, devised the &quot;silent opera&quot; &quot;Deafman Glance&quot; in Iowa City, where it premiered at the Center for New Performing Arts on December 15. The large cast of the premiere production of &quot;Deafman Glance&quot; included Raymond Andrews and Ana Mendieta. The show subsequently traveled to the Nancy Festival in France and to the Brooklyn Academy of Music. It later opened in Paris, championed by the designer Pierre Cardin. The Surrealist poet Louis Aragon loved it and published a letter to the Surrealist poet André Breton (who had died in 1966), in which he praised Wilson as: &quot;What we, from whom Surrealism was born, dreamed would come after us and go beyond us&quot;. In 1975, Wilson dissolved the Byrds and started to use professional actors.

In 1983/84, Wilson planned a performance for the 1984 Summer Olympics, &quot;the CIVIL warS: A Tree Is Best Measured When It Is Down&quot;; the complete work was to have been 12 hours long, in 6 parts. The production was only partially completed; the full event was canceled by the Olympic Arts Festival, due to insufficient funds. In 1986, the Pulitzer Prize jury unanimously selected &quot;the CIVIL warS&quot; for the drama prize, but the supervisory board rejected the choice and gave no drama award that year.

In 1990 alone, Wilson created four new productions in four different West German cities: Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;King Lear&quot; in Frankfurt, Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;Swan Song&quot; in Munich, an adaptation of Virginia Woolf&#x27;s &quot;Orlando&quot; in West Berlin, and The Black Rider a collaboration by Wilson, Tom Waits and William S. Burroughs, in Hamburg.

In 1997, he was awarded the Europe Theatre Prize.

In 1998, Wilson staged August Strindberg&#x27;s &quot;A Dream Play,&quot; at Stockholms Stadsteater, Sweden. It later headlined festivals in Recklinghausen, Nice, Perth, Bonn, Moscow, New York and London.

In 2010 Wilson was working on a new stage musical with composer (and long-time collaborator) Tom Waits and the Irish playwright, Martin McDonagh. His theatrical production of John Cage&#x27;s &quot;Lecture on Nothing&quot;, which was commissioned for a celebration of the Cage centenary at the 2012 Ruhrtriennale, had its U.S. premiere in Royce Hall, UCLA, by the Center for the Art of Performance. Wilson performed &quot;Lectures on Nothing&quot; in its Australian premiere at the 2019 Supersense festival at the Arts Centre Melbourne.

In 2013 Wilson, in collaboration with Mikhail Baryshnikov and co-starring Willem Dafoe, developed &quot;The Old Woman&quot;, an adaptation of the work by the Russian author Daniil Kharms. The play premiered at MIF13, Manchester International Festival. Wilson wrote that he and Baryshnikov had discussed creating a play together for years, perhaps based on a Russian text. The final production included dance, light, singing and bilingual monolog.

Since 1999, Wilson has premiered nine theatrical works in Berlin. By contrast, as of 2013, his last commission in the United States was 21 years ago.

As of 2010, he continued to direct revivals of his most celebrated productions, including &quot;The Black Rider&quot; in London, San Francisco, Sydney, Australia, and Los Angeles; &quot;The Temptation of St. Anthony&quot; in New York and Barcelona; &quot;Erwartung&quot; in Berlin; &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot; at the Bolshoi Opera in Moscow; and Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot; at Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris.

Wilson also directs all Monteverdi operas for the opera houses of La Scala in Milan and the Palais Garnier in Paris.

In 2021 Wilson directed a revival of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot; at the Ivan Vazov National Theatre in Sofia, Bulgaria.

In 2022 he directed &quot;UBU&quot;, a theatrical performance, premiered at Es Baluard Museu in Palma.

=== Visual art and design ===
In addition to his work for the stage, Wilson has created sculpture, drawings, and furniture designs. Exhibited in December 1976 at the Paula Cooper Gallery, Wilson&#x27;s storyboards were described by one critic as &quot;serial art, equivalent to the slow-motion tempo of [Wilson&#x27;s] theatrical style. In drawing after drawing after drawing, a detail is proposed, analyzed, refined, redefined, moved through various positions.&quot;
He won the Golden Lion at the 1993 Venice Biennale for a sculptural installation. 
In 2004, Ali Hossaini offered Wilson a residency at the television channel LAB HD. Since then Wilson, with producer Esther Gordon and later with Matthew Shattuck, has produced dozens of high-definition videos known as the Voom Portraits. Collaborators on this well-received project included the composer Michael Galasso, the late artist and designer Eugene Tsai, fashion designer Kevin Santos, and lighting designer Urs Schönebaum. In addition to celebrity subjects, sitters have included royalty, animals, Nobel Prize winners and hobos.

In 2011, Wilson designed an art park dedicated to the Finnish designer Tapio Wirkkala (1915–1985), situated in the Arabianranta district of Helsinki. His plans for the rectangular park feature a central square divided into nine equally sized fields separated by bushes. Each field will be installed with objects related to the home. For example, one unit will consist of a small fireplace surrounded by stones that serve as seating. The park will be lit by large, lightbox-style lamps build into the ground and by smaller ones modeled on ordinary floor lamps.

In 2013 American pop singer Lady Gaga announced that she would collaborate with Wilson as part of her ARTPOP project. He subsequently designed the set for her 2013 MTV Video Music Awards performance. Wilson also suggested that Gaga pose for his Voom Portraits. Knowing he had an upcoming residency as guest curator at the Louvre, Wilson chose themes from the museum&#x27;s collection, all dealing with death. They shot the videos in a London studio over three days, Gaga standing for 14 or 15 hours at a time. Called &quot;Living Rooms,&quot; the resulting exhibition included two video works: one inspired by Jacques-Louis David&#x27;s &quot;The Death of Marat&quot;, hung in the painting galleries, and another in which Lady Gaga brings to life a painting by Ingres. In the Louvre&#x27;s auditorium, Wilson hosted and took part in a series of performances, conversations, film screenings, and discussions. The centerpiece of the residency is a room filled with objects from the artist&#x27;s personal collection in New York, including African masks, a Shaker chair, ancient Chinese ceramics, shoes worn by Marlene Dietrich and a photo of Wilson and Glass taken in the early 1980s by Robert Mapplethorpe.

== Personal life ==

Wilson lives in New York. As of 2000, he estimated that he &quot;spends 10 days a year at his apartment in New York&quot;. For many years he was romantically involved with Andy de Groat, a dancer and choreographer with whom he collaborated in the 1970s.

== Style ==
Wilson is known for pushing the boundaries of theater. His works are noted for their austere style, very slow movement, and often extreme scale in space or in time. &quot;The Life and Times of Joseph Stalin&quot; was a 12-hour performance, while &quot;KA MOUNTain and GUARDenia Terrace&quot; was staged on a mountaintop in Iran and lasted seven days.

=== Language ===
Language is one of the most important elements of theater and Robert Wilson feels at home with commanding it in many different ways. Wilson&#x27;s impact on this part of theater alone is immense. Arthur Holmberg, professor of theater at Brandeis University, says that &quot;In theatre, no one has dramatized the crisis of language with as much ferocious genius as Robert Wilson.&quot; Wilson makes it evident in his work that whats and whys of language are terribly important and cannot be overlooked. Tom Waits, acclaimed songwriter and collaborator with Wilson, said this about Wilson&#x27;s unique relationship with words:

Words for Bob are like tacks on the kitchen floor in the dark of night and you&#x27;re barefoot. So Bob clears a path he can walk through words without getting hurt. Bob changes the values and shapes of words. In some sense they take on more meaning; in some cases, less.

Wilson shows the importance of language through all of his works and in many varying fashions. He credits his reading of the work of Gertrude Stein and listening to recordings of her speaking with &quot;changing [his] way of thinking forever.&quot; Wilson directed three of Stein&#x27;s works in the 1990s: &quot;Doctor Faustus Lights the Lights&quot; (1992), &quot;Four Saints in Three Acts&quot; (1996), and &quot;Saints and Singing&quot; (1998).

Wilson considers language and, down to its very ingredients, words, as a sort of &quot;a social artifact&quot;. Not only does language change with time but it changes with person, with culture. Using his experience of working with mentally handicapped children and enlisting the collaboration of Christopher Knowles, a renowned autistic poet, has allowed Wilson to attack language from many views. Wilson embraces this by often &quot;juxtaposing levels of diction – Miltonic opulence and contemporary ling, crib poetry and pre-verbal screams&quot; in an attempt to show his audience how elusive language really is and how ever-changing it can be. Visually showing words is another method Wilson uses to show the beauty of language. Often his set designs, program covers, and posters are graffiti&#x27;d with words. This allows the audience to look at the &quot;language itself&quot; rather than &quot;the objects and meanings it refers to.&quot;.

The lack of language is essential to Wilson&#x27;s work as well. In the same way an artist uses positive and negative space, Wilson uses noise and silence. In working on a production of &quot;King Lear&quot;, Wilson inadvertently describes his necessity of silence:

The way actors are trained here is wrong. All they think about is interpreting a text. They worry about how to speak words and know nothing about their bodies. You see that by the way they walk. They don&#x27;t understand the weight of a gesture in space. A good actor can command an audience by moving one finger.

This emphasis on silence is fully explored in some of his works. &quot;Deafman Glance&quot; is a play without words, and his adaptation of Heiner Müller&#x27;s play &quot;&quot; contained a fifteen-minute wordless prolog. Holmberg describes these works stating,

Language does many things and does them well. But we tend to shut our eyes to what language does not do well. Despite the arrogance of words – they rule traditional theatre with an iron fist – not all experience can be translated into a linguistic code.

Celebrated twentieth century playwright Eugène Ionesco said that Wilson &quot;surpassed Beckett&quot; because &quot;[Wilson&#x27;s] silence is a silence that speaks&quot;. This silence onstage may be unnerving to audience members but serves a purpose of showing how important language is by its absence. It is Wilson&#x27;s means of answering his own question: &quot;Why is it no one looks? Why is it no one knows how to look? Why does no one see anything on stage?&quot;

Another technique Wilson uses is that of what words can mean to a particular character. His piece, &quot;I was sitting on my patio this guy appeared I thought I was hallucinating&quot;, features only two characters, both of whom deliver the same stream-of-consciousness monolog. In the play&#x27;s first production one character was &quot;aloof, cold, [and] precise&quot; while the other &quot;brought screwball comedy … warmth and color … playful[ness]&quot;. The different emphases and deliveries brought to the monolog two different meanings; &quot;audiences found it hard to believe they heard the same monologue twice.&quot; Rather than tell his audience what words are supposed to mean, he opens them up for interpretation, presenting the idea that &quot;meanings are not tethered to words like horses to hitching posts.&quot;

=== Movement ===
Movement is a key element in Wilson&#x27;s work. As a dancer, he sees the importance of the way an actor moves onstage and knows the weight that movement bears. When speaking of his &quot;play without words&quot; rendition of Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;When We Dead Awaken&quot;, Wilson says:

I do movement before we work on the text. Later we&#x27;ll put text and movement together. I do movement first to make sure it&#x27;s strong enough to stand on its own two feet without words. The movement must have a rhythm and structure of its own. It must not follow the text. It can reinforce a text without illustrating it. What you hear and what you see are two different layers. When you put them together, you create another texture.

With such an emphasis on movement, Wilson even tailors his auditions around the necessity of it. In his auditions, &quot;Wilson often does an elaborate movement sequence&quot; and &quot;asks the actor to repeat it.&quot; Thomas Derrah, an actor in &quot;the CIVIL warS&quot;, found the audition process to be baffling: &quot;When I went in, [Wilson] asked me to walk across the room on a count of 31, sit down on a count of 7, put my hand to my forehead on a count of 59. I was mystified by the whole process&quot;. To further cement the importance of movement in Wilson&#x27;s works, Seth Goldstein, another actor in &quot;the CIVIL warS&quot;, stated &quot;every movement from the moment I walked onto the platform until I left was choreographed to the second. During the scene at table all I did was count movements. All I thought about was timing.&quot;

When it comes time to add the text in with movement, there is still much work to be done. Wilson pays close attention to the text and still makes sure there is enough &quot;space around a text&quot; for the audience to soak it up. At this point, the actors know their movements and the time in which they are executed, allowing Wilson to tack the actions onto specific pieces of text. His overall goal is to have the rhythm of the text differ from that of the movement so his audience can see them as two completely different pieces, seeing each as what it is. When in the text/movement stage, Wilson often interrupts the rehearsal, saying things like &quot;Something is wrong. We have to check your scripts to see if you put the numbers in the right place.&quot; He goes on to explain the importance of this:

I know it&#x27;s hell to separate text and movement and maintain two different rhythms. It takes time to train yourself to keep tongue and body working against each other. But things happen with the body that have nothing to do with what we say. It&#x27;s more interesting if the mind and the body are in two different places, occupying different zones of reality.

These rhythms keep the mind on its toes, consciously and subconsciously taking in the meanings behind the movement and how it is matching up with the language.

Similar to Wilson&#x27;s use of the lack of language in his works, he also sees the importance that a lack of movement can have. In his production of &quot;Medea&quot;, Wilson arranged a scene in which the lead singer stood still during her entire aria while many others moved around her. Wilson recalls that &quot;she complained that if I didn&#x27;t give her any movements, no one would notice her. I told her if she knew how to stand, everyone would watch her. I told her to stand like a marble statue of a goddess who had been standing in the same spot for a thousand years&quot;. Allowing an actor to have such stage presence without ever saying a word is very provocative, which is precisely what Wilson means to accomplish with any sense of movement he puts on the stage.

=== Lighting ===
Wilson believes that &quot;the most important part of theatre&quot; is light. He is concerned with how images are defined onstage, and this is related to the light of an object or tableau. He feels that the lighting design can really bring the production to life. The set designer for Wilson&#x27;s &quot;the CIVIL warS&quot;, Tom Kamm, describes his philosophy: &quot;a set for Wilson is a canvas for the light to hit like paint.&quot; He explains, &quot;If you know how to light, you can make shit look like gold. I paint, I build, I compose with light. Light is a magic wand.&quot;

Wilson is &quot;the only major director to get billing as a lighting designer&quot; and is recognized by some as &quot;the greatest light artist of our time&quot;. He designs with light to be flowing rather than an off-and-on pattern, thus making his lighting &quot;like a musical score.&quot; Wilson&#x27;s lighting designs feature &quot;dense, palpable textures&quot; and allow &quot;people and objects to leap out from the background. In his design for &quot;Quartett&quot;, Wilson used four hundred light cues in a span of only ninety minutes.

He is a perfectionist, persisting to achieve every aspect of his vision. A fifteen-minute monolog in &quot;Quartett&quot; took two days for him to light while a single hand gesture took nearly three hours. This attention to detail expresses his conviction that, &quot;light is the most important actor on stage.&quot; In a conversation with theater expert Octavian Saiu, Wilson was asked whether he is disturbed by the fact that his style is often imitated. His response was that &quot;the world is a library&quot;, and therefore every artist is free to borrow from other artists.

=== Props ===
Wilson&#x27;s interest in design extends to the props in his productions, which he designs and sometimes participates in constructing. Whether it is furniture, a light bulb, or a giant crocodile, Wilson treats each as a work of art in its own right. He demands that a full-scale model of each prop be constructed before the final one is made, in order &quot;to check proportion, balance, and visual relationships&quot; on stage. Once he has approved the model, the crew builds the prop, and Wilson is &quot;renowned for sending them back again and again and again until they satisfy him&quot;. He is so strict in his attention to detail that when Jeff Muscovin, his technical director for &quot;Quartett&quot;, suggested they use an aluminum chair with a wood skin rather than a completely wooden chair, Wilson replied:

No, Jeff, I want wood chairs. If we make them out of aluminum, they won&#x27;t sound right when they fall over and hit the floor. They&#x27;ll sound like metal, not wood. It will sound false. Just make sure you get strong wood. And no knots.

Such attention to detail and perfectionism usually resulted in an expensive collection of props. &quot;Curators regard them as sculptures&quot; and the props have been sold for prices ranging from &quot;$4,500 to $80,000.&quot;

== Exhibitions ==
Extensive retrospectives have been presented at the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris (1991) and the Boston Museum of Fine Arts (1991). He has presented installations at the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam, Museum Boymans-van Beuningen, Rotterdam (1993), London&#x27;s Clink Street Vaults (1995), Neue Nationalgalerie (2003), and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York and the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao. His tribute to Isamu Noguchi was exhibited at the Seattle Art Museum and his &quot;Voom Portraits&quot; exhibition traveled to Hamburg, Milan, Miami, and Philadelphia. In 2012, Times Square Arts invited Wilson to show selections from his three-minute video portraits on more than twenty digital screens that lined Times Square. In 2013 he participated at the White House Biennial / Thessaloniki Biennale 4. He collaborated with artist Bettina WitteVeen on an exhibition space based on her photography book &quot;Sacred Sister.&quot; The book consisted of photos of women that WitteVeen captured in Indonesia and Southeast Asia in 1995. The exhibition space was set up in 2003 at Art Basel Miami Beach, and was also composed of layers of autumn leaves on the floor of a studio.

Wilson is represented exclusively and worldwide by RW Work, Ltd. (New York), and his gallerist in New York City is Paula Cooper Gallery.

== The Watermill Center ==
In 1991 Wilson established The Watermill Center on the site of a former Western Union laboratory on the East End of Long Island, New York. Originally styled as &quot;a laboratory for performance&quot;, The Watermill Center operates year-round artist residencies, public education programs, exhibitions, and performances. The center is situated within a campus of gardens and designed landscape, and contains numerous works of art collected by Wilson.

== Europe Theatre Prize ==
In 1997 he was awarded the V Europe Theatre Prize, in Taormina, with the following motivation:The Jury of the fifth Europe Theatre Prize has unanimously awarded the Prize to Robert Wilson in recognition of his thirty years&#x27; work aimed at creating a personal reinvention of scenic art that has overturned the temporal dimension and retraced the spatial one. He refused to render a mere production of reality and offered an abstract or informal vision of the text and also redefined the roles, whenever possible, through global intervention in the creation of his performances where he was author, director, performer, scenographer and magic light designer. Architect by profession, the artist pursued an indisciplinary language that did not ignore the visual arts in enhancing the importance of the image and, restoring the support of music, he approached dance and simultaneously attempted to find a pure harmonious value in the spoken word, in an ideal tension towards a form of total theater.

It has been said that his works can be considered part of a single opus in continual evolution that constitutes the synthesis. During his career Wilson has confronted himself with different genres and drawn them closer thanks to the conformity of language. He has executed classical works and specially written works and for this reasons he has stimulated the interest of eminent writers, such as William Burroughs and Heiner Müller establishing a particular bond with him.

He has dedicated himself to teaching non theatrical literary works often adapted into monologs interpreted by eminent actors, such as Madeleine Renaud and Marianne Hoppe. He has ventured into the production of opera and ballet, he has created musicals sui generis in collaboration with illustrious emerging personalities, he has promoted performances especially with Christopher Knowles, he has directed spectacular fashion parades. His prolific activity as designer and visual artist can be seen in his paintings, sculptures, installations, graphic works, exhibitions. He was awarded the major prize at the Venice Biennale.

Nothing new can be achieved without changing the conceptions of organization. He was a decisive promoter of coproduction of festivals since the &#x27;70s, of the creation of prototype-performances that could be translated in various nations with new casts, and also of the creation of serial works to be completed later in production studios. Thanks are due to him for the embrace between different nations, languages, styles and traditions.

Even when using bigger and bigger and more and more international teams of collaborators Wilson has never renounced making his own imprint of perfectionist in a developing opera. He has to be accredited with the Watermill Centre, center of experimentation and training where his work as a teacher has helped him in retain an inexhaustible flow of fresh ideas from the contact with the young people.

<text>Joseph Émile Alcide &quot;Butch&quot; Bouchard (4 September 1919 – 14 April 2012) was a Canadian ice hockey player who played defence with the Montreal Canadiens in the National Hockey League from 1941 to 1956. He is a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame, won four Stanley Cups, was captain of the Canadiens for eight years, and was voted to the NHL All-Star team four times. Although having a reputation as a clean player, he was also one of the strongest players and best body-checkers of his era. He excelled as a defensive defenceman, had superior passing skills, and was known for his leadership and mentoring of younger players. In his early years in the NHL, Bouchard, among other players, made a major contribution to reinvigorating what was at the time an ailing Canadien franchise.

He was born in Montreal, Quebec, and at the time of his death resided in Saint-Lambert, Quebec. In retirement, Bouchard was active with several business interests and contributions to his community. In 2008, he received the National Order of Quebec. On 4 December 2009, Bouchard&#x27;s No. 3 was retired by the Canadiens as part of their 100th anniversary celebrations. On 30 December 2009, Michaëlle Jean, Governor General of Canada, announced Bouchard as among the appointments to the Order of Canada.

==Youth and learning the game==
Bouchard was born in Montreal the son of Régina Lachapelle and Calixte Bouchard. Growing up poor during the depression, Bouchard did not begin skating until he was 16 and had to learn on rented skates, before borrowing $35 from his brother for a complete set of hockey equipment which included his pair of skates. Bouchard opted for a career in hockey over banking when he was offered $75 a week to play senior hockey and the bank paid $7. In the minors Bouchard played with the Verdun Maple Leafs, Montreal Junior Canadiens and Providence Reds. It was Verdun teammate Bob Fillion who gave Bouchard the nickname &quot;Butch&quot;. It originated due to the resemblance of his last name to the English word &quot;butcher&quot;. Bouchard was determined, strong and developed enough skills to impress coach Dick Irvin in the Canadiens&#x27; 1940–41 training camp after which he was signed as a free agent. Bouchard had arrived at training camp in peak condition, which was unusual for National Hockey League (NHL) players of the time. To attend this first training camp he rode a bike , which also allowed him to pocket the travel expenses the Canadiens had allotted.

In an era when hockey players were regarded by hockey management as rural and unsophisticated, Bouchard had already developed his entrepreneurial skills. While still in high school he was working alongside an inspector with the Department of Agriculture when he came across a bee ranch owned by a priest who had just died. Borrowing $500 from his brother he bought the business. He turned it into an apiary of 200 hives which was so successful he earned enough to buy his parents a home. It was due to this business acuity that before signing with the Canadiens he uncovered what Ken Reardon and Elmer Lach, already playing with the Montreal, were currently earning. Then, for ten days he negotiated a larger contract than either player had been receiving, $3,750 ($ in dollars).

==NHL career==
===Arrival to the Canadiens===
Along with a strong work ethic and keen intellect, Bouchard was physically imposing. At and he was considered a giant compared to NHL players of the 1940s, when the average height was and average weight was . Moreover, since he also practiced heavy weight training in an era before NHL players were concerned about upper body strength he became a very effective defensive presence. Hockey Hall of Fame leftwinger and teammate Dickie Moore said of Bouchard: &quot;He appeared to have been chiseled out of stone.&quot;

By the time of Bouchard&#x27;s arrival to the Montreal Canadiens, the club had not won the championship for 10 years and attendance at the Forum was very low, often less than 3,000 a game, and there was talk of folding the franchise. A few years earlier, in 1935, Canadien owners had seriously considered an offer to sell the team to be moved to Cleveland. After finishing last or near the bottom of the league for several years, the apathy of the fans was matched by the players themselves who had accepted losing as a way of hockey life. In his first training camp, he showcased his physical play by body-checking players, including veterans, with abandon. When the season started other teams discovered that with Bouchard in the lineup, they could no longer push Canadien players around. Bouchard&#x27;s presence reinvigorated the Canadiens and he is credited with playing an important part in keeping the franchise from leaving Montreal.

However, Bouchard was more than just a physical presence. He learned to play good positional hockey and became skilled at passing the puck. He also possessed a flair for judging the flow of the game and knew when to join the attack and when to retreat. Despite his role as a stay-at-home defenceman, due to his skills for the long breakout pass, he was a contributor to the style of firewagon hockey for which the Canadiens exemplified.
Though he had an immediate impact on the team, Bouchard did not score many points for the team; in his first season, 1941–42, he collected six points in the regular season and scored the first NHL goal of his career in the Canadiens&#x27; first-round playoff loss to the Detroit Red Wings.
===NHL star===
The 1942–43 season was Bouchard&#x27;s breakthrough year as he finished leading all Canadien defencemen in points and was key to the Canadiens&#x27; first season in several years without a losing record. They finished in fourth place with a record of 19 wins, 19 losses and 12 ties. Although they lost in the first round of the playoffs, the team was building in the right direction.

The 1943–44 season was Maurice Richard&#x27;s first full season with the Canadiens. Richard was not just an exciting player to watch which served to increase attendance, but also had the offensive skills needed to turn the Canadiens into an exceptional team. The Canadiens proceeded to dominate the regular season finishing well ahead of second-place Detroit. In the playoffs in the first round against Toronto, after losing the opening game, they won the next four straight to win the series. Then, in the final, they swept Detroit in four games to win their first Stanley Cup in thirteen years. While the &quot;Punch Line&quot; of Richard, Toe Blake and Lach provided the offensive power it was Bouchard and goal-tender Bill Durnan who kept the goals out. During the regular season Montreal had allowed only 109 goals, 68 less than second-place Detroit. Bouchard along with Richard and Lach was named to the NHL All Stars&#x27; second team and goaltender Bill Durnan made the first team and won the Vezina. Bouchard had become one of the most reliable defencemen in the league. He would be named to the NHL First All-Star team, as one of the best defencemen in the league, for the next three seasons. He won his second Stanley Cup in 1945–46.

As physical on the ice as Bouchard was, he was also regarded as a clean player and only rarely participated in hockey fights. Immensely strong, most players avoided engaging him in fights and Bouchard more often would be the person to break up combatants. However, it was a fight involving Bouchard which led to a significant change in the role of referees. During the 1946–47 season, Bouchard became involved in a prolonged and one-sided fight with Boston&#x27;s Terry Reardon. Due to the fight, Clarence Campbell, president of the NHL, added to the duties of referees; for the first time, they had the responsibility of breaking up fights. Then there was the time in March 1947, in a game in Boston, as the Canadiens were coming back onto the ice for the beginning of the third period, a female fan attacked Bouchard spearing him with a hat pin. Bouchard responded by pushing the woman away forcefully. A few moments later, Boston police were leading Bouchard out to a police car. According to Bouchard, Pat Egan of the Boston Bruins, interceded and talked the police out of the arrest.

For the 1947–48 season, defenceman Doug Harvey joined the team. Within a couple of years, Harvey would become the best offensive-oriented defenceman in the NHL and he and Bouchard would form a long-time and very effective defensive pairing. Whenever Harvey undertook one of the offensive rushes for which he became famous, he was confident in the knowledge that Bouchard was backing him up if he was to lose the puck.

===Leader and mentor===
In 1948, Bouchard became the first Quebec-born captain of the Canadiens, a position he retained for eight years until his retirement. At the time of his retirement no player had served more years as captain of the Canadiens than Bouchard. Hall of Famer Jean Béliveau, a teammate of Bouchard for Beliveau&#x27;s early years with the Canadiens, said Bouchard was the model for his time as captain in the 1960s. Bouchard was a well-respected leader and played a role in supporting and mentoring the younger players. Never afraid to speak up to management, in 1950 on Bouchard&#x27;s recommendation to Selke to &quot;give the kid a shot&quot;, Bernie Geoffrion was given a tryout and eventually joined the Canadiens. Geoffrion won the Calder for rookie of the year and would be near the top of the league scoring for years to come. Bouchard commenting on the fact that he was nominated for captain by his teammates: &quot;I don&#x27;t agree with management nominating you. I can respond to players, not be a yes-man for the proprietor.&quot; He missed a large part of the 1948–49 season after a severe knee injury which threatened his career. Despite the medical opinion that he might not be able to continue to play he trained hard and was able to strengthen the knee enough to return to the Canadiens.

In 1951, Bouchard was involved in a legal first when he was a defendant in a lawsuit brought by a New York Rangers fan. The fan claimed Bouchard had struck him with his stick when he was waving to a friend watching the game on TV. Bouchard said the fan had raised his fist towards a fellow Canadiens player who was being taken off the ice with an injury and his stick hit the fan accidentally as he tried to ward off the blow. In what may have been the first time in legal history, evidence was taken during a trial from someone witnessing an event on television as the fan&#x27;s friend testified he had seen Bouchard strike the blow. Bouchard won the case when Otis Guernsey, president of Abercrombie and Fitch, who was at the game, testified he heard &quot;vile language&quot; and saw the fan raise his fist and not wave.

On 28 February 1953, the Canadiens had a &quot;Bouchard Night at the Forum&quot;. Bouchard was honoured in a ceremony during the second intermission in a game against the Detroit Red Wings. It was presided over by Montreal Mayor Camillien Houde and broadcast nationally live over the CBC. Among the gifts Bouchard received was a Buick automobile which was driven out onto the ice. The organizer planned to have Bouchard drive off in the car at the end of the ceremony. However, sitting in the car Bouchard discovered the keys were missing. To the roar of the crowd Ted Lindsay, captain of the Red Wings, returned the keys he had stolen and congratulated Bouchard on behalf of the Red Wings.

In 1952–53, Montreal and Detroit battled for first place with Detroit coming out on top by the end of the season. In the first round of the playoffs, the heavily favoured Detroit Red Wings were upset by the Boston Bruins and Montreal won a close seven-game series over the Chicago Black Hawks. The Canadiens then defeated Boston in five games and Bouchard won his third Stanley Cup.

Eventually, injuries began to take their toll and after the 1954–55 season he considered retirement. Toe Blake, who had taken over as coach, talked him into playing one more season to assist the younger players. Bouchard recognized Blake&#x27;s value as a &quot;player&#x27;s coach&quot; and used his leadership as captain to ease the transition and encourage Blake&#x27;s acceptance by the Canadiens players. Due to physical problems Bouchard was forced to miss the last half of the season and the playoffs. However, in the deciding game of the Stanley Cup Finals against Detroit, Blake dressed Bouchard. As the final seconds counted down, with Montreal up 3–1, Blake put Bouchard on the ice and he was able to end his career with one more Stanley Cup celebration.

==Personal life==
In 1947, Bouchard married Marie-Claire Macbeth, a painter. They had five children, Émile Jr., Jean, Michel, Pierre and Susan.

In the 1970s, his son Pierre Bouchard, also a defenceman, played for the Montreal Canadiens. While father Émile participated in the birth of the Montreal Canadiens&#x27; dynasty, thirty years later son Pierre played a part in continuing the Canadien dynasty into the 1970s. With Butch&#x27;s four and Pierre&#x27;s five they have the distinction of winning the most Stanley Cups of any father-son combination in NHL history. Bobby and Brett Hull are the only other father and son to have won the Cup.

In retirement, Bouchard remained as active as he was during his NHL career. He received coaching offers soon after his retirement, but his business interests prevented him from leaving Montreal. Bouchard owned a popular restaurant Chez Émile Bouchard which operated for many years in Montreal. On 22 March 1953, while Bouchard was travelling to Detroit for the last game of the season, the restaurant was gutted by a fire started in a basement at 3:22am soon after employees and patrons had left. He was also president of the Montreal Royals Triple-A baseball club, elected to the Longueuil municipal council, on the board of directors of Ste. Jeanne-d&#x27;Arc Hospital, president of the Metropolitan Junior &quot;A&quot; Hockey League among other activities.

Bouchard was unafraid to speak his mind when he felt the occasion demanded. In 1957, after an International League game in Toronto between his Montreal Royals and the Maple Leafs baseball team President Bouchard complained about Toronto&#x27;s excessive conference trips to the mound. He called the Leafs &quot;showspoilers&quot; and then said, for the entire press room to hear, &quot;They&#x27;re a lot of punks, just like in hockey!&quot;

Bouchard was a tough opponent even outside of hockey. When the Mafia of the day in Montreal attempted to intimidate him into hiring their people for his restaurant, Bouchard invited the head man to Chez Butch Bouchard for dinner. Bouchard&#x27;s wife, Marie-Claire, recalled he told them, &quot;Il lui a dit over my dead body. Je n&#x27;embaucherai jamais un de tes hommes.&quot; which translates &quot;Over my dead body, I will never hire one of your men.&quot;

A reporter once asked the canny Bouchard what he thought of coaching methods in the NHL. He replied, &quot;Hockey should be more like football, with a coach for the defence, one for the offence, and maybe one for the goalies.&quot; Indicative of his usual foresight it would be many years before such practices would become common in the NHL.

He died in 2012 at the age of 92.

==Honours and recognition==
Bouchard was one of nine players and one builder elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1966. On 15 October 2008, the Montreal Canadiens celebrated their 100th season by unveiling the Ring of Honour, an exhibit along the wall of the upper deck of the Bell Centre, paying tribute to their 44 players and 10 builders who are members of the Hockey Hall of Fame. Bouchard along with Elmer Lach, the two oldest surviving members, were on hand to drop the ceremonial puck at centre ice.

In 2008, a grassroots movement had begun to pressure Canadien management to retire Bouchard&#x27;s #3. During the Quebec provincial election Independent candidate Kevin Côté made one of his platforms to force Canadiens into retiring the number. By March 2009 it reached the Quebec National Assembly where a motion was presented and carried &quot;That the National Assembly support the steps taken and supported by the population of Québec in order that Montreal Canadiens management retire the sweater of Émile &quot;Butch&quot; Bouchard eminent defenceman from 1941 to 1956.&quot;

On 4 December 2009, as part of an 85-minute pre-game ceremony celebrating the Canadiens&#x27; 100th anniversary, Bouchard&#x27;s No. 3 and Elmer Lach&#x27;s No. 16 were retired. They become the 16th and 17th Canadien players to have their numbers retired.

On 18 June 2008, Bouchard received the National Order of Quebec (L&#x27;Ordre national du Québec) presented to him by the Premier of Quebec Jean Charest. On 30 December 2009, he was made a Member of the Order of Canada &quot;for his contributions to sports, particularly professional hockey, and for his commitment to his community&quot;.

<text>Maroons are descendants of Africans in the Americas and Islands of the Indian Ocean who escaped from slavery, through flight or manumission, and formed their own settlements. They often mixed with Indigenous peoples, eventually evolving into separate creole cultures such as the Garifuna and the Mascogos.

== Etymology ==

&quot;Maroon&quot;, which can have a more general sense of being abandoned without resources, entered English around the 1590s, from the French adjective , meaning &#x27;feral&#x27; or &#x27;fugitive&#x27;. Despite the same spelling, the meaning of &#x27;reddish brown&#x27; for &quot;maroon&quot; did not appear until the late 1700s, perhaps influenced by the idea of maroon peoples.

The American Spanish word is also often given as the source of the English word &quot;maroon&quot;, used to describe the runaway slave communities in Florida, in the Great Dismal Swamp on the border of Virginia and North Carolina, on colonial islands of the Caribbean, and in other parts of the New World. Linguist Lyle Campbell says the Spanish word &#x27; means &#x27;wild, unruly&#x27; or &#x27;runaway slave&#x27;. In the early 1570s, Sir Francis Drake&#x27;s raids on the Spanish in Panama were aided by &quot;&quot;Symerons&quot;,&quot; a likely misspelling of &#x27;. The linguist Leo Spitzer, writing in the journal &quot;Language&quot;, says, &quot;If there is a connection between Eng. &quot;maroon&quot;, Fr. &#x27;, and Sp. &#x27;, Spain (or Spanish America) probably gave the word directly to England (or English America).&quot;

Alternatively, the Cuban philologist José Juan Arrom has traced the origins of the word &quot;maroon&quot; further than the Spanish &quot;cimarrón&quot;, used first in Hispaniola to refer to feral cattle, then to Indian slaves who escaped to the hills, and by the early 1530s to African slaves who did the same. He proposes that the American Spanish word derives ultimately from the Arawakan root word , construed as &#x27;fugitive&#x27;, in the Arawakan language spoken by the Taíno people native to the island.
== History ==

=== Colonial era ===

In the New World, as early as 1512, African slaves escaped from Spanish captors and either joined indigenous peoples or eked out a living on their own. The first slave rebellion occurred in present day Dominican Republic on the sugar plantations owned by Admiral Diego Columbus, on 26 December 1522, and was brutally crushed by the Admiral. The first maroon communities of the Americas were established following this revolt, as many of the slaves were able to escape. This was also to give rise to a wave of Dominican maroons who went on to lead the first maroon activities of the Americas. Sebastián Lemba, born in Africa, successfully rebelled against the Spaniards in 1532, and banded together with other Africans in his 15-year struggle against the Spanish colonists. Lemba was eventually joined by other maroons such as Juan Vaquero, Diego del Guzmán, Fernando Montoro, Juan Criollo and Diego del Ocampo in the struggle against slavery. As the maroons threatened Spanish commerce and trade, Spanish officials began to fear a maroon takeover of the island. By the 1540s, maroons had already controlled the interior portions of the island, although areas in the east, north, and western parts of the island were also to fall under maroon control. Maroon bands would venture out throughout the island, usually in large groups, attack villages they encountered, burn down plantations, kill and ransack the Spaniards, and liberate the slaves. Roadways had become so open to attack, the Spaniards felt it was necessary to only navigate in groups. Dominican maroons would be present throughout the island until the mid 17th century.

Sir Francis Drake enlisted several &quot;cimarrones&quot; during his raids on the Spanish. As early as 1655, escaped Africans had formed communities in inland Jamaica, and by the 18th century, Nanny Town and other Jamaican maroon villages began to fight for independent recognition.

When runaway slaves and Amerindians banded together and subsisted independently they were called &quot;maroons&quot;. On the Caribbean islands, they formed bands and on some islands, armed camps. Maroon communities faced great odds against their surviving the attacks by hostile colonists, obtaining food for subsistence living, as well as reproducing and increasing their numbers. As the planters took over more land for crops, the maroons began to lose ground on the small islands. Only on some of the larger islands were organised maroon communities able to thrive by growing crops and hunting. Here they grew in number as more slaves escaped from plantations and joined their bands. Seeking to separate themselves from colonisers, the maroons gained in power amid increasing hostilities. They raided and pillaged plantations and harassed planters until the planters began to fear a massive revolt of the black slaves.

The early maroon communities were usually displaced. By 1700, maroons had disappeared from the smaller islands. Survival was always difficult, as the maroons had to fight off attackers as well as grow food. One of the most influential maroons was François Mackandal, a houngan or voodoo priest, who led a six-year rebellion against the white plantation owners in Haiti that preceded the Haitian Revolution.

In Cuba, there were maroon communities in the mountains, where African refugees had escaped the brutality of slavery and joined Taínos. Before roads were built into the mountains of Puerto Rico, heavy brush kept many escaped maroons hidden in the southwestern hills where many also intermarried with the natives. Escaped slaves sought refuge away from the coastal plantations of Ponce. 

Maroon communities emerged in many places in the Caribbean (St Vincent and Dominica, for example), but none were seen as such a great threat to the British as the Jamaican Maroons. Beginning in the late 17th century, Jamaican Maroons consistently fought British colonists, leading to the First Maroon War (1728–1740). In 1739 and 1740, the British governor of the Colony of Jamaica, Edward Trelawny, signed treaties promising them in two locations, at Cudjoe&#x27;s Town (Trelawny Town) in western Jamaica and Crawford&#x27;s Town in eastern Jamaica, to bring an end to the warfare between the communities. In exchange, they were to agree to capture other escaped slaves. They were initially paid a bounty of two dollars for each African returned. The treaties effectively freed the Maroons a century before the Slavery Abolition Act 1833, which came into effect in 1838. 

In the plantation colony of Suriname, which England ceded to the Netherlands in the Treaty of Breda (1667), escaped slaves revolted and started to build their villages from the end of the 17th century. As most of the plantations existed in the eastern part of the country, near the Commewijne River and Marowijne River, the &quot;Marronage&quot; () took place along the river borders and sometimes across the borders of French Guiana. By 1740, the maroons had formed clans and felt strong enough to challenge the Dutch colonists, forcing them to sign peace treaties. On October 10, 1760, the Ndyuka signed such a treaty, drafted by Adyáko Benti Basiton of Boston, a formerly enslaved African from Jamaica who had learned to read and write and knew about the Jamaican treaty.

=== Modern era ===
Remnants of Maroon communities in the former Spanish Caribbean remain as of 2006, for example in Viñales, Cuba, and Adjuntas, Puerto Rico.

To this day, the Jamaican Maroons are to a significant extent autonomous and separate from Jamaican society. The physical isolation used to their advantage by their ancestors has today led to their communities remaining among the most inaccessible on the island. In their largest town, Accompong, in the parish of St Elizabeth, the Leeward Maroons still possess a vibrant community of about 600. Tours of the village are offered to foreigners and a large festival is put on every January 6 to commemorate the signing of the peace treaty with the British after the First Maroon War.

The Ndyuka treaty remains important to relations between the Ndyuka and the modern Surinamese government, as it defines the territorial rights of the Maroons in the gold-rich inlands of Suriname.

== Culture ==

Slaves escaped frequently within the first generation of their arrival from Africa and often preserved their African languages and much of their culture and religion. African traditions included such things as the use of certain medicinal herbs together with special drums and dances when the herbs are administered to a sick person. Other African healing traditions and rites have survived through the centuries.

The jungles around the Caribbean Sea offered food, shelter, and isolation for the escaped slaves. Maroons sustained themselves by growing vegetables and hunting. Their survival depended upon their cultures, and their military abilities, using guerrilla tactics and heavily fortified dwellings involving traps and diversions. Some defined leaving the community as desertion and therefore punishable by death. They also originally raided plantations. During these attacks, the maroons would burn crops, steal livestock and tools, kill slavemasters, and invite other slaves to join their communities. Individual groups of maroons often allied themselves with the local indigenous tribes and occasionally assimilated into these populations. Maroons played an important role in the histories of Brazil, Suriname, Puerto Rico, Haiti, Dominican Republic, Cuba, and Jamaica.

There is much variety among maroon cultural groups because of differences in history, geography, African nationality, and the culture of indigenous people throughout the Western Hemisphere.

Maroon settlements often possessed a clannish, outsider identity. They sometimes developed Creole languages by mixing European tongues with their original African languages. One such maroon creole language, in Suriname, is Saramaccan. At other times, the maroons would adopt variations of a local European language (creolization) as a common tongue, for members of the community frequently spoke a variety of mother tongues.

The maroons created their own independent communities, which in some cases have survived for centuries, and until recently remained separate from mainstream society. In the 19th and 20th centuries, maroon communities began to disappear as forests were razed, although some countries, such as Guyana and Suriname, still have large maroon populations living in the forests. Recently, many of them moved to cities and towns as the process of urbanization accelerates.

== Types of maroons ==

A typical maroon community in the early stage usually consists of three types of people.

* Most of them were slaves who ran away directly after they got off the ships. They refused to surrender their freedom and often tried to find ways to go back to Africa.
*The second group were slaves who had been working on plantations for a while. Those slaves were usually somewhat adjusted to the slave system but had been abused by the plantation owners – often with excessive brutality. Others ran away when they were being sold suddenly to a new owner.
*The last group of maroons were usually skilled slaves with particularly strong opposition to the slave system.

== Relationship with colonial governments ==

Maroonage was a constant threat to New World slavocracies. Punishments for recaptured maroons were severe, like removing the Achilles tendon, amputating a leg, castration, and being roasted to death.

Maroon communities had to be inaccessible and located in inhospitable environments to be sustainable. For example, maroon communities were established in remote swamps in the southern United States; in deep canyons with sinkholes but little water or fertile soil in Jamaica; and in deep jungles of the Guianas.

Maroon communities turned the severity of their environments to their advantage to hide and defend their communities. Disguised pathways, false trails, booby traps, underwater paths, quagmires and quicksand, and natural features were all used to conceal maroon villages.

Maroons utilised exemplary guerrilla warfare skills to fight their European enemies. Nanny, the famous Jamaican maroon, used guerrilla warfare tactics that are also used today by many militaries around the world. European troops used strict and established strategies while maroons attacked and retracted quickly, used ambush tactics, and fought when and where they wanted to.

Even though colonial governments were in a perpetual state of conflict with the maroon communities, individuals in the colonial system traded goods and services with them. Maroons also traded with isolated white settlers and Native American communities. Maroon communities played interest groups off of one another. At the same time, maroon communities were also used as pawns when colonial powers clashed.

Absolute secrecy and loyalty of members were crucial to the survival of maroon communities. To ensure this loyalty, maroon communities used severe methods to protect against desertion and spies. New members were brought to communities by way of detours so they could not find their way back and served probationary periods, often as slaves. Crimes such as desertion and adultery were punishable by death.

== Geographical distribution ==

=== Africa ===

==== Mauritius ====

Under governor Adriaan van der Stel in 1642, the early Dutch settlers of the Dutch East India Company brought 105 slaves from Madagascar and parts of Asia to work for them in Dutch Mauritius. However, 50 of these first slaves, including women, escaped in the wilderness of Dutch Mauritius. Only 18 of these escapees were caught. On 18 June 1695, a gang of maroons of Indonesian and Chinese origins, including Aaron d&#x27;Amboine, Antoni (Bamboes) and Paul de Batavia, as well as female escapees Anna du Bengale and Espérance, set fire to the Dutch settlers&#x27; Fort Frederick Hendryk (Vieux Grand Port) in an attempt to take over control of the island. They were all caught and decapitated. In February 1706 another revolt was organised by the remaining maroons as well as disgruntled slaves. When the Dutch abandoned Dutch Mauritius in 1710 the maroons stayed behind.

When representatives of the French East India Company landed on the island in 1715 they also had to face attacks by the Mauritian maroons. Significant events were the 1724 assault on a military outpost in Savannah district, as well as the attack on a military barrack in 1732 at Poste de Flacq. Several deaths resulted from such attacks. Soon after his arrival in 1735, Mahé de La Bourdonnais assembled and equipped French militia groups made of both civilians and soldiers to fight against the maroons. In 1739, maroon leader Sans Souci was captured near Flacq and was burnt alive by the French settlers. A few years later, a group of French settlers gave chase to Barbe Blanche, another maroon leader, but lost track of him at Le Morne. Other maroons included Diamamouve and Madame Françoise.

==== Réunion ====

The most important maroons on Réunion were Cimendef, Cotte, Dimitile and Maffate.

=== North America ===

==== Canada ====

===== Nova Scotia =====

In the 1790s, about 600 Jamaican Maroons were deported to British settlements in Nova Scotia, where American slaves who had escaped from the United States were also resettled. Being unhappy with conditions, in 1800, a majority emigrated to Freetown, West Africa where they identified as the Sierra Leone Creoles.

==== Caribbean ====

===== Cuba =====

In Cuba, escaped slaves joined refugee Taínos in the mountains to form maroon communities.

In 1538, runaways helped the French to sack the city of Havana.

In 1731, slaves rose up in revolt at the Cobre mines, and set up an independent community at Sierra del Cobre, which existed untroubled until 1781, when the self-freed population had increased to over 1,000. In 1781, the Spanish colonial authorities agreed to recognise the freedom of the people of this community.

In 1797, one of the captured leaders of a &quot;palenque&quot; near Jaruco was an Indian from the Yucatán.

In the 1810s, Ventura Sanchez, also known as Coba, was in charge of a &quot;palenque&quot; of several hundred maroons in the mountains not far from Santiago de Cuba. Sanchez was tricked into going to Santiago de Cuba, where he committed suicide rather than be captured and returned to slavery. The leadership of the palenque then passed to Manuel Grinan, also known as Gallo.

The &quot;palenque&quot; of Bumba was so well organised that they even sent maroons in small boats to Jamaica and Santo Domingo to trade. In 1830, the Spanish colonial authorities carried out military expeditions against the &quot;palenques&quot; of Bumba and Maluala. Antonio de Leon eventually succeeded in destroying the &quot;palenque&quot; of Bumba.

In the 1830s, &quot;palenques&quot; of maroon communities thrived in western Cuba, in particular the areas surrounding San Diego de Nunez. The Office of the Capture of Maroons reported that between 1797 and 1846, there were thousands of runaways living in these &quot;palenques&quot;. However, the eastern mountains harboured the longer lasting &quot;palenques&quot;, in particular those of Moa and Maluala, where the maroons thrived until the First War of Independence in 1868, when large numbers of maroons joined the Cuban Liberation Army.

There are 28 identified archaeological sites in the Viñales Valley related to runaway African slaves or maroons of the early 19th century; the material evidence of their presence is found in caves of the region, where groups settled for various lengths of time. Oral tradition tells that maroons took refuge on the slopes of the mogotes and in the caves; the Viñales Municipal Museum has archaeological exhibits that depict the life of runaway slaves, as deduced through archeological research. Cultural traditions reenacted during the &quot;Semana de la Cultura&quot; (Week of Culture) celebrate the town&#x27;s founding in 1607.

===== Dominica, Saint Lucia, and Saint Vincent =====

Similar maroon communities developed on islands across the Caribbean, such as those of the Garifuna people on Saint Vincent. Many of the Garifuna were deported to the American mainland, where some eventually settled along the Mosquito Coast or in Belize. From their original landing place in Roatan Island off the coast of Honduras, the maroons moved to Trujillo. Gradually groups migrated south into the Miskito Kingdom and north into Belize.

In Dominica, escaped slaves joined indigenous Kalinago in the island&#x27;s densely forested interior to create maroon communities, which were constantly in conflict with the British colonial authorities throughout the period of formal chattel slavery.

In the French colony of Saint Lucia, maroons and fugitive French Revolutionary Army soldiers formed the so-called , which comprised about 6,000 men who fought the First Brigand War against the British who had recently occupied the island. Led by the French Commissioner, Gaspard Goyrand, they succeeded in taking back control of most of the island from the British, but on 26 May 1796, their forces defending the fort at Morne Fortune, about 2,000 men surrendered to a British division under the command of General John Moore. After the capitulation, over 2,500 French and Afro-Caribbean prisoners of war as well as ninety-nine women and children, were transported from St. Lucia to Portchester Castle. They were eventually sent to France in a prisoner exchange; some remained in Europe while others returned to France.

===== Dominican Republic =====

American &quot;marronage&quot; began in Spain&#x27;s colony on the island of Hispaniola. Governor Nicolás de Ovando was already complaining of escaped slaves and their interactions with the Taíno Indians by 1503. The first slave rebellion occurred in Hispaniola on the sugar plantations owned by Admiral Diego Columbus, on 26 December 1522, and was brutally crushed by the Admiral.

Maroons joined the natives in their wars against the Spanish and hid with the rebel chieftain Enriquillo in the Bahoruco Mountains. When Archdeacon Alonso de Castro toured Hispaniola in 1542, he estimated the maroon population at 2,000–3,000 persons.

===== Haiti =====

The French encountered many forms of slave resistance during the 17th and 18th centuries, in Saint Domingue, which later came to be called Haiti. Formerly enslaved Africans who fled to remote mountainous areas were called &quot;marron&quot; (French) or &quot;mawon&quot; (Haitian Creole), meaning &#x27;escaped slave&#x27;. The maroons formed close-knit communities that practised small-scale agriculture and hunting. They were known to return to plantations to free family members and friends. On a few occasions, they also joined the Taíno settlements, who had escaped the Spanish in the 17th century. In the late 17th and early 18th centuries, there were a large number of maroons living in the Bahoruco mountains. In 1702, a French expedition against them killed three maroons and captured 11, but over 30 evaded capture, and retreated further into the mountainous forests. Further expeditions were carried out against them with limited success, though they did succeed in capturing one of their leaders, Michel, in 1719. In subsequent expeditions, in 1728 and 1733, French forces captured 46 and 32 maroons respectively. No matter how many detachments were sent against these maroons, they continued to attract runaways. Expeditions in 1740, 1742, 1746, 1757 and 1761 had minor successes against these maroons, but failed to destroy their hideaways.

In 1776–1777, a joint French–Spanish expedition ventured into the border regions of the Bahoruco mountains, with the intention of destroying the maroon settlements there. However, the maroons had been alerted of their coming, and had abandoned their villages and caves, retreating further into the mountainous forests where they could not be found. The detachment eventually returned, unsuccessful and having lost many soldiers to illness and desertion. In the years that followed, the maroons attacked a number of settlements, including Fond-Parisien, for food, weapons, gunpowder and women. It was on one of these excursions that one of the maroon leaders, Kebinda, who had been born in freedom in the mountains, was captured. He later died in captivity.

In 1782, de Saint-Larry decided to offer peace terms to one of the maroon leaders, Santiago, granting them freedom in return for which they would hunt all further runaways and return them to their owners. Eventually, at the end of 1785, terms were agreed, and the more than 100 maroons under Santiago&#x27;s command stopped making incursions into French colonial territory.

Other slave resistance efforts against the French plantation system were more direct. The maroon leader Mackandal led a movement to poison the drinking water of the plantation owners in the 1750s.

Boukman declared war on the French plantation owners in 1791, setting off the Haitian Revolution. A statue called the &quot;Le Nègre Marron&quot; or the &quot;Nèg Mawon&quot; is an iconic bronze bust that was erected in the heart of Port-au-Prince to commemorate the role of maroons in Haitian independence.

===== Jamaica =====

People who escaped from slavery during the Spanish occupation of the island of Jamaica fled to the interior and joined the Taíno living there, forming refugee communities. Later, many of them gained freedom during the confusion surrounding the 1655 English Invasion of Jamaica. Some refugee slaves continued to join them through the decades until the abolition of slavery in 1838, but in the main, after the signing of the treaties of 1739 and 1740, the Maroons hunted runaway slaves in return for payment from the British colonial authorities.

During the late 17th and 18th centuries, the British tried to capture the maroons because they occasionally raided plantations, and made expansion into the interior more difficult. An increase in armed confrontations over decades led to the First Maroon War in the 1730s, but the British were unable to defeat the maroons. They finally settled with the groups by treaty in 1739 and 1740, allowing them to have autonomy in their communities in exchange for agreeing to be called to military service with the colonists if needed. Certain maroon factions became so formidable that they made treaties with local colonial authorities, sometimes negotiating their independence in exchange for helping to hunt down other slaves who escaped.

Due to tensions and repeated conflicts with maroons from Trelawny Town, the Second Maroon War erupted in 1795. After the governor tricked the Trelawny Maroons into surrendering, the colonial government deported approximately 600 captive maroons to Nova Scotia. Due to their difficulties and those of Black Loyalists settled at Nova Scotia and England after the American Revolution, Great Britain established a colony in West Africa, Sierra Leone. It offered ethnic Africans a chance to set up their community there, beginning in 1792. Around 1800, several hundred Jamaican maroons were transported to Freetown, the first settlement of Sierra Leone. Eventually, in the 1840s, about 200 Trelawny Maroons returned to Jamaica, and settled in the village of Flagstaff in the parish of St James, not far from Trelawny Town, which is now named Maroon Town, Jamaica.

The only Leeward Maroon settlement that retained formal autonomy in Jamaica after the Second Maroon War was Accompong, in Saint Elizabeth Parish, whose people had abided by their 1739 treaty with the British. A Windward Maroon community is also located at Charles Town, Jamaica, on Buff Bay River in Portland Parish. Another is at Moore Town (formerly Nanny Town), also in the parish of Portland. In 2005, the music of the Moore Town Maroons was declared by UNESCO as a &#x27;Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.&#x27; A fourth community is at Scott&#x27;s Hall, Jamaica, in the parish of St Mary. Accompong&#x27;s autonomy was ratified by the government of Jamaica when the island gained independence in 1962.

The government has tried to encourage the survival of the other maroon settlements. The Jamaican government and the maroon communities organised the Annual International Maroon Conference, initially to be held at rotating communities around the island, but the conference has been held at Charles Town since 2009. Maroons from other Caribbean, Central, and South America nations are invited. In 2016, Accompong&#x27;s colonel and a delegation traveled to the Kingdom of Ashanti in Ghana to renew ties with the Akan and Asante people of their ancestors.

===== Puerto Rico =====

In Puerto Rico, Taíno families from neighboring Utuado moved into the southwestern mountain ranges, along with escaped African slaves who intermarried with them. The DNA analysis of contemporary persons from this area shows maternal ancestry from the Mandinka, Wolof, and Fulani peoples through the mtDNA African haplotype associated with them yet also carried at low frequencies by Spaniards, L1b, which is present here. This was carried by African slaves who escaped from plantations around Ponce and formed communities with the Arawak (Taíno and Kalinago) in the mountains. Arawak lineages (Taíno people represented within haplogroups A and Kalinago people represented within haplogroups C) can also be found in this area.

===== Martinique =====

In Martinique, The escaped African slaves had fled to the maroon settlement in the northern woods to escape the French plantation system as well as the overseers along with white settlers, during the French Revolution, the Igbo slaves fought for freedom of which the French National Convention abolished slavery in 1794. But it was not until 1848, where the last slave uprising was occurred, which became the first French overseas territory to abolish slavery along with other French colonies. 

==== Central America ====

===== Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua =====

Several different maroon societies developed around the Gulf of Honduras. Some were found in the interior of modern-day Honduras, along the trade routes by which silver mined on the Pacific side of the isthmus was carried by slaves down to coastal towns such as Trujillo or Puerto Caballos to be shipped to Europe. When slaves escaped, they went to the mountains for safety. In 1548, in what is now Honduras, slaves in San Pedro rebelled, led by a self-freed slave named Miguel, who set up his own capital. The Spaniards had to send in reinforcements to put down the revolt.

In 1648, the English bishop of Guatemala, Thomas Gage, reported active bands of maroons numbering in the hundreds along these routes.

The Miskito Sambu were a maroon group who formed from slaves who revolted on a Portuguese ship around 1640, wrecking the vessel on the coast of Honduras-Nicaragua and escaping into the interior. They intermarried with the indigenous people over the next half-century. They eventually rose to leadership of the Mosquito Coast and led extensive slave raids against Spanish-held territories in the first half of the 18th century.

The Garifuna are descendants of maroon communities that developed on the island of Saint Vincent. They were deported to the coast of Honduras in 1797.

===== Panama =====

Bayano, a Mandinka man who had been enslaved and taken to Panama in 1552, led a rebellion that year against the Spanish in Panama. He and his followers escaped to found villages in the lowlands. Viceroy Canete felt unable to subdue these maroons, so he offered them terms that entailed a recognition of their freedom, provided they refused to admit any newcomers and returned runaways to their owners.

Later these people, known as the &quot;Cimarrón&quot;, assisted Sir Francis Drake in fighting against the Spanish.

==== Mexico ====

Gaspar Yanga was an African leader of a Maroon colony in the Veracruz highlands in what is now Mexico. It is believed Yanga had been a fugitive since the early 1570s, and was the leader of a formidable group of maroons.

In 1609, Captain Pedro Gonzalo de Herrera lad an expedition against Yanga and his maroons, but despite severe casualties on both sides, neither emerged the victor. Instead, Yanga negotiated with the Spanish colonists to establish a self-ruled maroon settlement called San Lorenzo de los Negros (later renamed Yanga). Yanga secured recognition of the freedom of his maroons, and his &quot;palenque&quot; was accorded the status of a free town. In return, Yanga was required to return any further runaways to the Spanish colonial authorities.

The Costa Chica of Guerrero and of Oaxaca include many hard-to-access areas that also provided refuge for slaves escaping Spanish ranches and estates on the Pacific coast. Evidence of these communities can be found in the Afro-Mexican population of the region. Other Afro-Mexican communities descended from people who escaped slavery are found in Veracruz and in Northern Mexico; some of the later communities were populated by people who escaped slavery in the United States via the Southern Underground Railroad.

==== United States ====
===== Florida =====

Maroons who escaped from the Thirteen Colonies and allied with Seminole Indians were one of the largest and most successful maroon communities in what is now Florida due to more rights and freedoms extracted from the Spanish Empire. Some intermarried and were culturally Seminole; others maintained a more African culture. Descendants of those who were removed with the Seminole to Indian Territory in the 1830s are recognized as Black Seminoles. Many were formerly part of the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma, but have been excluded since the late 20th century by new membership rules that require proving Native American descent from historic documents.

===== Georgia =====
In the late 18th century, two maroon settlements were established on Abercorn Island (then called Belleisle), situated upriver from Savannah along the Savannah River, in modern-day Effingham County. In 1787, these settlements were destroyed by a local militia. Afterwards, the maroons established another settlement at Bear Creek, though this settlement was also raided and its leader was killed.

===== Illinois =====

Lakeview was established as a Freedmen&#x27;s town by a group of African-American runaway slaves and freedmen who immigrated from North Carolina shortly after the War of 1812. They arrived between 1818 and 1820. This area was ideal for the remaining Native Americans who lived, hunted, fished, and farmed this region and the black community integrated with the Amerindians.

===== Louisiana =====

Until the mid-1760s, maroon colonies lined the shores of Lake Borgne, just downriver of New Orleans, Louisiana. These escaped, enslaved people controlled many of the canals and back-country passages from Lake Pontchartrain to the Gulf, including the Rigolets. The San Malo community was a long-thriving autonomous community. These colonies were eventually eradicated by militia from Spanish-controlled New Orleans led by Francisco Bouligny. Free people of color aided in their capture.

People who escaped enslavement in ante-bellum America continued to find refuge and freedom in rural Louisiana, including in areas around New Orleans.

===== North Carolina and Virginia =====

The Great Dismal Swamp maroons inhabited the marshlands of the Great Dismal Swamp in Virginia and North Carolina. Although conditions were harsh, research suggests that thousands lived there between about 1700 and the 1860s.

Robeson County, North Carolina was a place where Blacks, Native Americans, and even some outlaw whites lived together and intermingled producing a people of great genetic mixture.

=== South America ===

==== Brazil ====

One of the best-known &quot;quilombos&quot; (maroon settlements) in Brazil was Palmares (the Palm Nation), which was founded in the early 17th century. At its height, it had a population of over 30,000 free people and was ruled by King Zumbi. Palmares maintained its independent existence for almost a hundred years until it was conquered by the Portuguese in 1694.

Of the 10 major &quot;quilombos&quot; in colonial Brazil, seven were destroyed within two years of being formed. Four fell in the state of Bahia in 1632, 1636, 1646 and 1796. The other three met the same fate in Rio in 1650, Parahyba in 1731, and Piumhy in 1758.

One &quot;quilombo&quot; in Minas Gerais lasted from 1712–1719. Another, the &quot;Carlota&quot; of Mato Grosso, was wiped out after existing for 25 years, from 1770–1795.

There were also a number of smaller &quot;quilombos&quot;. The first reported &quot;quilombo&quot; was in 1575 in Bahia. Another &quot;quilombo&quot; in Bahia was reported at the start of the 17th century. Between 1737 and 1787, a small &quot;quilombo&quot; thrived in the vicinity of São Paulo.

The region of Campo Grande and São Francisco was often populated with &quot;quilombos&quot;. In 1741, Jean Ferreira organised an expedition against a &quot;quilombo&quot;, but many runaways escaped capture. In 1746, a subsequent expedition captured 120 members of the &quot;quilombo&quot;. In 1752, an expedition led by Pere Marcos was attacked by &quot;quilombo&quot; fighters, resulting in significant loss of life.

&quot;Quilombos&quot; continued to form in the 19th century. In 1810, a &quot;quilombo&quot; was discovered at Linhares in the state of São Paulo. A decade later, another was found in Minas. In 1828, another &quot;quilombo&quot; was discovered at Cahuca, near Recife, and a year later an expedition was mounted against yet another at Corcovado, near Rio de Janeiro. In 1855, the Maravilha &quot;quilombo&quot; in Amazonas was destroyed.

The most famous &quot;quilombo&quot; was Palmares, an independent, self-sustaining community near Recife, established in about 1600. Part of the reason for the massive size of Palmares was due to its location in Brazil — at the median point between the Atlantic Ocean and Guinea, an important area of the African slave trade. &quot;Quilombo dos Palmares&quot; was a self-sustaining community of escaped slaves from the Portuguese settlements in Brazil, &quot;a region perhaps the size of Portugal in the hinterland of Bahia&quot;. At its height, Palmares had a population of over 30,000.

In 1612, the Portuguese tried in vain to take Palmares in an expedition that proved to be very costly. In 1640, a Dutch scouting mission found that the self-freed community of Palmares was spread over two settlements, with about 6,000 living in one location and another 5,000 in another. Dutch expeditions against Palmares in the 1640s were similarly unsuccessful. Between 1672 and 1694, Palmares withstood, on average, one Portuguese expedition nearly every year.

Ganga Zumba and Zumbi are the two best-known warrior-leaders of Palmares which, after a history of conflict with first Dutch and then Portuguese colonial authorities, finally fell to a Portuguese artillery assault in 1694.

Numerous descendants of Quilombo residents, or Quilombolas, continue to live in historic quilombo settlements post-emancipation. Their status as a &quot;traditional people&quot; was recognized in the 1988 Constitution of Brazil, although they continue to campaign for land rights and protections from violence.

==== Colombia ====

In 1529, in what is now Colombia, rebel slaves destroyed Santa Marta.

Escaped slaves established independent communities along the remote Pacific coast, outside of the reach of the colonial administration. At the start of the seventeenth century, a group of runaways had established a &quot;palenque&quot; on the outskirts of the Magdalena River. Eventually, in 1654, the governor of Cartegena de Indias, Don Pedro Zapata, defeated and subdued this community of runaway maroons.

In what is now Colombia, in the district of Popayán, the &quot;palenque&quot; of Castillo was successfully established by runaway slaves. In 1732, the Spanish authorities tried to secure peace terms with the maroons of Castillo by inserting a clause requiring them to return runaways, but the rulers of Castillo rejected those terms. In 1745, the colonial authorities defeated Castillo, and over 200 African and Indian runaways surrendered.

The Caribbean coast still sees maroon communities like San Basilio de Palenque, where the creole Palenquero language is spoken. This community began at the start of the seventeenth century, when Benkos Biohó led a group of about 30 runaways into the forests, and defeated attempts to subdue them. Biohó declared himself King Benkos, and his &quot;palenque&quot; of San Basilio attracted large numbers of runaways to join his community. His maroons defeated the first expedition sent against them, killing their leader Juan Gomez. The Spanish arrived at terms with Biohó, but later they captured him in 1619, accused him of plotting against the Spanish, and had him hanged.

But runaways continued to escape to freedom in San Basilio. In 1696, the colonial authorities subdued another rebellion there, and again between 1713 and 1717. Eventually, the Spanish agreed to peace terms with the &quot;palenque&quot; of San Basilio, and in 1772, this community of maroons was included within the Mahates district, as long they no longer accepted any further runaways.

==== Ecuador ====

In addition to escaped slaves, survivors from shipwrecks formed independent communities along rivers of the northern coast and mingled with indigenous communities in areas beyond the reach of the colonial administration. Separate communities can be distinguished from the &quot;cantones&quot; Cojimies y Tababuela, Esmeraldas, Limones.

==== The Guianas ====

Marronage was common in British, Dutch, and French Guiana, and today descendants of maroons account for about 15% of the current population of Suriname and 22% in French Guiana. In the Guianas, escaped slaves, locally known as &#x27;Bushinengues&#x27;, fled to the interior and joined with indigenous peoples and created several independent tribes, among them the Saramaka, the Paramaka, the Ndyuka (Aukan), the Kwinti, the Aluku (Boni), and the Matawai.

The Ndyuka were the first to sign a peace treaty offering them territorial autonomy in 1760.

In the 1770s, the Aluku also desired a peace treaty, but the Society of Suriname started a war against them, resulting in a flight into French Guiana. The other tribes signed peace treaties with the Surinamese government, the Kwinti being the last in 1887. On 25 May 1891 the Aluku officially became French citizens.

After Suriname gained independence from the Netherlands, the old treaties with the Bushinengues were abrogated. By the 1980s the Bushinengues in Suriname had begun to fight for their land rights. Between 1986 and 1992, the Surinamese Interior War was waged by the Jungle Commando, a guerrilla group fighting for the rights of the maroon minority, against the military dictatorship of Dési Bouterse. In 2005, following a ruling by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, the Suriname government agreed to compensate survivors of the 1986 Moiwana village massacre, in which soldiers had slaughtered 39 unarmed Ndyuka people, mainly women and children. On 13 June 2020, Ronnie Brunswijk was elected Vice President of Suriname by acclamation in an uncontested election. He was inaugurated on 16 July as the first Maroon in Suriname to serve as vice president.

In modern-day Guyana, Dutch officials in 1744 conducted an expedition against encampments of at least 300 Maroons in the Northwest district of Essequibo. The Dutch nailed severed hands of Maroons killed in the expedition to posts in the colony as a warning to other slaves. In 1782, a French official in the region estimated there were more than 2,000 Maroons in the vicinity of Berbice, Demerara, and Essequibo.

==== Venezuela ====

There were a number of rebellions of slaves throughout the history of the colony.

Through the region of Barlovento, many free and escaped slaves founded communities, known as &quot;cumbes&quot;. One of the most well-known of these settlements is Curiepe, where the annual Fiesta de San Juan is celebrated. Another was the &quot;cumbe&quot; of Ocoyta, led by runaway Guillermo Ribas, which reportedly engaged in a number of attacks on the neighbouring towns of Chuspa and Panaquire. These Venezuelan maroons also traded in cocoa. Guillermo ran away in 1768, and formed a &quot;cumbe&quot; which included runaways of African and Indian origin.

The &quot;cumbe&quot; of Ocoyta was eventually destroyed in 1771. A military expedition led by German de Aguilera destroyed the settlement, killing Guillermo, but only succeeded in capturing eight adults and two children. The rest of the runaways withdrew into the surrounding forests, where they remained at large.

One of Guillermo&#x27;s deputies, Ubaldo the Englishman, whose christened name was Jose Eduardo de la Luz Perera, was initially born a slave in London, sold to a ship captain, and took a number of trips before eventually being granted his freedom. He was one of a number of free black people who joined the community of Ocoyta. In 1772, he was captured by the Spanish authorities.

There were many &quot;cumbes&quot; in the interior of what later became Venezuela. In 1810, when the War of Independence began, many members of these &quot;cumbes&quot; fought on the side of the rebels, and abandoned their villages.

<doc id="1017615" wikidata="Q314235" url="?curid=1017615" title="Chris Kirkland">
<text>Christopher Edmund Kirkland (born 2 May 1981) is an English football coach and former professional goalkeeper who is the head goalkeeping coach at Colne. As a player, he made 321 league and cup appearances in an 18-year professional career from 1998 to 2016 and won one cap for the English national team in 2006.

Kirkland started his career at Coventry City, where he was regarded as one of the country&#x27;s most promising young goalkeepers. He was later signed by Premier League club Liverpool for £6 million in August 2001. However, his time at the club was blighted by recurring injuries, which almost caused him to retire from football altogether. He would later sign for Wigan Athletic in July 2006, after a successful loan period. He had further loan spells at both Leicester City and Doncaster Rovers before being signed by Sheffield Wednesday in May 2012. He joined Preston North End in August 2015 and had a brief spell with Bury before retiring in August 2016.

A year after retiring from playing, Kirkland took up coaching with Port Vale in January 2017. He subsequently joined the coaching staff of Liverpool Women the following year and was briefly a player—manager for a month and a half.

==Club career==
===Coventry City===
Kirkland was born in Barwell, Leicestershire, where he grew up with his parents, Marie and Eddie, and attended Heathfield School and then Henley College Coventry. His father, Eddie, was a crane driver and spent many hours helping his son practise his goalkeeping skills. After an unsuccessful trial with Blackburn Rovers, he accepted a contract offer from Coventry City. He signed professional terms with the club in July 1998.

Kirkland made his debut for Coventry in the League Cup in a 3–1 victory over Tranmere Rovers at Highfield Road on 22 September 1999. Manager Gordon Strachan began selecting him in Premier League matches ahead of Swedish international Magnus Hedman despite saying Kirkland was &quot;big Bambi who couldn&#x27;t kick the ball out of the penalty box&quot;. His performances were rewarded at the end of the 2000–01 season when he made his debut for the England under-21s, and was voted Coventry&#x27;s Players&#x27; Player of the Year by his teammates. He was linked with moves to Arsenal and Liverpool, despite his relatively limited experience and was eventually bought by Liverpool for £6 million in August 2001. At the time he was the most expensive goalkeeper in British transfer history, at only 20 years old.

===Liverpool===
Kirkland made his debut for Liverpool in October 2001, but mostly served as understudy to first-choice goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek during the 2001–02 season. He was an unused substitute in the 2002 FA Community Shield at the Millennium Stadium, where Liverpool were beaten 1–0 by Arsenal. During the 2002–03 season, costly errors by Dudek in a league fixture against Manchester United resulted in manager Gérard Houllier handing the first-team place to Kirkland in December. He played 14 consecutive matches, during which he kept six clean sheets, but sustained an ankle injury in January 2003, which ruled him out for the rest of the season, meaning he missed the victorious 2003 League Cup final. He spent six weeks out of action after tearing his groin whilst on England under-21 duty in September 2003. He fractured a finger in December 2003, and was ruled out of action for four months after undergoing surgery to repair it.

Kirkland ousted Dudek as first-choice Liverpool keeper at the beginning of the 2004–05 season and played 14 matches before he was again sidelined in December after succumbing to a long-standing back injury. He had played four Champions League matches but was unable to be named in the squad for the 2005 final due to injury; Scott Carson, who took his place on the bench in Istanbul, later offered his Champions League winners medal to Kirkland, who refused to accept it.

In July 2005, Kirkland agreed to go on a season-long loan to Bryan Robson&#x27;s West Bromwich Albion to kick-start his career again. He kept a clean sheet on his Albion debut as the team drew 0–0 away at Manchester City. An injury to Kirkland in the first half of the 2005–06 season saw Polish goalkeeper Tomasz Kuszczak replace him. Kuszczak showed excellent form and therefore remained first-choice goalkeeper at The Hawthorns for the rest of the season. Kirkland also again spent time out of action with a broken finger, and was told by Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez that he would have to move away from Anfield if he wanted to play regular first-team football as new signing Pepe Reina had made an excellent start to his Liverpool career.

===Wigan Athletic===
In July 2006, Kirkland joined Wigan Athletic on a six-month loan spell. Manager Paul Jewell said that &quot;He certainly has the potential, but there&#x27;s the obvious question mark over fitness. It&#x27;s not just been one thing with him because he&#x27;s been unlucky with broken ribs, fingers, knee injuries, back.&quot; This move became permanent for a sum of £2.5 million on 27 October when the two clubs and Kirkland made a compromise. He won the club&#x27;s Players&#x27; Player of the Year and Media Player of the Year awards for the 2007–08 season. A highlight of this season was saving a Benni McCarthy penalty in a 5–3 win over Blackburn Rovers at the DW Stadium. He committed his future to Wigan in May 2008 when he signed a new contract, tying him to the club until 2012.

On 22 November 2009, Kirkland conceded nine goals in a Premier League match against Tottenham Hotspur. Sunderland manager Steve Bruce – Kirkland&#x27;s former manager at Wigan from November 2007 to June 2009 – was linked with a move for Kirkland in January 2010, but said that &quot;talk of me bidding £5m for Chris Kirkland is garbage, but he is a very good goalkeeper, and I&#x27;m a big, big admirer of him&quot;. Speaking in March 2010, manager Roberto Martínez said that &quot;if you look at the standard of his performances – week in, week out – it is up there with the best in England&quot;.

At the start of the 2010–11 season, Wigan were heavily defeated in their first two matches against Blackpool and Chelsea. He was replaced in the starting line-up by Ali Al-Habsi. On 25 November 2010, Kirkland joined Championship club Leicester City on loan until January. A back spasm suffered during training in early December nearly ended his stint at the club, but he resumed his loan after making a speedy recovery. He made his debut in a 3–0 defeat to Ipswich Town on 19 December. Kirkland returned to Wigan for treatment on his back injury, after making three appearances at The Walkers Stadium. He was stretchered off after a collision with Johan Elmander in a 1–1 draw against Bolton Wanderers on 5 January 2011; Kirkland was in the Wigan squad due to Ali Al-Habsi&#x27;s ineligibility to play against his parent club.

Kirkland was going to join Cardiff City on an emergency loan in February 2011 as cover for goalkeeper Tom Heaton, but the deal fell through after he picked up a virus. On 12 October 2011, Kirkland joined Championship Doncaster Rovers on loan until January after attracting interest from new manager Dean Saunders. However, after less than a week into his loan spell at the Keepmoat Stadium, Kirkland was sent back to parent club Wigan following another back spasm.

===Sheffield Wednesday===
In May 2012, Kirkland signed a two-year contract with Championship club Sheffield Wednesday; manager Dave Jones said whoever played best out of Kirkland and Stephen Bywater during pre-season would win a first-team place. Kirkland made his Wednesday debut in a 4–2 League Cup win over Oldham Athletic on 13 August 2012. On 19 October, he was assaulted by a fan who had run onto the pitch during the 1–1 draw against Leeds United. Kirkland required several minutes of treatment after the assault, which was captured on television cameras and immediately followed a Leeds goal. His attacker, Aaron Cawley, went on to plead guilty to assault and was jailed for 16 weeks. Kirkland remained as first-choice goalkeeper throughout most of the 2012–13 and 2013–14 campaigns, but was relegated to second-choice behind Keiren Westwood throughout the majority of the 2014–15 season and left Hillsborough in July 2015 after turning down manager Stuart Gray&#x27;s offer of a new contract.

===Later career===
On 12 August 2015, Kirkland joined Championship club Preston North End on a one-year contract. He was signed as an understudy to on loan goalkeeper Jordan Pickford, and remained on the bench after Pickford was recalled, as Sam Johnstone and Anders Lindegaard also joined the club on loan. Kirkland was released by manager Simon Grayson when his contract at Deepdale expired at the end of the 2015–16 season.

Kirkland joined League One club Bury on a one-year contract in June 2016. However, he left Gigg Lane for personal reasons before the 2016–17 season began in August. He later revealed that he had been fighting a four-year battle with depression.

==International career==
Kirkland won eight caps with the England national under-21 team and was regularly selected for the senior squad from 2003 onwards, but did not make an appearance until he came on as a substitute for the second half of a friendly against Greece in August 2006. When Kirkland was eleven years old, his father and some family friends had placed bets of £100 each at 100/1 odds that he would play for England before the age of 30; Kirkland&#x27;s appearance netted the group £10,000 each.

==Style of play==
Kirkland was identified at an early age as a goalkeeper with an &quot;uncommon mixture of height, agility and bravery&quot;.

==Coaching career==
Kirkland began coaching the goalkeepers at League One club Port Vale in January 2017 as a favour to his friend and former teammate Michael Brown. He also set up the Chris Kirkland Goalkeeper Academy.

In July 2018, Kirkland returned to Liverpool as a goalkeeping coach for the women&#x27;s team. He was appointed caretaker manager of the team on 14 September upon the resignation of Neil Redfearn. Following Vicky Jepson&#x27;s appointment as permanent manager on 26 October, he returned to his previous role as goalkeeping coach. He took on the additional duty as assistant manager. He quit the role in March 2019 to focus on the growing demands of running his goalkeeping academy. He was appointed as head goalkeeping coach at Colne in June 2020.

==Personal life==
He and his wife Leeona had a daughter, Lucy, born on 14 November 2006, which caused him to miss an international friendly match against Netherlands the next day. In April 2008, Kirkland teamed up with fellow professionals Kevin Davies and Brett Emerton to help launch the &quot;Get Started&quot; programme. This national scheme aims to tackle re-offending. He visited Hindley Youth Offenders&#x27; Institution in support of the scheme, which is delivered by The Prince&#x27;s Trust in partnership with the Premier League, the PFA and the Football Foundation.

In July 2022, Kirkland opened up about his painkiller addiction and revealed he had previously considered taking his own life. In July 2024, Kirkland was awarded an honorary doctorate for his mental health work by Edge Hill University.

<doc id="1017624" wikidata="Q5183383" url="?curid=1017624" title="Creamfields (2004 album)">
<text>Creamfields is the fifteenth DJ mix album by British electronic producer and disc jockey Paul Oakenfold, released in 2004. The double album was inspired by the annual Creamfields festival which at the time took place at the &quot;Old Liverpool Airfield&quot; organised by the Cream brand where Oakenfold had often performed. The album was released to commemorate Oakenfold&#x27;s performance at the sixth annual Creamfields festival which took place several weeks after the album&#x27;s release on 28 August 2004. Oakenfold performance at the festival was headlining the Cream/Goodgreef and Mixmag Arena. &quot;Creamfields&quot; was also the third in a series of mix albums of the same name commemorating the festival, with previous albums by different DJs being released in 2000 and 2001, with both releases carrying the same name. Oakenfold&#x27;s &quot;Creamfields&quot; was considered a relaunch of the series

Musically, the album was a return to his &quot;epic&quot; progressive trance style that he had popularised on his acclaimed mix albums &quot;Goa Mix&quot; (1994) and &quot;Perfecto Fluoro&quot; (1996). Like those albums, film dialogue appears, and also features a tribute to &quot;Goa Mix&quot; via a remixed version of that album&#x27;s &quot;Point Zero&quot; by Li Kwan. &quot;Creamfields&quot; also produced several remixes made for the album, and an original song also made exclusively for the album, &quot;I Found You&quot; by Interstate, which was released as a successful single. The album received positive reviews from critics and was subsequently nominated for &quot;Best Electronic/Dance Album&quot; at the 2005 Grammy Awards. The album also reached the top 50 of the UK Compilation Chart.

==Background==

In August 1998, popular Liverpool club night Cream launched an outdoor annual electronic music festival, Creamfields, to take place each August bank holiday. At the time, Oakenfold was a resident DJ at Cream. The successful inaugural event received an attendance of 25,000 festival goers to Winchester in Hampshire, England. For its second edition in 1999, Creamfields moved to the Old Liverpool Airfield, where it remained until 2006. By 2004, the festival&#x27;s attendance had largely increased, reaching as much as 200,000 attenders each year. For the third event in 2000, Creamfields released a double DJ mix album on Virgin Records, simply titled &quot;Creamfields&quot;, which reached number 5 in the UK Compilation Chart. The compilation was a studio mix but commemorated the event. For the fourth event in 2001, Creamfields released another album with the same name mixed by Seb Fontaine and Yousef, who appeared at that year&#x27;s event, although this release was less successful, reaching number 27 in the UK Compilation Chart, and receiving a mixed to negative review from Dean Carlson of AllMusic. The lesser success of this release halted the series, and no album was released for the fifth event in 2002.

Oakenfold had performed at the festival many times. When the festival launched in 1998, Oakenfold had finished his first of two years as a resident DJ at Cream, releasing the DJ mix album &quot;Resident. Two Years of Oakenfold at Cream.&quot; (1999) as his contract finished, although this was not Oakenfold&#x27;s first release for the club. Initially, Oakenfold had mixed a quarter of their acclaimed release &quot;Cream Live&quot; (1995), and a third of its follow-up, &quot;Cream Live Two&quot; (1996), which featured in &quot;Q&quot;&#x27;s 1997 list of &quot;The 10 Best DJ Mix Albums...Ever!&quot;. At the end of 1997, he mixed half of the club&#x27;s year-end release &quot;Cream Anthems 97&quot;, with the other half being mixed by Nick Warren. Besides his role with Cream, Oakenfold had become a popular worldwide DJ, releasing successful DJ mix albums such as &quot;Global Underground: Live in Oslo&quot; (1997), &quot;Global Underground 007: New York&quot; (1998), &quot;Tranceport&quot; (1998) and &quot;Perfecto Presents: Another World&quot; (2000). These albums were all big sellers, with &quot;Another World&quot; at the time being the biggest-selling mix album ever in the US. His mix albums also received acclaim, with &quot;Tranceport&quot; retrospectively being ranked at number 23 in the 2012 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; list of &quot;The 30 Greatest EDM Albums Ever&quot;. Nonetheless, with his first studio album of original material, &quot;Bunkka&quot; (2002), many of his fans were polarised with the new poppier direction he had taken, and although continuing to be a big name DJ, he had lost several fans. Oakenfold described &quot;Bunkka&quot; as an example of him pushing his own boundaries and being influenced by other genres, but whilst the album sold a million copies worldwide, becoming his best-selling album, the mixed fan response lead Oakenfold wanting to return to older styles he had popularised, such as progressive trance and Goa trance.

By 2004, other Creamfields events were being held in other locations around the world, although the original Creamfields continued to be held at the Old Liverpool Airfield. For the 2004 Creamfields event held at the Old Liverpool Airfield, the sixth such annual Creamfields held in England on 28 August 2004, Oakenfold headlined the Cream/Goodgreef and Mixmag Arena. For the event, Oakenfold and Creamfields decided that Oakenfold could mix a DJ mix album to promote his performance. The album would relaunch the &quot;Creamfields&quot; DJ mix album series and commemorate the event.

==Music==

In many ways, &quot;Creamfields&quot; marked a return to the &quot;epic&quot; trance style Oakenfold had popularised in the 1990s on mixes such as &quot;Goa Mix&quot; (1994) and &quot;Perfecto Fluoro&quot; (1996). The opening track is Li Kwan&#x27;s &quot;Point Zero&quot;, albeit in a remixed form known as &quot;Point Zero 2004&quot;, is a nod to &quot;Goa Mix&quot;, which features the same track as its third track. The second song on the album, &quot;I Found U&quot; by the production duo of music producer Mike Burns and Mark Lewis known as Interstate, was later released as a single and made a big impact among fans, reaching number one in several countries. The song was written for the album and had not previously been released. The pace is slightly increased with Duran &amp; Aytek’s &quot;First Sight&quot;, which has Balearic influences. The &quot;typically uplifting elements of trance&quot; are brought into the mix with &quot;Clear Blue&quot; from Markus Schulz presents Elevation, whose beat has been described as &quot;infectious&quot;. Paul Oakenfold&#x27;s mix of Carlos Vives&#x27;s &quot;Como Tu&quot; was described as &quot;delicious combination of worldbeat chant and dancefloor drama,&quot; and &quot;truly symphonic in feel. Fundamentally trance in sound, it’s structured in a very progressive way. The subtle nuances of this track would be lost in a big arena but emphasised in a small club.&quot; By the appearance of &quot;12&quot; by Tilt, the mix reaches strong progressive trance territory with a slightly darker twist. Like the aforementioned &quot;Goa Mix&quot; and &quot;Perfecto Fluoro&quot;, film dialogue also appears the album, here in the shape of Quivver&#x27;s &quot;Space Manoeuvres&quot;, which contains samples of speech from the 1998 movie &quot;Dark City&quot;.

On the second disc, Oakenfold &quot;discovers breaks, bleeps, and bloops for the first part of the set, works steadily up to his epic U2 remix, and exits with a couple reliable stompers.&quot; The song opens with the progressive breaks of &quot;Ocean of Love&quot; by Suzy Solar. Pinkbox Special&#x27;s &quot;Nice Guys Finish Last&quot;, the third track on the disc, was noted for managing &quot;to maintain the so far prog breaks feel within the mix,&quot; with the pace speeding up with the next track, Lemon 8&#x27;s remix of Girl Nobody&#x27;s &quot;Cages&quot;. Stel &amp; Good Newz’s &quot;Particle&quot; has an &quot;atmospheric breakdown leading into an uplifting tone.&quot; The tenth and eleventh tracks on the disc are both &quot;2004 Mixes&quot; by Oakenfold created exclusively for the compilation. The first of these, a remix of U2&#x27;s 2000 single &quot;Beautiful Day&quot;, is sometimes seen as the disc&#x27;s highlight.

==Release and reception==

The album was released on 9 August 2004 by New State Recordings, nineteen days before his performance at the festival, and was the first Creamfields album to be released on the label, as the previous two albums were released by Virgin Records. The album was released in both the UK and the US, whereas the previous albums were only released in the UK. Ultimately, the album was not as commercially successful as previous &quot;Creamfields&quot; albums in the UK, only reaching number 49 in the UK Compilation Chart, but the copies sold in the US assured it was more popular than the 2001 &quot;Creamfields&quot; album. The album was successful enough to the point where Creamfields continued to release albums in the series, mixed by a DJ appearing at the festival. The subsequent edition, 2005&#x27;s &quot;Creamfields&quot; mixed by Ferry Corsten, was slightly more commercially successful in the UK, reaching number 44 in the UK Compilation Chart.

The album received positive reviews from music critics. Antonella Sirec of Resident Advisor rated the album four stars out of five (4.0/5), stating &quot;overall, [she] thoroughly enjoyed listening to this compilation not just once but many times over. With a combination of both old and new, this was a pleasure for [her] to experience. Technically, the mixing is quite simple but it&#x27;s predominantly about the music. While many of us have moved on to other aspects of the underground, [She has] always made a concerted effort to stay in touch with [her] trance roots. Not every trance release is great but compilations such as this are a real indulgence.&quot; She also noted &quot;as a DJ, Paul Oakenfold managed to surprise me greatly, which is exactly what he achieved with this &quot;Creamfields&quot; mix. This will not be to everyone’s tastes but it fits [hers],&quot; noting the album was a comeback for Oakenfold after his less certain direction taken with his studio album &quot;Bunkka&quot;, and stated she preferred the first disc. David Jeffries of Allmusic rated the album three out of five stars, stating &quot;there are thrills but few surprises from this one-time maverick, but if Oakie is trying to sonically reproduce the massive size of a Creamfields&#x27; event, he&#x27;s done it. Skip past the lackluster kickoff and think film composer John Williams as a DJ with a wicked haircut.&quot; Unlike Sirec, Jeffries preferred the second disc.

The album was subsequently nominated for &quot;Best Electronic/Dance Album&quot; at the 47th Annual Grammy Awards in 2005, the first time the award was held at the Grammy Awards. It was one of five albums nominated, and one of two mix albums. The award was won by Basement Jaxx&#x27;s &quot;Kish Kash&quot; (2003). Nine years after the album&#x27;s release, Oakenfold and Cream would team up for another mix album, as Oakenfold mixed Cream&#x27;s twenty-first anniversary album, &quot;Cream 21&quot; (2013).

<doc id="1017627" wikidata="Q1753431" url="?curid=1017627" title="Requinto">
<text>The term requinto is used in both Spanish and Portuguese to mean a smaller, higher-pitched version of another instrument. Thus, there are &quot;requinto&quot; guitars, drums, and several wind instruments.

==Wind instruments==

&quot;Requinto&quot; was 19th-century Spanish for &quot;little clarinet&quot;. Today, the word &quot;requinto&quot;, when used in relation to a clarinet, refers to the E-flat clarinet, also known as &quot;requint&quot; in Valencian language.

&quot;Requinto&quot; can also mean a high-pitched flute (akin to a piccolo), or the person who plays it. In Galicia, the word may refer to a wooden fife-like instrument held sideways.

==Small guitar==

The &quot;requinto&quot; guitar has six nylon strings with a scale length of , which is about 18% smaller than a standard guitar scale.
&quot;Requintos&quot; are tuned: A2-D3-G3-C4-E4-A4 (one fourth higher than the standard classical guitar).

It was made popular throughout the 1940s by Mexican guitarist/vocalist Alfredo Gil of romantic music trio &quot;Los Panchos.&quot;
&quot;Requinto&quot; guitars are also used throughout Latin America.

&quot;Requintos&quot; made in Mexico have a deeper body than a standard classical guitar ( as opposed to ). &quot;Requintos&quot; made in Spain tend to be of the same depth as the standard classical.

==Other stringed instruments==
===Portuguese violas===
Many Portuguese violas, such as the Viola braguesa, have smaller requinto versions also, called &#x27;requinta&#x27;.
The Viola Braguesa Requinta is tuned: A4 A3, C5 C4, F5 F4, C#5 C#5, E5 E5. This tuning is a fifth above the standard Viola braguesa.

===Puerto Rican tiples===
In Puerto Rico, there are many small instruments called Tiple Requinto. These usually have 3 or 4 strings. See Tiple (Puerto Rico).

===Colombian tiple requinto===
The Colombian Requinto Tiple (or Tiple Colombiano Requinto) is smaller than a standard Tiple Colombiano, and is sometimes shaped more like a violin or Puerto Rican cuatro, or sometimes like a small guitar (smaller than the standard Tiple). It also has 12 strings and is also triple-strung, but the higher pitch means that all of the strings in the courses are tuned to unison. It is tuned D4 D4 D4, G4 G4 G4, B4 B4 B4, E4 E4 E4.

===Guitarro or guitarrico aragonés===
The Guitarro aragonés, from Aragón, Spain, looks like a small guitar. It has 4 or 5 strings and is usually tuned A-D-G-C-E-A . The 4 string is also usually tuned E-C#-A–D

===Requinto jarocho===
The requinto jarocho or guitarra de son is a plucked string instrument, played usually with a special pick. It is a four- or five-stringed instrument that has originated from Veracruz, Mexico.

The &quot;requinto&quot; is used in conjunto jarocho ensembles. In the absence of the &quot;arpa&quot;, the requinto typically introduces the melodic theme of the &quot;son&quot; and then continues by providing a largely improvised counterpoint to the vocal line. See Requinto jarocho.

==Small drum==
The &quot;requinto&quot; drum is used in the Puerto Rican folk genre &quot;plena&quot;, wherein it is a small conical hand drum that improvises over the other drum rhythms.

<text>David Patillo White (1828–1903) was a shape note singing teacher, composer, and a co-issuer, with his father, of the 1870 Sacred Harp. He was the second child of Benjamin Franklin White and Thurza Melvina Golightly, whose other children were William Decatur, Robert H., Mary Caroline, Nancy Ogburn, Thurza Melvina, Benjamin Franklin, Jr., James Landrum, and Martha America.

David Patillo White was born in October, 1828, in South Carolina, and moved with his family to Harris County, Georgia in 1842. In 1844, B. F. White and Elisha J. King published &quot;The Sacred Harp&quot;, using the four-shape shape note system of notation.

David Patillo White married Celeste V. Brown, the daughter of Reuben E. and Elizabeth Brown, in Barbour County, Alabama on December 16, 1852. They had ten children, including John T., Omer, Alice, Ella, James, Lena, Lula, Thomas L. and Minnie). The family lived in Henry County, Alabama (1860 Census), before moving to Polk County, Texas (1870 Census), and later to Cherokee County, Texas (1880 Census).

David Patillo White was a music teacher, teaching singing schools in &quot;The Sacred Harp&quot;. He is so listed in the 1850 Harris County, Georgia census, but afterwards lists his primary occupation as farmer. He composed five songs that appeared in the 1850 edition of the &quot;Sacred Harp&quot;, including &quot;Columbiana&quot; and &quot;Norwich&quot;. &quot;Song to the Lamb&quot; was added in 1869. The fourth edition of &quot;The Sacred Harp&quot; was prepared in 1869 by B. F. White and a committee selected by the Southern Musical Convention. It bears an 1869 introduction and an 1870 copyright by B. F. White and D. P. White, clarifying ownership by the White family rather than the Convention.

D. P.&#x27;s primary occupation was that of a farmer, but he was active in both music and public service in Texas, serving as President of the &quot;Central Texas Musical Convention&quot;, music teacher, notary public, and justice of the peace. D. P. White died October 23, 1903, and is buried in an unknown location, probably in Cherokee County. His wife Celeste died in 1904. David and Celeste White were members of Mt. Selman Baptist Church (org. 1890) in Cherokee County at their times of death.
