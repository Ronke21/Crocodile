<text>In Greek mythology, Phaon (Ancient Greek: Φάων; &quot;gen&quot;.: Φάωνος) was a mythical boatman of Mytilene in Lesbos. He was old and ugly when Aphrodite came to his boat. She put on the guise of a crone. Phaon ferried her over to Asia Minor and accepted no payment for doing so. In return, she gave him a box of ointment. When he rubbed it on himself, he became young and beautiful. Many were captivated by his beauty.

According to Athenian Theater, Sappho fell in love with him. He lay with her but soon grew to resent her and devalue her. Sappho was so distraught with his rejection that she threw herself into the sea under the superstition that she would be either cured of her love, or drowned. She was drowned. Aelian says that Phaon was killed by a man whom he was cuckolding.

Aside from Aelian, Phaon&#x27;s story is told by Ovid and Lucian. He is also mentioned by Plautus in &quot;Miles Gloriosus&quot; as being one of only two men in the whole world, who &quot;ever had the luck to be so passionately loved by a woman&quot; (Act 3).

<text>Peter Behrens (14 April 1868 – 27 February 1940) was a leading German architect, graphic and industrial designer, best known for his early pioneering AEG Turbine Hall in Berlin in 1909. He had a long career, designing objects, typefaces, and important buildings in a range of styles from the 1900s to the 1930s. He was a founding member of the German Werkbund in 1907, when he also began designing for AEG, pioneered corporate design, graphic design, producing typefaces, objects, and buildings for the company. In the next few years, he became a successful architect, a leader of the rationalist / classical German Reform Movement of the 1910s. After WW1 he turned to Brick Expressionism, designing the remarkable Hoechst Administration Building outside Frankfurt, and from the mid-1920s increasingly to New Objectivity. He was also an educator, heading the architecture school at Academy of Fine Arts Vienna from 1922 to 1936. As a well known architect he produced design across Germany, in other European countries, Russia and England. Several of the leading names of European modernism worked for him when they were starting out in the 1910s, including Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Le Corbusier and Walter Gropius.

==Biography==


Behrens attended the Christianeum Hamburg from September 1877 until Easter 1882. He studied painting in his native Hamburg, as well as in Düsseldorf and Karlsruhe, from 1886 to 1889. In 1890, he married Lilly Kramer and moved to Munich. At first, he worked as a painter, illustrator and bookbinder in an artisanal fashion. He frequented the bohemian circles and was interested in subjects related to the reform of lifestyles. In 1899 Behrens accepted the invitation of the Grand Duke Ernst-Ludwig of Hesse to be the second member of his recently inaugurated Darmstadt Artists&#x27; Colony, where Behrens built his own Jugendstil style house in 1901, and fully conceived everything, from furniture to towels, paintings, pottery, etc. The building of this house is considered to be the turning point in his life, when he left the artistic circles of Munich and showed himself to be a talented architect in his very first project.

In 1903, Behrens was named director of the Kunstgewerbeschule in Düsseldorf, where he implemented successful reforms, developing new ways of teaching design. In 1907, Behrens and ten other people (Hermann Muthesius, Theodor Fischer, Josef Hoffmann, Joseph Maria Olbrich, Bruno Paul, Richard Riemerschmid, Fritz Schumacher, among others), plus twelve companies, gathered to create the German Werkbund. As an organization, it was clearly indebted to the principles and priorities of the Arts and Crafts movement, but tending towards the classical in architecture. Members of the Werkbund were focused on improving the overall level of taste in Germany by improving the design of everyday objects and products. This very practical aspect made it an extremely influential organization among industrialists, public policy experts, designers, investors, critics and academics. His work in the early 1900s included a series of exhibition halls and pavilions, a crematorium and some private houses, which show a new direction immediately after his own Jugendstil house, towards exploring simple, rectilinear volumes and classical sources.

In 1907, AEG (&quot;Allgemeine Elektrizitäts-Gesellschaft&quot;) retained Behrens as artistic consultant, and his work for AEG was the first large-scale demonstration of the viability and vitality of the Werkbund&#x27;s initiatives and objectives. He designed the entire corporate identity (logotype, product design, publicity, etc.) and for that he is considered the first industrial designer in history. He also designed a series of factory buildings for them at their two Berlin factory sites, most famously the 1909 AEG Turbine Factory, at the Moabit site, considered an early example of Modernism. He then went on to design four new buildings at the Humboldthain site, which showed that he was as much interested in massive, bold, classical and picturesque effects depending on the context, as expressing modernity. Since Peter Behrens was a consultant rather than an employee of AEG, he was free to work on other projects, and developed a highly successful architectural practice. In this period his growing office had many students and assistants, some who would go on become leading Modernists, including Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Le Corbusier, Adolf Meyer, Jean Kramer and Walter Gropius (later to become the first director of the Bauhaus).

Immediately after the AEG Turbine Hall, he designed a series of large office buildings in a bold monumental stripped classical form, part of the German Reform Architecture movement. His 1912 German Embassy in St Petersburg, and the Administration Building for Continental AG in Hannover, built 1912–1914 are good examples of this period.

After WW1 his work changed again, and like many German architects, he explored the themes and styles of Brick Expressionism. Between 1920 and 1924, he was responsible for the design and construction of the Technical Administration Building of Hoechst AG in Höchst, outside Frankfurt. With its soaring atrium clad in coloured bricks representing the factory&#x27;s dye products, and an exterior in dark clinker bricks with clocktower and dramatic arch, it is one of the most representative examples of the style in Germany.
In 1922, he accepted an invitation to teach at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna, becoming head of the architecture school, a post he kept until 1936, whilst also designing for a range of clients across Europe.

In 1926, Behrens was commissioned by the Englishman Wenman Joseph Bassett-Lowke to design a family home in Northampton, UK. The house named &#x27;New Ways&#x27;, a stark white walled rectangular volume (with jagged parapets), is often regarded as probably the first modernist house in Britain, and marks Behrens&#x27; turn towards the Modernism of New Objectivity.

In 1925 he was invited by his former student Mies van der Rohe, along with many of the leading German architects working in the new style, to design a residential building in Stuttgart, in the development now known as the Weissenhof. His contribution was a set of apartments in stacked cubic volumes, allowing many apartments to open to large terraces.

In 1928 Behrens won an international competition for the construction of the New Synagogue, in Zilina, Slovakia, which was restored in 2012–17 as a cultural centre. The same year he designed a renovation of the Feller-Stern department store in central Zagreb, Croatia, transforming it from Art Nouveau to a complex almost De Stijl Modernist composition. His 1931 hillside villa for the Clara Gans, daughter of Frankfurt industrialist Adolf Gans, was a similarly complex interplay of rectangular volumes, clad in stone, a fine example of New Objectivity.

In 1929, Behrens was invited to the competition for the design of buildings around a proposed radical redesign of Alexanderplatz in Berlin, and though he came second, his designs for the buildings on the south west side of the new square was preferred by the subsequent developer, and the Alexanderhaus and the Berolinahaus were built by 1932.

In 1929, Behrens, in partnership with former student Alexander Popp, was commissioned to design a new factory for the state-run Austria Tabak in Linz, which was built over a long period, due to the economic conditions, finally completed in 1935. The main building has a very long completely horizontal slightly curved facade, Behrens&#x27; most striking design in the style of New Objectivity.

In 1936 Behrens left Vienna to teach architecture at the Prussian Academy of Arts (now the &quot;Akademie der Künste&quot;) in Berlin, reportedly with the specific approval of Hitler. Behrens participated in Hitler&#x27;s plans for the rebuilding of Berlin with the commission for the new headquarters of the AEG on Albert Speer&#x27;s famous planned north–south axis. Speer reported that his selection of Behrens for this commission was rejected by the powerful Alfred Rosenberg, but that his decision was supported by Hitler who admired Behrens&#x27;s Saint Petersburg Embassy. Behrens died in the Hotel Bristol in Berlin on 27 February 1940, while seeking refuge there from his country estate.

<text>441 Tactical Fighter Squadron was a unit of the Canadian Forces. It was originally formed as a unit of the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) during the Second World War. The squadron operated the McDonnell Douglas CF-18 Hornet fighter jet from CFB Cold Lake in Alberta, Canada. It was deactivated in 2006.

==History==

No. 125 (Fighter) Squadron was formed on 20 April 1942 at Sydney, Nova Scotia and flew Hurricanes as part of RCAF Eastern Air Command. It was renumbered No. 441 Fighter Squadron when it transferred overseas to RAF Station Digby, Lincolnshire, England, on 8 February 1944, under the command of Squadron Leader George Hill. It was posted to airfields in England, France, and Belgium throughout the Second World War, flying the Supermarine Spitfire. When the squadron returned to England it was disbanded on 7 August 1945.

No 441 Squadron reformed at RCAF Station St. Hubert on 1 March 1951 and went to No 1 Wing, then located at RAF North Luffenham, in Rutland, England on 13 February 1952. The squadron was temporarily situated at 3 Wing Zweibrücken on 21 December 1954, before moving to their intended destination, RCAF Station Marville, France. They were deactivated (disbanded) on 1 September 1963 at Marville and then reactivated (reformed) as No 441 Strike/Attack squadron on 15 September 1963, then moved with 1 Wing to Canadian Forces Base Lahr in April 1967. In 1971 the squadron moved to CFB Baden-Soellingen and changed its name to 441 Tactical Fighter Squadron. They disbanded again in 1986 and then finally reformed at 4 Wing Cold Lake on 26 June 1986.

On 6 July 2006, No 441 Squadron was once again stood down (disbanded), and its crew amalgamating with 416 Tactical Fighter Squadron at CFB Cold Lake and re-formed as 409 Tactical Fighter Squadron. The squadron&#x27;s colours and battle honours were placed in Sydney, Nova Scotia, where it first operated.

<text>2BS is an Australian commercial radio station broadcasting to the Central Tablelands of New South Wales. Owned and operated by Broadcast Operations Group, the station broadcasts a news talk and classic hits music format with local programming presented from studios in Bathurst.

For close to fifty years, the station was operated by local proprietors Ron and Stephanie Camplin, and was previously owned by the London Times Mirror and Australian Consolidated Press. In June 2019, 2BS and its sister station B-Rock FM were sold to the Broadcast Operations Group, owned by Bill Caralis.

==History==


The station began broadcasting on 1 January 1937. Prior to that, a station owned by the Mockler Brothers, with the call sign 2MK, had existed in Bathurst, first broadcasting on 31 October 1925. 2BS was not always the intended call sign - 2BX was also considered. A station located at Meadow Lane, which was to serve both Bathurst and Lithgow, was also projected to start in 1925 with the call letters &quot;2LE&quot;. That station never eventuated.

In the 1950s, it was discovered that 2BS&#x27;s signal was interfering at night with the signal of Melbourne station 3AK. That forced 3AK to become a daytime-only station, having previously been an overnight station. The problem was fixed in the 1960s by switching to directional antennas, which led to 3AK commencing 24-hour transmission. At that time, Australian Consolidated Press (ACP) owned both stations. In 1969, ACP sold 2BS to Ron Camplin, who owned the station until mid 2019.

2BS is an adult contemporary station with a prime target audience of 25+, playing music from the 1950s onwards. Its Breakfast and Drive programs are produced locally, with other programs being networked: John Laws, John Stanley, and the Continuous Call Team from 2GB Sydney.

2BS recently opened FM repeater stations in the surrounding towns of Blayney, Oberon and Sofala.

While 2BS has been promoting itself as a rarity being one of the few remaining locally owned commercial broadcasters in Australia, however radio industry website Radioinfo sources say a sale of 2BS and BRock Bathurst was imminent in 2018. In June 2019, the Camplins sold Bathurst Broadcasters to the Bill Caralis-owned Broadcast Operations Group, which holds the license of 2EL in the adjacent radio market of Orange.

<doc id="1028493" wikidata="Q346112" url="?curid=1028493" title="Juan Mari Brás">
<text>Juan Mari Brás (December 2, 1927 – September 10, 2010) was a Puerto Rican politician who advocated for Puerto Rican independence. He also founded the Puerto Rican Socialist Party. On October 25, 2006, he became the first person to receive a Puerto Rican citizenship certificate from the Puerto Rico State Department. His son, Santiago Mari Pesquera, was assassinated by a suspected far-right activist in 1976. In 2009, documents revealed that the FBI knew of a plot to assassinate Mari Brás but did not share the information with him.

==Early years==
Juan Mari Brás was born in Mayagüez, Puerto Rico on December 2, 1927. His father, Santiago Mari Ramos, was an active participant in the independence movement who often took his son to political meetings and rallies. In 1943, when he was 18 years old, he founded a pro-independence movement called &quot;Capítulo de Agregados Pro Independencia&quot;, in his high school along with some of his friends, in Mayagüez. He was also the founder and director of the first pro-independence political radio program &quot;Gritos de la Patria&quot;.

==Student activist==
In 1944, he enrolled in the University of Puerto Rico, Río Piedras Campus and in 1946 became a founding member of Gilberto Concepción de Gracia&#x27;s Puerto Rican Independence Party. He also was a founding member of the Beta chapter of the Phi Delta Gamma fraternity. Mari Brás became the president of the party&#x27;s &quot;Puerto Rican Independentista Youth&quot;. In 1948, the university&#x27;s pro-independence student body invited nationalist leader Pedro Albizu Campos to the Río Piedras campus as a guest speaker. The chancellor of the university, Jaime Benítez, did not permit Albizu access to the campus. As a consequence, the students protested and went on strike. Mari Brás was one of the student leaders who chanted anti-American slogans and who marched with a Puerto Rican flag in his hand. Both of these acts were considered as acts against the Government of the United States, which at that time had complete control of the government of the island. Mari Brás and others who protested were expelled from the university; he was arrested, jailed, and let go three times in response to his revolutionary activities.

Mari Brás was forced to move to Lakeland, Florida, where he earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree at Florida Southern College between 1949 and 1950. From 1951 until 1954 he lived in Washington, DC where he studied at Georgetown University, during this period he and his wife at the time, Paquita Pesquera Cantellops, had their first child: Santiago Mari Pesquera (born in 1952). In 1954, he went to study law and political science at George Washington University Law School but was expelled for being a suspected communist thanks to his involvement with the Puerto Rican independence movement. He finally obtained his law degree from American University. During this time he also worked as a research assistant at the Brookings Institution.

==Political career==

===Pro-Independence Movement===

On January 11, 1959, Mari Brás founded the Pro-Independence Movement, which grouped Puerto Rican independence followers who supported the Socialist philosophy. Along with César Andreu Iglesias he founded the political newspaper &quot;Claridad&quot;, which he directed for three decades. On November 28, 1971, at the Pro-Independence Movement&#x27;s eighth general assembly, the Pro-Independence Movement officially became the Puerto Rican Socialist Party (PSP). A political organization with Marxist-Leninist and nationalist leanings influenced by the Cuban Revolution. In 1973, he spoke before the United Nations about Puerto Rico being a colony of the United States and demanded the decolonization of the island. On March 24, 1976, the eldest of Mari Brás&#x27; children, Santiago Mari Pesquera, was murdered while his father was preparing for a gubernatorial run on the Socialist Party ticket. Police investigations have hinted that Mari Pesquera was assassinated in reprisal for his father&#x27;s political activism. The murder has never been officially solved. In 2009, thanks to the Freedom of Information Act documents were obtained by news stations, Primera Hora, that showed the FBI knew of a plan to assassinate Juan Marí Pesquera, and had not warned him. (They had known for two months and it was Mari Brás&#x27; son who was assassinated, in the end.)

After losing his son and the election, Mari Bras continued to dedicate his time to campaigning for the independence of Puerto Rico. He was a prolific writer as well as a speaker before various audiences on the issue of the political status of Puerto Rico. Along with being a founding member of the Puerto Rican Socialist Party, he also was a co-founder of the Puerto Rican Independence Party in 1946. After the demise of the Puerto Rican Socialist Party, he and other former party leaders founded the Hostosian National Independence Movement in an attempt to unify the various factions vying for Puerto Rican independence. Professionally he performed as a law professor at the Eugenio María de Hostos School of Law in Puerto Rico.

===U.S. citizenship renunciation===
On July 11, 1994, Mari Brás renounced his United States citizenship at the U.S. Embassy in Caracas, Venezuela. &quot;He did this to test a technicality in United States citizenship laws.&quot;, according to writer Mary Hilaire Tavenner Brás believed that a person holding United States citizenship and who subsequently renounces his citizenship would be deported to his country of origin. As Puerto Rico is a territory of the United States, Brás theorized the U.S. Department of State would have to deport him or any Puerto Rican who renounced his or her U.S. citizenship to Puerto Rico. The U.S. State Department approved Mari Brás&#x27; renunciation of his U.S. citizenship on November 22, 1995.

On 15 May 1996, Miriam J. Ramírez de Ferrer, a pro-statehood attorney, presented a formal complaint against Mari Brás before the Mayaguez Electoral Board, where Mari Brás was registered to vote, so he could not vote as he was not a U.S. citizen. It was denied because the Board had no jurisdiction. Upon appeal by Ramírez, the Puerto Rico Electoral Board subsequently supported the decision of the Mayaguez Board. Ramírez subsequently took the matter to the Puerto Rico Superior Court (Tribunal de Primera Instancia, Sala Superior de San Juan). As a result, the Superior Court declared unconstitutional Articles 2.003 y 2.023 of Puerto Rico&#x27;s Electoral Law as they required U.S. citizenship as a condition to vote in Puerto Rico&#x27;s elections. On November 18, 1997, Ramírez then took Mari Brás before the Puerto Rico Supreme Court alleging that if he had renounced his United States citizenship, then he also had renounced his right to vote in the local Puerto Rican elections. The Puerto Rican Supreme Court sided with Mari Brás, finding that &quot;as a citizen of Puerto Rico&quot; Mari Brás was eligible to vote.

In &quot;Lozada Colón v. U.S. Department of State&quot; (1998), the plaintiff was a United States citizen, born in Puerto Rico and resident of Puerto Rico, who executed an oath of renunciation before a consular officer at the U.S. Embassy in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. On April 23, 1998, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia held that the case was about &quot;the much debated political question as to the status of Puerto Rico and its nationals in relation to the United States.&quot; It added that &quot;While Plaintiff may well have strong political views with regard to Puerto Rican independence and the need for a citizenship separate and apart from the United States, this is not an issue for this Court to decide&quot;, and concluded that &quot;the Plaintiff must seek another, more appropriate forum to express his political views.&quot; These actions and rulings continue to be a popular subject of debate.

In rejecting the renunciation, the Department noted that the Plaintiff in &quot;Colón&quot; demonstrated no intention of renouncing all ties to the United States, i.e., claiming to reject his United States citizenship, but nevertheless wishing to remain a resident of Puerto Rico. The Plaintiff&#x27;s response was to claim a fundamental distinction between United States and Puerto Rican citizenship. The United States Department of State position asserted that renunciation of U.S. citizenship must entail renunciation of Puerto Rican citizenship as well. The court does decide to not enter to the merits of the citizenship issue; however the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia rejected Colón&#x27;s petition for a writ of mandamus directing the Secretary of State to approve a Certificate of Loss of Nationality in the case because the plaintiff wanted to retain one of the primary benefits of U.S. citizenship while claiming he was not a U.S. citizen. The Court described the plaintiff as a person, &quot;claiming to renounce all rights and privileges of United States citizenship, [while] Plaintiff wants to continue to exercise one of the fundamental rights of citizenship, namely to travel freely throughout the world and when he wants to, return and reside in the United States.&quot; The court based this decision on the Immigration and Nationality Act section 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(38), which defines the term &quot;United States&quot;, and evince that Puerto Rico is a part of the United States for such purposes.

In light of the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision, on June 4, 1998, the U.S. State Department reversed its November 22, 1995 decision and declared that Mari Brás was still a U.S. citizen. The U.S. State Department argued that as Mari Brás had continued living in a U.S. territory, he was still a U.S. citizen. According to the State Department, U.S. Immigration and Naturalization law stipulates that anyone who wants to give up their U.S. citizenship must live in another country.

Based on the federal court ruling in &quot;Colón v. U.S. Department of State&quot; (1998), years after the U.S. State Department accepted his renunciation, Juan Mari Brás was notified on June 4, 1998, by the U.S. Department of State, that they were rescinding their acceptance, and refused to accept Mari Brás&#x27;s renunciation, determining he could not renounce his United States citizenship as he did not request another national citizenship, and he was born and remains living and working in Puerto Rico. &quot;Colón vs. U.S. Department of State&quot; became a landmark case and is posted on the U.S. State Department&#x27;s webpage.

===Puerto Rican citizenship===

After renouncing his U.S. citizenship and over 10 years of litigation arguing he was a citizen of Puerto Rico, Mari Brás received the first certificate of Puerto Rican citizenship from the Puerto Rico Department of State. He stated &quot;I freed myself from the indignity of a false citizenship ... that of the country that invaded mine, which continues to keep the only country that I owe allegiance to as a colony.&quot;

The Supreme Court of Puerto Rico and the Puerto Rico Secretary of Justice determined that Puerto Rican citizenship exists and was recognized in the Constitution of Puerto Rico. Since the summer of 2007, the Puerto Rico State Department has developed the protocol to grant Puerto Rican citizenship to Puerto Ricans. Former Puerto Rico Supreme Court Associate Justice and former Secretary of State Baltasar Corrada questioned the legality of the certification, citing a law passed in 1997, authored by Kenneth McClintock Hernández, which establishes United States citizenship and nationality as a prerequisite for Puerto Rican citizenship. Mari Bras&#x27; efforts generated vigorous public debate regarding the citizenship issue.

Mari Brás is not the only Puerto Rican citizen to renounce his U.S. citizenship. Since Mari Brás&#x27; application, a number of other Puerto Rican citizens have also presented the required application papers before U.S. authorities to renounce their U.S. citizenship. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;many other independentistas&quot; followed in Mari Brás&#x27;s footsteps and renounced their U.S. citizenship as well. The New York City-based &quot;El Diario-La Prensa&quot; reported in its April 30, 1998 edition that &quot;thirteen more pro-independence Puerto Ricans had renounced their citizenship at the U.S. embassy in the Dominican Republic on April 27 [1998]&quot;.

==Later years==
Later in his life, Juan Mari Brás retired from active politics and no longer acted as president of the defunct Puerto Rican Socialist Party. He did continue to make appearances at pro-independence activities and continued to teach law at the Eugenio María de Hostos School of Law which he cofounded in his native Mayagüez over a decade ago. He dedicated his later years to seeking unity among the varied pro-independence factions in Puerto Rico and appeared before the United Nations on the political status issue.

On December 10, 2008, he was recognized by the Puerto Rico chapter of the American Association of Jurists with the award of &quot;Jurista del Año&quot; (&quot;Jurist of the Year&quot;).

==Death and legacy==
Mari Brás died in San Juan on September 10, 2010. He suffered lung cancer and had a fall in his house. After hearing of Mari Brás&#x27;s death the mayor of the city of Mayagüez, José Guillermo Rodríguez, decreed five days of mourning and ordered that flags in all municipal building be flown at half mast. Mayor Rodríguez also announced that the city of Mayagüez would be collaborating with the Hostos School of Law in the funeral arrangements. Following Mass at the Catedral Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria, Mari Brás was laid to rest at Cementerio Municipal de Mayagüez.

After the congresswomen, Nydia Velázquez and Alexandria Ocasio Cortés, asked the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), to declassify the existing documentation in the case of the murder of this son Mari Pesquera, the Senate of Puerto Rico, approved a resolution in this process in February 2025, after the Senate of Puerto Rico, must subsequently, send an English copy of the resolution to the White House, the United States Congress, the United States Department of Justice, the FBI, the CIA and the Department of Justice.

<doc id="1028498" wikidata="Q817310" url="?curid=1028498" title="Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo">
<text>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a disorder arising from a problem in the inner ear. Symptoms are repeated, brief periods of vertigo with movement, characterized by a spinning sensation upon changes in the position of the head. This can occur with turning in bed or changing position. Each episode of vertigo typically lasts less than one minute. Nausea is commonly associated. BPPV is one of the most common causes of vertigo.
BPPV is a type of balance disorder along with labyrinthitis and Ménière&#x27;s disease. It can result from a head injury or simply occur among those who are older. Often, a specific cause is not identified. When found, the underlying mechanism typically involves a small calcified otolith moving around loose in the inner ear. Diagnosis is typically made when the Dix–Hallpike test results in nystagmus (a specific movement pattern of the eyes) and other possible causes have been ruled out. In typical cases, medical imaging is not needed.
BPPV is easily treated with a number of simple movements such as the Epley maneuver or Half Somersault Maneuver (in case of diagonal/rotational nystagmus), the Lempert maneuver (in case of horizontal nystagmus), the deep head hanging maneuver (in case of vertical nystagmus) or the Brandt–Daroff exercises. Medications, including antihistamines such as meclizine, may be used to help with nausea. There is tentative evidence that betahistine may help with vertigo, but its use is not generally needed. BPPV is not a serious medical condition, but may present serious risks of injury through falling or other spatial disorientation-induced accidents.

When untreated, it might resolve in days to months; however, it may recur in some people. One can needlessly suffer from BPPV for years despite there being a simple and very effective cure. Short-term self-resolution of BPPV is unlikely because the effective cure maneuvers induce strong vertigo which the patient will naturally resist and not accidentally perform.
The first medical description of the condition occurred in 1921 by Róbert Bárány. Approximately 2.4% of people are affected at some point in time. Among those who live until their 80s, 10% have been affected. BPPV affects females twice as often as males. Onset is typically in people between the ages of 50 and 70.
==Signs and symptoms==

According to the Barany Society&#x27;s International Classification of Vestibular Disorders (ICVD), the diagnostic criteria for BPPV include

* Recurrent attacks of positional vertigo or dizziness provoked by changes in position.
* Characteristic positional nystagmus elicited by each maneuver, according to the subtype and affected ear.

Many people will report a history of vertigo as a result of fast head movements. Many are also capable of describing the exact head movements that provoke their vertigo. Purely horizontal nystagmus and symptoms of vertigo lasting more than one minute can also indicate BPPV occurring in the horizontal semicircular canal.

The spinning sensation experienced from BPPV is usually triggered by movement of the head, will have a sudden onset, and can last anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes. The most common movements people report triggering a spinning sensation are tilting their heads upward in order to look at something and when rolling over in bed.

People with BPPV do not experience other neurological deficits such as numbness or weakness. If those symptoms are present, a more serious etiology, such as posterior circulation stroke or ischemia, must be considered.

The most significant symptom is nystagmus as it is essential to determine the kind of nystagmus ( horizontal, vertical, or diagonal ) to select the correct cure maneuver.

==Cause==
Within the labyrinth of the inner ear lie collections of calcium crystals known as otoconia or otoliths. In people with BPPV, the otoconia are dislodged from their usual position within the utricle, and over time, migrate into one of the three semicircular canals (the posterior canal is most commonly affected due to its anatomical position). When the head is reoriented relative to gravity, the gravity-dependent movement of the heavier otoconial debris (colloquially &quot;ear rocks&quot;) within the affected semicircular canal causes abnormal (pathological) endolymph fluid displacement and a resultant sensation of vertigo. This more common condition is known as &quot;canalithiasis&quot;. There is a direct link between the kind of nystagmus and which of the three semicircular canals is affected. With horizontal nystagmus (left-right eye movement) the horizontal (also called lateral) canal is affected, with vertical nystagmus (up-down eye movement) the superior (also called anterior) canal is affected, and with diagonal nystagmus (diagonal or rotational eye movement) the posterior canal is affected. Diagonal eye movement is easily confused with horizontal movement. This is important since it might result in selecting a wrong and thus ineffective cure maneuver.

In rare cases, the crystals themselves can adhere to a semicircular canal cupula, rendering it heavier than the surrounding endolymph. Upon reorientation of the head relative to gravity, the cupula is weighted down by the dense particles, thereby inducing an immediate and sustained excitation of semicircular canal afferent nerves. This condition is termed &quot;cupulolithiasis&quot;.

There is evidence in the dental literature that malleting of an osteotome during closed sinus floor elevation, otherwise known as &quot;osteotome sinus elevation&quot; or &quot;lift&quot;, transmits percussive and vibratory forces capable of detaching otoliths from their normal location and thereby leading to the symptoms of BPPV.

BPPV can be triggered by any action that stimulates the posterior semi-circular canal including:
* Looking up or down
* Following head injury
* Sudden head movement
* Rolling over in bed
* Tilting the head

BPPV may be made worse by any number of modifiers which may vary among individuals:
* Changes in barometric pressure – people may feel increased symptoms up to two days before rain or snow
* Lack of sleep (required amounts of sleep may vary widely)
* Stress

An episode of BPPV may be triggered by dehydration, such as that caused by diarrhea.

BPPV is one of the most common vestibular disorders in people presenting with dizziness; a migraine is implicated in idiopathic cases. Proposed mechanisms linking the two are genetic factors and vascular damage to the labyrinth.

Although BPPV can occur at any age, it is most often seen in people older than the age of 60. Besides aging, there are no major risk factors known for BPPV, although previous episodes of head trauma, preexisting disorders, or the inner ear infection labyrinthitis, may predispose to the future development of BPPV.

== Mechanism ==
The inside of the ear is composed of an organ called the vestibular labyrinth. The vestibular labyrinth includes three semicircular canals, which contain fluids and fine hairlike sensors that act as a monitor to the rotations of the head. Other important structures in the inner ear includes the otolith organs, the utricle and saccule, that contain calcium carbonate crystals(otoconia) that are sensitive to gravity.

The crystals may dislodge from the utricle (an otolith organ) and settle within the semicircular canals. When there is motion, the displaced otoconia shift within the endolymph of semicircular canals, causing an unbalanced (with respect to the opposite ear) stimulus, causing symptoms of BPPV.

==Diagnosis==
The condition is diagnosed by the person&#x27;s history, and by performing the Dix–Hallpike test or the roll test, or both. The patient can also be asked to induce vertigo by performing a movement that the patient knows to induce vertigo. The eyes of the patient can then easily be observed for which kind (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) of nystagmus is present, to determine which semicircular canal (horizontal, superior, or posterior) is affected.

The Dix–Hallpike test is a common test performed by examiners to determine whether the posterior semicircular canal is involved. It involves a reorientation of the head to align the posterior semicircular canal (at its entrance to the ampulla) with the direction of gravity. This test will reproduce vertigo and nystagmus characteristic of posterior canal BPPV.

When performing the Dix–Hallpike test, people are lowered quickly to a supine position, with the neck extended by the person performing the maneuver. For some people, this maneuver may not be indicated, and a modification may be needed that also targets the posterior semicircular canal. Such people include those who are too anxious about eliciting the uncomfortable symptoms of vertigo, and those who may not have the range of motion necessary to comfortably be in a supine position. The modification involves the person moving from a seated position to side-lying &quot;without&quot; their head extending off the examination table, such as with Dix–Hallpike. The head is rotated 45 degrees away from the side being tested, and the eyes are examined for nystagmus. A positive test is indicated by the patient report of a reproduction of vertigo and clinician observation of nystagmus. Both the Dix–Hallpike and the side-lying testing position have yielded similar results, and as such the side-lying position can be used if the Dix–Hallpike cannot be performed easily.

The roll test can determine whether the horizontal semicircular canal is involved. The roll test requires the person to be in a supine position with their head in 30° of cervical flexion. Then the examiner quickly rotates the head 90° to the left side, and checks for vertigo and nystagmus. This is followed by gently bringing the head back to the starting position. The examiner then quickly rotates the head 90° to the right side and checks again for vertigo and nystagmus. In this roll test, the person may experience vertigo and nystagmus on both sides, but rotating toward the affected side will trigger a more intense vertigo. Similarly, when the head is rotated toward the affected side, the nystagmus will beat toward the ground and be more intense.

As mentioned above, both the Dix–Hallpike and roll test provoke the signs and symptoms in subjects with archetypal BPPV. The signs and symptoms people with BPPV experience are typically a short-lived vertigo and observed nystagmus. In some people, although rarely, vertigo can persist for years. Assessment of BPPV is best done by a medical health professional skilled in the management of dizziness disorders, commonly a physiotherapist, audiologist, or other physician.

The nystagmus associated with BPPV has several important characteristics that differentiate it from other types of nystagmus.
* Latency of onset: there is a 5–10 second delay prior to onset of nystagmus
* Nystagmus lasts for 5–60 seconds
* Positional: the nystagmus occurs only in certain positions
* Repeated stimulation, including via Dix–Hallpike maneuvers, cause the nystagmus to fatigue or disappear temporarily
* Rotatory/torsional component is present, or (in the case of lateral canal involvement) the nystagmus beats in either a geotropic (toward the ground) or ageotropic (away from the ground) fashion
* Visual fixation suppresses nystagmus due to BPPV

Although rare, disorders of the central nervous system can sometimes present as BPPV. A practitioner should be aware that if a person whose symptoms are consistent with BPPV, but does not show improvement or resolution after undergoing different particle repositioning maneuvers — detailed in the Treatment section below — need to have a detailed neurological assessment and imaging performed to help identify the pathological condition.

=== Differential diagnosis ===
Vertigo, a distinct process sometimes confused with the broader term, dizziness, accounts for about six million clinic visits in the United States every year; between 17 and 42% of these people are eventually diagnosed with BPPV.
Other causes of vertigo include:
* Motion sickness/motion intolerance: a disjunction between visual stimulation, vestibular stimulation, and/or proprioception
* Visual exposure to nearby moving objects (examples of optokinetic stimuli include passing cars and falling snow)
* Other diseases: (labyrinthitis, Ménière&#x27;s disease, and migraine, etc.)

==Treatment==

===Repositioning maneuvers===
A number of maneuvers have been found to be effective including Canalith Repositioning Procedures (CRP) such as the Epley maneuver, the Half Somersault Maneuver (HSM), the Semont maneuver, and to a lesser degree the non-CRP Brandt–Daroff exercises. Both the Epley and the Semont maneuvers are equally effective. The HSM can have better long-term success than the Epley, is more comfortable to experience, and has less risk of causing subsequent horizontal canal BPPV (H-BPPV).

None of these maneuvers addresses the presence of the particles (otoconia); rather it changes their location. The maneuvers aim to move these particles from some locations in the inner ear that cause symptoms such as vertigo and reposition them to where they do not cause these problems. These maneuvers are easily performed at home and online resources are available to patients.

The Epley maneuver is popular because it is designed to address posterior canal BPPV (PC-BPPV), which is caused by particles in the posterior semicircular canal, the most common cause of BPPV. This might give the wrong impression that PC-BPPV is the only kind of BPPV. Misdiagnosing which semicircular canal is affected, typically by confusing horizontal and diagonal nystagmus, or simply ignoring the identification of the affected canal, and then using the wrong treatment maneuver, regularly results in no cure.

Using the appropriate maneuver for the affected canal is essential. The maneuvers may be uncomfortable for the patient as they might induce strong vertigo and the patient might then resist performing them. Though some treatments, such as the Epley, are much more uncomfortable than others, such as the HSM. If the maneuver is not uncomfortable then it is possible the wrong maneuver has been selected by a misdiagnosis of the affected semicircular canal.

All the maneuvers consist of a series of steps in which the head is held in a specific position, typically for 30 to 60 seconds until any nystagmus stops. Movement from one position to the position of the next step has to be done fluently to give the particles enough momentum to move. A position has to be held until any nystagmus has completely resided, which indicates that the particles have stopped moving, before one proceeds to the next step.

====Epley maneuver====

The Epley maneuver employs gravity to move the calcium crystal build-up from the posterior semicircular canal (resulting in diagonal nystagmus) that causes the condition. This maneuver can be performed during a clinic visit by health professionals, or taught to people to perform at home, or both. Postural restriction after the Epley maneuver increases its effect somewhat.

When practiced at home, the Epley maneuver is more effective than the Semont maneuver. An effective repositioning treatment for posterior canal BPPV is the therapist-performed Epley combined with home-practiced Epley maneuvers. Devices such as the DizzyFIX can help users conduct the Epley maneuver at home, and are available for the treatment of BPPV.

====Half Somersault Maneuver====
The Half Somersault Maneuver (HSM) is a patient-performed alternative to the Epley for posterior canal BPPV (PC-BPPV). Like the Epley, it uses gravity to move the calcium crystal build-up from the posterior semicircular canal that causes the condition. Compared to the Epley, HSM has better long-term success, with less discomfort, and less risk of causing subsequent horizontal canal BPPV (H-BPPV).

====Lempert maneuver or Roll maneuver====
For the lateral (horizontal) canal, resulting in horizontal nystagmus, the Lempert maneuver has been used for productive results. It is unusual for the lateral canal to respond to the canalith repositioning procedure used for the posterior canal BPPV. Treatment is therefore geared toward moving the canalith from the lateral canal into the vestibule.

The roll maneuver or its variations are used, and involve rolling the person 360 degrees in a series of steps to reposition the particles. This maneuver is generally performed by a trained clinician who begins seated at the head of the examination table with the person supine. There are four stages, each a minute apart, and at the third position the horizontal canal is oriented in a vertical position with the person&#x27;s neck flexed and on forearm and elbows. When all four stages are completed, the head roll test is repeated, and if negative, treatment ceases.

====Deep head hanging maneuver====
For the superior (also called anterior) semicircular canal, resulting in vertical nystagmus, the Deep head hanging maneuver is used. The patient lies on their back on a bed with their head overhanging the bed.
In the first step the head is turned as backward (hanging) as possible. In the following step, the patient remains lying but lifts their head with the chin close to the chest. In the last step, the patient sits upright with the head in the normal position. Before going to the next step, one has to wait until the nystagmus fully resides ( typical 30 to 60 seconds ) and progression from one step to the next has to happen in a fluid movement.

====Semont maneuver====
The Semont maneuver has a cure rate of 90.3%. It is performed as follows:
# The person is seated on a treatment table with their legs hanging off the side of the table. The therapist then turns the person&#x27;s head 45 degrees toward the unaffected side.
# The therapist then quickly tilts the person so they are lying on the affected side. The head position is maintained, so their head is turned up 45 degrees. This position is maintained for 3 minutes. The purpose is to allow the debris to move to the apex of the semicircular duct.
# The person is then quickly moved so they are lying on the unaffected side with their head in the same position (now facing downward 45 degrees). This position is also held for 3 minutes. The purpose of this position is to allow the debris to move toward the exit of the semicircular duct.
# Finally, the person is slowly brought back to an upright seated position. The debris should then fall into the utricle of the canal and the symptoms of vertigo should decrease or end completely.

Some people will only need one treatment, but others may need multiple treatments, depending on the severity of their BPPV. In the Semont maneuver, as with the Epley maneuver, people are able to achieve canalith repositioning by themselves.

====Brandt–Daroff exercises====
The Brandt–Daroff exercises may be prescribed by the clinician as a home treatment method, usually in conjunction with particle-repositioning maneuvers or in lieu of the particle-repositioning maneuver. The exercise is a form of habituation exercise, designed to allow the person to become accustomed to the position that causes the vertigo symptoms. The Brandt–Daroff exercises are performed in a similar fashion to the Semont maneuver; however, as the person rolls onto the unaffected side, the head is rotated toward the affected side. The exercise is typically performed 3 times a day with 5–10 repetitions each time, until symptoms of vertigo have resolved for at least 2 days.

===Medications===
Medical treatment with anti-vertigo medications may be considered in acute, severe exacerbation of BPPV, but in most cases are not indicated. These primarily include drugs of the antihistamine and anticholinergic class, such as meclizine and hyoscine butylbromide (scopolamine), respectively. The medical management of vestibular syndromes has become increasingly popular over the last decade, and numerous novel drug therapies (including existing drugs with new indications) have emerged for the treatment of vertigo/dizziness syndromes. These drugs vary considerably in their mechanisms of action, with many of them being receptor- or ion channel-specific. Among them are betahistine or dexamethasone/gentamicin for the treatment of Ménière&#x27;s disease, carbamazepine/oxcarbazepine for the treatment of paroxysmal dysarthria and ataxia in multiple sclerosis, metoprolol/topiramate or valproic acid/tricyclic antidepressant for the treatment of vestibular migraine, and 4-aminopyridine for the treatment of episodic ataxia type 2 and both downbeat and upbeat nystagmus. Calcium channel blockers such as verapamil may also be of value. These drug therapies offer symptomatic treatment, and do not affect the disease process or resolution rate. Medications may be used to suppress symptoms during the positioning maneuvers if the person&#x27;s symptoms are severe and intolerable. More dose-specific studies are required, however, in order to determine the most-effective drug(s) for both acute symptom relief and long-term remission of the condition. Supplementation with vitamin D and calcium has also be shown to help reduce recurrence of BPPV in individuals who are deficient in vitamin D. 

===Surgery===
Surgical treatments, such as a semi-circular canal occlusion, exist for severe and persistent cases that fail vestibular rehabilitation (including particle repositioning and habituation therapy). As they carry the same risks as any neurosurgical procedure, they are reserved as last resorts.

<doc id="1028508" wikidata="Q7710433" url="?curid=1028508" title="Thank God I'm a Country Boy">
<text>&quot;Thank God I&#x27;m a Country Boy&quot;, also known as &quot;Country Boy&quot;, is a song written by John Martin Sommers and recorded by American singer/songwriter John Denver. The song was originally included on Denver&#x27;s 1974 album &quot;Back Home Again&quot;. A version recorded live on August 26, 1974, at the Universal Amphitheatre in Los Angeles was included on his 1975 album &quot;An Evening with John Denver&quot;. The live version was released as a single and went to No. 1 on both the &quot;Billboard magazine&quot; Hot Country Singles and &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 charts. The song topped both charts for one week each, first the country chart (on May 31), and the Hot 100 chart a week later. &quot;Thank God I&#x27;m a Country Boy&quot; also became the name of a variety special show hosted by Denver in 1977.

&quot;Thank God I&#x27;m a Country Boy&quot; was one of six songs released in 1975 that topped both the Billboard Hot 100 and &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Singles charts. Denver&#x27;s two-sided hit &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry&quot;/&quot;Calypso&quot; also received that distinction.

==Background==
The song was written by John Martin Sommers, a guitar/banjo/fiddle/mandolin player in Denver&#x27;s backup band, on December 31, 1973 (coincidentally Denver&#x27;s thirtieth birthday) when he was driving from his home in Aspen, Colorado to Los Angeles.

==Content==
Sommers recalls that at the time he was feeling “peaceful, happy and content” with his lot in life, and started scribbling some notes about his blissful state along the way. They served as the inspiration for the song.

==Structure==

The song is in cut (2/2) time that is typical of two-step. Both the verse and chorus comprise eight measures with 3/2 added between the first four measures and last three measures. Emotionally, this creates an intended slight stall. The instrumental breaks in the song incorporate a violin playing the old fiddle tune Sally Goodin, which is also referenced in the song&#x27;s lyrics: &quot;I&#x27;d play Sally Goodin all day if I could...&quot;

<doc id="1028511" wikidata="Q705473" url="?curid=1028511" title="Take Me Home, Country Roads">
<text>&quot;Take Me Home, Country Roads&quot;, also known simply as &quot;Country Roads&quot;, is a song written by Bill Danoff, Taffy Nivert and John Denver. It was released as a single performed by Denver on April 12, 1971, peaking at number two on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s US Hot 100 singles for the week ending August 28, 1971. The song was a success on its initial release and was certified Gold by the RIAA on August 18, 1971, and Platinum on April 10, 2017. The song became one of John Denver&#x27;s most popular songs. It has continued to sell, with over 1.8 million digital copies sold in the United States.

In 1998, the 1971 recording by John Denver was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

The song is considered a symbol of West Virginia. In March 2014, it became one of the four official state anthems of West Virginia.

In 2023, the song was selected by the Library of Congress for inclusion in the National Recording Registry.

==Composition==
Inspiration for the title line had come while Taffy Nivert and Bill Danoff, who were married, were driving along Clopper Road in Montgomery County, Maryland, to a gathering of Nivert&#x27;s family in Gaithersburg, with Nivert behind the wheel while Danoff played his guitar. &quot;I just started thinking, country roads, I started thinking of me growing up in western New England and going on all these small roads&quot;, Danoff said. &quot;It didn&#x27;t have anything to do with Maryland or anyplace.&quot;

To Danoff, the lyric &quot;[t]he radio reminds me of my home far away&quot; in the bridge is quintessentially West Virginian, an allusion to when he listened to the program &quot;Saturday Night Jamboree&quot;, broadcast from Wheeling, West Virginia, on WWVA at his home in Springfield, Massachusetts, during his childhood in the 1950s.

Danoff was influenced by friend and West Virginian actor Chris Sarandon and members of a West Virginia commune who attended Danoff&#x27;s performances. Of the commune members, Danoff remarked, &quot;They brought their dogs and were a very colorful group of folks, but that is how West Virginia began creeping into the song.&quot; While the song was inspired by Danoff&#x27;s upbringing in Springfield, Massachusetts, he &quot;didn&#x27;t want to write about Massachusetts because [he] didn&#x27;t think the word was musical.&quot;

Starting December 22, 1970, Denver was heading the New Year&#x27;s bill at The Cellar Door in Washington, D.C., with Fat City opening for him, just as Denver had opened at the same club for then-headliner David Steinberg. After the club&#x27;s post-Christmas reopening night on Tuesday, December 29 (Cellar Door engagements ran from Tuesday to Sunday, and this booking was for two weeks), the three returned to the couple&#x27;s apartment for an impromptu jam. On the way, Denver&#x27;s left thumb was broken in a collision. He was rushed to the emergency room, where the thumb was splinted. When they returned to the apartment, Denver said he was &quot;wired, you know.&quot;

When Danoff and Nivert ran through what they had of the song they had been working on for about a month, planning to sell to Johnny Cash, Denver decided he had to have it, which prompted them to abandon plans for the sale. The verses and chorus were still missing a bridge, so the three of them went about finishing.

Nivert got out an encyclopedia to learn more about West Virginia. The first thing she encountered was the rhododendron, the state flower, so she kept trying to work the word Rhododendron into the song. &quot;Rhododendron&quot; was the title that Nivert had written down on the lyric sheet, which they later sent to ASCAP. The three stayed up until 6:00 a.m., changing words and moving lines around.

When they finished, on the morning of Wednesday, December 30, 1970, Denver announced that the song had to go on his next album. Later that night, during Denver&#x27;s first set, Denver called his two collaborators back to the spotlight, where the trio changed their career trajectories, reading the lyrics from a single, handheld, unfolded piece of paper. According to Len Jaffe, a Washington, D.C.-based singer-songwriter who attended the show where Denver premiered the song, this resulted in a five-minute standing ovation. The next day was Denver&#x27;s 28th birthday. They recorded it in New York City in January 1971.

&quot;Take Me Home, Country Roads&quot; is written in the key of A major.

==Commercial performance and legacy==
&quot;Take Me Home, Country Roads&quot; appeared on the LP &quot;Poems, Prayers &amp; Promises&quot; and was released as a 45 in the spring of 1971. Original pressings credited the single to &quot;John Denver with Fat City&quot;. It broke nationally in mid-April but moved up the charts very slowly. After several weeks, RCA Records called John and told him they were giving up on the single. His response: &quot;No! Keep working on it!&quot; They did, and the single went to number 1 on the &quot;Record World&quot; Pop Singles Chart and the &quot;Cash Box&quot; Top 100, and number 2 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, topped only by &quot;How Can You Mend a Broken Heart&quot; by The Bee Gees.

On August 18, 1971, it was certified Gold by the RIAA for a million copies shipped. The song continued to sell in the digital era. As of January 2020, the song has also sold 1,800,000 downloads since it became available digitally.

Denver&#x27;s recording of &quot;Take Me Home, Country Roads&quot; was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry in 2023.

The song has since become an anthem of the Brisbane Lions, a professional Australian rules football club, and is sung by the crowd every time Lions player Charlie Cameron kicks a goal. The song was chosen by Cameron to be played in reference to his country roots.

The song was interpolated in &quot;Lonely Road&quot; by Machine Gun Kelly and Jelly Roll in 2024. It reached number 33 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart dated 10 August 2024, giving Denver his first top 40 appearance as a songwriter since the same song&#x27;s appearance in the medley &quot;Forever Country&quot; by Artists of Then, Now &amp; Forever peaked at number 21 in 2016.

==Reception in West Virginia==
&quot;Take Me Home, Country Roads&quot; received an enthusiastic response from West Virginians. On November 1, 2017, the West Virginia Tourism Office announced it had obtained the rights to use &quot;Take Me Home, Country Roads&quot; in its marketing efforts. Country Roads&#x27; has become synonymous with West Virginia all over the world&quot;, said West Virginia Tourism Commissioner Chelsea Ruby. &quot;It highlights everything we love about our state: scenic beauty, majestic mountains, a timeless way of life, and most of all, the warmth of a place that feels like home whether you&#x27;ve lived here forever or are just coming to visit.&quot; The opening phrase of the song, &quot;Almost heaven&quot;, became a primary tourism office slogan.

The song is the theme song of West Virginia University, and it has been performed during every home football pregame show since 1972. The song is also played after every home victory and fans are encouraged to stay in the stands and sing along with the team. It is also played for other athletic events and university functions. On September 6, 1980, at the invitation of West Virginia Governor Jay Rockefeller, songwriters Danoff, Nivert, and Denver performed the song during pregame festivities to a sold-out crowd of Mountaineer fans. This performance marked the dedication of the current West Virginia University Mountaineer Field and the first game for head coach Don Nehlen.

The popularity of the song inspired resolutions in the West Virginia Legislature to adopt &quot;Take Me Home, Country Roads&quot; as an official state song. On March 7, 2014, the West Virginia Legislature approved a resolution to make &quot;Take Me Home, Country Roads&quot; an official state song of West Virginia, alongside three other pieces: &quot;West Virginia Hills&quot;, &quot;This Is My West Virginia&quot;, and &quot;West Virginia, My Home Sweet Home&quot;. Governor Earl Ray Tomblin signed the resolution into law on March 8, 2014.

The song was played at the funeral for West Virginia Senator Robert Byrd at the state capitol in Charleston, West Virginia, on July 2, 2010.

<doc id="1028514" wikidata="Q5024675" url="?curid=1028514" title="Calypso (John Denver song)">
<text>&quot;Calypso&quot; is a song written by John Denver in 1975 as a tribute to Jacques-Yves Cousteau and his research ship, the &quot;Calypso.&quot; It was featured on Denver&#x27;s 1975 album &quot;Windsong.&quot;

Released as the B-side of &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry&quot;, &quot;Calypso&quot; received substantial airplay, enabling it to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. After &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry&quot; fell out of the #1 position, &quot;Calypso&quot; began receiving more airplay than &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry,&quot; thus causing &quot;Billboard&quot; to list &quot;Calypso&quot; as the new A-side, starting the week ending October 11, 1975. Hence, &quot;Calypso&quot; is itself considered a #2 hit on the Hot 100.

John Denver was a close friend of Cousteau. &quot;Calypso&quot; was the name of Cousteau&#x27;s research boat that sailed around the world promoting ocean conservation.

This song features the sounds of ship bells, which is heard in the instrumental introductions before both two verses, in which Milton Okun&#x27;s orchestral arrangement, featuring strings and winds, are heard mimicking the sounds of the oceans and seas.

==In popular culture==
A filk song exists in &quot;Star Trek&quot; fandom (and has been quoted in Chapter 8 of Diane Duane&#x27;s &quot;Star Trek&quot; novel &quot;The Wounded Sky&quot;), based on John Denver&#x27;s &quot;Calypso,&quot; but adapted to the voyages of the &quot;Enterprise:&quot; &quot;To sail on a dream in the sun-fretted darkness, to soar through the starlight unfrightened alone...&quot;

Additionally, Tom Smith wrote parody lyrics for the song, which he titled &quot;Callisto,&quot; referring to a sexual desire for Callisto, originally a villainess in the TV show &quot;&quot; and one of Xena&#x27;s enemies. After Callisto was redeemed in the Xena stories, he wrote an extra verse and a variation on the refrain that attacked her for having stopped being evil.

In the episode titled &quot;Molly&#x27;s Out of Town&quot; of &quot;Mike &amp; Molly&quot; some of the characters sing &quot;Calypso&quot; while they are on the roof of a house.

<text>De revolutionibus orbium coelestium (English translation: &quot;On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres&quot;) is the seminal work on the heliocentric theory of the astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus (1473–1543) of the Polish Renaissance. The book, first printed in 1543 in Nuremberg, Holy Roman Empire, offered an alternative model of the universe to Ptolemy&#x27;s geocentric system, which had been widely accepted since ancient times.

==History==


Copernicus initially outlined his system in a short, untitled, anonymous manuscript that he distributed to several friends, referred to as the &quot;Commentariolus&quot;. A physician&#x27;s library list dating to 1514 includes a manuscript whose description matches the &quot;Commentariolus&quot;, so Copernicus must have begun work on his new system by that time. Most historians believe that he wrote the &quot;Commentariolus&quot; after his return from Italy, possibly only after 1510. At this time, Copernicus anticipated that he could reconcile the motion of the Earth with the perceived motions of the planets easily, with fewer motions than were necessary in the version of the Ptolemaic system current at the time. Among other techniques, the heliocentric Copernican model made use of the Urdi Lemma developed in the 13th century by the Arab astronomer Mu&#x27;ayyad al-Din al-&#x27;Urdi, the first of the Maragha astronomers to develop a geocentric but non-Ptolemaic model of planetary motion.

Observations of Mercury by Bernhard Walther (1430–1504) of Nuremberg, a pupil of Regiomontanus, were made available to Copernicus by Johannes Schöner, 45 observations in total, 14 of them with longitude and latitude. Copernicus used three of them in &quot;De revolutionibus&quot;, giving only longitudes, and erroneously attributing them to Schöner. Copernicus&#x27; values differed slightly from the ones published by Schöner in 1544 in &quot;Observationes XXX annorum a I. Regiomontano et B. Walthero Norimbergae habitae, [4°, Norimb. 1544].&quot;

A manuscript of &quot;De revolutionibus&quot; in Copernicus&#x27; own hand has survived. After his death, it was given to his pupil, Rheticus, who for publication had only been given a copy without annotations. Via Heidelberg, it ended up in Prague, where it was rediscovered and studied in the 19th century. Close examination of the manuscript, including the different types of paper used, helped scholars construct an approximate timetable for its composition. Apparently Copernicus began by making a few astronomical observations to provide new data to perfect his models. He may have begun writing the book while still engaged in observations. By the 1530s a substantial part of the book was complete, but Copernicus hesitated to publish. In 1536, Cardinal Nikolaus von Schönberg wrote to Copernicus and urged him to publish his manuscript.

In 1539, Georg Joachim Rheticus, a young mathematician from Wittenberg, arrived in Frauenburg (Frombork) to study with him. Rheticus read Copernicus&#x27; manuscript and immediately wrote a non-technical summary of its main theories in the form of an open letter addressed to Schöner, his astrology teacher in Nürnberg; he published this letter as the &quot;Narratio Prima&quot; in Danzig in 1540. Rheticus&#x27; friend and mentor Achilles Gasser published a second edition of the &quot;Narratio&quot; in Basel in 1541. Due to its friendly reception, Copernicus finally agreed to publication of more of his main work—in 1542, a treatise on trigonometry, which was taken from the second book of the still unpublished &quot;De revolutionibus&quot;. Rheticus published it in Copernicus&#x27; name.

Under strong pressure from Rheticus, and having seen that the first general reception of his work had not been unfavorable, Copernicus finally agreed to give the book to his close friend, Bishop Tiedemann Giese, to be delivered to Rheticus in Wittenberg for printing by Johannes Petreius at Nürnberg (Nuremberg). It was published just before Copernicus&#x27; death, in 1543.

Copernicus kept a copy of his manuscript which, sometime after his death, was sent to Rheticus in the attempt to produce an authentic, unaltered version of the book. The plan failed but the copy was found during the 18th century and was published later. It is kept at the Jagiellonian University Library in Kraków, where it remains bearing the library number BJ 10 000.

==Contents==
From the first edition, Copernicus&#x27; book was prefixed with an anonymous preface which argues that the following is a calculus consistent with the observations, and cannot resolve philosophical truths. Only later was this revealed to be the unauthorized interjection by Lutheran preacher Andreas Osiander, who lived in Nuremberg when the first edition was printed there. This is followed by Copernicus&#x27; own preface, where he dedicates his work to Pope Paul III and appeals to the latter&#x27;s skill as a mathematician to recognize the truth of Copernicus&#x27; hypothesis.

&quot;De revolutionibus&quot; is divided into six &quot;books&quot; (sections or parts), following closely the layout of Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Almagest&quot; which it updated and replaced:
* Book I chapters 1–11 are a general vision of the heliocentric theory, and a summarized exposition of his cosmology. The world (heavens) is spherical, as is the Earth, and the land and water make a single globe. The celestial bodies, including the Earth, have regular circular and everlasting movements. The Earth rotates on its axis and around the Sun. Answers to why the ancients thought the Earth was central. The order of the planets around the Sun and their periodicity. Chapters 12–14 give theorems for chord geometry as well as a table of chords.
* Book II describes the principles of spherical astronomy as a basis for the arguments developed in the following books and gives a comprehensive catalogue of the fixed stars.
* Book III describes his work on the precession of the equinoxes and treats the apparent movements of the Sun and related phenomena.
* Book IV is a similar description of the Moon and its orbital movements.
* Book V explains how to calculate the positions of the wandering stars based on the heliocentric model and gives tables for the five planets.
* Book VI deals with the digression in latitude from the ecliptic of the five planets.

Copernicus argued that the universe comprised eight spheres. The outermost consisted of motionless, fixed stars, with the Sun motionless at the center. The known planets revolved about the Sun, each in its own sphere, in the order: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn. The Moon, however, revolved in its sphere around the Earth. What appeared to be the daily revolution of the Sun and fixed stars around the Earth was actually the Earth&#x27;s daily rotation on its own axis.

Copernicus adhered to one of the standard beliefs of his time, namely that the motions of celestial bodies must be composed of uniform circular motions. For this reason, he was unable to account for the observed apparent motion of the planets without retaining a complex system of epicycles similar to those of the Ptolemaic system.
Despite Copernicus&#x27; adherence to this aspect of ancient astronomy, his radical shift from a geocentric to a heliocentric cosmology was a serious blow to Aristotle&#x27;s science—and helped usher in the Scientific Revolution.

==&quot;Ad lectorem&quot;==
Rheticus left Nürnberg to take up his post as professor in Leipzig. Andreas Osiander had taken over the task of supervising the printing and publication. In an effort to reduce the controversial impact of the book Osiander added his own unsigned letter &quot;Ad lectorem de hypothesibus huius operis&quot; (&quot;To the reader concerning the hypotheses of this work&quot;) printed in front of Copernicus&#x27; preface which was a dedicatory letter to Pope Paul III and which kept the title &quot;Praefatio authoris&quot; (to acknowledge that the unsigned letter was not by the book&#x27;s author).
Osiander&#x27;s letter stated that Copernicus&#x27; system was mathematics intended to aid computation and not an attempt to declare literal truth:
As even Osiander&#x27;s defenders point out, the &quot;Ad lectorem&quot; &quot;expresses views on the aim and nature of scientific theories at variance with Copernicus&#x27; claims for his own theory&quot;.
Many view Osiander&#x27;s letter as a betrayal of science and Copernicus, and an attempt to pass his own thoughts off as those of the book&#x27;s author. An example of this type of claim can be seen in the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;, which states &quot;Fortunately for him [the dying Copernicus], he could not see what Osiander had done. This reformer, knowing the attitude of Luther and Melanchthon against the heliocentric system ... without adding his own name, replaced the preface of Copernicus by another strongly contrasting in spirit with that of Copernicus.&quot;

While Osiander&#x27;s motives behind the letter have been questioned by many, he has been defended by historian Bruce Wrightsman, who points out he was not an enemy of science. Osiander had many scientific connections including &quot;Johannes Schoner, Rheticus&#x27;s teacher, whom Osiander recommended for his post at the Nurnberg Gymnasium; Peter Apian of Ingolstadt University; Hieronymous Schreiber...Joachim Camerarius...Erasmus Reinhold...Joachim Rheticus...and finally, Hieronymous Cardan.&quot;

The historian Wrightsman put forward that Osiander did not sign the letter because he &quot;was such a notorious [Protestant] reformer whose name was well-known and infamous among Catholics&quot;, so that signing would have likely caused negative scrutiny of the work of Copernicus (a loyal Catholic canon and scholar). Copernicus himself had communicated to Osiander his &quot;own fears that his work would be scrutinized and criticized by the &#x27;peripatetics and theologians&#x27;,&quot; and he had already been in trouble with his bishop, Johannes Dantiscus, on account of his former relationship with his mistress and friendship with Dantiscus&#x27;s enemy and suspected heretic, Alexander Scultetus. It was also possible that Protestant Nurnberg could fall to the forces of the Holy Roman Emperor and since &quot;the books of hostile theologians could be burned...why not scientific works with the names of hated theologians affixed to them?&quot; Wrightsman also holds that this is why Copernicus did not mention his top student, Rheticus (a Lutheran) in the book&#x27;s dedication to the Pope.

Osiander&#x27;s interest in astronomy was theological, hoping for &quot;improving the chronology of historical events and thus providing more accurate apocalyptic interpretations of the Bible... [he shared in] the general awareness that the calendar was not in agreement with astronomical movement and therefore, needed to be corrected by devising better models on which to base calculations.&quot; In an era before the telescope, Osiander (like most of the era&#x27;s mathematical astronomers) attempted to bridge the &quot;fundamental incompatibility between Ptolemaic astronomy and Aristotlian physics, and the need to preserve both&quot;, by taking an &#x27;instrumentalist&#x27; position. Only the handful of &quot;Philosophical purists like the Averroists... demanded physical consistency and thus sought for realist models.&quot;

Copernicus was hampered by his insistence on preserving the idea that celestial bodies had to travel in perfect circles — he &quot;was still attached to classical ideas of circular motion around deferents and epicycles, and spheres.&quot; This was particularly troubling concerning the Earth because he &quot;attached the Earth&#x27;s axis rigidly to a Sun-centered sphere. The unfortunate consequence was that the terrestrial rotation axis then maintained the same inclination with respect to the Sun as the sphere turned, eliminating the seasons.&quot; To explain the seasons, he had to propose a third motion, &quot;an annual contrary conical sweep of the terrestrial axis&quot;. It was not until the Great Comet of 1577, which moved as if there were no spheres to crash through, that the idea was challenged. In 1609, Johannes Kepler fixed Copernicus&#x27; theory by stating that the planets orbit the Sun not in circles, but ellipses. Only after Kepler&#x27;s refinement of Copernicus&#x27; theory was the need for deferents and epicycles abolished.

In his work, Copernicus &quot;used conventional, hypothetical devices like epicycles...as all astronomers had done since antiquity. ...hypothetical constructs solely designed to &#x27;save the phenomena&#x27; and aid computation&quot;. Ptolemy&#x27;s theory contained a hypothesis about the epicycle of Venus that was viewed as absurd if seen as anything other than a geometrical device (its brightness and distance should have varied greatly, but they don&#x27;t). &quot;In spite of this defect in Ptolemy&#x27;s theory, Copernicus&#x27; hypothesis predicts approximately the same variations.&quot; Because of the use of similar terms and similar deficiencies, Osiander could see &quot;little technical or physical truth-gain&quot; between one system and the other. It was this attitude towards technical astronomy that had allowed it to &quot;function since antiquity, despite its inconsistencies with the principles of physics and the philosophical objections of Averroists.&quot;

Writing &quot;Ad lectorem&quot;, Osiander was influenced by Pico della Mirandola&#x27;s idea that humanity &quot;orders [an intellectual] cosmos out of the chaos of opinions.&quot; From Pico&#x27;s writings, Osiander &quot;learned to extract and synthesize insights from many sources without becoming the slavish follower of any of them.&quot; The effect of Pico on Osiander was tempered by the influence of Nicholas of Cusa and his idea of &quot;coincidentia oppositorum&quot;. Rather than having Pico&#x27;s focus on human effort, Osiander followed Cusa&#x27;s idea that understanding the Universe and its Creator only came from divine inspiration rather than intellectual organization. From these influences, Osiander held that in the area of philosophical speculation and scientific hypothesis there are &quot;no heretics of the intellect&quot;, but when one gets past speculation into truth-claims the Bible is the ultimate measure. By holding that Copernicianism was mathematical speculation, Osiander held that it would be silly to hold it up against the accounts of the Bible.

Pico&#x27;s influence on Osiander did not escape Rheticus, who reacted strongly against the &quot;Ad lectorem&quot;. As historian Robert S. Westman puts it, &quot;The more profound source of Rheticus&#x27;s ire however, was Osiander&#x27;s view of astronomy as a disciple fundamentally incapable of knowing anything with certainty. For Rheticus, this extreme position surely must have resonated uncomfortably with Pico della Mirandola&#x27;s attack on the foundations of divinatory astrology.&quot;

In his &quot;Disputations&quot;, Pico had made a devastating attack on astrology. Because those who were making astrological predictions relied on astronomers to tell them where the planets were, they also became a target. Pico held that since astronomers who calculate planetary positions could not agree among themselves, how were they to be held as reliable? While Pico could bring into concordance writers like Aristotle, Plato, Plotinus, Averroes, Avicenna, and Aquinas, the lack of consensus he saw in astronomy was a proof to him of its fallibility alongside astrology. Pico pointed out that the astronomers&#x27; instruments were imprecise and any imperfection of even a degree made them worthless for astrology, people should not trust astrologists because they should not trust the numbers from astronomers. Pico pointed out that astronomers couldn&#x27;t even tell where the Sun appeared in the order of the planets as they orbited the Earth (some put it close to the Moon, others among the planets). How, Pico asked, could astrologists possibly claim they could read what was going on when the astronomers they relied on could offer no precision on even basic questions?

As Westman points out, to Rheticus &quot;it would seem that Osiander now offered new grounds for endorsing Pico&#x27;s conclusions: not merely was the disagreement among astronomers grounds for mistrusting the sort of knowledge that they produced, but now Osiander proclaimed that astronomers might construct a world deduced from (possibly) false premises. Thus the conflict between Piconian skepticism and secure principles for the science of the stars was built right into the complex dedicatory apparatus of &quot;De Revolutionibus&quot; itself.&quot; According to the notes of Michael Maestlin, &quot;Rheticus...became embroiled in a very bitter wrangle with the printer [over the Ad lectorem]. Rheticus...suspected Osiander had prefaced the work; if he knew this for certain, he declared, he would rough up the fellow so violently that in future he would mind his own business.&quot;

Objecting to the &quot;Ad lectorem&quot;, Tiedemann Giese urged the Nuremberg city council to issue a correction, but this was not done, and the matter was forgotten. Jan Broscius, a supporter of Copernicus, also despaired of the &quot;Ad lectorem&quot;, writing &quot;Ptolemy&#x27;s hypothesis is the earth rests. Copernicus&#x27; hypothesis is that the earth is in motion. Can either, therefore, be true? ... Indeed, Osiander deceives much with that preface of his ... Hence, someone may well ask: How is one to know which hypothesis is truer, the Ptolemaic or the Copernican?&quot;

Petreius had sent a copy to Hieronymus Schreiber, an astronomer from Nürnberg who had substituted for Rheticus as professor of mathematics in Wittenberg while Rheticus was in Nürnberg supervising the printing. Schreiber, who died in 1547, left in his copy of the book a note about Osiander&#x27;s authorship. Via Michael Mästlin, this copy came to Johannes Kepler, who discovered what Osiander had done and methodically demonstrated that Osiander had indeed added the foreword. The most knowledgeable astronomers of the time had realized that the foreword was Osiander&#x27;s doing.

Owen Gingerich gives a slightly different version: Kepler knew of Osiander&#x27;s authorship since he had read about it in one of Schreiber&#x27;s annotations in his copy of &quot;De Revolutionibus&quot;; Maestlin learned of the fact from Kepler. Indeed, Maestlin perused Kepler&#x27;s book, up to the point of leaving a few annotations in it. However, Maestlin already suspected Osiander, because he had bought his &quot;De revolutionibus&quot; from the widow of Philipp Apian; examining his books, he had found a note attributing the introduction to Osiander.

Johannes Praetorius (1537–1616), who learned of Osiander&#x27;s authorship from Rheticus during a visit to him in Kraków, wrote Osiander&#x27;s name in the margin of the foreword in his copy of &quot;De revolutionibus&quot;.

All three early editions of &quot;De revolutionibus&quot; included Osiander&#x27;s foreword.

==Reception==
Even before the 1543 publication of &quot;De revolutionibus&quot;, rumors circulated
about its central theses. In one of his &quot;Tischreden&quot; (Table Talks), Martin Luther is quoted as saying in 1539:

People gave ear to an upstart astrologer who strove to show that the earth revolves, not the heavens or the firmament, the sun and the moon ... This fool wishes to reverse the entire science of astronomy; but sacred Scripture tells us [Joshua 10:13] that Joshua commanded the sun to stand still, and not the earth.

When the book was finally published, demand was low, with an initial print run of 400 failing to sell out. Copernicus had made the book extremely technical, unreadable to all but the most advanced astronomers of the day, allowing it to disseminate into their ranks before stirring great controversy. And, like Osiander, contemporary mathematicians and astronomers encouraged its audience to view it as a useful mathematical model without necessarily being true about causes, thereby somewhat shielding it from accusations of blasphemy.

Among some astronomers, the book &quot;at once took its place as a worthy successor to the &quot;Almagest&quot; of Ptolemy, which had hitherto been the Alpha and Omega of astronomers&quot;. Erasmus Reinhold hailed the work in 1542 and by 1551 had developed the &quot;Prutenic Tables&quot; (&quot;Prussian Tables&quot;; ; ) using Copernicus&#x27; methods. The &quot;Prutenic Tables&quot;, published in 1551, were used as a basis for the calendar reform instituted in 1582 by Pope Gregory XIII. They were also used by sailors and maritime explorers, whose 15th-century predecessors had used Regiomontanus&#x27; &quot;Table of the Stars&quot;. In England, Robert Recorde, John Dee, Thomas Digges and William Gilbert were among those who adopted his position; in Germany, Christian Wurstisen, Christoph Rothmann and Michael Mästlin, the teacher of Johannes Kepler; in Italy, Giambattista Benedetti and Giordano Bruno whilst Franciscus Patricius accepted the rotation of the Earth. In Spain, rules published in 1561 for the curriculum of the University of Salamanca gave students the choice between studying Ptolemy or Copernicus. One of those students, Diego de Zúñiga, published an acceptance of Copernican theory in 1584.

Very soon, nevertheless, Copernicus&#x27; theory was attacked with Scripture and with the common Aristotelian proofs. In 1549, Melanchthon, Luther&#x27;s principal lieutenant, wrote against Copernicus, pointing to the theory&#x27;s apparent conflict with Scripture and advocating that &quot;severe measures&quot; be taken to restrain the impiety of Copernicans.
The works of Copernicus and Zúñiga—the latter for asserting that &quot;De revolutionibus&quot; was compatible with Catholic faith—were placed on the Index of Forbidden Books by a decree of the Sacred Congregation of March 5, 1616 (more than 70 years after Copernicus&#x27; publication):

This Holy Congregation has also learned about the spreading and acceptance by many of the false Pythagorean doctrine, altogether contrary to the Holy Scripture, that the earth moves and the sun is motionless, which is also taught by Nicholaus Copernicus&#x27; &quot;De revolutionibus orbium coelestium&quot; and by Diego de Zúñiga&#x27;s &quot;In Job&quot; ... Therefore, in order that this opinion may not creep any further to the prejudice of Catholic truth, the Congregation has decided that the books by Nicolaus Copernicus [&quot;De revolutionibus&quot;] and Diego de Zúñiga [&quot;In Job&quot;] be suspended until corrected.

&quot;De revolutionibus&quot; was not formally banned but merely withdrawn from circulation, pending &quot;corrections&quot; that would clarify the theory&#x27;s status as hypothesis. Nine sentences that represented the heliocentric system as certain were to be omitted or changed. After these corrections were prepared and formally approved in 1620 the reading of the book was permitted. But the book was never reprinted with the changes and was available in Catholic jurisdictions only to suitably qualified scholars, by special request. It remained on the Index until 1758, when Pope Benedict XIV (1740–58) removed the uncorrected book from his revised Index.

==Census of copies==
Arthur Koestler described &quot;De revolutionibus&quot; as &quot;The Book That Nobody Read&quot; saying the book &quot;was and is an all-time worst seller&quot;, despite the fact that it was reprinted four times. Owen Gingerich, an eminent astronomer and historian of science who has written on both Nicolaus Copernicus and Johannes Kepler, disproved this after a 35-year project to examine every surviving copy of the first two editions. Gingerich showed that nearly all the leading mathematicians and astronomers of the time owned and read the book; however, his analysis of the marginalia shows that almost all of them ignored the cosmology at the beginning of the book and were only interested in Copernicus&#x27; new equant-free models of planetary motion in the later chapters. Also, Nicolaus Reimers in 1587 translated the book into German.

Gingerich&#x27;s efforts and conclusions are recounted in &quot;The Book Nobody Read&quot;, published in 2004 by Walker &amp; Co. His census included 276 copies of the first edition (by comparison, there are 228 extant copies of Shakespeare&#x27;s First Folio) and 325 copies of the second. The research behind this book earned its author the Polish government&#x27;s Order of Merit in 1981. Due largely to Gingerich&#x27;s scholarship, &quot;De revolutionibus&quot; has been researched and catalogued better than any other first-edition historic text except for the original Gutenberg Bible.
One of the copies now resides at the Archives of the University of Santo Tomas in the Miguel de Benavides Library. In January 2017, a second-edition copy was stolen as part of a heist of rare books from Heathrow Airport and remains unrecovered.

<text>B-Rock 99.3FM (call sign: 2BXS) is a local radio station in Bathurst, New South Wales, Australia. It broadcasts on 99.3 megahertz on the FM band, from a transmitter in Bathurst, with a power output of 10 kilowatts (10,000 watts) and callsign 2BXS.

Its callsign meaning is:
* 2 (a prefix for New South Wales radio stations)
* BXS, an extension of its sister station (2BS)&#x27;s callsign. However, this callsign is never heard on air.

Its on-air name, &quot;B-Rock&quot;, is named for Australian motor racing legend (and nine-time Bathurst 1000 winner) Peter Brock, but can also be known to be short for BathurstRock&quot; (or Rocks&quot;).

It is owned by &quot;Bathurst Broadcasters Pty. Ltd.&quot;, a privately held company, owned by Bill Caralis&#x27;s Broadcast Operations Group, who also owns sister station 2BS Bathurst.

It began broadcasting on 2 December 1996, as a supplementary FM license in the Bathurst district.

B-Rock&#x27;s format was hot adult contemporary (rock), with a core audience of up to 39 years. Its programs are produced locally, and features competitions, comedy, requests and national news which airs on the hour from 7 am to 5 pm Monday to Friday. 

In January 2025, BOG changed the format of B-Rock to Top 40 (CHR) in an attempt to appeal to a wider audience, particularly younger listeners. In a statement on Facebook, B-Rock stated that the Rock format had become niche in many Australian markets. Any rock music played on B-Rock now mostly comes from BOG&#x27;s 80s to Now music log, which is also heard on stations like NEW FM 105.3 Newcastle and Roccy FM 93.9 Young.

<doc id="1028543" wikidata="Q3008124" url="?curid=1028543" title="Cyber (Marvel Comics)">
<text>Cyber is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character is usually depicted as an enemy of Wolverine from the X-Men. 

== Publication history ==

Created by writer Peter David and artist Sam Kieth, Cyber first appeared in &quot;Marvel Comics Presents&quot; #85 (Sept. 1991), though his physical appearance was obscured by a trench coat and hat. He was first fully seen and named in &quot;Marvel Comics Presents&quot; #86 (Sept. 1991).

==Fictional character biography==
===Origin===
Silas Burr is believed to have been born in Canada. He was an agent for the Pinkerton National Detective Agency. In the spring of 1912, he was accused of multiple murders in Sioux City, Iowa. He was found guilty on 22 counts of murder and sentenced to death by hanging. However, he escaped from the courthouse. He went to a Western Canadian military base. In the Canadian Army, a new employer Frederick Hudson took a special interest in his unique ability to push the men under his command beyond their moral and emotional limits. 

Cyber&#x27;s earliest known confrontation with Logan seemingly occurred around World War I, where he served as Logan&#x27;s brutal drill instructor during his early days in the military. Cyber received instructions to focus his attention on Logan in particular. He eventually receives orders to murder Janet, a woman at the military in whom Logan was interested romantically, to further dehumanize Logan. After witnessing her death at Cyber&#x27;s hands, Logan attacks, but Cyber severely beats him and gouges out Logan&#x27;s left eye. This is Logan&#x27;s most severe beating and defeat up to this point in his life, and the resulting psychological effects result in a deep-seated fear of Cyber. Without any memory of Burr&#x27;s abuse, Logan again finds himself under the command of Burr while enlisted with the Devil&#x27;s Brigade during World War II. He introduces Logan to US Army soldier Nick Fury for the clandestine rescue mission of Captain America from German-occupied Northern Africa.

Returning from Indochina for nine months in 1959, Burr would train his finest student Daken (Logan&#x27;s son) before the boy is secretly ordered to destroy the training camp and everyone associated with it, including its commander. Eviscerated and shot by Daken, Burr is spared from death, as he was chosen by Romulus to be the prototype for the adamantium bonding process and has the metal permanently bonded to his skin.

===Modern era===
In the modern era, Cyber resurfaces in Madripoor, as an enforcer for an unnamed drug cartel, where he interferes between the rival crime cartels of Wolverine&#x27;s ally Tiger Tyger and General Coy. With the exception of his adamantium enhancements, Cyber&#x27;s appearance remains unchanged, indicating that he ages much slower than an ordinary human. After running from the fight and barely escaping with his life from their latest encounter, Logan eventually manages to overcome his fear of Cyber to save Tyger&#x27;s life. Tyger bites out the villain&#x27;s left eye before he falls into a truck full of the powerful hallucinogens he had earlier used on Wolverine, leading Cyber to run screaming into the forest and disappear at the ocean&#x27;s edge.

Cyber later confronts the mutant team X-Factor alongside the female criminal organization called the Hell&#x27;s Belles whom Cyber is mentoring as enforcers for an unnamed drug cartel. Shrew, a former member of the Hell&#x27;s Belles, wishes to testify against the cartel, and Cyber and his team are ordered to silence her. Cyber defeats X-Factor&#x27;s Polaris first, concerned over the woman&#x27;s magnetic powers. He manages to poison Strong Guy with his claws and attempts to ransom the antidote in exchange for Shrew. However, Strong Guy is saved due to the scientific resources of the US government. In a later battle in a subway station, Shrew manages to push Cyber into the path of an oncoming train driven by X-Factor&#x27;s leader Val Cooper, and he disappears.

Cyber next surfaces on the distant island Koma Koi as an agent for the mysterious death cult, The Coven. He is hired to steal a mystical gem, the Tear of Heaven, and kidnap its guardian priestess, Kayla. Wolverine, who happens to be vacationing on the island, recognizes Cyber&#x27;s scent on Kayla and tracks Cyber to The Coven. The two are eventually shackled to each other by an adamantium chain, and will fight each other incessantly unless gassed unconscious or lowered into an acid pit. Crossing a rope bridge, Wolverine eventually gains the upper hand and strangles Cyber with their shackles. Hanging by his throat and lacking an adamantium windpipe, he releases the chain and disappears as he falls into the dark jungle.

Cyber is next seen back in Edinburgh, Scotland, where he engages Wolverine in battle. Recalling his part in the West Port murders long ago, he announces his intention to kill Wolverine and feed him to deathwatch beetles to steal his adamantium skeleton. However, Cyber is unaware that the adamantium laced to Wolverine&#x27;s skeleton has been removed by Magneto. Despite this, and despite the fact that many of Wolverine&#x27;s other mutant attributes were weakened, Wolverine manages to hold his own against Cyber briefly. Cyber is momentarily distracted by the distant cannon fire of Edinburgh Castle as Wolverine extracts his bone claws and slashes Cyber across the face. Unimpressed by the attack and annoyed by this turn of events, Cyber slams Wolverine to the ground and uses his foot to break the bone claws off of Wolverine&#x27;s right arm. Their fight is interrupted, though, allowing Wolverine the opportunity to escape Cyber. Using his amplified brain-wave tracking power, he chases the poisoned Logan to Muir Island, where he is eventually outsmarted by Kitty Pride and captured by Excalibur.

Cyber is later broken out of S.H.I.E.L.D. custody by the Dark Riders. He is taken to one of Apocalypse&#x27;s corpse-littered, ancient Egyptian fortresses. They run a series of tests to determine the strength and purity of Cyber&#x27;s adamantium skin, then through a combined effort they manage to trap him inside a vault and release a swarm of voracious, &quot;mutant&quot; deathwatch beetles, which devour the flesh from Cyber&#x27;s entire body, beginning with his exposed face and eating the rest from the inside out. Cyber&#x27;s adamantium carapace, which remains untouched, is then used in an unsuccessful attempt to re-implant adamantium onto Wolverine&#x27;s skeleton by Genesis, leader of the Dark Riders.

===Resurrection===
Cyber resurfaced in astral form, making himself known to Milo Gunderson, a powerful young mutant with childlike intelligence. After possessing Milo&#x27;s body, Cyber is easily able to suppress Milo&#x27;s childlike psyche, coupling Milo&#x27;s incredible strength with his own cunning intelligence. Intent on revenge, he sets off for the Tinkerer, contracting the man to perform the adamantium-epidermal bonding process once he has stolen the necessary liquid adamantium from storage in The Hague. Arriving in Brussels, he is revealed to be behind the scenes in setting up the confrontation between Wolverine and Daken. At the culmination of the bloody battle between father and son, Cyber appears, complete in his new adamantium laced skin, and challenges not Wolverine, but Daken. After quickly gaining the upper hand in his fight with Daken, Cyber questions him on the whereabouts of his master. Daken refuses to answer and manages to flee, leaving Cyber and Wolverine alone. During the following battle, Cyber suffers from a heart attack, as Milo had a weak heart. Upon discovering that Silas had previously instructed Daken, and is capable of tracking his location, Wolverine spares him in exchange for information. As Silas starts retelling how, in 1912, he was saved from capital punishment by Sabretooth and taken to Canada where he met the mysterious man known as Hudson, his condition worsens, and Wolverine is forced to bring him to the Tinkerer to help him with the needed treatment. Agreeing to construct an artificial pacemaker to stabilize Cyber&#x27;s heart condition in exchange for the use of Logan&#x27;s mysterious Carbonadium synthesizer, The Tinkerer unwittingly affixes the radioactive device to Cyber&#x27;s chest, before Logan disappears with the C-Synth and tosses it from a bridge into the water below. He resurfaced in a desolate town inside Northern Africa, commanding a local militant faction, and attempts to coerce Wolverine and Daken into cooperating with him in their hunt for Romulus, his personal motives remaining a mystery. After cooperating with Daken, Burr takes him to the abandoned farm somewhere in Saskatchewan, Canada where his transformation into &quot;Cyber&quot; took place nearly fifty years prior. Deceived by Daken&#x27;s emotional powers, Cyber seemingly succumbs to the poisonous effects of the Carbonadium pacemaker, his weakened heart condition, or both and collapses in pain as Daken steps on his medication. He was last seen left for dead by both Daken and Wolverine.

Cyber is later killed by Ogun who claims that he was a formidable opponent, then tries to sell his adamantium carapace to Dr. Abraham Cornelius after dissolving his flesh away by submerging his corpse in an acid bath.

===Hornet===
Under unknown circumstances, Silas returns to the living once again and has masqueraded himself as &quot;Hornet&quot; from the Slingers. He&#x27;s first seen in Las Vegas following Hydra&#x27;s takeover of America, having been hired by the Forbidden City casino owner Silas Thorne to stage a robbery of a mass food delivery being sent to another casino, as the man claims that casino owner Cassandra Mercury will simply take all of the food for herself and Cassandra&#x27;s employees rather than pass it around. Hornet is able to defeat most of the casino security before he is intercepted by the Scarlet Spider, but he declines to answer questions about his apparent resurrection and fled. When Scarlet Spider and Ricochet track Hornet to the casino where his employer works, Hornet uses a strange amulet to summon an army of monsters, subsequently introducing himself as Silas to Ricochet during the fight. After Scarlet Spider damages the amulet, the monsters are contained by Dusk, but Hornet fled in the resulting confusion. He brings the rest of the Slingers together, claiming that he has been chosen by the Black Marvel and the team are ordered to capture the Scarlet Spider to charge him for his attack on Thorne. As the original and modern Scarlet Spider confront the Slingers, it is revealed that the Black Marvel has no soul and damage to Hornet&#x27;s gauntlets reveal his true identity, who had been revived by a demon that was posing as Black Marvel. Although he is overpowered by the Scarlet Spiders and Slingers, Silas manages to escape from them.

===Possessed by Adamantine===
Sometime after abandoning his Hornet identity, Cyber decides to hunt down Wolverine to settle the score with his old foe just before Wolverine relocates to Krakoa. Despite every mutant being granted amnesty by the sovereign nation and being one himself, Cyber does not visit Krakoa due to the presence of more powerful mutants in Wolverine&#x27;s company. After Krakoa&#x27;s dissolution, Cyber is given the opportunity when Wolverine retreats to the wilderness in the Northwest Territories. To lure Wolverine out, Cyber murders several innocents, including a wolfpack Wolverine had befriended, and shoots Nightcrawler, provoking Wolverine into a fight in an open field. Wolverine manages to overpower Cyber, viciously beating him and gouging out one of his eyes. Cyber is forced to retreat. but Wolverine gives up pursuing him to tend to the injured Nightcrawler. While recovering in a cave, Cyber encounters a mysterious gold-colored metallic substance that possesses him, healing his injuries and turning his adamantium skin gold. The possessed Cyber travels to Kyoto and attacks Lady Deathstrike, who also becomes possessed by gold metal. Then they did the same thing to Constrictor II. The metal called adamantine then controls the villains in subduing Wolverine so that it can replace his adamantium with adamantine.

==Powers and abilities==
===Original body===
Silas Burr is a mutant that possesses a number of superhuman abilities, some due to his natural mutation and some due to artificial enhancement. Silas possesses some degree of superhuman strength. Though no limit has been explicitly given, his strength was sufficient to destroy a jeep with a single blow or slash open a bank vault door with ease.

Cyber&#x27;s skin was bonded with a layer of the near indestructible alloy adamantium, with the exception of his face, using an unknown arc welding technique. As a result, most of Cyber&#x27;s body was virtually invulnerable to physical injury. Cyber&#x27;s adamantium skin has proven able to withstand all attacks against it, even by weapons composed of adamantium itself.

Housed within each of Cyber&#x27;s fingers is a retractable adamantium claw. Each talon was tipped in either powerful hallucinogens or poisons that have proven capable of incapacitating Wolverine before his mutant healing factor could filter them out. The potent toxins are specifically designed to affect Wolverine and are fatal to ordinary humans within seconds. Cyber&#x27;s adamantium claws were also capable of cutting almost any known material. The known exceptions are adamantium itself and Captain America&#x27;s shield, which is composed of a Vibranium and an experimental &quot;steel alloy&quot;.

After Wolverine gouged out Cyber&#x27;s left eye in combat, it was replaced with an artificial implant.

Cyber also possesses a psionic ability that allows him to track specific brainwave patterns across great distances. The exact limit of Cyber&#x27;s range is unknown, though it was greatly amplified after his over-exposure to the hallucinogens that coat his claws. Cyber has claimed he can track brain wave patterns from any location on Earth, and was even able to allow his consciousness to leave his body entirely. It was this ability that allowed Cyber to survive in astral form following the attack by the Dark Riders.

Cyber is an excellent hand-to-hand combatant. He is well known in military circles, himself a veteran of World War I and World War II, and throughout the criminal underworld, where he often hires himself out as a special enforcer or mentor. He is a talented, though quite sadistic and murderous, teacher of unarmed combat methods.

===Second body===
His consciousness has taken possession of the body of Milo Gunderson, a large, muscular mutant with childlike intelligence. Milo is a mutant possessing some degree of superhuman strength, the limits of which are not known. However, his strength is sufficient to kill a fully grown horse with a single punch.

Cyber also apparently retains his brainwave tracking ability within his new body. Cyber has undergone a process in which adamantium has been laced to Milo&#x27;s skin, with only his face left uncovered, as well as retractable talons on his fingertips. As a result, his body is highly resistant to all forms of injury, including assaults from weapons composed of adamantium. However, the mutant factor that made his body develop so fast and strong puts a lot of stress on his heart, which makes him dependent on the medicine his mother was giving him. After suffering from a heart attack, he received a &quot;pacemaker&quot;, mounted to his chest, fabricated from the deadly, radioactive element Carbonadium. His face is beginning to show signs of blistering, possibly from its effects. As his condition worsened, he collapsed and was later seen by Wolverine lying still on his back with his eyes open, a blood stain around his Carbonadium pacemaker, and flies crawling on his face.

Cyber is seen on the cover of Wolverine (vol. 4) #5, residing in Hell alongside several other deceased villains, but does not appear in the story itself.

With the circumstances of his next appearance unknown, Cyber&#x27;s corpse is later seen submerged in a vat of acid, dissolving the flesh away from his adamantium carapace. He had been defeated in single combat by Ogun, who states that he had put up an admirable fight before his death. The adamantium that will be harvested from his body is to be delivered to the laboratory of Abraham Cornelius.

===Third body===
His very soul had been placed within a new body, which he then used to take on the identity of Hornet. Most likely thanks to a combination of a powerful demon coupled with use of his psychic abilities to commandeer it, like his previous bodies; Silas has had this new one fitted with adamantium bonded to his skin and hair follicles. Making all but his face and head impervious to physical damage.

He possesses retractable claws on all ten of his digits and wrist mounted laser guns implanted on his forearms in the event his Hornet suit were ever compromised. His new body is healthier and in perfect physical condition, not like the one of Mr. Gunderson which had a heart condition and needed a pacemaker to keep it stable. Easily being able to battle and best the eugenically enhanced spider clones Ben Reilly and Kaine Parker. Silas also accommodated the Hornet&#x27;s cyber suit which was outfitted with all manner of high-tech gadgetry and weapon&#x27;s systems created by its previous owners. Function such as wrist mounted blasters which fire variable rounds of ammunition; ranging from stun setting, dart launchers, laser guns and other unknown ammo types. It also magnifies his bodies physical abilities giving him increased strength, speed, durability, stamina and reflexes.

His Hornet suit also possesses a short-range bio-electrostatic discharge which he can engage when in physical contact with an adversary. Rendering them physically stunned as it delivers a debilitating shock to their nervous systems.

Through unknown means, Silas&#x27;s new body has superhuman physical strength. He is now able to throw a manhole cover with enough force to decapitate someone with relative ease. He also came back bearing boons from the demon who resurrected him, gifting Silas with a special pendant that enables him to summon an extra-dimensional horror which feeds on wickedness called a Fhtagn, the drawback being that the cursed relic only calls it forth, not give him control over it. But he could potentially use his psionic abilities to control the simple, yet alien mind of the otherworldly creature if prompted too.

<doc id="1028552" wikidata="Q207427" url="?curid=1028552" title="Nelumbo">
<text>Nelumbo is a genus of aquatic plants with large, showy flowers. Members are commonly called lotus, though the name is also applied to various other plants and plant groups, including the unrelated genus &quot;Lotus&quot;. Members outwardly resemble those in the family Nymphaeaceae (&quot;water lilies&quot;), but &quot;Nelumbo&quot; is actually very distant from that family.

&quot;Nelumbo&quot; is an ancient genus, with dozens of species known from fossil remains since the Early Cretaceous. However, there are only two known living species of lotus. One is the better-known &quot;Nelumbo nucifera&quot;, which is native to East Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and probably Australia and is commonly cultivated for consumption and use in traditional Chinese medicine. The other lotus is &quot;Nelumbo lutea&quot;, which is native to North America and the Caribbean. Horticultural hybrids have been produced between these two allopatric species.

== Description ==

===Ultrahydrophobicity===
The leaves of &quot;Nelumbo&quot; are highly water-repellent (i.e. they exhibit ultrahydrophobicity) and have given the name to what is called the lotus effect. Ultrahydrophobicity involves two criteria: a very high water contact angle between the droplet of water and the leaf surface, and a very low roll-off angle. This means that the water must contact the leaf surface at exactly one, minuscule point, and any manipulation of the leaf by changing its angle will result in the water droplet rolling off of the leaf. Ultrahydrophobicity is conferred by the usually dense layer of papillae on the surface of the &quot;Nelumbo&quot; leaves, and the small, robust, waxy tubules that protrude off each papilla. This helps reduce the area of contact between the water droplet and the leaf.

Ultrahydrophobicity is said to confer a very important evolutionary advantage. As an aquatic plant with leaves that rest on the water&#x27;s surface, the genus &quot;Nelumbo&quot; is characterized by its concentration of stomata on the upper epidermis of its leaves, unlike most other plants which concentrate their stomata on the lower epidermis, underneath the leaf. The collection of water on the upper epidermis, whether that be by rain, mist, or the nearby disturbance of water, is very detrimental to the leaf&#x27;s ability to perform gas exchange through its stomata. Thus, &quot;Nelumbo&#x27;s&quot; ultrahydrophobicity allows the water droplets to accumulate together very quickly, and then roll off of the leaf very easily at the slightest disturbance of the leaf, a process which allows its stomata to function normally without restriction due to blockage by water droplets.

===Thermoregulation===
An uncommon property of the genus &quot;Nelumbo&quot; is that it can generate heat, which it does by using the alternative oxidase pathway (AOX). This pathway involves a different, alternative exchange of electrons from the usual pathway that electrons follow when generating energy in mitochondria, known as the AOX, or alternative oxidase pathway.

The typical pathway in plant mitochondria involves cytochrome complexes. The pathway used to generate heat in &quot;Nelumbo&quot; involves cyanide-resistant alternative oxidase, which is a different electron acceptor than the usual cytochrome complexes. The plant also reduces ubiquitin concentrations while in thermogenesis, which allows the AOX in the plant to function without degradation. Thermogenesis is restricted to the receptacle, stamen, and petals of the flower, but each of these parts produce heat independently without relying on the heat production in other parts of the flower.

There are several theories about the function of thermogenesis, especially in an aquatic genus such as &quot;Nelumbo&quot;. The most common theory posits that thermogenesis in flowers attracts pollinators, for a variety of reasons. Heated flowers may attract insect pollinators. As the pollinators warm themselves while resting inside the flower, they deposit and pick up pollen onto and from the flower. The thermogenic environment might also be conducive to pollinator mating; pollinators may require a certain temperature for reproduction. By providing an ideal thermogenic environment, the flower is pollinated by mating pollinators. Others theorize that heat production facilitates the release of volatile compounds into the air to attract pollinators flying over water, or that the heat is recognizable in the dark by thermo-sensitive pollinators. None have been conclusively proven to be more plausible than the others.

After anthesis, the receptacle of the lotus transitions from a primarily thermogenic to a photosynthetic structure, as seen in the rapid and dramatic increase in photosystems, photosynthetically involved pigments, electron transport rates, and the presence of 13C in the receptacle and petals, all of which assist in increasing photosynthesis rates. After this transition, all thermogenesis in the flower is lost. Pollinators do not need to be attracted once the ovary is fertilized, and thus the receptacle&#x27;s resources are better used when it is photosynthesizing to produce carbohydrates that can increase plant biomass or fruit mass.

Other plants utilize thermoregulation in their life cycles. Among these is the eastern skunk cabbage, which heats itself to melt any ice above it, and push through the ground in early spring. Also, the elephant yam, which heats its flowers to attract pollinators. In addition, the carrion flower, which heats itself to disperse water vapor through the air, carrying its scent further, thus attracting more pollinators.

=== Similar species ===
The leaves of &quot;Nelumbo&quot; can be distinguished from those of genera in the family Nymphaeaceae as they are peltate, that is they have fully circular leaves. &quot;Nymphaea&quot;, on the other hand, has a single characteristic notch from the edge in to the center of the lily pad. The seedpod of &quot;Nelumbo&quot; is very distinctive.

== Taxonomy ==

=== Taxonomic history ===
The Cronquist system of 1981 recognizes the family Nelumbonaceae but places it in the water lily order Nymphaeales. The Dahlgren system of 1985 and Thorne system of 1992 both recognize the family and place it in its own order, Nelumbonales. The United States Department of Agriculture still classifies the lotus family within the water lily order.

There is residual disagreement over which family the genus should be placed in. Traditional classification systems recognized &quot;Nelumbo&quot; as part of the Nymphaeaceae, but traditional taxonomists were likely misled by convergent evolution associated with an evolutionary shift from a terrestrial to an aquatic lifestyle. In the older classification systems it was recognized under the order Nymphaeales or Nelumbonales.

=== Modern classification ===
&quot;Nelumbo&quot; is currently recognized as the only living genus in Nelumbonaceae, one of several distinctive families in the eudicot order of the Proteales. Its closest living relatives, the (Proteaceae and Platanaceae), are shrubs or trees.

The APG IV system of 2016 recognizes Nelumbonaceae as a distinct family and places it in the order Proteales in the eudicot clade, as do the earlier APG III and APG II systems.

=== Phylogeny ===
There are several fossil species known from Cretaceous, Paleogene and Neogene aged strata throughout Eurasia and North America. Despite the ancient origins of this genus and the wide geographic separation of the two extant species (&quot;N. nucifera&quot; and &quot;N. lutea&quot;), phylogenetic evidence indicates that they diverged rather recently, during the early Pleistocene (about 2 million years ago).

=== Species ===
==== Extant species ====
*&quot;Nelumbo lutea&quot; – American lotus (Eastern United States, Mexico, Greater Antilles, Honduras)
*&quot;Nelumbo nucifera&quot; – sacred or Indian lotus, also known as the Rose of India and the sacred water lily of Hinduism and Buddhism. It is the national flower of India and Vietnam. Its roots and seeds are also used widely in cooking in East Asia, South Asia and Southeast Asia.

==== Fossil species ====
Nearly 30 fossil species are known from the mid-Cretaceous to the present.
*†&quot;Nelumbo aureavallis&quot; – Eocene (North Dakota), described from leaves found in the Golden Valley Formation in North Dakota, USA.
*†&quot;Nelumbo changchangensis&quot; Eocene, (Hainan Island, China), described from several fossils of leaves, seedpods, and rhizomes from the Eocene-aged strata in the Changchang Basin, of Hainan Island.
*†&quot;Nelumbo choffati&quot; Early Cretaceous (Portugal), leaves known from the Albian. One of the earliest known species.
*†&quot;Nelumbo jiayinensis&quot; Late Cretaceous, (Heilongjiang, China), leaves described from the Santonian-aged Yong&#x27;ancun Formation 
*†&quot;Nelumbo lusitanica&quot; Early Cretaceous (Portugal), leaves known from the Albian. One of the earliest known species.
*†&quot;Nelumbo minima&quot; Pliocene (Netherlands), described from leaves and seedpods that suggest a very small plant. Originally described as a member of the genus &quot;Nelumbites&quot;, as &quot;&quot;Nelumbites minimus&quot;.&quot;
*†&quot;Nelumbo nipponica&quot; Eocene-Miocene, fossil leaves are known from Eocene-aged strata in Japan, and Miocene-aged strata in Russia.
*†&quot;Nelumbo orientalis&quot; Cretaceous (Japan), fossils found in Cretaceous-aged strata of Japan. The Sarao Formation, which they are known from, was formerly considered of Early Cretaceous age, but more recent studies support a Maastrichtian age for it.
*†&quot;Nelumbo protolutea&quot; Eocene (Mississippi), fossils of leaves strongly suggest a plant similar in form to the American lotus.
*†&quot;Nelumbo weymouthi&quot; Early Cretaceous (Wyoming, US), leaves known from the Albian. One of the earliest known species.

=== Etymology ===
The genus name is derived from &quot;neḷum&quot;, the name for &quot;Nelumbo nucifera&quot;.

==Uses==
 The entire plant can be eaten either raw or cooked. The underwater portion is high in starch. The fleshy parts can be dug from the mud and baked or boiled. The young leaves can be boiled. The seeds are palatable and can be eaten raw or dried and ground into flour. The stem fibers are also used to make lotus silk.

==Culture==
The sacred lotus, &quot;N. nucifera&quot;, is sacred in both Hinduism and Buddhism. It is the floral emblem of both India and Vietnam.

<text>Creighton Preparatory School (simply referred to as Creighton Prep or Prep) is a private, Jesuit high school for boys in Omaha, Nebraska, United States. It was established in 1878 under the name Creighton College and is located in the Archdiocese of Omaha. Creighton College was founded by John A. Creighton and named after Edward Creighton, developer of the transcontinental telegraph line. It was founded from a $100,000 grant and donated to the Catholic Church, leading to its inception as a Jesuit institution. Creighton College separated into Creighton University and Creighton Preparatory School in 1958. Over the 142 years since its founding, Creighton Prep has grown from an initial class of 120 students to a student body of 1021 individuals (2016).

Creighton Prep holds a rivalry with Westside High School and is the recipient of nearly 200 individual State Championship and All State Championship titles. Creighton Prep has received the U.S. Department of Education Blue Ribbon Award for Academic Excellence and has its education programs are grounded in Jesuit Philosophies. Admittance is dependent on an annually held entrance exam. Creighton Prep was used as a site for the filming of &quot;Downsizing&quot;, a 2017 American science fiction comedy-drama film directed by Alexander Payne.

== History ==
=== 1878 ===
Creighton School was founded in 1878, later separating into Creighton Preparatory School and Creighton University. The school was named after Edward Creighton, an Omaha businessman, developer of the transcontinental telegraph line, and founder of Omaha and Northwestern Railroad who originally proposed the school but died prior to completing its proposal. After his death in 1874, his wife, Mary Lucretia, then began finishing the proposal but died in 1876, leaving the unfinished plans to her brother-in-law, John A. Creighton. In the will of Mary Lucretia, it was stated that there would be a $100,000 memorial for her late husband “to purchase the site for a school in the city of Omaha and erect buildings thereon for a school of the class and grade of a college.” John Creighton purchased 6.2 acres of land at the address of 24th and California streets in Omaha, NE. Construction of the initial building was completed during the summer of 1878 and the completed site was transferred to the ownership Right Reverend James O&#x27;Connor, Bishop of Omaha in July of that year. O&#x27;Connor then contacted the Society of Jesus (Jesuits) to operate the college and the university was transferred to their ownership in August 1879. Classes began on September 2, 1878 with five Jesuit priests serving as the Board of Trustees, two lay teachers, and an initial enrollment of 120 students.

=== 1953–1967 ===
From 1878 to 1958 Creighton Prep functioned as a department of Creighton University. In 1953, both organizations determined their functionality would be best served if they were to separate into two independent institutions. The initial plot of land for Creighton Preparatory School was purchased in 1953, fundraising for the school began in 1956, and construction was completed prior to the start of the 1958 fall term. Both Fr. Henry Sullivan, S.J and Fr. Carl Reinert, S.J. spearheaded the effort, raising $1.7 million for the construction of a 105,000 sq/ft school at its current 7400 Western Avenue location. Once completed, the school was officially given to the Society of Jesus, known more commonly as the Jesuits.

In 1958, upon completion of the main building, construction on the Jesuit residence began. The Jesuit residence was completed in 1961, after 3 years of construction. This 50,000 sq/ft building was designed to house 30 Jesuit priests, Scholastics, and Brothers who had been living prior in then-empty classrooms and two houses southwest of the main school building. The same year, a chapel for the Jesuit priests was constructed, later renovated into a school wide chapel, named Skinner Chapel.

In 1967, led by Fr. Daniel Kenney, Creighton Prep founded a student led service organization called &quot;Operation Others&quot; (simply referred to as &quot;OO&quot;), as a food box give-away program. This program encompassed 8 Omaha-area Catholic High schools and grew to annually serve approximately 1500 families.

=== 1970–1985 ===
Led by Mike Wilmot, S.J., volunteers and students constructed the &quot;Tin Gym&quot; in 1970. This provisional building was to serve as a secondary gym along the north side of the school. This gym served the purpose of hosting dances, informal sports games, and other student activities. This building was later demolished in 2009 to make way for the construction of the Heider Center gymnasium, and the wood floor was placed into long-term storage until being sold to St. Joan of Arc School in 2015. Creighton Prep was significantly damaged by an F4 tornado during the 1975 Omaha Tornado Outbreak, resulting in approximately $500,000 in damage and early termination of the school year. Clean-up efforts involved over 1500 individuals and surveys of the damage showed significant damage to the building&#x27;s second floor. Final exams for the school were held in the &quot;Tim Gym&quot;, with many believing that the school may need to be permanently closed due to its extensive damage. The school was repaired prior to the beginning of the fall term.

In 1985, Mike Wilmot, S.J. oversaw students, parents, and volunteers in the construction of the Creighton Prep weight room.

=== 1992–1999 ===
The 35,000 sq/ft Henry L. Sullivan, S.J. Campus Center was the largest structural change made to Creighton Prep since its construction. Completed in 1992, the multipurpose space was designed to host Catholic Masses, eating and study areas, and serve as a location for social events. This addition also included the construction of two additional centers, expanding the campus ministry and counseling offices. Lastly, updated class spaces for the Fine Arts Department were constructed adjacent to the Sullivan Center, expanding the art, architecture, and band programs at Creighton Prep.
In 1999, the 25,000 sq/ft Dr. James B. and Joan C. Peter Science Center completed construction. This addition included the construction of 5 classrooms/ laboratory rooms and renovation of 4 additional classrooms. Approximately 100,000 sq/ft of the east side of the school was renovated in addition to the construction. Large portions of the Jesuit residence were renovated and re-purposed to be used as classrooms and administration offices. Further renovations included the construction of the current main entrance, a 2000-person football stadium, and the addition of a wrestling room.

=== 2000–2009 ===
In 2001, Robert Hotz, S.J., president of Creighton Prep at the time, invited alumnus William Glenn (1962), a gay man, to address the faculty on his experiences of homosexuality in high school and how to better assist gay students. In 2003, President of Creighton Prep, Reverend Robert Hotz, S.J. resigned after inviting another openly gay alumnus, Don Fraynd (1990), to speak at school Mass on his experiences pertaining to religion, service, and homosexuality. &quot;The Advocate&quot; was critical of the resignation while Creighton Prep never listed an official reason for Hotz&#x27;s resignation.

In celebrating the 50 year anniversary of the original completion of the campus, Creighton Prep began a $20 million construction project in 2008. This project was part of a $37 million capital campaign lasting from 2007 to 2013. This renovation project included the construction of a new gym (referred to as the Heider Center), baseball field, multipurpose artificial turf playing field, renovated classrooms, new auditorium (referred to as the Criss Auditorium), and new technology center. This construction project resulted in the demolition of the &quot;Tin Gym&quot;, having been replaced by updated facilitates. Construction completed in 2009 and the gym was dedicated as the Heider Center on December 12, 2009. Additionally, 2009 marked the implementation of the house system named after influential Creighton Prep priests and each having their own mascot. The houses are as follows: Kanne (Terrapin), Neiman (Griffin), Hindelang (Labrador), Auer (Owl), and Laughlin (Razorback), named after: Fr. Charles Kanne SJ, Fr. Mark Neiman SJ, Fr. Michael Hindelang SJ, Fr. John Auer SJ, and Fr. Dan Laughlin SJ, respectively. Each house competes for the &quot;House Cup&quot; named after Fr. William O’Leary, SJ. These houses also served as a means to assign specific councilors to groups of students. This change was coupled with the addition of block scheduling and implementation of a &quot;community period&quot; in place of traditional study hall.

=== 2014–present ===
In 2014, Creighton Prep partnered with the City of Omaha Storm-Water Program to construct a bio retention garden near the front of the school. By partnering with student clubs: Creighton Prep Architecture Club, the Creighton Prep Junior Green Jays, and the Creighton Prep Science Club, the garden was constructed in 2014 with monitoring systems to determine the project&#x27;s efficacy. This same year, construction of the Circo Memorial Plaza took place. This plaza dedicated Creighton Prep graduates that had died in World War I, World War II, Korean War, Vietnam War, 9/11, and Afghanistan War. Additionally, previous presidents, principals, Jesuit priests, and long time faculty (serving 15 years or more) were dedicated. During the 2015–2016 school year, Creighton Prep implemented a one-on-one IPad program in which students would be required to provide an IPad to their classes.

In 2016, Creighton Prep renovated the Henry L. Sullivan, S.J. Campus Center, reorganizing the space in order to accommodate a new catering service. Creighton Prep had previously relied on restaurant vendors and volunteer work in order to feed the student body but starting in fall of 2016, Creighton Prep contracted FLIK Independent School Dining to serve as the primary food provider. This also included an expansion of the before and after school food service, now providing breakfast and after school meals. The transition to professional dining services came from concerns over lack of nutritional value and inadequate accommodation of food allergies and dietary restrictions. FLIK Independent School Dining services were specifically selected due to their association with the Catholic Schools Network and their successful implementation at both Rockhurst High School and Marquette University High School. The change in meal provider also resulted in a $450 increase in tuition cost with each lunch now costing $2.62. This project further encompassed renovations to the school&#x27;s Skinner Chapel.

In 2018, Creighton Prep announced plans to begin construction on a $16 million &quot;learning commons&quot; to provide academic and emotional resources to the student body. The center is named after Rev. Timothy R. Lannon, president of Creighton Prep (1988 to 1995) and president of Creighton University (2011 to 2015). The center was proposed in part to “help assist our young men as they navigate their emotional and academic needs.” (Rev. Tom Neitzke) and includes the addition of an on staff student psychologist. The Learning Commons also included the addition of a &quot;learning differences&quot; specialist, academic coach, director for student outreach and advocacy, and construction of a student services department. Prep also began construction of a 120 ft clock tower alongside the 52,000 sq/ft expansion. Funding for the project came from Scott Heider, managing principal of Charwell Capital, and his wife Cindy Heider who provided $8 million donation and led the capital campaign for the addition costs.

Due to a theft of 27 relics from St. John&#x27;s Parish, Creighton Prep&#x27;s relic associated with St. Francis Xavier was relocated, as of 2019.

== Cocurricular and extracurricular activities ==

=== Athletics ===
Creighton Preparatory School&#x27;s athletic teams are known as the Junior Jays. They compete in NSAA District A-1 for football, District A-4 for wrestling and cross country, and District A-2 for track &amp; field. The Junior Jays have won over 160 state championships in various sports. The Creighton Prep student section at athletic events is often referred to as &quot;The Birdcage&quot;. The Birdcage is known for its chants, but has been previously criticized for the content of their chants, and alleged acts of vandalism carried out by students. Likewise, due to Creighton Prep&#x27;s status as an all-male school, it has often been subject to anti-gay chants. There is a rivalry between Creighton Prep and Westside High School in athletics, which is considered the oldest high school rivalry in the state. This rivalry began in 1958 when Prep was moved to its current site was largely formed due to the close proximity of the two schools.

There also exists a rivalry between Creighton Prep and Omaha Central due to their similar academic rigor. This rivalry is born partly out of the 1960 state title football championship where both teams were undefeated and ended the game with a scoreless tie. The title was split with both teams receiving the championship title. This game was viewed by approximately 15,000 people and was later published in the book &quot;Omaha Central, Creighton Prep, and Nebraska&#x27;s Greatest High School Football Game.&quot; This game was later featured in the 2016 &quot;Journal of Sport History&quot;.

The 2013 Class A Boys Soccer State Championship, won by Omaha South High School against Creighton Prep (1-0) at Morrison Stadium, holds the current record as the highest attended soccer match in the State of Nebraska. The estimated attendance of this game was 8,200 people, beating the previous record of approximately 6,900 people held by the Creighton Men&#x27;s Soccer team. In September, 2020, Creighton Prep&#x27;s basketball team made a 26 point comeback against Millard West. Referred to as &quot;Creighton Prep&#x27;s Miracle Comeback&quot;, Creighton Prep came back from a 26-0 deficit, scoring 29 points in the last 9 minutes 40 seconds of the game&#x27;s 4th quarter. This game broke the previous school record (Prep v. Burke, 2012, with Prep making a 25 point comeback) and is the 4th largest high school comeback in Nebraska state history.

=== Refugee program ===
Creighton Prep was one of the first Omaha schools to establish a refugee sponsorship program led by student volunteers, with Prep students sponsoring approximately 3 families annually. This program is in place due to Nebraska&#x27;s policies on accepting large numbers of refugees per capita annually, relative to other states. In 2016, Nebraska took in more refugees than any other state, numbering at 1441. This had led to the formation of a relocation aid and resettling service program headed by Creighton Prep, in conjunction with local schools and Lutheran Family Services. Additionally, Prep has integrated a Conflict and Refugee course into its International Studies program, headed by Katy Salznam who previously worked for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Geneva, Switzerland. In line with Creighton Prep&#x27;s service requirements for graduation, this program involves tutoring refugees in English and volunteering at Yates Community Center, a Bhutanese immigrant center.

== Academics and student life ==

=== Academics ===
Creighton Prep&#x27;s overarching model for education is based around the Jesuit values of faith, scholarship, leadership and service. Priorities include &quot;cura personalis&quot; or &quot;care for the whole person,&quot; Magis, Men and Women for Others, Leadership, and Diversity. This is further expanded upon by Prep&#x27;s &quot;Graduate at Graduation&quot; (Grad at Grad), which describes the qualities a student at Creighton Prep is expected to develop. The &quot;Grad at Grad&quot; is universally subscribed to by all Jesuit High schools. The &quot;Grad at Grad&quot; profile outlines five character qualities Jesuit high schools aim to instill in their students by the time of the graduation: Open to Growth, Religious, Loving, Intellectually Competent, and Committed to Doing Justice. Creighton Prep has won the U.S. Department of Education Blue Ribbon Award for Academic Excellence twice (1986-1987).

Classes are structured into block scheduling with specific classes taking place on respectively assigned days. These include A, B, and C day schedules with their own designated classes. Creighton Prep does not employ a traditional study hall, rather it uses a municipal class period, referred to as &quot;Community Period&quot;, for study hall, masses, and other school activities. Admittance to Creighton Prep is determined by an annual entrance exam held in January.

Creighton Prep has been accredited as a college preparatory school by:

* AdvancED
* The National Catholic Education Association
* The North Central Education Association

Creighton Prep is a member of:

* The Jesuit Schools Network
* The National Catholic Education Association
*Jesuit Secondary Education Association

=== Demographics ===
As of 2019, approximately 16% of the Creighton Prep student body is made up of people of color, with 84% of the student body being white. Of the minority students reported, 5% of students are African American, 3% are Asian, 3% are Latino, and 3% identify as mixed race. 12% of students come from non-Catholic religious beliefs and 88% of student identify as Catholic. 22% of students attended public elementary and middle school, and 78% of students attended private Catholic school, prior to admittance to Prep. Approximately, 45-52% of students receive financial aid. In efforts to increase income and racial diversity in the student body, Creighton Prep began scholarship programs in the mid 2010s, citing that their student body should better reflect the racial and financial demographics of Omaha.

=== Discipline ===
Creighton Prep employs a demerit system as a means to discipline students and enforce school policies. This demerit system is mediated by a &quot;demerit card&quot; and with every 5 demerits a student will receive a detention, referred to as a &quot;Jug&quot; (standing for Justice Under God).

As of fall 2014, Creighton Prep has become the first high school in Omaha to implement a mandatory drug testing policy for the entire student body, with approximately 80-90% of all students being tested annually. The policy change was born out a decade of participation in the Nebraska Risk and Protective Factor Student Survey done by the state to assess the drug usage of the cumulative student body and as an initiative to begin expanding Prep&#x27;s health and wellness program. The company contracted is Psychemedics, who have also successfully implemented a similar policy at Rockhurst High School. The process involves randomly selecting students to take part in the drug test where hair samples are taken to assess if a student has performed binge drinking, marijuana, PCPs, amphetamines, cocaine and opiates (approx. 90% of all mainstay drugs) during the previous 90 days. For the first offense, the student and their parents or guardian will meet with the student&#x27;s councilor and discuss interventions. There is no disciplinary punishment enacted by the school but the student must undergo a follow-up test in 90 days which will cost $60. For the second offense, the student will meet with the Dean of Student and must complete a chemical dependency screening, follow recommendations made by the administrators, and undergo a second follow-up test in 90 days. If the student receives a third offense, they will then be dismissed from the school.

=== BASH ===
Annually, Creighton Prep will host a dinner auction in April referred to as BASH (Building a Scholastic Heritage) as a means to provide financial aid to the student body. This includes live and silent auctions, a student-driven raffle, and dinner predominately staffed by student volunteers. The student-led raffle ticket event alone has constituted in nearly $210,000, providing 21 students with full tuition financial aid. BASH annuals has approximately 650-750 attendees and relies on both donors and advertisers as the means of income. Historically, BASH was first held in 1971 and led by J. Don Ashford and Mrs. John Cleary alongside 20 volunteers. This event earned approximately $25,000 which was then employed to fund the financial aid program at the time. In 2016, it was reported that the net proceeds from BASH resulted in over $800,000, constituting a large percentage of the $1.9 million offer in financial aid to the student body.

== Film ==

In April 2016, filming for the movie &quot;Downsizing&quot; took place at Creighton Prep. &quot;Downsizing&quot; is a 2017 American science fiction comedy-drama film directed by Alexander Payne, written by Payne and Jim Taylor and starring Matt Damon, Christoph Waltz, Hong Chau, and Kristen Wiig. This film was the first movie to have been shot in Omaha since 2002&#x27;s &quot;About Schmidt&quot; and the first film to ever feature Creighton Prep. The film stars Matt Damon playing the role of a Creighton Prep alum who, in part of the film, returns to Creighton Prep during a high school reunion. The choice to film at Creighton Prep was decided 2 weeks prior to shooting by director Alexander Payne, who graduated from Creighton Prep in 1979. Set up for the film included conversion of the interior of the school into crew space and decoration of the exterior of the school at Payne&#x27;s request to feature a large banner with the Creighton Prep&#x27;s seal. Payne also included several references to Creighton Prep, such as a street named &quot; Creighton Prep Ave&quot;, throughout the film. The film project worked in conjunction with Creighton Prep&#x27;s Fine Arts Department, headed by Jeremy Caniglia. Damon and Payne would later autograph memorabilia to be auctioned off at Prep&#x27;s BASH fundraiser and the Creighton Prep&#x27;s students would host a fundraiser for Damon&#x27;s charity, Water.org.

== Priest sexual assault allegations ==
In 2018, the Midwest Province of the Society of Jesus released documentation disclosing sexual assault allegations surrounding key members of Creighton Prep&#x27;s clergy. This has included Rev. Willard Dressel (employed at Prep from 1959 to 2003), Rev. J. Roger Lucey (President of Creighton Prep, 1977 to 1982), Rev. J Michael Cannon (employed from 1979 to 1987), Fr. Thomas R. Haller (employed from 1955 to 1980), Rev. Jim Sinnerud (employment terminated in 2018) and Rev. Daniel Kenney (employed from 1965 to 1989). While the former four are deceased, Rev. Kenney was permanently removed from the ministry as of 2003 following eight individual accusations. These documents and the current status of Rev. Kenney&#x27;s priesthood become public in 2018. It was later revealed by Creighton Prep staff that Rev. Kenney had his previous tenure at Creighton Prep prematurely ended in 1989 for similar accusations involving sexually explicit behavior with students but no official record was kept from the alleged events. Rev. Kenney was laicized in November 2020 and is no longer a Jesuit priest. An interdisciplinary research team at Creighton University received a grant from Fordham University in 2021 to investigate Kenney&#x27;s abuse and to understand the culture at Creighton Prep that enabled it. Rev. Jim Sinnerud also has received allegations of sexual assault of a minor. This has resulted in his tenure at Creighton Prep in 2018 being terminated and him being barred from participating in ministerial services. This latter accusation came independent of the Midwest Province of the Society of Jesus&#x27; release earlier in the year, instead citing an incident that occurred prior to his employment at Creighton Prep. In 2019, &quot;Book of Mormon&quot; star Andrew Rannells released his memoir &quot;Too Much Is Not Enough: A Memoir of Fumbling Toward Adulthood,&quot; in which, he described sexual encounters that occurred between him and a priest, referred to as pseudonymous &quot;Father Dominic&quot;, while attending Creighton Prep.

<doc id="1028567" wikidata="Q7236387" url="?curid=1028567" title="Power Play (1998 TV series)">
<text>Power Play is a Canadian television drama series, which aired on CTV from 1998 to 2000. The series was filmed at Copps Coliseum (now FirstOntario Centre) in Hamilton, Ontario.

The show starred Michael Riley as Brett Parker, a former New York City sports agent who became the general manager of a (fictional) National Hockey League franchise, the Hamilton Steelheads.

One of the throughline plots of the series dealt with Parker&#x27;s ongoing love–hate relationships with the sport, the team and his superior at McArdle Industries, corporate executive Colleen Blessed, played by Kari Matchett.

The cast also included Gordon Pinsent as team owner Duff McArdle, Jonathan Crombie, Jennifer Dale and Al Waxman. The show&#x27;s theme song was a modernized version of the Stompin&#x27; Tom Connors classic, &quot;The Hockey Song&quot;, performed partly by Connors himself, and then transitioning to the performance of the band Rusty.

The show was briefly aired on the United States broadcast network UPN, starting in 1999, but was pulled after two episodes. The second episode aired in the United States has the distinction of being the lowest-rated episode (since the Nielsen ratings service began in the 1950s) of any prime-time TV series ever aired by any United States network.

American lotus is an emergent aquatic plant. It grows in lakes and swamps, as well as areas subject to flooding. The roots are anchored in the mud, but the leaves and flowers emerge above the water&#x27;s surface. The petioles of the leaves may extend as much as and end in a round leaf blade in diameter. Mature plants range in height from .

Flowering begins in late spring and may continue into the summer. The specific name means &quot;yellow&quot; in Latin and refers to the flowers, which may be white to pale yellow. The flowers measure in diameter and have 22-25 petals.

==Ecology==
It is the larval host plant of the American lotus borer, &quot;Ostrinia penitalis&quot;.

==Conservation status==
&quot;Nelumbo lutea&quot; populations are declining in the U.S. due to habitat destruction. It has been listed as threatened or endangered in New Jersey, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, and extirpated in Delaware. Their populations have a low level of genetic diversity, showing variation among different populations rather than within populations.

==Range==
The native distribution of the species is Minnesota to Oklahoma, Florida, Mexico, Honduras, and the Caribbean. It was apparently distributed northwards in the United States by Native Americans who carried the plant with them as a food source.

==Uses==
This plant has a large tuberous rhizome that is used as a food source. This may be the plant called &quot;macoupin&quot; in Miami-Illinois. The seed is also edible and is known as &quot;alligator corn&quot;. The seedlike fruits can be shaken loose, and are also edible. The unopened leaves and young stalks can be cooked.

The species is widely planted in ponds for its foliage and flowers. American Lotus spreads via creeping rhizomes and seeds. This species has been crossed with &quot;N. nucifera&quot; to create many hybrids. Seeds may be propagated by scarifying the pointed tip of the seed with a file then soaking in water. Propagation is also possible by division of established plants.

<text>Manawatu District is a territorial authority district in the Manawatū-Whanganui local government region in the North Island of New Zealand, administered by Manawatu District Council. It includes most of the area between the Manawatū River in the south and the Rangitīkei River in the north, stretching from slightly south of the settlement of Himatangi in the south, to just south of Mangaweka in the north, and from the Rangitīkei River to the top of the Ruahine Range in the east. It does not include the Foxton area and the mouth of the Manawatū River, or Palmerston North City (which includes Ashhurst). Its main town is Feilding. The district has an area of 2,624 km².

==Name and geography==
Manawatū is said to have been named by Hau, a great Māori explorer. As he pursued his wife, who had left him for another lover, along the south-west coast of the North Island, he came across and named river mouths, including Whanganui, Whangaehu and Rangitīkei according to events that befell him at the time. He then came across the mouth of the large, wide Manawatū River; awed by the sight and in fear he might not be able to cross it, he said, &quot;Ka tū taku manawa&quot; (My heart stands still).

The name &quot;Manawatū&quot; (often &quot;the Manawatu&quot;) also refers to the whole area centred on the Manawatū Plains, the floodplain of the Manawatū River, with Palmerston North as its principal city. Like some other areas of New Zealand such as Wairarapa and the King Country, the Manawatū in this sense has never had precisely defined boundaries, its extents determined largely by custom and preference. Always included are Palmerston North and all of today&#x27;s Manawatu District, and usually included is that part of Horowhenua District lying north of Levin. Parts of Rangitikei and/or Tararua districts might also be included.

==Demographics==
Manawatu District covers and had an estimated population of as of with a density of people per km2. Feilding, the council seat, has a population of , the only town with more than 1,000. Other towns and settlements include Halcombe, Himatangi Beach, Kimbolton, Pohangina, Rongotea, Sanson, and Tangimoana.
Manawatu District had a population of 32,415 in the 2023 New Zealand census, an increase of 2,250 people (7.5%) since the 2018 census, and an increase of 4,956 people (18.0%) since the 2013 census.

Of those at least 15 years old, 3,390 (13.1%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, 15,042 (58.0%) had a post-high school certificate or diploma, and 6,432 (24.8%) people exclusively held high school qualifications. The median income was $41,700, compared with $41,500 nationally. 2,517 people (9.7%) earned over $100,000 compared to 12.1% nationally.

==Local government==
===Manawatu County Council===
Manawatu County Council was one of 63 county councils that were formed in 1876 when the provinces were abolished. It originally extended from Rangiwahia in the north to Waikanae in the south.

The county greatly reduced by various splits over the next 30 years. Three towns split off to form borough councils: Palmerston North (1877, raised to city status in 1930), Feilding (1881), and Foxton (1888). The northern half of (remaining) Manawatu County split off to form Oroua County Council in 1883, initially unilaterally, as a protest against county authority. Parts of Oroua themselves split off to form separate counties (Kiwitea in 1894, Pohangina in 1895, and Kairanga in 1902). In 1903 Oroua County was officially established, covering the remaining parts after these splits, and also losing Ashhurst (transferred to Palmerston North). The area south of the Manawatū River split off to form Horowhenua County Council in 1884.

===Manawatu District Council===
Manawatu District Council was formed in 1988 when Manawatu County Council amalgamated with Kairanga County Council, itself a splinter of Oroua County Council. The following year, Manawatu District amalgamated with Feilding Borough, Kiwitea County, Oroua County and Pohangina County in the 1989 local government reforms.

For the purposes of representation, Manawatu District is divided into two wards:

In 2021, the council decided to establish a Māori ward from the 2022 local election.

The council is responsible for day-to-day administration and services:
* Animal control
* Bylaws
* Cemeteries
* Community grants and funding
* Infrastructure such as roads, drains, rubbish collection
* Library services
* Liquor licensing
* Property profiling

Ian McKelvie was elected mayor in a by-election in November 2002 and remained in the position until he resigned on 15 December 2011, after being elected to Parliament in the . Deputy Mayor Matt Bell was then acting mayor until a by-election held on 7 March 2012. The by-election was narrowly won by Margaret Kouvelis from Feilding, who beat councillor Steven Gibson by just 14 votes (3293 votes to 3279). Helen Worboys won the mayoralty from the incumbent Margaret Kouvelis in the 2016 Local Government elections.

===Horizons Regional Council===
Manawatu District is in the Manawatū-Whanganui Region, which is governed by the Horizons Regional Council. For electoral and representation purposes, the district is divided into:

* Horowhenua-Kairanga Ward: rural area south of Feilding, including the entire Horowhenua District.
* Manawatū-Rangitikei Ward: Feilding and rural area to the north, and including the entire Rangitikei District.

==Tourism==
The Manawatu district includes both plains and hills, and is visited by cyclists and others for the views of the Central North Island volcanoes on clear days. The western coast has swimming beaches and large dunes, while the Ruahine Ranges in the east has walking tracks and views over the district from the Wharite mountain or from the Saddle Road.

In the middle of the district is Feilding, with its saleyards, equestrian and motorsport venue (Manfeild), boutique shopping and historical landmarks and collections.

The Royal New Zealand Air Force&#x27;s main base, RNZAF Base Ohakea, is in Manawatū.

<doc id="1028587" wikidata="Q2094707" url="?curid=1028587" title="Salim Al-Huss">
<text>Salim Ahmad al-Huss (&quot;;&quot; 20 December 1929 – 25 August 2024), also spelled Selim El-Hoss, was a Lebanese politician who served as the prime minister of Lebanon and a longtime Member of Parliament representing his hometown, Beirut. He was known as a technocrat.

==Early life and personal life==
Salim al-Huss was born into a Sunni Muslim family in Beirut on 20 December 1929. His father died when he was 7 months old. In 1941, he fled with his mother and grandmother from Beirut to Sawfar. He received his undergraduate degree in economics from the American University of Beirut and a PhD in business and economics from Indiana University in the United States in 1961.

Al-Huss was married to Leila Pharaoun, a Maronite Christian who converted to Islam at the end of her life in order to be buried next to her husband in a Muslim cemetery, according to a 2000 interview with al-Huss.

==Political career==
Al-Huss served as prime minister of Lebanon four times. The first time was from 1976 until 1980 during the first years of the Lebanese Civil War. His second, and most controversial term, was from 1987 until 1989, when in 1988 he unconstitutionally nominated himself as prime minister but was recognized by many nations and statesmen of the international community. Al-Huss was chosen a third time to serve as prime minister by President Elias Hrawi from November 1989 until December 1990. He served as prime minister again from December 1998 to October 2000.

During his political career, he served as Lebanon&#x27;s foreign minister, industry minister, education minister, labor minister, information minister, and economy minister.

He was a member of the anti-imperialist conference Axis for Peace. Al-Huss was a strong opponent of capital punishment, and during his term as prime minister he refused to sign any execution warrants, temporarily halting executions in Lebanon, which have remained rare.

=== First premiership ===
Al-Huss was appointed prime minister by President Elias Sarkis in December 1976. His government was formed amidst the ongoing civil war, which began in 1975 and involved various factions, including Palestinian groups, Christian militias, and Syrian forces. Despite his efforts to restore peace, al-Huss faced significant challenges, including renewed fighting between militias and the Syrian army, as well as the Israeli invasion in 1978. The internal political situation deteriorated, leading to his resignation on 20 July 1980, as he was unable to manage the ongoing violence and instability effectively. He was succeeded by Takieddin as-Solh.

===Rival governments===
From January to September 1988, he boycotted meetings of his own cabinet, in protest against the policies of President Amine Gemayel. On 22 September, he refused to accept his dismissal in favour of General Michel Aoun, a Maronite Christian. The crisis was precipitated by the failure of the National Assembly to elect a new president (in Lebanon, the president by convention is a Maronite Christian, while the Prime Minister by convention is a Sunni Muslim).

Since the Lebanese constitution states that in the event of a presidential vacancy, the outgoing president appoint a temporary prime minister to act as president, outgoing president Gemayel decided to appoint Maronite army commander Michel Aoun to that office, notwithstanding the tradition of reserving the post for a Sunni Muslim. al-Huss refused to concede the prime minister&#x27;s post to Aoun, so the two ended up heading rival administrations; with Aoun occupying the presidential palace in East Beirut, al-Huss established his own office in West Beirut.

Lebanon was thus left with no president and two rival governments: one constitutional and the other recognized by many states. However, although Syria, at the time occupying much of Lebanon, supported al-Huss, and although al-Huss&#x27;s cabinet was already operational, most of the international community dealt with administrations on both sides of the Green Line and recognized both as Lebanon&#x27;s prime ministers even though, constitutionally speaking, Aoun was the lawfully appointed prime minister and acting president of Lebanon.

Violent conflict between the two prime ministers soon arose over Aoun&#x27;s refusal to accept the presence of Syrian troops in Lebanon. In competition with Aoun, al-Huss remained acting president from 1988 until 5 November 1989, when René Moawad took office. When Moawad was assassinated seventeen days later, al-Huss reprised his role as acting president for two days, at which point Elias Hrawi was elected to succeed Moawad.

In 1990, the civil war ended when Aoun was forced to surrender following an attack on the presidential palace by Syrian and Lebanese military forces. Al-Huss subsequently resigned as prime minister, in favour of Omar Karami.

=== Final premiership ===

Al-Huss was appointed prime minister after General Émile Lahoud was elected president. His government was notable for excluding many of the traditional feudal leaders and warlords who had dominated Lebanese politics. This shift aimed to create a more technocratic and reform-oriented administration. After losing his parliamentary seat to a previously unknown candidate running with former prime minister Rafik Hariri in the general elections of 2000, al-Huss resigned as prime minister, declaring the end of his political career.

==Retirement and death==
In March 2005, he was considered as a candidate to form a new government following the resignation of Omar Karami (Prime Minister again), but he reportedly refused to accept the position for health reasons; Najib Mikati was subsequently appointed. On 2 May 2017, aged 87, al-Huss took part in a one-day hunger strike in a show of solidarity with the ongoing hunger strike of some 1,500 Palestinian prisoners held captive in Israel.

Al-Huss died on 25 August 2024 at the age of 94.

<doc id="1028589" wikidata="Q3527199" url="?curid=1028589" title="Normal basis">
<text>In mathematics, specifically the algebraic theory of fields, a normal basis is a special kind of basis for Galois extensions of finite degree, characterised as forming a single orbit for the Galois group. The normal basis theorem states that any finite Galois extension of fields has a normal basis. In algebraic number theory, the study of the more refined question of the existence of a normal integral basis is part of Galois module theory.

== Normal basis theorem ==
Let formula_1 be a Galois extension with Galois group formula_2. The classical normal basis theorem states that there is an element formula_3 such that formula_4 forms a basis of &quot;K&quot;, considered as a vector space over &quot;F&quot;. That is, any element formula_5 can be written uniquely as formula_6 for some elements formula_7

A normal basis contrasts with a primitive element basis of the form formula_8, where formula_3 is an element whose minimal polynomial has degree formula_10.

== Group representation point of view ==
A field extension with Galois group &quot;G&quot; can be naturally viewed as a representation of the group &quot;G&quot; over the field &quot;F&quot; in which each automorphism is represented by itself. Representations of &quot;G&quot; over the field &quot;F&quot; can be viewed as left modules for the group algebra &quot;F&quot;[&quot;G&quot;]. Every homomorphism of left &quot;F&quot;[&quot;G&quot;]-modules formula_11 is of form formula_12 for some formula_13. Since formula_14 is a linear basis of &quot;F&quot;[&quot;G&quot;] over &quot;F&quot;, it follows easily that formula_15 is bijective iff formula_16 generates a normal basis of &quot;K&quot; over &quot;F&quot;. The normal basis theorem therefore amounts to the statement saying that if is finite Galois extension, then formula_17 as a left formula_18-module. In terms of representations of &quot;G&quot; over &quot;F&quot;, this means that &quot;K&quot; is isomorphic to the regular representation.

== Case of finite fields ==
For finite fields this can be stated as follows: Let formula_19 denote the field of &quot;q&quot; elements, where is a prime power, and let formula_20 denote its extension field of degree . Here the Galois group is formula_21 with formula_22 a cyclic group generated by the &quot;q&quot;-power Frobenius automorphism formula_23with formula_24 Then there exists an element such that
formula_25
is a basis of &quot;K&quot; over &quot;F&quot;.

=== Proof for finite fields ===
In case the Galois group is cyclic as above, generated by formula_26 with formula_27 the normal basis theorem follows from two basic facts. The first is the linear independence of characters: a &quot;multiplicative character&quot; is a mapping &quot;χ&quot; from a group &quot;H&quot; to a field &quot;K&quot; satisfying formula_28; then any distinct characters formula_29 are linearly independent in the &quot;K&quot;-vector space of mappings. We apply this to the Galois group automorphisms formula_30 thought of as mappings from the multiplicative group formula_31. Now formula_32as an &quot;F&quot;-vector space, so we may consider formula_33 as an element of the matrix algebra M&quot;n&quot;(&quot;F&quot;); since its powers formula_34 are linearly independent (over &quot;K&quot; and a fortiori over &quot;F&quot;), its minimal polynomial must have degree at least &quot;n&quot;, i.e. it must be formula_35.

The second basic fact is the classification of finitely generated modules over a PID such as formula_36. Every such module &quot;M&quot; can be represented as formula_37, where formula_38 may be chosen so that they are monic polynomials or zero and formula_39 is a multiple of formula_38. formula_41 is the monic polynomial of smallest degree annihilating the module, or zero if no such non-zero polynomial exists. In the first case formula_42, in the second case formula_43. In our case of cyclic &quot;G&quot; of size &quot;n&quot; generated by formula_26 we have an &quot;F&quot;-algebra isomorphism formula_45 where &quot;X&quot; corresponds to formula_46, so every formula_18-module may be viewed as an formula_36-module with multiplication by &quot;X&quot; being multiplication by formula_49. In case of &quot;K&quot; this means formula_50, so the monic polynomial of smallest degree annihilating &quot;K&quot; is the minimal polynomial of formula_26. Since &quot;K&quot; is a finite dimensional &quot;F&quot;-space, the representation above is possible with formula_52. Since formula_53 we can only have formula_54, and formula_55 as &quot;F&quot;[&quot;X&quot;]-modules. (Note this is an isomorphism of &quot;F&quot;-linear spaces, but &quot;not&quot; of rings or &quot;F&quot;-algebras.) This gives isomorphism of formula_18-modules formula_57 that we talked about above, and under it the basis formula_58 on the right side corresponds to a normal basis formula_59 of &quot;K&quot; on the left.

Note that this proof would also apply in the case of a cyclic Kummer extension.

=== Example ===
Consider the field formula_60 over formula_61, with Frobenius automorphism formula_62. The proof above clarifies the choice of normal bases in terms of the structure of &quot;K&quot; as a representation of &quot;G&quot; (or &quot;F&quot;[&quot;G&quot;]-module). The irreducible factorization 
formula_63 means we have a direct sum of &quot;F&quot;[&quot;G&quot;]-modules (by the Chinese remainder theorem):formula_64
The first component is just formula_1, while the second is isomorphic as an &quot;F&quot;[&quot;G&quot;]-module to formula_66 under the action formula_67 (Thus formula_68 as &quot;F&quot;[&quot;G&quot;]-modules, but &quot;not&quot; as &quot;F&quot;-algebras.)

The elements formula_3 which can be used for a normal basis are precisely those outside either of the submodules, so that formula_70 and formula_71. In terms of the &quot;G&quot;-orbits of &quot;K&quot;, which correspond to the irreducible factors of:
formula_72
the elements of formula_73 are the roots of formula_74, the nonzero elements of the submodule formula_75 are the roots of formula_76, while the normal basis, which in this case is unique, is given by the roots of the remaining factor formula_77.

By contrast, for the extension field formula_78 in which is divisible by , we have the &quot;F&quot;[&quot;G&quot;]-module isomorphism 
formula_79
Here the operator formula_80 is not diagonalizable, the module &quot;L&quot; has nested submodules given by generalized eigenspaces of formula_26, and the normal basis elements &quot;β&quot; are those outside the largest proper generalized eigenspace, the elements with formula_82.

=== Application to cryptography ===
The normal basis is frequently used in cryptographic applications based on the discrete logarithm problem, such as elliptic curve cryptography, since arithmetic using a normal basis is typically more computationally efficient than using other bases.

For example, in the field formula_60 above, we may represent elements as bit-strings:
formula_84
where the coefficients are bits formula_85 Now we can square elements by doing a left circular shift, formula_86, since squaring &quot;β&quot;4 gives . This makes the normal basis especially attractive for cryptosystems that utilize frequent squaring.

== Proof for the case of infinite fields ==
Suppose formula_87 is a finite Galois extension of the infinite field &quot;F&quot;. Let , formula_88, where formula_89. By the primitive element theorem there exists formula_5 such formula_91 and formula_92. Let us write formula_93. formula_94&#x27;s (monic) minimal polynomial &quot;f&quot; over &quot;K&quot; is the irreducible degree &quot;n&quot; polynomial given by the formula
formula_95
Since &quot;f&quot; is separable (it has simple roots) we may define 
formula_96
In other words,
formula_97
Note that formula_98 and formula_99 for formula_100. Next, define an formula_101 matrix &quot;A&quot; of polynomials over &quot;K&quot; and a polynomial &quot;D&quot; by
formula_102
Observe that formula_103, where &quot;k&quot; is determined by formula_104; in particular formula_54 iff formula_106. It follows that formula_107 is the permutation matrix corresponding to the permutation of &quot;G&quot; which sends each formula_108 to formula_109. (We denote by formula_107 the matrix obtained by evaluating formula_111 at formula_112.) Therefore, formula_113. We see that &quot;D&quot; is a non-zero polynomial, and therefore it has only a finite number of roots. Since we assumed &quot;F&quot; is infinite, we can find formula_114 such that formula_115. Define
formula_116
We claim that formula_117 is a normal basis. We only have to show that formula_118 are linearly independent over &quot;F&quot;, so suppose formula_119 for some formula_120. Applying the automorphism formula_108 yields formula_122 for all &quot;i&quot;. In other words, formula_123. Since formula_124, we conclude that formula_125, which completes the proof.

It is tempting to take formula_126 because formula_127. But this is impermissible because we used the fact that formula_128 to conclude that for any &quot;F&quot;-automorphism formula_129 and polynomial formula_130 over formula_131 the value of the polynomial formula_132 at &quot;a&quot; equals formula_133.

== Primitive normal basis ==
A primitive normal basis of an extension of finite fields is a normal basis for that is generated by a primitive element of &quot;E&quot;, that is a generator of the multiplicative group &quot;K&quot;×. (Note that this is a more restrictive definition of primitive element than that mentioned above after the general normal basis theorem: one requires powers of the element to produce every non-zero element of &quot;K&quot;, not merely a basis.) Lenstra and Schoof (1987) proved that every extension of finite fields possesses a primitive normal basis, the case when &quot;F&quot; is a prime field having been settled by Harold Davenport.

== Free elements ==
If is a Galois extension and &quot;x&quot; in &quot;K&quot; generates a normal basis over &quot;F&quot;, then &quot;x&quot; is free in . If &quot;x&quot; has the property that for every subgroup &quot;H&quot; of the Galois group &quot;G&quot;, with fixed field &quot;K&quot;&quot;H&quot;, &quot;x&quot; is free for , then &quot;x&quot; is said to be completely free in . Every Galois extension has a completely free element.

<doc id="1028595" wikidata="Q4846632" url="?curid=1028595" title="Boylston station">
<text>Boylston station (also signed as Boylston Street) is a light rail station on the MBTA Green Line in downtown Boston, Massachusetts, located on the southeast corner of Boston Common at the intersection of Boylston Street and Tremont Street. A southbound street-level stop for the route of the bus rapid transit Silver Line is outside fare control. The station has two island platforms; each has one disused track, making them effectively side platforms. Boylston is not accessible for Green Line trains.

Boylston station was opened in 1897 as part of the original segment of the Tremont Street subway. Originally used by streetcars, from 1901 to 1908 it also served Main Line Elevated trains. Unlike other Green Line stations, Boylston has been little modified, and retains much of its original appearance. Two of the original four headhouses have been removed, however, and a sub-passage connecting the platforms has been sealed. Construction of a proposed underground Silver Line station was proposed in the 1990s; that phase of the project was cancelled in 2010.

==Station layout==

Boylston was originally configured for four tracks with two island platforms, and the original track layout has remained essentially unchanged since then. The two outer tracks formerly led to the Pleasant Street incline. A stub of the former outer southbound track is used for work car storage. The northbound track has been fully removed; a disconnected segment of track holds two former streetcars for display. The cars (PCC #3295 and Type 5 #5734) were used for fan trips until 1990 and 1998.

The Green Line takes a sharp right-angle turn just south of Boylston station, as it turns from Tremont Street onto Boylston Street. The tight radius of curvature of the track frequently causes loud squealing noises to emit from the train wheels, which are audible at street level near the station entrance at the corner. In 2017, the Green Line added 6 greasing units to the existing 13 in the system; these devices pump grease onto train wheels and the rail as trains pass them. The MBTA also retrofitted flange stick lubricators on newer trains, which scrape graphite onto the side of the wheel and do not affect braking. However in 2018, journalism students from adjacent Emerson College measured sound intensities over 110 dBA in the station.

==History==

Boylston and were the first two stations built in the Tremont Street subway. The subway was constructed between 1895 and 1897, and first broke ground on the site of the current Boylston station. When the station opened in 1897, it became the first underground rapid transit station in the United States.

Boylston and Park Street were built with rectangular stone headhouses designed by Edmund M. Wheelwright that did not aesthetically match the Common. Unlike the interior decor, the headhouses were sharply criticized as &quot;resembling mausoleums&quot; and &quot;pretentiously monumental&quot;. Later stations on the East Boston Tunnel and Washington Street Tunnel incorporated this criticism into their more modest headhouses.

As opened, the inner tracks at Boylston ran between the Public Garden incline to the west and the inner loop at Park Street, while the outer tracks ran between the Pleasant Street incline to the south and the outer through tracks at Park Street. Most streetcars from the west looped at Park Street, while those from the south continued through to North Station. From 1901 to 1908, Main Line Elevated trains ran on the outer tracks (with temporary high-level wood platforms) while streetcars continued to use the inner tracks.

The Boylston Street incline (replacing the Public Garden incline) and Boylston Street subway opened on October 3, 1914, both using the inner tracks. On October 10, the fence dividing the northbound platform was opened, allowing passengers from the west to transfer to northbound streetcars from the south. On October 9, 1915, the fence was again closed, forcing passengers from the west to transfer at Park Street (after cars from the south had dropped off many passengers) rather than at Boylston Street.

The 1947 state act that created the Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) from the Boston Elevated Railway established four immediate projects for the new agency, one of which was expansion of the Tremont Street Subway to four tracks between Park Street and Scollay Square. As part of the plan, Park Street and Boylston stations were to be combined into a single Boston Common station, with a direct entrance from an underground parking garage. The garage ultimately opened in 1961, but the stations were not combined.
The exit-only north headhouse on the southbound platform was removed in 1958, followed by its northbound twin around 1962. On November 19, 1961, the Lenox Street line was substituted with buses. A shuttle service was run between Boylston and Pleasant Street until April 6, 1962, at which time the outer tracks at Boylston were closed. In 1964, the Tremont Street subway, including Boylston station, was designated a National Historic Landmark. Of the two original stations, Boylston retained more of its original appearance, having undergone only minimal changes in over a century of continuous operation. The sub-passage between the platforms was closed around 1968, and permanently sealed off in 1981. In 1974, local students installed nine colorful panels in the station as part of the MBTA&#x27;s arts program.

The northbound outer track was removed in 1983. A planned renovation in 1986 was deferred due to the station&#x27;s historic status, though the disused outer tracks were fenced off. The MBTA again planned a renovation of the station – including elevators for accessibility – in 1990, but did not construct the project. In mid-2006, the MBTA installed brighter lighting at Boylston station, as well as modern electronic faregates and fare vending machines for the CharlieCard system.

Plans for the South Boston Piers Transitway (later part of the Silver Line) were approved in 1993, calling for a bus rapid transit level at Boylston under the Green Line level. This portion was deferred in 1999, to become Phase III of the project. Silver Line service on the surface, running on Tremont Street, began stopping at Boylston in December 2001. After substantial increases in projected cost, Phase III was cancelled in 2010.

In 2019, the MBTA indicated that Boylston was a &quot;Tier II&quot; accessibility priority pending the results of conceptual design.

===Incidents and accidents===

A few months before the station opened, there was a gas explosion at the corner of Tremont and Boylston Streets on March 4, 1897. Illuminating gas had been escaping from an underground main for two months into the cavity between the station&#x27;s roof and the street above, before a horse-drawn trolley caused a spark which ignited the gas. Witnesses reported that a fireball engulfed the trolley, and burned several people and horses instantaneously. Six people were killed, and at least sixty were seriously injured. The station was spared any serious damage, as much of the force of the blast had radiated upward.

On June 6, 1906, there was another explosion at Boylston station. The origin of the explosion was deemed to be the short-circuiting of the overhead lines in the station, which began to burn and catch fire. Because of the electrical nature of the fire, spraying water to stop the flames failed, and fire-fighters who attempted to do so were met with electric shocks. Only three people were injured, and the fire extinguished itself.

On August 4, 1958, a fire in the fuse box of a streetcar at Boylston injured 23 people.

<text>Dana Gillman &quot;Buck&quot; Rinehart (February 24, 1946 – February 18, 2015) was an American attorney who served as the 50th mayor of Columbus, Ohio, from 1984 to 1992.

==Biography==
Rinehart was born in Parkersburg, West Virginia in 1946. Having served in the United States Marine Corps Reserve, retiring as a Lieutenant Colonel, Rinehart attended Ohio State University in Columbus, earning a B.A. in Political Science. He later attended Moritz College of Law at Ohio State, graduating cum laude.

Rinehart began his career as treasurer of Franklin County, Ohio, from 1976-1984. As County Treasurer, he posted a sign at the county building listing the names of real-estate tax scofflaws, the &quot;Dirty Dozen&quot;.

After mounting a failed 1982 campaign for governor, Rinehart ran for mayor in 1983, to replace outgoing Republican mayor, Tom Moody (1972–1984). Rinehart narrowly won the election to become the 50th mayor of Columbus. He won re-election in 1987. Rinehart did not seek a third term after the revelation of his affair with Brenda Dodrill, whom he later married.

His term of mayor was characterized by an intense effort to distance Columbus, Ohio from its reputation (New World Center, 1986; convention center/arena complex, 1987; acquiring St. Louis Cardinals NFL football team, 1988).

In an April 2, 2013, article, the Columbus Dispatch described Rinehart&#x27;s eight years as the city&#x27;s mayor as &quot;tumultuous.&quot; &quot;No idea was too big, no plan too outrageous for Rinehart,&quot; the Dispatch reported. &quot;During his administration, the city built a $28 million Downtown safety building, the Franklin County Solid Waste Authority was established, I-670 from Downtown to Port Columbus was completed, City Center mall was planned and built (and is now a downtown park), redevelopment of the Short North and Brewery District got under way, the Martin Luther King Center was developed, and retail and residential growth began at Easton.&quot; Rinehart&#x27;s leadership lead to the annexation of the Polaris area and the successful development of Southern Delaware County.

However, the Dispatch also said that Rinehart made &quot;glaring mistakes.&quot; One example cited by the Dispatch was Rinehart taking a wrecking ball to what was then the 120-year-old facade of the old Ohio Penitentiary on Spring Street, only to learn later that the city didn’t have permission for demolition.

After leaving office, Rinehart returned to practicing law at Rinehart, Rishel &amp; Cuckler, Ltd, where his clients included powerful business interests. For example, a July 4, 2011, Cleveland.com article reported that Rinehart lobbied for the Ohio Independent Automobile Dealers Association.

Rinehart died from pancreatic cancer on February 18, 2015.

<doc id="1028599" wikidata="Q2903757" url="?curid=1028599" title="Essay of Dramatick Poesie">
<text>John Dryden&#x27;s Essay of Dramatic Poesy (also Essay of Dramatick Poesie) was likely written in 1666 during the Great Plague of London and published in 1668. Dryden&#x27;s claim in this essay was that poetic drama with English and Spanish influence is a justifiable art form when compared to traditional French poetry.

The treatise is a dialogue among four speakers: Eugenius, Crites, Lisideius, and Neander. The four speakers are Sir Robert Howard [Crites], Charles Sackville (then Lord Buckhurst) [Eugenius], Sir Charles Sedley [Lisedeius], and Dryden himself (&quot;Neander&quot; means &quot;new man&quot; and implies that Dryden, as a respected member of the gentry class, is entitled to join in this dialogue on an equal footing with the three older men who are his social superiors).

On the day that the English fleet encounters the Dutch at sea near the mouth of the Thames, the four friends take a barge downriver towards the noise from the battle. Rightly concluding, as the noise subsides, that the English have triumphed, they order the bargeman to row them back upriver as they begin a dialogue on the advances made by modern civilization. They agree to measure progress by comparing ancient arts with modern, focusing specifically on the art of drama (or &quot;dramatic poesy&quot;).

The four men debate a series of three topics: (1) the relative merit of classical drama (upheld by Crites) vs. modern drama (championed by Eugenius); (2) whether French drama, as Lisideius maintains, is better than English drama (supported by Neander, who famously calls Shakespeare &quot;the greatest soul, ancient or modern&quot;); and (3) whether plays in rhyme are an improvement upon blank verse drama—a proposition that Neander, despite having defended the Elizabethans, now advances against the skeptical Crites (who also switches from his original position and defends the blank verse tradition of Elizabethan drama). Invoking the so-called unities from Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Poetics&quot; (as interpreted by Italian and refined by French scholars over the last century), the four speakers discuss what makes a play &quot;a just and lively imitation&quot; of human nature in action. This definition of a play, supplied by Lisideius/Sedley (whose rhymed plays had dazzled the court and were a model for the new drama), gives the debaters a versatile and richly ambiguous touchstone. To Crites&#x27; argument that the plots of classical drama are more &quot;just,&quot; Eugenius can retort that modern plots are more &quot;lively&quot; thanks to their variety. Lisideius shows that the French plots carefully preserve Aristotle&#x27;s unities of action, place, and time; Neander replies that English dramatists such as Ben Jonson also kept the unities when they wanted to, but that they preferred to develop character and motive. Even Neander&#x27;s final argument with Crites over whether rhyme is suitable in drama depends on Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Poetics&quot;: Neander says that Aristotle demands a verbally artful (&quot;lively&quot;) imitation of nature, while Crites thinks that dramatic imitation ceases to be &quot;just&quot; when it departs from ordinary speech—i.e. prose or blank verse.

A year later, the two brothers-in-law quarreled publicly over this third topic. See Dryden&#x27;s &quot;Defence of An Essay of Dramatic Poesy&quot; (1669), where Dryden tries to persuade the rather literal-minded Howard that audiences expect a play to be an &quot;imitation&quot; of nature, not a surrogate for nature itself.

<doc id="1028608" wikidata="Q5281441" url="?curid=1028608" title="Discharge petition">
<text>In United States parliamentary procedure, a discharge petition is a means of bringing a bill out of committee and to the floor for consideration without a report from the committee by &quot;discharging&quot; the committee from further consideration of a bill or resolution. The signatures of an absolute majority of House members are required.

Discharge petitions are most often associated with the U.S. House of Representatives, though many state legislatures in the United States have similar procedures. There, discharge petitions are used when the chair of a committee refuses to place a bill or resolution on the committee&#x27;s agenda: by never reporting a bill, the matter will never leave the committee, and the full House will not be able to consider it. The discharge petition, and the threat of one, gives more power to individual members of the House and removes a small amount of power from the leadership and committee chairs. In the U.S. House, successful discharge petitions are rare, as the signatures of an absolute majority of House members are required.

==In the U.S. House of Representatives==
=== History and process ===
An early form of the discharge petition was introduced into U.S. House rules in 1910 as part of a series of measures intended to check the power of the disliked Speaker Joseph Gurney Cannon (R–Illinois). The modern version, however, was adopted in 1931 by the 71st House. In 1935, the rules were changed so the number of signatures required to force a vote went from one-third of the chamber (145 votes) to an absolute majority (218 votes).

Originally, signatories to a discharge petition were secret. Only once the petition acquired a majority would the clerk announce who signed. In 1993, the procedure was changed to make every step of the process public, with signers published in the &quot;Congressional Record&quot;. This change was spearheaded by then–Rep. Jim Inhofe (R–Oklahoma).

There are three basic forms of discharge petition:
* Directly on an unreported measure. This makes it difficult to amend, which may be considered a benefit or a drawback. The committee to be discharged can circumvent this to a degree by reporting the measure.
* On a &quot;special rule&quot; resolution providing that the unreported measure be recalled from committee and considered. This is the most common variety in modern times; since the 107th Congress, all discharge petitions have been of this variety.
* On a &quot;special rule&quot; resolution providing that a reported measure that was never called for floor consideration be considered.

Once the House acts on a discharge motion, any further discharge petitions on the same subject are precluded for the remainder of the session of Congress (until the calendar year&#x27;s close, normally). This is only relevant if the petition succeeds but the bill is rejected anyway, despite a majority of the House apparently wishing to bypass the committee. If the motion is budget-related, then the Committee of the Whole is convened to amend it.

A discharge petition may only be brought after a measure has sat in committee for at least 30 legislative days without being reported; if the petition is on a &quot;special rule&quot; resolution submitted to the Rules Committee, then the period is seven days instead. Once the requisite number of signatures is reached, the petition is placed on the Discharge Calendar, which is privileged business on the second and fourth Mondays of each month. This layover is waived during the last six days of a session before &quot;sine die&quot; adjournment. At the end of each session of Congress, any discharge petitions remaining unresolved or lacking the required number of signatures are removed from consideration.

Between 1931 and 2003, 563 discharge petitions were filed, of which only 47 obtained the required majority of signatures. The House voted for discharge 26 times and passed 19 of the measures, but only two have become law. However, the threat of a discharge petition has caused the leadership to relent several times; such petitions are dropped only because the leadership allowed the bill to move forward, rendering the petition superfluous. Overall, either the petition was completed or else the measure made it to the floor by other means in 16 percent of cases.

===Usage===
Discharge petitions are rare. A successful discharge petition embarrasses the leadership; as such, members of the majority party are hesitant to support something that would make the Speaker and their own leaders look bad. (Naturally, the minority party will often support discharge petitions precisely to embarrass the leadership.) Furthermore, since the signers of a petition are not private, majority party members are pressured not to sign, and open themselves up to retribution from the leadership should they disobey.

When signing of a petition was secret (or, more specifically, confirmation that it was signed was secret, as a Representative could claim whatever they liked), petitions were generally only used for serious discontent in the majority. The secrecy also meant that members could claim to be for a piece of legislation while at the same time taking no action to force a vote on such legislation. With this secrecy removed, it became more difficult to dissemble in such a way; it also opened signers to more direct retribution from the leadership. Under the old system, if a petition was unsuccessful, the leadership would never know if a particular Representative signed the petition. If it was successful, all the &quot;defectors&quot; would at least be in the same boat. With open signing, the leadership can exert maximum pressure on stopping the last few signatures. Those who make the last few signatures open themselves to especially severe payback, as early signers could argue privately that they were only posturing, and didn&#x27;t think the petition would ever pass. In 1994, a strong counter-campaign from the House leadership helped stop the proposal of William Zeliff (R–New Hampshire) and Rob Andrews (D–New Jersey) of &quot;A–Z spending cuts&quot;, for example; the proposal received 204 signatures, but could not muster the last 14.

The removal of secrecy also encourages discharge petitions that exist merely to take a public stand on an issue. Since secrecy was removed in the U.S. House, thirty petitions have attained 60 signatures or fewer.

===Since 1985===
Successful discharge petitions, in which the process was carried to its conclusion, rather than the bill dying or the leadership allowing the bill out of committee (since as noted above, the leadership has simply relented on some bills with pending petitions) are very rare.

In 1985, a discharge petition was filed on the Firearm Owners Protection Act, known as McClure–Volkmer. The Act was a scaling back of gun control legislation that made it easier for gun shows to operate without government interference. The Senate passed the bill, but House Judiciary chair Peter W. Rodino, Jr. (D–New Jersey) declared it &quot;dead on arrival&quot;. In response, the National Rifle Association launched a strong campaign to pass the bill in the House via discharge petition. Rather than let the Senate version of the bill out of committee, Rodino instead proffered a compromise piece of legislation with William J. Hughes (D–New Jersey). However, the discharge petition succeeded and the Senate version was passed after minor amendments were added.

In 1993, the Discharge Petition Disclosure Bill was passed by the House, which made the rule change requiring public disclosure of signers. This bill was itself filed with a discharge petition. The Balanced Budget Amendment received 218 signatures twice, in 1992 and 1993; however, it did not pass the House.

In 2002, the discharge petition was successfully used to pass the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, known as McCain–Feingold in the Senate and Shays–Meehan in the House. Starting in 1997, several attempts were made to bring it to the floor via the discharge petition. After it finally passed the House, the Senate approved it by a vote of 60 to 40, narrowly overcoming a filibuster.

In October 2015, a bipartisan group successfully used a discharge petition to force a vote on a bill to re-authorize the Export-Import Bank of the United States.

In the 118th Congress, Republicans had a very slim majority and repeated attritions between its factions, some of which occasionally joined with the Democrats (then the minority party) to support certain discharge petition. In May 2024, a Freedom Caucus-headed petition on a disaster relief tax bill received enough signatures. It was successfully enacted after passing the House by a vote of 382 to 7, the Senate by unanimous consent, and signed into law by President Biden. Later that year, in September 2024, a second discharge petition reached the required 218 signatures, bringing forward a bill that eliminated existing provisions that reduced Social Security benefits to some seniors, which passed the House by a vote of 352 to 75, passed the Senate by a vote 76 to 20, and, signed into law by President Biden.

== Related procedures in the U.S. Senate ==
The Congressional Review Act creates an expedited process for Congressional review of executive branch regulations (often used against &quot;midnight regulations&quot;), providing an especially quick timetable for consideration of a joint resolution to overturn a particular regulation. As part of this process, 30 Senators may immediately discharge a Senate committee from consideration of the disapproval resolution by signing a so-called discharge petition; this allows the resolution to be placed on the Senate calendar and receive a vote by the full Senate. While using the same term as the House process, its use in the United States Senate has few similarities to the House process described above and is limited only to disapproval resolutions created under the conditions of this congressional review process.

The actual closest procedure to a discharge petition in the Senate is the so-called motion to discharge a bill or resolution from Committee, which can be introduced by a senator during morning business. After two legislative days have passed (including the one on which the motion to discharge is first proposed), the Senator can call up the motion, which requires 60 votes in order to pass. Due to the high voting treshold, these efforts are hardly ever successful.
The distinct procedure of a &quot;discharge resolution&quot; allows non-controversial measures to forgo a committee and be submitted to a voice vote, presuming unanimous consent.

==In U.S. state legislatures==
Versions of the discharge petition vary widely in U.S. state legislatures. Some use petitions like the House, though others allow a motion to be made to discharge the committee, forcing legislators to vote. The threshold for discharge also varies. For instance, Wisconsin has similar rules to the House; a simple majority is required to succeed, though a motion or a petition are both acceptable. The Kansas Legislature requires 56-percent approval (70 members). Pennsylvania allowed only 30 percent of its members to recall a measure from committee for a time. This was changed in 1925 to a majority, drastically curtailing the number of recalls; still, only 25 (about 10 percent) petition-signers are required to force a motion to be voted on by the floor. Though technically a vote on whether the bill can proceed, the bill&#x27;s supporters usually claimed that the vote was a vote on the bill itself, providing opportunities to the minority party to, at the least, force the majority party to be put on record as opposing a popular bill.

==Outside the United States==
Analogs to the discharge petition in Westminster systems do not exist. Discharge petitions are used to try to get around obstructionism by the majority party, as a last resort to get a floor vote on an Act/bill. Anybody who is chosen in the private members&#x27; ballot can bring a bill to a floor vote in a Westminster system, so a discharge petition process is viewed as unnecessary. Furthermore, parts of the legislative calendar in many countries (Australia, Canada, Germany etc.) are reserved for the opposition agenda, under the control of the Leader of the Opposition and other opposition parties.

<text>The SJ-1 Head Skinner was a single-seat, gull-wing sports plane built in the US by brothers Earl and Jerry Adkisson of Tuscola, Illinois in 1957.

==Design and development==

Earl (&quot;Skeezix&quot;) and Jerry Adkisson, two brothers at Tuscola airport, joined the Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA) in 1955 and began gathering material for their construction project in the Autumn of that year. Their aircraft would be patterned after the P.Z.L. P.24, a popular Polish gull-winged fighter aircraft of World War II.

Using wings from a 1946 Luscombe 8, cut and re-formed into the gull-wing configuration, the cabin and forward fuselage section were formed of steel tubes. A Luscombe tailcone was attached to the aft end of the steel-tube frame, and standard Luscombe tail surfaces were adapted, with their tips squared off. The spring-steel main landing gear was taken from a Cessna. The planned engine was a Warner radial engine, but settled for a Continental A65 driving a Beech-Robey controllable propeller in the initial installation.

<doc id="1028614" wikidata="Q16528" url="?curid=1028614" title="Nelumbo nucifera">
<text>Nelumbo nucifera, also known as sacred lotus, Indian lotus, or simply lotus, is one of two extant species of aquatic plant in the family Nelumbonaceae. It is sometimes colloquially called a water lily, though this more often refers to members of the family Nymphaeaceae.

Lotus plants are adapted to grow in the flood plains of slow-moving rivers and delta areas. Stands of lotus drop hundreds of thousands of seeds every year to the bottom of the pond. While some sprout immediately and most are eaten by wildlife, the remaining seeds can remain dormant for an extensive period of time as the pond silts in and dries out. During flood conditions, sediments containing these seeds are broken open, and the dormant seeds rehydrate and begin a new lotus colony.

Under favorable circumstances, the seeds of this aquatic perennial may remain viable for many years, with the oldest recorded lotus germination being from seeds 1,300 years old recovered from a dry lakebed in northeastern China. Therefore, the Chinese regard the plant as a symbol of longevity.

It has a very wide native distribution, ranging from central and northern India (at altitudes up to in the southern Himalayas), through northern Indochina and East Asia (north to the Amur region; the Russian populations have sometimes been referred to as &quot;Nelumbo komarovii&quot;, with isolated locations at the Caspian Sea. Today, the species also occurs in southern India, Sri Lanka, virtually all of Southeast Asia, New Guinea, and northern and eastern Australia, but this is probably the result of human translocations. It has a very long history ( 3,000 years) of being cultivated for its edible seeds and is commonly cultivated in water gardens. It is the national flower of India and Vietnam.

==Classification==

The lotus is often confused with the true water lilies of the genus &quot;Nymphaea&quot;, in particular &quot;N. caerulea&quot;, the &quot;blue lotus.&quot; In fact, several older systems, such as the Bentham &amp; Hooker system (which is widely used in the Indian subcontinent), refer to the lotus by its old synonym, &quot;Nymphaea nelumbo&quot;.

While all modern plant taxonomy systems agree that this species belongs in the genus &quot;Nelumbo&quot;, the systems disagree as to which family &quot;Nelumbo&quot; should be placed in or whether the genus should belong in its own unique family and order. According to the APG IV system, &quot;N. nucifera&quot;, &quot;N. lutea&quot;, and their extinct relatives belong in Proteales with the protea flowers due to genetic comparisons. Older systems, such as the Cronquist system, place &quot;N. nucifera&quot; and its relatives in the order Nymphaeles based on anatomical similarities. According to the APG IV classification, the closest relatives of &quot;Nelumbo&quot; include the sycamores (Platanaceae).

==Botany==

The lotus roots are planted in pond or river bottom soil, while the leaves float on the water&#x27;s surface or are held well above it. The leaf stalks (petioles) can be up to long, allowing the plant to grow in water to that depth. The peltate leaf blade or lamina can have a horizontal spread of . The leaves may be as large as in diameter.

=== Flower ===
The flowers are usually found on thick stems rising several centimeters above the leaves. They are showy and grow up to in diameter.

Some cultivated varieties have extraordinary numbers of petals. For example, the Chinese variety &quot;qian ban lian&quot; (&quot;thousand petals lotus&quot;) can have between 3,000 and 4,000 petals in a single blossom and the Japanese variety &quot;ohmi myoren&quot; (&quot;strange lotus&quot;) can have between 2,000 and 5,000 petals, the greatest number recorded for any species of plant.

Researchers report that the lotus has the remarkable ability to regulate the temperature of its flowers within a narrow range, just as humans and other warm-blooded animals do. Roger S. Seymour and Paul Schultze-Motel, physiologists at the University of Adelaide in Australia, found that lotus flowers blooming in the Adelaide Botanic Gardens maintained a temperature of , even when the air temperature dropped to . They suspect the flowers may be doing this to attract cold-blooded insect pollinators. Studies published in the journals &quot;Nature&quot; and &quot;Philosophical Transactions: Biological Sciences&quot; in 1996 and 1998 were important contributions in the field of thermoregulation in plants. Two other species known to be able to regulate their temperature include &quot;Symplocarpus foetidus&quot; and &quot;Thaumatophyllum bipinnatifidum&quot;. The red tiger lotus is native to West Africa, including Nigeria and Cameroon, and thrives in slow-moving water.

=== Seed ===
A fertilized lotus flower bears fruit that contains a cluster of 10 to 30 seeds. Each seed is ovoid 1–2.5 cm wide by 1–1.5 cm long with a brownish coat. Lotus seeds can remain viable after long periods of dormancy. In 1994, a seed from a sacred lotus, dated at roughly 1,300 years old ± 270 years, was successfully germinated.

The traditional sacred lotus is only distantly related to &quot;Nymphaea caerulea&quot;, but possesses similar chemistry. Both &quot;Nymphaea caerulea&quot; and &quot;Nelumbo nucifera&quot; contain the alkaloids nuciferine and aporphine.

The genome of the sacred lotus was sequenced in May 2013. A dedicated genome database lists additional genome assemblies sequenced since then.

== Cultivation ==
The sacred lotus grows in water up to deep. The minimum water depth is about . In colder climates, having a deeper water level protects the tubers more effectively, and overall is helpful for better growth and flowering. The sacred lotus germinates at temperatures above . Most varieties are not naturally cold-hardy, but may readily adapt to living outdoors year-round in USDA hardiness zones 6 through 11 (with some growers having success in zones as low as 4 or 5); the higher the zone&#x27;s number, the greater the adaptability of the plants. In the growing season, from April to September (in the northern hemisphere), the average daytime temperature needed is . In regions with low light levels in winter, the sacred lotus has a period of dormancy. The tubers are not cold-resistant, if removed from water, and exposed to the air; when kept underwater in soil, the energy-rich tubers can overwinter temperatures below . If the plants are taken out of the water for wintertime storage (mostly in exceptionally cold climates), the tubers and roots must be stored in a stable, frost-free location, such as a garage, preferably in a cardboard box or container filled completely with vermiculite or perlite. Care must be taken to fully insulate the tubers.

=== Planting ===
The sacred lotus requires a nutrient-rich and loamy soil. In the beginning of the summer period (from March until May in the northern hemisphere), a small part of rhizome with at least one eye is either planted in ponds or directly into a flooded field. There are several other propagation ways via seeds or buds. Furthermore, tissue culture is a promising propagation method for the future to produce high volumes of uniform, true-to-type, disease-free materials.

The first step of the cultivation is to plough the dry field. One round of manure is applied after ten days, before flooding the field. To support a quick initial growth, the water level is relatively low and increases when plants grow. Then a maximum of approximately with grid spacing of are used to plant directly into the mud below the soil surface.

=== Harvest ===

The stolon is ready to harvest two to three months after planting. It must be harvested before flowering. Harvesting the stolon is done by manual labor. For this step, the field is not drained. The stolon is pulled out of the water by pulling and shaking the young leaves in the shallow water.

The first leaves and flowers can be harvested three months after planting. Flowers can be picked every two days during summer and every three days during the colder season. Four months after planting, the production of flowers has its climax. The harvest of flowers is usually done by hand for three to four months.

Seeds and seed pods can be harvested when they turn black four to eight months after planting. After sun drying for two to three days, they are processed by mechanical tools to separate seed coats and embryos.

The rhizomes mature to a suitable stage for eating in approximately six to nine months. Early varieties are harvested in July until September and late varieties from October until March, after the ponds or fields are drained. The large, starch-rich rhizomes are easy to dig out of the drained soil. In small-scale production, they are harvested by hand using fork-like tools. In Japan and on bigger farms, manual labour harvesting is fully replaced by machines.

=== Varieties and cultivars ===
Lotus varieties have been classified according to their use into three types: rhizome lotus, seed lotus, and flower lotus. Varieties that show more than one of these characteristics are classified by the strongest feature. Regarding production area in China, rhizome lotus has the largest area with , followed by seed lotus with .

==== Rhizome lotus ====
Rhizome lotus cultivars produce a higher yield and higher quality rhizomes than seed or flower lotus cultivars. Furthermore, this group grows tall and produces few to no flowers.

Cultivars can be classified by harvest time or by the depth of rhizomes into these types:
* Pre-mature (early) cultivars are harvested before the end of July, serotinous (late) cultivars from September on, and mid-serotinous or mid-matutinal cultivars are in between these harvest times. Using pre-mature cultivars, rhizomes can be harvested earlier and sold for a higher price.
* Adlittoral, deep, and intermediate cultivars are distinguished according to the depth in which the rhizomes grow underground. Adlittoral cultivars range from depth and are often premature. They develop faster due to higher temperatures in surface soil layers. When harvested in July, adlittorals have higher yields than deeper-growing cultivars, but not necessarily when harvested in September. Rhizomes of adlittoral cultivars are crisp and good for frying purposes. Deep cultivars grow more than deep. They are often serotinous and can harvest high yields. Their rhizomes are starch-rich.
The main popular &quot;Nelumbo nucifera&quot; cultivars in China are Elian 1, Elian 4, Elian 5, 9217, Xin 1, and 00–01. The average yield of these cultivars is 7.5–15 t/ha (3.3–6.7 tons/acre) of harvest in July and 30–45 t/ha (13–20 tons/acre) of harvest in September. In Australia, the cultivar grown for the fresh rhizome market in Guangdong and Japan, the common rhizome cultivars are Tenno and Bitchu.

==== Seed lotus ====

The characteristics of seed lotus cultivars are a large number of carpels and seed sets as well as large seeds with better nutritional properties. Roots of these varieties are thin, fibrous, and do not form good rhizomes. The main popular cultivars for seed production in China are Cunsanlian, Xianglian 1, Zilian 2, Jianlian, Ganlian 62, and Taikong 36. The average yield of these cultivars in China is 1.05–1.9 t/ha (0.5–0.8 tons/acre) of dry seeds and weight of thousand seeds between . Green Jade and Vietnam-Red are recommended cultivars for seed production in Australia.

==== Flower lotus ====
Flower lotus cultivars are used exclusively for ornamental purpose, producing many flowers and the lowest plant height.

The seed production of flower lotus is typically poor regarding yield and quality. Flower types differ in the number of petals (single petals, double petals, or multi-petals) and their colours range from single colour in white, yellow, pink, and red to bi-colour, most often of white petals with pink tips or highlights.

The flowers are capable of producing ink used by artists such as Morrison Polkinghorne to produce abstract images of the landscapes of southern Asia.

One example of a flower lotus is Wanlian. Also known as bowl lotus, wanlians are any miniature cultivars of &quot;N. nucifera&quot; sized between . Bowl lotuses come in various colours and numbers of petals, and they bloom longer than other species of lotus. But together with the rhizome, their seeds are often too small or too hard to be edible.

The sacred lotus may be crossed with the yellow lotus to produce interspecific hybrids. A few varieties have been produced with differing appearances.

=== Farming ===
About 70% of lotus for human consumption is produced in China. In 2005, the cultivation area in China was estimated at . A majority of lotus production takes place in managed farming systems in ponds or flooded fields like rice.

The most widely used system is crop rotation with rice and vegetables. This system is applicable if the propagule (small piece of rhizome) can be planted early in the year. The rhizomes are harvested in July, after which rice can be planted in the same field. Rice is then harvested in October. From November until March, the field stays either free or vegetables, such as cabbage or spinach, are planted. Alternatively, the vegetable can also be planted after the harvest of the lotus.

Another alternative way is not to harvest the lotus rhizome, even though it is already ripe. A terricolous vegetable is planted between the rhizomes into the drained field. The rhizomes are then harvested next March.

A third way is to plant lotus in ponds or fields and raise aquatic animals such as fish, shrimp, or crab in the same field. A more efficient use of the water for both, the aquatic animals and lotus production has been identified with this planting pattern.

== Use ==

=== Religious ===

Lotus flowers are widely used as offerings to most female deities, especially Lakshmi, in Hindu temples. Among male deities, lotuses are offered to Vishnu for prosperity and to Shiva for salvation. Garlands made of lotuses are used for adorning deities and lotus petals are used in puja. Lotus seeds are also used in prayer beads. Lotuses are also offered to the Buddha in most Buddhist temples. Lotus is also widely used in Varamala (hindu wedding garland).
=== Political ===

Lotus is the national flower of the Republic of India. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the largest political party in the world with around 200 million active members, uses lotus as its party symbol. BJP, in the past, have used lotuses in multiple colors - pink, white, blue, red and saffron, in their party flag. In recent times, as a part of branding strategy and to make it easier for voters, BJP started using lotus logo in black-and-white in most settings as Electronic Voting Machines (EVM) in India only allow black-and-white logos.

=== Culinary ===
==== Rhizomes ====


The rhizomes of lotus (, , , , Sindhi Beeh, ) are consumed as a vegetable in Asian countries, extensively in China, Japan, India, Pakistan (Sindh), sold whole or in cut pieces, fresh, frozen, or canned. They are fried or cooked mostly in soups, soaked in syrup or pickled in vinegar (with sugar, chili and garlic). Lotus rhizomes have a crunchy texture and are a classic dish at many banquets, where they are deep-fried, stir-fried, or stuffed with meats or preserved fruits. Salads with prawns, sesame oil or coriander leaves are also popular. Fresh lotus root slices are limited by a fast browning rate. Lotus root tea is consumed in Korea.

Lotus root is a popular vegetable in Sri Lanka, where it is often cooked in coconut milk gravy. In India, lotus root (also known as &quot;kamala kakaṛī&quot; in Hindi) is cooked as a dry curry or Sabzî.

Japan is one of the primary users of the rhizomes, representing about 1% of all vegetables consumed. Japan grows its own lotus but still must import 18,000 tons of lotus rhizome each year, of which China provides 15,000 tons yearly.

Rhizomes contain high amounts of starch (31.2%) without characteristic taste or odor. The texture is comparable to a raw potato. The binding and disintegration properties of isolated Nelumbo starch have been compared with maize and potato starch; Nelumbo starch is shown to be superior as an adjuvant in the preparation of tablets. When dried, &quot;N. nucifera&quot; rhizomes can also be made into flour, another popular use of this vegetable.

==== Pips ====
Lotus pip tea is consumed in Korea.

==== Seeds ====

Fresh lotus seeds () are nutritious but also vulnerable to microbial contamination, especially fungal infections. Therefore, mostly dry lotus seed-based products are found on the market. Traditional sun baking combined with charcoal processing dries the seeds but results in a loss of nutrients. Freeze-dried lotus seeds have a longer shelf life and maintain original nutrients, while no differences in flavour are found after rehydration compared to fresh lotus seeds.

Dry stored lotus seeds are sensitive to moisture and mold infestation; researchers continue to explore new ways to preserve fresh lotus seeds, such as radiation processing.

Lotus seeds can be processed into fillings for moon cake, lotus seed noodles and food in the forms of paste, fermented milk, rice wine, ice cream, popcorn (&quot;phool makhana&quot;), and others, with lotus seeds as the main raw material. Traditional Chinese medicine claims that fresh lotus seed wine has thirst-quenching, spleen-healing, and anti-diarrheal advantages after drinking, attributed to unspecified bioactive compounds. Lotus seed tea is consumed in Korea, and lotus embryo tea is consumed in China and Vietnam.

==== Stems ====
Young lotus stems are used as a salad ingredient in Vietnamese cuisine and as a vegetable ingredient for some soup and curry in Thailand, such as &quot;keang som sai bua&quot; (, lotus stem sour soup) and &quot;keang kati sai bua&quot; (, lotus stem in coconut milk curry).

In northern and eastern regions of India, the stalk of the flower is used to prepare a soup, &quot;kamala gaṭṭē kī sabzī&quot; () and an appetizer, &quot;kamala kakaṛī pakauṛē&quot; (). In South Indian states, the lotus stem is sliced, marinated with salt to dry, and the dried slices are fried and used as a side dish. In Kerala () and Tamil Nadu, this end product is called &quot;thamara vathal&quot;.

In the Philippines, an indigenous variety called &quot;tukal&quot; is used as the main ingredient in dishes with coconut milk. The stems and petals can be bought in markets when in season.

==== Leaves ====

In China and Korea, lotus leaf tea () is made from the leaves of the lotus. It is also used as a wrap for steaming rice and sticky rice and other steamed dishes in Southeast Asian cuisine, such as &quot;lo mai gai&quot; in Chinese cuisine or &quot;kao hor bai bua&quot; (), fried rice wrapped in lotus leaf in Thai cuisine.

Vietnamese also use lotus leaves to wrap green young rice, &quot;cốm&quot;, which is eaten in autumn. The leaves impart a unique scent to the soft, moist rice.

==== Flowers ====
In Korea, lotus flower tea () is made from the dried petals of the white lotus.

The stamens can be dried and made into a fragrant herbal tea (), or used to impart a scent to tea leaves (particularly in Vietnam). This Vietnamese lotus tea is called &quot;trà sen&quot;, &quot;chè sen&quot;, or &quot;chè ướp sen&quot;.

==== Risks ====
The petals, leaves, and rhizome can also all be eaten raw, but there is a risk of parasite transmission (e.g., &quot;Fasciolopsis buski&quot;): it is therefore recommended that they be cooked before eating.

=== Use in water treatment ===
&quot;Nelumbo nucifera&quot; shows high potential for usage in wastewater treatment removing polluting compounds and heavy metals. It is able to grow in variable water conditions and in low light intensity. Various studies show the successful use of &quot;N. nucifera&quot; to counteract water eutrophication. The leaves of the floating lotus reduce sunlight reaching the lower part of the water. This suppresses algae growth in &quot;N. nucifera&quot; aquatic systems and thus, the oxygen content is up to 20% higher than in other aquatic plant systems. Due to intense agricultural practices, nitrogen and phosphorus pollution are major problems in aquatic systems. &quot;N. nucifera&quot; is able to assimilate a higher content of phosphorus than aquatic plants currently used for water remediation (such as water hyacinth). It also assimilates nitrogen (&quot;denitrification&quot;) and creates a habitat for bacterial growth in the water body. Through rhizofiltration, heavy metals – including arsenic, copper, and cadmium – can be removed efficiently from the water. The results observed are impressive showing 96% of copper and 85% cadmium metals removed after a seven-day incubation period. The accumulation of heavy metals doesn&#x27;t show morphological symptoms of metal toxicity; however, the rhizome quality for human consumption needs further study.

=== Storage and commercialization ===
Currently, most rhizomes are consumed fresh, and it is not common to store them due to their poor shelf life performance.{ This limits export possibilities for low-income production countries in Asia. Rhizomes quickly lose water, oxidation occurs and nutrient composition changes within a short time after harvest. Optimal storage temperatures range between . There are three different approaches to storing rhizomes. By stacking the rhizomes, they are storable and remain fresh for about three weeks. Special stacking with silver sand and soil results in five to six layers that prevent water loss, thus, the rhizome stays fresh for up to two months. However, the method is not suitable for commercialization but rather for home use. Hydrogen sulfide fumigation reduces enzymatic browning and therefore ensures rhizome quality. Dipping the rhizomes in a salt solution prevents oxidation and bacterial reproduction, which allows storage for up to five months and greater export ability. This treatment is related to the high cost and inefficient cleaning process before eating the rhizomes.

=== Use in bioengineering ===
&quot;Nelumbo nucifera&quot; contains some thermal-stable proteins that might be useful in protein bioengineering processes. The proteins are characterized by seed longevity used for cell protection and repair under stress. There are also several indications that compounds of &quot;N. nucifera&quot; are used in drug fabrication in human health research for multiple purposes. Lotus leaves possess hydrophobic characteristics, attributed to a waxy coat that prevents water from adhering to the surface. This attribute has influenced the conception of the &quot;lotus effect&quot; in biomimicry and engineering, guiding the design of materials that resist water and remain self-cleaning. Researchers at the National University of Singapore have utilized the water-repelling structure as inspiration for developing eAir, an aero-elastic sensor capable of detecting subtle pressure changes or other environmental stimuli.

===Other uses===
The distinctive dried seed heads, which resemble the spouts of watering cans, are widely sold throughout the world for decorative purposes and for dried flower arranging.

In Asia, the petals are sometimes used for garnish, while the large leaves are used as a wrap for food, not frequently eaten (for example, as a wrapper for &quot;zongzi&quot;). Lotus leaves are also used to serve food in various cultures.

A unique fabric called lotus silk, from the lotus plant fibers, is produced only at Inle Lake, Myanmar, and in Siem Reap, Cambodia. This thread is used for weaving special robes for Buddha images called &quot;kya thingan&quot; (lotus robe).

==Chemical composition==
The flavonol miquelianin, as well as the alkaloids (+)-(1&quot;R&quot;)-coclaurine and (−)-(1&quot;S&quot;)-norcoclaurine, can be found in the leaves of &quot;N. nucifera&quot;. The plant also contains nuciferine, neferine, and many other benzylisoquinoline alkaloids with medicinal properties.

=== Health properties and nutrients ===
==== Traditional medicine ====

All parts of &quot;Nelumbo nucifera&quot; are edible, with the rhizome and seeds being the main consumption parts. Traditionally rhizomes, leaves, and seeds have been used as folk medicines, Ayurveda, Chinese traditional medicine, and oriental medicine. In Chinese medicine, seeds are still used as ().

Lotus rhizomes and seeds and their processing by-products are widely consumed in Asia, the Americas, and Oceania for high content of physiologically active substances. Especially in China, lotus seeds are popular with a cultural history going back about 3000 years. As early as the Han Dynasty, lotus seeds were already recorded as sweet, astringent, nourishing the heart and kidney in &quot;Shen Nong&#x27;s Herbal Classic&quot;. Nowadays there are 22 varieties for the four known Chinese lines, which are found particularly in Jianning (still called &quot;the town of Jianlian lotus seeds in China&quot;) and Guangchang (&quot;the town of white lotus seeds in China&quot;).

These days the perennial aquatic herb is gaining popularity because of its nutraceutical and historical importance It will be of economic value if the different parts of lotus can be developed as functional food. Because of its special role in human health and richness in nutrients and bioactive substances, the Chinese Ministry of Health approved the use of &quot;N. nucifera&quot; as both &quot;food and medicine.&quot;

==== Rhizomes ====
The rhizomes are long, in diameter, yellowish white to yellowish brown, smooth, and with nodes and internodes.

Lotus root is a moderate-calorie root vegetable (100 g of root stem provides about 74 calories) and is composed of several vitamins, minerals, and nutrients: 83.80% water, 0.11% fat, 1.56% reducing sugar, 0.41% sucrose, 2.70% crude protein, 9.25% starch, 0.80% fiber, 0.10% ash and 0.06% calcium. 100 g of root provides 44 mg of vitamin C or 73% of daily recommended values (RDA).

Lotus rhizome and its extracts have shown diuretic, psychopharmacological, anti-diabetic, anti-obesity, hypoglycemic, antipyretic and antioxidant activities.

==== Seeds ====
Lotus seeds are mostly oval or spherical, with sizes varying according to varieties. They are generally 1.2–1.8 cm long, with diameters ranging from 0.8 to 1.4 cm and a weight of 1.1–1.4 g. After lotus seeds have been decorticated and peeled, they are edible and rich in nutrients and can be dried for storage. Their nutritional values can differ due to culture environments and varieties.

Not only do these seeds contain proteins of high quality and are rich in a variety of essential amino acids including high contents of albumin (42%) and globulin (27%), they also contain unsaturated fatty acids, carbohydrates, vitamins, calcium, iron, zinc, phosphorus and other trace elements. They also provide water-soluble polysaccharides, alkaloids, flavonoids, superoxide dismutase, and other bioactive components.

Lotus seeds also contain particularly large amounts of vitamins, including VB1, VB2, VB6 and Vitamin E.

The functional components (polyphenols, protein, polysaccharides) in &quot;N. nucifera&quot; seeds can help combat high blood pressure, diabetes, and gallstones.

After lotus seed germination, crude protein and fat levels in the endosperm significantly increase. It is therefore an important method to enhance its nutritional quality.

==Cultural and religious significance==


&quot;Nelumbo nucifera&quot; is a lotus species with historical, cultural and spiritual significance. It is a sacred flower in both Hinduism and Buddhism, representing the path to spiritual awakening and enlightenment. Lotus is closely associated with Goddess Lakshmi and her consort Vishnu. In Hindu iconography, Lakshmi is shown either in seated posture or as standing on top of a lotus flower and holding lotuses in two of her four hands. Vishnu is always portrayed with a lotus in one of his hands. Lotus or Padma exemplifies the path of one who leads a dharmic life. One can stay in the darkness, trapped in the comfort of the decaying leaves and murky water or struggle to lead a dharmic life upholding righteousness, following the light and eventually liberate oneself of his/her past thereby leading a prosperous peaceful happy life. Lotus also signifies moksha. The roots of lotus plant intertwined in mud representing the cycle of life and death and the lotus flower symbolizing the serene blissful state of moksha. Lotus is also used to depict the awakening of Kundalini energy in the tantric system of Hinduism.

In Hindu literature, lotus petals are used as a simile to adore beautiful eyes of gods and goddesses. For instance, the word Kamalanayana (lotus-eyed) refers to Vishnu and it extols his beautiful eyes and praise him for being the one who holds the gaze/adoration of Kamala (Lakshmi).

Epic Mahabharata details the use of multi-tiered military formation that resembles a blooming lotus called Padmavyuha and its disc-shaped variant Chakravyuha in the 18-day long Kurukshethra war.

Padmasana (Lotus Pose) in Yoga and Sahasrara - thousand petalled lotus chakra in tantra are some examples of the use of lotus imagery.

Lotus has also inspired Indian/Bharatiya architecture and can be seen in domes resembling lotus buds, pillars resembling lotus stalk, arches resembling inverted lotus and other lotus engravings in Hindu/Buddhist temples.In Asian art, a lotus throne is a stylized lotus flower used as the seat or base for a figure. It is the normal pedestal for divine figures in Buddhist art and Hindu art and is often seen in Jain art. Originating in Indian art, it followed Indian religions to East Asia in particular. Lotus flowers are also often held by figures.

The &quot;Nelumbo nucifera&quot;, which is also called (Nilufar Abi in Persian), can be seen in many reliefs of the Achaemenid period (552 BC) such as the statue of Anahita in the Persepolis. The lotus flower was included in Kaveh the blacksmith&#x27;s Derafsh and later as the flag of the Sasanian Empire Derafsh Kaviani. Today, it is the symbol of Iranians Solar Hijri calendar. 

The lotus flower is also mentioned in the Bible. The lotus flower also holds cultural and religious significance in Ismaili Muslim and related South Asian traditions. For example, in South Asian Ismaili literature, the lotus is compared to the pure soul. A poem describes the lotus&#x27; beauty, describing how its delicate white petals remain pure and beautiful, despite its murky environment. Similarly, a pure soul is part of this world, yet is not of this world, much like the circumstances of the lotus. The poem further emphasizes the importance of true knowledge or gnosis, which is likened to the pure rainwater that allows the lotus to flourish. Ismaili belief holds that the true guide provides this true knowledge, without which the pure soul cannot survive. Just as the lotus flower would rather die than drink from a reeking swamp, the pure soul also seeks nourishment solely through true knowledge.

In Chinese culture, the lotus is known as “Lianhua” (蓮花). The Chinese characters “蓮” (蓮) and “花” (花) represent the leaves and flowers of the plant respectively. The lotus holds important cultural significance in Chinese Buddhism, symbolizing purity, enlightenment, and the unfolding of the spiritual self.

<doc id="1028616" wikidata="Q1213811" url="?curid=1028616" title="The Killers (Hemingway short story)">
<text>&quot;The Killers&quot; is a short story by Ernest Hemingway, first published in &quot;Scribner&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in 1927 and later republished in &quot;Men Without Women,&quot; &quot;Snows of Kilimanjaro&quot;, and &quot;The Nick Adams Stories&quot;. Set in 1920s Summit, Illinois, the story follows recurring Hemingway character Nick Adams as he has a run-in with a pair of hitmen, who are seeking to kill a boxer, in a local restaurant.

Historians have some documents showing that the working title of the piece was &quot;The Matadors&quot;. Hemingway received $200 () for the story, and told F. Scott Fitzgerald he submitted it solely &quot;to see what the alibi would be&quot; should it be rejected. Hemingway&#x27;s depiction of the human experience, his use of satire, and the themes of death, friendship, and the purpose of life have contributed to make &quot;The Killers&quot; one of his most famous and frequently anthologized short stories, and it has been adapted or referenced in various other works since its initial publishing.

==Plot summary==
In 1920s Prohibition-era Summit, Illinois, hitmen Max and Al enter the restaurant &quot;Henry&#x27;s Lunch-Room&quot;, staffed by George, the owner, and Sam, the cook. They order pork chops and chicken dinners but, learning they are not yet available, settle for ham, bacon, and egg breakfasts. Suddenly, Al takes restaurant patron Nick Adams into the kitchen and ties him up alongside Sam, while Max converses with George and reveals he and Al have been hired to kill Ole Andreson, a Swedish ex-heavyweight prizefighter expected to arrive at the restaurant soon. However, when Andreson does not arrive, Max and Al leave to search themselves. After they depart, George sends Nick to Hirsch&#x27;s Boarding House, run by Mrs. Bell, to warn Andreson about the hitmen. Nick finds Andreson in his room, but is surprised when Andreson does not react to the news, and simply tells Nick there is nothing that can be done to save him. Nick returns to Henry&#x27;s Lunch-Room to inform George of Andreson&#x27;s dismissive reaction; when George no longer seems concerned for Andreson, an unsettled Nick decides to leave Summit.

==Historical context==
&quot;The Killers&quot; was written in the 1920s, when organized crime was at its peak during Prohibition. Chicago was the home of Al Capone, and Hemingway himself spent time in Chicago as a young man. When things became too dangerous for the mob, they retreated to the suburb of Summit, where &quot;The Killers&quot; takes place. Not long before the story was written, the Chicago mob had ordered the killing of a popular boxer of the time, Andre Anderson. His killer, Leo Mongoven, went on the run after the killing in 1926 and was captured following a traffic collision that killed Chicago banker John J. Mitchell and his wife in 1927; Hemingway was probably unaware of the accident as his short story went into print. Anderson once defeated Jack Dempsey, likely Hemingway&#x27;s source for the character of Ole Andreson.

Despite Hemingway&#x27;s knowledge of organized crime, he omitted much of that background from the story. Hemingway himself said, &quot;That story probably had more left out of it than anything I ever wrote. I left out all Chicago, which is hard to do in 2951 words.&quot;

The story includes several instances of the &quot;n-word&quot; as description of the cook, both in the characters&#x27; dialogue and from the 3rd person limited narrator. The cook, Sam, is only in this scene, though he is referred to in a scene that follows shortly thereafter. 

In 1984, Oak Park and River Forest High School in Oak Park, Illinois published the anthology &quot;Hemingway at Oak Park High&quot;, which included short works that Hemingway had written for his school newspaper and literary magazine. One of the stories, &quot;A Matter of Colour&quot;, involves the plot of a boxing manager having a man named Swede hide behind a curtain and hit an opponent during a bout; the Swede fails, and the reader is left with an impression that in retaliation, the boxing manager puts out a contract on his life.

<text>:
Flambé (, , ; also spelled flambe) is a cooking procedure in which alcohol is added to a hot pan to create a burst of flames. The word means &quot;flamed&quot; in French.

Flambéing is often associated with the tableside presentation of certain liqueur-drenched dishes set aflame, such as Bananas Foster or Cherries Jubilee when the alcohol is ignited and results in a flare of blue-tinged flame. However, flambéing is also a step in making coq au vin and other dishes and sauces, using spirits before they are brought to the table. By partially burning off the volatile alcohol, flambéing reduces the alcoholic content of the dish while keeping the flavors of the liquor.

==History==
Modern flambéing became popular in the 19th century. The English Christmas pudding was served flaming in Charles Dickens&#x27; 1843 novel, &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;: &quot;the pudding... blazing in half of half-a-quarter of ignited brandy&quot;. The most common flambé dish appears to have been sweet omelette with rum or kirsch; for example, Alexis Soyer&#x27;s 1846 cookbook, &quot;The Gastronomic Regenerator&quot;, gives a recipe for &quot;Omelette au Rhum&quot;: &quot;...the moment of going to table pour three glasses of rum round and set it on fire&quot;. Ida Joscelyne&#x27;s book, &quot;The Marvellous Little Housekeepers&quot; (1880), mentions both rum and kirsch; another recipe appears in A.G. Payne&#x27;s English cookbook, &quot;Choice Dishes at Small Cost&quot;, of 1882: &quot;Make a sweet omelet, and heat a tablespoonful of kirsch, by holding a light under the spoon. As soon as the spirit catches fire pour it round the omelet, and serve flaming.&quot; Perhaps the most famous flambé dish, Crêpe Suzette, was supposedly invented in 1895 as an accident.

==Procedure==
Cognac, rum, or other flavorful liquors that are about 40% alcohol (80 USA proof) are considered ideal for flambé. Wines and beers have too little alcohol and will not flambé. High-alcohol liquors, such as Bacardi 151 or Everclear, are highly flammable and considered too dangerous by professional cooks. Cinnamon is sometimes added not only for flavor but for show, as the powder ignites when added.

The alcoholic beverage must be heated before lighting it on fire. This is because the liquid is still below the flash point at room temperature, and there are not enough alcoholic vapors to ignite. The vapor pressure increases by heating it, releasing enough vapors to catch fire from the match.

==Effects on taste==
Flambéing reduces the alcohol content of the food modestly. In one experimental model, about 25% of the alcohol was boiled off. The effects of the flames are also modest: although the temperature within the flame may be quite high (over 500 °C), the temperature at the surface of the pan is lower than that required for a Maillard browning reaction or for caramelization.
Whether or not there is a change in flavor as a result of flambéing is unclear. Some claim that because the flame is above the food, and since hot gases rise, it cannot significantly affect the flavor. Indeed, experimental work shows that most people cannot tell the difference. That said, in an informal taste test conducted by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; of two batches of caramelized apples (one flambéed and one simmered), one tester declared the &quot;flambéed dish was for adults, the other for kids.&quot;

==Safety==
For safety, it is recommended that alcohol not be added to a pan on a burner and that the cook use a long fireplace match to ignite the pan.

==Flambé dishes==

Examples of popular flambé dishes include:
* Bananas Foster
* Bombe Alaska
* Cherries jubilee
* Christmas pudding
* Crêpes Suzette
* Feuerzangenbowle
* Flaming beverages
* Gundel Palacsinta
* Kaiserschmarrn
* Steak Diane

<text>Endodontics () is the dental specialty concerned with the study and treatment of the dental pulp.

== Overview ==
Endodontics encompasses the study (practice) of the basic and clinical sciences of normal dental pulp, the etiology, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of diseases and injuries of the dental pulp along with associated conditions.

In clinical terms, endodontics involves either preserving part, or all of the dental pulp in health, or removing all of the pulp in irreversible disease. This includes teeth with irreversibly inflamed and infected pulpal tissue. Not only does endodontics involve treatment when a dental pulp is present, but also includes preserving teeth which have failed to respond to non-surgical endodontic treatment, or for teeth that have developed new lesions, e.g., when root canal re-treatment is required, or periradicular surgery.

Endodontic treatment is one of the most common procedures. If the dental pulp (containing nerves, arterioles, venules, lymphatic tissue, and fibrous tissue) becomes diseased or injured, endodontic treatment is required to save the tooth.

== Procedures ==

=== Root canal treatment ===

Root canal treatment is a dental procedure used to treat infected tooth pulp which would be otherwise extracted. The pulp is the soft tissue core of the tooth which contains nerves, blood supply and connective tissue necessary for tooth health. This is usually caused when bacteria enter the pulp through a deep cavity or failed filling.

Root canal treatment is required when the dental pulp is irreversibly damaged and involves both coronal and apical pulp. Root canal treatment can also be carried out on teeth with doubtful pulpal state before placing post-retained crowns and overdentures. Root canal therapy is not only performed when pain relief from an infected or inflamed pulp is required, it is also done to prevent adverse signs and symptoms from the surrounding sequelae and promote the healing and repair of the surrounding periradicular tissues. An example of this is if there is trauma to a front tooth which has caused it to be avulsed from the bony socket; endodontic treatment is required following re-implantation to preserve the aesthetics and function of the tooth, even though there may be no adverse symptoms of the dental pulp, or pain present at the time.

Prior to root canal treatment, clinical examination and radiographic examinations are carried out to diagnose and plan treatment. Local anaesthesia is delivered to make the procedure pain free. The tooth to be treated is then isolated using a rubber dam, which prevents saliva entering the tooth during treatment and protects the airway from the fine files and strong chemicals used. The root canal treatment procedure can be carried out over single or multiple appointments. Root canal treatment involves:

* Removing the damaged and infected pulp 
* Shaping the entire root canal system 
* Cleaning and disinfecting the entire root canal system 
* Filling and sealing the root canal system 
* Placing a direct restoration such as composite filling or indirect restoration such as a crown

Instrument fractures are common procedural mishaps in root canal treatment. It is essential to prevent instrument fractures. The success of removing a broken instrument depends on the location, direction and type of instrument. A sodium hypochlorite accident can result in long-term functional and aesthetic complications. Extrusion of sodium hypochlorite irrigating solution during a root canal procedure can cause a severe inflammatory reaction and tissue damage. Treatment is provided based on the severity of the injury. Tooth discolouration as a result of root canal treatment can occur if the pulpal tissue remnants are not completely removed or if a root canal sealer material containing silver is used.

=== Periradicular surgery ===

Periradicular surgeries involve the root surface. These include apicoectomy (removal of a root end), root resection (removal of an entire root), repair of an injured root due to perforation or resorption, removal of broken fragments of the tooth or a filling material, and exploratory surgery to look for root fractures.

==== Apicoectomy ====

An apicoectomy is a surgical procedure through which the apex of a root is resected, and a root-end filling is placed, preventing bacterial leakage into the root canal system from the periradicular tissues. A microsurgical technique is used to carry out apicectomy, which improves post-operative healing.

An apicoectomy can be carried out when a previous root canal treatment fails, and re-root canal treatment is not possible. This may be as a result of anatomical features, such as root dilaceration, which can compromise the completion of cleaning and obturating the root canal system. Procedural errors, including ledges or perforations, may also be indications for an apicectomy.

Local anaesthetic is utilised to achieve anaesthesia as well as haemostasis for improved visualisation. A flap in the gum is designed, and then raised to allow for exposure of the periapical lesion. Bone removal (osteotomy) is carried out to enable access to root apex, and diseased tissue is removed at this point through curettage. The root end resection is carried out, removing 3mm apically. The canal(s) is then obturated, and the flap is sutured. There are a number of root-end filling materials available, including zinc oxide eugenol cements, and mineral trioxide aggregate.

Complications that may arise include:

* pain: anti-inflammatory agents or analgesics should be taken
* swelling: intermittent ice will aid in eradicating this. Swelling resolves usually within 24–48 hours. 
* ecchymosis (discolouration): this will often occur distant from the surgical site
* paraesthesia: usually transient as a result of inflammatory swelling, and sensation will return to normal in 4 weeks
* serious infection is rare, but can be treated with antibiotics, which should be administered with caution to avoid bacterial resistance 
* maxillary sinus perforation 

=== Other procedures ===
Other non-surgical endodontic procedures include pulp capping, pulpotomy, apexification, and pulpal regeneration. Hemisection, where a root and its overlying portion of the crown are separated from the rest of the tooth and optionally removed, is another (non-periradicular) endodontic surgery.

== Tools ==
Microsurgical endodontics, the use of magnification devices such as microscopes, and dental loupes, has been widely accepted among endodontists and practitioners; its use is believed to increase accuracy and visualization in the operating field. However, a Cochrane review in 2015 found no evidence to determine whether there is a difference in the outcome of a procedure done by magnification devices or a conventional procedure done with no magnification. The American Association of Endodontists strongly encourages its members to pursue the use of an oral microscope to ensure the highest level of excellence.

The use of a CBCT is also becoming the standard of care.

==Training==
Endodontists are specialist dentists with additional training, experience and formal qualifications in endodontic treatment, apicectomies, microsurgery, and dental emergency and trauma management. Endodontics is recognized as a specialty by many national dental organizations including the Dental Board of Australia, British General Dental Council, American Dental Association, Royal College of Dentists of Canada, Indian Dental Association, and Royal Australasian College of Dental Surgeons.

=== Australia ===
In Australia, endodontics is recognized as one of the thirteen registered dental specialties. In addition to a dental degree, endodontists have an additional three years of postgraduate University training in the area of endodontics to be recognized and registered by the Dental Board of Australia. A general dentist is permitted to perform endodontic treatment, but must be competent in the skills required for the treatment and refer complex cases for specialist management.

=== United States ===
In the United States after finishing a dental degree, a dentist must undergo 2–3 additional years of postgraduate training to become an endodontist. American Dental Association (ADA) accredited programs are a minimum of two years in length. Following successful completion of this training, the dentist becomes eligible to sit for the American Board Of Endodontology examination. Successful completion of board certification results in Diplomate status in the American Board of Endodontics.

Although general dentists can perform endodontic treatment, there are several things which set endodontists apart. Endodontists use microscopes during treatment to better treat the small internal anatomy of teeth without taking away too much tooth structure, or causing iatrogenic damage. Also, endodontists use CBCT (3D imaging) to assess case difficulty and for diagnosis and treatment planning of endodontic cases.

<text>Cleanness (Middle English: &quot;Clannesse&quot;) is a Middle English alliterative poem written in the late 14th century. Its unknown author, designated the &quot;Pearl poet&quot; or &quot;Gawain poet&quot;, also appears, on the basis of dialect and stylistic evidence, to be the author of &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot;, &quot;Pearl&quot;, and &quot;Patience&quot;, and may have also composed &quot;St. Erkenwald&quot;.

The poem is found solely in the Pearl manuscript, &quot;Cotton Nero A x&quot;. That manuscript also contains &quot;Pearl&quot;, &quot;Patience&quot;, and &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot;. None of the poems has a title or divisions of chapters, but the breaks are marked by large initial letters of blue, and there are twelve illustrations (or illuminations) contained within the manuscript, depicting scenes from the four poems. Each of these poems is entirely unique to this one manuscript. &quot;Cleanness&quot; (which is an editorial title) is also known by the editorial title &quot;Purity&quot;.

The manuscript, Cotton Nero A.x is in the British Library. The first complete publication of &quot;Cleanness&quot; was in &quot;Early English Alliterative Poems in the West Midland Dialect of the fourteenth century&quot;, printed by the Early English Text Society in 1864.

&quot;Cleanness&quot; is a description of the virtues of cleanliness of body and the delights of married love. It takes three subjects from the Bible as its illustrations: the Flood, the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, and the fall of Belshazzar. Each of these is described powerfully, and the poetry is among the finest in Middle English. In each case, the poet warns his readers about the dangers of defilement and the joys of purity.

== Genre and poetics ==
A didactic, homiletic poem, &quot;Cleanness&quot; consists of 1812 lines. Alliteration is used consistently throughout the poem, averaging around three alliterating words per line. The unidentified narrator or preacher speaks in the first person throughout the work.
It is an exemplum from the perspective of many.

==Narrative==
The opening lines of the poem (ll. 1–50) function as a peroration in which the narrator states his theme by contrasting cleanness and purity with filth. He also points out that God hates filth and banishes those who are not properly dressed.

A paraphrase of the Parable of the Great Banquet follows in lines 51–171. This exemplum, explained by lines 171–192, follows directly from the previous sartorial metaphor and serves to show why the hearers should give attention to cleanness. Following this, lines 193–556 expound on God&#x27;s forgiveness and wrath, using the Fall of the Angels, the Fall of Adam and Eve (Gen 3), and the story of Noah (Gen 6: 5–32, 7, 8) (the first major exemplum of the poem) to demonstrate these divine attributes.

A transition (ll. 557–599), including a comment on how God reacts to sin (esp. lechery), follows.

In a second exemplum, the poet retells the stories of Abraham and Lot (Gen. 18:1–19, 28) (ll. 600 - 1048), including a description of the Dead Sea as the poet understood it.

In another transition (ll. 1050–1148), the narrator explains the symbolism of the second exemplum, ending with a description of God as strongly vengeful.

The third, and by far the longest, exemplum (ll. 1149–1796) recounts the conquest of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar and the transfer of the Temple treasures to Babylon where they were treated with reverence by the king. But after Nebuchadnezzar died, Belshazzar, a man given to the indulgence of his lusts, succeeded him. During an enormous drunken feast, he ordered that the Temple vessels be brought in and that everyone be served in them. God then determines to punish him. A huge hand appears, writes a message on the wall, and vanishes. No one can interpret this message. At the Queen&#x27;s suggestion, Daniel is called, and he interprets the three words and predicts Belshazzar&#x27;s downfall.

In his conclusion (ll. 1797–1812), the narrator summarizes by arguing that uncleanness angers God, and cleanness comforts Him.

==Author==

Though the real name of &quot;The &quot;Pearl&quot; Poet&quot; (or poets) is unknown, some inferences about him or her can be drawn from an informed reading of his/her works. The original manuscript is known in academic circles as &quot;Cotton Nero A.x&quot;, following a naming system used by one of its owners, Robert Cotton, a collector of Medieval English texts from the Shropshire/Cheshire dynastyof that name. 

Before the manuscript came into Cotton&#x27;s possession, it was in the library of Henry Savile of Bank in Yorkshire. Little is known about its previous ownership, and until 1824, when the manuscript was introduced to the academic community in a second edition of Thomas Warton&#x27;s &quot;History&quot; edited by Richard Price, it was almost entirely unknown. Now held in the British Library, it has been dated to the late 14th century, so the poet was a contemporary of Geoffrey Chaucer, author of &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;, though it is highly unlikely that they ever met. 

The three other works found in the same manuscript as &quot;Pearl&quot; (commonly known as &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot;, &quot;Patience&quot;, and &quot;Pearl&quot;) are often considered to be written by the same author who is accepted to have originated in the Staffordshire/North Shropshire/Cheshire area. 

However, the manuscript containing these poems was transcribed by a copyist and not by the original poet. Although nothing explicitly suggests that all four poems are by the same poet, comparative analysis of dialect, verse form, and diction have pointed towards single-authorship.

What is known today about the poet is largely general. As J. R. R. Tolkien and E. V. Gordon, after reviewing the text&#x27;s allusions, style, and themes, concluded in 1925:

The most commonly suggested candidate for authorship is John Massey of Cotton, Cheshire. He is known to have lived in the dialect region of the Pearl Poet and is thought to have written the poem, &quot;St. Erkenwald&quot;, which some scholars argue bears stylistic similarities to &quot;Gawain&quot;. &quot;St. Erkenwald&quot;, however, has been dated by some scholars to a time outside the Gawain poet&#x27;s era. Thus, ascribing authorship to John Massey is still controversial, and most critics consider the Gawain poet an unknown.

==Technique==

It uses the homiletic principles of education with entertainment (Horace&#x27;s &quot;utile et dulce&quot;) and is primarily rooted in Biblical stories. The reference to the fall of the angels is drawn from pseudepigrapha. The technique of presenting exempla and then explicating them as demonstrations of moral principles is characteristic of many sermons of the medieval period. Here the poet uses three exempla with explication in the transitions between them.

<text>A chronograph is a specific type of watch that is used as a stopwatch combined with a display watch. A basic chronograph has hour and minute hands on the main dial to tell the time, a small seconds hand to tell that the watch is running, and a seconds hand on the main dial usually equipped with a sweeping movement for precision accompanied by a minutes sub dial for the stopwatch. Another sub dial to measure the hours of the stopwatch may also be included on a chronograph. The stopwatch can be started, stopped, and reset to zero at any time by the user by operating pushers usually placed adjacent to the crown.
More complex chronographs often use additional complications and can have multiple sub-dials to measure more aspects of the stopwatch such as fractions of a second as well as other helpful things such as the moon phase and the local 24-hour time. In addition, many modern chronographs include tachymeters on the bezels for rapid calculations of speed or distance. Louis Moinet invented the chronograph in 1816 for use in tracking astronomical objects. Chronographs soon found a widespread use in artillery fire in the mid to late 1800s. Over time, the chronograph found its use to be in several different fields, such as aircraft piloting, auto racing, diving and submarine maneuvering.

Since the 1980s, the term &quot;chronograph&quot; has also been applied to all digital watches that incorporate a stopwatch function.

==History==

The term &quot;chronograph&quot; comes from the Greek ( &#x27;time recording&#x27;), from ( &#x27;time&#x27;) and ( &#x27;to write&#x27;). Early versions of the chronograph are the only ones that actually used any &quot;writing&quot;: marking the dial with a small pen attached to the index so that the length of the pen mark would indicate how much time had elapsed.
The first modern chronograph was invented by Louis Moinet in 1816, solely for working with astronomical equipment. It was Nicolas Mathieu Rieussec who developed the first marketed chronograph at the behest of King Louis XVIII in 1821. The King greatly enjoyed watching horse races, but wanted to know exactly how long each race lasted, so Rieussec was commissioned to invent a contraption that would do the job: as a result he developed the first ever commercialized chronograph. Rieussec was considered the inventor of the chronograph until the Louis Moinet pocket chronograph discovery in 2013 when history was rewritten. In addition to inventing the chronograph, Louis Moinet is also the father of High Frequency. In 1816, his Compteur de Tierces timepiece beat at a rhythm of 216,000 vibrations per hour (30 Hz). This frequency record stood for exactly one century, before eventually being broken in 1916, after which standard chronometer frequencies returned to present-day levels (generally 5-10 Hz, or 18,000 to 36,000 vibrations per hour). Still in perfect working order, the Compteur de Tierces is preserved at Ateliers Louis Moinet.

In 1913, Longines created the 13.33Z, one of the first chronograph movements ever developed for a wristwatch, featuring 18 jewels, a diameter of 29 mm and height of 6 mm, and a beat rate of 18,000 vph. It utilized a crown that was used both for winding the watch and serving as a pusher for the chronograph. 

In 1915, Gaston Breitling produced the first chronograph with a central seconds hand and a 30-minute counter. Later, in 1923, Gaston Breitling introduced the first chronograph with a separate pusher at 2 o&#x27;clock. In 1934 Willy Breitling further developed the concept of the chronograph with the addition of the second pusher at 4 o&#x27;clock. Since then the 3-pusher chronograph design has been adopted by the entire industry.

In 1844 Adolphe Nicole&#x27;s updated version of the chronograph was the first to include a re-setting feature which now allowed successive measurements, unlike the constantly moving needle in the original chronograph.

In the early part of the 20th century, many chronographs were sold with fixed bezels marked in order to function as a tachymeter. In 1958 the watch company Heuer introduced a model with a rotating bezel tachymeter for more complex calculations.

Chronographs were very popular with aviators as they allowed them to make rapid calculations and conduct precise timing. The demand for chronographs grew along with the aviation industry in the early part of the 20th century. As the US exploration of outer space initially involved only test pilots, by order of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, chronographs were on the wrists of many early astronauts. Chronograph usage followed a similar trajectory for many fields that involve very precise and/or repeated timing around increasingly more complicated high performance machinery, automobile racing and naval submarine navigation being two examples. As different uses for the chronograph were discovered, the industry responded with different models introducing such features as the flyback (where the second hand could be rapidly reset to zero), minute and hour timers, Rattrapante (or multiple second hands one of which can be stopped and started independently) and waterproof models for divers and swimmers.

Although self winding watches and clockwork have been around since the late 1700s, the automatic (self winding) chronograph was not invented until the late 1960s. In 1969, the watch companies Heuer, Breitling, Hamilton, and movement specialist Dubois Dépraz, developed the first automatic chronograph in partnership. They developed this technology secretly in an effort to prevent other watchmaking houses from releasing an automatic chronograph first, namely their competition Zenith and Seiko. It was in Geneva and in New York that this partnership shared the first automatic chronograph with the world on March 3, 1969. These first automatic chronographs were labelled &quot;Chrono-matic&quot;.

Many companies sell their own styles of chronographs. While today most chronographs are in the form of wristwatches, in the early 20th century pocket chronographs were very popular.

==Uses==
The term chronograph is often confused with the term chronometer. Where &quot;Chronograph&quot; refers to the function of a watch, chronometer is a measure of how well a given mechanical timepiece performs: in order to be labeled a chronometer the timepiece must be certified by the COSC, the official Swiss Chronometer testing institute, after undergoing a series of rigorous tests for robustness, accuracy and precision under adverse conditions (though these requirements fall far short of the accuracy achieved by even the cheapest modern quartz watch). A simple mechanical watch, without the stopwatch functionality, can be certified a chronometer, as can a clock, for example a ship&#x27;s clock, used for navigation. The terms are not mutually exclusive either, for instance the Omega Seamaster 300M Chronograph GMT Co-Axial is also a COSC certified chronometer

Originally the term chronograph was mainly used in connection with artillery and the velocity of missiles. The Chronograph&#x27;s main function is to allow a comparison of observation between a time base and, before the electronic stopwatch was invented, a permanent recording of the observer&#x27;s findings. For example, one of the first applications of the chronograph was to record the time elapsed during horse races.

Some more important uses of the chronograph include the Langley Chronograph, which is used by the US Navy to record, calculate, and analyse data given off by aeroplane launching catapults. Another famous usage of the chronograph was during NASA&#x27;s Apollo missions to the moon, when each astronaut was equipped with a fully functioning chronograph, the Omega Speedmaster; in one instance, a Bulova chronograph was used. Chronographs are routinely used to record heart beats within hospitals, calculate speed and/or distance on athletic fields, or even as simple timers in kitchens.

==Function==
Chronographs can be extremely complicated devices, but they all have the basic function of telling time, as they are watches, and of displaying elapsed time. Rieussec&#x27;s chronograph was fairly simple. It was composed of two faces, a top and bottom face. The bottom face held a pool of ink, while the upper had a pen-like needle attached to it. When activated, the upper face pushed down on the lower face, while revolving around a central axis, which pulled the needle. This dragged the ink, in a circular fashion, recording the time elapsed by the line of ink that the motion created. There was room left for improvement, because Rieussec&#x27;s chronograph was not easily ready for multiple uses.

This paved the way for the hundreds of patents that have been handed out to people for updating and upgrading this device. Automatic, non-digital chronographs do not require a battery, because the arm or wrist of the wearer creates kinetic energy, which results in the total energy source needed for this device to work. Throughout the day, while the wearer of the watch is walking, the swinging motion of his arm forces a semicircular to turn on a pivot within the watch. The rotor is attached to a ratchet that winds the mainspring in the watch, so that it is ready for use at all times.

The modern day chronograph works by pushing a start button, normally located at the two o&#x27;clock position, to begin recording time, and by pushing the same button to stop the recording. When the button is pushed to start the recording, a series of three (in more complicated and more precise chronographs there are more wheels) train wheels start turning. The smallest has a revolution time of one second, the next sixty seconds, and the final one has a revolution time of sixty minutes. The three train wheels interact with one another and record how long it has been since the start button has been activated.

In addition to the start button, it also features a reset button normally located at the four o&#x27;clock position. When the reset button is pushed the chronograph hand will reset back to zero.

Tachymeter bezels are a complication that allows rapid calculations of speed or distance. Rotating bezels allow for more complex calculations or repeated calculations without requiring a reset of the timer.

==Types==
The original chronographs that Rieussec invented were called tape chronographs. They consisted of a tape that was constantly being dragged along at a controlled speed. When activated, a pen would be pushed onto the tape and begin recording until deactivated.

Specialized chronographs are used by deep sea and scuba divers. While basic functionality is the same as other chronographs, diving models have longer and more practical straps to wear over equipment, are made to be waterproof to deeper depths, have more rounded corners to prevent catching and luminous dials for reading in the murky depths.

Metered bezels: Many chronographs have a bezel, that is either fixed or can rotate, around the outside of the dial that is marked to specific scales to allow rapid calculations. While any wristwatch can have a bezel, the chronograph stop start feature, as well as the rotation of the bezel, allows more complex calculations or repeated measurements for a series of calculations. The most popular meter is for Tachymeter readings: a simple scale that allows rapid calculations of speed. Other bezels feature Telemeter scale, for distance. The watchmaking company Breitling offers a model with a rotating bezel, in conjunction with another, fixed, meter on the dial, scaled for use as a slide rule for more complex calculations.

Flyback chronographs have a timing hand that can be rapidly reset, or &quot;flyback&quot;, to zero. Ordinarily the sweep second hand is stopped to record the time and started again at that spot on the dial, or reset by spinning the second hand all the way to zero again, clockwise. The flyback allows a reading and a quick reset—a counterclockwise flyback—for the next measurement to start at zero.

A &quot;rattrapante&quot;, sometimes called a &quot;double chronograph&quot;, has multiple second hands, at least one of which can be stopped and started independently. When not activated, the second hands travel together, one under the other, to appear as just one second hand.

A &quot;tourbillon&quot;, although not strictly limited to chronographs, is an escapement set in a cage and placed in a rotating balance in order to minimize the effects of gravity on the escapement and increase precision. Because chronograph escapements are generally larger and connect with more complications, a tourbillion in a chronograph will differ from a tourbillion in a more simple timepiece.

Other types of modern-day chronographs are the &quot;automatic chronograph&quot; and the &quot;digital chronograph&quot;. The automatic chronograph depends solely on kinetic energy as its power source, while the digital chronograph is much like the common stopwatch and uses a battery to gain power, as well as quartz for timing.

Other, more specific, types of chronographs include split second chronographs, tide chronographs, and asthmometer chronographs. Each of these chronographs has an added feature that sets them apart.

==Telemeter==
The &quot;telemeter chronograph&quot; allows the user to approximately measure the distance to an event that can be both seen and heard (e.g. a lightning bolt or a torpedo strike) using the speed of sound. The user starts the chronograph (stopwatch) at the instant the event is seen, and stops timing at the instant the event is heard. The seconds hand will point to the distance measured on a scale, usually around the edge of the face. The scale can be defined in any unit of distance, but miles or kilometers are most practical and commonplace.

<text>Hversu Noregr byggðist () is an account of the origin of various legendary Norwegian lineages, which survives only in the &quot;Flateyjarbók&quot;. It traces the descendants of the primeval Fornjót, a king of &quot;Gotland, Kænland and Finnland&quot;, down to Nór, who is here the eponym and first great king of Norway, and then gives details of the descendants of Nór (and of his brother Gór) in a following section known as the Ættartölur, &#x27;Genealogies&#x27;.

The &quot;Hversu&quot; account is closely paralleled by the opening of the &quot;Orkneyinga saga&quot;, which gives a slightly different version of the story and provides details on the descendants of Gór only, including information not found in the &quot;Hversu&quot; or &quot;Ættartölur&quot;. This opening portion of Orkneyingers saga is also known as Fundinn Noregr, &#x27;Founding of Norway&#x27;.

Much of the material in these two accounts is found nowhere else, especially the tracing of many noble families to the stock of giants rather than to the god Odin which is the tendency elsewhere.

The genealogies also claim that many heroic families famed in Scandinavian tradition but not located in Norway were in fact of Norwegian stock, mostly sprung from Nór&#x27;s great-grandson Halfdan the Old. Almost all the lineages sprung from Halfdan are then shown to reconverge in the person of Harald Fairhair the first king of all Norway. Where the information here is comparable with accounts in other sources, it is sometimes confirmed and sometimes contradicted, as would be expected. There are also minor discrepancies and contradictions within the &quot;Ættartölur&quot;. Included also is material on the Danish Skjöldung lineage and the Yngling lineage as ancestors of Harald Fairhair, including the purported line of descent from Adam to Harald.

The &quot;Ættartölur&quot; end with a genealogy of Harald&#x27;s royal descendants down to Olaf IV of Norway with the statement the account was written in 1387, a list of the kings of Norway from this Olaf back to Harald Fair-hair, and a mention of the accession of Margaret, Olaf&#x27;s mother, as direct ruler of Norway.

<text>Diisopropyltryptamine (; also known as &quot;N,N&quot;-diisopropyltryptamine or DiPT) is a psychedelic hallucinogenic drug of the tryptamine family that has a unique effect. While the majority of hallucinogens affect the visual sense, DiPT is primarily aural.

==Hallucinogenic properties==
DiPT&#x27;s effects are primarily aural. At lower doses, Alexander Shulgin reported effects similar to a flanging or a phase shift. At medium and higher dosages, the effect of DiPT is typically a radical shift downward in perceived pitch. This shift tends to be nonlinear, in that the shift downwards varies in relation to the initial pitch. This can produce bizarre sounds and render music disharmonious. There has been an experiment involving subjects with perfect pitch, the goal of which was to determine whether the pitch difference is truly distortive or linear, the results of which indicated that there is no clear relationship between perceived pitch and actual pitch. Aside from these, the most prevalent non-auditory effect is inner ear pressure (which has been painful in some instances, for example when combined with MDMA).

==Chemistry==
DiPT is a derivative of tryptamine formed by substituting isopropyl groups for the two hydrogen atoms attached to the non-aromatic nitrogen atom in the tryptamine molecule.

==Pharmacodynamics==

==Legal status==
===United Kingdom===
As is the case with many psychedelic tryptamines and phenethylamines, it is Class A in the UK, making it illegal to possess or use.

===United States===
DiPT is not scheduled at the federal level in the United States, but it could be considered an analog of 5-MeO-DiPT, in which case purchase, sale, or possession for human consumption or illicit use that is not for scientific or industrial purposes could be prosecuted under the Federal Analog Act. Some of the people arrested in Operation Web Tryp were selling DiPT, however the drug is not explicitly forbidden or outlawed.

However the US Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) withdrew a proposal to ban five psychedelic substances including 4-Hydroxy-N,N-diisopropyltryptamine (4-OH-DiPT), N-Isopropyl-5-Methoxy-N-Methyltryptamine (5-MeO-MiPT) and N,N-Diisopropyltryptamine (DiPT). DEA withdrew the proposed listing as schedule 1 banned substance after a public hearing in 2022.

====Florida====
&quot;DiPT (N,N-Diisopropyltryptamine)&quot; is a Schedule I controlled substance in the state of Florida making it illegal to buy, sell, or possess in Florida.

===Sweden===
Sweden&#x27;s public health agency suggested classifying DiPT as a hazardous substance, on May 15, 2019.

<text>Youri Raffi Djorkaeff (born 9 March 1968) is a French former professional footballer who played as an attacking midfielder or forward. Throughout his club career, he played for teams in France, Italy, Germany, England, and the United States.

At international level, Djorkaeff scored 28 goals in 82 appearances with the France national team between 1993 and 2002. He won the 1998 FIFA World Cup, Euro 2000, and the 2001 FIFA Confederations Cup, also taking part at Euro 1996 and the 2002 FIFA World Cup. He is the son of former player Jean Djorkaeff. On hanging up his boots in 2006 and after having played in France, Italy, Germany, United Kingdom and the US, Youri devoted himself to social projects, which eventually led him to establish the Youri Djorkaeff Foundation in 2014. He currently holds the position of CEO of the FIFA Foundation, following his appointment in September 2019.

==Early life==
Djorkaeff was born in Lyon, to a French father of Polish and Kalmyk origin, Jean Djorkaeff, and an Armenian mother, Mary Ohanian, in Lyon.

==Club career==
Djorkaeff started his career in 1984 with French club Grenoble, before moving to RC Strasbourg in 1989, AS Monaco in 1990, and then Paris Saint-Germain in 1995. In 1994, Djorkaeff led Division 1 in goals with 20. He won the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup with PSG in 1996. In 190 French top-flight matches Djorkaeff scored 73 goals.

In 1996, he signed with Italian club Inter Milan. In his first season, he scored 17 goals in 49 appearances across all competitions, scoring 14 goals in 33 Serie A appearances; with his excellent performances, he helped the club to a third–place finish in Serie A, and also reached the UEFA Cup Final, in which Inter were defeated by Schalke on penalties following a 1–1 draw on aggregate, although Djorkaeff was able to net his spot kick. During the course of the season, he also scored a memorable goal from a bicycle kick in a 3–1 home win against Roma in the league, on 5 January 1997, which is considered to be one of the greatest goals scored in the club&#x27;s history. His following season was less successful individually, as he struggled to play well alongside the club&#x27;s new signing Ronaldo, although collectively Inter finished the season in second place in Serie A and won the UEFA Cup, defeating Lazio 3–0 in the final at the Parc des Princes. In his third and final season with the team, following the signing of Roberto Baggio, he also struggled to find space in the team, and suffered a further loss of form; moreover, the club eventually finished the season in eighth place, outside of all possible European qualifying spots.

In 1999, he transferred to Germany and Kaiserslautern, helping them to the semi-finals of the UEFA Cup in 2001.

Djorkaeff turned many heads when signing with English club Bolton Wanderers in 2002, but added a lot of class to the team during his three seasons there, resulting in the creation of an international &quot;dream-team&quot; alongside the tricky Nigerian Jay-Jay Okocha, and former Real Madrid midfielder Iván Campo. He was a member of the squad that reached the final of the 2003–04 League Cup. He then transferred to Blackburn Rovers but left the club after playing in only three games.

Djorkaeff then signed with the MetroStars of Major League Soccer in February 2005, turning down higher paid offers from other countries. He became the first French player to play in MLS and ended the season as the team&#x27;s MVP with ten goals and seven assists in league play.

Djorkaeff announced from the beginning that he would hang-up his boots at the end of 2006 season, and played for the re-branded New York Red Bulls. On 1 July 2006, he was spotted in the crowd with French fans at the FIFA World Cup quarter-final match between France and Brazil after telling Red Bulls officials he left the club to attend to &quot;an unexpected, serious family matter in France.&quot; Upon his return, he revealed that the purpose of his departure was to be with his sick mother and downplayed watching the World Cup match.

He retired from professional football on 29 October 2006.

==International career==
Djorkaeff accumulated 82 caps and scored 28 goals for France at senior level between 1993 and 2002. Other than the two major tournaments he won with the national side – the 1998 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2000 – Djorkaeff also played for his country in UEFA Euro 1996 and the 2002 FIFA World Cup. In the 1998 FIFA World Cup Final in Paris, he set-up Zinedine Zidane&#x27;s second goal from a corner in an eventual 3–0 victory over defending champions Brazil.

==Style of play==
Nicknamed &quot;The Snake&quot;, due to his ability to get past defenders and bend the ball, Djorkaeff was a talented playmaker, who usually played as an attacking midfielder, although he was also capable of playing in deeper positions in midfield on occasion – namely as a central midfielder – or in more attacking roles, as a creative second striker, or even as an outright striker, while he often featured in a wide role on the left flank at international level. An elegant and technically gifted player, he was mainly known for his flair, dribbling skills, and excellent touch on the ball; he was also known for his vision, passing, composure, and class, and possessed a good shot, which enabled him both to score and create goals. He was known for his positional sense and intelligent movement off the ball, as well as his ability to lose his markers with his attacking runs and create space for himself, or provide depth to the team; he was also highly regarded for his accuracy from free kicks and penalties with his right foot. A hard-working player, who was known for his defensive contribution off the ball, he had the ability to link the defence with the attack or drift out wide in a free role in midfield; as such, his playing style and role has been described as that of a &quot;nine and a half,&quot; half-way between that of a midfielder and that of a forward, which from a tactical standpoint, however, occasionally made it difficult for managers to find the right position for him on the pitch that best suited his capabilities. Moreover, despite his talent and success, he was also accused of being inconsistent at times in the media.

==Personal life==
Djorkaeff and his wife, Sophie, and three children: Sacha, Oan and Angelica. Djorkaeff released a singing single called &quot;Vivre dans Ta Lumière&quot; (&quot;Living in Your Light&quot;). His father, Jean, and younger brother, Micha Djorkaeff, were also professional football players.

On 15 November 2012, Djorkaeff hosted Phone-a-thon for Armenian charity held in Europe. The Phoneathon benefits the construction of community centres in villages throughout Nagorno Karabakh and comprehensive agricultural development in Armenia&#x27;s Tavush Region. In addition, a part of the proceeds will be dedicated to providing urgent aid to the Syrian-Armenian community.

During his time in England, Djorkaeff opened a football school in Armenia. In April 2007, once he had retired as a player, he became the president of his childhood club in Lyon - Union Generale Armenienne de Decines. Djorkaeff currently also runs the Youri Djorkaeff Foundation, a non-profit organisation dedicated to providing football programs in New York City.

Ecuadorian international forward Djorkaeff Reasco was named after him, as did Dutchman Tahith Chong.

<text>The family name Regan, along with its cognates O&#x27;Regan, O Regan, Reagan, and O&#x27;Reagan, is an Anglicized form of the Irish surname Ó Riagáin or Ó Ríogáin, from Ua Riagáin. The meaning is likely to have originated in ancient Gaelic &quot;ri&quot; &quot;sovereign, king&quot; and the diminutive suffix &quot;-in&quot;; thus &quot;the king&#x27;s child&quot; or &quot;big king&quot;. The name was borne by two distinct families: one seated in Meath, the other in Thomond.

The O&#x27;Regans of Meath were a branch of the southern Ui Neill and one of the four Tribes of Tara. Before the Anglo-Norman invasion, they were lords of south Breagh and the north of present-day County Dublin. They took a leading part in the wars against the Danes. In the year 1029, Mathghamhain Ó Riagáin, king of Breagh, captured the king of Dublin, Amhlaoibh son of Sitric, releasing him only upon payment of an enormous ransom, which included the celebrated Sword of Carlus. The O&#x27;Regans were dispossessed soon after the invasion and dispersed through Ireland.

The O&#x27;Regans of Thomond are a Dalcassian family said to be descended from Riagán, son of Donncuan, a brother of Brian Boru.

The unisex forename [[Regan (given name)|Regan]] is likely to have derived sometime later from the Latin &quot;Regina&quot; &quot;queen&quot;, the feminine form of &quot;Rex&quot; (stem &quot;reg-&quot;) &quot;king&quot;, which is also the source of the name &quot;Reginald&quot;.

<text>The Australian Industrial Relations Commission (AIRC), known from 1956 to 1973 as the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and from 1973 to 1988 as the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, was a tribunal with powers under the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (and equivalent earlier legislation) that existed from 1956 until 2010. It was the central institution of Australian labour law. The AIRC replaced a previous system of industrial courts, which broadly speaking, was engaged in the same functions, but with superior independence and powers.

==History==

===Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration and the &quot;Boilermakers″&quot; decision===
The Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, a court created in 1904 to hear and arbitrate industrial disputes, and to make awards, was abolished in 1956 following the decision of the High Court in &quot;the Boilermakers&#x27; case&quot;. The High Court held that the Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, as a tribunal exercising the non-judicial power of arbitration, could not also exercise judicial power as a Chapter III Court. The decision became an important demonstration of the separation of powers in Australia.

===Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission===
Following the decision, two new bodies were created to emulate the function of the defunct court; the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission was created to carry out the non-judicial functions, and the Commonwealth Industrial Court (which would later be subsumed into the Federal Court of Australia) was created to exercise judicial powers.

Throughout its time the Commission created Awards which covered a whole raft of industries. These Awards with Awards made by Industrial Relations Commissions of the respective six states of Australia acted as the unique system of minimum wage setting in Australia. The Commission also registered a large number of trade unions to assist in the Award formation process.

The Commission is famous for its cases on equal work and equal pay, as well as decisions on unfair dismissal, and redundancy pay.

One issue which dogged the Commission was that of what &quot;pertained to the relationship between employer and employee&quot;. This had been a question of importance, since the Constitution required the Commission settle industrial disputes. These disputes were later categorised as a &quot;dispute about matters which pertained to the relationship between employer and employee.&quot; The question continued to surface and in 2004 the High Court of Australia in the case of Electrolux v AWU applied the question (which had historically been applied to Awards) to Enterprise Bargaining Agreements. This led to around 6 months of industrial confusion until the Australian Industrial Relations Commission handed down the landmark decision of the Schefenacker, the Murray Bridge and the La Trobe University certified agreements (&#x27;the three certified agreements case&#x27;). It was seen by some as fitting that the last significant decision made by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission was to conclusively determine which matter did or did not pertain.

== Role==

From 1956 to 2006 the Australian Industrial Relations Commission (under its various names) made awards which set the minimum terms and conditions of employment for workers who worked for certain employers or within certain industries. A standard award would have approximately 20–30 conditions and would be around 40 pages in length. The Awards were reviewed periodically.

The AIRC would also certify enterprise bargaining agreements. These agreements were negotiated collective contracts commonly between a union (as representative of the employees on a site) and an employer of the site.

The AIRC also registered trade unions and dealt with demarcation disputes between unions.

Finally, the AIRC dealt with unfair dismissal applications.

==WorkChoices and abolition==

In 2006, under the WorkChoices laws effected at the end of 2005, the role of the AIRC was redefined. Its wage-setting powers were largely transferred to the Australian Fair Pay Commission. The AIRC&#x27;s primary role instead became that of award &quot;modernisation&quot;, with limited dispute-settling powers, and hearing of unfair dismissal applications.

Under the Rudd Labor Government the AIRC was abolished. Its functions were transferred in January 2010 to a division within Fair Work Australia (now the Fair Work Commission).

<doc id="1028661" wikidata="Q5126498" url="?curid=1028661" title="Clarence Earl Gideon">
<text>Clarence Earl Gideon (August 30, 1910 – January 18, 1972) was an impoverished American drifter accused in a Florida state court of felony breaking and entering. While in prison, he appealed his case to the U.S. Supreme Court, resulting in the landmark 1963 decision &quot;Gideon v. Wainwright&quot; holding that a criminal defendant who cannot afford to hire a lawyer must be provided one at no cost.

At Gideon&#x27;s first trial in August 1961, he was denied legal counsel and was forced to represent himself, and was convicted. After the Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Gideon v. Wainwright&quot; that the state had to provide defense counsel in criminal cases at no cost to the indigent, Florida retried Gideon. At his second trial, which took place in August 1963, with a court-appointed lawyer representing him and bringing out for the jury the weaknesses in the prosecution&#x27;s case, Gideon was acquitted.

==Early life==
Clarence Earl Gideon was born in Hannibal, Missouri. His father, Charles Roscoe Gideon, died when he was three. His mother, Virginia Gregory Gideon, married Marrion Anderson shortly after. Gideon, after years of defiant behavior and chronic truancy, quit school after eighth grade, aged 14, and ran away from home, becoming a homeless drifter. By the time he was sixteen, Gideon had begun compiling a petty crime profile.

He was arrested in Missouri and charged with robbery, burglary, and larceny. Gideon was sentenced to 10 years but released after three, in 1932, as the Great Depression was beginning.

Gideon spent most of the next three decades in poverty. He served additional prison terms at Leavenworth, Kansas, for stealing government property; in Missouri for stealing, larceny, and escape; and in Texas three times for theft.

Between his prison terms, Gideon was married four times. The first three marriages ended quickly, but the fourth to Ruth Ada Babineaux in October 1955 endured. They settled in Orange, Texas, in the mid-1950s. Gideon found irregular work as a tugboat laborer and bartender until he was bedridden by tuberculosis for three years.

In addition to the three children that Ruth already had, Gideon and Ruth had three others, born in 1956, 1957, and 1959: the first two in Orange, the third after the family had moved to Panama City, Florida. The six children were later removed by welfare authorities. Gideon worked as an electrician in Florida but began gambling for money. He did not serve more time in jail until 1961.

==Arrest and trial==

===Arrest===
On June 3, 1961, $5 (~$50 in 2023 based on inflation ) in change and a few bottles of beer and Coca-Cola were stolen from the Pool Room, a pool hall and beer bar that belonged to Ira Strickland Jr. Strickland also alleged that $50 was taken from the jukebox ($437 in 2022 terms). Henry Cook, a 22-year-old resident who lived nearby, told the police that he had seen Gideon walk out of the bar with a bottle of wine and his pockets filled with coins, and then get into a cab. Gideon was later arrested at a tavern.

===First trial===
Too poor to afford counsel, Gideon was forced to defend himself at his trial after being denied a lawyer by the trial judge, Robert McCrary Jr. At the time, Florida law only gave indigent defendants no-cost legal counsel in death penalty cases. On August 4, 1961, Gideon was convicted of breaking with intent to commit petty larceny, and on August 25, Judge McCrary gave Gideon the maximum sentence, five years in state prison.

===&quot;Gideon v. Wainwright&quot;===
While incarcerated, Gideon studied the American legal system. He concluded that Judge McCrary had violated his constitutional right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, applicable to Florida through the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. He then wrote to an FBI office in Florida and then to the Florida Supreme Court, but was denied assistance. In January 1962, he mailed a five-page petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States, asking the nine justices to consider his case. The Supreme Court agreed to hear his appeal. The case was originally called &quot;Gideon v. Cochran&quot; and was argued on January 15, 1963. &quot;Gideon v. Cochran&quot; was changed to &quot;Gideon v. Wainwright&quot; after Louie L. Wainwright replaced H. G. Cochran as the director of the Florida Department of Corrections.

Abe Fortas (later a Supreme Court justice himself) was assigned to represent Gideon. Florida Assistant Attorney General Bruce Jacob was assigned to argue against Gideon. Fortas argued that a common man with no training in law could not go up against a trained lawyer and win, and that &quot;you cannot have a fair trial without counsel.&quot; Jacob argued that the issue at hand was a state issue, not federal; the practice of only appointing counsel under &quot;special circumstances&quot; in non-capital cases sufficed; that thousands of convictions would have to be thrown out if it were changed; and that Florida had followed for 21 years &quot;in good faith&quot; the 1942 Supreme Court ruling in &quot;Betts v. Brady&quot;.

The Supreme Court ruled unanimously in Gideon&#x27;s favor in a landmark decision on March 18, 1963.

===Second trial===
About 2,000 convicted persons in Florida alone were freed as a result of the &quot;Gideon&quot; decision; however, Gideon himself was to receive a retrial.

After the decision, Abe Fortas wrote to Gideon suggesting that a Florida lawyer represent him for his retrial in a Florida court. Fortas arranged for a lawyer from Miami who worked with the Florida Civil Liberties Union, and this lawyer also recruited a second Miami lawyer who was an experienced criminal lawyer.

However, in the court of Judge Robert McCrary in Panama City, Gideon said he did not want the Miami lawyers. Asked who he wanted, he said he wanted local lawyer Fred Turner. Turner agreed, and the judge scheduled the retrial for one month later on August 5, 1963 (this would be five months after the Supreme Court decision). Judge McCrary also offered to release him on $1,000 bail, but Gideon could not raise the money.

During the trial, Turner brought out that eyewitness Henry Cook had lied in the first trial about not having a criminal conviction. Turner also asked, &quot;Why did they put you off two blocks from your home when they&#x27;d driven you sixty miles?&quot; And in his closing statement, Turner suggested that Cook had likely been the lookout for a group of young men who had stolen the beer and coins from the Bay Harbor Pool Room. (Turner had in fact been Cook&#x27;s lawyer in previous cases.)

Police Detective Duell Pitts referred to his notes and stated that the following had been stolen from the Bay Harbor Poolroom: 4 fifths of wine, 12 bottles of Coca-Cola, 12 cans of beer, approximately $5 from the cigarette machine, and approximately $60 from the juke box. All of the money was in coins. Detective Pitts stated that Gideon had approximately $25 of coins on him when arrested.

Turner also received a statement from the cab driver who transported Gideon from the phone booth outside Henderson&#x27;s Grocery &amp; Market to a bar in Panama City, stating that Gideon was carrying neither wine, beer, nor Coca-Cola when he picked him up, even though Cook testified that he watched Gideon walk from the pool hall to the phone, then wait for a cab. However, the driver did testify that Gideon paid for the ride with six quarters.

The Prosecution brought out that Gideon had said to the cab driver, &quot;If anyone asks where you left me off, you don&#x27;t know, you haven&#x27;t seen me.&quot; The Defense brought out that Gideon had said the same thing on other occasions, with the cab driver stating, &quot;I understand it was his wife — he had trouble with his wife.&quot; This second part had not been brought out in the first trial.

The jury acquitted Gideon after an hour of deliberation.

Anthony Lewis wrote, &quot;Gideon&#x27;s insistence on having a local lawyer — Fred Turner — may well have won the case for him. It is doubtful that the Civil Liberties Union lawyers from Miami could have been so effective with a Panama City jury.

===Children===

Abe Fortas asked Gideon to send him an autobiographical letter. In response, Gideon wrote a 22-page, hand-printed letter on prison stationery, with a major concern expressed in the letter being for the well-being and custody of his children.

In the letter, Gideon wrote that although the Florida state welfare agency temporarily provided a lesser amount, they did not provide the regular, ongoing amount of child welfare because both he and his wife had criminal records. A local church provided some additional help. And while Gideon and his wife were separated, he had an arrangement with a Florida welfare agency for him to provide $45 a week, which was then transferred to his family.

Gideon concluded his letter by writing, &quot;Thank you for reading all of this. Please try to believe that all I want now from life is the chance for the love of my children the only real love I have ever had.&quot;

Gideon&#x27;s half-brother, who was a sergeant in the U.S. Air Force, moving back home from Japan, adopted the children.

===Legacy===
In 1963, then United States Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy remarked about the case:
==Later life==
After his acquittal, Gideon resumed his previous way of life and later married for the fifth time. He died of cancer in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on January 18, 1972, at age 61. Gideon&#x27;s family had him buried in an unmarked grave in Hannibal. The local chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union later added a granite headstone.

==Portrayal on film==
Gideon was portrayed by Henry Fonda in the 1980 made-for-television film &quot;Gideon&#x27;s Trumpet&quot;, based on Anthony Lewis&#x27; book of the same name. The film was the first telecast as part of the &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot; anthology series, and co-starred José Ferrer as Abe Fortas, the attorney who pleaded Gideon&#x27;s right to have a lawyer in the US Supreme Court. Fonda was nominated for an Emmy Award for his portrayal of Gideon.

<doc id="1028666" wikidata="Q1245253" url="?curid=1028666" title="Florida Parishes">
<text>The Florida Parishes, on the east side of the Mississippi River—an area also known as the Northshore or Northlake region—are eight parishes in the southeastern portion of the U.S. state of Louisiana. 

The Florida Parishes were part of what was known as West Florida in the 18th and early 19th centuries. Unlike most of the state, this region was not part of the 1803 Louisiana Purchase, which applied to territory west of the Mississippi River. First settled by the French, it was ceded to Great Britain in 1763 after France&#x27;s defeat in the Seven Years&#x27; War. The British exchanged it with Spain following the American Revolutionary War for territory outside North America. This area was acquired by the U.S. in 1812 and combined with the new state of Louisiana. 

==History==
In terms of historical European influence, the area that became the Florida Parishes was first claimed by French colonists as part of &quot;Louisiane&quot; or French Louisiana. The French settled New Orleans, Mobile (now within Alabama), and founded numerous other settlements. 

Following the French defeat in the French and Indian War, as the North American front of the Seven Years&#x27; War was known, France withdrew from North America, ceding the eastern half of French Louisiana — the land from the Mississippi River to the Appalachian Mountains, excluding New Orleans — to Great Britain in the 1763 Treaty of Paris. (France had previously transferred New Orleans and its lands west of the Mississippi to Spain in the 1762 Treaty of Fontainebleau, although Spain did not fully take control until after the Louisiana Rebellion of 1768.) Spain also ceded Florida to Britain under the treaty. 

To administer the new territory along the Gulf of Mexico, Britain divided it at the Apalachicola River into two new colonial provinces, East and West Florida. However, following the American Revolutionary War, Britain ceded its Florida territories back to Spain, but uncertainty around the territories&#x27; borders sparked the West Florida Controversy, a territorial dispute with the newly formed United States. Pinckney&#x27;s Treaty of 1795 settled the initial dispute, but the sale of Louisiana by France in 1803 raised new questions about West Florida. The Third Treaty of San Ildefonso and the subsequent Treaty of Aranjuez that restored French control over Louisiana did not include Spanish West Florida, leaving the territory outside of the land acquired by the U.S. in the Louisiana Purchase. 

Aggrieved by the provincial Spanish government, American and British settlers in the part of West Florida west of the Pearl River declared an independent Republic of West Florida in 1810 and elected their leader, Fulwar Skipwith, as governor. None of this short-lived Republic of West Florida lay within the boundaries of the modern U.S. state of Florida.

The flag of the Republic of West Florida, which was later identified with the Confederates&#x27; Bonnie Blue Flag of the Civil War era, continues to be flown on many public buildings in the Florida Parishes. In 2006, the state legislature designated it the &quot;official flag of the Republic of West Florida Historic Region.&quot;

The republic was quickly and forcibly annexed by the United States, and the present-day Florida Parishes were incorporated into the Territory of Orleans, which joined the Union as the U.S. state of Louisiana in 1812. In 1810, four parishes were established in the region: East Baton Rouge, Feliciana, St. Helena, and St. Tammany. 

Later in the 19th century, five additional parishes were created as follows, with Feliciana Parish ceasing to exist: Washington Parish, 1819, from part of St. Tammany Parish; East Feliciana and West Feliciana parishes, 1824, by dividing Feliciana Parish; Livingston Parish, 1832, from part of St. Helena Parish; and Tangipahoa Parish, 1869 during the Reconstruction era, from parts of Livingston, St. Helena, St. Tammany, and Washington parishes.

In 1990, Louisiana&#x27;s legislature formally designated this part of the state as &quot;the Republic of West Florida Historic Region, or the Florida Parishes.&quot; Since 1993, Interstate 12, which runs east and west through the Northshore region, has been officially designated as the Republic of West Florida Parkway.

==Geography==
The Florida Parishes of Louisiana stretch from the Mississippi state line on its eastern and northern borders to the Mississippi River on its western border, and Lake Pontchartrain on its southern border. The most populated urban area is the Baton Rouge metropolitan statistical area. St. Tammany Parish is part of the New Orleans metropolitan area. The parishes have a land area of , or 10.755% of the state&#x27;s total land area.

=== Parishes ===

* East Baton Rouge Parish
* East Feliciana Parish
* Livingston Parish
* St. Helena Parish
* St. Tammany Parish
* Tangipahoa Parish
* Washington Parish
* West Feliciana Parish
=== Climate ===
The Florida Parishes (in common with Greater New Orleans and Acadiana) has a humid subtropical climate, prone to hurricanes. Many parts of the Florida Parishes and parts of Acadiana flooded during the 2016 floods. During Hurricane Katrina, both regions were used as evacuation areas for residents of Greater New Orleans.

==Demographics==
The population of the Florida Parishes at the 2010 census was 1,019,357 residents, or 22.49% of the state&#x27;s population at that time. Its largest communities are, in descending order of population (2010 U.S. census), Baton Rouge, Slidell, Central, Hammond, Shenandoah (CDP), Zachary, Baker, Bogalusa, Mandeville, Gardere (CDP), Merrydale (CDP), Denham Springs, Covington, Lacombe (CDP), and Oak Hills Place (CDP). Tabulating the 2019 census estimates, the Florida Parishes had a population of 1,067,634, making it the third largest region by population following Acadiana (1,490,449) and Greater New Orleans (1,507,017); in 2020, the tabulated population of the Florida Parishes was 1,088,014.

=== Race and ethnicity ===
Common among South Louisiana and in contrast with the U.S. Census Bureau&#x27;s publications, a substantial portion of the region&#x27;s population, spanning a range of racial groups, identify ethnically and/or culturally as Cajun or Louisiana Creole. Nearby Acadiana and Greater New Orleans, however, have more Cajuns and Louisiana Creoles as those regions are epicenters of Acadian and multiracial Louisiana heritage.

=== Religion ===

While Greater New Orleans and Acadiana are historically and predominantly Roman Catholic, the Florida Parishes are greatly influenced by Protestantism through British colonialism and missionary efforts, in addition to American settlement. In contrast with North and Central Louisiana, however, the Florida Parishes region is still dominated by the Roman Catholic Church as its single-largest Christian denomination. The second-largest overall denominational tradition in the region (especially Greater Baton Rouge) are Baptists. Baptists form the largest overall Protestant majority within Louisiana according to the Pew Research Center&#x27;s 2014 study, spread among the Southern Baptist Convention—established in separation from the Northern Baptists (today the American Baptist Churches USA) over Southern white clergy and laymen&#x27;s justifications of slavery—and the National Baptist Convention, USA which formed out of many black Baptist bodies leaving the Southern Baptists and white supervision.

<doc id="1028671" wikidata="Q5267205" url="?curid=1028671" title="Devil's Playground (2002 film)">
<text>Devil&#x27;s Playground is a 2002 American documentary film directed by Lucy Walker about the experiences of several Amish youths who decide whether to remain in or leave their community and faith during the period known as &quot;rumspringa&quot; (&quot;running around&quot; in Pennsylvania Dutch). The film follows a few Amish teenagers in LaGrange County, Indiana who enter the &quot;English&quot; (non-Amish) world and experience partying, drinking, illegal drugs, and pre-marital sex. Some teens in the film profess that they will eventually become baptized as adults in the Amish community. If they are baptized, then leave the church, they will be shunned by family and friends; one girl recounts her experience of this.

==Synopsis==

According to &quot;Devil&#x27;s Playground&quot;, at the age of 16, Amish youth are allowed to depart from many of the Amish rules. The young people sample life outside of the Amish community. Many drive cars, wear modern clothes and cut and style their hair in more fashionable styles, get jobs, have romantic and sexual relationships, and some experiment with drugs.

One Amish youth whom the film follows, Faron—a preacher&#x27;s son—turns to drug dealing to satisfy his habit. Faron is eventually apprehended by the authorities; he aids them in arresting another dealer. Each of the film&#x27;s subjects faces a variety of challenges and pressures from both the &quot;English World&quot; and the &quot;Amish World&quot; of their families. Some make the commitment to return to their communities, others do not. One girl is baptized but later leaves the Amish church, resulting in her family shunning her.

According to the documentary, &quot;over 90%&quot; of Amish youth decide to join the church, returning to their communities and families.

==Reception==
The film won the 2001 Sony/AFI DVCam Fest
Documentary Category and overall Grand Prize,
the 2001 Sarasota Film Festival Audience Award for Best Documentary,
and a Jury&#x27;s Special Mention in the Documentary Category in the 2002 Karlovy Vary International Film Festival (Czech Republic).
The film was nominated by jury for Best Documentary for the 2003 IFP&#x27;s Independent Spirit Awards. 
After being aired on Cinemax as part of the series &quot;Cinemax Reel Life&quot;, it was also nominated for three 2002 News and Documentary Emmy Swards: &quot;Best Documentary&quot;, &quot;Outstanding Individual Achievement in a Craft: Direction&quot;, and &quot;Outstanding Individual Achievement in a Craft: Editing.&quot;

Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 56% of nine surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating was 6.4/10. Dennis Harvey of &quot;Variety&quot; stated, &quot;To filmmaker Lucy Walker&#x27;s credit, results transcend their sensational first impression, thanks to empathetic focus on a few select kids going through enormous changes&quot;, and summed it up as &quot;engrossing.&quot;
&quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; critic Kenneth Turan called it &quot;one of the best documentaries in the (Sundance) festival&quot;. He wrote that the film deals in a poignant way with &quot;rumspringa&quot;. &quot;This examination of the life-changing question one teen calls &#x27;to be or not to be Amish&#x27; is haunting, provocative and unexpected.&quot;
&quot;Film Threat&quot;″s Anthony Miele found the film &quot;interesting and informative&quot;, but it &quot;alludes to &#x27;document&#x27; an entire sub-culture of a particular society, but [...] simply follows one troubled youth, Faron.&quot;

<doc id="1028689" wikidata="Q783089" url="?curid=1028689" title="Gorilla Grodd">
<text>Gorilla Grodd is a supervillain character appearing in American comic books and other media published by DC Comics, primarily as an enemy of The Flash (Barry Allen). The character was created by John Broome and Carmine Infantino, and first appeared in &quot;The Flash&quot; #106 (May 1959). He is an evil, super-intelligent gorilla who gained mental powers after being exposed to a strange meteorite&#x27;s radiation.

Grodd has appeared in several forms of DC-related media, including television series and films. He has been voiced by Stanley Ralph Ross, Powers Boothe, John DiMaggio, and David Sobolov, among others.

==Fictional character biography==
Gorilla Grodd is a hyper-intelligent telepathic gorilla able to control the minds of others. He and other gorillas gained sapience and psychic powers after an alien spaceship crashed in their area. The gorillas lived in peace until their home was discovered by explorers. Grodd forced one of the explorers to kill the alien and took over Gorilla City, planning to conquer the world next. Solovar telepathically contacts Barry Allen to warn of the evil gorilla&#x27;s plans, and Grodd was defeated. The villain manages to return again and again to plague the Flash and the hero&#x27;s allies.

In his first pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; appearance, Grodd meets the Flash while searching for Solovar (who had been imprisoned) during a trip to the human world. Grodd probed Solovar&#x27;s mind to find the secret of mind control so he could control Gorilla City, using its inhabitants to take over the world. Solovar breaks out of the cage and tells the Flash. The Flash defeats Grodd and temporarily removes his telepathy. When his power returns, he escapes and builds a machine to strip his fellow gorillas of their intelligence. The Flash finds out from Solovar where Grodd has escaped to and destroys the machine. Grodd is again imprisoned, but uses a burrowing machine to escape. Assuming human form, he creates a drug to strengthen his abilities. After easily stopping the Flash, Grodd experiences a side effect that removes his new powers. The Flash arrests Grodd and takes him back to Gorilla City. Grodd fakes his death by transferring his mind into a man in Central City, but is caught and arrested. Later, he instigates the Flash&#x27;s Rogues Gallery, breaking them out of jail to distract the Flash after transferring his mind to that of Freddy, a gorilla in a zoo. Thanks to Solovar, the Flash learns of Grodd&#x27;s escape. Ironically, Grodd, despite using radiation to negate the Flash&#x27;s speed, is defeated by the gorilla&#x27;s mate when she hears him mention another gorilla. He and Freddy are restored to their normal bodies.

Grodd is recruited along with several other villains as one of the original members of the Secret Society of Super Villains. In this series, Grodd defeats Kalibak in hand-to-hand combat, but is later defeated by Captain Comet who is able to repel Grodd&#x27;s mental energy. During the hunt for a sorcerer&#x27;s treasures, Grodd is able to fend off Wally West and escape him using the mentally-commanded Quadro-Mobile, then later knocks Captain Comet unconscious, and is shown to be able to hypnotize Star Sapphire, as well as protect others from mental probing.

In a confrontation with Wally West, Grodd increases the brainpower of most of the animals in Central City. He hopes to endanger all the humans&#x27; lives, but this plan backfires because some of the pets are too loyal to their humans. Grodd&#x27;s plans are defeated by the Flash, assisted by the Pied Piper, Vixen, and Rex the Wonder Dog.

Immortal villain Vandal Savage kidnaps Titans member Omen to form the perfect team of adversaries for the Teen Titans. Savage approaches Grodd, offering him membership in this new anti-Titans group known as Tartarus and promises of power and immortality. Grodd joins Tartarus on their mission to synthesize the immortal blood of the H.I.V.E. Mistress Addie Kane as Savage seeks to create a serum that will grant immortality. Their schemes are thwarted when the Titans intervene. Tempest later leads a rescue mission to save Omen from Savage. During the rescue attempt, Tartarus collapses upon itself due to each member having a different agenda, because Omen had purposely chosen members who would not work well together. When Siren switches alliances during the battle and aids Tempest in escaping, the Tartarus members go their separate ways.

Grodd has made no fewer than eighteen attempts to eliminate all traces of humanity from the face of the Earth. In &quot;Son of Ambush Bug&quot; #5 (November 1986), he travels to the Late Cretaceous &quot;to wipe out all traces of human evolution from the time stream&quot; (despite the fact that the ancestors of humanity would be his own ancestors as well). His plans are shattered by the sudden appearance of Titano and Ambush Bug waking from a nightmare. Whether or not Grodd&#x27;s plan is a failure is disputable.

In the final issue of &quot;Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew&quot;, Grodd travels to Earth-C-Minus in an attempt to conquer, but is defeated by the efforts of the Zoo Crew (plus Changeling of the Teen Titans).

Grodd later does another attempt to conquer Gorilla City by controlling the minds of Congo Bill, Congorilla, Djuba, Gorilla Boss, Monsieur Mallah, and Sam Simeon. In an attempt to expand his mind-control, Grodd suffers brain damage, freeing everyone from his mind-control.

In the 1991 &quot;Angel and the Ape&quot; limited series, Grodd is revealed as the grandfather of Sam Simeon (Angel&#x27;s partner). This is in conflict with &quot;Martian Manhunter&quot; (vol. 2) Annual #2 (1999), which states that Simeon is Grodd&#x27;s brother.

During the &quot;Final Night&quot;, Grodd attempted to use a mystical talisman called the Heart of Darkness (normally effective only in eclipses) that brought out the &#x27;inner beast&#x27; of humans, turning the population of the town of Leesburg into feral monsters, including Supergirl. However, Supergirl was eventually able to fight off Grodd&#x27;s influence, allowing her to oppose Grodd until the sun was restored. Grodd is assumed killed when an icicle fell into him.

One of Grodd&#x27;s widest-ranging schemes was to arrange Solovar&#x27;s assassination and manipulate Gorilla City into war against humanity, with the aid of a &quot;shadow cabinet&quot; of prominent gorillas called Simian Scarlet. In the course of this, Grodd absorbs too much neural energy from his fellow apes, leaving him with the intelligence of a normal gorilla. He has since recovered, and a failed attempt to set up a base in Florida leads to his capture and incarceration in Iron Heights.

Grodd had been trapped inside the human body of an overweight street bum. He was attacked by a gang known as the Vultures. One of them commented on how their member Iggo had the strength of a gorilla, which reminded Grodd of his true form. Suddenly changing back to his original shape and size, he quickly defeated the gang, making them believe that they are burning in molten lava by using his telepathic abilities. Reading the minds of the crooks, he saw that one of the former members of their gang was a friend of the Flash, and a plan began to form in his mind.

Grodd found another space rock, identical to the one that had given him his powers, and contacted Hector Hammond, a human who had also gained similar powers. Grodd was able to take control of Gorilla City after increasing his evolutionary abilities but was defeated once more.

Grodd is also seen in the &quot;Superman/Batman&quot; arc &quot;Public Enemies&quot; controlling numerous villains and heroes to take down Superman and Batman for the prize of one billion dollars offered by then U.S. President Lex Luthor. Despite his use of foes such as Mongul, Solomon Grundy, Lady Shiva, and Nightshade, Batman is able to deduce the mind behind the attacks and they quickly dispose of Grodd.

Grodd is responsible for Hunter Zolomon&#x27;s crippling, resulting in the man&#x27;s transformation into the villainous Zoom after trying to change the event to never have happened. Zolomon would often think about how Grodd used him as a plaything in that fight while talking this over with the Flash.

In &quot;Birds of Prey&quot;, Grodd makes a deal with Grimm to get Blockbuster an ape heart.

In the &quot;JLA Classified&quot; story arc, Grodd and his forces attack the Ultramarine Corps. Grodd has most of the citizens they are protecting killed. He personally eats some of the humans. During the course of this incident, Beryl informs the team that Grodd ranks number three on the latest &quot;Global Most Wanted&quot;.

In the &quot;Justice League of America Wedding Special&quot;, Gorilla Grodd is among the villains seen as members of the Injustice League Unlimited.

In &quot;Salvation Run&quot;, Grodd teams up with the Joker to gather their own faction of exiled supervillains. He kills Monsieur Mallah and Brain and was knocked off a cliff by the Joker. Grodd is seen alive and attempting to deliver payback to the Joker.

In &quot;Justice League of America&quot;, Grodd is shown among the members of Libra&#x27;s new Secret Society and placed in the Inner Circle. In the &quot;Final Crisis&quot; storyline, Gorilla Grodd was among the high ranked superheroes and supervillains that were turned into Justifiers. He is sent to apprehend Snapper Carr and Cheetah, but fails.

<doc id="1028691" wikidata="Q11202642" url="?curid=1028691" title="Commercial fishing">
<text>Commercial fishing is the activity of catching fish and other seafood for commercial profit, mostly from wild fisheries. It provides a large quantity of food to many countries around the world, but those who practice it as an industry must often pursue fish far into the ocean under adverse conditions. Large-scale commercial fishing is called industrial fishing.

The major fishing industries are not only owned by major corporations but by small families as well. In order to adapt to declining fish populations and increased demand, many commercial fishing operations have reduced the sustainability of their harvest by fishing further down the food chain. This raises concern for fishery managers and researchers, who highlight how further they say that for those reasons, the sustainability of the marine ecosystems could be in danger of collapsing.

Commercial fishermen harvest a wide variety of animals. However, a very small number of species support the majority of the world&#x27;s fisheries; these include herring, cod, anchovy, tuna, flounder, mullet, squid, shrimp, salmon, crab, lobster, oyster and scallops. All except these last four provided a worldwide catch of well over a million tonnes in 1999, with herring and sardines together providing a catch of over 22 million metric tons in 1999. Many other species are fished in smaller numbers.

In 2016, of the 171 million tonnes of fish caught, about 88 percent or over 151 million tonnes were utilized for direct human consumption. This share has increased significantly in recent decades, as it was 67 percent in the 1960s. In 2016, the greatest part of the 12 percent used for non-food purposes (about 20 million tonnes) was reduced to fishmeal and fish oil (74 percent or 15 million tonnes), while the rest (5 million tonnes) was largely utilized as material for direct feeding in aquaculture and raising of livestock and fur animals, in culture (e.g. fry, fingerlings or small adults for ongrowing), as bait, in pharmaceutical uses and for ornamental purposes.

== Economics ==

The industry, in 2006, also managed to generate over 185 billion dollars in sales and also provide over two million jobs in the United States, according to an economic report released by NOAA&#x27;s Fisheries Service. Commercial fishing may offer an abundance of jobs, but the pay varies from boat to boat, season to season. Crab fisherman Cade Smith was quoted in an article by &quot;Business Week&quot; as saying, &quot;There was always a top boat where the crew members raked in $50,000 during the three- to five-day king crab season—or $100,000 for the longer snow crab season&quot;. That may be true, but there are also the boats who do not do well; Smith said later in the same article that his worst season left him with a loss of 500 dollars.

The industry has had to adapt through the years in order to keep earning a profit. A study taken on some small family-owned commercial fishing companies showed that they adapted to continue to earn a living but not necessarily make a large profit.

Many people working in commercial fishing are self-employed, with some or all of their pay dependent on the proceeds from the sale of the fish caught. In the UK, the technical term for this is share fisherman, which refers to anyone working without an employment contract, on a boat crewed by more than one person, and relying for their livelihood at least partly on a share of the profits or gross sales of the fishing boat&#x27;s catch.

==Methods and gear==
Commercial fishing uses many different methods to effectively catch a large variety of species including the use of pole and line, trolling with multiple lines, trawling with large nets such as seine-netting, and traps or pots. Sustainability of fisheries is improved by using specific equipment that eliminates or minimizes catching non-targeted species.

Fishing methods vary according to the region, the species being fished for, and the technology available to the fishermen. A commercial fishing enterprise may vary from one man with a small boat with hand-casting nets or a few pot traps, to a huge fleet of trawlers processing tons of fish every day.

Commercial fishing gears in use today include surrounding nets (e.g. purse seine), seine nets (e.g. beach seine), trawls (e.g. bottom trawl), dredges, hooks and lines (e.g. long line and troll line), lift nets, gillnets, entangling nets, Pole and Line, and traps

Commercial fishing gear is specifically designed and updated to avoid catching certain species of animal that is unwanted or endangered. Billions of dollars are spent each year in researching/developing new techniques to reduce the injury and even death of unwanted marine animals caught by the fishermen. In fact, there was a study taken in 2000 on different deterrents and how effective they are at deterring the target species. The study showed that most auditory deterrents helped prevent whales from being caught while more physical barriers helped prevent birds from getting tangled within the net.

==Occupational health and safety==
During 2010–2014, 188 commercial fishing fatalities occurred in the United States, with fatality rates in different fishing fleets ranging from 21 to 147 deaths per 100,000 full-time equivalent workers (FTEs), which is many times higher than the fatality rate for all U.S. workers. During 1919 and 2005, 4111 fishermen died in fishing related accidents in the United Kingdom industry alone. These deaths are generally a result of a combination of severe weather conditions, extreme fatigue because any one fisherman usually puts in a 21-hour shift, and dangerous equipment. Commercial fishing has been identified by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) as a priority industry sector in the National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA) to identify and provide intervention strategies regarding occupational health and safety issues.

=== Hazards and hazard controls ===

Common causes of fishing-related deaths include vessel disasters, falls overboard, and onboard injuries.

Between 2000 and 2010, most vessel disasters often were initiated by flooding, vessel instability, and large waves, and that severe weather conditions contributed to a majority of fatal vessel disasters.

The most frequent cause of death is falls overboard. Falling overboard specifically killed 182 fishermen in the period between 2000 and 2010. This fatality rate is 3 times that of the next most dangerous job in the U.S. and more than 25 times that of the national average across all workers. Most falls overboard went unwitnessed, and in none of the cases documented was the victim wearing a personal flotation device (PFD). Several institutions have tried to change the culture surrounding safety on commercial fishing boats, especially around wearing personal flotation devices. The Alaska Scallop Association mandates that every fisherman must wear a PFD while on deck of the boat, and other organizations have purchased more wearable PFDs.

Onboard injuries often result when a crew member is caught in a line and pulled into a winch on deck. The installation of a readily accessible emergency stop switch on the winch can potentially prevent these kinds of injuries. Injury data collection systems have begun tracking fishing-related injuries (fatal and non-fatal), using publicly available reports such as news media.

=== Regulation ===

The U.S. Coast Guard has primary jurisdiction over the safety of the U.S. commercial fishing fleet, enforcing regulations of the U.S. Commercial Fishing Industry Vessel Safety Act of 1988 (CFIVSA). CFIVSA regulations focus primarily on saving lives after the loss of a vessel and not on preventing vessels from capsizing or sinking, falls overboard, or injuries on deck. CFIVSA regulations require that commercial fishing vessels carry various equipment (e.g., life rafts, radio beacons, and immersion suits) depending on the size of the vessel and the area in which it operates. Not all commercial fishermen follow safety regulations and advice. One study of Maine fishermen found that less than 25% of the fishermen interviewed had recent training in first aid or CPR, only 75% of the boats had survival suits and only 36% had a survival craft. Even the ships that did have the necessary equipment did not consistently have a captain that fully understood how to use the safety equipment.

== Environmental risk ==
The oceans cover nearly two thirds of the Earth&#x27;s surface, and are continuously threatened by human behaviors and practices. By taking so many fish from the seas, humans have managed to remove entire links from the marine food chain. This causes a chain effect, leading to an overall upset of the delicate ecological balance.

Sharks are one of the ocean&#x27;s most threatened groups (see list of threatened sharks) because they are mistakenly caught by vessels searching for fish, and end up getting tossed back into the ocean dead or dying Some Asian cuisines value shark fin as a delicacy, incentivizing excessive catching of sharks and even finning practice among unregulated fishermen. This disappearance of sharks has enabled prey animals like rays to multiply, which alters the food chain dynamics.

Bycatch is the industry term for what they consider &quot;unwanted or economically-worthless aquatic animals who are unintentionally caught using destructively indiscriminate fishing methods like longlines and driftnets, which generally target marketable marine creatures such as tuna and swordfish&quot; There are also billions of other animals that are killed in this manner every year such as: sea turtles, marine mammals, and sea birds. Between 1990 and 2008, it was estimated that 8.5 million sea turtles were fatally caught in nets or on longlines as bycatch.

Coral reefs are biodiversity-rich ecosystems which provide habitat for millions of aquatic species such as sponges, star fish, jellyfish, sea turtles, etc. Reef ecosystems are highly sensitive to chemical, temperature, and population changes. There has been an increasing disappearance of large predators such as barracuda, Nassau groupers, and sharks This makes the reefs more vulnerable to invasion by non-native species.

Fish farming is the raising of fish for food in underwater enclosures, otherwise known as aquaculture. There are environmental hazards such as waste, damage to ecosystems, and negative effects on humans. Because they are so densely packed together, the fecal matter that accumulates can create algal blooms, or deadly parasites and viruses that thrive on the filthy environment. These can infect wild fish that swim near the enclosure, or whole colonies of fish if an infected farm fish escapes the enclosure.

Overfishing occurs because fish are captured at a faster rate than they can reproduce. Both advanced fishing technologies and increased demand for fish have resulted in overfishing. The Food and Agricultural Organization has reported that &quot;about 25 percent of the world&#x27;s captured fish end up thrown overboard because they are caught unintentionally (bycatch), are illegal market species, or are of inferior quality and size&quot; It should not go unnoticed that overfishing has caused more ecological extinction than any other human influence on coastal ecosystems.

The global environmental problem of oceanic microplastics is largely caused by plastic-made fishing gear that is wearing down by use, lost or thrown away.

<text>Julian Carey Dixon (August 8, 1934 – December 8, 2000) was an American Democratic politician from California who was a member of the California State Assembly from 1973 to 1978 and then a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1979 until his death. He chaired the House Ethics Committee from 1985 to 1991.

==Biography==
A member of the aristocratic Syphax family, Dixon was born in Washington D.C. and served in the United States Army from 1957 to 1960. He attended Dorsey High School, and graduated from California State University, Los Angeles in 1962.
He was elected to the California State Assembly as a Democrat in 1972, and served in that body for three terms. Dixon was elected to the House of Representatives in 1978. In 1983 he joined with 7 other Congressional Representatives to sponsor a resolution to impeach Ronald Reagan over his sudden and unexpected invasion of Grenada. He chaired the rules committee at the 1984 Democratic National Convention and the ethics probe into Speaker Jim Wright. Dixon won re-election to the 107th United States Congress, but died at a hospital in Marina Del Rey, California on December 8, 2000, aged 66, following a heart attack.

The busy 7th Street / Metro Center / Julian Dixon transfer station for the A Line, B Line, D Line, and E Line in downtown Los Angeles is named after Dixon, with a plaque commemorating his role in obtaining the federal funding that enabled construction of the Metro Rail system. His alma mater, Southwestern University School of Law, in 2004 opened the Julian C. Dixon Courtroom and Advocacy Center in the former Bullocks Wilshire building. The Culver City branch of the Los Angeles County Library is also named in his honor, Culver City Julian Dixon Library.

The third revised edition of &quot;Black Americans in Congress 1870-2007&quot; (House Document 108-224, Serial Set v.14904) is dedicated to the memory of Dixon. Remarks requesting this were made by several of his colleagues March 21, 2001 on the House floor during consideration of House Concurrent Resolution 43 of the 107th Congress which ordered the printing of the revised edition.

Dixon was a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. He was interred at Inglewood Park Cemetery, Inglewood, California.

<text>The Patrologia Latina (Latin for &quot;The Latin Patrology&quot;) is an enormous collection of the writings of the Church Fathers and other ecclesiastical writers published by Jacques Paul Migne between 1841 and 1855, with indices published between 1862 and 1865. It is also known as the Latin series as it formed one half of Migne&#x27;s &quot;Patrologiae Cursus Completus&quot;, the other part being the &quot;Patrologia Graeca&quot; of patristic and medieval Greek works with their (sometimes non-matching) medieval Latin translations.

Although consisting of reprints of old editions, which often contain mistakes and do not comply with modern standards of scholarship, the series, due to its availability (it is present in many academic libraries) and the fact that it incorporates many texts of which no modern critical edition is available, is still widely used by scholars of the Middle Ages and is in this respect comparable to the &quot;Monumenta Germaniae Historica&quot;.

The &quot;Patrologia Latina&quot; includes Latin works spanning a millennium, from Tertullian (d. 230) to Pope Innocent III (d. 1216), edited in roughly chronological order in 217 volumes: 
* Volumes 1 to 73, from Tertullian to Gregory of Tours, were published from 1841 to 1849, and volumes 74 to 217, from Pope Gregory I to Innocent III, from 1849 to 1855. Although the collection ends with Innocent III,

Migne originally wanted to include documents all the way up to the Reformation; this task proved too great, but some later commentaries or documents associated with earlier works were included. Most of the works are ecclesiastic in nature, but there are also documents of literary, historical or linguistic (such as the Gothic bible in vol. 18) interest.

The original printing plates for the &quot;Patrologia&quot; were destroyed by fire in 1868. However, with help from the Garnier printing house they were restored, and new editions were printed beginning in the 1880s. The content within these reprints is not always identical to the original series, in either quality or internal arrangement. The new editions have been described as &quot;inferior in a number of respects to Migne&#x27;s own first editions&quot;.

<text>Mount Girouard is the highest peak of the Fairholme Range in Banff National Park, Alberta, Canada. Mt. Girouard is located in the Bow River valley south of Lake Minnewanka.

The mountain was named in 1904 after Sir Édouard Girouard, a railway builder in Africa during the rule of the British Empire.

==Geology==
Mount Girouard is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny.

==Climate==
Based on the Köppen climate classification, Mount Girouard is located in a subarctic climate with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below with wind chill factors below . Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into the Bow River.

<text>The North American XB-28 (NA-63) was an aircraft proposed by North American Aviation to fill a strong need in the United States Army Air Corps for a high-altitude medium bomber. It never entered production, with only two prototypes being built.

==Design and development==

The order for a high-altitude medium bomber was put out on 13 February 1940; the XB-28 first flew on 26 April 1942. The XB-28 was based on North American Aviation&#x27;s highly successful B-25 Mitchell, but as it evolved it became a completely new design, much more reminiscent of the Martin B-26 Marauder. The overall configuration of the B-25 and XB-28 were fairly similar; the most important distinction was that the twin tail of the B-25 was changed to a single tail on the XB-28. It was among the first combat aircraft with a pressurized cabin.

The XB-28 proved an excellent design, with significantly better performance than that of the B-25, but it was never put into production. High-altitude bombing was hampered significantly by factors such as clouds and wind, which were frequent occurrences in the Pacific. At the same time, medium bombers were becoming much more effective at lower altitudes. The gains in aircraft performance that came with high-altitude flight were not considered sufficient to justify switching from low-altitude bombing.

In recent years, the name &quot;Dragon&quot; has been attributed to the XB-28. However, this name is not used in any contemporary accounts, or by the U.S. Air Force Museum site; it was almost unheard of, in that era, for an aircraft to receive an official nickname before a production order was placed, and the Douglas B-23 Dragon was already in service with the same name.

==Testing and evaluation==
Even though the Army Air Forces rejected the XB-28 as a bomber, they ordered another prototype. Designated XB-28A, it was meant to explore the possibility of use as a reconnaissance aircraft. The XB-28A crashed into the Pacific Ocean off Southern California after the crew bailed out on 4 August 1943.

<doc id="1028745" wikidata="Q8027380" url="?curid=1028745" title="Wisconsin v. Yoder">
<text>Wisconsin v. Jonas Yoder, 406 U.S. 205 (1972), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that Amish children could not be placed under compulsory education past 8th grade. The Court ruled that the Amish parents&#x27; fundamental right to free exercise of religion outweighed the state&#x27;s interest in educating their children. The case is often cited as a basis for parents&#x27; right to educate their children outside of traditional private or public schools.

Like &quot;Sherbert v. Verner&quot;, the Court in &quot;Yoder&quot; required the government accommodate religious exercise by applying strict scrutiny to a neutral law that burdened religious exercise. &quot;Yoder&quot; differs from &quot;Sherbert v. Verner&quot; because the compulsory school attendance law was non-discriminatory and did not include a mechanism for individualized exemptions. Later, in &quot;Employment Division v. Smith&quot; Justice Antonin Scalia wrote that &quot;Yoder&quot; involved a &quot;hybrid right&quot; composed of parental rights and free exercise. 

The Amish, who prevailed in the case, were represented by William Ball.

==Background of the case==
Three Amish students from three different families stopped attending the New Glarus High School in the New Glarus, Wisconsin, school district at the end of the eighth grade because of their parents&#x27; religious beliefs. The three families were represented by Jonas Yoder (one of the fathers involved in the case) when the case went to trial. They were convicted in the Green County Court. Each defendant was fined the nominal sum of $5. Thereafter the Wisconsin Supreme Court found in Yoder&#x27;s favor. Thereupon, Wisconsin appealed that ruling in the US Supreme Court.

The Amish did not believe in going to court to settle disputes but instead follow the biblical command to &quot;turn the other cheek.&quot; Thus, the Amish are at a disadvantage when it comes to defending themselves in courts or before legislative committees. However, a Lutheran minister, Reverend William C. Lindholm, took an interest in Amish legal difficulties from a religious freedom perspective and founded The National Committee for Amish Religious Freedom (partly as a result of this case) and then provided them with legal counsel.

Under Amish church standards, &quot;higher&quot; education (beyond the 8th grade) was deemed not only unnecessary for their simple way of life, but also endangering to their salvation. These men appealed for exemption from compulsory education on the basis of these religious convictions. They sincerely held to the belief that the values their children would learn at home would surpass the worldly knowledge taught in school.

==Court&#x27;s decision==
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of &quot;Yoder&quot; in its decision. Justice William O. Douglas filed a partial dissent, but voted with the court regarding Yoder&#x27;s case. Justices Lewis F. Powell, Jr. and William H. Rehnquist took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.

The Wisconsin Supreme Court &quot;sustained respondents&#x27; claim that application of the compulsory school-attendance law to them violated their rights under the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment, made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment.&quot;

The U.S. Supreme Court held as follows:

# States cannot force individuals to attend school when it infringes on their First Amendment rights. In this case, the state of Wisconsin interfered with the practice of a legitimate religious belief.
# Not all beliefs rise to the demands of the religious clause of the First Amendment. There needs to be evidence of true and objective religious practices, instead of an individual making his or her standards on such matters. The Amish way of life is one of deep religious convictions that stems from the Bible. It is determined by their religion, which involves their rejection of worldly goods and their living in the Biblical simplicity. The modern compulsory secondary education is in sharp conflict with their way of life.
# With respect to the State of Wisconsin&#x27;s argument that additional modern education beyond 8th grade is necessary to prepare citizens to participate effectively and productively in America&#x27;s political system, the Court disagreed. It argued that the State provided no evidence showing any great benefit to having two extra years in the public schools. Furthermore, the Court contended that the Amish community was a very successful social unit in American society, a self-sufficient, law-abiding member of society, which paid all of the required taxes and rejected any type of public welfare. The Amish children, upon leaving the public school system, continued their education in the form of vocational training.
# The Court found no evidence that by leaving the Amish community without two additional years of schooling, young Amish children would become burdens on society. To the contrary, the Court argued that they had good vocational background to rely upon. It was the State&#x27;s mistaken assumption that Amish children were ignorant. Compulsory education after elementary school was a recent movement that developed in the early 20th century to prevent child labor and keep children of certain ages in school. The State of Wisconsin&#x27;s arguments about compelling the school attendance were therefore less substantial.
# Responding to Justice Douglas&#x27;s dissent, the Court argued that the question before it was about the interests of the parents to exercise free religion, and did not relate to the child&#x27;s First Amendment&#x27;s rights. As such, the argument pertaining to the child&#x27;s right to exercise free religion was irrelevant in this case.

Justice Potter Stewart, joined by Justice William J. Brennan, Jr., filed a concurring opinion stating that the &quot;interesting and important&quot; questions raised by Justice Douglas&#x27; dissent were moot since the Amish children shared their parents&#x27; religious objections to the school attendance.

Justice Byron White, joined by Justices Brennan and Stewart, filed a concurring opinion saying the case &quot;would be a very different case&quot; if the parents forbade their children from &quot;attending any school at any time and from complying in any way with the educational standards set by the State&quot;; he pointed out that the burden on the children was relatively slight since they had acquired &quot;the basic tools of literacy to survive in modern society&quot; and had attended eight grades of school.

==Dissenting opinion==
Justice William O. Douglas, who dissented in part, wrote:

==Legacy of the Court&#x27;s decision==
The ruling is cited as a basis for allowing people to be educated outside traditional private or public schools, such as with homeschooling.

The implications of the case for the Amish were characterized by one author as:

Since &quot;Wisconsin v. Yoder,&quot; all states must grant the Old Order Amish the right to establish their own schools (should they choose) or to withdraw from public institutions after completing eighth grade. In some communities Amish parents have continued to send their children to public elementary schools even after &quot;Wisconsin v. Yoder&quot;. In most places tensions eased considerably after the Supreme Court ruling, although certain difficulties remained for those Amish living in Nebraska.

<doc id="1028755" wikidata="Q5511099" url="?curid=1028755" title="Fuzzy associative matrix">
<text>A fuzzy associative matrix expresses fuzzy logic rules in tabular form. These rules usually take two variables as input, mapping cleanly to a two-dimensional matrix, although theoretically a matrix of any number of dimensions is possible. From the perspective of neuro-fuzzy systems, the mathematical matrix is called a &quot;Fuzzy associative memory&quot; because it stores the weights of the perceptron.

==Applications==
In the context of game AI programming, a fuzzy associative matrix helps to develop the rules for non-player characters. Suppose a professional is tasked with writing fuzzy logic rules for a video game monster. In the game being built, entities have two variables: hit points (HP) and firepower (FP):

This translates to:

 IF MonsterHP IS VeryLowHP AND MonsterFP IS VeryWeakFP THEN Retreat
 IF MonsterHP IS LowHP AND MonsterFP IS VeryWeakFP THEN Retreat
 IF MonsterHP IS MediumHP AND MonsterFP is VeryWeakFP THEN Defend

Multiple rules can fire at once, and often will, because the distinction between &quot;very low&quot; and &quot;low&quot; is fuzzy. If it is more &quot;very low&quot; than it is low, then the &quot;very low&quot; rule will generate a stronger response. The program will evaluate all the rules that fire and use an appropriate defuzzification method to generate its actual response.

An implementation of this system might use either the matrix or the explicit IF/THEN form. The matrix makes it easy to visualize the system, but it also makes it impossible to add a third variable just for one rule, so it is less flexible.

==Identify a rule set==
There is no inherent pattern in the matrix. It appears as if the rules were just made up, and indeed they were. This is both a strength and a weakness of fuzzy logic in general. It is often impractical or impossible to find an exact set of rules or formulae for dealing with a specific situation. For a sufficiently complex game, a mathematician would not be able to study the system and figure out a mathematically accurate set of rules. However, this weakness is intrinsic to the realities of the situation, not of fuzzy logic itself. The strength of the system is that even if one of the rules is wrong, even greatly wrong, other rules that are correct are likely to fire as well and they may compensate for the error.

This does not mean a fuzzy system should be sloppy. Depending on the system, it might get away with being sloppy, but it will underperform. While the rules are fairly arbitrary, they should be chosen carefully. If possible, an expert should decide on the rules, and the sets and rules should be tested vigorously and refined as needed. In this way, a fuzzy system is like an expert system. (Fuzzy logic is used in many true expert systems, as well.)

<doc id="1028765" wikidata="Q4825037" url="?curid=1028765" title="Australian labour law">
<text>Australian labour law sets the rights of working people, the role of trade unions, and democracy at work, and the duties of employers, across the Commonwealth and in states. Under the &quot;Fair Work Act 2009&quot;, the Fair Work Commission creates a national minimum wage and oversees National Employment Standards for fair hours, holidays, parental leave and job security. The FWC also creates modern awards that apply to most sectors of work, numbering 150 in 2024, with minimum pay scales, and better rights for overtime, holidays, paid leave, and superannuation for a pension in retirement. Beyond this floor of rights, trade unions and employers often create enterprise bargaining agreements for better wages and conditions in their workplaces. In 2024, collective agreements covered 15% of employees, while 22% of employees were classified as &quot;casual&quot;, meaning that they lose many protections other workers have. Australia&#x27;s laws on the right to take collective action are among the most restrictive in the developed world, and Australia does not have a general law protecting workers&#x27; rights to vote and elect worker directors on corporation boards as do most other wealthy OECD countries. 

Equal treatment at work is underpinned by a patchwork of legislation from the &quot;Fair Work Act 2009&quot;, &quot;Racial Discrimination Act 1975&quot;, &quot;Sex Discrimination Act 1984&quot;, &quot;Disability Discrimination Act 1992&quot;, &quot;Age Discrimination Act 2004&quot; and a host of state laws, with complaints possible to the Fair Work Commission, the Australian Human Rights Commission, and state-based regulators. Despite this system, structural inequality from unequal parental leave and responsibility, segregated occupations, and historic patterns of xenophobia mean that the gender pay gap remains at 22%, while the Indigenous pay gap remains at 33%. These inequalities usually intersect with each other, and combine with overall inequality of income and security. The laws for job security include reasonable notice before dismissal, the right to a fair reason before dismissal, and redundancy payments. However many of these protections are reduced for casual employees, or employees in smaller workplaces. The Commonwealth government, through fiscal policy, and the Reserve Bank of Australia, through monetary policy, are meant to guarantee full employment but in recent decades the previous commitment to keeping unemployment around 2% or lower has not been fulfilled. Australia shares similarities with higher income countries, and implements some International Labour Organization conventions. 

==History==
Australia&#x27;s first federal labour rights followed the Constitution of Australia in 1901, yet the law had long regulated work in colonies, often violently suppressing labour freedom. The land of Australia was forcibly settled by British Empire migrants, who achored in Botany Bay and then declared they held possession of the eastern continent in 1780. After losing territory to the United States in the American War of Independence, Britain established a penal colony of 1400 settlers and convicts in Sydney in 1788. Before colonisation, there were around 1.2 million Indigenous Australians, but contact with European settlers killed up to 80% of people through smallpox and other diseases. In the Australian frontier wars over the next century, around 115,000 Indigenous people were massacred or killed, particularly in Queensland. Indigenous Australian labour was typically organised on hunter-gathering lines, and was cooperative within and between tribes, and through trade among national groups. By contrast, British labour was primarily forced, with a constant supply of prisoners from the British Isles whose crimes were often related to poverty or trying to seek better wages. For example, in &quot;R v Lovelass&quot; a group of five farm workers in Tolpuddle, Dorset had organised a trade union, because their wages were cut from nine shillings to a starvation wage of six shillings a week. They were convicted under the Unlawful Oaths Act 1797 and Unlawful Societies Act 1799 and sentenced to transportation to Sydney. Mass popular support and protest meant that these five became known as the Tolpuddle martyrs, and they were eventually pardoned. The population tripled to more than a million migrants over the Australian gold rushes of 1851, and protests broke out against the government&#x27;s attempt to impose a licence fee for working to search for gold (whether or not gold was found). In 1854, when the fee was £2 for 3 months, strict and brutal enforcement led to the Eureka Stockade at Ballarat, where rebels demanded an end to the fee, democratic representation in the government, and took up arms. Though the stockade was broken, and its leaders killed or arrested and put on trial, juries acquitted all, the gold licence fee was replaced with an export duty, and miners won the right to vote in the Victorian Legislative Assembly. Yet labour rights throughout Australian colonies were scant. Laws were systematically discriminatory, particularly based on gender and race, entrenched in the White Australia policy from the Immigration Restriction Act 1901. The right to organise unions was precarious, without any positive right to take collective action for fair work, and there were no legislative rights to fair wages or job security. Instead, responding to the 1890 Australian maritime dispute, the 1892 Broken Hill miners&#x27; strike and others, South Australia, New Zealand, New South Wales, and finally the federation sought to replace industrial conflict and strikes with a system of arbitration.
At Australia&#x27;s federation in 1901, the Constitution section 51(xxxv) empowered the making of &quot;laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to... conciliation and arbitration for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any one state&quot;. This was used to pass the &quot;Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904&quot; where a &quot;dispute&quot; would trigger federal jurisdiction between trade unions and employers, and this was meant to make strikes illegal or unnecessary, although in fact strikes remained &quot;not uncommon&quot;. The Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration (CCCA) could hear disputes, and make &quot;awards&quot; for fair wages and conditions across an industry if there was no agreement reached, or regulate any &quot;industrial matters&quot;. With favourable governments in power, some courts were progressive, and in the landmark &quot;Harvester case&quot; the CCCA determined that the employer, Hugh Victor McKay that made harvesting machinery, was required to pay &quot;fair and reasonable wages&quot;, or pay an excise tax on exports, under the &quot;Excise Tariff Act 1906&quot;. What was &quot;fair and reasonable&quot;, said Higgins J depended on &quot;the normal needs of an average employee, regarded as a human being in a civilised community&quot;, and this was to be found by imagining a hypothetical collective agreement, not individual bargaining with the &quot;usual, but unequal, contest, the &quot;higgling of the market&quot; for labour, with the pressure for bread on one side and the pressure for profits on the other&quot;. This formed the basis of Australian fair work regulation, even though &quot;R v Barger&quot; in 1908 quickly struck down the &quot;Excise Tariff Act 1906&quot;, saying the federal tax power could not be used to indirectly regulate working conditions. In 1956, &quot;R v Kirby&quot; held that the CCCA was an unconstitutional court because it held both judicial and powers to arbitrate disputes. So, to replace the CCCA, a new Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission carried out mediation functions, and the Commonwealth Industrial Court assumed its powers and itself merged into the Federal Court of Australia in 1977.
Australian workers were among the world&#x27;s wealthiest by the 1980s, but Parliament decided to follow US and UK models to reduce sectoral collective bargaining and awards, believing that it halted &quot;productive innovation&quot;. In a 1983 Prices and Incomes Accord between Bob Hawke&#x27;s Australian Labor Party and the Australian Council of Trade Unions, it was agreed that there should be minimum wage increases across whole sectors, and then further payments if productivity improved at enterprise level. This approach was codified in the &quot;Industrial Relations Act 1988&quot;, where industry-wide awards only provided a minimum safety net, enterprise bargaining would create certified agreements for higher wages, and unions and employers could take collective action including strikes, if certain conditions were fulfilled. The &quot;Industrial Relations Reform Act 1993&quot; added provisions on unfair dismissal, and that non-union workplaces could also make collective agreements, if approved by a special majority, there was &quot;no disadvantage&quot; compared to awards, and workers were adequately informed about the bargain. These Acts relied on the Constitution&#x27;s trade and commerce, corporations, and external relations powers, rather than the arbitration powers, since the High Court had indicated this was a valid basis for labour laws. Meanwhile, the Gough Whitlam government had passed the first Racial Discrimination Act 1975 that created a right of equal treatment based on race at work, the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 under Hawke prohibited discrimination on the grounds of sex, and together with the rights in the Disability Discrimination Act 1992, and the Age Discrimination Act 2004, complaints could be made to the Australian Human Rights Commission as well as courts for violation of anti-discrimination norms. Also under the Hawke-Keating government, the &quot;Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993&quot; passed to ensure at least equal employee or beneficiary election rights on superannuation boards that provide workplace pensions, although the Abbott government reduced protection by enabling &quot;independent&quot; members selected by the incumbent board.
When the Liberal coalition under John Howard regained office, its &quot;Workplace Relations Act 1996&quot; reduced the allowable matters for awards to 20 issues, and enabled &quot;Australian Workplace Agreements&quot; to be made between individual employees and workers that could be worse than awards. It also created a freedom &quot;not to associate&quot; with a union and banned union preference clauses in awards. After Howard&#x27;s government was re-elected in 2004, they passed the &quot;Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Act 2005&quot;. This abolished industry-wide awards, removed unfair dismissal protection from employees with under 100 staff in their workplaces, trade unions were no longer parties to collective agreements (only bargaining agents), a new set of &quot;Australian Fair Pay and Condititons Standards&quot; applied to all employers and employees, a new &quot;Australian Fair Pay Commission&quot; determined minimum wages, and this overrode all state rights even they were better. The deeply unpopular &quot;Work Choices&quot; led to the Howard government losing decisively in 2007, with John Howard himself losing his seat. The &quot;Fair Work Act 2009&quot; replaced &quot;Work Choices&quot; with a restored system of unfair dismissal rights, individual &quot;AWAs&quot; were replaced with enterprise collective agreements, and minimum conditions of employment were renamed the &quot;National Employment Standards&quot; (NES). The Fair Work Commission oversees enforcement of awards and bargaining, sets industrial awards, minimum wages and resolves disputes including unfair dismissal. This basic structure was not touched by the Abbott, Turnbull and Morrison governments, although wages and standards continued to decline through lack of enforcement, growing casualization, and hostile judicial decisions. With the Albanese government, a series of reforms, such as the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Closing Loopholes) Bill, aimed to raise protection, since Australian labour rights remained significantly below European and wealthier countries&#x27; standards. This includes the lack of a restored system for sectoral collective bargaining, weak protection for collective action, and absence of rights for workers to elect directors on boards of enterprises, outside isolated examples in universities or the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 25 per cent of people on &quot;casual&quot; contracts, and stagnating real wages.

==Rights and contracts at work==
Australian work relationships begin with a contract, and carry basic rights for fair pay and conditions. Most rights are for &quot;employees&quot; (not the self-employed) who are defined by the reality of systematic unequal bargaining power compared to employers, usually organised in a corporate form. By law, rights are more important than contract terms that employers impose. A contract is a deal entered into by consent, and common law and statute set default rights, such as enough hours, a safe system of work, and sometimes good faith. Further, under the &quot;Fair Work Act 2009&quot;, the Fair Work Commission sets a national minimum wage, a system of minimum pay scales in modern awards, and oversees collective bargaining between unions and employers. The National Employment Standards also set a floor of rights for a standard maximum 38 hour week, at least 28 to 37 days of annual leave and public holidays, and long service leave. Modern awards set by the Fair Work Commission, for 150 workplace sectors in 2024, must contain terms on working time, consultation before changes, dsiputes, and flexibility, and usually contain further rights such as higher overtime pay, rest breaks, more holidays, and superannuation to ensure people a decent retirement income. There are also rights to paid parental leave, at a minimum of 20 weeks shared between parents, and the FWC has a duty to end the gender pay gap, given the prior failure to equalise and lengthen parental leave in awards and collective agreements. Unlike wealthy OECD countries, Australian law allows employers to designate employees as &quot;casual&quot;, and take away universal rights such as paid holidays or job security in return for a nominal 25% extra pay even if they have lowered market pay in practice to nullify this &quot;casual loading&quot;: in 2024, 22% of Australian employees were casual. 

===Scope of rights===
In international law, &quot;everyone&quot; has the right to fair pay, to equal treatment, to join a union, to take collective action, and to social security including job security. However the scope of who has rights under the &quot;Fair Work Act 2009&quot;, including for award wages, paid holidays, collective bargaining, and job security, depends on the test for who is an employee, as opposed to an &quot;independent contractor&quot;. Historically, this distinction was based on the view that employees have systematically unequal bargaining power, and therefore needed positive legal rights that would otherwise be lost in take-it-or-leave-it contracts that the employer imposed. The common law distinguished employees from the self-employed (who are responsible for their own rights, or fell back on the state), based on the employer&#x27;s exercise of control, for instance over place or conditions of work. Courts asked whether workers were carrying &quot;on a trade or business of his own&quot;, and viewed a contract&#x27;s terms as obscuring reality, not revealing it. As a court said in 1988: &quot;The parties cannot create something which has every feature of a rooster, but call it a duck and insist that everyone else recognise it as a duck&quot;. As well as control, courts looked at multiple factors including whether work was done personally, whether the worker works for others, the method of pay, ownership of equipment, trade marks, good will, and who got profits or bore losses. However, against this tradition, and international standards, the High Court in &quot;ZG Operations Australia Pty Ltd v Jamsek&quot; overturned the Federal Court to find that drivers who were made to buy their own vehicles were not employees, despite them bearing the employer&#x27;s trade marks, working only for the company, and doing so for decades. The drivers were originally contracted as employees, but then their contracts were unilaterally altered in 1985-6 to deem them self-employed. Yet in the court&#x27;s opinion, &quot;the exercise of superior bargaining power... has no bearing on the meaning and effect of the bargains that were struck&quot; and claims against resulting injustice &quot;cannot be made by stealth under the obscurantist guise of a search for the &quot;reality&quot; of the situation&quot;. This opinion, meeting with widespread derision, was reversed by the &quot;Fair Work Act 2009&quot; section 15AA(1) which states that an employee &quot;is to be determined by ascertaining the real substance, practical reality and true nature of the relationship between the individual and the person&quot; and (2) &quot;regard must be had not only to the terms of the contract governing the relationship, but also to other factors relating to the totality of the relationship including, but not limited to, how the contract is performed in practice.&quot; By comparison, wealthier jurisdictions determine employee status and rights based on reality, bargaining power, and the purpose of the law, and disregard inconsistent contract terms.
The &quot;Fair Work Act 2009&quot; section 357 codifies a civil remedy for misrepresentation that a contract is independent, rather than one of employment. However, compared to international standards, misclassification takes most through approval by the courts themselves. There are five main types of case. First, unpaid internships have been allowed, though in one case the limit was two weeks. Second, single person corporations can be easily established and engaged through a commercial (rather than employment) contract, although in &quot;ACE Insurance Ltd v Trifunovski&quot; the Federal Court held that insurance agents who were made to contract through corporations were still employees, even though they might hire clerical assistants. Third, labour hire (or agency work) arrangements were held in &quot;Building Workers&#x27; Industrial Union of Australia v Odco Pty Ltd&quot; to enable people to be classified as self-employed in relation to the party they truly work for, so that even a 22 year old backpacker doing menial labour on building sites was classed as self-employed. Even where a labour hire agency is set up as an employer&#x27;s wholly owned subsidiary to evade rights, courts have held this was lawful. Further, in &quot;FWO v Valuair Ltd (No 2)&quot; the Federal Court held that Qantas could use its wholly owned subsidiary Jetstar, incorporated in New Zealand, to employ foreign workers to work in Australia on wages lower than Australian staff, undercutting the enterprise agreement. In the court&#x27;s view it was not enough that work was done in Australia, and it mattered that contracts were made in foreign countries with foreign corporations. Fourth, franchisors are subject to obligations under the &quot;Trade Practices (Fair Trading) Act 1998&quot; to disclose information, allow franchisees to freely associate, not unfairly terminate contracts, and under the &quot;FWA 2009&quot; sections 558A-C they are liable for breaching the Act if they should have been aware and taken preventative steps. The &quot;Modern Slavery Act 2018&quot; also contains so called &quot;due diligence&quot; requirements for corporations to prevent forced labour in supply chains, but fails to impose vicarious liability, or personal liability, regardless of the mindset (or wilful ignorance) of directors. Finally, in &quot;Gupta v Uber Australia Pty Ltd&quot; the Fair Work Commission accepted that an Uber Eats driver was not an employee. The new &quot;Fair Work Act 2009&quot; section 15P reverses this by requiring that an &quot;employee-like worker&quot; has the same rights paying regard to &quot;low bargaining power&quot;, low pay, and low degree of authority. Employee-like workers and road transport contractors may apply to the Fair Work Commission for a “Minimum Standard Order” or &quot;Guideline&quot;, and make collective agreements with a digital labour platform. The orders and guidelines can include terms on payment, deductions, working time, record-keeping, insurance, consultation, representation, delegates’ rights, and cost recovery. Employee-like workers may also apply to the Fair Work Commission for unfair deactivations, unfair terminations, and unfair contracts.

===Contracts of employment===
Although most Australian workers have a system of rights to support fair work, entry into a work relationship is through a contract based on consent.

===Wages, awards and super===

Collective bargaining through unions is one way that Australian workers achieve higher pay, but the &quot;Fair Work Act 2009&quot; also creates a national minimum wage, and minimum scales depending on the workplace sector. &quot;FWA 2009&quot; section 14 covers every &quot;national system employer&quot; that may be regulated by the federal constitution, and gaps were closed by all states referring their powers over industrial matters to the Commonwealth (except Western Australia). First, the Fair Work Commission sets a basic &quot;national minimum wage&quot; each year for all employees not covered by a specific &quot;modern award&quot;, as a catch all safety net. From July 2023, the national minimum wage was $23.23 an hour, or $882.80 a week of 38 ordinary hours. Under section 284 its &quot;minimum wage objective&quot; must take into account improving productivity, competitiveness, inflation and employment growth, the need for gender equality, social inclusion through higher employment, the needs of the low paid, and fair wages for junior, training and disabled employees.
Second, &quot;modern awards&quot; are set by the Fair Work Commission. In 2024 there were 150 covering different workplace sectors. These have minimum pay scales depending on employees&#x27; experience, qualifications, and skills. For example, the &quot;Legal Services Award 2020&quot; sets minimum weekly rates for &quot;levels 1 to 6&quot; for clerical and administrative staff (but not lawyers), the &quot;Reserve Bank of Australia Award 2016&quot; sets &quot;levels 1 to 5&quot; for annual salaries, and the &quot;Higher Education Industry – Academic Staff – Award 2020&quot; sets a 24 level pay scale with both annual salaries for full-time employees, and comparable minimum hourly rates. These awards are usually far lower than under enterprise bargaining agreements, but are designed to place a minimum floor to prevent unfair competition. The objectives of the FWC under section 134 are improving secure work, gender equality, encouraging bargaining and a competitive economy. Under &quot;FWA 2009&quot; section 158 an employer, employee, or trade union covered by the award can apply for a variation of an award. Often, &quot;junior&quot; employees under 21 years old are paid less, and are exempt in this respect from age discrimination laws, based on the theory that it may reduce youth unemployment, even though experience in New Zealand is that paying young people less does not encourage them to find work, and abolishing junior rates had no impact on youth employment. Most awards exclude managerial staff, and must exclude people based on the &quot;seniority of their role&quot; who were traditionally not covered, while &quot;high income earners&quot;, paid over $167,500 in 2023, can agree to be exempt from an award if they have a guarantee of annual earnings. This means that, unless enterprise bargaining covers them, fair pay scales do not constrain rip-off executive pay that diminishes the pay of everyone else. Third, there are enterprise agreements, which are bargained between unions and employers to be higher, and under section 57 will displace any sector-wide award. However in 2012, enterprise agreement coverage reached a peak of merely 27%, and by 2021 coverage fell to 15%, compared to coverages typically over 80% in European Union member states that promote sectoral collective bargaining.&lt;ref name=&quot;2022/2041&quot;&gt;Collective Bargaining and Wage Directive 2022 (2022/2041) art 4(2) requires a member state plan if &quot;collective bargaining coverage is less than 80% of the workers&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;
As well as basic pay, most awards set rates for working overtime, extra pay for work on sundays or public holidays, and superannuation. For all breaches of modern awards, there are civil remedies. Under &quot;FWA 2009&quot; section 323 requires that people are paid in money, rather than in kind (or &quot;truck&quot;). For example, in &quot;Australian Education Union v Victoria&quot; it was held to be unlawful for the state government to deduct each fortnight between $4 and $17 from salaries of teachers who had been given laptops. Superannuation in Australia provides people with workplace pensions in retirement, and employers must pay a &quot;superannuation guarantee&quot; of 12% of income from 2025 to approved funds. There may also be no unauthorised deductions of wages, and there is a right to be paid at least monthly. Under the &quot;Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993&quot; section 89, the &quot;basic representation rule&quot; is that boards of funds have an equal number of member and employer-appointed trustees, but there may also be &quot;independent&quot; trustees or directors appointed by the incumbent board. By 2023, there were $3.5 trillion in assets under management at Australian superfunds, however the voting rights on corporation shares, which are usually held by super funds, are typically outsourced to asset managers who are not yet bound to any consistent voting policy that reflects the interests of the workforce.

===Working time===

Beyond fair pay, international labour law aims to reduce working time in line with rising productivity, for a fair work week with more holidays and time for education or retirement, unbound to an employer. Under the &quot;Fair Work Act 2009&quot; section 61(2) there are eleven &quot;National Employment Standards&quot;, and eight concern working time (while one is on casual work, and two are on job security). Like pay can go beyond the national minimum wage, modern awards set by the Fair Work Commission, and collective agreements between unions and employers, often do have higher standards. First, under section 62 the standard maximum working week for a full time employee is 38 hours, and an employer may not request more &quot;unless the additional hours are reasonable&quot;, taking account of health, family, workplace needs, any overtime payments, and notice. Under section 139 awards are permitted to, and often do include overtime pay, usually 1.5 times or 2 times the basic rate of pay. In calculating the 38 hour maximum, employees&#x27; working time over 26 weeks will be averaged out. Second most important is that employees have a right to at least four weeks&#x27; paid leave, or five weeks if the employee is a shiftworker. Third, under sections 114 to 116 there are additional paid public holidays, which vary by state but generally amount to between 8 and 12 extra days, depending on where weekends fall. However, an employer can make a &quot;reasonable&quot; request for employees to work on public holidays, and the employee may only refuse if reasonable, based on factors again including workplace needs, family, overtime rates, and notice. Fourth, there is a right to long service leave which vary by state and award, for instance 2 months paid leave after 10 years in New South Wales.
Fifth, there is a disjointed right to paid parental leave under the &quot;Paid Parental Leave Act 2010&quot;, which entitles both parents to share 20 weeks paid leave (but at least 2 weeks reserved for one). Also under the &quot;FWA 2009&quot; section 76 there is a further right to one year, but of unpaid leave, extendable to two years if an employer accepts the request. There are rights to a safe job during pregnancy or paid leave if no job is available, to return to the same position as before or if it does not exist to one &quot;qualified and suited nearest in status&quot;, and to be consulted about any proposed changes to the job while on leave. In practice these rules encourage women to take more time off work for child care than men, and so contribute to the gender pay gap as well as the motherhood penalty, compared to countries that have equal paid parental leave for parents on a use-it-or-lose-it basis. When using its powers to set awards, the Fair Work Commission is now required by section 134(1)(ab) to take into account &quot;the need to achieve gender equality in the workplace&quot;. Sixth, there is the right to care or compassionate leave. Seventh, there is a right to community service and jury leave of up to 10 days. Eighth, there is a right to request flexible work for carers and parents with school age children, and only be refused if there are reasonable business grounds.

===Casual and atypical workers===
Unlike most wealthy OECD countries, Australian law enables employers to not provide all rights of employment, particularly paid holidays and job security, if people are classed as &quot;casual&quot; employees, and in 2023 this meant around 22% of employees. To compensate for the absence of rights, modern awards typically grant a 25% &quot;casual loading&quot; additional pay, but potentially no holidays at all, putting Australia at odds with European Union practice There is also no legal mechanism to prevent employers rates of pay before the 25% loading is added. Under the &quot;Fair Work Act 2009&quot; section 15A a casual employee exists if the relationship has an &quot;absence of a firm advance commitment to continuing and indefinite work&quot;, replacing the previous notion that an employee simply accepts they do in a contract. This reversed the decision of the High Court in &quot;Workpac Pty Ltd v Rossato&quot;, that where a contract states someone is casual, even if the employer is providing them with ongoing work in regular and systematic shifts in reality, they are still casual employees and not entitled to paid holidays under &quot;FWA 2009&quot; section 86. Casual workers are protected by unfair dismissal after 6 months, or 12 months for a small business, if they are deemed to work &#x27;on a regular and systematic basis&#x27; and have a reasonable expectation of continued employment, but otherwise risk losing job security rights. Since 2021 casual workers must get an offer of a permanent contract offer after 12 months unless there are reasonable grounds to not make the offer.

Other types of atypical work contract include part-time, fixed-term and labour hire staff. First, since the Workplace Relations Act 1996 section 526, awards have been able to provide equal treatment for part-time workers. Part-time employees are often also casual employees and not treated equally regarding holidays and job security, and this has a negative disproportionate impact on women. Second, fixed-term staff are treated unequally compared to permanent staff in that the simple expiry of a fixed term counts as an unchallengeable reason for dismissal, no matter how capriciously or maliciously motivated the reasons are for non-renewal. Third, under the &quot;FWA 2009&quot; sections 306C-G there is a limited right to equal treatment for employees contracted through a labour hire firm compared to directly hired employees, after application to the Fair Work Commission. However unlike wealthier OECD countries the right is not automatic, and unavailable for workers of small businesses.

==Union rights and bargaining==
The right to join a union, freely associate and take action including strikes, are universal rights in international law, enshrined after the experience of mass war and dictatorship. Australian law provides minimal protection, and has been consistently criticised by the International Labour Organization. There is a basic right to join a union, yet the High Court has made protection for discrimination against union members weak by enabling employers to argue they did not intend to target union members with adverse action. There is a right to collective bargaining, but only within &quot;single-employer&quot; enterprises, creating major legal obstacles to sectoral collective bargaining found in other prosperous countries. Key to this is the prohibition on the right to take solidarity action, i.e. workers of one employer striking with workers of another employer to get a multi-employer deal, especially to prevent anti-productive competition. There is a limited right to take collective action, to get a collective agreement with a single employer. Australia has a significant history of workers voting for representation on boards of directors of the corporations or other governing bodies where they work, particularly in New South Wales, and in federal public services such as the ABC and Australia Post. However Australia has not yet passed a general federal law, like a majority of wealthier OECD countries, to protect the right to vote for directors at work.

===Trade unions and free association===

In 2024 there were 1.4 million trade union members in Australia, 46 of which are affiliated with the Australian Council of Trade Unions. Each union has a different constitution, and system for electing its Secretary and President, but most unions follow a pattern of members electing delegates, who in turn elect the union executive, in contrast with a direct election model. Union membership among the workforce in 2024 was around 15%, having declined from a peak close to 60% in 1962, even though surveys routinely suggest that many more Australian workers would prefer to be covered by a union. The fall in membership followed the shift to enterprise bargaining, and the ban on the closed shop since 1996. The &quot;Fair Work Act 2009&quot; section 346(a) says there is a right to suffer no &quot;adverse action&quot; from an employer (or anyone) if that person &quot;is or is not, or was or was not, an officer or member of an industrial association&quot;. Clauses in awards and collective agreements to give preferences to union members over non-members are also prohibited.
The positive side of freedom of association is that the law protects everyone against adverse action for joining a union, and also taking part in collective action including strikes that count as &quot;protected industrial action&quot;. If an employee alleges that the employer has taken adverse action for a prohibited reason, &quot;it is presumed that the action was, or is being, taken for that reason or with that intent, unless the [employer] proves otherwise.&quot; The claimant may apply to the Fair Work Commission which holds a conference, compulsory in cases of dismissal, and the FWC may arbitrate with the parties&#x27; consent. Despite the intent of Parliament, in &quot;Board of Bendigo Regional Institute of Technical and Further Education v Barclay&quot; the High Court held that the reverse burden of proof made it legitimate to focus on the subjective reasons of the decision-maker, so that direct &quot;testimony from the decision-maker which is accepted as reliable is capable of discharging the burden&quot;, and that this achieved a &quot;balance&quot;. The High Court repeated this stance in &quot;CFMEU v BHP Coal Pty Ltd&quot;, where a striking worker held a sign saying &quot;No principles SCABS No Guts&quot;, and was dismissed for violating BHP&#x27;s &quot;workplace conduct policy&quot;. The High Court sided with the employer&#x27;s assertion that dismissal was for uncivil language, not union activity, and said that a claimant would only be protected from an employer&#x27;s deliberate and conscious victimisation, not employers who make out they (supposedly) inadvertently took adverse action. This approach falls below international standards, where adverse action is a purely objective test. By contrast in &quot;CFMEU v Clermont Coal Pty Ltd&quot; an employer was found liable for selecting a union organiser named Mr Scott for redundancy, ostensibly on the basis of &quot;attitude&quot;, but where all supervisor&#x27;s assessments of &quot;attitude&quot; came from Scott&#x27;s role in union organising, and Scott had an objectively better work record than others scored higher.

===Collective bargaining===

To get fair wages beyond the national minimum wage, and award wage scales, unions and employers may collectively bargain. Unlike most wealthy OECD countries, Australia&#x27;s collective bargaining system is largely confined to individual enterprises, rather than multi-employer bargaining. Combined with weak protections for union organising, this means that coverage of collective agreements was just 15% in 2022, compared to coverages typically over 80% in wealthier European Union member states that promote sectoral collective bargaining. Under the &quot;Fair Work Act 2009&quot; sections 247-252, the Fair Work Commission may authorise &quot;single interest employers&quot; to bargain, which can include a corporate group, or multiple entities in a joint venture or common enterprise, but usually separate organisations bargain separately, if at all. Under section 186, the FWC may approve multi-employer agreements, but must find that the &quot;agreement has been genuinely agreed to by each employer&quot; with &quot;no person coerced&quot;, even though solidarity strike action is unlawful in Australia. This makes multi-employer agreements rare and the coverage for fair wage agreements historically low. Employees of several employers may also ask the FWC for a special &quot;low-paid bargaining&quot; authorisation under sections 241 to 246, if worker pay is particularly bad and bargaining power weak, but even then employees do not have a right to take collective action. Under sections 260-265, the FWC may make a low pay determination if bargaining does not work, but in practice no multi-employer agreements have resulted. Despite this lack of coverage, the law allows so called &quot;greenfield agreements&quot;, where employers make an agreement in new workplaces to last up to 4 years (or 8 years for construction projects) without any strike action possible. For instance, in &quot;Shop, Distributive &amp; Allied Employees Association v ALDI Foods Pty Ltd&quot;, the supermarket chain Aldi made an agreement with 17 prospective employees, ignoring the union, and the High Court said that under section 172 an agreement could be made even though the employees had not begun work. The FWC can make &quot;scope orders&quot; under section 238 on whether employee groups are fairly chosen, given geographical, operational or organisational distinction.
Employers can always voluntarily agree to collectively bargain, but if they do not, under section 237 the Fair Work Commission can require good faith bargaining after determining that there is majority support, &quot;using any method the FWC considers appropriate&quot;, such as petitions, pledge cards, union lists, or in rare cases a ballot. Under section 228(1), the &quot;good faith&quot; requirements are that the FWC can make the employer and union meet at reasonable times, disclose relevant information, respond to proposals, genuinely consider them, refrain from capricious and unfair conduct, and recognise the other side&#x27;s bargaining representatives. The employer is not required to make concessions or reach agreement on terms, but it was held in &quot;Endeavour Coal v Association of Professional Engineers, Scientists and Managers&quot; that the employer &quot;must genuinely participate in the bargaining process; it cannot adopt the role of a distinterested suitor, only rejecting offers and proposals made by the other bargaining representatives.&quot; Here the employer refused to cooperate despite majority employee support for the union, and the FWC granted the APESMA an order (1) requiring a list of matters the employer was prepared to include in a bargain, and terms it would accept, (2) to cease unilaterally determining a standard form contract for staff, (3) to ensure someone with decision-making capacity attended meetings, (4) to meet within 21 days. The federal court partially upheld the award, saying that the FWC had not erred in finding a breach of good faith. Single workplaces may have multiple unions, and in such cases an employer may apply to the FWC for an order that bargaining representatives meet to elect one to represent all of them if &quot;the bargaining process is not proceeding efficiently or fairly because there are multiple bargaining representatives for the agreement.&quot;
The content of a collective agreement must include terms for an expiry date no longer than 4 years (even if the parties want an ongoing agreement), a dispute resolution clause, a term for employees to make &quot;individual flexibility agreements&quot; (so long as employees are &quot;better off overall&quot;), and a term on consultation on any &quot;major workplace changes&quot; that could impact employees or change hours of work. To assist, the &quot;Fair Work Regulations 2009&quot; Schedule 2.3 prescribes a model consultation term. Under section 172, other negotiated content can be anything &quot;pertaining to the relationship between an employer&quot; and &quot;employees&quot;, or unions, payroll deductions from wages for union membership dues, and how the agreement will operate. Several court decisions have unduly limited what counts as pertaining to the employment relationship, including not regulating trading hours as opposed to working time, how to deal with surpluses in a defined benefit superannuation fund, whether money was transferred to a union-controlled super-fund, and constraints on employing contract labour as opposed to equal treatment. Even more, the law restricts agreements on union rights of entry, varying restrictions on strike action, and terms requiring employers pay bargaining service fees for non-union members. Once made, an agreement covers all employees it is expressed to, and the agreement is legally binding with civil remedies for breach, with the right of the employer, any employee, and the union having standing to sue in federal court.

===Collective action===

The right to take collective action, including the &quot;right to strike&quot; within &quot;the laws of the particular country&quot; is a universal right in international law. However, Australian law is one of the most restrictive on unions&#x27; freedom to take action to protect members&#x27; interests, and progressive restrictions on voice at work have matched a stagnation of wages. Before 1993, the law formally did not allow strike action at all, although in practice many strikes took place. Disputes were meant to be solved by compulsory arbitration, leading to notable instances of union officers being sued in tort for millions in damages where they took actioin. This is because under old common law, a strike that breaks a contract may lead to the imposition of industrial torts. Under the &quot;Fair Work Act 2009&quot; section 19, industrial action is performing work &quot;in a manner different from that in which it is customarily performed&quot; or &quot;a restriction or limitation on, or a delay in, the performance of work&quot;. It is not clear whether picketing is always industrial action, given a Federal Court case before the &quot;FWA 2009&quot; doubting that it was, leading to the result that picketing would not be protected action, but also that the FWC could not issue stop orders against pickets.
To begin industrial action for an &quot;employee claim&quot; it must be against a single-business enterprise, rather than multiple employers, it cannot even be part of so called &quot;pattern bargaining&quot; seeking the same agreements across different enterprises, and it must not be taken before an enterprise agreement has expired. The union must get permission from the FWC to do a protected action ballot, and the FWC must grant an order where the union has a majority support determination and is &quot;genuinely trying to reach an agreement&quot; by negotiation. The ballot must state what kinds of action are proposed, and be overseen by the Australian Electoral Commission or an independent agent, and over 50% must turn out to vote, with over 50% being in favour of action. A union then must then give notice of three days to the employer, and start action within 30 days, or get an extension for another 30 days from the FWC, though action may continue indefinitely until there is agreement or the bargaining period is terminated. Protected industrial action is immune from liability in tort, so long as there is no personal injury, property damage or defamation. However if industrial action is taken that is unprotected, the FWC must issue a &quot;stop order&quot;, which may be backed by an injunction of the Federal Court, and ultimately sanctions for contempt of court including prison. There is a four hour pay penalty for unprotected action, and by law workers may not be paid during industrial action. Where duties are partially performed, at common law there is an obligation to pay for work accepted, unless the employer makes clear they will not accept partial performance, a position which encourages all out strikes and exacerbates disputes. Moreover, employers who cannot reasonably operate broken machinery, or is facing a closure from strikes, can stand down employees without pay. Even where industrial action is protected and valid, the FWC still has jurisdiction to suspend or terminate action if it threatens significant economic harm on application of a union or a federal or state Minister, if it threatens life, safety, health, welfare or part of the Australian economy, if a cooling off period would &quot;assist in resolving the matters at issue&quot;, or if there is significant harm to a third party. For instance, in the 2011 Qantas industrial disputes, the Minister intervened to get a stop order to suspend a pilot strike at Qantas, given the impact on the national tourism industry. Secondary boycotts have been banned since 1977, so that unions cannot take action in solidarity with workers in different workplaces, even where anti-productive competition is driving pay down in a race to the bottom across a whole sector. The ban is enforceable by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission regardless of whether the parties to a dispute pursue a complaint. It is not yet clear that self-employed workers have the right to take collective action, although under international law, the right to act and strike is guaranteed for &quot;everyone&quot;.

===Worker directors===
Although a majority of OECD countries protect the right of employees to vote for directors on boards of corporations (usually at least one-third), Australia has not yet passed a general law by amending the &quot;Corporations Act 2001&quot;, the &quot;Fair Work Act 2009&quot; or state laws for worker directors. However, Australia does have board-level employee representation (or &quot;codetermination&quot;) in occupational pensions, and several specific sectors. First, under the Hawke-Keating government Australia enacted a leading model for voice in worker&#x27;s capital, now in the &quot;Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993&quot; section 89, requiring an &quot;equal numbers of employer representatives and member representatives&quot; on the board of directors or trustees in a super-fund. However in 2010 this was amended to introduce so called &quot;independent directors&quot; who held the balance of power, appointed by the incumbent board, even though the evidence suggested this was a step backwards. There is not yet express legislation to require that asset managers, to whom investment and shareholder voting was outsourced, must follow the voting policies set by elected representatives on superannuation fund boards, as is found in Switzerland. 
Second, Australian public enterprises, state laws, and private corporations have frequently created worker directors, and voting rights for employees. In 1952 a trade union representative was included on the board of the new Electricity Commission of New South Wales. Other state electricity authorities did the same. The NSW State Dockyard and the railways included worker directors. There was also a worker director on the board of the South Australian Meat Corporation from 1972. In 1984 there were 19 different state corporations with worker directors. Under the &quot;Public Service Reform Act 1984&quot;, section 12 required that each government department &quot;in consultation with relevant staff organizations... cause to be developed an industrial democracy plan for the Department&quot;. By 1995, 13% of all workplaces surveyed had employee representatives on boards, most common in education, health, and communications. Federally there were worker directors at statutory corporations including the ABC, Qantas, Telstra, Australia Post and the Reserve Bank during the ALP Government from 1983-96. There were also requirements for employee-elected directors at major universities, such as the University of Melbourne, but not yet requirements for a majority to be elected by staff as is found in institutions such as Cambridge and Oxford.

==Equality==
Equal treatment is a fundamental right in international law because it has been universally recognised that people should be judged by the content of their character, their skills and knowledge, and not irrelevant characteristics. An equal treatment claim under the &quot;Fair Work Act 2009&quot; enables a complaint to the Fair Work Commission, similar to other labour rights. By contrast, claims under the &quot;Racial Discrimination Act 1975&quot;, the &quot;Sex Discrimination Act 1984&quot;, &quot;Disability Discrimination Act 1992&quot; and &quot;Age Discrimination Act 2004&quot; enable a separate path for claims to the Australian Human Rights Commission, created in 1986, which may resolve disputes by conciliation, or if that is unsuccessful claims can go to federal court. Within states, similar systems exist with a watchdog, and appeals to a Tribunal, for instance the Anti-Discrimination Board of NSW and then the NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal, but claimants cannot bring proceedings at both federal and state level, and so must choose. The &quot;FWA 2009&quot; section 27(1A) says that federal law does not exclude state anti-discrimination laws, meaning that greater protection can be provided by states where the federal government has not acted. Despite these rights to formal equality, structural problems (including unequal parental leave, and historic disadvantage) mean discrimination remains rife, so that the gender pay gap remains at 21.7% according to employer surveys, and the Indigenous pay gap is over 33%.

===Adverse action and exceptions===
The &quot;Fair Work Act 2009&quot; section 351 enables complaints of discrimination to be made against &quot;an employer&quot; for &quot;adverse action against a person who is an employee, or prospective employee&quot;. Independent contractors therefore must bring actions in state law where possible. The grounds for a complaint are based on five groups of protected characteristics, namely (a) race, colour, religion, political opinion, national extraction or social origin, (b) sex, sexual orientation, marital status, (c) age, (d) physical or mental disability, and (e) pregnancy, family or carer responsibility. If a complainant establishes that there is adverse action, and a prohibited ground, the onus of proof shifts to the employer which must prove that their reason for action was not tainted by the person&#x27;s protected characteristic.
A first main exception in section 351(2)(b) is the employer may show adverse action was permitted &quot;because of the inherent requirements of the particular position concerned&quot;. For instance, a genuine occupational requirement might be a theatre employer requiring a woman to act in a female part. In one of the leading cases, &quot;Qantas Airways Ltd v Christie&quot;, a pilot over the age of 60 failed in a claim against Qantas, which had a blanket ban on pilots over the age of 60. The High Court accepted Qantas’ argument that being younger was an &quot;inherent requirement&quot; because regional aviation regulators restricted pilots over 60, meaning he could not fly internationally. However the High Court also, more controversially, said that he could not be rostered solely for domestic flights because this could impair the employer’s roster management. Similarly controversial, in &quot;X v Commonwealth&quot; the High Court held in 1999 that it was lawful to dismiss a member of the Australian Defence Forces who was HIV positive, even though he was asymptomatic, on the ground that the illness risked infection of other personnel (even though that it medically untrue). McHugh J said that ‘carrying out the employment without endangering the safety of other employees is an inherent requirement of any employment’ (even though there is medically no danger). A second exception in section 351(2)(c) is that religious organisations with “doctrines, tenets, beliefs or teachings” may take action (even if otherwise adverse) in &quot;good faith&quot; to &quot;avoid injury to the religious susceptibilities of adherents of that religion or creed&quot;. According to the High Court in &quot;New Faith v Commissioner of Payroll Tax (Victoria)&quot; this will include all practices that would protect the “religious susceptibilities” of adherents to that faith.

A third exception in section 351(2)(a) is that employers are exempt from federal law if the action is &quot;not unlawful under any anti-discrimination law in force in the place where the action is taken&quot;. In &quot;Rumble v The Partnerships&quot; the Fair Work Commission held that a law firm consultant, Dr Rumble, could lawfully be dismissed for publicly criticising the Department of Defence for ignoring problems of sexual misconduct in the defence forces, because breach of the firm&#x27;s media comment policy was a valid reason for dismissal – and this was accepted to be lawful. But Perram J also gave the opinion that if the dismissal had taken place in NSW, which does not protect political opinions, then section 351(2)(a) would have defeated the claim.

===Harassment and bullying===
Harassment and bullying are persistent problems, particularly when they relate to discriminatory conduct. Harassment is unlawful based on similar protected characteristics as general equal treatment rights in different statutes, although there is not yet a single coherent codification of standards. &quot;Disability Discrimination Act 1992&quot; For example, under the &quot;Sex Discrimination Act 1984&quot; section 28A, sexual harassment means conduct of a sexual nature, that is unwelcome, where a &#x27;reasonable person&#x27; would have been offended, humiliated or intimidated&#x27;. This is also unlawful under the &quot;Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986&quot; section 3, and enables courts to pay compensate for loss or damage. Under section 28B it is unlawful for a person to sexually harass their employee, and employers are vicariously liable for conduct of any employee to another where a breach is &quot;in connection with&quot; employment. For example, in &quot;Richardson v Oracle Corporation Australia Pty Ltd&quot; the Federal Court awarded $130,000 in compensation for persistent sexual slurs against the claimant, who was forced to resign from her job, up from $18,000 given at first instance. In &quot;South Pacific Restor Hotels v Trainor&quot; an employer was held liable for harassment after work hours, but in accommodation provided by the employer. However employers may avoid liability if they have taken &quot;all reasonable steps&quot; to prevent harassment, which will usually mean swift action after a complaint.

The general law of tort may also provide remedies where an employer&#x27;s breach of the duty of care results in particular harm, such as psychiatric injury. In &quot;Naidu v Group 4 Securitas Pty Ltd&quot; Mr Naidu, while working as a security guard through labour hire firm ISS Security at Nationwide News, was subjected to racial abuse, physical assault, threats to be fired and never work again, and making Mr Naidu work for free at the home of the abusive supervisor, Mr Chaloner. He was psychologically scarred, without a job and his marriage broke down as a result. On appeal, the NSW court upheld damages against Nationwide News of $1,767,050, but rejected damages against ISS on the basis that there was not a &quot;reasonably foreseeable risk of cognisable psychiatric harm to the plaintiff&quot;, even though ISS was benefitting from Mr Naidu&#x27;s labour as much as Nationwide News. Because the wider issue of bullying is a general problem, in 2013 the &quot;Fair Work Act 2009&quot; Part 6-4B was added to prohibit being &quot;bullied at work&quot;. This means repeated and unreasonable behaviour that creates a risk to health and safety. It includes &quot;intimidation, coercion, threats, humiliation, shouting, sarcasm, victimisation, terrorising, singling-out, malicious pranks, physical abuse, verbal abuse, emotional abuse, belitting, bad faith, harassment, conspiracy to harm, ganging-up, isolation, freezing-out, ostracisim, innuendo, rumour-mongering, disrespect, mobbing, mocking, victim-blaming and discrimination.&quot; It must be repeated, and if so the Fair Work Commission may make an order for the behaviour to cease and to be corrected, and must do so within 14 days. This does not, however, result in compensation, and cannot be done if the bully or the victim are no longer employed. Ideally, employers should also act by having an anti-bullying policy and training its supervisors and workforce to create a cohesive culture at work.

===Indirect discrimination===
Although the &quot;Fair Work Act 2009&quot; does not expressly distinguish direct and indirect discrimination as other federal legislation does, and state legislation does, if a rule that is neutral on its face has a disparate impact on one group, this will also be unlawful. For example, in &quot;Australian Iron &amp; Steel Pty Ltd v Banovic&quot; an employer’s policy for redundancy based on “last in, first off” was held to be indirect discrimination against women, who at that mining workplace has mostly only been recently employed. Similarly in &quot;Song v Ainsworth Game Technology Pty Ltd&quot; a woman won a claim for indirect discrimination, after she was told she could not work full time, and also use her break time to transfer her child from school to after school care. Such a rule disparately impacted women, especially since it was found that other staff could take cigarette breaks without reducing their work hours.
Indirect discrimination is often structural, and this is seen in the gender pay gap of 21.7% across the Australian workforce, meaning women employees earn on average 78.3 cents compared to each $1 for male employees, according to the annual employer census. The main reasons for the gender pay gap are sex discrimination in child care and parental leave laws based on &quot;persistent cultural norms that see women as more likely to undertake primary carer duties for children and family&quot;, &quot;outright gender-based discrimination at work&quot;, &quot;patterns of workforce engagement&quot; and occupational segregation. Under the &quot;Fair Work Act 2009&quot; section 302, employees, unions and the Sex Discrimination Commissioner can make an equal pay claim. The first post-2009 cases were brought by unions for social and community service workers, supported by the government. The Fair Work Commission interprets the appropriate comparator narrowly. Before 2009, the &quot;Librarians case&quot;, librarians were awarded a pay increase since the skill and education levels were comparable to better paid male-dominated industries.

Structural discrimination also underlies much of the race pay gap in Australia. The first time Indigenous employees became legally entitled to equal pay with white workers, in cattle and farming jobs, was through a decision in 1966. The exclusion in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904 section 4 for &quot;persons engaged in domestic service&quot; meant that many Indigenous women and girls employed as domestic staff were excluded. The &quot;Racial Discrimination Act 1975&quot; created the first general right against race discrimination. However, in 2019 the median adjusted weekly household income for Indigenous Australians over 15 was just $623 compared to $935 for non-Indigenous residents, a 33.3% race pay gap. In 2016, the census showed a gap of 72% employment for non-Indigenous Australians to just 47% employment rate for Indigenous Australians. There have not yet been institutions to set aside a portion of the funds from Australia&#x27;s natural resources for Indigenous Australian well-being, nor are there yet clear principles established to ensure that historic disadvantage is undone, as in South Africa, India, or Europe, through positive action.

===Positive action and disability===

Positive action is designed to remedy historical disadvantage, but Australia has very few measures at federal level. Under the &quot;Disability Discrimination Act 1992&quot; sections 4 to 6 require that an employer must make reasonable adjustments to accommodate people with disabilities at work. However, under section 11 the employer may escape this duty if they show that it would impose an unjustifiable hardship, taking account of the expenses and the employer’s capacity to afford it. For example, in &quot;Daghlian v Australian Postal Corporation&quot; it was held to be a reasonable adjustment that the employer provided a stool for a worker who would otherwise usually be required to stand. This modifies the “inherent requirements” defence found in section 21A(1)(b).

==Job security==
Job security, as part of social security, is a universal human right in international law, and with full employment it is the basis of economic stability and prosperity. Most Australian employees are entitled to reasonable notice before any dismissal, fair reasons and a procedure before being dismissed, and a redundancy payment. Both state and federal governments have a duty to ensure full employment through fiscal policy, while by law the Reserve Bank of Australia must also achieve a stable currency, full employment, and prosperity and welfare for the people of Australia.

===Reasonable notice===
In Australian law, most employees have the right to reasonable notice before dismissal, and dismissals must be for a fair reason, however these rights are not universally upheld. At common law, everyone has the right to reasonable notice before either side terminates a contract, The longer that people work for an employer, the more notice becomes reasonable, reflecting the concept of mutual respect. For example, in &quot;Quinn v Jack Chia (Australia)&quot; Mr Quinn had been initially hired on a contract with a one month notice, but had worked for years, taking on senior responsibilities, and making personal sacrifices for his employer. The court held he was entitled to 12 months, not one month as the contract had said, given his length of service, seniority and dedication over the years. As well as these common law standards, the &quot;Fair Work Act 2009&quot; section 117 requires a bare minimum of 1 week&#x27;s notice before 1 year, 2 weeks&#x27; notice for 2 years, 3 weeks&#x27; notice for over 3 years, and 4 weeks&#x27; notice for over &quot;5&quot; years, but also an extra week for employees over 45 years old who have worked more than 2 years. Modern awards can and often do have higher standards, and so do collective agreements. The dominant view is that courts may find greater notice is warranted where the facts speak in favour, because statute&#x27;s purpose is to create a floor of rights, not a ceiling, that common law may improve upon, not undercut. An employer may give pay in lieu of notice under section 117(2) and terminate the contract if this has been accepted by the employee.

The one situation where notice is not required is where a party commits a serious breach of contract. In these cases, an employee can quit on the spot and claim damages, or an employer can dismiss the employee. According to &quot;Bartlett v ANZ Banking Group Ltd&quot; a serious breach of the employment contract can include deliberate disobedience of a lawful and reasonable order, breaching the duty of fidelity (e.g. by taking secret commissions), or serious incompetence. In this case, an ANZ Bank employee won damages for wrongful dismissal on appeal, measured by 4 months notice that his contract required, since ANZ could not prove he had actually engaged in misconduct of sending confidential information to a journalist at the Australian Financial Review, and the employer had an obligation to act reasonably. This default position at common law may be replaced with contractual procedures before dismissal, but if not, an employer must simply show a sound reason for summary dismissal.

===Fair reasons and process===

Because common law judges historically gave inadequate remedies for workers who were dismissed, and let employers dictate the terms of dismissal by contract, the &quot;Fair Work Act 2009&quot; section 382 contains the right to be &quot;protected from unfair dismissal&quot;, if the person is an employee, and under section 383 they have been working for at least 6 months, or one year for an employee of an employer with under 15 staff. Small businesses may have a defence if they comply with the &quot;Small Business Fair Dismissal Code&quot;. In addition, employees must be covered by an award or enterprise agreement, and have an income below $167,500 in July 2023 (the &quot;high income threshold&quot;). Another exception is that &quot;casual&quot; employees have no rights unless they have a &quot;reasonable expectation of continuing employment by the employer on a regular and systematic basis&quot;. In &quot;Ponce v DJT Staff Management Services&quot; a traffic controller employed through a labour hire firm, and classed as &quot;casual&quot;, had unpredictable work shifts and some breaks in work, but was still held to have had work on a regular and systematic basis. Unlike in most high income countries, the &quot;Fair Work Act 2009&quot; fails to treat expiry of fixed-term contracts as a dismissal that must be fair. The meaning of dismissal includes termination, or being forced to resign by the employer&#x27;s conduct, or demotion with a significant reduction of pay or duties.
A dismissal will be &quot;unfair&quot; if it is &quot;harsh, unjust or unreasonable&quot;, and according to the High Court in &quot;Byrne v Australian Airlines&quot; this includes the concept of the employer whose action &quot;is disproportionate to the gravity of the misconduct&quot; of the employee. Under section 387, the Fair Work Commission should consider factors including the employee&#x27;s capacity and conduct, notice given, an opportunity to respond to any allegation, representation given, warnings before dismissal, and the enterprise&#x27;s size and HR specialists. For example, in &quot;Pastrycooks Employees, Biscuit Makers Employees and Flour and Sugar Goods Workers Union (NSW) v Gartrell&quot; it was held too harsh to dismiss a bakery worker who refused to do a last minute delivery on his way home. In &quot;Agnew v Nationwide News Pty Ltd&quot; it was held to be unfair to fire employees who drank alcohol at lunchtime, because even though the company had a policy against this it was not consistently enforced especially among managers. In &quot;B, C and D v Australian Postal Corporation&quot; it was held to be unfair to dismiss three employees who accessed pornography at work because though there was a policy, it was not consistently enforced and there were no prior warnings to the three who were caught. According to the Fair Work Commission, it is relevant whether the employee has a past disciplinary history, whether an employer has a &quot;history of toleration or condonation of the misconduct&quot;, and the employees&#x27; past conduct, length of service and consequences for dependents. By contrast in &quot;Fussell v Transport for NSW&quot; it was held fair to dismiss an employee who sent &quot;an offensive image of his own anatomy&quot; over Snapchat to a work colleague who he thought was a private friend - even though he immediately apologised. Under section 390, the Fair Work Commission can order compensation or reinstatement, though in 2018 to 2019 of 8161 unfair dismissal conciliation cases, only 57 settlements included reinstatement, and of 229 arbitration cases just 13 resulted in reinstatement. Under section 392, compensation is limited to 26 weeks&#x27; pay or half the high income threshold, regardless of the actual economic loss, distress or social cost of the dismissal. To claim, claimants must fill in a form on the FWC website within 21 days of the dismissal date, and extensions are rarely granted. The employer is asked to respond, there is a telephone conference, and if not resolved the FWC can determine the case by arbitration. The FWC only allows appeals if it thinks there is a question of public interest. An employer&#x27;s refusal to follow an order can be pursued in Federal Court.

===Redundancy and transmissions===

A dismissal for redundancy means that a job is no longer economically necessary for an employer&#x27;s operations. To ensure the power of dismissal is not misused, the law attempts to ensure that the social costs of unemployment and dislocation are factored into the employer&#x27;s decisions. Under the &quot;Fair Work Act 2009&quot; section 531(2), employers must consult with unions if they contemplate that 15 or more jobs could be redundant, and under section 530 the employer must also give written notice to Centrelink of any proposals. The goal of the law is to avoid job losses, and so under section 531(3) the employer must consult unions on proposals on &quot;measures to avert or minimise the proposed dismissals&quot;, alternative employment or mitigating adverse effects of proposed redundancies. If redundancies must take place, the National Employment Standard in section 119 requires minimum redundancy payments of at least 4 weeks&#x27; pay for employees that have worked over 1 year to 16 weeks&#x27; pay for people with at least 9 years&#x27; work, while those over 10 years&#x27; work may take advantage of long service leave and redundancy pay. However, employees can not take redundancy if they have been offered an acceptable alternative job. There are also a series of arbitrary exceptions to redundancy rights. Employees of employers with under 15 staff get nothing, on the theory that small businesses need protection more than workers. Casual, trainee and weekly fixed term employees are also excluded from protection, even though this means around 22% of the Australian workforce. Finally, if an employer is insolvent, at common law the insolvency terminates contracts on reasonable notice. To protect pay, under the &quot;Fair Entitlements Guarantee Act 2012&quot; the federal government has a scheme for payments to employees whose wages are not otherwise covered.

==Constitutional and state laws==
The &quot;Barger&quot; decision was made in the context of the then prevailing reserved State powers doctrine, which was itself overturned in 1920 in the &quot;Engineers case&quot;.

Since 2005, Australian industrial relations laws, such as WorkChoices, have been primarily based on the corporations power in section 51(xx) of the Constitution, which enables labour laws to be of much wider reach, without the constraints imposed by the conciliation and arbitration power. The corporations power gives the federal parliament power to make laws with respect to &quot;trading and financial corporations formed within the limits of the Commonwealth&quot;, as well as &#x27;foreign&#x27; corporations.

===State law===
The Victorian Government has referred most of its industrial relations powers to the Commonwealth, most recently via the &quot;Fair Work (Commonwealth Powers) Act 2009&quot; (Vic), resulting in a majority of public sector workers in Victoria being covered by the FW Act.

<text>Mount Inglismaldie is the second-highest peak of the Fairholme Range in Banff National Park. It is located immediately west of Mount Girouard in the Bow River valley south of Lake Minnewanka.

The mountain was named in 1886 by park superintendent George A. Stewart after Inglismaldie Castle in Kincardineshire, Scotland.

The first ascent of the mountain was made in 1933 by H. Foster, J. Packer, M.C. Wylie, Betts, Dickson, W. Innes, L. DeCouteur, J. Miskow, Sadler, and Vallance with guide Lawrence Grassi.

==Geology==
Like other mountains in Banff National Park, Mount Inglismaldie is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny.

==Climate==
Based on the Köppen climate classification, Mount Inglismaldie is located in a subarctic climate with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Winter temperatures can drop below −20 °C with wind chill factors below −30 °C. Precipitation runoff from Mount Inglismaldie drains into Lake Minnewanka and the Bow River.

<text>The state cessions are the areas of the United States that the separate states ceded to the federal government in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The cession of these lands, which for the most part lay between the Appalachian Mountains and the Mississippi River, was key to establishing a harmonious union among the former British colonies.

The areas ceded comprise , or 10.4 percent of current United States territory, and make up all or part of 10 states. This does not include the areas later ceded by Texas to the federal government, which make up parts of five more states.

==Background==
Most of the British American colonies were established in the 17th and early 18th century when geographical knowledge of North America was incomplete. Many of these colonies were established by royal proclamation or charter that defined their boundaries as stretching &quot;from sea to sea&quot;; others did not have western boundaries established at all. These colonies thus ended up with theoretical extents that overlapped each other and conflicted with the claims and settlements established by other European powers. The British government&#x27;s Royal Proclamation of 1763, while not resolving the disputes over the colonies&#x27; trans-Appalachian claims, succeeded in slowing down the movement of people into the region and the making of new claims in it. Many, however, ignored the proclamation, and various frontier settlement enterprises, owing allegiance to disparate colonial governments, continued.

By the time of the American Revolution, the boundaries between the Thirteen Colonies that became the United States had been for the most part surveyed and agreed upon. Their land claims also corresponded in varying degrees to the actual reality on the ground in the west at the eve of the Revolution. Kentucky, for instance, was organized into a county of Virginia in 1776, with Virginia serving as practical sovereign over the area until its admission into the Union as a separate state in 1792. Massachusetts&#x27; claims to land in modern-day Michigan and Wisconsin, by contrast, amounted to little more than lines drawn on a map.

The Treaty of Paris (1763) that ended the war known as the French and Indian War in North America had France cede most of its claims to land on the continent to Great Britain and Spain. Great Britain, gaining the eastern half of France&#x27;s southern lands, extended the claims of its colonies of Massachusetts, Connecticut, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia to the Mississippi River; in some cases, this reinforced earlier charter claims.

==The resolution of the claims==
The Treaty of Paris (1783) that ended the American Revolution established American sovereignty over the land between the Appalachians and the Mississippi; the jobs of determining how that land should be governed, and how the conflicting claims to it by several of the states should be resolved, were one of the first major tasks facing the new nation.

The potential for trouble arising from these claims was twofold. One problem was obvious: in many cases more than one state laid claim to the same piece of territory, but clearly only one would be ultimately recognized as the sovereign. The other conflict also threatened the peace of the new union. Only seven of the thirteen states had western land claims, and the other, &quot;landless&quot; states were fearful of being overwhelmed by states that controlled vast stretches of the new frontier. Virginia in particular, which already encompassed 1 in 5 inhabitants of the new nation, laid claim to modern-day Kentucky, and the vast territory it called Illinois County, and the smaller states feared that it would come to completely dominate the union.

In the end, most of the trans-Appalachian land claims were ceded to the Federal government between 1781 and 1787; New York, New Hampshire, and the hitherto unrecognized Vermont government resolved their squabbles by 1791, and Kentucky was separated from Virginia and made into a new state in 1792. The cessions were not entirely selfless—in some cases the cessions were made in exchange for federal assumption of the states&#x27; Revolutionary War debts—but the states&#x27; reasonably graceful cessions of their oft-conflicting claims prevented early, perhaps catastrophic, rifts among the states of the young Republic, and assuaged the fears of the &quot;landless&quot; states enough to convince them to ratify the new United States Constitution. The cessions also set the stage for the settlement of the Upper Midwest and the expansion of the U.S. into the center of the North American continent, and also established the pattern by which land newly acquired by the United States would be organized into new states rather than attached to old ones.

Georgia held on to its claims over trans-Appalachian land for another decade, and this claim was complicated by the fact that much of the land was also disputed between the United States and Spain. When Georgia finally sold the land west of its current boundaries to the United States for cash in 1802, the last phase of western cessions was complete.

==Details of the cessions==

==Texas==

Later in the 19th century, there was one more case of a state ceding some of its land to the federal government. Before the Republic of Texas joined the United States in 1845, it &quot;claimed&quot; a good deal of land that had never been under the &quot;de facto&quot; control of the Texan government – Texan attempts to exercise control of these territories as a sovereign state (most famously, the Santa Fe expedition) had ended in disaster. Thus, there was a border dispute between Texas, Mexico, and Native American tribes that the U.S. government inherited upon the annexation of Texas. This was one of the causes of the Mexican–American War of 1846–47 (another being the western land aspirations of the U.S. coupled with the refusal by the United Mexican States to sell its territory to the U.S.). After the American victory in that war, the Mexican government recognized American sovereignty over the disputed Texan lands and also ceded/sold the land extending west to the Pacific Ocean. The Mexican government was paid $25,000,000 under the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo of 1848.

In addition, the maximalist land claims of the Republic of Texas did not set the northern and western borders of the State of Texas. Most, but not all, of its northern boundary had been set by a treaty between the United States and the Spanish Empire – along the Red River.

In an act of Congress, the Compromise of 1850, Texas ceded its conflicting northern and western territorial claims to the U.S. in return for debt relief, removing its conflicting claims from the U.S. territorial gains of the Mexican–American War. This ceded land eventually became portions of the states of Kansas (1861), Colorado (1876), Wyoming (1890), Oklahoma (1907), and New Mexico (1912).

<doc id="1028778" wikidata="Q3492309" url="?curid=1028778" title="10 (Southern Cross Austereo)">
<text>10 was an Australian television network distributed by Southern Cross Austereo (SCA) in regional Queensland, southern New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory, regional Victoria, the Spencer Gulf and Broken Hill. SCA&#x27;s network was the primary affiliate of Network 10 in these regional areas.

On 17 December 2024, Southern Cross Austereo announced the sale of their regional television licenses in Regional Queensland, Southern NSW/ACT and Regional Victoria to Network 10. The sale was completed on 1 March 2025.

==History==

===Origins===
Southern Cross began as a small network of three stations in regional Victoria. The &quot;Southern Cross TV8&quot; network comprised GLV-10 Gippsland, BCV-8 Bendigo, and STV-8 Mildura.

GLV was the first regional television station in the country, launched on 9 December 1961. BCV-8 launched in the same year, on 23 December, while STV followed four years later, on 27 November 1965. GLV-10 became GLV-8 in 1980, when Melbourne commercial station ATV-0 moved frequencies to become ATV-10 The network began life in 1982 as &quot;Southern Cross TV8&quot;, but later changed its name in 1989 to the &quot;Southern Cross Network&quot;. Soon after this, STV-8 left the network after it was bought by businessman Alan Bond, and eventually sold on to ENT Limited (owners of Vic TV and Tas TV).

===1992–2016: 10 affiliation===
Regional Victoria was aggregated in 1992. VIC Television, based in Shepparton and Ballarat affiliated with the Nine Network, while Prime Television, based in Albury-Wodonga became an affiliate of the Seven Network. Southern Cross, therefore, took on an affiliation with Network Ten. Soon after, it changed its name and logo to &quot;SCN&quot;, directly emulating the look of its metropolitan counterpart. Local news was axed six months later, while the name and logo changed once again to &quot;Ten Victoria&quot; along with new names &quot;Ten Capital&quot;, &quot;Ten Northern NSW&quot; &amp; &quot;Ten Queensland&quot; as they carried and introduced the Network Ten logo into their brand.

Canberra-based station Capital Television was purchased by Southern Cross&#x27; owner, Southern Cross Broadcasting, in 1994. It was soon integrated into the network, taking on the name &quot;Ten Capital&quot; soon after.

Southern Cross Broadcasting acquired Telecasters Australia in 2001. As a result, Ten Queensland and Ten Northern NSW became a part of the Southern Cross Ten network, while Telecasters&#x27; other assets – Seven Darwin and Seven Central – were later integrated into the Southern Cross network. Local news bulletins in Canberra and parts of Queensland were axed on 22 November 2001 – one of a number of moves taken by Southern Cross and competitor Prime Television that resulted in an investigation by the Australian Broadcasting Authority into the adequacy of regional news. 

The network expanded into the Spencer Gulf and Broken Hill areas on 31 December 2003 under a supplementary license granted to Southern Cross GTS/BKN by the ABA.

Southern Cross Ten moved away from generic Network Ten branding – in use since the early 1990s for most areas – with a new logo, similar to that of parent company Southern Cross Broadcasting in 2005.

Three-minute local news updates were introduced in 2004, following recommendations put into place following the ABA&#x27;s report. The brief bulletins, produced out of the network&#x27;s Canberra production centre, are made for the network&#x27;s seventeen license areas.

Southern Cross Ten began broadcasting MyTalk, a datacast channel owned by Southern Cross Broadcasting on 13 April 2007 on LCN 55.

It was anticipated that the network would be acquired by the Macquarie Media Group, following a A$1.35 billion takeover recommendation made to shareholders by Southern Cross Broadcasting on 3 July 2007, and on 5 November 2007, this purchase was completed.

Southern Cross Ten ceased to broadcast MyTalk on 25 February 2008, after the Macquarie acquisition.

Southern Cross Ten began broadcasting Ten&#x27;s digital channel, One HD (now 10 Bold) on 2 July 2009 on LCN 50.

Southern Cross Ten began broadcasting Ten&#x27;s digital channel, Eleven (now 10 Peach) on 11 January 2011 on LCN 55.

Southern Cross Ten began broadcasting Ten&#x27;s datacast channel, TVSN in December 2012 on LCN 54.

Southern Cross Ten began broadcasting its own datacast channel, Aspire TV on 21 May 2013 on LCN 56.

===2016–2021: Affiliation with Nine Entertainment===
On 29 April 2016, Southern Cross Austereo announced that it had signed a five-year affiliation deal with Nine Entertainment Co., owner of the Nine Network, for almost $500 million, taking the place of WIN Television as the primary regional Nine affiliate. On 1 July 2016, Southern Cross switched its primary affiliation from Network Ten to the Nine Network and Nine&#x27;s metropolitan branding was introduced across Southern Cross&#x27; television assets in Queensland, Southern NSW and Victoria, joining its existing Nine affiliate station in Spencer Gulf, SA and Broken Hill, NSW. Southern Cross&#x27; Northern NSW station, NRN, was not part of the deal as the Nine-owned NBN Television already operated in the region.

Upon the affiliation change, the channel listing for Southern Cross&#x27; Nine-affiliated stations was reshuffled with Nine on channels 5 and 51, 9HD on channel 50, 9Gem on channel 52 in standard definition, 9Go! on channel 53, 9Life on channel 54 and Aspire TV on channel 56. GDS/BDN Spencer Gulf/Broken Hill remained unchanged with Nine on channel 8, 9Gem on channel 80 and 9Go! on channel 88. As a result TVSN stopped broadcasting and was replaced with a &quot;To Be Advised&quot; slide until being replaced with Yesshop on 1 August 2016.

Due to the need to import and install the required equipment, Southern Cross originally stated that it would not immediately offer Nine&#x27;s digital services 9HD and 9Life upon the transition; the broadcaster stated that they planned to begin transmitting them by mid-August—a delay which would have caused the third match of the 2016 State of Origin series on 13 July to not be transmitted in high definition in the affected regions—which includes parts of the New South Wales and Queensland regions who play the series. However, on 24 June 2016, Southern Cross announced that it had been &quot;working tirelessly to get HD to air as quickly as possible&quot;, and 9HD became available from launch day on channel 50. The same approach also prompted 9Life to return early on 17 July 2016.

Southern Cross announced on 25 July 2016 that it would broadcast the New Zealand-based home shopping channel Yesshop as a datacast service. The channel became available on 1 August 2016 in Queensland, Southern NSW, ACT and Victoria on LCN 55. However, Yesshop&#x27;s owner (Yes Retail) made the decision to cease trading on 29 September 2016 citing lack of funds to pay wages and the company&#x27;s current losses of approximately 20 million dollars. Employees were terminated the same day, and the channels were removed on Freeview later that day.

Following months of negotiations, Southern Cross finalised an agreement on 28 March 2017 to sell their Ten-affiliated Northern NSW station, NRN, to WIN Television for a total of $55 million, with the sale taking effect on 31 May 2017. Due to operational logistics, WIN did not commence broadcasting their identity to the NRN market until 1 September 2017. This sale relieved Southern Cross of their only sole Ten-affiliated station, with their remaining Ten affiliate, SGS/SCN operating in the Spencer Gulf/Broken Hill region where Southern Cross holds monopoly ownership of all three network affiliates.

On 17 July 2017, Southern Cross launched American religious channel SonLife Broadcasting Network (SBN), owned by evangelist Jimmy Swaggart, as a datacast service. The channel is broadcast in regional Queensland, Southern NSW &amp; ACT, and regional Victoria on channel 55 via Southern Cross&#x27; Nine-affiliated stations, and in Tasmania on channel 64, Spencer Gulf SA &amp; Broken Hill NSW on channel 54, and Darwin on channel 74 via Southern Cross&#x27; Seven affiliate remaining stations.

===2021–2024: Return to 10 affiliation===

On 12 March 2021, Nine announced that it would return to WIN Television as its regional affiliate in most markets beginning on 1 July 2021, in a deal that would last at least seven years. This has ended SCA&#x27;s five-year agreement with the Nine Network. On 25 June 2021, SCA and Network 10 announced a two-year affiliation deal in regional Queensland, Southern NSW and regional Victoria, which introduced 10 Shake into regional areas for the very first time and it broadcasts on Channel 54, as well as Sky News Regional which launched on 1 August 2021 and it broadcasts on Channel 56. On this network, Aspire TV ceased to broadcast on 31 July 2021, to accommodate Sky News Regional.

The affiliation deal between SCA and Network 10 was extended to 31 December 2023, on 27 June 2023. 

SCA began broadcasting 10&#x27;s datacast channel, Gecko on 1 July 2023 on LCN 57.

===2024–present: Sale of stations===

On 17 December 2024, Southern Cross Austereo announced they are selling their regional television licenses in Regional Queensland, Southern NSW/ACT and Regional Victoria over to their affiliate Network 10. As part of the sale, SCA will receive a share of profits from the stations for the first 5 years post-completion. The sale was completed on 1 March 2025.

On 26 February 2025, Southern Cross Austereo announced they are selling their remaining regional television licenses, including their remaining 10 affiliated stations in the Spencer Gulf and Broken Hill to Australian Digital Holdings. This will mark SCA&#x27;s exit from television broadcasting. The sale of the stations is yet to be finalised.

==Programming==
Southern Cross&#x27;s programming schedule is almost identical to that of its metropolitan counterpart, Network 10, with some differences.

The channel previously broadcast &quot;State Focus&quot; at 12pm Sunday from February 2004 until January 2009, a magazine program featuring interviews from people across the regions where the channel broadcasts. It was presented by Guy Sweeting in Southern NSW and in Canberra, Mike Frame in regional Queensland, and Judi Hogan in regional Victoria and Amy Bainbridge in Northern NSW. The channel also broadcasts infomercials, which until 2009, were shown in place of &quot;Judge Judy&quot; during the day and are in place of some other programs overnight. As well as this, locally produced programming such as &quot;Hook, Line and Sinker&quot;, &quot;Country Matters&quot;, &quot;The Hit List TV&quot;, &quot;Landed Music&quot;, &quot;The Benchwarmers Oz Made&quot; and &quot;The Hit Rater.com&quot; were also shown on the channel in the past.

===News and current affairs===

==== Southern Cross news updates (2004–2017) ====
Prior to 2017, short local news updates were aired throughout the day for each of the seventeen licence areas served throughout regional Queensland, New South Wales, the ACT and Victoria. These updates were broadcast throughout the network&#x27;s daytime and primetime programming, hourly and lasting from one to three minutes, branded variously as &quot;Southern Cross News&quot;, &quot;Southern Cross Ten News&quot;, &quot;Southern Cross Ten Local News&quot; (2014–16) and &quot;Local News Headlines&quot; (2016–17). The updates were produced from Southern Cross Austereo&#x27;s studio in Canberra and made use of news content from local radio stations owned by SCA in each market. Local sports and weather reports also aired on a sporadic basis. Short updates were also aired throughout the day and evening alongside updates from &quot;10 News First&quot;, or from 2016, &quot;Nine News&quot;. The bulletins are researched, produced and presented by a single journalist.

Prior to the formation of the Southern Cross Ten network, the Canberra and North Queensland stations broadcast one-hour nightly localised news bulletins. However, both were axed in late 2001 due to cost-cutting measures.

Regional programming was reintroduced in March 2011 with the launch of &quot;Weeknights&quot;, a 30-minute regional news magazine program broadcast in Shepparton and the Goulburn Valley, only to be axed in May 2015.

==== Nine News Regional (2017–2021) ====
As part of the new affiliation deal between the Nine Network and Southern Cross in 2016, the &quot;Local News Headlines&quot; were phased out on their now-Nine affiliated stations and were replaced by full one-hour local &quot;Nine News&quot; bulletins produced by Nine. In August 2016, the director of Nine&#x27;s news &amp; current affairs division, Darren Wick announced that Queensland news director Mike Dalton had been appointed to head the new Nine News Regional division to initiate Nine and Southern Cross Austereo&#x27;s new regional news service in 2017.

Southern Cross&#x27; Nine-affiliated stations that received the bulletins were TNQ Queensland, CTC Southern New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory, and GLV/BCV Victoria. The bulletins were produced by Nine News, presented from Nine&#x27;s existing studio facilities in Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne respectively.

The bulletins&#x27; formats were similar in style to the Nine-owned &quot;NBN News&quot; bulletin in northern New South Wales, as a composite of international, national and local news. On 17 March 2020, production on the composite bulletins were suspended indefinitely, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with reporters deployed to the metropolitan bulletins in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane.

==== 10 News First local updates, Sky News agreement (2021–present) ====
Following the switch back to Network 10 affiliation on 1 July 2021, Southern Cross returned to producing local news updates after a five-year absence. The updates carry the &quot;10 News First&quot; branding and are produced out of the networks Launceston (QLD updates) and Hobart (Southern NSW and VIC updates) studios. The Southern NSW and Canberra updates are presented by Will Boddy, the Regional Queensland updates are presented by Stacey Eldridge, and the Regional Victoria updates are presented by Kasey Wilkins. The updates, which typically don&#x27;t include any corresponding news footage or soundbites, are researched, produced and presented by a single journalist. Fill-in presenters include Sarah Bennallack, Madeline Kerr and Zeke Gaffney.

In May 2021, SCA reached a content agreement with Sky News Australia, under which it would distribute the new free-to-air Sky News Regional beginning 1 August 2021. The service is a &quot;de facto&quot; replacement for the Sky News on WIN service that it previously distributed.

==Availability==
Southern Cross is available in standard definition and high definition digital format. In all areas, an additional 1080i high definition simulcast is also available. The network is available primarily through free-to-air terrestrial transmitters, with subscription cable also provided by TransACT and Neighbourhood Cable in the Australian Capital Territory and Ballarat, respectively.

Southern Cross Austereo operates the following stations which broadcast Network 10 programming: 

* GLV and BCV in regional Victoria
* CTC in southern New South Wales
* TNQ in regional Queensland
* SGS in the Spencer Gulf of South Australia 
* SCN in Broken Hill
==Logos==
Southern Cross&#x27;s first networked logo produced and used across its regional stations was in 2002, featuring the word &quot;Southern Cross&quot; below Network Ten&#x27;s logo. This logo was used across the network until 2005, when a new logo was introduced featuring a blue and yellow star with the word &quot;Ten&quot; added beside &quot;Southern Cross&quot;. This logo was used between 2005 and 2016, and was launched concurrently with similarly designed logos on Southern Cross&#x27; Seven-affiliated stations and across Southern Cross Broadcasting&#x27;s other assets.

Once Southern Cross switched affiliation to Nine on 1 July 2016, the channel switched to using full time Nine branding.

Following the reversal of the 2016 regional affiliation switch on 1 July 2021, the channel switched to using full time 10 branding.

<doc id="1028796" wikidata="Q2017729" url="?curid=1028796" title="Oku, Cameroon">
<text>Oku is a subdivision in North West Region, (formerly North West Province), Cameroon. The term Oku also refers to the people who live in this region ruled by a Paramount Monarch HRM King Ngum IV. Ngum Ernest Merlin Shang] and the primary language that they speak (although English is also widely spoken). Oku is a rural area containing about 36 villages with the population of about 180,000 inhabitants . The nearest really large city is Bamenda, but Kumbo, which is closer (about from the village of Keyon, or about 70 minutes by car, as the road network is not good and not paved), is large enough to have telephone lines and a Baptist-run hospital. Oku also has a Sub-divisional hospital. However, three mobile telephone networks (MTN, ORANGE, CAMTEL) are available in Oku. As such, mobile internet facilities are available.

==Geography and climate==
Oku is a very mountainous region, around above sea level, and thus rather cool considering its latitude. It is not cold enough for snow, but at night during the dry season temperatures drop below human comfort range. Mount Oku, a stratovolcano, reaches a height of 3011 metres (9880 feet) and is the second highest mountain of Cameroon after Mount Fako (better known as Mount Cameroon).

The broader Oku or Foumbot volcanic field also includes many scoria cones and maars, several of which are filled by crater lakes. Lake Oku is a crater lake. Two of the crater lakes, Lake Nyos and Lake Monoun, have been the subject of extensive research. Quantities of gas build up in the lakes and are occasionally released; being heavier than air, they pour down the mountainside and can suffocate entire villages. Some of the locals believe that a god lives in the lake and must be appeased.

The region is an important one for biodiversity, especially the Kelum mountain Forest.

Oku has many well graded earth road linking its various villages and neighbouring subdivisions like Noni, Babessi and Kumbo central, although none of them would be called good by most Westerners.
Oku has recently got a road link through Babungo from Bamenda. One can now take two hours from Bamenda through Ibal Oku, Mbockevuh, Mawes*lake oku* through Tolon, Chiar, Ikal to Elak and to Banso.

==Economy==
Oku is characterized by subsistence farming. There is a shortage of arable land, and the people farm even the steep hillsides. A typical practice is to plant beans, corn, and potatoes together in the same furrows. 

There is also a lot of bee farming in Oku, and Oku is the only area in the whole of Cameroon that produces the natural white honey. The Oku Honey Cooperative manage and sell what bee farmers harvest. Oku white honey is produced in the nationally protected forest of Kilum Ijim near Mount Oku. Rising up to 2,000 meters above sea level, the Kilum Ijim forest is a rich, diverse ecosystem covering over 20,000 hectares. Two plants that yield white flowers in particular - &quot;Astropanax abyssinicus&quot; and &quot;Nuxia congesta&quot; - work in combination with the environment help give Oku white honey its unique properties, especially its creamy white color. 

With funding from AFD, support from CIRAD, and implementation by OAPI, Cameroon was the first country in Africa to have protected geographical indication (PGI) registered, of which Oku white honey was one of the first registrations made in 2013. To ensure a consistent high level of quality, the PGI enumerates specific standards for how Oku white honey is produced. Beehive construction, designated locations in the forest for beehive installation, and required equipment and practices for harvesting honey all have requirements that must be followed. Once the honey is transferred from the forest, specific processing techniques are also adhered to. Such practices include refraining from harvesting during rain, ensuring the use of clean and dry buckets to transfer the honey, and processing the honey in a prescribed, traditional method. Notwithstanding various challenges such as deforestation from logging that threatens the Kilum Ijim forest and the bees’ habitat, the Oku white honey PGI has brought increased awareness to the product. In 2014 between eight and ten metric tons of Oku white honey were produced annually. Only a few years after the Geographical Indication was registered, sale prices per kilogram have increased by up to 40 percent and hundreds of new apiculture NGOs, SMEs, and other groups have sprung up. As of 2014, one liter of processed Oku white honey commanded a price of FCFA 4,000, whereas before the PGI one liter sold for only FCFA 1,500.

==Religion==

The religion of the region is predominantly a mixture of assorted local traditional beliefs (chiefly ancestor worship, also animism and paganism) with diluted forms of Christianity (mostly Baptist and Catholic, but also Lutheran and Charismatic; the Church of the Brethren are also represented).

As of 2004, the former Fon (i.e., the traditional king of the people, but with no formal political power), who has a Baptist background, was attempting some religious reforms, to move the people away from some of the more un-Christian traditional practices; these reforms have met with considerable resistance given that the present fon (Fon Sentieh II) .

The shrines in Oku are Lumetu, Yicham, Wuchia. Lumetu is famous because it houses the second grave of the legendary Mnkong Moteh. An example of Oku palaces is the Mbokenkfey palace (NtokeMbokenkfey).

<doc id="1028797" wikidata="Q2437734" url="?curid=1028797" title="Steve Trevor">
<text>General Steven Rockwell Trevor is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics, commonly in association with the superhero Wonder Woman. The character was created by William Moulton Marston and first appeared in &quot;All Star Comics&quot; #8 (October 21, 1941). Steve Trevor is a trusted friend, love interest, and partner of Wonder Woman who introduced her to &quot;Man&#x27;s World&quot;, and has served as her United Nations liaison. He is the first foreigner to have ever set foot on Themyscira and the first ambassador to open diplomatic relations with the Amazons.

The character has appeared in various adaptations of the comics. He has been voiced by actors such as Tahmoh Penikett, Nathan Fillion, and George Newbern, among others in various &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; and &quot;Justice League&quot; productions. Lyle Waggoner portrayed the character in the 1970s &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; series, while Chris Pine portrayed him in the DC Extended Universe films &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; (2017) and &quot;Wonder Woman 1984&quot; (2020).

==Publication history==
Steve Trevor first appeared in &quot;All Star Comics&quot; #8 (December 1941).

===Pre-Crisis===
Steve Trevor was originally introduced as an intelligence operative and officer in the United States Army Air Corps who became stranded on Wonder Woman&#x27;s homeland where he was a herald to the Amazons that World War II was occurring in &quot;Man&#x27;s World&quot;. He also developed a close relationship with the heroine. Though a military man with experience in the field, storylines involving post-Marston Steve and Wonder Woman also involved Wonder Woman coming to Steve&#x27;s rescue, as well as vice versa.

The character was killed off in &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; #180 (January - February 1969), shot by the henchmen of Doctor Cyber. In a &quot;WW&quot; letter column in issue #195, artist Mike Sekowsky explained, &quot;Steve Trevor was dull and boring and I didn&#x27;t like him much, so I disposed of him.&quot; The character was later resurrected by another creative team.

Steve&#x27;s visibility in comics varied through the 1970s to the 1990s, with his character either absent or sidelined in favour of fantasy and action-adventure Wonder Woman stories without romantic interests.

===Post-Crisis===
In more recent portrayals, and particularly since DC&#x27;s 2011 reboot, Steve is portrayed as a senior government agent and super spy whose close connection to Wonder Woman makes him the United States&#x27; liaison to the Justice League. In 2013, in his capacity as a skilled government agent, Steve himself became the member of a new incarnation of the Justice League of America.

==Characterization==
===Personality===
The character was designed to be a complement to Wonder Woman&#x27;s character. Chris Pine described Trevor as a &quot;rogue-ish, cynical realist who&#x27;s seen the awful brutish nature of modern civilization&quot; and added he is a &quot;worldly guy, a charming guy&quot;. Steve Trevor gave Diana the nickname, &quot;Angel&quot;, because having been delirious from his injuries, Themyscira seemed heaven-like with her being the &quot;angel&quot; that saved him. Throughout his comic book appearances Steve is often shown to have a strong moral compass and has been depicted as jaded and even insubordinate towards his superior officers if he deems their decisions to be unethical.
Steve Trevor is the first foreigner to have ever set foot on Themyscira, the first man Diana has ever seen, and the first ambassador to open diplomatic relations with the Amazons. Trevor, Superman and Batman are the only men in the &quot;DC Universe&quot; to be granted honorary citizenship by Queen Hippolyta; an extraordinary feat, given that &quot;Aphrodite&#x27;s Law&quot; demands the death penalty for any man who sets foot on Themyscira. He was often Diana&#x27;s primary love interest and their relationship was usually a flirtatious one, yet they always remained steadfast friends. On occasion, Marston would place Trevor in &quot;gentleman-in-jeopardy&quot; situations as an appropriate male version of the damsel in distress trope. His marriage proposals were often rejected, as Diana prioritized saving the world first before marriage, in accordance with &quot;Aphrodite&#x27;s Law&quot;. In more recent years Steve and Diana&#x27;s relationships in the comics have become more platonic, or at times either of their love is unrequited.

==Fictional character biography==
===20th century===
====Golden Age====
In the original version of Wonder Woman&#x27;s origin story, Steve Trevor was an intelligence officer in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II whose plane crashed on Paradise Island, the isolated homeland of the Amazons. He was nursed back to health by the Amazon princess Diana, who fell in love with him and accompanied him when he returned to the outside world. There she became Wonder Woman (and also his coworker, Diana Prince).

Steve Trevor was portrayed as a blonde military hero who often fought battles both alone and alongside Wonder Woman. At the same time, he was also a traditional superhero&#x27;s love interest and gentleman-in-jeopardy: getting kidnapped and being rescued from peril by Wonder Woman, as well as pining after the superheroine in the red-and-blue outfit while failing to notice her resemblance to his meek, bespectacled secretary Diana Prince. Although, at times, Steve has rescued Wonder Woman.
The character was purposely made blond, which stemmed from William Moulton Marston’s belief that the best romantic combination is a blue-eyed brunette girl to a light-haired man, because blond males are more submissive to brunette females, according to him.

====Silver and Bronze Age====
After Marston&#x27;s death, much of the original supporting cast paid less attention to him. Under writer-editor Robert Kanigher, both his and Diana&#x27;s personalities were compromised considerably, with Steve beginning to seem threatened by his heroine&#x27;s power, and Diana almost beginning to seem apologetic about it.

During the &#x27;50s and &#x27;60s, comic writers regularly made Wonder Woman lovesick over Steve Trevor, here a Major in the United States Army. Stories frequently featured Wonder Woman hoping or imagining what it would be like to marry Steve Trevor. As with Superman stories of the same period, the question of marriage was never far from the couple&#x27;s minds. There was also considerable attention given to the threat of the Amazon&#x27;s secret identity being revealed.

Wonder Woman often found herself agreeing to Steve&#x27;s contests for her hand in marriage, which he typically cheated at using government tracking equipment. Afraid that she loved someone else; Steve once again misused government spying equipment to stalk Wonder Woman, finding her with her childhood boyfriend Mer-Man; whom he felt the need to prove himself better than.

In 1968, Diana chose to give up her powers and cut ties with her native Paradise Island to stay close to Steve. Trevor was killed off in the next issue. He was thus absent for the next few years of the comic. In the mid-1970s, following the return of the heroine&#x27;s powers, Trevor was brought back to life by Aphrodite, and given a new identity as the brunette Steve Howard. In 1978, he was killed off again. He would be replaced in 1980 by a double from another, undisclosed dimension of the Multiverse. For the next few years the classic relationship of Wonder Woman and Steve Trevor would be essentially restored, and explored with some detail. In 1985 with issue #322, writer Dan Mishkin dealt with Trevor&#x27;s three separate &quot;lives&quot;, and after much explanation merged the &quot;new&quot; Steve with the old.

During this same period in early 1980s issues of &quot;Wonder Woman&quot;, the villainous Doctor Psycho fused Steve&#x27;s image with Wonder Woman&#x27;s abilities and became &quot;Captain Wonder&quot;, sporting a costume similar to Wonder Woman&#x27;s. In the final issue of the original &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; series, Steve and Diana get married.

====Modern Age====
Following the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; continuity reboot, Steve Trevor is the Deputy Secretary of Defense and married to Etta Candy. His mother Diana previously crash-landed on Themyscira and sacrificed herself to rescue the Amazons from a monster, with Hippolyta naming Diana after her.

===21st century===
====Infinite Crisis====
Following &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, Wonder Woman&#x27;s origin and supporting cast are revamped. Diana is no longer a recent arrival to man&#x27;s world, but instead has lived in it for some time, having been involved in the creation of the Justice League of America. Although Steve Trevor still remains close friends with Diana and married to Etta, his history with Diana is not fully developed.

====The New 52====
In &quot;The New 52&quot; continuity reboot, Steve Trevor is a long-time advocate for the Amazons, having lobbied the U.S. government for peace with the Amazons, arguing that they are benevolent. Steve then becomes Wonder Woman&#x27;s U.N. liaison during her stay in Washington, D.C., and later becomes the head of A.R.G.U.S. (Advanced Research Group for Uniting Super-Humans) and the UN&#x27;s liaison to the Justice League. Promoted to the rank of Colonel, his assistant is Etta Candy and he has made his feelings for Wonder Woman clear to her, although his feelings were not reciprocated. The hero Black Orchid is revealed to be A.R.G.U.S. Agent Alba Garcia, working covertly for Justice League Dark to monitor John Constantine.

Trevor is also a member of several team books, including &quot;Team 7&quot;, which launched in September 2012, and &quot;Justice League of America&quot;, launched in 2013.

The pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; version of Trevor appears in &quot;Convergence&quot;, where he is transformed into a vampire by vampires from Earth-43.

====DC Rebirth====
In the &quot;DC Rebirth&quot; relaunch, Wonder Woman&#x27;s origin is retold in the &quot;Year One&quot; storyline. Steve crashes on Themyscira and is the sole survivor. He is saved and nursed back to health by the Amazons, and a competition is held to determine the one to take Steve and the bodies of his fallen comrades back to America, one that Diana wins. In the United States, Trevor relates to the authorities his experiences with the Amazons and Diana, and the two become allies in subsequent conflicts with terrorists, the Greek god of war Ares, a global virus, an African cult, a paramilitary group called Poison, and the supervillain group Godwatch.

In &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; (vol. 6), Trevor is killed by Sovereign.

<text>Mount Peechee is the third highest peak of the Fairholme Range in Banff National Park. Mt. Peechee is located immediately southeast of Mount Girouard in the Bow River valley south of Lake Minnewanka.

The mountain was named in 1884 by George Dawson after Indigenous guide Alexis Piché, who escorted George Simpson through the front ranges of the Canadian Rockies.
==Geology==
Like other mountains in Banff National Park, Mount Peechee is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny.

==Climate==
Based on the Köppen climate classification, Mount Peechee is located in a subarctic climate zone with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below −20 °C with wind chill factors below −30 °C. Precipitation runoff from Mount Peechee drains into tributaries of the Bow River, which is a tributary of the Saskatchewan River.

<text>Abdominal muscles cover the anterior and lateral abdominal region and meet at the anterior midline. These muscles of the anterolateral abdominal wall can be divided into four groups: the external obliques, the internal obliques, the transversus abdominis, and the rectus abdominis.

==Anterior abdominal wall==

There are three flat skeletal muscles in the antero-lateral wall of the abdomen. The external oblique, closest to the surface, extend inferiorly and medially, in the direction of sliding one’s four fingers into pants pockets. Perpendicular to it is the intermediate internal oblique, extending superiorly and medially, the direction the thumbs usually go when the other fingers are in the pants pocket. The deep muscle, the transversus abdominis, is arranged transversely around the abdomen, similar to the front of a belt on a pair of pants. This arrangement of three bands of muscles in different orientations allows various movements and rotations of the trunk. The three layers of muscle also help to protect the internal abdominal organs in an area where there is no bone.

==Linea alba==
The linea alba is a white, fibrous band that is made of the bilateral rectus sheaths that join at the anterior midline of the body. These enclose the rectus abdominis muscles (a pair of long, linear muscles, commonly called the “sit-up” muscles) that originate at the pubic crest and pubic symphysis, and extend the length of the body’s trunk. Each muscle is segmented by three transverse bands of collagen fibers called the tendinous intersections. This results in the look of “six-pack abs,” as each segment hypertrophies on individuals at the gym who do many sit-ups.

==Posterior abdominal wall==

The posterior abdominal wall is formed by the lumbar vertebrae, parts of the ilia of the hip bones, psoas major and iliacus muscles, and quadratus lumborum muscle. This part of the core plays a key role in stabilizing the rest of the body and maintaining posture.

<text>The Procurator General of the USSR () was the highest functionary of the Office of the Public Procurator of the USSR, responsible for the whole system of offices of public procurators and supervision of their activities on the territory of the Soviet Union.

==History==
The office of procurator had its historical roots in Imperial Russia, and under Soviet law &quot;public procurators&quot; had wide-ranging responsibilities including, but not limited to, those of public prosecutors found in other legal systems. Offices of Public Procurators were and are still used in other countries adhering to the doctrine of socialist law.

The Office of Public Procurator of the USSR was created in 1936, and its head was called Public Procurator of the USSR until 1946, when it was changed to Procurator General of the USSR. According to the 1936 Soviet Constitution, the Procurator General exercised the highest degree of direct or indirect (through subordinate public procurators) control over the accurate execution of laws by all ministries, departments, their subordinate establishments and enterprises, executive and administrative bodies of local Soviets, cooperative organizations, officials (including judges in court proceedings), and citizens on behalf of the state.

The Procurator General was appointed by the Supreme Soviet of the USSR for a 7-year term and given a class rank of the Active state counselor of justice. His deputies and Procurator General of the Armed Forces were appointed by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR on recommendation from Procurator General. The Procurator General appointed public procurators of the Soviet republics and, on their recommendation, public procurators of autonomous republics, krais, oblasts and autonomous oblasts. He also issued orders and instructions for all of the offices of public procurators, instructed on differentiation of their competence, etc.

The Procurator General had the right to present his issues to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet that needed to be solved in the legislative manner or demanded interpretation of the law.

The Procurator General&#x27;s participation in the plenary sessions of the Supreme Court of the USSR was mandatory. He had the right to obtain on demand any case from any court for checking purposes, voice his protest over a law, verdict, decree, or definition, which had already come into force, of any court and to suspend them until the matter was resolved.

<text>Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Hartman (born December 26, 1949) is a Christian artist, guitarist, writer and songwriter. He is the founder of Christian rock band Petra. Hartman was involved with the band from its foundation in 1972 to its end in 2005. He took a break from touring in 1995, but continued to write most of the band&#x27;s songs, record guitars and produce most of the albums. He officially returned to touring with Petra in 2003 until he decided to retire the band in late 2005. Hartman also toured with Petra in 2023 for the band&#x27;s 50th Anniversary Tour.

==Career==

Bob Hartman grew up in Bryan, Ohio learned to play guitar when he was 13 years old, teaching himself from books and watching other people. He has said that two of his major influences was Joe Walsh, a member of The James Gang and Jimi Hendrix at the time.

Hartman converted to Christianity when he was 20 after having heard about the shootings at Kent State University and asking God if he was real to reveal Himself to Hartman. When he was 21, he joined a Christian band called Rapture with John DeGroff. During this time, he wrote some of the songs of the first Petra album. He also studied at Bowling Green State University, earning a B.A. in Psychology.

When Rapture broke up, DeGroff moved to Fort Wayne, Indiana to attend Christian Training Center (a school based in a church there). Hartman was already jamming with guitarist Greg Hough and they both moved to Indiana to attend the same school. Upon meeting drummer Bill Glover there, they formed Petra. Hartman became the principal (and most of the time, the sole) songwriter of the band, writing the lyrics and music for almost all of their songs.

In 1995, he felt he needed to take a break from touring but remained as the band de facto leader, songwriter, and producer. He also continued to play guitars on all of the albums despite not being featured on the album pictures or promotional material of the subsequent four albums - &quot;No Doubt&quot;, &quot;Petra Praise 2: We Need Jesus&quot;, &quot;God Fixation&quot;, and &quot;Double Take&quot;.

Amidst the struggles in the band during the late 90s, Hartman decided to officially return in 2001 for the release of the band&#x27;s third praise album: &quot;Revival&quot;. In 2005, after much praying, he decided to retire the band after 33 years of ministry.

After Petra&#x27;s retirement, Hartman started working with former Petra singer, John Schlitt, as II Guys from Petra in an album which was released on January 26, 2007 titled &quot;Vertical Expressions&quot;.

In 2010, Hartman and other members of the early lineups of Petra, reunited under the name Classic Petra. They released an album, &quot;Back to the Rock&quot;, with a tour that lasted until 2012.

In 2017, Hartman collaborated with missionary and guitarist Daniel Dossmann in releasing &quot;Guitar Legacy&quot;. Hartman produced, arranged and provided electric guitar to Dossmann&#x27;s acoustic guitar on the album of praise and worship songs.

<text>In Greek mythology, the Auloniads (; αὐλωνιάδες, from the classical Greek αὐλωνιάς &quot;of the glen&quot;, also known as Napaeae) were nymphs of the mountain vales in which herds grazed. Together with Oreads and Limoniads, these nymphs were usually found in the company of Pan, the god of nature, rushing gaily and merrily over hills and valleys, through woods and meadows. A favorite and lovely nymph of the vales was Eurydice, who, being bitten by a snake, and dying in consequence, was mourned by all her sisters, and sung by Orpheus in touching melancholy strains.

The word comes from the &quot;Orphic Hymns&quot; (51.7).

<text>Ian Alistair Mackenzie (July 27, 1890 – September 2, 1949) was a Canadian parliamentarian.

==Life and career==
Born in Assynt, Scotland, Mackenzie entered politics by winning a seat in the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia (BC) in the 1920 BC election. He served as Provincial Secretary of British Columbia from June 5, 1928, to August 20, 1928. In 1930, he was appointed to Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King&#x27;s pre-election Cabinet as Minister of Immigration and Colonization and Superintendent of Indian Affairs. While he won his seat in the 1930 federal election the Liberal Party was defeated across the country. Mackenzie entered Parliament as an Opposition Member of Parliament (MP).

When the Liberals returned to power through the 1935 election, Mackenzie returned to Cabinet as Minister of National Defence, where he had the responsibility for pre-war rearmament. With the outbreak of World War II in 1939, however, Mackenzie was moved to the position of Minister of Pensions and National Health, in part because of his role in a scandal involving the awarding of a contract to manufacture the Bren light machine gun. In 1944, he became Minister of Veterans Affairs.

Mackenzie was an able parliamentarian, and when the increasing pressures of war led Prime Minister King to decide to delegate some of his responsibilities in the House of Commons to the new position of Government House Leader, he chose Mackenzie as the first MP to hold that responsibility.

During the war, Mackenzie pandered to anti-Japanese sentiment in British Columbia by declaring to his constituents at his 1944 nomination meeting &quot;Let our slogan be for British Columbia: &#x27;No Japs from the Rockies to the seas. As British Columbia&#x27;s senior cabinet minister Mackenzie had a key role in the government&#x27;s decision to intern Japanese-Canadians for the duration of the war.

In 1947, Mackenzie was named to the Imperial Privy Council along with several other senior Canadian cabinet ministers, allowing him to use the honorific of &quot;Right Honourable&quot;. In 1948, he was appointed to the Senate of Canada. He served only a year and a half until his death in 1949.
