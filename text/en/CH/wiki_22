<text>Vaidyanath Mishra (11 June 1911 – 5 November 1998), better known by his pen name Nagarjun, was a Hindi and Maithili poet who has also penned a number of novels, short stories, literary biographies and travelogues, and was known as &quot;Janakavi&quot;- the People&#x27;s Poet. 
He is regarded as the most prominent protagonist of modernity in Maithili.

== Personal life and biography==

=== Early life and education ===
Vaidyanath Mishra was born on 11 June 1911 (Jyeshtha Purnima), in the Gram Panchayat Tarauni and Block Benipur in Darbhanga District of Bihar, India to Uma Devi and Gokul Mishra. He spent most of his days in his mother&#x27;s village Satlakha of Madhubani district, Bihar. He later converted to Buddhism and got the name &quot;Nagarjun&quot;. His mother died when he was only four years old, and his father being a vagabond himself, couldn&#x27;t support him so young Vaidyanath thrived on the support of his relatives, and the scholarships he won on the account of him being an exceptional student. Soon he became proficient in Sanskrit, Pali and Prakrit languages, which he first learnt locally and later at Varanasi and Calcutta, where he was also semi-employed, while pursuing his studies. Meanwhile, he married Aparajita Devi and the couple had six children.

=== Career ===
He started his literary career with Maithili poems by the pen-name of Yatri (यात्री) in the early 1930s. By the mid-1930s, he started writing poetry in Hindi. His first permanent job of a full-time teacher, took him to Saharanpur (Uttar Pradesh), though he didn&#x27;t stay there for long as his urge to delve deeper into Buddhist scriptures, took him to the Buddhist monastery at Kelaniya, Sri Lanka, where in 1935, he became a Buddhist monk, entered the monastery and studied the scriptures, just as his mentor, Rahul Sankrityayan had done earlier, and hence took upon the name &quot;Nagarjun&quot;. While at the monastery, he also studied Leninism and Marxism ideologies, before returning to India in 1938 to join &#x27;Summer School of Politics&#x27; organised by noted peasant leader, Sahajanand Saraswati, founder of Kisan Sabha. A wanderer by nature, Nagarjun spent a considerable amount of his time in the 1930s and the 1940s travelling across India.

He also participated in many mass-awakening movements before and after independence. Between 1939 and 1942, He was jailed by the British courts for leading a farmer&#x27;s agitation in Bihar. For a long time after independence he was involved with journalism.

He played an active role in Jayaprakash Narayan&#x27;s movement prior to the Emergency period (1975–1977), and therefore was jailed for eleven months, during the emergency period. He was strongly influenced by Leninist-Marxist ideology. This was one of the reasons that he never found patronage from the mainstream political establishments.

He died in 1998 at the age of 87 in Darbhanga.

== Works and literature ==
The subjects of his poetry are varied. Effects of both his wandering tendencies and activism, is evident in his middle and later works. His famous poems like &quot;Bādal kō Ghiratē Dēkhā hai&quot; (), is a travelogue in its own right. He often wrote on contemporary social and political issues. His famous poem &quot;Mantra Kavita&quot; (मंत्र कविता), is widely considered the most accurate reflection of a whole generation&#x27;s mindset in India. Another such poem is &quot;Āō Rānī Hum Ḍhōēṅgē Pālakī&quot; (), which sarcastically humiliates the then prime minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, for the extravagant welcome thrown by him for Queen Elizabeth.

Besides these accepted subjects of poetry, Nagarjun found poetic beauty in unconventional subjects. One of his most astonishing works is a poem based on a show called &quot;With Sharp Teeth&quot; (). Another such creation is a series of poems on a full-grown jackfruit.

Because of the breadth of his poetry, Nagarjun is considered the only Hindi poet after Tulsidas to have an audience ranging from the rural sections of society to the elite. He effectively freed poetry from the bounds of elitism.

== Languages ==
Maithili was his mother tongue and he authored many poems, essays and novels in Maithili. He was educated in Sanskrit, Pali, and Hindi. Hindi remained the language of the bulk of his literature. The Hindi of his works varies from highly sanskritized to vernacular forms. He was a poet of the masses, and preferred to write in the language of immediate local impact. Therefore, he never adhered to specific bounds of languages.

He also had good grasp of the Bengali language and used to write for Bengali newspapers. He was close to the Bengali Hungry generation or &quot;Bhookhi Peerhi&quot; poets and helped Kanchan Kumari in translating Malay Roy Choudhury&#x27;s long poem &quot;Jakham&quot; and &quot;Chana Jor Garam&quot; in Hindi.

== Awards ==
Nagarjun was given the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1968 for his historic book &quot;Patarheen Nagna Gachh&quot;, and the &#x27;Bharat Bharati Award&#x27; by the Uttar Pradesh government for his literary contributions in 1983. He was also honoured by the Sahitya Akademi Fellowship, India&#x27;s highest literary award for lifetime achievement, in 1994.

<text>Vishnu Prabhakar (21 June 1912 – 11 April 2009) was a Hindi writer. He had several short stories, novels, plays and travelogues to his credit. Prabhakar&#x27;s works have elements of patriotism, nationalism and messages of social upliftment. He was the First Sahitya Academy Award winner from Haryana. 

He was awarded the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1993, Mahapandit Rahul Sankrityayan Award in 1995 and the Padma Bhushan (the third highest civilian honour of India) by the Government of India in 2004.

==Life and career==
Along with his work he pursued an interest in literature. He also joined a Natak company in Hissar. His literary life started with the publication of his first story &quot;Diwali&quot; in the Hindi Milap in 1931. He wrote Hatya Ke Baad, his first play in 1939. Eventually he began writing as a full-time career. He stayed with the family of his maternal uncle until the age of twenty seven. He married Sushila Prabhakar in 1938 who stayed as an inspiration source for his literature until her death in 1980.

After Indian Independence he worked as a drama director, from September 1955 to March 1957, in Akashvani, All India Radio, New Delhi. He made news when in 2005 he threatened to return his Padma Bhushan award after he allegedly had to face misconduct at Rashtrapati Bhavan.

Vishnu Prabhakar died at the age of 96, on 11 April 2009 after a brief illness in New Delhi. He was suffering from a heart problem and infection of the urinary tract. His wife, Sushila Prabhakar, had died in 1980. Prabhakar is survived by two sons and two daughters. His sons Atul Prabhakar and Amit Prabhakar decided to donate his body to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi as their father&#x27;s last wishes.

===How he became &#x27;Prabhakar&#x27;===
He became &#x27;Vishnu Prabhakar&#x27; from &#x27;Vishnu&#x27;; his name was listed as &#x27;Vishnu Dayal&#x27; in the primary school of Mirapur. In the Arya Samaj school, on being asked the &#x27;Varna&#x27;, he answered – &#x27;Vaishya&#x27;. The teacher put down his name as &#x27;Vishnu Gupta&#x27;. When he joined government service, the officers changed his name to &#x27;Vishnu Dharmadutt&#x27; because there were many &#x27;Guptas&#x27; in the office and it confused the officers. He continued writing by the pen name of &#x27;Vishnu&#x27;. When an editor once asked him, &quot;Why do you use such a short name? Have you passed any examination?&quot; Vishnu answered that he had passed &#x27;Prabhakar&#x27; examination in Hindi. Thus the editor appended &quot;Prabhakar&quot; to his name making it &#x27;Vishnu Prabhakar&#x27;.

<doc id="1015529" wikidata="Q1068582" url="?curid=1015529" title="Phanishwar Nath Renu">
<text>Phanishwar Nath Mandal &#x27;Renu&#x27; (4 March 1921 – 11 April 1977) was one of the most successful and influential writers of modern Hindi literature in the post-Premchand era. He is the author of &quot;Maila Anchal&quot;, which after Premchand&#x27;s &quot;Godaan&quot;, is regarded as the most significant Hindi novel. Phanishwar Nath (Mandal) Renu was born on 4 March 1921 in a small village Aurahi Hingna near Simraha railway station in Bihar. The mandal community of Bihar to which Renu belonged constitutes an under-privileged social group in India. Renu&#x27;s family, however, enjoyed the benefits of land, education, and social prestige. Renu&#x27;s father, Shilanath Mandal, had been active in the Indian National Movement and was an extremely enlightened individual, taking a keen interest in modern ideas, culture and art.

Phanishwar Nath Renu is best known for promoting the voice of the contemporary rural India through the genre of &quot;Aanchalik Upanyas&quot; (&#x27;regional story&#x27;), and is placed amongst the pioneering Hindi writers who brought regional voices into the mainstream Hindi literature. Renu was very close associate of Bengali novelist Satinath Bhaduri. He wrote a memoirs named &quot;Bhaduriji&quot; (Mr. Bhaduri) in Bengali.

His short story &quot;Maare Gaye Gulfam&quot; was adapted into a film &quot;Teesri Kasam&quot; (The Third Vow), by Basu Bhattacharya (produced by the poet-lyricist Shailendra) in 1966 for which he also wrote the dialogues. Later his short story &quot;Panchlight&quot; (Petromax) was made into a TV short film. The 2017 Bollywood Film &quot;Panchlait&quot; is also based on this short story.

<text>Nirmal Verma (3 April 192925 October 2005) was a Hindi writer, novelist, activist and translator. He is credited as being one of the pioneers of the &quot;Nai Kahani&quot; (New Story) literary movement of Hindi literature, wherein his first collection of stories, &quot;Parinde&quot; (Birds) is considered its first signature.

In his career spanning five decades and various forms of literature, writing story, travelogues and essays, he penned five novels, eight short-story collections and nine books of non-fiction, including essays and travelogues.

== Biography ==

Nirmal Verma was born on 3 April 1929 in Shimla, where his father worked as an officer in the Civil and Services Department of the British Indian Government. He was the seventh child among his eight siblings. One of his brothers is one of India&#x27;s greatest artists Ram Kumar. He is survived by his wife, Gagan Gill who is a writer.

He wrote his first story for a students&#x27; magazine in the early 1950s. He completed Masters of Arts in History from St. Stephen&#x27;s College, Delhi University. Thereafter he started teaching in Delhi and writing for various literary magazines.

His activism streak was visible even during his student days; in 1947–48, he regularly attended Mahatma Gandhiji&#x27;s morning prayer meetings in Delhi, even though he was a card holding member of Communist Party of India, which he resigned in 1956, after Soviet invasion of Hungary. The very activism was soon to be reflected in his stories, which added a whole new dimension to the Indian literary scene.

He stayed in Prague for 10 years, where he was invited by Oriental Institute to initiate a program of translation of modern Czech writers like Karel Čapek, Milan Kundera or Bohumil Hrabal to Hindi; he also learnt Czech language, and translated nine world classics to Hindi, before returning home in 1968, as the result of Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia.

During his stay in Prague he travelled widely across Europe, and the result was seven travelogues, including Cheeron Par Chandni (1962), Har Barish Mein (1970) and Dhund Se Uthti Dhun and his first novel, based on his student days in Prague, titled, &quot;Ve Din&quot; (&quot;Those Days&quot;) (1964). On his return from Prague, he was disillusioned by communism and later became highly vocal against Indian Emergency, and an advocate for the Tibetan independence movement. His subsequent writing reflected his concerted relooking of Indian traditions, which he found to be innately modern, compared with external modernity reflected in the western viewpoints and cultural milieu, which were being imposed on Indian ethos, all around, so much so that later his views were confused as pro-Hindutva as well. A critical analysis of Verma&#x27;s work was presented by Ram Prakash Dwivedi

From 1980–83, Verma served as chairman of Nirala creative writing chair in Bharat Bhavan, Bhopal. In 1988–90 he was director of Yashpal Creative Writing Chair in Shimla. A film based on his story, Maya Darpan (1972), directed by Kumar Shahani, won the Filmfare Critics Award for Best Film.

In his popular novel &quot;A Torn Happiness&quot;, August Strindberg looms large over the heads of many characters.

He died on 25 October 2005 in New Delhi.

<doc id="1015550" wikidata="Q389673" url="?curid=1015550" title="Fornjót">
<text>Fornjót (Old Norse: &quot;Fornjótr&quot;) is a jötunn in Norse mythology, and the father of Hlér (&#x27;sea&#x27;), Logi (&#x27;fire&#x27;) and Kári (&#x27;wind&#x27;). It is also the name of a legendary king of &quot;Finland and Kvenland&quot;. The principal study of this figure is by Margaret Clunies Ross.

== Name ==
The etymology of the Old Norse name &quot;Fornjótr&quot; remains unclear. It is often interpreted as &quot;forn-jótr&quot; (&#x27;ancient or primordial jötunn&#x27;), or as &quot;for-njótr&quot; (&#x27;original owner&#x27;, or &#x27;destroyer&#x27;). Alternative meanings such as &quot;Forn-njótr&quot; (&#x27;one-who-enjoys-sacrifices&#x27;) or &quot;Forn-þjótr&quot; (&#x27;ancient screamer&#x27;) have also been proposed.

According to Peter Erasmus Müller (1818), Fornjótr could be interpreted as the &quot;original owner&quot; (&quot;primus occupans vel utens&quot;) of Norway.

An Old English cognate of &quot;Fornjótr&quot; may appear in a plant-name attested in the Cleopatra Glossary (as &quot;forneotes folm&quot;) and in Bald&#x27;s Leechbook as &quot;fornetes folm&quot;. &quot;Folm&quot; means &#x27;hand, palm&#x27;, and, lacking a better explanation, scholars have suggested that &quot;fornetes&quot; is an Old English form of the name &quot;Fornjótr&quot;, such that the plant&#x27;s name meant &#x27;Fornet&#x27;s palm&#x27;. The plant denoted by this name has not been certainly identified, but Peter Bierbaumer argued for a species of marsh-orchid (&quot;Dactylorhiza&quot;), partly on account of the supposed similarity of their tubers to hands.

==Attestations==

=== Eddas ===
Þjóðólfr of Hvinir, a Norwegian skald of the late 9th–early 10th century AD cited in &quot;Ynglinga tal&quot; , apparently uses the kenning &quot;son of Fornjót&quot; as a synonym of &#x27;fire&#x27;, and another skald only known under the name Svein appears to use the kenning &quot;ugly sons of Fornjót&quot; to mean the &#x27;wind&#x27;.How should the wind be periphrased? Thus: call it son of Fornjót, Brother of the Sea and of Fire, Scathe or Ruin or Hound or Wolf of the Wood or of the Sail or of the Rigging.
Thus spake Svein in the &quot;Nordrsetu-drápa&quot;:
First began to flyFornjót&#x27;s sons ill-shapen.
In the &quot;þulur&quot;, Fornjót is also included in a list of jötnar.

In the &quot;Orkneyinga saga&quot; and in &quot;Hversu Noregr byggdisk&quot; (How Norway Was Settled), Fornjót is portrayed as a king ruling over Gotland and Jutland, &quot;which is called Finnland (the land of the Sámi) and Kvenland [the Finnish-settled part of northern Norway]&quot;. Some editors alter &quot;Gotland&quot; or &quot;Jutland&quot; to &quot;that land&quot;. In those two sources, Fornjót has three sons: Logi (&#x27;fire&#x27;), Kári (&#x27;wind&#x27;), and Hlér (&#x27;sea&#x27;), &quot;whom we call Ægir&quot; according to &quot;Fundinn Noregr&quot;.

==Descendants==
Fornjótr appears as an ancestor-figure of the kings of Norway in several sources. Here follows two family trees of Fornjótr&#x27;s descendants. The first is the genealogy as depicted in &quot;Hversu Noregr byggðist&quot;. The second is one possible rendering of a mythic Yngling family tree based on &quot;Historia Norwegiæ&quot;, &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot;, &quot;Beowulf&quot; and other Old Norse sources, some of which name Fornjótr; the names of Swedish kings in this second family tree are shown in bold.
Kings are in bold.

<text>The United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, or MONUSCO (an acronym based on its French name ), is a United Nations peacekeeping force in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. A planned withdrawal from the country is currently on indefinite hold due to the unstable security situation.

MONUSCO was established by the United Nations Security Council in resolutions 1279 (1999) and 1291 (2000) to monitor the peace process of the Second Congo War, though much of its focus subsequently turned to the Ituri conflict, the Kivu conflict and the Dongo conflict. The mission was known as the United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo or MONUC, an acronym of its French name &quot;Mission de l&#x27;Organisation des Nations Unies en République démocratique du Congo&quot;, until 2010.

The following nations (in alphabetical order) have contributed with military personnel: Bangladesh, Belgium, Benin, Bolivia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Canada, China, Czech Republic, Egypt, France, Ghana, Guatemala, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Ivory Coast, Jordan, Kenya, Malawi, Malaysia, Mali, Mongolia, Morocco, Nepal, the Netherlands, Niger, Nigeria, Pakistan, Paraguay, Peru, Poland, Romania, Russia, Senegal, Serbia, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Switzerland, Tanzania, Tunisia, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, the United States, Uruguay, Yemen and Zambia.

In addition, the following nations have contributed with police personnel: Bangladesh, Benin, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Canada, Chad, Djibouti, Egypt, France, Ghana, Guinea, Jordan, Madagascar, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Romania, Russia, Senegal, Sweden, Switzerland, Togo, Tunisia, Turkey, Ukraine and Yemen.

The initial UN presence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, before the passing of United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1291, was a force of military observers to observe and report on the compliance on factions with the peace accords, a deployment authorised by the earlier UNSCR 1258 (1999). UNSCR 2556 (2020) provides the authority for the current MONUSCO mandate.

About US$8.74 billion was spent to fund the MONUC peacekeeping effort during 1999 to 2010. , the total strength of UN peacekeeping troops in DRC is approximately 18,300. More than thirty nations have contributed military and police personnel for peacekeeping effort, with India being the single largest contributor.

==History==
===1990s===
The origin of this second United Nations military presence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is found in the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement on 17 July 1999 and the following United Nations Security Council Resolution 1258 of 6 August 1999, authorizing the deployment of a maximum of 90 officers.

The first liaison officers arrived in the DRC on 3 September 1999. In November 1999 the number of liaison officers totaled 55, distributed in the capitals of the warring countries (Rwanda, Uganda, Burundi, Zambia, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Ethiopia) including 24 who were stationed in Kinshasa. In January 2000 they reached the number of 79 and they were spread over the whole territory of DRC. Their mission was to liaise with all the warring factions, give a technical assistance and prepare the deployment of military observers.

===2000s===

====2000====
On 24 February 2000 with the resolution 1291, the UN Security Council authorized the deployment of a maximum of 5537 military personnel in the DRC, including 500 military observers. On 4 April 2000 the Senegalese Major General Mountaga Diallo was appointed as the commander of MONUSCO&#x27;s military force. The mandate was to monitor the implementation of the Ceasefire Agreement and the redeployment of belligerent forces, to develop an action plan for the overall implementation of the Ceasefire Agreement, to work with the parties to obtain the release of all prisoners of war, military captives and the return of the remains, to facilitate humanitarian assistance and to assist the Facilitator of the National Dialogue.

Acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, the UN Security Council authorized MONUC to take the necessary action, in the areas of deployment of its infantry battalions, to protect UN personnel, facilities, installations and equipment, ensure the security and freedom of movement of its personnel, and to protect civilians under imminent threat of physical violence.

In December 2000 there were 224 military personnel deployed, including 148 observers in thirteen points around the country. The observers could only record the non-application of the Ceasefire, the violent fighting at Kisangani and in the Équateur and Katanga provinces as well as the presence of foreign troops in the DRC. The deployment of UN troops was impossible due to the security situation and the reluctance of the Congolese government.

====2001====
Even though the beginning of 2001 was still hampered by sporadic combat, the military observers could fulfill their mission in regards with the disengagement of forces and the withdrawal of some of the Rwandan and Ugandan forces.

In March 2001, the first Uruguayan guard unit arrived in Kalemie. The force was deployed in four sectors at Kananga, Kisangani, Kalemie and Mbandaka. In July 2001, the force strength was of 2,366 soldiers, including 363 military observers distributed across 22 cities, and 28 teams monitoring the disengagement of forces. The contingent soldiers totaled 1,869. They came from South Africa, Uruguay, Morocco, Senegal and Tunisia. Guard units protected MONUC installations in Kinshasa, Kananga, Kisangani, Kalemie, Goma, and Mbandaka. A Uruguayan riverine unit and a South African air medical evacuation team were also deployed. The deployed troops were only to protect the sites against looting and theft, the force had neither the mandate nor the strength to protect the civilian population, or even to extract MONUC personnel. Following UNSCR 1355, the military observers, within their capacities, could also contribute to the voluntary disarmament, demobilization, repatriation and reintegration process of the armed groups.

With Security Council Resolution 1376, the Security Council launched the third phase of the deployment of MONUC troops, in the eastern DRC. The site for the logistical base was planned to be Kindu, Maniema Province.

====2002====
In 2002, the 450 military observers, split in 95 teams, continued to monitor the Ceasefire along the ex-frontlines. The teams also investigated violations of the Ceasefire. Foreign troops continued to leave the country. The riverine units escorted the first ships on the Congo River, which was again open to commercial traffic. In June 2002 the UN troops&#x27; total number was 3,804. Contingents from Ghana and Bolivia joined the force, of which more than a third of the soldiers were Uruguayan. More than one thousand soldiers were deployed in Kisangani. On 14 May 2002, a military observer died near Ikela following the explosion of a mine under his vehicle.

On 30 July 2002, the different parties signed the Pretoria agreement and the nature of the mission of the peacekeepers changed. The military observers monitored the withdrawal of 20,000 Rwandan soldiers, but they also noted the rise of ethnic violence in Ituri Province. At the end of 2002 there were a total of 4,200 UN soldiers in the DRC. Through UNSCR 1445, the Security Council authorized the increase of military personnel to 8,500. The principle of two independent intervention forces – civilian and military – was also approved. MONUC was tasked to support the voluntary disarmament, demobilization, repatriation, reintegration and resettlement (DDRRR) process, without the use of force.

====2003====
Numerous DDRRR operations in collaboration with the civilian component were conducted in the beginning of 2003. Before the start of the transition, UN soldiers were deployed along the front lines. A vast redeployment to the East started. The four coordination centres and 22 bases in the western part of the country were shut down. Over one hundred observers were redeployed and Uruguayan contingents arrived in Bukavu, South Kivu and Lubero, North Kivu. Observer teams monitored serious combat and human rights violations in Ituri. In April 2003, 800 Uruguayan soldiers were deployed in Bunia, Ituri Province under Resolution 1484. In the same month an observer died in a mine explosion. In May 2003 two military observers were savagely killed by a militia.

The withdrawal of 7,000 Ugandan troops in April 2003 led to a deteriorating security situation in the Ituri Province, endangering the peace process. The UN Secretary General Kofi Annan called for establishing and deploying a temporary multi-national force to the area until the weakened MONUC mission could be reinforced. In his second special report to the Security Council, the UN Secretary General proposed a reorientation of MONUC missions: to provide support to the transition and to maintain security in key areas of the country. Accordingly, he proposed the creation of a brigade in Ituri to support the peace process.
On 30 May 2003, UNSCR 1493 authorized the deployment of the Interim Emergency Multinational Force (IEMF) in Bunia with a task to secure the airport and protect both internally displaced persons in camps and the civilians in the town. UNSCR 1493 authorized an increase of military personnel to 10,800, imposed an arms embargo, and authorized MONUC to use all necessary means to fulfill its mandate in the Ituri District and also in North and South Kivu, as it deemed the additional provinces to be within MONUC&#x27;s capabilities,

The French Government had already shown interest in leading the operation. It soon broadened to a European Union (EU) -led mission with France as the framework nation providing the bulk of the personnel and complemented by contributions from both EU and non-EU nations. The total force consisted of about 1,800 personnel and was supported by French aircraft based at airfields in N&#x27;Djamena, Chad and Entebbe, Uganda. A small 80-man Swedish Special Forces (SSG) group was also added.

The operation called Operation Artemis was launched on 12 June and the IMEF completed its deployment in the following three weeks. The force was successful in stabilising the situation in Bunia and enforcing the UN presence in the DRC. In September 2003, responsibility for the security of the region was handed over to the MONUC mission.

Growing military conflict in DRC caused the United Nations to seek additional military help from major powers. In July 2003, India announced that it would be sending an additional 300 personnel and combat aircraft from the Indian Air Force to strengthen the UN peacekeeping effort in DRC.

In September 2003, the Ituri brigade was in place, including soldiers from Uruguay, Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan, Indonesia, India and Morocco.

In November 2003, a total of 10,415 peacekeepers were in the DRC, comprising infantry units, engineer units, helicopter units, logistic units, medical units and riverine units.

====2004====
Deploying the Ituri brigade and conducting cordon and search operations improved the security conditions in Ituri but, at the same time, the peacekeepers became the target of the militias. On 12 February 2004, a military observer was killed in Ituri.

With the arrival of the Transitional Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which included members of rebel movements, more than 900 Tunisian and Ghanaian UN troops contributed to the security of Kinshasa.

It was decided that the troops present in the Kivus will be assembled under the unified command of a brigade. In March the Nigerian General Samaila Iliya took over the command of the force.

In June 2004, Bukavu, South Kivu was occupied by rebel general Laurent Nkunda. A military observer was killed. The 1,000 MONUC troops could only protect their own installations. Demonstrations were held all over the country and UN troops opened fire on looters in Kinshasa. MONUC soldiers were again targeted by Ituri militia at the end of 2004.

Though the Secretary General had asked for an increase of 13,100 soldiers, in October 2004 the Security Council by Resolution 1565, authorized a reinforcement of 5,900 military personnel and defined the mandate with the strategic military objectives of the MONUC force as:
* proactively contributing to the pacification and general improvement of security in the country;
* providing support for conflict resolution in politically volatile areas;
* improving border security through regional confidence-building mechanisms, such as the Joint Verification Mechanism, and effective patrolling and monitoring of the arms embargo;
* gathering and analysing military and other information on spoilers.

Following the UN resolution, the Indian Army announced that it would be sending an additional 850 troops and four combat helicopters to aid the MONUC peacekeeping effort.

====2005====
By 2005, the strength of UN peacekeeping forces in Congo reached more than 16,000 troops, split almost equally between the Western Brigade and the Eastern Division.

In February 2005, nine Bangladeshi UN troops were killed during an ambush in Ituri. The actions of the Ituri and Kivu Brigades became more robust and the pressure rose on all armed groups. Thomas Lubanga Dyilo, the leader of the Union of Congolese Patriots, and other militia leaders were arrested by Congolese authorities and imprisoned in Makala, Kinshasa. Lubanga was accused of having ordered the killing of the peacekeepers in February 2005 and of orchestrating continuous insecurity in the area. On 10 February 2006, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued an arrest warrant for Lubanga for the war crime of &quot;conscripting and enlisting children under the age of fifteen years and using them to participate actively in hostilities.&quot; The Congolese national authorities transferred Lubanga to ICC custody on 17 March 2006.

On 1 March 2005, a vast cordon and search operation in Ituri was conducted by Nepalese, Pakistani and South African Infantry elements with the support of Indian attack helicopters, between 50 and 60 militiamen were killed.

Senegalese General Babacar Gaye was appointed force commander in March 2005 after Spanish General Vincente Diaz de Villegas resigned for personal reasons.

In May 2005, the UN Secretary General asked for a supplementary brigade for Katanga. Joint operations were conducted by the newly arrived integrated brigades of the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (FARDC). UN troops were tasked with the support of the electoral process, contributing protection and transport. In Ituri over 15000 militiamen were disarmed.

In October 2005, by Resolution 1635, the UN Security Council authorized a temporary increase of 300 military personnel to permit a deployment to Katanga.

====2006====

In late January, a group of 80 Guatemalan Special Forces from the Kaibiles were engaged in a four hour firefight with LRA rebels, ending with the deaths of eight Guatemalans and fifteen rebels. They are believed to have been conducting a raid on an LRA encampment to capture LRA Deputy Commander Vincent Otti. The incident caused a significant uproar from both the Government of Guatemala and the Guatemalan public, who demanded an official inquiry into the engagement.

On 25 April 2006, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1671, authorising the temporary deployment of a European Union force to support MONUC during the period encompassing the general elections in the DR Congo, which began on 30 July 2006.

The European Council approved the launching of the EU military operation, EUFOR RD Congo, and appointed Lieutenant General Karlheinz Viereck (Germany) Operation Commander and Major General Christian Damay (France) EU Force Commander. The Operational Headquarters was the German-nominated Armed Forces Operational Command – Einsatzführungskommando – at Potsdam, Germany. The mission was tasked with:
* supporting and providing security to MONUC installations and personnel;
* contributing to airport protection in Kinshasa;
* contributing to the protection of civilians under imminent threat of physical violence;
* evacuation operations in case of emergency.

This mission came to an end on 30 November 2006.

====2007====
In May 2007, India announced that it would be sending an additional 70 Indian Air Force personnel to join the MONOU effort.

====2008====

In August 2008, an internal investigation led by the Indian Army and other MONOU officers revealed that about ten Indian peacekeepers may have been involved in abuse and exploitation in Congo. Earlier in May 2008, the vice chief of the Indian Army visited Congo to look into these allegations and by August 2008, the Indian Army had launched an official probe to look into these allegations.

On 26 October 2008 Rally for Congolese Democracy (RCD) forces of Laurent Nkunda seized a major military camp, along with Virunga National Park for use as a base to launch attacks. This occurred after a peace treaty failed, with the resultant fighting displacing thousands. The park was taken due to its strategic location on a main road leading to the city of Goma.

On 27 October 2008 riots began around the United Nations compound in Goma, and civilians pelted the building with rocks and threw Molotov cocktails, claiming that the UN forces had done nothing to prevent the RCD advance. The Congolese national army also retreated under pressure from the rebel army in a &quot;major retreat&quot;.

Meanwhile, United Nations gunships and armoured vehicles were used in an effort to halt the advance of the rebels, who claimed to be within of Goma. Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General for DRC Alan Doss explained the necessity of engaging the rebels, stating that &quot;[the UN] can&#x27;t allow population centres to be threatened ... [the UN] had to engage.&quot;

Indian Army personnel were asked to deploy themselves from Goma to adjoining North Kivu province, after the Uruguayan battalion deployed in the region fled. However, after that several Uruguayan battalions were playing a crucial role in the buffer zone between the retreating government soldiers and the advancing rebels.

On 29 October 2008, a French request for an EU reinforcement of 1,500 troops was refused by several countries and appeared unlikely to materialize; however, the UN forces stated they would act to prevent takeovers of population centres.

In November 2008, India announced that it would be sending the 3rd battalion of the 3rd Gorkha Rifles regiment to replace a Sikh Light Infantry battalion and join the peace-keeping effort in the Congo. India made the decision to send its elite forces amidst rising concerns that Indian peace-keepers were getting caught in the cross-fire between DRC government troops and rebels.

On 4 November 2008, a 200-fighter strong Mai Mai militia force launched a surprise attack on CNDP troops in Kiwanja, a CNDP-controlled town near Rutshuru, North Kivu. The Mai Mai were initially able to retake the town but a speedy counter-attack returned control to the CNDP less than 24-hours later. After the town was retaken, CNDP forces under the command of Bosco Ntaganda combed through Kiwanja, searching out boys and men – who they accused of collaborating with the Mai Mai – and executing them on the spot. Older members of the community, both men and women, were also murdered and a large number of women were raped and assaulted. By the end of 5 November, over 150 civilians had been killed in Kiwanja in what has since been dubbed the Kiwanja Massacre.

A UN base was situated less than from Kiwanja and over 100 Indian peacekeepers were present at the time of the attacks but the forces lacked basic intelligence capabilities – no one in the base spoke the necessary languages, as their interpreter had been reassigned without replacement a week prior – and the peacekeepers later said they had no idea the massacre was taking place until it was over. Lt. Col. H. S. Brar, commander of the Indian peacekeepers at Kiwanja summarized the failure as the result of &quot;poor communication and staffing, inadequate equipment, intelligence breakdowns and spectacularly bad luck.&quot; In its report on the massacre, Human Rights Watch largely supported Brar&#x27;s assessment but further observed that competing priorities from headquarters in Goma shifted focus to &quot;assuring the security of humanitarian workers, a foreign journalist, and a group of military observers, rather than protecting the civilian population.&quot;

In the immediate aftermath of the Kiwanja Massacre, the recently-appointed civilian and military heads of the UN peacekeeping force in North Kivu, Hiroute Guebre Sellassie and Gen. Bipin Rawat, brought their commands together for evaluation. As a result, the MONUC civilian and military teams in North Kivu &quot;implemented a number of reforms that drastically improved the performance of peacekeepers and were hailed as a model for other peacekeeping missions.&quot; Reforms included the creation of joint protection teams comprising military and police personnel and civil affairs, human rights, and child protection staff operating from the UN&#x27;s forward bases; a mobile-phone based early warning system, in which community members were provided with devices to alert peacekeepers of unrest; community alert networks that allowed for bases to be contacted around the clock; Community Liaison Assistants (CLAs), an expanded role for Congolese translators to also act as community monitors and information gatherers; an emphasis on civilian outreach; increased foot patrols; and deployment of 30–35 troop standing combat units to areas deemed vulnerable.

On 18 November, a draft resolution spearheaded by the French Foreign Ministry was presented before the United Nations Security Council. The resolution, signed by 44 different organizations and with the backing of the British Foreign Office minister Mark Malloch Brown, asked the UN to send 3,000 more peacekeepers to reinforce the 17,000-strong garrison in the Congo, the largest garrison of its kind. This echoed calls from Human Rights Watch and other humanitarian aid groups in the region, who were also asking for reinforcements to bring stability to the area. In a shared statement, the coalition of organizations stated that &quot;[The reinforcements] would help to prevent the atrocities that continue to be committed against civilians on an ever greater scale here in North Kivu [province], on the border of Rwanda and Uganda ... Since August 28, fighting has intensified in many areas, causing deaths, rapes, lootings, forced recruitment and further displacements of civilian populations. The population has thus been immersed in unspeakable suffering. In the last few days, fighting has drawn closer to large populated areas, such as the town of Goma. Fighting has also invaded and torn apart the region of Rutshuru, particularly in the town of Kiwanja, where hundreds of civilian deaths have now been recorded.&quot; Local groups in the Congo also requested help from the European Union, as they would be able to deploy soldiers sooner, working as a &quot;bridging force&quot; until the UN reinforcements arrived. British EU spokeswoman Catriona Little stated that they were &quot;not ruling in or out EU forces&quot;.

On 20 November, the UN voted unanimously to send 3,085 more peacekeepers, citing &quot;extreme concern at the deteriorating humanitarian situation and in particular the targeted attacks against civilian population, sexual violence, recruitment of child soldiers and summary executions.&quot; However, it did not extend MONUC&#x27;s mandate in the Congo, which was set to expire at the end of 2008. The decision was made despite the rebel commitment to pulling back from the front lines and allowing aid to reach the thousands of people still isolated, according to aid groups.

However, a week after the UN vote, the DRC government requested the UN to not deploy any more Indian troops in the east of the country, arguing that there was a need to &quot;redress the balance&quot; of the make-up of the 17,000-strong UN force in the country.

====2009====
On 17 February, Egypt announced that it would send around 1,325 soldiers from the Egyptian Army to support the UN mission in Congo. Egypt also announced that it will send a police force to help in protecting the UN mission in Congo. The Egyptian armed force will work to give support and technical advice to the Congo Army beside operating armed mission in the conflict zones and medical assistant and support. According to the Foreign affairs in Cairo, Egypt will send a Mechanized Unit, Special Forces, Field Engineers, and Paratroops. Egypt already has a small unit in Congo consisting of 13 policemen and 23 observers.

In March 2009, the Indian Army questioned more than 100 Indian troops deployed in DRC regarding the abuse allegations against them. After a thorough investigation, which included examination of statements by alleged victims, the Indian Army found &quot;serious irregularities&quot; in charges raised by the United Nations Office of Internal Oversight Services. Consequently, all of the accused personnel were let off due to lack of evidence.

In October 2009, India announced a US$263 million aid package to Congo to help the country&#x27;s information technology, hydroelectricity and railway sectors. India also renewed its military commitments to MONUC while Congo expressed its support for India&#x27;s UNSC permanent seat candidature. These developments helped thaw relations between the two countries.

In December, MONUC rushed peacekeeping troops to Dongo in the Kungu territory of Sud-Ubangi District where a new conflict rapidly escalated in an effort to protect the local population. A MONUC helicopter that was restocking the 20 troops stationed there fell under gunfire from armed men. The helicopter crew, all of Russian nationality, facilitated the evacuation of 25 people, including 5 injured people (including the helicopter pilot), who were brought to Brazzaville for emergency medical treatment.

Sources in Kinshasa reported that in mid-November DRC President Joseph Kabila secretly airlifted a battalion of Rwandan Defense Forces (RDF) across Congo to put down the rebellion in Dongo and the operation was supported by the United Nations Observes Mission in Congo (MONUC) and the United States Africa Command. Along with RDF regulars, MONUC troops have been fighting alongside Tutsi Rwandan soldiers infiltrated by Rwanda, with the Kabila government&#x27;s support, into the national army, the Armed Forces of the DRC (FARDC).

At the weekly MONUC press conference of 16 December 2009, it was announced by MONUC spokesperson Madnodje Mounoubai that the first MONUC peacekeeping troops were deployed in Dongo, where a temporary operational basis is functional, as well as in nearby Bozene. The 500 MONUC troops will come from the Ghanaian, Tunisian and Egyptian contingents as well as troops from the Guatemalan Special Forces. Military equipment such as armored personnel carriers, transport and combat helicopters will also be at their disposal to support their mission.

===2010s===

====2010====
In accordance with Security Council resolution 1925 of 28 May 2010, MONUC was renamed as of 1 July the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO) to reflect the new phase reached in the country. In August 2010, the Mai Mai rebels ambushed a base of the 19th Kumaon Regiment of the Indian Army, killing three Indian peace-keepers. The attack renewed calls in India to decrease the country&#x27;s military presence in Congo due to growing conflict in the region.

====2011====
In May 2011, the international cooperation minister of DRC expressed his government&#x27;s desire of an &quot;orderly, progressive withdrawal&quot; of MONUSCO due to &quot;normalization&quot; of DRC&#x27;s relations with neighboring countries and containment of rebels to a &quot;few isolated zones&quot;.

In June 2011, the UN announced that it would withdraw about 2,000 peace-keepers by the end of the month. The UN announcement came only a few days after India&#x27;s decision to withdraw all of its four Mi-35 combat helicopters from MONUSCO and eventually cease peace-keeping operations in DRC.

====2012====
On 15 November, MONUSCO helicopter gunships were deployed to support government forces as they fought to hold off a 23 March Movement attack south of Kibumba; the combined army and UN assault killed approximately 64 M23 fighters.

On 20 November 2012, 23 March Movement seized the provincial capital of Goma after the national army retreated. MONUSCO troops observed without intervening, as their mandate only allowed them to protect civilians. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius called the situation &quot;absurd&quot;, noting MONUSCO&#x27;s greatly superior numbers, and called for the group&#x27;s mandate to be revised. UN spokesman Eduardo del Buey said peacekeepers &quot;cannot substitute&quot; for the Congo national army, adding that the 1,500 UN troops in Goma held their fire because they did not want to risk civilian lives.

====2013====

In January 2013 chief of MONUSCO Herve Ladsous told the UN Security Council during a closed-door session that the mission plans to deploy three unmanned aerial vehicles in eastern provinces of DRC. US, UK and some other Security Council members were also supportive of the idea. However, Rwanda, which had denied allegations by UN experts that it has been supporting the March 23 Movement, opposed this proposal. Rwandan delegation informed the UN Security Council that Monusco would be a &quot;belligerent&quot; if it deployed drones in eastern DRC. Other diplomats, including Russian, Chinese, and some from Europe, also expressed reservations. They said there were unanswered questions about who would receive the information from the drones and how widely it would be disseminated, expressing discomfort at the idea of the United Nations becoming an active gatherer of intelligence.

In March 2013, the United Nations Security Council authorized the deployment of an intervention brigade within MONUSCO to carry out targeted offensive operations, with or without the Congolese national army, against armed groups that threaten peace in eastern DRC. The brigade is based in Sake, North Kivu, and is made up of a total of 3,069 peacekeepers. It is tasked with neutralizing armed groups, reducing the threat posed to State authority and civilian security and to make space for stabilization activities. The first Brigade was composed of three battalions, one each from South Africa, Tanzania and Malawi with the Brigade being commanded by James Aloizi Mwakibolwa of Tanzania.

On 30 July 2013, the March 23 Movement was given a 48-hour ultimatum by the UN to leave Goma area or face &quot;use of force&quot;. Between 21 and 29 August, heavy fighting outside Goma left 57 rebels, 10–23 government soldiers, 14 civilians and one Tanzanian UN peacekeeper dead. Seven-hundred and twenty government soldiers and ten UN peacekeepers were also wounded.

====2014====
After the 2014 South Kivu attack in June 2014, the UN announced it would send MONUSCO peacekeeping troops to the area to protect the population. &quot;These violent acts are unacceptable and need to stop immediately,&quot; said Kobler.

====2015====
In May 2015, Allied Democratic Forces Ugandan rebels ambushed a MONUSCO convoy about from Beni, killing two Tanzanian soldiers. Four other peacekeepers were reported missing.

In October 2015, Maman Sambo Sidikou succeeded Martin Kobler as head of the MONUSCO.

====2017====
On 8 December 2017, the Semuliki operating base, 27 miles from the town of Beni, was engaged in a protracted attack which resulted in the deaths of 15 UN peacekeepers and 5 Congolese soldiers killed. 53 UN peacekeepers were also wounded. At least 12 of the dead UN peacekeepers were Tanzanians. It is suspected that the attackers were rebels of the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF). This brought the total casualties of UN forces since the mission commenced in Congo to 93.

===2020s===

====2022====
In March, due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Ukraine withdrew its aviation unit of eight helicopters.

Anti-MONUSCO protests emerged in late July amidst accusations by Congolese politicians and civilians of failing to take action to end the Kivu conflict within the country. The protestors demanded that MONUSCO leave the country. On 26 July, fifteen people were killed and 50 others were injured as UN peacekeepers opened fire at a protest in Goma, North Kivu. The same day, three peacekeepers and seven civilians were killed during an attack on a MONUSCO base by protesters in Butembo. On 27 July, four protesters at a MONUSCO base in Uvira were killed by electrocution after soldiers shot an electric cable which fell on them. South Kivu governor Théo Ngwabidje Kasi called for investigations as to whether the cable was shot by Congolese security forces or MONUSCO peacekeepers.

In September, Ukraine withdrew its 250 troops from the mission.

====2023====
In August 2023, protesters clashed with soldiers in a protest in Goma, Democratic Republic of the Congo, against MONUSCO forces for the failure to prevent the violence of militants against civilians. According to reports, the death toll reached 56 on September 5, 2023.

====2024====
The Democratic Republic of the Congo called for MONUSCO to withdraw from the country amidst a rising perception that they were failing to protect civilians. MONUSCO initially agreed to a full withdrawal by the end of the year, with the first phase of the withdrawal beginning in July, involving the closure of their main office in Bukavu, South Kivu. In July, amidst an intensifying offensive by the M23 in North Kivu, the pullout was halted and indefinitely postponed. Foreign Minister Thérèse Kayikwamba Wagner expressed a concern for the creation of a security vacuum, stating &quot;we will take into account the developments that we see on the ground before making responsible decisions and starting this process when the most favourable conditions are met.&quot;
====2025====
In January 2025, M23 seized control of the city of Goma, and at least 13 soldiers from the South African National Defence Force and one from the Uruguayan Army were killed.

==Organization==
The headquarters of the mission are in Kinshasa, DRC. The mission views the DRC as consisting of 6 sectors, each with its own staff headquarters. In 2005-6 the Eastern Division however was formed at Kisangani and took over brigades in North Kivu, South Kivu, and Ituri, along with two or three of the Sector HQs.

The approved budget for MONUC, from 1 July 2007 to 30 June 2008, is US$1.16 billion, the largest for any current UN peacekeeping operation.

===Force commanders===





===Sector headquarters===
* MONUSCO HQ: Kinshasa
* Sector 1: Mbandaka
* Sector 2 and Eastern Division HQ: Kisangani

===Force numbers and fatalities===
In July 2004 there were 10,531 UN soldiers under MONUC&#x27;s command. On 1 October 2004, the UN Security Council decided to deploy 5,900 more soldiers to Congo, although UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan had asked for some 12,000.

On 25 February 2005, nine Bangladeshi peacekeepers were killed by members of the Nationalist and Integrationist Front militia in Ituri province. The FNI killed another Nepali peacekeeper and took seven captive in May 2006. Two of the seven were released in late June and the UN was trying to secure the release of the remaining five. By November 2005, MONUC consisted of 16,561 uniformed troops. On 30 July 2006, MONUC forces were charged with keeping the 2006 general election—the first multiparty election in the DRC since 1960—peaceful and orderly. MONUC troops began patrolling areas of eastern DRC after armed clashes broke on 5 August following the chaotic collection of election results. The UN command is also arranging different training programs and competitions in Congo for both Congo and international forces. A similar shooting competition was held between troops from all international forces and was won by a Pakistani infantry battalion.

As of 31 October 2007, the total strength of the UN force was 18,407 uniformed personnel, including 16,661 troops; 735 military observers; and 1,011 police; supported by 931 international civilian personnel, 2,062 local civilian staff, and 585 United Nations Volunteers. By August 2024, in part through the closure of the UN bases in Southern Sector, the UN presence numbered 14,000 military personnel; 660 military observers; 591 police; and 1,050 personnel of formed police units.

As of August 2024, the UN has recorded a total of 444 fatalities among MONUC and MONUSCO personnel. MONUC fatalities (161 total) included 100 military personnel; 10 military observers; 6 UN police; 12 international civilians; and 33 local civilians. MONUSCO fatalities (283 total) includes 159 military personnel; 3 military observers; 18 UN police; 28 international civilians; and 71 local civilians.

===Staff and forces===
On 31 October 2007 MONUC had a total of 18,407 uniformed personnel, including 16,661 troops, 735 military observers, 1,011 police, who were supported by 931 international civilian personnel, 2,062 local civilian staff and 585 United Nations Volunteers. As of June 2022, major troop contributors, in order of total number of military personnel are Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, South Africa, Nepal, Indonesia, and Morocco (nearly 10,000).

On 20 November 2008, the United Nations Security Council voted unanimously to reinforce MONUC with 3,085 more peacekeepers to deal with trouble in the 2008 Nord-Kivu conflict. They voted after 44 organizations, led by the French Foreign Ministry, petitioned the council to send reinforcements to stabilize the region.

 MONUSCO forces included 19,084 uniformed personnel, out of which 16,998 were military personnel, 743 were military observers and 1,343 were police (including formed units). In addition the forces included 983 international civilian personnel, 2,828 local civilian staff and 600 UN volunteers.

== Criminal activity ==
In 2007 and 2008, in several news and TV reports, the BBC published own evidence about Pakistani MONUC peacekeepers in Mongbwalu had entered in a gold-for-guns trading relationship with Nationalist and Integrationist Front (FNI) militia leaders, eventually drawing Congolese army officers and Indian traders from Kenya into the deal. Following its own investigations, the UN concluded that there was no involvement of Pakistani peacekeeper in any such trade relationship. Namely Human Rights Watch harshly criticized the UN for the way it handled the investigation, providing detailed information from several UN documents, arguing that serious allegations of wrongdoing by Pakistani peacekeepers in the Democratic Republic of Congo were ignored, minimized or shelved by the UN&#x27;s Organization of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS).

MONUC officials say nothing of substance about mining in Congo, which proceeds in parallel with the bloodletting, arms trading and extortion. For example, Anvil Mining has been involved in massacres in DRC. Anvil directors include former U.S. Ambassador Kenneth Brown, who served at U.S. embassies in Brussels, Kinshasa, Congo-Brazzaville and South Africa. Brown was Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Africa (1987–1989) under George Shultz and George H. W. Bush and Director of Central African Affairs (1980–1981). Brown succeeded William Lacy Swing—head of MONUC in DRC—as Ambassador to the Republic of Congo (Brazzaville). Meanwhile, the former top internal intelligence and security chief of the United Nations Observer&#x27;s Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUC) has been worked for Anvil mining in Katanga since 2006.

There have been numerous cases of sexual misconduct by UN peacekeeping forces in the Congo. This has been acknowledged by the UN itself (such as the letter of 24 March 2005 from the Secretary-General to the President of the General Assembly).

<text>Logi (Old Norse: , &#x27;fire, flame&#x27;) or Hálogi (, &#x27;High Flame&#x27;) is a jötunn and the personification of fire in Norse mythology. He is a son of the jötunn Fornjótr and the brother of Ægir or Hlér (&#x27;sea&#x27;) and Kári (&#x27;wind&#x27;). Logi married fire giantess Glöð and she gave birth to their two beautiful daughters—Eisa and Eimyrja.

== Name ==
The Old Norse name &quot;Logi&quot; is generally translated as &#x27;fire&#x27;, &#x27;flame&#x27;, or blaze&#x27;. It was also used in poetry as a synonym of &#x27;sword, blade&#x27;.

Since Logi is pitted against the god Loki in a story in the &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; section of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, it has been suggested that Loki was also associated with fire, but it is more likely to be wordplay. Loki has no connection to the German word &quot;Lohe&quot; (&#x27;blaze&#x27;), despite Richard Wagner&#x27;s use of the name &quot;Loge&quot; for the demigod in his &quot;Ring des Nibelungen&quot;.

== Attestations ==

=== &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; ===
In &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; (&#x27;The Beguiling of Gylfi&#x27;), Logi appears in the tale of Thor and Loki&#x27;s journey to the castle of the giant Útgarða-Loki in Jötunheimr, where Loki was pitted against Logi in an eating contest. The contestants appeared to be equal in speed at eating meat from the bone, but Logi also consumed the bones and even the wooden trencher in which the meat was placed showing off his might. Útgarða-Loki afterwards explained that Logi was really wildfire itself.

=== &quot;Hversu Noregr byggðist&quot; ===
In &quot;Hversu Noregr byggðist&quot; in &quot;Flateyjarbók&quot;, there is a mention of Logi&#x27;s family:

There was a man called Fornjót. He had three sons; one was Hlér, another Logi, the third Kári; he ruled over winds, but Logi over fire, Hlér over the seas.

The sons of Fornjótr are given powers to rule over forces of nature. Logi rules over fire.

=== &quot;Þorsteins saga Víkingssonar&quot; ===

In &quot;Þorsteins saga Víkingssonar&quot;, Logi, also called Hálogi, is identified as a risi (another kind of giant) who becomes the first king of Hálogaland (northern Norway), and the ancestor of its royal line, all of whom are known for their muscular physique and stunning beauty.

== Legacy ==
A moon of planet Saturn is named Loge after Logi.

<text>Eric Benét Jordan (born October 15, 1966) is an American R&amp;B singer-songwriter and musician. He has been nominated for four Grammy Awards.

==Early life and education ==
Benét was born on October 15, 1966, in Mobile, Alabama. He was raised in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the youngest of five siblings. Benét expressed an interest in music at an early age, but was initially encouraged by his father, a police officer who died of cancer, to attend college and pursue a &quot;stable&quot; career. He graduated from Milwaukee Trade and Technical High School and enrolled in college, but later dropped out.

== Career ==
Benét began his career as a member of a group called Gerard in the late 1980s. Later, Benét, his sister Lisa, and his cousin George Nash Jr. formed a band called Benét and released a self-titled album in 1992 which sold over 100,000 copies. In 1994, he signed with Warner Bros. Records, releasing his solo debut album, &quot;True to Myself&quot; in 1996. Individual songs from the album were successful, including the top-ten R&amp;B hits &quot;Spiritual Thang&quot;, &quot;Femininity&quot; and &quot;Let&#x27;s Stay Together&quot;, which originally appeared on the soundtrack of the film &quot;A Thin Line Between Love and Hate&quot;. His second album, &quot;A Day in the Life&quot;, was released in 1999 and featured his smash hit &quot;Spend My Life With You (featuring Tamia)&quot;. The song rose to No. 1 on the US Billboard R&amp;B charts (for 3 weeks), was certified gold, and nominated for a 2000 Grammy Award for &quot;Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group&quot;. The album also won a Soul Train Music Award for &quot;Best R&amp;B/Soul Album, Male&quot;.

In between albums, Benét collaborated with his then-labelmates Somethin&#x27; for the People on their 1997 album &quot;This Time It&#x27;s Personal&quot; singing leads on the single &quot;Act Like You Want It&quot;. In 2001, he recorded a song for Earth, Wind, and Fire&#x27;s 30th anniversary CD, and began work on a new album titled &quot;Better and Better&quot;, which was set to be a departure from his previous work. Benét&#x27;s label, however, refused to release this album, forcing him to stay in the R&amp;B genre. Due to disagreements regarding music style and creative freedom, Benét left Warner Bros. and signed to Reprise-distributed label Friday Records and recorded his next album, &quot;Hurricane,&quot; which became his third studio album following its release on June 21, 2005, in the US. &quot;I Wanna Be Loved&quot; was the song that received the most airplay. The single reached number two on the Urban Adult Contemporary chart.

His fourth album &quot;Love &amp; Life&quot; was released on September 9, 2008. It debuted at number eleven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number two on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, making this his own highest peak position since &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; in 1999. The first single &quot;You&#x27;re the Only One&quot; is also his first top 20 hit on the R&amp;B chart in two years. &quot;Lost in Time&quot; was Benét&#x27;s fifth studio album which was released in the US on November 30, 2010. The first single &quot;Sometimes I Cry&quot; reached number one on the Hot Adult R&amp;B Songs Chart. With its musical direction representing Benét&#x27;s homage to the sweet soul sound of the early to mid-1970s, the album featured duets with Faith Evans; Chrisette Michelle; Ledisi; and Eddie Levert of The O&#x27;Jays.

On June 5, 2012, Benét released his album &quot;The One&quot;. It was the first album released on Benét&#x27;s newly formed record label Jordan House Records, which he created in partnership with EMI. &quot;Real Love&quot; was the first single off &quot;The One&quot; and was the No. 1 added song to Urban AC when shipped to radio in October 2011. In 2013, Eric Benét&#x27;s sixth studio album, &quot;The One&quot;, won him the SoulTracks Readers&#x27; Choice Award for Best Male Vocalist. &quot;The One&quot; delivered 3 big hit tracks including &#x27;Runnin,&#x27; &#x27;Real Love,&#x27; and &#x27;Harriett Jones.&#x27; In April 2014, Benét signed R&amp;B singer-songwriter Calvin Richardson and Goapele to his imprint along with BMG/Primary Wave Music to release their upcoming albums in the US.

In 2014, Benét also released an international album, &quot;The Other One&quot;, teaming up with the European production collective, The Afropeans to revisit his 2012 album &quot;The One&quot;. Later that year, he released an album of classic cover songs, exclusively distributed in Japan, titled, &quot;From E to U, Vol. 1&quot;. In April 2016, he announced a new single &quot;Sunshine&quot; set to premiere on May 13, ahead of his album that was due in the fall. On October 7, 2016, Benét released his eponymous eighth studio album and first major album release since 2012&#x27;s &quot;The One&quot;, the album featured guest appearances from Tamia, Arturo Sandoval and MC Lyte. In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic Benet started an on demand powdered by Omnis titled &quot;Eric After Dark&quot; (stylized as Eric @fter Dark).

=== Acting ===
Benét has also been active as an actor. He had a recurring role on &quot;For Your Love&quot; (1998–2002). In 2001, he made his big-screen debut—alongside that of singer Mariah Carey—in &quot;Glitter&quot;; the film (which has elements of romance, drama, and comedy) was loosely based on Carey’s own life and early experiences within the music industry. Additionally, in 2005, he appeared on &quot;Half &amp; Half&quot;, in which he portrayed Reece Wilcox, and had a recurring role on the 2007 MTV show &quot;Kaya&quot;. On July 9, 2011, Benét’s second feature film role, &quot;Trinity Goodheart&quot;, premiered at the American Black Film Festival. It aired on GMC on August 20. In 2013, Benét appeared on the second season of BET&#x27;s hit television show, the &quot;Real Husbands of Hollywood&quot;. He was a guest star, alongside Kevin Hart, Bobby Brown, and Boris Kodjoe. In 2022, he appeared in &quot;Greed: A Seven Deadly Sins Story&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Benét&#x27;s eldest daughter India Brianne Jordan was born on December 3, 1991, to his partner Tami Stauff, who died in a car accident on April 24, 1993. He married actress Halle Berry in January 2001, but by early October 2003, they had separated, with the divorce finalized in January 2005.

On July 31, 2011, Benét married Toronto native Manuela Testolini, ex-wife of Prince. Their first child together, a girl named Lucia Bella, was born on December 21, 2011. Their second daughter, Amoura Luna, was born on July 13, 2014.

<text>The legal drinking age is the minimum age at which a person can legally consume alcoholic beverages. The minimum age alcohol can be legally consumed can be different from the age when it can be purchased in some countries. These laws vary between countries and many laws have exemptions or special circumstances. Most laws apply only to drinking alcohol in public places with alcohol consumption in the home being mostly unregulated (one of the exceptions being England and Wales, which have a minimum legal age of five for supervised consumption in private places). Some countries also have different age limits for different types of alcohol drinks.
The majority of countries have a minimum legal drinking age of 18. The most commonly known reason for the law behind the legal drinking age is the effect on the brain in adolescents. Since the brain is still maturing, alcohol can have a negative effect on the memory and long-term thinking. Alongside that, it can cause liver failure, and create a hormone imbalance in teens due to the constant changes and maturing of hormones during puberty. Some countries have a minimum legal drinking age of 19 to prevent the flow of alcoholic beverages in high schools, while others like the United States have a minimum legal purchasing age of 21 (18 in P.R. and USVI) in an effort to reduce the amount of drunk driving rates among teenagers and young adults.

There is a concept called underage clubs, where individuals below the legal drinking age are catered for and are served non alcoholic beverages.

==Africa==
The most common minimum age to purchase alcohol in Africa is 18. However, Angola (except Luanda Province), Central African Republic, Comoros, Equatorial Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, and Mali have no laws on the books restricting the sale of alcohol to minors. In Libya, Somalia and Sudan the sale, production and consumption of alcohol is completely prohibited.
==Americas==
In Central America, the Caribbean, and South America the legal drinking age and legal purchase age varies from 0 to 20 years (see table below). In South America in particular, the legal purchase age is 18 years, with two exceptions:
* In Paraguay, the legal drinking age and purchase age is 20 years.
* In Guyana, minors aged 16 or 17 may consume a glass of beer or wine in a restaurant provided they buy a meal.

In North America the legal drinking age and legal purchase age varies from 18 to 21 years:
* In Mexico, the drinking age is 18 in all states.
* In the United States, the minimum legal age to purchase alcoholic beverages is mainly 21 years of age; the two exceptions are Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands where the age is 18. The legal drinking age varies by state, and many states have no age requirements for supervised drinking with one&#x27;s parents or legal guardians.
* In Canada, most provinces have a minimum age of 19 years to buy or consume alcohol, while in Alberta, Manitoba, and Quebec, the minimum age is 18 years. Several provinces permit minors to consume alcohol if it was served to them by their parents/guardians, and it is consumed under their supervision in their home. For further information see .

In the late 20th century, much of North America changed its minimum legal drinking ages (MLDAs) as follows: 

=== United States ===

In the United States, the minimum legal age to purchase alcoholic beverages has mainly been 21 years of age since shortly after the passage of the National Minimum Drinking Age Act in 1984. The two exceptions are Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands where the age is 18. The legal drinking age varies by state, and many states have no age requirements for supervised drinking with one&#x27;s parents or legal guardians.

Despite a rekindled national debate in 2008 on the established drinking age (initiated by several university presidents), a Fairleigh Dickinson University PublicMind poll found in September 2008 that 76% of New Jerseyans supported leaving the legal drinking age at 21 years. No significant differences emerged when considering gender, political affiliation, or region. However, parents of younger children were more likely to support keeping the age at 21 (83%) than parents of college-age students (67%).

Seventeen states (Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Florida, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Carolina, and Wyoming) and the District of Columbia have laws against possession of alcohol by minors, but they do not prohibit its consumption by minors.

Fourteen states (Alaska, Colorado, Delaware, Illinois, Louisiana, Maine, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Ohio, Oregon, Texas, Wisconsin, and Virginia) specifically permit minors to drink alcohol given to them by their parents or by someone entrusted by their parents.

Many states also permit the drinking of alcohol under the age of 21 for religious or health reasons.

Puerto Rico, a territory of the United States, has maintained a drinking age of 18.

United States customs laws stipulate that no person under the age of 21 may bring any type or quantity of alcohol into the country.

==Asia==
==Europe==

Most countries in Europe have set 18 as the minimum age to purchase alcohol. Although Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Gibraltar, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malta, Portugal and Switzerland (except Ticino) maintain a minimum purchase age below 18 years, minors are permitted either full or limited access to alcohol. In 2005, 2007 and 2015 harmonization at the European Union level toward a minimum purchase age of 18 was discussed, but not agreed.

Timeline of changes to drinking/purchase age or laws restricting the access to alcohol for minors:

* In 2002 the Spanish autonomous-communities Madrid, Valencia and Catalonia raised their minimum purchase age to 18 years. Previously, Valencia and Madrid had a minimum purchase age of 16 years, and in Catalonia minors aged 16 or 17 could purchase alcohol up to 23% ABV on- and off-premise.
* In 2004 Denmark raised its off-premise purchase age from 15 to 16 years.
* In November 2005 Switzerland passed its Food and Commodities Regulation (German: Lebensmittel- und Gebrauchsgegenständeverordnung), introducing a ban on alcohol sales to anyone under the age of 16. The Alcohol Law (German: Alkoholgesetz) passed in 1980 requires a minimum age of 18 years for the retail sale of distilled spirits. Therefore, it is prohibited to sell fermented alcohol (e.g. beer, wine, sparkling wine or cider) to anyone under the age of 16, and any distilled alcohol beverages to anyone under the age of 18 years. The canton of Ticino has a cantonal law since 1989 that makes the purchase age limit for all alcohol beverages 18 years.
* In 2006 the Spanish autonomous community Castile and León raised its minimum purchase age from 16 to 18 years.
* In late 2006, Gibraltar lawmakers passed the &quot;Children and Young Persons (Alcohol, Tobacco and Gaming) Act 2006&quot;, which raised the minimum purchase age from 16 to 18 years. But the new law made an exception: minors aged 16 or 17 can purchase and consume beer, wine or cider under 15% ABV on-premise, and pre-packed containers of an alcohol strength not exceeding 5.5% ABV (e.g. alcopops).
* In 2009 France raised its minimum purchase age to 18 years, and fines were increased for selling or serving alcohol to a minor (up to €7,500). Previously, the minimum age was 16 years for off-premise and on-premise purchases of low-alcohol beverages (up to 3% ABV) such as wine, beer, cider, perry, mead, crème de cassis and juices from fermented fruits or vegetables that contain 1.2 to 3° alcohol, natural sweet wines from controlled cultivation and 18 for higher-ABV beverges.
* In October 2009, the government of Malta passed a new law raising its drinking and purchase age from 16 to 17 years.
* In 2010 the Spanish autonomous community of Galicia raised its minimum purchase age from 16 to 18 years.
* In 2011 Denmark passed a law raising the minimum age for off-premise sale of alcohol beverages of &gt;16.5% ABV to 18 years of age. The minimum age to purchase alcohol beverages of &lt;16.5% ABV remains 16.
* In March 2012 Moldova raised the minimum purchase age to 18, from 16 previously.
*Italy raised its minimum purchase age from 16 to 18 in 2012. Previously Italy did not have a purchase age for off-premise sales, and the minimum age of 16 years for on-premise sales was not well enforced.
* In 2013 the government of Portugal restricted alcohol sales to young people: distilled spirits cannot be sold to anyone under the age of 18, and other alcohol beverages (e.g. beer, wine, or cider) cannot be sold to anyone under the age of 16. Previously the minimum age for all alcohol beverages was 16 years.
*, the minimum legal purchase and consumption age was raised from 16 to 18 in the Netherlands. Previously young people over the age of 16 could purchase and consume alcohol beverages of &lt;15% ABV, and those aged 18 and over could purchase all alcohol beverages.
*, the Spanish autonomous community of Asturias raised its drinking age from 16 to 18 years. Asturias was Spain&#x27;s last community with a drinking age of 16 years. The new law brings the drinking age into line with the rest of Spain, with the exception of Balearic Islands where no purchase age limit is set.
*, Portugal harmonized its minimum drinking age to 18 years across all beverage types. Previously the purchase age was 16 years for low-alcohol beverages such as beer, wine or cider.
*, Lithuania raised its minimum drinking age from 18 to 20 years.
* From January 2019 the federal states of Austria decided to align their drinking and purchase ages. The states Burgenland, Lower Austria and Vienna therefore raised their age limits for alcohol beverages containing spirits to 18. Prior to 2019 these states had a general drinking and purchase age of 16 years. The sale and consumption of beer, wine and other fermented alcohol beverages is now prohibited to children and young people under the age of 16 years, and the sale and consumption of spirits to minors under the age of 18 years is prohibited throughout Austria.

<text>Glitter is a 2001 American romantic musical drama film starring Mariah Carey, Terrence Howard and Max Beesley, written by Kate Lanier, and directed by Vondie Curtis Hall. Carey plays Billie Frank, an aspiring singer who, along with her friends Louise (rapper Da Brat) and Roxanne (Tia Texada), is a club dancer. Timothy Walker (Terrence Howard) offers them a contract as backup singers/dancers to another singer. At the premiere of the song they record, Billie meets Julian &quot;Dice&quot; Black (Max Beesley), a nightclub DJ, who helps her in her solo career. In the process, Billie and Dice fall in love.

Carey began working on a film and soundtrack project titled &quot;All That Glitters&quot; in 1997, but it was put on hold in favor of other commitments with her record label. Following this, she aimed to complete the film and album project for the summer of 2001. Shooting began in Toronto and New York at the end of September 2000. Carey used the time to work on the soundtrack of the film, along with Eric Benét and Da Brat, who also appeared in the film. The film and its accompanying soundtrack&#x27;s release dates were delayed after Carey was suddenly hospitalized, citing &quot;extreme exhaustion&quot; and a &quot;physical and emotional breakdown&quot;. The film was released on September 21, 2001, ten days after the release of the soundtrack on September 11, 2001.

&quot;Glitter&quot; was heavily panned by critics and audiences and was a box-office bomb. Reviewers were highly disappointed with the film, and Carey&#x27;s performance as an actress was widely panned, earning her a Golden Raspberry Award for worst actress. This also caused the film to receive negative commentary on social media sites, with Carey herself later admitting that she regretted being part of the film. Some went on to call it one of the worst films ever made. &quot;Glitter&quot; opened in 1,996 American theaters, and grossed $2.5 million in its first week, with a worldwide total of $5.3 million. The soundtrack of the film achieved moderate commercial success and went on to sell over two million copies worldwide, considerably less than Carey&#x27;s previous releases.

==Plot==
In the 1970s, Lillian Frank is a performer at a nightclub in danger of losing her job. In a last-ditch attempt, she tries to rouse the crowd with her torch song, &quot;Lillie&#x27;s Blues&quot;, with her daughter Billie accompanying her on vocals. The plot fails and Lillian is fired. A defeated Lillian lights a cigarette, but then accidentally falls asleep, starting a fire and causing the building to be evacuated. Due to her mother&#x27;s actions, Billie is taken into a care home.

Years later, in 1983, the adult Billie is a club dancer along with her foster-care friends Louise and Roxanne. They meet record producer Timothy Walker, who offers them a contract as backup singers and dancers to famous singer Sylk, who does not actually sing but instead has her voice dubbed in by other performers. Later at a nightclub hosted by Julian &quot;Dice&quot; Black, Sylk debuts &quot;All My Life&quot; and Dice figures out that the voice is Billie&#x27;s. Impressed, he wishes to produce her but Billie raises concerns about her contract with Timothy. However, she gets Timothy to agree on the provision that Dice pays him $100,000.

Billie and Dice start working on songs, and ultimately sign with Guy Richardson of a major record label, and start to fall in love; they go out for dinner in a victorious date and have passionate sex in Dice&#x27;s apartment. Billie&#x27;s first major single, &quot;Loverboy&quot;, is a success, and she performs at an awards ceremony, where she meets singer Rafael. Billie is threatened by Timothy on the debt that Dice failed to pay. Upset with how Dice lied about her contract, Billie leaves him and collaborates with several songwriters, including Rafael, with whom she makes another hit single, &quot;Want You&quot;, and her debut album becomes a massive success.

Billie begins writing a song on her own, due to her emotional pain of losing her mother and Dice. Dice also misses Billie, and also begins writing a song. Billie goes to Dice&#x27;s apartment to reconcile with him but finds him not home. She discovers the music he has written and realizes they wrote the same song, &quot;Never Too Far&quot;, and kisses his music sheet. Dice, upon seeing her lipstick prints on the sheet, plans a reconciliation but is shot dead by Timothy. Before playing at Madison Square Garden, a devastated Billie sees the news report of Dice&#x27;s death, and onstage after, commands the band to stop playing &quot;Loverboy&quot;. She tearfully tells the audience not to take the ones they love for granted, and she then performs &quot;Never Too Far&quot; as a tribute to Dice. Afterward, Billie reads a note Dice had left her, where he tells her that he loves her and that he has found Lillian. The film ends as Billie&#x27;s limo takes her to the secluded rural property where she is happily reunited with her mother.

==Production==
In late 1997, Carey began work on the project under the working title &quot;All That Glitters&quot;, but the project was put on hold due to Columbia Records&#x27; requests to release a compilation album to benefit from the 1998 holiday season. &quot;#1&#x27;s&quot; was released in November 1998. Despite this, Carey continued working on &quot;All That Glitters&quot;, but wished to fulfil her contract with Columbia Records, which had her signed for one more album. In 1999, she released her last album with Columbia Records, &quot;Rainbow&quot;, which included some of the material created for &quot;All That Glitters&quot;. On April 2, 2001, Carey released a joint statement alongside Columbia Records confirming her departure.

Following this departure, Carey signed a US$100 million record deal with Virgin Records (EMI Records) in April 2001. The record label gave Carey full conceptual and creative control over the project. It was announced that &quot;All That Glitters&quot; would take place in 1983, with the sound of its soundtrack following the theme through a modernized version of the 1980s sound. Carey developed the film&#x27;s concept to be about a club dancer who becomes a successful singer and wrote the screenplay alongside Kate Lanier, who expanded Carey&#x27;s original concept. On her character, Carey stated,

We start the movie and we see little Billie and her mom singing, and we realize there&#x27;s a dysfunction going on and her mom&#x27;s unstable. She gets taken away from her mother and ends up in a foster home. Then, we meet her two friends, Louise and Roxanne, who are played by Da Brat and Tia Texada. They&#x27;re her extended family. It&#x27;s Billie&#x27;s journey to understand why she feels abandoned by her mother. ... That&#x27;s what drives her to want to sing. She connects with this [DJ] character. His name is Dice. He&#x27;s sort of like what the mother is in terms of semi-dysfunctional.
Principal photography for &quot;All That Glitters&quot; began in New York City and Toronto in August 2000 and was expected to wrap up that late September with a planned release in March 2001. Later that month, Eric Benét was cast as a character named Caesar when the filming had already begun. The original screenplay, which was already finished, was rewritten several times on set during production and was oftentimes abandoned completely in favor of improvisation. Production experienced several delays and the release was pushed many times. In early April 2001, the film and soundtrack were still titled &quot;All That Glitters&quot;. By May of that year, &quot;All That Glitters&quot; was renamed to &quot;Glitter&quot; for the scheduled August 31, 2001, release.

==Release and promotion==

Following the commencement of &quot;Glitter&quot; and the release of the soundtrack&#x27;s lead single &quot;Loverboy&quot;, Carey embarked on a short promotional campaign for the song and its parent album. However, during the campaign, Carey exhibited what was reported as &quot;erratic behavior.&quot; On July 17, 2001, Carey was interviewed on the program &quot;106 &amp; Park&quot; on the BET network. During the interview, Carey hid her thighs behind large pillows and ranted that her life was &quot;one day that was continuous&quot;. Two days later, on July 19, Carey made a surprise appearance on the MTV program &quot;TRL&quot;. She came out onto the filming stage, pushing an ice cream cart while wearing an oversized shirt. Seemingly anxious and exhilarated, Carey began giving out individual bars of ice cream to fans and guests on the program, while waving to the crowd down below on Times Square, while diverging into a rambling monologue regarding therapy. Carey then walked to host Carson Daly&#x27;s platform and began a striptease, in which she shed her shirt to reveal a tight yellow and green ensemble, leading him to exclaim &quot;Mariah Carey has lost her mind!&quot;
The next day, on July 20, Carey held a record signing for the soundtrack&#x27;s lead single &quot;Loverboy&quot; at Roosevelt Field shopping mall in Long Island before fans and the media. As a camera crew covered the event, she began rambling on several subjects before finally discussing radio-host Howard Stern, and how his form of humor on his program bothered her greatly. At that point, Carey&#x27;s publicist Cindi Berger grabbed the microphone from her hand, and asked the news crew to stop filming. Within a few days, Carey posted erratic voice messages on her website which were soon taken down. On July 26, she was hospitalized, citing &quot;extreme exhaustion&quot; and a &quot;physical and emotional breakdown&quot;. Following her induction at an undisclosed hospital in Connecticut, Carey remained hospitalized and under doctor&#x27;s care for two weeks, followed by an extended absence from the public. During her hospitalization, Carey was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.

Following Carey&#x27;s publicized breakdown and hospitalization, Virgin Records and 20th Century Fox delayed the release of both &quot;Glitter&quot; and its soundtrack. The announcement was made on August 9, 2001, that both the soundtrack and the film would be postponed three weeks, respectively from August 21 to September 11, and from August 31 to September 21. When asked regarding the motives behind the delay, Nancy Berry, vice chairman of Virgin Music Group Worldwide, addressed Carey&#x27;s personal and physical condition:

Mariah is looking forward to being able to participate in both her album and movie projects and we are hopeful that this new soundtrack release date will allow her to do so. She has been making great recovery progress, and continues to grow stronger every day. Virgin Music Worldwide continues to give its absolute commitment and support to Mariah on every level.

Carey&#x27;s first promotional appearance to promote the film itself was on its opening day on Fox Theater, Westwood Village in jeans and a black tank top adorned with an American flag, paying homage to victims of the September 11 attacks. After giving interviews and signing autographs, Carey sat in the center section of the theatre flanked by security guards and handlers, along with audience members who had won tickets through the Los Angeles radio station Power 106. During her appearance, Carey said she hoped that &quot;Glitter&quot; would provide movie-goers an emotional escape during the attacks&#x27; aftermath in the country. &quot;But obviously nothing can overshadow the events that have gone on, and I need to stay focused on that,&quot; she completed.

Fashions in the film were highlighted by costume designer Joseph G. Aulisi. Showcased were clothing by Soo Luen Tom, Luis Sequeira, Richard Saenz, Renee Fontana, and Michael Warbrock. On November 21, 2001, the film was released in the Philippines simultaneously with &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;. In Germany, the film was released under the title &quot;Glitter - Shine of a Star&quot;.

===Home media===
The film was released on VHS and DVD on January 15, 2002, by Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment. A Blu-ray version of the film was released on January 3, 2017, by Mill Creek Entertainment, under license from Sony and Fox.

==Reception==
===Box office===

&quot;Glitter&quot; was released in the United States on September 21, 2001. On its opening day, the film grossed an estimated $786,436 in 1,202 theaters. On the first weekend of its release, &quot;Glitter&quot; was the eleventh-highest-grossing film, grossing an estimated $2,414,596. By the second week, the film dropped 61.1% on tickets sales, ranking at number 15 at the box office. It was originally scheduled to open over Labor Day weekend, but the film was pushed back three weeks when Carey was admitted to a hospital for what she stated was extreme exhaustion. &quot;Glitter&quot; was a commercial failure, grossing a total $4,274,407 in the United States against a $22 million budget. Worldwide, the film grossed a total of $5,271,666 until its close day, on October 18, 2001.

In an interview in 2010, Carey stated that she believed that the film&#x27;s failure at the box office was largely due to the soundtrack&#x27;s release date being September 11, 2001, the same day as the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and The Pentagon. She said, &quot;Here&#x27;s the thing that a lot of people don&#x27;t know, that movie was released on September 11, 2001 – could there be a worse day for that movie to come out? ... I don&#x27;t even know that many people even saw the movie.&quot;

===Critical response===
&quot;Glitter&quot; has a rating of 6% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 87 reviews with an average score of 2.90/10. The consensus states: &quot;&quot;Glitter&quot; is a hodgepodge of movie cliches and bad acting that&#x27;s sure to generate unintentional laughs. Unfortunately, the movie is not bad enough to be good.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 14 out of 100, based on 23 reviews, indicating &quot;overwhelming dislike&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B-&quot; on an A+ to F scale. Criticism focused on Carey&#x27;s acting and the script&#x27;s use of cliches. Upon release, it was widely deemed one of the worst films ever made.

&quot;The Village Voice&quot; proclaimed, &quot;For her part, Carey seems most concerned about keeping her lips tightly sealed like a kid with braces, and when she tries for an emotion—any emotion—she looks as if she&#x27;s lost her car keys.&quot; Peter Bradshaw joked that she &quot;is comfortably out-acted by the cherrywood kitchen counter-top in her spiffy Manhattan apartment&quot;. Roger Ebert spoke relatively well of Carey&#x27;s individual performance, writing that it &quot;ranges from dutiful flirtatiousness to intense sincerity ...&quot; However, he ended with, &quot;and above all, the film is lacking in joy. It never seems like it&#x27;s fun to be Billie Frank.&quot; Bruce Feld of &quot;Film Journal International&quot; also appreciated how the film heightened Carey&#x27;s greatest talents: &quot;Her beauty and extraordinary voice are always shown to advantage, and there are few pleasures in contemporary music as thrilling as hearing Carey soar to a high note and hang there like a trapeze artist who refuses to fall.&quot;

Lawrence Van Gelder of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said, &quot;&quot;Glitter&quot; is mostly dross, an unintentionally hilarious compendium of time-tested cinematic clichés that illustrate the chasm between hopeful imitation and successful duplication.&quot; &quot;Total Film&quot; magazine reviewed the film extremely negatively, awarding it just one star and stating, &quot;It can&#x27;t even scale heights of campy awfulness. This isn&#x27;t so bad it&#x27;s good, it&#x27;s so bad it&#x27;s actionable ... An inept star vehicle that starts out desperately tedious and gets less interesting. Leaves you wishing the Lumiére brothers had said bollocks to cinema and gone down the pub.&quot; The film is listed in Golden Raspberry Award founder John Wilson&#x27;s book &quot;The Official Razzie Movie Guide&quot; as one of the 100 Most Enjoyably Bad Movies Ever Made.

===Retrospective analysis===
20 years after the release of the film, &quot;Mic&quot; writer Treye Green noted in an analysis of the film that upon release, many people used the film to &quot;defame and demean the pop music superstar&quot; but he ultimately praised the theme of the film which is to &quot;put yourself first and never abandon your dreams — a theme Carey lived out in real life as she boldly navigated harsh critiques and continued to push through&quot;. He went on to say,

The ebullience of Glitter was dimmed by a ravenous means to diminish the joy of the project and revel in the perceived leveling of Carey&#x27;s illustrious career. But after 20 years, the project is beginning to get the credit it deserves. The film is being elevated to a cult classic.

Green also called the film a &quot;beloved symbol of the tenacity, resilience, and innovativeness Carey has shown throughout her legendary career&quot;. Medium writer Richard LeBeau also commented on the film saying that the film was not &quot;deserving of its designation as one of the worst films ever made&quot;. He stated that &quot;Lanier&#x27;s screenplay is painfully cliched at times&quot; and that the director, Curtis Hall, made &quot;some cringe-worthy choices after a strong opening segment&quot;. He added that the &quot;vitriol spewed at [Carey] during this period of time wreaked of misogyny, racism, and mental health stigma and completely overlooked the role of national tragedy, corporate sabotage, and her personal struggles&quot;.

===Cast response===

Carey herself has also openly dismissed and distanced herself from the film; she stated in 2002 that &quot;[the film] started out as a concept with substance, but it ended up being geared to 10-year-olds. It lost a lot of grit. It was gritless, in fact. I kind of got in over my head.&quot; In the years after the film&#x27;s release, she has often stated that she regrets doing it. In December 2013, during an appearance on &quot;Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen&quot;, Carey said she considered &quot;Glitter&quot; the biggest regret of her career, calling it a &quot;kitsch moment in history ... in the history of my life&quot;. She stated that the film wreaked havoc on her career; &quot;It was a horrible couple of years (after the film&#x27;s release) and then I had to get my momentum back for people to let it go&quot;; she further added that she would not let anyone around her mention the film in conversation and that it was known as &quot;the G word.&quot; For two decades, Carey refused to perform any song from the film&#x27;s soundtrack in her concerts. In 2020, Carey released her memoir, &quot;The Meaning of Mariah Carey&quot;, which highlighted her experiences throughout the release of the film. She called it &quot;a collision of bad luck, bad timing, and sabotage&quot;.

Da Brat also claimed the film was a &quot;major commercial failure and critical flop&quot;. In 2019, Brat filed for bankruptcy after having to owe a rapper, Shayla Stevens, $8 million. After being &quot;subjected to physical threats, stalking and harassment&quot;, Brat denied earning any money from her social media and from her acting role in &quot;Glitter&quot;. She stated that &quot;the last song she was credited for working on with Mariah was in 2001 and they have not released music since she got out of prison&quot; and that she was &quot;paid the SAG-AFTRA &#x27;Scale&#x27; rate which is the basic minimum daily rate for a day&#x27;s work for each day in the medium&quot;. In 2015, Brat stated in a &quot;Billboard&quot; interview, that she was proud of how she and Carey &quot;made history on some of those songs. She&#x27;s sold millions of records, and I was very happy to be a part of [it]&quot;.

Max Beesley also commented on the film&#x27;s reception stating that it &quot;was a disaster&quot;. He went on to say in an interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot;, that in the film, there was originally &quot;some heavy-duty drama [...] and Mariah really showed her acting boots&quot; but &quot;they just cut all that out and [he] nearly cried when [he] saw it&quot;. He went on to defend the film by saying, &quot;It was released on September 12, the day after the atrocities, so it was dead&quot;. Tia Texada, who played Roxanne, also spoke on the film with Chaunce Hayden of &quot;Steppin Out&quot; in 2003, stating that the film &quot;was a disaster from the time [she] got there&quot;. She went on to speak ill of Carey saying that &quot;working with [her] was really hard&quot;. Conversely, Terrence Howard praised Carey and Beesley&#x27;s performances, noting his &quot;emotional experiences&quot; with Beesley, calling him angelic and talented. He also added that the &quot;experience and getting to know Mariah&quot; was better than &quot;the product&quot;.

===Accolades===
==Soundtrack==

The accompanying soundtrack, &quot;Glitter&quot;, became Carey&#x27;s lowest showing on the charts. The first single, &quot;Loverboy&quot;, peaked at number two on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, but only after Virgin Records spurred sales of the single by dropping the price down to 99 cents. &quot;Never Too Far&quot;, the album&#x27;s second release, was released on October 23, 2001. It failed to impact the main &quot;Billboard&quot; chart, and achieved weak international charting. Carey was unable to film a music video for the single, as she was still recovering from her breakdown. Instead, a video was created using a scene taken directly from the film, where Billie Frank (played by Carey) sings the song at Madison Square Garden during her first sold-out concert. Frank&#x27;s performance of the song in the film omits its entire second verse, and the song&#x27;s development runs in parallel with the film&#x27;s love story.

The album&#x27;s third single, &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop (Funkin&#x27; 4 Jamaica)&quot;, released on December 10, 2001, mirrored the same weak charting as &quot;Never Too Far&quot;, although receiving more rotation on MTV due to its video. Directed by Sanaa Hamri, it features the theme of southern bayous and lifestyles, and presents Carey and Mystikal in &quot;southern style&quot; clothing and hairstyles. Some shots feature three versions of Carey singing into a microphone on the screen at one time. The final single released from &quot;Glitter&quot; was &quot;Reflections (Care Enough)&quot;, which received a limited release in Japan on December 15, 2001. Following its limited promotional push from Virgin, and the absence of a music video, the song failed to make much of an impact. The album itself struggled to reach gold certification, but since its 2001 release has been certified platinum. Virgin Records dropped Carey from the label due to the poor sales of the album and bought her out of their $100 million contract with her for $20 million.

===2018 resurgence===

In 2018, almost two decades after the release of the soundtrack for &quot;Glitter&quot;, a social media campaign called #JusticeForGlitter helped the soundtrack album soar to number-one of the iTunes charts in multiple countries. The soundtrack album also re-entered &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Soundtracks chart at number 14 and topped the R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Catalog Albums chart. Carey later added songs from the album in a medley as part of her Caution World Tour in 2019.

<doc id="1015595" wikidata="Q6170764" url="?curid=1015595" title="Jean Godden">
<text>Jean H. Godden (born October 10, 1931) is a former member of the Seattle City Council. She served from 2004 to 2016. Before running for city council, she was a columnist for the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot; and &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; newspapers.

==Early life and education==

Godden was born in Stamford, Connecticut, on October 1, 1931. Godden&#x27;s family moved many times due to her father&#x27;s job as a surveyor, before settling in Seattle when she was 17.

After two Seattle school levies failed and her son&#x27;s kindergarten class disappeared, Godden and other parents mobilized, and she became PTA president. Godden then joined the League of Women Voters, Citizens Against Freeways, the Municipal League, and the United Way, where she helped to organize the Lake City Community Council, wrote its bylaws and served as one of its first directors.

In 1969, Seattle Mayor Wes Uhlman appointed Godden to his charter review committee and the City&#x27;s Board of Adjustment.

Godden received her bachelor&#x27;s degree in editorial journalism from the University of Washington in 1973 and was elected a member of Phi Beta Kappa. 

==Journalism career==

Godden attained celebrity status in Seattle as a columnist for both daily newspapers, first for the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot; and most recently for &quot;The Seattle Times&quot;. Godden reached that status after years of working in other positions with the paper, including as a business editor, editorial page editor, real estate and urban affairs reporter, and restaurant critic. Godden attended Northwestern University&#x27;s Medill School of Journalism before eventually graduating from the University of Washington&#x27;s School of Communications. She started her newspaper career at the University District Herald as a 19-year-old, joined the P-I in 1974 as a temporary staffer, had her first column published in the P-I in 1983, and finally switched to The Seattle Times in 1991.

==Seattle City Council==

===2003 election===
Godden announced she would run for Seattle City Council, running against incumbent Judy Nicastro, along with five other challengers. In the September primary, Nicastro came in first with 25.16% of the vote, and after a recount, Godden came in second with 17.65%.

In the general election, Seattle Mayor Greg Nickels endorsed Godden, a rare move for a Seattle mayor. Partially weighted down by the Strippergate (Seattle) scandal, Nicastro would lose reelection to Godden, 48% to 52%. 

===2007 campaign===

Godden faced opposition from three challengers in the August primary: Joe Szwaja, Lauren Briel, and Robert Sondheim. She significantly out-fundraised all of her opponents. According to Seattle Ethics and Elections reports, Godden had raised $189,189 as of August 27. Her closest challenger, Szwaja, had raised just over $56,000; as of September 28, 2007, Godden had generated $200,375 in campaign funding.

In the August 21 primary, Godden advanced to the general election, beating Szwaja by more than 30 percentage points. In the general election, Godden won in a landslide against Szwaja, 71% to 29%. After the election, Godden would pay a $150 fine to the Seattle Ethics and Elections Commission for using city resources to schedule campaign events. 

===2011 election===

In August 2011, during the primary, Godden came in first against her three challengers, with 43% of the vote. Bobby Forch, a project manager for Seattle Department of Transportation, came in second with 26% of the vote. Godden would narrowly win the November General Election against Forch, 50.6% to 49.4%. 

===2015 election===
In the election of 2015, for the first time, seven of the city council seats were decided by geographic representation. Godden was opposed in her race for the newly created District 4 seat by opponents Rob Johnson, a transit advocate, and Michael Maddux, a parks activist. Godden conceded on August 6 after coming in third place, and Rob Johnson was eventually elected to the seat.

===Tenure===
She chaired the Libraries, Utilities, and Center Committee and the Central Waterfront, Seawall, and Alaskan Way Viaduct Replacement Program Committee. She was also Vice Chair of the Parks and Neighborhood Committee and a member of the Transportation Committee. Jean also was an alternate on the Parks and Seattle Center Committee.

As chair of the Central Waterfront, Seawall, and Alaskan Way Viaduct Replacement Program Committee, Godden supported the demolition and replacement of the Alaskan Way Viaduct, stating that the waterfront would &quot;...be active and vibrant, populated with parks, restaurants, and cultural amenities.&quot; In an op-ed, Godden would state that the State Route 99 tunnel that would replace the viaduct would not go over budget like Mayor Michael McGinn said it would. The tunnel project was originally budgeted for $3.1 billion, but would go over budget by $223 million.

As chair of the Utilities Committee, she passed legislation to cut rates for senior and low-income customers and increased taxes on Seattle City Light to get its debt under control without cutting services.

==Personal life==

After leaving city council, Godden continued to write articles, contributing to sites such as Westside Seattle and PostAlley.com. She also hosted an interview radio show called &quot;The Bridge&quot; with fellow former city councilmember Sue Donaldson, which is on hiatus due to the pandemic.

Godden has two sons, Glenn and Jeff, and two grandsons, Chris Godden and Matthew Godden, and one great-grandson and three great-granddaughters, Joshua Godden, Raevyn Godden, Calla Godden, and Sloane Godden. She resides in Seattle&#x27;s View Ridge neighborhood.

<text>Ammonium lauryl sulfate (ALS) is the INCI name and common name for ammonium dodecyl sulfate (CH3(CH2)10CH2OSO3NH4). The anion consists of a nonpolar hydrocarbon chain and a polar sulfate end group. The combination of nonpolar and polar groups confers surfactant properties to the anion: it facilitates dissolution of both polar and non-polar materials. This salt is classified as a sulfate ester. It is made from coconut or palm kernel oil for use primarily in shampoos and body-wash as a foaming agent. Lauryl sulfates are very high-foam surfactants that disrupt the surface tension of water in part by forming micelles at the surface-air interface.

==Action in solution==
Above the critical micelle concentration, the anions organize into a micelle, in which they form a sphere with the polar, hydrophilic heads of the sulfate portion on the outside (surface) of the sphere and the nonpolar, hydrophobic tails pointing inwards towards the center. The water molecules around the micelle in turn arrange themselves around the polar heads, which disrupts their ability to hydrogen bond with other nearby water molecules. The overall effect of these micelles is a reduction in surface tension of the solution, which affords a greater ability to penetrate or &quot;wet out&quot; various surfaces, including porous structures like cloth, fibers, and hair. Accordingly, this structured solution allows the solution to more readily dissolve soils, greases, etc. in and on such substrates. Lauryl sulfates however exhibit poor soil suspending capacity.

==Safety==
ALS is an innocuous detergent. A 1983 report by the Cosmetic Ingredient Review, shampoos containing up to 31% ALS registered 6 health complaints out of 6.8 million units sold. These complaints included two of scalp itch, two allergic reactions, one hair damage and one complaint of eye irritation.

The CIR report concluded that both sodium and ammonium lauryl sulfate &quot;appear to be safe in formulations designed for discontinuous, brief use followed by thorough rinsing from the surface of the skin. In products intended for prolonged use, concentrations should not exceed 1%&quot;.

The Human and Environmental Risk Assessment (HERA) project performed a thorough investigation of all alkyl sulfates, as such the results they found apply directly to ALS. Most alkyl sulfates exhibit low acute oral toxicity, no toxicity through exposure to the skin, concentration dependent skin irritation, and concentration dependent eye-irritation. They do not sensitize the skin and did not appear to be carcinogenic in a two-year study on rats. The report found that longer carbon chains (16–18) were less irritating to the skin than chains of 12–15 carbons in length. In addition, concentrations below 1% were essentially non-irritating while concentrations greater than 10% produced moderate to strong irritation of the skin.

==Occupational exposure==
The CDC has reported on occupations which were routinely exposed to ALS between 1981 and 1983. During this time, the occupation with the highest number of workers exposed was registered nurses, followed closely by funeral directors.

==Environment==
The HERA project also conducted an environmental review of alkyl sulfates that found all alkyl sulfates are readily biodegradable and standard wastewater treatment operations removed 96–99.96% of short-chain (12–14 carbons) alkyl sulfates. Even in anaerobic conditions at least 80% of the original volume is biodegraded after 15 days with 90% degradation after 4 weeks.

<doc id="1015600" wikidata="Q80735" url="?curid=1015600" title="Stop word">
<text>Stop words are the words in a stop list (or stoplist or &quot;negative dictionary&quot;) which are filtered out (i.e. stopped) before or after processing of natural language data (text) because they are deemed insignificant. There is no single universal list of stop words used by all natural language processing tools, nor any agreed upon rules for identifying stop words, and indeed not all tools even use such a list. Therefore, any group of words can be chosen as the stop words for a given purpose. The &quot;general trend in [information retrieval] systems over time has been from standard use of quite large stop lists (200–300 terms) to very small stop lists (7–12 terms) to no stop list whatsoever&quot;.

== History of stop words ==
A predecessor concept was used in creating some concordances. For example, the first Hebrew concordance, Isaac Nathan ben Kalonymus&#x27;s , contained a one-page list of unindexed words, with nonsubstantive prepositions and conjunctions which are similar to modern stop words.

Hans Peter Luhn, one of the pioneers in information retrieval, is credited with coining the phrase and using the concept when introducing his Keyword-in-Context automatic indexing process. The phrase &quot;stop word&quot;, which is not in Luhn&#x27;s 1959 presentation, and the associated terms &quot;stop list&quot; and &quot;stoplist&quot; appear in the literature shortly afterward.

Although it is commonly assumed that stoplists include only the most frequent words in a language, it was C.J. Van Rijsbergen who proposed the first standardized list which was not based on word frequency information. The &quot;Van list&quot; included 250 English words. Martin Porter&#x27;s word stemming program developed in the 1980s built on the Van list, and the Porter list is now commonly used as a default stoplist in a variety of software applications.

In 1990, Christopher Fox proposed the first general stop list based on empirical word frequency information derived from the Brown Corpus:This paper reports an exercise in generating a stop list for general text based on the Brown corpus of 1,014,000 words drawn from a broad range of literature in English. We start with a list of tokens occurring more than 300 times in the Brown corpus. From this list of 278 words, 32 are culled on the grounds that they are too important as potential index terms. Twenty-six words are then added to the list in the belief that they may occur very frequently in certain kinds of literature. Finally, 149 words are added to the list because the finite state machine based filter in which this list is intended to be used is able to filter them at almost no cost. The final product is a list of 421 stop words that should be maximally efficient and effective in filtering the most frequently occurring and semantically neutral words in general literature in English.

In SEO terminology, stop words are the most common words that many search engines used to avoid for the purposes of saving space and time in processing of large data during crawling or indexing.

For some search engines, these are some of the most common, short function words, such as &quot;the&quot;, &quot;is&quot;, &quot;at&quot;, &quot;which&quot;, and &quot;on&quot;. In this case, stop words can cause problems when searching for phrases that include them, particularly in names such as &quot;The Who&quot;, &quot;The The&quot;, or &quot;Take That&quot;. Other search engines remove some of the most common words—including lexical words, such as &quot;want&quot;—from a query in order to improve performance.

In recent years the SEO best practices around stop words have evolved along with the fields of machine learning and natural language processing. In February 2021, John Mueller, Webmaster Trends Analyst at Google, Tweeted, &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t worry about stop words at all; write naturally. Search engines look at much, much more than individual words. &#x27;To be or not to be&#x27; just is a collection of stop words, but stop words alone don&#x27;t do it any justice.&quot;

<text>Hans Peter Luhn (July 1, 1896 – August 19, 1964) was a German-American researcher in the field of computer science and Library &amp; Information Science for IBM, and creator of the Luhn algorithm, KWIC (Key Words In Context) indexing, and selective dissemination of information (&quot;SDI&quot;). His inventions have found applications in diverse areas like computer science, the textile industry, linguistics, and information science. He was awarded over 80 patents.

He created one of the earliest practical hash functions in the 1950s.

==Early life and education==
Luhn was born in Barmen, Germany (now part of Wuppertal) on July 1, 1896. After he completed secondary school, Luhn moved to Switzerland to learn the printing trade so he could join the family business. His career in printing was halted by his service as a communications officer in the German Army during World War I. 

==Career==
After the war, Luhn entered the textile field, which eventually led him to the United States, where he invented a thread-counting gauge (the Lunometer) still on the market. From the late 1920s to the early 1940s, during which time he obtained patents for a broad range of inventions, Luhn worked in textiles and as an independent engineering consultant. He joined IBM as a senior research engineer in 1941, and soon became manager of the information retrieval research division.

His introduction to the field of documentation/information science came in 1947 when he was asked to work on a problem brought to IBM by James Perry and Malcolm Dyson that involved searching for chemical compounds recorded in coded form. He came up with a solution for that and other problems using punched cards, but often had to overcome the limitations of the available machines by coming up with new ways of using them. By the dawn of the computer age in the 1950s, software became the means to surmount the limitations inherent in the punched card machines of the past.

Luhn spent greater and greater amounts of time on the problems of information retrieval and storage faced by libraries and documentation centers, and pioneered the use of data processing equipment in resolving these problems. &quot;Luhn was the first, or among the first, to work out many of the basic techniques now commonplace in information science.&quot; These techniques included full-text processing; hash codes; Key Word in Context indexing (see also Herbert Marvin Ohlman); auto-indexing; automatic abstracting and the concept of selective dissemination of information (SDI).

Luhn was a pioneer in hash coding. In 1953, he suggested putting information into &quot;buckets&quot; in order to speed up search. He did not only consider handling numbers more efficiently. He was applying his concepts to text as well. Luhn’s methods were improved by computer scientists decades after his inventions. Today, &quot;hashing algorithms&quot; are essential for many applications such as textual tools, cloud services, data-intensive research and cryptography among numerous other uses. It is surprising that his name and contributions to information handling are largely forgotten.

Two of Luhn&#x27;s greatest achievements are the idea for an SDI system and the KWIC method of indexing. Today&#x27;s SDI systems owe a great deal to a 1958 paper by Luhn, &quot;A Business Intelligence System&quot;, which described an &quot;automatic method to provide current awareness services to scientists and engineers&quot; who needed help to cope with the rapid post-war growth of scientific and technical literature. Luhn apparently coined the term business intelligence in that paper.

Luhn received the Award of Merit from the Association for Information Science and Technology in 1964.

<doc id="1015604" wikidata="Q7324856" url="?curid=1015604" title="Richard Conlin">
<text>Richard Conlin (born May 1, 1948) is a former member of the Seattle City Council, first elected to council in 1997 and reelected in 2001, 2005, and 2009. He was elected, unanimously, by the council to be its president on January 7, 2008 and was unanimously reelected on January 4, 2010.

He was defeated in the 2013 election by Kshama Sawant of Socialist Alternative.

== Council duties ==
As of August 2006, Conlin was chair of the Environment, Emergency Management &amp; Utilities Committee, and chair of the Annexation Committee.

Conlin was a member of Urban Planning &amp; Development Committee; and of Parks, Education, Libraries &amp; Labor Committee. The areas of his focus were public health, sustainability, and the environment. Under the banner of environment, he was involved in efforts to improve the salmon population.

Conlin was involved in emergency response planning for Seattle.

== Background ==
Conlin received a B.A. in history from Michigan State University (1968), as well as a master&#x27;s degree in Political Science (1971). He was elected to two terms (1973–1976) as an Ingham County Commissioner, representing part of the City of East Lansing.

Prior to being elected to Seattle City Council, Conlin directed the Community and Environment Division at Metrocenter YMCA from 1985 to 1996, where started the Earth Service Corps, expanded the Master Home Environmentalist certification (aimed at household waste and pollution) and co-founded the policy group Sustainable Seattle.

Conlin spent time teaching public administration at the University of Botswana and University of Swaziland.

== Plastic bags==
Conlin sponsored the 2007 Zero Waste Strategy, Resolution 30990 which directed Seattle Public Utilities to produce recommendations on how to eliminate residential solid waste, including whether to ban or tax plastic shopping bags and Styrofoam food containers. In 2008 Conlin sponsored a bill to phase out plastic bags in Seattle, a 20-cent surcharge on bags. Businesses with under one million dollars in annual sales were exempt and got to keep the money. The measure passed the city council by a 6-1 margin.

On August 8, 2008, Washington Food Industry, a trade group representing grocery stores, launched a petition drive to nullify the ordinance through citizens&#x27; referendum, funded in part by the plastics industry. On September 15, the petition was certified by the King County Elections Office, delaying implementation of the fee until after a public vote. On August 18, 2009, Seattle voters rejected the fee, 53 to 47 percent. A new plastic bag ban and paper bag fee passed in 2011.

==Recall effort==
On May 31, 2011, a recall effort was announced. Proponents cited Conlin for three alleged violations of law: signing the draft environmental-impact statement of the proposed Seattle waterfront tunnel in lieu of Mayor Mike McGinn, colluding with City Attorney Peter Holmes, and failing to place a certified initiative on the ballot. On July 22, 2011, King Count Superior Court Judge Carol Schapira dismissed the recall petition, which would have required proving Conlin committed malfeasance or an illegal act to go forward.

==NBA/NHL arena opposition==
On October 15, 2012, both the King County Council and Seattle City Council approved a financing plan for a $490 million sports arena in the Seattle&#x27;s Sodo neighborhood, backed by venture capitalist Chris Hansen. The King County Council vote was 9–0, while the City Council vote was 7–2, with Conlin and Nick Licata as the only opposition. The new arena was intended to host the NBA Seattle SuperSonics professional basketball team as well as a potential NHL ice hockey team.

==2013 election and defeat==
In 2013, Seattle Central Community College and Seattle University economics professor Kshama Sawant ran for election as a Socialist Alternative candidate for Conlin&#x27;s seat on the Seattle City Council. She won 35% of the vote in the August primary election, and advanced into the general election against Conlin. On November 15, 2013, Conlin conceded to Sawant after late returns showed him down by 1,640 votes or approximately 1% of the vote.

==Council Leadership==
For a point in his tenure on the council, Conlin served as council president.

==Post-City Council Career==
After serving on the council, Conlin became an affordable housing developer at Conlin Columbia LLC. Conlin also teaches urban planning at the University of Washington.

<text>&quot;Spectre of the Gun&quot; is the sixth episode of the third season of the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Written by the series&#x27; former showrunner, Gene L. Coon (under the pseudonym of Lee Cronin), and directed by Vincent McEveety, it was first broadcast on October 25, 1968.

In the episode, having been found trespassing into Melkotian space, Captain Kirk and members of his crew are sent to die in a surreal re-enactment of the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral.

== Plot ==
The Federation starship &quot;Enterprise&quot; has been directed to make contact with a reclusive species known as the Melkotians. As they approach the Melkotians&#x27; planet, they encounter a probe carrying a warning for them to stay away. Crewmembers hear the warning in their native languages, suggesting that the Melkotians are telepaths. Despite First Officer Spock&#x27;s warnings about the formidableness of telepaths, Captain Kirk orders the ship to remain on course. Once in orbit, Kirk, Spock, Chief Engineer Scott, Chief Medical Officer Dr. McCoy, and Navigator Ensign Chekov transport to the surface.

They are met by a Melkotian emissary, who declares that they have been condemned to death for trespassing. The landing party then find themselves in an abstract landscape that resembles an Old Western town, though many buildings are only simple wooden facades. Furthermore, they find their phasers have been changed into six-shooters, and they cannot contact the &quot;Enterprise&quot;.

Exploring the town, they find a newspaper dated October 26, 1881, the date of the infamous gunfight at the O.K. Corral. The townspeople believe the landing party are members of the Cowboys: Kirk as Ike Clanton, Scott as Billy Clanton, McCoy as Tom McLaury, Spock as Frank McLaury, and Chekov as Billy Claiborne. The crew soon discovers that men dressed as the Earp brothers; Virgil, Wyatt, and Morgan, as well as their deputy Doc Holliday, are preparing to fight them at the appointed time.

Knowing that in real history the gunfight was fatal to most of the Cowboys, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; crew try to change their fates by getting the sheriff and the townspeople to stop the fight and even attempt to negotiate with the Earps, but nothing works. However, when a barmaid, Sylvia, gets close to Chekov, a jealous Morgan Earp shoots him dead. Spock remarks that the real Billy Claiborne had survived, suggesting that the day&#x27;s events could be changed in other ways. To that end, Spock creates an improvised tranquilizer gas grenade to subdue the Earps before the shootout and is surprised when the gas fails to work.

The time of the shootout draws near; a defiant Kirk and the landing party suddenly find themselves at the O.K. Corral, with the Earps approaching. Spock realizes from the failure of the gas grenade and the &quot;death&quot; of Chekov that the world they are in does not conform to the laws of reality and persuades the others that as long as they are convinced of that they cannot be harmed. Kirk has Spock mind-meld with the rest of the team to imbue them with absolute conviction. Thus, when the Earps and Holliday open fire, their bullets pass harmlessly through.

Kirk beats Wyatt Earp in a fistfight and disarms him, but throws his own weapon away rather than avenge Chekov&#x27;s death. The crew then find themselves on the &quot;Enterprise&quot; bridge, including Chekov, who survived perhaps because his mind was only on Sylvia. The Melkotians make contact, inquire about Kirk&#x27;s refusal to kill, and finally welcome the &quot;Enterprise&quot; to approach their planet.

== Production==
In &quot;Star Trek 3&quot;, author James Blish&#x27;s novelization of this episode was called &quot;The Last Gunfight&quot;.

The show was the last episode to air on NBC at 10 p.m. on Fridays.

This was DeForest Kelley&#x27;s third trip to the O.K. Corral. Previously, he had appeared in S4.E8 of You are There as Ike Clanton. Then he played Morgan Earp in the 1957 film, &quot;Gunfight at the O.K. Corral&quot;.

As money was not available for a full set, director Vincent McEveety was asked to use a stylized Western street of false building fronts and no sides.

== Reception ==
Zack Handlen of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; gave the episode a &#x27;B+&#x27; rating, marking it down for loose writing but praising its impressive final showdown and &quot;weird, arrhythmic vibe working for the show for once&quot;. In 2012, &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; ranked this episode as one of top ten &quot;must see&quot; episodes of the original series.

In 2012, &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot; ranked this the ninth best episode of the original &quot;Star Trek&quot;.

Keith R.A. DeCandido of Tor.com initially criticizes the episode for its historical inaccuracies, but then praises it on a philosophical level, noting that Kirk and company never fight when provoked, do not kill for revenge, and ignore the initial warning in favor of carrying out their directives to seek out new life.

In 2016, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; ranked &quot;Spectre of the Gun&quot; as the 20th best episode of the original series, and noted its western style gunfight.

In 2017, Den of Geek ranked this episode as the 10th &quot;best worst&quot; &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode of the original series.

== Home media releases ==
This episode was released on LaserDisc, paired with &quot;Day of the Dove&quot; in 1987 in the United States.

This episode was released on VHS in the United Kingdom, paired with &quot;&quot; (Season 2 Episode 26).

This episode was released in Japan on December 21, 1993 as part of the complete season 3 LaserDisc set, &quot;Star Trek: Original Series log.3&quot;. A trailer for this and the other episodes was also included, and the episode had English and Japanese audio tracks. The cover script was スター・トレック TVサードシーズン

<text>HMS &quot;Africa&quot; was a 64-gun third-rate ship of the line of the Royal Navy, launched by William Barnard at Barnard&#x27;s Thames Yard in Deptford on 11 April 1781.

==Construction and design==
&quot;Africa&quot; was a 64-gun third-rate &quot;Inflexible&quot;-class ship of the line designed by John Williams. Her class was a smaller version of the 74-gun ship of the line HMS &quot;Albion&quot; designed by Sir Thomas Slade which in turn was influenced by the 1719 Establishment design of the 90-gun ship of the line HMS &quot;Neptune&quot;.

&quot;Africa&quot; was ordered on 11 February 1778 to be built at Deptford Dockyard by Adams and Barnard and approved for construction on 29 February. She was laid down on 2 March and launched on 11 April 1781 with the following dimensions: along the gun deck, at the keel, with a beam of and a depth in the hold of . She measured 1,414 tons burthen. The fitting out process for &quot;Africa&quot; was completed at the Deptford and Woolwich dockyards in July.

The lead ship of &quot;Africa&quot;″s class, HMS &quot;Inflexible&quot;, was launched in 1780 and opinions of her sailing qualities were so low that it was decided that no more ships of the design would be built after 1780. The next planned ship of the class, HMS &quot;Diadem&quot;, was instead built to the &quot;Intrepid&quot;-class design, and &quot;Africa&quot; and her sister ships were only completed to the deprecated design because by the time of &quot;Inflexible&quot;″s trials they had already been laid down.

==Service==

===American Revolutionary War===
&quot;Africa&quot; was commissioned by Captain Thomas Newnham in March 1781. In January of the following year command of the ship changed to Captain Robert McDowell and under him she sailed to the East Indies in the squadron of Commodore Sir Richard Bickerton on 6 February 1782. As such &quot;Africa&quot; fought in the unsuccessful Battle of Cuddalore on 20 June 1783. With the American Revolutionary War having ended in September she returned home to Britain where she was paid off in May 1784. The ship was then put in ordinary at Plymouth Dockyard in June. &quot;Africa&quot; was briefly commissioned for one month by Captain James Kempthorne in November 1790 but this was her only service until the beginning of the French Revolutionary Wars in 1792.

===French Revolutionary Wars===
The ship was recommissioned for this war under Captain Roddam Home in November 1793, under whom she sailed to Nova Scotia on 18 May 1794. Having transferred to the Jamaica Station she then participated in an attack on Leogane, Haiti, on 21 March 1796 where, after &quot;Africa&quot; and the ship of the line HMS &quot;Leviathan&quot; had been heavily damaged by shore batteries, the landings were called off. In October of the same year &quot;Africa&quot; was again paid off, spending almost two years out of service before she was recommissioned as a hospital ship under Lieutenant John Bryant in September 1798. Command of the ship changed to Lieutenant John Dixon in early 1800 but little else of note occurred in her service as a hospital ship.

===Napoleonic Wars===

The Napoleonic Wars having begun, &quot;Africa&quot; was reconfigured as a 64-gun ship of the line again by Thomas Pitcher at Northfleet between September 1804 and July 1805. She was recommissioned by Captain Henry Digby at the end of her conversion. &quot;Africa&quot; was present at the Battle of Trafalgar on 21 October 1805; having been separated from the main British fleet before the battle, she arrived from a different direction without knowing the battle plan that Admiral Horatio Nelson had devised. As the rest of the fleet engaged the combined Franco-Spanish fleet in a pell-mell battle, Digby sailed &quot;Africa&quot; down the line of enemy ships in a parallel fashion, exchanging broadsides. She lost eighteen men killed and a further forty-four wounded in the battle.

===Gunboat War===
During the Gunboat War, &quot;Africa&quot; was under the command of Captain John Barrett. On 15 October 1808, &quot;Africa&quot; was escorting a convoy of 137 merchant ships in the Baltic, with the assistance of the bomb vessel HMS Thunder and two gun-brigs. They left Karlskrona that day and on 20 October they anchored in the Øresund off Malmö. At noon a flotilla of Danish gunboats was seen moving towards the convoy and &quot;Africa&quot; sailed to intercept them.
The flotilla consisted of 25 gunboats and seven armed launches, mounting some 70 heavy cannons and with an overall total of some 1600 men. It was under the command of Commodore Johan Cornelius Krieger.

At 1:30 the wind died and &quot;Africa&quot; was immobilized. By 2:50pm the gunboats had stationed themselves off &quot;Africa&quot;″s quarters, where few of her guns could fire, and opened fire. The battle continued until 6:45pm when with night closing in all firing ceased. Had daylight lasted another hour the Danes might have captured &quot;Africa&quot;, however nightfall meant both forces left the battlefield without victory for either side. As it was, she had lost 9 men killed and 51 wounded, including Barrett. She was so badly battered that she had to return to Karlskrona for repairs. The convoy, however, managed to reach Britain.

In 1810 George Frederick Ryves commanded &quot;Africa&quot;, in the Baltic, from which he brought home a large convoy, notwithstanding the severity of the weather and the violence of the gales.

John Houlton Marshall promoted to commander on the ship at a ceremony held on 21 October 1810 to commemorate the Battle of Trafalgar.

===War of 1812===

Under the command of Captain John Bastard, &quot;Africa&quot; was part of Sir Philip Broke&#x27;s squadron that pursued but ultimately failed to catch early in the War of 1812.

==Fate==
&quot;Africa&quot; was broken up in May 1814 at Portsmouth.

<text>HMS &quot;Africa&quot; was a pre-dreadnought battleship of the Royal Navy, and the penultimate ship of the . The ship was built by Chatham Dockyard between 1904 and 1906. Armed with a battery of four and four guns, she and her sister ships marked a significant advance in offensive power compared to earlier British battleship designs that did not carry the 9.2 in guns. Like all ships of the class (apart from ), she was named after an important part of the British Empire, namely Africa.

After commissioning in July 1905, she served briefly with the Atlantic Fleet from October to March 1907 before transferring to the Channel Fleet. She then joined the Home Fleet in 1909. &quot;Africa&quot; participated in tests with shipboard aircraft in January 1912, and she was the first British ship to launch an aeroplane. In mid-1912, she, along with her sister ships, was assigned to the 3rd Battle Squadron, part of the Home Fleet. That year, the squadron went to the Mediterranean Sea during the First Balkan War as part of an international blockade of Montenegro. In 1913, the ship returned to British waters.

When the First World War broke out, &quot;Africa&quot; was transferred back to the 3rd Battle Squadron, which was assigned to the Grand Fleet, the main British fleet during the war. Through 1914 and 1915, the ships frequently went to sea to search for German vessels, but &quot;Africa&quot; saw no action during this period. By the end of the year, the Grand Fleet stopped operating with the older 3rd Battle Squadron ships, and in April 1916 the 3rd Squadron was relocated to the Nore Command. Later that year, &quot;Africa&quot; was attached to the 2nd Detached Squadron, then serving in the Adriatic Sea. In 1917, she was sent to the 9th Cruiser Squadron, based in Sierra Leone; while she was there, her crew was stricken with Spanish flu. &quot;Africa&quot; returned to Britain in October 1918, was decommissioned the following month, and sold for scrap in 1920.

==Design==


Following the development of pre-dreadnought type battleships carrying heavy secondary guns of diameter in the Italian &quot;Regia Marina&quot; and the United States Navy, the Royal Navy decided to build similar ships. Initial proposals called for a battleship equipped with eight guns to support the main battery, though under the direction of William Henry White, the Director of Naval Construction, these were replaced with four guns. The new ships, though based on the general type that had formed the basis of the preceding four battleship designs, marked the first significant change in the series. Like all late pre-dreadnoughts that entered service in the mid-1900s, &quot;Africa&quot; was made almost instantaneously obsolescent by the commissioning of the all-big-gun in December 1906, armed with a battery of ten heavy guns compared to the typical four of most pre-dreadnoughts.

&quot;Africa&quot; was long overall, with a beam of and a draft of . The &quot;King Edward VII&quot;-class battleships displaced normally and up to fully loaded. Her crew numbered 777 officers and ratings. The &quot;King Edward VII&quot;-class ships were powered by a pair of 4-cylinder triple-expansion engines that drove two screws, with steam provided by sixteen water-tube boilers. The boilers were trunked into two funnels located amidships. The &quot;King Edward VII&quot;-class ships had a top speed of from . On her 8-hour full-power trials conducted on 3 June 1906, &quot;Africa&quot; reached a top speed of from an average of .

&quot;Africa&quot; had a main battery of four 40-calibre guns mounted in twin-gun turrets fore and aft. These were supported by a heavy secondary battery of four guns in four single turrets, two on each broadside. The ships also mounted ten 6-inch 50 calibre guns mounted in casemates, in addition to fourteen 12-pounder guns and fourteen 3-pounder guns for defence against torpedo boats. As was customary for battleships of the period, she was also equipped with five torpedo tubes submerged in the hull; two were on each broadside, with the fifth in the stern.

&quot;Africa&quot; had an armoured belt that was thick; the transverse bulkheads on the aft end of the belt was thick. The sides of her main battery turrets were also 8 to 12 in thick, atop 12 in barbettes, and the 9.2 turrets had sides. The casemate battery was protected with of armour plate. Her conning tower had 12-inch-thick sides. She was fitted with two armoured decks, thick, respectively.

==Operational history==

===Early career===
HMS &quot;Africa&quot; was laid down at Chatham Dockyard on 27 January 1904, launched on 20 May 1905, the ship was supposed to be christened by the Marchioness of Salisbury, however, due to unforeseen illness, Lady Londonderry took her place. The construction of the ship was completed in November 1906. Named for the British Empire&#x27;s colonies in Africa, she was the last battleship constructed at Chatham, later classes of battleships being too large for the yard. &quot;Africa&quot; commissioned on 6 November 1906 at Chatham Dockyard for service in the Atlantic Fleet. She transferred to the Channel Fleet on 4 March 1907 and collided with the merchant steamer SS &quot;Ormuz&quot; off Portland on 23 March 1907, suffering only slight damage. &quot;Africa&quot; transferred to the Nore Division, Home Fleet, in June 1908, and in April 1909 joined the Second Division, Home Fleet. During this service she commissioned at Chatham as flagship of Vice Admiral Sir William Henry May, commander of the Third and Fourth Divisions, Home Fleet, on 25 April 1911; the battleship relieved her of this duty on 24 July 1911. In November 1911, she was placed in reserve at the Nore.
In January 1912, &quot;Africa&quot; took part in aircraft experiments at Sheerness. She was fitted for flying off aircraft with a downward-sloping runway which was installed on her foredeck, running over her forward 12-inch (305-mm) turret from her forebridge to her bows and equipped with rails to guide the aircraft. &quot;Africa&quot;″s crew tested the strength and stability of the rails by jumping up and down on them, then held the Gnome-engined Short Improved S.27 pusher seaplane in place as Lieutenant Charles Samson entered its cockpit to attempt the first British shipboard aircraft take-off on 10 January 1912 while the ship was at anchor in the River Medway. The aircraft moved quickly down the runway, dipped slightly after leaving it, but then pulled up and climbed easily. Samson circled &quot;Africa&quot; several times to the cheers of the crew, although on one pass he came uncomfortably close to the ship. After a few minutes, Samson climbed to and concluded his historic flight by landing safely at an airfield ashore.

&quot;Africa&quot; transferred her flight equipment to her sister ship in May. Based on the 1912 flight experiments on &quot;Africa&quot;, &quot;Hibernia&quot;, and battleship , the Royal Navy concluded that shipboard aircraft were desirable for spotting and other fleet duties, but also that a fixed runway on a battleship interfered too much with the firing of the guns and that recovering seaplanes that had landed in a seaway was too difficult to be practical as a routine operation. But shipborne aviation had begun in the Royal Navy aboard &quot;Africa&quot;, and by 1917 would become an important part of British fleet operations.

&quot;Africa&quot; underwent a refit at Chatham in 1912. Under a fleet reorganization in May 1912, &quot;Africa&quot; returned to full commission and she and all seven of her sisters (, , , &quot;Hibernia&quot;, , &quot;King Edward VII&quot;, and &quot;Zealandia&quot;) were assigned to form the 3rd Battle Squadron, assigned to the First Fleet, Home Fleet. The squadron was detached to the Mediterranean in November 1912 because of the First Balkan War (October 1912–May 1913); it arrived at Malta on 27 November 1912 and subsequently participated in a blockade by an international force of Montenegro and in an occupation of Scutari. &quot;Africa&quot; and &quot;Hindustan&quot; returned to the United Kingdom and the Home Fleet in February 1913 and were temporarily attached to the 4th Battle Squadron; They rejoined the 3rd Battle Squadron when it returned to the United Kingdom and rejoined the Home Fleet on 27 June 1913.

===First World War===
====With the Grand Fleet====
Upon the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, the 3rd Battle Squadron, at the time under the command of Vice Admiral Edward Bradford, was assigned to the Grand Fleet and based at Rosyth, where it was reinforced with the five s, It was used to supplement the Grand Fleet&#x27;s cruisers on the Northern Patrol. On 6 August, the day after Britain declared war on Germany, elements of the Grand Fleet sortied to inspect the coast of Norway in search of a German naval base violating Norwegian neutrality. &quot;Africa&quot; and the rest of the 3rd Battle Squadron provided distant support to the operation. No such base was found, and the ships returned to port the next day. On 14 August, the ships of the Grand Fleet went to sea for battle practice before conducting a sweep into the North Sea later that day and into 15 August. During sweeps by the fleet, she and her sisters often steamed at the heads of divisions of the far more valuable dreadnoughts, where they could protect the dreadnoughts by watching for mines or by being the first to strike them. On 2 November 1914, the squadron was detached to reinforce the Channel Fleet and was rebased at Portland. It returned to the Grand Fleet on 13 November 1914.

On 14 December, the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron, 2nd Battle Squadron, and accompanying cruisers and destroyers left port to intercept the German forces preparing to raid Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby. On the first reports of contact with German units on the morning of 16 December, the Grand Fleet commander, Admiral John Jellicoe, ordered Bradford to take the 3rd Battle Squadron to support the ships in contact at 10:00. Four hours later, they met the 1st and 4th Battle Squadrons, en route from Scapa Flow, though they failed to reach the German High Seas Fleet before the latter withdrew. The Grand Fleet remained at sea until late on 17 December, at which point the 3rd Battle Squadron was ordered back to Rosyth. &quot;Africa&quot; and the rest of the squadron joined the Grand Fleet for another sweep into the North Sea on 25 December. The fleet returned to its ports two days later, having failed to locate any German vessels.

The 3rd Battle Squadron went to sea on 12 January 1915 for gunnery training, steaming north and passing to the west of Orkney on the night of 13–14 January. After completing training on the 14th, they returned to Rosyth on 15 January. On 23 January, the 1st and 2nd Battlecruiser Squadrons sortied to ambush the German I Scouting Group in what resulted in the Battle of Dogger Bank the following day. Later on the 23rd, the rest of the Grand Fleet, including &quot;Africa&quot;, sortied to support the battlecruisers. The 3rd Squadron ships left first and steamed at full speed to reach ships of the Harwich Force, which had reported contact with German vessels. The battlecruisers intervened first, and &quot;Africa&quot; and her sisters arrived around 14:00, by which time the battlecruisers had sunk the armoured cruiser and the surviving German ships had fled. The 3rd Battle Squadron patrolled the area with the rest of the Grand Fleet overnight before being detached at 08:00 on 25 January to steam to Rosyth.

Elements of the Grand Fleet went to sea repeatedly over the next few months. The 3rd Battle Squadron patrolled the central North Sea in company with the 3rd Cruiser Squadron from 10 to 13 March. The two units again went to sea to sweep the central North Sea from 5 to 8 April. A major fleet operation followed on 11 April, with the entire Grand Fleet sortieing for a sweep of the North Sea on 12 and 13 April. The squadrons returned to their ports on 14 April to replenish their fuel. Another such operation followed on 17 April, which also failed to find any German ships. The 3rd Battle Squadron returned to Rosyth late on 18 April. The fleet sortied again on 21 April, returning to port two days later. The 3rd Battle Squadron, joined by the 3rd Cruiser Squadron, patrolled the northern North Sea from 5 to 10 May, during which a German U-boat attacked the battleships but failed to score a hit.

Another sweep into the North Sea took place on 17–19 May, and no German forces were encountered. The fleet went to sea again on 29 May for a patrol south to the Dogger Bank before returning to port on 31 May, again without having located any German vessels. The Grand Fleet spent much of June in port conducting training, but the most modern units went to sea on 11 June for gunnery practice to the northwest of Shetland. While they were training, &quot;Africa&quot; and the rest of the 3rd Battle Squadron, along with the 3rd Cruiser Squadron, patrolled the central North Sea. Fleet activities were limited in July, owing to a threatened strike by coal miners, which began on 18 July and threatened the supply of coal for the fleet&#x27;s ships. The strike continued into August, which led Jellicoe to continue to limit fleet activities to preserve his stocks of coal. The fleet saw little activity in September, and during this period, the Grand Fleet began to go to sea without the older ships of the 3rd Battle Squadron. In December, &quot;Africa&quot; went to Belfast for a refit that lasted until January 1916. On her way back to Scapa Flow, she passed unharmed through an area off Cape Wrath that had been mined by the German auxiliary cruiser ; her sister &quot;King Edward VII&quot; was not so lucky, striking one of the mines a few hours later and sinking.

====Later operations====
On 29 April 1916, the 3rd Battle Squadron was rebased at Sheerness (where &quot;Africa&quot; arrived on 2 May 1916), and on 3 May 1916 the squadron was separated from the Grand Fleet, being transferred to the Nore Command. &quot;Africa&quot; remained there with the squadron until August 1916. &quot;Africa&quot; began a refit at Portsmouth Dockyard in August 1916. Upon its completion in September 1916, she left the 3rd Battle Squadron and transferred to the Adriatic Sea, where a British squadron had reinforced the Italian Navy against the Austro-Hungarian Navy since Italy&#x27;s entry into the war in 1915. Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel, the Italian naval chief of staff, believed that the threat from Austro-Hungarian submarines and naval mines in the narrow waters of the Adriatic was too serious for him to use the fleet for active operations. Instead, Revel decided to implement a blockade at the relatively safer southern end of the Adriatic with the main fleet, while smaller vessels, such as the MAS boats, conducted raids on Austro-Hungarian ships and installations. As a result, she saw little activity while stationed there. She left the Adriatic in January 1917 for a refit at Gibraltar, during which the 6-inch guns on her main deck were replaced with four 6-inch guns a deck higher because the original guns were awash in even slightly rough weather.

When her refit was completed in March 1917, &quot;Africa&quot; was attached to the 9th Cruiser Squadron for service in the Atlantic Patrol and for convoy escort duties. She was based mainly at Sierra Leone and escorted convoys between Sierra Leone and Cape Town, South Africa. She underwent a refit at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from December 1917 to January 1918. In September 1918, while &quot;Africa&quot; was based at Sierra Leone, some of her crew became ill during the influenza pandemic that broke out that year. Their numbers virtually doubled each day from less than a handful at the start of the month until 9 September, when 476 crew members were reported ill. On that day, one crewman was reported dead of pneumonia following a case of influenza. Five more crewmen died on 12 September. The next day, another eight perished. On 14 September, ten more crewmen died. &quot;Africa&quot; sent burial parties ashore daily, and the ship was put into quarantine. By the time &quot;Africa&quot; hauled down her quarantine flag on 30 September 1918, 52 crew members had died of illness out of a total complement of less than 800.

In October 1918, &quot;Africa&quot; returned to the United Kingdom; she went into reserve at Portsmouth in November 1918. Following the First World War, &quot;Africa&quot; was briefly the depot ship of the 9th Cruiser Squadron and was employed as an accommodation ship. In December 1919 she was selected to replace the protected cruiser as stokers&#x27; training ship at Portsmouth, but this was cancelled. &quot;Africa&quot; was placed on the sale list in March 1920, and was sold for scrapping to Ellis &amp; Company of Newcastle upon Tyne, England on 30 June 1920. She was scrapped at Newcastle.

<text>The International School of Beijing (ISB, ) is a non-profit international co-educational day school in Beijing, China. The school was founded in 1980; it is the oldest and largest international school in Beijing. ISB accepts students from Early Years 2 to Grade 12. ISB offers a dual English and Chinese language program for students from Early Years to Grade 5. It also offers the International Baccalaureate Diploma Program in Grades 11 and 12. ISB is recognized by the Beijing Education Commission (BEC) as an independent school for expatriate children.

== History ==
In the 1970s, a small foreign school was established in Beijing, under the auspices of the United States Liaison Office in Beijing, precursor to the US Embassy. Classes were held in a hallway of a diplomatic apartment compound in Sanlitun, with 8 students and 2 certified teachers.

In 1980, the US Embassy merged its school with those of the British and Australian embassies. The Canadian and New Zealand embassies joined in, and the five nations together formally founded the International School of Beijing. Located on the grounds of the US Embassy, the school provided education for the children of the five founding embassies; eventually, as space allowed, children from other embassies were permitted to enroll. Bound by the strict requirements imposed on diplomatic schools, the founding embassies worked to meet educational needs of the growing expatriate community in Beijing.

In 1988 under new regulations, China&#x27;s Ministry of Foreign affairs officially registered ISB as a &quot;school for diplomatic children.&quot; The campus moved to the Lido complex of offices and housing units, and the school was permitted to accept applications from all expatriate residents of Beijing.

In 1991 ISB became the first school in Beijing to offer the full Diploma Program of the International Baccalaureate Organization. And in 1997, the school was accredited by WASC (in the United States).

In January 2002, the Beijing Municipal Education Bureau allowed ISB to be restructured as an &quot;independent school for foreign children&quot;. In the same year, the school moved to a , purpose-built facility in the Shunyi district, a northeastern suburb of Beijing. The following year, ISB was accredited by the Chinese authority NCCT. 

ISB completed the construction of a detached sports facility in 2017, complete with two pressurized domes with air filtration, providing indoor tennis courts and a playing field area.

== Campus ==
ISB is situated on a campus in Shunyi district, approximately 30 minutes from downtown Beijing and close to expatriate residential compounds. Two purpose-built sports domes sit side by side over 8,500 square meters. The sports domes have H-14 grade filtration systems. In addition, ISB has four fully equipped gymnasiums (one with a climbing wall); baseball and softball diamonds; two full-sized turf soccer fields; a rugby pitch, running track, and a 665-seat stadium and an aquatics center with a 25-meter pool and diving boards.

In the main school building are 12 science labs, a student cooking lab, a visual arts wing in middle and high school, and art studios in elementary school. The performing arts wing consists of a 600-seat theater, Black Box theater, rehearsal space, and studio stage. The main school building also has two library-media centers with more than 82,000 volumes and over 160 magazine subscriptions. ISB supports a one-to-one MacBook laptop program for each student in grades 2 through 12.

In 2020 the ISB opened four new facilities: an early years learning center, an elementary school arts and theater, middle and high school performing arts center, and a middle and high school art and design center.

In 2023, ISB added a Middle School Playground, Golf Simulators, and 1323 Solar Panels, aligning with the school&#x27;s sustainability goals.

In 2024, a new main entrance was constructed.

==Organization==
ISB is a non-profit school governed by a 12-member Board of Trustees. These 12 volunteers are responsible for setting and approving school policy, overseeing ISB&#x27;s financial status, recruiting, supporting and evaluating the Head of School and guiding strategic direction of the school, and sets goals to fulfill its responsibilities and establishes standing committees to manage its work.

==Accreditations==
The ISB is accredited with the New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC) in the United States; the Council of International Schools and the International Baccalaureate Organization in Europe; and the National Center for School Curriculum and Textbook Development (NCCT) in China.

ISB is a member of the East Asia Regional Council of Overseas Schools (EARCOS) and the National Association of College Admissions Counselors (NACAC).

==Education and early career==
Rasmussen holds a bachelor&#x27;s degree in political science from Pacific Lutheran University and a J.D. from Valparaiso University. After graduating, he worked at the Yakima County Prosecuting Attorney&#x27;s Office for three years. From 1976 to 1988, Rasmussen was a legislative aide to Seattle councilmember Jeanette Williams, working on transportation and parks projects, including construction of a new West Seattle bridge and the city&#x27;s purchase of the Kubota Gardens.

After Williams&#x27; election defeat in 1989, Rasmussen became a top manager at the nonprofit Senior Services of Seattle/King County. In 1999, Mayor Paul Schell hired him as director of the office of senior citizens, serving until his 2003 election win. Before running for city council, Rasmussen also chaired the parks committee of the Queen Anne Community Council.

==Seattle City Council==
===Elections===
In 2003, Rasmussen ran against incumbent Margaret Pageler, citing the council&#x27;s lack of focus on local issues as the reason for his candidacy. In the September open primary, Pageler came in first against her five challenges, with 39% of the vote, with Rasmussen coming in second with 25%. Rasmussen criticized Pageler&#x27;s application to the become president of the Seattle Chamber of Commerce the prior year and for the financial crisis that Seattle City Light was facing. In the November general election, Rasmussen defeated Pageler, 52% to 48%.

Rasmussen ran for reelection in 2007 unopposed. In his 2011 reelection bid, Rasmussen had only one challenger, Dale Pusey, which he defeated in a landslide in the general election with 72% of the vote.

===Tenure===
From 2004 to 2007, he was chair of the Housing, Human Services &amp; Health Committee and vice chair of the Urban Development &amp; Planning Committee. From 2008 to 2009, he was chair of the Parks &amp; Seattle Center Committee, the vice chair of the Culture, Civil Rights, Health and Personnel Committee, and the Labor Policy Committee. 

Rasmussen chaired the Transportation Committee for his final six years in office. As chair, he championed the &quot;big dig&quot; tunnel replacement for the Alaskan Way Viaduct replacement. Rasmussen also supported Proposition 1, a levy that gave new funding to Seattle transportation projects, and pushed for expanded bus services from those funds. In his final year in office, he pushed for expanded bus service, using Prop 1 funds, and a new tax levy, &quot;Bridging the Gap II.&quot;

In 2015, Rasmussen announced he would not seek reelection, choosing not to run for the newly created District 1 seat.

==Personal life==
Rasmussen is gay and is active in LGBT legal and political organizations, including as a board member of the Lambda Legal Defense Fund. He lives in West Seattle with his partner Clayton Lewis.

<doc id="1015626" wikidata="Q2889791" url="?curid=1015626" title="Battle of Ridgeway">
<text>The Battle of Ridgeway (sometimes the Battle of Lime Ridge or Limestone Ridge) was fought in the vicinity of the town of Fort Erie across the Niagara River from Buffalo, New York, near the village of Ridgeway, Canada West, currently Ontario, Canada, on June 2, 1866, between Canadian troops and an irregular army of Irish-American invaders, the Fenians. It was the largest engagement of the Fenian Raids, the first modern industrial-era battle to be fought by Canadians and the first to be fought only by Canadian troops and led exclusively by Canadian officers. The battlefield was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1921 and is the last battle fought within the current boundaries of Ontario against a foreign invasion.

==Background==
The New York City-based Fenian Brotherhood was attempting to support related groups in Ireland to force the United Kingdom into negotiating toward the formation of an independent Irish Republic. They took advantage of the ready supply of arms in the United States after the recently concluded Civil War, and of the ample number of unemployed young men who had emerged from that conflict with some degree of military training. The plan was to take Canada temporarily hostage in the hope of demoralizing British rule in Ireland by precipitating a political crisis in Britain. The Fenians were also mistakenly counting on receiving U.S. recognition for the seizure of Canadian territory. It was still a ragtag army, however, that assembled on the American shore of the Niagara River during the last weeks of May 1866. The Fenians had made little attempt at secrecy, and both American and British authorities were aware of the imminent military operation but could not pin-point the exact crossing points in advance.

===Units involved===
The Fenian units involved in the battle were the 7th Buffalo (NY), the 18th Ohio, the 13th Tennessee, and the 17th Kentucky Fenian Regiments, as well as independent companies from Indiana and from New Orleans (the Fenian Louisiana Tigers). The Fenians wore an assortment of blue U.S. Army and grey Confederate Army tunics, some with green facings sewn to them, but many of the Fenians took to the field in civilian clothing with green scarves. The Fenians carried battle standards consisting of the Irish &#x27;sunburst&#x27; in gold on a green background and one standard featuring the Irish Harp.
The Canadian units at Ridgeway were the Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Toronto (which had 7 killed, 2 died of wounds and 21 wounded in the battle); the 13th Hamilton Battalion, predecessor of the modern Royal Hamilton Light Infantry Regiment (which had 15 wounded) and the &quot;York Rifle Company&quot; and the &quot;Caledonia Rifle Company of the Haldimand County Militia&quot;, predecessors of The Haldimand Rifles (of which the latter had 2 men wounded). Additionally, &quot;Company 9, Queen’s Own Rifles&quot; consisted of 28 students and a lecturer from the &quot;University Rifles&quot;, which was raised at University College, Toronto of University of Toronto (3 students died in the battle: Malcolm MacKenzie, William Tempest, and John Mewburn). Canadian Orangeman Alexander Muir, author of the unofficial Canadian national anthem, &quot;The Maple Leaf Forever&quot;, fought with the Queen&#x27;s Own at Ridgeway. The Number 1 Company from Niagara-on-the-Lake was called and sent to Fort Erie in June 1866. Timothy Jeremiah Harrington one of three pensioners, was with No. 1 Company to halt the Fenian Invasion. In a book from the Niagara Historical Society, No, 27 circa 1915, “Names Only But Much More, BY JANET CARNOCHAN -Number 1 Company by BY MRS. E. ASCHER.

==Invasion==
===First day of Fenian crossings===
The Fenian insurgents, led by Brigadier General John O&#x27;Neill, a former Union cavalry commander who had specialized in anti-guerrilla warfare in Ohio, secured boats and transferred some 800 men across the Niagara River, landing above Fort Erie, before dawn on June 1, 1866.

An additional 200–400 Fenians and supplies crossed later during the morning and early afternoon until the US Navy gunboat, the USS &quot;Michigan&quot;, began intercepting Fenian barges at 2:20 p.m. — 13 hours after the first Fenian advance party landed in Canada.

An advance party of 250 men of Lieutenant Colonel George Owen Starr&#x27;s 17th Kentucky Fenian Regiment landed in Canada at about 1:30 AM and raised a large Fenian green flag with a gold Irish harp some two hours in advance of O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s main force. Starr&#x27;s advance party rushed to seize the town, cut telegraph wires and take control of the railway yards south of Fort Erie by dawn as the rest of O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s force was disembarking. U.S. authorities also allowed unarmed men to board the ferry from Buffalo and small boats freely crossed the Niagara River until the afternoon. It is estimated that at least 1,000 and possibly as many as 1,350 Fenians in total crossed during the first thirteen hours of June 1, but it is impossible to determine a precise number.

O&#x27;Neill spent the first day trying to rally the local citizenry to the Fenian cause and to commandeer supplies for his mission, but his force was plagued by desertions almost from the outset. By nightfall, O&#x27;Neill estimated that he had perhaps 500 men remaining in his camp. Later during the night, O&#x27;Neill was reinforced by an additional column of 200 Fenians who had been deployed earlier on a bridgehead at Black Creek guarding against an approach from Chippawa in the north, bringing his total strength at Ridgeway to at least 650 men. A proclamation was posted explaining the reasons behind the invasion: 

===Battle===

Meanwhile, the British were mobilizing both local Canadian militia and British garrison troops to defend against the impending invasion of Canada. The Fenians night-marched north across Black Creek (Ontario) through a cedar swamp, then turned inland on Ridge Road on the morning of June 2; taking up a defensive position on Limestone Ridge near the present Canadian town of Ridgeway. There, they clashed with 850 advancing Canadian militia (the dark-green uniformed Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Toronto and the traditionally clad red-coated 13th Battalion from Hamilton, reinforced by two local companies from Caledonia and York) commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Alfred Booker of the 13th Battalion.
In the first hour of the battle, the Canadians appeared to prevail, driving Fenian skirmishers back across Bertie Road. Then something went wrong: to this day, it is not clear exactly what. Some sources say that the Canadian militiamen mistook Fenian scouts on horseback for cavalry. Orders to form a square to defend against a cavalry charge, although quickly countermanded, led to chaos in the Canadian ranks and Booker ordered a withdrawal after ninety minutes of battle. Other sources indicate that troops mistook a company of redcoated 13th Battalion infantry for British troops relieving them and began to withdraw; which then triggered a panic among other troops who mistook the withdrawal for a retreat. O&#x27;Neill, observing the chaos breaking out in the Canadian ranks, quickly ordered a bayonet charge that completely routed the inexperienced Canadians. The Fenians took and briefly held the town of Ridgeway. Then, expecting to be overwhelmed by British reinforcements, they quickly turned back to Fort Erie where they fought a second battle, the Battle of Fort Erie, against a small but determined detachment of Canadians holding the town.

The Canadian loss was 9 killed, 37 wounded (some severely enough to require amputation), and 22 died of wounds or disease later. One British soldier, Corporal Carrington, 47th (Lancashire) Regiment of Foot, died on a forced march from Chippawa to Stevensville. His grave was identified 146 years later on the eve of Remembrance Day 2012. O&#x27;Neill claimed he had one or two men killed, but Canadians claimed more. The relatively low casualty figures make this an interesting battle for proponents of theories about soldiers&#x27; reluctance to shoot to kill, but could also be accounted for by the fact that the Fenians had deployed only their skirmishers in an attempt to lure the Canadians towards their main force which did not advance until the last minutes of the battle, when they launched a bayonet attack that broke Canadian lines.

===Fenian withdrawal===
The battle at Ridgeway was followed by a Fenian victory later in the afternoon over the heavily outnumbered Canadian volunteer Welland Field Battery (armed as an infantry unit) and the Dunnville Naval Brigade at Fort Erie. Nevertheless, the rapid convergence of large British and Canadian reinforcements convinced many of the Fenians to return in haste to the United States – some on logs, on rafts, or by swimming. O&#x27;Neill and 850 Fenians surrendered their arms to waiting U.S. authorities. In his book, &quot;1916: The Easter Rising&quot;, Tim Pat Coogan said the force was described at the time as the Irish Republican Army.

==Aftermath==

Some of the Canadians were particularly bitter at what they saw as Booker&#x27;s mismanagement of the battle and believed that had he not given the order to withdraw they would have won the day. In fact, the Canadians were only fighting the Fenian advance units, who were steadily luring the Canadians forward towards the main Fenian force, which was waiting for them on the high ground north of Bertie Road. Had the Canadians not retreated, short on ammunition and inexperienced, they might have faced a heavier defeat by the Civil War veterans of the main Fenian army (which was so well-supplied with ammunition that they dumped thousands of rounds into Black Creek on the eve of the battle in order to lighten their load). The Fenians were so experienced in handling their single-shot muzzle-loading weapons that it was wrongly reported that they were all armed with seven-shot Spencer repeating rifles. Fewer than half of the Canadians on the field had practised firing live rounds before the day of the battle and there had been no military conflict in Canada since the Rebellions of 1837–38.

Since the Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles have been continuously active in the Canadian military since 1860, the men who fell or were wounded at Limestone Ridge can be considered the first casualties of the Canadian Army; even though it was not formally established as such until 1883. Ensign Malcolm McEachren of No. 5 Company, QOR, killed leading his men in the opening minutes of the battle, can therefore be considered the Canadian army&#x27;s first man killed in action. The final casualty figures for the Fenian Raids into Canada 1866, when including deaths from disease while on service in both Canada West (Ontario) and Canada East (Quebec), were calculated by the Militia Department in 1868 as 32 dead and 103 wounded or felled by disease (including a female civilian accidentally shot by the militia). One British soldier from the 47th Lancashire Regiment of Foot, Corporal Carrington, died from heat stroke on a forced march from Chippawa to Stevensville on the morning of the battle. His grave was identified in November 2012.

==Legacy==
The Canadian press exaggerated the scope and nature of the defeat at Ridgeway, particularly anti-confederationist press which claimed Ridgeway was proof that Canadians will never be able to defend themselves without the presence of the British Army. The inefficiency of the Militia Department under Canada West&#x27;s attorney general and minister of militia John A. Macdonald was covered up by two Military Boards of Inquiry that concluded that the blame lay with inexperienced frontline troops that panicked and broke, and not with the officers who led them and the government who undersupplied and undertrained them. The Battle of Ridgeway became a point of shame in Canadian national military heritage and history and the Canadian government was reluctant to recognize or acknowledge the veterans of the battle for nearly 25 years.

In 1890, the Veterans of &#x27;66 Association held a protest demonstration at the Volunteers Monument in Queen&#x27;s Park by laying flowers at the foot of the monument on June 2, the 24th anniversary of the battle of Ridgeway. It took a 10-year campaign of protest and lobbying for the Canadian government to sanction a Fenian Raid Medal and land grants to veterans in 1899–1900. The protest became an annual memorial event known as Decoration Day, when graves and monuments of Canadian soldiers were &quot;decorated&quot; in flowers. For the next 40 years from 1890 to 1931, Decoration Day would be Canada&#x27;s popular national memorial day, the first Remembrance Day, commemorated on the weekend nearest to June 2 and acknowledging Canadian dead in the Battle of Ridgeway, the North-West Rebellion (1885), the South African War (1899–1902), and the Great War (1914–1918). In 1931 the &quot;Remembrance Day Act&quot; established November 11, Armistice Day, as Canada&#x27;s national official memorial day. At the same time the act removed the casualties of Ridgeway and the Northwest Rebellion from national memorialization, fixing Remembrance Day to Canadian casualties overseas starting from the South African War.

The Battle of Ridgeway was Canada&#x27;s first modern battle, the first fought exclusively by Canadian troops and led on the battlefield entirely by Canadian officers, the battle in which Canada&#x27;s current modern military sustained its first thirty troops killed in action, and the last battle fought within the present-day boundaries of Ontario against a foreign invasion.

===Memory===

The site of the battle is commemorated by a cairn and interpretive signs on the north side of Garrison Road between Ridge Road and Burleigh Road. The location has been designated as a national historic site. An historic house (which was not involved in the battle) has also been moved to the site.

The Canadian Volunteer Monument in Queen&#x27;s Park, Toronto, honours nine Toronto militia volunteers from The Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Canada including three University of Toronto student volunteers who died in the battle, and is on the west side of Queen&#x27;s Park Crescent ().

In March 2012 a monument was unveiled in Tow Path Park, Buffalo, New York, near the site where the Irish troops assembled prior to the invasion.

<doc id="1015633" wikidata="Q7027479" url="?curid=1015633" title="Nick Licata (politician)">
<text>Nick Licata (born 1947) is a retired member of the Seattle City Council, having left office at the end of 2015 after being elected to five terms and serving 18 years. While on the council, he served as Council President and chaired numerous committees, including Budget, Parks, Public Safety, Human Services, Housing, Arts and Culture. Licata is also a published author of three books: a children&#x27;s novel, a non-fiction book on how to be an active citizen, and a memoir and analysis of the sixties Student Power movement. 

==Personal history and education==

In 1969 Licata received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in political science from Bowling Green State University where he was President of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) and Student Body President. In 1973 he received his master&#x27;s degree in sociology from the University of Washington. He lived in a commune for over twenty years.

===Publisher=== 

Licata founded and published the &quot;People&#x27;s Yellow Pages&quot; (1973 and 1976), which listed community and political groups and social and public services in Seattle. He later published the &quot;Seattle Sun&quot; alt-weekly, which was published from 1974 to 1982. Currently publishing the twice-monthly Citizenship Politics (formerly Urban Politics), which began in 2016. It analyzes political and social movements that affect democracies.

=== Book Author===

Licata is the author of Princess Bianca and the Vandals, a children&#x27;s fantasy/adventure book dealing with environmental issues. In 2016, he authored Becoming A Citizen Activist - Stories, Strategies and Advice for Changing Our World, published by Sasquatch Books. It received the 2017 Living Now Book Award from IndependentPublisher.com, recognizing the year’s best world-changing books 

In 2021, he authored &quot;Student Power, Democracy and Revolution in the Sixties,&quot; published by Cambridge Scholars Publishing. Academic review by Hans G. Schuetze, University of British Columbia in The Canadian Journal of Higher Education 

Activism

Licata helped found the anti-redlining organization Coalition Against Redlining in Seattle and testified before Congress on the Community Reinvestment Act. In 1983 Licata co-founded Give Peace a Dance which, for 6 years, held 24-hour dance marathons to raise funds for TV ads promoting nuclear disarmament. Licata was Co-Chair of Citizens for More Important Things, a group opposed to excessive public funding for professional sports stadiums. It wrote King County Initiative 16, collecting over 73,000 signatures to be placed on the ballot. It won but was voided by the State Legislature a week later. Licata later testified before Congress at the request of Congressman Dennis Kucinich on the financial drain that public funding of professional sport teams placed on municipal governments. Licata is founding chair of Local Progress, a nationwide organization of over 1,300 progressive local officials. &quot;The Nation&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Progressive Honor Roll of 2012&quot; chose Licata as its &quot;Most Valuable Local Official&quot; in the United States.

==Seattle City Council tenure==

Upon his election to the City Council, he instituted poetry readings, titled Words Worth, in his committee meetings believing that the personal insight of poetry has the power to enlighten the routine of government. Licata initiated Seattle&#x27;s &quot;Poet Populist&quot; position in 1999 which engaged the public in voting each year for a local poet to lead public events, read in public schools and libraries. The mayor adopted an official process for selecting a City Poet in 2015 as the Seattle Civic Poet program. In partnership with the Seattle City of Literature, the Seattle Office of Arts &amp; Culture (ARTS) regularly announce the new poets. 

In 2007, Licata supported Initiative I-91, which prohibited the city from supporting sports teams unless such investments had a fair return, which facilitated the relocation of the Seattle SuperSonics from Seattle to Oklahoma City. In addition, Licata stated in 2007 that the absence of the SuperSonics from Seattle would leave a &quot;near zero&quot; economic impact to the city. He later stated that his remarks were &quot;smug and wrong (Licata newsletter July 2006)&quot; but the damage had been done. While the public investment into arenas and stadiums can be debated, it can not be debated that the Sonics supported 1,300 jobs and were responsible for $188 million in local economic activity. &quot;On September 24, 2012, Licata voted No on a proposed SoDo basketball arena, which was eventually approved 6-2 by the remaining Council members. That proposed arena was subsequently rejected in favor of rehabbing the existing Seattle Center arena later named the Key Arena and now named the Climate Pledge Arena, currently home to the Seattle Storm WNBA team and the Seattle Kraken NHL hockey team.

Licata was one of two City Council members who supported rebuilding the Alaskan Way Viaduct in 2008, and later supported a tunnel alternative.

Licata sponsored Seattle&#x27;s law requiring that all Seattle employers with more than four full-time equivalent employees provide paid sick leave.

During part of his 18 years on the council, Licata served as Council President.

<text>&quot;Orange Crush&quot; is a song by the American alternative rock band R.E.M. It was released as the first single from the band&#x27;s sixth studio album, &quot;Green&quot;, in 1988. It was not commercially released in the U.S. despite reaching number one as a promotional single on both the Mainstream and Modern Rock Tracks (where, at the time, it had the record for longest stay at number one with eight weeks, beating U2). It peaked at number 28 on the UK Singles Chart, making it the band&#x27;s then-highest chart hit in Britain, where they promoted the song by making their debut appearance on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;.

The video for the song, directed by Matt Mahurin, won the band its first VMA, for Best Post-Modern Video. &quot;Orange Crush&quot; was also the first song to win in the category. The video, shot exclusively in black and white, does not feature the band at all.

The song was placed on R.E.M.&#x27;s Warner Bros. Records compilation &quot;In Time: The Best of R.E.M. 1988–2003&quot; in 2003, and a live version appears on the &quot;R.E.M. Live&quot; album recorded in Dublin in 2005.

The song&#x27;s title refers to the chemical defoliant Agent Orange manufactured by Monsanto Corporation and Dow Chemical for the U.S. Defense Department and used in the Vietnam War. 

Stipe opened the song during the Green World Tour by singing the U.S. Army recruiting slogan, &quot;Be all you can be... in the Army.&quot; Stipe&#x27;s father served in the Vietnam War.

<text>Jan Drago (born May 12, 1940) is an American politician and educator from Seattle who served on the Seattle City Council and King County Council.

==Personal history and education==
Prior to her election to Seattle City Council, Drago was schoolteacher (1973–1978) and later the owner of a Häagen-Dazs Ice Cream Shoppes franchise in downtown Seattle (1980-1991). She is a graduate of Douglass College, Rutgers University (B.A., Psychology). She and her husband, Noel, are residents of Seattle&#x27;s Pioneer Square, a downtown historic district, and have four sons and four grandsons. Her favorite form of relaxation is working her plot in Seattle&#x27;s Judkins P-Patch.

==Seattle City Council and King County Council tenures==
From 1994 to 2009, Drago was a member of Seattle City Council.

During that time, she was Council President (1996-1997 and 2004–2005), chair of the Finance and Budget Committee (1999–2003) and chair of the Transportation Committee.
She also served on the Housing and Economic Development Committee, and the Parks and Seattle Center Committee. She represented the council on the Puget Sound Regional Council and its Transportation Policy Board as well as King County&#x27;s Regional Transportation Committee, the Trade Development Alliance, the Seattle Convention and Visitors’ Board, PortJobs Board, Seattle-Chongqing Sister Association, Seattle-Taejon Sister City Council, the Sister Cities Coordinating Council, and the Sister City Association. For eight years, she was a Council representative on the Civic Center Client Group.

On March 1, 2009, Drago announced her intention to retire from the Seattle City Council and not seek another term.

Drago&#x27;s lasting impact, as a Seattle elected official, was on transportation. As a councilmember, Drago played a leading role in the success of a mega-project, the deep-bore tunnel under downtown that replaced the Alaskan Way Viaduct; in the transformation of a major arterial—the two-way Mercer Street—that helped develop the South Lake Union neighborhood now home to Amazon headquarters; and the beginning of the Seattle Streetcar network.

On May 26, 2009, Drago declared that she was running for Mayor of Seattle, seeking to unseat two-term Mayor Greg Nickels. She ultimately finished fifth in the August 2009 primary election and failed to advance to the November general election.

On January 4, 2010, only four days after she had left the Seattle City Council, Drago was appointed to the King County Council, District 8. She filled the seat left vacant by Dow Constantine&#x27;s election as King County Executive. As a condition of her appointment, she agreed not to seek the post in the November 2010 election.

==Civic leadership and volunteer work==

Drago was also a board member of the Mountains to Sound Greenway Trust, and was a member of the Seattle Art Museum Executive Board, Downtown Seattle Association, Washington Council on Crime and Delinquency, Denny Regrade Business Association and the Denny Regrade Crime Prevention Council (former president), the National Women&#x27;s Political Caucus of Washington, and Washington State Democratic Party. Prior to her election to the City Council, she served as chairperson to Seattle Mayor Charles Royer&#x27;s Homeless Task Force and vice-chair of Washington Governor Booth Gardner&#x27;s Task Force on Homelessness. More than 16 years ago, Drago organized the city&#x27;s Downtown District Council, the first acknowledgment by City Hall that Downtown Seattle was composed of several residential neighborhoods. Drago was one of the original founders of Sustainable Seattle.

<text>Kings Peak is the highest peak in the U.S. state of Utah,
with an elevation of .

==Description==
Kings Peak is located just south of the spine of the central Uinta Mountains, in the Ashley National Forest in northeastern Utah, in north-central Duchesne County. It lies within the boundaries of the High Uintas Wilderness. The peak is approximately due east of central Salt Lake City, and due north of the town of Duchesne.

There are three popular routes to the summit; a scramble up the east slope, a hike up the northern ridge, and a long but relatively easy hike up the southern slope. The peak was named for Clarence King, a surveyor in the area and the first director of the United States Geological Survey. The easiest route requires a round trip hike.

<doc id="1015656" wikidata="Q7011388" url="?curid=1015656" title="New Sacred Harp">
<text>The New Sacred Harp (or The New Sacred Harp: A Collection of Hymn-tunes, Anthems, and Popular Songs: for the Choir, Class, Convention and Home Circle) was a seven-shape note tune book released in 1884 through S.P. Richard &amp; Son of Atlanta, Georgia.

It was compiled by brothers James Landrum White and Benjamin Franklin White, Jr., the sons of Benjamin Franklin White, the compiler and editor of &quot;The Sacred Harp&quot; song book.

The &quot;New Sacred Harp&quot; was 192 pages long, including rudiments, 206 songs, and an index. The songs of the book tended towards the more &quot;modern&quot; gospel style of Kieffer-Showalter-Vaughan publications (7-shapes, closer subdued harmony, etc.). Yet songs were included by composers of the Sacred Harp tradition, including D. P. White (J. L. White&#x27;s elder brother), J. P. Rees, S. M. Denson, T. J. Denson and Absalom Ogletree.

About a dozen compositions were by J. L. White, though none were written by B. F., Jr. His contributions were apparently only editorial and financial. Fewer than 20% of its songs were found in the &quot;old&quot; &quot;Sacred Harp&quot;, and less than 5% of the songs were written in a minor key. These brothers probably hoped to profit from the name connection to their father&#x27;s popular song book.

<doc id="1015658" wikidata="Q768064" url="?curid=1015658" title="Athena Asamiya">
<text>is a fictional character originally from the former SNK&#x27;s 1987 video game &quot;Psycho Soldier&quot;. An esper, Athena is a descendant of Princess Athena from the earlier &quot;Athena&quot; game. She later appears in &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; series of fighting games as a member of the Psycho Soldier Team alongside her friend Sie Kensou and her teacher Chin Gentsai. While there have been changes to the team, Athena has been consistently playable in the main series. She was also given her own video game &quot;&quot;, which was only released in Japanese regions for the PlayStation in 1999.

Athena was designed with idea of having an appealing main character in &quot;Psycho Soldier&quot;. The use of a character song and multiple outfits resulted in major praise by publications for video games and the character also received generally positive reception.

==Creation and design==

Athena Asamiya is based on the title character from SNK&#x27;s video game &quot;Athena&quot;. Athena has long pink hair and wears a black Japanese school uniform. In order to generate contrast between the two Athenas, &quot;Psycho Soldier&quot;″s was designed to look more mature. In retrospective, character designer Ogura felt Athena&#x27;s marketing as an idol was ahead of its time, citing things such as her songs and anime-like illustrations. The fact that Athena changed outfits in every game felt like something that Ogura believed would appeal to the demographic. 

For &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;94&quot; series, there was pressure within staff about including the character. The staff worked so much on her that other developers accused them of favoritism. Feeling pressure with how Western players would react to her high school look, SNK instead decided to design her wearing a different outfit which is first seen in her character&#x27;s introduction when removing her high school look.

Athena wears new outfits in every game, some with little changes. Her hair, however, is purple and becomes short from &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;99&quot; to &quot;The King of Fighters 2001&quot;, and regardless of her outfit, one item that remains relatively unchanged is the tiara she wears on her hair, with accompanying star-shaped hairpins. The staff from the series has been requested by fans to return her Japanese school uniform in several games, but they only made her wear it only in her introductions as they thought it would not be well received by gamers from other countries. In the &quot;Maximum Impact&quot; series, her normal costume (from &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;98&quot;) as the basis for it, it is piece of &quot;cute clothing that she has per her heart and soul into&quot;. On the other hand, her &quot;Another&quot; is a &quot;school wear&quot; outfit with glasses according to the staff.

However, by &quot;The King of Fighters XI&quot;, Athena appears with a white school uniform and in &quot;The King of Fighters XII&quot; she returns to her original &quot;Psycho Soldier&quot; outfit as the members from SNK wanted to return &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; series to its &quot;original concept&quot;. In &quot;The King of Fighters XIII&quot;, Athena returns wearing the same clothes but with a color alteration (white shirt and blue skirt; more in line with her attire from &quot;The King of Fighters XI&quot;). Eisuke Ogura was given multiple directions by the game staff in how Athena should look such as her facial expressions and limbs. Director Kei Yamamoto explained many of Athena&#x27;s mechanics are based on psychic moves with being one of her most famous ones. Yamamoto explained that the &quot;XIII&quot; staff worked to produce balanced variations of her attacks. Her strongest move in that game, the brought multiple difficulties to the team but in the end SNK were satisfied with the result.
When making &quot;The King of Fighters XIV&quot; with the Unreal Engine, the original game had more realistic visuals but clashed with character models Athena&#x27;s and Kula Diamond&#x27;s models that have been compared with anime-like series so they opted for the current look. The character was redesigned by Keisuke Ogura rather than veteran Nobuyuki Kuroki in order to appeal to newcomers. Sound director Asakana found Athena as character who remained faithful to previous incarnations to the point the staff had fun designing her. According to SNK, Athena&#x27;s appearance from &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;98&quot; remains as the most popular within the fanbase which led to her inclusion in &quot;XIV&quot; as downloadable content.

For the spin-off &quot;SNK Heroines: Tag Team Frenzy&quot;, Athena was given a magical girl-like outfit that would also fit her characterization. Multiple accessories were then added in order to appeal to a young demographic to the point of making her look like a main character. Bracelets were meant to look like morphing accessories on a comical note. Ogura wanted to give her a staff but the idea was rejected by the team. Nevertheless, the main theme of the game was that the cast would wear an outfit they would not like. Yasuyuki Oda stated it was difficult how to perform Athena&#x27;s 3D models and yet making it look like her original 2D model.

Athena has been voiced by several voice actresses since her debut in &quot;Psycho Soldier&quot; in which she was played by Rushina in the game and Kaori Shimizu for her image songs. For &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; series, Athena has been played by several actresses. Reiko Fukui voiced her in &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;94&quot;, Moe Nagasaki in &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;95&quot;, Tamao Satō in &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;96&quot; and Yukina Kurisu in &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;97&quot; and &quot;The King of Fighters: Kyo&quot;. Since &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;98&quot;, Athena has been voiced by Haruna Ikezawa in each game she is featured as well as the anime &quot;The King of Fighters: Another Day&quot; and &quot;The King of Fighters: Destiny&quot;. Lily Kong voiced Athena in the English dub of &quot;The King of Fighters: Maximum Impact 2&quot;.

==Appearances==

===In video games===
Athena first appears in the video game &quot;Psycho Soldier&quot;, fighting against several creatures attacking Earth along with her friend Sie Kensou. She would also appear in the crossover fighting game series &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; as part of the Psycho Soldier Team. The Psycho Soldier Team is initially composed of Kensou and Athena&#x27;s teacher, Chin Gentsai. The team would be present in most King of Fighters tournament as Chin wanted to train more Kensou and Athena as well as searching for evil forces such as the demon Orochi. The team has little changes within tournaments with the only new member joining them being Bao from &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;99&quot; until &quot;The King of Fighters 2001&quot;. &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;99: Evolution&quot; also contains a Striker version from Athena with her school uniform. By &quot;The King of Fighters 2003&quot;, the Psycho Soldier Team retires from competition as Kensou and Bao needed to train their new powers. As such, Athena second another variant of Heroine Fighters Team known as the High School Girls Team along with the Sumo fighter Hinako Shijo, who had been part of the Women Fighters Team in the previous two tournaments, and a mysterious girl named Malin. The Psycho Soldier Team returns in &quot;The King of Fighters XI&quot; with Athena, Kensou and Momoko, a young girl able to use Psychic powers. In &quot;The King of Fighters XII&quot;, Athena is playable, but like each character, she has no official teams, due to its beta state. In sequel, a finalized version of &quot;The King of Fighters XII&quot;, &quot;The King of Fighters XIII&quot;, she is back with Kensou and Chin representing the Psycho Soldiers; she and reappear in &quot;The King of Fighters XIV&quot;. 
 In &quot;The King of Fighters XV&quot;, Athena joins Mai and Yuri to form a new super version of Heroine Fighters Team, as foreshadowed by her conversations with one of the Women Fighters’ team members in two games prior, and most likely an exchange request between her and original Women Fighters leader King, who re-joins Art of Fighting team.

She is also featured in the spin-off games &quot;The King of Fighters: Battle de Paradise&quot;, &quot;The King of Fighters Neowave&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;, and &quot;KOF ALL STARS&quot;. In the &quot;Maximum Impact&quot; series, Athena has a self-proclaimed rival named Mignon Beart whom she does not acknowledge or know her. Athena also appears in the spin-off video games &quot;The King of Fighters R-1&quot; and &quot;The King of Fighters R-2&quot; as part of the Heroine Team with Mai Shiranui and Yuri Sakazaki and in the sequel with Kazumi and Yuri once again. She is also present in the role-playing game &quot;The King of Fighters: Kyo&quot; where she and Kensou travel to Japan to meet Kyo Kusanagi, befriending Kyo&#x27;s girlfriend, Yuki, in the process.

In Masato Natsumoto&#x27;s manga &quot;The King of Fighters: Kyo&quot;, Athena has a crush on Kyo Kusanagi, being also interested in his abilities. She appears in several chapters from the series along with Kensou as they investigate the powers from Iori Yagami.

The CD was published by Happinet and contains various tracks based on Athena&#x27;s character.

==Promotion and reception==
Her character is also featured in various types of merchandising such as figurines from &quot;&quot; and &quot;SNK Beach Volley&quot;. Athena was also featured along with Mai Shiranui as a part of a set of two action figures with both her character being chibi. A key-chain from her character was also released by SNK. Athena was the featured character on a &#x27;Neoprint&#x27; photo printing machine for a while.

Athena Asamiya has received generally positive reception, with authors Brian Ashcraft and Shoko Ueda describing her as &quot;one of the pioneering female video game action stars.&quot; The character of Athena has been popular within gamers, ranking highly on character popularity polls. In the character popularity poll on Neo Geo Freak&#x27;s website in 2000, she was voted as the tenth favorite character with a total of 1,020 votes. In 2018, Athena was voted as the eighth most popular Neo Geo character. Japanese magazine &quot;Gamest&quot; ranked Athena at No. 3 in the list of Top 50 Characters of 1994. Her redesign in &quot;The King of Fighters XII&quot; received mixed reception. Some fans called this incarnation chubby, though &quot;GameSpot&quot; writer Hirohiko Niizumi disagreed.

Author Róisín Lally discussed how Athena Asamiya&#x27;s design and character, which she describes as an &quot;early adolescent child,&quot; contrasts the goddess Athena&#x27;s, as well as the difference between &quot;alive&quot; art and &quot;representational&quot; art. She discussed how Asamiya&#x27;s design is a &quot;snapshot representation of the sexualization of young girls,&quot; and that it &quot;feed(s) the lower part of the intellectual faculty.&quot;

<doc id="1015662" wikidata="Q2915564" url="?curid=1015662" title="Sauron (comics)">
<text>Sauron () is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was created by writer Roy Thomas and artist Neal Adams, and made his first appearance in &quot;The X-Men&quot; #59 (August 1969).

Sauron is the alter ego of physician Dr. Karl Lykos. After being bitten by mutant pterodactyls, Lykos was transformed into an energy vampire, able to absorb the life force of others through touch. If Lykos absorbs the life force of mutants, he transforms into a humanoid &quot;Pteranodon&quot;, gaining increased strength and speed in the process. However, this also causes Sauron to gain control over Lykos. Throughout his history, Sauron has often been depicted as inhabiting the hidden prehistoric jungle of the Savage Land and as an enemy of the X-Men.

Outside of comics, the character has appeared in animated series, video games, merchandise and has been referenced in film. In the cartoons &quot;X-Men&quot; and &quot;Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.&quot;, Karl Lykos / Sauron was voiced by Robert Bockstael and Steve Blum, respectively, and by John Kassir in the action role-playing game video game &quot;X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse&quot;.

==Creation and conception==
The character was created by writer Roy Thomas and artist Neal Adams, though the two differ in their accounts of which of them was responsible for specific aspects of the character. He first fully appeared as Sauron in &quot;X-Men&quot; #60 (September 1969).

Thomas and Adams originally envisioned Sauron as a bat-like creature, but when they consulted with the Comics Code Authority, they were told that an energy vampire with a bat body might fall under the Code&#x27;s prohibition on the use of vampires. To get around this problem, Thomas and Adams tweaked his appearance to that of the most bat-like animal they could think of—a pterodactyl—which in turn led them to have Sauron inhabit the hidden prehistoric jungle of the Savage Land.

==Fictional character biography==
===Early life===
Karl Lykos was the son of an explorer&#x27;s guide. As a teenager, he accompanied his father to Tierra del Fuego as the elder Lykos guided a wealthy client named Mr. Anderssen and Anderssen&#x27;s young daughter, Tanya. While defending Tanya from mutant pterodactyls, Karl was bitten by one of the creatures. During his recovery, he discovered that he could now drain the life-force of other organisms. He found himself repeatedly tempted to use his new power, feeling that he needed to drain life energy from other humans or animals to survive.

When Karl&#x27;s father died, Mr. Anderssen took Karl into his home in thanks for rescuing Tanya. As the years passed, Karl and Tanya fell in love, but Tanya&#x27;s wealthy father would not allow her to date Karl because of his lack of wealth. In an effort to win Mr. Anderssen&#x27;s support, Karl went to medical school and became a physician, geneticist, and hypnotherapist. He treated patients through hypnosis, but secretly robbed them of energy at the same time.

===First transformation into Sauron and life in the Savage Land===
Dr. Lykos became a colleague of Professor Charles Xavier, and first encountered the X-Men when they sought treatment for Havok. Absorbing Havok&#x27;s mutant energy transformed him into a vampiric, pterodactyl-like monster with human intelligence and superhuman hypnotic powers. He named himself Sauron, after J.R.R. Tolkien&#x27;s villain (also reminiscent of the word &quot;saurus&quot;, Latin for lizard), and battled the X-Men, as a would-be conqueror. When he realized that his transformation would threaten Tanya, he fled to Tierra del Fuego. Without energy to absorb, Sauron turned back into Karl. When Tanya tracked him down, Karl threw himself off a cliff to avoid harming her.

Karl was presumed dead, but had survived unconscious on a ledge below. He journeyed to the Savage Land and survived in human form by only draining less developed animals. He befriended Ka-Zar and used his medical skills over many months to care for Ka-Zar&#x27;s allies. But when several X-Men were stranded in the Savage Land, Lykos was overwhelmed with the desire to absorb mutant energy. He transformed into Sauron once again after absorbing Storm&#x27;s energy. He reverted to human form during a battle with the X-Men, and Ka-Zar explained that Lykos was an ally.

Tanya learned that Karl had survived the leap from the cliff. She joined Angel and Peter Parker on a journey to find Karl in the Savage Land. They found Karl, however the Savage Land Mutates used a Genetic Transformer to mutate Angel, Spider-Man and Tanya into animal-like forms. The destruction of the machine forced Lykos to drain energy from the three in an attempt to restore their true forms. Although his gambit succeeded, he subsequently reverted to his Sauron form and joined the Mutates and Zaladane. The X-Men traveled to the Savage Land, and Sauron helped to capture them. However, the X-Men escaped and defeated Sauron and the Mutates. They brought Lykos back to the United States, and at the X-Mansion Professor X seemingly cured Lykos of his condition. Karl and Tanya decided to resume their relationship and a normal life.

===Second transformation into Sauron===
Lykos was again transformed into Sauron when the Toad used a device of his own design to force Lykos to drain the life energy of Tanya, which killed her in the process. Sauron then joined the Toad&#x27;s Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, despite not being a mutant. Alongside them, he battled X-Force, and killed Cannonball. Sauron was apparently shot dead by Cable, and his body was thrown by Cable to the Morlocks. Sauron was later revealed to have survived the gunshot wound, and battled X-Factor. Sauron went on to menace the X-Men and other heroes on a number of occasions.

Later, Sauron had the Savage Land Mutates kidnap Havok, hoping to use his energy to satiate his hunger. When his teammates Cyclops, Phoenix, and Polaris came to the rescue, Sauron had both Summers brothers placed in an energy-transferring machine, and the mix of energy mutated Sauron even further, making him larger and stronger than ever. Phoenix tried to engage Sauron on the Astral Plane, but it was Lykos&#x27; personality who prevailed, making a suicide leap into the abyss of his own mind, taking his hated alter ego with him. As a result, Sauron&#x27;s mind appeared to be stuck in an animalistic state.

Sauron became a prisoner of the Weapon X program jumpstarted by director Malcolm Colcord. Being held there against his will, Sauron started up a revolution with fellow agent Brent Jackson and dethroned Colcord as director, giving that position to Jackson. Sauron in return became a more powerful villain on the team, but vanished after Weapon X rival John Sublime launched an attack on Weapon X, and the group had to go underground.

After being imprisoned in the Raft for refusing to participate in any more Weapon X assignments, Sauron escaped during a jailbreak concocted by the Skrulls. For a time the Avengers believed he and the Mutates were responsible for the breakout, and pursued him to the Savage Land. Sauron and his allies there briefly held the new team of Avengers hostage, but the team freed itself thanks to Iron Man&#x27;s voice-activated armor, and were about to interrogate him, when he was shot through the head by the second Black Widow. Sauron had absorbed Wolverine&#x27;s regenerative healing factor and recovered from his injury, just in time to be soundly defeated by the New Avengers. He was taken back into custody, but not before returning the favor to Black Widow by burning her with his fiery breath. Sauron was placed in S.H.I.E.L.D. custody and Maria Hill planned to return him to Weapon X.

Sauron allied with Ka-Zar, Shanna the She-Devil, Zabu, and the natives when the Skrulls were invading the Savage Land. Sauron was among the villains analyzed by Quasimodo for Norman Osborn. Sauron later had a fight with Wolverine.

Amphibius later tells Sauron and the other Savage Land Mutates that Magneto&#x27;s Asteroid M has risen from the sea, but they did not want to go find him. Worm took control of Barbarus, Lupo, and Sauron and commandeered a ship to go find Magneto. When threatened by the Japanese military, Sauron attacked an armored car, causing an international incident. Cannonball, Sunspot and Warlock investigated and found the Savage Land Mutates on the deck of the ship. Cannonball managed to defeat Sauron while the other New Mutants defeated the Savage Land Mutates. Upon learning why the Savage Land Mutates were on the ship, Karma told Worm, Sauron, Barbarus and Lupo that they were in charge of Asteroid M and Magneto. Worm then orders the Savage Land Mutates to return to the Savage Land.

Upon becoming the new leader of the Japanese underworld, Sabretooth held a party that Sauron attended with other enemies of Wolverine. Wolverine arrived and beat them up.

Kade Kilgore of the seventh incarnation of the Hellfire Club recruited Sauron to become a staff member at the Hellfire Academy.

Sauron later collaborates with Stegron in a plan to turn humanity into dinosaurs, battling Spider-Man and the mutant students from the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning. The duo&#x27;s plans are unraveled by their own infighting, purposely exacerbated by their shared attraction to Shark-Girl, who caused their powers to neutralize each other.

Lykos returns to working in a military laboratory to enhance his powers, until one of his colleagues is contacted by the Scarlet Spider. Now able to store mutant energy to trigger his transformations at will, Lykos turns into Sauron and attacks the vigilante, but although he wounds the man the Spider came to the base to collect, Sauron is defeated and webbed up to be taken away.

==Powers and abilities==
In human form, Karl Lykos is a normal human, although an accomplished medical doctor, geneticist, and psychotherapist. He employs hypnotism in his practice. He possesses an M.D. and Ph.D. in genetics and psychology.

After being infected with a genetic virus by mutant Pteranodons, Lykos gained the ability to absorb the life forces of other beings, enabling him to transform into a &quot;Pteranodon&quot; hybrid and replicate superpowers. In &quot;Spider-Man and the X-Men&quot;, Sauron demonstrated the ability to transfer his life-absorption power to others via bite. By the time he confronts the Scarlet Spider, Lykos has developed his powers to the point where he can store mutant energy to transform on his own.

Sauron additionally possesses fire breath, hypnosis via eye contact, and the ability to expel concussive energy bursts from his hands.

<doc id="1015666" wikidata="Q278306" url="?curid=1015666" title="Baugur Group">
<text>Baugur Group (; Icelandic: ) was an Icelandic investment company. The group began as a supermarket and general retail company in Iceland, before diversifying to own a number of businesses at its peak, primarily in the United Kingdom.

Baugur was heavily affected by the Icelandic financial crisis that began in 2008, and applied for bankruptcy protection in February 2009. Its largest creditor Landsbanki applied to place Baugur&#x27;s UK arm, BG Holdings, into administration that month. The group filed for bankruptcy in March 2009.

== History ==
In 1989, the Baugur Group was started by the opening of a single &#x27;Bónus&#x27; supermarket in Reykjavík by Jón Ásgeir Jóhannesson and his father, Jóhannes Jónsson. The company grew quickly and within three years was operating several supermarkets in Iceland. In 1992, Hagkaup, the leading domestic retailer, acquired 50% of shares in Bonus. In 1993, they merged and formed a joint purchasing company named Baugur.

Hagkaup was established over 50 years ago and, as a retailing pioneer, opened both supermarkets and department stores in Iceland. Hagkaup and Bonus merged as Baugur in 1998 and Jón Ásgeir Jóhannesson became the company&#x27;s President and CEO. Baugur was listed on Iceland Stock Exchange the same year.

In 1999, Baugur signed franchise agreements with the Arcadia Group and Debenhams for Scandinavia and today Hagar, (formerly Baugur-Iceland) runs several Topshop and Miss Selfridge stores in Iceland and Sweden as well as three Debenhams stores.

=== Baugur changes to Baugur Group ===
In 2002, proposals were approved concerning a change in the name of Baugur hf. to Baugur Group hf. and changes to the company&#x27;s organizational structure.

Baugur hf. was divided into three independent profit centres: Baugur-Iceland, Bonus Stores Inc., and Baugur-ID. Baugur hf. changed its name to Baugur Group hf. and became a holding company.

=== Baugur Group delisted from ICEX ===
In May 2003, a redemption offer worth 10.85 Icelandic krónur (£0.09) was made by Mundur, for the outstanding stock—Mundur holding company is backed by Gaumur, KB Banki, an Icelandic investment bank; and two private investors—and in July 2003, Baugur Group was delisted from the Iceland Stock Exchange.

The year 2003 was a milestone in Baugur Group&#x27;s foreign operations. At the beginning of the year, Baugur Group held shares in a few listed companies in Britain, whereas, at the end of the year, it was the most internationally extensive Icelandic company.

Briefly, it can be said that Baugur Group&#x27;s investment activities in Britain can be split into two categories. On one hand, Baugur Group continued to invest in listed companies that are regarded to have better futures, either because their current management is in the process of improving the company&#x27;s operation, or because new shareholders are expected to step in to instigate improvement. Among the companies, which Baugur Group has invested in on these premises are the Big Food Group, House of Fraser, and Somerfield.

On the other hand, Baugur Group has formed a strategy to take part in management takeovers. These companies control strong brand names and are considered to have substantial opportunities for growth, show a net profit, and management has shown and proven its ability to succeed. During the year 2003, Baugur Group acquired three such companies: Hamleys, Oasis, and Julian Graves.

In May 2004, Baugur Group, along with other investors, acquired the majority in the British jewellery chain Goldsmiths, in cooperation with the company&#x27;s management, for the amount of ISK 14.4 billion. Goldsmiths, which was established in Newcastle upon Tyne in the year 1778, operates 165 jewellery stores in Britain and is the second largest in the country in its sector.

In June 2004, the founders of Karen Millen agreed to sell the business to the Oasis Group (controlled by Baugur Group) in a deal valued at £120 million, creating a leading womenswear retailer with four strong brands—Oasis, Coast, Karen Millen, and Whistles; creating a group with over £350 million in sales in 550 stores.

Oasis is aimed at independent, fashion-conscious 18- to 30-year-old women and operates from 281 outlets across 14 countries, including the Republic of Ireland, the UK and France; Coast is a destination brand for women&#x27;s special occasion clothes with 135 outlets; Karen Millen has a niche position away from the mass market, bordering on the designer brands; and Whistles has more-grown-up styling and quirkier taste than the rest of the high street. Later, the Oasis Group changed its name to Mosaic, listed on the ICEX.

=== Accounting irregularities ===
In 2002 Baugur&#x27;s headquarters were the subject of a police raid. In July 2005 company founders Jón Ásgeir Jóhannesson and Jóhannes Jónsson were charged on 40 counts including tax and accounting irregularities, fraud and embezzlement. Jón Ásgeir Jóhannesson has accused the then prime minister, Davíð Oddsson of orchestrating a vendetta against him. The case became known in Icelandic as the &#x27;Baugsmálið&#x27; (&#x27;Baugur case&#x27;).

On 3 May 2007, Jón Ásgeir was found guilty on a single charge of a breach of book-keeping rules, with the conviction being upheld on appeal on 6 June 2008. Jón Ásgeir was given a 3-month suspended prison sentence. It also left his position as chairman uncertain under Icelandic law because the conviction meant that he could not serve on any company board for 3 years. As a consequence of this, and the fact that much of Baugur&#x27;s portfolio was now based in the UK, in July 2008 Baugur considered relocating to the UK, where Jón Ásgeir could keep his board position.

=== Demise and collapse ===

It emerged in October 2008 that BDO Stoy Hayward was advising Baugur on restructuring and that Philip Green, the owner of Bhs and the Arcadia Group had travelled to Iceland for negotiations regarding him making an investment in Baugur, amid reports the group was on the brink of collapse

On 4 February 2009, Baugur applied for protection from its creditors after restructuring negotiations with Landsbanki broke down. The bank also applied for Baugur&#x27;s UK arm to be put into administration.

== Ownership and links to Russia ==
In December 2002 &quot;Gaumur Holding&quot; acquired a 30.97% stake in Baugur Group.

Luxembourg-registered Gaumur Holding was originally &quot;Compagnie Financiere pour l&#x27;Atlantique du Nord&quot;. The company was registered on 22 June 1998. In March 2000 changed its name to &quot;Gaumur Holding&quot;.

Official records show that Gaumur Group had three shareholders:
* &quot;Starbook International Limited&quot; (P.O. Box 3186 Road Town, Tortola, British Virgin Islands)
* &quot;Waverton Group Limited&quot; (P.O. Box 3186 Road Town, Tortola, British Virgin Islands)
* &quot;Birefield Holdings Limited&quot; (P.O. Box 3186 Road Town, Tortola, British Virgin Islands)

In 2005 Danish media reported that behind Starbook, Waverton and Birefield is Shapburg Limited (registered in the same mailbox 3186) and Quenon Investments Limited (registered in the same mailbox 3186). It was discovered that:
* Both companies owned a stake in Baugur Group.
* Both companies owned a stake in the Luxembourg-registered &quot;Compagnie Financiere Scandinave&quot;. A month after incorporation it was renamed the &quot;Scandinavian Holding&quot; and later &quot;Meidur S.A.&quot; (later Exista).
* Both companies owned a stake in &quot;Alrosa Finance&quot; in Luxembourg. Another shareholder was Russian state-owned diamond company ALROSA.
* Shapburg Limited owned a stake in &quot;Alfa Finance Holdings&quot;. Another shareholder was Alfa-Bank of Russia.

Icelandic businessmen Björgólfur Thor Björgólfsson, Björgólfur Guðmundsson and Magnús Þorsteinsson all came to London from Saint Petersburg, Russia where they did business in the beverage sector together.

<text>Jim Compton (April 2, 1941 – March 17, 2014) was a member of the Seattle City Council, first elected in 1999. He announced his resignation in December 2005 to teach at American University in Cairo as well as Romania.

==Early life and education==

Born in Klamath Falls, Oregon, Compton earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree in history at Reed College in 1964 and his master&#x27;s degree at the Columbia University School of Journalism in 1969. 

He was a Fulbright Scholar and studied in Romania between 1969 and 1970. His studies focused on Romanian political dissidents, which included interviewing Romanian writers, artists, and filmmakers about their work and how they define Romanian identity.

==Journalism career==

Compton started his journalism career in 1964 as a radio reporter for KGW-AM in Portland. Compton then went to Italy as an assistant managing editor for the Rome Daily American. He would interview significant world figures such as Anwar Sadat, Moammar Gadhafi, Orson Welles and Jimmy Carter. 

In 1984, he joined KING-TV and produced dozens of docuseries, which would garner him the duPont-Columbia Silver Baton and the National Janus Award. In 1987, Compton would host &quot;The Compton Report&quot; which would run for ten years. He also served as a correspondent for &quot;The News Hour with Jim Lehrer&quot;. 

==Seattle City Council (1999-2006)==

In 1999, Seattle city council member Martha Choe decided to resign her seat to become the Washington State Department of Community, Trade and Economic Development Director. Compton joined the race to replace Choe, with his primary opponent being WA state representative Dawn Mason. Compton would defeat Mason in the General Election 57% to 43%.

During his time in office, he chaired the Public Safety and Technology Committee, the Utilities &amp; Technology Committee, the Energy &amp; Environmental Policy Committee vice chair, and a Government Affairs &amp; Labor Committee member. While in office, Compton was one of the councilmembers who blocked the reconfirmation of Seattle City Light director Gary Zacker. Compton accused Zacker of being unresponsive to City Light audits. 

In 2003, Compton ran for reelection and his primary challenger was former city council member and police Sergeant John Manning. In the general election, Compton defeated Manning 56% to 44%.

In December 2005, Compton announced that he planned to resign from the city council effective January 6 to teach in Egypt and Romania. The city council appointed Sally J. Clark to fill Compton&#x27;s seat for the remainder of the term.

==Controversies==

===Strippergate===
Former Washington state governor Albert Rosellini assisted the Colacurcios family by lobbying six members of the Seattle City Council and raising funds for three of the politicians. In June 2003, James Bush, a reporter for the North Seattle Sun, reported city council members Judy Nicastro, Jim Compton and Heidi Wills received large amounts of campaign donations from the Colacurcio family and their business associates. On June 16, 2003, in a 5–4 vote, the council approved the parking zoning changes, allowing them to use their existing land for parking requested by the Colacurcios.[10] Nicastro, Compton, and Wills would all vote in favor of the expansion.

The Seattle Ethics and Elections Commission investigated the claims, and all the council members returned their donations.

===Paul Allen&#x27;s private jet===
Compton agreed to a $3,000 settlement with Seattle Ethics and Elections Commission after it was revealed that Compton took a trip on a private jet owned by Paul Allen and also received tickets to Portland Trail Blazers games.

==Personal life==

Compton was married to Seattle lawyer Carol Arnold and had two stepchildren.

In March 2014, Compton was found dead of an apparent heart attack in his car after having dinner with friends the previous night. He was 72.

<doc id="1015671" wikidata="Q881041" url="?curid=1015671" title="Blade of the Immortal">
<text>is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Hiroaki Samura. It was serialized in Kodansha&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Monthly Afternoon&quot; from June 1993 to December 2012, with its chapters collected in 30 volumes. The series is set in Japan during the mid-Tokugawa Shogunate period and follows the cursed samurai Manji, who has to kill 1,000 evil men in order to regain his mortality.

A 2008 anime television series adaptation was produced by Bee Train. Also in 2008, the novel &quot;Blade of the Immortal: Legend of the Sword Demon&quot; was released by Kodansha. A live action film adaptation of the same name was released in April 2017. A second anime adaptation by Liden Films was broadcast from October 2019 to March 2020. In North America, the manga has been published by Dark Horse Comics. The first anime series was licensed by Media Blasters. The second anime series is licensed by Amazon Prime Video.

By May 2019, the manga had over 7.5 million copies in circulation. In 1997, &quot;Blade of the Immortal&quot; received the Excellence Award at the first Japan Media Arts Festival.

==Plot==

&quot;Blade of the Immortal&quot; follows the deeds of Manji, a skilled who has a decisive advantage: no wound can kill him, except for a rare poison. In the past, his criminal actions led to the death of 100 other samurai (including his sister&#x27;s husband). He becomes immortal at the hand of an 800-year-old nun named Yaobikuni, and is compelled by the death of his sister to accept the quest that will end his agelessness. He has vowed to make amends by killing 1,000 evil men, and until he does Manji will be kept alive by , remarkable creatures that allow him to survive nearly any injury and reattach severed limbs even after hours of separation. They work by sacrificing themselves to seal the wound—they are worms that were bred to be as close in chemical and physical make-up to humans as possible without actually being human. They cannot handle regrowth on a large scale, but, for example, can reattach a severed limb or seal a hole in the brain.

Manji crosses paths with a young girl named Rin Asano and promises to help her avenge her parents, who were killed by a cadre of master swordsmen led by Anotsu Kagehisa. Anotsu killed Rin&#x27;s father and his entire dojo, making them a family of outcasts. Anotsu&#x27;s quest is to gather other outcasts and form an extremely powerful new dojo, the Ittō-ryū (a school teaching any technique that wins, no matter how exotic or underhanded), and has started taking over and destroying other dojos.

In addition, another group calling itself the Mugai-ryū has emerged, in opposition to the Ittō-ryū. Its true leadership and motives are initially a mystery, but its methods (any tactics that lead to victory) resemble those of the Ittō-ryū. They try to enlist Manji&#x27;s help as they seem to want the same thing. Eventually, Manji joins but quickly pulls out after he finds out a member, Shira, is far too sadistic for his tastes. After a while, Manji finally discovers that the Mugai-ryū works for the government. They are all death row inmates who are allowed to live only if they serve the shogunate. While Manji and Shira quickly grow to hate each other, after Shira runs off, Manji remains on friendly terms with the other members of the group.

==Creation and conception==
Samura stated that &quot;Tange Sazen&quot; was the largest influence on his characters and narrative style. In regards to the overall work he stated that he wanted to create a new style of manga, with his intended style being &quot;Don&#x27;t obsess about the details—just look at the story.&quot;

==Media==
===Manga===

Written and illustrated by Hiroaki Samura, &quot;Blade of the Immortal&quot; started in Kodansha&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Monthly Afternoon&quot; on June 25, 1993, and finished on December 25, 2012. Kodansha collected its 207 chapters in 30 volumes, released from September 22, 1994, to February 22, 2013. A 15-volume edition was released from August 23, 2016, to February 23, 2017.

A sequel, titled , written by Kenji Takigawa and illustrated by Ryū Suenobu, with Samura&#x27;s collaboration, was serialized in &quot;Monthly Afternoon&quot; from May 25, 2019, to May 24, 2024. Kodansha collected its chapters in ten volumes, released from October 23, 2019, to August 22, 2024.

====Dark Horse Comics release====

The English language version of the manga was published by Dark Horse Comics. The manga began its publication in individual monthly issues, with the first issue being published on June 1, 1996. These issues were later collected into individual volumes, and the first one was published on March 1, 1997. On October 11, 2007, Dark Horse Comics announced that they would drop the monthly issues publishing, with issue #131, released on November 14, 2007, being the last one. The series continued publishing through trade paperback volumes only, starting with the 18th volume, released on February 6, 2008. The 31st and last collected volume was published on April 1, 2015.

To preserve the integrity of his art, Samura requested the publisher Dark Horse Comics not to &quot;flip&quot; the manga, that is, reverse the pages as if in a mirror. At the time, flipping was an almost universal practice for English-translated manga. Instead, &quot;Blade of the Immortal&quot; was modified for Western readers by the unusual method of cutting up the panels and rearranging them on the page in order to have the action flow from left to right. Another reason for not &quot;flipping&quot; the English version is Manji&#x27;s clothing, which features a symbol, that if the pages were &quot;flipped&quot; would resemble specifically the Nazi swastika, instead of the ancient Eurasian swastika (that can be of any orientation), which for many cultures represents concepts such as peace and harmony.

Although American industry practice has largely changed over to publishing translated manga in its original right-to-left orientation, &quot;Blade of the Immortal&quot; had retained the labor-intensive cut-and-paste method. The publisher cautions that rearranging the panels is not foolproof, and can lead to continuity errors; this usually occurs when the flow of text bubbles is dependent upon character placement within panels. Some sound effects within the panel were retouched out and re-lettered in English. Japanese sound effects that are an integral part of the artwork were usually left as is. Additionally, some text bubbles or panel borders were redrawn, and script pacing subtly altered in order to understand the story or the placement of text bubbles.

In the monthly Dark Horse serialization, colored versions of title pages from the corresponding manga chapter were often featured as cover art, though in some cases different pieces of artwork, such as a covers, were used as well. The original Japanese volumes also collected more chapters than the English volumes published by Dark Horse, as such, they are longer and do not directly correspond to the English numbering scheme.

In July 2015, Dark Horse Comics announced an omnibus edition of &quot;Blade of the Immortal&quot;, each volume containing three original volumes, maintaining the left-to-right format. Ten volumes were released from December 28, 2016, to November 13, 2019. In March 2020, Dark Horse announced a deluxe re-release of the omnibus edition in hardcover. The volumes were released from October 7, 2020, to October 18, 2023.

===Novel===
A novel, titled , written by Junichi Ohsako, with illustrations by Samura, was released by Kodansha on July 18, 2008. In North America, the novel was published by Dark Horse Books on January 27, 2010.

===Anime===

On March 23, 2008, it was announced that an animated television series adaptation of the manga would be directed by Kōichi Mashimo and produced by Bee Train in 2008. The series aired from July 13 to December 28, 2008, on AT-X. The opening theme is by Makura no Sōshi, and the closing theme is &quot;Wants&quot; by Grapevine. In North America, Media Blasters licensed the series and released it on September 29, 2009.

A second anime adaptation titled was listed on the cover of the July issue of &quot;Monthly Afternoon&quot; on May 10, 2019. It was later announced that the anime adaptation would be a complete adaptation. The series is animated by Liden Films and directed by Hiroshi Hamasaki, with Makoto Fukami handling series composition, Shingo Ogiso designing the characters, and Eiko Ishibashi composing the music. It aired from October 10, 2019, to March 25, 2020 on Amazon Prime Video. Kiyoharu performed the series&#x27; opening theme song &quot;Survive of Vision&quot;. On October 15, 2020, Sentai Filmworks announced that they had licensed the anime for home video and released it on Blu-ray Disc on January 19, 2021.

===Film===

In 2017, the manga was adapted into a live action film, directed by Takashi Miike with the screenplay by Tetsuya Oishi and starring Takuya Kimura as Manji.

==Reception==
By February 2017, the manga had five million copies in circulation. By May 2019, it had over 7.5 million copies in circulation.

&quot;Blade of the Immortal&quot; won the Excellence Prize at the first Japan Media Arts Festival in 1997; and the Will Eisner Comic Industry Award in 2000 for Best U.S. Edition of Foreign Material.

Manga authors Masashi Kishimoto and Tatsuki Fujimoto have mentioned the series as an influence on their works.

<text>Laura Elizabeth Howe Richards (February 27, 1850 – January 14, 1943) was an American writer. She wrote more than 90 books including biographies, poetry, and several for children. One well-known children&#x27;s poem is her literary nonsense verse Eletelephony.

==Biography==
Laura Elizabeth Howe was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on February 27, 1850. Her father was Dr. Samuel Gridley Howe, an abolitionist and the founder of the Perkins Institution and Massachusetts School for the Blind. She was named after his famous deaf-blind pupil Laura Bridgman. Her mother Julia Ward Howe wrote the words to &quot;The Battle Hymn of the Republic&quot;.

In 1871, Laura married Henry Richards. He would accept a management position in 1876 at his family&#x27;s paper mill at Gardiner, Maine, where the couple moved with their three children. In 1917 Laura won a Pulitzer Prize for &quot;Julia Ward Howe, 1819-1910&quot;, a biography, which she co-authored with her sisters, Maud Howe Elliott and Florence Hall.

She died on January 14, 1943, at Gardiner, Maine, 44 days before her 93rd birthday.

==Legacy==

A pre-kindergarten-to-fifth-grade elementary school in Gardiner, Maine, bears her name. Her children&#x27;s book &quot;Tirra Lirra&quot; won the Lewis Carroll Shelf Award in 1959. Her home in Gardiner, the Laura E. Richards House, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<doc id="1015681" wikidata="Q478181" url="?curid=1015681" title="Fort Santiago">
<text>Fort Santiago (; ), built in 1571, is a citadel or castle built by Spanish navigator and governor Miguel López de Legazpi for the newly established city of Manila in the Philippines. The defense fortress is located in Intramuros, the walled city of Manila.

The fort is one of the most important historical sites in Manila. Several people died in its prisons during the Spanish Empire and World War II. José Rizal, the Philippine national hero, was imprisoned here before his execution in 1896. The Rizal Shrine museum displays memorabilia of the hero in their collection and the fort features, embedded onto the ground in bronze, his footsteps representing his final walk from his cell to the location of the actual execution.

It is only a few meters away from the Manila Cathedral and the &quot;Palacio del Gobernador&quot; (lit. &quot;Governor&#x27;s Palace&quot;, currently the office of the Commission on Elections).

==Profile==

The fort was named after Saint James (&quot;Santiago&quot; in Spanish), the patron saint of Spain, who is also known as Saint James the Muslim-slayer because of the legend that he miraculously appeared hundreds of years after his death to fight in the battle of Clavijo, whose relief adorns the façade of the front gate. It is located at the mouth of the Pasig River and served as the premier defense fortress of the Spanish Government during their rule of the country. It became a main fort for the spice trade to the Americas and Europe for 333 years. The Manila Galleon trade to Acapulco, Mexico began from the Fuerte de Santiago.

The fort has a perimeter of , and it is of a nearly triangular form. The south front, which looks toward the city, is a curtain with a terreplein, flanked by two demi-bastions - the &quot;Bastion of San Fernando&quot;, on the riverside, and the &quot;Bastion of San Miguel&quot;, by the bayside. A moat connected with the river separates the fort from the city. Near the beginning of the north face, instead of a bastion, a cavalier called &quot;Santa Barbara&quot; was built with three faces of batteries, one looking seaward over the anchorage place, one facing the entrance, and the third looking upon the river. The latter is united with a tower of the same height as the walls, through which there is a descent to the water battery placed upon a semicircular platform, thus completing the triangular form of the fort.

The high walls, with a thickness of are pierced for the necessary communications. The front gateway façade measures high being in the south wall and facing the city. The communication with the river and the sea was by an obscure postern gate - the &quot;Postigo de la Nuestra Señora del Soledad&quot; (Postern of Our Lady of Solitude). Inside the fort were guard stations, together with the barracks of the troops of the garrison and quarters of the warden and his subalterns. Also inside the fort were various storehouses, a chapel, the powder magazine, the sentry towers, the cisterns, etc.

==History==

The location of Fort Santiago was once the site of a palisaded fort, armed with bronze guns, of Rajah Matanda, a Muslim Tagalog rajah of pre-Hispanic Manila who himself was a vassal to the Sultan of Brunei. The fort was destroyed by &quot;maestre de campo&quot; (master-of-camp) Martin de Goiti who, upon arriving in 1570 from Cebu, fought several battles with the Muslim natives. The Spaniards started building Fort Santiago (&quot;Fuerte de Santiago&quot;) after the establishment of the city of Manila under Spanish rule on June 24, 1571, and made Manila the capital of the newly colonized islands.

The first fort was a structure of palm logs and earth. Most of it was destroyed when the city was invaded by Chinese pirates led by Limahong. Martin de Goiti was killed during the siege. After a fierce conflict, the Spaniards under the leadership of Juan de Salcedo, eventually drove the pirates out to Pangasinan province to the north, and eventually out of the country.
The construction of Fort Santiago with hard stone, together with the original fortified walls of Intramuros, commenced in 1590 and finished in 1593 during the term of Governor-General Gómez Pérez Dasmariñas. The stones used were volcanic tuff quarried from Guadalupe (now Guadalupe Viejo in Makati). The fort as Dasmariñas left it consisted of a castellated structure without towers, trapezoidal in trace, its straight gray front projecting into the river mouth. Arches supported an open gun platform above, named the battery of Santa Barbara, the patron saint of all good artillerymen. These arches formed casemates which afforded a lower tier of fire through embrasures. Curtain walls of simplest character, without counter forts or interior buttresses, extended the flanks to a fourth front facing the city. In 1714, the ornate gate of Fort Santiago was erected together with some military barracks. The Luzon earthquakes of 1880, which destroyed much of the city of Manila, destroyed the front edifice of the fort changing its character. The years: 1636, 1654, 1670, and 1672; saw the deployment of 22, 50, 86, and 81 Latin-American soldiers from Mexico at Fort Santiago.

During the leadership of Fernándo Valdés y Tamon in the 1730s, a large semicircular gun platform to the front called &quot;media naranja&quot; (half orange) and another of lesser dimensions to the river flank were added to the Bastion of Santa Barbara. The casemates were then filled in and embrasures closed. He also changed the curtain wall facing cityward to a bastioned front. A lower parapet, bordering the interior moat, connects the two bastions.

===British occupation===
On September 24, 1762, British forces led by Brigadier-General William Draper and Rear-Admiral Samuel Cornish invaded and captured Manila, and along with it Fort Santiago. It was during this time that the fort served as a base of operations for the Royal Navy until April 1764 when they agreed to a ceasefire with the Spanish.

===American colonial period===

On August 13, 1898, the American flag was raised in Fort Santiago signifying the start of the American rule in the Philippines. The fort served as the headquarters for the U.S. Army and several changes were made to the fort by the Americans. One of these changes included the draining of the moats surrounding the fort. The grounds were then transformed into a golf course.

===World War II===
During World War II, Fort Santiago was captured by the Japanese Imperial Army, and used its prisons and dungeons including the storage cells and gunpowder magazines for hundreds of prisoners who were killed near the end of the war (see Manila massacre). The fort sustained heavy damage from American and Filipino military mortar shells during the Battle of Manila in February 1945. Also, approximately 600 American prisoners of war died of suffocation or hunger after being held in extremely tight quarters in the dungeons at Fort Santiago.

==The fort today==
Today, the fort, its bastions, and the prison dungeons for criminals used by the Spanish officials, is now part of a historical park which also includes Plaza Moriones and several ruins. The park houses well-preserved legacies from the Spanish colonial period including memorabilia of José Rizal at the Rizal Shrine, a replica of his ancestral house in Laguna province.

Adaptive use of this famous historical landmark makes certain areas ideal for open air theater, picnics, and as a promenade. The Intramuros visitors center gives an overview of the various attractions in the walled city.

===Preservation===
After its destruction during WWII, Fort Santiago was declared as a &quot;Shrine of Freedom&quot; in 1950. Its restoration by the Philippine government did not begin till 1953 under the hands of the National Parks Development Committee. The Intramuros Administration now manages the reconstruction, maintenance, and management of the fort since 1992.

<text>Brian David Mason (born October 12, 1953) is a Canadian politician who was leader of the Alberta New Democratic Party from 2004 to 2014 and served the Minister of Transportation in Rachel Notley&#x27;s NDP government. He also served as the Government House Leader. Mason was first elected as a Member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta for the now-defunct riding of Edmonton Highlands in a 2000 byelection. He was subsequently re-elected, and was elected in Edmonton-Highlands-Norwood after the riding was created in 2004. He chose not to seek re-election in 2019, and was succeeded by Janis Irwin. Mason was the longest serving NDP MLA in Alberta history, with a political career spanning more than 20 years.

==Early political involvement==
Mason was born in Calgary in 1953, the son of Robert George Mason, an electrical engineer, and a Red Tory who was a founding member of the Reform Party of Canada. Robert Mason, was also the stepson of Conservative Senator John Alexander Buchanan. Mason&#x27;s mother, Patricia Kavanagh was a Liberal.

Mason first became politically active in the mid-1970s while studying political science at the University of Alberta. He served as executive director of the Federation of Alberta Students from 1977 to 1979. While there he boarded at the traditionally Tory fraternity Phi Gamma Delta and was roommates with future Progressive Conservative Premier Dave Hancock, who teased him by calling him a communist. Upon leaving university Mason began working as bus driver with the Edmonton Transit Service.

==Municipal politics==
Mason first ran for Edmonton city council after he was temporarily laid off from ETS in 1983, before becoming president of the Edmonton Voters Association, a municipal political party. He tried again for a seat on the council in 1989 with a dynamic campaign running in Ward 3. Mason&#x27;s campaign came with a legal challenge he mounted against a provincial law forbidding municipal employees from running as candidates in a civic election unless they resigned their position with the city.

The legal challenge was unsuccessful, however Mason was elected city councillor for Ward 3 in October 1989. Shortly after the election the law Mason challenged was repealed, and municipal workers in Edmonton were subsequently allowed to run for civic office without resigning their positions. Mason remained on city council until 2000, when he ran for political office for the New Democratic Party.

==Provincial politics==
In 2000, following the mid-term resignation of then leader of the Alberta New Democrats and MLA for Edmonton Highlands Pam Barrett, Mason left city council and ran for the NDP in the ensuing by-election. He held the Legislative Assembly seat with a strong majority, and was re-elected in the 2001 provincial election.

=== Alberta NDP Leader ===
Mason was appointed the role of interim party leader for the NDP following the resignation of then leader Raj Pannu in July 2004. He became the official leader of Alberta&#x27;s NDP on September 18, 2004, following a vote at the party convention.

Mason held his seat during the provincial election in 2004, which saw the caucus welcome the return of former leaders Pannu and Ray Martin, along with newcomer David Eggen. In the provincial election of 2008 Mason again retained his seat, and was joined in caucus by newly elected NDP MLA Rachel Notley from Edmonton-Strathcona, the seat previously held by Pannu.

In the 2012 provincial election the NDP picked up two seats in Edmonton, regaining their previous four seat total. Both Notley and Mason safely held onto their seats while David Eggen was re-elected as the member for Edmonton-Calder. Newcomer Deron Bilous was also elected in Edmonton-Beverly-Clareview, the seat formerly held by Martin. In many other ridings the party also won more votes than it had attained previously.

On April 29, 2014, Brian Mason announced that he would step down as leader as soon as a leadership election could be held to choose his successor. Mason who had mentored Rachel Notley convinced her to run for the leadership which she won. During the final few months of Mason&#x27;s tenure the party was already enjoying strong polling in Edmonton, something which would eventually grow into the larger electoral sweep that the Alberta NDP managed in the 2015 provincial election under Mason&#x27;s successor Notley that resulted in the formation of Alberta&#x27;s first ever NDP government.

=== Member of Notley cabinet ===
On May 24, 2015, Mason was appointed Minister of Infrastructure and Minister of Transportation, as well as Government House Leader.

Mason announced on July 4, 2018 that he would not seek re-election in the 2019 provincial election. He remained as a minister until April 30, 2019, when the new United Conservative Party government of Jason Kenney was sworn in.

<text>Sunkist Growers, Incorporated, branded as Sunkist, is an American citrus growers&#x27; non-stock membership cooperative composed of over 1,000 members from California and Arizona headquartered in Valencia, California. Through 31 offices in the United States and Canada and four offices outside North America, its sales in 1991 totaled $956 million. It is the largest fresh produce shipper in the United States, the most diversified citrus processing and marketing operation in the world, and one of California&#x27;s largest landowners.

==History==
In the late 1880s, California citrus growers began organizing themselves into cooperatives, with the goal of increasing profits by pooling their risk and increasing their collective bargaining power with jobbers and packers. The economic depression that began in 1893 worsened farmers&#x27; situations, and intensified their desire to self-organize to their own benefit.

In 1893, P.J. Dreher and his son, Edward L. Dreher, who became the &quot;father of the California citrus industry&quot; (1877–1964), along with several other prominent citrus farmers and land owners formed the Southern California Fruit Exchange in Claremont, a small college town near Los Angeles. The exchange originally represented only orange growers; in 1896 lemon growers joined. Growers from Los Angeles County, Orange County, and Riverside County were among the original members and later expanded to growers and groves in San Bernardino and Ventura Counties. By 1905, the exchange represented 5,000 members, 45% of the California citrus industry, and renamed itself the California Fruit Growers Exchange. Between 1927 and 1939, the exchange sold more than 75% of all California citrus. In the 1947–48 season, the exchange had around 15,000 citrus growers. In 1952, it changed its name to Sunkist Growers, Inc.

==Organizational structure==

The Sunkist organization features three levels in its hierarchy: local, district, and central associations. Individual growers belong to their specific local organization; local organizations are part of a district organization, and districts participate in a central organization. The cooperative&#x27;s main purpose is to create systems enabling fruit from multiple growers to be efficiently harvested, sorted into various sizes and grades, and packed and shipped across the United States in response to shifting demand.

Each level of the exchange had its own distinct purpose. By joining the exchange, citrus growers pledged to deliver all their fruit to their local packing unit. The local packing unit was responsible for helping growers to harvest their citrus, then place the citrus through a packinghouse system to treat, grade, and pack the product. The local exchanges pooled the grower fruits and later redistributed profits back to growers. The district exchanges served as the selling agent for its local packing units by setting pricing and determining markets. The district exchange utilized sales offices and infrastructure provided by the central exchange. The central exchange unified the cooperative with research and guidance for the local and district exchanges. It featured departments such as the treasury department which ensured proper accounting and the advertising department which created advertising materials, managed public relations, and encouraged nutritional research. Additionally, the central exchange fostered scientific research on citrus through its field department and collaborations with the University of California and USDA&#x27;s Citrus Experiment Station in Riverside.

Since its inception, the organization has significantly expanded its activities. In 1906, the CFGE launched the Citrus Protective League, a lobbying arm. In 1907, it formed the Fruit Growers Supply Company to provide growers with materials such as radios, tires, shooks (components for fruit crates), insecticides, and fertilizers at wholesale prices. It later formed the Sunkist&#x27;s Exchange By-Products Company, which developed markets for by-products such as citric acid, sodium citrate, lemon oil, pectin, orange oil and orange pulp.

==The Sunkist brand==
In its early years, the primary problem facing the California citrus industry was an oversupply of fruit. By 1907, California was producing five times as many oranges as fifteen years earlier. Orange production continued to grow as newly planted orange groves began to bear fruit. In response, in 1907 the CFGE approved the first-ever large-scale advertising campaign aimed at marketing a perishable commodity. The March 1907 campaign, promoting oranges to Iowans as &quot;healthy&quot; and &quot;summery&quot; resulted in a 50% increase in orange sales in that state. It also launched the Sunkist brand: the ad agency Lord &amp; Thomas originally proposed using the adjective &quot;sun-kissed&quot; to describe the CFGE oranges; the word eventually used in the campaign was Sunkist, created by the agency as a mnenomic device which would be easier to defend if used as a trademark.

In an effort to distinguish Sunkist oranges from others, the CFGE wrapped its oranges in paper stamped with the Sunkist brand name. In 1909, after Sunkist learned that merchants were selling non-Sunkist oranges as Sunkist, it began to offer consumers a free Sunkist-branded spoon in exchange for mailing in twelve Sunkist wrappers. One million spoons were claimed in the first year of the promotion, further establishing the brand in consumers&#x27; minds and giving merchants a reason to want to display Sunkist oranges in their original wrappers. By 1910, because of the promotion, Sunkist had become the world&#x27;s largest purchaser of cutlery.

The success of early campaigns prompted Sunkist to invest heavily in advertising, and in coming decades the brand was advertised in magazines and on radio, on billboards, streetcars and railroad cars, on the sides of speedboats, in school curricula and essay contests, and in pamphlets distributed in doctors&#x27; offices. Its messaging was aimed to reposition oranges in the minds of consumers. Rather than a luxury to be enjoyed only at Christmas, Sunkist wanted people to believe oranges were essential for good health and to eat one every day.

Sunkist also invested in marketing fresh-squeezed orange juice and lemonade as superior alternatives to &quot;artificial&quot; beverages such as Coca-Cola. By the mid-1930s, one Sunkist orange in five was being consumed in juice form, often at soda fountains, and Sunkist juice was the second-most-popular soda fountain drink, after Coca-Cola.

By 1914, Americans were consuming about forty oranges per person every year, up 80% from 1885.

In 1915, in response to competition from imported Italian lemons, which at that time had nearly half the American market, Sunkist started aggressively marketing the benefits of Sunkist lemons, promoting their use as a hair rinse, in tea, in pie and as a food garnish. By 1924, California lemons had 90% of the American lemon market.

==Today==

In 2023, Sunkist celebrated its 130th anniversary as the &quot;...longest standing agricultural co-op in the US&quot; on &quot;Sunkist Citrus Day&quot; on 1 March 2023 commending its over 1,500 members (many small family farmers) and the more than 40 citrus products in its offering.

<text>Paya Lebar ( ) is a planning area located in the East Region of Singapore, bordered by Hougang to the west, Sengkang to the northwest, Tampines to the east, Bedok to the south and Pasir Ris to the north.

As part of the Singapore Urban Redevelopment Authority&#x27;s (URA) Master Plan 2014, Paya Lebar Central was identified as one of the five growth areas. It was since earmarked as an up-and-coming commercial hub, in line with the wider decentralisation strategy to ensure the city&#x27;s sustainable growth. Paya Lebar participates in the pilot Business Improvement District (BID) programme.

Although they have similar names, Paya Lebar Central, Paya Lebar MRT station and Paya Lebar Road are not part of Paya Lebar Planning Area, instead are part of Geylang East planning subzone, part of Geylang. Paya Lebar itself contains five subzones; Airport Road, Paya Lebar East, Paya Lebar North, Paya Lebar West and Plab (Paya Lebar Air Base). 

==Etymology and history==
Paya Lebar was formerly a swamp close to Kallang River. In Malay, &quot;Paya&quot; means &quot;swamp&quot; and &quot;lebar&quot; means &quot;wide&quot;.

Due to the swamp, the area mainly consisted of squatters who reared pig and poultry and also grew market produce.

In 1865, Richard Owen Norris bought part of the area and lived there with his family.

==Paya Lebar Air Base==

The Singapore International Airport was built in Paya Lebar from 1952 to 1955, and opened on 20 August that year by the Secretary of State for the Colonies, Alan Lennox-Boyd. Singapore International Airport began to be gradually converted into a military air-force base from late 1967 onwards. It became a complete military airbase in 1981 when Singapore Changi Airport was opened and was subsequently renamed as Paya Lebar Air Base (PLAB) in the same year.

==Politics==
Paya Lebar covers Aljunied GRC and Tampines GRC which were warded by the Workers&#x27; Party and the People&#x27;s Action Party, respectively. One notable Member of Parliament for the ward was the former Secretary-General of the Workers&#x27; Party, Low Thia Khiang, where his ward covers a majority of Paya Lebar, including the Paya Lebar Air Base. Following his retirement, it was taken over by Gerald Giam.

From 2025, Paya Lebar will then be covered under Tampines GRC because of the development of Paya Lebar Airbase.

<doc id="1015693" wikidata="Q3148941" url="?curid=1015693" title="Imajica">
<text>Imajica is a 1991 dark fantasy horror novel by English author Clive Barker. Set within a multiverse of parallel dimensions, the narrative weaves together themes of reality, magic, and the cosmic forces that shape existence.

The story follows John Furie Zacharias, also known as Gentle, as he becomes embroiled in a multidimensional conflict involving parallel universes, powerful beings, and the mysteries of creation.

==Reception==
The novel attained critical acclaim. Critics praised &quot;Imajica&quot; for its ambition, world-building, and blend of dark fantasy, horror, and metaphysical themes. It was often seen as Barker&#x27;s finest work, although some criticism was aimed towards the book&#x27;s length and complexity.

Writing in &quot;Fangoria&quot;, W. C. Stroby lauded Barker&#x27;s boldness in tackling &quot;the Big Questions&quot; of love, death, God, and oblivion. He described &quot;Imajica&quot; as &quot;audacious, arrogant and subversive in the most imaginative and visionary of ways,&quot; declaring it to be Barker&#x27;s best book. &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; deemed the novel as &quot;an astonishing feat of the imagination&quot; that runs &quot;riot with ideas, fantastical inventions, graphic sex and violence, soul-terrors, and emotional and intellectual resonances,&quot; and commended Barker for surpassing his previous achievements.

British film editor Jon Gregory acknowledged Barker&#x27;s ongoing obsession with religious imagery and the role of women in his narratives, often portraying them as possessing transformative powers. He highlighted the novel&#x27;s scope, suggesting that &quot;Imajica&quot; is a reworking of the Christ myth, filled with monsters and mayhem, and concluded that the book represented a &quot;step upwards&quot; for Barker, offering a story with greater thematic range than his previous works.

In his review for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Stefan Dziemianowicz revered Barker as a &quot;latter-day Lewis Carroll,&quot; adept at transforming contemporary issues – such as AIDS, racial and sexual politics, and censorship – into mythological material. However, he opined that the novel tends to digress, describing it as a &quot;Chinese puzzle box constructed on a universal scale,&quot; and pointing out that, while &quot;Imajica&quot; dazzles with its inventiveness, it sometimes suffers from an overindulgence in detail that detracts from the overall plot.

Additionally, &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; celebrated Barker&#x27;s &quot;prodigious imagination,&quot; noting his ability to conjure vivid characters, gods, and creatures, while acknowledging the book&#x27;s complexity. The review highlighted &quot;Imajica&quot;&#x27;s &quot;mesmerizing invention&quot; and its blend of violence, eroticism, and myth.

&quot;Imajica&quot; was a finalist for the 1992 Locus Award for Best Horror/Dark Fantasy Novel.

<doc id="1015695" wikidata="Q602303" url="?curid=1015695" title="Armbrust">
<text>Armbrust (German: &quot;Crossbow&quot;) is a lightweight unguided anti-tank weapon designed and developed by Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm of Germany, who later sold its manufacturing rights to Chartered Industries of Singapore (the predecessor of ST Kinetics).

==Overview==

The Armbrust is a recoilless weapon, and is one of the few weapons of this kind that may safely be fired in an enclosed space. The propellant charge is placed between two pistons with the projectile in front of one and a mass of shredded plastic in the rear. Unlike most recoilless weapons, it is a true counter-shot weapon, as the mass of the projectile is equal to the mass of the counterweight and they are ejected from the barrel at the same initial velocity. When the weapon is fired, the propellant expands, pushing the two pistons out. The projectile is forced out of the front and the plastic out of the back. The plastic disperses on leaving the back of the barrel, and is quickly stopped by air resistance. The pistons jam at either end of the barrel, locking the hot gases inside. Its warhead can penetrate up to 300 mm of steel armor.

Since 2004, Armbrusts have gradually been replaced by the Israeli-German-Singapore co-developed MATADOR.

==Combat use==
During the Cambodian–Vietnamese War, Armbrust was supplied to the Cambodian Khmer Rouge. It was used in their fight against the Cambodian government, as well as against Vietnamese Army. Cuban troops in Angola captured several Armbrust launchers from UNITA during the late 1980s.

<doc id="1015710" wikidata="Q1778036" url="?curid=1015710" title="Sun-style tai chi">
<text>The Sun-style tai chi () is one of the five primary styles of tai chi. It is well known for its smooth, flowing movements which omit the more physically vigorous crouching, leaping and &quot;fa jin&quot; of some other styles. Its gentle postures and high stances make it very suitable for martial arts therapy.

==History==
Sun style tai chi was developed by Sun Lutang, who is considered expert in two other internal martial arts styles: &quot;xingyiquan&quot; and &quot;baguazhang&quot; before he came to study tai chi. Today, Sun-style ranks fourth in popularity and fifth in terms of seniority among the five family styles of tai chi. He was also considered an accomplished Neo-Confucian and Taoist scholar, especially in the &quot;I Ching&quot; and the tai chi classics. Sun learned Wu (Hao)-style tai chi from Hao Weizhen, who was Li Yiyu&#x27;s (李亦畬) chief disciple. Sun-style tai chi is considered to be part of the umbrella of Sun-style internal martial arts developed by Sun Lutang.

Besides his earlier &quot;xingyiquan&quot; and &quot;baguazhang&quot; training, Sun&#x27;s experiences with Hao Weizhen, Yang Shaohou, Yang Chengfu and Wu Jianquan influenced the development of what is today recognized as the Sun style of tai chi.

The Sun style is a syncretic martial art, influenced by tai chi, &quot;xingyiquan&quot; and &quot;baguazhang&quot;. One of the styles of tai chi influencing the Sun style is Wu (Hao). The footwork of both styles are similar in that when one foot advances or retreats, the other foot follows. The Sun style also exhibits small circular movements with the hand.

Sun&#x27;s son Sun Cunzhou (孫存周; 1893–1963) and daughter, Sun Jianyun (孫劍雲; 1914–2003) were tai chi teachers, as well as Sun Cunzhou&#x27;s daughter Sun Shurong (孫叔容; 1918–2005) who taught in Beijing until her death. Sun Wanrong (孫婉容; 1927—Present), who is the other daughter of Sun Cunzhou, still teaches tai chi in Beijing. Sun-style tai chi teachers in the USA include Tim Cartmell in Huntington Beach, CA, Way Sun in Chicago, Michael Garofalo in Red Bluff, CA, Aiping Cheng in Austin, TX, and Justin Harris in Fort Worth, TX.

<doc id="1015717" wikidata="Q11549519" url="?curid=1015717" title="Destroyer squadron">
<text>A destroyer squadron is a naval squadron or flotilla usually consisting of destroyers rather than other types of vessel. In some navies other vessels, such as frigates, may be included. In English the word &quot;squadron&quot; tends to be used for larger and &quot;flotilla&quot; for smaller vessels; both may be used for destroyer units. Similar formations are used in non-English-speaking countries, e.g., the &quot;escadrille&quot;—which would translate directly as &quot;squadron&quot;—in France.

==Royal Navy==
The Royal Navy began to form units of destroyers after the introduction of &#x27;torpedo boat destroyers&#x27; in the early 1900s though pre-World War Two they were usually designated flotillas. RN destroyer units are listed in the main article above examples of some destroyer squadrons below.
* 1st Destroyer Squadron, 1947-1970
* 2nd Destroyer Squadron, 1956-1971
* 3rd Destroyer Squadron, 1945-2001
* 4th Destroyer Squadron, 1948-1959
* 5th Destroyer Squadron, 1947-2002

==US Navy==
The U.S. Navy acronym for a destroyer squadron is DESRON; it comprises three or more destroyers or frigates. It is not generally an operational unit, but is responsible for training, equipping and administering of its ships. A mixed unit including destroyers is the cruiser-destroyer group. The officer in command of DESRON SIX, for example, is designated Commander Destroyer Squadron Six, COMDESRON SIX for short.

As during World War II, a full-strength DesRon (as it was abbreviated at the time) comprised two Destroyer Divisions or DesDivs of four ships each, plus a squadron flagship; these were operational as well as administrative units.

In the late 1950s and through early 1962 a Squadron (Desron) comprised two four-ship Divisions (Desdivs) with one ship designated the flagship. The flagship carried the Squadron Commodore as well as the ship&#x27;s Captain. The Squadron normally operated as a unit within a Task Group or Fleet, its main duty being as anti-submarine screen for the aircraft carriers. Often, however, the divisions of the squadron were assigned to separate duties—and sometimes two ship elements might be sent on individual assignments. The flagship not only carried the Commodore, it also carried the Squadron doctor and chaplain.

From 1 April 1962, Cruiser-Destroyer forces in the Atlantic and Pacific Fleets were organized in Cruiser-Destroyer Flotillas (CRUDESFLOTs). These formations included Cruiser-Destroyer Flotilla One in the Pacific (included &quot;Parks&quot;), Cruiser-Destroyer Flotilla Three at Long Beach in the Pacific (commanded for a time by Rear Admiral Draper Kauffman), Cruiser-Destroyer Flotilla Two in the Atlantic (included ), Cruiser-Destroyer Flotilla Four in the Atlantic, which supplied ships for the Task Force Alfa antisubmarine experiment and had as flagship for a time. Cornelius S. Snodgrass served as chief of staff for CRUDESFLOT 4 before his retirement in 1974. Cruiser-Destroyer Flotilla Six in the Atlantic (flagship at one point and included &quot;Yellowstone&quot;). Cruiser-Destroyer Flotilla Six included Destroyer Squadron Four with in 1971, seemingly home-ported at the Charleston Naval Base. Cruiser-Destroyer Flotilla Seven was homeported at San Diego, commanded by Admiral Waldemar F. A. Wendt from April 1962, with concurrent duty as Commander, Cruiser-Destroyer Force, Pacific, October–November 1961. CRUDESFLOT SEVEN was also commanded at one point by then Rear Admiral Elmo Zumwalt. In December 1969, Admiral Robert S. Salzer assumed command of Cruiser Destroyer Flotilla 3. Salzar assumed command of Cruiser Destroyer Flotilla 7 in September 1970, and after the disestablishment of that formation on 16 March 1971 returned to command of Cruiser Destroyer Flotilla 3.

Other flotillas included Cruiser-Destroyer Flotilla Eight in the Atlantic, which at one point included Destroyer Squadron Twenty-Two, Cruiser-Destroyer Flotilla Nine in the Pacific, Cruiser-Destroyer Flotilla Eleven in the Pacific (with DesDiv 152, DesRon 15?), and Cruiser-Destroyer Flotillas Ten and Twelve in the Atlantic.

On 30 June 1973 Cruiser-Destroyer Flotillas were redesignated Cruiser-Destroyer Groups (CRUDESGRUs). The overall responsibility for surface warships on the west coast of the US is taken by the Commander, Naval Surface Forces Pacific (COMNAVSURFPAC); on the east coast, the same responsibility rests with the Commander, Naval Surface Forces Atlantic (COMSURFLANT). Previously under this system, when deployed, a Cruiser-Destroyer Group Commander would normally have been assigned to command a Carrier Battle Group (CVBG). Cruiser-Destroyer Groups were superseded by Carrier strike groups from 1 October 2004.

When a destroyer squadron deploys, for instance as part of a carrier strike group, overall command is transferred to the Naval Component Commander of the local Regional Command (e.g. COMNAVCENT or Commander US Naval Forces, Central Command).

===List of US destroyer squadrons===

* Destroyer Squadron 1 (DesRon 1) (Pacific Fleet)
* Destroyer Squadron 2 (U.S. Atlantic Fleet)
* Destroyer Squadron 3: In late 1941, Destroyer Squadron 3, like Destroyer Squadron 5, was composed of one flagship plus two four-ship divisions of 1,500-tonners: , flag; ; , and six more. All except &quot;Downes&quot; commissioned in 1936.

* Destroyer Squadron 6 (Atlantic) (Pascagoula, Mississippi, when part of Western Hemisphere Group; included &quot;Hall&quot;, &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;, and &quot;Yorktown&quot; c.1998). In April 1994, Commander, Destroyer Squadron 6 changed homeport to Pascagoula, Mississippi, and subsequently was dual-hatted as Commander, Naval Surface Group Pascagoula. In January 1996, as a result of a reorganization of the United States Atlantic Fleet, Commander, Naval Surface Group Pascagoula was renamed Commander, Regional Support Group Pascagoula. In April 1998, as the result of yet another reorganization, COMDESRON 6 shifted operational control to Commander, Western Hemisphere Group, and was redesignated as a Tactical Squadron. In December 1999, COMDESRON 6 was redesignated as a Tactical/Readiness Squadron under the operational control of Commander, Naval Surface Group 2. At one point, the composition of Destroyer Squadron 6 included FFG-16 at Mayport, FFG 22 at Charleston, SC, at Charleston, SC, FFG 15 at Norfolk, and FFG 20 and FFG 21 at Pascagoula.

<text>Pierre Pelot (Pierre Grosdemange, also known as Pierre Pelot, Pierre Suragne or Pierre Carbonari), is a French science fiction writer. Born on 13 November 1945, in Saint-Maurice-sur-Moselle, Vosges, France.

==Overview==
Pelot began his writing career by writing westerns. His first novel, &quot;La piste du Dakota&quot; [The Dakota Trail], takes place in the United States after the end of the Civil War. It appeared in the imprint &quot;Marabout Junior&quot;.

In 1967, Pelot created the character of &quot;Dylan Stark&quot;, who was born in the Confederacy. The first novel in this book series, &quot;Quatre Hommes pour l&#x27;Enfer&quot; Four Men to Hell, also takes place during the Civil War. In this novel Dylan Stark reluctantly fights on the side of the Confederacy. The &quot;Dylan Stark&quot; series was mostly published by &quot;Pocket Marabout&quot; starting in 1967.

In the early 1970s, Pelot began to contribute novels to both the &quot;Angoisse&quot; horror and &quot;Anticipation&quot; science fiction imprints of publisher Fleuve Noir. For the latter, he penned a series of remarkably mature space operas under the pseudonym of &quot;Pierre Suragne&quot;. Between 1972 and 1980, Pelot contributed 14 science fiction novels and 7 horror novels to Fleuve Noir. His &quot;Anticipation&quot; novels were notable for their bleak endings, which was unusual at the time, as well as their new concepts, often incorporating post-1968 political themes such as ecology. They were written in a hard-hitting style borrowed from thrillers rather than space opera, and included the occasional sexual scenes.

Throughout the 1980s, Pelot produced a huge number of novels for virtually every science fiction publisher in France. Most, if not all, carried the same message, vilifying the evils of the military-industrial complex and capitalist economy, protecting the environment and expressing socialist ideas. His works for the most part described police states, utopias and dystopias, and usually featured doomed rebels who tried to see behind the veil of their protected lives. &quot;Transit&quot; (1977), one of his most accomplished novels, featured an experimental hypnotic journey that leads a researcher to a peaceful utopia.

Pelot&#x27;s major stream of dystopic novels during the 1980s were produced for &quot;Presses-Pocket&quot;, for which he wrote twelve novels between 1977 and 1990. Most of these fit in a series entitled &quot;Les Hommes sans Futurs&quot; [Men Without A Future], which portray the desperate and often all too futile wanderings of the last men and women on an Earth now inhabited by unfathomable new mutants.

In the 1990s, Pelot diversified his career further, producing crime thrillers, adventure novels, in addition to his science fiction work.

<doc id="1015723" wikidata="Q1550647" url="?curid=1015723" title="Terrex ICV">
<text>The Terrex Infantry Carrier Vehicle (ICV) is an armoured fighting vehicle (AFV) developed by ST Engineering of Singapore and Timoney Technology of Ireland, and produced by ST Engineering Land Systems (a corporate subsidiary of ST Engineering) for the Singapore Army as well as by Turkish auto-maker Otokar (manufacturing it under a license) as the Yavuz (AV-82) for the Turkish military.

The Terrex&#x27;s mass is approximately 25 to 30 tonnes and the vehicle is built on an 8x8 wheeler chassis with modern military vehicle armour. Multiple-type weapon platforms are supported on the vehicle, including both remote-type weapon systems and overhead weapon stations (OWSs).

ST Engineering Land Systems is marketing the Terrex to potential buyers in Asia, South America and the Middle East.

==Production history and development==

The Terrex project started off as a government funded project to help develop a new generation of armoured personnel carriers for the Singapore Armed Forces. Singapore Technologies Kinetics, a subsidiary of Singapore Technologies Engineering, was chosen to design and manufacture the vehicle. The prototype Terrex AV81 armoured fighting vehicle was exhibited for the first time at DSEi 2001. The initial AV-81 design utilised conventional coil-spring shock absorbers but later variants introduced of hydro-pneumatic struts with real-time damping control. An electric-hybrid drive system was also developed. Designed with a modular protection system it is one of the latest and most advanced APCs with an all round protection against 7.62 mm NATO rounds and artillery shell splinters, front arc withstands 12.7 mm armor piercing-rounds at the most basic armor package. Ceramic-composite armor package are available for a higher level of protection. Maximum level of all-round protection is against 14.5 mm armor-piercing rounds. The vehicle has a double V-shaped hull, which deflects mine blasts and withstand up to 12 kg TNT explosion under the hull with the vehicle still able to move. Vehicle is fitted with NBC protection system and battlefield management system for better awareness.

Terrex AV81 APC variant is armed with a remotely controlled 40 mm automatic grenade launcher and coaxial 7.62 mm machine gun. Its modular top-deck system means it can be fitted with remotely-controlled 12.7 mm machine gun, 20–30 mm cannon or anti-tank guided missile to a 105 mm cannon. This armored vehicle is also available in various turret-mounted armament configurations, but number of personnel carried is reduced. The Terrex can be airlifted by a C-130 Hercules or similar cargo aircraft.

By mid-2004, one prototype and one pre-production model had been built and both were evaluated throughout Asia and Europe, where the vehicle was offered for a number of emerging wheeled armoured vehicle requirements. This was further influenced by the emerging United States&#x27; Interim Brigade Combat Team (IBCT) concept, which called for the need of wheeled armoured fighting vehicles (AFV) as opposed to tracked AFVs.

The Singapore Armed Forces will acquire at least 135 Terrex ICVs to replace its V-200 armoured vehicles, with all active Infantry and Guards battalions to begin training to operate from the vehicle in February 2010. The Second Battalion, Singapore Infantry Regiment, recently acquired the Terrex as part of its shift into a motorised infantry battalion. The Indonesian Army has plans to purchase 420 units and has also expressed intent to produce the Terrex locally under license. Turkish automaker Otokar has also joined with ST Engineering Land Systems to produce the Terrex AV-82 (renamed Yavuz) for the Turkish Armed Forces.

In December 2024, ST Engineering announced that it has secured a strategic partnership with Kazakhstan Paramount Engineering (KPE) to set up production capabilities for a new military vehicle, to be based on the Terrex.

===Terrex AV-82===
The Terrex AV-82 (Turkish Otokar variant) was developed in 2005 equipped with a more advanced driveline and hydro-pneumatic suspension system, and a number of changes from the AV81 including a flat underbody instead of a V-shaped hull, and revised rear suspension.

===Terrex 2: MPC/ACV===
In August 2012, the U.S. Marine Corps awarded SAIC a developmental contract for the Terrex for the Marine Personnel Carrier program.

On 18 July 2013, SAIC, along with ST Engineering Land Systems and Armatec Survivability Corporation, successfully completed two weeks of evaluations of the Terrex at Camp Pendleton. The tests included a series of water performance demonstrations in various sea conditions and an evaluation of human factors and stowage capacity. The Terrex completed all required surf transit and ocean swim maneuverability tests at its fully loaded combat weight. It demonstrated load capabilities through successful stowage of gear and supplies that Marines would require for three days of operations, with space available for additional equipment. The human factors evaluation demonstrated the spacious interior by accommodating the specified number of combat-equipped Marines and enabling rapid tactical and emergency egress through a quick-release hatch. The Terrex repeated ocean swim and maneuverability results were achieved in a March 2013 rehearsal event. SAIC began ballistic and blast tests at the Nevada Automotive Test Center in May 2013, and was scheduled to complete all ballistic and mine blast demonstrations in July.

The Marine Personnel Carrier was put on hold in June 2013, restarted in February 2014, and then restructured as Phase 1 of the Amphibious Combat Vehicle (ACV) program, which includes the previous MPC competitor entries.

The Terrex 2 was publicly unveiled in September 2015 at the DSEI 2015 convention.

On 24 November 2015, the Marines selected the SAIC Terrex, along with the BAE Systems/Iveco SuperAV, to move on to the engineering and manufacturing development phase of the ACV 1.1 program. SAIC was awarded a $121.5 million contract to build 16 vehicles by late 2016 for testing. The Terrex submitted for the ACV program, called the Terrex 2, was designed to enhance situational awareness, with the troop commander&#x27;s station equipped with a screen covering all aspects outside the vehicle, also visible to the squad to enable them to see what they would be exiting to. The driver&#x27;s station was equipped with several screens with obstacle avoidance, situational awareness sensor feeds, and other features. Although the Terrex is specialised in ground operations, it also meets the minimum requirements for safe sea operation. The Terrex has a V-over-V hull that creates a crush zone to reduce the impact of a blast on the floor; this creates a spacious interior. Footrests attached to seats across the aisle keep the Marines&#x27; feet from absorbing blast energy. The vehicle uses a central tire inflation system, can swim in water, and has excess buoyancy of 23 percent. It weighs 32.5 tons (), carries three crew and 11 embarked Marines, and can reach on paved roads.

In June 2018, the Marine Corps selected BAE Systems for the ACV program.

===Terrex 3: Australian Army: LAND 400 Program===
Referred in Australia as the Sentinel 2, it was specially developed by ST Engineering and Elbit Systems of Australia (ELSA) to meet the Australian Army&#x27;s requirement for an armored reconnaissance vehicle. A further development of the Terrex 2, it is better protected and carries a much more powerful armament but lacks amphibious capability due to its 35 tonne weight. Designed with Elbit Land System&#x27;s MT30 modular turret, the vehicle is operated by a crew of 2 and can carry 11 dismounts. It was outbid by the Rheinmetall Boxer CRV in early 2018.

=== Terrex s5 ===
At the 2024 Singapore Airshow, ST Engineering unveiled the Terrex s5. The Terrex s5 (s5 stands for: Smartness, Superiority, Sustainability, Survivability and Serviceability) is the latest iteration of the Terrex ICV lineage, intended to be a new 8x8 family competitive on the export market. It features considerable digital technologies and systems, able to project a stereoscopic view of the surrounding environment to its crew and also features waypoint driving, obstacle detection, a 360° prismatic camera system, and coupling with UGVs and UAVs. The chassis has enhanced protection, stated to be STANAG Level 4, and comes with independent suspension for each of the eight wheels. The suspension can be upgraded to active suspension and the wheels upgraded to run-flat tires. Furthermore, it features a hybrid-electric drive that helps push the vehicle to 120 km/h on roads (~75 mph) and also features a &quot;Silent Mode&quot; with a running radius of 50 km using on-board Li-ion batteries.

The Terrex s5 is intended to be modular to suit a variety of missions. Six variants have been published: the Trooper, a command vehicle, an ATGM vehicle, a Fire Support Vehicle fitted with either a 105 mm or 120 mm cannon, a mortar vehicle, and an amphibious variant. The variant shown at the 2024 Singapore Airshow is the Trooper, utilizing ST Engineering&#x27;s ADDER Remote Weapon Station, armed with a 30 autocannon that is likely a Mk44 Bushmaster II, as on the Hunter AFV.

==Design==
As with a number of other recent wheeled armoured vehicles, the Terrex is of modular design with various levels of armour protection and weapon systems being marketed up to a gross vehicle weight of 24,000 kg. Despite its size, the Terrex is air-portable by C-130s or other similar cargo aircraft.

The Terrex&#x27;s layout is conventional: the driver sits front left and the power pack is to the right. This leaves the rest of the vehicle clear for the troop compartment, which is provided with a power-operated ramp and roof hatches.

Various weapon systems can be fitted on the roof, including a remote weapon station armed with a 40mm automatic grenade launcher and a 7.62mm coaxial machine gun or a complete stabilized turret armed with a 25mm M242 Bushmaster cannon and 7.62mm coaxial machine gun. Additional 7.62mm machine guns can be mounted over the rear troop compartment. In addition, the vehicle can be configured to carry varying combat payloads, from turret-based weapon stations (including 105 mm tank guns) to rocket launchers. The modular top deck allows for quick configuration changes to be carried out.

The Terrex AV-81 uses a patented independent double wishbone suspension, which greatly improves ground mobility and ride comfort over rough terrain. The use of automatic traction control and the capacity for large footprint off-road tires enables it to travel at unprecedented speeds in soft ground conditions.

The vehicle has a double hull with an external V-hull that improves mine blast survivability. Add-on armour provides further protection for troops. It is also capable of providing full NBC (nuclear, biological, chemical) protection in extreme operational conditions.

The standard equipment includes a powered steering on four wheels at the front, a central tyre-pressure inflation system, an anti-lock braking system and an NBC defensive/protective system but there are also many other options for fitted equipment and vehicle gear available.

In its baseline configuration, the AV-81 Terrex is fully amphibious: two water jets mounted on either side at the back of the hull propel the vehicle through water at 10 km/h.

==Variants==
The following known variants are in service:

* Command Variant
* 40mm AGL/7.62mm Coaxial MG Variant
* .50 calibre HMG Variant
* SPIKE ATGM Variant

==Incidents==
On 23 November 2016, nine Terrex vehicles from the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF), which were used for a military exercise in Taiwan, were seized while in port at Hong Kong, resulting in heightened political tensions between Singapore and China. They were initially impounded at an outdoor storage yard of a Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department storage facility in Tuen Mun, but by 6 December, they had been moved indoors.

On 24 January 2017, the Hong Kong government stated that it would allow the detained Terrexes to return to Singapore. The vehicles were returned to Singapore on 30 January 2017.

<text>The Chapada Diamantina National Park (; ) is a national park in the Chapada Diamantina region of the State of Bahia, Brazil.
The terrain is rugged, and mainly covered by flora of the Caatinga biome.

==Location==

The park is in the Caatinga biome, and covers .
It was created by decree 91.655 of 17 September 1985, and is administered by the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation.
The park covers parts of the municipalities of Palmeiras, Mucugê, Lençóis, Ibicoara and Andaraí in the state of Bahia.

== Terrain ==
The park is in the Chapada Diamantina, a plateau bounded by cliffs of in central Bahia.
Altitudes in the plateau typically vary from .
In the more mountainous parts there are several peaks of , and a few over .
The plateau forms a watershed, draining on one side into the São Francisco River and on the other into the De Contas River and Paraguaçu River.

The park lies in the rugged Sincorá Range in the east of the plateau, an area of folded and heavily eroded structures. The range is elongated in a north-south direction, and has an average width of . The highest point of the state is in the park, the Pico do Barbado. Both gold and diamonds have been found in the range. The range forces moist air moving west from sea upward which causes higher levels of rainfall, particularly in the east. There are many systems of caves formed by the rivers of the region.

== Flora and fauna ==

Vegetation includes typical Caatinga xerophytic formations at elevations from about , Atlantic Forest vegetation along the watercourses, meadows and rocky fields higher up. Endemic flora include &quot;Adamantinia miltonioides&quot;, &quot;Cattleya elongata&quot;, &quot;Cattleya tenuis&quot;, &quot;Cattleya x tenuata&quot;, &quot;Cleites libonni&quot; and &quot;Cleistes metallina&quot;. The hooded visorbearer (&quot;Augastes lumachellus&quot;) hummingbird is endemic. There are few large mammals, but many species of small mammals, reptiles, amphibians, birds and insects.

== Conservation ==
The park is classed as IUCN protected area category II (national park). It has the objectives of preserving natural ecosystems of great ecological relevance and scenic beauty, enabling scientific research, environmental education, outdoors recreation and eco-tourism. Protected birds in the reserve include white-necked hawk (&quot;Buteogallus lacernulatus&quot;), Chaco eagle (&quot;Buteogallus coronatus&quot;), Bahia tyrannulet (&quot;Phylloscartes beckeri&quot;), ochre-marked parakeet (&quot;Pyrrhura cruentata&quot;) and Bahia spinetail (&quot;Synallaxis whitneyi&quot;).

Other protected species include Barbara Brown&#x27;s titi (&quot;Callicebus barbarabrownae&quot;), cougar (&quot;Puma concolor&quot;), jaguar (&quot;Panthera onca&quot;), oncilla (&quot;Leopardus tigrinus&quot;), giant armadillo (&quot;Priodontes maximus&quot;) and giant anteater (&quot;Myrmecophaga tridactyla&quot;).

<text>The FH-2000 or Field Howitzer 2000 was developed by Singapore Technologies for the Singapore Army. It is a 155 mm/52-calibre towed howitzer gun. It fires projectiles to a maximum range of 42 kilometers using special extended range ammunition, that was field tested in New Zealand. It has a crew of eight and uses a 75 hp diesel auxiliary power unit to give it a self-propelled speed of 16 kilometers an hour movement without towing.

It&#x27;s reported that the FH-2000 will be replaced over time by the Next Generation Howitzer project.

==Development==

The FH-2000 is a development of the FH-88 gun system, which was first produced in 1983 and uses many of the same components. Development of the FH-2000 began in 1990, with the first prototype produced in 1991. The initial prototype was developed further, and acceptance tests were completed in December 1993. The gun differs in a number of ways from the earlier FH-88 most notable is the longer 52 calibre barrel as compared to the 39 calibre barrel of the FH-88.

Additionally, ST Kinetics assisted Turkey in the design and manufacture of its own 155mm/52calibre Panter towed howitzer system, which is understood to be based on the FH-2000 design but upgraded locally with an uprated diesel Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) of 160 hp instead of the original 75 hp, thus giving it a self-propelled speed of 18 km/h as compared to 10 km/h for the FH-2000.

==Design==
The firing platform, when fully deployed, support the howitzer using a tripod mechanical structure. Firing loads are transmitted to the ground through this tripod, isolating the hydraulic cylinders of the platform, which provides for greater reliability. The FH-2000 shares compontents with the FH-88, including the sighting system and APU.

The FH2000 can be fitted with a series of sighting systems from optical to electro-optical, which are linked to the fire control computers. The breech mechanism is semi-automatic and it opens automatically during counter recoil.

An electronically controlled and hydraulically powered flick rammer rams the projectile into the barrel chamber with high consistency.

==History==

===Deployment===
By 1995, 18 guns were deployed with the 23rd Singapore Artillery Battalion in three batteries of six guns. The gun has been offered for export, and the Indonesian army has taken delivery of a number of these units.

===1997 incident===
On 9 March 1997, a 155mm artillery round exploded in the barrel of a FH-2000 gun howitzer during a live firing exercise conducted by the 23rd Battalion of Singapore Artillery at the artillery range of Waiouru Army Camp, near Waiouru in New Zealand. This resulted in the deaths of two full-time national servicemen, Third Sergeant Ronnie Tan Han Chong and Lance Corporal Low Yin Tit. 12 other servicemen were injured in the incident, including a Staff Sergeant from New Zealand Army, who was acting as the New Zealand Defence Force liaison officer/observer to the visiting SAF battalion.

A Committee of Inquiry found that the most probable cause of the incident was a faulty artillery fuze that was fitted to the 155 mm projectile which, when loaded into the gun howitzer, detonated prematurely by action of the flick rammer. Subsequently, Chartered Industries of Singapore conducted an X-ray check on the same batch of fuzes from where the faulty fuze was taken from and found that approximately 1.3% of these fuzes were faulty.

The families of the two deceased SAF servicemen, as well as other injured servicemen, were compensated. Various SAF and New Zealand personnel were also awarded, in recognition of their acts of bravery and professionalism during the incident. Lieutenant-Colonel Toh Boh Kwee, First Warrant Officer Mohinder Singh, First Sergeant Teo Boon Hong and Lieutenant Leroy Forrester NZDF received the Pingat Jasa Perwira (Tentera) for risking their lives to help injured soldiers immediately after the explosion.

===Failed Exports===

* : The FH-2000 was competing to win a contract against BAE&#x27;s FH77 worth Rs 9,000 crore (USD$2 Billion), but ST Kinetics was being investigated by the Central Bureau of Investigation for alleged corruption links against former Ordnance Factory Board chief Sudipto Ghosh.

<text>The is a zoo, managed by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government, and located in Taitō, Tokyo, Japan. It is Japan&#x27;s oldest zoo, opened on March 20, 1882. It is served by Ueno Station, Keisei Ueno Station and Nezu Station, with convenient access from several public transportation networks (JR East, Tokyo Metro and Keisei Electric Railway). The Ueno Zoo Monorail, the first monorail in the country, connected the eastern and western parts of the grounds, however the line was suspended from 2019 onwards due to ageing infrastructure until being announced as closing permanently on 27 December 2023.

The zoo is in Ueno Park, a large urban park that is home to museums, a small amusement park, and other attractions. The zoo is closed on Mondays (Tuesday if Monday is a holiday).

== History ==
The zoo started life as a menagerie attached to the National Museum of Natural History. In 1881, responsibility for this menagerie was handed to naturalist and civil servant Tanaka Yoshio, who oversaw its transition into a public zoo. The ground was originally estate of the imperial family, but was to the municipal government in 1924 — along with Ueno Park — on the occasion of crown prince Hirohito&#x27;s wedding.

=== World War II ===
In August 1943, the administrator of Tokyo, Shigeo Ōdachi, ordered that all &quot;wild and dangerous animals&quot; at the zoo be killed, claiming that bombs could hit the zoo and escaped animals would wreak havoc in the streets of Tokyo. Requests by the staff at the zoo for a reprieve, or to evacuate the animals elsewhere, were refused. The animals were executed primarily by poisoning, strangulation or by simply placing the animals on starvation diets. A memorial service was held for the animals in September 1943 (while two of the elephants were still starving) and a permanent memorial (built anew in 1975) can be found in the Ueno Zoo.

Shortly after the March 1945 bombings of Tokyo, the Japanese placed U.S. Army Air Force navigator and bombardier Ray &quot;Hap&quot; Halloran on display naked in a Ueno Zoo tiger cage, as Halloran later recalled &quot;&#x27;the hated B-29 prisoner&#x27;, naked, unwashed and covered with sores from fleas, lice and bed bug bites&quot;, so civilians could walk in front of the cage and view him.

In 1949, elephants Hanako and Indira were imported to live in the zoo. After a few years, Hanako was moved to Inokashira Zoo and Indira was sent on a tour of Japan.

=== Recent renovations ===
The zoo provides animals an environment similar to the natural habitat. In recent years, some of the old-fashioned cages of the past have been replaced with modern habitats, such as the &quot;Gorilla Woods,&quot; built after two well-publicized mishaps in 1999. Many of the animal&#x27;s enclosures, such as that for the giraffe, hippopotamus, and rhinoceros are still the old style single stall concrete cages with very little room for the animals.

==Animals==
The zoo is home to more than 2,600 individuals representing over 500 species.

=== Principal animals ===
After the death of giant panda Ling Ling in 2008, Ueno Zoo was without a member of this species for the first time since 1972. Two new giant pandas arrived from the Chinese Wolong Nature Reserve in February 2011. The male panda, Billy (比力 ビーリー) was renamed in Ueno to Līlī (力力 リーリー) to emphasize his playful vitality. The female&#x27;s name Siennyu (仙女 シィエンニュ ‘Fairy’) was changed to Shinshin (真真 シンシン), referring to purity (純真) and innocence (天真). The new names were based on a public poll. The final choices picked by the zoo were, however, not among top choices. Reduplication is very common in panda names.

The zoo is split into two sections, connected by a bridge called the Aesop Bridge, built in 1961 and a monorail (now defunct).

The eastern garden houses giant pandas, sika deer, Japanese squirrels, Eurasian otters, green pheasants, snowy owls, Asian elephants, American bison, black-tailed prairie dogs, colobus monkeys]], [[black-handed spider monkeys, Japanese macaques, [[African sacred ibis]]es, [[Japanese black bear]]s, sun bears, [[Ussuri brown bear]]s, red-crowned cranes, South American tapirs, Sumatran tigers, western lowland gorillas, polar bears, California sea lions and harbor seals.

The western garden houses red pandas, western grey kangaroos, African penguins, Caribbean flamingos, shoebills, Barbary sheep] hippopotamus, pygmy hippopotamus, black rhinoceros, reticulated giraffes, [[okapi]]s, [[Aldabra giant tortoise]]s, saltwater crocodiles, [[green iguana]]s, [[Japanese pond turtle]]s, [[aye-aye]]s, ring-tailed lemurs, [[black-and-white ruffed lemur]]s, eastern lesser bamboo lemur, cackling geese, great white pelicans, [[Oriental stork]]s and [[Steller&#x27;s sea eagle]]s.

<text>A submarine squadron (SUBRON) is a naval formation or unit in such states such as the United Kingdom, United States, and Russia/Soviet Union. In France the equivalent unit is the &#x27; (ESNA), part of the [[French submarine forces]] (and before the Second World War,&#x27;).

==Royal Navy==
Submarine flotillas became submarine divisions in 1952.
 was a &quot;Porpoise&quot;-class submarine belonging first to Faslane&#x27;s 3rd Submarine Squadron and then to Singapore&#x27;s 7th Submarine Squadron (United Kingdom).

From the early 1960s the structure was:
*1st Submarine Squadron – 
*2nd Submarine Squadron – Plymouth
*3rd Submarine Squadron – Faslane
*4th Submarine Division – Sydney (established 1948, disbanded 1969)
*5th Submarine Division – Malta. It was announced on 31 July 1964, that British submarines were to leave Malta. Captain C.H. Hammer was last Captain S.M. 5. HMS &quot;Ausonia&quot;, the division depot ship, set sail for the UK on 7 August 1964, and then paid off. Submarine depot ships at Malta were &quot;Forth&quot; (1948–1960), HMS &quot;Narvik&quot; (1960–1962), and then &quot;Ausonia&quot; from 1962 to 1964.
*6th Submarine Division – Halifax, Nova Scotia Three A-class submarines arrived 1954, served with the division, disbanded c. 1967)
*7th Submarine Division – Singapore (disbanded by 1971)
*10th Submarine Squadron – Formed Faslane late 1960s for the SSBNs

In 1971 HMNB Clyde at Faslane in Scotland was home to the Third Submarine Squadron of Nuclear Fleet and Diesel Patrol Submarines, &#x27;the fighters&#x27;, and the 10th Submarine Squadron consisting of the four Polaris submarines, &#x27;the bombers&#x27;. The Base also conducted the training of all submarines before they joined their Squadrons and this was known as &#x27;work up&#x27;. On the decommissioning of the Polaris submarines the 10th Submarine Squadron re-equipped with ballistic missile submarines.

1st Submarine Squadron was located at HMS Dolphin during the early 1990s. In 2001, the five s were part of the 1st Submarine Squadron based at Faslane and the seven boats were with the Second Submarine Squadron at Devonport.

See List of squadrons and flotillas of the Royal Navy.

==Canada==

From 1966 to 1996 the First Canadian Submarine Squadron was in existence with the Royal Canadian Navy&#x27;s three Oberon-class submarines.

==United States Navy==
Up until World War II and for a little after, submarine squadrons could have several Submarine Divisions (SubDivs), often pairs of submarines. Reserve submarine divisions also existed after World War II.

A SUBRON usually consists of three or more submarines. It is the submarine force equivalent to a destroyer squadron in the surface Navy. The officer in charge of SUBRON ONE is designated Commander Submarine Squadron One or COMSUBRON ONE. However, unlike a destroyer squadron—which actually moves its staff aboard its ships and deploys with them as an operational Task Element commander—a SUBRON commander and his staff always remain in homeport, and are responsible only for the training, equipping and administering of the ships under its umbrella. A submarine squadron is usually commanded by a Captain (O-6) who has already had at least one tour as commander of a submarine.

Several submarine squadrons may be organized into a Submarine Group (SUBGRU), headed under a flag officer. For instance, SUBRON 17, SUBRON 19 and DEVRON 5 are part of SUBGRU 9 in Bangor, Washington. The overall responsibility for submarines on the west coast of the United States is taken by the Commander Submarine Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet (COMSUBPAC); on the east coast, the same responsibility rests with the Commander Submarine Force, Atlantic Fleet (COMSUBLANT). The latter is the senior of the two, and thus also plays a secondary role as Commander, Submarine Force (COMSUBFOR).

When a submarine deploys, for instance as part of a carrier strike group, operational command is transferred to the numbered fleet commander for the theater to which the submarine is deploying, e.g., Commander Fifth Fleet.

<doc id="1015744" wikidata="Q5223119" url="?curid=1015744" title="Dark Age Ahead">
<text>Dark Age Ahead is a 2004 book by Jane Jacobs describing what she sees as the decay of five key &quot;pillars&quot; in &quot;North America&quot;: community and family, higher education, science and technology, taxes and government responsiveness to citizen&#x27;s needs, and self-regulation by the learned professions.

She argues that this decay threatens to create a Dark Age unless the trends are reversed. Jacobs characterizes a Dark Age as a &quot;mass amnesia&quot; where even the memory of what was lost is lost.

==Jacobs&#x27; arguments==
The following is a summary of Jacobs&#x27; description of the decay in each area.
;Community and Family:People are increasingly choosing consumerism over family welfare, that is: consumption over fertility; debt over family budget discipline; fiscal advantage to oneself at the expense of community welfare.
;Higher Education:Universities are more interested in credentials than providing high quality education.
;Bad Science:Elevation of economics as the main &quot;science&quot; to consider in making major political decisions.
;Bad Government:Governments are more interested in deep-pocket interest groups than the welfare of the population.
;Bad Culture:A culture that prevents people from understanding the deterioration of fundamental physical resources on which the entire community depends.

==Jacobs&#x27; stance against ideology==
Overall, Jacobs argued that the very concept of &quot;ideology&quot; is fundamentally flawed and detrimental to both individuals and societies, no matter what side of the political spectrum an ideology comes from. By relying on ideals, she claimed people become unable to think and evaluate problems and solutions by themselves, but simply fall back on their beliefs for &quot;pre-fabricated answers&quot; to any problem they encounter.

===Example===
As an example, which also tied into Jacobs&#x27; views on city community life, she cited the 1995 Chicago heat wave, which killed hundreds of mostly elderly Chicagoans.

:The &quot;official&quot; reason, according to the United States Department of Health (following a multi-million dollar study), was that the victims simply did not take precautions such as maintaining a steady water supply, finding air conditioning, or circulating air in their buildings. Jacobs argued that the study, in addition to spending millions of dollars to state the obvious, was flawed because of its inherent ideology, which was individualism. She noted that a sociology graduate student, Eric Klinenberg, wrote his thesis on the disaster, &quot;Heat Wave: A Social Autopsy of Disaster in Chicago&quot;, which proved much more enlightening.

:By examining the social atmosphere of different Chicago neighborhoods, Klinenberg discovered that many deaths were not dependent on individual factors, such as wealth, but rather on the cohesiveness of the neighborhood. Within tightly-knit and older neighborhoods, he found, elderly people at risk of heat stroke were more likely to be checked on by neighbors, less afraid to leave their homes to get help, and more likely to find sympathetic people and businesses that would allow them to relax in an air-conditioned environment (for example, dropping into a neighborhood grocery or barbershop, and having a proprietor willing to simply let them sit). In contrast, within neighborhoods where the elderly were isolated and unable to get help. Ironically, wealthier neighborhoods were less likely to have strong neighborly ties.

Jacobs, citing the two studies, argued that the federal study was unconsciously biased by the prevailing political and economic ideology (that is, neoliberalism), which promoted individualism to the point of becoming completely oblivious to community and social factors, even though, as Klinenberg found, these were the factors that ultimately caused the deaths.

Using this and other examples, Jacobs argued that modern political and economic ideologies were in effect no different from those dominant in Western civilization&#x27;s past Dark Ages, such as medieval Roman Catholicism. In both cases, she claimed, the dominant ideology prevented and discouraged people from finding rational and scientifically verifiable explanations and solutions.

==Reception==
The &quot;New Yorker&quot; reviewer Paul Goldberger called the book &quot;a despairing look at the state of things, and like everything Jacobs wrote, it is a curious combination of plainspoken common sense based on simple, empirical observation of the world around her, and broad generalizations about the nature of cities and cultures.&quot;

<text>PHIBRON is a United States Navy abbreviation for Amphibious Squadron. It is a tactical and administrative organization composed of amphibious assault shipping to transport troops and their equipment for an amphibious assault operation.

Before the advent of modern helicopter-oriented amphibious warfare, the amphibious squadron was made up differently, depending on the era. During the 1960s, a typical squadron might consist of an Attack Transport (APA/LPA), a Dock Landing Ship (LSD), an Attack Cargo Ship (AKA/LKA), one or two Landing Ships, Tank, (LST) and, especially if there were only one LST, a High Speed Transport (APD). The APA carried troops and Landing Craft Vehicle Personnel(LCVP)s in which to land them, plus a few Landing Craft Mechanized(LCM)s for bigger loads. The AKA carried cargo and an assortment of LCVPs and LCMs with which to land it. The LSD carried boats. The LST carried tanks and other rolling stock, and had the ability to discharge its cargo directly onto the beach. The destroyer-like APD provided limited gunfire support and fast defense of the squadron. It frequently also carried a UDT unit or other similar troops. The Landing Platform Helicopter (LPH) replaced the APA in the late 1960s and provided helicopters to land troops and supplies inland, beyond the beach.

In modern times, a U.S. PHIBRON usually consists of three amphibious ships, typically one Landing Helicopter Dock(LHD), a Dock landing ship(LSD) and an Amphibious transport dock(LPD). When the ships of a PHIBRON are loaded up with the forces of a Marine Expeditionary Unit and some additional Navy units (including a Tactical Air Control Squadron (TACRON) detachment and landing craft from a Naval Beach Group two or more of either a Assault Craft Units (ACU), Beachmaster Units (BMU), Special Warfare Group (SWG), Explosive Ordinance Disposal Team (EOD), and Fleet Surgical Team (FST). The unit is designated as an Amphibious ready group(ARG) for deployment capability. The officer in charge of a PHIBRON is designated COMPHIBRON (#) or Commander Amphibious Squadron (#) and acts as the commodore for all ships in the ARG.

It is believed that he was born in Honmurgi village near Solapur Maharashtra in the early 18th century. Very little is known about his early life other than that he was Guru of Patthe Bapurao Kulkarni, a Maharashtrian.

He was a very great spiritual guru and had enlightened all the spiritual chakras.

<text>An amphibious ready group (ARG) of the United States Navy consists of a naval element—a group of warships known as an Amphibious Task Force (ATF)—and a landing force (LF) of U.S. Marines (and occasionally U.S. Army soldiers), in total about 5,000 people. Together, these elements and supporting units are trained, organized, and equipped to perform amphibious operations.

== Composition ==
A typical U.S. Amphibious Readiness Group consists of:
;Ships
* One amphibious assault ship: a Landing Helicopter Assault (LHA) or Landing Helicopter Dock (LHD): the primary landing ship, resembling a small aircraft carrier, designed to transport troops into the war zone by air using transport helicopters. In a secondary role, these ships perform sea control and limited power projection missions using AV-8B Harrier II or F-35B Lightning II Marine aircraft and Navy airborne assets including MH-60S Seahawk. There are currently two classes of amphibious assault ships in service: the (LHD) and the (LHA) (Flights 0 &amp; I).
* One amphibious transport dock ship: a Landing Platform Dock (LPD): a warship that transports troops into the war zone by sea, primarily using conventional landing craft and Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC) hovercraft, although they also have the capability of operating helicopters from their flight decks as well. There is currently one class of LPDs in service: the (Flights I &amp; II).
* One dock landing ship (LSD): a warship supporting amphibious operations including landings onto hostile shores via LCAC, conventional landing craft, and helicopters. There are currently two classes of LSDs in service: the and the .
;Troops and equipment
* A Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU): the smallest configuration of a Marine Air-Ground Task Force that is deployed from an amphibious assault ship. Each MEU includes: a ground combat element of a Marine infantry battalion reinforced with M1 Abrams tanks, artillery, combat engineers, amphibious vehicles, light armored vehicles, and other ground combat assets; an aviation combat element composed of a composite squadron of rotary-wing aircraft and AV-8B Harrier II ground attack and close air support jets, and an Air Traffic Control and command and control detachment; a battalion-sized logistics combat element, and a command element. Each Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) typically consists of about 2,200 Marines and is usually commanded by a colonel. The makeup of the MEU can be customized as situations require; additional artillery, armor, or air units can be attached, including squadrons of F/A-18 Hornet multirole jet fighters (deployed from aircraft carriers or ground bases).
;Aircraft
* AV-8B Harrier IIs or F-35B Lightning IIs: ground-attack aircraft designed to attack and destroy surface targets. F-35Bs also have the secondary role of fighter support.
*MV-22B Ospreys or CH-53E Super Stallions transport personnel, supplies and equipment in support of amphibious and shore operations.
* AH-1Z Vipers: attack helicopters providing fire support and fire support coordination to the landing force during amphibious assaults and subsequent operations ashore.
* UH-1Y Venom: Provides command and control during heliborne operations as well a light attack and assault capabilities.
* USMC MV-22B squadrons are designated as Marine Medium Tiltrotor Squadrons (VMM), and CH-53E squadrons as Marine Heavy Helicopter Squadrons (HMH). When assigned to a MEU, the detachments of the various other squadrons are combined with either the MV-22 or CH-53 squadron to create a reinforced, composite squadron. The reinforced squadron is designated as VMM-XXX(REIN) for MV-22s or HMH-XXX(REIN) for CH-53s, where the Xs are the squadron&#x27;s number. As such, the various aircraft will don the tail codes and markers of the VMM or HMH squadron, though will usually keep their own squadron tail art.

The resulting forces may range from a single Amphibious Ready Group/Marine Expeditionary Unit (Special Operations Capable) [ARG/MEU (SOC)], to a larger organization capable of employing a Marine Expeditionary Brigade (MEB) or even a Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF).

Amphibious forces must be capable of performing missions ranging from humanitarian assistance and disaster relief to major theater war (MTW). Additionally, they can be configured and deployed to operate at various levels of conflict and in multiple theaters simultaneously. They can provide a presence that may preclude adventurous actions by a potential belligerent.

Because they are sea-based and because the decision to position and engage amphibious forces will always be easily reversible, amphibious forces greatly expand the repertoire of available response options. Among other national resources, they are particularly well placed to provide a demonstration of the United States&#x27;s commitment and resolve to friends and allies as well as adversaries.

Normally two to three ARGs are forward deployed: one in the Mediterranean Sea/Persian Gulf–Indian Ocean area, and one or two in the western Pacific Ocean area. The other ships of the ARG are either working up to deploy, in transit, or in overhaul. One ARG/MEU, known as Task Force 76/Expeditionary Strike Group 7, is forward based in Sasebo and Okinawa, Japan.

In most cases, the ATF will be deployed under the protective umbrella of a Carrier Strike Group (CSG), which provides cover for the ATF and combat support to operations ashore. Ships of the ATF are capable of embarking and supporting other forces when the mission requires, including the United States Army, Special Operations Forces (SOF), or other joint and combined forces.

<text>stock.xchng (also known as SXC) was a website providing free-to use stock photography and illustrations, its name being a reduced version of &quot;stock exchange&quot; (meaning the exchange of stock photography, and a play on the term stock exchange). The site was launched in February 2001 by Peter Hamza, and allows users to contribute, share and download high-resolution photographs and illustrations free of charge. Contributors are encouraged to submit material to enhance their photography career through wider public exposure. In 2009, the site had over 2,500,000 registered users (1,000,000 in the USA alone) and more than 400,000 photos. Until 2009, it operated parallel to its sister site, Stockxpert.com, until the site&#x27;s parent company, Jupiterimages, was purchased by Getty Images, and the site is now tied in with the iStock library of paid images.

Since its acquisition by Getty Images in 2014, the site was renamed FreeImages in 2014 and the web address now redirects to a freeimages.com URL. It has retained the older SXC images and the link to the iStock website.

== Features ==

The stock.xchng site operated as a hybrid of a picture library site and a social networking site; registered users could set up a personal profile, upload their photographic works to share with other users, write a blog and participate in online forums to discuss and critique each other&#x27;s work.

As a design resource, the site provided a library of high-resolution, royalty-free photographs which may be downloaded free of charge for use in design projects. Although images are free, contributors still retain moral rights and photographs are still subject to usage restrictions.

==Stockxpert==

Until 2009, stock.xchng operated alongside its sister site, Stockxpert. Stockxpert was designed with a near-identical user interface, but functioned as a commercial microstock photography site, allowing users, through a system of online credits, to purchase and download images for a very low cost, often as low as US$1.

On the free stock.xchng website, results from the search engine would also bring up a sample of five images from Stockxpert to encourage users to purchase images from Stockxpert. Following the acquisition of Jupiterimages by Getty in 2009, stock.xchng presented search results from Getty&#x27;s own microstock site, iStockphoto.

Stockxpert continued to operate as a separate website until its closure on February 11, 2010.

==Parent companies==

The site was a subsidiary of HAAP Media, which was the stock photography division of Dream Interactive. In 2008, HAAP was acquired by the stock photo company Jupiterimages. In February 2009, Jupiterimages was purchased by Getty Images, and the stock photo operations of SXC became a joint venture between Getty and Dream Interactive. In December 2009, fhe founders decided to sell their remaining interest in the sites, and later started a similar service, Stockfresh.

<doc id="1015779" wikidata="Q3052302" url="?curid=1015779" title="Wu (Hao)-style tai chi">
<text>Wu (Hao)-style tai chi () is one of the five primary styles of tai chi. It was created in the mid-nineteenth century by Wu Yuxiang, a member of a wealthy and influential family in Yongnian, Hebei, China. Wu trained for approximately ten years with the founder of Yang-style tai chi, and then for over a month with a Chen-style master. Wu also obtained a manual on internal martial arts that formed the core of what are now known as the tai chi classics and include Wu&#x27;s own writing on the subject. From these sources Wu and his family developed their own style, and may also have developed much of the cultural and intellectual foundation of tai chi as well.

Hao Weizhen was a disciple of Wu&#x27;s nephew and was the first person outside the family to master their tai chi. Hao&#x27;s contributions — in developing and spreading the art, and in training the founders of all subsequent Wu (Hao) lineages, as well as the further contributions of his son and grandson — are why many include his surname alongside or in place of Wu&#x27;s when referring to this style.

This Wu style (, Wǔ) is the third-oldest among the five major styles – Chen, Yang, Wu (Hao), Wu (, Wú), and Sun – but is the smallest and least well-known of the five, in part because Wu Yuxiang and his family had no need to teach professionally. It is best known for its small- and medium-frame forms, as well as its emphasis on the core tai chi concept of &quot;open-close&quot; or &quot;kai he&quot; (), and so is also known as Kai He tai chi ().

==History==

===Wu Yuxiang===
Wu Yuxiang began training with Yang Luchan, the founder of Yang-style tai chi, in the early 1840s after Yang returned to Yongnian from his years in the Chen village. Among their many properties the Wu family were the landlords of Chen Dehu&#x27;s pharmacy and clinic, where Yang offered instruction in what he then called &quot;soft boxing&quot; (), &quot;cotton boxing&quot; (), or &quot;neutralizing boxing&quot; (). But in the early 1850s, Wu and his family introduced Yang as martial arts instructor to a prominent family in distant Beijing, where Yang was invited to take up a teaching position at the palace of Prince Duan.

Wu then found his way to Chen Qingping, a master of Chen-style and Zhaobao tai chi, in Zhaobao village where he trained with Chen for over one month (per writings left by Wu&#x27;s nephew and grandson). After approximately ten years of training with Yang, Wu was likely able to quickly master a great deal from Chen, gaining further depth and insight.

From this training Wu began to develop his own style, which he shared with members of his extended family. He and his family were wealthy gentry, some of them government officials but none in military careers at that time, and had no need to teach martial arts for professional or financial purposes. They seem to have pursued tai chi primarily as a means of self-cultivation, and possibly for self-defense and leadership in a time of widespread civil breakdown and unrest including banditry, anti-landlord uprisings, and the Nian and Taiping rebellions.

===The tai chi classics===

In the early 1850s Wu&#x27;s eldest brother Chengqing (, also known as Wu Qiuying, ; 1800-1884) was serving as a government official in Henan, when he obtained a manual on the principles of internal martial arts. In the writings of the next generation, this was tersely reported as having been received at &quot;a salt shop&quot;, with the assumption that any reader would understand the context of that statement. Salt merchants were wealthy and of equal social status with an official like Wu Chengqing. At least one scholar speculates that the owner of that shop may have been a fellow book collector who had learned of the Wu family&#x27;s interest in the topic, and was seeking to curry favor with Chengqing who among other things was in charge of tax collection.

Authorship of the manuscript was attributed to a Wang Zongyue of Shanxi, about whom no information is available in verifiable historical records. (Some have suggested Wang Zongyue could be a pseudonym of Wu Yuxiang or another Wu family member, but the writing style is different and the mundane salt shop story – as opposed to, say, claiming an immortal sage found it in an enchanted cave – lends believability as well.) Wu Chengqing passed the manual on to Wu Yuxiang, who discussed it with his friend and teacher Yang Luchan. Yang agreed it was important. Over the following years, Wu and his family applied the lessons of this text to the development of their art and created a body of written work around it, which together became known as the first version of the tai chi classics.

Wu&#x27;s nephew and top disciple Li Yiyu (; 1832–1892) contributed several texts to the final collection. Wu&#x27;s older brothers Chengqing and Ruqing (; 1803-1887) also wrote on the topic after they retired from government service, though those works along with more by Li Yiyu were not made public until the 1980s and 1990s, so have been called &quot;lost classics&quot;. Wu likely also shared his writings with Yang Luchan, and with Yang&#x27;s son Yang Banhou, who Wu tutored (probably in literacy as well as tai chi). Although the Wu and Yang lineages appear to have drifted apart by the next generation, in the early twentieth century Yang Chengfu&#x27;s disciples began to publish their own versions of these texts with their own additions, and began to call them the &quot;tai chi classics&quot;.

====The name of tai chi====

The term &quot;&quot;taijiquan&quot; (the Chinese name of tai chi) may have first appeared in the Wu/Li family&#x27;s mid-nineteenth century writings, perhaps drawn from the Wang Zongyue text which begins with the words &quot;Taiji&quot; is born from &quot;Wuji&quot;; it is the mother of &quot;Yin and Yang&quot;&quot;. As the Wu family had no need to promote their art, it was left to the Yangs to bring this to the public first. But with different priorities, especially as the two families drifted apart (or worse) by the second generation, they often felt no need to mention each other at all which is why few knew of this.

Yang family tradition tells us only that imperial court scholar Weng Tonghe used the term &quot;taiji&quot; (tai chi) in a poem to describe a performance by Yang Luchan. It is not clear if that was an additional influence on the name, or if the new name was already in use there, along with the earlier names &quot;Thirteen Postures&quot; (), &quot;Long Boxing&quot;(), and &quot;Soft/Cotton/Neutralizing Boxing&quot; (). Written evidence that the Yang family had started using the name &quot;taiji&quot; for their martial art first appears in a later text, possibly completed in 1875 by Yang Luchan&#x27;s son Yang Banhou (who had been tutored by Wu Yuxiang), or no later than the first decade of the twentieth century by one or more of Yang Banhou&#x27;s disciples.

By the second decade of the twentieth century, Yang Chengfu&#x27;s disciples and Sun Lutang were using the term &quot;taijiquan&quot; in their publications, including in the titles of some of the tai chi classics. It then appeared in a book by a Chen family member, Chen Xin, published after he died in 1929. This timeline may represent the origin and history of the adoption of this name — from Wu to Yang to Wu (), then Sun, then Chen — but with no record of verbal usage we have no way of knowing for sure.

====The legend of Zhang Sanfeng====

The Wu family wrote of many other connections between the art and traditional Chinese culture, with the writings of eldest brother Wu Chengqing especially showing his interest in Daoism when he was not occupied with his official Confucian responsibilities. Scholars believe Wu Yuxiang passed along to his successors and to the Yang family the story of the creation of internal martial arts by legendary Daoist alchemist Zhang Sanfeng.

For Wu Yuxiang and the seventeenth century authors he likely drew from, that story may have been primarily an anti-Manchu political allegory. There is no mention of Zhang in original Chen village documents, and although Wu&#x27;s nephew and disciple Li Yiyu did write about Zhang, in a later piece written in 1881 Li stated &quot;The creator of tai chi is unknown&quot;.

But with Wu Yuxiang most likely having planted the seeds of this tradition, supplementary chapters on internal martial arts attributed to Zhang were appended to the above-mentioned work by Yang Banhou or his disciples, and by the early twentieth century publications by Yang Chengfu&#x27;s disciples and Sun Lutang proclaimed Zhang Sanfeng creator of tai chi itself. In Yang-style editions Zhang was also named as author of one of the tai chi classics.

===Li Yiyu and Hao Weizhen===

&quot;Wu Yuxiang taught reading as a hobby, and Li Yiyu practiced medicine as a profession. They both considered themselves to be members of the literati, and in their hometown taught very few students. Li&#x27;s best student was his neighbor, Hao He, known by the courtesy name Weizhen.&quot; —Gu Liuxin
Wu Yuxiang practiced his tai chi with his older brothers, and his only disciples were his nephews Li Yiyu and Li Qixuan (, Simplified Chinese , 1835-1899). Li Yiyu became a prominent voice speaking to us from the past through his writing on tai chi, and he was the first to teach this style to anyone outside the family. Wealthy and occupied for many years with establishing and running a smallpox clinic, he devoted much of his spare time to practicing, researching, and further developing the art with his uncle Yuxiang and brother Qixuan, but also took on as a disciple his neighbor Hao Weizhen, for whom he made one of only three handwritten copies of the Wu/Li family tai chi manual.

Hao Weizhen became a well-known master and professional instructor, further refining the art and developing his own solo form (see the Characteristics section below). Closely associated with the martial arts community in Hebei, including Yang Zhaolin (; 1884-1922) the eldest grandson of Yang Luchan, beginning in 1914 he also taught in Beijing where his students included Sun Lutang, the founder of Sun-style tai chi, and in Yongnian that same year Hao led the first tai chi program in a public middle/high school. Hao&#x27;s contributions – in developing and spreading the art, and in training the founders of all subsequent Wu (Hao) lineages, as well as the further contributions of his son and grandson – are why many include his surname when referring to this style.

==Lineage==
The Wu (Hao) lineage () is represented today by at least a dozen branches () with many smaller offshoots. The four largest branches are listed here, named for the purposes of this article as follows:
* Li family branch
* Hao family branch
* Li Shengduan branch
* Li Baoyu (Li Xiangyuan) branch

The founders of these branches trained under Hao Weizhen, but the first branch in the list traces lineage directly back to the original Wu and Li families. Li family descendants still teach, but no direct descendant of the Wu or Hao families has a leading role in the art today.

Although Sun style is considered a descendant () of Wu (Hao) style because the founder learned tai chi from Hao Weizhen, that style is covered in a separate article and not included here.

&quot;(Article continues below lineage tree)&quot;

===Lineage tree===

===Li family branch===
This branch uses the name &quot;Wu-style tai chi&quot; (), sometimes spelled &quot;Wuu&quot; in translation to indicate the pronunciation. Some have referred to it as &quot;Li Frame&quot; () or &quot;Northern Branch&quot;, and we discuss those names below, but members of this lineage do not use those labels themselves today. They also do not include the name Hao because their lineage includes family bonds to the original Li and Wu families, but Hao Weizhen did help train founder Li Xunzhi (, 1882–1944). Xunzhi was ten years old when his father Li Yiyu died, and so completed his training under his elder brothers and his elder &quot;martial brother&quot; Hao Weizhen.

Li Xunzhi&#x27;s sons were key disciples, including Li Jinfan (; 1920-1991), and the lineage continued on through his grandsons and other family members, but among his most well-known disciples were also Wei Peilin (; 1913-1961) and Yao Jizu (; 1917-1998).

Wei was rising to prominence with the National Sports Commission before he died while still in his forties. Yao led prominent tai chi organizations and schools, and published many books and articles, including (&quot;The Complete Book of Wu Style Taijiquan&quot;), which covers this lineage&#x27;s forms and other training practices. That serves as their core handbook, supplemented with books and articles by fifth generation grandmaster Zhai Weichuan (; 1942-) and others, including Zhai&#x27;s book (&quot;Wu Style 37-Posture Taijiquan&quot;) on the simplified form he developed for busy beginners. This lineage has continued to develop shorter forms, including a 28-posture routine, consistent with trends and standards in the field. They generally practice in middle frame, with small frame training for advanced students.

Grandmaster Zhai was a disciple of Wei Peilin until Wei died, and then became a disciple of Yao Jizu. Zhai is currently the president of the Yongnian Yuxiang Taiji Research Institute (), headquartered in Yongnian with branches in Hangzhou, Tianjin, Shijazhuang, and other places in China, and has taught in many more locations nationwide. His son Zhai Shizong () is managing director and a master instructor there.

In 1999 Zhai Weichuan founded a 1,000-student primary school centered around tai chi. Tens of thousands of adult tai chi students have also participated in his training programs, including groups from abroad, and he has accepted 140 formal disciples. In 2020 he appeared in the film submitted by China to place tai chi on the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage List, representing the &quot;Wuu&quot; style.

Zhong Zhenshan (钟振山, 1949-), another fifth generation grandmaster, is perhaps better known in the West than most representatives of this lineage. Born in Yongnian, he became disciple of Yao Jizu at age 13. He has written over twenty articles on tai chi, and assisted Yao Jizu in compiling (&quot;The Complete Book of Wu Style Taijiquan&quot;). With others of his lineage generation, he helped develop the Wu-style competition and simplified forms. Winner of several gold medals in tai chi contests, he was appointed general instructor for a thousand-person tai chi performance, and has been officially recognized for his accomplishments. He has trained many disciples and students in China, and has led workshops and advised Wu-style organizations in North America as well.

This lineage practices a 108-posture empty-hand form, as well as simplified and competition forms, sword and staff forms, push hands, and other aspects of the art. More about forms and partner work is in the Characteristics section.

===Hao family branch===
In the past this branch often used the name &quot;Wu-style tai chi&quot; (), with some attempts to clarify by calling it &quot;Hao Frame&quot; () or &quot;Hao School&quot; (), resulting in longer locutions like &quot;Wu Style Hao Family tai chi&quot; (). But over time the trend has been to call it &quot;Wu (Hao) tai chi&quot; () or even simply &quot;Hao Family tai chi&quot; (). The branch was founded by Hao Weizhen&#x27;s son Hao Yueru (; 1877-1935) and grandson Hao Shaoru (; 1907-1983), who brought the art from Yongnian to the Nanjing region and Shanghai in 1930, at a time when many martial artists followed the Chinese government and economy to those areas.

They also made changes to their art consistent with developments happening in many tai chi styles and other martial arts at the time, to bring the benefits of tai chi to a wider range of people. Building on the form created by his father Hao Weizhen, Hao Yueru developed a 96-posture small frame form and his son Hao Shaoru developed a shortened 49 posture version of the same form, both designed to be accessible to people who practice tai chi primarily for health, while still offering a martial core with lessons on internal power and other advanced aspects of the art to intermediate and advanced students. This lineage is known for their focus on the internal aspects of &quot;yi&quot; (, &quot;intention&quot;) and &quot;qi&quot; (, &quot;energy&quot;) in martial applications.

Hao Shaoru paused his public tai chi teaching in the 1950s, but thanks to his friend Gu Liuxin he was invited by the government to lead a new class in Shanghai in 1960, and in 1963 published the seminal book &quot;Wu Style Taijiquan&quot; () which focused on the 96-movement form. Liu Jishun (, Simplified , 1930-), also known as Jackson Liu, became the second student in that 1960 class. Also a master of &quot;tui na&quot; and other aspects of traditional Chinese medicine, Liu continued training with Hao Shaoru until Hao&#x27;s death in 1983 (though they practiced separately for a few years during the Cultural Revolution), and in 1981 Liu was selected by Hao Shaoru to begin representing the lineage alongside top artists from other tai chi styles at events in Yongnian and elsewhere.

Grandmaster Liu trained a new generation of disciples and other students in China, serving as vice president and then president of the Shanghai Wu Style Taijiquan Research Association in the 1980s. He also accepted disciples from the United Kingdom, including the head of the British Jingwu Athletic Association, Jifu Huang (, 1935-1995), and two more UK disciples who have in turn trained several British national push hands champions and founded Hao-style schools in the UK and Singapore. In 1995 Liu moved to the United States, where he founded the Wu (Hao) Taiji Association of Silicon Valley and trained several disciples there. In 2005 he retired to the San Diego area, where he continued to teach &quot;tui na&quot; and tai chi, and in 2008 and 2012 two English/Chinese books on the Hao family style were issued under his name by a Hong Kong martial arts publisher.

Other Hao Shaoru disciples and students include Pu Gongda (; 1905-1997), a lifelong martial artist who began training with Hao Shaoru in the 1960s, established the Shanghai Wu Style Taijiquan Research Association with Hao in 1983 and served as president of the organization, and trained thousands of students including British and Americans; Hao&#x27;s adopted son Li Weiming (, 1944-), also a master of tui na and traditional Chinese medicine, who began training with Hao Shaoru in 1961 and now teaches in Shanghai and Bangkok; and Hao&#x27;s adopted son Hao Yinru (, 1958-), who changed his name from Wang Muyin () and now teaches in Shanghai. In 1991 Hao Yinru wrote a new foreword to a new edition of Hao Shaoru&#x27;s book, &quot;Wu Style Taijiquan&quot; ().

In addition to the 49- and 96-posture small frame forms, advanced students in this lineage also learn the old form of Hao Weizhen in small frame, as well as staff/pole training, straight sword, push hands, and other aspects of the art. More about forms in the Characteristics section.

===Li Shengduan branch===
This branch currently uses the name &quot;Wu (Hao) tai chi&quot; or &quot;Wu Hao tai chi&quot; (). The founder, Li Shengduan (; 1888-1948), of Xingtai, Hebei, was a disciple of Hao Weizhen and was an accomplished scholar. Descended from China&#x27;s Hui people, he was not related to Li Yiyu. His most prominent disciples were Ma Rong (; 1912-1965), Chen Gu&#x27;an (; 1913-1993), and Wu Wenhan (; 1928-2019).

A scholarly lineage from the start, Li&#x27;s disciples authored many books and articles on tai chi and related subjects, in addition to training many disciples and students of their own. Chen Gu&#x27;an wrote a book on the 108-posture form he standardized for this lineage and another on the Wu (Hao) style staff. Wu Wenhan wrote a book on Wu (Hao)-style applications and edited a comprehensive collection of classic works on tai chi — from Li Yiyu&#x27;s copy of the Wang Zongyue classic through major early twentieth century writers of all tai chi styles — as well as over 200 articles on the history and theory of the art.

Wu Wenhan also researched and released in 1993 previously unknown works by Wu Yuxang&#x27;s eldest brother Wu Chengqing. Those texts, along with other &quot;lost classics&quot; by Li Yiyu, Wu Ruqing, and Yang Banhou first revealed to the public between 1985 and 1993, expanded our understanding of the original history and thought of the founding generations and the tai chi classics.

This lineage continues to thrive in China, and is represented worldwide by Texas-based Grandmaster Jimmy K. Wong (, , Wang Guoqiang, Wong Kokkhang), a disciple of Chen Gu&#x27;an and Wu Wenhan. Their schools practice a small frame 108-posture long form standardized by Chen Gu&#x27;an plus several small frame simplified forms, as well as straight sword, saber, staff, and other aspects of the art. More about forms in the Characteristics section.

===Li Baoyu (Li Xiangyuan) branch===
Focused on the old form of Hao Weizhen, most masters in this lineage call their art &quot;Hao-style tai chi&quot; (). The branch was founded by Li Baoyu (; 1888-1961), who was also known by the courtesy name Li Xiangyuan (). Li was a native of Shunde in what is now Xingtai, Hebei, and was not related to Li Yiyu. Beginning at age 14 he trained under Liu Yingzhou () in San Huang Pao Chui, and then as an adult studied Yang Banhou tai chi under Yang Luchan&#x27;s eldest grandson Yang Zhaolin (; 1884-1922), before mastering Wu (Hao)-style as a disciple of Hao Weizhen.

Small and slightly built, Li Baoyu surprised many challengers, defeating all opponents in and out of the ring including several gangsters. Thrust into a hardscrabble life at an early age, martial arts provided strength and stability, and his prowess earned him the nickname &quot;Spirit Hand () Li&quot;. He established a flour milling business and raised a family, but his many storied martial adventures continued on throughout his life. His most famous student was Dong Yingjie. He coached Dong through a nationally celebrated victory against a British boxer in Nanjing — as the story goes, Li was originally slated to fight that match, but a Chinese gangster working for the British consul temporarily blinded him by throwing lime powder in his eyes — and then taught in Suzhou, Hangzhou, Nanjing, Hebei, Shanxi, and elsewhere, his fame attracting requests for training even from the central government.

Known for his Vajra Palm (), Tai Chi Yin Wind Palm () and Extend Peng Draw Lü Rotation () techniques, he trained several disciples, including Shi Fengchun (), Li Wanquan (), and his good friend the Daoist adept Li Jianxing () who was also a master of traditional Chinese medicine. Li Baoyu&#x27;s daughter Li Guihua (), also a disciple, collaborated on a manual of their Hao style and on a novel about the heroic exploits of her father and his friends that includes the story of intrigue surrounding the famous match in Nanjing.

His disciples established teaching lineages in Hebei and Shanxi, and on the national stage his disciple Ouyang Fang () represented Wu (Hao)-style in an official 1977 government film of the major tai chi styles, performing the Hao Weizhen form. Li Baoyu&#x27;s friend and student Dong Yingjie included that form, along with fast forms Dong developed in part by incorporating postures and principles he learned from Li, in the advanced curriculum of Dong family tai chi taught today in over twenty countries around the world. More about these forms is in the Characteristics section below.

===The rectification of (branch) names===

&quot;When Wu-style tai chi spread to Beijing in the first years of the Republic, some people called it &#x27;Li frame&#x27;, then when Weizhen&#x27;s son Yueru and grandson Shaoru went to teach in Nanjing and Shanghai in 1928, people also called it &#x27;Hao frame&#x27;.&quot; - Gu Liuxin

As the Hao family began to spread this style to the public, some confusion resulted. When Hao Weizhen traveled to Beijing in 1914 to teach his middle frame form, he humbly presented himself as a disciple of Li Yiyu. But in 1930 when his son and grandson moved to the Nanjing and Shanghai areas to teach their unique small frame forms, they were more forward about taking credit. And so the Wu-style form created by Hao Weizhen was sometimes called &quot;Li frame&quot; (), while the next-generation Wu-style forms created by his descendants were called &quot;Hao frame&quot; ().

Some also attempted to clarify this by referring to the Li family lineage as the &quot;Northern&quot; branch, and schools of the Hao family beginning with Hao Yueru as the &quot;Southern&quot; branch, though for much of their lives they were all based in Hebei. The other lineages founded by the unrelated masters surnamed Li were also sometimes lumped together as &quot;Northern&quot;.

Those terms are seldom used today. The Li family lineage has long since committed to using only the name &quot;Wu-style&quot;, while the other branches began using variations such as &quot;Wu Hao-style&quot; and &quot;Hao-style&quot; more often over time, as described in the above sections on Lineage. The topic of Northern and Southern Chinese martial arts generally refers to a much broader geography and time frame than the early twentieth century context of Beijing vs. Nanjing/Shanghai, and in that wider context all styles of tai chi are considered &quot;Northern&quot;.

==Characteristics==
Wu Yuxiang&#x27;s style is unlike Chen style, old or new frame, and unlike Yang style, large or small frame. After he learned those styles, he created a new system that offers these unique points: compact postures, slow relaxed movements, and footwork that strictly and clearly distinguishes empty and solid. Chest and belly are kept neutral in advancing, retreating, and turning, completely relying on the internal movement between empty and solid to transform and dominate external forces with &quot;internal qi and hidden change&quot;. — Gu Liuxin

===Compact frame===

Tai chi styles are often categorized by their &quot;frame size&quot;, which describes how far the body is extended for small, medium, or large overall reach. Wu (Hao) is practiced primarily in small and middle frame. In describing small frame, Gu Liuxin wrote &quot;the left and right hands each control half the body; they do not cross the center line, and they do not extend beyond the tips of the feet&quot;. Medium frame is, of course, midway between that and the fully extended large frame.

Wu (Hao) began as a middle frame style, and the Li family lineage continues to practice primarily in middle frame, though they also train advanced students in small frame as well.

The Hao family lineage is known for their small frame. Their forms and other practice focus on small frame movements, including the old form of Hao Weizhen which they modified for small frame practice.

The Li Shengduan lineage also focuses on small frame practice, while the Li Baoyu lineage teaches the old form of Hao Weizhen and advanced techniques in middle frame, though the Dong family branch has trended towards large frame over time.

===Traditional and simplified forms===

Wu (Hao)-style forms have undergone five stages of development since the nineteenth century, and since the third generation have often been called &quot;kai he&quot; () forms in reference to their focus on &quot;opening and closing&quot; movements.

First- and second-generation Forms

The earliest written records we have of this style&#x27;s forms are in Li Yiyu&#x27;s own hand. In 1881 he recorded a first-generation form consisting of 53 to 55 postures, the count varying as he worked to improve the description. He and his brother Li Qixuan continued working on improvements to the training for the rest of their lives, developing a second-generation 67-posture form. The larger total resulted from separately counting subpostures, such as left and right versions of the same posture, and some additional postures.

Among other core tai chi principles, opening and closing movements were emphasized in this style from the beginning, however in the first two generations&#x27; forms the postures named specifically for that concept were referred to not as &quot;kai he&quot;, but with a literary term, &quot;zhuan he&quot; (. Some have continued to use that older phrase; see the Comparisons section below for more detail on this topic).

Third generation: the Kai He form

Li Yiyu&#x27;s top disciple Hao Weizhen created a form that is usually taught as a sequence of 81 to 88 postures. Hao was the first to use the term &quot;kai he&quot;, or &quot;opening and closing&quot;, in the names of specific movements in a form, drawing from Li Yiyu&#x27;s writing on theory (discussed further below). As a result, this has often been called &quot;the Kai He form&quot; and at times the entire style has been called &quot;Kai He tai chi&quot; ().

This is the oldest Wu (Hao) form still widely practiced today. As performed in many schools it is still representative of the early forms with its upright middle frame and its clearly martial aspect. The sequence, in most of the posture names at least, is familiar to practitioners of Yang and other styles. In Wu (Hao) schools that no longer practice it regularly, its influence is visible to the trained eye in the fourth generation and Sun-style forms. However, some lineages or branches that still practice this form have modified certain aspects to align with their curriculums. 

In 1914 when Hao Weizhen first taught in Beijing, this form was performed in about eight or nine minutes, the same speed at which Yang Chengfu and Wu Jianquan were timed doing their own long forms that decade in largely the same sequences we know today. All these forms were performed at a varying slow-swift tempo then, usually with jumps and fa jin. The 1977 film of Li Baoyu disciple Ouyang Fang&#x27;s performance of this form is like a time capsule for us, with few if any changes from the original he&#x27;d begun learning almost fifty years before. In the early twentieth century, tai chi forms were still intended for martial artists who also spent long hours each day training on individual moves and their applications, often after years of experience in other martial arts.

Yang Chengfu and Wu Jianquan modified their primary training forms to a slow even speed, removing jumps and fa jin, to make the art more accessible for the health of the broader public with the encouragement of government officials. But Hao Weizhen&#x27;s form retained speed, jumps, and fa jin for decades, because the next generations developed other forms to meet the new goals.

The Li Baoyu lineage has preserved this form relatively unchanged, as documented in the 1998 book 郝式太极拳 (&quot;Hao Style Taijiquan&quot;) written in collaboration with Li Baoyu&#x27;s daughter Li Guihua. It is practiced with some minor variations among schools in Hebei and Shanxi, where it is taught at a steady training pace of about fourteen minutes and at the faster nine-minute pace as well. Only in the worldwide Dong family tai chi branch is the focus only on a slowed down and smoothed out pace.

Because this is the only Wu (Hao) form in the Dong family curriculum, they perform in about eighteen minutes or more with only a few optional fast movements, giving advanced students time to focus on the unique Wu (Hao)-style internal training it offers. The original slow-swift tempo is instead available in the Dong family fast forms, which include sections that incorporate techniques and principles Dong Yingjie learned from Li Baoyu.

In addition, as practiced by the Dong family branch the postures are slightly forward-inclined, in a larger frame, and with Dong Yingjie&#x27;s signature &quot;iron finger&quot; hands. Internally, practitioners focus on bringing energy to the outside perimeter of the body in all directions, so that unlike the classic Yang-style metaphor of &quot;an iron bar wrapped in cotton&quot; this is more like &quot;a crab shell on the outside, and soft inside&quot;. This remains a &quot;soft-style&quot; form with a focus on internal strength and structure, developed by cultivating &quot;fullness&quot; rather than stretching or external strength, but the Dong lineage call this their &quot;hard form&quot; to contrast it with their primary Yang-style &quot;soft form&quot;. Their formal names for it remain &quot;the Kai He form&quot; and &quot;the Hao form&quot;.

The Hao family lineage modified this form as well: they made it small frame, to align it with their next-generation forms. It retains vigorous features including speed, a jump kick, and some fa jin. It is taught to advanced students, and although Grandmaster Liu Jishun stated in a 1999 interview that it is taught at a fourteen-minute training pace, he also published a DVD in 2005 showing that once mastered it can still be performed in less than nine minutes or even under five minutes, in the classic slow-swift tempo.

Fourth generation: new traditional forms

In the first half of the twentieth century the forms got longer still, but with a change in focus: creating routines for the broader public and not just for martial artists.

The first was Hao Yueru&#x27;s 96-movement small frame form. Gu Liuxin gave these examples of changes in that form: &quot;Originally there were also jumping movements until the fourth generation teacher Hao Yueru (1877-1935) removed them. The &#x27;Double-Slap Swinging Lotus&#x27; was also changed so that there is no slapping of the top of the foot. These were adaptations made for the needs of the old and infirm.&quot;

Accessible to &quot;the old and infirm&quot;, yes, and Hao Shaoru did say it was a &quot;qigong quan&quot; (), but it still contains a martial arts core, with lessons on the applications of internal strength and other topics for intermediate and advanced students. The Hao family lineage is known for their focus on &quot;yi&quot; () as well as &quot;qi&quot; (&quot;energy&quot;), with masters demonstrating the use of their small and seemingly soft movements to launch opponents into the air and across the room just as well as masters of other lineages often do.

Next were two 108-movement routines. Like the Hao Yueru 96 form, these are now considered the traditional long forms of their respective lineages.

The Li family lineage (as we have named them for the purposes of this article), under Wei Peilin, Yao Jizu, and others, standardized a 108-posture form, in middle frame with no jump kicks or other immediately strenuous movements. Advanced students are introduced to &quot;fa jin&quot; movements and other aspects of internal strength in the form, and also learn to practice in small frame as well as a &quot;Pao Chui&quot; version with more &quot;fa jin&quot;.

In the Li Shengduan lineage, Chen Gu&#x27;an standardized another 108-movement form in a small frame approach that, as with the others of this generation, is accessible to a wider range of people yet contains martial training for intermediate and advanced students. This is the traditional long form taught today by Jimmy K. Wong and other disciples of that lineage, with a focus on internal strength and structure.

Fifth generation: simplified and competition forms

The era of shortened / simplified Wu (Hao) forms began in the mid-twentieth century with Hao Shaoru&#x27;s 49-movement routine. Requiring only about 10 minutes to perform, as compared to approximately 25 minutes for the full 96-movement version, it is taught to beginners and used for public demonstrations.

Wu (Hao)-style masters were not included in the development of the 24-movement Simplified Form published in 1956, which was composed entirely of Yang-style postures, nor the 48-movement Combined Form of 1976 which included postures from Chen-, Yang-, Wu- (, Wú), and Sun-style and was later condensed into the 42-movement Competition Form in 1989.

But in 1995 a Wu (, Wǔ)-style 46-movement Competition Form was finalized by a committee led by (as we have named them for the purposes of this article) the Li family lineage. That form was formally published and officially adopted by the national standards committee in 1996. Then in 2006 Zhai Weichuan of the same lineage published his 6-minute 37-movement simplified form to make tai chi available to a wider swath of the public. He and his disciples have since developed shorter forms, including a 28-posture routine, consistent with national trends and standards.

Meanwhile the Li Shengduan lineage, led abroad by Jimmy K. Wong, has developed simplified forms in 36, 32, 24, 13, and 8 movements. These are similar in length to new short forms developed by other styles at the behest of China&#x27;s national standards committees.

Weapons forms and partner routines

Wu (Hao)-style weapons forms include, with some variation among the lineages and individual schools, straight sword (), saber/broadsword, and long pole (, gǎn). Although spear methods () are mentioned in a 19th-century manual by Li Yiyu, they are seldom practiced today. However the pole forms and drills for one and two persons include many spear-like movements, similar to the sticking and thrusting pole practice of the Yang and Chen styles, but without the many rotations of Chen-style spear forms.

These forms share many other similarities with Yang-style weapons forms, and may be closely related. In some Hao family schools the straight sword form is almost exactly the same as the Yang-style version. In the Li family lineage, although their straight sword form is a different sequence, their two-person saber set is quite similar to a set practiced by some Yang-style branches and may be related via Yang Banhou. This is worthy of more research.

Partner work includes stationary and stepping push hands (, tuīshǒu), as well as two-person sparring routines and freestyle grappling (, sàndǎ). Wu Yuxiang and his family preferred moving over stationary partner practice. Further discussion of push hands theory is in the Comparisons section below. As mentioned above there are also two-person weapons sets for saber and staff.

===The 13 Important Points===

The tai chi classics of the Wu (Hao) style include a list of thirteen important points for every practitioner to keep in mind. Wu Yuxiang compiled the first eight, the &quot;body methods&quot; (, shēnfǎ), while Li Yiyu added the final five &quot;essentials&quot; (, Simplified , yāolǐng). All Wu (Hao) lineages agree on the importance of this list for each and every movement, though some list them in a slightly different order. Following is a translation of the list as taught by Liu Jishun, grandmaster of the Hao family lineage.

===Comparisons: Chen and Yang (and the origin of Kai He)===

Wu (Hao)-style tai chi is based on principles shared with other styles, especially Yang style. For example, Yang Chengfu&#x27;s &quot;Ten Essential Points&quot; are quite similar to the Wu (Hao)-style &quot;Thirteen Important Points&quot; listed above, and in fact Wu Yuxiang has been named as the source of the Yang essential points list by some writers in the Yang-style lineage. Chen-style masters also teach these essentials with a few additional points, most notably the concept of internal spiral energy paths.

Like Yang-style, Wu (Hao)-style focuses on &quot;pulling silk&quot; (, , chōusījìn) rather than the Chen-style &quot;reeling silk&quot; (, , chánsījìn), and Wu (Hao) shares with Yang the focus on &quot;sinking qi to the dantian&quot; (, ) rather than the Chen emphasis on dantian rotation (, ). But all tai chi styles contain all of these principles, varied only by emphasis.

Other points of comparison include the many posture names and sequences in the empty-hand forms that are shared with Yang style and a few with Chen style, and the similarities with Yang-style weapons forms noted above, as well as similarities and differences on fundamental principles such as the Wu (Hao) style&#x27;s focus on shifting and sinking vs. the Yang style&#x27;s focus on shifting and twisting, though both styles contain all of those internal principles, just as all styles require the practitioner to clearly distinguish between &quot;empty and solid&quot; (, , xūshí) weighting during those movements.

Shared principles aside, much of the Wu (Hao) approach is evidence of an independent evolution and can provide a new perspective for students of other styles. For example, in their forms where Yang stylists perform their signature moves of Commencing (qǐshì, , ) and Stroke Peacock&#x27;s Tail&#x27;s (, ) &quot;péng lǚ jǐ àn&quot; (), the Wu (Hao) forms instead perform Commencing and Lazily Bind the Cloak (lǎn zā yī, , ). In name that would seem to derive from the Chen style, but in this style that sequence is different from both Yang and Chen, with a unique approach to internal alignment.

Beginning with Hao Weizhen, the internals of those movements have been named as: 

and these can also be applied to every posture in the form.

Furthermore, Yao Jizu taught that all tai chi movements contain these principles: 
This is not to say that Wu (Hao)-style masters haven&#x27;t from the beginning also taught the four directions &quot;péng lǚ jǐ àn&quot; and the four corners &quot;cǎi liè zhǒu kào&quot; (), at least in the context of pushing hands, as they have for example in the Pushing Hands Ditty () transmitted by Li Yiyu, and in Wu Chengqing&#x27;s recommendation to begin partner training with péng, lōu (), and zhǒu (the Wu family&#x27;s alternate terms for the same moves), as well as Hao Weizhen&#x27;s mention of pushing hands in his advice to Sun Lutang, through more recent works such as Yao Jizu&#x27;s chapter on pushing hands which shows the continued importance of the four directions and four corners by beginning with a basic push hands set in the pattern of &quot;péng, lōu, zhǒu, àn&quot;.

Yet for Wu (Hao) stylists, the most fundamental concept is &quot;kai he&quot;. Other styles of tai chi and other internal martial arts also give attention to the importance of opening and closing in all movements, but Li Yiyu was the first to specifically call it kai he in his &quot;Treatise on the Diagram of Substantial/Insubstantial and Opening/Closing&quot;, and Wu (Hao) masters have uniquely made this concept their central focus.

It took some time for Li&#x27;s terminology to be adopted, however. The first two generations both called the internal aspects of Commencing and Lazily Bind the Cloak by the terms &quot;qǐ chéng zhuǎn hē&quot;, with &quot;zhuǎn&quot; (, ) meaning &quot;to turn&quot;, &quot;to change direction&quot;, or &quot;to circle about&quot;. This is evidence of the origins of Wu (Hao) style with a family of the literati social class, as &quot;qǐ chéng zhuǎn hē&quot; is also the structure of classical Chinese essays required for the imperial examinations, as well as classical poetry. In modern times it has spread across East Asia as the structure of narratives such as screenplays, and is known in Japanese as &quot;Kishōtenketsu&quot; ().

But when Li Yiyu&#x27;s student Hao Weizhen began spreading the art to the broader public, he refined his teaching for practical application by replacing &quot;zhuǎn&quot; with &quot;kāi&quot;. Since then most masters have used the term &quot;kai he&quot;, and in fact at times the entire style has been called &quot;Kai He tai chi&quot;. However others, including Wu Wenhan of the Li Shengduan lineage, preserved the old terms in their teachings.

The unique focus on &quot;zhuan he&quot; / &quot;kai he&quot; in Wu (Hao) practice sets reveals their origin with the Wu/Li family of gentry scholars who cultivated this art among themselves while leading their community through difficult times, and is also a central example of the important contributions of Hao Weizhen.

<doc id="1015781" wikidata="Q6116553" url="?curid=1015781" title="Jackie Moran">
<text>John E. Moran (January 26, 1923 – September 20, 1990) was an American movie actor who, from 1936 to 1946, appeared in over 30 films, primarily in teenage roles.

== Early life and Hollywood career ==
A native of Mattoon, Illinois, Moran first sang in a church choir. He was discovered by Mary Pickford who convinced his mother, a concert singer and father, an attorney, to take him to Hollywood for a screen test in 1935. Billed as Jackie Moran, he was subsequently cast in a number of substantial supporting roles. He became well-known with the 1938 release of David O. Selznick&#x27;s production &quot;The Adventures of Tom Sawyer&quot;. The 93-minute big-budget Technicolor film presented Moran as Huckleberry Finn to Tommy Kelly&#x27;s Tom Sawyer. Jackie Moran received critical praise for his natural acting style.

Jackie Moran went on to star in several youth-oriented films for low-budget and poverty-row studios, such as Republic and Monogram. His most frequent co-star was the one-year-younger Marcia Mae Jones, who appeared with him in 11 films, also including &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot;, where Jones had the relatively minor part of Tom Sawyer&#x27;s cousin Mary. They also played supporting roles in the Deanna Durbin vehicle &quot;Mad About Music&quot;. They played in four Monogram tributes to life in idealized pre-World War II rural America, 1938&#x27;s &quot;Barefoot Boy&quot;, and in 1940, &quot;Tomboy&quot;, &quot;Haunted House&quot; and &quot;The Old Swimmin&#x27; Hole&quot;. The trio of 1940 films were directed by Robert F. McGowan, the former director of &quot;Our Gang&quot;. Most of Jackie and Marcia Mae&#x27;s remaining five films cast them in major supporting roles. Their final entry, after a two-year break, was the 1943 Republic musical &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Darling&quot;, one of the early films helmed by Anthony Mann.

Moran appeared in a cameo in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (1939), where he played the son of Dr. Meade, furious about his brother&#x27;s death as a soldier, and wanting to join the Confederate Army so he can &quot;kill all those Yankees.&quot; Jackie had a co-starring role with Buster Crabbe in Universal&#x27;s 12-chapter serial &quot;Buck Rogers&quot; in which he was third-billed as Buck&#x27;s young friend, Buddy Wade. Jackie&#x27;s next 1939 release was the Hardy Family-like &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Hobby&quot;, while the last, &quot;Spirit of Culver&quot;, a remake of 1932&#x27;s military-school film &quot;Tom Brown of Culver&quot;, teamed him with two former top child stars Jackie Cooper and Freddie Bartholomew. Jackie Moran did not serve in the military during the war and continued to act in movies, including one final appearance in Selznick&#x27;s &quot;Since You Went Away&quot; (1944), where he played a grocer&#x27;s son who exchanges bashful glances with Shirley Temple.

Moran ended his screen career in 1945-1946 with a collection of teenage musical comedies at Columbia and Monogram. He was the title character in Monogram&#x27;s comedy-mystery &quot;There Goes Kelly&quot;, and co-starred with actress June Preisser in Columbia&#x27;s &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Steady&quot; and Monogram&#x27;s &quot;Junior Prom&quot;, &quot;Freddie Steps Out&quot; and &quot;High School Hero&quot;. The latter three were part of a series which also featured Freddie Stewart, Warren Mills, Frankie Darro and Noel Neill. Jackie Moran&#x27;s final movie role was in Columbia&#x27;s college drama &quot;Betty Co-Ed&quot;.

== Later life ==
In 1948, according to his ex-wife Mary Grace McManmon (1921 to 2017), Jack was in jail for allegedly stealing a car, driving it from Los Angeles to Chicago. While in jail he became ill and was hospitalized at the Merchant Marine Hospital in Chicago, Mary was his attending nurse. They married in 1949. After they married, and as stated in his obituary, he worked in public relations as a writer for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Chicago. In 1953, they moved to Culver City, California for Jack to pursue a career in screenwriting. According to anecdotal information from Mary G. Moran, that in spite of Jack &quot;pitching&quot; numerous screenplays to Hollywood producers during the 1950s, or find employment that was satisfactory to him, he was unsuccessful and remained unemployed. It was also written that he wrote songs. Due to excessive gambling at the race track and alcoholism, Jack and Mary divorced in 1971.

Given the anecdotal information from Mary G. Moran, it seems highly unlikely that the screenwriter in the 1960s, by the name of John E. Moran, who worked extensively with Russ Meyer, notably on the films &quot;Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!&quot;, &quot;Good Morning and... Goodbye!&quot;, &quot;Common Law Cabin&quot;, and &quot;Wild Gals of the Naked West&quot;, and also playing small roles in the latter two films is Jackie Moran, the child actor.

Moran moved to Greenfield, Massachusetts in 1984 and wrote the novel &quot;Six Step House&quot;. Six years after his arrival, he died of lung cancer at Franklin Medical Center at the age of 67. As requested in his will, Jackie Moran&#x27;s ashes were scattered on the backstretch of the Del Mar Racetrack, a horse-racing facility in Del Mar, California.

<doc id="1015782" wikidata="Q2292280" url="?curid=1015782" title="Venetian red">
<text>Venetian red is a light and warm (somewhat unsaturated) pigment that is a darker shade of red. The composition of Venetian red changed over time. Originally it consisted of natural ferric oxide (Fe2O3, partially hydrated) obtained from the red hematite. Modern versions are frequently made with synthetic red iron oxide produced via calcination of green vitriol (a.k.a. copperas) mixed with white chalk. The pigment contains up to 50% of the ferric oxide.

Historically, Venetian red was a red earth color often used in Italian Renaissance paintings. It was also called sinopia because the best-quality pigment came from the port of Sinop in northern Turkey. It was the major ingredient in the pigment called &quot;&quot;, described by the 15th-century Italian painter and writer Cennino Cennini in his handbook on painting, &quot;Il libro dell&#x27;arte&quot;. Cennini recommended mixing Venetian red with lime white, in proportions of two to one, to paint the skin tones of faces, hands and nudes.

During the English Civil War (1642–1651), Venetian red was adopted as the primary uniform colour of the New Model Army, to ease mutual identification on the battlefield. In addition, Venetian red was cheaper than other dyes at the time. Following the war, this practice was continued by the British Army, giving its soldiers the nickname &quot;Redcoats&quot;, during the 18th and 19th centuries. Venetian red was replaced as the main colour of British Army battledress by khaki, during the 1890s.

The first recorded use of Venetian red as a color name in English was in 1753. There are many other names for the iron oxide red pigments of different shades, with Spanish red being very similar.

<text>Kopeysk () is a city in Chelyabinsk Oblast, Russia, located southeast of Chelyabinsk. Population: The population growth between 2002 and 2010 was caused by the annexation of surrounding settlements.

==History==
Prior to 1928, this city was called Ugolnye Kopi, meaning &quot;coal mines&quot; (hence the pick on the city&#x27;s coat of arms). The element &quot;Ugolnye&quot; was removed and the suffix &quot;-sk&quot; was added to indicate the locative.

==Economy==
Until the 1990s the main economic sectors were Coal (with mines such as &quot;Capital&quot;,Currently, all the mines are closed due to the low quality of the coal and the high costs of production.
&quot;Komsomolskaya&quot;, &quot;Red Gornyachka&quot;, and &quot;Central&quot;) and mechanical engineering – Kopeysk Machine-Building plant headquarter, the largest producer of coal and salt mining equipment in Russia, is located in this city.
In recent years Kopejsk has developed a diversified economy. The city recorded more than 1,000 industrial enterprises and more than 7,000 private entrepreneurs. Existing companies produce goods such as plastic film, pipes with anticorrosive coating, ceramic proppant for the oil and gas industries, and vegetable oils.

Housing is being constructed, for example in the satellite city of Chelyabinsk.

== Administrative structure ==
Within the administrative-territorial framework of the Chelyabinsk Region, Kopeysk is a city of regional importance, to which three rural settlements are subordinate. Within the context of local government, it constitutes the Kopeysky Urban District, which, in addition to the city, includes three rural localities: the villages of Kalachevo, Zaozerny and Sineglazovo. The city is divided into seven territorial departments, with one more territorial department being organized in the rural settlements that are subordinate to the city (the Kalachevsky district). In total, there are eight territorial departments that are part of the administration of Kopeysk&#x27;s city district:

* Oktyabrsky territorial department
* Potaninsky territorial department
* Railway (Zheleznodorozhny) territorial department
* Vakhrushevsky territorial department
* Starokamyshinsky territorial department
* Kalachevsky territorial department
* Mining (Gornyatsky) territorial department
* Bazhovsky territorial department.

For many years, there has been discussion about joining the city of Kopeysk and later the Kopeysky urban district to become part of the Chelyabinsk (Chelyabinsk City District). The Chelyabinsk media reports that the majority of the population allegedly supports this initiative and is willing to vote in favor of it in a referendum. However, the heads and employees of municipal authorities have been categorically opposed due to fear of losing their homes. Pressure is being exerted on municipal institutions and companies with the requirement to cease supporting this initiative.

<text>Inori (Japanese for &quot;Adorations&quot;), for one or two soloists with orchestra, is a composition by Karlheinz Stockhausen, written in 1973–74 (Nr. 38 in the composer&#x27;s catalog of works).

== History ==
&quot;Inori&quot; is a meditative work. The word &quot;inori&quot; (祈り) in Japanese means &quot;prayer, invocation, adoration&quot;. &quot;It is like an opera with only one character and no singing, only thoughts visible as gesture and audible as reciprocally modulated sound&quot;. &quot;The solo part is composed as a melody and is theoretically performable by a melody instrument; however the relationship between solo gesture and orchestra response is so complete that the solo melody is invariably interpreted in silence by a dancer-mime, employing a vocabulary of gestures drawn from a variety of religious practices&quot;. The Australian dancer and choreographer Philippa Cullen, who spent some time in Germany working with Stockhausen in 1973, is credited with drawing his attention to choreographic prayer gestures, in particular the mudras of India, which she had been studying.

&quot;&quot;Inori&quot; is indeed, as the composer insists, a mystical work, but only because there is absolutely no mystification&quot;. &quot;Stockhausen recomposed the sign-language of praying, on the basis of chromatic scales of prayer gestures, into a highly differentiated bodily music&quot;. Although the score specifies that the soloist part may be performed in any number of ways, including any kind of melodic instrument, to date this has always been performed by mimes, using a set of prayer gestures. Because audiences at early performances were mistakenly perceiving the soloist as improvising to the music, Stockhausen decided to use two parallel soloists in order to make it obvious that the gestures are fully composed.

Stockhausen composed &quot;Inori&quot; using an &quot;Urgestalt&quot; or formula, which is &quot;a melodic-rhythmic structure from which the principal characteristics of the work are derived&quot;. This melodic formula is divided into five segments, forming a sequence “leading from pure rhythm . . . via dynamics, melody, and harmony, to polyphony:—hence, a progression from the primitive origin of music to a condition of pure intellect. The entire work is a projection of this formula onto a duration of about 70 minutes”. The formula consists of 15 notes, which are divided into 5 phrases with 5, 3, 2, 1 and 4 pitches respectively. Transferred to the large scale form, these 5 phrases yield the 5 major sections of the work. Each phrase consists . . . of three parts: melody, echo and pause; in the large scale form these become genesis+evolution (=exposition + development)—echo—pause, the echoes being very soft statistical passages, and the &#x27;pauses minimally accompanied solos for the mime. The durations of the melody, measured in crotchets, are converted into minutes to give the lengths of formal divisions and subdivisions. 
The most important of the 15 pitches is the G above middle C, which corresponds to the tempo MM = 71 (the &quot;heartbeat&quot; tempo of medieval music theory), to the hand gesture positioned over the heart, and to the syllable &quot;HU&quot;, representing the Divine Name.

In addition to these five sections, there is &quot;an unmeasured, transcendental moment&quot;.

Stockhausen also composed an introduction to &quot;Inori&quot;, &quot;Vortrag über HU&quot; (&quot;Lecture on HU&quot;), Nr. 38½, an hour-long musical analysis of the work, for performance by a singer.

<text>The International Republican Institute (IRI) is an American nonprofit organization founded in 1983 and funded and supported by the United States federal government. Most of its board is drawn from the Republican Party. Its public mission is to advance freedom and democracy worldwide by helping political parties to become more issue-based and responsive, assisting citizens to participate in government planning, and working to increase the role of marginalized groups in the political process, including women and youth. It has been repeatedly accused of foreign interference and has been implicated in the 2004 Haitian coup d&#x27;état. It was initially known as the National Republican Institute for International Affairs.

IRI&#x27;s programs include assisting political parties and candidates develop their values and institutional structures, good governance practices, civil society development, civic education, women&#x27;s and youth leadership development, electoral reform and election monitoring, and political expression in closed societies. Since its founding, IRI has been active globally in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, Eastern Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East.

In 2018, U.S. Senator John McCain, who served as IRI&#x27;s chairman of the board for 25 years, informed IRI&#x27;s board of directors that he was stepping down. McCain recommended U.S. Senator Dan Sullivan to succeed him.

== History ==
IRI was founded in 1983 following then U.S. President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s 1982 speech before the British Parliament in Westminster in which he proposed a broad objective of helping countries build the infrastructure of democracy. Quoting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Reagan said, &quot;we must be staunch in our conviction that freedom is not the sole prerogative of a lucky few but the inalienable and universal right of all human beings.&quot;

IRI operates globally, providing training and assistance to political parties. As a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization, IRI plays no part in domestic U.S. politics. However, the majority of its board are drawn from the Republican Party. Its sister organization, the National Democratic Institute, draws mainly from the Democratic Party.

===IRI Freedom Award===

In 1995, IRI established the Freedom Award &quot;to honor individuals who have worked to advance freedom and democracy in their countries and around the world&quot;. Its first recipient was Alfredo Cristiani, who served as President of El Salvador from 1989 to 1994. Other recipients have included Miguel Obando y Bravo, the Archbishop of Managua from 1970 to 2005, Ronald Reagan, the 40th President of the United States, Aung San Suu Kyi, the State Counsellor and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Myanmar, Soviet dissident Natan Sharansky, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the President of Liberia from 2006 to 2018, and others.

=== 2004 Haitian coup ===

IRI received funding for its Haiti programs from USAID from 2002 until 2004. IRI ended its Haiti program in summer 2007.

On January 29, 2006, Canadian Broadcasting Corporation television premiered a documentary film about the IRI&#x27;s role in the coup, &quot;Haiti: Democracy Undone&quot;.

Brian Dean Curran, U.S. Ambassador at the time and a former Clinton appointee, accused IRI of undermining his efforts to hold peaceful negotiations between Jean-Bertrand Aristide and his opposition after contested parliamentary elections in 2000. According to Curran, Stanley Lucas, then IRI&#x27;s representative in Haiti, advised opposition leaders not to compromise with Aristide, who was later driven from power. Curran also alleges that Lucas represented himself to the opposition as the Washington, D.C. envoy and his advice, which was contrary to that of the U.S. State Department, was advice from the U.S. government. IRI responded to Ambassador Curran&#x27;s allegations in a letter to the New York Times.

=== 2009 Honduran constitutional crisis ===

In 2009, IRI received $550,000 from the National Endowment for Democracy to &quot;promote and enhance the participation of think tanks in Mexico and Honduras as pressure groups to impel political parties to develop concrete positions on key issues&quot; and to &quot;support initiatives to implement political positions during the campaigns in 2009&quot; following the 2009 Honduran constitutional crisis.

=== Cuba ===

In 2008, the government of Cuba accused former U.S. congressional staff member Caleb McCarry of orchestrating the 2004 Haitian coup and attempting to provoke a coup d&#x27;état in Cuba.

===Middle East===

According to an April 15, 2011 article in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, IRI, the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, and other groups were credited for training activists in the Middle East, including Egypt and Tunisia, who advocated for reform in authoritarian regimes.

In 2011, Egypt&#x27;s Ministry of Justice issued a report on foreign funding of NGOs operating in Egypt that alleged that IRI had received approximately $7 million by USAID for the Egyptian 2011–12 elections. The military rulers who gained control of Egypt following the January 2011 revolution considered this foreign funding interference in Egypt&#x27;s internal affairs.

===Poland===
IRI has operated programs in Poland since 1991, where it says it has worked to unite and organize a diverse range of &quot;center and center right&quot; political parties together to create the Solidarity Electoral Action (AWS), which governed Poland in coalition with the Freedom Union (UW) party between 1997 and 2001. It also said that it provided training in political campaigning, communications training and research which helped organise and create the AWS.

===China===
In August 2020, IRI president Daniel Twining and four other U.S.-based democracy and human rights organizations and six U.S. Republican lawmakers were sanctioned by the Chinese government for supporting the Hong Kong pro-democracy movement in the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests. Leaders of the five organizations who were sanctioned alleged that the unspecified sanctions were a tit-for-tat measure in response to the earlier sanctioning by the U.S. government of 11 Hong Kong officials, which was a reaction to the enactment of the Hong Kong national security law at the end of June 2020.

=== Second Trump term ===
IRI has been funded by the National Endowment for Democracy (NED). After Elon Musk&#x27;s Department of Government Efficiency cut funding to the NED by blocking disbursement from the US Department of Treasury in February 2025, IRI was forced to lay off two-thirds of its work force in Washington, D.C. and closed more than 20 of its overseas offices.

<doc id="1015800" wikidata="Q1893959" url="?curid=1015800" title="Yang-style tai chi">
<text>Yang-style tai chi () is one of the five primary families of tai chi. Including its variations, it is the most popular and widely practised style of tai chi in the world today. It is second in terms of seniority, after Chen-style tai chi.

==History==
The Yang family first became involved in the study of tai chi in the early 19th century. The founder of the Yang-style was Yang Luchan, who studied under Chen Changxing starting in 1820. Yang became a teacher in his own right, and his subsequent expression of tai chi became known as the Yang-style, and directly led to the development of other three major styles of tai chi (see below). Yang Luchan (and some would say the art of tai chi, in general) came to prominence as a result of his being hired by the Chinese Imperial family to teach tai chi to the elite Palace Battalion of the Imperial Guards in 1850, a position he held until his death.

Yang Luchan passed on his art to:
* his second son, the oldest son to live to maturity, Yang Banhou, who was also retained as a martial arts instructor by the Chinese Imperial family. Yang Banhou&#x27;s first student was Wu Quanyou, a Manchu Banner officer. Wu had previously trained under Yang Luchan, but Yang Banhou became his formal teacher. Wu and his son, Wu Jianquan, would go on to co-found Wu-style tai chi.
* his third son Yang Jianhou, who passed it to his sons, Yang Shaohou and Yang Chengfu and Niu Chunming (1881–1961).
* Wu Yuxiang, who went on to develop Wu (Hao)-style. Wu (Hao)-style, in turn, would become the ancestor of Sun-style tai chi.

Yang Jianhou passed on the middle frame long form, sometimes called the 2nd generation Yang form or the Yang Jianhou form, to his disciples who still practice this more martial form. It is seen as more reminiscent of Chen style for which it is closer to in time as well as form than the Yang Chengfu form or 3rd generation styles. Yang Chengfu removed the vigorous &quot;fa jin&quot; (&quot;release of power&quot;) from the Hand (solo) Form, as well as the energetic jumping, stamping, and other abrupt movements in order to emphasise the &quot;Da jia&quot; (大架 &quot;large frame style&quot;), but retained them in the Weapons (sword, saber, staff, and spear) forms. The Hand Form has slow, steady, expansive and soft movements suitable for general practitioners. Thus, Yang Chengfu is largely responsible for standardizing and popularizing the Yang-style tai chi widely practised today.

===Modern short forms===

Yang Chengfu developed his own shortened &quot;large frame&quot; version of the Yang long Form, in order to make it easier to teach to modern students who are busy with modern life. Now the most popular long tai chi form in the world, the classic Yang Chengfu form retains the health and self-defense benefits of the original 300-movement sequence in only 150 movements, most commonly divided by teachers today into 85, 88, 103, or 108 &quot;postures&quot; or stopping points.

The Cheng Man-ch&#x27;ing and Chinese Sports Commission short forms are said to be derived from Yang family forms, but neither is recognized as Yang family tai chi by current standard-bearing Yang family teachers. The Chen, Yang and Wu families are now promoting their own shortened demonstration forms for competitive purposes.

As the 21st century began, the Chinese government also commissioned short &quot;10 Forms&quot; and &quot;16 Forms&quot; from each of the five major tai chi lineages. (The &quot;10 forms&quot; are also known as &quot;8 forms&quot;.) After these forms had been taught for several years, they were all presented as a set to attendees of the First International Tai Chi Chuan Symposium in Nashville, TN in July 2009.

==Some notable descendants of Yang Luchan==

===Yang Shouzhong===

Yang Yang Shouzhong is from the fourth generation of the Yang family. He was the oldest son of Yang Chengfu by his first marriage, and started learning his family-style when he was eight years old under the strict supervision of his father. In 1949, he moved to Hong Kong. There he taught many students privately at his home until his death in 1985. He had three daughters—Tai Yee, Ma Lee, and Yee Li—and all continue to teach in Hong Kong. Over the years he had taught many people, but he accepted only three people as his disciples. These Yang family tai chi practitioners are:
*Master Ip Tai Tak (Yip Tai Tak, 1929–2004) in Hong Kong. 
*Master Chu Gin Soon, in Boston. 
*Master Chu King Hung (朱景雄, pinyin: zhū jǐng xióng, born 1945) in the United Kingdom. Master Chu is head of the International Tai Chi Chuan Association (ITCCA).

===Yang Zhenduo===

Grandmaster Yang Zhenduo (1926 – 2020) is from the fourth generation of the Yang family and is officially the &quot;Fourth Lineage Holder&quot; of the Traditional Yang-style tai chi. He was born in Beijing in 1926 and is the third son of Yang Chengfu. He started studying with his father when very young and continued studying with his older brothers and Zhao Bin after his father died. In 1960, Yang Zhenduo moved to Taiyuan, Shanxi Province. Since then, Yang-style tai chi has gradually spread within Taiyuan and to other cities, provinces, and countries.

Since 1980, he has served as vice-president of the Shanxi Wushu Association. In 1982 Yang Zhenduo founded the Shanxi Yang Style Tai Chi Chuan Association, and has served as president since. The association has now grown to over 30,000 members throughout the Province and is the largest martial arts organization of its kind in China. In October 1998, Yang Zhenduo founded the International Yang Style Tai Chi Chuan Association, serving as chairman of the board. Under his leadership, the International Association has grown to 28 centers in 12 countries with over 2,000 members. The Chinese Wushu Academy recognized Master Yang Zhenduo in 1996 as one of the top 100 Wushu Masters in China. He has also been honored by proclamations from the mayors of San Antonio, Texas and Troy, Michigan.

In July 2009, at the First International Tai Chi Chuan Symposium, held at Vanderbilt University, in Nashville, TN, Grandmaster Yang Zhenduo officially named his grandson Yang Jun as the &quot;Fifth Lineage Holder&quot; of traditional Yang-style tai chi. Zhao YouBin is also direct 5 generation family member of Yang Family and the senior lineage holder in the family. Zhao Bin (1906 – 1999) his father was the teacher of Yang Zhenduo and was the oldest of the 4th generation Yang children his grand father was Yang Chengfu&#x27;s older brother Yang Zhaoyuan. Yang Zhenduo&#x27;s second wife&#x27;s children were adopted by the later, therefore not direct blood linage. Fu Zhongwen (1903–1994) was married to Zhao Bins sister therefore his brother in law also 4th generation family inheritor. His son Fu Sheng Yuan (1931 – 2017) 5th generation lineage holder has one son James Fu. Zhao YouBin has one son Zhao Liang and a grandson all actively practicing Yang Family Taiji in China.

<doc id="1015808" wikidata="Q707279" url="?curid=1015808" title="Ishikawa Goemon">
<text>was the leader of a group of bandits during the Azuchi-Momoyama period in Japan. Over time, and especially during the Edo period (1603-1867), his life and deeds became a center of attention, and he became known as a legendary Japanese outlaw hero who stole gold and other valuables to give to the poor. 

He and his son were boiled alive in public after their failed assassination attempt on the Sengoku period warlord Toyotomi Hideyoshi. His legend lives on in contemporary Japanese popular culture, often giving him greatly exaggerated ninja skills.

==Biography==
There is little historical information on Goemon&#x27;s life, and as he has become a folk hero, his background and origins have been widely speculated upon. In his first appearance in the historical annals, in the 1642 biography of Hideyoshi, Goemon was referred to simply as a thief. As his legend became popular, various anti-authoritarian exploits were attributed to him, including a supposed assassination attempt against the Oda clan warlord Oda Nobunaga.

There are many versions of Goemon&#x27;s background and accounts of his life. According to one of them, he was born as Sanada Kuranoshin in 1558 to a samurai family in service of the powerful Miyoshi clan in Iga Province. In 1573, when his father (possibly Ishikawa Akashi) was killed by the men of Ashikaga shogunate (in some versions his mother was also killed), the 15-year-old Sanada swore revenge and began training the arts of Iga ninjutsu under Momochi Sandayu (Momochi Tamba). He was, however, forced to flee when his master discovered Sanada&#x27;s romance with one of his mistresses (but not before stealing a prized sword from his teacher). Some other sources state his name as and say he came from Kawachi Province and was not a &quot;nukenin&quot; (runaway ninja) at all. He then moved to the neighbouring Kansai region, where he formed and led a band of thieves and bandits as Ishikawa Goemon, robbing the rich feudal lords, merchants and clerics, and sharing the loot with the oppressed peasants. According to another version, which also attributed a failed poisoning attempt on Nobunaga&#x27;s life to Goemon, he was forced to become a robber when the ninja networks were broken up.

There are also several conflicting accounts of Goemon&#x27;s public execution by boiling on the banks of the Kamo River in Kyoto, including but not limited to the following ones:

*Goemon tried to assassinate Hideyoshi to avenge the death of his wife Otaki and the capture of his son, Gobei. He snuck into Fushimi Castle and entered Hideyoshi&#x27;s room but knocked a bell off a table. The noise awoke the guards and Goemon was captured. He was sentenced to death by being boiled alive in an iron cauldron along with his very young son, but was able to save his son by holding him above his head. His son was then forgiven.
*Goemon wanted to kill Hideyoshi because he was a despot. When he entered Hideyoshi&#x27;s room, he was detected by a mystical incense burner. He was executed on October 8 along with his whole family by being boiled alive. Goemon at first tried to save his son from the heat by holding him high above, but then suddenly plunged him deep into the bottom of the cauldron to kill him as quickly as possible. Then he stood with the body of the boy held high in the air in defiance of his enemies, until he eventually succumbed to pain and injuries and sank into the pot.

Even the date of his death is uncertain, as some records say this took place in summer, while another dates it at October 8 (that is after middle of Japanese autumn). Before he died, Goemon wrote a famous farewell poem, saying that no matter what, thieves would always exist. A tombstone dedicated to him is located in Daiunin temple in Kyoto. A large iron kettle-shaped bathtub is now called a &quot;goemonburo&quot; (&quot;Goemon bath&quot;).

== In drama ==
Ishikawa Goemon is the subject of many classic kabuki plays. The only one still in performance today is &quot;Kinmon Gosan no Kiri&quot; (&quot;The Golden Gate and the Paulownia Crest&quot;), a five-act play written by Namiki Gohei in 1778. The most famous act is &quot;Sanmon Gosan no Kiri&quot; (&quot;The Temple Gate and the Paulownia Crest&quot;) in which Goemon is first seen sitting on top of the Sanmon gate at Nanzen-ji. He is smoking an oversized silver pipe called a kiseru and exclaims &quot;The spring view is worth a thousand gold pieces, or so they say, but &#x27;this too little, too little. These eyes of Goemon rate it worth ten thousand!&quot;. Goemon soon learns that his father, a Chinese man named Sō Sokei, was killed by Mashiba Hisayoshi (a popular kabuki alias for Hideyoshi) and he sets off to avenge his father&#x27;s death. He also appears in some versions of the famous &quot;Tale of the Forty-Seven Rōnin&quot;. In 1992, Goemon appeared in the kabuki series of Japanese postage stamps.

There are generally two ways in which Goemon has been most often portrayed in the modern popular culture: either a young, slender ninja, or a powerfully-built, hulking Japanese bandit. Goemon was a subject of several pre-WWII Japanese films such as &quot;Ishikawa Goemon Ichidaiki&quot; and &quot;Ishikawa Goemon no Hoji&quot;. He is a villain in &quot;Torawakamaru the Koga Ninja&quot;, and a tragic antagonist in &quot;Fukurō no Shiro&quot; (and in its remake &quot;Owls&#x27; Castle&quot;, played by Takaya Kamikawa). He is the subject of the &quot;Shinobi no Mono&quot; novels and film series, starring Ichikawa Raizō VIII as Goemon in the first three installments. In the third &quot;Shinobi no Mono&quot; film, known in English as &quot;Goemon Will Never Die&quot;, he escapes execution while another man is bribed to be boiled in his place. In the film &quot;Goemon&quot;, he is portrayed by Yōsuke Eguchi and depicted as Nobunaga&#x27;s most faithful follower and as associated with Hattori Hanzō as well as Kirigakure Saizō and Sarutobi Sasuke of Sanada Ten Braves.

<text>, officially Izumo Ōyashiro, is one of the most ancient and important Shinto shrines in Japan. No record gives the date of establishment. Located in Izumo, Shimane Prefecture, it is home to two major festivals. It is dedicated to the god , famous as the Shinto deity of marriage and to Kotoamatsukami, distinguishing heavenly &quot;kami&quot;. The shrine is believed by many to be the oldest Shinto shrine in Japan, even predating the Ise Grand Shrine.

A style of architecture, &quot;taisha-zukuri&quot;, takes its name from the main hall of Izumo-taisha. That hall, and the attached buildings, were designated National Treasures of Japan in 1952. According to tradition, the hall was previously much taller than at present. The discovery in the year 2000 of the remains of enormous pillars has lent credence to this.

The shrine has been rebuilt every 60 to 70 years to maintain the power of the &quot;kami&quot; and maintain architectural techniques. This regular rebuilding process is called &quot;Sengū&quot; (遷宮) and has long been practiced at a handful of important Shinto shrines, the Ise Grand Shrine being rebuilt every 20 years.

Several other buildings in the shrine compound are on the list of Important Cultural Properties of Japan.

==Origins==
According to the two oldest chronicles of Japan, the and the , when Ninigi-no-Mikoto, grandson of the Sun Goddess Amaterasu, descended from the heavens, the god Ōkuninushi granted his country to Ninigi-no-Mikoto. Amaterasu was much pleased by this action and she presented Izumo-taisha to Ōkuninushi.
At one time, the Japanese islands were controlled from Izumo, according to Shinto myths. Izumo, known as the realm of gods or the land of myths, is Izumo-taisha&#x27;s province. Its main structure was originally constructed to glorify the great achievement of Ōkuninushi, considered the creator of Japan. Ōkuninushi was devoted to the building of the nation, in which he shared many joys and sorrows with the ancestors of the land. In addition to being the savior, Ōkuninushi is considered the guardian god and god of happiness, as well as the god who establishes good relationships.

According to the , the sun goddess Amaterasu said, &quot;From now on, my descendants shall administer the affairs of state. You shall cast a spell of establishing good relationship over people to lead them a happy life. I will build your residence with colossal columns and thick and broad planks in the same architectural style as mine and name it Amenohisu-no-miya.&quot; The other gods were gathered and ordered by Amaterasu to build the grand palace at the foot of Mt. Uga.

There is no knowledge of exactly when Izumo-taisha was built, but a record compiled around 950 (Heian period) describes the shrine as the highest building, reaching approximately 48 meters, which exceeds in height the 45 meter-tall temple that enshrined the Great Image of Buddha, Tōdai-ji. This was due to early Shinto cosmology, when the people believed the gods (kami) were above the human world and belonged to the most extraordinary and majestic parts of nature. Therefore, Izumo-taisha could have been an attempt to create a place for the kami that would be above humans.

According to &quot;Kojiki&quot;, the legendary stories of old Japan, and &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, the chronicles of old Japan, Izumo-taisha was considered the largest wooden structure in Japan when it was originally constructed. Before being known as Izumo Ōyashiro or Izumo-taisha, the shrine was known as Okami-no-miya in Izumo, Itsukashinokami-no-miya, Kizuki-no-Oyashiro, Kizuki-no-miya, or Iwakumanoso-no-miya.

Three cedar trunks believed to be evidence of the original Grand Shrine have been found and are displayed at the shrine. In addition to these, there is a shop just before the main entrance that has a model of the original main structure made by local college students.

==History==

During the Kamakura period, around 1200, the main structure was reduced in size. Then in 1744, the shrine was reconstructed to the present size of 24 meters high and 11 meters square at its base.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, as travel became more common in Japan, the shrine became a central place of pilgrimage.

Since the shrine spirit was settled in the inner shrine in 1744, it has been relocated three times for renovation of the inner shrine, using a traditional ceremony. The relocations took place in 1809, 1881, and 1953.

From 1871 through 1946, the Izumo-taisha was officially designated one of the , meaning that it stood in the first rank of government supported shrines.

In April 2008, the spirit was moved to temporary housing in the front shrine of Izumo-taisha in preparation for the Heisei-period renovations. Izumo-taisha&#x27;s inner shrine was opened to the public for the first time in 60 years in the summer of 2008. On completion of the renovations, Ōkuninushi was returned to the inner shrine in a ceremony attended by over 8,000 people, held on May 11, 2013.

==Architecture==


The main structure of Izumo Oyashiro was built in the Taisha style, the oldest style of building shrines. An impressive sized gable-entrance structure is built for the main structure, which gave the name of The Great Shrine or The Grand Shrine. The main hall () bears an enormous &quot;chigi&quot; (scissor-shaped finials at the front and back ends of the roof). A Japanese architecture book states, &quot;In plan, the present Main Shrine resembles that of the Daijoe Shoden, built for the accession of each new Emperor. The main shrine at Izumo is thought, therefore, to preserve a floor plan characteristic of ancient domestic architecture&quot; (Nishi &amp; Hozumi, 1985, p. 41). From the view of architectures, the original height of the main structure of Izumo Taisha makes it difficult to study the historical building styles and methods. However, what is known is that from the construction of a building as big as the main structure, major problems were presented. Because of this, structural and stylistic changes occurred each time the main structure was rebuilt, which caused the outer form to be less reflective of the original construction of the main structure. Although the outside of the structure changed with each reconstruction, the floor plan remained virtually unchanged. The layout consists of nine support pillars arranged so that the inside is divided into four sections and causes the entrance to be off-centered. A significant characteristic that is common among most shrines is the symmetrical design, making the main structure of Izumo-taisha peculiar for its asymmetrical floor plan. The main structure was built more like a home rather than a shrine which suggests that between the people and kami there was a less formal relationship than at other shrines.

===Kagura-den===
Izumo-taisha&#x27;s was first built in 1776 by the Senge family, Izumo no Kuni no Miyatsuko, or governor of Izumo, as a grand hall for performance of traditional rituals. It was rebuilt in 1981 to commemorate the centennial of the foundation of the Izumo Oyashiro-kyo order.

Traditional prayer by Izumo no Kuni no Miyatsuko, wedding ceremonies of believers, and the performances of sacred dance to ancient Japanese music involve the Oracle with 240 mats. Also worshipped with prayer is a frame with four dyed Kanji characters, meaning &quot;the Oracle Filled with Aureole,&quot; by Prince Arisugawa above the altar.

The Kagura-den features the largest &quot;shimenawa&quot; (sacred straw rope) in Japan; it is 13.5 meters long and weighs around 5 tons. The rope is one of the most easily recognized and distinctive features of Izumo-taisha.

===Shōkokan===
The consists of two floors. The first floor is the reception office for &quot;Kaguraden&quot;. The second floor consists of a museum for important items.

Some items in the museum are items designated as national treasure and important cultural assets, like jewelry, household articles, paintings, swords, and musical instruments.

Considered most important in &quot;Shōkokan&quot; are a set of Japan&#x27;s oldest wooden pestle and an igniting board and a small boat that was hollowed out of a piece of wood. The small boat was believed to have come from the upper stream of the Yoshino River, through the Seto Inland Sea, and to the Inasa Beach near Izumo-taisha.

==Festivals==
Festivals or &quot;matsuri&quot; in Izumo are times when people gather around the god to fulfill their wish to live a happy life. One of the most important in Izumo-taisha is the Imperial Festival held on May 14. Following the Imperial Festival is the Grand Festival on May 14 and 15.

Some other major festivals are January 1, Omike Festival; January 3, Fukumukae Festival; January 5, Beginning Sermon Festival; February 17, Kikoku (prayer for abundant crops) Festival; April 1, Kyoso Festival; June 1, Suzumidono Festival; and August 6–9 is Izumo Oyashiro-kyo Religion Festival.

In the tenth month of the traditional lunar calendar, a festival is held to welcome all the gods to Izumo Grand Shrine. It is believed that the gods convene at Izumo Shrine in October to discuss the coming year&#x27;s marriages, deaths, and births. For this reason, people around the Izumo area call October &quot;kamiarizuki&quot; (&quot;the month with gods&quot;), but the rest of Japan calls October &quot;Kannazuki&quot; (&quot;the month without gods&quot;).

==Administrator&#x27;s family==

The descendants of , the second son of , the sun goddess whose first son is the ancestor of the imperial family, have been, in the name of or governor of Izumo, taking over rituals because when Izumo-taisha was founded Amenohohi-no-mikoto rendered service to Okuninushi-no-kami. The family&#x27;s conflict around 1340 made them separated into two lineages, and .

After the separation those two families took the position of Izumo no Kuni no Miyatsuko by turns until the late 19th century. Shinto was reconstructed as modernized Japan&#x27;s national religion in the late 19th century. In 1871, Izumo-taisha was designated as an Imperial-associated shrine and the government sent a new administrator so Izumo no Kuni no Miyatsuko families were no more the administrators of Izumo-taisha. Senge and Kitajima established their religious corporations respectively, by Senge and by Kitajima.

Under the Allied occupation after World War II, Shinto was separated from the government control and Izumo-taisha was reformed into a private shrine, then Senge and its Izumo-taisha-kyo took back the position of the administrator of Izumo-taisha. , the 83rd-generation Izumo no Kuni no Miyatsuko of Senge lineage, was chosen to be the chief priest of Izumo-taisha in 1947. He died in February 2002 at the age of 89.

Currently, the position of the administrator of Izumo-taisha is succeeded by Senge lineage. Its Izumo-taisha-kyo is better known nationwide and has more followers in total, &quot; (1998/8)&quot;, but locally Kitajima lineage and its Izumo-kyo has more followers around Izumo region. Kitajima is the more orthodox Izumo no Kuni no Miyatsuko. &quot; (1898)&quot;. On October 5, 2014, Kunimaro Senge, eldest son of the current administrator Takamasa Senge, married Princess Noriko at the shrine. Princess Noriko is a daughter of the late Prince Takamado, a cousin of the now-Emperor Emeritus of Japan.

<doc id="1015816" wikidata="Q972582" url="?curid=1015816" title="Geography of Singapore">
<text>Singapore is a city-state and island country in maritime Southeast Asia, located at the end of the Malayan Peninsula between Malaysia and Indonesia as well as the Straits of Malacca and the South China Sea. It is heavily compact and urbanised. As of 2023, Singapore has a total land area of approximately . Singapore is separated from Indonesia by the Singapore Strait and from Malaysia by the Straits of Johor.

Geographically, Singapore comprises its mainland and other islands. The mainland of Singapore measures from east to west and from north to south with of coastline. These figures are based on High Water Mark cadastral survey boundaries. It has an exclusive economic zone of .

==Topography==

Singapore&#x27;s main territory looks like a diamond-shaped island, although its territory includes surrounding smaller islands. The farthest outlying island is Pedra Branca. Of Singapore&#x27;s dozens of smaller islands, Jurong Island, Pulau Tekong, Pulau Ubin and Sentosa are the larger ones. Most of Singapore is no more than 15 meters above sea level.

The highest point of Singapore is Bukit Timah Hill, with a height from the ground of 165 m (538  ft) and made up of igneous rock, granite. Hills and valleys of sedimentary rock dominate the northwest, while the eastern region consists of sandy and flatter land. Singapore has no natural lakes, but reservoirs and water catchment areas have been constructed to store fresh water for Singapore&#x27;s water supply.

Singapore has reclaimed land with earth obtained from its own hills, the seabed, and neighboring countries. As a result, Singapore&#x27;s land area has grown from 581.5  km2 in the 1960s to 725.7  km2 today, and will increase slightly more due to the construction of sea polder and barrage to deal with the ever-rising sea level.

==Climate==
Singapore is one-and-a-half degrees north of the equator, lying entirely between the 1st and 2nd parallels. Singapore&#x27;s climate is classified as tropical rainforest climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Af&quot;), with no true distinct seasons. Owing to its geographical location and maritime exposure, its climate is characterised by uniform temperature and pressure, high humidity and abundant rainfall. Therefore, it is almost always warm and wet. The average annual rainfall is around . The highest 24-hour rainfall figures ever recorded in history were (2 December 1978) at Paya Lebar, (1969) and (19 December 2006).

The temperature hovers around a diurnal range of a minimum of and a maximum of . May is the hottest month of the year in Singapore, followed by June. This is due to light winds and strong sunshine during those months. The highest recorded temperature is , which was recorded twice on 17 April 1983 and 13 May 2023. The lowest recorded temperature was on 14 February 1989 at Paya Lebar, although there is an unofficial record low of on an unspecified date. At the climate station in Changi however, extremes have ranged from on 30 March 1998 to on January 30 and 31 1934. Temperature often goes above and can reach at times.

Relative humidity has a diurnal range in the high 90s in the early morning to around 60% in the mid-afternoon, but does go below 50% at times. During prolonged heavy rain, relative humidity often reaches 100%. Generally, there is much more rainfall on the western side of the island than on the eastern portion of Singapore, owing to a rain shadow effect.

Thus, the eastern side of Singapore is much drier and slightly hotter than western Singapore. This can cause slight weather disparities from one side of the island to the other. This is significant to note because even a small hill such as Bukit Timah Hill can cause this phenomenon. Despite Singapore&#x27;s small size, there may be sunshine on one side while there is rain on the other.

Further contrasts that prevent true all-year uniformity are the monsoon seasons which happen twice each year. The first one is the Northeast Monsoon which occurs from mid-November to early March. The second is the Southwest Monsoon season which occurs from June to September. Periods between monsoon seasons receive less rain and wind. During the Northeast Monsoon, northeast winds prevail, sometimes reach . There are cloudy conditions in December and January with frequent afternoon showers.

Spells of widespread moderate to heavy rain occur lasting from 1 to 3 days at a stretch. It is relatively dry in February till early March although rainfall still exceeds 120mm. It is also generally windy with wind speeds sometimes reaching in the months of January and February. During the Southwest Monsoon season, southeast winds prevail. Isolated to scattered showers occur in the late morning and early afternoon. Early morning &quot;Sumatras&quot; – squall lines that originate over nearby Sumatra – are common.

===Climate change initiatives===
Singapore recognises that climate change in the decades ahead will have major implications for the island-nation. It has taken a three-prong approach to the issue - researching how the nation will be affected in specific details, implementing mitigation measures and adapting to the coming changes. For the research, a Centre for Climate Research Singapore (CCRS) has been established.

The government estimates that $100 billion will need to be spent over a 100-year time frame to address the issue. In the 2020 budget, it has set aside an initial $5 billion towards a Coastline and Flood Protection Fund.
 For the population, it will provide incentives for owners to convert to electric vehicles (EVs), like rebates on the Additional Registration fees and expanding the EV charging network. By 2040, it expects to phase out petrol and diesel (internal combustion engine) vehicles. The country&#x27;s transport policy continues to focus on a &quot;car-lite&quot; future with most commuters using public transportation (MRT trains, buses, taxis) instead.
Singapore is the first country in Southeast Asia to levy a carbon tax, at $5 per ton, applicable for its largest carbon-emitting corporations that produce more than 25,000 tons of carbon dioxide per year. To reduce the country&#x27;s dependence on fossil fuels, it is building one of the world&#x27;s largest floating solar farms at Tengeh Reservoir in Tuas, with a capacity of 60MW.

==Time zone==

Although Singapore does not observe daylight saving time (DST), it follows the UTC+8 time zone, one hour ahead of the typical zone for its geographical location. 
==Geology==

Igneous rocks are found in Bukit Timah and Woodlands and Pulau Ubin island. Granite makes up the bulk of the igneous rock. Gabbro is also found in the area and is found in an area called Little Guilin named for its resemblance to Guilin in Southern China. This area is in Bukit Gombak. Sedimentary rocks are found on the western part of Singapore and is mainly made of sandstone and mudstones. It also includes the southwestern area. Metamorphic rocks are found in the northeastern part of Singapore and also on Pulau Tekong off the east coast of Singapore. The rocks are mainly made up of quartzite and also make up the Sajahat Formation.

===Seismic activity===
Singapore is relatively safe from seismic activity in the region, as the nearest major active faults (Sumatran fault and Sunda megathrust fault) are hundreds of kilometres away in Indonesia. However, the population and buildings are prone to being only very slightly affected by any activity as tremors, which is not uncommon, but generally does not do any harm and is limited to small amounts of swaying or vibration of objects.

In late 2004, several parts of Asia and Africa were struck by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and the resulting tsunami. Singapore was fortunate as it was protected by the Sumatra landmass, which bore the brunt of the tsunami; the effect on Singapore was limited to tremors felt in some of the common high-rise buildings there.

==Political and human geography==

When Singapore was first colonised by the British, the City of Singapore was situated on the southern coast, around the mouth of the Singapore River. This area remains the Central Area of Singapore. The rest of the island was farmland and primary rainforest. However, since the 1960s the government has constructed many new towns in other areas, so that today the island is nearly entirely built-up and urbanised, with only a few exceptions, such as the district of Lim Chu Kang or reclaimed land in the process of being developed.

The country has several subdivisions, mostly used for administrative or statistical purposes. Politically, Singapore is divided into five administrative districts, these are then further subdivided into town councils which usually consists of one or more political constituencies. However, unlike other countries where local government subdivisions are used to cite locations, the same practice is often uncommon in Singapore. Political boundaries fluctuate with every general election and thus, the areas they cover do not necessarily correspond to the local perception of a place. Most geographical regions, districts and neighbourhoods within the city-state are usually overlapping and can sometimes be arbitrarily defined. Planning and census boundaries, called planning areas, have been used by the Urban Redevelopment Authority to define certain districts and neighbourhoods, although these boundaries may not necessarily correspond with the common perception of a certain place. While boundaries for new towns do exist, there have been instances where certain neighbourhoods can be identified separately from the town it is located in. Tiong Bahru for example, is often identified separately from the HDB town it is a part of, Bukit Merah.

As the main government agency responsible for the urban planning of Singapore, the Urban Redevelopment Authority seeks to implement efficient land use and minimise pollution while maintaining convenient transport, which are Singapore&#x27;s largest concerns because of its situation as a city-state. A Development Guide Plan for each of the 55 planning areas has been released in the process.

In order to reduce traffic congestion, Electronic road pricing (ERP) has been enacted around entrances into the Central Area. The other parts of Singapore are less dense and busy, and are often filled with housing estates such as from the Housing and Development Board (HDB) or condominiums, and commercial districts are less concentrated. However, to reduce strain on the Central Area, several regional centres have been developed, each containing a concentrated commercial district.

Light industry tends to be distributed around the island as industrial estates and located in flats, similar to the HDB, and only allow tenants which produce close to nil pollution, whereas heavy industry tends to be located around Jurong and Jurong Island. A list of such estates can be found here.

There are two connections to the state of Johor, Malaysia. In the north there is a causeway for both rail and road traffic, which connects to the city of Johor Bahru. In the west there is a road bridge (Tuas Second Link), which connects to Johor, for road traffic only. The connections are an important economic link to Malaysia, which can be seen as a hinterland.

The causeway (1,038 m in length) was designed by Coode, Fizmaurice, Wilson and Mitchell of Westminster and constructed by Topham, Jones &amp; Railton Ltd of London. It was started in 1909 as a railway link by Johor State Railway to connect Johor Bahru to Singapore, then the administrative headquarters of British interests in Southeast Asia. Construction of the road section started in 1919 and completed in 1923.

The causeway has caused ecological problems, most notably accumulation of silt in the Johore Strait. This has led to disagreements with Malaysia. Singapore has rejected Malaysia&#x27;s proposal to replace the causeway with a bridge, and Malaysia has since proposed the idea of what became known as &quot;the crooked half-bridge&quot;, descending halfway to link up with the low-level causeway.

Since Singapore lacks natural freshwater rivers and lakes, the primary source of domestic water is rainfall. Demand for fresh water is approximately twice that supplied by rainfall, so Singapore imports much of its fresh water from Malaysia and Indonesia. To lessen its reliance on imports, Singapore has built reservoirs to collect rainwater from both forest catchment and urban catchment run-offs and from recycled water facilities. In addition, Singapore has built three desalination plants on the western coast of Tuas with two more under construction. They are expected to at least meet 30% of Singapore&#x27;s water demands in 2060. Recent plans to produce NEWater-recycled water from treatment by filtration via reverse osmosis have been very successful as the government has opened up three plants around the island to help meet the demand.

There are more than 300 parks and 4 nature reserves in Singapore. There are also many trees planted, and almost fifty per cent of the country is covered by greenery. Because of this, Singapore is also commonly known as the &#x27;Garden City&#x27;.

Singapore remains highly vulnerable to the impact of climate change; in particular, the rising sea levels may pose a major threat to the very survival of the country in the long-term perspective.

<doc id="1015819" wikidata="Q162465" url="?curid=1015819" title="The Order of the Stick">
<text>The Order of the Stick (OOTS) is a comedic webcomic that satirizes tabletop role-playing games and medieval fantasy. The comic is written and drawn by Rich Burlew, who illustrates the comic in a stick figure style.

Taking place in a magical world that loosely operates by the rules of the 3.5 edition of the role-playing game &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (&quot;D&amp;D&quot;), the comic follows the sometimes farcical exploits of six adventurers as they strive to save the world from an evil lich sorcerer. Much of the comic&#x27;s humor stems from the characters&#x27; awareness of the game rules that affect their lives or from having anachronistic knowledge of modern culture. This in turn is often used by the author to parody various aspects of role-playing games and fantasy fiction. While primarily comedic in nature, &quot;The Order of the Stick&quot; features a continuing storyline serialized in one- to four-page episodes, with over 1300 such episodes released as of April 2024.

Although it is principally distributed online through the website &quot;Giant in the Playground&quot;, ten book collections have been published, including several print-only stories (&quot;On the Origin of PCs&quot;, &quot;Start of Darkness&quot;, and &quot;Good Deeds Gone Unpunished&quot;). An alternate version of the strip appeared monthly in &quot;Dragon&quot; magazine for 22 issues; these strips, among others, are collected in &quot;Snips, Snails and Dragon Tales&quot;.

==History==
&quot;The Order of the Stick&quot; began its run on September 29, 2003, on what was Rich Burlew&#x27;s personal site for gaming articles at the time. Burlew initially intended the strip to feature no plot whatsoever—depicting an endless series of gags drawn from the D&amp;D rules instead—but Burlew quickly changed his mind, and he began laying down hints of a storyline as early as strip #13. The strip was originally produced to entertain people who came to his website to read articles, but it quickly became the most popular feature, leading Burlew to eventually abandon writing articles almost entirely.

&quot;The Order of the Stick&quot; began as a twice-weekly comic that debuted new strips on Mondays and Thursdays. When presales of the first &quot;OOTS&quot; compilation book allowed Burlew to make writing his full-time job, he increased the number to three per week.&lt;ref name=&quot;GITPNews2/17/05&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2007, the comic has been published on an irregular schedule due to the author&#x27;s ongoing health concerns.&lt;ref name=&quot;GITPNews7/7/07&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; That included a hiatus from September to December 2012, after Burlew had an accident that severed the tendons in his right hand.&lt;ref name=&quot;GITPNews9/19/12&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GITPNews12/31/12&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2019, Burlew stated that the story would end after one more book, but also noted that still means &quot;years and years&quot; of planned content. He noted that the two preceding books took five years each, and that the upcoming final book may be longer than either.

===&quot;Dragon&quot; magazine===
On September 30, 2005, Burlew announced that &quot;The Order of the Stick&quot; would begin appearing in &quot;Dragon&quot;, the long-running official &quot;D&amp;D&quot; magazine. The strip debuted in the December 2005 issue, on the last page of the magazine. The following issue, &quot;OOTS&quot; appeared as a four-panel strip in the magazine&#x27;s interior, but by the February 2006 issue, it had returned to a full-page strip on the last page, a position it held until the magazine&#x27;s last print issue in September 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;GITPNews4/19/07&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The &quot;Dragon&quot; version of &quot;OOTS&quot; featured the same main cast of six adventurers, but saw them adventuring in an unspecified underground location. None of the villains or supporting characters from the online strip appeared, with the exception of Mr. Jones and Mr. Rodriguez, who appeared together twice. Burlew has stated that the events of the &quot;Dragon&quot; strips take place in an alternate universe from the online strip, and events in one storyline do not affect the other.&lt;ref name=&quot;GITPNews10/10/05&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This status quo was broken for the sake of a joke, however, when a character in the online strip referred to the July 2006 &quot;Dragon&quot; strip by claiming that &quot;I told you that in one of the Dragon Magazine comics, so I&#x27;m not even sure that&#x27;s the same continuity.&quot;

Starting in January 2013, a of the comic appeared in &quot;Gygax Magazine&quot;, a new tabletop gaming magazine published in print and digital formats.

===Evolution of art style===
The comic is created directly on a computer using the vector-based software Adobe Illustrator, and the art style has been upgraded several times. In strip #103, the curved and crooked panel borders were replaced with straight—though still slanted—black lines. Burlew now questions how he ever thought the initial format was acceptable. After he sprained his wrist in 2005, Burlew used some of the time he took off from writing the comic to improve the designs of the main cast, straightening their lines and adding tiny details like the runes stitched along the edge of Vaarsuvius&#x27; cloak. These changes were humorously acknowledged by the characters themselves when they premiered. Burlew made adjustments to the colors that were required when the material was to appear in print for the first time. The later comics feature more frequent double- and even triple-page strips than in the early days, when longer strips were reserved for special occasions (such as reaching #200). In strip #947 the artwork was upgraded again, adding volume to characters&#x27; limbs that were previously drawn as simple stick-figure lines. In addition to these permanent improvements to the art, two variant art styles are used to distinguish the events of certain comics from those taking place in the story&#x27;s present. Historical events relating to the plot are portrayed in a hand-drawn crayon style both in the online comic and in &quot;Start of Darkness&quot;, while events in the &quot;prequel&quot; print-exclusive stories are shown in black-and-white.

=== Representation of minorities ===
Burlew has said that he includes stances on social topics in his comic because he worries about the impact of his work beyond momentary distractions. He has also written that he is attempting to compensate for past instances of &quot;unintentional sexism and/or insensitivity to gender issues&quot; but, being a straight white male, he finds it difficult to speak authoritatively about minorities without the proper knowledge.

==Characters==
===Protagonists===
The comic&#x27;s central protagonists, known collectively as &quot;The Order of the Stick,&quot; are a party of adventurers who are questing to destroy the evil lich Xykon who is attempting to conquer the world. Though they have many allies, the official members of the Order of the Stick are:

*Roy Greenhilt: A 29-year-old lawful good human fighter, Roy assembled the Order to defeat Xykon, and is its leader. Roy is a counterstereotype of the traditional &quot;dumb fighter&quot; cliché, being knowledgeable, rational, and a skilled tactician. He was conceived as the straight man to the rest of his team&#x27;s antics, but over the course of the comic he learns to appreciate their various eccentricities.
*Haley Starshine: A 24-year-old &quot;Chaotic Good-ish&quot; human rogue. The Order&#x27;s second-in-command, she is skilled in stealth and deception. In early strips, the group thinks of her as the typical greedy thief, not knowing that her father was being held for ransom and she originally left a Thieves Guild to become a wandering adventurer to raise the money. She develops a romantic crush on fellow member Elan and, later, begins a relationship with him.
*Durkon Thundershield: A lawful good dwarven cleric, is the healer of the party. He had worked with Roy for years prior to the founding of the &quot;Order of the Stick.&quot; Durkon is a cleric of Thor and travels through human lands on the orders of the high priest of Thor, who exiled him as a result of a prophecy. Durkon speaks and writes in a Scottish accent and has a fear of trees, taking any opportunity to fight them.
*Belkar Bitterleaf: A chaotic evil halfling ranger/barbarian, Belkar is an erratic, casual killer driven by selfish impulses. He joined the Order to escape justice from a deadly bar fight in which he knifed fifteen people. The Order does not abandon him, despite his bloodthirsty tendencies, due to Roy&#x27;s belief that he must keep Belkar under control. Belkar&#x27;s loyalty to the Order fluctuates with his mood, and, despite frequently thinking about it, he never actually betrays them. He adopts a housecat named Mr. Scruffy to be his animal companion.
*Elan: A chaotic good human bard/Dashing Swordsman. Elan is the happy-go-lucky, childlike bard of the Order. Early in the series, he is frequently inept and oblivious to the motives of those around him, such as Haley&#x27;s long-concealed attraction to him. Raised solely by his mother, Elan discovers early in the story that his absent warlord father raised his twin brother, Nale, to be an evil mastermind.
*Vaarsuvius: An arrogant and condescending true neutral elven wizard, whose gender is deliberately ambiguous, causing occasional confusion in teammates and others. Often addressed simply as &quot;V&quot; by teammates, Vaarsuvius tends toward unnecessary verbosity, often to the point of becoming ineffective as a teammate, although sometimes it can be of value; and is motivated by the need to gain &quot;ultimate arcane power&quot; as an end unto itself. Vaarsuvius was married to an equally ambiguously gendered elf baker Inkyrius, with two children (who address them as &quot;parent&quot;), but Inkyrius filed for divorce due to Vaarsuvius&#x27;s quest for power taking priority over family matters.

===Antagonists===
The comic&#x27;s central antagonists include the following:
*Xykon (Formerly human lich sorcerer, Chaotic Evil): The archvillain of the story, Xykon is engaged in a plot to conquer the world by controlling a world-destroying being known as the Snarl. While he has a notoriously short attention span and requires near-constant amusement, he is also capable of truly horrific acts of evil.
*Redcloak (Goblin Cleric of the Dark One, Lawful Evil): Xykon&#x27;s main ally, he is a high priest of his deity and commander of the goblinoids that serve as the lich&#x27;s minions. He is motivated by concern for the goblin people and their poor lot in life, believing that harnessing the power of the Snarl will allow his god to bargain for a better place for all goblins. Unlike his boss, Redcloak is a patient planner and a competent leader, and has shown an inclination for scientific thought.
*The Monster in the Dark: An enigmatic, childlike monster that lurks in darkness under a pink umbrella. Although designated as Xykon&#x27;s secret weapon, the Monster is terrified of almost everything, including the dark. On the rare occasions he has used force, he has demonstrated incredible power. The paladin O-Chul deemed the Monster &quot;a good man&quot; after befriending him.
*The Linear Guild: An adventuring party comprising &quot;evil opposites&quot; to the Order. While the Guild originally sought a powerful magic artefact, its purpose turned solely toward defeating the Order after their first encounter with them. Each of their engagements with the Order results in the Guild needing to recruit new members, not all of whom last long. Recurring characters include:
:*Nale: Elan&#x27;s evil identical twin brother, the Guild leader. A multiclass fighter/rogue/sorcerer who specializes in enchantment spells, he looks identical to Elan except for a small goatee. Though more intelligent than Elan, his plans are typically vastly more complicated than is necessary to achieve his goals. He is ultimately killed by his own father, Tarquin, for his murder of Malack.
:*Sabine: Nale&#x27;s lover and the opposite number of Haley Starshine. Sabine is a female succubus with shapeshifting and plane-hopping abilities. Though her loyalties are divided between the Guild and a shady group of fiends in the Lower Planes, she is genuinely attached to Nale and furiously angry when he is killed.
:*Thog: A male half-orc barbarian with two levels in fighter. Roy&#x27;s opposite. He wields a greataxe and combines a childlike innocence with a propensity for merciless slaughter. Last seen as a gladiator in the Empire of Blood on the Western Continent, where Roy defeats him by collapsing a building on him; whether he survives is unknown.
:*Zz&#x27;dtri: A male drow wizard who wields dual scimitars. Vaarsuvius&#x27; opposite. Dragged off by lawyers after his first on-screen battle for being a rather obvious parody of the character Drizzt Do&#x27;Urden, a continuation of a running joke. Rejoins the Guild in their stint in the Western Continent, where he is killed by Vampire Durkon after helping Nale murder Malack.
:*Hilgya Firehelm: A female dwarf cleric of Loki. Durkon&#x27;s opposite. Quits the Guild after they abandon her to die in their first battle against the Order. Sleeps with Durkon in the Dungeon of Dorukan but flees in tears when he rejects her after she reveals she is married. Returns, accompanied by her and Durkon&#x27;s baby son Kudzu, to help the Order fight Vampire Durkon at Firmament.
:*(In a running joke, Belkar&#x27;s Linear Guild opposites are a succession of kobolds, none of whom survive contact with him.)
*Miko Miyazaki (Human Monk/Paladin, Lawful good): Strongest warrior of the Sapphire Guard, Miko is dispatched to apprehend the Order at the request of her liege. Her sanctimonious attitude and her frequent judgment of others on moral grounds create conflict with the Order, although both oppose the forces of Evil. Miko breaks her Paladin oath by killing Shojo, her liege lord. She is killed during the battle of Azure City.
*General Tarquin: The de facto ruler of the Empire of Blood on the Western Continent and the father of Elan and Nale, General Tarquin is a lawful evil fighter who has schemes within schemes. Much like Elan, Tarquin is genre-savvy and has a flair for the dramatic, and becomes upset when others fail to respect literary convention.
*Minister Malack: A lawful evil lizardfolk cleric of Nergal and close friend of Tarquin; secretly a vampire. He harbors a grudge against Nale for killing his children (i.e. vampire spawn) and befriends Durkon soon after they meet, but later turns him into a vampire. Ultimately murdered by Nale.
*Vampire Durkon: An evil spirit created by Hel to fit the darker aspects of Durkon&#x27;s personality. When Durkon is vampirized this spirit takes possession of his body, keeping the original Durkon a prisoner in his own brain. He is Hel&#x27;s agent in the attempt to sway the gods&#x27; vote to destroy the world. Sacrifices himself when outwitted by the real Durkon.
*Hel: The Northern goddess of death, daughter of Loki. At the creation of the current world, she and Thor agreed (with Loki&#x27;s connivance) that she could have the soul of every dwarf who died without honor. The dwarves since became a race of honorable warriors, frustrating her plans. When the gods debate whether to destroy the world, she attempts to swing the vote to Yes, since if the world is snuffed out every remaining dwarf soul becomes hers.

==Plot==

While the online version of &quot;The Order of the Stick&quot; unfolds continuously, the strips have been broken down into plot arcs for purposes of publication; the plot summary that follows breaks the story down into these arcs for clarity. Burlew notes in the commentary of &quot;War and XPs&quot; that the strips contained within that volume were the first to be plotted with publication in mind from the very beginning. Several volumes have been released in book-only format: &quot;On the Origin of PCs,&quot; a prequel to the heroes&#x27; adventures; &quot;Start of Darkness,&quot; a prequel to the villains&#x27; escapades; &quot;Good Deeds Gone Unpunished,&quot; a prequel that includes stories about various residents of Azure City; and &quot;Snips, Snails and Dragon Tails,&quot; a collection of all the &quot;Dragon Magazine&quot; comics plus 80 pages of new material.

===&quot;Dungeon Crawlin&#x27; Fools&quot;===
The webcomic begins with the Order fighting goblins and other monsters on their way through the Dungeon of Dorukan (although the first volume of the printed edition later included a preamble showing how the Order finds and enters the Dungeon). They are led by Roy Greenhilt on a quest to destroy a lich sorcerer named Xykon. Roy is motivated by nightly visits from the ghost of his father, from whom he receives a cryptic warning.

The Order briefly joins forces with an adventuring party known as the Linear Guild, led by Nale (the evil twin of the Order&#x27;s happy-go-lucky bard, Elan). The Guild eventually betrays the Order, but the Order prevails due to Roy&#x27;s sudden understanding of his father&#x27;s prophecy. Durkon Thundershield, the Order&#x27;s dutiful dwarf cleric of Thor, enjoys a sexual encounter with the Guild&#x27;s dwarf cleric of Loki Hilgya Firehelm, but they shortly afterwards part in tears.

The Order goes on to battle Xykon near a mysterious magical gate. Xykon shatters Roy&#x27;s ancestral sword, but before he can release his ace-in-the-hole (a powerful creature known as the Monster in the Darkness), Roy flings him into a deadly mystic rune that protects the gate. Xykon&#x27;s body is destroyed, but his disembodied soul is ferreted to safety by his lieutenant, Redcloak, in his phylactery. The book ends with Elan accidentally destroying the entire dungeon, including the gate, by activating another magic rune. The Order escapes to safety. The printed book contains strips 1–121, plus extras.

===&quot;No Cure for the Paladin Blues&quot;===
The Order travels to Wooden Forest, where Vaarsuvius slays a black dragon so they can loot its hoard to retrieve a rare &quot;starmetal&quot; to repair Roy&#x27;s broken sword. The party is arrested by the paladin Miko Miyazaki for destroying the magical gate in the Dungeon of Dorukan. While stopping at an inn, the party loses the dragon&#x27;s treasure in an explosion, the shock of which renders Haley unable to speak coherently (rendered as cryptograms in the comic).

In Azure City, Belkar is imprisoned separately from the rest of the Order but escapes, murdering a guard in the process. The others are put on trial before Miko&#x27;s liege, the elderly Lord Shojo (and his cat, Mr. Scruffy), who informs them that the gate they destroyed is one of five gates that reinforce the structure of the universe. Without them, a god-killing abomination known as the Snarl would escape and destroy all of creation. The five gates were each built by a member of an adventuring party who defeated the Snarl in the past, and, with one exception, named after their creators: Dorukan, Lirian, Soon, Girard Draketooth, Kraagor (who was killed in battle) and the halfling Serini Toormuck (who named her gate in honor of Kraagor rather than herself). Dorukan&#x27;s and Lirian&#x27;s Gates have now both been destroyed; Soon&#x27;s Gate is located in Azure City.

The Order is acquitted with the help of Celia, a sylph they had aided in the Dungeon of Dorukan. Belkar, however, is recaptured by Miko and returned to prison for his murder of the guard. Shojo reveals that the trial was a sham to recruit the Order to defend the remaining gates. Roy reluctantly agrees once he learns that Xykon has survived and is recruiting a massive army of hobgoblins to seize the remaining gates. As a condition for his agreement, he has Belkar released on bail, with a magic rune on his forehead (called a &quot;Mark of Justice&quot;) that will trigger a curse if he violates certain conditions. In addition, each member of the Order receives a boon, one of which is the repair of Roy&#x27;s sword. The printed book contains strips 122–301, plus extras.

===&quot;War and XPs&quot;===
In Azure City, Celia and Roy begin a romantic relationship, and Celia gives Roy a talisman which will summon her when broken. The Order travels to Sunken Valley to consult an Oracle as to which Gate Xykon will target next. Roy phrases the question poorly and receives the misleading answer that, out of Girard&#x27;s and Kraagor&#x27;s Gate, Xykon will approach Girard&#x27;s first; in fact, Xykon&#x27;s army embarks for Azure City.

The Order makes a brief diversion to Cliffport to confront the Linear Guild, who have kidnapped Roy&#x27;s sister Julia. After Nale frames Elan for the Linear Guild&#x27;s crimes, Elan escapes from prison and reunites with Haley with the help of a dashing swordsman named Julio Scoundrel. Haley recovers her speech and confesses her love for Elan, who reciprocates.

The Order returns to Azure City to ask Lord Shojo for further directions. Miko, who does not know about the plan to find the Gates but does know about Xykon&#x27;s army, overhears the conversation and jumps to the conclusion that both are in league with Xykon. She strikes her master down, and is immediately stripped of her paladin status by her gods and imprisoned.

Xykon&#x27;s hobgoblins attack the city the next day. The Order helps Shojo&#x27;s heir, Hinjo, hold the city walls. Xykon attempts to circumvent the defenders, but Roy jumps onto the zombified dragon that Xykon is riding, and the two duel once more. Xykon overpowers Roy and sends him falling to his death. Xykon and Redcloak attempt to activate Soon&#x27;s Gate, which is hidden within a gem embedded in the royal throne, but Miko, having escaped from prison, destroys it to prevent this. In the ensuing explosion, Miko is killed, and Xykon and Redcloak escape. The city falls to the hobgoblins. Haley and Belkar become separated from the party when they go to recover Roy&#x27;s corpse, while the others sail away with Hinjo and the surviving Azurites. The printed book contains strips 302–484, plus extras.

===&quot;Don&#x27;t Split the Party&quot;===
Roy finds himself in the Afterlife with his father, who cannot rest until Xykon is gone. Roy is found worthy of entrance to paradise, but he returns to his father&#x27;s side when he learns that almost four months have passed. Looking down into the mortal realm, he sees that Haley and Belkar have formed an underground resistance movement in hobgoblin-occupied Azure City. Haley accidentally breaks Roy&#x27;s talisman and summons Celia, who convinces her to look for the other half of the party.

They first return to Sunken Valley in the hope that the Oracle can restore Roy to life, but he denies having any such power. In the ensuing quarrel, Belkar stabs the Oracle to death, thus triggering his Mark of Justice; he becomes ill. (The Oracle, resurrected after they leave, tells Roy&#x27;s eavesdropping ghost that Belkar will die within the year.) Their travels take them to Greysky City, where Haley is betrayed by one of her old friends in the Thieves&#x27; Guild, but the Order triumphs over the Guild in the ensuing battle. Belkar&#x27;s Mark of Justice is removed by a priest of Loki, and he decides to become more helpful to his teammates.

Meanwhile, Elan, Durkon, and Vaarsuvius foil a plot to assassinate Hinjo, and Vaarsuvius kills the ringleader (a nobleman named Kubota). Vaarsuvius then flies to an isolated island to search for Haley, where s/he is attacked and defeated by the mother of the black dragon whom s/he had killed during &quot;No Cure for the Paladin Blues&quot;. After the dragon threatens to kill Vaarsuvius&#x27; children, s/he contracts with three archfiends to rent the souls of three evil spellcasters; in exchange each archfiend earns temporary possession of Vaarsuvius&#x27; soul. S/he then kills the black dragon and her entire lineage with an epic &quot;Familicide&quot; spell from one of the souls.

Loath to waste this increased arcane power, Vaarsuvius teleports to Azure City to defeat Xykon. Here s/he encounters a paladin named O-Chul, a prisoner of Xykon and Redcloak who has secretly befriended Xykon&#x27;s Monster in the Darkness. Vaarsuvius is knocked out during the battle and loses access to the &quot;rented&quot; souls, but O-Chul breaks free and comes to Vaarsuvius&#x27; aid. Xykon&#x27;s phylactery falls into a storm drain and is lost.

Vaarsuvius and O-Chul are accidentally teleported to Hinjo&#x27;s fleet in the nick of time by the Monster in the Darkness. There, the Order regroups and Durkon resurrects Roy. The story arc ends with the Order sailing towards the next gate and Vaarsuvius apologizing to the neglected familiar Blackwing, who tells Vaarsuvius that it saw what appeared to be another world in the rift in space caused by the Snarl. The printed book contains strips 485–672, plus extras.

===&quot;Blood Runs in the Family&quot;===
While O-Chul and fellow paladin Lien travel north to Kraagor&#x27;s gate, the Order sails to the Western Continent. Their search for Girard&#x27;s Gate takes them to the Empire of Blood, where Tarquin, the Empress of Blood&#x27;s chief general (and the true power behind the throne), dramatically reveals himself to be Elan&#x27;s father. Tarquin gives the Order a tip that Girard&#x27;s relative Orrin Draketooth can be found in Windy Canyon. However, Tarquin and the Linear Guild join forces and plot to seize the gate for themselves.

Meanwhile, in Azure City, Redcloak&#x27;s troops recover Xykon&#x27;s phylactery and destroy the resistance&#x27;s base. Redcloak, who is plotting against Xykon, gives him a false phylactery and keeps the real one for himself; Xykon hides the fake in a secret fortress in the Astral Plane.

The Order discovers a magically cloaked pyramid in Windy Canyon, but once inside finds the entire Draketooth clan dead — an unexpected result of Vaarsuvius&#x27;s &quot;Familicide&quot; spell, which causes them to flee into the pyramid in horror. The Linear Guild arrives shortly after in hot pursuit. Belkar, Durkon, and Tarquin become separated from their respective groups in the ensuing battle. Belkar and Durkon encounter Tarquin&#x27;s cleric Malack, who kills Durkon, turning him into a vampire thrall. Belkar reunites with the Order and they continue deeper into the pyramid, overcoming various traps and illusions along the way.

When they discover the gate, Roy decides to destroy it, and consequently the entire pyramid, rather than risk it falling into the hands of Evil. Vaarsuvius, in an adjacent corridor, tries to tell him not to, but is temporarily dragged into hell as one of the archfiends collects on their debt. Again the Order sees what appears to be another world in the rift.

With Tarquin gone, Nale takes the opportunity to kill Malack, freeing Durkon who rejoins the Order. Tarquin kills Nale for disobedience upon returning and sends a vast army to attack the Order. With the help of Julio Scoundrel swooping in at the last moment, the Order is triumphant. Tarquin is left in the middle of the desert as the Order flies away on Julio&#x27;s airship towards the last Gate.

The final strip reveals that the Northern death goddess Hel has placed a spirit in the vampirized body of Durkon, and plans for the spirit to bring ruin to the Dwarven lands as the real Durkon helplessly struggles trapped in his own body. The printed book contains strips 673–946, plus extras.

===&quot;Utterly Dwarfed&quot;===
Julio&#x27;s airship gets damaged in a storm, and the Order stop in the steampunk-inspired gnome town of Tinkertown to repair it. Haley deals with her old enemies, while Roy and Durkon search for a cleric who can cure Durkon&#x27;s vampirism. The vampire spirit possessing Durkon&#x27;s body forces Durkon to show him his memories so as to fool the rest of the Order into thinking he is the same person. They encounter Veldrina and Wrecan, who are traveling to the Godsmoot, an interfaith council of clerics. The Order flies the pair to the Godsmoot with the goal of restoring Durkon to life.

At the Godsmoot, they discover that due to the threat of the Snarl, the gods are casting votes (conveyed through their mortal representatives) on whether to destroy the world and start over. Vampire Durkon, revealed to be the High Priest of Hel, votes in favor of the destruction, causing a tie. Roy and Vampire Durkon fight to a standstill; the demigods&#x27; priests vote and also end up in a tie – with the priest of Dvalin needing to consult with the Dwarven Council before he can cast a vote.

Vampire Durkon is now revealed to have turned a number of other people into vampires behind closed doors before the vote; he and most of them teleport out to the dwarven lands (leaving one as a replacement High Priest) to dominate the Council so they will vote in Hel&#x27;s favor. The Order regroups and flies off to the dwarven city of Firmament, their journey plagued by frost-giant attacks and mutiny.

O-Chul and Lien reach the North Pole. There, they watch Xykon&#x27;s party attempt to find Kraagor&#x27;s Gate, which is hidden behind one of hundreds of dungeon doors leading from a ravine. The Monster in the Darkness marks the doors they have already tried with paint, but when the others&#x27; backs are turned also marks other doors in order to stymie their plans.

In Firmament the Order gain allies (among them Hilgya Firehelm, accompanied by her and Durkon&#x27;s infant son Kudzu) and fight newly vampirized dwarves. The vampires manage to hypnotize most of the Order, ruining their plans and leaving all of them unconscious. However, in the meantime Durkon tricks Vampire Durkon into absorbing the rest of his memories all at once, effectively turning him into a copy of Durkon for long enough to get their body destroyed by Belkar.

Durkon&#x27;s soul ascends to the afterlife along with that of another dwarf cleric (Minrah Shaleshoe). They encounter Thor, who reveals that their world is the latest of countless many created by the gods as temporary prisons for the Snarl. Having been created by &quot;four&quot; pantheons, the Snarl is stronger than anything created by only three, and always destroys its prison eventually. However, Thor reveals that a fourth pantheon has arisen in this world consisting (so far) only of the goblins&#x27; god The Dark One. He tasks Durkon with recruiting Redcloak, the Dark One&#x27;s high priest, to help stop the Snarl for good.

Hilgya resurrects Durkon. The Order and an army of dwarves led by Minrah (who has also been resurrected) storm the Dwarven Council chambers and defeat the vampires. Using a magical hammer gifted him by Thor, Durkon damages the Council table sufficiently to get the vote delayed indefinitely. The Order embarks for Kraagor&#x27;s Gate, with Minrah joining them. Meanwhile, O-Chul and Lien are kidnapped and drugged by invisible attackers.

The printed book contains strips 947–1189, plus extras.

=== Book 7 ===
The Order reaches the North Pole, where Kraagor&#x27;s Gate is hidden. They investigate the paladins&#x27; disappearance, but Durkon and Minrah abscond (against Roy&#x27;s orders) in an unsuccessful bid to win over Redcloak to Thor&#x27;s cause. In the ensuing fight, the two dwarves are routed by Redcloak, Xykon, and others; they hide, tricking the villains into seeking them behind one of the many doors, then rejoin the rest of the Order. With Xykon&#x27;s party close on their trail, the Order take refuge behind one of the doors. They bypass a magical trap laid across the threshold, which proves to be a teleport gate when the villains cross it and vanish.

O-Chul and Lien wake to find themselves chained to a wall at the mercy of Serini Toormuck, now elderly and part troll due to a past accident. Toormuck fears that they and the Order will destroy the last Gate and, with it, the world, rather than let Xykon win; on that basis, she proceeds to ambush the Order with the aid of her adopted child, a trusting beholder named Sunny. The Order prevails and restrains her, releasing the paladins. Eventually they manage to convince her that saving the world from destruction requires stopping Xykon, and she agrees, grudgingly, to ally with them.
==Commentary on role-playing games==
Much of the humor of &quot;The Order of the Stick&quot; is based on roleplaying games (particularly the &quot;Dungeons and Dragons&quot; 3rd Edition ruleset), with characters freely discussing game mechanics, such as experience points, skill sets, and random encounters. The characters know very well that they live in a world controlled by the rules of roleplaying games, but attempt to function normally within it, often with nonsensical results. Characters have been shown browsing through rulebooks for the &quot;D&amp;D&quot; game to select a certain monster for use or to learn about a new class. Common techniques of players and Dungeon Masters are spoofed, such as the weather of the campaign world changing to herald a dramatic encounter, or a player who does not bother to complete the details of his character&#x27;s backstory. Burlew&#x27;s satirical humor addresses many of the clichés of the fantasy genre as a whole, often by twisting them in new and different ways.

Burlew occasionally creates characters and situations specifically to highlight what he considers common problems and deficits among roleplayers. The controversial paladin Miko Miyazaki is one such character; Burlew has said that she represents the division among players of the game over whether or not one character should be allowed to &quot;police&quot; the remainder of an adventuring party. He has referred to her as being &quot;one of the WORST ways to play a paladin.&quot; Another example is the creation myth of the &quot;OOTS&quot; world, which shows a group of gods bickering over how to create the world—accidentally creating the world-devouring Snarl through their refusal to compromise. In the commentary for &quot;No Cure for the Paladin Blues&quot;, Burlew likens this story to the squabbles that might arise in a group of roleplayers, which threaten to destroy the fun that they have created together.

The comic occasionally directly comments on current events in the roleplaying game industry by the inclusion of characters that represent the participants. In the last three comics to appear in &quot;Dragon&quot;, the &quot;OOTS&quot; members encounter a green dragon that serves as a self-identified allegorical figure for the magazine itself. The dragon recounts the magazine&#x27;s long history, complete with representations of its various publishers, including a wizard of the coast and Mr. Potato Head (the signature toy of Wizards of the Coast&#x27;s corporate parent, Hasbro). In the final issue, the dragon escapes the wizard of the coast&#x27;s lawyers by flying through a room featuring characters from many of the comics that have appeared in &quot;Dragon&quot; over the years, such as &quot;Wormy&quot;, &quot;Knights of the Dinner Table&quot;, and &quot;What&#x27;s New with Phil &amp; Dixie&quot;, before the &quot;OOTS&quot; characters directly thank the dragon for its long years of service. This theme was employed again when a character in the online strip voiced Burlew&#x27;s eulogy to &quot;D&amp;D&quot; co-creator Gary Gygax immediately after his death was announced.&lt;ref name=&quot;News3/4/2008&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The memorial comic was widely cited among websites covering Gygax&#x27;s death. Burlew created a similar tribute strip for &quot;D&amp;D&quot; co-creator Dave Arneson after his death.

==Reaction==
Due to its reflection of the comical excesses of gaming culture, &quot;The Order of the Stick&quot; has been hailed as &quot;must reading&quot; for those who play roleplaying games and &quot;the roleplaying comic to beat&quot;. Critics sometimes cite the insular nature of in-jokes regarding the &quot;D&amp;D&quot; rules that crop up regularly (especially in the early part of the comic&#x27;s run) as a barrier to new readers, noting that without a working knowledge of fantasy roleplaying games, much of the humor may fall flat. However, the comic is just as often seen as being accessible to casual readers without such gaming knowledge due to the strength of the main cast&#x27;s portrayals and abundance of character-based humor. The comic has been praised for its &quot;shrewd writing&quot; and &quot;increasingly intricate and cleverly scripted adventures&quot; as well as its execution. One webcomic critic has called it &quot;one of the few very simplistically drawn comics that can pull [off] an extensive storyline.&quot; Particular praise has been given to the scenes depicting the siege of Azure City, which has been called &quot;a war worthy of Peter Jackson.&quot;

The comic&#x27;s stick figure art has received mixed reviews. Some critics praise its &quot;surprisingly expressive art&quot;, with &quot;PvP&quot; cartoonist Scott Kurtz adding that the comic would not be as funny or have as much heart if the characters were drawn in any other style. &quot;Time magazine&quot; and &quot;Black Gate&quot; praised the comic characters for their expressiveness, even though they are drawn as stick figures. Lev Grossman of &quot;Time&quot; said that Burlew sometimes &quot;imbues them with a weird epic majesty&quot;. Others denounce its simple geometric characters as &quot;merely functional&quot; or (as fellow webcomic creator Jackie Lesnick put it) only &quot;good for someone who isn&#x27;t really an artist&quot;. Burlew has defended his art style several times in public statements, stating he has no lack of proficiency at drawing, but intentionally developed a clean and simple style to help the reader focus on the humor. He has pointed out that the primary goal of comic art is to communicate the actions of the characters, which his style does as well as any other. Burlew has addressed similar criticisms within the comic itself several times, either by contrasting his usual art with more realistic drawings or by simply putting self-deprecating dialogue regarding his style into the mouths of characters.

Surveys of webcomic site traffic held since May 2007 have consistently placed &quot;The Order of the Stick&quot; as one of the 10 most widely read webcomics in existence. Burlew has estimated that he has about 650,000 dedicated readers and up to one million additional casual readers. Every day, thousands of the comic&#x27;s readers participate in the comic&#x27;s official forums, which feature discussion of &quot;The Order of the Stick&quot; and roleplaying games in general. Many participants are noted for adopting avatars drawn in emulation of Burlew&#x27;s stick figure style, with some fans even creating additional &quot;fancomics&quot; in that style on the site&#x27;s message board or their own sites.

===Awards and recognition===
&quot;The Order of the Stick&quot; received two nominations for Britain&#x27;s 2008 Eagle Awards, for Favourite Web-Based Comic and Favourite Original Graphic Novel (for &quot;Start of Darkness&quot;). &quot;OOTS&quot; won the former category, but lost the latter one to Alan Moore&#x27;s &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Black Dossier&quot;. In announcing the results on his site, Burlew stated he was pleased that he didn&#x27;t win the Favourite Original Graphic Novel category, saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t think I want to live in a world where a parody stick figure comic beats one of the comic industry&#x27;s top writers.&quot; &quot;No Cure for the Paladin Blues&quot;, the comic&#x27;s second print compilation, won a 2007 Gold ENnie award. &quot;OOTS&quot; has been nominated for ten Web Cartoonist&#x27;s Choice Awards, of which it has won five. It was named Best Long Form Comic in 2008, Best Gaming Comic and Best Long Form Comic in 2007, and Best Fantasy Comic in 2006, and tied for Best Fantasy Comic in 2005.

The Museum of Comic and Cartoon Art in New York City included &quot;The Order of the Stick #443&quot; in its first webcomic-only exhibit, &quot;Infinite Canvas: The Art of Webcomics&quot;.

==Publications==

&quot;The Order of the Stick&quot; books are published by Giant in the Playground Games, a small press publishing company formed by &quot;OOTS&quot; creator Rich Burlew. The books are widely distributed to online and brick-and-mortar retailers in the hobby game market as well as to comic book direct retailers. Each book features an introduction by the author as well as a preface written in the voice of one of the characters from the strip. The compilation books feature a number of pages of &quot;bonus material&quot;—primarily additional strips inserted into various points in the story. The bonus material for &quot;Dungeon Crawlin&#x27; Fools&quot;, for example, includes a nine-page opening to the story that Burlew felt introduced the characters in a more organic way than the online comic&#x27;s cast page.

On Jan. 22nd, 2012, Burlew launched a Kickstarter campaign to get &quot;The Order of the Stick: War and XPs&quot; back into print, which eventually raised enough money to reprint the whole book series. The drive was the most funded creative work in Kickstarter up to that point, getting more than twenty times the original goal for a total of $1,254,120. During the reprint drive Burlew committed, as rewards for meeting increasing funding goals, to write eight new short stories either about specific characters or in alternative non-canon settings; the characters for three of these stories were chosen by backers as part of the pledge reward.

==Board game==
In partnership with APE Games, Giant in the Playground released the first &quot;OOTS&quot; game, &quot;The Order of the Stick Adventure Game: The Dungeon of Dorukan&quot;. The game, which was released in September 2006, utilizes cards and a board, and has strong influences from games such as &quot;Talisman&quot; and &quot;Dungeon!&quot;, as well as the less-known &quot;Kings &amp; Things&quot;.

&quot;The Dungeon of Dorukan&quot; is designed for 2–6 people, aged twelve and older. Each player controls one member of the OOTS team to explore the dungeon and hunt down Xykon. The player is able to train their chosen member with a variety of shtick cards. Each character provides a different gaming experience, and the players have the ability to either aid or harm their teammates.

The game has received two expansion sets. The first one, &quot;The Shortening&quot;, released in 2011 by APE Games, included new cards and rules to reduce the duration of the game. The second 20 card mini-expansion, &quot;Sticky Shticks&quot;, was announced as a pledge reward for the 2012 &quot;reprint drive&quot; Kickstarter campaign. It features cards that can be stuck to characters giving them some penalties.

<doc id="1015821" wikidata="Q864495" url="?curid=1015821" title="Japan Railways Group">
<text>The Japan Railways Group, more commonly known as the or simply JR, is a group of railway companies in Japan that underwent division and privatization of the government-owned Japanese National Railways (JNR) on April 1, 1987. It consists of six passenger railway companies, one freight railway company, and two non-service companies. Most of the liability of the JNR was assumed by the JNR Settlement Corporation.

The JR Group operates a large proportion of intercity rail service (including the Shinkansen high-speed rail lines) and commuter rail service.

[[Hokkaido Railway Company|JR Hokkaido]], [[Shikoku Railway Company|JR Shikoku]], and [[Japan Freight Railway Company|JR Freight]] (JRF) are governed by the , also known as the &quot;JR Companies Act&quot;, and are under the control of the public Japan Railway Construction, Transport and Technology Agency (JRTT), while [[East Japan Railway Company|JR East]], [[Central Japan Railway Company|JR Central]], [[West Japan Railway Company|JR West]], and [[Kyushu Railway Company|JR Kyushu]] are completely floated in the stock market; in addition, JR East, JR Central and JR West are constituents of the Nikkei 225 and TOPIX 100 indices. Because the railways used to be owned by the government, Japanese people generally make a distinction between JR railways (including former JR lines that are now third sector) and other private railways, and JR railways are almost always denoted differently from other private railways when shown on maps.

==Background==

By the 1970s, passenger and freight business had declined, and fare increases had failed to keep up with higher labor costs.

The JR Group companies were formed out of the privatization of the Japanese National Railways in 1987.

The seven JR companies recorded a total profit of ¥ 88.9 million in 1988.

==Ownership==

In 1987, the government of Japan took steps to divide and privatize JNR. While division of operations began in April of that year, privatization was not immediate: initially, the government retained ownership of the companies. Privatization of some of the companies began in the early 1990s. By October 2016, all of the shares of JR East, JR Central, JR West and JR Kyushu had been offered to the market and they are now publicly traded. On the other hand, all of the shares of JR Hokkaido, JR Shikoku and JR Freight are still owned by Japan Railway Construction, Transport and Technology Agency, an independent administrative institution of the state.

All the JR Group companies operating in the Honshū region are constituents of the Nikkei 225 and TOPIX 100 indexes.
==Companies==

The Japan Railways Group consists of seven operating companies and two other companies that do not provide rail service. The operating companies are organized into six passenger operators and a nationwide freight operator. Unlike some other groups of companies, the JR Group is made up of independent companies, and it does not have group headquarters or a holding company to set the overall business policy.

The six passenger railways of the JR Group are separated by region. Nearly all their services are within the prescribed geographic area. However, some long-distance operations extend beyond the boundaries. The &quot;Shirasagi&quot; train service between and , for instance, uses JR West rolling stock but the segment of track between Nagoya and is owned by JR Central, whose crew manage the train on that section.

Japan Freight Railway Company operates all freight service on the network previously owned by JNR.

In addition, the group includes two non-operating companies. These are the Railway Technical Research Institute and Railway Information Systems Co., Ltd.

To cover various non-railway business areas, each regional operator in the JR Group has its own group of subsidiary companies with names like &quot;JR East Group&quot; and &quot;JR Shikoku Group&quot;.
==Network==
JR maintains a nationwide railway network as well as common ticketing rules that it inherited from JNR. Passengers may travel across several JR companies without changing trains and without purchasing separate tickets. However, trains running across the boundaries of JR companies have been reduced.

JR maintains the same ticketing rules based on the JNR rules and has an integrated reservation system known as MARS (jointly developed with Hitachi). Some types of tickets (passes), such as Japan Rail Pass and Seishun 18 Ticket, are issued as &quot;valid for all JR lines&quot; and accepted by all passenger JR companies.

==Unions==
Various unions represent workers at the different JR Group companies, such as the National Railway Workers&#x27; Union, All Japan Construction, Transport and General Workers&#x27; Union, Doro-Chiba, and the Japan Confederation of Railway Workers&#x27; Unions.

<text>USS &quot;Grenadier&quot; (SS-525), a &quot;Tench&quot;-class submarine, was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the grenadier, a soft-finned deep sea fish of the &quot;Macrouridae&quot; with a long, tapering body and short, pointed tail family, also known as rattails.

==History==

===Construction===
The contract to build &quot;Grenadier&quot; was awarded to the Boston Naval Shipyard, and her keel was laid down on 8 February 1944 in Boston, Massachusetts. She was launched on 15 December 1944 but was not christened until 10 February 1951. The seven year and two day period between keel laying and commissioning is the second longest in history for a United States Navy submarine after USS &quot;Pogy&quot; (SSN-647). She was sponsored by Mrs. John A. Fitzgerald, wife of the first &quot;Grenadier&quot;’s last commanding officer, and commissioned the same day with Commander Henry G. Reaves, Jr. in command.

===Early career===
One of the first Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program (GUPPY) submarines, &quot;Grenadier&quot; was equipped with a snorkel to permit indefinite running in an awash condition. &quot;Grenadier&quot; proved the worth of this device during her shakedown. Returning from the Caribbean Sea cruise, the new submarine made the seven-day voyage from Guantanamo Bay to New London, Connecticut, submerged. Almost two years of intensive training exercises out of New London were capped by her first yard overhaul at Philadelphia, extending from 16 December 1952 to 22 April 1953.

In June 1953 &quot;Grenadier&quot; participated in the annual midshipman cruise to Rio de Janeiro and other Brazilian ports. Returning to New London via the Caribbean Sea, she then supported ASW exercises during November, as an aircraft carrier task force perfected its antisubmarine operations. &quot;Grenadier&quot; continued training and battle exercises along the New England coast and off the Virginia Capes and in August 1955 cruised to Montreal, Quebec, via the St. Lawrence River.

&quot;Grenadier&quot; departed New London 3 January 1956 on the first of several Mediterranean Sea cruises. During a three-month deployment she steamed throughout the Mediterranean and both showed the flag and participated in attack and antisubmarine exercises with various units of the Sixth Fleet. On two subsequent Mediterranean deployments from 8 November 1957 to 27 January 1958, and from 10 April to 8 August 1962 she operated with the Sixth Fleet to bolster peace keeping operations in that troubled region of the world.

Between these cruises, the submarine participated in exercises along the East Coast and was a frequent visitor to Caribbean waters. &quot;Grenadier&quot; operated out of New London until 15 September 1958, she transferred to Key West, Florida. From there &quot;Grenadier&quot; served more frequently in the Caribbean, and also patrolled and held exercises along the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts of Florida.

While on special antisubmarine exercises in the North Atlantic on the morning of 29 May 1959, &quot;Grenadier&quot;, in company with a patrol plane, sighted and photographed a Soviet submarine prowling the waters off Iceland. It was the first confirmed sighting of a Soviet submarine in the Atlantic.

===Cuban Missile Crisis===

&quot;Grenadier&quot; again confronted Soviet ships when the Cuban Missile Crisis threatened nuclear war in October 1962. In company with , , , and , she formed part of the American fleet that blockaded and quarantined Cuba. After the Soviet offensive missiles were pulled out of Cuba, &quot;Grenadier&quot; was one of several ships dispatched to Cuba in November to assert and confirm the United States&#x27;s rights and position there.

===Later career===
&quot;Grenadier&quot; continued patrols and training operations out of Key West. Assigned to SubRon 12, she participated in exercises along the Atlantic coast and in the Caribbean. In addition, she has provided valuable aid during the perfecting of advanced sonar and ASW equipment. She distinguished herself in 1966 gathering navigational data and other information in the Caribbean.

==Fate==

&quot;Grenadier&quot; was decommissioned, struck from the Naval Vessel Register and sold to Venezuela on 15 May 1973. Renamed the ARV &quot;Picua&quot; (&quot;Barracuda&quot;), she served in the Venezuelan Navy until 1990.

<text>David Marvin Blake (born January 18, 1970), better known by his stage names DJ Quik or Da Quiksta, is an American rapper and record producer from Compton, California, known for his production in the G-funk style of West Coast hip-hop. Blake has collaborated with Snoop Dogg, Kurupt, Tupac, Chingy, R. Kelly and Shaquille O&#x27;Neal, among others. As a recording artist himself, he is perhaps best known for his 1991 single &quot;Tonite&quot;, which within the top 50 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Blake&#x27;s stage name refers to his ability of producing songs in a short period of time.

==Early life==
Blake was born in Compton, California. He was inspired by funk and soul artists, such as Roger Troutman (who taught him the use of the talkbox, which became a trademark for Quik&#x27;s sound throughout his career) and George Clinton.

Blake began selling homemade mixtapes (notably &quot;The Red Tape&quot;, 1987) after he received a turntable for his 8th grade promotion. He began doing shows DJing around Southern California, many of which ended in rival gang-related altercations. He joined the Tree Top Piru Bloods, which he later regretted, stating that joining the gang &quot;was the dumbest shit.&quot;

At age 16 in 1986, Quik dropped out of high school, and his mother lost her home due to foreclosure. While she moved to Louisiana, Quik stayed in Compton and was homeless for a period of three years. He would later go on to say that after his success in the rap world, many of his family members &quot;popped up.&quot;

==Career==
===&quot;Quik Is the Name&quot;===
After gaining a mixtape following, Blake earned the interest of labels, including Profile Records and Ruthless Records. He signed to Profile Records in the summer of 1990, reportedly as the label&#x27;s first six-figure signee. Blake later regretted his contract, and was offered an advance of one million dollars by Eazy-E. Profile Records sent cease-and-desist letters to Ruthless Records.

His debut album, &quot;Quik Is the Name&quot;, was released in 1991. The album was led by the success of his two top 20 R&amp;B singles, &quot;Tonite&quot; and &quot;Born and Raised in Compton.&quot; The album ended up being number 10 on the album charts, and was Platinum by the RIAA. None of his successive albums reached the success of his debut, though they have been well received. He went on to produce &quot;2nd II None&quot;.

===&quot;Way 2 Fonky&quot;===
He released his second album, titled &quot;Way 2 Fonky&quot; in 1992. It was certified Gold by October 9. It included the successful singles &quot;Way 2 Fonky&quot; and &quot;Jus Lyke Compton.&quot; The year 1992 would also see him produce (along with Eazy-E) on &quot;Paid the Cost&quot;, the debut album by rap duo Penthouse Players Clique.

===&quot;Safe + Sound&quot;===
Before recording &quot;Safe + Sound&quot;, DJ Quik had previously scrapped an album, which he said was so horrible that he had to smash the masters.

As DJ Quik began to work on his third album, he started working with Suge Knight again. Their relationship dates back to 1988, before he sought refuge with a major label. He was signed to Suge&#x27;s independent label, Funky Enough Records, in 1988. The arrangement proved to be short lived. They linked up again in 1993 for another short-lived arrangement.

His third album &quot;Safe + Sound&quot;, released in 1995, reached number 14 on the Billboard 200. It featured friends 2nd II None, Kam, Playa Hamm and Hi-C. The album features the singles &quot;Safe + Sound&quot; and &quot;Summer Breeze.&quot; During the process of the album, Quik was feuding with rapper MC Eiht from Compton&#x27;s Most Wanted and long time friend AMG. Today, he is on good terms with MC Eiht.

Suge Knight is credited as the executive producer of &quot;Safe + Sound.&quot; His relationship with Suge led him to produce tracks on &quot;Above the Rim&quot;, &quot;Murder Was the Case&quot;, &quot;All Eyez on Me&quot;, &quot;Until the End of Time&quot;, &quot;Better Dayz&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s About Time&quot; and was on Death Row Records for a short period but never released an album while on the label. He also produced a 2nd II None album for Death Row Records, which never released.

Quik played a part on the Tupac album &quot;All Eyez On Me&quot;, though he is only credited for producing &quot;Heartz of Men&quot; on that album (in the credits he used his real name, David Blake, because he was under contract with Profile). He also did additional production and mixed half the album in over two days. Quik made another uncredited appearance on a song with Tupac named &quot;Thug Passion.&quot; He also produced on the albums &quot;Dogg Food&quot; and &quot;Tha Doggfather&quot;, although he received no credit. DJ Quik later went to say that he had some of the best times of his life when he worked with the label.

===&quot;Rhythm-al-ism&quot; and Beyond===
In 1996, Quik produced a track on &quot;House of Music&quot;, by Tony! Toni! Toné! The success of the Quik-produced single &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Down&quot; prompted &quot;House of Music&quot; to sell over 1 million copies. He also worked with Shaquille O&#x27;Neal on his &quot;You Can&#x27;t Stop the Reign&quot; album. DJ Quik later discovered Suga Free, a pimp turned rapper in 1997. Their relationship saw Quik serving as the producer on his debut album, &quot;Street Gospel&quot;. It reached number 27 on the Billboard R&amp;B albums chart. The album fell short of commercial expectations, but was praised by many underground rap fans in California, and is seen as a &quot;street classic&quot; by many of them. The DJ Quik production on this album was considered to be refreshing compared to the stereotypical West Coast G-Funk sound that had dominated most of the early 1990s, as he incorporated elements of jazz, funk, rhythm and blues, and even rock and roll to create instrumentals that caught the ears of many listeners. It was recorded in a record of 28 days.

In 1998 Quik released &quot;Rhythm-al-ism,&quot; his fourth studio album on Profile Records. This record was certified Gold in 1999, and contained the singles &quot;Hand in Hand (featuring 2nd II None and El Debarge) and &quot;You&#x27;z A Ganxta.&quot; It featured guest appearances by Nate Dogg, Snoop Dogg, AMG and Suga Free. That year he went on to produce for The Luniz, Shaquille O&#x27;Neal, Deborah Cox and Jermaine Dupri. He also produced on &quot;The Kingdom Come&quot; by rapper King Tee which ultimately never came out due to label problems. He also faced personal and professional tragedy when his nephew murdered his close friend and protégé Darryl Cortez Reed in 1998. In 1999, there was the release of &quot;Classic 220&quot; by 2nd II None, in which Quik played a huge part, along with production on Gap Band&#x27;s &quot;Y2K: Funkin&#x27; Till 2000 Comz&quot; album, Snoop Dogg&#x27;s &quot;No Limit Top Dogg&quot;, &quot;Suge Knight Represents: Chronic 2000&quot; and &quot;Deep Blue Sea (soundtrack)&quot;. This was compounded by the death of another friend and rapper Mausberg, who was subsequently murdered in 2000. That year, saw the release of rapper Mausberg&#x27;s album and DJ Quik&#x27;s &quot;Balance &amp; Options&quot;. Also production with Whitney Houston, Erick Sermon, 8Ball &amp; MJG, Xzibit and AMG.

After the lackluster sales of only 400,000 units of his fifth album, he was dropped by Arista Records, which had bought Profile Records. He produced for Kurupt, Big Syke, Janet Jackson, and Won G. He produced on &quot;Made (soundtrack)&quot; in 2001. That year also saw Suge Knight try to get Quik as the in-house producer for Death Row Records. In 2002, he released &quot;Under tha Influence&quot; under Ark 21 Records which sold only 200,000 units. He also produced Truth Hurts&#x27; only Top 10 pop hit &quot;Addictive&quot; that year. However, he had sampled a Hindi song by the name &quot;Thoda Resham Lagta Hai&quot; originally sung by the legendary Hindi singing prodigy Lata Mangeshkar on the record, and the copyright holders Saregama Music eventually filed a $500 million lawsuit against Truth Hurts&#x27; label, Aftermath Entertainment, that was amicably resolved by Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dre. The song instrumental was sampled in the Jamaican dancehall beat &quot;Bollywood Riddim.&quot; DJ Quik also produced and appeared on another track on Truth Hurts&#x27; debut LP, &quot;Truthfully Speaking&quot;, titled &quot;I&#x27;m Not Really Lookin.&quot; He worked with Talib Kweli, Will Smith and Shade Sheist that year.

Record problems and a plethora of others almost prompted Quik to retire. The album &quot;The Best of DJ Quik: Da Finale&quot; was originally going to be his last release. He later stated:
He later decided to come back. In 2003, Jay-Z commissioned Quik to produce on &quot;The Black Album&quot;. Rapper Chingy worked with Quik on his Jackpot which also proved to be a hit. He worked for Roscoe, Butch Cassidy, Nate Dogg, E-40, TQ and Hi-C. In 2003 he also saw 50 Cent become a bigger star, as the aforementioned Get Rich Or Die Tryin album featured In Da Club, which Quik did the drums for.

Ludacris got DJ Quik to produce on &quot;The Red Light District&quot; in 2004. He was also commissioned for a remix on the 2Pac album &quot;Loyal to the Game&quot;. He also worked with Knoc-turn&#x27;al and Suga Free that year.

===Mad Science Recordings===
In September 2005, DJ Quik released his first independent album on his own new label, Mad Science Recordings. The album is titled &quot;Trauma&quot; and reflects the turmoil in the producer&#x27;s &quot;musical&quot; life over the past few years. It was considered an independent success and has sold over 100,000 copies. In recent years he has worked with a 74-piece orchestra while working on the score to the movie &quot;Head of State&quot; with Marcus Miller.

On June 21, 2006, DJ Quik was convicted of assault on his sister and sentenced to five months in prison. The incident occurred in 2003, when he allegedly &quot;pistol-whipped&quot; her for extorting him, according to police reports. He was released early in October 2006. He went on to say that prison sentence gave him time to reflect on his life, and he later began getting rid of extra baggage.

In late 2007, DJ Quik and AMG formed the group the Fixxers. Along with the formation of the duo, he dropped the &quot;DJ&quot; from his name for the upcoming album and rapped as &quot;Quik.&quot; In March 2007 they signed a single deal with Interscope Records for the release of their album &quot;Midnight Life&quot; and promoted it with &quot;Can You Werk Wit Dat?&quot; However, the album was scrapped due to unauthorized actions by Hudson Melvin Baxter II (also known as &quot;Hud&quot;), who illegally put it up for sale on the internet in December 2007. The album was then spread across the Internet as a bootleg. In February 2008, Quik finished up mixing and producing for Snoop Dogg&#x27;s new record &quot;Ego Trippin&quot;. In the process of working with Snoop Dogg, a production group called QDT was formed. It stands for Quik-Dogg-Teddy and consists of DJ Quik, Snoop Dogg and Teddy Riley. A collaboration album with Tha Dogg Pound member Kurupt, titled &quot;BlaQKout&quot;, was released June 9, 2009.

===&quot;The Book of David&quot; (2011–present)===
DJ Quik released his eighth studio album &quot;The Book of David&quot; on April 19, 2011, which included appearances by Ice Cube, KK, Bun B, Bizzy Bone, Jon B., Kurupt, Dwele, and Suga Free, who once again worked with Quik. The album debuted at number 55 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, with first-week sales of 9,700 copies in the United States. It also entered at number 5 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top Rap Albums, number 12 on Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums and number 4 on Independent Albums. In its second week, it dropped to number ninety nine on the Billboard 200 with sales of 4,200. TMZ reported that for the album&#x27;s release party he took over a marijuana dispensary in Los Angeles on April 22, 2011, and in a matter of minutes the whole place was up in smoke. DJ Quik performed live with The Roots on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon with guest stars Jason Lee and Emma Roberts on June 10, 2011.

Kurupt confirmed in a 2011 interview with HipHopDx.com that &quot;next year, we will be working on our next album together, DJ Quik and Kurupt. Every year me and DJ Quik are gonna drop us one of these slizzappers!&quot;

Snoop Dogg joined forces with DJ Quik, Battlecat, The D.O.C. and others to create four songs for Dr. Dre&#x27;s Detox. According to Snoop, two of those songs would be solo cuts for Dre while the other two would be collaborations between Snoop and Dre. Two videos were released, both featuring all of these artists collectively working on the project and discussing the need to release quality work.

===&quot;Rosecrans&quot; EP, and later album===
In April 2016 Quik released a collaboration EP with fellow Compton rapper Problem. The EP included features such as The Game, Wiz Khalifa and more. On April 20, 2017, they released the &quot;Rosecrans&quot; project into an full-length collaboration album with extended features and extended songs.

==Feud with Compton&#x27;s Most Wanted==

DJ Quik got involved in a long tumultuous rivalry with fellow Compton rapper MC Eiht and his group Compton&#x27;s Most Wanted that lasted for six years. The feud traces back to a track on DJ Quik&#x27;s debut mixtape &quot;The Red Tape&quot;, in a line by Quik that was seen as indirectly disparaging N.W.A and directly disparaging Compton&#x27;s Most Wanted.

During that time, Quik was a member to the Tree Top Pirus and Eiht was a member of the 159th St. Tragniew Park Compton Crips. On the track &quot;Def Wish&quot; from CMW&#x27;s second album &quot;Straight Checkn &#x27;Em&quot;, is the line, &quot;Bittin&#x27; me quick, you can get the duck sick quick...&quot;. Fans of both artists assumed that to be a disparagement of Quik. With the misconstrued feud gaining momentum, Quik respond to CMW&#x27;s line in his song &quot;Way 2 Fonky&quot; &amp; &quot;The Last Word&quot;. CMW responded months later with a music video for Def Wish II, which featured a DJ Quik lookalike having a surreal nightmare of CMW chasing &amp; ambushing him leading to him getting killed &amp; with Def Wish III, leading to the peak of the rivalry. Quik responded to it &quot;Street Level Entrance&quot; &amp; &quot;Let You Havit&quot;, mentioning the &quot;Def Wish II&quot; music video, while facing label problems and had other music projects. However, on the soundtrack to the 1994 short film &quot;Murder Was The Case&quot;, on the track &quot;Dollaz + Sense&quot;, Quik ruthlessly verbally attacks Eiht, calling him a movie script killer (in reference to Eiht&#x27;s appearance in the critically acclaimed 1993 film Menace II Society), a coward, and more. Quik fanned the flames by performing the song at the 1995 Source Awards in New York City. The feud stayed quiet until April 1996, when Eiht responded to Quik on his second solo album &quot;Death Threatz&quot; which featured Def Wish IV (Tap That Azz) &amp; &quot;Killin&#x27; Nigguz&quot; which were the last diss tracks of their feud. The feud between Quik and Eiht slowly faded in 1997 following the deaths of Tupac and The Notorious B.I.G., but did not actually end until 1998, where Snoop Dogg, Daz Dillinger, and other West Coast rappers helped Eiht and Quik reconcile. Since then, Quik and Eiht have collaborated on various songs. It has been considered by hip hop fans and critics as standing out as one of the longest active hip hop rivalries – from 1992 to 1998. Quik and MC Eiht appeared in an interview on July 21, 1999 on BET Tonight.

<doc id="1015846" wikidata="Q407646" url="?curid=1015846" title="Mannitol">
<text>Mannitol is a type of sugar alcohol used as a sweetener and medication. It is used as a low calorie sweetener as it is poorly absorbed by the intestines. As a medication, it is used to decrease pressure in the eyes, as in glaucoma, and to lower increased intracranial pressure. Medically, it is given by injection or inhalation. Effects typically begin within 15 minutes and last up to 8 hours.
Common side effects from medical use include electrolyte problems and dehydration. Other serious side effects may include worsening heart failure and kidney problems. It is unclear if use is safe in pregnancy. Mannitol is in the osmotic diuretic family of medications and works by pulling fluid from the brain and eyes.
The discovery of mannitol is attributed to Joseph Louis Proust in 1806. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It was originally made from the flowering ash and called manna due to its supposed resemblance to the Biblical food. Mannitol is on the World Anti-Doping Agency&#x27;s banned substances list due to concerns that it may mask prohibited drugs.

==Uses==
===Medical uses===
In the United States, mannitol is indicated for the reduction of intracranial pressure and treatment of cerebral edema and elevated intraocular pressure.

In the European Union, mannitol is indicated for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in adults aged 18 years and above as an add-on therapy to best standard of care.

Mannitol is used intravenously to reduce acutely raised intracranial pressure until more definitive treatment can be applied, e.g., after head trauma. While mannitol injection is the mainstay for treating high pressure in the skull after a bad brain injury, it is no better than hypertonic saline as a first-line treatment. In treatment-resistant cases, hypertonic saline works better. Intra-arterial infusions of mannitol can transiently open the blood–brain barrier by disrupting tight junctions.

It may also be used for certain cases of kidney failure with low urine output, decreasing pressure in the eye, to increase the elimination of certain toxins, and to treat fluid build up.

Intraoperative mannitol prior to vessel clamp release during renal transplant has been shown to reduce post-transplant kidney injury, but has not been shown to reduce graft rejection.

Mannitol acts as an osmotic laxative in oral doses larger than 20 g, and is sometimes sold as a laxative for children.

The use of mannitol, when inhaled, as a bronchial irritant as an alternative method of diagnosis of exercise-induced asthma has been proposed. A 2013 systematic review concluded evidence to support its use for this purpose at this time is insufficient.

Mannitol is commonly used in the circuit prime of a heart lung machine during cardiopulmonary bypass. The presence of mannitol preserves renal function during the times of low blood flow and pressure, while the patient is on bypass. The solution prevents the swelling of endothelial cells in the kidney, which may have otherwise reduced blood flow to this area and resulted in cell damage.

Mannitol can also be used to temporarily encapsulate a sharp object (such as a helix on a lead for an artificial pacemaker) while it passes through the venous system. Because the mannitol dissolves readily in blood, the sharp point becomes exposed at its destination.

Mannitol is also the first drug of choice to treat acute glaucoma in veterinary medicine. It is administered as a 20% solution intravenously. It dehydrates the vitreous humor and, therefore, lowers the intraocular pressure. However, it requires an intact blood-ocular barrier to work.

===Food===
Mannitol increases blood glucose to a lesser extent than sucrose (thus having a relatively low glycemic index) so is used as a sweetener for people with diabetes, and in chewing gums. Although mannitol has a higher heat of solution than most sugar alcohols, its comparatively low solubility reduces the cooling effect usually found in mint candies and gums. However, when mannitol is completely dissolved in a product, it induces a strong cooling effect. Also, it has a very low hygroscopicity – it does not pick up water from the air until the humidity level is 98%. This makes mannitol very useful as a coating for hard candies, dried fruits, and chewing gums, and it is often included as an ingredient in candies and chewing gum. The pleasant taste and mouthfeel of mannitol also makes it a popular excipient for chewable tablets.

===Analytical chemistry===
Mannitol can be used to form a complex with boric acid. This increases the acid strength of the boric acid, permitting better precision in volumetric analysis of this acid.

===Other===
Mannitol is the primary ingredient of mannitol salt agar, a bacterial growth medium, and is used in others.

Mannitol is used as a cutting agent in various drugs that are used intranasally (snorted), such as heroin and cocaine. A mixture of mannitol and fentanyl (or fentanyl analogs) in ratio 1:10 is labeled and sold as &quot;China white&quot;, a popular heroin substitute.

Mannitol is a sugar alcohol with &quot;50-70 percent of the relative sweetness of sugar, which means more must be used to equal the sweetness of sugar. Mannitol lingers in the intestines for a long time and therefore often causes bloating and diarrhea.&quot;

== Contraindications ==
Mannitol is contraindicated in people with anuria, severe hypovolemia, pre-existing severe pulmonary vascular congestion or pulmonary edema, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and active intracranial bleeding except during craniotomy.

Adverse effects include hyponatremia and volume depletion leading to metabolic acidosis.

==Chemistry==
Mannitol is an isomer of sorbitol, another sugar alcohol; the two differ only in the orientation of the hydroxyl group on carbon 2. While similar, the two sugar alcohols have very different sources in nature, melting points, and uses.

==Production==
Mannitol is classified as a sugar alcohol; that is, it can be derived from a sugar (mannose) by reduction. Other sugar alcohols include xylitol and sorbitol.

===Industrial synthesis===
Mannitol is commonly produced via the hydrogenation of fructose, which is formed from either starch or sucrose (common table sugar). Although starch is a cheaper source than sucrose, the transformation of starch is much more complicated. Eventually, it yields a syrup containing about 42% fructose, 52% glucose, and 6% maltose. Sucrose is simply hydrolyzed into an invert sugar syrup, which contains about 50% fructose. In both cases, the syrups are chromatographically purified to contain 90–95% fructose. The fructose is then hydrogenated over a nickel catalyst into a mixture of isomers sorbitol and mannitol. Yield is typically 50%:50%, although slightly alkaline reaction conditions can slightly increase mannitol yields.

===Biosyntheses===
Mannitol is one of the most abundant energy and carbon storage molecules in nature, produced by a plethora of organisms, including bacteria, yeasts, fungi, algae, lichens, and many plants. Fermentation by microorganisms is an alternative to the traditional industrial synthesis. A fructose to mannitol metabolic pathway, known as the mannitol cycle in fungi, has been discovered in a type of red algae (&quot;Caloglossa leprieurii&quot;), and it is highly possible that other microorganisms employ similar such pathways. A class of lactic acid bacteria, labeled heterofermentive because of their multiple fermentation pathways, convert either three fructose molecules or two fructose and one glucose molecule into two mannitol molecules, and one molecule each of lactic acid, acetic acid, and carbon dioxide. Feedstock syrups containing medium to large concentrations of fructose (for example, cashew apple juice, containing 55% fructose: 45% glucose) can produce yields mannitol per liter of feedstock. Further research is being conducted, studying ways to engineer even more efficient mannitol pathways in lactic acid bacteria, as well as the use of other microorganisms such as yeast and &quot;E. coli&quot; in mannitol production. When food-grade strains of any of the aforementioned microorganisms are used, the mannitol and the organism itself are directly applicable to food products, avoiding the need for careful separation of microorganism and mannitol crystals. Although this is a promising method, steps are needed to scale it up to industrially needed quantities.

===Natural extraction===
Since mannitol is found in a wide variety of natural products, including almost all plants, it can be directly extracted from natural products, rather than chemical or biological syntheses. In fact, in China, isolation from seaweed is the most common form of mannitol production. Mannitol concentrations of plant exudates can range from 20% in seaweeds to 90% in the plane tree. It is a constituent of saw palmetto (&quot;Serenoa&quot;).

Traditionally, mannitol is extracted by the Soxhlet extraction, using ethanol, water, and methanol to steam and then hydrolysis of the crude material. The mannitol is then recrystallized from the extract, generally resulting in yields of about 18% of the original natural product. Another method of extraction is using supercritical and subcritical fluids. These fluids are at such a stage that no difference exists between the liquid and gas stages, so are more diffusive than normal fluids. This is considered to make them much more effective mass transfer agents than normal liquids. The super- or subcritical fluid is pumped through the natural product, and the mostly mannitol product is easily separated from the solvent and minute amount of byproduct.

Supercritical carbon dioxide extraction of olive leaves has been shown to require less solvent per measure of leaf than a traditional extraction – CO2 versus ethanol per olive leaf. Heated, pressurized, subcritical water is even cheaper, and is shown to have dramatically greater results than traditional extraction. It requires only water per of olive leaf, and gives a yield of 76.75% mannitol. Both super- and subcritical extractions are cheaper, faster, purer, and more environmentally friendly than the traditional extraction. However, the required high operating temperatures and pressures are causes for hesitancy in the industrial use of this technique.

==History==
In the early 1880s, Julije Domac elucidated the structure of hexene and mannitol obtained from Caspian manna. He determined the place of the double bond in hexene obtained from mannitol and proved that it is a derivative of a normal hexene. This also solved the structure of mannitol, which was unknown until then.

==Controversy==
The three studies that originally found high-dose mannitol effective in treating severe head injury were the subject of an investigation. Published in 2007 after the lead author Dr Julio Cruz&#x27;s death, the investigation questioned whether the studies had actually taken place. The co-authors of the paper were not able to confirm the existence of the study patients, and the Federal University of São Paulo, which Cruz gave as his affiliation, had never employed him. As a result of doubt surrounding Cruz&#x27;s work, an updated version of the Cochrane review excludes all studies by Julio Cruz, leaving only four studies. Due to differences in selection of control groups, a conclusion about the clinical use of mannitol has not been reached.

<doc id="1015847" wikidata="Q2878626" url="?curid=1015847" title="Evelyn Laye">
<text>Evelyn Laye (&quot;née&quot; Elsie Evelyn Lay; 10 July 1900 – 17 February 1996) was an English actress and singer known for her performances in operettas and musicals.

Born into a theatrical family, she made her professional début in 1915 aged fifteen and quickly established herself in musical comedy. By 1920 she was starring in leading roles in the West End at Daly&#x27;s and other theatres, becoming London&#x27;s highest-paid star. Her first marriage, in 1926, to the performer Sonnie Hale was brief and ended in divorce after he abandoned her for the singer Jessie Matthews.

Laye made her American debut in 1929 starring in Noël Coward&#x27;s musical &quot;Bitter Sweet&quot;. In the 1930s she divided her time between the West End and Broadway, and starred in American and British films.

She entertained naval personnel during the Second World War. Afterwards, when fashion turned against the romantic musicals in which she had made her reputation, Laye was frequently seen on the non-musical stage, appearing both in the classics, such as &quot;The School for Scandal&quot; and in new plays, often together with her second husband, the actor Frank Lawton. She was in several long-running comedies, including &quot;The Amorous Prawn&quot; in the 1950s and &quot;No Sex Please, We&#x27;re British&quot; in the 1970s. In addition she appeared in post-war musicals, both American and British.

Laye was still working into her early nineties, and appeared at Carnegie Hall in New York in 1991 in a concert of Coward&#x27;s music. She died in London in 1996, aged 95.

==Early years==
Elsie Evelyn Lay (known to her family and friends as &quot;Boo&quot;) was born in Bloomsbury, London, on 10 July 1900, the only child of Gilbert James Lay (1866–1926) and his wife Evelyn &quot;née&quot; Froud. Both parents were actors, and Gilbert Lay, whose stage name was Gilbert Laye, was also a manager; for some years he ran the Brighton Palace Pier. His wife was well known for playing principal boy in provincial pantomimes under her stage name, Evelyn Stuart. The younger Evelyn was educated at Folkestone and Brighton. 

Laye made her stage début at the age of three, walking on in a production at Folkestone, but she dated her theatrical career from August 1915, when she appeared at the Theatre Royal, Brighton in the melodrama &quot;Mr Wu&quot;. Her father did not wish her to follow a stage career, but she persisted.

After touring in &quot;Mr Wu&quot; in the role of Hilda Gregory, Laye made her first London appearance at the East Ham Palace on 24 April 1916, aged 15, in the revue &quot;Honi Soit&quot;, in which she subsequently toured. Back in London, at the Gaiety she took over the role of Leonie Bramble in &quot;The Beauty Spot&quot; (1918); later in the year, at the same theatre, she played Madeleine Manners in &quot;Going Up&quot;, and in 1920 she had the principal female role, Bessie Brent, in a revival of the 1894 show &quot;The Shop Girl&quot;. The original score was revised for this production and Herman Darewski and Arthur Wimperis added &quot;The Guards&#x27; Brigade&quot;, a lively march number in which Laye, dressed as a drum majorette, led a 60-piece marching band of real guardsmen.

===West End star===
In August 1922 Laye appeared as Prologue and Helen in the opérette &quot;Phi-Phi&quot; at the London Pavilion; her co-stars were Stanley Lupino, Arthur Roberts and Clifton Webb. She was then engaged for Daly&#x27;s Theatre, where she consolidated her position as a top star, appearing in May 1923 in the title role in a revival of &quot;The Merry Widow&quot;, with a cast that included Carl Brisson, Derek Oldham and George Graves. &quot;The Stage&quot; commented, &quot;Miss Evelyn Laye is most charming as the Widow, both vocally and histrionically, and her impersonation, as a whole, must be taken as the crowning point of her career to date&quot;.

Remaining at Daly&#x27;s after the run of &quot;The Merry Widow&quot;, Laye had what several London newspapers described as a triumph in &quot;Madame Pompadour&quot;, an adaptation of a Viennese operetta by Leo Fall. The critic J. T. Grein wrote, &quot;Evelyn Laye casts all her contemporary rivals into the shade ... Her complete success raises her to the leadership of her genre&quot;. The piece had, for its day, an unusually long run, with 469 performances.

Her next two starring roles were also at Daly&#x27;s: Alice in a new production of Fall&#x27;s 1909 musical &quot;The Dollar Princess&quot;, and the title role in &quot;Cleopatra&quot; (music by Oscar Straus, words by Harry Graham). On one occasion during the run of the latter she wore jewels, lent by a Parisian jeweller, worth £30,000 (nearly £2m in 2022 terms). Her career at Daly&#x27;s made her the most successful musical and operetta star – and the highest-paid star in any genre – in the West End. In the view of &quot;The Times&quot;, she was both careful and wise to stay for the moment in that area – &quot;the highly costumed world of Viennese elegance and soaring melody ... rather than enter the more crowded world of revue where Jessie Matthews, Gertrude Lawrence and Beatrice Lillie were all fighting for supremacy&quot;.

In January 1926 Laye made her first radio broadcasts for 2LO, the forerunner of the BBC. On 10 April of that year, she married John Robert Hale Monro, an actor whose stage name was Sonnie Hale. The marriage was not a success; within a year Laye found love letters written to Hale by Matthews, with whom he was then co-starring in C. B. Cochran&#x27;s revue &quot;This Year of Grace&quot;, in which they sang the romantic duet by Noël Coward, &quot;A Room with a View&quot;. Hale moved out and went off with Matthews. 

In April 1928 Laye starred in the opening production of the Piccadilly Theatre, &quot;Blue Eyes&quot;, a musical with words by Guy Bolton and Graham John and music by Jerome Kern; it ran at the Piccadilly and then at Daly&#x27;s for a total of 276 performances. After that, Laye was offered the leading role, Sari Linden, in Coward&#x27;s new musical, &quot;Bitter Sweet&quot;, but she was so distraught by Hale&#x27;s desertion that she turned the part down because the show was to be produced by Cochran, who had first brought Hale and Matthews together. She told Coward, &quot;I&#x27;d rather scrub floors than work for &quot;him&quot; again&quot;. &quot;Bitter Sweet&quot;, with Peggy Wood in the lead, was a considerable success in London, opening on 12 July 1929 and running until 9 May 1931. Realising her mistake in passing up the role, Laye made certain she was available to star in the Broadway production, which opened on 5 November 1929, her New York début.

Coward, who directed, privately recorded that Laye &quot;knocked spots off the wretched Peggy&quot; in the role, and praised her &quot;grace and charm and assurance&quot; provoking &quot;one of the most prolonged outbursts of cheering I have ever heard in the theatre&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; critic wrote of &quot;a voice sweet in quality and full in tone, an acting and singing skill equal to that of Mr Coward&#x27;s composition&quot;. Another New York critic wrote that Laye was &quot;the fairest prima donna this side of heaven&quot;. After the New York production closed, Laye played Sari in London for the final weeks of the West End run.

===1930s===

Through the 1930s Laye divided her time between Britain and the US. In 1931 she went to Hollywood to make the film &quot;One Heavenly Night&quot;. She played in two long-running London musicals, &quot;Helen&quot; (1932) and &quot;Give Me a Ring&quot; (1933). Her British films of the period included &quot;Waltz Time&quot; (1933), &quot;Princess Charming&quot; (1934) and &quot;Evensong&quot; (1934). In MGM&#x27;s 1934 film &quot;The Night is Young&quot; she introduced Sigmund Romberg&#x27;s song &quot;When I Grow Too Old to Dream&quot;.

In 1934, having divorced Hale, Laye married her second husband, the actor Frank Lawton. The marriage lasted until his death in 1969; they had no children. 

In 1935 Laye returned to the US, in a revival of &quot;Bitter Sweet&quot; in Los Angeles and then San Francisco, and appeared on Broadway in &quot;Sweet Aloes&quot; the following year. By this time, in the words of &quot;The Times&quot;, Laye &quot;was the toast of two continents&quot;. In London Laye played Princess Anna in &quot;Paganini&quot; with Richard Tauber in the title role (1937), and in New York she played Natalie Rives in &quot;Between the Devil&quot;, co-starring with Jack Buchanan. On her return to England she made her first appearances in variety at the London Palladium in 1938, and in the same year she made her pantomime debut, as Prince Florizel in &quot;The Sleeping Beauty&quot;.

===1940s and 1950s===
During the Second World War, Laye became the chairman of the naval section of ENSA, arranging entertainments for naval personnel. The BBC reported at the time that she was &quot;indefatigable in her duties ... she has organised and appeared in concert after concert to entertain the Navy&quot;. In her own performances she focused initially on variety and revue. She was sufficiently reconciled with Cochran to appear in his 1940 revue, &quot;Lights Up&quot;, at the Savoy, co-starring with Martyn Green and Clifford Mollison. She returned to musicals in 1942, playing Violet Gray in a revival of &quot;The Belle of New York&quot; at the London Coliseum. She appeared in pantomime as Prince Charming in &quot;Cinderella&quot; at His Majesty&#x27;s and the Palladium. and in March 1945 she played Katherine in Straus&#x27;s &quot;Three Waltzes&quot; at the Prince&#x27;s and later on tour.
After the war Laye&#x27;s musical career suffered from a change in theatrical fashion. The romantic mid-European musicals with which she was associated were superseded on Broadway and in the West End by a new type of mainly American musicals. She began to appear in non-musical plays, touring with her husband in a new comedy, &quot;Elusive Lady&quot; (1946) and playing Lady Teazle in Basil Dean&#x27;s production of &quot;The School for Scandal&quot;. Her first non-musical role in the West End was Marina in &quot;Two Dozen Red Roses&quot;, an Italian comedy adapted by Kenneth Horne, at the Lyric Theatre in May 1949. Laye and the other performers received good notices, but the play was thought weak: &quot;The Stage&quot; commented that Laye looked ravishing and carried off her role with a flourish, but &quot;we simply longed for her to break into song&quot;. The production closed after a month. She then took over from Gertrude Lawrence in Daphne du Maurier&#x27;s drama &quot;September Tide&quot;, playing alongside Lawton. In 1951 Laye and Lawton toured Australia in &quot;September Tide&quot; and John Van Druten&#x27;s comedy &quot;Bell, Book and Candle&quot;. 

Back in England, Laye was passed over for the leading role in the British premiere of &quot;The King and I&quot; in 1953, but made a successful return to the musical stage the following year as Marcelle Thibault in &quot;Wedding in Paris&quot; by Hans May and Vera Caspary, co-starring Anton Walbrook. Later in the decade she starred with Lawton in &quot;Silver Wedding&quot;, a non-musical comedy written for them by Michael Clayton Hutton. She published a volume of memoirs, &quot;Boo To My Friends&quot;, in 1958. She and Lawton appeared together in a revival of Coward&#x27;s &quot;The Marquise&quot;, which toured in 1959. At the Saville in London she played Lady Fitzadam in the comedy &quot;The Amorous Prawn&quot;, which ran for more than two years from December 1959.

===1960s and 1970s===
At the Prince of Wales Theatre in January 1964 Laye took over the role of Edith Lambert in Sumner Arthur Long&#x27;s comedy &quot;Never Too Late&quot;, and in 1965 she and Lawton appeared in Somerset Maugham&#x27;s 1921 comedy &quot;The Circle&quot;, first at the Ashcroft Theatre, and then at the Savoy. &quot;The Stage&quot; said that the play had worn well but:

In 1966, first at the Alhambra Theatre, Glasgow and then at the Piccadilly, Laye returned to musicals, playing Annie Besant in &quot;Strike a Light&quot;. At the Phoenix, in October 1967 she played Muriel Willoughby in a new comedy, &quot;Let&#x27;s All Go Down the Strand&quot;, co-starring with Gladys Cooper. &quot;The Stage&quot; commented, &quot;The light of sparkling entertainment invariably comes when Gladys Cooper and Evelyn Laye indulge in their individual forms of rampage&quot;. 

At the Adelphi Theatre in March 1969, Laye took over the part of Lady Hadwell in the musical &quot;Charlie Girl&quot; from Anna Neagle, and at the Palace in November of that year she played Mrs Fitzmaunce in David Heneker&#x27;s musical &quot;Phil the Fluter&quot;, in which she sang &quot;They Don&#x27;t Make them Like that any More&quot;, written by the composer as a tribute to her longevity on stage.

In 1971 Laye starred opposite the young Michael Crawford in a farce, &quot;No Sex Please, We&#x27;re British&quot;, in which she played his mother, Eleanor Hunter. She remained in the cast after Crawford left; after giving nearly 800 performances in the role she left the run in March 1973. She was appointed CBE in 1973. In 1975 she appeared in a revival of Dodie Smith&#x27;s comedy, &quot;Dear Octopus&quot; in the matriarchal role created in 1938 by Marie Tempest. In 1978 she embarked on a 16-week British tour as Mrs Higgins in &quot;Pygmalion&quot;, with Paul Daneman as Higgins and Jennifer Wilson as Eliza, before touring as Mme Armfeld in Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;A Little Night Music&quot;.

===Later years===
In her later years Laye appeared frequently on radio and television. In 1960 she introduced a weekly series, &quot;On Stage, Everybody&quot; on the BBC Light Programme; over the next 30 years she appeared in numerous documentaries about her contemporaries and in 1990 she played Cora in Coward&#x27;s &quot;Waiting in the Wings&quot;. Her other broadcasts included character roles in productions ranging from &quot;Tales of the Unexpected&quot; (1983) and &quot;Home is the Sailor&quot; (1985) for ITV, and for the BBC she played the Countess of Owbridge in &quot;The Gay Lord Quex&quot; (1983) and Mrs Kralefsky in Gerald Durrell&#x27;s &quot;My Family and Other Animals&quot; (1987).

In April 1991, aged ninety, Laye returned to New York to appear at Carnegie Hall, as part of the hall&#x27;s centenary celebrations, in a concert of music by Coward at which she sang, 60 years after she had first introduced it to Broadway, &quot;I&#x27;ll See You Again&quot; from &quot;Bitter-Sweet&quot;. In 1992 she undertook a seven-week tour with the anthology &quot;Glamorous Nights at Drury Lane&quot;, which Morley records played to packed houses throughout Britain, and featured some of her most famous renderings. Morley adds that by then she was Britain&#x27;s oldest working star. Her last appearance on stage was in that show at the Players Theatre, London on 28 October 1992.

Laye died of heart failure at a nursing home in Westminster, on 17 February 1996. After a private cremation a memorial service was held at St Paul&#x27;s, Covent Garden on 2 July 1996.

<text>Admiral Jorge Isaac Anaya (27 September 1926 – 9 January 2008) was an Argentine admiral and Commander-in-Chief of the Argentine Navy. He was born in Bahía Blanca, in the province of Buenos Aires. He participated in the right-wing military dictatorship known as the National Reorganisation Process (1976–1983) and, along with Leopoldo Fortunato Galtieri and Basilio Lami Dozo, was a member of the Third Military &quot;Junta&quot; that ruled Argentina between 1981 and 1982. He was the main architect and supporter of a military solution for the long-standing claim over the Falkland Islands that led to the Falklands War ().

==Career==
In 1955, Ship-of-the-Line Lieutenant Anaya participated in the coup against president Juan Domingo Perón. He was known to torture dissidents and new conscripts, and was recruited by the CIA for a covert anti-Communist programme in 1962.

He later served as Argentina&#x27;s naval attaché in London, United Kingdom between 1964 and 1967. He commanded an anti-submarine Frigate between 1967 and 1970, a Destroyer Escort squadron between 1970 and 1972, and a guided missile frigate squadron between 1972 and 1974. Between 1974 and 1976, he was the chief of the Naval Police and Naval Intelligence.

In 1976, during the first part of the new military regime, Anaya was Chief of Naval Operations.

In December 1981, there was a change in the dictatorship bringing to office a new junta headed by General Leopoldo Galtieri. Anaya then, as commander-in-chief of the navy, ordered Vice-Admiral Juan Lombardo to create a plan to seize the Falkland Islands which both presented to the new acting president.

During the 1982 war, he devised and commanded Operation Algeciras, in which Argentine commandos were to sabotage a Royal Navy warship harboured in Gibraltar; the plan was thwarted at the last minute when communications were intercepted.

In the 1985 Trial of the Juntas, he was acquitted of charges of kidnapping, torture, enslavement, concealing the truth, usurpation of power, and false declarations.

In 1997, the Spanish judge Baltasar Garzón requested the arrest and extradition of 45 members of the Argentine military, and one civilian, for crimes of genocide, state terrorism, and torture committed during the &quot;Dirty War&quot; period of the &quot;de facto&quot; regime, including Anaya. The request was denied on several occasions by the democratically elected Argentine government, which argued that it was inadmissible on grounds of inapplicable jurisdiction.

On 27 July 2003, by means of Decree 420/03, President Néstor Kirchner amended the criteria under which the extraditions had been refused, ordering that the legal proceedings requested by the Spanish courts go ahead and thus enabling the extraditions to proceed.

In August 2003, Spanish Prime Minister José María Aznar ordered the cessation of the extradition proceedings for crimes committed in Argentina under the &quot;de facto&quot; regime. 
That decision was later overturned by the Supreme Court in 2005, which ordered that Garzón&#x27;s requested extraditions continue. In November 2006, while waiting to be interrogated by an examining magistrate, Anaya suffered a heart attack and was rushed to the naval hospital; he remained under house arrest after his discharge from hospital, but was never deemed fit enough to stand trial.

He died on 9 January 2008 while under house arrest on charges of human rights violations.

<doc id="1015863" wikidata="Q643736" url="?curid=1015863" title="Contingent valuation">
<text>Contingent valuation is a survey-based economic technique for the valuation of non-market resources, such as environmental preservation or the impact of externalities like pollution. While these resources do give people utility, certain aspects of them do not have a market price as they are not directly sold – for example, people receive benefit from a beautiful view of a mountain, but it would be tough to value using price-based models. Contingent valuation surveys are one technique which is used to measure these aspects. Contingent valuation is often referred to as a &quot;stated preference&quot; model, in contrast to a price-based &quot;revealed preference&quot; model. Both models are utility-based. Typically the survey asks how much money people would be willing to pay (or willing to accept) to maintain the existence of (or be compensated for the loss of) an environmental feature, such as biodiversity.

==History==
Contingent valuation surveys were first proposed in theory by S.V. Ciriacy-Wantrup (1947) as a method for eliciting market valuation of a non-market good. The first practical application of the technique was in 1963 when Robert K. Davis used surveys to estimate the value hunters and tourists placed on a particular wilderness area. He compared the survey results to an estimation of value based on travel costs and found good correlation with his results. This work was published as his Ph.D. Dissertation at Harvard &quot;The Value of Outdoor Recreation: An Economic Study of the Maine Woods.&quot; See also: This work, and other early applications of the method are described in Chapter 1 of &quot;Using Surveys to Value Public Goods&quot; by Robert Cameron Mitchell, and Richard T. Carson.

The method rose to high prominence in the USA in the 1980s when government agencies were given the power to sue for damage to environmental resources which they were trustees over. Following &quot;Ohio v Department of the Interior&quot;, the types of damages which they were able to recover included non-use or existence values. Existence values are unable to be assessed through market pricing mechanisms, so contingent valuation surveys were suggested to assess them. During this time, the EPA convened an important conference with an aim to recommend guidelines for survey design. The Exxon Valdez oil spill in Prince William Sound was the first case where contingent valuation surveys were used in a quantitative assessment of damages. Use of the technique has spread from there.

==Past controversies==
Many economists question the use of stated preference to determine willingness to pay for a good, preferring to rely on people&#x27;s revealed preferences in binding market transactions. Early contingent valuation surveys were often open-ended questions of the form &quot;how much compensation would you demand for the destruction of X area&quot; or &quot;how much would you pay to preserve X&quot;. Such surveys potentially suffer from a number of shortcomings; strategic behaviour, protest answers, response bias and respondents ignoring income constraints. Early surveys used in environmental valuation seemed to indicate people were expressing a general preference for environmental spending in their answers, described as the embedding effect by detractors of the method.

In response to criticisms of contingent valuation surveys, a panel of high profile economists (chaired by Nobel Prize laureates Kenneth Arrow and Robert Solow) was convened under the auspices of the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The panel heard evidence from 22 expert economists and published its results in 1993. The recommendations of the NOAA panel were that contingent valuation surveys should be carefully designed and controlled due to the inherent difficulties in eliciting accurate economic values through survey methods.

The most important recommendations of the NOAA panel were that:
*Personal interviews be used to conduct the survey, as opposed to telephone or mall-stop methods.
*Surveys be designed in a yes or no referendum format put to the respondent as a vote on a specific tax to protect a specified resource.
*Respondents be given detailed information on the resource in question and on the protection measure they were voting on. This information should include threats to the resource (best and worst-case scenarios), scientific evaluation of its ecological importance and possible outcomes of protection measures.
*Income effects be carefully explained to ensure respondents understood that they were to express their willingness to pay to protect the particular resource in question, not the environment generally.
*Subsidiary questions be asked to ensure respondents understood the question posed.
*&quot;[CVM] produces estimates reliable enough to be the starting point of a judicial process of damage assessment, including passive-use values&quot; and has been successfully used in such high profile cases as the Exxon Valdez oil spill.

The guiding principle behind these recommendations was that the survey operator has a high burden of proof to satisfy before the results can be seen as meaningful. Surveys meeting these criteria are very expensive to operate and to ameliorate the expense of conducting surveys the panel recommended a set of reference surveys which future surveys could be compared to and calibrated against. The NOAA panel also felt, in general, that conservative estimates of value were to be preferred and one important consequence of this decision is that they recommended contingent valuation surveys measure willingness to pay to protect the good rather than willingness to accept compensation for the loss of the resource.

As a result, current contingent valuation methodology corrects for these shortcomings, and current empirical testing indicates that such bias and inconsistency has been successfully addressed.

==Current status==

As shown by Mundy and McLean (1998), contingent valuation is now widely accepted as a real estate appraisal technique, particularly in contaminated property or other situations where revealed preference models (i.e. transaction pricing) fail due to disequilibrium in the market. McLean, Mundy, and Kilpatrick (1999) demonstrate the acceptability of contingent valuation in real estate expert testimony, and the current standards for use of contingent valuation in litigation situations is described by Diamond (2000).

The technique has been widely used by government departments in the US when performing cost-benefit analysis of projects impacting, positively or negatively, on the environment. Examples include a valuation of water quality and recreational opportunities in the river downstream from Glen Canyon dam, biodiversity restoration in the Mono Lake and restoration of salmon spawning grounds in certain rivers. The technique has also been used in Australia to value areas of the Kakadu National Park as well as trophy property in the United States, and is recognized as a valuable tool in the appraisal of brownfields.
