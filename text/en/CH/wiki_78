==Acting career==
Alexander was discovered at 14 by independent film company Merchant Ivory when she was attending the fifth week of a six-week summer acting class at the New Freedom Theatre. Her first major film role was that of Joan in 1986&#x27;s &quot;My Little Girl&quot;. In 1989, she played Madri/Hidimbaa in Peter Brook&#x27;s nine-hour epic play adaptation of &quot;The Mahabharata&quot;.

<doc id="1034370" wikidata="Q150744" url="?curid=1034370" title="Dodecane">
<text>Dodecane (also known as dihexyl, bihexyl, adakane 12, or duodecane) is an oily liquid &quot;n&quot;-alkane hydrocarbon with the chemical formula C12H26 (which has 355 isomers).

It is used as a solvent, distillation chaser, and scintillator component. It is used as a diluent for tributyl phosphate (TBP) in nuclear reprocessing plants.

==Combustion reaction==
The combustion reaction of dodecane is as follows:

:C12H26(&quot;l&quot;) + 18.5 O2(&quot;g&quot;) → 12 CO2(&quot;g&quot;) + 13 H2O(&quot;g&quot;)

:Δ&quot;H&quot;° = −7513 kJ

One litre of fuel needs about 15 kg of air to burn (2.6 kg of oxygen), and generates 2.3 kg (or 1.2 m3) of CO2 upon complete combustion.

==Jet fuel surrogate==
In recent years, &quot;n&quot;-dodecane has garnered attention as a possible surrogate for kerosene-based fuels such as Jet-A, S-8, and other conventional aviation fuels. It is considered a second-generation fuel surrogate designed to emulate the laminar flame speed, largely supplanting &quot;n&quot;-decane, primarily due to its higher molecular mass and lower hydrogen-to-carbon ratio which better reflect the &quot;n&quot;-alkane content of jet fuels.

<doc id="1034371" wikidata="Q1551207" url="?curid=1034371" title="Sound server">
<text>A sound server is software that manages the use of and access to audio devices (usually a sound card). It commonly runs as a background process.

== Sound server in an operating system==

In a Unix-like operating system, a sound server mixes different data streams (usually raw PCM audio) and sends out a single unified audio to an output device. The mixing is usually done by software, or by hardware if there is a supported sound card.

===Layers===

The &quot;sound stack&quot; can be visualized as follows, with programs in the upper layers calling elements in the lower layers:

* Applications (e.g. mp3 player, web video)
* Sound server (e.g. aRts, ESD, JACK, PulseAudio)
* Sound subsystem (described as kernel modules or drivers; e.g. OSS, ALSA)
* Operating system kernel (e.g. Linux, Unix)

=== Motivation ===

Sound servers appeared in Unix-like operating systems after limitations in Open Sound System were recognized. OSS is a basic sound interface that was incapable of playing multiple streams simultaneously, dealing with multiple sound cards, or streaming sound over the network. 

A sound server can provide these features by running as a daemon. It receives calls from different programs and sound flows, mixes the streams, and sends raw audio out to the audio device.

With a sound server, users can also configure global and per-application sound preferences.

=== Diversification and problems ===

 there are multiple sound servers; some focus on providing very low latency, while others concentrate on features suitable for general desktop systems. While diversification allows a user to choose just the features that are important to a particular application, it also forces developers to accommodate these options by necessitating code that is compatible with the various sound servers available. Consequently, this variety has resulted in a desire for a standard API to unify efforts.

<doc id="1034372" wikidata="Q7157621" url="?curid=1034372" title="Peach Belt Conference">
<text>The Peach Belt Conference (PBC) is a college athletic conference affiliated with the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) at the Division II level. The 10 member institutions are located in the South Atlantic states of South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. In addition, seven affiliate members participate in one sport each; namely sports not sponsored by their home conferences.

Since its inception came in the 1990–91 school year, the Peach Belt has, across all sanctioned sports, produced 30 national champions and an additional 27 national finalists. Starting with only two championships in 1991, in men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, the conference has expanded to 18 championship sports with the addition of men&#x27;s lacrosse in the summer of 2020 and men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s indoor track and field in 2023.

==History==
The conference traces its roots November 1988 when 11 schools first met in Greenville, S.C. to form a Division II conference. Following a second meeting on Dec. 3, 1989, five of those 11 schools, plus two others, formed the Peach Belt Athletic Conference and began play in the fall of 1990.

The seven charter members of the conference were Armstrong Atlantic State University (later Armstrong State University), Columbus State University, Francis Marion University, Georgia College (now Georgia College &amp; State University), Lander University, USC Aiken, and USC Upstate. The name Peach Belt Athletic Conference was adopted in January 1990 and modified to Peach Belt Conference in May 2000.

Augusta State University joined the conference as the eighth member in 1991 and UNC Pembroke became the ninth member on July 1, 1992. They were followed by Kennesaw State University on July 1, 1994, Clayton State University on July 1, 1995 and the University of North Florida on July 1, 1997. Kennesaw State and North Florida departed for the Division I ranks in 2005, USC Upstate did the same in 2007, and the conference welcomed in North Georgia College &amp; State University in 2005 and Georgia Southwestern State University in 2006. In 2009–10, the University of Montevallo and Flagler College were added, returning a league presence to Florida and breaking new ground in Alabama. In 2012–13, the Peach Belt expanded to 14 members, the most the league has ever had, with the addition of Young Harris College. On January 8, 2013, the University System of Georgia finalized the mergers of two conference members into new institutions. Augusta State was merged into Georgia Regents University, which was renamed in 2015 as Augusta University, and NGCSU was merged into the University of North Georgia. In both cases, the new institutions inherited the Peach Belt memberships of the older schools.

The Peach Belt was less than a year old before capturing its first of many national championships. The Columbus State men&#x27;s golf team took the honor by winning the 1992 national crown, the first of three golf championships the Cougars own. One year later, the Lander men&#x27;s tennis team began their record-breaking run of eight straight national titles, the first PBC dynasty. Since then, USCA men&#x27;s golf won three straight national titles from 2004 to 2006 while AASU women&#x27;s tennis captured four titles overall.

The 2010–11 season was one of the most memorable the league has ever had. Clayton State became the first PBC women&#x27;s basketball team to capture a national championship. Montevallo watched their men&#x27;s basketball team reach the Elite Eight, eventually competing in the National Championship Game. Unfortunately, their run came to an end with a loss to Western Washington University. The Columbus State men&#x27;s tennis team reached the national semifinals while the Clayton State and Armstrong Atlantic State women&#x27;s tennis teams also played in the national semifinals. The North Georgia softball team made an unprecedented third straight appearance in the NCAA Women&#x27;s College World Series, while Columbus State&#x27;s Meshack Koyiaki registered a runner-up finish at the Men&#x27;s Cross Country National Championships. In all, 46 Peach Belt teams made appearances in the NCAA postseason, including seven men&#x27;s tennis teams and six each in the sports of men&#x27;s golf and women&#x27;s tennis.

David Brunk was named the second PBC commissioner in May 2007, replacing Marvin Vanover, who was the first PBC commissioner from 1991 to 2007. Brunk is charged with continuing the strong growth of the conference as its second era begins.

Dr. Kendall Blanchard, president of Georgia Southwestern State University, began the second of his two-year term as the league president in July 2011.

In April 2020, Francis Marion University and the University of North Carolina at Pembroke announced that they would leave the Peach Belt Conference starting in 2021–22, both joining Conference Carolinas.

On April 14, 2021, the conference invited the NAIA&#x27;s University of South Carolina Beaufort to join in 2022–23 after applying for membership in Division II and gaining acceptance into the NCAA. By July 14, 2022, USCB was accepted into the NAIA&#x27;s Continental Athletic Conference for its first year of provisional membership while still playing a Peach Belt schedule as part of the Sand Sharks&#x27; dual NAIA-NCAA membership. USCB is ineligible for a Peach Belt or NCAA postseason during the three-year transition.

The conference currently holds championships in 16 sports, eight for men and eight for women. The championship sports are men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s cross country, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer, women&#x27;s volleyball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s tennis, baseball, softball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s track &amp; field, and men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s golf. Men&#x27;s lacrosse was added on July 10, 2020, with its first season was in spring 2021, and men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s indoor track and field was added on August 11, 2023.

On December 13, 2023, the Sunshine State Conference, primary home of PBC track affiliates Embry–Riddle Aeronautical University and Nova Southeastern University, announced it would start sponsoring men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s outdoor track &amp; field in the 2025 spring season (2024–25 school year), and accordingly, both schools moved their respective programs to the SSC. Embry–Riddle will remain a PBC affiliate in men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s indoor track.

On January 10, 2024, Middle Georgia State University announced that it got extended an invitation by the PBC and will join the conference, beginning the 2025–26 academic year.

<text>Ian Charleson (11 August 1949 – 6 January 1990) was a Scottish stage and film actor. He is best known internationally for his starring role as Olympic athlete and missionary Eric Liddell in the Oscar-winning 1981 film &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot;. He is also well known for his portrayal of Rev. Charlie Andrews in the 1982 Oscar-winning film &quot;Gandhi&quot;.

Charleson was a noted actor on the British stage as well, with critically acclaimed leads in &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;, &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot;, &quot;Fool for Love&quot;, and &quot;Hamlet&quot;, among many others. He performed numerous Shakespearean roles, and in 1991 the annual Ian Charleson Awards were established, particularly in honour of his final Hamlet. The awards reward the best classical stage performances in Britain by actors aged under 30.

The &quot;Houghton Mifflin Dictionary of Biography&quot; describes Charleson as &quot;a leading player of charm and power&quot; and &quot;one of the finest British actors of his generation&quot;. Alan Bates wrote that Charleson was &quot;definitely among the top ten actors of his age group&quot;. Ian McKellen said Charleson was &quot;the most unmannered and unactorish of actors: always truthful, always honest&quot;.

Charleson was diagnosed with HIV in 1986, and died in 1990 at the age of 40. He requested that it be announced after his death that he had died of AIDS, to publicise the condition. This was the first celebrity death in the United Kingdom openly attributed to AIDS, and the announcement helped to promote awareness and acceptance of the disease.

==Early life==

Born in Edinburgh in 1949, Charleson was the son of a printer, and grew up in a working-class area of the city. A bright, musical, artistic child, by the age of eight he was performing in local theatre productions. He won a scholarship to and attended Edinburgh&#x27;s Royal High School; and in his teens, he joined and performed with The Jasons, an Edinburgh amateur theatrical group. He also sang solo as a boy soprano in church and in the Royal High School choir, which performed on the radio and in Edinburgh Festival concerts.

Charleson won a scholarship to the University of Edinburgh, which he attended from 1967 to 1970, obtaining a three-year Scottish MA Ordinary degree. Initially he studied architecture. However, he spent most of his time acting with the student-run Edinburgh University Drama Society, and decided to pursue acting as a career. He changed his study concentration accordingly, and graduated with a degree in English, fine art, and mathematics. In addition to his acting roles at Edinburgh University, he also directed many plays there, and he designed costumes for several as well.

From 1967 through 1973, Charleson also performed often at the Edinburgh Festival and Edinburgh Festival Fringe, becoming a noted actor in those circles.

==Stage career==

===LAMDA, Young Vic, and Cambridge Theatre Company===
After graduating in 1970 from the University of Edinburgh – where he played leads in numerous productions, including several Shakespeare plays – Charleson won a place in the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (LAMDA), where he studied for two years.

From LAMDA, Charleson was hired by Frank Dunlop&#x27;s Young Vic Theatre Company. He made his professional stage debut in 1972 with the Young Vic, as one of the brothers in &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&quot; (1972), which was also televised in the UK that same year by Granada Television. In 1973, he starred as Jimmy Porter in &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot;, and that year he was also Hamlet and later Guildenstern in the first revival of Tom Stoppard&#x27;s &quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead&quot;. Also as part of the Young Vic company, he was Claudio in &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; in 1974. He traveled with the company to the Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York that same year, to appear as Lucentio in &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;, Ottavio in &quot;Scapino&quot;, and Brian Curtis in &quot;French Without Tears&quot;.

In late 1974, he played the title role in &quot;Hamlet&quot; with the Cambridge Theatre Company, where he had previously performed that year in &quot;The School for Scandal&quot; and &quot;Six Characters in Search of an Author&quot;, and the production went on tour into 1975. His performance of Hamlet garnered good reviews; nevertheless Charleson felt he had not done the notoriously difficult role complete justice.

===West End and National Theatre debuts, Royal Shakespeare Company===
Charleson made his West End debut in 1975, in a long-running production of Simon Gray&#x27;s &quot;Otherwise Engaged&quot; at the Queen&#x27;s Theatre. In it he played Dave, a surly Scottish lodger, opposite Alan Bates.

He next appeared at the National Theatre, where he performed Octavius in &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; in 1977. That year he also played Peregrine in the Ben Jonson play &quot;Volpone&quot;, opposite John Gielgud, and Captain Phoebus in &quot;The Hunchback of Notre-Dame&quot;.

Charleson then spent a year in Stratford-upon-Avon with the Royal Shakespeare Company 1978–79. There he performed a hauntingly voiced Ariel in &quot;The Tempest&quot;; Tranio in &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;; and Longaville in &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot; opposite Richard Griffiths as the King – all both in Stratford and at the Aldwych Theatre in London. Also with the RSC, he was Lawrence Vail in an acclaimed production of &quot;Once in a Lifetime&quot; (1979) at the Aldwych Theatre, and he played Pierre in the Jane Lapotaire vehicle &quot;Piaf&quot;, giving a performance which caught the eye of the filmmakers of &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot;.

===National Theatre spotlight===

In the 1980s, Charleson won particular critical and popular acclaim for his starring roles at the National Theatre. He was a glowingly reviewed Sky Masterson in Richard Eyre&#x27;s enormously successful revival of the musical &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; (1982), opposite Julie Covington as Sister Sarah, with Bob Hoskins as Nathan Detroit and Julia McKenzie as Adelaide.

Charleson received an Olivier Award nomination for Actor of the Year in a New Play as Eddie in Sam Shepard&#x27;s gritty and very physical two-person drama, &quot;Fool for Love&quot; (1984–85), opposite Julie Walters as his on-again off-again love object. And he was a highly praised Brick, the repressed homosexual protagonist in Tennessee Williams&#x27; &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot; (1988), opposite Lindsay Duncan.

===Final Hamlet===
Shortly before his death, while seriously ill from AIDS, from 9 October to 13 November 1989 Charleson performed his second run of &quot;Hamlet&quot;, this time at the National Theatre – giving a definitive performance which garnered major accolades. Director Richard Eyre, with some initial misgivings based on Charleson&#x27;s health, had brought him in to replace Daniel Day-Lewis, who had abandoned the production. A further challenge was that Charleson&#x27;s face was greatly swollen from septicaemia; audience members and the rest of the public were told that he was recovering from a sinus operation.

In a lengthy review praising Charleson&#x27;s performance, John Peter wrote in the &quot;Sunday Times&quot;:

The day following Charleson&#x27;s final &quot;Hamlet&quot; performance, when Ian McKellen was given the Evening Standard Award for Best Actor for his Iago in &quot;Othello&quot;, McKellen offered thanks, but said having seen &quot;the perfect Hamlet&quot; at the National Theatre the previous night, he thought that not he but Charleson was truly the Best Actor of 1989, and he gave Charleson his statuette.

==Film and television==

===&quot;Chariots of Fire&quot; and &quot;Gandhi&quot;===

In 1979, producer David Puttnam and director Hugh Hudson had done months of searching for the actor to play the lead of the evangelical Scot Eric Liddell in their upcoming film about the 1924 Olympics. They then saw Charleson performing the role of Pierre in &quot;Piaf&quot;, and knew immediately they had found their man. Unbeknownst to them, the actor had heard about the film from his father, and desperately wanted to play the part, feeling it would &quot;fit like a kid glove&quot;. This mutual affinity led to Charleson&#x27;s best-known film role and success – as the athlete and missionary Eric Liddell in &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot; (1981). He prepared for the role by studying the Bible intensively, and he himself wrote Liddell&#x27;s stirring post-race address to the workingmen&#x27;s crowd. This film and role made him an international celebrity.

Charleson had a similar success the following year, playing Mahatma Gandhi&#x27;s closest friend and collaborator, the Anglican priest Charlie Andrews, in &quot;Gandhi&quot; (1982), opposite Ben Kingsley. Like &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot;, the film &quot;Gandhi&quot; won numerous Academy Awards, including Best Picture.

===Other film work===
After these two major successes in these two Best Picture Oscar–winning films, Charleson&#x27;s film career did not, however, follow the same progressive arc that his stage career did. Good feature Hollywood scripts did not pour in after &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot; and &quot;Gandhi&quot;; nor did he choose to move to Hollywood to capitalize on his success. Also affecting his film career was the fact that he was diagnosed with HIV in 1986, and thereafter lacked enthusiasm to do feature films, although he was not symptomatic until the autumn of 1988. His drive to pursue a rich stage career focusing on Shakespearean leads, however, remained strong.

Charleson&#x27;s other feature film roles are: punk-era Angel in his film debut &quot;Jubilee&quot; (1977) directed by Derek Jarman; Lt. Ryder in the Golden Bear-winning &quot;Irish question&quot; film &quot;Ascendancy&quot; (1982), which starred Julie Covington; a small role as the abusive drunk Jeffson Brown in &quot;&quot; (1984); a comedic turn as Gerald Spong in the rather ill-fated &quot;Car Trouble&quot; (1985), opposite his friend Julie Walters; and opera director Marco in Dario Argento&#x27;s horror film &quot;Opera&quot; (1987).

===Television: Shakespeare, TV films, and teleplays===
Charleson performed in three BBC Television Shakespeare films: as Fortinbras in &quot;Hamlet&quot; (1980) starring Derek Jacobi; the protagonist Bertram in the acclaimed production of &quot;All&#x27;s Well That Ends Well&quot; (1981); and Octavius Caesar in &quot;Antony &amp; Cleopatra&quot; (1981) opposite his frequent co-star Jane Lapotaire as Cleopatra.

His other notable made-for-television film roles include: the titular Lieutenant Dorfrichter in the film adaptation of M. Fagyas&#x27;s Austro-Hungarian pre-war mystery &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Lieutenant&quot; (1983); Rakitin in Turgenev&#x27;s &quot;A Month in the Country&quot; (1985) opposite Eleanor Bron; Kyril in the spy thriller &quot;&quot; (1988) opposite Edward Woodward, Richard E. Grant, and Peter Vaughan; and the protagonist Major Brendan Archer in the faithful screen adaptation of J. G. Farrell&#x27;s Booker Award-winning &quot;Troubles&quot; (1988), opposite Ian Richardson.

Charleson&#x27;s notable starring television roles in the 1970s include: Anthony in &quot;A Private Matter&quot; (1974), his first starring screen role, opposite Rachel Kempson; slick and cruel John Ross preying on Scottish immigrants to the New World in &quot;O Canada&quot; (1975) in the anthology series &quot;Churchill&#x27;s People&quot;; and one of two British soldiers who find military life nearly unbearable in &quot;The Paradise Run&quot; (1976), directed by Michael Apted.

In the 1980s his notable starring TV roles included: Alexander the Great&#x27;s close companion Hephaistion in the PBS miniseries &quot;The Search for Alexander the Great&quot;; serial killer Neville Heath in an episode of the murder-trial reenactment series &quot;Ladykillers&quot; (1981); naive Scot turned powerful South African magnate Jamie MacGregor in the miniseries &quot;Master of the Game&quot; (1984); romantic lead Clarence Dandridge in the period miniseries &quot;Louisiana&quot; (1984) opposite Margot Kidder; and protagonist Victor Geary in the stylish and clever &quot;Oxbridge Blues&quot; (1984), written by Frederic Raphael, directed by James Cellan Jones, and co-starring Amanda Redman, Rosalyn Landor, and Malcolm Stoddard.

==Singing work==
Charleson used his tenor singing voice in musicals and other performances. He did notable solo singing work in productions including &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; (1974), an episode of &quot;Rock Follies of &#x27;77&quot; (1977)&quot;, The Tempest&quot; (1978–1979), &quot;Piaf&quot; (1978–1980), &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; (1982), &quot;A Royal Night of One Hundred Stars&quot; (1985), &quot;After Aida&quot; (1985–1986), Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s and Tim Rice&#x27;s &quot;Cricket&quot; (1986), &quot;Sondheim: A Celebration&quot; (1988 benefit for Crusaid), and &quot;Bent&quot; (1989). He also sang classic standards and show tunes, and the songs of Robert Burns, in variety programmes on stage and television.

Three commercial recordings have been issued that include Charleson&#x27;s singing:
* The National Theatre cast album of &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; (1982)
* Charleson singing &quot;Ariel&#x27;s Songs&quot; from &quot;The Tempest&quot;, issued by the Royal Shakespeare Company; music by Guy Woolfenden
* The Original London Cast Album of &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&quot; (ensemble only)

He also sings a solo ballad on an episode (&quot;The Empire&quot;) of the television series &quot;Rock Follies of &#x27;77&quot;.

==Death==
Charleson, who was gay, was diagnosed with HIV in 1986 during the AIDS pandemic, and died of AIDS-related causes in January 1990 at the age of 40. He died eight weeks after performing the title role in a run of &quot;Hamlet&quot;, in Richard Eyre&#x27;s production at the Olivier Theatre. Fellow actor and friend Ian McKellen said that Charleson played Hamlet so well it was as if he had rehearsed the role all his life.

Charleson requested that it be announced after his death that he had died of AIDS, to publicise the condition. This unusual decision by a major internationally known actor, the first show-business death in the United Kingdom openly attributed to complications from AIDS, helped promote awareness of HIV and AIDS and acceptance of AIDS patients.

==Honours and commemoration==
For his performance in &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot;, Charleson won a Variety Club Showbiz Award for Most Promising Artiste in February 1982.

He was nominated for the Olivier Award for Actor of the Year in a New Play, for his starring role as Eddie in &quot;Fool for Love&quot; in 1984.

In &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, John Peter named Charleson the Best Male Actor of 1989 for his Hamlet, along with Ian McKellen for his Iago in &quot;Othello&quot;.

In his honour, the annual Ian Charleson Awards were established in 1991, to reward the best classical stage performances in Britain by actors aged under 30.

The Royal Free Hospital&#x27;s Ian Charleson Day Centre for people with HIV, in London, is named in his memory.

On 8 April 1990, three months after his Edinburgh funeral, a public memorial service was held for Charleson in London. A recording of his singing of &quot;Come Unto These Yellow Sands&quot; from &quot;The Tempest&quot; was played.

In 1990, following his death, 20 of Charleson&#x27;s friends, colleagues, and family members, including Ian McKellen, Alan Bates, Hugh Hudson, Richard Eyre, Sean Mathias, Hilton McRae, Ruby Wax, and David Rintoul, contributed to a book of reminiscences about him, called &quot;For Ian Charleson: A Tribute&quot;, published in October 1990. All royalties from the sale of the book went to the Ian Charleson Trust, a charitable foundation which operated from 1990 to 2007.

Two emotional reunion performances of &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;, with almost all of the original 1982 cast and musicians, were given at the National Theatre in November 1990 as a tribute to Charleson. The tickets sold out immediately, and the dress rehearsal was also packed. The proceeds from the performances were donated to the new HIV clinic at the Royal Free Hospital, and to scholarships in Charleson&#x27;s name at LAMDA.

Hugh Hudson, who had directed him in &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot;, dedicated his 1999 film &quot;My Life So Far&quot; &quot;In loving memory of Ian Charleson&quot;. The 2005 videos &quot;Wings on Their Heels: The Making of &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot; and &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot;: A Reunion&quot; are both also dedicated to his memory.

<doc id="1034375" wikidata="Q3269911" url="?curid=1034375" title="Stacie Orrico (album)">
<text>Stacie Orrico is the second studio album by American singer Stacie Orrico. It was released by ForeFront Records and Virgin Records on March 25, 2003, in the United States. Initially conceived as a Contemporary Christian music album, much in style of Orrico&#x27;s debut album &quot;Genuine&quot; (2000), the album was titled &quot;Say It Again&quot; and expected to be released in 2002, featuring production by Anthony Dent and Tedd T, among others. Additional recording sessions with mainstream producers Dallas Austin and The Underdogs led to a different musical direction however and resulted in the renaming of the project. Stylistically, the album mixes the singer&#x27;s native Christian music with more pop and R&amp;B styles, but also features incorporation of teen pop and dance music.

&quot;Stacie Orrico&quot; received generally favorable reviews from music critics who praised the songs, but some said that it was mixed with different genres. The album peaked at number fifty-nine on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, while also reaching the top spot on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top Christian Albums, and was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It peaked in the top ten in different countries, including Japan and Norway, and the top twenty in Austria, Germany, New Zealand, and Switzerland. &quot;Stacie Orrico&quot; produced the international top ten hits &quot;Stuck&quot; and &quot;(There&#x27;s Gotta Be) More to Life&quot; and was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Pop/Contemporary Gospel Album, but lost to Michael W. Smith.

==Background==
When Orrico released her debut album, &quot;Genuine&quot; (2000), she released only one mainstream single which was &quot;Everything&quot;. It was later announced that she would record another album with her record label Forefront Records, &quot;Say It Again&quot;, which was originally intended solely for Christian pop radio, with a release date of April 2002. However, when Virgin Records saw mainstream potential with Orrico, the album was postponed and then cancelled while it was retooled. Four tracks from &quot;Say It Again&quot; were removed, although two were later released as single B-sides and Japanese bonus tracks on the album, including &quot;Truth&quot;, &quot;Until I Find You&quot;, &quot;That&#x27;s the Way&quot; and &quot; Star of My Story&quot;. Meanwhile, &quot;Bounce Back&quot;, &quot;Say It Again&quot;″s first single, was completely re-recorded and &quot;Security&quot; and &quot;Maybe I Won&#x27;t Look Back&quot; received major alterations. The songs &quot;Stuck&quot;, &quot;(There&#x27;s Gotta Be) More to Life&quot;, &quot;I Promise&quot;, &quot;I Could Be the One&quot;, &quot;Instead&quot;, and &quot;Strong Enough&quot; were added to the track listing.

== Singles ==
The release of the album was preceded by the single &quot;Bounce Back.&quot; When &quot;Say It Again&quot; was reworked into &quot;Stacie Orrico&quot;, the song was demoted and replaced by Dallas Austin-produced &quot;Stuck&quot; as the album&#x27;s leading single. A worldwide success, &quot;Stuck&quot; reached the top five in Australia, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, and New Zealand and became a top ten success on most other charts it appeared on. In the United States, the song underperformed on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 100, reaching number 52 only, though it peaked inside the top ten of the Mainstream Top 40, while the Thunderpuss Remix topped the US Hot Dance Singles Sales.

Second single &quot;(There&#x27;s Gotta Be) More to Life&quot; became a top ten success in Ireland, New Zealand, and Norway, and reached the top 20 in Australia, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Scotland, and the United Kingdom. It also peaked at number thirty on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, making it Orrico&#x27;s highest-charting single there. Third single &quot;I Promise&quot; did not do as well as her previous singles, but did make the top 20 in Ireland and the top 30 in the United Kingdom. A fourth and final single from the album, &quot;I Could Be the One,&quot; reached number 34 on the UK Singles Chart.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Stacie Orrico&quot; received generally positive reviews from music critics. Steve Losey from Allmusic rated the album three stars out of five. He pointed out about Orrico that &quot;vocally the opus stretches her talents by delving into several tempo and mood changes that the 17-year-old embraces like a seasoned veteran.&quot; He also said that &quot;the astounding thing about the disc is that the grooves drip of dance floor sweat, maturity, and soulfulness while maintaining integrity and purity from America&#x27;s newest diva/role model.&quot; &quot;PopMatters&quot; noted that on her second album, &quot;Orrico knows what she can do – excellent melodic pop – and doesn&#x27;t try to push any boundaries. At this time in her young career, this clear path is a benefit.&quot; While the online magazine felt that a &quot;couple of weaker, moderate-tempo songs prevent &quot;Stacie Orrico&quot; from matching &quot;Genuine&quot;, it declared the album a &quot;well-crafted and focused&quot; project, complimenting it for its &quot;solid melodies and songs.&quot;

&quot;Billboard&quot; remarked that the album had Orrico &quot;making major inroads into mainstream pop&quot; and called it an &quot;adventurous set that perfectly showcases Orrico&#x27;s vocal sass and youthful exuberance.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; critic Kerry L. Smith found that the album had Orrico invoke a &quot;sexy, sophisticated spirit [that] spices up her R&amp;B-heavy; sophomore album with hip-hop, pop and gospel stylings well beyond her years [...] The album&#x27;s shining moments are the ballads &quot;Strong Enough,&quot; which Orrico performs on keyboard and &quot;I Promise.&quot; If Orrico continues to stay true to herself, her career is one promise she&#x27;s sure to make good on.&quot; Bill Lehane from MusicOMH gave &quot;Stacie Orrico&quot; a positive review. He found that &quot;the urban, R&amp;B; sound is certainly there, but this girl is singing about a much more serious mythical force than a genie in a bottle.&quot; He concluded that &quot;this record, Orrico&#x27;s second despite her tender years, is a beautiful album, and it packs a spiritual punch without alienating the average Aguilera fan. At least I hope it won&#x27;t, because this contains some of the best solo female urban material in years. Does it matter that she&#x27;s not singing about sex?&quot;

==Commercial reception==
&quot;Stacie Orrico&quot; enjoyed moderate international success. It scored its chart highest entry in Japan where it reached number three on the Japanese Albums Chart and was later certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ), indicating sales in excess of the 500,000 units. The album also reached the top ten in Norway, peaking at number seven. It was eventually certified gold by the Norwegian International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) for sales of more than 20,000 copies. Elsewhere, &quot;Stacie Orrico&quot; entered the top 20 in Austria, Germany, New Zealand, and Switzerland. The album also peaked at number 43 on the Australian Albums Chart and number 72 on the Dutch Top 40, where it spent 22 weeks on the chart.

In the United Kingdom, the album debuted at number 37 on the UK Albums Chart, but did not pass its peak of 37, and it slipped down and rose several weeks, staying in the charts for 16weeks. It eventually passed sales in excess of 100,000 copies, and was later certified silver and gold by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). In the United States, &quot;Stacie Orrico&quot; peaked at number 59 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for the shipment of over 500,000 copies. It also topped &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top Christian Albums, becoming Orrico&#x27;s first album to do so, and finished eighth on both the chart&#x27;s 2003 and 2004 year-end rankings. By January 2007, the album had sold 498,000 units, according to Nielsen SoundScan.

<text>David Allan Bednar (born June 15, 1952) is a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). A former educator, Bednar was president of Brigham Young University–Idaho (BYU–Idaho) from 1997 to 2004.

Bednar was sustained as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve on October 2, 2004. At 52 years old, he is the youngest man named to that body since Dallin H. Oaks in 1984. He was ordained an apostle on October 7, 2004, by church president Gordon B. Hinckley. Bednar and Dieter F. Uchtdorf were called to fill the vacancies created by the July 2004 deaths of quorum members David B. Haight and Neal A. Maxwell. As a member of the Quorum of the Twelve, Bednar is recognized by the church as a prophet, seer, and revelator. He is currently the sixth most senior apostle in the church.

==Life and career==
Bednar was born in Oakland, California to Lavina Whitney Bednar and Anthony George Bednar. His mother came from a long line of Latter-day Saints, but his father did not join the church until Bednar was in his late twenties. He served as a full-time missionary in Southern Germany and then attended Brigham Young University, where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in communication in 1976 and a Master of Arts degree in organizational communication in 1977. He received a doctorate degree in organizational behavior from Purdue University in 1980.

From 1980 to 1984, Bednar was an assistant professor of management at the University of Arkansas College of Business Administration (now Sam M. Walton College of Business). He was an assistant professor of management at Texas Tech University from 1984 to 1986. He returned to the University of Arkansas in 1987, serving as the Associate Dean for Graduate Studies in the Sam M. Walton College of Business until 1992, and was then the director of the Management Decision-Making Lab from 1992 to 1997. In 1994, he was recognized as the outstanding teacher at the University of Arkansas and received the Burlington Northern Foundation Award for Excellence in Teaching. He was twice the recipient of the Outstanding Teacher Award in the College of Business Administration.

Bednar served as the president of Ricks College/BYU–Idaho in Rexburg, Idaho, from July 1, 1997, to December 1, 2004. There, he oversaw and managed the transition of the school from, what was at the time, the largest private junior college in the United States, Ricks College, to a four-year university, BYU–Idaho.

==LDS Church service==
Bednar has served in the LDS Church as a bishop (Fayetteville Ward, 1987), twice as stake president (Fort Smith Arkansas Stake, 1987–1991 and Rogers Arkansas Stake, 1991–1995), regional representative (1994–95), and area seventy (1997–2004).

In 2016, Bednar dedicated the Star Valley Wyoming Temple, the LDS Church&#x27;s 154th temple. Bednar attended the 2019 dedication of the Rome Italy Temple with all 15 of the LDS Church apostles. This is believed to be the first time the entire First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles were in the same location outside the United States.

Bednar addressed the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., on May 26, 2022.

===Controversy===
In 2016, Bednar attracted media attention when he claimed the church doesn&#x27;t discriminate against gay and lesbian people because &quot;there are no homosexual members of the church.&quot; He stated that being gay or lesbian is not the primary identity of individuals, but rather that each individual is first a child of God.

==Personal life==
Bednar married Susan Kae Robinson in the Salt Lake Temple on March 20, 1975. The Bednars have three sons.

<text>Jed Joseph Johnson, Sr. (July 31, 1888 – May 8, 1963) was an American attorney, politician, and jurist who served as a United States representative from Oklahoma and a judge of the United States Customs Court.

==Early life and education==

Born on July 31, 1888, on a farm near Waxahachie, Ellis County, Texas, Johnson attended the public schools in Texas and Oklahoma and then received a Bachelor of Laws in 1915 from the University of Oklahoma College of Law and participated in postgraduate work at the University of Clermont in Clermont-Ferrand, France.

== Career ==
He was admitted to the bar in 1918 and entered private practice in Walters, Oklahoma. He served in the United States Army as a private from 1918 to 1919 in World War I in Company L of the 36th Division. He returned to private practice in Chickasha, Oklahoma from 1919 to 1927. He was a newspaper editor in Cotton County, Oklahoma from 1920 to 1922.

He was a member of the Oklahoma Senate from 1920 to 1927. He served as a delegate to the annual peace conference of the Interparliamentary Union at Paris, France, in 1927 and 1937, and at Geneva, Switzerland, in 1929, and was Chairman of the Speakers&#x27; Bureau for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.

Johnson was elected as a Democrat to the 70th United States Congress and to the nine succeeding Congresses, serving from March 4, 1927, to January 3, 1947. He was an unsuccessful candidate for renomination in 1946.

===Federal judicial service===

Johnson was nominated to the United States Customs Court by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on March 29, 1945. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on April 3, 1945. However, he declined the appointment.

Johnson was nominated by President Harry S. Truman on April 7, 1947, to a seat on the United States Customs Court vacated by Judge William John Keefe. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on June 23, 1947, and received his commission on June 25, 1947. Johnson was initially appointed as a Judge under Article I, but the court was raised to Article III status by operation of law on July 14, 1956, and Johnson thereafter served as an Article III Judge. His service terminated on May 8, 1963, due to his death.

==Personal life==

Johnson died in a New York City, New York hospital on May 8, 1963. Johnson was buried at Rose Hill Cemetery in Chickasha, Oklahoma. Jed Johnson Lake in the Wichita Mountains National Wildlife Refuge is named in honor of Johnson. His son, Jed Johnson Jr., served one term in Congress.

<text>Charles de La Fosse (; or Lafosse; 15 June 1636 – 13 December 1716) was a French painter born in Paris.

==Life==
He was one of the most noted and least servile pupils of Le Brun, under whose direction he shared in the chief of the great decorative works undertaken in the reign of Louis XIV. 

Leaving France in 1662, he spent two years in Rome and three in Venice. The influence of his prolonged studies of Veronese is evident in his &quot;Finding of Moses&quot; (Louvre), and in his &quot;Rape of Proserpine&quot; (Louvre), which he presented to the Royal Academy as his diploma picture in 1673. He was at once named assistant professor, and in 1674 the full responsibilities of the office devolved on him, but his engagements did not prevent his accepting in 1689 the invitation of Lord Montagu to decorate Montagu House, situated in Bloomsbury.

He visited London twice, remaining on the second occasion—together with Jacques Rousseau and Jean-Baptiste Monnoyer more than two years. William III vainly strove to detain him in England by the proposal that he should decorate Hampton Court, for Le Brun was dead, and Jules Mansart pressed La Fosse to return to Paris to take in hand the cupola of Les Invalides. 

The decorations of Montagu House are destroyed, those of Versailles are restored (though his &quot;The Finding of Moses&quot; for it survives in the Louvre), and the dome of the Invalides (engraved by Picart and Cochin) is now the only work existing which gives a full measure of his talent. During his latter years La Fosse executed many other important decorations in public buildings and private houses, notably in that of Pierre Crozat, under whose roof he died on 13 December 1716. La Fosse was later Director of the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture from 1699 to 1702.

The artist&#x27;s works and conception played a key role in the French art history from shifting the classicism of the French style from the court of Louis XIV towards the lighter and more playful Rococo period&#x27;s style. La Fosse&#x27;s style prior to his emergence from the shadow of Le Brun remains a mystery, with very few sheets by him dating earlier than 1680.

<text>Pierre Crozat (1665–1740) was a French financier, art patron and collector at the center of a broad circle of &quot;cognoscenti&quot;; he was the brother of Antoine Crozat.

==Biography==
The brothers Crozat were born in Toulouse, France, the sons of a wealthy banking family. They moved to Paris around 1700 and rose from obscurity to become two of the wealthiest financiers of France. Pierre was known as &quot;Crozat le pauvre&quot;, to distinguish him from his even-wealthier brother.

Pierre Crozat was one of the most prominent French financiers and collectors, becoming the treasurer to the king in Paris in 1704, when he built the Hôtel de Crozat on the rue de Richelieu and his magnificent country retreat, the Château de Montmorency.

From 1714 until the purchase was finally concluded in 1721, he worked as agent and negotiator for the Regent, Philippe II, Duke of Orléans, on the purchase in Rome of the art collection of Queen Christina of Sweden for the Orleans Collection. His friend, the sculptor Pierre Le Gros the Younger who was living in Rome, acted as a go-between in the negotiations until his death in 1719.

==Patron of the arts==

Charles de La Fosse, who lived in Crozat&#x27;s Parisian hôtel as his guest and died there in 1716, painted the vaulted ceiling there with &quot;La Naissance de Minerve&quot; (&quot;The Birth of Minerva&quot;) and delivered several paintings for Montmorency. As Crozat&#x27;s house guest in 1715–16, Le Gros decorated a cabinet in the hôtel as well as the chapel in Montmorency.
Antoine Watteau, of whom Crozat was the principal patron, painted a cycle of the &quot;Four Seasons&quot; for his Parisian dining room.

==Collector==

Crozat began gradually to acquire a notable collection of paintings, old master drawings, and &quot;objets d&#x27;art&quot;, sometimes referred to as the &quot;Cabinet Crozat&quot;. His collection of old master drawings was already one of the most important in France at the beginning of the 18th century. Among his paintings was Annibale Carracci&#x27;s &quot;Self-Portrait on an Easel&quot;.

Between 1729 and 1742, a finely-illustrated, two-volume work was published, known as the &quot;Recueil Crozat&quot;, including reproductive prints of some of the finest paintings and drawings in French collections. Many of his old master drawings, catalogued by Pierre-Jean Mariette, one of the four acknowledged expert connoisseurs in Paris, were dispersed at auction in Paris in 1741. That occasion was termed by Michael Jaffé as &quot;the greatest public sale of drawings held in the &quot;dix-huitième&quot;.&quot;

Most of Crozat&#x27;s treasures were inherited by his nephews, Louis François (d. 1750), Joseph Antoine (d. 1750), and Louis Antoine (d. 1770), who added to the collection. The works of art were dispersed after the nephews&#x27; deaths. Louis Antoine Crozat&#x27;s collection was bought in 1772, through Denis Diderot and Vasiliy Rudanovsky, by Catherine II of Russia and went to the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg.

<text>Yesaul, osaul or osavul (, ) (from Turkic yasaul - &quot;chief&quot;), is a post and a rank in the Russian and Ukrainian Cossack units.

The first records of the rank imply that it was introduced by Stefan Batory, King of Poland in 1576.

==Cossacks in Russia==
There were different yesaul posts and ranks in Cossack Hosts in Imperial Russia:
*Генеральный есаул (&quot;generalny yesaul&quot;) - General Yesaul
*Походный есаул (&quot;pokhodny yesaul&quot;) - Campaign Yesaul
*Войсковой есаул (&quot;voiskovoy yesaul&quot;) - Army Yesaul
*Полковой есаул (&quot;polkovoy yesaul&quot;) - Regimental Yesaul
*Артиллерийский есаул (&quot;artilleriysky yesaul&quot;) - Artillery Yesaul
*Сотенный есаул (&quot;sotenny yesaul&quot;) - Company Yesaul (commander of a sotnia)
*Станичный есаул (&quot;stanichny yesaul&quot;) - Yesaul of a stanitsa

==Cossack Hetmanate and Sloboda Ukraine ==
In Ukraine of the 17th and 18th centuries, an osaul was a military and administrative official performing the duties of aide-de-camp. The head of state, hetman, would appoint up to two osauls known as a General Osaul. There also was a Regimental Osaul as well as Company Osaul, with each regular cossack regiment and company except artillery having two of each. Beside them there were osauls under special assignments, one of them serving for General Obozny (quartermaster) who performed duties of a chief executive and was the second in importance after the Hetman.

===General Osaul===
A senior officer of a Hetmanate cossack army who was a member of the general officer staff.
;Duties
*supervising army&#x27;s condition
*leading large detachments (wartime)
*managing muster rolls
*directing the army engineers
*commanding mercenary troops
*sometimes serving as an acting hetman

Other duties consisted of being a hetman&#x27;s envoy, supervised matters of internal security, conducted annual regimental musters and inspections. Among the notorious osauls were Petro Doroshenko, Demian Mnohohrishny, Ivan Mazepa, and Ivan Skoropadsky.

From 1798 to 1800 after the liquidation of the Zaporizhian Host, the rank of osaul was equated with the ranks of rittmeister in cavalry and captain in infantry.

===Regimental Osavul===
Regimental Osavul () is an assistant Colonel in Military Affairs.

===Sotenny Osavul===
Sotenny Osavul () is an assistant sotnik in Military Affairs.

== In popular culture ==
In the ukrainian folk song &quot;Zadumaly Bazylevtsi&quot; (Задумали Базилевці) about the anti-serfdom uprising in Turbaii (1789—1793), the wife of the Bazylevskyj family sends Yesauls to take care of the serfs, but they are met with unexpected resistance. The serfs end up invading the Bazylevskyj residence and murdering the land owners.

<text>Tridecane or &quot;n&quot;-tridecane is an alkane with the chemical formula CH3(CH2)11CH3. Tridecane is a combustible colourless liquid. In industry, they have no specific value aside from being components of various fuels and solvents. In the research laboratory, tridecane is also used as a distillation chaser.

==Natural occurrence==
Nymphs of the southern green shield bug produce tridecane as a dispersion/aggregation pheromone, which possibly serves as a defense against predators. It is also the main component of the defensive fluid produced by the stink bug &quot;Cosmopepla bimaculata&quot;.

<doc id="1034399" wikidata="Q5322015" url="?curid=1034399" title="E. L. Wisty">
<text>E. L. Wisty was a fictional character created and played by the comedian Peter Cook on and off throughout his career. A bland, monotonal know-it-all, Wisty usually appeared in monologues, or in two-handed sketches in which he bores the other person. According to British comedy scholar Roger Wilmut, &quot;The striking thing about E. L. Wisty was that he never smiled—Cook managed to keep a straight face throughout, despite the audience laughter.&quot;

==History==
The character was originally known as Mr Boylett, after the table butler at Radley College, the school Cook attended. Cook started by doing impressions of the real Mr Boylett, telling bizarre tales including that of the Holy Bee of Ephesus, which flew three times round the crucified Jesus, and stories of how Mr Boylett bought various inanimate objects after he thought he saw them move. Cook was encouraged to transfer these tales to stage monologues when he was a student at the University of Cambridge. It was then that he changed the name of the character, first to Mr Arthur Grole, then to E. L. Wisty. (Cook lived for a short while in Uplyme in Devon. At the time, a few miles away in Lyme Regis, there was an electrical retail shop called &quot;E. L. Wiscombe&quot;. This could have been the root of the name, though there is no documentary evidence for this.)

Wisty appears in a sketch in &quot;Beyond the Fringe&quot; involving his aspirations to become a judge, though his lack of Latin has caused him to fail &quot;the rigorous judging exams&quot;. This has led to his becoming a coal miner instead, since on the miners&#x27; exam &quot;They only ask you one question. They ask, &#x27;Who are you?&#x27; and I got 75 per cent on that.&quot;

In later sketches Wisty became known for bothering members of the public on park benches with his monologues on topics including tadpoles, royalty, newts, peace through nudism, inalienable rights and his (equally fictional) friend Spotty Muldoon. His foils were such comic actors as John Cleese and John Bird.

In 1964 Wisty and Spotty formed the World Domination League, with aspirations to dominate the world by 1958 [&quot;sic&quot;]. Cook enlisted a secretary at &quot;Private Eye&quot; to send out postcards announcing: &quot;We shall move about in people&#x27;s rooms and say, &#x27;Excuse me, we are the World Domination League. May we dominate you?&#x27; Then, if they say &#x27;Get out,&#x27; of course we give up.&quot; The postcard also listed the league&#x27;s demands:
#Total domination of the world by 1958.
#Domination of the astral spheres quite soon too.
#The finding of lovely ladies for Spotty Muldoon within the foreseeable future.
#Getting a nuclear arm to deter with.
#The bodily removal from this planet of C. P. Snow and Alan Freeman and their replacement with fine trees.
#Stopping the government from crawling up our pipes and listening to all we say.
#Training bees for uses against foreign powers, and so on.
#Elimination of spindly insects and encouragement of lovely little newts who dance about and are happy.
#E. L. Wisty for God.

<text>Bill is the debut studio album American rock band Tripping Daisy. It was first released in November 1992 on the Dragon Street label, and then re-released on July 20, 1993 on the Island Red Label. On the re-release, the track &quot;Green Tambourine&quot; was removed, and the two unlisted tracks were appended to the final track.

The album had sold around 15,000 copies before it was picked up by Island. &quot;My Umbrella&quot; spent two weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart, peaking at No. 24. The album is being released on vinyl in 2023 as part of the DFW Legacy Series.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Trouser Press&quot; wrote that &quot;singer/lyricist Tim DeLaughter’s acrobatic vocals and guitarist Wes Berggren’s propulsive strumming lend &quot;Bill&quot; enough variety to keep it from sinking into blandlivion-but just barely.&quot;

<doc id="1034422" wikidata="Q737405" url="?curid=1034422" title="Three pillars of the European Union">
<text>Between 1993 and 2009, the European Union (EU) legally comprised three pillars. This structure was introduced with the Treaty of Maastricht on 1 November 1993, and was eventually abandoned on 1 December 2009 upon the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, when the EU obtained a consolidated legal personality.
#The European Communities pillar handled economic, social and environmental policies. It comprised the European Community (EC), the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC, until its expiry in 2002), and the European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM).
#The Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) pillar took care of foreign policy and military matters.
#Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters (PJCCM) brought together co-operation in the fight against crime. This pillar was originally named Justice and Home Affairs (JHA)

==Overview==
Within each pillar, a different balance was struck between the supranational and intergovernmental principles.

Supranationalism was strongest in the first pillar. Its function generally corresponded at first to the three European Communities (European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), European Economic Community (EEC) and Euratom) whose organisational structure had already been unified in 1965–67, through the Merger Treaty. Later, through the Treaty of Maastricht the word &quot;Economic&quot; was removed from the EEC, so it became simply the EC. Then with the Treaty of Amsterdam additional areas would be transferred from the third pillar to the first. In 2002, the ECSC (which had a lifetime of 50 years) ceased to exist because the treaty which established it, the Treaty of Paris, had expired.

In the CFSP and PJCCM pillars the powers of the European Parliament, the Commission and European Court of Justice with respect to the Council were significantly limited, without however being altogether eliminated. The balance struck in the first pillar was frequently referred to as the &quot;community method&quot;, since it was that used by the European Community.

==History==

===1993: Origin===

The pillar structure had its historical origins in the negotiations leading up to the Maastricht Treaty. It was desired to add powers to the Community in the areas of foreign policy, security and defence policy, asylum and immigration policy, criminal co-operation, and judicial co-operation.

However, some member-states opposed the addition of these powers to the Community on the grounds that they were too sensitive to national sovereignty for the community method to be used, and that these matters were better handled intergovernmentally. To the extent that at that time the Community dealt with these matters at all, they were being handled intergovernmentally, principally in European Political Cooperation (EPC).

As a result, these additional matters were not included in the European Community; but were tacked on externally to the European Community in the form of two additional &#x27;pillars&#x27;. The first additional pillar (Common Foreign and Security Policy, CFSP) dealt with foreign policy, security and defence issues, while the second additional pillar (JHA, Justice and Home Affairs), dealt with the remainder.

===1999 and 2003: Amendments===

Amendments by the treaty of Amsterdam and the treaty of Nice made the additional pillars increasingly supranational. Most important among these were the transfer of policy on asylum, migration and judicial co-operation in civil matters to the Community pillar, effected by the Amsterdam treaty. Thus the third pillar was renamed Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters, or PJCCM. The term &quot;Justice and Home Affairs&quot; was still used to cover both the third pillar and the transferred areas.

===2009: Abolition===

In a speech before the Nice Conference, Joschka Fischer, then Foreign Minister of Germany, called for a simplification of the European Union. One of these core ideas was to abolish the pillar structure, and replace it with a merged legal personality for the Union. This idea was included in the Treaty of Lisbon, which entered into force on 1 December 2009. With a legal personality, &quot;Union&quot; is, for instance, able to be part of international treaties. The Treaty of Lisbon also states that &quot;the Union shall replace and succeed the European Community,&quot; with the effect that, once the Treaty entered into force, the EU obtained the membership of the World Trade Organization (WTO) which had belonged to the European Communities pillar.

The abolition of the &quot;3-pillar structure&quot; was welcomed by practitioners and academics who had long considered the &#x27;pillar metaphor&quot; to be unrealistic, if not absurd. The idea that one pillar could be the Communities, while the other two were merely &quot;policies&quot; or &quot;cooperation&quot; was scarcely credible.

In the Lisbon Treaty the distribution of competences in various policy areas between Member States and the Union was reorganised into the following scheme:

<doc id="1034424" wikidata="Q1413501" url="?curid=1034424" title="Ockham New Zealand Book Awards">
<text>The Ockham New Zealand Book Awards are literary awards presented annually in New Zealand. The awards began in 1996 as the merger of two literary awards events: the New Zealand Book Awards, which ran from 1976 to 1995, and the Goodman Fielder Wattie Book Awards, which ran from 1968 to 1995 (known as the Montana Book Awards from 1994 to 1995). 

The awards have changed name several times depending on sponsorship. From 1996 to 2009, the awards were known as the Montana New Zealand Book Awards, and sponsored by Montana Wines. From 2010 until 2014, the awards were known as the New Zealand Post Book Awards. Since 2015, the main sponsors have been property developer Ockham Residential, the Acorn Foundation, Creative New Zealand, Mary and Peter Biggs, Booksellers Aotearoa New Zealand and biotech company MitoQ. The awards event is the opening event of the Auckland Writers Festival, held annually in May.
==History and format==
Before 1996 there were two major New Zealand literary awards events: the Goodman Fielder Wattie Book Awards (1968 to 1995, known as the Montana Book Awards from 1994 to 1995) and the New Zealand Book Awards (1976 to 1995).

The Wattie Book of the Year Award (named for Sir James Wattie) was formed in 1968, supported by the New Zealand Publishers Association and sponsored by the company Wattie&#x27;s. This award was the first of its kind in New Zealand. The first recipients were John Morton and Michael Miller for &quot;The New Zealand Sea Shore&quot;. The first novel to win an award was &quot;Smith&#x27;s Dream&quot; by C.K. Stead in 1972. The award became the Goodman Fielder Wattie Awards, and only had a single category covering fiction, non-fiction and other genres. In 1994 the winemaking company Montana became the sponsor and the awards were renamed to the Montana Book Awards. 

The New Zealand Book Awards were set up by the New Zealand Literary Fund, a government organisation, in 1976. Annual awards were presented for literary merit in fiction, non-fiction, poetry and (later) book production.

In 1996, the two award series were amalgamated to form the Montana New Zealand Book Awards, managed by Booksellers New Zealand (a bookselling association) and offering prizes in six categories. In 2010, the New Zealand Post took over as sponsor, having supported the New Zealand Book Awards for Children and Young Adults for the previous 14 years.

In 2015, Auckland property development firm Ockham Residential assumed sponsorship of the awards, and the New Zealand Book Awards Trust took over the governance and management. No prizes were presented in that year, and the awards were streamlined to discontinue the Book of the Year Award, the Booksellers&#x27; Choice Award and the People&#x27;s Choice Award. Since the first Ockham New Zealand Book Awards in 2016, the ceremony has been held each year in May, as part of the Auckland Writers Festival. In 2020 the award winners were announced in a virtual presentation, after the Auckland Writers Festival was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

, there are five principal prizes: fiction (currently known as the Jann Medlicott Acorn Prize for Fiction), general non-fiction (sponsored by Royal Society Te Apārangi), illustrated non-fiction, poetry (currently known as the Mary and Peter Biggs Award for Poetry) and Te Mūrau o te Tuhi Māori Language Award for books written entirely in te reo Māori. &quot;Best First Book&quot; prizes are awarded to first time authors in the first four categories, currently sponsored by MitoQ. Each category is judged by a panel of three judges. Winners of the Jann Medlicott Acorn Prize for Fiction receive a minimum of 55,000, and is the largest cash book prize in New Zealand. The other principal prizewinners receive 10,000 each, and the winners of the four MitoQ Best First Book awards receive 2,500.

Since 2020, the top prize for fiction has been the Jann Medlicott Acorn Prize for Fiction. Between 2017 and 2019, the top prize for fiction was known as the Acorn Foundation Fiction Prize. In 2017, it was known as the Acorn Foundation Literary Award. From 1996 to 2016, it was known as the Fiction Prize.

<text>The Erie Otters are a major junior ice hockey team based in Erie, Pennsylvania. They are members of the Midwest division of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL), one of only three American teams in the league. The team&#x27;s name refers to the North American river otter common to Lake Erie. The Otters play at Erie Insurance Arena in downtown Erie, next door to UPMC Park and the Warner Theatre.

The Otters have a history of notable achievements within the Ontario Hockey League. The team has twice captured the prestigious J. Ross Robertson Cup as OHL champions, in the 2001–02 and 2016–17 seasons. Furthermore, they were awarded the Wayne Gretzky Trophy as Western Conference champions in the 2014–15 and 2016–17 seasons. Their regular season dominance is underscored by securing the Hamilton Spectator Trophy for attaining first place in the league standings during the 2000–01, 2015–16, and 2016–17 seasons. Additionally, the Otters have consistently excelled in divisional play, earning the Holody Trophy as Midwest Division champions in multiple seasons. These accolades collectively highlight the team&#x27;s sustained success and competitive excellence across various facets of league competition.

==History==
===Relocation years (1946–1996)===
The franchise now known as the Erie Otters originated as the Windsor Spitfires in 1946. The team remained in Windsor until 1953, when the franchise was relocated to Hamilton, and rebranded as the Tiger Cubs. During this period, the team played its home games at the Barton Street Arena. In 1960, the franchise underwent another transformation, adopting the name Hamilton Red Wings following a partial acquisition by the Detroit Red Wings of the National Hockey League (NHL). This change marked a significant affiliation between the junior team and its NHL counterpart.

By the 1972–73 season, the franchise underwent another significant transition under the new ownership of Ron Cupido and the Finochio brothers, rebranding as the Hamilton Fincups. The team remained based in Hamilton until 1976, when the closure and subsequent condemnation of the Hamilton Forum necessitated a relocation. For the 1976–77 season, the Fincups played at the Garden City Arena in St. Catharines. The franchise returned to Hamilton the following season, establishing itself at Mountain Arena. However, ongoing challenges, including low attendance figures and the absence of a new, modern facility, prompted yet another relocation. For the 1978–79 season, the team moved to Brantford, where it was renamed the Alexanders. These transitions reflect the franchise&#x27;s ongoing struggle to secure long-term stability in its home markets.

By the 1984–85 season, the franchise returned to Hamilton under the new moniker Steelhawks, with plans to establish itself in the newly constructed Copps Coliseum. Despite the promise of the new venue, the team continued to face challenges with low attendance, prompting another relocation for the 1988 season. The franchise moved to Niagara Falls, Ontario, where it was rebranded as the Thunder. In the 1996 season, the team underwent its final relocation, crossing the border into Pennsylvania to become the Erie Otters.

The Otters achieved significant success at the turn of the millennium, securing the Holody Trophy as Midwest Division champions in 1999, the first of three consecutive division titles. This period of dominance culminated in the team capturing the J. Ross Robertson Cup as Ontario Hockey League champions during the 2001–02 season. Head coach Dave MacQueen was subsequently recognized for his contributions, receiving the OHL Coach of the Year award for the 2001–02 season. Additionally, general manager Sherwood Bassin was honored with both the OHL Executive of the Year and CHL Executive of the Year awards in recognition of his pivotal role in assembling and managing the championship-winning team.

===Qualifying for the playoffs for the first time (1997–2001)===
In the early 2000s, the Otters moved up in the league standings gaining the help of players such as Brad Boyes and Dan Cleary. In 2001, the Otters secured a playoff berth, advancing to the Western Conference final, where they were ultimately defeated by the Plymouth Whalers.

===The emergence of Ryan O&#x27;Reilly (2006–08)===
During the 2006–07 and 2007–08 seasons, the Otters finished at the bottom of the Western Conference standings. However, the team saw the emergence of future NHL star Ryan O&#x27;Reilly, who was selected first overall in the 2007 OHL draft, receiving the prestigious Jack Ferguson Award. In his rookie season (2007–08), O&#x27;Reilly demonstrated considerable promise, recording 52 points in 61 games. He was subsequently named the Otters&#x27; Rookie of the Year and Most Sportsmanlike Player, in addition to being Erie&#x27;s nominee for the Bobby Smith Trophy, recognizing his achievements both on and off the ice.

===The rise of Connor McDavid (2012–15)===
Following their years of decline, the Otters entered a rebuilding phase, emphasizing the drafting and development of young talent. This strategy proved successful when they selected Connor McDavid first overall in the 2012 OHL priority selection. McDavid quickly distinguished himself as an exceptional player, garnering attention for his extraordinary skill and on-ice vision. Under his leadership, the Otters returned to championship contention, achieving a remarkable record of 50 wins during the 2014–15 season, a franchise best. McDavid was also granted &quot;exceptional player&quot; status by Hockey Canada, enabling him to join the Otters at the age of fifteen. He led the team to the J. Ross Robertson Cup finals 2015, where they were ultimately defeated by the Oshawa Generals.

===Memorial Cup appearance (2017)===
On March 18, 2017, the Otters made history by becoming the first team in Canadian Hockey League (CHL) history to achieve four consecutive 50-win seasons from 2013 to 2017. Before this achievement, they had shared the record for three consecutive 50-win seasons with several teams, including the Kelowna Rockets (2012–15), Edmonton Oil Kings (2011–14), Saint John Sea Dogs (2009–12), and Kamloops Blazers (1989–92). 

During the Memorial Cup, on May 22, 2017, the Otters set a new record for the most goals scored by a single team in a single game, defeating the Saint John Sea Dogs with a score of 12–5. This victory surpassed the previous record of 11 goals set by the Quebec Remparts in 1974 (11–3) and the Regina Pats in 1980 (11–2). Individual achievements included Dylan Strome, who recorded a remarkable seven points in a single game (four goals, three assists), while Taylor Raddysh tied the former record of six points (two goals, four assists) in the same game.

===Possible relocation (2019–present)===
Following several years of speculation regarding a potential relocation to Hamilton, the Otters formalized a ten-year lease agreement with Erie Insurance Arena in September 2019.

On January 17, 2022, the Otters marked a significant milestone by hosting their inaugural Martin Luther King Jr. Day (MLK) game. This event featured Alex Randall, a student from the University of Pittsburgh, who made history as the first African-American play-by-play announcer in the histories of the Ontario and Canadian hockey leagues. This initiative continued in 2023 with Trey Matthews, a Pennsylvania native and student at Arizona State University, serving as the announcer for the MLK Jr. Day game.

==Uniforms and logos==
From their inception through the conclusion of the 2016–17 season, the Otters utilized a color palette of navy blue, gold, red, and white. The team&#x27;s primary logo depicted a stylized, anthropomorphic otter wielding a hockey stick and wearing hockey gear, enclosed within a circular design. The logo prominently featured the wordmark &quot;Otters&quot; in red, accented with gold and navy blue outlines. The home uniforms comprised navy blue sweaters with red and gold detailing, while the away uniforms showcased white jerseys accented with navy blue and red trim, maintaining a cohesive and vibrant visual identity.

During the 2013–14 season, the Otters introduced a gold alternate jersey that incorporated a navy blue shoulder yoke, navy blue and white striping, and a cursive &quot;Otters&quot; wordmark prominently displayed across the chest. This design was a tribute to the Erie Blades, a defunct hockey team that played in the region from 1975 to 1982. In 2016, the Otters expanded the use of this alternate jersey, designating it for every Saturday home game throughout the regular season. To further enhance the uniform&#x27;s aesthetic, the team replaced the blue helmets previously worn with the gold jerseys, introducing matching gold helmets to complete the look.

For the 2017–18 season, the Otters rebranded with a cursive &quot;Otters&quot; wordmark as their new primary logo. Alongside this change, the team adopted a permanent color scheme of gold, navy, and white. As part of the rebranding initiative, the previously used gold alternate jersey was designated as the team&#x27;s official home uniform. Additionally, a newly designed white jersey, styled to mirror the gold home jersey, was introduced as the primary away uniform. This redesign marked a significant shift in the team&#x27;s visual identity, emphasizing a cohesive and modernized aesthetic.

On May 20, 2019, the Otters unveiled an updated version of a previous logo, incorporating the team&#x27;s revised color palette of navy blue, gold, and gray. This refreshed emblem maintained the essence of the original design while introducing contemporary elements to reflect the team&#x27;s evolving identity. The update also included a redesigned shoulder patch, which featured the name &quot;Erie&quot; prominently displayed within the Pennsylvania keystone symbol, emphasizing the team&#x27;s connection to its home state.

==Arena==
The Erie Otters play their home games at Erie Insurance Arena, which opened in 1983 and seats more than 6,700 spectators for ice hockey.

<text>A podcast is a program made available in digital format for download over the Internet. Typically, a podcast is an episodic series of digital audio files that users can download to a personal device or stream to listen to at a time of their choosing. Podcasts are primarily an audio medium, but some distribute in video, either as their primary content or as a supplement to audio; popularised in recent years by video platform YouTube.

A podcast series usually features one or more recurring hosts engaged in a discussion about a particular topic or current event. Discussion and content within a podcast can range from carefully scripted to completely improvised. Podcasts combine elaborate and artistic sound production with thematic concerns ranging from scientific research to slice-of-life journalism. Many podcast series provide an associated website with links and show notes, guest biographies, transcripts, additional resources, commentary, and occasionally a community forum dedicated to discussing the show&#x27;s content.

The cost to the consumer is low, and many podcasts are free to download. Some podcasts are underwritten by corporations or sponsored, with the inclusion of commercial advertisements. In other cases, a podcast could be a business venture supported by some combination of a paid subscription model, advertising or product delivered after sale. Because podcast content is often free, podcasting is often classified as a disruptive medium, adverse to the maintenance of traditional revenue models. 

Podcasting is the preparation and distribution of audio or video files using RSS feeds to the devices of subscribed users. A podcaster normally buys this service from a podcast hosting company such as SoundCloud or Libsyn. Hosting companies then distribute these media files to podcast directories and streaming services, such as Apple and Spotify, which users can listen to on their smartphones or digital music and multimedia players. 

, there are at least 3,369,942 podcasts and 199,483,500 episodes.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Podcast&quot; is a portmanteau of &quot;iPod&quot; and &quot;broadcast&quot;. The earliest use of &quot;podcasting&quot; was traced to &quot;The Guardian&quot; columnist and BBC journalist Ben Hammersley, who coined it in early February 2004 while writing an article for &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper. The term was first used in the audioblogging community in September 2004, when Danny Gregoire introduced it in a message to the iPodder-dev mailing list, from where it was adopted by podcaster Adam Curry. Despite the etymology, the content can be accessed using any computer or similar device that can play media files. The term &quot;podcast&quot; predates Apple&#x27;s addition of podcasting features to the iPod and the iTunes software.

==History==
In September 2000, early MP3 player manufacturer i2Go offered a service called MyAudio2Go.com which allowed users to download news stories for listening on a PC or MP3 player. The service was available for about a year until i2Go&#x27;s demise in 2001.

In October 2000, the concept of attaching sound and video files in RSS feeds was proposed in a draft by Tristan Louis. The idea was implemented by Dave Winer, a software developer and an author of the RSS format.

In August 2004, Adam Curry launched his show &quot;Daily Source Code&quot;, 
focused on chronicling his everyday life, delivering news, and discussions about the development of podcasting. Curry promoted new and emerging internet audio shows in an attempt to gain traction in the development of what would come to be known as podcasting. &quot;Daily Source Code&quot; was initially directed at podcast developers. As its audience became interested in the format, these developers were inspired to create and produce their own projects and a community of pioneer podcasters quickly developed.

iPodderX, released in September 2004 by August Trometer and based on earlier work by Ray Slakinski, was the first GUI application for podcasts. 

In June 2005, Apple released iTunes 4.9, which added formal support for podcasts, thus negating the need to use a separate program in order to download and transfer them to a mobile device. Although this made access to podcasts more convenient and widespread, it also effectively ended advancement of podcatchers by independent developers. Additionally, Apple issued cease and desist orders to many podcast application developers and service providers for using the term &quot;iPod&quot; or &quot;Pod&quot; in their products&#x27; names.

By 2007, audio podcasts were doing what was historically accomplished via radio broadcasts, which had been the source of radio talk shows and news programs since the 1930s. This shift occurred as a result of the evolution of internet capabilities along with increased consumer access to cheaper hardware and software for audio recording and editing.

As of early 2019, the podcasting industry still generated little overall revenue, although the number of persons who listen to podcasts continues to grow steadily. Edison Research, which issues the Podcast Consumer quarterly tracking report estimated that 90 million persons in the U.S. had listened to a podcast in January 2019. In 2020, 58% of the population of South Korea and 40% of Spain had listened to a podcast in the last month; 12.5% of the UK population had listened to a podcast in the last week; and 22% of the United States population listened to at least one podcast weekly. The form is also acclaimed for its low overhead for a creator to start and maintain their show, merely requiring a microphone, a computer or mobile device, and associated software to edit and upload the final product. Some form of acoustic quieting is also often utilised.

===IP issues in trademark and patent law===
====Trademark applications====
Between February March 10 and 25, 2005, Shae Spencer Management, LLC of Fairport, New York filed a trademark application to register the term &quot;podcast&quot; for an &quot;online pre-recorded radio program over the internet&quot;. On September 9, 2005, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) rejected the application, citing Wikipedia&#x27;s podcast entry as describing the history of the term. The company amended their application in March 2006, but the USPTO rejected the amended application as not sufficiently differentiated from the original. In November 2006, the application was marked as abandoned.

====Apple trademark protections====
On September 26, 2004, it was reported that Apple Inc. had started to crack down on businesses using the string &quot;POD&quot;, in product and company names. Apple sent a cease and desist letter that week to Podcast Ready, Inc., which markets an application known as &quot;myPodder&quot;. Lawyers for Apple contended that the term &quot;pod&quot; has been used by the public to refer to Apple&#x27;s music player so extensively that it falls under Apple&#x27;s trademark cover. Such activity was speculated to be part of a bigger campaign for Apple to expand the scope of its existing iPod trademark, which included trademarking &quot;IPOD&quot;, &quot;IPODCAST&quot;, and &quot;POD&quot;. On November 16, 2006, the Apple Trademark Department stated that &quot;Apple does not object to third-party usage of the generic term &#x27;podcast&#x27; to accurately refer to podcasting services&quot; and that &quot;Apple does not license the term&quot;. However, no statement was made as to whether or not Apple believed they held rights to it.

====Personal Audio lawsuits====
Personal Audio, a company referred to as a &quot;patent troll&quot; by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), filed a patent on podcasting in 2009 for a claimed invention in 1996. In February 2013, Personal Audio started suing high-profile podcasters for royalties, including &quot;The Adam Carolla Show&quot; and the &quot;HowStuffWorks&quot; podcast. In October 2013, the EFF filed a petition with the US Trademark Office to invalidate the Personal Audio patent. On August 18, 2014, the EFF announced that Adam Carolla had settled with Personal Audio. Finally, on April 10, 2015, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office invalidated five provisions of Personal Audio&#x27;s podcasting patent.

==Production and listening==
A podcast generator maintains a central list of the files on a server as a web feed that one can access through the Internet. The listener or viewer uses special client application software on a computer or media player, known as a podcast client, which accesses this web feed, checks it for updates, and downloads any new files in the series. This process can be automated to download new files automatically, so it may seem to listeners as though podcasters broadcast or &quot;push&quot; new episodes to them. Podcast files can be stored locally on the user&#x27;s device, or streamed directly. There are several different mobile applications that allow people to follow and listen to podcasts. Many of these applications allow users to download podcasts or stream them on demand. Most podcast players or applications allow listeners to skip around the podcast and to control the playback speed. Much podcast listening occurs during commuting; because of restrictions on travel during the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of unique listeners in the US decreased by 15% in the last three weeks of March 2020.

Podcasting has been considered a converged medium (a medium that brings together audio, the web and portable media players), as well as a disruptive technology that has caused some individuals in radio broadcasting to reconsider established practices and preconceptions about audiences, consumption, production and distribution.

Podcasts can be produced at little to no cost and are usually disseminated free-of-charge, which sets this medium apart from the traditional 20th-century model of &quot;gate-kept&quot; media and their production tools. Podcasters can, however, still monetize their podcasts by allowing companies to purchase ad time. They can also garner support from listeners through crowdfunding websites like Patreon, which provide special extras and content to listeners for a fee.

==Types of podcasts==
Podcasts vary in style, format, and topical content. Podcasts are partially patterned on previous media genres but depart from them systematically in certain computationally observable stylistic respects. The conventions and constraints which govern that variation are emerging and vary over time and markets; podcast listeners have various preferences of styles but conventions to address them and communicate about them are still unformed. Some current examples of types of podcasts are given below. This list is likely to change as new types of content, new technology to consume podcasts, and new use cases emerge.

===Enhanced podcasts===
An enhanced podcast, also known as a slidecast, is a type of podcast that combines audio with a slide show presentation. It is similar to a video podcast in that it combines dynamically generated imagery with audio synchronization, but it is different in that it uses presentation software to create the imagery and the sequence of display separately from the time of the original audio podcast recording. &quot;The Free Dictionary&quot;, &quot;YourDictionary&quot;, and &quot;PC Magazine&quot; define an enhanced podcast as &quot;an electronic slide show delivered as a podcast&quot;. Enhanced podcasts are podcasts that incorporate graphics and chapters. iTunes developed an enhanced podcast feature called &quot;Audio Hyperlinking&quot; that they patented in 2012. Enhanced podcasts can be used by businesses or in education. Enhanced podcasts can be created using QuickTime AAC or Windows Media files. Enhanced podcasts were first used in 2006.

===Fiction podcast===
A fiction podcast (also referred to as a &quot;scripted podcast&quot; or &quot;audio drama&quot;) is similar to a radio drama, but in podcast form. They deliver a fictional story, usually told over multiple episodes and seasons, using multiple voice actors, dialogue, sound effects, and music to enrich the story. Fiction podcasts have attracted a number of well-known actors as voice talents, including Demi Moore and Matthew McConaughey as well as from content producers like Netflix, Spotify, Marvel Comics, and DC Comics. Unlike other genres, downloads of fiction podcasts increased by 19% early in the COVID-19 pandemic.

===Podcast novels===
A podcast novel (also known as a &quot;serialized audiobook&quot; or &quot;podcast audiobook&quot;) is a literary form that combines the concepts of a podcast and an audiobook. Like a traditional novel, a podcast novel is a work of literary fiction; however, it is recorded into episodes that are delivered online over a period of time. The episodes may be delivered automatically via RSS or through a website, blog, or other syndication method. Episodes can be released on a regular schedule, e.g., once a week, or irregularly as each episode is completed. In the same manner as audiobooks, some podcast novels are elaborately narrated with sound effects and separate voice actors for each character, similar to a radio play or scripted podcast, but many have a single narrator and few or no sound effects.

Some podcast novelists give away a free podcast version of their book as a form of promotion. On occasion such novelists have secured publishing contracts to have their novels printed. Podcast novelists have commented that podcasting their novels lets them build audiences even if they cannot get a publisher to buy their books. These audiences then make it easier to secure a printing deal with a publisher at a later date. These podcast novelists also claim the exposure that releasing a free podcast gains them makes up for the fact that they are giving away their work for free.

===Video podcasts===
A video podcast is a podcast that features video content. Web television series are often distributed as video podcasts. &quot;Dead End Days, a&quot; serialized dark comedy about zombies released from October 31, 2003, through 2004, is commonly believed to be the first video podcast.

=== Live podcasts ===
A number of podcasts are recorded either in total or for specific episodes in front of a live audience. Ticket sales allow the podcasters an additional way of monetizing. Some podcasts create specific live shows to tour which are not necessarily included on the podcast feed. Events including the London Podcast Festival, SF Sketchfest and others regularly give a platform for podcasters to perform live to audiences.

==Technology==
===Software===
Podcast episodes are widely stored and encoded in the mp3 digital audio format and then hosted on dedicated or shared webserver space. Syndication of podcasts&#x27; episodes across various websites and platforms is based on RSS feeds, an XML-formatted file citing information about the episode and the podcast itself.

===Hardware===

The most basic equipment for a podcast is a computer and a microphone. It is helpful to have a sound-proof room and headphones. The computer should have a recording or streaming application installed. Typical microphones for podcasting are connected using USB. If the podcast involves two or more people, each person requires a microphone, and a USB audio interface is needed to mix them together. If the podcast includes video, then a separate webcam might be needed, and additional lighting.

<text>Kathleen Charlotte McInerney, known professionally as Veronica Taylor, is an American voice actress known for her dubbing work in English-language adaptations of Japanese anime, in particular for voicing Ash Ketchum and his mother Delia in the &quot;Pokémon&quot; anime for its first eight seasons. Other voices she has done include Amelia Wil Tesla Seyruun from &quot;Slayers&quot;, Sailor Pluto from &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; and &quot;Sailor Moon Crystal&quot;, Nico Robin in the 4Kids dub of &quot;One Piece&quot;, April O&#x27;Neil in the 2003 &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; series and has voiced video game characters like Cosmos from &quot;Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy&quot;, &quot;Dissidia Final Fantasy&quot;, and &quot;Dissidia Final Fantasy NT&quot;. Additionally, using her real name, she is a narrator for various audio books, such as the &quot;&quot; arc from the &quot;Warriors&quot; series.

==Early life ==
Taylor wanted to act professionally since she was in her first play when she was five. She studied acting at The Catholic University of America and Brandeis University. She worked as a teacher at Pigeon Forge High School for a year while starting her voice-acting career.

==Career==
Taylor was featured in numerous plays and toured with National Players under the leadership of William H. Graham, the chairman of Catholic U&#x27;s Drama Department, and other stage companies in the Washington, D.C. area and other cities all around the United States for a few years before settling in New York.
Her other roles include Ash Ketchum, his mother Delia, and May in the 4Kids dub of the &quot;Pokémon&quot; anime series, April O&#x27;Neil from the 2003 &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; series, Amelia Wil Tesla Seyruun in the &quot;Slayers&quot; TV series, voice of Mangchi in the English dub of &quot;Hammerboy&quot;, the voice of Nico Robin in the 4Kids dub of &quot;One Piece&quot;, and the voice of Sailor Pluto in the Viz Media dub of &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; and &quot;Sailor Moon Crystal&quot;. Taylor said voicing Ash Ketchum was her &quot;the greatest responsibility of my life&quot; and &quot;one that changed the trajectory of how I want to be in the world.&quot;

Taylor has also narrated audio books written by Judy Blume, Wendy Mass, Danielle Steel, Linda Castillo, Russell Ginns, Louise Erdrich, and Mary Kay Andrews among others. She has also narrated for Gayle Foreman.

==Personal life==
Taylor has one daughter, Rena, born in 1998. After living in New York City, New York, she relocated to Los Angeles, California in 2015.

Taylor has developed strong ties to the Washington, D.C. area and to Boston: playing women&#x27;s soccer for the Catholic University Cardinals; and being a Commanders, Capitals and Red Sox fan. (She lived in the same Arlington neighborhood as legendary wide receiver Art Monk.) Both of her parents attended Catholic University and toured with National Players as well.

<text>Conor Lenihan (born 3 March 1963) is an Irish former Fianna Fáil politician who served as a Minister of State from 2004 to 2011. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Dublin South-West constituency from 1997 to 2011.

From 2011 to 2015, he was a vice president of the Skolkovo Foundation, the coordination body for a planned high-tech innovation centre on the edge of Moscow, where he worked on international partnership development.

==Early and personal life==
Lenihan was born in Dublin in 1963. He lived in Athlone until he was 11 years of age. He was educated at Belvedere College, University College Dublin (where he was chair of the Kevin Barry Cumann of Ógra Fianna Fáil), Dublin City University and the INSEAD.

Lenihan began his working life as a newspaper journalist in the 1980s in the House of Commons in London, where he was a political correspondent for the Irish News. While in London he was also a member of the European Commission&#x27;s Speakers Panel.

In the 1990s, he went into broadcast journalism working with the Dublin radio station 98FM. Lenihan also worked as a senior executive with O2, an Irish-owned mobile operator, and subsequently worked as an advisor for the company.

Lenihan is the son of former Tánaiste, TD and Minister Brian Lenihan. His grandfather, Patrick Lenihan, also served in the Oireachtas. His aunt, Mary O&#x27;Rourke, is a former TD, Senator and Minister, while his brother, Brian Lenihan Jnr was a TD and Minister for Finance from 2008 to 2011 during the Irish economic downturn.

Lenihan was diagnosed with a benign tumour in 2007.

Lenihan was also the editor of &quot;The Nation&quot;, the official publication of the Fianna Fáil party.

==Political career==
Lenihan was first elected to the Dáil at the 1997 general election.

In a reshuffle in October 2004, he was appointed by Bertie Ahern as Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs with special responsibility for Overseas Development and Human Rights. Lenihan restructured Ireland&#x27;s international aid programme, creating Irish Aid, the Irish Government&#x27;s programme of assistance to developing countries. Through Irish Aid, Lenihan administered a budget of almost a billion euros which is used to help developing nations thus continuing Ireland&#x27;s tradition of reaching out to other post-colonial nations.

In June 2007, when a new coalition government was formed by Ahern after the election, he was appointed as Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, at the Department of Education and Science, and at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, with responsibility for integration policy. He led a government initiative to deal with large volume immigration into Ireland which culminated with the publication of a new policy statement &quot;Migration Nation&quot;. He was reappointed in this role when Brian Cowen succeeded as Taoiseach in May 2008.

In a reshuffle in April 2009, he was appointed as Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, at the Department of Education and Science and at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, with special responsibility for Science, Technology, Innovation and Natural Resources. He created a single budget line for science and technology funding as well as participating in the country&#x27;s Innovation Task Force. As part of his role in the ministry, he participated in trade and investment missions, frequently presenting to top global companies who already invest in Ireland or were about to do so. He was a member of the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Economic Recovery.

He lost his seat at the 2011 general election, with his first preference vote declining from 20.5% in 2007 to just 5%. He placed eighth in the poll and was eliminated on the fourth count.

In October 2018, Lenihan announced his intention to seek the Fianna Fáil nomination for the Dublin constituency in the 2019 European Parliament elections. At the party candidate selection meeting in February 2019 Lenihan placed fourth out of four candidates with 108 votes of the 838 ballots cast.

===Controversies===
====Attitude to immigrants====
Lenihan was involved in some controversy on 18 May 2005, when off-microphone he told opposition TD Joe Higgins of the Socialist Party that he should &quot;stick to [helping] the kebabs&quot;, a reference to the Turkish workers who were making a legal challenge against their employer, GAMA. Lenihan apologised in the Dáil for the remarks.

In 2007, he banned Gardaí and Garda reserves from wearing the Sikh turban, saying &quot;if we are to take integration seriously, people who come here must understand our way of doing things. When the President and Ministers travel to the Middle East, they accept cultural requirements of the country and the culture in which they are operating. It is a vice-versa situation with regard to Ireland.&quot;

====&quot;The Origin of Specious Nonsense&quot;====
In September 2010, Lenihan attracted controversy when it emerged that he was to attend the launch of &quot;The Origin of Specious Nonsense&quot;, an anti-evolution book by John J. May. PZ Myers, on his &quot;Pharyngula&quot; blog, expressed shock that a Minister of State with special responsibility for Science would lend support to such a book. Lenihan claimed that he was &quot;not launching the book as Minister for Science but rather as a TD because May is a constituent of his&quot;. In the wake of this controversy, May asked Lenihan not to launch the book &quot;because I am so embarrassed that the Minister for Science has been so insulted&quot; and &quot;eviscerated&quot; on a political website.

====&quot;Tonight with Vincent Browne&quot;====
While appearing in March 2011 on &quot;Tonight with Vincent Browne&quot; on television, presenter Vincent Browne asked if there was &quot;a happy coincidence&quot; between matters of national importance and what Lenihan was personally interested in, leading to what &quot;The Irish Times&quot; described as &quot;some on-air rage&quot;.

==Post-political career==
In July 2011, Lenihan joined Skolkovo Foundation, a planned scientific and innovation centre outside Moscow, Russia. In August 2012, Lenihan joined the board of San Leon Energy, an oil and gas explorer with concessions in Poland, Albania, Morocco and Ireland. He remarried in Moscow in 2013.

<doc id="1034458" wikidata="Q240801" url="?curid=1034458" title="Greek salad">
<text>Greek salad or horiatiki salad ( or ) is a salad in Greek cuisine generally made with pieces of tomatoes, cucumbers, onion, feta cheese, and olives (typically Kalamata olives) and dressed with salt, Greek oregano, lemon juice and olive oil. Common additions include green bell pepper or caper berries (especially on the Cyclades islands). Greek salad is often imagined as a farmer&#x27;s breakfast or lunch, as its ingredients resemble those that a Greek farmer might have on hand.

== Outside Greece ==

Outside Greece, &quot;Greek salad&quot; may be a lettuce salad with Greek-inspired ingredients, even though the original dish is distinguished by the absence of lettuce. Meanwhile, the variant without lettuce may be called , &#x27;peasant salad&#x27;, or &#x27;village salad&#x27;.

However in most European countries, including the UK, the dish broadly resembles the original, albeit often with non-Greek substitutions such as another cheese since feta cheese enjoys protected designation of origin status.

In an American-style Greek salad, lettuce, tomatoes, feta (often served in multiple cube-shaped cuttings mixed with the vegetables), and olives are the most standard elements, but cucumbers, peperoncini (pickled hot peppers), bell peppers, onions, radishes, &quot;dolmades&quot;, and anchovies/sardines are common. Regional variants may include unusual components, e.g. in Detroit, beets, and in the Tampa Bay Area, potato salad. Dressings containing various herbs and seasonings are frequently used in the U.S. These styles of Greek salad are rarely encountered in Greece.

Various other salads have also been called &quot;Greek&quot; in the English language in the last century, including some with no apparent connection to Greek cuisine. A 1925 Australian newspaper described a Greek salad of boiled squash dressed with sour milk; a 1934 American newspaper described a mayonnaise-dressed lettuce salad with shredded cabbage and carrots.

== Other salads in Greece and Cyprus ==

There are many other salads in Greek cuisine. These include:

* (; a salad with lettuce, onion and dill)
* (; a shredded fresh cabbage salad dressed with olive oil, lemon juice, and garlic)
* (; boiled and sliced beetroots, sometimes with beet greens as well, dressed with olive oil and red wine vinegar)
* (; rocket (arugula) dressed with olive oil and red wine vinegar or lemon juice, possibly including anchovies)
* (; a potato salad with olive oil, finely sliced onions, lemon juice or vinegar)
* (; a chickpea salad)
* (; a parsley salad usually used as a condiment)
* &quot;Cypriot salad,&quot; native to the island of Cyprus, consists of finely chopped tomatoes, capers, cucumbers, onions, flat-leaf parsley, feta cheese, dressed with olive oil and lemon or red wine vinegar, and closely resembles the &quot;Greek salad&quot; of Greece.

Some spreads and dips found in the meze of Greek cuisine are also called &quot;salads&quot; in Greek, such as &quot;melitzanosalata&quot;, &quot;taramasalata&quot; and tzatziki.

<doc id="1034460" wikidata="Q1858474" url="?curid=1034460" title="Eugenio Garza Sada">
<text>Eugenio Garza Sada (January 11, 1892 – September 17, 1973) was an industrialist in the city of Monterrey, Mexico, best known for founding the Instituto Tecnologico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey (ITESM) school system in the country. Garza was born into a business family, with his father founding the Cuauhtémoc Brewery in Monterrey in 1890. After Garza graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), he began to work at the brewery, working his way up in the company to eventually take over as director after his father died. Garza and his brother Roberto grew the company into a conglomerate and instituted various innovations including benefits and social services for employees. Garza&#x27;s inspiration for founding ITESM came from his experience at MIT, as well as the desire to decrease Mexico&#x27;s dependence on foreign expert help. He remained the head of ITESM&#x27;s board until his death in 1973, as a result of a failed kidnapping attempt.

==Life==

Eugenio Garza Sada was born on January 11, 1892, in Monterrey, Mexico. He was the fourth of children of Isaac Garza Garza and Consuelo Sada Muguerza de Sada. Both parents came from highly influential business families. His paternal grandfather, Juan de la Garza Martinez, was mayor of Monterrey in the mid 19th century, building the Templo del Roble church in 1853. His father founded the Cuauhtémoc Brewery along with José Calderón Muguerza in 1890 with the help of foreign capital. His birth and early upbringing coincided with the industrialization that was taking place under the Porfirio Díaz regime at the end of the 19th century and very early 20th.

Garza&#x27;s upbringing was religious and conservative, initially attending Marist schools. It also revolved around the brewery business, visiting his father at the plant often. He attended primary school at the Colegio de San Juan in Saltillo, Coahuila, two hours away from the family home. He attended middle school in Monterrey at the Colegio Hidalgo. Their religious background also led the family to a history of philanthropy, especially supporting hospices such as Melitón Villareal and León Ortigosa in Monterrey, which Eugenio continued later in his life. In 1909, Monterrey experience severe flooding. The Garza house, which survived, became a shelter for the homeless and the company helped with reconstruction efforts.

This disaster was followed shortly after by the Mexican Revolution, which required the family to leave Mexico in 1913 and seek asylum in the United States, living in Brownsville and St. Louis. He continued high school and graduated from Western Military Academy, a military academy in Alton, Illinois. He then went to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, obtaining a bachelor&#x27;s degree in civil engineering in 1916. Along with going to school, Eugenio worked as a store clerk and an usher in a theater. During the war, the family house survived but not the original brewery which was destroyed or left in disrepair. Although the family continued to regain control of their properties, Garza&#x27;s father felt it was best that Eugenio and his younger brother Roberto continue their education in the United States, not only because of the advanced technology but also because there was more order there. This experience left an impression that would later lead to the formation of the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education.

In 1917, he returned to Mexico with his brother Roberto and both began working to rebuild the Cuauhtémoc Brewery, which the family had recovered. However, despite being the son of one of the principal founders and a MIT graduate, he was relegated to an inferior position and had to work his way up.

In 1921, he married Consuelo Lagüera Zambrano. The couple had eight children. Garza&#x27;s career was focused on the brewery, which he eventually directed and grew into a conglomerate called Grupo Valores Industriales, S.A. He is considered to be one of the most responsible for the growth of the state of Nuevo León in the 20th century. Most of what he founded still remains. However, he is best known as the founder of the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education, a private high school/university system in Mexico. He was described as modest, austere, frugal and of few words by various people, including his children. Although he was a millionaire, he rode in an antique car, had only three suits in his closet, all the same cut and color and generally wore cheaper shoes. He reinvested his money rather than spend it on lavish things. His hobbies were gardening and music.

==Career at Cuauhtémoc Brewery==
Garza&#x27;s career was dedicated to the economic development of the city of Monterrey, starting from his family&#x27;s Cuauhtémoc Brewery. After graduating college, he began to work at the company as an assistant in the sales department, having to work his way up. He and his brother introduced the use of carbonation to increase the head, the use of cardboard cases instead of wood and steel barrels instead of wood. The brothers also worked to diversify the company getting into the production of raw materials and packaging, changing the name to Grupo Monterrey. In World War II, the United States began to ration tin, a material that the company imported. In response, Grupo Monterrey began a new company called Hojalata y Lámina, S.A. to produce its own cans and bottles. After his father died, the family decided that Eugenio should take over directorship. The company continued to grow and diversify under Garza, changing name again to Grupo Valores Industriales, S.A. (VISA). At the time of his death in 1973, the enterprise consisted of Cuauhtémoc, Fábricas de Monterrey (founded 1920), Malta, S.A.(1929), Empaques de Cartón Titán (1936), Hojalata y Lámina, S.A. (HYLSA 1942), Grafo Regia, S.A. (1957), and Cevecería Cuauhtémoc Toluca (1969) created by Garza and his brother as well as companies bought by the group including Cevecería Central in 1929, Cervecería Oeste in 1933, Cevecería Tecate, Cevecería Humaya in 1954 and Cevecería Cruz Blanca (1965).

Along with technological and administrative innovations, Garza also implemented social ones. One of his innovations in business was to form an internal communications system, which at the time was a novelty. This included a publication called &quot;El abanderado&quot; and later &quot;Trabajo y ahorro&quot; which began in 1918 and published twice a month. He also wrote regular bulletins for workers at the factories he managed. He also developed the &quot;Ideario Cuauhtémoc, a set of seventeen principles set for both the company and its employees, a predecessor to codes of ethics. Concepts in the ideario included &quot;respect for others,&quot; &quot;control of temperament&quot; and &quot;Not mock others.&quot; This document was not only distributed to employees but also posted prominently in production areas and offices.

Garza and his brother continued and expanded on policies of his father in regards to worker welfare, providing social service and other benefits as well as cutting the work day down from the normal twelve hours to nine. One reason behind this was the family&#x27;s experience with the Mexican Revolution. Working for the welfare of their employees helped to foster loyalty to the company.

Two years after starting work with the company, the two brothers began the Sociedad Cuauhtémoc y Famosa, open to workers and managers of the enterprise. The organization offered health care services, courses to employees, scholarships for their children and a recreational center. In 1957, this organization created the Colonia Cuauhtémoc, a housing development for workers with subsidized mortgages offered by the company, which resulted in 334 homes over forty hectares. The inauguration of the project was attended by Mexican president Adolfo Ruiz Cortines. The project led to the creation of a program to help finance worker home construction which was reorganized in 1972 as the Patrimonio de Vivienda del Grupo Industrial. As part of the Sociedad Cuauhtémoc y Famosa, he established the radio station XET as well as Televisión Independiente de México. The latter eventually merged with another television company to form Televisa after Garza&#x27;s death. However, these activities were criticized as a kind of &quot;white syndicate&quot; (sindicato blanco) aimed at controlling workers and containing unionism.

In business he believed that authority should be centralized and clearly defined. Garza maintained the Monterrey tradition of an industrial class in which families maintained control of industry by handing down key roles through the generations. He felt that honest work brought men to liberty and culture. For him it gave humans dignity. He felt that one of his social obligations as a businessman was to create as many jobs as possible. He is quoted as saying &quot;I do not distribute riches: I distribute jobs. In this way, you will raise the standard of living of the people.&quot;

He was not politically involved, believing more in economic development for Mexico&#x27;s problems than social or political ones. He rejected state intervention in the affairs of private companies. His conservative and authoritarian views put him at odds with many by the end of the 1960s, including students, especially after the 1968 Tlatelolco massacre. His belief in keeping government out of business also put him at odds with Mexican president Luis Echeverría, but it was not public. Politically motivated businessmen allied with Echeverría were interested in a control over the Cadena García Valseca, which published thirty seven local newspapers in Mexico. Garza was against this move on economic and political grounds and offered the publishing group financing to stay solvent and resist takeovers by those sympathetic to the government. However, Garza died before the transaction took place.

==Tec de Monterrey==

Garza is considered to be one of Mexico&#x27;s second generation of industrialists, mostly distinguished from their Porfirian era predecessors by having a formal education. Garza founded the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education with the aim of forming highly qualified administrators and technical workers in Mexico, decreasing Mexican businesses&#x27; dependency of foreign experts. His first project in this area was the creation of the Escuela Politécnica Cuauhtémoc, which provided elementary and high school education along with technical skills. The need for a university level institution seemed more urgent with the outbreak of World War II among countries that normally provided expertise in Mexico. Another issue was that the state and federal authorities refounded the University of Nuevo León, but there were political conflicts in its operation, which Garza wanted to avoid. Garza&#x27;s experience at MIT was the basis for the organization of the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education, originally named Enseñanza e Investigación Superior, A.C. which he founded along with a group of Monterrey businessmen. It began in a house in the center of Monterrey in 1943, with 350 students and a number of professors. The federal government publicly declared that it would respect private educational initiatives, which was crucial for certification purposes and the organization&#x27;s incorporation as a civil association.

He called the school &quot;his ninth child.&quot; From that point on, he dedicated a significant amount of his time to the institution, being president of the board from 1943 until his death. Like he did for Cuauhtémoc, he created bulletins and other communications for the school as well as student newspapers. However, he did not permit political activism on the campus believing that the school should not be antagonistic to the government. However, this had the effect of alienating a good part of the student population and it also led to conflicts with the more liberal administrators. At the end of the 20th century, the school system had more than 80,000 students at the undergraduate and graduate levels.

==Death==
On the morning of September 17, 1973, Garza was on his way to work. At a red light in Monterrey, his car was blocked by another. Two young men got out and a struggle ensued. Garza&#x27;s driver and assistant were killed, as was Garza as he reached for his pistol. Two of the men were also killed, identified as Javier Rodriguez Torres and Hilario Juarez Garcia. It was a failed kidnapping attempt organized by the guerrilla Liga Comunista 23 de Septiembre.

Garza&#x27;s funeral was attended by over 200,000 people, including the then President Luis Echeverría. He was buried at the Panteón del Carmen in Monterrey.

An investigation in 2011 by the Excélsior newspaper into government records at the time showed that the Echeverría administration was aware of a plot by the group to kidnap Garza for a year and a half before it occurred but did not take action.

==Eugenio Garza Sada Award==
The Eugenio Garza Sada Award was created in the memory of Garza to preserve his values and ideas. This award is financed by FEMSA, the holding company of the Cuauhtémoc Moctezuma Brewery, and by the Monterrey Institute of Technology.

<doc id="1034465" wikidata="Q7287871" url="?curid=1034465" title="Ralph Montagu, 1st Duke of Montagu">
<text>Ralph Montagu, 1st Duke of Montagu (24 December 1638 – 9 March 1709) was an English courtier, diplomat, politician and peer.

==Background==

Ralph Montagu was the second son of Edward Montagu, 2nd Baron Montagu of Boughton (1616–1684), and Anne Winwood, daughter of the Secretary of State Ralph Winwood. The peerage of his father was one of several granted in the seventeenth century to different members of the Montagu family.

Sir Edward Montagu, Chief Justice of the King&#x27;s Bench in the time of Henry VIII, was grandfather of the 1st Earl of Manchester, and of the 1st Baron Montagu of Boughton (1562–1644), who was imprisoned in the Tower by the Parliament on account of his loyalty to Charles I. The eldest son of the latter, Edward, who succeeded him as the 2nd Baron, took the side of the Parliament in the Civil War, and was one of the lords who conducted the king from Newark-on-Trent to Holmby House in January 1647, after he was handed over by the Scots, to whom he had initially surrendered, to the custody of Parliament. Sir Edward had two sons, Edward and Ralph.

==Career==

The elder son, Edward, was Master of the Horse to Queen Catherine, wife of Charles II, a post from which he is said to have been dismissed by the king for &#x27;showing attention to the queen of too ardent a nature&#x27;. Catherine immediately appointed (in 1665) the younger brother, Ralph, to the vacant situation, and the latter soon acquired a reputation for gallantry at the court of Charles II. He took an active part in the negotiations in which Louis XIV purchased 
the neutrality or support of England in the war between France and the Netherlands. He was also appointed Master of the Great Wardrobe from 1671 to 1678 and from 1689 to his death.

Having quarrelled with Danby and the Duchess of Cleveland, who denounced him to the king, Montagu was elected member of Parliament for Northampton in 1678, with the intention of bringing about the fall of Danby; but, having produced letters seriously compromising the minister, the dissolution of Parliament placed him in such danger of arrest that he attempted to fly to France. Foiled in this design, he continued to intrigue against the government, supporting the movement for excluding the Duke of York from the succession and for recognizing the Duke of Monmouth as heir to the crown. After securing re-election to Parliament for Huntingdonshire in 1679 and again for Northampton in 1679 and 1681 his safety was then ensured by Parliamentary immunity. His elder brother having predeceased his father, Ralph became Baron Montagu of Boughton on the death of the latter in 1684.

Notwithstanding his former intrigues, Montagu gained the favour of King James II of England, on his accession to the throne; but this did not deter him from welcoming William of Orange, who created him Viscount Monthermer and Earl of Montagu later in 1689, on his accession to the English throne. Montagu was no less avaricious than unscrupulous. In 1673, he married Lady Elizabeth Wriothesley, the wealthy widow of Joceline Percy, 11th Earl of Northumberland and daughter of Thomas Wriothesley, 4th Earl of Southampton, who brought him a large fortune; and after her death in 1690, he remarried the still more wealthy Lady Elizabeth Cavendish, daughter of Henry Cavendish, 2nd Duke of Newcastle, and the widow of Christopher Monck, 2nd Duke of Albemarle.

Ralph Montagu&#x27;s position was further strengthened in 1705 by the marriage of his son and heir to Mary, daughter of John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough and Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough. In the same year he was created Duke of Montagu and Marquess of Monthermer. His London residence, Montagu House, Bloomsbury, was bought by the government in 1753 to hold the national collection of antiquities, and on its site was built the British Museum.

==Children==

Montagu and his first wife Elizabeth Wriothesley were parents to two children:

*John Montagu, 2nd Duke of Montagu (c. 1690 – 5 July 1749).
*Anne Montagu, married Alexander Popham (grandson of Alexander Popham), and had a daughter, Elizabeth, (d. 20 March 1761), who married firstly Edward Montagu, Viscount Hinchingbrooke, and secondly Francis Seymour, of Sherborne, Dorset.

Montagu and his second wife Elizabeth Monck had no known children. However, through this marriage the 1st Duke of Montagu acquired the Lordship of Bowland, one of northern England&#x27;s most powerful feudal lordships which on his death passed to John, the son of his first marriage.

==Royal Navy==
The pre-dreadnought battleship HMS &quot;Montagu&quot; was named after him.

<doc id="1034470" wikidata="Q1322810" url="?curid=1034470" title="Scattering amplitude">
<text>In quantum physics, the scattering amplitude is the probability amplitude of the outgoing spherical wave relative to the incoming plane wave in a stationary-state scattering process. At large distances from the centrally symmetric scattering center, the plane wave is described by the wavefunction
:formula_1
where formula_2 is the position vector; formula_3; formula_4 is the incoming plane wave with the wavenumber along the axis; formula_5 is the outgoing spherical wave; is the scattering angle (angle between the incident and scattered direction); and formula_6 is the scattering amplitude. The dimension of the scattering amplitude is length. The scattering amplitude is a probability amplitude; the differential cross-section as a function of scattering angle is given as its modulus squared,
:formula_7

The asymptotic form of the wave function in arbitrary external field takes the form
:formula_8
where formula_9 is the direction of incidient particles and formula_10 is the direction of scattered particles. 

==Unitary condition==
When conservation of number of particles holds true during scattering, it leads to a unitary condition for the scattering amplitude. In the general case, we have
:formula_11
Optical theorem follows from here by setting formula_12

In the centrally symmetric field, the unitary condition becomes
:formula_13
where formula_14 and formula_15 are the angles between formula_16 and formula_17 and some direction formula_18. This condition puts a constraint on the allowed form for formula_6, i.e., the real and imaginary part of the scattering amplitude are not independent in this case. For example, if formula_20 in formula_21 is known (say, from the measurement of the cross section), then formula_22 can be determined such that formula_6 is uniquely determined within the alternative formula_24.

== Partial wave expansion ==

In the partial wave expansion the scattering amplitude is represented as a sum over the partial waves,
:formula_25,
where is the partial scattering amplitude and are the Legendre polynomials. The partial amplitude can be expressed via the partial wave S-matrix element (formula_26) and the scattering phase shift as
:formula_27

Then the total cross section
:formula_28,
can be expanded as
:formula_29
is the partial cross section. The total cross section is also equal to formula_30 due to optical theorem.

For formula_31, we can write
:formula_32

==X-rays==
The scattering length for X-rays is the Thomson scattering length or classical electron radius, 0.

==Neutrons==
The nuclear neutron scattering process involves the coherent neutron scattering length, often described by .

==Quantum mechanical formalism==
A quantum mechanical approach is given by the S matrix formalism.

==Measurement==
The scattering amplitude can be determined by the scattering length in the low-energy regime.

<text>The Planiverse is a novel by A. K. Dewdney, written in 1984 about a two-dimensional world.

==Plot==
In the spirit of Edwin Abbott Abbott&#x27;s &quot;Flatland&quot;, Dewdney and his computer science students simulate a two-dimensional world with a complex ecosystem. To their surprise, they find their artificial 2D universe has somehow accidentally become a means of communication with an actual 2D world: Arde. They make a sort of &quot;telepathic&quot; contact with &quot;YNDRD&quot;, referred to by the students as Yendred, a highly philosophical Ardean, as he begins a journey across the western half, Punizla, of the single continent Ajem Kollosh to learn more about the spiritual beliefs of the people of the East, Vanizla. Yendred mistakes Dewdney&#x27;s class for &quot;spirits&quot; and takes great interest in communicating with them. The students and narrator communicate with Yendred by typing on the keyboard; Yendred&#x27;s answers appear on the computer&#x27;s printout. The name Yendred (or &quot;Yendwed&quot;, as pronounced by one of the students, who has a speech impediment) is simply &quot;Dewdney&quot; reversed.

Written as a travelogue, Yendred&#x27;s journey through the West takes him through several cities. He visits the Punizlan Institute for Technology and Science, where Arde&#x27;s technology is explored in great detail. For example, all houses are underground, so as not to be demolished by the periodic 2D rivers; nails are useless for attaching two objects, so tape and glue are used instead; most Ardean creatures cannot have deuterostomic digestive tracts since they would split into two; even games such as Go have one-dimensional Alak analogues. An appendix explains various other aspects of two-dimensional science and technology which could not fit into the main story.

The underlying allegory culminates in Yendred&#x27;s arrival at the watershed of the continent and the planet&#x27;s only building above ground, where he at last finds Drabk, an Ardean who professes &quot;knowledge of the Beyond&quot;, and teaches Yendred to fly. Yendred finds that to keep contact with Earth is no longer of benefit, and contact with Arde is lost.

==Development==
In 1977, Dewdney was inspired by an allegory of a two-dimensional universe, and decided to expand upon the physics and chemistry of such a universe. He published a short monograph in 1979 called &quot;Two-Dimensional Science and Technology&quot;. This was reviewed by Martin Gardner in his July 1980 &quot;Mathematical Games&quot; column in &quot;Scientific American&quot;, and shortly after this, all copies of the monograph were sold out. In 1981, following the success of the monograph, Dewdney published &quot;A Symposium on Two-Dimensional Science and Technology&quot;, which contained suggestions for how a two-dimensional universe would work from scientists and non-scientists on varied subjects. Dewdney wrote &quot;The Planiverse&quot; as a frame story in which to display the scientific and technical features from these previous works, as well as an allegory for his search for a reality deeper than that of scientific enquiry, and his subsequent conversion to Sufiism.

==Reception==
Dave Langford reviewed &quot;The Planiverse&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #55, and stated that &quot;This delightful book will be inspiring 2D game scenarios any second now.&quot;

&quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; considered it &quot;an ingenious intellectual exercise—amusing, edifying, sometimes tedious&quot; At Tor.com, Jason Shiga found it to be a &quot;tour de force followup&quot; to &quot;Flatland&quot;, and found the appendix to be the &quot;most impressive section&quot; of the book.

<doc id="1034478" wikidata="Q1483397" url="?curid=1034478" title="Raita">
<text>Raita is a side dish in Indian cuisine made of dahi (yogurt, often referred to as curd) together with raw or cooked vegetables, fruit, or in the case of boondi raita, with fried droplets of batter made from besan (chickpea flour, generally labeled as gram flour).

The closest approximation in Western cuisine is a side dish or dip, or a cooked salad. It is often referred to as a condiment, but unlike common Western condiments such as pepper, mustard, and horseradish that make dishes more spicy, a dish of dahi or raita has a cooling effect to contrast with spicy curries and kebabs that are the main fare of some Asian cuisines. In Indian cuisine, some type of flatbread may be eaten together with raita, chutneys, and pickles.

The yogurt may be seasoned with coriander, roasted cumin seeds, mint, cayenne pepper, chaat masala and other herbs and spices.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;raita&quot; first appeared in print around the 19th century; it comes from the Hindi language. The word &quot;raita&quot; in Bengali and Hindi is a portmanteau of the Sanskrit word &quot;rajika&quot; or the derivative Hindi &quot;rai&quot; (pronounced &quot;ra-ee&quot;) meaning black mustard seed, and &quot;tiktaka&quot;, meaning sharp or pungent. 

In South India, especially Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, traditional raita is called &quot;pachadi&quot;, In Telugu it is referred to as Perugu pachadi, and Tayir pachadi in Tamil.

In Eastern Nepal, the dish is known as &quot;dahi kakro&quot; (), whereas in western regions of Nepal it is known as &quot;raito&quot;.

Raita is also sometimes simply called &quot;dahi&quot;, or &quot;sourmilk&quot;, after its main ingredient, particularly in South African Indian cuisine.

==Preparation==
Cumin (&#x27;) and black mustard (&#x27;) are fried. This tempering is then mixed with minced, raw vegetables or fruits (such as Cucumber, Onion, Carrot, Beetroot, Tomato, Pineapple, Pomegranate) and yogurt.

Raw ginger and garlic paste, green chili paste, and sometimes mustard paste are used to enrich flavour.

Raita is usually served chilled. It is used to cool the palate when eating spicy Indian dishes.

==Variants==
Raitas can be prepared with three main base ingredients: vegetables, pulses and fruits. These are mixed with yogurt and flavoured with a variety of seasonings to make different types of raita.

===Vegetable raitas===

# Bathua ka raita, popular in Haryana in winters
# Cucumber raita
# Lauki (bottle gourd/calabash) raita, popular in Haryana and Uttar Pradesh

# Horned melon raita
# Mint and peanut raita
# Onion coriander spring onion raita

<text>Samad Behrangi (; June 24, 1939 – August 31, 1968) was a Marxist-Leninist Iranian teacher, social activist and critic, folklorist, translator, and short story writer of Iranian Azerbaijani descent. He is famous for his children&#x27;s books, particularly &quot;The Little Black Fish&quot;. Influenced by predominantly leftist and communist ideologies that were common among the intelligentsia of his era‌, which made him popular among the Organization of Iranian People&#x27;s Fedai Guerrillas (an Iranian communist organization), his books typically portrayed the lives of the children of the urban poor and encouraged the individual to change his/her circumstances by her own initiatives.

==Early life==
He was born on June 24, 1939, in the neighborhood of Charandab in the city of Tabriz, Imperial State of Iran. He was from a working-class family, his parents were Sara and Ezzat, and he had two brothers and three sisters. His father was a seasonal worker and his income was never sufficient. His father eventually left Iran like millions of other workers on the move for better life conditions for the Caucasus and never returned.

He finished elementary school and three years of secondary school in Tabriz, before enrolling in a rural teacher training school. He spent two years at the Daneshsarayea-Keshavarzi and finished the program in 1957; thus, only receiving few years of education. At the age of 18, he became a teacher, and continued to be so for the rest of his life, in the East Azerbaijan Province of Iran.

== Career ==
In the next eleven years, while teaching Persian in rural schools of Iranian Azerbaijan, he attained a B.A. degree in English from Tabriz University. He started publishing stories in 1960, his first being &quot;Adat&quot; (English: &quot;Habit&quot;). He carried on writing stories, along translating from English and Azerbaijani to Farsi, and vice versa. Later, he was dismissed from his high school teaching position, due to a claim that he was impolite, and assigned to an elementary school. Then, as his cultural works increased, he was accused and persecuted, and suspended from teaching. After a while his sentence was called off and he returned to schools. Later, he attended student protests.

==Publications==
Apart from children&#x27;s stories, he wrote many pedagogical essays and collected and published several samples of oral Azerbaijani literature. His folklore studies have usually been done with the help of his colleague Behrooz Dehghani, who helped publish some of Behrangi&#x27;s works after his early death. Behrangi also has a few Azerbaijani language translations of Persian poems by Ahmad Shamlou, Forough Farrokhzad, and Mehdi Akhavan-Sales.

==Death==

Behrangi drowned on August 31, 1968, in the Aras river and his death was blamed on the Pahlavi government. It is believed that an army officer, Hamzeh Farahati, was seen with him when he drowned. Farahati in his book and in an interview with VOA has unequivocally denied the claims he and SAVAK murdered him. Ironically in his seminal work &quot;the Little Black Fish&quot;, the fishes drown a snail for not knowing his place.

He was buried in the Imamieh cemetery (or Emamiyyeh cemetery; Farsi:قبرستان امامیه) in the Imamieh neighborhood of Tabriz.

<doc id="1034480" wikidata="Q7147003" url="?curid=1034480" title="Patrick Lenihan">
<text>Patrick James Lenihan (4 September 1902 – 11 March 1970) was an Irish Fianna Fáil politician who served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Longford–Westmeath constituency from 1965 to 1970.

He held the distinction of being the only parent to be elected to the Oireachtas when his child was already a member.

==Early life==
He was born 4 September 1902 in Ennistymon, County Clare, son of Patrick Lenihan, a teacher, and Hannah Lenihan (née McIherney). He was educated at Garbally College, Ballinasloe, and University College Galway, he graduated a year late because of his involvement with the IRA during the Irish War of Independence. Following graduation he taught at Christian Brothers&#x27; schools in Belfast for two years.

He was an Inspector of Taxes in Dundalk, County Louth, before being appointed by Seán Lemass to run the Gentex textiles company in Athlone. At its height it was the major employer in the Midlands. He also was involved for some years in the Hodson Bay Hotel on Lough Ree, and was instrumental in the establishment of the All-Ireland amateur drama festival. In the 1930s, he served on the executive committee of the Irish Social Credit Party, fellow members of which included Maud Gonne.

He also had some success as a hurler with Westmeath during the 1930s. He won a Leinster Junior Hurling Championship and an All-Ireland Junior Hurling Championship in 1936. The following year he played in (to date) Westmeath&#x27;s only Leinster Senior Hurling Championship final, in which they lost out to Kilkenny.

==Politics==
He was elected as a Fianna Fáil TD at his first attempt, for the Longford–Westmeath constituency at the 1965 general election. He beat the long-serving Fine Gael TD Seán Mac Eoin in the famous &quot;long count&quot;, by thirteen votes. His son Brian Lenihan had been elected in the neighbouring constituency of Roscommon in 1961, at the previous election. It was the first, and to date only, occasion of a child preceding his parent into the Dáil. Patrick Lenihan was re-elected to the Dáil at the 1969 general election and died suddenly in 1970. His seat was taken at the subsequent by-election by Fine Gael&#x27;s Patrick Cooney who subsequently went on to serve as a Minister.

Two of his children, Brian Lenihan Snr and Mary O&#x27;Rourke, served as Irish cabinet ministers. A third, Paddy, served as a member of Roscommon County Council; in the later stages of his career in the 1980s, he left Fianna Fáil to join Neil Blaney&#x27;s Independent Fianna Fáil. Two of Patrick Lenihan&#x27;s grandchildren, Brian Lenihan Jnr and Conor Lenihan, served as Minister for Finance and Minister of State respectively in the government of Brian Cowen. Conor Lenihan and Mary O&#x27;Rourke lost their seats at the 2011 general election. Brian Lenihan Jnr was re-elected but died in June 2011, ending the Lenihans&#x27; fifty years of continuous service in the Oireachtas.

Patrick Lenihan was the only member of his family to serve in the Dáil who was not appointed a Minister at some stage in his career.

<doc id="1034487" wikidata="Q823093" url="?curid=1034487" title="Oshawa Generals">
<text>The Oshawa Generals are a junior ice hockey team in the Ontario Hockey League. They are based in Oshawa, Ontario, Canada. The team is named for General Motors, an early sponsor which has its Canadian headquarters in Oshawa. In November 2016, the General Motors Centre changed its name to Tribute Communities Centre. Its 184 graduates to the National Hockey League are second in the OHL. The Generals have won the Memorial Cup five times - (1939, 1940, 1944, 1990, 2015), as well as a record thirteen Ontario Hockey League Championships, the J. Ross Robertson Cup - (1938, 1939, 1940, 1941, 1942, 1943, 1944, 1966, 1983, 1987, 1990, 1997, 2015)

The Generals have two distinct eras in their history. The original Generals operated from 1937 to 1953. The team went on a hiatus from 1953 to 1962 due to a fire at the Hambly Arena. The team was resurrected in 1962. Famous alumni of the Generals include Hockey Hall of Famers Bobby Orr, Ted Lindsay, Alex Delvecchio, Dave Andreychuk, and Eric Lindros.

==History==

===Early years (1908–1937)===
Prior to 1908, Oshawa belonged to the Midland Hockey League. It competed against other teams from Whitby, Bowmanville, Port Hope and Cobourg. The first Oshawa team in the Ontario Hockey Association junior division began play in the 1908–1909 season, known as the Oshawa Shamrocks. Ed Bradley, a prominent local businessman was responsible for organizing the team and bringing junior hockey to Oshawa and was the team&#x27;s manager for the next 13 seasons.

Success came early to the team reaching the semifinals in 1909. In the 1920s, the team enjoyed many successful years, battling against Orillia and Owen Sound. In June 1928, Bradley&#x27;s Arena burnt to the ground. The team relocated to Whitby until the new Oshawa Arena was built for 1930.

In the early 1930s, the team became known as the Oshawa Majors. The Majors won the OHA title in 1935 versus the Kitchener Greenshirts, and played the Northern Ontario champion Sudbury Cub Wolves. In a protest by Kitchener, the title was taken away from Oshawa while games were already underway with Sudbury.

In 1936, different sources name the team as the Majors, the Red Devils, and the Junior G-Men. This team coached by Bill Hancock and managed by Matt Leyden played the season against St. Michael&#x27;s College, University of Toronto, Toronto Young Rangers, Toronto Marlboros, Toronto Native Sons and the Toronto Lions.

===OHA dynasty (1937–1944)===
In 1937, the Oshawa Generals were created and named after the sponsor, General Motors of Canada. The Generals put together an unequalled feat of seven consecutive OHA Championships, and winning three Memorial Cups in the same span.

The Generals grew a reputation for treating its players well and signed many young men who would go on to National Hockey League fame. Players were admitted free to theatres, dancing, wrestling, roller skating and other attractions at the arena. Sponsors gave full scholarships to school and weekly stipends. Through the whole dynasty, the team was managed by Matt Leyden, and its secretary was Neil Hezzlewood. Both men would be inducted in the Oshawa Sports Hall of fame.

From 1937 to 1944, Oshawa Generals graduated 20 players to become NHL alumni, and another player in David Bauer, who would be inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in the Builder&#x27;s Category. NHL alumni from 1937 to 1944 include; Frank Bennett, Harvey Bennett, Les Colvin, Jim Conacher, Floyd Curry, Buck Davies, Bob Dawes, Jim Drummond, Frank Eddolls, Bill Ezinicki, Armand (Bep) Guidolin, Nick Knott, Ted Lindsay, Jud McAtee, Norm McAtee, Gus Mortson, Chuck Scherza, Ken Smith, Billy &quot;The Kid&quot; Taylor and Wally Wilson.

===Fire (1953)===

On September 14, 1953 Hambly&#x27;s Arena burned down. The city lost their arena, and their OHA team. 
Donations poured in from many fellow OHA teams and local businessmen. Equipment and other items were disbursed to all the players attending the training camp to cover individual losses. The Generals, homeless so close to the start of the new season, were disbanded.

Salvaged from the disbanded team, General Manager Wren Blair made a Senior B team known as the Oshawa Truckmen, who played in Bowmanville for the 1953–1954 season. The year after, this team became the Whitby Dunlops. The Dunlops were Allan Cup Champions in 1957 &amp; 1959, and World Champions in 1958.

===Rebirth of the Generals (1962)===
In 1960, Wren Blair began negotiations with Boston Bruins president Weston Adams to begin building the new Oshawa Generals. The agreement was made contingent on a new arena being built in Oshawa. The Oshawa Civic Auditorium would open in 1964.

In the meantime, the Oshawa Generals were reactivated for the 1962–1963 as a team playing in the Metro Junior A League. For this year, the team played its home games at Maple Leaf Gardens. Fundraising for a new arena was well under way at the same time.

The Generals wore red, white and blue jerseys until the 1965–66 season when they adopted the black, gold and white of their parent team, the Boston Bruins.

In 1963 the Metro Junior A league was disbanded, and Oshawa was readmitted in the OHA. Since the Toronto Marlboros used Maple Leaf Gardens as a home rink, the Generals team played out of nearby Bowmanville for one full season, and part of another.

===The Bobby Orr years (1962–1966)===
The greatest player ever to wear an Oshawa Generals uniform, Bobby Orr, became a legend in the NHL and to be inducted in the Hockey Hall of Fame.

Orr was discovered by Wren Blair as a 14-year-old while playing a game in Gananoque, Ontario. He was quickly signed to a contract and invited to training camp for the 1962–63 season. He would commute three hours from Parry Sound for all weekend games he played with the Generals that year. Even so, he was selected to the Metro Junior A League&#x27;s second all-star team.

During the 1963–64 season (his first full season in Junior A hockey), Bobby Orr scored 29 goals to break the record for most goals by a defenceman, previously held by Jacques Laperriere. Orr was also selected as a first team all-star defenceman.

During the 1964–65 season, the Generals moved into their new home at the Oshawa Civic Auditorium. Orr broke his own record, scoring 34 goals that season.

In the 1965–66 season, Oshawa returned to the Memorial Cup after a 22-year absence. The Generals were coached that year by alumnus Armand &quot;Bep&quot; Guidolin, who played for Oshawa in the 1942 Memorial Cup, and subsequently made the Boston Bruins of the National Hockey League (NHL) as a 16-year-old. Team captain Bobby Orr scored 38 goals during the season.

The Generals defeated their bitter rivals, the St. Catharines Black Hawks, in the quarter-finals before eliminating the Montreal Junior Canadiens in the semi-finals, and winning the J. Ross Robertson Cup over the Kitchener Rangers.

The Generals then outscored the Northern Ontario Junior A champion North Bay Trappers by a combined score of 43–9 to win the series in four games, and then defeated Shawinigan Bruins in three games to be the Eastern Canadian representative for the Memorial Cup.

In the Memorial Cup series, Orr played injured through most games, but the team lost to the Edmonton Oil Kings in six games.

After the season ended, many players graduated from the team and moved on: Orr went to the Bruins, Blair became general manager of the NHL&#x27;s Minnesota North Stars and head coach Guidolin returned to coaching in Thorold.

===Ninth championship (1983)===
After many dismal seasons through the late 1960s and 1970s, the Generals began to rebuild for a run at the Memorial Cup. In 1979, the Generals hired Head Coach Paul Theriault, who would lead the team to nine consecutive winning seasons, including two Memorial Cup appearances.

In 1983, the Generals returned to the Memorial Cup after a 17-year absence, defeating the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds for their ninth J. Ross Robertson Cup. The Memorial Cup that year was played in Portland, Oregon. The Generals lost in the finals to the host team, the Portland Winter Hawks, by a score of 8–3. That year&#x27;s team captain, defenceman Joe Cirella, went on to play 16 years in the NHL.

===Tragedy (1985)===
During an early season practice, Bruce Melanson left the ice feeling very weak. Within a few minutes he collapsed, succumbing to a congenital heart disorder known as Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome. He was 18 years old at the time. The Generals wore black arm bands for the remainder of the season in memoriam of their teammate they nicknamed &quot;Moose.&quot; In his honour, his number 9 was never worn by another member of the Generals and was later retired in 2006 for the late Red Tilson. A memorial scholarship was also set up at his former high school in New Brunswick. The Generals now hand out an award to the most scholarly student, named the Bruce Melanson Scholactic Player of the Year Award. Melanson&#x27;s hard-hitting and aggressive style led him to be selected by New York Islanders in the second round, 41st overall, in the 1984 NHL Entry Draft.

===Hosting the Memorial Cup (1987)===
In the 1986–87 season the Generals set a team record with 101 points for the season. The Generals played on home ice in the Memorial Cup, as the host city and as the OHL champions.

In 1987, the OHL organized a &quot;super series&quot; for the right to host the Memorial Cup tournament between the Leyden Division-winning Generals and the Emms Division-winning North Bay Centennials. The super series was played before the OHL playoffs commenced, and Oshawa defeated North Bay four games to three for the right to host the Memorial Cup. Coincidentally, Oshawa also won the OHL championship series defeating North Bay four games to three. Since Oshawa won both the super series and the OHL championship, only three teams participated in the Memorial Cup. Oshawa reached the finals against the Medicine Hat Tigers, but lost 6–2 in the championship game.

===Eric Lindros and a fourth Memorial Cup (1989–1991)===
Eric Lindros was drafted by the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds, but refused to play for them, forcing the Greyhounds to trade him. After arriving in Oshawa, Lindros turned out to be the player the Generals needed to reach the Memorial Cup, in addition to the existing core of players captained by Iain Fraser.

After playing for the Canadian National Team, Lindros started his rookie year with the Generals in 1989–90. Lindros would go on to score 17 goals and 19 assists in only 25 games. The same year in the playoffs, he scored 18 goals and 18 assists in only 17 games.

Copps Coliseum hosted the 1990 Memorial Cup. The Generals played against the Kamloops Blazers, Laval Titan and the OHL runners-up, the Kitchener Rangers. The championship game on May 13, 1990, attracted 17,383 spectators who eventually witnessed the Generals defeat the Rangers 4–3 in double overtime on a goal scored by Bill Armstrong. This was the fourth Memorial Cup in Generals history.

In the subsequent off-season, Lindros was chosen first overall at the 1991 NHL Entry Draft by the Quebec Nordiques. Entering the 1990–91 season, the Generals were expected to repeat as OHL champions. In 57 regular season games, Lindros again led the team in points after scoring 71 goals and 78 assists. The Generals, however, lost the OHL final that year to Lindros&#x27; draft team, the Sault Ste. Marie.

===Twelfth OHL Championship (1997)===
The Generals set the benchmark for other OHL teams by winning their 12th J. Ross Robertson Cup in 1997.

The Generals upset the first place Ottawa 67&#x27;s in the OHL final, 4–2. The sixth game ended just eight seconds into the first overtime on a goal from Marc Savard.

The Generals then participated in the 1997 Memorial Cup in Hull, Quebec, in which they finished third in the round robin and lost in the semifinal to the Lethbridge Hurricanes in overtime.

Future NHL players from Oshawa&#x27;s 1997 roster included Marc Savard, John Tripp, Ian MacNeil, Kevin Colley, Dan Hinote, Jeff Ware, Bryan Allen, Jeff MacMillan and Tyrone Garner.

===New ownership, new home (2004 to present)===
In 2004, John Davies purchased the team from John Humphreys. This marked the beginning of a new era for the team, as the Humphreys family had owned the team since its resurrection in 1962.

In 2005, the Generals drafted 14-year-old John Tavares first overall in the OHL Priority Selection; he was previously granted Exceptional Player Status by the OHL, which allowing him to be drafted one year earlier than the norm. Following his selection, the Generals worked to build another championship team centered around Tavares. Other building blocks added to the team included Michael Del Zotto, Dale Mitchell, Cal Clutterbuck, Brett MacLean (then one of the youngest players in the OHL), goaltender Anthony Peters and eventually Calvin de Haan.

The new ownership also brought to an end the Generals era playing in the Civic Auditorium. Led by Oshawa Mayor John Gray, the Generals were able to call a new arena in downtown Oshawa their home. The team moved into the General Motors Centre on November 1, 2006, and played the inaugural game on November 3 against the Owen Sound Attack.

After topping scoring boards and points lists with the Generals for three and a half seasons, John Tavares and Michael Del Zotto were traded to the London Knights on January 8, 2009, and a new crop of young talent was brought onto the Generals team. Christian Thomas, Scott Valentine and Michael Zador, along with several draft picks, were part of the Tavares deal. Other additions included Tony DeHart and Lucas Lessio, a result of one of London&#x27;s draft picks that was traded to Oshawa.

In July 2008, the Generals&#x27; executive team announced a change of ownership structure, with Rocco Tullio of Windsor, Ontario, agreeing to terms and conditions with John Davies to acquire his remaining shares of the Generals. In January 2010, Tullio welcomed two new partners as owners – former NHL star and Stanley Cup champion Adam Graves and former championship OHL coach and manager Peter DeBoer.

===2015: Return to the Memorial Cup===
For the first time since 1997, the Oshawa Generals made it back to the Memorial Cup in 2015. In the 2014–15 season, the Generals won their 13th J. Ross Robertson Cup, defeating the Erie Otters. At the 2015 Memorial Cup, they won all three of their round robin games and clinched a spot in the tournament final. They defeated the Kelowna Rockets in the final after Anthony Cirelli scored the game-winning goal in overtime.

==Championships==
The Generals have won 13 J. Ross Robertson Cup championships, the most in OHL history. Oshawa also has won five Memorial Cup championships.

==Season-by-season results==
The Oshawa Generals have won three Hamilton Spectator trophies for finishing first overall in the OHL regular season standings, and five Leyden trophies for finishing first overall in the eastern division OHL regular season standings. The Oshawa Generals have won 13 J. Ross Robertson Cups as the OHL/OHA playoff champions, and won five Memorial Cups as the CHL/CAHA champions.

==Uniforms and logos==
The current version of the Oshawa Generals uniforms has been in use since the 1989–90 season. The team has announced an updated logo to coincide with moving into a new arena. The new logo cresting will be triple layered as opposed to the single layer. Players&#x27; names and numbers with have double cresting.

The Oshawa Generals have also issued two throwback style jerseys in the recent past. During alumni week for the 2001–02 season, the Generals wore a jersey based on the &#x27;Bruins&quot; style worn in the 1965–66 season, when Bobby Orr skated for the club. For two seasons from 2004–05 to 2005–06 the Generals &quot;red&quot; jersey was replaced by a jersey based on the style worn during the 1939, 1940 and 1944 Memorial Cup winning seasons, featuring the square &quot;GM&quot; logo.

The Generals unveiled a new mascot during a pregame ceremony on November 16, 2007, who would be named &quot;Deke&quot; in a naming contest in Oshawa. The previous mascot, &quot;General Shooter,&quot; had been retired at the end of the 2006–07 season.

==Arenas==
The Oshawa Generals have the dubious distinction of having their home arena destroyed by fire not once, but twice in the franchise history. In June 1928 the Bradley Arena was destroyed by fire. Then 25 years later, the Hambly Arena was also destroyed by fire.

From 1928 to 1930, the team played out of nearby Whitby until the Hambly Arena was constructed. When the Hambly Arena burned down in 1953, the Oshawa Generals were disbanded. When the team was resurrected in 1962, they played both at Maple Leaf Gardens and also in the Bowmanville Community Arena (now demolished) for two seasons until moving until the Civic Auditorium.

===The early years===
Before Oshawa joined the OHA in 1908, it was part of the Midland Hockey League. Its games were played out of the Oshawa Curling Club located by the Oshawa Creek in the vicinity of present-day Valleyview Gardens, Kinsmen Stadium and Children&#x27;s Arena. Since the curling club controlled its use and thus when games could or could not be played, a new location was sought.

A new outdoor rink was built four blocks away, where the present day Oshawa Armouries stand at the corner of Simcoe St. and Richmond St. This would be the team&#x27;s home until 1908.

===Bradley Arena 1908–1928===
The Bradley Arena, nicknamed &quot;The Big Rink,&quot; opened up in 1908 on Duke St. in downtown Oshawa. Its namesake was Ed Bradley, a prominent local businessman who was responsible for organizing the team and bringing Junior Hockey to Oshawa.

The arena was packed to the rafters many nights when Oshawa played there for the 1920s League championships versus Orillia and Owen Sound. In June 1928, the predominantly wooden structure succumbed to an overnight fire.

===Hambly Arena 1930–1953===
The Oshawa Arena (later known as the Hambly Arena) opened in 1930 and was built in large part to the contributions of Colonel Robert Samuel McLaughlin. It was the first brick facade and steel support structure for hockey in Oshawa. Shortly after training camp in 1953, the arena would suffer the same demise as its predecessor and burned to the ground on September 15.

===Civic Auditorium 1964–2006===
The Oshawa Civic Auditorium opened in 1964, built on fundraising by citizens of Oshawa. The first scheduled OHA game was December 15, 1964 vs. the St. Catharines Black Hawks. The Generals prevailed by a score of 6 to 4 in front of 4,109 fans attending the game.

In 1987 the Civic Auditorium played host to the Memorial Cup. The Generals contested for the cup against the Medicine Hat Tigers and the Longueuil Chévaliers.

The last championship the Generals won was played at the Civic in May 1997. The Generals upset the 1st place Ottawa 67&#x27;s in the OHL final, 4 games to 2. The sixth game ended 8 seconds into the first overtime on a goal from Marc Savard.

The Generals played the first five home games of the 2006–07 season in the Civic Auditorium before moving into their new arena. The final game played was October 29, 2006, against the Kingston Frontenacs, the Generals won 8–6.

===Downtown arena 2006–present===
On March 10, 2005, Oshawa City Council approved what was then known as the &quot;Downtown Sports &amp; Entertainment Facility Project&quot; after many years of waiting for a new arena. Groundbreaking for the new facility at the corner of Athol and Mary Streets in downtown Oshawa took place on June 22, 2005. The building is operated by Global Spectrum Facility Management.

On October 5, 2006, the Oshawa Generals announced a naming rights deal which will see the arena named the General Motors Centre. The inaugural game was played November 3, 2006, against the Owen Sound Attack.

On May 15, 2015, the Generals won their 13th J. Ross Robertson Cup at the General Motors Centre, defeating the Erie Otters 4–1.

On November 1, 2016, the General Motors Centre was renamed to the Tribute Communities Centre.

<text>USS &quot;Lynx&quot; (AK-100) was a commissioned by the US Navy for service in World War II. &quot;Lynx&quot; was the third US Navy vessel to bear the name, but unlike previous ships this one was named after the constellation Lynx. She was responsible for delivering troops, goods and equipment to locations in the Asiatic-Pacific Theater.

==Construction==
&quot;Lynx&quot; was laid down 26 April 1943, under a Maritime Commission (MARCOM) contract, MC hull No. 1657, as the Liberty ship SS &quot;Juan Bautista de Anza&quot;, by California Shipbuilding Corporation, Terminal Island, Los Angeles, California; launched 18 May 1943; sponsored by Mrs. E. E. McCarty; renamed &quot;Lynx&quot; 27 May 1943; and commissioned 26 July 1943.

==Service history==
===1943===
After fitting out, Lynx reported on 6 August 1943, to the Commandant, Twelfth Naval district, for assignment to the Naval Transportation Service (NTS), &quot;Lynx&quot; loaded cargo at San Francisco and departed for the western Pacific 28 August 1943, in Convoy PW 2294. Proceeding via Espiritu Santo, in the New Hebrides, the new cargo vessel touched at Auckland, New Zealand, 26 October, and Rarotonga, 2 November, then returned to Espiritu Santo en route back to the west coast of the United States.

Completing an overhaul at the Hurley Marine Works, Oakland, California, on 7 December 1943, &quot;Lynx&quot; shifted to berth no.3, Encinal Terminal, Alameda, California, later the same day, and began loading cargo. After completing that process on 15 December, the ship moved to Pier 54N at San Francisco, taking on board a deck cargo of a Landing Craft Tank (LCT), a Landing Craft Mechanized (LCM), and three Landing Craft Personnel (LCV(P)), vehicle and personnel landing craft, 15–17 December.

&quot;Lynx&quot; cleared San Francisco Bay on 17 December 1943, for towing tests in accordance with the movement orders from Commander Joseph J. Rochefort, the commanding officer of . Subsequently, the cargo ship carried out her assigned evolutions, 18–20 December, towing section A of , escorted by the fleet tug and salvage vessel , dropping anchor in Berth 68, San Francisco Bay, 20 December. She remained there through Christmas of 1943.

===1944===
====Emergency surgery====
On 27 December 1943, &quot;Lynx&quot;, with Section 13 of the advanced base sectional dock in tow astern, sailed as flagship of Task Group (TG) 116.15.3, Commander Arthur S. Walton, in company with sister ships , towing , and , with astern, and , towing , escorted by the fleet tug , set course for the South Pacific. During the afternoon watch on 14 January 1944, &quot;Zuni&quot; left her position in the formation and came alongside, transferring Sea1c Hugh W. Morris, diagnosed with appendicitis, to &quot;Lynx&quot;, for medical treatment. Lieutenant Herman E. Wuestenfeld, MC-V(G), the cargo ship&#x27;s medical officer, performed an appendectomy later that same day, 20:34-21:40.

====Man overboard====
Less than an hour before the end of the forenoon watch, 11:03, on 18 January 1944, Sea2c Maurice L. Bosshart, V-6, USNR, a passenger traveling in Lynx for further transportation to &quot;YRD(M)-1&quot; for duty, fell overboard. Thirty seconds after Bosshart was reported over the side, &quot;Lynx&quot; ran up her “five” flag at the dip and dropped two life rings and a Franklin life buoy within of him. &quot;Zuni&quot; left the formation at 11:04 to conduct a search, while &quot;Lynx&quot; signaled her tow to look for the man and put life rings in the water. Sailors on board section 13 of the advanced base sectional dock &quot;ABSD-1&quot;, however, reported that they had lost sight of him. The following day, 19 January, &quot;Lynx&quot; held a memorial service for Sea2c Bosshart at 09:30.

====New Hebrides====
On 22 January 1944, the submarine chasers and joined as additional escorts, and two days later the destroyer escort joined the convoy as escort commander. The assemblage of ships and yard craft crossed the 180th meridian on 25 January, losing 26 January, in the process. Shortly before the end of the first dog watch on 28 January, at 17:55, &quot;Lynx&quot; embarked Sergeant Claude E. Rudy, USMC, a passenger in the tug &quot;Zuni&quot;, who had been diagnosed with appendicitis. Ultimately, TG 116.15.3 reached its destination, Espiritu Santo, on 1 February, standing in to Pallikula Bay.

Delivering her tow upon arrival, &quot;Lynx&quot; shifted to Segond Channel, Espiritu Santo, 2 February 1944, and transferred Sgt. Rudy and Sea1c Morris, the two recovering appendicitis patients, back to &quot;Zuni&quot;, while the tug returned the cargo ship&#x27;s Franklin life buoy that had been put in the water during the unsuccessful attempt to save Sea2c Bosshart. She also began discharging and unloading cargo over the next few days, 3–4 February. &quot;Lynx&quot; returned to Pallikula Bay on the morning of 5 February, then sailed for Efate, New Hebrides, later the same day, escorted by the district patrol vessel , arriving on 6 February. After discharging cargo at Vila Harbor, Efate, 6–7 February, &quot;Lynx&quot; shifted to Havannah Harbor, Efate, 8 February, where she completed the unloading process, 8–10 February. She set course for Espiritu Santo on 10 February, and anchored upon arrival the following day. After a wait, 11–15 February, for dock space, &quot;Lynx&quot; completed discharging cargo on 21 February, moving away from the pier where she had been moored to return to an anchorage, assisted in the evolution by and harbor tug .

====Towing duty====
Sailing on 23 February 1944, in company with &quot;Fort McHenry&quot;, &quot;Lynx&quot; set course to return to San Francisco, escorted by . With the little convoy dispersed on 24 February, the cargo vessel received instructions to divert her course south of the Fiji Islands the following day. She crossed the International Date Line on 28 February, and ultimately stood in to the naval anchorage at San Francisco on 17 March. She shifted to Pier 18 North the following day to discharge cargo, 18–19 March, then returned to the Encinal Terminal at Alameda, 21–28 March. She loaded cargo at Alameda and at Pier 50B, San Francisco, 29 March–1 April.

Underway on 1 April 1944, &quot;Lynx&quot; steamed to San Pedro, California, 3–4 April. Picking up her tow, the fuel oil barge , &quot;Lynx&quot; sailed for Pearl Harbor on 4 April. Relieved of her tow on 17 April, the cargo ship put into Pearl and moored at berth K-1, Naval Supply Depot, where she began discharging cargo. She shifted to berth V-2 off Pearl City on 19 April, to continue that work, completing it on 22 April, at which point she began to load cargo. Sailing for Hilo, Territory of Hawaii, on 25 April, her holds full, she arrived at her destination on the following day. Discharging cargo there until 28 April, she sailed that day to return to the west coast of the United States.

&quot;Lynx&quot; stood in to San Francisco Bay on 6 May 1944, and anchored. Underway two days later, she moored at Pier 25, San Francisco, on 8 May, where she began a period of minor repairs and alterations in the hands of the General Engineering Co. on 9 May. Shifting to the General Engineering &amp; Drydock Company&#x27;s yard at Alameda, on 16 May, she entered the floating dry dock , where her bottom was scraped and painted and paravane gear installed, 16–19 May. Underway once more on 20 May, &quot;Lynx&quot; fueled at the Point Orient Fuel Dock that same day, then put into Port Chicago to load cargo at the Naval Magazine there 20–28 May. Shifting to Pier 92, San Francisco, on 28 May, she continued to receive minor repairs and alterations through the end of the month, such work being completed on 31 May, when she also completed loading her holds. She completed loading deck cargo, &quot;LCT-1096&quot; and five re-arming boats, on 1 June, then proceeded to the Tiburon anchorage, San Francisco Bay, on 2 June.

Lieutenant Commander William N. Price reported on board &quot;Lynx&quot; on 3 June 1944, as Commander Task Unit 116.15.1, and the ship sailed that day as his flagship, towing Section 10 (“H”) of &quot;ABSD-2&quot;, in company with her old convoy-mate &quot;Sculptor&quot;—towing Section 3 (“I”) of &quot;ABSD-2&quot;; cargo ship – towing Section 21 (“J”) of &quot;ABSD-2&quot;; and the tug &quot;Point Arguello&quot; towing Section 4 (“G”) of &quot;ABSD-2&quot;. The rescue tug , with in tow, rounded out Convoy PW 2411. Two days into the voyage, &quot;ATR-25&quot; transferred her tow to &quot;Point Arguello&quot;, and assumed duty as retriever vessel. Later in the passage, on 23 June, Lt. Cmdr. Price detached &quot;ATR-25&quot; to proceed to Pago Pago, Tutuila, Samoa, “to refuel and transact official business for Task Unit 116.15.1.” Her mission completed, the rescue tug rejoined the convoy on 27 June, then conducted a round trip to Pago Pago. She was detached “to proceed on duty assigned” on 28 June. Convoy PW-2411 continued on its voyage into July, skipping 3 July 1944, as the ships travelled east to west. The tug &quot;Race Point&quot; joined the assemblage on 11 July, as retriever, then left “in accordance with verbal instructions of [the] Convoy Commodore…” on 13 July, returning on 15 July, shortly before the convoy stood in to Seeadler Harbor, Manus.

Underway for New Guinea on 18 July 1944, &quot;Lynx&quot; proceeded with &quot;Sculptor&quot;, convoy commander, &quot;Eridanus&quot;, and the War Shipping Administration (WSA) troopship, Dutch registry, &quot;Kota Inten&quot;, escorted by and . The last-three named ships received orders to proceed independently on 19 July, while the three American cargo ships continued on, arriving at Milne Bay on 21 July. Fueling alongside , 23 July, &quot;Lynx&quot; unloaded her deck cargo, &quot;LCT-1096&quot; and the re-arming boats, on 26 July, then got underway for Queensland, Australia, later the same morning.

Lynx arrived at Brisbane on 31 July 1944, and immediately commenced unloading cargo. Bringing that task to completion on 4 August, and beginning the loading process, the cargo ship sailed for Sydney, New South Wales, on 8 August. Reaching port on 10 August, she discharged the materials brought from Brisbane at Darling Harbour, 10–14 August, Pyrmont, 14–21 August, and Glebe Island, 21 August, then loaded a cargo at the last-named Sydney location 21–25 August, completing that work an hour after the end of the mid watch that day. She sailed for Oahu on 26 August. Reaching Pearl Harbor on 10 September, &quot;Lynx&quot; moored alongside the freighter &quot;John Lind&quot; at berth X-10, and unloaded all cargo earmarked for Pearl the following day between 13:55 and 23:00. She then sailed for the west coast on 12 September.

Bringing another voyage to a close on 20 September 1944, when she dropped anchor in San Francisco Bay, &quot;Lynx&quot; unloaded cargo alongside Pier 18 North, 21–26 September, then steamed to the yard of the Cortola Company&#x27;s, Marine Ways, Inc., Oakland, where she underwent repairs and alterations into the first week of October. Completing her availability at the Cortola yard on 6 October, &quot;Lynx&quot; steamed to Pier 48-B, San Francisco, where she loaded cargo until 14 October. Underway to calibrate her radio direction finder that afternoon, she anchored in San Francisco Bay when that task was done, pausing only until the morning of 16 October, when she sailed for Oahu, &quot;Lynx&quot;, convoy commander, taking departure with in tow and accompanied by .

Letting go her tow shortly before mid day on 28 October 1944, off the entrance to the Pearl Harbor entrance channel, releasing &quot;Lignite&quot; “into the care of pilot and tugs,” &quot;Lynx&quot; directed &quot;YF-450&quot; to proceed independently, then moored at berth K-5 soon thereafter. She unloaded cargo at X-5 until 7 November, at which point she shifted berths to X-11, mooring alongside &quot;Durham Wright&quot; at 09:47, that ship&#x27;s place taken by another freighter, &quot;Joel Palmer&quot;, at 18:12. The following afternoon, 8 November 1944, &quot;Lynx&quot; got underway for San Francisco, taking station in Convoy PS 160T with the convoy commander in the transport , the C1–B troopship &quot;Cape Cleare&quot;, &quot;Gulf Caribbean&quot;, &quot;Permanente&quot;, and &quot;Duala&quot;&#x27;, escorted by the frigate and the minesweeper .

====Japanese submarine attack====
PS-160T&#x27;s voyage proceeded without incident until 12:32 on 13 November 1944, some west-southwest of Los Angeles, Calif., &quot;Ardent&quot;s sonar picked up a submarine contact. The minesweeper attacked, firing a 24-charge “hedgehog” pattern, and followed that up with a second pattern at 12:46. &quot;Rockford&quot; left her escort station to assist, and fired her first barrage of rockets from her “hedgehog” at 13&quot;08. Two explosions followed, before an underwater detonation rocked the ship. While the ships in company took evasive action on signal from the convoy commodore in &quot;U. S. Grant&quot;, &quot;Ardent&quot; carried out two more attacks and the frigate dropped 13 depth charges. Wreckage recovered on the scene—deck planks, ground cork covered with diesel oil, a wooden slat from a vegetable crate with Japanese writing and advertisements on it, pieces of varnished mahogany inscribed in Japanese, and a piece of deck planking containing Japanese builders’ inscriptions—indicated a definite “kill” that the Navy ultimately awarded to &quot;Ardent&quot; and &quot;Rockford&quot; equally.

Postwar research revealed the sunken boat to be , Commander Kudo Kaneo, that had sailed from the Inland Sea on 4 October 1944, to disrupt American shipping between the west coast and the Hawaiian Islands. In sinking &quot;I-12&quot;, &quot;Ardent&quot; and &quot;Rockford&quot; avenged the atrocity &quot;I-12&quot; had committed on 30 October, when, after sinking the freighter &quot;John A. Johnson&quot; with two torpedoes, the submarine had rammed and sunk the lifeboats and rafts and then employed machine guns and pistols on the 70 survivors. Among the ten men slain were five sailors of the merchantman&#x27;s US Navy Armed Guard. There were no survivors from &quot;I-12&quot;s 114 officers and men. 

===End of 1944===
&quot;Lynx&quot; relieved &quot;U. S. Grant&quot; as convoy commander, in accordance with orders from Commander, Western Sea Frontier, on 15 November 1944, and the following day the venerable transport and &quot;Gulf Caribbean&quot; proceeded independently. Putting into San Francisco two days later, 17 November, the ship unloaded cargo over ensuing days, completing the evolutions on 21 November, when she shifted from the familiar confines of Pier 18 North to the Naval Supply Depot, tying up at Berth B and beginning the loading process immediately thereafter on 21 November. Tugs shifted &quot;Lynx&quot;s berth to Berth C on the following day and she continued the loading there, a process she carried on into the first week of December. &quot;LCT-1355&quot; was loaded on board as deck cargo on 2 December, and &quot;Lynx&quot; moved out to the naval anchorage the next day, where she secured a towing cable to . The ship then sailed for Oahu at 13:20.

Arriving off Pearl Harbor on 12 December 1944, &quot;Lynx&quot; cast &quot;YF-746&quot; loose then proceeded to berth X-8, mooring alongside , that got underway from there on 14 December, permitting the unloading of the tank landing craft that &quot;Lynx&quot; had brought from the west coast. Shifting to berth X-22 on 16 December, then to B-12 three days before Christmas, &quot;Lynx&quot; loaded four motor torpedo boats (PT) from Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron 17 on 22 December: , , , and . After a brief period moored alongside the freighter &quot;Edwin M. Stanton&quot; at X-10, 23–25 December, &quot;Lynx&quot; then sailed for the Admiralty Islands on 27 December, two days after Christmas.

===1945===
Again losing a day, 3 January 1945, by virtue of the passage westward, &quot;Lynx&quot; stood in to Seeadler Harbor during the first dog watch on 11 January, anchoring in Berth 24. Once there she took on board a cargo of mail between 12:35 and 13:00 on 14 January, then sailed for Dutch New Guinea a little over five hours later. She discharged her cargo of mail at Humboldt Bay, 16:00-16:31 on 16 January, and remained anchored there until shifting berths on 25 January, prior to her sailing in convoy for the Philippines later that same day.

With the convoy commodore riding in &quot;Lynx&quot; and the vice-commodore in the auxiliary tug , the assembly of ships proceeded on their voyage with and and carrying out anti-submarine patrolling on the starboard and port flanks, and ahead, respectively. One day out, &quot;Lynx&quot; took a crash boat in tow astern of , 26 January 1945, and on 27 January, the old tug (ex-minesweeper) reported boiler trouble beyond the scope of underway repair, so she was detached to proceed independently to Mios Woendi. Detached two hours into the mid watch on 28 January, &quot;PC-1134&quot; proceeded ahead to rendezvous with additional ships slated to join the convoy off Biak. The submarine chaser returned, shepherding her new charges, that afternoon, and after towing assignments with the new arrivals had been taken-up, the convoy resumed its slow speed of advance, , at 23:38, bound for the Philippine Islands.

Reaching San Pedro Bay, Leyte, half-way through the morning watch on 5 February 1945, the convoy dispersed shortly after its arrival, &quot;Lynx&quot; turning over &quot;YO-164&quot; to the rescue tugs and before dropping anchor in berth 91. The following morning, 6 February, &quot;Lynx&quot; got underway and moored alongside the motor torpedo boat tender in berth 215 and discharged &quot;PT-226&quot; and &quot;PT-229&quot;. Then, after spending the night at anchor in berth 214, again came alongside &quot;Cyrene&quot; at 08:30 on 7 February. The cargo ship discharged &quot;PT-232&quot; and &quot;PT-225&quot; at that time, then proceeded back to berth 214 and dropped anchor there.

Steaming thence to Guiuan Harbor, Samar, &quot;Lynx&quot; discharged cargo there, 11 February–9 March 1945, before returning to San Pedro Bay on 10 March. She got underway at 08:00 on 13 March, in accordance with orders from the Port Director at Tolosa Beach, Leyte, to rendezvous with Convoy IG 103, thence to proceed to Hollandia. Almost three hours into her voyage, however, &quot;Lynx&quot; received a dispatch from Commander Task Force 75, in accordance with which she reversed course and returned to San Pedro Bay, dropping anchor in berth 484, upon arrival.

&quot;Lynx&quot; shifted her anchorage within the confines of San Pedro Bay on 15 March 1945, and remained in berth 31 for almost a fortnight, accomplishing “urgent machinery repairs.” After fueling from the station tanker , 28 March, and taking on fresh water from the distilling ship , 29 March, she proceeded to Dulag, Leyte, on 31 March. &quot;Lynx&quot; soon began loading cargo, an evolution she continued into the second week of April, after which time she shifted berths, 6 April, and embarked the US Army’s 866th Anti-Aircraft Battery headquarters unit and its equipment, 7 April, for transportation to Okinawa. &quot;Lynx&quot; then sailed for the Western Carolines, escorted by the destroyer in TU 75.2.19.

Dropping anchor at Ulithi on 13 April 1945, &quot;Lynx&quot; fueled from the following morning, 14 April, then took on stores and accomplished minor repairs, 15–19 April, before getting underway in Ulithi-Okinawa Convoy UOK 2 on 20 April, the vice-commodore riding in the ship, and the commodore in , accompanied by refrigerated store ship , cargo ships , and , net-laying ship , flotilla flagships and , the tank landing craft &quot;LCT-708&quot;, large support landing craft , degaussing vessel and five freighters, escorted by , and high speed transport , Captain Glenn R. Hartwig in tactical command, in .

====Another submarine scare====
A quarter of an hour into the second dog watch on 24 April 1945, &quot;Ralph Talbot&quot; left the convoy to investigate a submarine contact. Three hours into the mid watch on 25 April, the convoy received a Commander Task Force 51 secret dispatch “warning of submarine activity in our immediate vicinity.” Ordered to divert from their present course and “to proceed via new reference points” to their destination, UOK 2 did so. &quot;Ralph Talbot&quot; rejoined the assemblage at the start of the second dog watch later that day. The warning may have been related to the activities of the Japanese submarine &quot;RO-109&quot;, Lt. Nakagawa Hiroshi, which was sunk with all hands, 56 dead all told, by the high speed transport , that was escorting another Okinawa-bound convoy, after three attacks during the second dog watch on 25 April.

====Okinawa====
=====Enemy plane threats=====
UOK 2 arrived off Okinawa at 11:25 on 26 April 1945. With the dissolution of the convoy, the ships proceeded independently, &quot;Lynx&quot; anchoring in berth 140. She soon began discharging cargo into lighters alongside, a task interrupted by a Flash Red at 02:20 on 27 April. The vessel went to general quarters and began making smoke, but although enemy planes were nearby, she sighted none. With the raid over in about a quarter of an hour, the ship resumed unloading. Later that day, however, at 20:40, a Flash Red sent &quot;Lynx&quot;s men back to general quarters for the second time that day. Ships in the vicinity, as well as shore defenses, shot down an aircraft identified as a Betty (twin-engine, land-based bomber), splashing it about on &quot;Lynx&quot;s port beam.

&quot;Lynx&quot; stayed at battle stations, with Japanese planes reported overhead and “suicide boats at large in the anchorage,” through the mid watch on 28 April 1945, her sailors noting “considerable rifle fire from nearby ships...presumed to be shots fired at possible suicide [assault demolition] boats.” With receipt of a Flash White at 04:16, the ship secured from general quarters and ceased making smoke, the continued discharging cargo into lighters alongside. Two more Flash Reds occurred during the day, 16:05–16:46 and beginning at 19:32, with a /50 caliber shell, identified afterwards by the fuse setting ring found on deck, exploding near &quot;Lynx&quot;s port beam at 21:40 “throwing shrapnel about the decks and causing a slight facial injury to one man.”

Again, &quot;Lynx&quot; remained at general quarters into another mid watch. Securing from battle stations at 02:25 on 29 April 1945, after receiving a Flash White, the ship stood to general quarters three more times that day, 04:29–05:10, 07:51–08:03 and 21:05–23:58, continuing the unloading process in between the first two alarums, 05:10-07:51. She received Flash Red alerts twice during the mid and morning watches on 30 April, 00:45–01:22, and 02:00–05:58, discharging cargo to lighters alongside as before after the latter. A third Flash Red occurred during the first watch, 22:12–23:20.

At month&#x27;s end, Lt. Cmdr. Berrey reported that winds of “force 2 to 3 or greater, decidedly reduced the effectiveness of the smoke screen” laid in the anchorage. &quot;Lynx&quot;s smoke boat—a rebuilt LCV(P) “reclaimed from a boat pool scrap heap”—managed to cover large holes in the screen, but only “with difficulty.” He also noted that “attempts to guide the smoke boats on their patrol...were made by ringing the ship’s bell, and later by using a fog horn on the bow,” but similar measures by other ships in the area rendered both expedients “more or less unsatisfactory.” Additionally, “rifle fire from various ships in the harbor, during smoke screening, aimed at supposed Japanese suicide boats, frequently endangered our smoke boats.”

&quot;Lynx&quot; went to general quarters upon receipt of a Flash Red at the end the mid watch on 1 May 1945, and began making smoke. With a Flash White at 04:41, the ship secured her smoke-making, stood down from battle stations, and soon resumed the unloading process. Later that morning, she transferred 400 rounds of ammunition to the Landing Ship Medium , and that afternoon provided diesel fuel to the tank landing craft &quot;LCT-1237&quot;. Completing her unloading during the mid watch, 01:42, on 2 May, &quot;Lynx&quot; disembarked the soldiers of the 866th AA Battalion at 08:00.

Shifting her berth the following morning, 3 May 1945, &quot;Lynx&quot; provided 40-millimeter ammunition to the Landing Ship Medium (Rocket) an hour before the end of the forenoon watch. Intensifying Japanese aerial activity midway through the second dog watch on 3 May, prompted a Flash Red at 19:05, with enemy planes active not only over the anchorage but over Yontan Airfield as well. The interlude lasted less than an hour, with a Flash White being sent at 20:01.

=====Suicide boat threats=====
The threat posed by the Japanese assault demolition boats proved very real. Early in the mid watch on 4 May 1945, one of the ships in Lynx&#x27;s task unit, her sister ship &quot;Carina&quot;, was hit by a suicide boat. A Flash Red at 02:04 sent ships in the vicinity back to general quarters and making smoke, evolutions ended with a Flash White at 04:52. Underway at 07:41 to rendezvous with Ulithi-bound Convoy OKU 3, &quot;Lynx&quot; went to general quarters upon receipt of a Flash Red ten minutes into her voyage, 07:51, remaining at battle stations through her rendezvous with the convoy one hour later. Standing down from general quarters at 09:24, the cargo ship took departure from Okinawa at 09:35. Another Flash Red, however, came through within a quarter of an hour, with &quot;Lynx&quot; noting shipping under attack and antiaircraft fire shooting down several planes. OKU-3 escaped unscathed and proceeded on its voyage unmolested, reaching Ulithi at mid-day on 9 May.

====Tow duty====
After taking on fresh water from and fuel from tanker on 11 May 1945, &quot;Lynx&quot; sailed for the west coast of the United States the following morning. The passage proved uneventful until 27 May, when the ship steamed past Oahu. “While proceeding on [the] routing prescribed in [the] basis sailing directions,” Lt. Cmdr. Berrey wrote later, “several radical course changes were made to give bombing target towing vessels a wide berth. Both vessels were operating well outside of the restricted zone, which is provided for such operations, at Kaneohe Bay, but both showed an utter disregard for the rules of the road and safety at sea, by apparent unnecessary re-crossing this vessel’s bow.”

Reaching San Francisco with no further incident on 4 June 1945, &quot;Lynx&quot; anchored upon arrival and remained there until 8 June, when she shifted to Moore&#x27;s Dry Dock Company&#x27;s Oakland yard. After undergoing repairs and alterations, 9–19 June, the ship then returned to the Encinal Terminal on 20 June, and began loading cargo the following day. Completing those evolutions on 28 June, she moved out into the naval anchorage later that same day.

Shifting to the Tiburon anchorage during the afternoon watch on 1 July 1945, &quot;Lynx&quot; secured a towing hawser to section 51 of , along with covered lighter , at 11:06 the following morning, 2 July, and a little under seven hours later took departure from San Francisco in Convoy FE 3 (TU 06.12.15), with Capt. Lyell St.L. Pamperin, the convoy commodore, on board. The tug &quot;Hillsboro Inlet&quot;, towing open lighter and covered lighters and , accompanied the cargo ship and her tows, with the salvage vessel in the role of retriever. Derangement to her anchor windlass prevented the tug &quot;Point Arena&quot;, with her tows, section 52 of &quot;ABSD-7&quot; and &quot;YF-1012&quot;, from getting underway with the convoy as it put to sea, bound for the Marshall Islands.

Six days out, &quot;Protector&quot; left the convoy and guided &quot;Point Arena&quot; and her tows to join up with FE-3, 8 July 1945, and the voyage toward Eniwetok continued, the little assemblage crossing the International Date Line on 25 July. On the afternoon of 28 July, &quot;Lynx&quot; transferred Lt. Wuestenfeld, her medical officer, to &quot;Hillsboro Inlet&quot; to treat a sick sailor, but the remainder of the voyage proceeded uneventfully, FE-3 reaching Eniwetok on the morning of 2 August. Medium harbor tug relieved &quot;Lynx&quot; of &quot;YF-1013&quot;, while section 51 of &quot;ABSD-7&quot; cut loose the towing cable and came to anchor.

&quot;Lynx&quot; fueled from soon after her arrival on 2 August 1945, and after her departure had been delayed one day, sailed for Majuro Atoll, in the Marshalls, on the morning of 4 August. Reaching her destination three days later, she began discharging cargo alongside Rita Pier, Darrit Island, soon after her arrival, and continued the unloading process into 13 August, when she sailed for Kwajalein Atoll, also in the Marshalls, arriving the next day to begin discharging cargo into lighters tied up alongside off the island of Roi, until 19 August. &quot;Lynx&quot; continued the unloading process at Kwajalein, to which she had moved later on 19 August into 21 August. The following day, she loaded empty gasoline and fuel oil drums into her number two and four holds. She completed that process, as well as the discharge of all cargo, on 23 August. The following morning, 24 August, &quot;Lynx&quot; got underway to return to San Francisco.

====Final return to San Francisco====
&quot;Lynx&quot; dropped anchor in San Francisco Bay on 11 September 1945, then moved to Pier 18 before the day was out. Moving back out into the anchorage on 13 September, the cargo ship then proceeded to Hurley Marine Works four days later, to be docked on the marine railway there. Her overhaul proceeded over the ensuing days, the ship clearing dry dock on 27 September, to moor at Pier No. 3 at the Hurley facility, where she remained moored, undergoing the decommissioning process in the wake of the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (OpNav) despatch of 26 September, that ordered the vessel&#x27;s inactivation, through the end of October.

===Decommissioning===
Underway at the start of the forenoon watch on 1 November 1945, &quot;Lynx&quot; steamed to Suisun Bay, California, where she dropped anchor in anchorage 26, berth E-14, tying up alongside the freighter &quot;Charles M. McGroarty&quot; at 11:19. Representatives of the War Shipping Administration (WSA) then signed papers accepting the vessel from the Navy, and &quot;Lynx&quot; was decommissioned at 12:30. She entered the Reserve Fleet the same day, and her name was stricken from the Naval Register on 16 November 1945.

===Fate===
Resuming her original name, &quot;Juan Bautista de Anza&quot;, the ship remained in reserve until purchased by Union Minerals and Alloys Corporation, for non-transportation use (NTU), on 3 October 1972, for $40,000.00. She was physically removed from the Reserve Fleet on 10 November 1972.

<doc id="1034500" wikidata="Q3062451" url="?curid=1034500" title="John Montagu, 2nd Duke of Montagu">
<text>Major-General John Montagu, 2nd Duke of Montagu, (1690 – 5 July 1749), styled Viscount Monthermer until 1705 and Marquess of Monthermer between 1705 and 1709, was a British Army officer and courtier.

==Life==
Montagu was born in 1690. He received private tuition as a child and also went on a grand tour of Italy and France with Pierre Sylvestre in his formative years. When he was 15, on 17 March 1705, John was married to Lady Mary Churchill, daughter of John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, and Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough. His in-laws were among the wealthiest and most powerful families in Europe at the time. In 1709 he succeeded his father to the Dukedom of Montagu.

On 23 October 1717, Montagu was admitted a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians. He was made a Knight of the Garter in 1719, and was made Order of the Bath, a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1725, and a Grand Master of the Premier Grand Lodge of England which was the first Masonic Grand Lodge to be created.

On 22 June 1722, George I appointed Montagu governor of the islands of Saint Lucia and Saint Vincent in the West Indies. He in turn appointed Nathaniel Uring, a merchant sea captain and adventurer, as deputy-governor. Uring went to the islands with a group of seven ships, and established settlement at Petit Carenage. Unable to get enough support from British warships, he and the new colonists were quickly run off by the French. In 1735, he was appointed a Major general in the British Army.

In 1739, the country&#x27;s first home for abandoned children, the Foundling Hospital was created in London. Montagu was a supporter of this effort and was one of the charity&#x27;s founding governors. He also financed the education of two notable Black British figures of the age, Ignatius Sancho (a butler at his Blackheath home, Montagu House) and Francis Williams, allegedly sending the latter to Cambridge University (the university has no record of his having studied there).

In 1740, Montagu was promoted to Master-General of the Ordnance and served in that position until 1742. 
In 1745, Montagu raised a cavalry regiment known as Montagu&#x27;s Carabineers, which, however, was disbanded after the Battle of Culloden.

Montagu was a notorious practical joker, his mother-in-law writing of him that &quot;All his talents lie in things only natural in boys of fifteen years old, and he is about two and fifty; to get people into his garden and wet them with squirts, and to invite people to his country houses and put things in beds to make them itch, and twenty such pretty fancies as these.&quot;

Montagu is said to have once dunked the political philosopher Montesquieu in a tub of cold water as a joke. Montagu also commissioned William Hogarth to portray Chief Justice John Willes unflatteringly in a number of cartoons series Before and After (Hogarth) in which lusty amoral rakes seduce women.

Montagu&#x27;s country place, Boughton House, Northamptonshire, was laid out by him as a miniature Versailles, and now belonging to the Buccleuch family. He owned a library in the house, which included a copy of the 16th century Wriothesley Garter book.

After his death, his town residence, Montagu House, Bloomsbury, on the present site of the British Museum, received and for many years held the national collections, which under the name of the British Museum were first opened to the public in 1759.

Montagu was an owner of a coal mine.

==Children==

Montagu and his wife, Lady Mary Churchill, were parents to five children:

* Lady Isabella Montagu (c. 1706 – 20 December 1786). Married first William Montagu, 2nd Duke of Manchester in 1723 (no issue), and second Edward Hussey-Montagu, 1st Earl of Beaulieu (had issue).
* John (1706–1711)
* George (died in infancy)
* Lady Mary Montagu (c. 1711/1712 – 1 May 1775). Married George Brudenell, 4th Earl of Cardigan, later Duke of Montagu (had issue).
* Edward (27 December 1725 – May 1727)

==Succession==

As none of Montagu&#x27;s sons survived him, his titles became extinct upon his death in 1749. His estates were inherited by his daughter Mary, whose husband, George Brudenell, 4th Earl of Cardigan assumed the name and arms of Montagu, and in 1766 was created 1st Duke of Montagu (second creation). In 1790 this second creation dukedom of Montagu also became extinct; his only son (who had been created Baron Montagu of Boughton) having predeceased him. His daughter Elizabeth married Henry Scott, 3rd Duke of Buccleuch, 5th Duke of Queensberry who thus acquired all the unentailed property of the Dukes of Montagu.

<doc id="1034502" wikidata="Q2373199" url="?curid=1034502" title="Karelian question">
<text>The Karelian question or Karelian issue (, , ) is a dispute in Finnish politics over whether to try to regain control over eastern Karelia and other territories ceded to the Soviet Union in the Winter War and the Continuation War. Despite the name &quot;Karelian question&quot;, the term may refer also to the return of Petsamo, ceded parts of Salla and Kuusamo, and four islands in the Gulf of Finland. Sometimes the phrase &quot;debate on the return of the ceded territories&quot; (, ) is used. The Karelian question remains a matter of public debate rather than a political issue.

== History ==
The Karelian question arose when Finland was forced to cede territories to the Soviet Union after the Winter War in the Moscow peace treaty in 1940. Most Finnish citizens were evacuated from the ceded areas. Most of them returned during the Continuation War and eventually were evacuated again in 1944. The Soviet Union insisted the ceded areas be completely evacuated in 10 days. The evacuees were partly compensated for their losses; farmers, for example, received land in proportion to their earlier holdings. Usually, the compensation was about one third of the original farm. Compensation for movable property was much less. However, all evacuee families had a right to receive a small farm, and/or a plot for a detached house or a flat. The land used for these grants was confiscated by the state from municipalities and private owners. Financial compensation was funded by a general property tax of 10 to 30%, levied over a period of several years. Because the vast majority of the evacuees who had to settle in the rest of Finland were from ceded Karelia, the question was labeled &quot;The Karelian Question&quot;. After the Winter War, Karelian municipalities and parishes established Karjalan Liitto (the Karelian Association) to defend the rights of Karelians in Finland.

During the Cold War, the Karelian-born Finnish politician Johannes Virolainen lobbied for the return of Karelia. President Urho Kekkonen also tried to reacquire the territory, especially when the Soviet Union returned the peninsula of Porkkala to Finland in 1956. There was, however, no significant public controversy about the case, because Kekkonen wanted to keep it quiet. The last time Kekkonen tried to raise it was in 1972, but he had no success, and public discussion died out in the 1970s.

After the breakup of the Soviet Union, the Karelian question somewhat re-surfaced in Finland. According to an article by the Finnish newspaper &quot;Helsingin Sanomat&quot; in August 2007, the Russian president Boris Yeltsin unofficially offered to sell ceded Karelia to Finland in 1991 but was declined. However, according to many Finnish political leaders and the Russian vice Prime Minister of the time, there were no such offers, only unofficial probing of the idea. Andrei Fyodorov, an advisor of Boris Yeltsin, told the &quot;Helsingin Sanomat&quot; that he was part of a group that was tasked by the government of Russia in 1991–1992 with calculating the price of returning Karelia to Finland. This price was set at 15 billion US dollars. According to Fyodorov, Finnish president Mauno Koivisto and Finnish foreign minister Paavo Väyrynen were aware of these unofficial discussions.

== 21st century ==
Karjalan Liitto is an interest group of Karelian evacuees which hopes that Karelia will once again become part of Finland at some point, but does not openly demand it. Some smaller groups, such as ProKarelia, continue to campaign for the peaceful return of Karelia. However, no serious political party has openly supported this goal, and Finnish politicians generally say there is no need for it, citing Finland&#x27;s peace treaty with Russia. There are some individual politicians who support the return of Karelia, such as MEP Ari Vatanen, and two candidates in the presidential election of 2006: Timo Soini and Arto Lahti. Other candidates have stated that Finland has signed a peace treaty and should not campaign for the return of what are now Russian-developed territories. During a debate prior to the 2012 presidential election Timo Soini reiterated his view that, if elected, he would advance the issue.

=== Official opinions ===
Both Russia and Finland have repeatedly stated that no open territorial dispute exists between the two countries. Finland&#x27;s official stance is that the borders may be changed through peaceful negotiations, although there is currently no need to hold open talks, as Russia has shown no intention of returning the ceded areas, or discussing the question. In 1994 Boris Yeltsin commented that the &quot;seizure of Finnish Karelia&quot; was an example of Stalin&#x27;s totalitarian and aggressive politics. Later in 1997 he stated that the matter was closed. In 2000 Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that such discussions may endanger Finnish–Russian relations, and in 2001 he said that &quot;changing borders is not the best way to resolve problems&quot;, but that possible solutions would be &quot;integration and cooperation&quot;. 

In 1998 Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari said that &quot;Finland&#x27;s official position is that it does not have territorial demands on Russia. However, if Russia wants to discuss returning the ceded areas, Finland is ready for that.&quot; Several other politicians holding government office, such as the former foreign minister Erkki Tuomioja and prime minister Matti Vanhanen, have made statements along the same lines.

When commenting on poll results on 18 January 2005, the Foreign Minister of Russia Sergei Lavrov stated that if Russia were to be asked to return the ceded areas, &quot;the answer would be absolutely negative&quot;.

===Polls and popular opinion===
The latest polls show that approximately 26% to 38% of Finns would like to see Karelia return to Finnish control and some 51% to 62% would oppose such a move. In Russia, people associate the word &quot;Karelia&quot; with the Republic of Karelia instead of Finnish Karelia, which makes conducting polls more difficult. In a 1999 poll by MTV3, 34% of the people of Vyborg supported returning Karelia to Finland and 57% were opposed. Vyborg and the rest of the ceded Karelia outside the Republic of Karelia nowadays contain very few ethnic Finns, and is almost exclusively inhabited by people who moved there during the Soviet era and their descendants.

In a poll conducted by the newspaper &quot;Karjala&quot; and the research institute &quot;MC-Info Oy&quot; on 13 October 2005, 36% of Finns supported the return of ceded territories, compared to 51% who are opposed. In August 2005, a poll by &quot;Helsingin Sanomat&quot; and Suomen Gallup, determined that 30% of Finns supported and 62% opposed the return. In a poll by Taloustutkimus and Karjalan Liitto conducted in May 2005, support was 26% while 58% were opposed. A year earlier, a poll by STT showed 38% supporting and 57% opposing. A poll by Taloustutkimus was criticized by ProKarelia for asking leading questions, such as, &quot;Do you support the return of Karelia, even if it would mean more tense relations or even war with Russia?&quot; 5% of supporters and of those who declined to respond supported the return even under these circumstances (2.1% of all replies).

Many of the people who were born in Karelia and were evacuated want Karelia to become part of Finland. According to polls, older people (ages 65 and up) and young people (15-25) support the idea more strongly than the generation of their parents (25–65) who grew up during the Cold War. Former President Mauno Koivisto was against a discussion about the question. Support for regaining the ceded areas is also strong among minor nationalist right-wing groups.

== Problems and arguments ==

=== Price ===

One of the main reasons for opposing the return is the fear of the costs it would bring. According to another poll conducted by &quot;Helsingin Sanomat&quot;, 42% of Finns opposing the return list that as the most important single reason. The standard of living on the Russian side of the border is much lower than on the Finnish side. The GDP (PPP) per capita in Finland is about double that of Russia.

The costs of bringing Karelia to the same level with the rest of Finland have been researched only by supporters of the idea. According to a survey conducted by ProKarelia, the area has natural advantages that, under Finnish rule, would make it a centre of trade with Russia and industry and thus bring economic growth fast enough to solve the entire problem. According to both ProKarelian research and Arto Lahti&#x27;s estimate, the price of return would be about 30 billion euro.

=== Population ===

The area of Karelia ceded to Russia is inhabited mostly by people who moved there from Ukraine, Belarus and Russia, and their descendants. The fate of these people is a major issue in discussions of the return of Karelia to Finland. According to a poll by Finnish newspaper &quot;Helsingin Sanomat&quot;, 14% of people opposing return said their biggest concern was the tensions that could be caused by a larger Russian-speaking minority in Finland. As of 2004, there were about 370,000 Russians living in the region.

If the inhabitants were allowed to stay in their homes, Finland would receive a few hundred thousand new Russian-speaking people with no experience of living in Finnish society. If services for them in their own language were to be provided, Finland would need many more officials capable of speaking Russian. In ProKarelia&#x27;s vision, nearly half of the Russian population in Karelia would be estimated to choose to move to Russia, and even more would leave if Finland paid their expenses for doing so. However, most of the Russian-speaking population of Karelia were born there and have spent all their life in the region.

<text>is a district in the Chūō-ku ward of Osaka, Japan and the city&#x27;s main shopping area. At its center is , a covered shopping street, that is north of Dōtonbori and Sōemonchō, and parallel and east of Mido-suji street. Associated with Shinsaibashi, and west of Mido-suji street, is Amerika-mura, an American-themed shopping area and center of Osaka&#x27;s youth culture. Major stores and boutiques concentrates are found around the area. Shinsaibashi is easily accessed via the subway.

==History==
Like many place names in Osaka, the Shinsaibashi shopping district gets its name from one of the many &quot;Machi-bashi&quot; (town bridges) that were built and managed by the local merchants. Shinsaibashi was a much-loved landmark bridge that spanned the Nagahori-gawa canal.

In 1622, at the time of the excavation of the Nagahori-gawa canal, the original 35 metres-long and 4 metres-wide wooden bridge was built by Shinsai Okada, one of the four merchants who dug the Nagahori-gawa canal. The bridge was named after its builder.

As the popularity of Shinmachi to the north and the Dōtonbori theatre district to the south increased, so did the popularity of the shops lining the streets connected by the bridge, establishing the area as Osaka&#x27;s main shopping district.

The well-used wooden bridge required considerable maintenance and repairs by the townspeople who owned it. In 1873, the wooden bridge was replaced with a 37.1 metres-long and 5.2 metres-wide arched truss iron bridge that had been imported from Germany. The arched bridge was considered to be quite unusual, and became a popular topic of conversation amongst Osakans.

In 1909, accompanying the construction of a street car along the Nagahori-dori road, the iron bridge was replaced with Osaka&#x27;s first stone bridge. It was a Western-styled, elegant double arched bridge with a row of four-leafed clovers carved into the railings. At night the bridge was illuminated by eight gas lamps. The bridge was affectionately nicknamed &quot;Eyeglasses bridge&quot; by the townspeople because, with the reflection of its two stone arches in the water, it looked like a pair of glasses.

In 1964, the Nagahori-gawa canal was reclaimed to become a road, the bridge taken down, and the carved railings and the lamps from the stone bridge were used in the construction of a pedestrian overpass. This bridge was used in one of the scenes in the 1989 Hollywood movie &quot;Black Rain&quot;.

The overpass was removed as a part of the construction of the Crysta Nagahori, an underground shopping mall beneath the Nagahori-dori road. The mall opened in 1997, and the lamps and part of the carved stone railing of the overpass were used for a sidewalk bridge above the mall. Water in the ceiling of the mall flows under the bridge.

In 1973, to commemorate its 100th anniversary, the German-made iron bridge was reconstructed; it is now a pedestrian overpass in Tsurumi Ryokuchi Park.

<doc id="1034521" wikidata="Q495614" url="?curid=1034521" title="Plymouth Whalers">
<text>The Plymouth Whalers were a major junior ice hockey team in the Ontario Hockey League. They played out of Compuware Arena in Plymouth, Michigan, United States, a suburb of Detroit until 2015 when they were relocated to Flint, Michigan.

==History==
The Whalers can trace their roots back to the 1990–91 Detroit Compuware Ambassadors as an expansion team in the OHL. Since then the franchise has also been called the Detroit Junior Red Wings and the Detroit Whalers. In 1997 they were officially renamed the &quot;Plymouth Whalers&quot; after the local municipality gave generous tax breaks to the team and venue. The franchise was owned until 2015 by Peter Karmanos, who also owned the NHL&#x27;s Carolina Hurricanes (formerly the Hartford Whalers, from which the OHL team&#x27;s name was taken).


Plymouth is one of only two teams to win 5 consecutive division titles (West division from 1999 to 2003), the other team being the Ottawa 67&#x27;s (East division from 1996 to 2000). Plymouth has made the playoffs 23 consecutive seasons, since the 1991–92 season. The Whalers reached the OHL finals two consecutive seasons in 1999–2000, and 2000–01, losing to the Barrie Colts and Ottawa 67&#x27;s. These seasons included future NHLers David Legwand, Justin Williams, Robert Esche, and Stephen Weiss.

Celebrating their 10th Anniversary playing at the Compuware Arena during the 2005–06 season, all current Whalers players had been brought into the system by head coach and general manager Mike Vellucci. This created the build-up for the next year. Headed by overage captain John Vigilante, the team&#x27;s rookies in 2003 and 2004 came to fruition in James Neal, Dan Collins, and Tommy Sestito. Vellucci acquired the Belleville Bulls&#x27; leading scorer Evan Brophey and the Toronto St. Michael&#x27;s Majors goaltender Justin Peters, who had an extensive resume. On the last game of the season, the Whalers played the Saginaw Spirit, with the division title on the line, in what has been proven to be one of the most exciting OHL games in recent history. With the Whalers&#x27; 2–0 lead going into the third period, the Spirit fought back and managed the tying goal just before time expired. However, Brophey scored in overtime to clinch the Whalers&#x27; 9th division title.

During the 2006–07 season, rookie goaltenders Jeremy Smith and Michal Neuvirth, combined for the lowest goals against average in the OHL, with only 173 goals against in total. The Whalers had a number of high prospects signed or drafted by NHL teams, including former Wayne Gretzky 99 Award winner Daniel Ryder, who was acquired, with him already having been signed with the Calgary Flames. After a very inconsistent start, the team improved to fall short of the London Knights by one point for the Hamilton Spectator Trophy. During the second half of the season and through the playoffs, the Whalers featured a 23-game winning streak at home, lasting three and a half months, falling at Game 4 of the Western Conference Finals to London. The Whalers, although seeded #2, easily won the Wayne Gretzky Trophy as Western Conference playoff champion, sweeping #7 Guelph, and winning in 5 against both #3 Kitchener and #1 London. In the final, the Whalers defeated the Sudbury Wolves in six games to win the J. Ross Robertson Cup, thus earning the right to represent the OHL in the 2007 Memorial Cup.

In the Memorial Cup, the team suffered a rough start, losing to the Vancouver Giants 4–3 in overtime on May 18, and again to the Medicine Hat Tigers 4–1 on May 21. Their fortunes would change, however, on May 22, when they would defeat the Lewiston Maineiacs 2–1 in overtime, thus putting them in the tiebreaker game on May 24, in which they would defeat Lewiston again, 5–1, eliminating the Maineiacs from the Memorial Cup and advancing to the semifinal. However, on May 25, the Whalers would lose again to the Vancouver Giants in the semifinal round, this time in dramatic fashion by a score of 8–1. This way, the Whalers finished the 2007 Memorial Cup in third place.

During the 2007–08 season, the Whalers dealt the goaltender that led them to their 2007 OHL Championship, Michal Neuvirth, early to make room for Jeremy Smith to start. Neuvirth was among 12 players that left/were traded from that team, leaving the team looking to a number of young players for leadership. Chris Terry led the team in scoring and was helped by overage captain Andrew Fournier and up-and-comer AJ Jenks. In mid-December 2007, President and GM Mike Vellucci left his head coaching position for Greg Stefan. A late season injury to overage defenseman Wes Cunningham hampered the flow of the team, leading to an early playoff exit at the hands of the eventual OHL champions, the Kitchener Rangers.

Early in the 2008–09 season, Stefan was recalled to the Hurricanes, where Mike Vellucci came back to fill the head coaching role. Injuries and inconsistency plagued the team, as they fell to dead last in the league. After the coaching change, as well as key trades, including a short lived experiment with Cory McGillis, then-leading scorer Matt Caria from the Greyhounds, Scott Fletcher from the Ice Dogs, and the return from AHL-playing Brett Bellemore, the team saw a turn around by Christmas putting them back into the middle of the pack. At the deadline, as a result of Bellemore&#x27;s return and the emergence of Matt Hackett as the new starting goaltender, Patrick Lee and Jeremy Smith were traded to Niagara for draft picks.

The 2009–10 season saw the Whalers led by league MVP Tyler Seguin along with other top scorers such as Myles McCauley.

On December 29, 2013, the Whalers and the London Knights broke the newly set Canadian Hockey League attendance record. The Knights and Whalers, playing in the second OHL game of the evening outdoors at Comerica Park in Detroit, Michigan (also the second outdoor game ever played in the OHL), played in front of 26,384 spectators. The Whalers won the game 2–1 in a shootout.

On January 14, 2015, owner Peter Karmanos announced that the Whalers would be relocated to Flint, Michigan after a sale of the team to the owner of Flint&#x27;s Perani Arena and Event Center for the 2015–16 season. The OHL approved the sale, and the relocated franchise is named the Flint Firebirds. On March 15, the Whalers missed the playoffs for the only time. Six days later on March 21, the Plymouth Whalers played their final game in franchise history losing 5–1 to the Erie Otters.

==Championships==
The Plymouth Whalers have won eight divisional titles, five of them consecutively. Plymouth has also won three Hamilton Spectator trophies and reached the OHL Championship Finals three times, winning during the 2006–07 season.

==Uniforms and logos==
In 2009 all Canadian Hockey League teams came out with new Reebok EDGE Jerseys

The Plymouth Whaler logo featured an angry hockey stick-wielding whale, blowing a puck and spout of water out its blow hole. The name Whalers was superimposed on the image surround by a circle of green and blue with waves in the background.

The Whalers&#x27; white jersey had the whaler logo in the center with 3 even stripes on the sleeves and bottom of the jersey. The stripes are evenly spaced with two navy outer lines and one green inner line. The Whalers&#x27; blue jersey had the Whalers logo in the center with a white space and green space going down the sleeves. A third jersey was green with &quot;WHALERS&quot; written diagonally down the front.

==Mascot==

The Plymouth Whalers had a mascot named Shooter. His first game appearance was on December 11, 2003 against the Peterborough Petes.

==Arena==
Peter Karmanos arranged to build the Whalers a new home in Plymouth Township, Michigan as soon as the 1995–96 season ended. The Compuware Arena was constructed in six months&#x27; time, ready for the 1996–97 season, with a seating capacity of 3,807. In addition to the NHL-sized rink, there is an Olympic sized rink also in the building.

<text>Sir John Bernard Burke, (5 January 1814 – 12 December 1892) was a British genealogist and Ulster King of Arms, who helped publish &quot;Burke&#x27;s Peerage&quot;.

==Personal life==
Burke, of Irish descent, was born at London and was educated in London and France. His father, John Burke (1787–1848), was also a notable genealogist who first produced, in 1826, a &quot;Genealogical and Heraldic Dictionary of the Peerage and Baronetage of the United Kingdom&quot;. This work, generally known as &quot;Burke&#x27;s Peerage&quot;, was issued annually starting in 1847.

While practising as a barrister Bernard Burke assisted his father in his genealogical work, including the two volumes entitled &quot;The Royal Families of England, Scotland, and Wales, with their Descendants&quot; &amp;c., which were not published until after his father&#x27;s death (volume 1 in 1848, volume 2 in 1851), following which he took control of his publications. In 1853 Burke was appointed Ulster King of Arms. 

In 1854, he was knighted. In 1855, he became Keeper of the State Papers in Ireland. After having devoted his life to genealogical studies he died in Dublin on 12 December 1892. He was succeeded as editor of &quot;Burke&#x27;s Peerage and Landed Gentry&quot; by his fourth son, Ashworth Peter Burke.

Continuing his strong family tradition of genealogy and heraldry, another of Burke&#x27;s sons, Sir Henry Farnham Burke, would eventually attain the office of Garter Principal King of Arms.

==Works==
In addition to editing &quot;Burke&#x27;s Peerage&quot; from 1847 until his death, Sir Bernard brought out several editions of a companion volume, &quot;Burke&#x27;s Landed Gentry&quot;, which was first published between 1833 and 1838.

<doc id="1034531" wikidata="Q4665397" url="?curid=1034531" title="Abdul Hamid Khan (Gilgit-Baltistan activist)">
<text>Abdul Hamid Khan is the chairman of the Balawaristan National Front (Hameed group) (BNF-H), a sub-nationalist organisation. He founded the Balawaristan National Front Hameed Group (BNF-H), which sought autonomy for Gilgit-Baltistan and opposed the construction of hydroelectric dams there. BNF-H was founded in 1995 by Abdul Hamid. In 1999, Abdul Hameed Khan left Pakistan. He spent 20 years living in India and Belgium. However, after spending 20 years living abroad, Abdul Hamid unconditionally surrendered to Pakistani security officials on 8 February 2019. His organisation, BNF-H, was banned by National Counter Terrorism Authority (NACTA) on 26 February 2019.

==Self-imposed exile==
In 1999, Abdul Hamid Khan went to Nepal and later shifted to India. According to Pakistani officials, Abdul Hamid was recruited by Research &amp; Analysis Wing (RAW). In India he met Col Arjun and Joshi. During his stay in India, he lived at luxury apartment in New Delhi. Later on, Abdul Hamid family including three sons were shifted to India and were admitted to various schools and colleges at Dehradun, where huge investment was made by RAW for 11 years (1999 to 2007 and 2015 to 2018). Abdul Hamid was provided with all kinds of Indian ID documents and was facilitated to run business.

According to Pakistani officials, Abdul Hamid Khan was shifted to Brussels in 2007 so that he could appear at international forums and take part in anti-Pakistani activities. One of his actions was to send letters to the international financial institutions to make the case that no funds should be provided to Pakistan for building six proposed dams in Gilgit-Baltistan or places like Khyber Pakhtunkhwa&#x27;s Kohistan and Chitral districts that the BNF-H claims to be historically part of Gilgit-Baltistan.

==Surrender==
Abdul Hamid Khan unconditionally surrendered on 8 February 2019. Later on, the head of BNF-H student wing, Sher Nadir Shahi, also surrendered to the Pakistani security forces on 29 March 2019. Shahi was accused of trying to recruit people in Gilgit-Baltistan to join BNF-H. Abdul Hameed Khan was also the mentor of Sher Nadir Shahi.

Following their surrender Pakistani security forces conducted a major intelligence-based operation in May 2019. The operation busted the local chapter of BNF-H. In the operation, 14 more member of BNF-H were arrested. BNF-H members possessed huge cache of arms which was also captured by the security forces during the operation.

Pakistan security officials claim that Abdul Hameed Khan and Sher Nadir Shahi had links with the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), the Indian intelligence agency. Furthermore, security officials disclosed that BNF-H had made long-term plans to sow chaos in Gilgit-Baltistan at the behest of RAW by brainwashing the people through secessionist and anti-state propaganda and also to conduct terrorist attacks against the state. According to Pakistani officials, RAW invested heavily in Abdul Hamid Khan, providing him with more than one billion Indian rupees. Out of the one billion Indian rupees, 700 million rupees were sent to Pakistan through different channels. The money was used to finance anti-Pakistani activities. 

In 2020, he returned to Pakistan and ended his 23 year old exile after issuing an apology and claiming, “During my exile, 25,000 Euros was paid to me monthly by RAW to create unrest and instability in Gilgit-Baltistan. However, I used the money to support students by paying their tuition fees, and other needy people.”

<doc id="1034533" wikidata="Q673657" url="?curid=1034533" title="Saginaw Spirit">
<text>The Saginaw Spirit are a major junior ice hockey team based in Saginaw, Michigan. They are members of the West Division of the Western Conference of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL), one of the Major Junior leagues of the Canadian Hockey League (CHL). In 2024, the team won the Memorial Cup, their first championship since the franchise moved to Saginaw in 2002, and became only the third American team to win the Memorial Cup.

==History==
The Saginaw Spirit were born when Dick Garber, the owner of several local automobile dealerships, purchased the North Bay Centennials and moved the team to Saginaw after the 2001–02 season. Saginaw Spirit was named by an elementary school student attending Handley Elementary after a contest was held to name the new coming team.

The team traces its roots back to St. Catharines, Ontario, where it played as the Falcons, Teepees, and Black Hawks from 1943 to 1976. It won two Memorial Cup championships as the Teepees, in 1954 and 1960. In 1976, the franchise moved to nearby Niagara Falls, where it was known as the Flyers. In 1982, the team was moved again, this time to North Bay, and renamed the Centennials, where it remained until moving to Saginaw in 2002.

The Spirit have done extensive promotions in the Mid-Michigan area, increasing their fan base and season ticket-holder numbers. The Spirit have one of the highest attendance rates in the Ontario Hockey League.

After three rebuilding seasons, the Spirit clinched their first playoff berth on March 2, 2006, but lost in the first round to the Guelph Storm. Led by Todd Watson, they made the playoffs the following two seasons, but lost to the division rival Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds both times, in six games in 2007 and in four games in 2008. In 2009, the Spirit won their first playoff series since relocating to Saginaw, sweeping Guelph in four games. They were then swept in the second round by the London Knights.

On December 29, 2013, the Spirit and the Windsor Spitfires played the first ever outdoor game in Ontario Hockey League history. The game was played at Comerica Park in Detroit, Michigan. The Spitfires won the game 6–5 in front of a shortly lived Canadian Hockey League record of 25,749 spectators, surpassed later that night by the London Knights and Plymouth Whalers at the same venue.

In March 2023, the CHL announced the Spirit as hosts of the 2024 Memorial Cup, granting them an automatic berth. This was the first time that the United States hosted a Memorial Cup since the Spokane Chiefs in 1998. The Spirit won the championship over the London Knights, becoming only the third American team to win the Memorial Cup.

==Coaches==
The first coach in Saginaw Spirit history was Dennis Desrosiers. He was well known to local fans, with many years of hockey experience in Michigan. As a player, he spent 10 years for the Saginaw Gears (IHL), and spent time coaching the Flint Generals, Saginaw Generals &amp; Kalamazoo Wings all in Michigan.

==Uniforms and logos==
The Saginaw Spirit logo depicts an American bald eagle with the colors of the Stars and Stripes along its neck, on the words &quot;Saginaw Spirit.&quot; The uniform scheme is similar to that previously used by the U.S.A. national team. The home jerseys are white backgrounds with navy blue sleeves and red trim. The away jerseys are navy blue backgrounds with red sleeves and white trim. The Saginaw third jersey has a red background with navy blue sleeves and white trim, bearing across the chest the word &quot;Saginaw&quot; spelled diagonally downwards from left to right.

===Mascots===
Saginaw&#x27;s main mascot is &quot;Sammy Spirit,&quot; resembling an American bald eagle. The team held a vote on their website to name a new secondary mascot for the 2006–07 season. The mascot was named &quot;Steagle Colbeagle the Eagle&quot; after Stephen Colbert. Colbert had promoted the contest on his show, &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;. After naming the mascot after Colbert, the Spirit won seven straight games before losing to the Sarnia Sting on October 20. Since then, &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; had featured ongoing comedy sketches related to the team, the mascot, and other teams in the Ontario Hockey League, especially the Oshawa Generals, and Oshawa, Ontario mayor John Gray. At one game, Spirit fans threw copies of General Motors&#x27; annual report, a reference to the fact that GM, the Generals sponsor, having poor earnings at the time. As a result of losing the game, the mayor of Oshawa created Stephen Colbert day.

==Arena==
The Spirit play at Wendler Arena (capacity 5,527), which is part of The Dow Event Center complex in downtown Saginaw. The OHL All-Star Classic was hosted here in 2007, the first time that the event was hosted in an American city.

==Radio and TV==
Games can be heard live on WSGW-FM (100.5 FM) with Dillon Clark on play-by-play joined by Dennis Desrosiers and Domenic Papa on color commentary.

Reruns of games can be viewed on WNEM-DT2 (&quot;WNEM TV5 Plus&quot;). Live telecasts are streamed online via CHL TV in the U.S. and Canada and aired on Rogers Cable and Cogeco via the OHL Action Pak in Canada.

==Mid Michigan Spirit==

The Saginaw Spirit in partnership with Meijer food stores sponsor the Mid Michigan Spirit, a women&#x27;s hockey club based in Midland, Michigan. The 16U team took second at the MAHA state tournament during the 2006–2007 season. A 16U team moved up to 19U for the 2007–2008 season and once again took second at the MAHA state tournament in Canton, Michigan on March 9, 2008.

<text>Mackinac Island State Park is a state park located on Mackinac Island in the U.S. state of Michigan. A Lake Huron island, it is near the Straits of Mackinac. The island park encompasses , which is approximately 80% of the island&#x27;s total area. The park is also within the boundaries of the city of Mackinac Island and has permanent residents within its boundaries. M-185 circles the perimeter of the park as the only motorless highway in the state due to the island&#x27;s ban of automobiles. The park is governed by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources and the Mackinac Island State Park Commission. On July 15, 2009, the park celebrated its 20 millionth visitor.

The park was first established as Mackinac National Park in 1875, which was the third national park established in the United States after Hot Springs National Park &amp; Yellowstone National Park. In 1895, it was transferred to state control and reorganized as Mackinac Island State Park, which was the first state park in Michigan. The park contains many important historical and geological features, such as Fort Mackinac, Fort Holmes, other historic buildings, historic sites, limestone caves, and other unique rock formations. The park also operates the Mackinac Island Airport. Many of these sites are formally operated by the Mackinac Island State Park Commission, which also operates two other parks around the Straits of Mackinac area: Colonial Michilimackinac and Historic Mill Creek Discovery Park.

== War of 1812 ==
Mackinac Island played an important role in the War of 1812 between the United States and Canada (then a British colony). Fort Mackinac, upon the island, was built by the British army during the Revolutionary War. The British later relinquished the fort to the Americans in 1796, but then built and maintained a similar fort on nearby St. Joseph Island. The two nations used their island forts in a struggle to maintain supremacy over the waters of northern Lake Huron. As one of the opening actions of the War of 1812, the British captured Fort Mackinac and maintained it as a British stronghold until the end of the war. An American attempt to recapture the fort in 1814 failed in the Battle of Mackinac Island. When the war ended with the Treaty of Ghent in 1815, the island was returned to American control.

==History==
===National park===
Mackinac National Park on March 3, 1875, was designed by Congress as the country&#x27;s second national park after Yellowstone. Mackinac-born US Senator Thomas Ferry introduced the bill to do so after the Yellowstone designation. He argued that the active military personnel station there, as the island was then mostly a military reservation, would do double duty as caretakers of the island, which helped convince other congressmen. The park was placed within the United States Department of War.

With the leased parcel revenue plan in 1888, the fort was able to build trails, improve roads, and even put up an observation tower on the island&#x27;s highest point at Fort Holmes.

The War Department decommissioned the fort given its lack of military strategic importance in 1890. With the decommissioning, the troops were moved off the island leaving no one to care for the park. The department suggested a sale of the park.

A grassroots lobbying campaign led in September 1895 for the U.S. government to turn over the park and fort to the State of Michigan. The state legislature established the Mackinac Island State Park Commission to manage the park and its structures as the first state park, Mackinac Island State Park.

==Mackinac State Historic Parks==
Mackinac State Historic Parks is an agency within the Michigan Department of Natural Resources led by the Mackinac Island State Park Commission. The Parks consist of several parks, museum and other historical areas in the Straits of Mackinac area with the major groups includes Mackinac Island State Park, Michilimackinac State Park and Historic Mill Creek Discovery Park in Mackinaw City.

The agency is governed by the Mackinac Island State Park Commission, a seven-member body. The commissioner are appointed by the governor to six year terms with confirmation by the Michigan Senate.

While a national park, the park was first overseen by the park superintendent, who was also the fort commander. With the military not wanting to fund the park, being non-military, and the National Park Service not formed until 1916, the department approved a revenue plan by a captain at the fort in which choice parcels would be leased to resorters to build summer cottages which started in 1885.

When the park was turned over to the State of Michigan in 1895 to become the first state park, the state legislature established the Mackinac Island State Park Commission to manage the park and its structures.

<text>The Sarnia Sting are a junior ice hockey team based in Sarnia, Ontario, Canada. They are one of the 20 teams that make up the Ontario Hockey League. They play out of the Progressive Auto Sales Arena (formerly the Sarnia Sports and Entertainment Centre).

On January 22, 2015, NHL forward David Legwand, who played for the Ottawa Senators at the time, and former NHL defenseman Derian Hatcher entered an agreement to purchase the Sarnia Sting. The transfer of ownership was approved by the OHL Board of Governors and completed on March 4, 2015.

==History==
The franchise was granted in 1969 as one of the inaugural teams of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League. At the time, the team was located in Cornwall, Ontario and known as the Cornwall Royals. During the team&#x27;s tenure in the QMJHL the Royals won the Memorial Cup in 1972, 1980, and in 1981.

For the 1981–82 season, the team transferred to the Ontario Hockey League. In 1992, the franchise moved again to Newmarket, Ontario to play as the Newmarket Royals.

In 1994, the team was bought by the Ciccarelli brothers and moved to Sarnia, Ontario. Robert Ciccarelli, voted OHL Executive of the Year in 1999–2000, was the team&#x27;s president and governor until January 2015, when the team was sold to its current owners, former NHL defenseman Derian Hatcher and former NHL forward David Legwand.

In 2018, Dan Carcillo made accusations of hazing during the 2002–03 OHL season. League commissioner David Branch responded with sanctions against the Sting. The club implemented changes in its routines to avoid further incidents.
In the 2021 OHL Draft, the Sting became the first OHL team to draft a female player, selecting goalie Taya Currie 267th overall.

==Championships==
The Sarnia Sting have yet to win their first J. Ross Robertson Cup and first Memorial Cup. The 2022-23 season was the closest the team came to the OHL Championship, but lost in the Conference Finals to London Knights 4 games to 2. Their first division title came in the 2003–04 season, when the team won the OHL West Division, winning the Bumbacco Trophy, but were later eliminated in the first round of the playoffs. The Sarnia Sting won their second West Division title in 2016. They beat the Guelph Storm 7–1 to clinch the division. That was their first division title in 12 years. On March 19, 2016, the Sarnia Sting broke a franchise record from 2002–03 capturing 41 wins and 91 points to end the 2015–16 OHL season.

===Retired numbers===
On January 12, 2018, the Sarnia Sting officially retired the first number in franchise history, Steven Stamkos&#x27; number 91. There are also banners in honour of Shawn Burr and Kerry Fraser. Banners that were once hung, but have since been taken down, include the ones of Aaron Brand and Peter Sarno who both won OHL scoring titles, Trevor Letowski, who all participated at IIHF World Junior Championships in 1997, and Danny Fritsche who won gold with the United States men&#x27;s national junior ice hockey team in 2004. The team has also created a Hall of Fame inside the arena. The inaugural induction members include Jon Sim, Trevor Letowski and Rob Ciccarelli.

==Jerseys and logos==

The original Sarnia Sting jersey (worn from 1994/95 - 1998/99) showed a bee playing hockey with its stinger poised. The team&#x27;s colours were black, white and silver. An alternate jersey (worn from 1997/98 - 1998/99) had a yellow background and a bee holding a stick above the Sarnia name on the chest.

The current jerseys include a white jersey with a bee in the centre and a black jersey with a bee in the centre. The team got new jerseys during the 2019-20 season. During the first half of the season, the team wears the white uniform at home while during the second half of the season they wear the black uniform at home.

During the 2012 offseason the team held a contest to design the team&#x27;s alternate jersey for the season. The is yellow with black and white stripes down the arm. The logo is round and includes a picture of the Blue Water Bridge in the background with a bee in the centre. Around the bridges and the bee it is inscribed &quot;Sarnia Sting&quot; on top and &quot;Hockey Club&quot; on the bottom.

==Arenas==
Relocation from Newmarket, Ontario in 1994 was made on the promise that a new arena would be built in Sarnia. In the meantime the team played their first four seasons at Sarnia Arena located in the downtown area.

<text>Trouville-sur-Mer (, literally &quot;Trouville on Sea&quot;), commonly referred to as Trouville, is a city of 4,603 inhabitants in the Calvados department in the Normandy region in northwestern France.

Trouville-sur-Mer borders Deauville across the River Touques. This fishing-village on the English Channel became a popular tourist attraction (beach-resort and holiday-destination) in Normandy from the 19th century. Its long sandy beach earned then the nickname of &quot;queen of the beaches&quot; (&quot;Reine des plages&quot;) or &quot;most beautiful beach in the world&quot;.

The name of Trouville is frequently associated with the names of the numerous painters that visited it and painted there, especially during the second part of the XIXth century: Claude Monet, Eugène Boudin, Raoul Dufy, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Gustave Caillebotte, Fernand Léger, etc.

Trouville remains today a city of leisure and vacation with a casino and numerous festivals, as well as a city of culture (Marcel Proust, Marguerite Duras, Raymond Savignac, etc.). Numerous celebrities own vacation homes in the city: Gérard Depardieu, Antoine de Caunes, Bettina Rheims, Jean-Paul Belmondo, Karl Zéro, etc.

Close to Paris and easily accessible by train, Trouville (as well as neighbouring Deauville) earned the nickname of 21st &quot;Arrondissements of Paris&quot;.

<doc id="1034559" wikidata="Q6776147" url="?curid=1034559" title="Martin McAleese">
<text>Martin McAleese (born 24 March 1951) is an Irish politician, dentist and accountant who has served as the Chancellor of Dublin City University since August 2011. He served as a Senator from 2011 to 2013, after being Nominated by the Taoiseach. He is the husband of the 8th President of Ireland, Mary McAleese.

==Early life, education and family==
McAleese was born in Belfast in 1951. He was educated at St Mary&#x27;s Christian Brothers&#x27; Grammar School, Belfast. He then studied at Queen&#x27;s University Belfast, obtaining an honours Bachelor of Science in Physics. He played Gaelic football for the Antrim Minors and was captain of the team in 1969. In 1972, after he graduated he moved to Dublin and trained there as an accountant with the chartered accountancy firm of Stokes, Kennedy, Crowley. He later worked as financial controller for an Aer Lingus subsidiary.

McAleese married Mary Leneghan in 1976. The couple resided in Scholarstown, Dublin, for a short period, and then for almost twelve years near Ratoath, County Meath. In 1980, he returned to full-time education at Trinity College Dublin, to study as a dentist, subsequently moving back, with his family, to Northern Ireland, where he practised as a dentist in Crossmaglen and Bessbrook, County Armagh.

==Public service career==
While his wife served as President of Ireland, McAleese initiated a series of meetings with senior Ulster loyalist paramilitary leaders to pursue peace negotiations. These actions did not take place without controversy, but have been widely viewed as instrumental in bringing loyalist paramilitary groups to peace talks.

In May 2011, McAleese was appointed as a Senator by the Taoiseach Enda Kenny. In August 2011, he was appointed the Chancellor of Dublin City University, taking over from David Byrne.

On 1 February 2013, McAleese announced his intention to resign as a member of Seanad Éireann.

McAleese accepted an appointment as Chairman of the Inter-Departmental Committee which was set up by the Government of Ireland to investigate the Magdalene laundries. His findings have been criticised by some survivors and researchers from the Magdalene Names project.

On 18–19 October 2014, McAleese attended the One Young World Summit in Dublin as a keynote speaker. Here, he hosted a special session for the One Young World Peace and Conflict Resolution Project alongside former Ulster Defence Association (UDA) prisoner Jackie McDonald and former Irish Republican Army (IRA) prisoner Sean Murray. They addressed young people from 191 countries to share and develop ideas to strengthen efforts at conflict resolution in their own countries.

==Personal life==

Martin and his wife Mary have three children. The family moved to Rostrevor, County Down, in 1987, when Martin set up practice in County Armagh.

<doc id="1034560" wikidata="Q1502560" url="?curid=1034560" title="Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds">
<text>The Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds (often shortened to Soo Greyhounds) are a major junior ice hockey team in the Ontario Hockey League. The Greyhounds play home games at the GFL Memorial Gardens. The present team was founded in 1962 as a team in the Northern Ontario Hockey Association. The Greyhounds name has been used by several ice hockey teams based in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada, since 1919.

==Early years==
The first Greyhounds team formed in 1919, playing in the now defunct Upper-Peninsula League. The team&#x27;s coach was George McNamara. He suggested the team be called the Greyhounds since, &quot;a greyhound is much faster than a wolf.&quot; That reference was to the already established rival club, the Sudbury Wolves.

A couple of seasons later, the Greyhounds switched to the Northern Ontario Hockey Association Senior &quot;A&quot; division. The team won the Senior A championship in 1921, 1923, 1924 and 1925. The 1924 Greyhounds also won the Allan Cup, becoming the only team from Sault Ste. Marie to do so. In October 1925, the club received an offer from New York to play as the Knickerbockers in the Eastern Amateur Hockey League. The Greyhounds joined the Central Amateur Hockey Association, a division of the United States Amateur Hockey Association for the 1925–26 season. After the season, several players joined the professional ranks and the team folded.

In 1929, a junior Greyhounds team was organized, competing in the Northern Ontario Junior Hockey League. The juniors won the league championship four consecutive years from 1928 to 1931, and added a fifth title in 1942. Junior hockey in Sault Ste. Marie came to an abrupt end in 1945, when the Gouin Street Arena was destroyed by fire.

The senior Greyhounds team was revived in 1948. The new team played out of a temporary home at Pullar Stadium, in Sault Sainte Marie, Michigan, U.S.A., until the Memorial Gardens opened in 1949. The senior Greyhounds won the NOHA championship four times, in 1950, 1951, 1952 and 1955. This team folded, along with the league, after the 1958–59 season.

==Modern era==
The current Greyhounds Junior A franchise was founded in 1962 as a member of the Northern Ontario Junior Hockey League (NOJHL). The team&#x27;s founders were Angelo Bumbacco, Lloyd Prokop, Phil Suraci, Pat Esposito and Bill Kelly. During the Greyhounds ten seasons in the NOJHL, they never had a losing season, and won the league championship three times. In 1972, the Greyhounds entered the Ontario Hockey Association as a Major Junior A expansion team. The original founders served as directors, joined by Frank Caputo and Frank Sarlo. Angelo Bumbacco died on October 27, 2020, aged 88.

===Wayne Gretzky 1977–78===
In 1977, the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds picked a 16-year-old Wayne Gretzky, standing at and weighing , with the third pick in the Ontario Midget Draft. He was still small in stature, but would have a big impact on the game.

Gretzky requested to wear # 9 for his idol Gordie Howe, but that number was already taken by teammate Brian Gualazzi. Gretzky then chose # 14 instead. After a few games, coach Muzz MacPherson suggested wearing two nines would be better than one. From that season on, Gretzky always wore the legendary # 99.

In 63 games that year, he set the Greyhounds all-time record, scoring 70 goals and had 112 assists for a total of 182 points. Gretzky would have won the scoring title, except for a 192-point season by 20-year-old player Bobby Smith. Gretzky was awarded the Emms Family Award as the rookie of the year, and the William Hanley Trophy as most gentlemanly player.

===Memorial Cup, 1985===
After winning the OHL championship, the Greyhounds travelled to Shawinigan, Quebec to compete in the Memorial Cup tournament, for the national junior hockey title. The Greyhounds played against the host team Shawinigan Cataractes, the QMJHL champion Verdun Junior Canadiens, and the WHL champion Prince Albert Raiders.

The Greyhounds were led by future NHLers, Jeff Beukeboom, Chris Felix, Derek King, Wayne Presley, Bob Probert and Rob Zettler. Leading scorers in the regular season were Wayne Groulx, Graeme Bonar and Sault Ste. Marie native Mike Oliverio.

The Greyhounds won the first game on May 11 in Shawinigan versus the home team, by a score 4–3, in front of 3,276 fans. Televising games from the Aréna Jacques Plante in Shawinigan proved difficult due to roof support pillars around the ice surface. After two games in Shawinigan, the remainder of the tournament was played in the Centre Marcel Dionne in Drummondville, Quebec.

The Greyhounds won their first game in Drummondville 6–3 over Verdun, with two goals from Derek King. Their first loss of the tournament came in game three, losing 8–6 to the Prince Albert Raiders. With the loss, the Cataractes, Raiders and Greyhounds would all finish the round-robin with two wins and a loss. Shawinigan earned a spot in the finals on best goals for and against difference, with Sault Ste. Marie and Prince Albert to have a rematch in the semi-final game. On May 16, the Greyhounds lost again to the Raiders.

===Memorial Cup, 1991===
The Greyhounds season of 1990–91 marked an incredible turnaround from seventh place the season before, to finishing first place and winning the Emms division. General manager Sherwood Bassin put together pieces for coach Ted Nolan to win. Bassin was awarded Bill Long Award for distinguished service to the OHL, was named both the OHL Executive of the Year, and the CHL Executive of the Year in 1991.
The Greyhounds swept both playoff series and earned a second round bye to reach the OHL finals against the defending champions, the Oshawa Generals. The J. Ross Robertson Cup finals had many subplots due to the big trade between the clubs in the previous season. Added to the mix was Joe Busillo, an overager picked up from Oshawa, who won the Memorial Cup with the Generals the previous year. Fans from the Soo were still very bitter towards Oshawa captain Eric Lindros, who had originally been drafted by the Greyhounds in 1989 but chose not to play for them (eventually being traded to the Generals). The Soo crowd loudly jeered Lindros every time he was on the ice during the championship series. The Greyhounds upset the heavily favoured defending champions in a six-game series, winning the last game on home ice.

The Greyhounds were led in scoring by Colin Miller, Tony Iob, Trevor Koopmans, and future NHLers Adam Foote and tough guys Bob Boughner, and Denny Lambert. Other members to move onto the NHL included Drew Bannister, Ralph Intranuovo, Brad Tiley and goaltenders Kevin Hodson and Mike Lenarduzzi.

The 1991 Memorial Cup was hosted by the QMJHL in Quebec City at the Colisée de Québec. Their opponents would be the WHL champion Spokane Chiefs, and the QMJHL finalists Drummondville Voltigeurs and the champion Chicoutimi Saguenéens. The Greyhounds did not win a game in the tournament, but gained valuable experience for next season.

===Memorial Cup, 1992===
The 1991–92 Greyhounds repeated as winners of the Emms division. Sault Ste. Marie earned a first round bye in the playoffs, then defeated the Kitchener Rangers and Niagara Falls Thunder to return to the league finals. The Greyhounds won their third J. Ross Robertson Cup by defeating their northern counterparts, the North Bay Centennials in a seven-game series.

The Greyhounds were led by captain Rick Kowalsky, and in scoring by Jarrett Reid&#x27;s 53 goals and also had two players with 100 point seasons, Colin Miller and Ralph Intranuovo. The Soo also gained a midseason boost and more toughness, acquiring future NHLer Chris Simon in a trade with the Ottawa 67&#x27;s.

The 1992 Memorial Cup was hosted by the WHL in Seattle, Washington at the Seattle Center Coliseum. Their opponents would be the WHL champion Kamloops Blazers, the QMJHL champion Verdun Collège Français, and the host Seattle Thunderbirds.

The Greyhounds reversed their fortunes of the previous Memorial Cup, winning all three games of the round-robin, advancing directly to the tournament finals. Their opponent in the finals would be the Kamloops Blazers. The Greyhounds came back from an early 3–0 deficit 15 minutes into the game to tie the score at 3-3. Kamloops scored early in the third period for a 4–3 lead. Chris Simon then tied the game for Sault Ste. Marie with four minutes remaining to play. The game looked to be headed for overtime, until Kamloops&#x27; Zac Boyer scored on a breakaway with 14.6 seconds remaining to seal the victory for the Blazers.
===Memorial Cup, 1993===
In the 1992–93, the Greyhounds won their third consecutive Emms division title. They narrowly beat out the Detroit Junior Red Wings by having more wins in the regular season despite both teams earning 81 points. The OHL revived the idea of a Super Series from six years previous to determine which team would host the Memorial Cup of 1993. The Greyhounds assured themselves of a third consecutive trip to the Memorial Cup, by sweeping the series versus the Leyden division champion Peterborough Petes. Jarret Reid led Sault Ste. Marie in scoring through the playoffs, with 19 goals and 16 assists in 18 games.

After the Super Series ended, the regular playoffs started. Sault Ste. Marie earned the first round bye, then defeated the Owen Sound Platers and the Junior Red Wings to reach the finals against the Petes. This time, the Petes prevailed 4 games to 1, spoiling the Greyhounds chances of a third consecutive J. Ross Robertson Cup. Joining the Greyhounds and Petes in the Memorial Cup would be the WHL champion Swift Current Broncos and the QMJHL champion Laval Titan.

The Greyhounds and the Petes both finished the Memorial Cup round-robin with two wins and a loss. Sault Ste. Marie earned a berth in the finals by having beaten the Petes in the round robin. The two teams would meet again in the tournament finals, playing in front a hometown crowd of 4,757 spectators at the Memorial Gardens on May 23. Sault Ste. Marie led 3–0 after the first period, and held on to win their first Memorial Championship, beating the Petes 4–2. The victory party continued on Queen St. late into the evening.

===Recent years===
The Greyhounds followed up their Memorial Cup winning season with a strong 1993–94 campaign finishing second place in the division. The Soo reached the semi-finals, but lost to the Junior Red Wings in six games. After the season, coach Ted Nolan departed for the Hartford Whalers.

The following 1994–95 season, the Greyhounds finished last place in the league during a rebuilding season. In attempt to generate more sales, the Greyhounds redesigned their logo. It proved to be unpopular with the fans, and the team discontinued its use after the 1998–99 season, and went back to the classic logo.

Centre Joe Thornton was the 1995–96 OHL rookie of the year and was the first player in the history of the franchise to be drafted first overall in the NHL Entry Draft. He was selected by the Boston Bruins.

In the 2001–02 season, former Greyhound defenceman Craig Hartsburg took over as head coach after coaching stints in the NHL. Hartsburg was named the OHL coach of the year that season, then left the team to join the coaching staff of the Philadelphia Flyers.

Replacing Hartsburg was former Greyhound netminder, and part-owner of the team, John Vanbiesbrouck. Vanbiesbrouck was forced to resign as coach during the season as a result of racist comments he had made about team captain, Trevor Daley. Hartsburg returned as coach midway through the 2004–05 season.

After playing at the Sault Memorial Gardens from 1962 to 2006, the Greyhounds moved into their new home, the Steelback Centre, for the 2006–07 season. In June 2008, the arena was renamed The Essar Centre, following the purchase of naming rights by Essar Steel Algoma.

In the 2007–08 OHL season, the Greyhounds had their best regular season since 1985, going 44–18–2–4, with a long undefeated streak to begin the year. The Greyhounds also had their longest post season run since 1994, making it to the conference finals before losing to the Kitchener Rangers in five games.

In the 2008–09 season, assistant coach Denny Lambert assumed head coaching duties after Craig Hartsburg left to become head coach of the NHL&#x27;s Ottawa Senators. Assistant coach Toots Kovacs also left the team and was replaced by Mike Stapleton and Nick Warriner. The Greyhounds missed the playoffs for the first time since 2004.

After several trades in the organization had shown a shift to rebuilding the team, Dave Torrie (General Manager), took over head coaching duties with the firing of Denny Lambert in January 2011. Later that same year Dave Torrie was also relieved of his duties and replaced with Kyle Dubas as general manager. The fans also welcomed back Mike Stapleton as new Head Coach for next season, but was fired and replaced on December 3, 2012, by Sheldon Keefe.

After the 2014–15 OHL season, the Greyhounds had taken the Hamilton Spectator Trophy while setting a franchise record in regular season points. During the 2015 playoffs, the Greyhounds had their run ended by Connor McDavid and the Erie Otters in the Western Conference Finals. After one of the teams best seasons, head coach Sheldon Keefe had signed with the Toronto Marlies of the AHL.

On July 10, 2015, Drew Bannister was named head coach of the Greyhounds. He would leave after the 2017–18 season to become the head coach of the San Antonio Rampage in the AHL. Bannister had led the Hounds to an overall 136–50–13–5 record, two West Division titles, and was named OHL and CHL coach of the year in 2018.

==Championships==
While in the Northern Ontario Junior Hockey League, the Greyhounds won the McNamara Trophy as playoff champions in 1967, 1970, and 1972. The Greyhounds were also regular season champions six times and playoff finalists 4 times.

The Greyhounds also joined the Oshawa Generals and Peterborough Petes as the only OHL teams to make three consecutive appearances in the Memorial Cup. Since joining the OHL, Sault Ste. Marie has won a total of 8 division titles, five Hamilton Spectator Trophy titles, three J. Ross Robertson Cup titles, and one Memorial Cup title.

==Uniforms and logos==

The Greyhounds colours are predominantly red and white, with uniforms in a style very similar to the Detroit Red Wings. Black and silver trim were added in the late 1980s, as well as four stars above the logo. Sault Ste. Marie has used their classic red circle logo with the running greyhound for all but three seasons of their existence.

From 1996 to 1999 the Greyhounds redesigned their logo (inset right), to what became known by fans as the &quot;Ugly Dog&quot; or &quot;Snoopy&quot; logo. Due to public backlash and a fan petition for its removal, the team discontinued its use and went back to the classic logo. For the 2009-10 switchover to the Reebok Edge jersey system, the Greyhounds returned to their classic jerseys from the 1970s and early 80s, including removing black &amp; silver from their logo. In 2013, the team switched to jerseys identical to those of the NHL&#x27;s Detroit Red Wings.

The Greyhounds have used third jerseys since 2006, when the team introduced a black third jersey with a &quot;Soo Greyhounds&quot; script logo, as well as red, white, and grey trim, and stars around the waist. The jersey was slightly updated for its 2010 return after the Reebok Edge switchover, but was completely replaced in 2013 in favour of a simpler red third jersey with the running greyhound as the main logo, and a white nameplate with red lettering.

==Arenas==

The first home of the Greyhounds from 1919 to 1945 was Gouin Street Arena. The arena had wooden benches for 1,000 spectators. It was destroyed by fire in 1945. An outdoor rink at Pullar Stadium in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan was used until a new indoor facility was built. The Greyhounds returned to Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan again in 1979, playing for about a month at Taffy Abel Arena on the campus of Lake Superior State University due to emergency roof repairs at the Gardens.

The Greyhounds played home games at the Sault Memorial Gardens from 1949 to 2006. The building was named for the war veterans of World War II. The Gardens hosted Memorial Cup games in 1978 and 1993, and the OHL All-Star Game in 1979. The last game at the Gardens was played on Tuesday, March 28, 2006. Demolition of the Gardens began on April 27, 2006. All that remains of the Gardens is the Memorial Tower, which is part of &quot;Memorial Square&quot;. The red beacon of the Memorial Tower was preserved and continues to be lit on game days.

The Greyhounds moved to the new GFL Memorial Gardens (formerly named the Steelback Centre and the Essar Centre) for the 2006–07 OHL season. The new arena was built in the east parking lot of the Memorial Gardens, and is the largest such centre in Northern Ontario. Its naming rights are currently held by GFL Environmental. The inaugural game was played on October 11, 2006, resulting in a 2–1 loss to the Sudbury Wolves. The 2008 OHL All-Star Classic was held at the Essar Centre during the 2007–08 season.

==Media==
Since the 2009–10 season, Greyhounds&#x27; games have been broadcast on the radio by Rock 101 in neighbouring Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, after previously airing on Q104 and CKCY. Most regular season and playoff games for the Greyhounds are broadcast on Shaw Spotlight in Sault Ste. Marie.

<doc id="1034563" wikidata="Q1235942" url="?curid=1034563" title="Netatalk">
<text>Netatalk (pronounced &quot;ned-uh-talk&quot;) is a free, open-source implementation of the Apple Filing Protocol (AFP). It allows Unix-like operating systems to serve as file servers for Macintosh computers running macOS or Classic Mac OS.

Netatalk was originally developed by the Research Systems Unix Group at the University of Michigan for BSD-derived Unix systems and released in 1990. Apple had introduced AppleTalk soon after the release of the original Macintosh in 1985, followed by the file sharing application AppleShare (which was built on top of AFP) in 1987. This was an early example of zero-configuration networking, gaining significant adoption in educational and small to mid size office environments in the late 80s. Netatalk emerged as a part of the software ecosystem around AppleTalk.

In 1986, Columbia University published the &quot;Columbia AppleTalk Package&quot; (CAP), which was an open source implementation of AppleTalk originally written for BSD 4.2, allowing Unix servers to be part of AppleTalk networks. CAP also had its own implementation of AFP/AppleShare, but Netatalk appearing in 1990 claimed better performance due to software design advantages. CAP and Netatalk were also interoperable, the latter being able to be run on an AppleTalk backend provided by CAP.

As part of transitioning the software into an open source community project, the codebase was moved to SourceForge for revision control in July 2000, then re-licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License with version 1.5pre7 in August 2001.

Since Classic Mac OS uses a forked file system, unlike the host operating systems where Netatalk would be running, Netatalk originally implemented the AppleDouble format for storing the resource fork separately from the data fork when a Mac OS file was transferred to the Unix-like computer&#x27;s file system. This was required in order not to ruin most files by discarding the resource fork when copied to the Netatalk served AppleShare volume. With the release of Netatalk 3.0, the backend was re-implemented to use the Extended Attributes format that Apple had introduced with Mac OS X for backwards compatibility with Classic Mac OS resource forks.

== Development history ==
The original developer of Netatalk was Wesley Craig at the University of Michigan. In 1997 Adrian Sun created a popular fork, coding the initial implementation of the then-new &quot;AppleShare IP&quot; (AFP over TCP/IP) network layer. By the time the project started transitioning into an open source model in 2000, the &quot;ASUN&quot; fork had been merged back into Netatalk proper.

In October 2004 Netatalk 2.0 was released, which brought major improvements, including: support for Apple Filing Protocol level 3.1 (providing long UTF-8 filenames, file sizes &gt; 2 gigabytes, full Mac OS X compatibility), CUPS integration, Kerberos V support allowing true &quot;single sign-on&quot;, and a more reliable file and directory ID database backend. 

Since version 2.0.5 in 2009, Netatalk supports the use of Time Machine over a network in a similar fashion to Apple&#x27;s own Time Capsule. With version 2.2 released in July 2011, Netatalk introduced support for AFP protocol level 3.3, the penultimate revision of the protocol.

Version 3.0 of Netatalk was released in July 2012 and added ini style configuration, and Mac OS X compatible Extended Attributes as default, while removing AppleTalk networking support.

Netatalk 3.1, released in October 2013, added Spotlight support in addition to improved SMB interoperability. A subsequent bugfix release added support for AFP level 3.4 (introduced in OS X Mountain Lion) which is the final revision of the protocol from Apple.

Netatalk 4.0 was made available in September 2024, bringing back the support for AppleTalk removed in 3.0, while introducing support for tunneling TCP/IP traffic to MacIP, which allows LocalTalk-only Macs to connect to the Internet.

At the time of writing, Netatalk runs on the Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, Solaris, illumos, and macOS operating systems.

== AppleTalk ==
In all Netatalk versions except the 3.x release series, the AppleTalk (DDP) protocol suite is used to allow Unix-like operating systems to serve also as print (PAP via a CUPS backend) and time (Timelord) servers for Macintosh computers.

Networked Apple IIe and Apple IIGS computers can be netbooted from a Netatalk shared volume. Additionally, a suite of tools for inspecting and manipulating AppleTalk networks, as well as printing to LocalTalk connected printers from modern systems is included.

== Commercial use ==
Netatalk is (or was previously) integrated into a range of NAS solutions, including Buffalo NAS systems, Exanet ExaStore, Iomega&#x27;s Home Media Network Hard Drive, IXsystems TrueNAS, LaCie NAS OS, Lime Technology unRAID, Napp-it, Netgear ReadyNAS, QNAP NAS, Synology DiskStation, Thecus NAS, and more.

In 2010, a company called NetAFP run by a group of Netatalk maintainers started providing commercial support for enterprise deployments of Netatalk. The company merged with German Samba vendor &quot;SerNet&quot; in December 2013, signaling the end of commercial support for Netatalk in favor of SMB, which Apple had made the primary file sharing protocol with the release of Mac OS X Mavericks that same year. The NetAFP website was shut down in early 2022.

== Logo ==

While a project at the University of Michigan, Netatalk&#x27;s logo was the head of the BSD Daemon on a daisy chained serving tray, mimicking the icon design language that Apple used for AppleTalk and AppleShare in Classic Mac OS.

Coinciding with the release of Netatalk 2.0, the logo was stylized into the Daemon head silhouette with overlaid networking cables logo that the project is presently using.

<doc id="1034565" wikidata="Q7102893" url="?curid=1034565" title="Orixa (band)">
<text>Orixa is an alternative rock/rock en español duo from the United States. Members are Rowan Jimenez and Juan Manuel Caipo. Orixa&#x27;s music mixes many different styles including rock, reggae, hip hop, Brazilian music, funk and Afro-Latin music. Orixa received a California Music Award for &quot;Outstanding Latin Album&quot; and the ASCAP Latino Award for &quot;Best Independent Group&quot;.

Orixa released its self-titled debut in 1996 on Aztlan Records.

In 2000, the band released 2012.e.d on their own ELegua Digital Records. This record brought much attention to the group. In 2001 Orixa received a California Music Award for &quot;Outstanding Latin Album&quot; and the ASCAP Latino Award for &quot; Best Independent Group&quot;. They were also part of the highly successful Rock En Español CD compilation &quot;Escena Alterlatina&quot;

The video for &quot;Lucha Por La Freedom&quot; was directed by Mike Buller.

In 2003, Orixa released a demo called &quot;Siembra&quot; (which includes an excerpt of Cheo Feliciano&#x27;s &quot;El Raton&quot;). The song allowed them to meet Uruguayan director Leonardo Ricagni who offered to make a video for the song. The &quot;Siembra&quot; video debuted in 2004 on MTV-es and became the Buzzworthy video next to Juanes and the Kumbia Kings and had heavy rotation on the music channel.

Orixa released their last album to date, Siembra, in 2005 which included the singles &quot;Siembra&quot; as well as &quot;The American&quot; and &quot;Cuando Era Un Niño&quot;. The first two were featured on Showtime&#x27;s &quot;Sleeper Cell&quot;.

The band is on hiatus as of December 2006.

Caipo has also collaborated with Hip Hop Hoodíos.

<doc id="1034567" wikidata="Q150843" url="?curid=1034567" title="Hexadecane">
<text>Hexadecane (also called cetane) is an alkane hydrocarbon with the chemical formula C16H34. Hexadecane consists of a chain of 16 carbon atoms, with three hydrogen atoms bonded to the two end carbon atoms, and two hydrogens bonded to each of the 14 other carbon atoms.

==Cetane number==

&quot;Cetane&quot; is often used as a shorthand for cetane number, a measure of the combustion of diesel fuel. Cetane ignites very easily under compression; for this reason, it is assigned a cetane number of 100, and serves as a reference for other fuel mixtures.

==Hexadecyl radical==

Hexadecyl is an alkyl radical of carbon and hydrogen derived from hexadecane, with formula C16H33 and with mass 225.433, occurring especially in cetyl alcohol. It confers strong hydrophobicity on molecules containing it. Carboplatin modified with hexadecyl and polyethylene glycol has increased liposolubility and PEGylation, proposed to useful in chemotherapy, specifically non-small-cell lung cancer.

Hexadecyl was used from 1982 for radiolabelling, and this continues to be useful, for example for radiolabelling exosomes and hydrogels,
and for positron emission tomography.

Hexadecyl platelet-activating factor has profound effects on the lung, and hexadecyl glyceryl ether participates in the biosynthesis of plasmalogens.

<text>Heptadecane is an organic compound, an alkane hydrocarbon with the chemical formula C17H36. The name may refer to any of 24894 theoretically possible structural isomers, or to a mixture thereof.

The unbranched isomer is normal or &quot;n&quot;-heptadecane, CH3(CH2)15CH3. In the IUPAC nomenclature, the name of this compound is simply heptadecane, since the other isomers are viewed and named as alkyl-substituted versions of smaller alkanes.

The most compact and branched isomer would be tetra-&quot;tert&quot;-butylmethane, but its existence is believed to be impossible due to steric hindrance. Indeed, it is believed to be the smallest &quot;impossible&quot; alkane.

<doc id="1034590" wikidata="Q951157" url="?curid=1034590" title="Toronto St. Michael's Majors">
<text>The Toronto St. Michael&#x27;s Majors were a Canadian major junior ice hockey team in the Ontario Hockey League, based in Toronto, Ontario. The most recent franchise was revived on August 15, 1996. In 2007, the team relocated to Mississauga, Ontario and became the Mississauga St. Michael&#x27;s Majors until 2012. The hockey program was founded and operated by St. Michael&#x27;s College School in 1906, and adopted the name &quot;Majors&quot; in 1934, and was commonly referred to as St. Mike&#x27;s Majors.

==History==
The St. Michael&#x27;s College Hockey Team was established in 1906 when the team joined the junior division of the Ontario Hockey Association. The team was not known as the St. Michael&#x27;s Majors until 1934, and also had the informal nickname of the &quot;Irish&quot;. The school team played for 55 years until 1961 before suspending operations.

St. Michael&#x27;s revived the Majors (Junior A Tier I) hockey team for the 1997–98 season in the Ontario Hockey League. In total, over one hundred St. Michael&#x27;s Majors alumni have gone on to play in the National Hockey League, including 13 members of the Hockey Hall of Fame.

===Early years, Allan Cup 1910===

The hockey team was founded and operated by St. Michael&#x27;s College School, a Catholic secondary school in uptown Toronto. The college&#x27;s hockey team soon blossomed, as demand for a Catholic program was high. The school competed with their crosstown rivals, the Protestant organized Toronto Marlborough Athletic Club for Toronto&#x27;s hockey supremacy. Players in the St. Michael&#x27;s Majors program, were also enrolled in the school.

St. Michael&#x27;s were successful in recruiting players and providing a complete education at the same time. The college built a strong reputation in moulding outstanding and well-rounded young citizens. Four years after the hockey program started, St. Michael&#x27;s were Canadian Amateur Champions, winning the Allan Cup in 1910.

;Birth of the Majors
In 1933, the Ontario Hockey Association&#x27;s Junior division, split into &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;B&#x27; levels. St. Michael&#x27;s also divided its hockey program into two teams accordingly. The Junior &#x27;A&#x27; team became the Majors, the Junior &#x27;B&#x27; team was known as St. Michael&#x27;s Buzzers.

===Memorial Cup 1934===
The Majors dominated the Junior A hockey scene during the 1933–34 season. The team was undefeated in the regular season, and kept rolling through the playoffs, the Ontario Championship, Eastern Canadian Championship and the Memorial Cup. Also of note, in 1933-34 the Buzzers won the Sutherland Cup as Ontario Junior &#x27;B&#x27; champions.

St. Michael&#x27;s featured the likes of Bobby Bauer, Reg Hamilton, Art Jackson, Regis (Pep) Kelly, Nick Metz, Don Wilson, Mickey Drouillard, goaltenders Harvey Teno and Jack Hamilton. The Toronto team was coached by Dr. W. J. (Jerry) Laflamme, a dentist who had quite a hockey history. He refereed in the NHL in the 1920s. That was after he had played defence on the Allan Cup winners from St. Michael&#x27;s in 1909-1910 and captained the Allan Cup-winning Dentals of Toronto in 1916–17.

In the 1934 playoffs St. Michael&#x27;s skated to 8–2, and 9-3 victories versus the Ottawa Shamrocks to win the two-game series for the Ontario title. In the following series, Toronto faced the Charlottetown Abegweits in the eastern final, played in Toronto. The Majors prevailed again in two games, by scores of 12-2 and 7–2.
The Memorial Cup final was played at Shea&#x27;s Amphitheatre in Winnipeg, where St. Michael&#x27;s faced the Edmonton Athletic Club in a best-of-three series for the title. The Majors picked up Turk Broda from the Winnipeg Monarchs to back up if goaltender Harvey Teno was injured. St. Mike&#x27;s opened with a 5–0 victory over the Athletics on April 3. More than 4,500 fans showed up for game 2 on April 5. St. Michael&#x27;s won its first Memorial Cup championship, with a 6–4 victory in overtime.

;1937 OHA Champions
St. Michael&#x27;s made their second trip to the OHA finals in 1937, and again faced the same opponent from in 1934, the Stratford Midgets. Toronto prevailed winning 3 games to 2. In the Ontario Championship, St. Michael&#x27;s faced a familiar foe in the Copper Cliff Redmen. The Redmen previously played in Newmarket in the same league as Toronto, but switched to NOHA. Toronto lost to the northern Ontario champions, in 2 straight games.

===Memorial Cup 1945===
Joe Primeau returned to coach the 1945 Memorial Cup St. Michael&#x27;s team, after being runners-up in the OHA finals in 1944. In 1945, Toronto won the J. Ross Robertson Cup, defeating the Galt Black Hawks in four games straight. The Majors advanced further by eliminating the Montreal Royals in six games in the eastern final. They won the sixth game 7-4 behind Joe Sadler&#x27;s three goals in front of 10,548 fans at Maple Leaf Gardens on April 11.

The Memorial Cup final was played in its entirety at Maple Leaf Gardens. The Majors&#x27; opponents were the Moose Jaw Canucks coached by Roy Bentley. Toronto won game one 8–5 on April 14, then Moose Jaw turned the tables on April 16 with a 5–3 victory to even the series. The Majors won each of the next three games by scores of 6–3, 4-3 and 7–2 in the deciding game. Trail, B.C. native Frank Turik scored three hat tricks in the five games to become the tournament&#x27;s leading goal scorer.

Paid attendance for the five games was 65,437, which exceeded the Maple Leaf Gardens junior record for five games (59,301) that had been set in 1943 when the Winnipeg Rangers tangled with the Oshawa Generals. That 1943 series still held the six-game record of 73,867.

===Memorial Cup 1946===
St. Michael&#x27;s returned to the Memorial Cup for a second consecutive year in 1946. The Majors defeated the Oshawa Generals in a six-game, coming back from two games behind for the OHA championship. St. Michael&#x27;s then swept the Montreal Junior Canadiens in three games straight in the eastern finals.

The Majors met up with the Winnipeg Monarchs at Maple Leaf Gardens on April 13 to start the best-of-seven series for the national championship. Winnipeg won the first game 3 to 2, then Toronto rallied to win the next two games 5 to 3, and 7 to 3, before the Monarchs even the series in game four, winning 4 to 3. Toronto scored a 7 to 4 victory in game five, needing only one more win to be the second team to repeat as Memorial Cup champions. Winnipeg spoiled the plans, winning consecutive 4 to 2 victories to take the cup back west in 1946.

===Memorial Cup 1947===

The 1947 cup would be a rematch of the 1945 Memorial Cup final versus the Moose Jaw Canucks. This series however, was not played at Maple Leaf Gardens, but rather played in Winnipeg, Moose Jaw and Regina. On the road to their third consecutive Memorial Cup appearance, St. Michael&#x27;s repeated their sweep of the Galt Black Hawks in the OHA finals from two 1945, and the previous year&#x27;s sweep on the Montreal Jr. Canadiens in the eastern finals.

The Memorial Cup&#x27;s best-of-seven final opened in Winnipeg on April 15 with Toronto hammering Moose Jaw 12 to 3. The teams then headed for Moose Jaw, where game two was to be played on April 17, at the newly constructed arena. Toronto St. Michael&#x27;s won that game 6 to 1. Game three was played in Regina, which Toronto kept up its momentum, winning 8 to 1. Game three ended with seven minutes to play in the third period, when the ice was littered for a second time with broken bottles thrown from the stands. Three nights later in Regina, St. Michael&#x27;s finished the series with a 3 to 2 victory, for their third Memorial Cup title.

===Memorial Cup 1961===
The Basilian fathers lobbied for a shortened schedule for the Majors in the OHA&#x27;s top tier of junior hockey after the 1958–59 season, since they believed it was too long and detrimental to academic studies for their students. Bob Goldham resigned as head coach of the Majors in 1960, and Father David Bauer took over as head coach for the 1960–61 OHA season in addition to his role as general manager. He stressed fundamentals of defensive play without the puck and taught players how to absorb contact without getting hurt. He occasionally had his players switch positions with one another to learn an appreciation of their teammate&#x27;s contributions. The Majors finished in second place during the season, then defeated the Guelph Royals in the playoffs for the OHA championship. The Majors won the Eastern Canada final defeating the Moncton Beavers then travelled to Edmonton to play in the 1961 Memorial Cup. The Majors defeated the Edmonton Oil Kings in six games and won the school&#x27;s fourth Memorial Cup.

==Majors cease operations==
The Basilian fathers again discussed the length of the season and the amount of travel having an effect on academics. They were also concerned with increasing physical play and growing similarities with professional leagues. The Majors had played 98 games including the regular season and playoffs for the Memorial Cup. St. Michael&#x27;s could no longer justify participation in the top tier of the OHA and chose to withdraw from the Ontario Hockey Association Junior A series. Bauer stated in a 1987 interview that, &quot;We regretted very much leaving because we knew that this [school] is a major recreational institution in this country&quot;.

After the official announcement on June 6, 1961, Bauer placed his protégé Jim Gregory in charge of the team. The Majors operated for one more season and played a shortened 33-game schedule in the Metro Junior A League for the 1961–62 OHA season. The team was transferred to Neil McNeil High School and became known as the Toronto Neil McNeil Maroons in 1962.

Conn Smythe and the Toronto Maple Leafs wanted to keep the St. Michael&#x27;s team in operation as a source of players, and then created the Metro Junior A League to help alleviate the college&#x27;s concerns.

The St. Michael&#x27;s team finished in first place in the Metro Junior A league, and competed for the J. Ross Robertson Cup again in 1962. Coached by Ted Flanagan, the team lost in the Cup finals to the Hamilton Red Wings.

Despite being the league champions in the 1961–62 season, St. Michael&#x27;s discontinued its program altogether, and the team was relocated to Neil McNeil Catholic Secondary School in Scarborough, Ontario, becoming the Toronto Neil McNeil Maroons. Father Bauer chose to pursue building a university-educated Canadian National Team instead.

==Modern era==
The modern era of the St. Michael&#x27;s Majors began on August 15, 1996, when the college was admitted to the OHL as an expansion team. Players were required to attend St. Michael&#x27;s College School in Toronto but this changed during the second season following player trade demands and refusals to attend. The team would take part each year in the Priority Selection drafting new players.

Founded by St. Michael&#x27;s College School, the team was now owned by Eugene Melnyk, who was the owner of the Ottawa Senators and was CEO of Biovail Corporation. Melnyk pursued several deals to get a new arena for his team, but none came to fruition. One of Melnyk&#x27;s foiled plans included purchasing Maple Leaf Gardens. The revived Majors struggled on the ice, and missed the playoffs in each of their first three seasons. During their second season, the Majors started strong, but traded four of their best players (Sheldon Keefe, Mike Jefferson, Ryan Barnes and Shawn Cation) to the Barrie Colts midway through the season, as a result of controversy surrounding David Frost.

The Majors made breakthroughs in their fourth season. Toronto reached the conference finals four consecutive years from 2001 to 2004. Their closest point to reaching the league finals was in 2003, leading 3 games to 2 versus the Ottawa 67&#x27;s and losing game six on home ice in overtime.

The Majors played on the smallest ice surface in the OHL, which tended to have a higher average of shots on goal per game than other arenas. Fittingly, the Majors produced several noted goaltenders in their recent history, including Peter Budaj, Andy Chiodo and Justin Peters.

The Majors had strong rivalries with the Mississauga IceDogs and Brampton Battalion, both of which are local Greater Toronto Area teams who came into the OHL within a year of the Majors.

On July 12, 2006, Eugene Melnyk bought the Mississauga IceDogs. After the 2006–07 season, Melnyk sold the IceDogs, and moved the Majors to the Hershey Centre in Mississauga. The IceDogs, in turn, moved to Jack Gatecliff Arena in St. Catharines, Ontario.

===Memorial Cup 2011===
The Majors won the right to host the 2011 Memorial Cup over the Barrie Colts, Kingston Frontenacs and Windsor Spitfires. The Ontario Hockey League (OHL) announced on May 10, 2010 that the Mississauga St. Michael&#x27;s Majors were chosen to host the 93rd annual Memorial Cup at the Hershey Centre from May 20–29, 2011. The Saint John Sea Dogs defeated the Majors 3–1 in the final.

==Uniforms and logos==
The primary logo for the Majors displays &quot;St. Michael&#x27;s&quot; written in script, with a Majors underscore written in light blue. The Toronto St. Michael&#x27;s Majors colours are light blue, navy blue &amp; white. The Majors hockey uniforms feature a different logo, a large letter &quot;M&quot; on the front, with the school crest (inset right) on the upper left chest, and the St. Michael&#x27;s cloverleaf patch on the shoulders.

Home uniforms have a white background, navy blue shoulders and arms, with light blue trim. Road uniforms have a light blue background, with navy blue shoulders, and white trim. The Majors have also used a third jersey with a stylized &quot;M&quot; on the front, and without the navy blue shoulders.

To celebrate the Majors 10th season back in the league, the team launched a new 3rd jersey with the shoulder cloverleaf logo on the front. The jersey is also baby blue in colour. After the move, the Majors&#x27; logo was changed slightly to a more modernized look, and new jerseys were unveiled.

==Arenas==
The St. Michael&#x27;s Majors play at the school-owned St. Michael&#x27;s College School Arena. The arena is located in uptown Toronto near the intersection of Bathurst Street and St. Clair Avenue behind St. Michael&#x27;s College School. The college arena is by far the smallest in the Ontario Hockey League in terms of both ice size and seating. The arena is also home to the St. Michael&#x27;s Buzzers of the Ontario Provincial Junior A Hockey League.

The St. Michael&#x27;s Majors played at Maple Leaf Gardens for their first three seasons from 1997 to 2000. The original Majors had played at Maple Leaf Gardens from its construction in 1931 to their folding in the early 1960s. When the Gardens was scheduled to close a year after the last Toronto Maple Leafs game, Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment evicted the Majors, who moved to the arena on the college campus. The major junior team had only played there rarely before.

The Majors also played selected home games during the 1999–00 season at the Air Canada Centre vs the Mississauga IceDogs and Brampton Battalion, and also an inter-league game versus the Montreal Rocket.

In 2003-04 and 2006–07 seasons, the Majors played two home games vs the Ottawa 67&#x27;s at Scotiabank Place in Kanata, Ontario. This arose from the common ownership between the St. Michael&#x27;s Majors and the Ottawa Senators by Eugene Melnyk.

The Mississauga St. Michael&#x27;s Majors played home games at the Hershey Centre in northeast Mississauga, near the junction of Highway 401 &amp; Highway 403. The Hershey Centre hosted the OHL All-Star Game in 2000. The arena also hosted the 2011 Memorial Cup from May 19–29.

<text>Wild Reeds () is a 1994 French drama film directed by André Téchiné about the sexual awakening of four teenagers and their subsequent sensitive passage into adulthood at the end of the Algerian War. The film was selected as the French entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 67th Academy Awards, but not nominated.

==Plot==
The film is set in southwest France in 1962. François (Gaël Morel), a shy young man from the lower middle class, is working towards his high school diploma. He spends most of his time talking about movies and literature with his best friend, Maïté (Élodie Bouchez), whose mother Mme Alvarez (Michèle Moretti) is François&#x27;s French teacher. Mme Alvarez and Maïté are communists. At the boarding school, François becomes acquainted with Serge (Stéphane Rideau), the sensual son of immigrant farmers. At night, he joins François in the dormitory to chat. Finally, Serge draws François into an erotic relationship.

François discovers his homosexuality and develops a deep attraction for Serge, who has only acted out of curiosity. François confides this discovery to Maïté, who swallows her disappointment and encourages him to come out of the closet. When Serge becomes increasingly interested in Maïté, she declares herself to be interested in nobody.

Serge&#x27;s brother Pierre dies while serving in the army in Algeria, and Maïté&#x27;s mother suffers a nervous breakdown, having previously refused to help Pierre desert. An Algerian-born French exile, Henri (Frédéric Gorny), enrolls in the boys&#x27; boarding school and aggravates their conflicts, adding a political conflict. He is obsessed with events in Algeria and supports the OAS, which opposes Algerian independence and defends the rights of French settlers there. He treats François without sympathy and bluntly tells him to own up to his homosexuality. His political stance provokes Serge&#x27;s hatred. Henri finally engages Maïté, his political opposite, and they yield to their mutual attraction.

Each member of the quartet develops in the course of the film, shifting repeatedly from stubborn positions to more flexible appreciations of their circumstances, explained in French class by a reading of &quot;The Oak and the Reed&quot;, one of La Fontaine&#x27;s Fables.

==Cast==

* Gaël Morel as François Forestier

==Production==
The project was first conceived as part of a television film series dealing with adolescence, &quot;Tous les garçons et les filles de leurs âges&quot;, entitled &quot;Le chêne et le roseau&quot; (&quot;The Oak and the Reed&quot;), which made up the first 55 minutes of &quot;Wild Reeds&quot;. But after completing the script, Téchiné decided to make it a full theatrical release. Based on his own life story, it is his biggest personal success in France and his most intimate film.

It is one of limited number of films on the politically delicate subject of the Algerian War. They include &quot;The Little Soldier&quot; (1963), &quot;Avoir vingt ans dans les Aurès&quot; (1972), and &quot;La Question&quot; (1977).

<text>Finksburg is an unincorporated community in Carroll County, Maryland, United States. It is the location of the National Security Agency&#x27;s EKMS Central Facility. Finksburg is located at the intersection of Maryland Routes 91 and 140, on the border of Carroll and Baltimore counties. It is an unincorporated area approximately one mile northwest of the Liberty Reservoir and six miles southeast of Westminster.

Finksburg is named after Adam Fink, who built the first house and was owner of a local tavern and toll road in the early 19th century.

== Modern day ==
The Finksburg community is protected by the Gamber and Reese Community Volunteer Fire Stations, as well as Sykesville-Freedom District Fire Department.

The area is served by Sandymount Elementary, Shiloh Middle, and Westminster High Schools. Gerstell Academy, an independent K-12 school is also located in Finksburg. Across the street sits the 13,805 sq. ft. Finksburg Branch of the Carroll County Public Library which opened in 2009 and &quot;was the first green building in Carroll County&quot; 

Finksburg is host to the Roaring Run Community Park, a small sports complex with four baseball diamonds, as well as Sandymount Park which features walking paths, tennis courts, a basketball court, playground, three baseball diamonds, and six grass athletic fields. 
The Greater Baltimore Hindu-Jain Temple and the Evergreen Memorial Gardens cemetery are located in Finksburg.

&quot;Car 54, Where Are You?&quot; and &quot;Munsters&quot; actor Fred Gwynne is interred at the Sandy Mount United Methodist Church&#x27;s cemetery in an unmarked grave. Finksburg was referenced in Season 5, Episode 9 of the television comedy Brooklyn Nine-Nine.

Yearly, the Baltimore Ravens training camp hosts practice in Owings Mills, several miles away. Former Ravens players Torrey Smith and Haloti Ngata lived locally.

==Transportation==
The Owings Mills station of the Baltimore Metro SubwayLink in nearby Owings Mills, Baltimore County, is a 15-minute drive by car from Finksburg and provides subway access to downtown Baltimore.

== History ==

* 1838 - Finksburg becomes a part of the newly created Carroll County Maryland following an act of the 1837 Maryland Legislature from portions of Baltimore County and Frederick County. The County is named after the last surviving signer of the Declaration of Independence who died in 1836 Charles Carroll of Carollton. 

* 1849 – Edward Remington and the Patapsco Mining Company opened cobalt mines near Finksburg 
* 1855 – Western Maryland Railroad reached Finksburg
* 1856 – A. L. Hoover was postmaster of Finksburg, earning $63.60 for the year
* 1858 – Cobalt mining was unprofitable and mines were closed for financial reasons
* 1866 – Baseball was the most popular sport, the &quot;Star&quot; of Finksburg was the local club (team) 
* 1873 – The Alpha Farmers&#x27; Club of Carroll County was established 
* 1881 – The Finksburg Literary Society organized lecturers for Friday night meetings at the Mechanics&#x27; Hall. Admission was 5 cents.

* 1913 - The Western Maryland Railroad changes the name of their Finksburg station to &quot;Asbestos&quot; in respect for the nearby Baltimore Roofing and Asbestos Company, to the consternation of local residents. This led to the area by the station, a half mile from town, being called Asbestos, Maryland at least into the 1930s, over a decade after the asbestos plant closed. (This area is now called &quot;Cedarhurst&quot;.)
* 1935 – Sandymount Elementary School began as a three-room stone building consolidating the smaller one room schools of Reese, Bethel, and Sandymount Finksburg, Emory School house Patapsco School house and East View School house Deer Park

<text>Ahmed Dini Ahmed (, ; 1932 – 12 September 2004) was a Djiboutian politician who served as the second Prime Minister of Djibouti. He was trained as a health technician and entered the political realm at age 26. 

He served as Vice-president of the Representative Council of French Somaliland from April 1959 to June 1960, he was a member of the government of Ali Aref Bourhan in 1962–1964, he then participated in the foundation of the Afar Democratic Union (UDA). He was Minister of Home Affairs until 1971. In 1975, he became spokesman for the new African People&#x27;s League for Independence (LPAI), led by Hassan Gouled Aptidon. He was elected President of National Assembly from 13 May 1977 to 13 July 1977. He was succeeded by Saad Warsama Dirie.

In July 1977, he became the Prime Minister of the newly independent Djibouti. In December, after the bombing of the Palm in Zinc, and the consequent ban on the Movement for the Liberation (MPL), he resigned and returned to the opposition. He led the Front for the Restoration of Unity and Democracy (FRUD), an Afar rebel group, during the civil war of the 1990s; after the group split in 1994, he led a radical faction of FRUD.

==Biography==
Ahmed, a member of the Afar ethnic group, was born near Mount Mabla in the northern Djibouti. Following independence, Ahmed became Prime Minister as well Minister in charge of Urban and Regional Planning (&quot;Aménagement du territoire&quot;) and the Creation of New Resources in July 1977. He resigned from the position six months later after clashing with President Hassan Gouled Aptidon.

==Later years==
He led FRUD in its armed struggle against the government, which began in 1991. He led the movement that engaged in a desert war against Issa domination which surfaced soon after independence was established. FRUD split in 1994, and a moderate faction led by Ali Mohamed Daoud entered negotiations with the government (signing a peace agreement in December 1994), while Ahmed continued to lead a radical faction which vowed to continue to fight. The radical faction held a congress in late September 1994 and elected Dini as head of its executive committee. Following the signing of a reconciliation agreement between his faction and the government in February 2000, Dini returned to Djibouti from Yemen on 29 March 2000, ending nine years of exile.

In the January 2003 parliamentary election, he was the first candidate on the candidate list of the opposition coalition, the Union for a Democratic Alternative (UAD), in the District of Djibouti; however, the coalition did not win any seats.

He died on 12 September 2004 at a French military hospital in Djibouti.

<text>Icosane (alternative spelling eicosane and eichosane) is an alkane with the chemical formula C20H42. It has 366,319 constitutional isomers.

&quot;n&quot;-Icosane (the straight-chain structural isomer of icosane) is the shortest compound found in paraffin waxes used to form candles.

Icosane&#x27;s size, state or chemical inactivity does not exclude it from the traits its smaller alkane counterparts have. It is a colorless, non-polar molecule, nearly unreactive except when it burns. It is less dense than and insoluble in water. Its non-polar trait means it can only perform weak intermolecular bonding (hydrophobic/van der Waals forces).

Icosane&#x27;s phase transition at a moderate temperature makes it a candidate phase change material, or PCM which can be used to store thermal energy and control temperature. 

It can be detected in the body odor of persons suffering from Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

==Naming==
IUPAC currently recommends icosane, whereas Chemical Abstracts Service and Beilstein use eicosane.

<text>The Windsor Spitfires are a Canadian junior ice hockey team in the Ontario Hockey League (OHL). The team is based in Windsor, Ontario, Canada. Founded in 1971, the franchise was promoted to the Ontario Major Junior Hockey League for the 1975–76 season. An unrelated Windsor Spitfires team, founded in 1946, moved to become the Hamilton Tiger Cubs in 1953, and later became the Erie Otters in 1996.

==History==
The original Spitfires in the Ontario Hockey Association played from 1945 to 1953. The name &quot;Spitfires&quot; was chosen to honour the 417 Combat Support Squadron, a Royal Canadian Air Force squadron nicknamed &quot;City of Windsor&quot; established during World War II in England (today based at CFB Cold Lake in Alberta), and used the Supermarine Spitfire fighter aircraft. During this period the Spitfires reached the league finals twice, and featured four future Hockey Hall of Fame players. Prior to 1945, local junior hockey was divided up into the six-team Windsor Junior Hockey League. The Spitfires folded in 1953 as hockey interests in Windsor chose to focus their attention on the OHA Senior A Hockey League, which resulted in the founding of the Windsor Bulldogs. Eventually five former Spitfires laced up with the Bulldogs and one, Bobby Brown, won an Allan Cup with the team (1963). The Bulldogs folded in 1964 after one season in the International Hockey League.

===Tier II Junior A===
The modern Windsor Spitfires started as a Tier II Junior A team that played in the Southern Ontario Junior A Hockey League from 1971 to 1975. The Spitfires first game as a franchise was in Guelph, Ontario, against the Guelph CMC&#x27;s on October 1, 1971. The Spitfires lost the game 11–3, with Laurie Gregan scoring the first two goals in team history in the first period. Fifteen-year-old goaltender Larry Verlinde played the entire first game in team history, making 37 saves in the loss. The home game and first victory in team history occurred on October 7, 1971, at the Windsor Arena against the Chatham Maroons, winning 4–2 on the back of future NHL goaltender Eddie Mio who made 49 saves. Dean Sheremeta scored the winning goal.

The Spitfires finished their first season with a record of 21 wins, 32 losses, and 3 ties. Finishing sixth place out of eight teams, the Spitfires drew local rival Chatham Maroons in a best-of-seven league quarter-final. The Maroons, who finished third with 33 wins, 17 losses, and 6 ties, were favoured to win. The Spitfires&#x27; first playoff game took place on February 23, 1972, in Chatham, Ontario, for a 3–2 win over the Maroons to take a one-game lead in the series. Goaltender Bryan Rose made 35 saves in the winning effort, while the Spits&#x27; first playoff goal and later winning goals were scored by Wolf Hiesl, both in the second period. The Spitfires lost the next four games to the Maroons to end their season.

The 1972–73 season, the Spitfires second season, finished with their first winning record – 30 wins, 21 losses, and 9 ties. Finishing third in a league of seven teams, the Spitfires drew the fourth place Niagara Falls Flyers (28–25–7) in the league quarter-final. The Spits dropped game one 6–4 in Niagara Falls, while in game two the Spits tied the series with a 6–4 win of their own at home. Back in Niagara, the Flyers shellacked the Spitfires 7–2 to take the series lead again. The fourth game was a disaster for the Spitfires, at home they blew a third period deadlock to lose 7–5 and fall behind in the series 3-games-to-1. In game five, the Spitfires needed to make a change. Future IHLer Tony Piroski and partner Jean Pominville had uninspired starts in games three and four and were replaced by third-string goalie, and future NHLer, Rick Heinz. Heinz had spent the season in Junior B with the Spitfires&#x27; farm team Windsor Royals and was new to the pressure of Junior A playoff hockey. The gamble paid off, as an inspired Spitfire squad won the game 9-4 while Heinz capped of a 24-save night for the victory. In game six, coach Jerry Serviss returned to his starting goalie, Tony Piroski, in net on the road. Piroski rewarded his coach&#x27;s confidence with a 5–4, 33-save victory - evening the series at 3 games each. Mark Smith scored the eventual game winner for the Spitfires. Game seven saw the two teams return for a final showdown at the Windsor Arena. The Spitfires would take the game 6–3 in front of a capacity crowd of 5,189 fans. The victory, winning in seven games, was the Spitfires&#x27; first ever playoff series victory. Waiting for them, rested for the semi-final, was the first place Guelph Biltmore Mad Hatters (39–13–8). The Biltmores, defending National Champions, made short work of the Spitfires sweeping them in four games.
The 1973–74 season would prove to be the defining moment of the Spitfires stint in Tier II Junior A. Headed by new head coach and general manager Wayne Maxner, the Spitfires won the Southern Ontario Junior A regular season title with a record of 39 wins, 15 losses, and 8 ties. Their record would put them four points ahead of the second place Welland Sabres and automatically give them a berth into the league playoff semi-finals. Scott Miller would win the SOJHL scoring title with 73 goals and 125 points over the course of the season. The Spitfires semi-final opponent was their cross-river rival Detroit Jr. Red Wings. The Red Wings had finished the season in fifth out of eight teams (31–25–6). The semi-final opened up at the Windsor Arena with a 7–1 win for the Spitfires. They were at the Detroit Olympia for game two, another romp for Windsor as they won 8–0. Back in Windsor, the Spitfires won game three 9–2. At the Olympia for game four, the Red Wings attempted to stage some resistance, but the Spitfires were too much, winning 7–5. The four-game sweep of the Red Wings allowed Windsor to rest up for the winner of the Chatham Maroons and Welland Sabres, a series just starting. On March 16, 1974, the Spitfires engaged long time foe Chatham Maroons at the Windsor Arena in the first game of the SOJHL Final. The Maroons fell in that first game 6–1, but rebounded the next night in Chatham with a 5–2 victory of their own. On March 18, goalie Dennis Thorpe&#x27;s 40 save performance and third period game winner by Gary Armstrong gave the Spitfires a 2–1 home victory and a lead in the series. The Spitfires took game four in Chatham with a 6–4 win. The next night, March 21, the Spitfires defeated the Maroons in Windsor 4–3 to clinch the SOJHL playoff championship. Gary Armstrong would score yet another winning goal in the series. Before a crowd of 5,117 fans, team captain Hugh Mitchell hoisted the Jack Oakes Memorial Trophy to celebrate their playoff victory. The Spitfires were now in the hunt for the 1974 Centennial Cup, the National Championship of Tier II Junior A hockey. The first team in their way, in the Dudley Hewitt Cup Eastern Canada playdowns was the Wexford Raiders of the Ontario Provincial Junior A Hockey League. Also on the line was the Ontario Hockey Association Junior A championship, the Buckland Cup. The Spitfires took game one in Rexdale with a 4–2 victory. Back in Windsor the next night, the Spitfires seemed to have the series in control with a 5–2 win. The Raiders had other things in mind, winning at home in game three 6–2 and then taking it to Windsor in their own arena 4–1 to tie the series. Back in Rexdale, the Raiders crushed the Spitfires with an 8–2 victory. With their back against the wall, the Spits had to win at home to force game seven. A 7–5 victory for the Spitfires turned this into a series for the ages. On April 6, 1974, the Spitfires season came to an end, as the Wexford Raiders took a 6–3 victory at home to advance to the next round of national playdowns. Scott Miller would be named the team&#x27;s most valuable player.

The Windsor Spitfires applied for expansion to the OMJHL (later known as the OHL) during their 1974 playoff run, but were rejected due to the &quot;unacceptability of Windsor Arena as a major A facility.&quot; Their farm team, the Windsor Royals Junior B team of the Great Lakes Junior Hockey League put in a rival bid but were also rejected due to lack of an acceptable arena.

In 1974–75, Jim Butcher coached the Spits to a second straight regular season title with a record of 40 wins, 15 losses, and 5 ties, 11 points ahead of the second place Welland Sabres (30–16–14). John Tavella won the league scoring title with 54 goals and 117 points and goaltender Floyd St. Cyr led the league with the fewest goals against. The Spitfires&#x27; first opponent in the playoff semi-final was the last place Detroit Jr. Red Wings (15–38–9). At home, the Spits took game one 11–2. Back at the Detroit Olympia, the Spits won 8–2. Again in Windsor, the Spits took game three 10–1. The Spits had the chance to clinch in game four, but the Red Wings refused to let their season end in front of their Detroit faithful winning 5–3. Game five, in Windsor, Ian Campbell would score a late third period tally to break a 2–2 deadlock and send the Spitfires to the league finals. The fourth place Guelph Bilmores (23–31–6) stood in the way of the Spitfires. The Biltmores had upset the second place Welland Sabres in the league quarter-final in five games and the third place Chatham Maroons 8-points-to-6 (3 wins, 2 losses, 2 ties) and were looking to shock the Spitfires too. The Biltmores had caused trouble for the Spitfires all season as their head-to-head record was 5 wins each and 2 ties in 12 matches. After a week layoff, the Spitfires were up against a hot opponent and were missing scoring champion John Tavella to a three-games suspension for butt-ending against Detroit. The Spits dropped the first game, at home, 6–5 after giving up a late 2-on-1 odd-man rush late in the third period. The next night, in Guelph, the Spitfires led 6–1 in the first and 8–4 in the second to blow the lead in the third and finish with a 9–9 overtime tie. The Spitfires tied up the series in game three with a 4–2 win in Windsor. In Guelph for game four, the Spitfires blew a first period 3–0 lead to lose 6–4. Game five saw the Spitfires tie the series at five points a piece with an 8–4 win at home. Guelph again gained the advantage in game six with a 6–4 win at home. In a last gasp for air, the Spitfires fought to win a 6–4 decision in Windsor to tie the series at 7 points each and force a final eighth game - winner take all. The eighth game proved to be the Spitfires&#x27; last game of Tier II Junior A, as they traveled to Guelph and blew a 3–0 lead to lose the game (6–5) and the series (9-points-to-7) to end their four-year trek in the Southern Ontario Junior A Hockey League.

The Spitfires were granted entry into the OMJHL (later known as the OHL) as an expansion franchise for the 1975–76 OMJHL season in February 1975. The league&#x27;s board of governors unanimously accepted the Spitfires despite their arena&#x27;s surface being smaller than Major Junior A standards. The Spitfires&#x27; had pumped $200,000 into the arena over the past two years, so the league overlooked the surface size despite taking issue with it in their 1974 rejection of the Spitfires&#x27; expansion bid.

===Major Junior===
On September 25, 1975, Major Junior hockey returned to the Windsor Arena for the first time in twenty-two years. In front of 4,335 fans, the Windsor Spitfires hosted the Oshawa Generals. The game would be an eye-opener for the Spitfires, as they were defeated 10–1 by the Generals. Wayne Mills started in net for the Spits, but would be later relieved by back-up Bob Parent when the Generals made it 7–0 at 11:29 of the second period. The two goaltenders combined for 30 saves, as the Spits were outshot 40–23. Rolly Hedges scored the first Major Junior goal in team history at 18:48 of the second period.

On October 2, 1975, the Spitfires would tally their first ever Major Junior win. At home, the Spits were hosting the Sudbury Wolves. Despite being outshot 60–34, the Spitfires overcame a six-goal deficit to defeat the Wolves 11–10. After trailing 7–1 only 2:49 into the second period, the Spitfires were able to chip the lead down to 9–7 by the second intermission. Charlie Skjodt scored to make it 9–9 to complete the comeback, just to have the Wolves score with 6:33 to go in the game to make it 10–9. Charles Bosnyak, a member of the 1974–75 Tier II Spitfires, scored 32 seconds later to make it 10–10 and captain Mark Perras scored with 43 seconds remaining to win the Spits&#x27; first ever Major Junior game. Bob Parent would make 50 saves to cap off the historic victory.

The &quot;Spits&quot; as they are commonly known, won their first Emms division title in 1980 and reached the OHL finals, but lost to the Peterborough Petes. Ernie Godden set an all-time OHL record in 1980–81 scoring 87 goals. In 1984 Peter Karmanos, the founder and CEO of Compuware, bought the team and renamed them the Windsor Compuware Spitfires.

In the 1987–88 season, the culmination of a well-executed four-year plan saw the Compuware Spitfires win 35 of their last 36 games, become the first team to go undefeated in the OHL playoffs, and sweep the Peterborough Petes in the OHL Championship finals to win the J. Ross Robertson Cup. During the season, the Compuware Spitfires were dominant, with a record of 54-0 when leading after two periods. Having earned the right to represent the OHL in the 1988 Memorial Cup hosted in Chicoutimi, Quebec, the Compuware Spitfires advanced to the Championship game, where their string of success ended, losing to the Medicine Hat Tigers.

Karmanos sold the team to local construction magnate Steve Riolo after the 1988–89 season, and the team reverted the Windsor Spitfires name and adopted their modern logo.

===Conflict, renewal, tragedy===
On October 18, 2005, Head Coach Moe Mantha was handed a 40-game suspension and later terminated without pay, for a hazing incident that occurred aboard a bus after a pre-season game versus the London Knights. An altercation involving players Steve Downie and Akim Aliu, in which Aliu lost four teeth, led to public exposure of the compulsive hazing within the Spitfires organization. Downie was traded to the Peterborough Petes, and Aliu was traded to the Sudbury Wolves.

On April 6, 2006, the Ontario Hockey League Board of Governors announced the approval of a new ownership group for the Windsor Spitfires, composed of Bob Boughner, Warren Rychel and Peter Dobrich. All three men had history in Windsor with OHL hockey, and the group had expressed hope to move the team into a new arena. Boughner assumed the roles of President, CEO and head coach of the Spitfires, Rychel was named director of player development, and Dobrich the new business manager.

On February 18, 2008, team captain and Calgary Flames prospect Mickey Renaud died of an undetected heart condition in his Tecumseh, Ontario, home. General Manager Warren Rychel referred to Renaud&#x27;s death as &quot;the biggest tragedy in Spitfire history&quot;. His number was retired by both the Spitfires and the Tecumseh Chiefs Junior B franchise that he played on before graduating to Major Junior. Mayor Eddie Francis named a road leading to the WFCU Centre in Renaud&#x27;s honour, &quot;Mickey Renaud Way&quot;. At the 2009 OHL All-Star Game at the WFCU Centre in Windsor, OHL Commissioner David Branch announced that the Mickey Renaud Captain&#x27;s Trophy would be awarded to the &quot;team captain that best exemplifies leadership on and off the ice as well as hard work, passion and dedication to the game of hockey and their community&quot; in honour of Renaud.

===2008–09 season===
The Windsor Spitfires finished the 2008–09 season with 57 wins, 10 losses, and 1 shootout loss. This marked their best season in franchise history. With the first overall record in the Ontario Hockey League the Spitfires were awarded the Hamilton Spectator Trophy. The Spitfires also played their final games in the Windsor Arena. The Spits were undefeated at home in the Old Barn during the 2008–09 season. Mid-season they moved to the WFCU Centre. The Spitfires and their new arena played host to the 2009 All-Star Game. On May 12, Goalie Andrew Engelage broke the OHL record for most wins by a goaltender in a single season with 46 with a 5–1 win over the Plymouth Whalers.

In the first round of the playoffs, the Spitfires walked all over the Owen Sound Attack, taking the series in four games. In the next round, the Spits found the Plymouth Whalers to be a more formidable opponent. After trading off-road wins, then trading off home wins, the Spits took Games 5 and 6 to clinch the series. In the Western Conference final, the Spits played their nemesis the London Knights. Led by John Tavares, the Knights were a tough opponent. Every game in the series went to overtime, but the Spitfires were victorious and won the series 4-games-to-1 to earn a berth to the OHL Final and take the Wayne Gretzky Trophy as Conference champions. The OHL Final began with a 10–1 victory for the Spitfires over the Eastern Conference&#x27;s Brampton Battalion led by stars Cody Hodgson and Matt Duchene. The series became much tighter from there as the Spits took Game 2 5–3. The Battalion fought back in Game 3, winning 4–2. Game 4 belonged to the Spitfires as they took a 4–1 win and a 3–1 series lead. Game 5 was a tight affair, as the Spitfires took a 1–0 lead midway through the second period on the power play. Brampton tied the game up late in the third period to force overtime. At 2:09 of the first overtime period, Taylor Hall scored on the power play to win the Spitfires their second J. Ross Robertson Cup as league champions and a berth into the 2009 Memorial Cup. The victory was the Spitfires&#x27; first league title since the 1987–88 OHL season and marked their second time playing for the Memorial Cup. On May 9, Mayor of Windsor Eddie Francis awarded the team with the Key to the City in honour of their achievement.

At the 2009 Memorial Cup, the Spitfires dropped their first two games in Rimouski 3–2 in overtime to the Drummondville Voltigeurs and 5–4 to the Rimouski Océanic. In a do-or-die game, the Spitfires won the final game of the round robin 2–1 over the Kelowna Rockets to gain entry to the tie-breaker game. In the tie-breaker, Windsor defeated the hometown Océanic 6-4 powered by a third period natural hat-trick by Dale Mitchell. The tournament semi-final was between the Spitfires and the Voltigeurs. The Spitfires blew an early 2–0 lead, but won 3–2 in overtime from a goal by Adam Henrique to become the second team ever to play in the Memorial Cup final after playing in the tie-breaker game. In the final, the Spitfires again played the Rockets. The Spitfires scored on their first three shots and cruised to a 4–1 win to take their first ever Memorial Cup championship. Their victory marked the first time a team started with two losses in the Memorial Cup round robin and came back to win the championship. The feat also marks the first time that a team has survived the Memorial Cup tie-breaker game to win the championship. The Stafford Smythe Memorial Trophy was awarded to Taylor Hall as Memorial Cup playoffs most valuable player. Both Ryan Ellis and Hall were elected to the tournament&#x27;s All-Star Team. Throughout the Memorial Cup tournament, the Spitfires hung Mickey Renaud&#x27;s jersey on their bench and the championship was won in Renaud&#x27;s memory.

In the aftermath of the championship, the team was met at the Windsor Airport by a large contingent of local fans and was addressed by Mayor Eddie Francis. It was announced that the road to the new WFCU Centre would be renamed &quot;Memorial Cup Drive&quot; in honour of the victory.

===2009–10 season===
The Spitfires came back in 2009–10 with a second straight 50-plus win season, finishing with a record of 50 wins, 12 losses, 1 overtime loss, and 5 shootout losses. Their record was good enough to earn the top seed in the Western Conference, but not good enough to clinch their second straight Hamilton Spectator Trophy, won by the Barrie Colts (57-9-0-2). For being the top team in their division, the Spitfires were awarded their second straight Bumbacco Trophy. Taylor Hall tied Tyler Seguin of the Plymouth Whalers for the league&#x27;s scoring lead, and both were awarded the Eddie Powers Memorial Trophy as scoring co-champions. The Spitfires also played host to the CHL Top Prospects Game.

The Spitfires sent six players to the 2010 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships. Defenceman Ryan Ellis and forwards Taylor Hall, Adam Henrique, and Greg Nemisz played for silver medalist Canada, defenceman Cam Fowler played for gold medalist United States, and forward Richard Panik played for Slovakia. At the end of the tournament, the Spitfires acquired defenceman Marc Cantin, forward Stephen Johnston and German goaltender Philipp Grubauer from the Belleville Bulls in exchange for forwards Panik and Austen Brassard, defenceman Paul Bezzo, goaltender Steve Gleeson and a seventh-round pick in the 2012 OHL Priority Selection.

In the first round of the OHL playoffs, the Spitfires swept the Erie Otters in four games. They then swept the Plymouth Whalers in four games to win their Conference Semi-Final. In the other semi-final, the Kitchener Rangers upset the favoured London Knights in seven games. In the Conference Finals against Kitchener, Windsor initially struggled, losing the first three games of the series. However, the Spitfires went on to become the third team in Ontario Hockey League history to come back from a three-game deficit to win a playoff series, beating Rangers in each of the next four games to win the conference championship and the Wayne Gretzky Trophy. Notably, the Spitfires had recovered from a 3–0 deficit to win a playoff series once before, in a 2004–05 Conference Quarterfinal series against the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds. In the league final, the Spitfires made quick work of a highly touted Barrie Colts squad, sweeping them in four games to win their second straight J. Ross Robertson Cup. Adam Henrique won the Wayne Gretzky 99 Award as the playoffs&#x27; most valuable player.

In May, the Spitfires traveled to Brandon, Manitoba, for the 2010 Memorial Cup. The Spitfires trampled the host Brandon Wheat Kings 9–3 in their first game of the tournament and, in their second game, scored a convincing 6–2 win over the Western Hockey League champion Calgary Hitmen. With their victory over the Hitmen, the Spitfires clinched a berth in the Memorial Cup final. They did not need to defeat the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League&#x27;s Moncton Wildcats in their third and final round-robin game, but did so anyway, winning 4–3 in overtime. The tournament final saw the Spitfires play the host Wheat Kings for a second time. The Spitfires posted a convincing win once again, defeating the Wheat Kings 9–1 to clinch their second straight Memorial Cup. Their victory marked their twelfth straight win since going down 0–3 to Kitchener in the OHL&#x27;s Western Conference Final, and they finished the playoffs with 20 wins against just 3 losses. Taylor Hall won his second straight Stafford Smythe Memorial Trophy as Memorial Cup most valuable player, making him the first repeat winner in the trophy&#x27;s history.

===2010–11 season===
After two straight Memorial Cups, the Summer of 2010 saw leading scorer Taylor Hall go first overall in the 2010 NHL Entry Draft to the Edmonton Oilers and Coach Bob Boughner accepted an assistant coaching job with the National Hockey League&#x27;s Columbus Blue Jackets. The Spitfires have engaged in a massive overhaul involving many trades.

During the exhibition season, the Spitfires hosted the Czech Under-20 National Team. The Spitfires came back to win the game 5–4. Spitfires finished the exhibition schedule with 4 wins 1 loss and 1 tie.

After another successful season the Spits finished 4th in the Western Conference to advance to the playoffs. The Spitfires reached the Conference Final for the third consecutive year. Following two hard fought battles the Spits were eliminated from the playoffs for the first time in three years by the Owen Sound Attack. The Attack went on to win the OHL Championship.

===2011–12 season===
After one season with the Columbus Blue Jackets as assistant coach, Bob Boughner returned to the Spitfires as head coach, with Bob Jones remaining on the staff as his assistant.

On August 10, 2012, the Spitfires were fined an unprecedented $400,000 CAD by the Ontario Hockey League and forfeited five first round OHL Priority Draft picks in 2013, 2014, and 2016 and second round picks in 2015 and 2017 for unspecified recruitment violations. The Spitfires claimed innocence to the recruitment violations and plan to appeal the decision.

===2013–14 season===
On December 29, 2013, the Spitfires and the Saginaw Spirit played the first ever outdoor game in Ontario Hockey League history. The game was played at Comerica Park in Detroit, Michigan. The Spitfires won the game 6–5 in front of a short-lived Canadian Hockey League record of 25,749 spectators, surpassed later that night by the London Knights and Plymouth Whalers at the same venue.

===2014–15 season===
On June 28, 2015, Spitfires owner and head coach Bob Boughner accepted another assistant coaching job with the NHL&#x27;s San Jose Sharks. A couple of days later, former Oilers assistant coach Rocky Thompson was hired as the Spitfires new head coach, with Trevor Letowski accepting the assistant coaching job after former assistant coach Bob Jones was hired by the Oshawa Generals as head coach. Boughner&#x27;s new job seemed to be very successful, as he and former Spitfire Peter DeBoer lead the team to the 2016 Stanley Cup Finals, losing to the Pittsburgh Penguins.

===2016–17 season===
Windsor was selected as the host city for the 99th Memorial Cup championship, who won the right to host the tournament over undisclosed competition. In defeating the Seattle Thunderbirds by 7–1 in a round-robin game on May 21, 2017, the Windsor Spitfires tied a Memorial Cup record for the fastest 3 goals scored by a team in a single period (38 game seconds), matching the record set by the WHL&#x27;s New Westminster Bruins in the 1978 tournament. The tournament ended with the Windsor Spitfires winning their third Memorial Cup, defeating the Erie Otters 4–3 in the championship final.

On December 4, 2016, the Saginaw Spirit hosted the Spitfires in front of a crowd of over 3,100 people in the closing of Joe Louis Arena in Detroit, Michigan. The Spitfires got the best of the Spirit in a 3–2 overtime win, with a hat trick performance by defenceman Sean Day.

==Uniforms and logos==
The new logo features an aggressive, stylized World War II Spitfire fighter plane set against clouds on a red, white and blue shield with the word &quot;Spitfires&quot; emblazoned prominently in the forefront. The logo preserves the team&#x27;s primary colours of red and blue, but uses richer, more vibrant hues and adds silver and yellow as secondary colours.

The Spitfires worked with the Ontario Hockey League and Reebok - official supplier of uniforms to the OHL - in finalizing the new uniform. The new jerseys sport shoulder patches featuring the vintage Spitfire plane encircled by a gold laurel wreath and containing the number 18 to commemorate former Spitfires captain Mickey Renaud. Both the primary logo and shoulder patch designs were collaborations by Marcello Fontana and Shane Potvin, both senior art directors at Hargreaves Stewart.

The Windsor Spitfires use white jerseys on the road until Christmas and at home in the new year and the red jerseys at home until Christmas and on the road in the new year. The Spitfires briefly used a third jersey featuring a white, red and green colour scheme and an alternate logo featuring an airplane flying in front of the Ambassador Bridge. When the team was also known as the Compuware Spitfires the team&#x27;s colours were brown and orange, with a logo featuring a Spitfire airplane. The original Spitfires logo featured a maple leaf.

==Arena==
The Spitfires play their home games at the WFCU Centre, an arena located on the east end of Windsor. The WFCU Centre played host to its first Spitfires game on December 11, 2008, against the Belleville Bulls. The Spitfires lost the game 4–0, which also broke a string of 12 home wins the Spitfires had amassed so far that season.

The Spitfires previously played at Windsor Arena, built in 1924 in downtown Windsor, Ontario. The arena was originally known as the &quot;Border Cities Arena&quot; and was once home to the Detroit Red Wings of the NHL prior to 1927. The Windsor Arena, nicknamed &quot;The Barn,&quot; was the oldest operating facility in the Canadian Hockey League. It hosted the OHL All-Star game in 1978, and the Memorial Cup in 1981. On December 4, 2008, the Windsor Spitfires played their last game at &quot;The Barn&quot; against the Guelph Storm, winning 2–1.

==Broadcasters==
CKLW is the current flagship radio station of the Spitfires. It had been a longtime broadcaster of the Spitfires, but dropped the team in the 2002–03 season. After two seasons without a radio broadcaster at all, CKUE-FM picked up the Spitfires for the 2004-2005 and 2005–2006 seasons, before the team returned to CKLW beginning in the 2006–07 season. Games on CKLW are commentated by Mike Miller and Frank Dayus IV.

On television, Spitfires games are broadcast by YourTV Windsor, a community channel carried on Cogeco&#x27;s cable system in Windsor. Domenic Papa previously hosted and provided colour commentary for Spitfires games, alongside Bill Kelso on play-by-play and Brian Trenholm with analysis. However, in August 2012, TVCogeco announced that the long-time crew would be replaced for the 2012–13 season. The move to fire the Spitfires&#x27; long-time broadcast team was met with backlash and protests from Spitfires fans and other members of Windsor&#x27;s sports community. The current team consists of host Angelo Aversa, CKSY-FM morning show and former London Knights studio host Chris McLeod on play-by-play, and former Spitfires player Todd Warriner on colour.

<text>Christafari is a Christian reggae band formed in 1989. It is centered on Christ Jesus and follows the personality of ordained minister Mark Mohr (husband of Avion Blackman} (born October 23, 1971), an American, and born-again Christian. Until the age of 17, Mohr was a Rastafarian.

==Background==

As a rebellious drug addicted youth, Mohr found an affinity for reggae music and became a marijuana grower and Rastafarian after a visit to Jamaica in 1986. He became well-versed in reggae music and learned Jamaican patois, the dialect prevalent in most reggae music. In 1989 the seventeen-year-old Mohr stopped using marijuana and committed his life to Jesus at JH Ranch, a Christian camp. Two weeks later at another Christian youth camp, Mohr wrote and performed his first gospel reggae song &quot;Give Me Everything I Need&quot; at a talent show. The bass-player that day said; &quot;So you&#x27;re no longer a Rastafarian, you&#x27;re a Christafarian.&quot; The name stuck. Initially called the &quot;Christafarians&quot; Mark was backed by the &quot;Steadfast&quot; crew for his first few shows (September and October 1989). Eventually Mohr shortened the name to &quot;Christafari&quot;, (pronounced Christ-a-far-eye) and pieced together his own band members.

In 1993 Mohr enrolled in Biola University and received his ordination in 1997.

Christafari&#x27;s first album, &quot;Reggae Worship&quot;, reached the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts and created a buzz in the industry, garnering the attention of DC Talk&#x27;s tobyMac, who signed the group to Gotee Records. Their second album, &quot;Soulfire,&quot; became an early success for the fledgling label. Their third album, &quot;Valley of Decision,&quot; also for Gotee, spent 32 weeks on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; top 15 chart and also placed among the top 10 of the magazine&#x27;s &quot;Top Reggae Albums&quot; chart.

&quot;WordSound&amp;Power&quot; marked Christafari&#x27;s departure from Gotee and the birth of Mohr&#x27;s Lion of Zion Entertainment record label. The album was nominated in four categories in the 2000 Caribbean Gospel Music Marlin Awards. Christafari then released &quot;DubSound&amp;Power&quot;, the band&#x27;s first dub album and arguably the first Christian dub album ever recorded. After this the group released &quot;Palabra Sonido Y Poder&quot; (&quot;Word Sound &amp; Power&quot;), the group&#x27;s Spanish debut that featured the single &quot;El Amor De Mi Vida&quot; (No. 1 in 11 Latin American Countries). After this Christafari released &quot;Gravity&quot; (2003), &quot;Gravitational Dub&quot; (2004) and their first children&#x27;s album &quot;Reggae Sunday School&quot; (2005). 2007 Marked the release of Christafari&#x27;s &quot;To the Foundation&quot;. Christafari toured 180 shows in 20 countries in promotion of &quot;To the Foundation&quot;.

In early 2009 the group headed back into the studio to record their 20th anniversary album &quot;No Compromise&quot; with subsequent tours in Europe, Latin America and the USA. In late 2009 the band went back into their studio the &quot;Zionic Sounds Dub Lab&quot; to record their second Spanish album, &quot;Reggae De Redencion&quot;. This project was released in mid-2010. In late 2011 they released two dub albums; &quot;Majestic Heights in Dub&quot; and &quot;Dub Shots&quot;. They also released &quot;Gospel Reggae Praise&quot;, a compilation project.

In 2012, Christafari released &quot;Reggae Worship: A Roots Revival&quot;, their first worship album in almost 20 years. This breakthrough album once again catapulted them onto the &quot;Billboard&quot; Charts. The CD debuted at No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Reggae Chart, No. 10 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Christian Albums Chart and No. 39 on the Independent Albums Chart. Nearly nine months after this album was released, Christafari jumped to No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Reggae Albums Chart. This marks the first time in &quot;Billboard&quot; history that a Christian artist has secured the top spot. The band was also featured on ABC Family&#x27;s The 700 Club, and TBN filmed a live concert appearance in Hawaii for a special broadcast.

Each of Christafari&#x27;s subsequent full-length albums, &quot;Reggae Christmas&quot;, &quot;Greatest Hits Vol. 1&quot;, &quot;Greatest Hits Vol. 2&quot;, &quot;Anthems&quot;, &quot;Hearts of Fire&quot;, and &quot;Original Love,&quot; have all hit the No. 1 position on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Reggae Charts.

In 2009 Christafari started their own film company called &quot;Rank and File&quot;. The group now has around 80 music videos on YouTube including hits like &quot;Hosanna,&quot; &quot;Oceans&quot; and &quot;Here I Am To Worship&quot; that have millions of views. Ever since the band decided to become full-time Musicianaries (musical missionaries) in 2012, they have had a busy schedule ministering around 125 times a year on every inhabited continent. So far Christafari has performed in 35 countries, 46 states, at 2 Olympic games and before the president of the United States.

The band&#x27;s 2017 album &quot;Hearts of Fire&quot; entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; Reggae Albums chart at No. 1, their third No. 1 album on the chart.

On April 13, 2018, Christafari released the studio album &quot;Original Love&quot; (Lion of Zion Entertainment) which debuted at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Reggae Albums Chart. This is the group&#x27;s seventh consecutive album to debut at No. 1. Subsequent albums were &quot;99.4.1 (Reckless Love)&quot; and &quot;Dub Supreme&quot; in 2018 and 2019) and their long anticipated &quot;Musicianaries: At Any Cost&quot; (2020). The group has visited around 25 nations per year touring these albums.

==Style==
Initially Christafari&#x27;s lyrics were characterized by a heart for Rastafarians, a passion for reaching the drug-afflicted counter-culture and a distinctly evangelical Christian message. Two examples are the songs &quot;Why You A-go Look?&quot; (WordSound&amp;Power) and &quot;Teachings of His Majesty&quot; (Reggae Redemption Songs II), which use the words of Haile Selassie I (former Emperor of Ethiopia) to challenge the veneration of this Christian king as Almighty God incarnate.

Musically, the group fuses worship, roots and dancehall to create their own signature sound. Full of vibrant horns and rich female harmonies (by Avion Blackman), the group has eight members. In 1997 there was a division in the group that led to a split.

Mohr came out of the split releasing the &quot;WordSound&amp;Power&quot; and launching Lion of Zion Entertainment. Erik Sundin and others formed Temple Yard. While Christafari continued with roots reggae and dancehall, Temple Yard was fusion oriented, showing pop, reggae, soul, and gospel influence similar to artists like UB40 or Big Mountain. Temple Yard released one album on Gotee Records in 1999, two more independent albums (in 2002 and 2005) and subsequently broke up.

==Criticisms==

===Rastafari===

Some Rastafarians are offended because a few Christafari members wear dreads and in the past they have used their colors (red, gold and green) in an attempt to become all things to all men and bring Rastas to Christ. Some Rastafarians reject this approach and view Christafari&#x27;s message as a direct attack on the divinity of Selassie I. Christafari argues that they are only fulfilling the challenge set forth by Haile Selassie himself who publicly denied being Christ and said, &quot;Let us labor to lead our sisters and brothers to our Savior Jesus Christ.&quot; Selassie was an Ethiopian Orthodox Christian and many Rastafarians identify themselves as such, though others identify as Jewish by religion and Rastafari by ideology. Christafari are clearly born again evangelical Christians.

===Christian===
Some Christians are offended because Mohr and other band members wear dreadlocks and sing in a style typically associated with Rastafari. They have also criticized Mohr over the name of the group and the use of the word &quot;Jah&quot; in songs to refer to the Judeo-Christian-Islamic God. The band has previously defended the use of the word with the argument that &quot;Jah&quot; is a shortening for &quot;Yahweh&quot; (also spelled &quot;Jahweh&quot;) as used in the Bible. They are not the only Christian musical group to do this; a prime example is P.O.D.

<text>Forlimpopoli (; ) is a town and &quot;comune&quot; in the province of Forlì-Cesena, north-eastern Italy. It is located on the &quot;Via Emilia&quot; between Cesena and Forlì.

==History==
The name of Forlimpopoli derives from the Roman &quot;Forum Popilii&quot;, most likely connected to the consul Publius Popillius Laenas, who founded it in 132 BC. The area has been inhabited since Palaeolithic times, as proved by recent archaeological discoveries. Later it was settled by the Umbri and the Gauls from the &quot;Pianura Padana&quot;. In the 1st century BC Forum Popili become a &quot;municipium&quot;, and flourished due to its location near the important port of Classis (for which it provided amphorae for wine transport), as well as its own agricultural production.

It started to decay in the 3rd century AD, and, as in the High Middle Ages the area became marshy, its agricultural output fell drastically. In this period it was part of the Byzantine Exarchate of Ravenna and had its first Catholic bishop in the 5th century; over his sepulchre, outside the town, a Benedictine monastery was founded. In the 7th century Forlimpopoli was ravaged by the Lombard king Grimoald; in the following century it fell under Papal rule. Later the city started to grow again with the foundation of another burgh, the &quot;Civitas Nova&quot;, and with the communal autonomy.

In the 13th century it became a fief of the Ordelaffi family from Forlì. Their expansion was momentarily halted by the Papal reconquest by Cardinal Gil de Albornoz who, in 1361, ordered the destruction of Forlimpopoli due to its loyalty to the Ordelaffi. A chronicle from ten years later states that the town no longer existed, the bishopric having been moved to Bertinoro, and the cathedral having been replaced by a fortress, the current &quot;Rocca&quot;. A few years later Sinibaldo Ordelaffi, now in peaceful terms with the Popes, had the town rebuilt with the construction of a line of walls. In the 15th and 16th centuries it was a possession of several families, including the Riario and Cesare Borgia. In 1535 it was returned to the Papal States, who assigned it in turn as a fief to the Zampeschi family, followed by the Savelli and the Cardinal Capponi. Direct Papal authority was restored after the Napoleonic Wars.
== Main sights==

An imposing and very well-preserved castle from the 16th century lies in the centre of the town. It houses the local government, the archeological museum, a theatre and the music school.

Outside the town is the Sanctuary of &quot;Santa Maria delle Grazie di Fornò&quot;, one of the most notable circular plan churches in Italy (late 15th century). It features two works by Agostino di Duccio. The basilica of &quot;San Rufillo&quot; was originally built in the 6th century but it is now a more recent reconstruction; it is home to two canvases by Luca Longhi and Francesco Menzocchi, and the tomb of Brunoro II Zampeschi, lord of Forlimpopoli.

The church of the &quot;Servi&quot; (mid-15th century) has a painting by Marco Palmezzano.

==Culture==
The &quot;Scuola di Musica Popolare di Forlimpopoli&quot; was founded by the commune of Forlimpopoli and is now carried by an association of teachers and students. The main focus of teaching is the traditional folk music of the region. The music school has a supra-regional importance. In cooperation with the academy Fürsteneck Castle in Germany and the Eric Sahlström Institutet in Sweden it developed the &quot;European Nyckelharpa Training&quot;.

<text>The Cornwall Royals were a junior ice hockey team based in Cornwall, Ontario, Canada. The team played in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League from 1969 to 1981, and the Ontario Hockey League from 1981 to 1992. This team shared its name with other Cornwall Royals teams that played in the QSHL, MMJHL, or OHA-B.

==History==
From 1961 until 1969, the Cornwall Royals were successful members of the Central Junior A Hockey League (CJHL). As perennial CJHL champions, they represented that league at the playdowns for the 1966, 1967 and 1968 Memorial Cup national junior hockey championships, falling in the quarterfinals each year against the representatives from Quebec. After an application to join the OHL was rejected, the franchise became one of the inaugural teams of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League in 1969. The Cornwall Royals were one of the league&#x27;s premier teams during its tenure in the QMJHL, winning 3 Memorial Cup titles. For the 1981–82 season, the team transferred into the Ontario Hockey League.

The Royals suffered through many tough seasons and poor attendance after moving to the OHL. The switch in leagues alienated many die-hard fans from across the Quebec border. Seeking better fortunes, the franchise moved to Newmarket, Ontario to play as the Newmarket Royals in 1992. In 1994 the team was bought by the Ciccarelli brothers and moved to Sarnia, Ontario as the Sarnia Sting.

==Championships==
The Cornwall Royals are one of only 7 clubs to win consecutive Memorial Cup championships. They did so in 1980 and 1981. In total, the Royals won 3 Memorial Cups, 3 President&#x27;s Cups, and 5 division titles while in the QMJHL. The Royals did not win any OHL championships.

==Arenas==
The Cornwall Royals played out of the Water Street Arena from 1969 to 1976, while in the QMJHL. The Arena, renamed in honour of Si Miller, the city&#x27;s Director of Parks and Recreation for more than 30 years, was torn down in 2012.

From 1976 to 1992, the Royals played out for the Cornwall Civic Complex, located across the road from their previous arena. The arena hosted the 1990 Chrysler Challenge Cup, the annual All-Star game between the OHL and the QMJHL, which the OHL won by a score of 3 to 0.

<doc id="1034611" wikidata="Q3074589" url="?curid=1034611" title="Niagara Falls Flyers">
<text>The Niagara Falls Flyers were two junior ice hockey franchises that played in the top tier in the Ontario Hockey Association. The first, a Junior &quot;A&quot; team existed from 1960 until 1972, and the second in Tier I Junior &quot;A&quot; from 1976 until 1982.

Both teams were owned by the Emms Family, and were relocated to Niagara Falls from another city. The Niagara Falls Memorial Arena was home ice to both teams.

==History==

The first Flyers team relocated to Niagara Falls from Barrie in 1960. The team was affiliated with the Boston Bruins of the NHL. The Flyers appeared in three Memorial Cups in the 1960s, winning in 1965 and 1968.

===1963 Memorial Cup===
Niagara Falls won the right to play for the Cup by defeating the Toronto Neil McNeil Maroons for the OHA championship, and the Espanola Eagles to win the George Richardson Memorial Trophy as eastern Canadian representatives.

The Flyers were runners up to the Memorial Cup in 1963 played at Edmonton&#x27;s Arena Gardens. They lost in six games to the Edmonton Oil Kings in a best-of-seven series. Flyers players Dornhoefer and Harmer both suffered broken legs while on the ice.

===1965 Memorial Cup===
Niagara Falls won the right to play for the Cup by defeating the defending champions Toronto Marlboros for the OHA championship. The Memorial Cup in 1965 was again played at Edmonton&#x27;s Arena Gardens. They defeated the Oil Kings 4 games to 1 in a best-of-seven rematch series from two years previous. The series was filled with brawls and suspensions, as well as a heavy police presence throughout.

===1968 Memorial Cup===
Niagara Falls won the right to play for the Cup by defeating the Kitchener Rangers for the OHA championship, and the Verdun Maple Leafs for the eastern championship.

The 1968 Memorial Cup featured two Boston Bruins farm teams playing one another. The Flyers would play the Estevan Bruins on home ice, except for game two at the Montreal Forum. Game 4 was the longest in Memorial Cup history, lasting into five periods. Niagara Falls defeated Estevan in a best-of-seven series in five games.

===Second Flyers===

The Emms Family sold the Flyers in 1972 after it played for 12 seasons. The new owners then relocated the team to Sudbury to become the Sudbury Wolves.

Later the same year, after selling the Flyers, the Emms family bought the St. Catharines Black Hawks team who were the OHA champions the previous year. Four years after buying the Black Hawks, the Emms family relocated them to Niagara Falls in 1976, taking the same name as the previous team. The Emms family later sold this version of the Flyers in 1978.

The second Flyers team played for 4 seasons in the Ontario Hockey Association from 1976 to 1980, and 2 years in the Ontario Hockey League from 1980 to 1982. The Flyers appeared in the OHA finals in 1979, losing to Peterborough. Niagara Falls lost its Flyers team a second time in 1982 when they moved to North Bay to become the Centennials, who have subsequently moved to Saginaw in 2002 to become the Saginaw Spirit.

==Championships==
The Niagara Falls Flyers are one of a few clubs to win multiple Memorial Cup championships. Also of note, the franchise were repeat champions in different home cities, of Barrie and Niagara Falls. In total, the Flyers won the Memorial Cup twice in Niagara Falls, and twice in Barrie. and the J. Ross Robertson Cup 3 times each in Barrie and Niagara Falls. The Flyers finished first overall in 1963 &amp; 1965 during the regular season to win the Hamilton Spectator Trophy. The second Niagara Falls Flyers team won the western conference Emms Trophy in the 1978–79 playoffs.

<doc id="1034614" wikidata="Q3422801" url="?curid=1034614" title="Detroit Junior Red Wings">
<text>The Detroit Junior Red Wings were a junior ice hockey team in the Ontario Hockey League for three seasons from 1992 to 1995. The Jr. Red Wings were based in Detroit, Michigan.

==History==
The Compuware Ambassadors were renamed the Detroit Junior Red Wings in 1992 and played in the same arena as the NHL Detroit Red Wings. The Junior team was the most popular attraction in town during the NHL lockout of 1995, setting attendance records for the Ontario Hockey League and Canadian Hockey League.

After a failed takeover bid by Peter Karmanos to buy the NHL Red Wings from Mike Ilitch, the relationship between the two clubs soured after the season ended. The Jr. Red Wings played for three seasons before severing all ties with the NHL Red Wings and renaming themselves as the Detroit Whalers, in association with the NHL Hartford Whalers, which Karmanos bought in 1994.

===1992–93===
Former Windsor Compuware Spitfires coach Tom Webster was hired to coach for the 1992–93 season, with Paul Maurice as his assistant coach. Webster worked previously with Jr. Red Wings President Jim Rutherford and owner Peter Karmanos, when Windsor won the OHL title in 1987–88. Webster was returning from NHL coaching duties with the New York Rangers and Los Angeles Kings.

Key acquisitions made to build the team during the season were, defenceman Jamie Allison, forward Kevin Brown, and goalie Fred Brathwaite. Jim Rutherford was chosen OHL Executive of the Year in 1992–93 for role as team president and general manager in building the expansion franchise into a winning team.

The Jr. Wings played a run-and-gun style game. They were led in scoring by the &quot;Junior Production Line&quot; featuring, Pat Peake, Bob Wren and Kevin Brown. The trio combined for 163 goals on the season. Todd Harvey also scored 50 goals playing on the second line.

Detroit finished the season with 81 points, and second place in the Emms division tied with Sault Ste. Marie but had less wins with London finishing 10 points behind Detroit but the others finished with 66 points or below. The Junior Red Wings defeated the Guelph Storm in 5 games in the first round of the playoffs, but lost Pat Peake for the rest of the season when he suffered a broken collarbone.

Detroit defeated the rival London Knights in 5 games in second round to play the division champs Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds in the division finals. The more experienced Greyhounds team won the series in 5 games. The highlight of the round was the game three win, when with only three seconds left and the opposing net empty, goalie Fred Brathwaite set franchise history when he scored a goal.

===1993–94===
Before the start of the season, assistant coach Paul Maurice was promoted to head coach, when Tom Webster was relieved of his duties after a disagreement in team policies. Maurice brought along an old teammate as his new assistant, close friend Peter DeBoer. The two played together with the Windsor Compuware Spitfires in the mid to late 1980s.

Maurice and Deboer led the Junior Red Wings to their first division title after several years of chasing Sault Ste. Marie who finished with 79 points while the others in the division finished with 70 points or below. Detroit posted a franchise-best record of 42-20-4, second overall in the OHL to the North Bay Centennials. Jim Rutherford was chosen OHL Executive of the Year for the second consecutive year in 1993–94. After the trading deadline, the Junior Wings won 16 of 23 games over the last two months of the regular season to win the Emms Division title.

Detroit got a round bye for the first round but went against the Owen Sound Platers and swept them in the second round. Detroit finally eliminated Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds in the division finals in 6 games during the playoffs. As Emms Division champions, they moved on to meet the North Bay Centennials in the OHL Finals. Despite leading the series 3 games to 2, Detroit came up short as North Bay came back to win the series and the J. Ross Robertson Cup. Although the team fell short of its ultimate goal, it was a breakthrough season nonetheless.

===1994–95===
Paul Maurice took over as general manager after Jim Rutherford moved to take over managing the NHL Hartford Whalers. Maurice would continue to serve as the coach in a dual role.

The OHL realigned into three divisions for the 1994–95 season. Detroit would now play in the West Division versus Windsor, London, Sarnia and Sault Ste. Marie. As the season unfolded, the Junior Wings quickly developed into a balanced team that could play the game in many strategic ways. The team finished with a franchise best record of 44-18-4 for 92 points a close call for Windsor who finished with 85 points. It was the best defensive year to date for the team since only Windsor finished above .500, Sarnia finished with 53 points with London finished with 40 points and Sault Ste. Marie finished with 38 points.

Junior hockey in Detroit received a boost when the National Hockey League owners locked out their players until the middle of January. The Jr. Wings set an all-time Canadian Hockey League attendance record when 19,875 packed Joe Louis Arena on February 5, 1995 in a 5-5 tie with Windsor.

NHL scouts regularly attended the OHL games as did Red Wings head coach Scotty Bowman was a regular at the games. Looking to fill gaps in coverage, Red Wing broadcasters Dave Strader and Mickey Redmond broadcast several games for PASS-TV. In addition, The Junior Wings received regular coverage in the Detroit News and Free Press and found a friend in WDIV&#x27;s Van Earl Wright.

The Junior Wings rolled through the first two rounds of the playoffs, sweeping the London Knights and Peterborough Petes. In the third round versus the Sudbury Wolves, the visiting team won each of the first six games in overtime. Detroit won game seven on May 8, 1995 playing on home ice, scoring an 11-4 victory. The Junior Red Wings defeated the first place Guelph Storm in the league finals to win their first J. Ross Robertson Cup as OHL Champions, and get their first berth in the Memorial Cup Tournament.

===Memorial Cup 1995===
The Canadian Hockey League championship in 1995 was hosted in Kamloops, British Columbia at the Riverside Coliseum. The Junior Red Wings would face off in the Memorial Cup Tournament against the QMJHL champions Hull Olympiques, the WHL finalists Brandon Wheat Kings, and the Kamloops Blazers as hosts and WHL champions.

The Junior Wings finished the round-robin in second place. They defeated Brandon again 2-1 in the semi-final game to advance to the finals against the defending champion Blazers. (Despite an online report that said that Milan Kostolny scored the winning goal, video research revealed that the game-winner was actually scored by Matthew Ball, off of Wade Redden&#x27;s foot.) Detroit then started the final game versus Kamloops shorthanded, playing without Shayne McCosh (broken wrist); Bryan Berard did play, but with a bad charley horse. The Blazers blew the game open in the second period and went on to win 8-2.

Paul Maurice put the Junior Wings season in perspective:

&quot;I have a picture hanging in my office,&quot; Maurice said. &quot;It&#x27;s not a picture of us winning the championship but a picture of the crowd the day we won (May 8, 1995). It was a real special time and I remember that fondly.

&quot;My time with the Ambassadors and Junior Wings was one of the best times of my life, in terms of coaching. I think probably more so because a lot of people really caught on to junior hockey. I know a lot of those faces I see in the pictures and I remember the people being so loyal...&quot;
==Later years==
The Detroit Compuware Ambassadors became the Detroit Jr. Red Wings in 1992, despite the fact that Jr. Wings owner Peter Karmanos had an ongoing feud with Detroit Red Wings owner Mike Ilitch. The Jr. Wings even played in the Red Wings&#x27; Joe Louis Arena—until the rivalry between Ilitch and Karmanos finally came to a head, and the junior club was evicted in 1995, right after winning the OHL crown. When Karmanos bought the Hartford Whalers, the Jr. Wings became the Detroit Whalers, and played out of the tiny Oak Park Arena. (Some home games were held in the Palace of Auburn Hills, which with a capacity of over 20,000 was big enough to host the NHL Whalers; it would become home ice the IHL Detroit Vipers later in the decade.) In 1997, Karmanos built his own arena, Compuware Arena in Plymouth, Michigan, and re-dubbed the team the Plymouth Whalers—that same year, Karmanos moved the Hartford Whalers to North Carolina, making the Plymouth club the only team to still use the name &quot;Whalers&quot;. (In 2015, the junior team moved again, to Flint, Michigan, and is now the Flint Firebirds.)

<doc id="1034618" wikidata="Q1665565" url="?curid=1034618" title="Owen Sound Platers">
<text>Owen Sound Platers was a Canadian junior ice hockey team based in Owen Sound, Ontario. The team played in the Ontario Hockey League from 1989 to 2000, then was sold to new owners who renamed the team the Owen Sound Attack.

==History==
In 1989 the Holody&#x27;s moved the Guelph Platers to Owen Sound, Ontario, retaining the name &quot;Platers&quot;, as the Holody family owned a local electroplating company. The team played home games in the J. D. McArthur Arena at the Bayshore Community Centre.

The city of Owen Sound would be a strong base for junior hockey with disproportionately high support from the smallest city in the OHL. The city had a two time Memorial Cup champion in the Owen Sound Greys in 1924 &amp; 1927, and the Owen Sound Mercurys were a long-standing OHA Senior Hockey team and 1954 Allan Cup Champions.

Dave Siciliano coached the Platers to 39 wins in 68 games during the 1998–99 season, and a third-place finish in the Western Conference. In the playoffs, the Platers won the first round four games to one versus the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds, won the second round four games to two versus the Guelph Storm, then lost in the third round four games to one versus the London Knights. The 1998–99 season marked the first time which the Platers advanced to the third round of the playoffs during the franchise&#x27;s history in Owen Sound.

Despite many mediocre seasons, support for the team has remained strong. When the Holody&#x27;s decided to sell the team in 2000, several local Owen Sound business-people banded together to purchase the team. Owen Sound fans realized that losing the team would be a crisis for the city. After a bidding war and a summer-long legal battle with another suitor, the team remained in Owen Sound. The ownership group elected for a name change and came up with the &quot;Owen Sound Attack&quot;.

==Coaches==
List of coaches with multiple seasons in parentheses.

==Players==
Andrew Brunette won the 1992–93 Eddie Powers Memorial Trophy as the top scorer in the OHL with 62 Goals, 100 Assists and 162 Points. He also tied for the Canadian Hockey League&#x27;s scoring lead. Brunette was selected by the Washington Capitals 174th overall in the 7th round of 1993 NHL Entry Draft.

Jamie Storr was the 1993–94 OHL Goaltender of the Year. Storr was the starting goalie for back-to-back World Junior Hockey Championship Gold medals in 1993 and 1994. In 1994 he was drafted 7th overall by the Los Angeles Kings.

Dan Snyder, a former captain of the Owen Sound Platers had his number 14 retired by the Owen Sound Attack in 2003. He is remembered in Owen Sound for his leadership on the ice, and off the ice. Snyder was twice voted his team&#x27;s humanitarian of the year. The Ontario Hockey League renamed its Humanitarian of the Year award posthumously in honour of Dan Snyder, who died from injuries suffered in a vehicular accident with teammate Dany Heatley in 2003.

Owen Sound modernized its logo for the 1995–96 season (top of page), and used it until the team was sold in 2000. The team colours remained the same throughout; black, gold, red and white. The home uniforms for Owen Sound were white background with black, red and gold trim. The away uniforms were black background, with red, gold and white trim.
