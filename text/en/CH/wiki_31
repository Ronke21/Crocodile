<text>Petra is an American music group regarded as a pioneer of the Christian rock and contemporary Christian music genres and was, for many years, regarded as the &quot;world&#x27;s most popular Christian rock band&quot;. Formed in 1972, the band took its name from the Greek word for &quot;rock&quot;. Though it disbanded formally in 2006, incarnations have played reunion shows in the years since and released two albums in November 2010, and in November 2017. In 2013, it reformed with a new drummer, Cristian Borneo, and recorded a new song titled &quot;Holy is Your Name&quot;, before going back on tour.

With a style initially similar to The Eagles and Lynyrd Skynyrd, Petra&#x27;s sound evolved into a more energetic, driving rock sound in the early 1980s akin to Foreigner, Styx and Journey. Throughout the 1980s and into the early 1990s, Petra was one of the world&#x27;s most popular Christian rock bands, with each of its albums during that period selling hundreds of thousands of copies while the band sold-out arenas and regularly placed songs at the top of Christian radio charts. With its lyrics, music and style, Petra influenced numerous other artists at a time when Christian rock experienced strong opposition from many conservative pastors and churches.

In more than three decades, the band experienced numerous lineup changes yet released 20 studio albums, as well as two Spanish-language and two live albums, selling nearly 10 million copies while being nominated for 13 Grammy Awards, winning four, and winning 10 Dove Awards. Its biggest hit, &quot;The Coloring Song&quot;, reached the top position on three Christian radio charts simultaneously, and at its peak, the band&#x27;s tours rivaled Amy Grant&#x27;s in popularity among Christian audiences. Petra was the first rock band inducted into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame and the first Christian band whose memorabilia was included in the Hard Rock Cafe restaurant chain.

The band announced its retirement in 2005, launching a farewell tour that was recorded for release on CD and DVD. Petra&#x27;s 33-year career ended with a performance in the early hours of January 1, 2006, in Murphy, North Carolina. However, the band has continued to perform sporadically since then. In November 2010, an incarnation of the band&#x27;s mid-1980s lineup surfaced under the name Classic Petra. It released an album, &quot;Back to the Rock&quot;, featuring one new song (&quot;Too Big To Fail&quot;), one song taken from Greg X. Volz&#x27;s 2009 album &quot;God Only Knows&quot; (&quot;[Back To] The Rock&quot;), as well as re-recordings of hits from that era. The band released a companion live CD and DVD in 2011. In 2023, the band celebrated its 50th anniversary with a US and world tour.

==Musical style==
Petra&#x27;s style changed significantly over the decades in an effort to remain relevant to the youth it was trying to reach but remained within the rock genre implied by its name. At its inception, the band&#x27;s style was eclectic, borrowing from musical influences as diverse as The Eagles, Lynyrd Skynyrd and Kansas. Early albums featured electric double-guitar leads reminiscent of the Allman Brothers Band.

In the 1980s, the band began using keyboards and synthesizers to complement its guitar-based rock. Early in the decade, Petra produced a straightforward pop/rock sound reminiscent of Foreigner and Styx while increasingly using synthesizers and electronic effects as the decade progressed. By the late 1980s, Petra used a change in vocalists to embrace a guitar-based hard rock style similar to Def Leppard, Aerosmith and Journey – a style that, along with the growing popularity of Christian rock as a whole, led to Petra&#x27;s peak success.

With the rise of alternative rock in the mid-1990s, the band&#x27;s albums subsequently featured an increasing reliance on acoustic guitars and mellower tunes, including a fully acoustic album. Petra returned to its roots with a hard rock album in 2003, while the 2010 Classic Petra reunion was billed as an effort to re-record some of the band&#x27;s early 1980s hits &quot;with a modern edge&quot;. It included two new songs that fit within the guitar- and keyboard-based rock style that marked much of the band&#x27;s early career.

==History==

===1972–1979: Inception===

In the early 1970s, songwriter and guitarist Bob Hartman met bassist John DeGroff and formed the band Dove, which he quickly disbanded when DeGroff left to attend a Bible school in Fort Wayne, Indiana, known as the Christian Training Center. Hartman soon followed, and in 1972 he and DeGroff joined two classmates, guitarist Greg Hough and drummer Bill Glover, to form Petra. The band played small Midwest venues such as churches, coffeehouses and parks, to share the message of Christianity with concertgoers. Glover said on an interview &quot;we weren&#x27;t picky and we wanted to get God&#x27;s Word out to our peers. We would set up in parking lots, parks, college campuses, coffee houses, etc.&quot; A frequent venue was a Fort Wayne Christian-themed coffeehouse named The Adam&#x27;s Apple.

This mix of evangelism with rock placed Petra among the early pioneers of Jesus Music, part of the larger counterculture Jesus Movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s. Church authorities struggled with and frequently opposed the use of churches for rock concerts, and few Christian radio stations, with the exception of some college-based signals, would play the band&#x27;s songs. Petra was criticized for its rock sound, a hint of the opposition it would experience as its popularity grew.

====&quot;Petra&quot; (1974)====
Petra&#x27;s blend of style and message attracted the attention of the newly created Myrrh Records&#x27; Paul Craig Paino, who convinced the label&#x27;s founder, Billy Ray Hearn, to attend one of the band&#x27;s concerts at The Adam&#x27;s Apple. Hearn signed Petra in 1973 to record its debut album, which Hearn produced. Hearn later said he knew Petra was &quot;the most radical thing around ... as far out as anything that had come out until that time.&quot;

With no lead vocalist, Hartman and Hough shared singing duties on the self-titled debut, which was released in 1974. Featuring &quot;tight, Allman Brothers-type dual guitar lines and riffs&quot;, &quot;Petra&quot; also featured the comical country tune &quot;Lucas McGraw&quot;, which became something of a cult classic, and the seminal &quot;Backslidin&#x27; Blues&quot;, the first contemporary Christian blues song put on vinyl. The rarity of being a Christian rock band led to larger concerts and greater popularity, and Myrrh asked Petra to record a second album aimed principally at non-Christians, reflecting the evangelistic nature of the band&#x27;s shows.

====&quot;Come and Join Us&quot; (1977)====

In 1976, Glover had resigned from the band. He was replaced by a string of drummers which included a childhood friend of Hough, Bob Rickman, and Glover&#x27;s cousin, Mark Richards. However, by the time their record deal for the second album went through, Richards had already left, and Petra decided to hire Glover as a studio musician.

By Hartman&#x27;s admission, his vocal style did not match well with the band&#x27;s genre, and Petra brought in a number of guest vocalists for the second record, among them former e vocalist Greg X. Volz (that band&#x27;s name being a lower-case abbreviation of &quot;Emmanuel&quot;). Volz took the lead vocals on two songs and backed up several others. Among Volz&#x27;s songs was a cover of the Argent anthem &quot;God Gave Rock and Roll to You&quot;, which Myrrh had hoped to release as a radio single to the secular market. The song was immediately controversial – and revolutionary. &quot;It was the boldest statement anyone in Christian music had made until that time,&quot; said Ambassador Artist Agency president Wes Yoder. &quot;This was a radical notion, especially in the minds of the leaders of conservative churches.&quot; Other guest singers featured in the album were Steve Camp, Karen Morrison, and Austin Roberts.

The recording process also was marked by disputes: the label refused Hartman&#x27;s request to name the album &quot;God Gave Rock and Roll to You&quot; while a bluesy, crowd-favorite track written by Hartman about rejecting the pre-Christian self, &quot;Killing My Old Man&quot;, was deemed too controversial and cut from the album (the song would later appear on the album &quot;Never Say Die&quot;). With a harder-edged sound reminiscent of Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple, &quot;Come and Join Us&quot; was released in 1977. It failed to sell well, however, and Myrrh dropped Petra from its label.

====&quot;Washes Whiter Than&quot; (1979)====
The next year, the band experienced the first of its numerous lineup changes, as Hough left to form his own band, and DeGroff followed suit, leaving Hartman and newly hired guitarist/keyboardist/vocalist Rob Frazier. The duo began work on the band&#x27;s third album despite the lack of a record deal. Not having a steady drummer at the time, Hartman turned to Volz for drumming and vocal help. Already entertaining an offer from REO Speedwagon to be that band&#x27;s lead singer, Volz accepted Hartman&#x27;s offer instead. With a band intact, touring continuing and writing begun for a new record, Petra found itself at a crossroads: Its Christian lyrics limited the number of non-Christians attending its concerts, while its hard edge likewise limited its Christian audience.

Petra&#x27;s performances soon attracted the notice of another newly formed label, Star Song Records, which inked the band for its third album. Recording began after a nine-month sabbatical during which its members considered what direction Petra should take. Upon returning, Hartman, Frazier and Volz worked with a host of studio musicians to record &quot;Washes Whiter Than&quot;, a ballad-heavy soft-rock album that drew criticism from fans of the band&#x27;s previous hard-edged style when it was released in 1979. Lyrically, the band shifted from overt evangelism to encouraging the young Christians who made up the bulk of its audience. The album resulted in the band&#x27;s first radio hit, &quot;Why Should the Father Bother?&quot; Along with garnering Petra radio success for the first time, &quot;Washes Whiter Than&quot;&#x27;s musical depth established the band&#x27;s artistic credibility, proving Petra could play multiple styles of music and appeal to more than just the &quot;radicals&quot; in Christiandom.

===1980–1985: The Greg X. Volz era===
Though the band had scored a hit – &quot;Why Should the Father Bother?&quot; was the 16th-biggest Christian radio single of 1979 – &quot;Washes Whiter Than&quot; was not a big seller, thanks largely to distribution problems that left many copies of the record out of stores until demand for the product had subsided. Still in search of a breakthrough record and restricted by finances from touring nationally, Frazier left the band, leaving just Hartman and Volz, whom Hartman had hired as the full-time lead vocalist. With no record sales, no way to promote the albums nationally and barely any band, Hartman considered breaking up Petra.

Instead Hartman met Mark Kelly, a former lead vocalist and bassist for the band One Accord, and keyboardist John Slick at a Bible study and, after setting up a jam session, hired them to join him and Volz. Yet the two most important additions Petra made in 1980 did not play an instrument or sing a note for the band.

With Petra having established its radio bona fides and refocused its lyrical message, Star Song looked for a producer who could take the band&#x27;s fourth album back to its hard rock roots, hiring Jonathan David Brown, who had successfully produced albums with radio hits by fellow Jesus Music bands Daniel Amos, Sweet Comfort Band and Parable. Additionally, Petra hired Mark Hollingsworth, who had experience in the secular music industry, to manage and promote the band.

====&quot;Never Say Die&quot; (1981)====

The four band members and studio drummer Keith Edwards recorded &quot;Never Say Die&quot; and released it in 1981, with the first single a song originally written and performed by Volz&#x27;s old band. &quot;The Coloring Song&quot; was Petra&#x27;s big break, rocketing to the top of three Christian radio charts (rock, adult contemporary, inspirational) and reaching the top five of a fourth (southern gospel). Other songs – including the haunting &quot;For Annie&quot;, a song about teen suicide; the rocking &quot;Chameleon&quot;; and the controversial &quot;Killing My Old Man&quot; – became audience favorites.

Sporting a heavier, more polished sound in the vein of Foreigner, Styx or Kansas, &quot;Never Say Die&quot; became the breakthrough album for which the band and its label had hoped, receiving rave reviews. &quot;CCM Magazine&quot; compared the band&#x27;s new sound to Boston&#x27;s, praising the album&#x27;s lyrical and musical content and calling &quot;Never Say Die&quot; &quot;by far their finest to date.&quot;

Ultimately, &quot;The Coloring Song&quot; became the third-hottest song on Christian radio in 1982 and the 14th-highest-ranked single of the decade on the Christian adult contemporary charts. It stayed on the radio charts an astounding 14 months, while &quot;For Annie&quot; reached the top five on Christian radio in 24 markets.

As important as the success on radio was the band&#x27;s ability to tour nationally – the costs of which had been formidable in previous years. Unable to raise enough money for nationwide tours in support of its previous albums, Petra received another break when the band Servant invited it to open on its 1981–82 tour. Under Hollingsworth&#x27;s tutelage, the band refined its live performances, its members dressing in camouflage to emphasize the spiritual warfare theme recalled by &quot;Never Say Die&quot;&#x27;s artwork, which featured an ocean war setting with an electric guitar doubling as an aircraft carrier. The tour turned &quot;Never Say Die&quot; into a commercial hit. In December 1981, it became the first Petra album to crack the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 40 Inspirational LPs chart, debuting at No. 27, peaking at No. 7 in April 1982, and lasting on the chart through February 1983, more than 60 weeks after its debut.

====&quot;More Power to Ya&quot; (1982)====
Shortly after recording &quot;Never Say Die&quot;, Petra hired Louie Weaver, previously a drummer for early Christian rock acts Randy Matthews and Fireworks. The band&#x27;s touring lineup was set, and Petra went on the road for 300 days in 1982, playing 162 shows, stopping only for the five weeks it took to record the follow-up album, &quot;More Power To Ya&quot;, that summer.

The album built on the themes introduced by its predecessor, from the artwork – again featuring electric guitars, this time doubling as &quot;Star Wars&quot;-style spaceships – to the music, which again featured a mix of hard-driving rockers and radio-friendly ballads. The formula was becoming clear: Two radio ballads (the title track and &quot;Road to Zion&quot; fitting the bill this time), one Volz-penned praise tune (&quot;Praise Ye the Lord&quot; on &quot;Never Say Die&quot;, &quot;Let Everything That Hath Breath&quot; for &quot;More Power to Ya&quot;), and six or seven straight-ahead progressive rock songs written by Hartman, touching on topics aimed mostly at young Christians.

Petra also used the record to defuse the backmasking controversy, which had begun to spread into Christian music, as conservative church leaders accused Christian artists of hiding subliminal messages that could only be heard when records were played in reverse. Inserting a blatant piece of backmasking in the break between the title track and hard rocker &quot;Judas&#x27; Kiss&quot;, the band&#x27;s message was less than subtle. Played in reverse, the backmasked portion stated: &quot;What are you looking for the devil for when you oughta be looking for the Lord?&quot; It was not the first – nor would it be the last – time Petra weighed in against critics of contemporary Christian music.

The title track became a smash radio hit, the fourth-hottest song of 1983 on Christian adult contemporary radio, and the album was hailed as Petra&#x27;s best yet:
Ever since &quot;Washes Whiter Than&quot;, the &quot;new&quot; Petra has been working out the bugs of a polished pop-rock sound. With their latest release, &quot;More Power to Ya&quot;, say goodbye to bugs. Petra has crafted a style that could easily lock horns with anything on the industry charts and win.
The band also began receiving attention from the mainstream music industry, as &quot;Billboard&quot; dubbed &quot;More Power to Ya&quot; a &quot;Top Album Pick&quot; and praised the band&#x27;s &quot;surging music, tough lyrics and effective vocals.&quot; Helped by the positive press and Star Song&#x27;s recent distribution deal with Word Records, the album quickly surpassed the sales of &quot;Never Say Die&quot;, jumping to sixth on the Billboard inspirational chart within three months and trailing only albums by pop and traditional Christian artists such as Amy Grant, Sandi Patti and the Imperials.

A year after its release, &quot;More Power to Ya&quot; remained one of the five best-selling albums in Christian music, while &quot;Never Say Die&quot; remained in the top 20 – more than two years after it hit the shelves. At the end of 1982, the two albums had sold nearly 100,000 units combined. By the next summer, &quot;More Power to Ya&quot; alone had topped 125,000, a total nearly unthinkable for a Christian rock album just 12 months earlier. &quot;More Power to Ya&quot; would not drop out of the Top 40 Christian albums until June 1985, more than two and one-half years after its debut.

====&quot;Not of This World&quot; (1983)====
Petra again hit the road for an intense tour with Servant, playing to an estimated 150,000 people in 1982, mostly in venues seating as few as 1,000 people. Petra played 152 shows in 1983, taking six weeks off that summer to record the follow up, &quot;Not of this World&quot;.

Stylistically, the album was similar to the band&#x27;s previous two releases, filled with straight-ahead rockers and garnished with radio-friendly ballads, but for the first time, the band experimented with synthesizers; however, they did not shift completely away from the Hammond B3 organ, as it was featured in several tracks (&quot;Not of This World&quot;, &quot;Grave Robber&quot;, &quot;Occupy&quot; and &quot;Lift Him Up&quot;). Nevertheless, the result was something of a preview of the band&#x27;s direction in future albums, as Petra would embrace the heavier guitar styles that such a sound better complemented. As if to emphasize the shift, the album opened and closed with Petra&#x27;s first-ever instrumental tracks: synthesized versions of the Doxology.

As with the band&#x27;s most recent albums, &quot;Not of This World&quot; was well received critically and commercially. By now widely recognized as the top Christian rock band in the genre&#x27;s short history, the Petra formula was well in place. &quot;&quot;Not of This World&quot; continues Petra&#x27;s winning streak of great records that minister the Good News with good music,&quot; &quot;CCM Magazine&quot; wrote in praising the album. In addition, &quot;Not of This World&quot; garnered Petra its first Grammy nomination, for Best Performance By a Gospel Duo, Group, Choir or Chorus in 1985.

Continuing with the trend of producing radio hits, the title track became a major radio hit during 1983 and 1984, with &quot;Grave Robber&quot; being a minor radio hit during that same time. &quot;Lift Him Up&quot; was the featured praise song on this album. The album was massively successful in the still-new world of Christian rock: It became the No. 1 Christian album in the country in February 1984, dislodging Amy Grant&#x27;s &quot;Age to Age&quot;, which had held the top spot for more than a year. More than six months after its release, &quot;Not of This World&quot; remained in the top five, behind two albums by Grant and one by Sandi Patty. &quot;More Power to Ya&quot;, in its 86th week on the chart, was still in the top 10.

To support &quot;Not of This World&quot;, Petra launched its biggest tour yet – 150 dates around the world with a total attendance of more than 450,000 people through the end of 1984. Headlining for the first time, Petra poured resources into creating a concert experience as dynamic as any secular rock band, using numerous lights, stage effects and costumes.

Hollingsworth, the band&#x27;s manager, made Petra&#x27;s mission clear:

The band is not in competition with other Christian bands. We feel we are competing with Journey, Styx and REO Speedwagon. We need to be aware of them, because the people who come to see Petra go to see those bands as well. We are being very naïve if we don&#x27;t keep that in mind. We need to have a light system, sound system and presentation that will be competitive with those groups.
With 1984 drawing to a close, &quot;Not of This World&quot; was deemed Christian music&#x27;s fourth-best-selling album of the year, while &quot;More Power to Ya&quot;, released nearly two years earlier, was No. 5. No other rock albums were in the top 12. Petra itself, meanwhile was listed second only to Amy Grant as &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Top Inspirational Artist of 1984.

====&quot;Beat the System&quot; (1985)====
By any measure, Petra was at the height of its success as it toured for &quot;Not of This World&quot; and prepared to record a follow-up album. No Christian rock band had sold more records, played before bigger crowds or had enjoyed such pervasive radio airplay.

As Petra ended its tour and prepared to enter the studio, Slick left the band, and Petra again turned to Brown to produce what would ultimately be the last studio album of the Volz era. Looking for a more electronic sound and down a keyboardist, Brown turned to a programmer to create keyboard, bass and drum sounds electronically, effectively sidelining Kelly and Weaver during the recording process and continuing a practice begun the previous album in which Brown sought someone other than Weaver to drum for the band inside the studio. Toward the end of recording the album, John Lawry, who had played with the band during the &quot;Not of This World&quot; tour after fulfilling his obligations to the Joe English Band, joined officially as Petra&#x27;s newest keyboardist.

&quot;Beat the System&quot; was released in 1985, and it featured a dramatic departure from Petra&#x27;s previous style, emphasizing keyboards, electronic drums and computerized sound effects. The synth-heavy rock record was a monster hit.

Helped in part by a newly inked distribution agreement between Word and A&amp;M that would give Petra and other Word-distributed bands placement in mainstream music stores for the first time, &quot;Beat the System&quot; sold more than 200,000 copies in four months, and by the end of the year, &quot;Billboard&quot; had certified Petra as the biggest-selling gospel music group in the country. When it debuted at No. 18 on the Billboard Top 40 Inspirational LPs chart in February 1985, &quot;Beat the System&quot; trailed both &quot;Not of This World&quot; (No. 6 in its 56th week on the chart) and &quot;More Power to Ya&quot; (No. 15 in week 115). Not for long: It leapt to No. 4 on the next chart, giving Petra two top 10 albums for the first time, and by June it had taken over the top spot on the chart, which it held for more than two months. In the end, &quot;Beat the System&quot; was one of the nation&#x27;s top two Christian albums for nearly half a year.

For its career, Petra topped the million-record mark in 1985, with 900,000 of them sold in the four years since &quot;Never Say Die&quot;. At the time of its release, &quot;Beat the System&quot; was the biggest Christian rock record ever recorded and the third-biggest Christian album of the 1980s (trailing only Amy Grant&#x27;s &quot;Age to Age&quot; and Sandi Patti&#x27;s &quot;Songs From the Heart&quot;), even though it did not produce any radio hits. By decade&#x27;s end, &quot;Beat the System&quot;&#x27;s impact on the Christian sales charts trailed only records by Grant, Patti, Steve Green and Michael W. Smith. Finally, the band was nominated for a Grammy for the second consecutive year, again for Best Gospel Performance by a Duo, Group, Choir or Chorus.

====&quot;Captured in Time and Space&quot; (1986)====

Petra recorded a music video of &quot;Beat the System&quot;&#x27;s title track, and then went on tour again, ultimately playing to more than 500,000 people in the yearlong world tour, which ranked second in all of Christian music only to Amy Grant&#x27;s. To capture the energy of the tour, the band recorded performances in Tennessee and South Carolina over three nights in November 1985 and released the final product on vinyl and VHS shortly after, dubbing it &quot;Captured in Time and Space&quot;.

The album was a farewell to Petra&#x27;s first era of popularity and the sound it had cultivated with Volz&#x27;s distinctive vocals. As constant touring took its toll on the band, Hartman and Volz began to disagree about Petra&#x27;s future, both on stage and off. The tour, while it drew more fans than ever, was expensive, and it left Petra hurting financially. Increased competition from other Christian rock bands, for whom Petra had paved the way, led to lower-than-expected showings as the tour went on. As Hartman told &quot;CCM Magazine&quot; in 1986, &quot;If I had to put it in a nutshell without getting too deep, I would have to say it&#x27;s business. Greg and I agree on just about everything except business.&quot;

In 1985 Volz announced he would leave the band to pursue a solo career upon completion of the tour and release of the live album, leaving in doubt the future of the world&#x27;s biggest Christian rock band.

===1986–1994: Petra&#x27;s peak===

With Petra hurting financially and Volz announcing his departure, rumors swirled that Petra would break up.

Instead, Hartman turned to former Head East vocalist John Schlitt, whom he had met on an airplane some years before but who had since converted to Christianity and left rock music altogether. Schlitt needed little convincing. He was introduced to Petra fans at a show in Australia in February 1986.

With Petra seeking a new musical direction to support the style of its new vocalist – and expressing unhappiness with the sound Brown produced for &quot;Captured in Time and Space&quot; – band and producer parted ways. To replace Brown, Star Song tapped the Elefante brothers – John, former keyboardist and lead vocalist for Kansas, and Dino, who had written songs for Kansas and had more recently produced albums for Christian metal bands such as Barren Cross. The combination of Schlitt and the Elefante Brothers significantly altered Petra&#x27;s sound and set the stage for the band&#x27;s greatest success.

====&quot;Back to the Street&quot; (1986)====
After a brief introductory tour overseas with Schlitt singing the Volz classics, Petra entered the studio to record the first album with the band&#x27;s new singer. 

Petra&#x27;s members said they found the Elefantes easier to work with, and for the first time since &quot;More Power to Ya&quot;, the entire band performed on the same record without studio fill-ins. Likewise, the Elefantes&#x27; hard rock roots led to re-emphasizing Hartman&#x27;s guitars as the preeminent instrument in the band&#x27;s sound. Looking to shatter the &quot;Petra formula&quot;, the band intentionally avoided what Hartman called &quot;a stock radio ballad.&quot; While acknowledging that the abrupt change in style likely cost the band some fans, Hartman hailed &quot;Back to the Street&quot; as &quot;the truest representation of this band&#x27;s talent.&quot;

The result was a transitional album that neither reflected where Petra had been, nor where the band would be for the next decade. As a result, sales lagged, though the one ballad on the album, &quot;Thankful Heart&quot;, achieved radio success, ranking No. 9 on the annual airplay chart. The album received positive reviews though not quite gushing, as evidenced by &quot;CCM Magazine&quot;&#x27;s half-hearted praise: &quot;With &quot;Back to the Street&quot;, Petra rocks, and they do it pretty well.&quot; Nevertheless, the album was Petra&#x27;s third straight studio offering to be nominated for a Grammy, and for the first time, the Gospel Music Association recognized Petra&#x27;s success with three Dove Award nominations: artist of the year, band of the year and contemporary album of the year.

====&quot;This Means War!&quot; (1987)====
Finishing their &quot;Back to the Street&quot; tour in December 1986, Petra entered the studio the next month to begin writing and recording the band&#x27;s follow-up. In the three weeks between, Hartman wrote seven songs – the foundation of what would become &quot;This Means War!&quot;, an album that musically saw the band continue to transition away from the keyboard-influenced, highly polished rock sound it had perfected earlier in the decade and toward an arena-rock sound heavy on guitars and emphasizing Schlitt&#x27;s soaring vocals.

Lyrically, &quot;This Means War!&quot; took the implicit spiritual warfare theme that had been present in Petra&#x27;s albums and tours since &quot;Never Say Die&quot; and emphasized it further. Although the album ended for good the band&#x27;s longstanding tradition of featuring electric guitars as warcraft, its picture of a warrior on his knees complemented songs with titles such as &quot;Get on Your Knees and Fight Like a Man&quot;, &quot;All the King&#x27;s Horses&quot; and the title track, a rousing rocker backed by a marching drumbeat that addressed Satan as the preordained loser of the war he had declared against Christ and his followers.
The message seemed in part a response to the attacks lobbed against the band by preachers and televangelists, especially Jimmy Swaggart, who denounced rock music in general – and Petra in particular – as tools of the devil. It was not the first time Petra musically had addressed its Christian critics, doing so most explicitly in &quot;Witch Hunt&quot; on &quot;Beat the System&quot;, but the attacks clearly affected the band. &quot;Not only does it deny the kids the opportunity and encouragement to go to the concert, but it hurts terribly our ministry,&quot; Hartman told &quot;CCM&quot;. &quot;We experience a lot more skepticism. He says that there&#x27;s all this decadence in Christian music, and that we&#x27;re all in it for the money.&quot;

The result was &quot;the most conceptual album Petra&#x27;s ever done&quot; and another hit. Within five weeks of its release, the album hit No. 1 on &quot;CCM Magazine&quot;&#x27;s sales chart, where it joined the title track and &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Your Heart Be Hardened&quot; at the top of their respective charts. &quot;This Means War&quot;&#x27;s initial sales drew comparisons to Amy Grant&#x27;s&quot; Age to Age&quot; as consumers snapped it off the shelves (though it ultimately fell short of that album&#x27;s lofty marks). It also garnered the band its fourth consecutive Grammy nomination.

====&quot;On Fire!&quot; (1988)====

As Petra&#x27;s popularity built still further, the band expanded their reach by sponsoring children through Compassion International and advocating for a Constitutional amendment allowing prayer in public schools. Applying the spiritual warfare theme explored in &quot;This Means War!&quot;, Petra formed &quot;Prayer Warrior&quot; groups across the country – bands of youth groups to pray for each other. The focus on shepherding Christian youth through a spiritual battle zone continued on the band&#x27;s next album, &quot;On Fire!&quot;

With a cover featuring a flaming sword breaking through a pane of glass, &quot;On Fire!&quot; was Petra&#x27;s heaviest album yet, the culmination of the transition begun with Back to the Street. A fully hard rock album, bordering in places on heavy metal, &quot;On Fire!&quot; made the most of songs such as &quot;All Fired Up&quot;, &quot;Hit You Where You Live&quot; and &quot;Mine Field&quot; – all of which continued the spiritual warfare theme. &quot;CCM Magazine&quot;, in praising the album, called &quot;On Fire!&quot; &quot;the crunchiest Petra sound yet&quot; and praised the first two tracks as &quot;the most exciting eight minutes of rock Petra has ever put to tape.&quot; Once again, the band scored hits with its initial singles, as &quot;First Love&quot;, the radio ballad, and &quot;Mine Field&quot;, the rocker, hit No. 1 on three of Music Line Magazine&#x27;s four Christian radio charts. &quot;First Love&quot; finished 1988 as the year&#x27;s 10th-most-played radio single.
With the album, Petra released a long-form film, tying a series of short-form music videos together with ministry segments. The film garnered the band its first Dove award, for Long Form Music Video of the Year in 1990, and its fifth consecutive Grammy nomination for its studio offerings.

The tour, meanwhile, reflected the band&#x27;s increasing name recognition, with more than 100 shows and a stage set that included a steel and aluminum sword modeled after the &quot;On Fire!&quot; album cover. Touring with popular evangelist Josh McDowell Petra played to audiences of more than 8,000 each night.

&quot;On Fire!&quot; featured the first lineup change since Schlitt joined the band, as bassist Mark Kelly was replaced by Ronny Cates, ushering in the most stable lineup in Petra&#x27;s history: Hartman on guitars, Schlitt on vocals, Lawry on keyboards, Weaver on drums and Cates on bass.

====&quot;Petra Praise: The Rock Cries Out&quot; (1989)====
Touring with the popular McDowell bought Petra credibility with youth leaders and church pastors, who were impressed by the speaker&#x27;s forceful defense of Christian rock music. Seeking to build on that growing influence, Hartman and Schlitt turned to youth ministers directly at a conference in California, asking them how Petra could better aid their ministries. The response: Produce some music that could be better replicated in a church setting. &quot;So we thought, &#x27;What if we do a CD with worship songs that we think are cool, but do it Petra style and then provide an accompaniment track for the youth groups?&#x27;&quot; Schlitt said.

The result was the first-ever contemporary praise-and-worship album in Christian music, with praise staples such as &quot;Take Me In&quot;, &quot;The Battle Belongs to the Lord&quot; and &quot;King of Kings&quot; done in Petra&#x27;s hard-rock style, together with two new rockers in the same lyrical vein. The band&#x27;s new label, Word Records, billed it &quot;a praise and worship record unlike any ever seen.&quot; Inside Music magazine agreed, calling &quot;Petra Praise&quot; &quot;truly different.&quot; In one interview, Schlitt acknowledged the band was &quot;going out on a limb.&quot;

The limb held, as &quot;Petra Praise: The Rock Cries Out&quot; became one of the band&#x27;s best selling, certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America in 1998. After its release in October 1989, &quot;Petra Praise&quot; remained in the top 10 of Christian contemporary album sales for nearly a year. The artwork also won a Dove award, the band&#x27;s second. In subsequent years, the album would be cited by such popular praise bands as Sonicflood as influencing their decision to enter the genre.

====&quot;Beyond Belief&quot; (1990)====

The success of &quot;Petra Praise&quot; opened the door for even greater success than Petra had seen previously. The Christian rock scene had exploded, and the critics of the past decade had largely been silenced. The band went back to the studio to record a hard-hitting album that would be accompanied by a concept movie, in which the characters interact with the band between six music videos.

Lyrically, the album focused on the concept of faith implied by the album&#x27;s title, &quot;Beyond Belief&quot;, with radio singles entitled &quot;Creed&quot;, &quot;Love&quot; and &quot;Prayer&quot;, as well as the title track and &quot;I Am on the Rock&quot;. Musically, the band embraced a hard rock sound reminiscent of Def Leppard, as described by &quot;CCM Magazine&quot;: &quot;Petra has certainly moved more and more toward a big, arena rock sound in the past few years (the most obvious fruit of their association with the Elefantes), and &quot;Beyond Belief&quot; is, if not completely Kansas-inspired, certainly on par with some of the best arena rock music around.&quot; The band also, for the first time, drew from a handful of local non-accredited artists such as John Wayfield (percussion), Adam Lawson (keyboards) and Mark Strumford (guitar) during the album&#x27;s recording.

&quot;Beyond Belief&quot; was huge, the band&#x27;s most successful release ever, peaking at No. 1 on the Christian charts and certified Gold by the RIAA in 1995. The radio single &quot;Love&quot; shot to the top of the charts and stayed there, becoming Christian radio&#x27;s biggest hit of 1991.

It won the band its first Grammy, in the newly created best Rock/Contemporary Gospel Album category, as well as Dove awards for Rock Album of the Year, Rock Recorded Song of the Year for the title track and Recorded Music Packaging of the Year. More historically, the Gospel Music Association for the first time honored a rock band as Group of the Year, as Petra beat contemporary artists 4HIM, First Call, Take 6 and BeBe &amp; CeCe Winans.

The band was at the peak of its popularity, playing to sold-out arenas of 10,000 fans on yet another nationwide tour, and in &quot;CCM Magazine&quot;&#x27;s year-end Reader&#x27;s Choice Awards, the band swept to first place in eight categories, second place in four more, and garnered three times as many votes for pop/rock artist of the year as second-place finisher Michael W. Smith.

====&quot;Unseen Power&quot; (1991)====
At the height of its career, the members of Petra were wary of repeating the arena-rock formula that had served the band so well since the mid-1980s. Seeking a way to change directions musically, the band and its producers for their next album hired an outside engineer for the first time, bringing in Neil Kernon, who had previously worked with Kansas, Elton John and Peter Gabriel. Along with its usual hard rock fare, the band added tracks that featured a gospel choir and a bluesy sound, and Kernon&#x27;s influence led to an album with a stronger emphasis on the band&#x27;s rhythm section.

Hartman also shifted his songwriting style, moving away from his practice of constructing albums around loose themes and writing tracks more personal in nature. The result was &quot;Unseen Power&quot;, a Petra album that, for the first time, was distributed by a secular record company, Epic. That, and the immensely favorable reaction to its release, led to talk of Petra following in the wake of Grant and Smith as a potential crossover hit, popular in both Christian and secular circles. &quot;If it happens, then yes, we&#x27;re ready&quot;, Schlitt said of the possibility.

Though the secular breakthrough never came, the album was a hit, allowing Petra to top 6 million records sold since its inception – the most of any Christian artist at the time. The newly formed Hard Rock Cafe asked the band for materials to include in its restaurant displays, another first for a Christian band. And Petra became the only Christian band to play Farm Aid when it took the Texas Stadium stage before 40,000 people in 1992. &quot;Unseen Power&quot; opened No. 1 on Billboard&#x27;s Christian music charts in November 1991 and stayed in the top 10 for seven months. Radio single &quot;Hand on My Heart&quot; was among the top 20 songs on Christian AC radio in 1992, and it was one of five tracks from the album to hit No. 1 on the Christian radio charts.

&quot;Unseen Power&quot; garnered the band its second Grammy, again winning for Best Rock/Contemporary Gospel Album, and a Dove award, for Rock Recorded Song of the Year.

====&quot;Wake Up Call&quot; (1993)====
Taking what for its members was an unusual yearlong break between touring and recording the band&#x27;s followup to &quot;Unseen Power&quot;, Petra emerged to a changing musical landscape requiring adjustment from the 20-year-old band. &quot;I think we&#x27;re on the verge of a new era for Petra&quot;, Hartman said shortly after the release of 1993&#x27;s &quot;Wake-Up Call&quot;. &quot;I&#x27;m not sure what that will be – but it won&#x27;t be disco.&quot;

As the broader musical climate soured on the arena-rock style that had been Petra&#x27;s musical core, the band continued to revamp its style, breaking with the Elefante brothers for the first time in six records. Instead, Brown Bannister, who at the time had won eight Grammy awards as a producer and songwriter, mostly for Amy Grant, was brought in. The reason for the change was purely practical: the band, now consisting largely of middle-aged fathers living in Nashville, did not want to travel to California, where the Elefantes were based, to record an album. Also seeking a new musical direction, the band sought out Bannister after enjoying his work for White Heart earlier in the decade.

&quot;Wake Up Call&quot; as a result was the band&#x27;s first significant shift from the style of the 1980s, featuring fewer driving rock tracks and favoring instead midtempo songs and ballads. Bannister&#x27;s production style, favoring authenticity over the Elefantes&#x27; slick production styles, led to a rawer feel for the album. Hartman called it &quot;probably the most indicative of who Petra really is.&quot;

The change was well received, as the album stayed on Billboard&#x27;s Christian albums chart for more than five months and was the third consecutive Petra album to receive a Grammy for Best Rock Gospel Album. The short-lived America&#x27;s Christian Music Awards named Petra favorite rock group or duo and named &quot;Wake Up Call&quot; favorite rock CD, and the band won a Dove award for Rock Album of the Year. In the 1994 &quot;CCM&quot; Readers Awards, the band continued to clean up, winning Favorite Rock Artist/Band, Favorite Rock Album for &quot;Wake Up Call&quot; and Favorite Song for the radio hit &quot;Just Reach Out&quot;.

More change was in the offing, however. As the band concluded its world tour for &quot;Wake Up Call&quot; in 1994 and began looking to re-enter the studio, Hartman, the lone remaining founding member, decided to retire from touring.

===1995–2002: The post-Hartman era===
Once again, rumors swirled about the band&#x27;s imminent demise. Lawry, who had been Petra&#x27;s keyboardist for more than a decade, left the band, and Hartman, citing a desire to be closer to his family and focus on songwriting, retired from touring. Meanwhile, Schlitt had just released a solo album. The band rejected the rumors, however; Hartman said he would continue writing and doing studio work with the band, and he turned over nearly all of Petra&#x27;s administrative duties to Schlitt.

Schlitt brought in Jim Cooper to replace Lawry and David Lichens to replace Hartman on tour. Weaver was now the only band member with a connection to the Volz era of Petra – and he was hired when Petra was 10 years old. It was the first wholesale lineup change since 1980, but it was far from the last.

====&quot;No Doubt&quot; (1995)====
The new lineup set to recording &quot;No Doubt&quot;, a concerted effort to reach a younger audience no longer interested in the driving hard rock that had made the band the biggest in Christian music. Back to using producers John and Dino Elefante, Schlitt called the album &quot;the best record we&#x27;ve ever done.&quot; The critics disagreed, citing in particular the electronic, scaled-back nature of the drums, which sapped the life out of the disc&#x27;s rockers, and the prevalence of &quot;fair to middlin&#x27;&quot; tracks that failed to &quot;break any new ground.&quot;

The album opened at No. 2 on Billboard&#x27;s Top Christian Albums chart but fell out of the Top 10 two months later. It peaked at No. 91 on the Billboard Top 200, lasting eight weeks, and Schlitt acknowledged sales had dropped from the band&#x27;s previous chart-toppers. Its key radio single, the title track, barely cracked the 40 most-played songs for 1995. For the first time since the creation of the Rock Gospel Album category in the Grammies, Petra was nominated but failed to win, though it did pick up a Dove award for Rock Album of the Year, and &quot;CCM Magazine&quot;&#x27;s annual Reader Awards placed Petra once again at the top as the fans&#x27; favorite rock band, with &quot;No Doubt&quot; their favorite rock album.

The lackluster sales and tepid reviews, combined with the lineup changes, painted a picture of a band in decline. The quick departure of Cooper and Lichens, joined by longtime bassist Cates, did not help. Schlitt said Cates cited fatigue with the touring lifestyle, but that he fired Lichens and Cooper over differences about the band&#x27;s musical direction and unhappiness with the possibility of recording a second praise album. Lonnie Chapin replaced Cates on bass, while two members of Schlitt&#x27;s solo band, Kevin Brandow (guitar and keyboards) and Pete Orta (guitars), filled the remaining slots.

====&quot;Petra Praise 2: We Need Jesus&quot; (1997)====
Despite the turmoil, Petra prepared in 1997 to release its 16th studio album, a sequel to its wildly successful &quot;Petra Praise&quot; album eight years earlier. The band had noticeably slipped from the heights it had occupied early in the decade. &quot;Things kind of tapered off for a while,&quot; Hartman said of the post-&quot;Wake Up Call&quot; Petra. &quot;I think there&#x27;s a really good chance Petra could be back on the upswing.&quot;

&quot;Petra Praise 2: We Need Jesus&quot; featured few truly hard rock songs, as evidenced when it was nominated for a Grammy in the Best Pop/Contemporary Gospel Album category. Instead, it placed heavy emphasis on acoustic guitars, mandolins, keyboards and other, more experimental styles. The title track, the album&#x27;s big radio single, featured guest vocals from Foreigner&#x27;s Lou Gramm, and though &quot;Petra Praise 2&quot; reached No. 1 on the Christian albums chart, overall sales flagged, as the album barely reached the Billboard 200, peaking at No. 155. One secular critic dismissed the disc as &quot;religious muzak&quot; and labeled Petra &quot;the Barry Manilow of Christian rock&quot;. &quot;We Need Jesus&quot; eventually won a Dove award for Praise and Worship Album.

The failure of the album to rejuvenate the band&#x27;s career seemed apparent by September 1997, when Schlitt was asked about the band&#x27;s success:
I would say from my gut that we are probably as low as we&#x27;re going to go in that valley, and heading for the next peak. That&#x27;s fine with me because everybody needs a turn. We&#x27;ve been at the top of the mountain twice already, and, if nothing else, we need to get out of the way and let other bands have some fun. I mean, now there&#x27;s variety that Christian kids can have. And they don&#x27;t just grab Petra. Now they can grab Jars of Clay, dc Talk or Newsboys.
====&quot;God Fixation&quot; (1998)====
With Orta, Chapin and Brandow established in the band, they joined with Schlitt and Weaver to produce the incarnation&#x27;s first full-fledged Petra album, &quot;God Fixation&quot;. The three new members were given broad reign to influence the music as they wrote songs with Hartman, leading to a drastic change toward a mellower rock sound.

Though the album was praised by critics as &quot;fresher and more immediate than [Petra] has been in a long time,&quot; hailed for &quot;strong&quot; music and songwriting and nominated for a Grammy, fans clearly rejected the album&#x27;s alt-rock, mid-tempo feel. The album failed to reach any higher than 10th on the Billboard Christian albums chart and missed the Billboard 200 altogether.

Faced with criticism that the band had strayed too far from its hard-rock roots and did not &quot;sound like Petra anymore&quot;, Schlitt responded: &quot;Petra wasn&#x27;t selling worth a stink. Petra was going down the drain, and I don&#x27;t want to go down the drain yet.&quot;

====&quot;Double Take&quot; (2000)====
The band&#x27;s contract with Word Records was stumbling to an end. To complete the six-disc deal, the band re-recorded a set of its biggest hits in an acoustic format, including two new songs. The album, &quot;Double Take&quot;, was all but ignored by both Word and the Christian music industry and met with antipathy by the band&#x27;s fans, who rejected the reimagining of some of Petra&#x27;s most loved songs. Though it garnered some positive reviews – &quot;HM Magazine&quot; for one said &quot;these stripped-down rockers sound pretty good&quot; – the album was largely rejected by critics and fans alike, and it sold fewer than 40,000 copies. When &quot;Double Take&quot; won Petra its fourth Grammy, for Best Rock Gospel Album in 2001, critics charged it was an example of the Grammy voters being &quot;out to lunch.&quot;

After six albums that spanned Petra&#x27;s highest peak and ended with the band in its lowest valley to date, the band and its label parted ways. &quot;Their interests were starting to go in other directions, so it was time for us to leave and find a label that&#x27;s interested in rebuilding the fact that we still exist,&quot; Schlitt said.

With the band&#x27;s future again uncertain, Petra received the highest of accolades from the Gospel Music Association as the first rock band to be inducted into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame. Soon after, however, as Petra continued to search for a new label home, the band experienced another massive upheaval when newest member, Trent Thomason (keyboards and vocals), left the band due to a lack of live dates. Soon after, Chapin and Orta left the band as well. Once again, only Schlitt and Weaver were left as the faces of Petra.

====&quot;Revival&quot; (2001)====

After a lengthy label search, Petra was signed by Inpop Records, then just two years old and founded by Newsboys lead singer Peter Furler, an admirer of the band. Inpop assigned former Sonicflood members Dwayne Larring and Jason Halbert to produce a third praise-and-worship album, to be called &quot;Revival&quot; – a none-too-subtle reference to the label&#x27;s hopes for Petra&#x27;s career. Additionally, the label focused its packaging solely on the band&#x27;s three most famous members, convincing Hartman, who still was not touring but had never stopped writing and playing guitar in the studio, to join Schlitt and Weaver as the label-marketed version of Petra. Studio musicians, including bassist Rick Cua, filled in the rest.

The result was a well-received album, helped in part by an Inpop gimmick that comprised sending radio executives and media representatives an unlabeled CD of the album and asking them to guess – many doing so futilely – what band had recorded it. &quot;CCM Magazine&quot; described the album as a &quot;cage match pitting Aerosmith against Third Day,&quot; and several reviewers praised the band&#x27;s modern-rock rendition of the classic hymn &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;. Nevertheless, the band struggled to gain airplay for its singles, and the album failed to crack even the Billboard Christian albums chart.

Petra hired three new members for the subsequent tour: Bryce Bell on keyboards, Quinton Gibson on guitars and Greg Bailey on bass. His inclusion on the album artwork notwithstanding, Hartman maintained his retirement from touring, although he returned for the recording of this album.

===2003–2006: Bob Hartman&#x27;s return and farewell===
As it entered the studio for its 20th album, Petra continued to find stability elusive, as Bell and Gibson left to pursue other endeavors. Then, in a shocking announcement, the band announced drummer Louie Weaver, the longest-tenured member of Petra other than Hartman himself, had &quot;come to an impasse&quot; with the rest of the band and &quot;will not be forming with us any longer.&quot; Weaver, in his own statement, said that the band had fired him, and that he was &quot;shocked&quot; and &quot;surprised&quot; by the decision. Hartman later said the decision had been made by Schlitt, in consultation with his pastor and Hartman; neither side gave a reason for the dismissal.

====&quot;Jekyll and Hyde&quot; (2003)====
For the band&#x27;s 20th studio album, &quot;Jekyll and Hyde,&quot; Furler handled production duties himself. With Weaver&#x27;s departure, Furler played drums, while Gibson&#x27;s departure meant Hartman would be Petra&#x27;s full-time guitarist for the first time since 1994. Wade Jaynes, a studio bassist, also was tapped to perform in place of Bailey, at Furler&#x27;s request. Furler, in particular, pushed Hartman to write heavier, riff-based songs along the lines of the title track, which Hartman had written before the decision to record Revival instead of a traditional album with original material.

The result was an exceptionally heavy album filled with crunchy riffs, modernized by removing the trademark keyboards and guitar solos from Petra&#x27;s sound. In an Inpop-produced statement, Schlitt called the album &quot;our most aggressive rock record so far.&quot; Critics and fans alike greeted the album with acclamation, hailing it as the band&#x27;s &quot;best album in years&quot; and &quot;one of this year&#x27;s biggest musical surprises,&quot; &quot;a powerful rock effort ... bordering on metal.&quot; For the first time since &quot;Petra Praise 2&quot;, six years earlier, the band broke onto the Billboard charts, peaking at No. 22 on the Christian albums chart. The album also garnered Petra its 13th Grammy nomination.

With no keyboardist necessary on tour, a first for the band since its earliest days, and Hartman returning to the stage, the band needed only to replace Weaver, hiring Paul Simmons shortly after the album&#x27;s release. Petra then prepared a worldwide tour beginning in 2004, including a June show in Indiana that featured a reunion of original members Hartman, Hough and DeGroff in the middle of the contemporary band&#x27;s set. Simmons filled in for original drummer Glover, who was invited but could not attend. Shows in India near the end of the year featured crowds as large as 20,000.

====&quot;Farewell&quot; (2005)====
Despite rumors that Petra was working on another studio album, John Schlitt announced in May 2005 that he and Hartman had agreed to disband Petra at the end of the year, following a short farewell tour.

As a final sendoff, Petra recorded its show in Franklin, Tennessee, on October 4, which included special appearances by Volz and Lawry, each performing on a handful of songs from his tenure with the band. The performance was released on CD in November and DVD in March 2006, each titled simply &quot;Farewell&quot;. Petra&#x27;s last performance began December 31, 2005, in Murphy, North Carolina, and ended shortly after midnight, January 1, 2006, nearly 34 years after Hartman founded the band.

===2007–present: Reunions and 40th Anniversary===

====&quot;Vertical Expressions&quot; (2007)====
Schlitt and Hartman, after arranging worship music together for a youth retreat, reunited for an independently released praise-and-worship CD in 2007, calling themselves II Guys from Petra and titling their album &quot;Vertical Expressions&quot;. The songs featured contemporary praise songs in a raw-sounding, electric rock format, and included two bonus tracks from Petra&#x27;s recorded farewell performance that had not been included on the &quot;Farewell&quot; CD. Studio musicians played drums and bass, and former Petra keyboardist Jim Cooper teamed with Hartman on production. Hartman and Schlitt have since performed several shows together, playing acoustic renditions of Petra and II Guys songs as recently as early 2010.

====Reunion shows====
The full band as comprised on the &quot;Farewell&quot; tour first reunited at the end of 2007, playing a 90-minute set in Buenos Aires as part of Rock &amp; Vida, a festival to commemorate World AIDS Day. The lineup consisted of Hartman, Schlitt, Simmons and Bailey. This version of Petra, though in some cases with Simmons replaced by Christian Borneo on drums, reunited four more times in 2010, appearing at Heaven Fest in Longmont, Colorado, and Hills Alive Festival in Rapid City, South Dakota, as well as performing a pair of shows in Brazil. The band performed again at Rock &amp; Vida in December 2010.

====Classic Petra and &quot;Back to the Rock&quot; (2010–2011)====

In early 2010, Hartman and former Petra members agreed to reunite to record an album in the fall, with a subsequent world tour. The lineup featured Hartman on guitars, Greg X. Volz on vocals, Mark Kelly on bass, Louie Weaver on drums and John Lawry on keyboards. Although that specific lineup recorded only one studio album together – &quot;Beat the System&quot; in 1985 – Hartman, Volz, Kelly and Weaver were the heart of Petra&#x27;s initial wave of success, recording &quot;More Power to Ya&quot;, &quot;Not of This World&quot; and &quot;Beat the System&quot; together before Volz&#x27;s departure in 1986. Additionally, Weaver toured with the band in support of &quot;Never Say Die&quot;, Petra&#x27;s first significant tour. Lawry, meanwhile, was Petra&#x27;s longest-tenured keyboardist, joining the band on the &quot;Not of This World&quot; tour in 1984 and leaving 10 years later, at the end of Petra&#x27;s second wave of success. Along with recording &quot;Beat the System&quot;, this iteration of Petra also was filmed for &quot;Captured in Time and Space&quot;, the first of the band&#x27;s two live albums.

The album, &quot;Back to the Rock&quot;, was released for digital download in November 2010, with hard copies also sold at the band&#x27;s November concert taping. It featured re-recordings of 10 classic Petra songs from the early and mid-1980s, as well as two new tracks. Hard copies of the CD went on sale in January 2011. That same month, the members of Classic Petra played a live show together for the first time in decades, taping the concert at the TBN studios, with a documentary preceding the concert. Though recorded ostensibly for broadcast on TBN and eventual DVD release, the show first found life as a live album, released digitally to iTunes and Amazon in April 2011. A companion DVD was released that July. In July 2011, Classic Petra again performed at Cornerstone Festival, closing the day of classic Christian rock.

====40th Anniversary Tour====

In July 2013, StarSong released a 40th Anniversary compilation album featuring more than 30 songs covering most of the band&#x27;s trajectory. After that, the band reunited again with Schlitt, Hartman, Bailey, and Borneo, to tour in celebration of the band&#x27;s 40th anniversary. The band also recorded a new song titled &quot;Holy is Your Name&quot;, and performed in several venues during the fall of 2013. During that time, it was also announced that the band was invited to play at the Classic Rock Tour 2014 slated for February 2014. The show was supposed to feature classic rock acts like Asia featuring John Payne, Phil Bates from ELO Part II, and former Genesis frontman Ray Wilson.

On March 5, 2014, Petra was recognized by SESAC with the Legacy Award. The award was presented during a ceremony held at Hillwood Country Club in Nashville, Tennessee, attended by band founder Bob Hartman, and members Schlitt, Bailey, Borneo, and keyboardist John Lawry. Petra also performed live at the event.

====Classic Petra Resurrection and &quot;Back to the Rock II&quot; (2017–present)====

On December 4, 2017, a parallel project titled Back to the Rock II was released, bringing re-recordings from other 1980s&#x27; hits and giving continuity to the previous &quot;Back to the Rock&quot;. This time, the line-up does not take the name of Classic Petra, but the name of CPR Band instead (later renamed as Classic Petra Resurrection, because of its backronym). The members of this formation are: Greg X. Volz, on lead vocals; Kirk Henderson, on guitar; John Lawry, on keyboards; Ronny Cates, on bass (who would be replaced later by Greg Bailey) and Louie Weaver, on drums.

==Influence==

===Larry Norman===
Hartman, already a rock musician when he became a Christian, struggled at the time with whether Christians could glorify God through rock music. He credited the work of musician Larry Norman as inspiring him to continue in Christian rock: &quot;I&#x27;ll never forget the first time I heard him. ... The freedom Larry had on stage, that freedom to just be himself, really set me free in my songwriting; it really set me free in the establishment of Petra.&quot;

===On others===

During its 33-year career, Petra influenced countless artists in and out of the Christian scene. Petra was the only Christian band to play at the 1992 Farm Aid concert and the first Christian band to be included in the Hard Rock Cafe. In 2000, Petra was the first Christian rock band to be inducted to the Gospel Music Hall of Fame. &quot;The doubts about popular music mixing with Christian lyrics have mostly vanished due to their 25-year track record of proven ministry and changed lives. Petra was a true pioneer for our industry,&quot; GMA President Frank Breeden said at the time.

In 2004, &quot;CCM&quot; readers inducted Petra into its Hall of Fame, with the magazine noting:
Few artists had as much influence in the formation and growth of what has come to be known as &quot;contemporary Christian music&quot; as did Petra. ...As one of the movement&#x27;s trailblazers, Petra bore the brunt of the controversy, enduring picketers, protesters and public denunciations by prominent Christian leaders. (It is, perhaps, a telling sign of the Christian community&#x27;s former resistance to Petra that the band won a Grammy before they ever won a Dove Award!) Still, all rabble-rousers aside, Petra managed to create some of Christian music&#x27;s most treasured recordings.
The list of prominent Christian artists who began by listening to Petra is long, and it includes:

* Bart Millard, lead singer of MercyMe, said &quot;More Power to Ya&quot; was the first album he had bought with his own money. &quot;I bought it twice because I literally wore the first one out,&quot; he wrote in &quot;CCM&quot;. &quot;Because of that record, I became consumed with Christian music.&quot;
* Singer/songwriter Chris Tomlin has listed &quot;Not of This World&quot; as his &quot;first Christian album&quot;.
* The lead singer of rock band Third Day, Mac Powell, said the band formed with the intention of being &quot;the next Petra. You know, we wanted to be the next big band that affected a lot of people through music.&quot;
* Former Newsboys lead singer Peter Furler – who founded Inpop Records, used the label to give Petra a home at the end of its career and produced the band&#x27;s final studio album – and his band opened for Petra early in its career, and guitarist Jody Davis listed his first Petra concert as a major influence on his decision to move into live Christian music.

Many artists have recorded tributes to Petra, including Christian-industry stars MxPx, Jars of Clay, Kevin Max of dc Talk, Sixpence None the Richer, Plankeye, Grammatrain and Galactic Cowboys, all of whom appeared on the tribute album &quot;Never Say Dinosaur&quot;, released in 1996 by Star Song.

<text>Mark Aldanov (; Mordkhai-Markus Israelevich Landau, Mark Alexandrovich Landau, ; – February 25, 1957) was a Russian and later French writer and critic, known for his historical novels.

Aldanov&#x27;s first book about Vladimir Lenin, translated into several languages, immediately gained him popularity. Then followed a trilogy of novels attempting to trace the roots of the Russian Revolution. He also wrote a tetralogy of novels about Napoleonic wars. All in all, he published 16 larger literary works and a great number of articles and essays. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature thirteen times.

==Biography==
Mordkhai-Markus Landau (Aldanov) was born in Kiev in the family of a rich Jewish industrialist. He graduated the physical-mathematical and law departments of Kiev University. He published serious research papers in chemistry. In 1919 he emigrated to France. During 1922-1924 he lived in Berlin and during 1941-1946, in the United States.

Ivan Bunin, the first Russian writer to win the Nobel Prize for Literature, nominated Aldanov for the Nobel Prize a total of six times - in 1938, 1939, 1947, 1948, 1949, and 1950.

Mark Aldanov died in Nice, France. His extensive correspondence with Vladimir Nabokov, Ivan Bunin, Alexander Kerensky and other emigre celebrities was published posthumously.

==&quot;Novy Zhurnal&quot;==
In 1942, while in New York, Aldanov cofounded &quot;Novy Zhurnal&quot; (The New Review; Russian: &quot;Новый журнал&quot;) together with his colleague and friend Mikhail Tsetlin. Until November 1945 they both served as Editors-in-Chief of this publication, which is considered the oldest Russian language literary periodical in print published outside of Russia. Among the review&#x27;s contributors were Vladimir Nabokov, Ivan Bunin, Joseph Brodsky, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, and other notable Russian emigre writers.

==The Aldanov Literary Prize==

Since 2007 &quot;Novy Zhurnal&quot; has been awarding The Aldanov Literary Prize conferred for the best novella or novellete authored by a Russian-language writer living outside or Russia.

<text>Navy Island is a small, uninhabited island in the Niagara River in the province of Ontario, managed by Parks Canada as a National Historic Site of Canada. It is located about 4.5 kilometres (2+3⁄4 miles) upstream from Horseshoe Falls, and has an area of roughly 1.2 km2 (7⁄16 sq mi). It is across from the town of Grand Island, New York, US. It was designated a national historic site in 1921 in recognition of its role in shipbuilding and the location of the short-lived Republic of Canada. The island is the only island in the Niagara River located within Canadian territory and is the second largest Island in the Niagara River. The site is closed to the public, has no visitor facilities, and has not allowed camping since the expiration of a lease with the Niagara Parks Commission.

==History==
Navy Island was formed 10-12,000 years ago by the Wisconsin glaciation. The recession of the ice sheets in the area led to the formation of the Niagara River and the islands within it. Navy Island at the time was .

Navy Island was settled by the Lamoka people of the late Archaic period, in approximately 2000 BC, and later by the Meadowood culture peoples in 1000 BC. Archaeological excavations have revealed a native peoples burial site, along with their arrowheads and scrapers on the shores of the island.

During the French colonization of New France, Navy Island was known as &quot;Île de la Marina&quot;. Here or nearby the French built four ships (bateaux) that they used to service the Great Lakes. Two of these vessels were burnt by the French on Grand Island in 1759. When New France was ceded to the British in 1763, the latter set up the Navy Island Royal Naval Shipyard here. This is where the first naval vessels to sail the Upper Great Lakes were constructed and where the island derives its name from. In the War of 1812, a detachment of the Provincial Marine was stationed on the island with a blockhouse and storehouse built on the southwest side of the island. The shipyard ceased operations around 1813, but was not transferred to Canada (Upper Canada) until 1822.

In 1837, William Lyon Mackenzie and about 200 of his supporters captured the island and proclaimed the Republic of Canada there. The old blockhouse was occupied by the rebel forces. Initially Mackenzie started with twenty-five men, but the population eventually swelled to over six hundred men. On January 11, 1838, the rebels were forced from the island and retreated across the river into the United States.

In the mid 1850&#x27;s, much of the forest covering the island was cleared for farming. By 1865 there were four families living on the island.

In 1875, the Queens Hotel was established as a popular summer resort on the island&#x27;s south side. It was destroyed by fire in 1910.
== Physical properties ==
Farms and orchards were located on the northeast, south, central, northwest, and southwest ends of the island. Since abandoned, most of the farmed lands have been re-forested. Most trees on the island are oak or hickory. There are some reminders of habitation on the south side. A pier still exists that once served boaters to the island.

The Island is federal crown land but has been controlled by the Niagara Parks Commission since 1938. Permits were needed for camping, but camping has since been prohibited. A commemorative plaque for the island is located on the south shore of the Niagara River. 

Access to the island is closed to the general public and used only by Parks Canada staff since a lease with the Niagara Parks Commission expired.

There is a large population of deer who live on the island.

== Proposal for United Nations headquarters and QEW expansion ==
Navy Island was proposed to be the new World Peace Capital and headquarters of the United Nations by an international committee in 1945 and 1946. The island was considered to be an ideal location as it lay on the boundary between two peaceful countries. An artist&#x27;s rendering of the World Peace Capital showed the property with bridges spanning both countries (at Grand Island in the US and the Canadian mainland on the other side). It was proposed that Navy Island would be ceded to the United Nations as long as the headquarters remained, and to revert to the Canadian government should the U.N. move. The proposal was ultimately turned down in favour of the current U.N. headquarters in New York City.

The Island was considered as a location for a new highway route from Grand Island on the US side of the Niagara to the Queen Elizabeth Way in Canada, but the project was ultimately scrapped.

<doc id="1018441" wikidata="Q2129987" url="?curid=1018441" title="FN 303">
<text>The FN 303 is a semi-automatic less-lethal riot gun designed and manufactured by Fabrique Nationale de Herstal.

The FN 303 uses compressed air to fire projectiles from a 15-round drum magazine. It is designed to incapacitate the target through blunt trauma without causing critical injuries, and is most widely used for riot control and other kinds of combat where lethal weapons should be avoided.

The 303 can be fired from the shoulder using adjustable iron sights, or it can be mounted in an under-barrel configuration on most assault rifles when its stock assembly is removed (in this configuration, it is designated &quot;M303&quot;). It also comes with a top-mounted Picatinny rail that can fit most commercial weapon accessories, such as telescopic sights, laser sights and tactical lights. FN markets its own set of accessories for the launcher, including tactical vests, slings, carrying bags, and gas compressors. It is accurate at distances up to .

FN also produce a pistol variant, the FN 303-P, in the same caliber, using a seven-round magazine with a self-contained gas cartridge.

==History==
The FN 303 is based on a project by the Monterey Bay Corporation designated the XM303. The development team consisted of designers and researchers from two paintball related design and manufacturing firms, including Airgun Designs. The prototype was named the UBTPS, Under Barrel Tactical Paintball System.

The design could be attached to an M16 rifle and was conceived as a less-than-lethal weapon system coupled with a lethal weapon system, providing a wide range of response capabilities that were immediately available. A stand-alone version was also developed.

The UBTPS also featured a rotating barrel magazine, allowing for a wide range of different projectiles to be available and selectable without the need to change magazines.

Also developed was a bismuth-weighted projectile to provide the necessary mass, allowing the UTPBS to achieve the engagement range requirements.

==Ammunition==
The FN 303 fires a spherical, fin-stabilized projectile. According to FN, the fin-stabilized design provides greater accuracy than a standard paintball round. The forward half of the sphere is a non-toxic granulated bismuth shell designed to fragment on impact to prevent penetration damage. The rear half of the sphere contains one of several color-coded liquid payloads:

*Training/Impact (clear): non-toxic glycol base with no additives, used for training and when the impact sting is the preferred deterrent.
*Permanent paint (yellow): latex-based polymer paint used to mark suspects for later identification.
*Washable paint (pink): water-soluble fluorescent pink pigment in glycol base, similar to standard paintball filling, used to mark suspects short-term.
*Oleoresin capsicum (orange): glycol base mixed with 10% OC (pepper spray) at 5 million SHU, used to incapacitate targets.

The mass of the projectile is , providing a muzzle energy of .

==Safety==
In October 2004, in Boston, Massachusetts, Victoria Snelgrove was struck in the eye by an FN 303 round fired by a member of the Boston Police Department (BPD), leading to her death approximately 12 hours later. An autopsy found that the pellet opened a three-quarter-inch (1.9 cm) hole in the bone behind the eye, broke into nine pieces, and damaged the right side of her brain. Subsequent tests by the BPD indicated that the FN 303&#x27;s accuracy &quot;decreased significantly&quot; after about 300 firings. This is circumstantially corroborated by testimony of the officer who fired the weapon, stating that he was aiming at a rioter throwing bottles and did not know that a bystander had been hit. A $15 million wrongful death lawsuit against the City of Boston and FN Herstal was settled in July 2006. In 2007, the BPD destroyed their remaining FN 303s, stating they were more powerful and lethal than had been anticipated.

During protests in front of the Arcelor building in Luxembourg city on 11 May 2009, the weapon was used for the first time by local police. An RTL cameraman was hit in the hand, breaking one finger.

On 2 June 2013, during Gezi Park protests in Ankara, Turkey, a protester was wounded in the face by a &quot;plastic bullet&quot;, later attributed to police use of the FN 303.

During Independence Day demonstrations in Finland on 6 December 2015, police used FN 303 against counter-protesters, with one receiving eye injuries from projectile fragments.

A 2019 study found that the performance of the FN 303 was significantly worse outside of a laboratory setting. Operational conditions were simulated by inducing physiological and psychological stress, and measuring salivary cortisol; accuracy and reported ease of use were both lower than that of the control group.

<text>The Second Battle of Kharkov or Operation Fredericus was an Axis counter-offensive in the region around Kharkov against the Red Army Izium bridgehead offensive conducted 12–28 May 1942, on the Eastern Front during World War II. Its objective was to eliminate the Izium bridgehead over Seversky Donets or the &quot;Barvenkovo bulge&quot; () which was one of the Soviet offensive&#x27;s staging areas. After a winter counter-offensive that drove German troops away from Moscow but depleted the Red Army&#x27;s reserves, the Kharkov offensive was a new Soviet attempt to expand upon their strategic initiative, although it failed to secure a significant element of surprise.

On 12 May 1942, Soviet forces under the command of Marshal Semyon Timoshenko launched an offensive against the German 6th Army from a salient established during the winter counter-offensive. After a promising start, the offensive was stopped on 15 May by massive airstrikes. Critical Soviet errors by several staff officers and by Joseph Stalin, who failed to accurately estimate the 6th Army&#x27;s potential and overestimated their own newly raised forces, facilitated a German pincer attack on 17 May which cut off three Soviet field armies from the rest of the front by 22 May. Hemmed into a narrow area, the 250,000-strong Soviet force inside the pocket was exterminated from all sides by German armored, artillery and machine gun firepower as well as 7,700 tonnes of air-dropped bombs. After six days of encirclement, Soviet resistance ended, with the remaining troops being killed or surrendering.

The battle was an overwhelming German victory, with 280,000 Soviet casualties compared to just 20,000 for the Germans and their allies. The German Army Group South pressed its advantage, encircling the Soviet 28th Army on 13 June in Operation Wilhelm and pushing back the 38th and 9th Armies on 22 June in Operation Fridericus II as preliminary operations to Case Blue, which was launched on 28 June as the main German offensive on the Eastern Front in 1942.

==Background==
===General situation on the Eastern Front===
By late February 1942, the Soviet winter counter-offensive, had pushed German forces from Moscow on a broad front and then ended in mutual exhaustion. Stalin was convinced that the Germans were finished and would collapse by the spring or summer 1942, as he said in his speech of 7 November 1941. Stalin decided to exploit this perceived weakness on the Eastern Front by launching a new offensive in the spring. Stalin&#x27;s decision faced objections from his advisors, including the Chief of the Red Army General Staff, General Boris Shaposhnikov, and generals Aleksandr Vasilevsky and Georgy Zhukov, who argued for a more defensive strategy. Vasilevsky wrote &quot;Yes, we were hoping for [German reserves to run out], but the reality was more harsh than that&quot;. According to Zhukov, Stalin believed that the Germans were able to carry out operations simultaneously along two strategic axes, he was sure that the opening of a spring offensives along the entire front would destabilise the German Army, before it had a chance to initiate what could be a mortal offensive blow on Moscow. Despite the caution urged by his generals, Stalin decided to try to keep the German forces off-balance through &quot;local offensives&quot;.

===Choosing the strategy===
After the conclusion of the winter offensive, Stalin and the Soviet Armed Forces General Staff (Stavka) believed that the eventual German offensives would aim for Moscow, and also with a big offensive to the south, mirroring Operation Barbarossa and Operation Typhoon in 1941. Although the Stavka believed that the Germans had been defeated before Moscow, the seventy divisions which faced Moscow remained a threat. Stalin, most generals and front commanders believed that the principal effort would be a German offensive towards Moscow. Emboldened by the success of the winter offensive, Stalin was convinced that local offensives in the area would wear down German forces, weakening German efforts to mount another operation to take Moscow. Stalin had agreed to prepare the Red Army for an &quot;active strategic defence&quot; but later gave orders for the planning of seven local offensives, stretching from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea. One area was Kharkov, where action was originally ordered for March.

Early that month, the Stavka issued orders to Southwestern Strategic Direction headquarters for an offensive in the region, after the victories following the Rostov Strategic Offensive Operation (27 November – 2 December 1941) and the Barvenkovo–Lozovaya Offensive Operation (18–31 January 1942) in the Donbas region. The forces of Marshal Semyon Timoshenko and Lieutenant General Kirill Moskalenko penetrated German positions along the northern Donets River, east of Kharkov. Fighting continued into April, with Moskalenko crossing the river and establishing a tenuous bridgehead at Izium. In the south, the Soviet 6th Army had limited success defending against German forces, which managed to keep a bridgehead of their own on the east bank of the river. Catching the attention of Stalin, it set the pace for the prelude to the eventual offensive intended to reach Pavlohrad and Sinelnikovo and eventually Kharkov and Poltava.

By 15 March, Soviet commanders introduced preliminary plans for an offensive towards Kharkov, assisted by a large number of reserves. On 20 March, Timoshenko held a conference in Kupiansk to discuss the offensive and a report to Moscow, prepared by Timoshenko&#x27;s chief of staff, Lieutenant General Ivan Baghramian, summed up the conference, although arguably leaving several key intelligence features out. The build-up of Soviet forces in the region of Barvenkovo and Vovchansk continued well into the beginning of May. Final details were settled following discussions between Stalin, Stavka and the leadership of the Southwestern Strategic Direction led by Timoshenko throughout March and April, with one of the final Stavka directives issued on 17 April.

==Prelude==
===Soviet order of battle===
By 11 May 1942, the Red Army was able to allocate six armies under two fronts, amongst other formations. The Southwestern Front had the 21st Army, 28th Army, 38th Army and the 6th Army. By 11 May, the 21st Tank Corps had been moved into the region with the 23rd Tank Corps, with another 269 tanks. There were also three independent rifle divisions and a rifle regiment from the 270th Rifle Division, concentrated in the area, supported by the 2nd Cavalry Corps in Bogdanovka. The Soviet Southern Front had the 57th and 9th armies, along with thirty rifle divisions, a rifle brigade and the 24th Tank Corps, the 5th Cavalry Corps and three Guards rifle divisions. At its height, the Southern Front could operate eleven guns or mortars per kilometre of front.

Forces regrouping in the sector ran into the &quot;rasputitsa&quot;, which turned much of the soil into mud. This caused severe delays in the preparations and made reinforcing the Southern and Southwestern Front take longer than expected. Senior Soviet representatives criticised the front commanders for poor management of forces, an inability to stage offensives and for their armchair generalship. Because the regrouping was done so haphazardly, the Germans received some warning of Soviet preparations. Moskalenko, the commander of the 38th Army, placed the blame on the fact that the fronts did not plan in advance to regroup and showed a poor display of front management. (He commented afterwards that it was no surprise that the &quot;German-Fascist command divined our plans&quot;.)

===Soviet leadership and manpower===
The primary Soviet leader was Timoshenko, a veteran of World War I and the Russian Civil War. Timoshenko had achieved some success at the Battle of Smolensk in 1941 but was eventually defeated. Timoshenko orchestrated the victory at Rostov during the winter counter-attacks and more success in the spring offensive at Kharkov before the battle itself. Overseeing the actions of the army was Military Commissar Nikita Khrushchev.

The average Soviet soldier suffered from inexperience. With the Soviet debacle of the previous year ameliorated only by the barest victory at Moscow, most of the original manpower of the Red Army had been killed, wounded or captured by the Germans, with casualties of almost 1,000,000 just from the Battle of Moscow. The typical soldier in the Red Army was a conscript and had little to no combat experience, and tactical training was practically nonexistent. Coupled with the lack of trained soldiers, the Red Army also began to suffer from the loss of Soviet industrial areas, and a temporary strategic defence was considered necessary.

The General Chief of Staff, Marshal Vasilevsky, recognised that the Soviet Army of 1942 was not ready to conduct major offensive operations against the well-trained German army, because it did not have quantitative and qualitative superiority and because leadership was being rebuilt after the defeats of 1941. (This analysis is retrospective and is an analysis of Soviet conduct during their strategic offensives in 1942, and even beyond, such as Operation Mars in October 1942 and the Battle of Târgul Frumos in May 1944.)

===German preparations===
Unknown to the Soviet forces, the German 6th Army, under the newly appointed General Paulus, was issued orders for Operation Fredericus on 30 April 1942. This operation was to crush the Soviet armies within the Izyum salient south of Kharkov, created during the Soviet spring offensives in March and April. The final directive for this offensive, issued on 30 April, gave a start date of 18 May.

The Germans had made a major effort to reinforce Army Group South, and transferred Field Marshal Fedor von Bock, former commander of Army Group Center during Operation Barbarossa and Operation Typhoon. On 5 April 1942, Hitler issued Directive 41, which made the south the main area of operations under Case Blue, the summer campaign, at the expense of the other fronts. The divisions of Army Group South were brought up to full strength in late April and early May. The strategic objective was illustrated after the victories of Erich von Manstein and the 11th Army in the Crimea. The main objective remained the Caucasus, its oil fields and as a secondary objective, the city of Stalingrad.

The plan to begin Operation Fredericus in April led to more forces being allocated to the area of the German 6th Army. Unknown to the Soviet forces, the German army was regrouping in the center of operations for the offensive around Kharkov. On 10 May, Paulus submitted his final draft of Operation Fredericus and feared a Soviet attack. By then, the German army opposite Timoshenko was ready for the operation towards the Caucasus.

==Soviet offensive==
===Initial success===
The Red Army offensive began at 6:30 a.m. on 12 May 1942, led by a concentrated hour-long artillery bombardment and a final twenty-minute air attack upon German positions. The ground offensive began with a dual pincer movement from the Volchansk and Barvenkovo salients at 7:30 am. The German defences were knocked out by air raids, artillery-fire and coordinated ground attacks. The fighting was so fierce that the Soviets inched forward their second echelon formations, preparing to throw them into combat as well. Fighting was particularly ferocious near the Soviet village of Nepokrytaia, where the Germans launched three local counter-attacks. The Luftwaffe&#x27;s fighter aircraft, despite their numerical inferiority, quickly defeated the Soviet air units in the airspace above the battle area, but without bombers, dive-bombers and ground-attack aircraft they could only strafe with their machine guns, drop small bombs on Soviet supply columns, and pin down infantry. By dark, the deepest Soviet advance was . Moskalenko, commander of the 38th Army, discovered the movement of several German reserve units and realised that the attack had been opposed by two German divisions, not the one expected, indicating poor Soviet reconnaissance and intelligence-gathering before the battle. A captured diary of a dead German general alluded to the Germans knowing about Soviet plans in the region.

Next day Paulus obtained three infantry divisions and a panzer division for the defence of Kharkov and the Soviet advance was slow, achieving little success except on the left flank. Bock had warned Paulus not to counter-attack without air support, although this was later reconsidered, when several Soviet tank brigades broke through VIII Corps (General Walter Heitz) in the Volchansk sector, only from Kharkov. In the first 72 hours the 6th Army lost 16 battalions conducting holding actions and local counter-attacks in the heavy rain and mud. By 14 May the Red Army had made impressive gains, but several Soviet divisions were so depleted that they were withdrawn and Soviet tank reserves were needed to defeat the German counter-attacks; German losses were estimated to be minimal, with only 35–70 tanks believed to have been knocked out in the 3rd and 23rd Panzer divisions.

===Luftwaffe===
Hitler immediately turned to the Luftwaffe to help blunt the offensive. At this point, its close support corps was deployed in Crimea, taking part in the siege of Sevastopol. Under the command of Wolfram von Richthofen, the 8th Air Corps was initially ordered to deploy to Kharkov from Crimea, but this order was rescinded. In an unusual move, Hitler kept it in Crimea, but did not put the corps under the command of &quot;Luftflotte 4&quot; (Air Fleet 4), which already contained 4th Air Corps, under the command of General Kurt Pflugbeil, and &quot;Fliegerführer Süd&quot; (Flying Command South), a small anti-shipping command based in Crimea. Instead, he allowed Richthofen to take charge of all operations over Sevastopol. The siege in Crimea was not over, and the Battle of the Kerch Peninsula had not yet been won. Hitler was pleased with the progress there and content to keep Richthofen where he was, but he withdrew close support assets from &quot;Fliegerkorps VIII&quot; in order to prevent a Soviet breakthrough at Kharkov. The use of the Luftwaffe to compensate for the German Army&#x27;s lack of firepower suggested to Richthofen that the &quot;Oberkommando der Wehrmacht&quot; (OKW, &quot;High Command of the Armed Forces&quot;) saw the Luftwaffe mainly as a ground support arm. This angered Richthofen who complained that the Luftwaffe was treated as &quot;the army&#x27;s whore&quot;. Now that he was not being redeployed to Kharkov, Richthofen also complained about the withdrawal of his units from the ongoing Kerch and Sevastopol battles. He felt that the transfer of aerial assets to Kharkov made victory in Crimea uncertain. In reality, the Soviet units at Kerch were already routed and the Axis position at Sevastopol was comfortable.

Despite Richthofen&#x27;s opposition, powerful air support was on its way to bolster the 6th Army and this news boosted German morale. Army commanders, such as Paulus and Bock, placed so much confidence in the Luftwaffe that they ordered their forces not to risk an attack without air support. In the meantime, &quot;Fliegerkorps IV&quot;, was forced to use every available aircraft. Although meeting more numerous Soviet air forces, the Luftwaffe achieved air superiority and limited the German ground forces&#x27; losses to Soviet aviation, but with some crews flying more than 10 missions per day. By 15 May, Pflugbeil was reinforced and received &quot;Kampfgeschwader 27&quot; (Bomber Wing 27, or KG 27), &quot;Kampfgeschwader 51&quot; (KG 51), &quot;Kampfgeschwader 55&quot; (KG 55) and &quot;Kampfgeschwader 76&quot; (KG 76) equipped with Junkers Ju 88 and Heinkel He 111 bombers. &quot;Sturzkampfgeschwader 77&quot; (Dive Bomber Wing 77, or StG 77) also arrived to add direct ground support. Pflugbeil now had 10 bomber, six fighter and four Junkers Ju 87 &quot;Stuka&quot; &quot;Gruppen&quot; (Groups). Logistical difficulties meant that only 54.5 per cent were operational at any given time.

===German defence===

German close air support made its presence felt immediately on 15 May, forcing units such as the Soviet 38th Army onto the defensive. It ranged over the front, operating dangerously close to the changing frontline. Air interdiction and direct ground support damaged Soviet supply lines and rear areas, also inflicting large losses on their armoured formations. General Franz Halder praised the air strikes as being primarily responsible for breaking the Soviet offensive. The Soviet air force could do very little to stop Pflugbeil&#x27;s 4th Air Corps. It not only attacked the enemy but also carried out vital supply missions. Bombers dropped supplies to encircled German units, which could continue to hold out until a counter-offensive relieved them. The 4th Air Corps anti-aircraft units also used their high-velocity 8.8 cm guns on the Soviet ground forces. Over the course of the 16-day battle the 4th Air Corps played a major role in the German victory, conducting 15,648 sorties (978 per day), dropping 7,700 tonnes of bombs on the Soviet forces and lifting 1,545 tonnes of material to the front.

On 14 May, the Germans continued to attack Soviet positions in the north in localised offensives and by then, the Luftwaffe had gained air superiority over the Kharkov sector, forcing Timoshenko to move his own aircraft forward to counter the bolstered &quot;Luftflotte 4&quot;. The Luftwaffe won air superiority over their numerically superior, but technically inferior opponents. The air battles depleted the Soviet fighter strength, allowing the German strike aircraft the chance to influence the land battle even more. Nonetheless, the Soviet forces pushed on, disengaging from several minor battles and changing the direction of their thrusts. However, in the face of continued resistance and local counterattacks, the Soviet attack ebbed, especially when combined with the invariably heavy air raids. By the end of the day, the 28th Army could no longer conduct offensive operations against German positions.

Soviet troops in the northern pincer suffered even more than those in the south. They achieved spectacular success the first three days of combat, with a deep penetration of German positions. The Red Army routed several key German battalions, including many with Hungarian and other foreign soldiers. The success of the Southern Shock group, however, has been attributed to the fact that the early penetrations in the north had directed German reserves there, thus limiting the reinforcements to the south. But, by 14 May, Hitler had briefed General Ewald von Kleist and ordered his 1st Panzer Army to grab the initiative in a bold counteroffensive, setting the pace for the final launching of Operation Fridericus.

===Second phase of the offensive===

On 15 and 16 May, another attempted Soviet offensive in the north met the same resistance encountered on the three first days of the battle. German bastions continued to hold out against Soviet assaults. The major contribution to Soviet frustration in the battle was the lack of heavy artillery, which ultimately prevented the taking of heavily defended positions. One of the best examples of this was the defence of Ternovaya, where defending German units absolutely refused to surrender. The fighting was so harsh that, after advancing an average of five kilometres, the offensive stopped for the day in the north. The next day saw a renewal of the Soviet attack, which was largely blocked by counterattacks by German tanks; the tired Soviet divisions could simply not hold their own against the concerted attacks from the opposition. The south, however, achieved success, much like the earlier days of the battle, although Soviet forces began to face heavier air strikes from German aircraft. 

The Germans, on the other hand, had spent the day fighting holding actions in both sectors, launching small counterattacks to whittle away at Soviet offensive potential, while continuously moving up reinforcements from the south, including several aircraft squadrons transferred from the Crimea. Poor decisions by the 150th Rifle Division, which had successfully crossed the Barvenkovo River, played a major part in the poor exploitation of the tactical successes of the southern shock group. Timoshenko was unable to choose a point of main effort for his advancing troops, preferring a broad-front approach instead. The Germans traded space for time, which suited their intentions well.

===1st Panzer Army counterattacks===
On 17 May, supported by &quot;Fliegerkorps IV&quot;, the German army took the initiative, as Kleist&#x27;s 3rd Panzer Corps and 44th Army Corps began a counterattack on the Barvenkovo bridgehead from the area of Aleksandrovka in the south. Aided greatly by air support, Kleist was able to crush Soviet positions and advanced up to ten kilometres in the first day of the attack. Soviet troop and supply convoys were easy targets for ferocious Luftwaffe attacks, possessing few anti-aircraft guns and having left their rail-heads 100 kilometres to the rear. German reconnaissance aircraft monitored enemy movements, directed attack aircraft to Soviet positions and corrected German artillery fire. The response time of the 4th Air Corps to calls for air strikes was excellent, only 20 minutes. Many of the Soviet units were sent to the rear that night to be refitted, while others were moved forward to reinforce tenuous positions across the front. That same day, Timoshenko reported the move to Moscow and asked for reinforcements and described the day&#x27;s failures. Vasilevsky&#x27;s attempts to gain approval for a general withdrawal were rejected by Stalin.

On 18 May, the situation worsened and Stavka suggested once more stopping the offensive and ordered the 9th Army to break out of the salient. Timoshenko and Khrushchev claimed that the danger coming from the Wehrmacht&#x27;s Kramatorsk group was exaggerated, and Stalin refused the withdrawal again. The consequences of losing the air battle were also apparent. On 18 May the &quot;Fliegerkorps IV&quot; destroyed 130 tanks and 500 motor vehicles, while adding another 29 tanks destroyed on 19 May.

On 19 May, Paulus, on orders from Bock, began a general offensive from the area of Merefa in the north of the bulge in an attempt to encircle the remaining Soviet forces in the Izium salient. Only then did Stalin authorise Zhukov to stop the offensive and fend off German flanking forces. However, it was already too late. Quickly, the Germans achieved considerable success against Soviet defensive positions. The 20 May saw more of the same, with the German forces closing in from the rear. More German divisions were committed to the battle that day, shattering several Soviet counterparts, allowing the Germans to press forward. The Luftwaffe also intensified operations over the Donets River to prevent Soviet forces escaping. Ju 87s from StG 77 destroyed five of the main bridges and damaged four more while Ju 88 bombers from &quot;Kampfgeschwader 3&quot; (KG 3) inflicted heavy losses on retreating motorised and armoured columns.

Although Timoshenko&#x27;s forces successfully regrouped on 21 May, he ordered a withdrawal of Army Group Kotenko by the end of 22 May, while he prepared an attack for 23 May, to be orchestrated by the 9th and 57th Armies. Although the Red Army desperately attempted to fend off advancing Wehrmacht and launched local counterattacks to relieve several surrounded units, they generally failed. By the end of May 24, Soviet forces opposite Kharkov had been surrounded by German formations, which had been able to transfer several more divisions to the front, increasing the pressure on the Soviet flanks and finally forcing them to collapse.

===Soviet break-out attempts===

The 25 May saw the first major Soviet attempt to break the encirclement. German Major General Hubert Lanz described the attacks as gruesome, made &quot;en masse&quot;. Driven by blind courage, the Soviet soldiers charged at German machine guns with their arms linked, shouting &quot;Urray!&quot;. The German machine gunners had no need for accuracy, killing hundreds in quick bursts of fire. In broad daylight, the Luftwaffe, now enjoying complete air supremacy and the absence of Soviet anti-aircraft guns, rained down SD2 anti-personnel cluster bombs on the exposed Soviet infantry masses, killing them in droves.

By 26 May, the surviving Red Army soldiers were forced into crowded positions in an area of roughly fifteen square kilometres. Soviet attempts to break through the German encirclement in the east were continuously blocked by tenacious defensive manoeuvres and German air power. Groups of Soviet tanks and infantry that attempted to escape and succeeded in breaking through German lines were caught and destroyed by Ju 87s from StG 77. The flat terrain secured easy observation for the Germans, whose forward observers directed long-range 10.5 cm and 15 cm artillery fire onto the Soviets from a safe distance to conserve the German infantrymen. More than 200,000 Soviet troops, hundreds of tanks and thousands of trucks and horse-drawn wagons filled the narrow dirt road between Krutoyarka and Fedorovka and were under constant German artillery fire and relentless air strikes from Ju 87s, Ju 88s and He 111s. SD-2 cluster munitions killed the unprotected infantry and SC250 bombs smashed up the Soviet vehicles and T-34 tanks. Destroyed vehicles and thousands of dead and dying Red Army soldiers choked up the road and the nearby ravines. was killed by German machine gun fire and two more Soviet generals were killed in action on the 26th and 27th. Bock personally viewed the carnage from a hill near Lozovenka.

In the face of determined German operations, Timoshenko ordered the official halt of all Soviet offensive manoeuvres on 28 May, while attacks to break out of the encirclement continued until 30 May. Nonetheless, less than one man in ten managed to break out of the &quot;Barvenkovo mousetrap&quot;. Hayward gives 75,000 Soviets killed and 239,000 taken prisoner. Beevor puts Soviet prisoners at 240,000 (with the bulk of their armour), while Glantz—citing Krivosheev—gives a total of 277,190 overall Soviet casualties. Both tend to agree on a low German casualty count, with the most formative estimate being at 20,000 dead, wounded and missing. Regardless of the casualties, Kharkov was a major Soviet setback; it put an end to the successes of the Red Army during the winter counteroffensive.

==Analysis and conclusions==

Many authors have attempted to pinpoint the reasons for the Soviet defeat. Several Soviet generals have placed the blame on the inability of Stavka and Stalin to appreciate the Wehrmacht&#x27;s military power on the Eastern Front after their defeats in the winter of 1941–1942 and in the spring of 1942. On the subject, Zhukov sums up in his memoirs that the failure of this operation was quite predictable, since the offensive was organised very ineptly, the risk of exposing the left flank of the Izium salient to German counterattacks being obvious on a map. Still according to Zhukov, the main reason for the stinging Soviet defeat lay in the mistakes made by Stalin, who underestimated the danger coming from German armies in the southwestern sector (as opposed to the Moscow sector) and failed to take steps to concentrate any substantial strategic reserves there to meet any potential German threat. Furthermore, Stalin ignored sensible advice provided by his own General Chief of Staff, who recommended organising a strong defence in the southwestern sector in order to be able to repulse any Wehrmacht attack. In his famous address to the Twentieth Party Congress about the crimes of Stalin, Khrushchev used the Soviet leader&#x27;s errors in this campaign as an example, saying: &quot;Contrary to common sense, Stalin rejected our suggestion. He issued the order to continue the encirclement of Kharkov, despite the fact that at this time many [of our own] Army concentrations actually were threatened with encirclement and liquidation... And what was the result of this? The worst we had expected. The Germans surrounded our Army concentrations and as a result [the Kharkov counterattack] lost hundreds of thousands of our soldiers. This is Stalin&#x27;s military &#x27;genius&#x27;. This is what it cost us.&quot;

Additionally, the subordinate Soviet generals (especially South-Western Front generals) were just as willing to continue their own winter successes, and much like the German generals, underestimated the strength of their enemies, as pointed out &quot;a posteriori&quot; by Moskalenko, the commander of the 38th Army. The Soviet winter counteroffensive weakened the Wehrmacht, but did not destroy it. As Moskalenko recalls, quoting an anonymous soldier, &quot;these fascists woke up after they hibernated&quot;.
Stalin&#x27;s willingness to expend recently conscripted armies, which were poorly trained and poorly supplied, illustrated a misconception of realities, both in the capabilities of the Red Army and the subordinate arms of the armed forces, and in the abilities of the Germans to defend themselves and successfully launch a counteroffensive. The latter proved especially true in the subsequent Case Blue, which led to the Battle of Stalingrad, though this was the battle in which Paulus faced an entirely different outcome.

The battle had shown the potential of the Soviet armies to successfully conduct an offensive. This battle can be seen as one of the first major instances in which the Soviets attempted to preempt a German summer offensive. This later unfolded and grew as Stavka planned and conducted Operation Mars, Operation Uranus and Operation Saturn. Although only two of the three were victories, it still offers concise and telling evidence of the ability of the Soviets to turn the war in their favour. This finalised itself after the Battle of Kursk in July 1943. The Second Battle of Kharkov also had a positive effect on Stalin, who started to trust his commanders and his Chief of Staff more (allowing the latter to have the last word in naming front commanders for instance). After the great purge in 1937, failing to anticipate the war in 1941, and underestimating German military power in 1942, Stalin finally fully trusted his military.

Within the context of the battle itself, the failure of the Red Army to properly regroup during the prelude to the battle and the ability of the Germans to effectively collect intelligence on Soviet movements played an important role in the outcome. Poor Soviet performance in the north and equally poor intelligence-gathering at the hands of Stavka and front headquarters, also eventually spelled doom for the offensive. Nonetheless, despite this poor performance, it underscored a dedicated evolution of operations and tactics within the Red Army which borrowed and refined the pre-war theory, Soviet deep battle.

<text>Baby Ruth is an American candy bar made of peanuts, caramel, and milk chocolate-flavored nougat, covered in compound chocolate. Created in 1920, it is manufactured by the Ferrara Candy Company, a subsidiary of Ferrero.

== History ==
In 1920, the Curtiss Candy Company refashioned its Kandy Kake into the Baby Ruth, and it became the best-selling confection in the five-cent confectionery category by the late 1920s. The bar was a staple of the Chicago-based company for more than six decades.

Curtiss was purchased by Nabisco in 1981. In 1990, RJR Nabisco sold the Curtiss brands to Nestlé. Ferrero acquired Nestlé USA&#x27;s confectionery brands, including Baby Ruth, in 2018. Ferrero folded production of the acquired brands into the Ferrara Candy Company.

Ferrara relaunched Baby Ruth in December 2019. The new recipe includes dry-roasted peanuts grown in the United States, whereas previous versions contained peanuts roasted in oil. It also removed the food preservative TBHQ.

==Etymology==


Although the name of the candy bar sounds like the name of the famous baseball player Babe Ruth, the Curtiss Candy Company claimed that it was named after President Grover Cleveland&#x27;s daughter, Ruth Cleveland. The candy maker, located on the same street as Wrigley Field, named the bar &quot;Baby Ruth&quot; in 1921, as Babe Ruth&#x27;s fame was on the rise, 24 years after Cleveland had left the White House, and 17 years after his daughter, Ruth, had died. The company did not negotiate an endorsement deal with Ruth, and many saw the company&#x27;s story about the origin of the name to be a way to avoid having to pay the baseball player any royalties. In a trademark appeal, Curtiss successfully shut down a rival bar that was approved by, and named for, Ruth, on the grounds that the names were too similar.

In the trivia book series &quot;Imponderables&quot;, David Feldman reports the standard story about the bar being named for Grover Cleveland&#x27;s daughter, with additional information that ties it to the President: &quot;The trademark was patterned exactly after the engraved lettering of the name used on a medallion struck for the Chicago World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in 1893 and picturing the President, his wife, and daughter Baby Ruth.&quot; However, this may have been an after-the-fact covering maneuver. Feldman also cites &quot;More Misinformation&quot;, by Tom Burnam: &quot;Burnam concluded that the candy bar was named ... after the granddaughter of Mr. and Mrs. George Williamson, candy makers who developed the original formula and sold it to Curtiss.&quot; (Williamson had also sold the &quot;Oh Henry!&quot; formula to Curtiss around that time.) The write-up goes on to note that marketing the product as being named for a company executive&#x27;s granddaughter would likely have been less successful, hence their &quot;official&quot; story.

However, David Mikkelson of Snopes.com denies the claim that the Williamsons invented the recipe, as George Williamson was head of the Williamson Candy Company, producers of the Oh Henry! bar. He continues to say that &quot;the Baby Ruth bar came about when Otto Schnering, founder of the Curtiss Candy Company, made some alterations to his company&#x27;s first candy offering, a confection known as &#x27;Kandy Kake.

==Marketing==
To promote the candy, company founder Otto Schnering chartered a plane in 1923 to drop thousands of Baby Ruth bars, each with its own miniature parachute, over the city of Pittsburgh. Thereafter, Schnering performed the parachute drops in various cities in over forty states.

In 1929, the Curtiss Candy Company sponsored &quot;The Baby Ruth Hour&quot;, a CBS Radio program.

As if to tweak their own official denial of the name&#x27;s origin, after Babe Ruth&#x27;s &quot;called shot&quot; at Chicago&#x27;s Wrigley Field in the 1932 World Series, Curtiss installed an illuminated advertising sign for Baby Ruth on the roof of one of the flats across Sheffield Avenue, near where Ruth&#x27;s home run ball had landed in center field. The sign stood for some four decades before being removed.

In 1985, Nabisco paid $100,000 for the product placement of Baby Ruth to appear in the film &quot;The Goonies&quot;.

In 1992, the company sponsored Bill Davis Racing&#x27;s NASCAR Busch Grand National Series #1 Ford for future NASCAR superstar Jeff Gordon. The following year, the sponsorship moved to Jeff Burton&#x27;s #8 Ford.

In 1995, a company representing the Ruth estate licensed his name and likeness for use in a Baby Ruth marketing campaign.

On p. 34 of the spring 2007 edition of the Chicago Cubs game program, there is a full-page ad showing a partially unwrapped Baby Ruth in front of the Wrigley ivy, with the caption, &quot;The official candy bar of major league baseball, and proud sponsor of the Chicago Cubs.&quot;

Continuing the baseball-oriented theme, during the summer and post-season of the 2007 season, a TV ad for the candy bar showed an entire stadium (identified as Dodger Stadium) filled with people munching Baby Ruths, and thus having to hum rather than singing along with &quot;Take Me Out to the Ball Game&quot; during the seventh-inning stretch.

Nestlé produces a Baby Ruth ice cream bar with a milk chocolate coating, chocolate-covered peanuts, and a vanilla-and-nougat flavored ice cream center. Nestlé also produces Baby Ruth Crisp bars, which are chocolate-covered wafer cookies, with a caramel-flavored cream and crushed peanuts. This is part of a line of Nestlé products under the Crisp name, including Nestlé Crunch Crisp and Butterfinger Crisp.

In the television series &quot;Friends&quot;, Rachel Green (played by Jennifer Aniston) and Ross Geller (played by David Schwimmer) are discussing baby names, almost settling on the name Ruth until Rachel excitedly says &quot;Yes! We&#x27;re having a little baby Ruth...&quot; and they realize the obvious brand recognition joke.

<doc id="1018479" wikidata="Q2345627" url="?curid=1018479" title="Hal Jordan">
<text>Harold &quot;Hal&quot; Jordan, one of the characters known as [[Green Lantern]], is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character was created in 1959 by writer John Broome and artist Gil Kane, and first appeared in &quot;Showcase&quot; #22 (October 1959). Hal Jordan is a reinvention of the previous Green Lantern, who appeared in 1940s comic books as the character Alan Scott.

Hal Jordan is a former fighter pilot who works for Ferris Aircraft as a test pilot, a member and occasionally leader of an intergalactic police force called the Green Lantern Corps, as well as a founding member of the Justice League, DC&#x27;s flagship superhero team, alongside well-known heroes such as Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman. He fights evil across the universe with a ring that grants him various superpowers but is usually portrayed as one of the protectors of Sector 2814, where Earth resides. His powers derive from his power ring and Green Lantern battery, which, in the hands of someone capable of overcoming great fear, allows the user to channel their willpower into creating all fantastic constructs. Jordan uses this power to fly, even through the vacuum of space, to create shields, swords, and lasers, and to construct his Green Lantern costume, which protects his secret identity in his civilian life on Earth. Jordan and all other Green Lanterns are monitored and empowered by the mysterious Guardians of the Universe, who were developed by editor Julius Schwartz. Broome had originally conceived years prior in a story featuring Captain Comet in &quot;Strange Adventures #22&quot; (July 1952) entitled &quot;Guardians of the Clockwork Universe&quot;.

During the 1990s, Jordan also appeared as a villain. The &quot;Emerald Twilight&quot; and &quot;Zero Hour: Crisis in Time!&quot; storylines see him become the villain Parallax following Mongul&#x27;s destruction of his hometown Coast City, kill most of the Green Lantern Corps, and threaten to destroy the universe. In subsequent years, Parallax is revealed to be an evil cosmic entity who corrupted Jordan. Between his stint as Parallax and return to being a Green Lantern, Jordan also briefly served as the Spectre, an agent of God and the embodiment of his wrath. 

Outside of comics, Hal Jordan has appeared in various animated projects, video games and live-action. Jordan&#x27;s original design in the comics was based on actor Paul Newman, and the character is ranked 7th on IGN&#x27;s in the Top 100 Comic Book Heroes in 2011. In 2013, Jordan placed 4th on IGN&#x27;s Top 25 Heroes of DC Comics. In 2012, character was revealed to be Jewish.1 2 

Hal Jordan&#x27;s first live action appearance was in the 1978 television special &quot;Legends of the Superheroes&quot;, where he was played by Howard Murphy. He made his cinematic debut in the 2011 film &quot;Green Lantern&quot;, portrayed by Ryan Reynolds, and will be portrayed by Kyle Chandler in the DC Universe, beginning with the series &quot;Lanterns&quot;. In animation, Jordan has notably been voiced by Jonah Hill, Nathan Fillion, Michael Rye, and Josh Keaton.

==Publication history==
===Recreated for the Silver Age===
After achieving great success in 1956 in reviving the Golden Age character The Flash, DC editor Julius Schwartz looked toward recreating the Green Lantern from the Golden Age of Comic Books. Drawing from his love for science-fiction, Schwartz intended to show the new Green Lantern in a more modern light, enlisting writer John Broome and artist Gil Kane, who in 1959 would reintroduce Green Lantern to the world in &quot;Showcase&quot; #22 (October 1959) by creating Hal Jordan.

The character was a success, and it was quickly decided to follow up his three-issue run on &quot;Showcase&quot; with a self-titled series. &quot;Green Lantern&quot; #1 began in July–August 1960 and would continue until #89 in April–May 1972.

Starting in issue #17, Gardner Fox joined the book to share writing duties with John Broome. The quartet of Schwartz, Broome, Fox, and Kane remained the core creative team until 1970.

===O&#x27;Neil/Adams and socially-conscious Green Lantern/Green Arrow===
Starting with issue #76 (April 1970), Dennis O&#x27;Neil took over scripting and Neal Adams, who had drawn the cover of issue #63, became the series&#x27; artist. O&#x27;Neil and Adams had already begun preparation for the classic run in the form of their re-workings of another DC superhero, the archer Green Arrow.

 In an introduction to the 1983 reprinting of this O&#x27;Neil/Adams run, O&#x27;Neil explains that he wondered if he could represent his own political beliefs in comics and take on social issues of the late sixties and early seventies. O&#x27;Neil devised the idea of portraying Hal Jordan, effectively an intergalactic law enforcement officer, as an establishment gradualist liberal figure against Oliver Queen (Green Arrow), who O&#x27;Neil had characterized as a lusty outspoken anarchist who would stand in for the counter-culture movement. The first of these socially motivated Green Lantern/Green Arrow stories was written with Gil Kane slated to be the artist, but Kane dropped out and was replaced by Neal Adams. The stories tackled questions of power, racism, sexism, and exploitation, and remain viewed in the comics community as the first socially-conscious superhero stories.

Despite the work of Adams and O&#x27;Neil, &quot;Green Lantern&quot; sales had been in a major decline at the time Green Arrow was brought on as co-star, and their stories failed to revive the sales figures. &quot;Green Lantern&quot; was canceled with issue #89 (April/May 1972), and the climactic story arc of the Green Lantern/Green Arrow series was published as a back-up feature in &quot;The Flash&quot; #217 through #219. In sharp contrast to the socially relevant tales which preceded it, this story centered on emotional themes, with Green Arrow struggling to deal with the guilt of having killed a man. Green Lantern continued to appear in backup stories of &quot;Flash&quot; from 1972 until the &quot;Green Lantern&quot; title was resumed in 1976.

===1980s exile===
In &quot;Green Lantern&quot; #151 (April 1982) through #172 (January 1984), Jordan is exiled into space for a year by the Guardians to prove his loyalty to the Green Lantern Corps, having been accused of paying too much attention to Earth when he had an entire &quot;sector&quot; of the cosmos to patrol. When he returns to Earth, he finds himself embroiled in a dispute with Carol Ferris. Faced with a choice between love and the power ring, Jordan resigns from the Corps. The Guardians call Jordan&#x27;s backup, John Stewart, to regular duty as his replacement.

In 1985, the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; storyline that rebooted much of DC Comics&#x27; character continuity saw Jordan again take up the mantle of Green Lantern. The new Corps, with seven members residing on Earth, included several aliens, John Stewart, and Guy Gardner. Jordan becomes romantically involved with an alien Lantern named Arisia Rrab, for which he comes under fire due to Arisia being only a teenager. The alien Lanterns take a more direct hand in human affairs, a fact not appreciated by human governments. Eventually, the Earth corps break up, several members returning to their home sectors. The Guardians soon return to this dimension, and Jordan works with them to rebuild the fractured Corps.

===1990s===
During this time, the character&#x27;s origin story is re-told and expanded in two limited series by Keith Giffen, Gerard Jones, and James Owsley, &quot;Emerald Dawn&quot; and &quot;Emerald Dawn II&quot;. The first series expanded the role of the Corps in his origin and also provided more details about his childhood and his relationship with his father and brothers, while the sequel detailed the role of Jordan in the downfall of Sinestro.

In the 1992 prestige format graphic novel &quot;Green Lantern: Ganthet&#x27;s Tale&quot;, Hal Jordan first encounters Ganthet, one of the Guardians of the Universe. Ganthet asks Hal to help him battle a renegade Guardian who has attempted to use a time machine to change history.

==== Reign of the Supermen, Destruction of Coast City, and transformation into Parallax ====
In the 1993 &quot;Reign of the Supermen!&quot; storyline, the alien tyrant Mongul and his forces destroy Coast City (Jordan&#x27;s former home), murdering all of its seven million inhabitants, while Jordan was off world. Angered, he flies to Engine City and attacks Mongul, eventually knocking him out with Steel&#x27;s hammer. This leads into the &quot;Emerald Twilight&quot; arc, which sees Jordan using his power ring to recreate Coast City as an instrument in the process of overcoming his grief, and talking to ring-created versions of his old girlfriend and parents. After his ring&#x27;s power expires, a projection of a Guardian appears and admonishes him for using the ring for personal gain and summons him to Oa (the homeworld of the Guardians and the Green Lantern Corps) for disciplinary action. Angered at what he sees as the Guardians&#x27; ungrateful and callous behavior, Jordan absorbs the energy from the Guardian&#x27;s projection, goes insane and attacks Oa to seize the full power of the Central Power Battery (the source of power for all Green Lanterns), defeating and severely injuring several members of the Green Lantern Corps in the process, taking their power rings as his own and leaving them to die in space. He arrives on Oa and kills Kilowog and Sinestro, and the Guardians commit suicide to pool all their life force in Ganthet. He then renounces his life as Green Lantern, adopting the name Parallax after absorbing the Power Battery&#x27;s vast powers.

Ganthet designates Kyle Rayner to replace Jordan as the Green Lantern of Earth when Rayner comes into possession of the last power ring, created from the shattered remains of Jordan&#x27;s. Guy Gardner has visions of the Green Lantern Corps&#x27; destruction and his yellow power ring&#x27;s energy (being powered by residual Green Lantern&#x27;s energy) starts to fluctuate. Soon after, Gardner goes to Oa to investigate, bringing Martian Manhunter, Darkstar (Ferrin Colos), The Ray, Wonder Woman, Captain Atom, Alan Scott and Arisia Rrab with him. Jordan uses the element of surprise, attacks, and easily defeats them, leaving Guy in a coma. After the battle, Jordan sends them all back to Earth warning them to leave him alone in the future. Not long afterwards, Parallax attempts to rewrite history to his own liking with the help of Extant in the universe-wide event &quot;Zero Hour: Crisis in Time&quot;. Parallax destroys the Time Trapper and attempts to remake the universe into a perfect, peaceful place, causing time disruptions throughout the universe. Superman, Kyle Rayner and Metron call upon Earth&#x27;s heroes to stop the mysterious disturbances. Jordan and Extant are eventually defeated when Hal exhausts most of his power from both fighting and manipulating the time stream. Green Arrow then takes advantage of Jordan&#x27;s drained state and shoots an arrow into a weakened Jordan&#x27;s chest.

Jordan makes a brief and redemptory appearance as Parallax in the 1996 &quot;Final Night&quot; miniseries/crossover storyline, apparently sacrificing his life to combat a threat to the solar system.

==== Transformation into Spectre ====

In the 1999 mini-series &quot;Day of Judgment&quot;, Jordan becomes the newest incarnation of the Spectre, released from Purgatory after a fallen angel attempted to take that power. Soon after assuming this mantle, Jordan chooses to bend his mission from a spirit of vengeance to one of redemption, also making other appearances through some of DC Comics&#x27; other story lines, such as advising Superman during the &quot;Emperor Joker&quot; storyline (where the Joker steals the reality-warping power of Mister Mxyzptlk) and erases all public knowledge of Wally West&#x27;s identity as the Flash after his terrible first battle with Zoom, which led to his wife miscarrying their twins. He also appeared in a 4-part story arc in the series &quot;Legends of the DC Universe&quot; (issues #33–36). A new series based on this premise, titled &quot;The Spectre&quot; (vol. 4), ran for 27 issues from 2001 to 2003. In it, Hal loses his beloved brother, Jack Jordan, to a supernatural assassin. After the series ended, Jordan was forced to return, temporarily, to the Spectre&#x27;s mission of vengeance, following a confrontation between the new Justice Society of America and the Spirit King, an old foe of the Spectre and Mister Terrific, who had managed to &quot;resurrect&quot; the ghosts of all those the Spectre had damned to Hell when Jordan&#x27;s attempt to turn the Spectre&#x27;s mission to redemption weakened his hold on the damned, until Hal &#x27;accepted&#x27; his original mission of vengeance.

During the &quot;Identity Crisis&quot; storyline, Green Arrow visits Jordan at his grave, asking to exact revenge on Sue Dibny&#x27;s killer. Although Hal admits knowing the culprit&#x27;s identity (revealed later was Jean Loring), he refused as the Spectre to a higher purpose, and implying to Oliver that the killer would eventually be caught, thus explaining the Spectre&#x27;s inaction.

===2000s===
In 2004, DC launched the &quot;Green Lantern: Rebirth&quot; miniseries which brought Hal Jordan back to life and made him a Green Lantern once again, and in a redesigned Corps uniform. Shortly after the conclusion of &quot;Rebirth&quot;, DC Comics began a new &quot;Green Lantern&quot; (vol. 4) series, beginning with a new #1 and retconning his past murders as Parallax as the result of an intergalactic fear-driven parasite. The Green Lantern Corps has also been successfully rebuilt. Despite the revelation that Hal&#x27;s past villainous activity was because of the influence of the parasite Parallax, many of his fellow Corps officers are unwilling to trust him, even Jordan, on some levels, believes the reason that Parallax succeeded in possessing him was because he surrendered to it, and thus acknowledges that he truly has a dark side. Despite being freed from Parallax, his experience also leads him occasionally to have a lack of confidence and self-doubt, making him no longer a daredevil he once was. Jordan also becomes friends with Kyle Rayner after their first battle with Parallax. In the new volume, Jordan moves to the nearly deserted Coast City, which is slowly being rebuilt. Reinstated as a pilot in the United States Air Force, Jordan now works in the test pilot program at Edwards Air Force Base. The series introduces new supporting characters for Hal, including a man from his and his late-father&#x27;s pasts, Air Force General Jonathan &quot;Herc&quot; Stone, who learns his secret identity during a battle with the Manhunters and acts as his ally. He also begins to develop a romantic attraction with his fellow pilot, the beautiful Captain Jillian &quot;Cowgirl&quot; Pearlman. Returning characters also include Carol Ferris, Tom Kalmaku, and Jordan&#x27;s younger brother James Jordan with his sister-in-law Susan and their children, Howard and Jane.

In this new title, he faces revamped versions of his Silver Age foes such as Hector Hammond, The Shark and Black Hand. A new account of Green Lantern&#x27;s origins is also released as part of this series. In this new origin, Hal Jordan is working as an assistant mechanic under Tom Kalmaku, barred from flying due to his insubordination while in the USAF and his employer&#x27;s lingering guilt about his father&#x27;s death in the line of duty. Green Lantern Abin Sur, while fighting the villain Atrocitus, crashes near Coast City. Knowing he is close to death, Sur sends his ring to seek a replacement (as all rings do when their wearer dies), and his ring fetches Jordan. Sur then informs Jordan that he is to replace him as the Green Lantern of Sector 2814.

==== &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; ====
As part of DC&#x27;s 2006 event Infinite Crisis, Hal helps briefly with the attack of the OMACs and Brother Eye. He also fights alongside a group of heroes against the Society of Supervillains, defending Metropolis. Guy Gardner leads the Green Lantern Corps attack against Superboy-Prime with Hal appearing in the group.

As part of DC&#x27;s post-Infinite Crisis retconning of the entire universe, all current stories skipped ahead one year in an event called One Year Later. This brought drastic changes to Hal Jordan&#x27;s life, as with every other hero in the DC Universe. It is revealed that Jordan spent time as a P.O.W. in an unnamed conflict and has feelings of guilt from his inability to free himself and his fellow captives.

==== &quot;Sinestro Corps War&quot; and other Pre-Flashpoint stories ====
Hal and the rest of the Green Lantern Corps find themselves at war with Sinestro and his army, the Sinestro Corps during the events of the Sinestro Corps War As a Green Lantern native to Earth, Hal is featured in the Final Crisis mini-series by Grant Morrison.

In the Agent Orange story arc, Jordan is briefly in command of Agent Orange&#x27;s power battery after he steals it from Agent Orange in a battle. The orange light of avarice converses with Jordan, his costume changes, and he becomes the new Agent Orange. However, Larfleeze quickly takes his power battery back from Jordan.

Jordan is also a character of focus in the new &quot;Justice League of America&quot; series as a charter member of the revamped JLA. He is also involved in the first plotline of the &quot;Brave and the Bold&quot; monthly series, teaming up first with Batman and later Supergirl. When teamed with the fledgling Supergirl, Hal is very impressed with her cleverness, although he finds her flirtatious behavior somewhat unnerving.

In the &quot;Justice League: Cry for Justice&quot; mini-series, Hal leads his own &quot;Justice League&quot; with Green Arrow, Shazam, Supergirl, Congorilla, Starman, Batwoman, and the Atom to avenge the deaths of Martian Manhunter and Batman. Jordan eventually recruits some of the former Titans members for the League&#x27;s new lineup, including Batman&#x27;s successor Dick Grayson, Donna Troy, and Starfire.

===2010s===
During the &quot;Blackest Night&quot; event, Hal allies himself with six other Lantern Corps during The War of Light. He finds himself facing many of his deceased allies, enemies, and people he failed to save reanimated as undead Black Lanterns under the control of the Green Lantern Corps&#x27; ancient enemy Nekron. Hal finds himself not only teaming up with Barry Allen (otherwise known as The Flash), who is also resurrected from his death, but also must work with his enemies Sinestro, Atrocitus, Larfleeze, and his former lover Carol Ferris.

====The New 52====
In 2011, after the universe-altering event Flashpoint, DC Comics relaunched its entire line of stories. In this era, Jordan returns to civilian life on Earth, having been discharged from the United States Air Force. This iteration of the hero, written by Geoff Johns and Robert Venditti, sees him team up with the villain Sinestro as the pair encounter ramifications of the Brightest Day/Blackest Night storylines, as well as a crossover with &quot;New Gods&quot; characters in &quot;Green Lantern: Godhead.&quot;

Hal Jordan is featured as a part of Justice League series relaunch as well. The initial issues of the title take place five years prior as Jordan assists Batman against a mysterious threat. It is shown he is already friends with Barry Allen and each know the other&#x27;s secret identity. Hal also believes with the ring he can overcome anything by himself by sheer force of will. This leads to reckless behavior that almost gets him killed. It is only when Batman reminds him of his mortality by revealing his own identity as Bruce Wayne that Hal reconsiders his approach. Five years after the team forms, Green Lantern resigns from the Justice League in an effort to keep the group functioning after his behavior put the team in peril during their fight with David Graves. Subsequently, he returns to the Justice League to help Jessica Cruz learn how to control her powers.

In the aftermath, Hal gets a new look as he goes rogue from the Green Lantern Corps to create a scapegoat for the Corps and be the focus of the universe&#x27;s blame and distrust for everything that had taken place in recent issues, such as the Third Army&#x27;s assault or Relic&#x27;s attack. The Corps itself – unaware of Jordan&#x27;s intentions to show the universe that the Green Lanterns are not corrupt and will go after one of their own – believes that he has actually betrayed them when he attacks Kilowog. Along the way, Jordan steals a Green Lantern prototype gauntlet and power pack from the armoury, allowing him to continue to operate as a hero without the need for a power ring, although he is sometimes required to fight other Lanterns to maintain the illusion of independence.

====DC Rebirth====
In 2016, DC Comics implemented another relaunch of its books called &quot;DC Rebirth&quot;, which restored its continuity to a form much as it was prior to &quot;The New 52&quot;. Jordan returns to Earth temporarily to assign Simon Baz and Jessica Cruz the task of protecting Earth while he and the rest of the human Green Lanterns are away. He takes their power batteries and fuses them into a single battery to help the two bond as Lantern partners.

Subsequently, in &quot;DC Rebirth&quot;, Hal returns as Green Lantern again, now equipped with his self-constructed power ring, searching for the rest of the Green Lanterns and hunting down the Sinestro Corps. Hal takes on several Yellow Lanterns before fighting Sinestro and getting injured. He is healed by Soranik, Sinestro&#x27;s daughter who now is a Yellow Lantern like her father. After being healed, he takes on and defeats Sinestro and saves Guy Gardner, who was being tortured by Sinestro. Hal is now reunited with the Green Lanterns who have entered a war with the Sinestro Corps. The battle leads them to the planet of Green Lantern Tomar-Tu. As they fight, Braniac shrinks the planet with the Lanterns in it. The shrunken planet is given to the Grand Collector which turns out to be Larfleeze, the Orange Lantern. Hal is believed to be dead in the destruction that came with the shrinking of the planet. He has been transported to the Emerald Space, an afterlife for deceased Lanterns. Guardians, Ganthet and Sayd call upon White Lantern Kyle Rayner to rescue Hal. Kyle pulls him out of the Emerald Space and the two meet up with the rest and escape from the shrunken planet and restore it. Larfleeze escapes with his orange construct Lanterns. The Green and Yellow Lanterns form an alliance.

Jordan appears with the Justice League in the &quot;Dark Nights: Metal&quot; mini-series.

==== The Green Lantern ====
With writer Grant Morrison taking the helm, Jordan returns to interstellar duty and infiltrates Controller Mu&#x27;s Blackstars to discover the mole within them. He later becomes a full member of the Blackstars and reassumes the Parallax mantle before seemingly sacrificing himself to stop Mu&#x27;s U-Bomb. However, he is rescued by his ring and meets its artificial intelligence, Pengowirr.

Hal reunites with Green Arrow and goes on an adventure busting up an assassin from a cosmic cartel of Hadea Maxima, while dealing with a drug dealer from Dimension Zero, Glorigold DeGrande. Teaming up with Xeen Arrow and Xeen Lantern, the heroes save the day by shooting a giant cosmic arrow at the assassin Azmomza on Earth&#x27;s moon. Hal then takes off for R&amp;R on Athmoora, the fantasy world of 2814 and faces the evil wizard Ah-Bah-Nazzur, who turns out to be a mind-controlled alternate universe variant of Abin Sur. Teaming up with him and The Guardians Of The Multiverse, a team of multiversal Green Lanterns, a cosmic interpol, Hal faces off against The Anti-Man/The Qwa-Man, The Mad Lantern, who is his Anti-Matter counterpart, set loose by Controller Mu and The Blackstars. From there on, he reunites with Uugo, The Conscious Planet, Strong-Woman Of Thronn and joins this team on a rescue operation for The Star Sapphire of Earth-11 on the forbidden universe of Earth-15. Becoming part of The Cosmic Grail Quest, Jordan finds himself in grave danger facing a mysterious Lantern figure.

=== 2020s ===

==== Infinite Frontier ====
During Dark Crisis, Hal Jordan returns to Earth and is shocked to see Earth in chaos due to the &quot;death&quot; of the Justice League. He encounters a grown up Jonathan Samuel Kent, as well as Wally West. He learns from Black Adam that Pariah has teamed up with The Great Darkness and corrupted multiple cosmic villains to take down the Justice League and Justice League Incarnate. Hal Jordan tells Wally West to go find Barry Allen while he goes find where Pariah is. Hal Jordan meets up with the rest of the Green Lantern Corps, rescues Kyle Rayner from his prison, and formally introduces Kyle to Simon Baz, Sojourner Mullein, Jessica Cruz and Simon Baz. Hal Jordan, Sojourner, and Kyle go confront Pariah, where Hal Jordan realizes that Pariah has trapped the Justice League into fantasy worlds where it will turn into weapons.

Hal Jordan is trapped in a world where he is attacked by a samurai Lantern version of Kyle Rayner, but is saved by Barry Allen. They decide to travel to the Justice League prisons to free everyone. They all confront Pariah, but Pariah vanishes to destroy Earth-Prime. Hal Jordan and Barry Allen create a plan where he will use his power Ring to connect the rest of the Justice League back home while Barry Allen will use his connection of the Multiversal vibrations to navigate. They manage to arrive back home to confront a possessed Deathstroke and his army Black Adam uses his powers to empower the rest of the Justice League to defeat Deathstroke&#x27;s army, and Hal Jordan tells Barry he will stay on Earth for a while in order to be more grounded. They watch how the new heroes rebuild the Hall of Justice and are impressed by their bravery, and Hal Jordan goes out to hang with his Green Lantern Corps.

==== Dawn of DC ====
During Jeremy Adams&#x27; run on &quot;Green Lantern&quot;, Jordan quits the Green Lantern Corps after the Guardians of the Universe disappear and the United Planets take over the group.

==Powers and abilities==

As a Green Lantern, Hal Jordan is semi-invulnerable, capable of projecting hard-light constructions, flight, and utilizing various other abilities through his power ring which are only limited by his imagination and willpower. Jordan, as a Green Lantern, has exceptional willpower.

As Parallax, Hal was one of the most powerful beings in all of the DC Universe. In addition to his normal Green Lantern powers, he was able to manipulate and reconfigure time-space to his will, manipulate reality at a large scale, had vast superhuman strength which he demonstrated by being able to knock out Superman with one punch, a higher sense of awareness and enhanced durability. As Parallax, he was still able to be harmed nearly just as easily as a normal Green Lantern but seemed to be able to endure more physical punishment. While Hal Jordan was Parallax, he was never defeated by physical force; all of his defeats were of a changed mental state during or after the battle, which was usually the result of dealing with his own conscience, and he would just give up, leave the battle, and hide himself.

<text>The Palomar Planet-Crossing Asteroid Survey (PCAS) was an astronomical survey, initiated by American astronomers Eleanor Helin and Eugene Shoemaker at the U.S Palomar Observatory, California, in 1973. The program is responsible for the discovery of 95 near-Earth Objects including 17 comets, while the Minor Planet Center directly credits PCAS with the discovery of 20 numbered minor planets during 1993–1994. PCAS ran for nearly 25 years until June 1995. It had an international extension, INAS, and was the immediate predecessor of the outstandingly successful NEAT program.

== Notable discoveries ==

The first NEO discovered by PACS was (5496) 1973 NA, an Apollo asteroid with an exceptional orbital inclination of 68°, the most highly inclined minor planet known until 1999. In 1976, Eleanor Helin discovered 2062 Aten, the first of a new class of asteroids called the Aten asteroids with small orbits that are never far from Earth&#x27;s orbit. As a result, these objects have a particularly high probability of colliding with the Earth. In 1979, Helin discovered an Apollo-type asteroid, that they later identified with the comet 4015 Wilson–Harrington. It was the first confirmation that a comet can evolve into an asteroid after it has degassed.

<text>Hepatosplenomegaly (commonly abbreviated HSM) is the simultaneous enlargement of both the liver (hepatomegaly) and the spleen (splenomegaly). Hepatosplenomegaly can occur as the result of acute viral hepatitis, infectious mononucleosis, and histoplasmosis or it can be the sign of a serious and life-threatening lysosomal storage disease. Systemic venous hypertension can also increase the risk for developing hepatosplenomegaly, which may be seen in those patients with right-sided heart failure.

==Common causes==

==Rare disorders==
Are the following:
* Lipoproteinlipase deficiency
* Multiple sulfatase deficiency
* Osteopetrosis
* Adult-onset Still&#x27;s disease (AOSD)

<doc id="1018491" wikidata="Q7331667" url="?curid=1018491" title="Rick Reilly">
<text>Richard Paul Reilly (born February 3, 1958) is an American sportswriter. Long known for being the &quot;back page&quot; columnist for &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, Reilly moved to ESPN on June 1, 2008, where he was a featured columnist for ESPN.com and wrote the back page column for ESPN the Magazine. Reilly hosted ESPN&#x27;s &quot;Homecoming with Rick Reilly&quot;, an interview show, and he is a contributing essayist for ESPN &quot;SportsCenter&quot; and ABC Sports.

==Career==
Reilly began his career in 1979 as an undergraduate assistant with the &quot;Daily Camera&quot; in Boulder, Colorado. He left the &quot;Camera&quot; in 1981 to be a football writer on the sports staff of the &quot;Denver Post&quot;, then on to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; in 1983 before joining &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; in 1985. Reilly has become a recognized name in the sportswriting industry because of his human interest pieces; his column, “Life of Reilly” was featured on the back page of SI from 1997 until 2007. The &quot;Life of Reilly&quot; was the first signed opinion piece in SI&#x27;s history. By some accounts, during his prime he was considered the preeminent sportswriter in the United States. Reilly officially left SI during the week of November 29, 2007, after 23 years with the magazine to join ESPN.
At ESPN, his column “Life of Reilly” appeared in &quot;ESPN The Magazine&quot; (also on the last page) and on ESPN.com. On March 10, 2010, Reilly announced that he would no longer be writing his opinion column for the magazine, but was going to a regular essay on &quot;SportsCenter&quot;. Reilly delivered essays from live sporting events for SportsCenter and other ESPN telecasts, such as the U.S. Open, Wimbledon, and the British Open. He also hosted “Homecoming”, an interview program, on ESPN, which was taped in the hometowns of featured guests. The series launched in April 2009.

On March 12, 2014 he announced his retirement from sports writing, and his last column was published on ESPN.com on June 10, 2014. ESPN announced that he would continue working for them in a television-only capacity, including SportsCenter and Sunday NFL Countdown.

===Awards===
Reilly has been voted NSSA National Sportswriter of the Year eleven times. He is second only to the late Jim Murray of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; (14) in number of times winning that award. In 2009, he joined a roster of journalism notables as winner of the Damon Runyon Award for Outstanding Contributions to Journalism. His work has also been recognized by the prestigious New York Newspaper Guild&#x27;s Page One Award for Best Magazine Story.

===Film===
Reilly co-wrote the screenplay for &quot;Leatherheads&quot;, a film directed by George Clooney, starring Clooney, Renée Zellweger and John Krasinski and released in April 2008.

Reilly&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Missing Links&quot;, has been optioned for development as a feature film.

===Style===
&quot;Slate&quot;&#x27;s Josh Levin noted that Reilly had an affinity for discussing pro athletes and their accomplishments via tooth jokes. He is especially harsh on dental flossing. He described Tiger Woods&#x27;s 2002 victory at Augusta as suspenseful as flossing, riding Lance Armstrong&#x27;s team car about as boring as flossing sharks, would rather floss crocodiles than go skydiving, and stated John Elway&#x27;s perfect endorsement product would be Johnson &amp; Johnson dental floss.

===Editorial stances===
In 2002, after Sammy Sosa&#x27;s public assertion that if baseball initiated testing for performance-enhancing drugs, he &quot;wanted to be first in line&quot;, Reilly suggested that he submit to preemptive, voluntary testing. &quot;Why wait to see what the players&#x27; association will do?&quot; Reilly asked. &quot;Why not step up right now and be tested? Show everybody you&#x27;re clean.&quot; Sosa refused, angrily. Reilly described the incident in his column the following week.

Reilly has also been a frequent critic of former San Francisco Giants star Barry Bonds for his treatment of his teammates, his off-field behavior and his alleged steroid use.

Reilly had long defended cyclist Lance Armstrong against accusations of using illegal performance enhancements, in part because his own reporting turned up no evidence corroborating the allegations that had been made against Armstrong over the years. When Armstrong confessed in January 2013 after many years of denials, Reilly wrote a strongly critical piece about Armstrong, saying that he had spent 14 years &quot;polishing a legend that turned out to be plated in fool&#x27;s gold.&quot;

===Nothing But Nets===
In 2006, Reilly wrote a column in &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; about a program dedicated to providing anti-malaria nets to African children at a cost of $10 per net. His request for contributions elicited a response from thousands and led to the creation of the Nothing But Nets foundation in partnership with the United Nations Foundation.

===Bibliography===

<text>Kaopectate is an orally taken medication for the treatment of mild diarrhea. It is also sometimes used to treat indigestion, nausea, and stomach ulcers. The active ingredients have varied over time, and are different between the United States and Canada. The original active ingredients were kaolinite and pectin. In Canada and Switzerland, the active ingredient is now Attapulgite, while in the US, the active ingredient is now bismuth subsalicylate (the same as in Pepto-Bismol).

==Ingredients==
The active ingredient in Kaopectate has changed since its original creation. Originally, kaolinite was used as the adsorbent and pectin as the emollient. Attapulgite (a type of absorbent clay) replaced the kaolinite in the 1980s, but was banned by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in a ruling made in April 2003. As a consequence, since 2004, bismuth subsalicylate has been used as the active ingredient in U.S. marketed products. In Canada, McNeil Consumer Healthcare continues to market Kaopectate using attapulgite as the active ingredient. However, Kaopectate was recalled in July 2021 in Canada because it may contain arsenic and lead beyond acceptable limits.

As of 2020, the US rights to Kaopectate are owned by Arcadia Consumer Healthcare (formerly Kramer Laboratories).

==Other animals==

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not have a clear stance on the administration of Kaopectate products on animals such as dogs and cats suffering from diarrhea. However, the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association Journal news article noted in 2003 that the new salicylate formulation might be harmful to cats. Kaolin-pectate, the original compound, was approved by the OTA (Organic Trade Association) for use in animals being produced for food.

==In popular culture==
* Kaopectate is referenced in the Sugarhill Gang song &quot;Rappers Delight&quot;.
* It is used and mentioned several times by the protagonist in the novel &quot;11/22/63&quot; by Stephen King.
*It is mentioned in the song “Wicked Ways” by Eminem.
*It is used to describe the colour of the sky in the novel Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace.

<doc id="1018497" wikidata="Q464564" url="?curid=1018497" title="The Royal Guardsmen">
<text>The Royal Guardsmen are an American rock band best known for their 1966 hit singles &quot;Snoopy vs. the Red Baron&quot;, &quot;The Return of The Red Baron&quot;, &quot;Snoopy For President&quot;, and the Christmas follow-up &quot;Snoopy&#x27;s Christmas&quot;.

== History ==
Originally known as the Posmen, the Ocala, Florida-based sextet adopted their anglophile moniker during the British Invasion, led by The Beatles and other British artists. The group was originally composed of Bill Balough (bass), John Burdett (drums), Chris Nunley (vocals), Tom Richards (guitar), Billy Taylor (organ), and Barry Winslow (lead vocals/guitar). The band was managed by Leonard Stogel.

The Royal Guardsmen&#x27;s first single, &quot;Baby Let&#x27;s Wait&quot; did not chart nationally. The group&#x27;s second offering, &quot;Snoopy vs. the Red Baron&quot;, reached #2 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and spent one week at #1 in the Record World charts, remained in the bestsellers for 12 weeks, and was certified gold by the RIAA in February 1967.

Since the band did not ask &quot;Peanuts&quot; creator Charles M. Schulz for permission, the Canadian arm of Laurie Records refused to issue the single until the legal problems were ironed out: instead, the band recorded the thinly-disguised &quot;Squeaky vs. the Black Knight&quot;, which was released in Canada and became a hit on at least one Canadian station. Eventually, Schulz gave his okay, and &quot;Snoopy vs. the Red Baron&quot; was released in Canada.

Immediately the song became a hit, the band went on a national tour during Christmas school break, playing in New York, San Francisco, and other large cities and sharing billing with the Beach Boys, Jefferson Airplane, Paul Revere &amp; the Raiders, The Turtles, The Who, and The Monkees. That summer, they toured as the opening act for Tommy James &amp; the Shondells and Sam the Sham &amp; the Pharaohs.

Snoopy, the Red Baron, and aircraft became recurring themes in their music, though they did have the top 100 singles &quot;Any Wednesday&quot;, &quot;I Say Love&quot;, and (at #35) &quot;Baby Let&#x27;s Wait&quot;, a re-release of their first single. Still, some members felt typecast as the Snoopy band and the original group split up in 1970, although a band with some replacement players continued for another year. 

In 1976, the original members (except for organist Taylor) got back together and played club dates for another three years before disbanding again. Guitarist Richards died later that year at age 30 of a brain tumor. The band (including Taylor, with local guitarist Pat Waddell substituting for Richards) next reunited for a live show on October 2, 2004, at the 50th reunion of their high school marching band, after which the band played a few other shows in 2005. They performed together in 2010; their next live performance after that was 2018.

In December 2006, they released a new Snoopy song, &quot;Snoopy vs. Osama&quot;, and in 2011, the single &quot;Alive and Well&quot;.

In The Crossfire Band of Ocala, original members Chris Nunley and Bill Balough and replacement member Pat Waddell continued playing together at least into 2021.

<text>The International Near-Earth Asteroid Survey (INAS) was an astronomical survey, organized and co-ordinated by prolific American astronomer Eleanor Helin during the 1980s. It is considered to be the international extension of the Planet-Crossing Asteroid Survey (PCAS). While PCAS operated exclusively from the U.S. Palomar Observatory in California, INAS attempted to encourage and stimulate worldwide interest in asteroids, and to expand the sky coverage and the discovery and recovery of near-Earth objects around the world.

The IAU&#x27;s Minor Planet Center credits INAS with the discovery of 8 minor planets in 1986 (compared to 20 discoveries made by PCAS during 1993–1994). One of the discoveries was the 7-kilometer sized main-belt asteroid 4121 Carlin.

<doc id="1018512" wikidata="Q556912" url="?curid=1018512" title="Culture of Myanmar">
<text>The culture of Myanmar (Burma) ( ) has been heavily influenced by Buddhism. Owing to its history, Burmese culture has significant influence over neighboring countries such as Laos, Siam, Assam and Xishuangbanna regions in China. It has also been influenced in various ways by its neighbours.

Since the fall of the Konbaung dynasty to the British in the Third Anglo-Burmese War, British colonial rule and westernisation have altered various aspects of Myanmar culture. Today, Myanmar&#x27;s culture is characterized by the rich diversity of its ethnic groups, each contributing to a unique cultural identity, combined with its potent body of national characters that came into development over the millenniums of monarchical history.

==Fine and applied arts==
Historically, Myanmar art was based on Buddhist themes, mostly had patronage by the royalty. Through different eras, it evolved over different styles and uses. There are also several regional styles of Buddha images, each with certain distinctive characteristics. For example, the Mandalay style, which developed in the late 1800s, consists of an oval-shaped Buddha with realistic features, including naturally curved eyebrows, smaller but still prominent ears, and a draping robe. There are 10 traditional arts, called &quot;pan sè myo&quot; (), listed as follows:
# Blacksmith ( &quot;ba-bè&quot;)
# Woodcarving ( &quot;ba-bu&quot;)
# Goldsmith ( &quot;ba-dein&quot;)
# Stucco relief ( &quot;pandaw&quot;)
# Masonry ( &quot;pa-yan&quot;)
# Stone carving ( &quot;pantamaw&quot;)
# Turnery ( &quot;panbut&quot;)
# Painting ( &quot;bagyi&quot;)
# Lacquerware ( &quot;panyun&quot;)
# Bronze casting ( &quot;badin&quot;)
In addition to the traditional arts are silk weaving, pottery, tapestry making, gemstone engraving, and gold leaf making. Temple architecture is typically of brick and stucco, and pagodas are often covered with layers of gold leaf while monasteries tend to be built of wood (although monasteries in cities are more likely to be built of modern materials). A very common roofing style in Burmese architecture is called &quot;pyatthat&quot; (), which is a many tiered and spired roof.

== Literature ==

Burmese literature had been in existence over millennia, visibly since the Bagan period in 11th century AD. Buddhism, notably the Jataka Tales, has greatly influenced Burmese literature. Many historical works are nonfiction. Poetry features prominently, and there are several forms of poetry unique to Burmese literature. However, British colonization introduced many genres of fiction, which have become extremely popular today.

By 1976, only 411 titles were published annually, compared to 1882, when 445 titles were published. Various factors, especially the lengthened bureaucratic process to obtain printing permits, censorship, and increasing economic hardship of consumers because of the socialist economic schemes, contributed to the decline of Burmese literary output.

Popular novels have similar themes to Western novels, often involving adventure, espionage, detective work, and romance. Many writers also translate Western novels, especially those of Arthur Hailey and Harold Robbins. The flourishing translation sector is the result of the Burmese government, which did not sign the Universal Copyright Convention Agreement, which would have forced Burmese writers to pay royalties to the original writers.

Short stories, often published in magazines, also enjoy tremendous popularity. They often deal with everyday life and have political messages (such as subtle criticisms of the capitalist system), partly because, unlike novels, short stories are not censored by the Press Scrutiny Board. Poetry is also a popular genre today, as it was during the monarchical times. However, unlike novels and other works, which use literary Burmese, poetry uses vernacular rather than literary Burmese. This reform movement is led by left-leaning writers who believe laymen&#x27;s language (the vernacular and colloquial form of Burmese) should be used instead of formal Burmese in literature.

One of the greatest female writers of the Post-colonial period is Journal Kyaw Ma Ma Lay. Khin Myo Chit was another important writer who wrote, among her works, The 13-Carat Diamond (1955), which was translated into many languages. The journalist Ludu U Hla was the author of numerous volumes of ethnic minority folklore, novels about inmates in U Nu-era jails, and biographies of people working in different occupations. Prime Minister U Nu himself wrote several politically oriented plays and novels.

Other prolific writers of the post-colonial era include Thein Phae Myint (and his The Ocean Traveller and the Pearl Queen, considered a Burmese classic), Mya Than Tint (known for his translations of Western classics like War and Peace), Thawda Swe and Myat Htun. Distinguished women writers, who have also been an ever-present force in Burmese literary history, include Kyi Aye, Khin Hnin Yu, and San San Nweh. Burmese Historians: Ba Shin, Than Tun, Thant Myint-U, Htin Aung, Sao Saimong, Myoma Myint Kywe, and San C. Po were famous in Burma.

== Dance ==

Dance in Burma can be divided into court, drama(&quot;Anyeint&quot; and &quot;Zett&quot;), folk and nat dances, each having distinct characteristics. Like many arts in Burma, Burmese dance is infused with different dance traditions. Mandalay dance school would have different nuances from other dance schools such as that of Yangon. In addition to its own styles, (), is also popular in Myanmar, Yodaya is the named that was given by Burmese for Thailand. The dance is only dance with for entertaining the royal families at royal court, it retains unique qualities that distinguish it from other regional styles, including angular, fast-paced and energetic movements and emphasis on pose, not movement.

==Music==

Various types of Burmese music use an array of traditional musical instruments, assembled in an orchestra known as &quot;hsaing waing&quot; which the Burmese &quot;saing saya&quot; Kyaw Kyaw Naing has made more widely known in the West. Burmese traditional music is atypical in Southeast Asian music, as it is characterised by sudden shifts in rhythm and melody as well as change in texture and timbre. It employs different ways and occasions of playing music in Myanmar. Historically, the &quot;Hsaing-wine&quot; is played for the auspicious ceremonies and royal presence. &quot;Byaw&quot; is well familiar to the village environments. Different forms of music are accompanied by different kinds of instruments. An instrument unique to Burma is the &quot;saung-gauk&quot;, an arched harp that can be traced to pre-Hittite times.

Classical traditions of Burmese music are found in the &quot;Mahagita&quot;, an extensive collection of classical songs and are typically divided into indoor and outdoor ensembles. These songs tend to be about various legends in Pali and subsequently in Burmese intermingled with Pali, related to religion or the power and glory of monarchs, and then the natural beauty of the land, forests and the seasons, eventually feminine beauty, love, passion and longing, in addition to folk music sung in the paddy fields. Pop music, both adopted and homegrown, however, dominates the music of Burma today.

==Customs==
The &quot;traditional&quot; Burmese greeting is &quot;mingalaba&quot; (, from Pali and roughly translated as &#x27;auspiciousness to you&#x27;). This is, however, a comparatively recent form of greeting, first emerging during British rule in Burma during the 19th to 20th centuries, coined as a Burmese language equivalent to &#x27;hello&#x27; or &#x27;how are you.&#x27; More informal rhetorical greetings such as &quot;Have you eaten?&quot; ( &quot;Htamin sa pi bi la&quot;) and &quot;How are you?&quot; ( &quot;Nei kaung la&quot;) are still common. &quot;Hello&quot; is also a popular greeting nowadays, whereas it used to be confined to answering the phone.

===Clothing===

The typical garment of the Burmese is the &quot;lungi&quot; or , a long garment worn by both men and women. For business and formal occasions, Bamar men wear a &quot;Teik-pon&quot; shirt () over an English collar shirt (sometimes donning a headwear called &quot;gaung baung&quot;), while Bamar women wear a blouse buttoned at the front, called () or to the side, called (), and a shawl. In urban areas, skirts and pants are becoming more common, particularly among the young.

During the British colonial era, Burmese nationalists associated traditional clothing, in particular &quot;Yaw longyi&quot; (), a type of longyi from the Yaw region, and &quot;pinni taikpon&quot; (), a fawn-coloured collarless jacket, with anti-colonialism and nationalist sentiment, because of a clampdown in the 1920s over increasing dissent. Wearing &quot;traditional&quot; clothing was seen as a mode of passive resistance to the cultural infiltration among the Burmese. British rule nonetheless influenced hair fashion and clothing. Cropped short hair, called &quot;bo ke&quot; () replaced long hair as the norm among Burmese men.

Similarly, women began wearing hairstyles like &quot;amauk&quot; (), consisting of crested bangs curled at the top, with the traditional hair bun (). The female sarong (&quot;htamein&quot;) became shorter, no longer extending to the feet, but to the ankles, and the length of the sarong&#x27;s top decreased to reveal more waistline. This period also saw the introduction of a sheer muslin blouse for women, revealing a corset-like lace bodice called &quot;za bawli&quot; ().

===Speech===
The Burmese language is very age-oriented. The use of honorifics before personal names is the norm, and it is considered rude to call a person just by their name without the honorific unless they are known from childhood or youth or in the case of a younger underling. Young males are addressed as &quot;Maung&quot; or &quot;Ko&quot; (lit. brother), and older or senior men as &quot;U&quot; (lit. uncle). Likewise, young females are addressed as &quot;Ma&quot; (lit. sister), and older or senior women as &quot;Daw&quot; (lit. aunt), regardless of their marital status. &#x27;Aunty&#x27; or &#x27;Uncle&#x27; is commonly used as well today. The first and second person pronouns vary depending on whom one is speaking to and are age-dependent. Elders are spoken to in a more respectful manner and a special vocabulary exists for speaking to Buddhist monks.

===Manners===

Burmese society operates on &quot;ana&quot; (), a characteristic or feeling that has no English equivalent. It is characterised by a hesitation, reluctance or avoidance, to perform an action based on the fear that it will offend someone or cause someone to lose face, or become embarrassed. Also, there is the concept of &quot;hpon&quot; (; from Sanskrit &quot;bhaga&quot;), which translates to &quot;power&quot;. It is used as an explanation for the varying degrees of ethnic, socioeconomic, and gender differences between people in a society. &quot;Hpon&quot; refers to the cumulative result of past deeds, an idea that power or social position comes from merit earned in previous lives. This idea is used to justify the prevalent view that women are lesser than men, who are considered to have more &quot;hpon&quot;.

Age is still considered synonymous with experience and wisdom, hence venerated. Parents and teachers are second only to the Three Jewels ( &quot;yadana thoun ba&quot;), together making up the Five Boundless Beneficence ( &quot;ananda nga ba&quot;), and are paid obeisance (called gadaw) at special times of the year such as &quot;Thingyan&quot;, beginning and end of Buddhist Lent, and usually parents before one leaves on a journey. Elders are served first at meals, and in their absence a spoonful of rice is put aside first in the pot as a token of respect ( &quot;u cha&quot;) before serving the meal. Young people would avoid sitting on a higher level than the elders or passing in front of them unless unavoidable, and then only treading softly with a slight bow. Things would be passed to the elders using both hands together. Men may cross their legs sitting on a chair or a mat but women generally would not.

Children are taught from young &#x27;to venerate one&#x27;s elders, to respect one&#x27;s peers, and to be kind to the young and weak&#x27; ( ). Parents are believed to be solely responsible for their children&#x27;s behaviour as reflected by the expressions: ( undisciplined either by mother or by father) and &quot;ami youk tau hnoukkyan, ahpa youk tau ko amu-aya kyan&quot; (bad language from bad mother, bad body-language from bad father). Saying &quot;thank you&quot; however is not Burmese custom between friends and within the family.

It is considered rude to touch a person&#x27;s head, because it is the &quot;highest&quot; point of the body. It is also considered taboo to touch another&#x27;s feet, but worse still to point with the foot or sit with feet pointing at someone older, because the feet are considered the lowest. Also, pointing a finger at Buddha images is considered blasphemous, although this custom has slowly eroded. Shoes are always taken off upon entering homes, monasteries and pagoda compounds. A custom of the Burmese is to perambulate clockwise ( &quot;let ya yit&quot;) around a pagoda, not counterclockwise ( &quot;let wè yit&quot;).

Physical demonstrations of affection in public are common between friends of the same gender or between members of the family, but seldom seen between lovers. It is thus common to see friends walking together holding hands or with arms round each other, but couples rarely do so, except in major cities.

=== Footwear ===
In Myanmar, footwear is customarily removed before entering a home and Buddhist places of worship. Many workplaces in Myanmar also have shoe-free areas, or restrict footwear altogether, with shoes typically left at the corridor or at the entrance of an office.

These customs are strictly enforced in Buddhist places of worship, including Burmese pagodas and in Buddhist monasteries called &quot;kyaung&quot;. The Burmese remove their footwear at such sites as a sign of religious respect.

Strict enforcement of this custom, however, is partly a legacy of British rule in Burma, during which Europeans refused and were exempted from removing their footwear when entering Buddhist places of worship. In pre-colonial Burma, non-royals removed their footwear before entering palace grounds, as a token of respect for the reigning monarch. In the final years of the Konbaung dynasty, diplomatic relations between the British and Burmese soured when the British Resident, a colonial representative, refused to remove his shoes upon entering the raised platform of the Mandalay Palace, a decision that prevented him from meeting King Thibaw Min. Consequently, the British withdrew the Resident and his delegation in October 1879, with his exit portending the Third Anglo-Burmese War, after which the remaining half of the Burmese kingdom (Upper Burma) was fully annexed into British India.

This &quot;shoe question&quot; became a rallying cry for Burmese nationalists, comparable to the cow protection movement in neighboring British India. In 1916, the nationalist Young Men&#x27;s Buddhist Association (YMBA) began campaigning against foreigners wearing shoes in pagoda grounds, with Buddhist monks at the forefront of the campaign. The Ledi Sayadaw, a prominent Buddhist monk, penned &quot;On the Impropriety of Wearing Shoes on Pagoda Platforms&quot;, which drew in widespread support for the YMBA&#x27;s activism.

In 1919, after a two-year battle, Cambridge-educated barrister, Thein Maung, a YMBA member, successfully persuaded the colonial government to issue an order prohibiting footwear on the grounds of religious sites. Thein Maung&#x27;s undertaking was in direct response to the actions of Archibald Cochrane, future Governor of Burma, who had kept his shoes on while touring Shwemawdaw Pagoda in Pegu (now Bago) in 1917, much to the indignation of locals.

In recent years, foreigners have been successfully prosecuted and punished for refusing to remove their footwear at Burmese religious sites. In August 2017, a Russian tourist was arrested and sentenced to seven months of jail time and hard labor for repeatedly refusing to remove her shoes upon entering pagoda grounds throughout Bagan, as she had violated local customs, per Section 13(1) of the Immigration Act. Burmese authorities subsequently announced a crackdown tourists wearing shoes inside Bagan&#x27;s pagodas.

==Cuisine==

Burmese cuisine has been influenced by Indian, Chinese and Thai cuisines as well as domestic ethnic cuisines. It is not widely known throughout the world and can be characterised as having a mildly spicy taste, with a limited use of spices. A typical Burmese meal consists of several Burmese curries, a soup, steamed rice and fermented sauce of preserved fish, along with vegetables for dipping. Condiments like balachaung, Indian-style pickles and pickled vegetables are commonly served alongside the dishes. Although fish sauce and shrimp paste are commonly used ingredients, as in other Southeast Asian cuisines, Burmese cuisine also makes extensive use of chickpeas, lentils and tamarind, which is used to add a sour flavour rather than the lime juice or vinegar used in other cuisines.

Ethnic cuisines, in particular Shan cuisine, are also prominently found throughout Burma, as are Indian and Chinese dishes, particularly in urban areas. The de facto national dish is mohinga (), rice noodles in a rich fish soup. Burmese salads (), especially laphet thoke, which is a salad of pickled tea leaves, are also popular dishes. The Burmese traditionally eat with their fingers, although the usage of Western utensils and chopsticks have become more widespread, especially in towns and cities. Indian breads like paratha and naan or rice noodles are also commonly eaten with dishes, in addition to rice.

==Weddings==

Weddings are considered one of the Twelve Auspicious Rites in Burmese culture. Traditional Burmese folklore considers love to be destiny, as the Hindu god Brahma writes one&#x27;s destiny in love on a child&#x27;s brow when he or she is six days old, called &quot;na hpuza&quot; (, lit. &quot;destiny on the forehead&quot;). A Burmese wedding can be religious or secular and extravagant or simple. Traditionally, a marriage is recognised with or without a ceremony when the man&#x27;s longyi (sarong) is seen hanging from a rail of the house or if the couple eats from the same plate. Dowries are typically unheard of, and arranged marriage is not a custom of the common Burmese.

Weddings are traditionally avoided during the Buddhist lent, which lasts three months from July to October.

Generally speaking, Buddhist monks are not present to conduct the wedding and solemnise the marriage, as they are forbidden to officiate a marriage, which is considered a worldly affair (). However, they may be invited to bless the newly wed couple and recite a protective &quot;paritta&quot;. Typically, the bride and groom arrange an almsgiving feast to monks the morning of the wedding to gain merit.

A more extravagant wedding requires months of preparation, including consultation with an astrologer in choosing the most auspicious time and setting of the event. Also, a master of ceremonies, typically a brahmin, is hired to preside over the ceremony. The bride and groom sit on cushions next to each other. At the beginning of the wedding, the Brahmin blows a conch shell to commence the ceremony and joins the palms of the couple, wraps them in white cloth, and dips the joined palms in a silver bowl. The Burmese word &quot;to marry&quot; is &quot;let htat&quot; (), which literally means &quot;to join palms together&quot;. After chanting a few Sanskrit mantras, the Brahmin takes the couple&#x27;s joined palms out of the bowl and blows the conch shell to end the ceremony. Afterward, entertainers perform, and the wedding is ended with a speech by a guest of higher social standing. Wedding receptions at a hotel, serving tea and ice cream, are common in urban areas.

==Funerals==

Burmese funerals typically last a week, with the body traditionally buried or cremated on the third day. Burial is common, but cremation, more common in the cities, is also practised by orthodox Buddhists and monks in Burma. A coin, called &quot;kudoga&quot; () is placed in the mouth of the deceased person, to pay a &quot;ferry toll&quot; for crossing death. Before the actual interment of the body, an offering of turmeric-coated rice is given to appease the &quot;bhummazo&quot; (), the guardian deity of the earth. During the actual funeral, gifts in the form of paper fans containing the deceased person&#x27;s name, as well as Buddhist scriptures relating to the impermanence of life (anicca) and samsara are distributed to all attendees.

In urban areas, flower wreaths and florals are typically given at a funeral, as well as money, for less well-to-do families. However, in villages, more practical gifts such as food items are given to the grieving family. For seven days, the windows and doors of the house in which the person died may be left open, to let the deceased person&#x27;s consciousness or &quot;spirit&quot;, called (, ) leave the home, and a vigil may be kept at nighttime. On the seventh day, called (), a meal is offered to monks, who in turn recite blessings, protective parittas and transfer merit to the deceased, concluded with a Buddhist water libation ceremony.

==Religion==


Myanmar is a predominantly Theravada Buddhist country. Buddhism reached Burma around the beginning of the Christian era, mingling with indigenous form of Hinduism. The Pyu and Mon kingdoms of the first millennium were Hindu-Buddhist. According to traditional history, King Anawrahta of Bagan adopted Buddhism in 1056 and went to war with the Mon kingdom of Thaton in the south of the country to obtain the Buddhist Canon and learned monks. The religious tradition created at this time, and which continues to the present day, is a syncretic mix of what might be termed &#x27;pure&#x27; Buddhism (of the Theravada school) with deep-rooted elements of the original Hindu-animist culture or nat worship and even strands of Hinduism and the Mahayana tradition of northern India.

Islam reached Burma at approximately the same time, but never gained a foothold outside the geographically isolated seaboard running from modern-day Bangladesh southward to Irrawaddy Delta (modern Rakhine State, formerly Arakan, an independent kingdom until the eighteenth century). The colonial period saw a huge influx of Muslim Indians into Yangon and other cities, and the majority of Yangon&#x27;s many mosques owe their origins to these immigrants.

Christianity was brought to Burma by European missionaries in the 1800s. It made little headway among Buddhists, but has been widely adopted by non-Buddhists such as the Chin, Karen, and Kachin. The Roman Catholic Church, Myanmar Baptist Convention and the Assemblies of God of Burma are the largest Christian denominations in Burma. Burma is home to the second largest population of Baptists in the world, after the United States, the result of American missionary work.

The Chinese contribution to Burma&#x27;s religious mix has been slight, but several traditional Chinese temples were established in Yangon and other large cities in the nineteenth century when large-scale Chinese migration was encouraged by the British. Since approximately 1990 this migration has resumed in huge numbers, but the modern Chinese immigrants seem to have little interest in religion. Some more isolated indigenous peoples in the more inaccessible parts of the country still follow traditional animism.

Burma has nominal guarantees of freedom of religious expression, although religious minorities (Christians and Muslims), particularly those in the countryside are subject to discrimination. Sporadic riots between Burmese Buddhists and Burmese Muslims are not uncommon, and tensions between the two religious groups are high, particularly in major cities. In 2001, after the Taliban&#x27;s destruction of the Buddhas of Bamiyan in Afghanistan, religiously motivated riots broke out between Buddhists and Muslims across major cities in Burma, including Sittwe, Pyay, Taungoo and Bago. The current regime&#x27;s nationalistic policy of &quot;Bama san-gyin,&quot; which considers Buddhism a key element of Burmese-ness, does provide a systemic bias in favour of Buddhists in terms of preferment in the armed forces and other State structures.

=== Pagodas and monasteries ===

Aspects of Burmese culture are most apparent at religious sites. The country has been called the &quot;Land of Pagodas&quot; as the landscape is dominated by Buddhist pagodas or stupas. The four most important Burmese Buddhist pilgrimage sites are Shwedagon Pagoda in Yangon, Mahamuni Buddha in Mandalay, Kyaiktiyo Pagoda in Mon State, and Bagan, an ancient capital by the Ayeyarwady River where thousands of stupas and temples have stood for nearly a millennium in various states of repair .

Pagodas are known by their Pali terms () or (), but are also commonly called () which is synonymous with &quot;Buddha&quot;. Monasteries are known as (), meaning monk, and since they have traditionally been places of learning where village children are taught how to read and write including and more importantly Pali, the language of the Buddhist scriptures, school also came to be called () in the Burmese language.

== Traditional festivals ==

There are twelve months in the traditional Burmese calendar and twelve corresponding festivals. Most of the festivals are related to Burmese Buddhism and in any town or village the local &quot;paya pwè&quot; (the pagoda festival) is the most important one.

The most well-known festival is Thingyan, a four-day celebration of the coming Lunar New Year. This festival is held prior to the Burmese New Year, the first day of Tagu which falls in mid-April. It is related and similar to other Southeast Asian New Year festivals (Songkran, Cambodian New Year, Sinhalese New Year and Lao New Year), people splash water on one another. However, Thingyan has religious significance, marking the days in which Buddhists are expected to observe the Eight Precepts of Buddhism.

==Sports==

===Football===
Football is the most popular sport in Myanmar. Similar to football, &quot;chinlone&quot; () is an indigenous sport that utilises a rattan ball and is played using mainly the feet and the knees, but the head and also the arms may be used except the hands.

===Lethwei===
&quot;Lethwei&quot; (; : ), or Burmese bareknuckle boxing, is the most popular combat sport in Myanmar. It is a Burmese full-contact martial art called &quot;thaing&quot;, divided into &quot;bando&quot; (unarmed combat) and &quot;banshay&quot; (armed combat).

===Regatta===
Of the twelve seasonal festivals, regattas are held in the month of &quot;Tawthalin&quot; (August/September). The term typically describes racing events of rowed or sailed water craft.

===Equestrian===
Equestrian events were held by the royal army in the time of the Burmese kings in the month of &quot;Pyatho&quot; (December/January).

===Cricket===
During British rule, the game of cricket was played by the ruling British, with the Burma national cricket team playing a number of first-class matches. The team exists today, although no longer of first-class quality and is an affiliate member of the International Cricket Council.

===Basketball===
Burma also has a basketball team, which qualified for the Asian Games in the past.

== Cinema and Photography ==
The cinema of Myanmar and former British Burma has a long history dating back to the 1910s. Burma&#x27;s first film was a recording of the funeral of Tun Shein - a leading politician of the 1910s, who campaigned for Burmese independence in London. During the 1920s and 1930s, many Burmese-owned film companies (such as A1, New Burma, British Burma, The Imperial, Bandula and Yan Gyi Aung) made and produced several films. Some of the famous directors of this era were Nyi Pu, Sunny, Tote Kyi, and Tin Pe. The first Burmese sound film was produced in 1932 in Bombay, India with the title &quot;Ngwe Pay Lo Ma Ya&quot; (Money Can&#x27;t Buy It) and directed by Tote Kyi. Films dealing with social issues and political themes became popular in the 1930s.

After World War II, Burmese cinema continued to address political themes. Many of the films produced in the early Cold War era had a strong propaganda element to them. The film &quot;Palè Myetyay&quot; (Tear of Pearl), produced in the wake of the Kuomintang invasion of Burma in the 1950s, highlighted the importance of the armed forces or Tatmadaw to the country. &quot;Ludu Aung Than&quot; (The People Win Through) featured anti-Communist propaganda. The script was written by U Nu who served as Prime Minister during the 1950s. The famous film maker and author Thukha started producing films during this period. His most famous film is &quot;Bawa Thanthaya&quot; (The Life Cycle). Burma held its first Academy Awards in 1952. Starting with the Socialist era in 1962, there was strict censorship and control of film scripts.

In the era that followed the political events of 1988, the film industry has been increasingly controlled by the government. After the 1989 move by the government to open up the economy, the movie industry was privatised. The film company Mingala became the most powerful company in the industry. Film stars who had been involved in the political activities of the 1980s and 1990s, such as Aung Lwin and Tun Wai, were banned from appearing in films.

In the 21st century, Myanmar cinema got visibility in international film festivals. In 2014, The Maw Naing&#x27;s &quot;The Monk&quot; was premiered at the 49th Karlovy Vary International Film Festival. Followed by the participation in main competitions as; Wera Aung&#x27;s short film &quot;The Robe&quot; at 21st Busan International Film Festival, Aung Phyoe&#x27;s &quot;Cobalt Blue&quot; at 72nd Locarno Film Festival. and Maung Sun&#x27;s &quot;Money Has Four Legs&quot; at 74th Locarno Film Festival. In 2019, some local media reported a revival in the local movie industry, stating that in 2016 there were 12 movies cleared by local censorship and waiting to be screened, 18 in 2017, more than 40 in 2018, and more than 60 in 2019. The success of &quot;Now and Ever&quot; (2019), starring Zenn Kyi, was also cited as evidence of the revival.

=== Photography ===
Documenting and promoting aspects of modern visual culture, the Myanmar Photo Archive (MPA) is both a physical archive of photographs taken between 1890 and 1995 in Myanmar and the country&#x27;s former period of British Burma. Further, MPA is an ongoing project for the public awareness of the country&#x27;s social history. Through various exhibitions, an online presentation and a publication programme, MPA has become known since 2013 for spreading Myanmar&#x27;s photographic heritage, both on a local and an international level. With a collection of more than 30.000 images and other related material, MPA has become the largest archive for Myanmar&#x27;s photographic history. MPA also has published books on the history of photography in Myanmar and former Burma and has been engaged in public events and artistic re-evaluation of the archive&#x27;s collections.

<text>&quot;Let the Thunder of Victory Rumble!&quot; was a &quot;de facto&quot; national anthem of the Russian Empire in the late 18th and early 19th century.

The lyrics were written by the premier Russian poet of the time, Gavrila Derzhavin, and the music by composer Józef Kozłowski, in 1791. The song was written to commemorate the capture of major Ottoman fortress Izmail by the great Russian general Aleksandr Suvorov. This event effectively ended the Seventh Russo-Turkish War.

The tune is a &quot;polonaise&quot;.

This anthem was eventually replaced by a formal imperial anthem, &quot;God Save the Tsar!&quot;, which was adopted in 1833.

<text>The Carina–Sagittarius Arm (also known as the Sagittarius Arm or Sagittarius–Carina Arm, labeled -I) is generally thought to be a minor spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy. Each spiral arm is a long, diffuse curving streamer of stars that radiates from the Galactic Center. These gigantic structures are often composed of billions of stars and thousands of gas clouds. The Carina–Sagittarius Arm is one of the most pronounced arms in our galaxy as many HII regions, young stars and giant molecular clouds are concentrated in it.

The Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy, consisting of a central crossbar and bulge from which two major and several minor spiral arms radiate outwards. This arm lies between two major spiral arms, the Scutum–Centaurus Arm, the near part of which is visible looking &quot;inward&quot;, i.e. toward the Galactic Center with the rest beyond the galactic central bulge, and the Perseus Arm, similar in size and shape but locally much closer looking outward, away from the bright, immediately obvious extent of the Milky Way in a perfect observational sky. It is named for its proximity to the Sagittarius and Carina constellations as seen in the night sky from Earth, in the direction of the Galactic Center.

The arm dissipates near its middle, shortly after reaching its maximal angle, viewed from the Solar System, from the Galactic Center of about 80°. Extending from the galaxy&#x27;s central bar is the Sagittarius Arm (Sagittarius bar). Beyond the dissipated zone it is the Carina Arm.

==Geometry==
A study was done with the measured parallaxes and motions of 10 regions in the Sagittarius arm where massive stars are formed. Data was gathered using the BeSSeL Survey with the VLBA, and the results were synthesized to discover the physical properties of these sections (called the Galactocentric azimuth, around −2 and 65 degrees). The results were that the spiral pitch angle of the arms is 7.3 ± 1.5 degrees, and the half-width of the arms of the Milky Way were found to be 0.2 kpc. The nearest part to the Sun is around 1.4 ± 0.2 kpc away.

==Minor arm==
In 2008, infrared observations with the Spitzer Space Telescope showed that the Carina–Sagittarius Arm has a relative paucity of young stars, in contrast with the Scutum-Centaurus Arm and Perseus Arm. This suggests that the Carina–Sagittarius Arm is a minor arm, along with the Norma Arm (Outer Arm). These two appear to be mostly concentrations of gas, sparsely sprinkled with pockets of newly formed stars.

<text>Strangler fig is the common name for a number of tropical and subtropical plant species in the genus &quot;Ficus&quot;, including those that are commonly known as banyans.

==Species==
Some of the more well-known species are:
* &quot;Ficus altissima&quot; – southern China and tropical Asia
* &quot;Ficus aurea&quot; – Florida, the Caribbean and Central America
* &quot;Ficus benghalensis&quot; – Indian subcontinent
* &quot;Ficus benjamina&quot; – tropical and subtropical Asia to northern Australia
* &quot;Ficus burtt-davyi&quot; – southeastern Africa
* &quot;Ficus citrifolia&quot; – Florida and tropical America
* &quot;Ficus craterostoma&quot; – tropical and southern Africa
* &quot;Ficus henneana&quot; – northern and eastern Australia
* &quot;Ficus macrophylla&quot; – eastern Australia and Lord Howe Island
* &quot;Ficus microcarpa&quot; - southeast Asia to Australia
* &quot;Ficus obliqua&quot; – Maluku Islands, Papuasia, northern Australia and southwestern Pacific
* &quot;Ficus tinctoria&quot; – Indian subcontinent and southern China to northern Australia and southwestern Pacific
* &quot;Ficus virens&quot; – tropical and subtropical Asia to northern Australia and western Pacific
* &quot;Ficus watkinsiana&quot; – eastern Australia

These all share a common &quot;strangling&quot; growth habit that is found in many tropical forest species. This growth habit is an adaptation for growing in dark forests where the competition for light is intense. These plants are hemiepiphytes, spending the first part of their life without rooting into the ground. Their seeds, often bird-dispersed, germinate in crevices atop other trees. These seedlings grow their roots downward and envelop the host tree while also growing upward to reach into the sunlight zone above the canopy.

An original support tree can sometimes die, so that the strangler fig becomes a &quot;columnar tree&quot; with a hollow central core. However, it is also believed that the strangler fig can help its support tree survive storms.

<text>A medina (from ) is a historical district in a number of North African cities, often corresponding to an old walled city. The term comes from the Arabic word simply meaning &quot;city&quot; or &quot;town&quot;.

== Historical background ==
Prior to the rise and intrusion of European colonial rule in North Africa, the region was home to many major cities which had long been centres of culture, commerce, and political power over many centuries.

In Algeria, the French conquest that began in 1830 and brought the country under colonial control resulted in significant destruction of the urban fabric of its historic cities. Colonial rule also led to the dismantling of many traditional urban institutions, the disruption of local culture, and even a certain level of depopulation over time. Fewer cities have preserved their pre-colonial urban fabric in Algeria by comparison with neighbouring countries, but significant remains have been preserved in historic cities such as Algiers, Tlemcen, Nedroma, and Constantine, as well as in many Saharan towns. In Algiers, most of the historic lower town was demolished and remodeled along European lines after the French conquest. The only part of the old city that remained relatively untouched was the upper town, which contained the citadel (&quot;qasaba&quot;) and the former residence of the rulers, and thus became known as the &quot;Casbah&quot; of Algiers. 

The fate of traditional walled cities in Tunisia and Morocco, which also came under French colonial rule over the next hundred years, was quite different. The French conquest of Tunisia took place in 1881 and resulted in the establishment of a French &quot;Protectorate&quot;, while nominally retaining the existing Tunisian monarchy. In Tunisia the French generally built new planned cities (the &quot;Villes Nouvelles&quot;) outside the established historic cities. These new planned towns were almost exclusively inhabited by European colonists while the indigenous population predominantly resided in the old districts, resulting in a certain level of racial segregation during the colonial period. Some French assimilationist policies, as witnessed in Algeria, were also implemented in Tunisia. In Tunis, the old city was preserved but it was physically linked with the European town, making it easier to police, while its traditional economic and administrative systems were marginalized, rendering it dependent on the European districts. The most important preserved historic towns or medinas today include those of Tunis, Kairouan, Mahdia, Sfax, and Sousse. 

In Morocco, the Treaty of Fes established another French Protectorate over that country in 1912. The first French resident general in Morocco, Hubert Lyautey, appointed Henri Prost to oversee the urban development of cities under his control. One important colonial policy with long-term consequences was the decision to largely forego development of existing historic cities and to deliberately preserve them as sites of historic heritage, the &quot;medinas&quot;. The French administration again built new planned cities outside the old walled cities, where European settlers largely resided with modern Western-style amenities. This was part of a larger &quot;policy of association&quot; adopted by Lyautey which favoured various forms of indirect colonial rule by preserving local institutions and elites, in contrast with other French colonial policies favouring assimilation. The desire to preserve historic cities was also consistent with one of the trends in European ideas about urban planning at the time which argued for the preservation of historic cities in Europe – ideas which Lyautey himself favored. Scholar Janet Abu-Lughod has argued that French urban policies and regulations created a kind of urban &quot;apartheid&quot; between the indigenous Moroccan urban areas – which were forced to remain stagnant in terms of urban development – and the new planned cities which were mainly inhabited by Europeans and expanded to occupy rural lands outside the city which were formerly used by Moroccans. This separation was partly softened by wealthy Moroccans who started moving into the &quot;Villes Nouvelles&quot; during the colonial period.

<doc id="1018550" wikidata="Q1824495" url="?curid=1018550" title="Lifeblood (album)">
<text>Lifeblood is the seventh studio album by Welsh alternative rock band Manic Street Preachers, released on 1 November 2004 by Sony Music UK. Two singles were released from the album: &quot;The Love of Richard Nixon&quot; and &quot;Empty Souls&quot;.

While the album was met with generally positive reviews from critics, it is the band&#x27;s least commercially successful album, peaking at number 13 in the UK Album Charts and has often been derided by the band members themselves.

An expanded and remastered edition was released in 2024 to mark its 20th anniversary.

== Writing and recording ==

The working title of &quot;Lifeblood&quot; was &quot;Litany&quot;, hinting that the song &quot;Litany&quot;, recorded during the &quot;Lifeblood&quot; sessions, was originally intended for inclusion. The track, however, ultimately only appeared as a B-side on the &quot;Empty Souls&quot; CD single.

Although the album includes songs about disgraced U.S. president Richard Nixon and British suffragette leader Emmeline Pankhurst (&quot;Emily&quot;), the band&#x27;s earlier political lyrics are largely replaced by personal reflection, such as on their own past (&quot;1985&quot;) and missing member Richey Edwards (&quot;Cardiff Afterlife&quot;). Lyricist Nicky Wire talked about the ghosts that haunted this record and stated that the record was a retrospective: &quot;The main themes are death and solitude and ghosts. Being haunted by history and being haunted by your own past. Sleep is beautiful for me. I hate dreaming because it ruins ten hours of bliss. I had a lot of bad dreams when Richey first disappeared. Not ugly dreams, but nagging things. Until we wrote &#x27;Design for Life&#x27;, it was six months of misery. &quot;Lifeblood&quot; doesn&#x27;t seek to exorcise Edwards&#x27; ghost, though, just admits that there are no answers&quot;.

Work on recording &quot;Lifeblood&quot; began in New York City with legendary producer Tony Visconti, but these sessions led to only three finished tracks: &quot;Solitude Sometimes Is&quot;, &quot;Emily&quot; and &quot;Cardiff Afterlife&quot;. The band then decided to continue with frequent collaborator Greg Haver and moved to Grouse Lodge Studio in County Westmeath, Ireland and then Stir Studios in Cardiff, Wales. Additional production and final mixing was completed by Tom Elmhirst.

The album is a departure musically, replacing the band&#x27;s traditional guitar walls of sound with more subtle and melodic playing, with more emphasis being given to keyboards and synthesizers. This resulted in the album being described as pop rock, synthpop, and synthrock . Nicky Wire described the album as &quot;elegiac pop&quot; throughout the recording process.

Singer and guitarist James Dean Bradfield recalled the writing and recording process in 2015: &quot;I felt like we were suffering from something called paralysis to analysis in the process of writing. Perhaps we&#x27;d run out of juice, and there was another version of the band that we needed to find [in] ourselves. So we had this MO before we went into the studio of not trusting our first idea or second idea, and we&#x27;d always chase the third idea. We&#x27;d write a song and discard our distinctive way of playing that song. Also we didn&#x27;t really play together on that record — there wasn&#x27;t much live playing. I would lay down a vocal and a guitar track, and Nick and Sean would come in and put down tracks separately. There is an element to that record where it feels slightly virtual and disconnected, and inorganic. It lacks our true instinct. It lacks the essence of what we are. I think we talked ourselves into a corner. It was an investigation that didn&#x27;t work.&quot;

Nicky Wire reflected on the album in 2021: &quot;&quot;Lifeblood&quot; is very much a withdrawal album. I was digging deeper holes, to just piss people off - without even trying. There&#x27;s certain bits of it we do love. But as a man who grew up with the Guinness Book of Hit Records, the fact that the album went in at Number 13 just crushed me: &#x27;Not even in the Top 10?! How has this happened?

== Release ==

&quot;Lifeblood&quot; was preceded by the single &quot;The Love of Richard Nixon&quot;, released on 18 October 2004. During the mid-week chart the single was at the No. 1 position, but dropped and ended up peaking at No. 2 on the UK singles chart.

&quot;Lifeblood&quot; was released on 1 November 2004. It entered the UK Albums Chart at No. 13, selling 23,990 in the first week and spending only 4 weeks in the Top 100 in total (3 of them in the Top 75 including a re-entry at No. 27 in 2024). The album went Silver, but was the least commercially successful album by the band. By 2011 it had only sold around 90,000 copies in the UK.

&quot;Empty Souls&quot;, the second and final single from the album, was released on 10 January 2005. Like the previous single, it debuted and peaked at No. 2.

== Reception ==
&quot;Lifeblood&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics, which had not happened for the band&#x27;s previous effort &quot;Know Your Enemy&quot;. The album has a weighted average score of 66 out of 100 on &quot;Metacritic&quot; based on 9 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

&quot;AllMusic&quot; awarded the album three stars out of five and stated: &quot;&quot;Lifeblood&quot; is a pleasant listen, but once you peel away the keyboards, sensitively strummed guitars and tasteful harmonies and concentrate on Bradfield&#x27;s nakedly open voice and Wire&#x27;s terminally collegiate lyrics, it&#x27;s hard to escape the unintentional pathos that winds up defining the album and, conceivably, the band&#x27;s latter-day career.&quot;

Barry Nicolson of &quot;NME&quot; wrote: &quot;Where &quot;Know Your Enemy&quot; strived vainly for relevance, &quot;Lifeblood&quot; is seemingly content to exist as a highbrow rock record. Out go song titles that were half-baked political manifestos in themselves (&#x27;Freedom of Speech Won&#x27;t Feed My Children&#x27; anyone?), in come elegiac pop anthems (&#x27;1985&#x27;) and the welcome presence of Bowie producer Tony Visconti to add a glacial sheen to the whole affair. Indeed, this is arguably the best Manics album since &quot;Everything Must Go&quot;.&quot;

Colin Weston of &quot;Drowned in Sound&quot; praised the album, writing: &quot;This is not rock, it is arguably not indie and would fit very comfortably next to the soft nu-wave eighties pop albums that your auntie has on the shelf... and it is quite simply brilliant! [...] &#x27;&quot;Generation Terrorists&quot;&#x27; may well live forever in the hearts of their fans but &#x27;&quot;Lifeblood&quot;&#x27; may well live forever as one of the best commercial albums of the band&#x27;s career.&quot; John Garrett from &quot;PopMatters&quot; wrote &quot;Richey may be long dead, but there&#x27;s still warm blood coursing through the Manics&#x27; veins. They are for real—although maybe not in the way history had intended.&quot;

A negative review came from &quot;Q&quot;, calling the album &quot;miserable and insipid&quot;.

== Legacy ==
In a reappraisal of the album following its 2024 re-issue, &quot;Clash&quot; argued that &quot;&quot;‘Lifeblood’&quot; was the starting point of the more varied textures that would follow in their music of the past two decades. Knowing when to ease off the bombast and how to present soulful, emotive ideas was a process most intently learnt in the writing of this record.&quot; Similarly, &quot;Louder Than War&quot; stated that the album &quot;provided a blueprint for some of the Manics’ more sedate recent albums, including 2021’s &quot;The Ultra Vivid Lament&quot;&quot; and that it &quot;elicits melancholy in razor-sharp quality.&quot;

The band themselves have also begun speaking positively about the album and how they had previously been dismissive of it. Wire explained in 2024: &quot;I think we’ve realised that it’s one of our best records. My problem was just that it was so unsuccessful.&quot;

===2024 Remastered Editions===
On 12th April 2024 the album was reissued as &quot;Lifeblood 20&quot; in single CD, 3CD digibook and 2LP formats to celebrate the 20th anniversary of its original release. It features two new remixes of &quot;1985&quot; by Porcupine Tree&#x27;s Steven Wilson and the Cornish singer Gwenno.

<text>Université Sainte-Anne is a French-language university in Pointe-de-l&#x27;Église, Nova Scotia, Canada. It and the Université de Moncton in New Brunswick are the only French-language universities in the Maritime Provinces.

==History==

Université Saint-Anne was founded on September 1, 1890 by Gustave Blanche, a Eudist Father, to facilitate the higher education of Acadians in Nova Scotia. The University was named after Saint Anne, the mother of the Virgin Mary.

In 2003, the provincial government merged the university with Collège de l&#x27;Acadie, a French-language community college with campuses throughout Nova Scotia.

Its enrolment for the 2005-2006 academic year was around 650-700 students, while in 2018, it had 390 full-time undergraduate students, 120 part-time undergrads, and 30 graduate students. 

From 3 March 2022 to 20 April 2022, the 39-member faculty union went on strike. At 49 days, it was one of the longest university strikes in Canadian history.

Beginning in September 2023, a student-led anti-rape culture campaign, SA Change Now, posted more than 60 anonymous accounts of sexual harassment, sexual assault, and rape at the university. They included the accounts of victims of a serial perpetrator who, in 2018-19, while working as a student security officer, sexually assaulted students. The campaign called for better lighting on the main (Church Point) campus, an on-site counsellor, a psychologist, a sexual-assault complaint officer, and an overhaul of the university&#x27;s sexual-assault hearing process. The university released its sexual violence policy, the revision of which had already been in the works, and hired a part-time counsellor. The campaign also requested that the Rector acknowledge and apologize for the rape culture on campus; no acknowledgement or apology was given. The administration never responded to the campaign or mentioned its name in any official communication, despite the campaign&#x27;s petition of support for its requests getting more than 800 signatures. In November 2023, the faculty union voted to recognize that there was a rape culture on campus. In 2024, a student sued the institution &quot;for failing to protect her from physical and emotional harm following a series of alleged sexual assaults on campus&quot;.

==Academics==

Université Sainte-Anne offers many university-level programs as well as college-level diploma programs. It has two faculties and one school: the Faculté des Arts et Sciences, Faculté des Programmes Professionnels and the French Immersion School. In the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, one may pursue studies in several fields: French language, literature and linguistics, history, Canadian studies, Acadian studies, commerce, English language and literature, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, General Sciences, Pre-Veterinary Studies, and Health Sciences. In the Faculty of Professional Programmes, students may pursue studies in Administrative sciences or in education. The most popular majors are: French, commerce, business administration and education.
In addition to the Pointe-de-l&#x27;Église main campus, students may take courses through the university at other locations: Tusket, Halifax, Petit-de-Grat and Saint-Joseph-du-Moine. Its Halifax campus offers a 1-year Bachelor of Education program and a Master of Education program.

<text>The University of Quebec in Outaouais (, , UQO) is a constituent university of the Université du Québec system located in Gatineau, Quebec, Canada. As of September 2010, combined enrolment at UQO&#x27;s Gatineau and Saint-Jérôme campuses was 6,017, of which 4,738 were undergraduates and 1,279 postgraduate students. UQO offers more than 100 programs of study, including 30 master&#x27;s and 5 doctoral programs.

It was named after Quebec&#x27;s Outaouais region. Outaouais borders Ottawa and is part of the National Capital Region, where a large proportion of the population is bilingual.

==History==
The university was established in 1981 under the government of René Lévesque (Parti Québécois), although university courses had been available in the region since 1971 (delivered by the Services universitaires dans l&#x27;Outaouais, or SUO).

Formerly known as the Université du Québec à Hull (UQAH), UQO changed its name in 2002 when the cities of Hull, Gatineau, Aylmer, Masson-Angers and Buckingham were amalgamated to form the new City of Gatineau. The university&#x27;s new name reflects the administrative region of Outaouais, in which it is based.

About 5,500 students enrol in UQO courses each year. While this is the lowest enrolment in the Université du Québec system, the number of students is steadily rising, creating demand for more courses, programs and resources. The academic staff comprises some 175 full-time professors and 565 lecturers.

In the past 25 years, UQO has granted close to 30,000 degrees. The university is also one of the main contributors to the qualified workforce in the region, along with Carleton University, University of Ottawa, La Cité collégiale, Algonquin College and the Cégep de l&#x27;Outaouais.

==Saint-Jérôme campus==
UQO&#x27;s Saint-Jérôme campus was inaugurated on January 22, 2010, at a ceremony attended by Michelle Courchesne, Québec Minister of Education, Recreation and Sports, Jean Vaillancourt, Rector of UQO, Marc Gascon, Mayor of Saint-Jérôme, Jacques Tanguay, President of Groupe AMT, and Sylvie Fréchette, Honorary Chair of the Fondation UQO fund-raising campaign.
UQO | Campus de Saint-Jérôme is housed in a building at the corner of rue Saint-Joseph and rue Labelle, opposite the town hall. Enrolment at the new satellite campus is close to 1,000. The six-storey main building includes classrooms, teaching and research laboratories, a library, an educational resource centre, office and administrative space, student lounges and ancillary services such as a cafeteria and bookstore.
On completion of the 400-day construction project, supervised by Groupe AMT, the building was delivered to the university du Québec en Outaouais at a pre-tax cost of $21,750,000. UQO&#x27;s project was modelled on the partnership used by the Université du Québec à Rimouski (UQAR) for its Lévis campus, which was also built by Groupe commercial AMT under the direction of Jacques Tanguay.
The building&#x27;s architecture combines angles and curves to maximize the admission of natural light. On each floor is a windowed student work area. Staff members have access to a third-floor terrace that offers a view of Mount Royal on a clear day.
The roof of this high-tech building features a solar wall that warms outside air before it is circulated indoors. The building, which will use 35% less energy than current Building Code standards, is awaiting LEED Silver certification.
Groupe AMT will retain ownership for a period of 25 years, during which time it will be responsible for building management, maintenance and surveillance. The building will be transferred to UQO at the end of the 25-year lease.
The Québec Ministry of Education, Recreation and Sports will provide an annual subsidy of $2.2 million over 25 years to cover the lease costs. This subsidy includes funding for construction costs and equipment acquisition for teaching spaces.
The town of Saint-Jérôme also made a generous contribution by donating the land on which the building stands, valued at $1.5 million.

===Programs offered at the Saint-Jérôme campus===
The programs offered by UQO in Saint-Jérôme have been chosen to meet workforce renewal realities in the Laurentian region.

==Research==
UQO has gained international recognition for its research activities, which have grown exponentially in the past five years. Led by its professors and researchers, the university&#x27;s research programs extend to such fields as psychology, computer science and engineering, design and museology, social work and language studies. There is also an emerging natural sciences component, particularly in silviculture and deciduous forest management, through a close partnership with the Institut québécois d&#x27;aménagement de la forêt feuillue.
The university is home to several different research bodies and specialized laboratories contributing to the expansion of knowledge.

==Research centres==
UQO also has four research centres:
* Social innovation research centre (CRISES)
* Territorial development research centre (CRDT)
* Centre for studies and research on social intervention (CÉRIS)
* Language Technologies Research Centre (LTRC)
Language Technologies Research Centre (LTRC)
In May 2006, UQO, in partnership with the federal government, inaugurated the Outaouais region&#x27;s first international research facility: the Language Technologies Research Centre (LTRC). 
The 4,500 m2 Centre, built at a cost of $15.2 million, houses some 150 language industry specialists who pool their expertise in technology and linguistics on specific projects. The LRTC is a unique environment combining computer technology, information sciences, engineering and language and translation studies to develop integrated applications for multilingual information processing. The centre supports the Canadian language industry, and makes UQO the ideal destination for anyone interested in studying, specializing or conducting research in this field.

==Expansion projects==
In January 2008, with a Québec government subsidy of $14 million, UQO began expanding wings A and C of its Alexandre-Taché pavilion, adding 7,600 m2 over five storeys.
This expansion will allow UQO to consolidate all of its activities at the Alexandre-Taché campus, to create a unique university environment in downtown Gatineau.
The addition includes new classrooms and high-tech laboratories for students in nursing, psychoeducation, psychology and labour relations.
The library and cafeteria were also expanded to improve the quality of student services.
Cyberpsychology laboratory.
The cyberpsychology laboratory was launched by Stéphane Bouchard in 1996 with an in-house research grant from the Université du Québec à Hull (as UQO was formerly known). After a number of projects co directed by Stéphane Bouchard and Patrice Renaud, the laboratory was given official status in 1999, with subsidies from various in-house researcher training and research funds.
By 2002, the laboratory had expanded to the point that it received subsidies from the Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI) and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), which gave added impetus to the work in progress, including projects involving the use of videoconferencing in the treatment of panic disorder with agoraphobia, and the use of virtual reality in the treatment of anxiety disorders.
The research team is headed by Stéphane Bouchard, Ph.D. and Patrice Renaud, Ph.D., who both hold undergraduate and post-doctoral degrees in psychology and teach in UQO&#x27;s Psychology Department.

==UQO Foundation==
This foundation was created in order to collect funds in order to improve the university&#x27;s infrastructure and to meet the demand for the increasingly student population from year after year.

The funds are sometimes coming from students who are optionally paying a top-off cost during their semester inscription. Generally, the optional fee is $5 per student and a great number of them did donate that amount. On their website people can donate various amount by filling up a form. The UQO also collects funds from various events organized throughout the year.

In 2006, the UQO set up a goal of about 10 million dollars.

==Student associations==
The main student association of the university is called the AGE-UQO (called l&#x27;Association Générale des Etudiant(es) de l&#x27;Université du Québec en Outaouais (General Student Association). There are also smaller associations which includes only members from a particular faculty such the AEMSS (social sciences), the AEEMP (psychology), the AEME (education), the AEML (arts and letters), the AEMP (educational psychology), the AESS (health sciences), the CEG (computer engineering), the REEEMI (image multidisciplinary school), the REETS (social work), the REI (computer science) and the REMAA (business administration).

==Radio station==
Reel-Radio, a community university radio station like Carleton University&#x27;s CKCU-FM only airs at the UQO, but the station is in the process of becoming a new radio station for the FM brand. 

The process is under examination by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) and Reel-Radio may start to air in the FM band starting in the fall of 2007.

<doc id="1018555" wikidata="Q1661096" url="?curid=1018555" title="Independent Group (art movement)">
<text>The Independent Group (IG) met at the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA) in London, England, from 1952 to 1955. The IG consisted of painters, sculptors, architects, writers and critics who wanted to challenge prevailing modernist approaches to culture. They introduced mass culture into debates about high culture, re-evaluated modernism and created the &quot;as found&quot; or &quot;found object&quot; aesthetic. The subject of renewed interest in a post-disciplinary age, the IG was the topic of a two-day, international conference at the Tate Britain in March 2007. The Independent Group is regarded as the precursor to the Pop Art movement in Britain.

==First session (1952)==
The Independent Group had its first meeting in April 1952, which consisted of artist and sculptor Eduardo Paolozzi feeding a mass of colourful images from American magazines through an epidiascope. These images, composed of advertising, comic strips and assorted graphics, were collected when Paolozzi was resident in Paris from 1947-49. Much of the material was assembled as scrapbook collages and formed the basis of his BUNK! series of screenprints (1972) and the &quot;Krazy Kat Archives&quot; now held at the V &amp; A Museum, London. In fact, Paolozzi&#x27;s seminal 1947 collage &quot;I was a Rich Man&#x27;s Plaything&quot; was the first such &quot;found object&quot; material to contain the word ″pop″ and is considered the initial standard bearer of “Pop Art”. The rest of the first Independent Group session concentrated on philosophy and technology during September 1952 to June 1953, and was chaired by design critic and historian, Reyner Banham. Key members at this stage included Paolozzi, the artist Richard Hamilton, surrealist and magazine art director Toni del Renzio, sculptor William Turnbull, the photographer Nigel Henderson and fine artist John McHale, along with the art critic Lawrence Alloway.

==Second session (1954)==
The Group did not meet during late 1953 or early 1954, as they were concentrating on delivering a public programme of lectures at the ICA, &quot;Aesthetic Problems of Contemporary Art&quot;. New members joined the Independent Group for its second full session, including the architects Alison and Peter Smithson. The Smithsons along with Paolozzi, Henderson, Ronald Jenkins, Toni del Renzio, Banham and others staged the highly significant exhibition, &quot;Parallel of Life and Art&quot; at the ICA in the Autumn of 1953. Reyner Banham stood down as chair of the &quot;Independent Group&quot;, as he was busy with his PhD thesis at the Courtauld Institute of Art, and in late 1954 Dorothy Morland asked the art critic Lawrence Alloway and fine artist John McHale to reconvene the Independent Group for its second session. The painter Magda Cordell and her husband, music producer Frank Cordell joined the Independent Group at this point.

The second session focused on American mass culture such as Western movies, science fiction, billboards, car design and popular music. In the course of such discussions, they drew upon Futurist, Surrealist, the Bauhaus, and Dada concepts. John McHale and Lawrence Alloway curated a &quot;Collages and Objects&quot; exhibition at the ICA in 1954, where McHale exhibited his formative Pop Art collages. Richard Hamilton organised an exhibition, &quot;Man, Machine and Motion&quot; in late 1955 at the Hatton Gallery, Newcastle and the ICA, which focussed on some &quot;Independent Group&quot; concerns.

==&quot;This Is Tomorrow&quot; (1956)==
In 1956 the group came to wider public attention with its participation in the exhibition This Is Tomorrow. The IG ceased to meet formally by 1955, but the IG members continued to meet informally right up to 1962/63, and the connections between the various members continued to bear fruit in the subsequent years of their creative practice.

<text>The Université du Québec à Rimouski (; commonly referred to as UQAR) is a public university located in Rimouski, Quebec, Canada with a campus in Lévis.

Since its establishment in 1969, Université du Québec à Rimouski (UQAR) has granted over 50,000 diplomas. In addition to its Lévis and Rimouski campuses, UQAR offers academic training throughout eastern Quebec, including the Chaudière-Appalaches, Gaspésie-Iles-de-la-Madeleine, Haute-Côte-Nord, and Manicouagan. It also has permanent offices in Gaspé and Rivière-du-Loup.

UQAR is part of the Université du Québec network, the largest university network in Canada, with over 100,000 students. UQAR welcomes about 7,000 new students every year, including about 550 foreign students from over 45 countries. UQAR has strength in marine science, regional development, and nordic studies.

The university&#x27;s athletics teams are known as the &quot;Nordet&quot;, a French word used to refer to a northeasterly wind (and a reference to UQAR&#x27;s location in Québec).

==History==
=== First milestones ===
Religious and community leaders first proposed establishing a university in Rimouski in the 1930s. By the 1950s, the Seminaire de Rimouski had begun offering postsecondary level courses in partnership with Université Laval. Following the onset of the Quiet Revolution in Québec, postsecondary access expanded in the Bas-Saint-Laurent region. The Parent Commission report established that Québec&#x27;s citizens were entitled to full educational opportunities at all levels. Implementing the report&#x27;s recommendations necessitated secularizing the province&#x27;s educational system, which had largely been run by religious organizations. An act creating the Université du Québec was passed by the provincial legislative assembly in 1968. One year later, the Université du Québec à Rimouski opened on the grounds of the former monastery of the Ursulines of Quebec.

====2009 fire====
During the night of May 14, 2009, at approximately 1:30, the fire alarm system was triggered and reported by the on-duty Rimouski campus security agent while at the same time smoke was spotted by patrolmen from the Sûreté du Québec passing by. The fire resulted in a general alarm for the Rimouski fire department, prompting assistance from the fire departments of Bic and St-Anaclet. By midday, the fire was contained and mostly put out. It resulted in the destruction of the main wing&#x27;s belfry as well as major fire damage to the roof and water damage to the floors below.

The affected wing houses procurement and printing services, student services, the student&#x27;s bookstore, the rector&#x27;s and vice-rectors offices, finances and human resources as well as classes and working spaces of graduate students. The university&#x27;s geography department uses the classes located on the 5th floor, directly under the fire-damaged part of the building, and the offices located directly under the collapsed belfry are occupied by researchers. Many graduate students are also working on the 5th floor.

The damage was estimated at the time to be at least $3 million.

=== The Rimouski campus today ===
The administrative capital of the Lower St. Lawrence region and a bustling maritime community, Rimouski is also a genuine “student city” that hums with the activities of over 15,000 students every year (all levels considered). Students represent nearly one in three people living in this town of 50,000.

The Rimouski campus now has 11 pavilions, in addition to student residences. The Rimouski campus also houses the Rimouski Institute of Marine Sciences (ISMER) and the Centre for Support for Innovation through Research (CAIR)

=== Lévis campus ===
The university opened a second campus in Lévis, in Québec&#x27;s capital region in 1980. The Lévis campus of UQAR has become a major pole for the institution. In 2019-2020, the Lévis campus was attended by about 3,000 students.

UQAR offers academic training throughout eastern Quebec, including the Chaudière-Appalaches, Gaspésie-Iles-de-la-Madeleine, Haute-Côte-Nord, and Manicouagan. It also has permanent offices in Gaspé and Rivière-du-Loup.

==Programs of study==
UQAR offers over 160 undergraduate to doctoral-level training programs in the fields of administration, biology, environmental and bioresource chemistry, regional development, education, ethics, engineering, geography, history, computer science, literature and creative writing, oceanography, psychosociology, accounting, nursing, and social work.

Owing to its privileged geographic location, UQAR enables students to explore and study natural environments that are near the campuses. While maintaining a primary focus on academic achievement, the training programs offered by UQAR stand out for their excellence and distinctive nature.

== Foreign students ==
UQAR has established more than 70 cooperation and exchange programs with about 15 countries around the world.

Each year, UQAR welcomes about 550 foreign students.

== Research ==
From the onset, UQAR has faced up to the challenges of its natural setting by concentrating on its strengths, namely its environmental resources. This is the reason for which marine science, regional development, and nordic studies are the three major areas of research at UQAR. These fields are integrated to meet the challenges of the territory covered by the university. These areas of research bring together a mass of researchers. In addition, research in engineering, education, literature, heritage, management science, and health science has been booming in recent years.

The independent firm RE$EARCH Infosource Inc. has repeatedly rated UQAR among the best performing Canadian universities in the field of research. For the 2011 to 2019 period, it was ranked eight times among the top three research universities offering mainly undergraduate courses. Over a ten-year period from 1999 to 2009, UQAR&#x27;s research funding increased from $3.8 million to $17.4 million.

=== Marine sciences ===
From its beginning, Université du Québec à Rimouski has been at the forefront of the study and understanding of the marine environment.

The recognition of marine sciences as an area of excellence has enabled UQAR to develop a sizeable research capacity in the field. Today, UQAR has brought together a remarkably strong group of researchers, whose expertise touch on a vast array of questions in the field of marine sciences.

The Institut des sciences de la mer de Rimouski enjoys international recognition as the flagship of Quebec research in this field.

Over the past decade, more than $50M have been invested in infrastructure, including equipment, to support the marine science sector in the Rimouski region, in particular at UQAR-ISMER.
=== Regional development ===
QAR’s expertise in regional development is anything but a random process. It is the result of a long tradition of reflection and research that goes back several decades. At the beginning of the Quiet Revolution in the 1960s, the Quebec and Canadian governments identified the Lower St. Lawrence and Gaspésie regions as future laboratories for social experimentation in the area of regional development.

UQAR is looking to better grasp the issues and problems facing regions in connection with current economic and societal changes. Researchers associated with this line of research analyze socioterritorial dynamics affecting regions and create tools for development assistance.

Regional development is a primary institutional focus in both basic and applied research, with a number of organized research units. This field of multidisciplinary study meets regional, national, and international concerns.

=== Nordic studies ===
UQAR is dedicated to the study of the Far North and cold lower latitudes. This research area brings together a diversity of researchers with a multidisciplinary interest in northern environments around a number of highly complementary disciplines.

Research at the Biology, Chemistry, and Geography Department is aimed at better understanding the processes of environments in cold climates in order to respond to major conservation and sustainable management challenges. It helps to determine a state of reference for the northern environments and their changing dynamics.

Regional development researchers and students analyze the socioterritorial dynamics in Québec, including the North, and create development assistance tools. Focus is placed on the effects of development policies on the regional economy, the social acceptability of natural resource exploitation projects, and local community adaptation to climate change.

Health research at UQAR is characterized by a multidisciplinary approach to the study of healthcare in rural areas, including northern regions, both in regards to care and services and to the populations concerned, mainly vulnerable groups.

UQAR’s expertise in engineering is focused in a number of areas related to mechanical and electrical engineering, allowing for the implementation of a range of projects, such as identification and exploitation of wind power energy potential in northern environments, including technological innovation ensuring optimal energy management of the equipment used in resource exploitation.

<text>Sings Reign Rebuilder is the debut album of the Canadian band Set Fire to Flames. It was released by Alien8 Recordings, FatCat Records in 2001.

The album was recorded in a century-old house (either named or later dubbed 15 Ontario) apparently bound for destruction. From the liner notes: &quot;your bulldozers and wrecking ball can make match-sticks out of the rickety staircase and crookt/creaking floorboards---but they can&#x27;t erase the recording that was made here.&quot; As such, several sounds usually edited out of the recording process, including creaking floors, paper shuffling and outside noises, were left intact on the final album. The most notable occurrence is that of a police car driving by with its siren blaring at the end of &quot;Love Song for 15 Ontario&quot;; the vehicle was later credited as a guest performer on the song.

An underlying concept in the work is the &quot;Lying Dying Wonder Body&quot;, which consists of spoken word passages dealing with theoretical and political concepts that concern global climate and love.

<doc id="1018598" wikidata="Q170327" url="?curid=1018598" title="South Africa national soccer team">
<text>The South Africa national soccer team represents South Africa in men&#x27;s international soccer and is run by the South African Football Association, the governing body for Soccer in South Africa. Nicknamed Bafana Bafana (The Boys in Zulu), the team&#x27;s home ground is FNB Stadium, which is located in Johannesburg. The team is a member of both FIFA and Confederation of African Football (CAF). The team is one of the most well-supported national sides in Africa, and are recognized by their traditional yellow-green kits.

Having played their first match in 1906, they returned to the world stage in 1992, after 16 years of being banned from FIFA, and 40 years of effective suspension due to the apartheid system. South Africa have qualified for the FIFA World Cup three times: 1998, 2002, and 2010, when it hosted the tournament, becoming the first African nation to do so. Despite defeating France 2–1 in their final game of the Group Stage, they failed to progress from the first round of the tournament, becoming the first host nation in the history of the FIFA World Cup to exit in the group stage, followed by Qatar in 2022. As of 15 February 2024, the team is ranked 10th in Africa (CAF) and 58th in FIFA.

South Africa&#x27;s most significant achievement came in 1996 when they hosted and won the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON). They reached the final again in 1998 but were defeated by Egypt.

Some of the most notable players in Bafana Bafana&#x27;s history include Benni McCarthy, the team&#x27;s top scorer with 31 goals, and Aaron Mokoena, who holds the record for the most caps with 107 appearances. Other significant players include Lucas Radebe, Doctor Khumalo, and Itumeleng Khune.

==History==

===Pre-1992===
Football first arrived in South Africa through colonialism in the late nineteenth century, as the game was popular among British soldiers. From the earliest days of the sport in South Africa until the end of apartheid, organised soccer was affected by the country&#x27;s system of racial segregation. The all-white Football Association of South Africa (FASA) was formed in 1892, while the South African Indian Football Association (SAIFA), the South African Bantu Football Association (SABFA) and the South African Black Football Association (SACFA) were founded in 1903, 1933 and 1936 respectively.
In 1903 the SAFA re-affiliated with the English Football Association after the Second Boer War between the British Empire and the Boer state. There was a plan to play a tournament held in Argentina, with South Africa and Fulham as guest teams, but it was not carried out. Nevertheless, South Africa traveled to South America in 1906 to play a series of friendly matches there.

South Africa played a total of 12 matches in South America, winning 11 with 60 goals scored and only 7 conceded. Some of the rivals were Belgrano A.C., Argentina national team, a Liga Rosarina combined, Estudiantes (BA) and Quilmes. The only team that could beat South Africa was the Argentine Alumni by 1–0 at Sociedad Sportiva stadium of Buenos Aires, on 24 June, although the South Africans would take revenge on 22 July, defeating the Alumni by 2–0.

The players were exclusively white, civil servants, government employees, bankers and civil engineers. Seven of the 15 players were born in South Africa and 8 originated from England and Scotland.

South Africa was one of four African nations to attend FIFA&#x27;s 1953 congress, at which the four demanded, and won, representation on the FIFA executive committee. Thus the four nations (South Africa, Ethiopia, Egypt and Sudan) founded the Confederation of African Football in 1956, and the South African representative, Fred Fell, sat at the first meeting as a founding member. It soon became clear however that South Africa&#x27;s constitution prohibited racially mixed teams from competitive sport, and so they could only send either an all-black side or an all-white side to the planned 1957 African Cup of Nations. This was unacceptable to the other members of the Confederation, and South Africa was disqualified from the competition, however, some sources say that they withdrew voluntarily.

At the second CAF conference in 1958, South Africa were formally expelled from CAF. The all-white FASA were admitted to FIFA in the same year, but in August 1960 it was given an ultimatum of one year to fall in line with the non-discriminatory regulations of FIFA. On 26 September 1961 at the annual FIFA conference, the South African association was formally suspended from FIFA. Sir Stanley Rous, president of The Football Association of England and a champion of South Africa&#x27;s FIFA membership, was elected FIFA President a few days later. Rous was adamant that sport, and FIFA in particular, should not embroil itself in political matters and against fierce opposition, he continued to resist attempts to expel South Africa from FIFA. The suspension was lifted in January 1963 after a visit to South Africa by Rous in order to investigate the state of soccer in the country.

Rous declared that if the suspension were not lifted, soccer there would be discontinued, possibly to the point of no recovery. The next annual conference of FIFA in October 1964 took place in Tokyo and was attended by a larger contingent of representatives from African and Asian associations and here the suspension of South Africa&#x27;s membership was re-imposed. In 1976, after the Soweto uprising, they were formally expelled from FIFA.

In 1991, when the apartheid system was beginning to be demolished, a new multi-racial South African Football Association was formed, and admitted to FIFA – and thus finally allowing South Africa to enter the qualifying stages for subsequent World Cups.

===1992–1994: Readmission===
After spending nearly two decades in international isolation, the South African national team played its first game on 7 July 1992, beating Cameroon 1–0 at Kings Park in Durban.

The team entered the 1994 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers and was placed in Group 5, along with Mauritius, Zambia and Zimbabwe. They won one game, away to Mauritius, and drew with Mauritius and Zimbabwe at home. The team finished third in the group and failed to qualify.

For the 1994 FIFA World Cup qualifiers South Africa was placed in Group D, along with Congo, Libya and Nigeria. Libya withdrew from the qualifiers. South Africa beat Congo home and away. They drew with Nigeria at home and lost away. South Africa finished second in the group, and failed to qualify for the next stage of the qualifiers.

===1996–1998: Rise===
In 1996, a mere 5 years after readmission, South Africa achieved their finest moment when they hosted (and won) the 1996 Africa Cup of Nations, in the process reaching the lofty heights of 16th in the FIFA rankings. The shock firing of Cup of Nations winning coach Clive Barker did little to slow momentum as they followed their 1996 success with a second-place finish at the 1998 Africa Cup of Nations after Egypt under Jomo Sono. The team had earned their first appearance at the FIFA World Cup, qualifying for France &#x27;98. Under head coach Philippe Troussier, South Africa suffered a heavy 3–0 defeat to hosts France in their World Cup debut, but played credibly against other group opponents Denmark and Asian juggernauts Saudi Arabia, earning 1–1 and 2–2 draws respectively on their way to an early exit.

===2000–2002: Peak and coaching instability===
Following their successful 1996 and 1998 Africa Cup of Nations&#x27; campaigns and their World Cup debut in 1998, South Africa were seen as a growing power on the continent. Under the coaching of the newly hired Trott Moloto they would start the decade off strongly, finishing third in the 2000 edition of the Africa Cup of Nations, but as was increasingly symptomatic of soccer in South Africa at the national level, yet another coaching change was made. Portuguese Carlos Queiroz was hired as the man to take South Africa to the 2002 FIFA World Cup. South Africa qualified for the 2002 Africa Cup of Nations and were eliminated in the quarter-finals against hosts Mali. In the run-up to the 2002 FIFA World Cup, for which South Africa had easily qualified as winners of Group E, Queiroz left his post as head coach amid increasing behind-the-scenes political wrangling.

Former legend Jomo Sono was brought back in a caretaker capacity to lead South Africa in Korea/Japan. Placed in Group B along with Spain, Paraguay and debutants Slovenia at the 2002 FIFA World Cup, South Africa had high hopes of progressing to the knockout phase of the tournament. After earning a 2–2 draw against Paraguay in their opening game with a last-gasp penalty from Quinton Fortune and following it up with their first-ever victory at the finals with a 1–0 win over Slovenia, South Africa headed into their final game against Spain second in the group and 3 points clear of Paraguay and Slovenia. In arguably the game of the group, in which 5 goals were scored inside the hour, South Africa twice came from a goal down in an agonising 3–2 defeat to the Spanish. In the other game, which kicked off at the same time as the South Africa-Spain game, Paraguay found themselves beating Slovenia 2–1, but the result was not enough for Paraguay to surpass South Africa in the standings as South Africa&#x27;s goal difference of zero was superior to Paraguay&#x27;s minus one. But South African hearts would be broken. With 84 minutes gone in the Slovenia-Paraguay game Nelson Cuevas bagged a vital third goal for Paraguay, giving Paraguay a 3–1 victory over Slovenia. The win left both Paraguay and South Africa level on 4 points with the late Cuevas strike against Slovenia lifting Paraguay&#x27;s goal difference to zero, level with South Africa&#x27;s. The deciding factor moved onto a third tiebreaker; goals scored, and as Paraguay had scored six goals to South Africa&#x27;s five, they progressed to the Round of 16 at the expense of South Africa. What made the early exit all the more heartbreaking was that South Africa was the only team in the group that managed to hold its own against runaway group winners Spain, as both Slovenia and Paraguay were comfortably cast aside 3–1 by the Spanish.

This era (1996–2002) of rising soccer prowess saw South Africa blessed with fine footballers such as record-setting goalscorers Benni McCarthy &amp; Shaun Bartlett, defensive hardmen and inspirational captains Lucas Radebe &amp; Neil Tovey, creative maestros John Moshoeu &amp; Doctor Khumalo and defensive stalwart Mark Fish.

===2002–2006: Decline and coaching roundabout===
In the period following the 2002 World Cup and leading up to the 2006 FIFA World Cup, South Africa would go through 4 head coaches; Ephraim Mashaba (2002–2004), April Phumo (2004), Stuart Baxter (2004–2005), Ted Dumitru (2005–2006) and caretaker Pitso Mosimane (2006). Neither coach was able to match the successes seen in the period 1996–2002 as South Africa failed to progress beyond the group stages in either the 2004 Africa Cup of Nations or 2006 Africa Cup of Nations, failing to register a single goal in the latter. Above all though, South Africa failed to qualify for the 2006 FIFA World Cup. After being placed in Group 2 for qualifying, South Africa were beaten to Germany by Ghana. Following poor performances in both the 2004 and 2006 Africa Cup of Nations, rumours circulated that SAFA had been attempting to attract a high-profile international manager to coach &quot;Bafana Bafana&quot; and that former England boss Sven-Göran Eriksson had been targeted. This rumour however has been denied.

===2007–2010: Hosting the World Cup===

By failing to register a single goal at the 2006 Africa Cup of Nations and by missing out on Germany 2006, local supporters had become increasingly unhappy with the decline in the performance of the national team. In light of these poor performances, it was decided that the hiring of a more experienced manager was essential. Former World Cup-winner and Brazil national team coach Carlos Alberto Parreira was approached for the job and he accepted. He signed a R100 million contract covering four years. His term as manager started 1 January 2007 targeting the 2010 FIFA World Cup, which South Africa had been awarded the right to host, becoming the first African nation to ever host association football&#x27;s global showpiece.

Under Parreira, with his rich history of success at the international level, South Africa was expected to improve, but early signs were not good as they would exit the 2008 Africa Cup of Nations at the first hurdle once again. To make matters worse, Parreira stood down as coach in April 2008 due to family reasons. Joel Santana was hand-picked by Parreira to succeed him and he was signed to coach the team until 2010. Under Santana South Africa would slide into its darkest period in international soccer since readmission. Failing to even qualify for the 2010 Africa Cup of Nations with soccer characterised by a complete lack of creativity and little goal-scoring threat, South Africa tumbled down the FIFA rankings and was at one point not even ranked among Africa&#x27;s top-10 nations. Santana was fired in 2009 and Parreira would return in time for the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup – also hosted by South Africa – and South Africa would see an improvement in performance, holding its own against eventual world champions Spain and perennial powerhouse Brazil, the latter requiring an 88th-minute goal to overcome South Africa in the semi-finals. South Africa would ultimately finish 4th, following a thrilling 3–2 loss to the Spanish in the 3rd/4th Place Playoff.

A string of victories, albeit against marginal opposition, in the run-up to the 2010 FIFA World Cup seemed to instill a sense of confidence in the team as well as the nation. For the 2010 World Cup, the first in Africa, South Africa was placed in Group A, along with Mexico, surprise package and eventual semi-finalists Uruguay and former world champions France. South Africa played the first game, which opened the World Cup 2010 tournament with a 1–1 draw against Mexico after taking the lead through a long-range Siphiwe Tshabalala strike. Katlego Mphela would hit the post late into the game as South Africa, buoyed by a frenzied home crowd, so very nearly opened the tournament with a win. A heavy 3–0 defeat in the second group game against Uruguay and a Mexican win over France left South Africa with a mountain to climb in order to progress beyond the group stage. For the deciding match against France, Parreira would discard his previous tactics of a defensive-minded five-man midfield and a lone forward in favour of a more attacking formation utilising two forwards, as up until the France game South Africa had focused more on not losing than they did on trying to win, but the heavy defeat against Uruguay coupled with Mexico&#x27;s victory over France had now left them with a goal difference of negative three that needed to be overcome in order for them to progress. South Africa would also require a favour from Uruguay, needing the Uruguayans to inflict a sizeable defeat on Mexico to aid their chances of progress. The change in tactics worked as South Africa gained the upper hand over the French, attacking at will. At the half, South Africa had a 2–0 lead thanks to goals from Bongani Khumalo and Katlego Mphela while Uruguay were beating Mexico 1–0 in the other group game. As it stood, South Africa needed at least one more goal against France while Uruguay needed to double their lead against Mexico. It was not to be as while South Africa did secure a historic victory over France, they failed to score again and conceded a late goal for a 2–1 victory while the Uruguayans had failed to add to their lead, as they ran out 1–0 victors over Mexico. For the second World Cup in a row, South Africa finished level on points with second place but were eliminated, this time on goal difference while it had been on goals scored in 2002. Elimination in the group stage made South Africa the first host to fail to progress beyond the first round of a World Cup.
Following the conclusion of the World Cup and the expiration of his contract, Carlos Alberto Parreira announced his retirement from coaching. As part of his contract, Parreira had also drawn up a plan of recommendations extending as far as soccer development at grassroots level that SAFA was encouraged to review in the hopes of reviving the fortunes of the national soccer team. Pitso Mosimane, who had been Parreira&#x27;s assistant, was selected as the new head coach with Parreira&#x27;s blessings.

===2012–2014: Continued struggles===
South Africa failed to qualify for the Africa Cup of Nations finals after the rules were misread. They ultimately played for and achieved a draw at home in Nelspruit against Sierra Leone in a game they needed to win, when news about Niger trailing in Egypt was received, leading to the qualification of Niger at their expense, and also at Sierra Leone&#x27;s. They then celebrated at the end as if they had qualified, making it the second time they would be so embarrassed in 4 years after qualifying as a lucky 3rd and last best runners-up for the 2008 edition, with Zambia catapulting over South Africa as Group winners after a 3–1 win in Cape Town – and thereby gaining an automatic qualifying ticket on the head-to-head record with the South Africans erroneously thinking goal difference would be the primary tie-breaker.

The SABC also announced that the team had qualified and the SAFA president Kirsten Nematandani then congratulated the team on TV before realisation dawned. SAFA said they would appeal to CAF but the appeal was later withdrawn.

South Africa continued to disappoint into 2012, opening the year with a lacklustre 0–0 draw away to 2012 Africa Cup of Nations co-hosts Equatorial Guinea. This would be the start of a run that would see &quot;Bafana Bafana&quot; rack up 6 successive draws to start the year. The run of draws included 1–1, 0–0 and 1–1 draws at home to African champions Zambia, Ghana and Senegal respectively in International Friendlies. Following a 1–1 draw at home to Ethiopia in a 2014 World Cup qualifier, head coach Pitso Mosimane was fired. The draw increased South Africa&#x27;s streak to 7 games without a win. Mosimane was replaced as head coach by Steve Komphela on an interim basis while SAFA interviewed potential candidates to fill the post on a permanent basis.

In his first game in charge as interim head coach, Komphela oversaw yet another uninspired performance in South Africa&#x27;s second World Cup qualifier against Botswana as they drew yet again, extending their winless run to 8 games. &quot;Bafana Bafana&quot; finally tasted victory when they defeated Gabon 3–0 at home in a friendly, ending their winless streak.

Komphela, along with Gordon Igesund, Gavin Hunt, Neil Tovey and Ephraim &quot;Shakes&quot; Mashaba had been shortlisted as one of the candidates to be the next head coach of South Africa, with Komphela and Igesund emerging as the front-runners. On 30 June 2012, Gordon Igesund was appointed as the new head coach.

Following the crisis in Libya throughout 2011, CAF made the decision to move the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations from Libya – who were the original hosts – to South Africa on the grounds of safety and security. Libya was then given the right to host the 2017 edition of the tournament, which was originally awarded to South Africa. As hosts of the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations, South Africa would automatically qualify for the competition.

South Africa, as hosts, were seeded and drawn in Group A along with Angola, Morocco and tournament debutants Cape Verde.

South Africa kicked the tournament off on 19 January against debutants Cape Verde at a wet National Stadium. South Africa made use of a defensive formation as coach Gordon Igesund deployed two deep midfielders in Kagisho Dikgacoi and Reneilwe Letsholonyane and along with the poor weather conditions delivered an uninspired performance resulting in a 0–0 draw. In the hosts&#x27; second group game against Angola, coach Igesund dropped his midfield pairing of Dikgacoi and Letsholonyane and opted for a new midfield pairing of the defensive minded Dean Furman and the more attacking May Mahlangu. The result was a far more confident display as Dean Furman took control of the midfield – something that was lacking in the first game – and delivered a man of the match performance. South Africa ran out winners with goals from Siyabonga Sangweni and Lehlohonolo Majoro setting up a 2–0 victory. Heading into the final group game against Morocco South Africa only had to avoid defeat in order to progress to the knockout stages while Morocco needed a win to progress. South Africa put in a woeful first-half performance that saw them 1–0 down at halftime and struggling with the Moroccans&#x27; direct approach. It was only thanks to the heroics of goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune, who pulled off a string of stunning saves, that South Africa were not further behind. An improved second half saw South Africa fight back with an equaliser from May Mahlangu, but South Africa continued to look vulnerable against Morocco&#x27;s direct approach and subsequently fell behind again in the 81st minute. But typical of their improved tenacity in the second half South Africa swiftly responded through a Siyabonga Sangweni equaliser in the 86th minute. South Africa hung on to the draw, with the result enough to see them win group A and progress to the quarterfinals. Sangweni&#x27;s late equaliser would prove vital as an injury time winner by Cape Verde in their final game against Angola would have seen Morocco and Cape Verde progress at the expense of South Africa, but as it was South Africa went through along with Cape Verde, who enjoyed a stunning debut in Africa&#x27;s showpiece tournament.

South Africa were drawn against Group B runners-up Mali in the quarterfinals. South Africa delivered a stunning first-half performance, playing at a high tempo to negate the Malians&#x27; superior physical presence. Unable to keep up with the pace of the game, Mali were overwhelmed as South Africa carved out chance after chance, finally making the breakthrough in the 31st minute as Thuso Phala drove into the box and fired a low cross across the goalmouth which an open Tokelo Rantie pounced on. South Africa headed into the break 1–0 up. However, in the second half, led by veteran midfielder and captain Seydou Keita, the Malians began to impose themselves and equalised in the 58th minute amid a momentary defensive collapse as the South African defense allowed captain Keita to head home an unchallenged cross. From that point on it was Mali that controlled the game. Neither side was able to secure a winner and the game headed into extra time. After another goalless 30 minutes, the game moved to penalties. Siphiwe Tshabalala took the first penalty and gave South Africa the lead with a stunningly placed shot into the top left corner. Cheick Diabaté would swiftly respond. Then South Africa&#x27;s tournament proceeded to unravel. Dean Furman was next up for South Africa but he saw his weak shot easily saved by goalkeeper Soumbeïla Diakité. Adama Tamboura would score Mali&#x27;s second penalty handing them the advantage. In an almost carbon copy of Furman&#x27;s penalty, May Mahlangu&#x27;s penalty was also easily saved low to the left by goalkeeper Diakité. Mahamane Traoré confidently dispatched Mali&#x27;s third penalty, handing them a comfortable 3–1 cushion. Lehlohonolo Majoro was next up for South Africa but the pressure was too much as he fired a wild shot high and to the right of the goal. With the miss, South Africa were eliminated from the tournament 3–1 on penalties.

After a poor 2012 in which South Africa had performed poorly and had steadily slid down FIFA&#x27;s rankings, their performance in the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations was a marked improvement. Although coach Gordon Igesund had been handed the almost impossible task of a semifinal berth as a target in his contract, SAFA came out and said the signs of improvement were sufficient for Igesund&#x27;s job to remain safe.

South Africa received a First round bye when the qualifying process for the 2014 FIFA World Cup got underway on 30 July 2011. For the Second round of the qualifying process, South Africa was placed in Pot 1 as a top-seeded nation for the draw from where they were drawn into Group A, along with neighbors Botswana, the Central African Republic and Ethiopia. South Africa opened their qualifying campaign with a dismal performance, struggling to overcome a one-goal deficit in a 1–1 home draw with Ethiopia, a nation ranked nearly 70 places below them. This result, coupled with the less than an inspiring string of results that had seen South Africa winless in the past 6 outings that preceded it, resulted in the sacking of head coach Pitso Mosimane. Under interim head coach Steve Khompela, South Africa played out to yet another uninspiring 1–1 draw, this time away to Botswana.

Following on from a positive display in the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations, Gordon Igesund guided South Africa to their first victory in the 2014 World Cup qualifiers as they beat the Central African Republic 2–0 in Cape Town. South Africa continued their push for a place at the World Cup with a 3–0 win over the Central African Republic on 8 June. South Africa endured a difficult build-up to the game as they were only able to practice once before the game due to a delayed connecting flight, but they performed admirably against their physical opponents on a bumpy pitch. The win was South Africa&#x27;s first away win in a World Cup qualifier since 2005. Ethiopia also won their match away to Botswana on the same day, maintaining their 2-point lead over South Africa.

South Africa and Ethiopia met in a potential group decider in Addis Ababa on 16 June, with the Ethiopians going undefeated at home in 12 games. South Africa were under pressure from the kick-off and as early as the 3rd-minute goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune was forced into a stunning save. South Africa would recover to take a 1–0 lead through a stunning left-footed half volley from Bernard Parker in the 33rd minute. The lead was short-lived as Ethiopia equalised in the 44th minute following a defensive lapse by South Africa when they failed to deal with a loose ball on the edge of the box. Ethiopia would secure the win thanks to a stunning own goal by Bernard Parker in the 70th minute as he headed the ball into his own net from a free-kick. The 2–1 defeat ended South Africa&#x27;s qualification hopes and assured Ethiopia passage to the third and final round of qualifying. However, following the match it emerged that Ethiopia were under investigation for fielding an ineligible player during their 2–1 win over Botswana and that they could face losing the 3 points and have the result reversed to a 3–0 defeat, as in line with FIFA sanctions. This would give South Africa an outside chance of qualifying for Brazil. Ethiopia later admitted to the error. On Tuesday, 19 June, it was reported in the South African press that Ethiopia had again fielded the same player against South Africa with the player still to serve his one-match ban and it might be possible that Ethiopia could face losing another 3 points to South Africa. Should this happen, South Africa would then qualify for the next round at the expense of Ethiopia.

South Africa failed to qualify. These were the final standings:
=== 2014–2016 ===
South Africa&#x27;s first match under new coach, Ephraim Mashaba was a Group A qualifying match for AFCON 2015, played at Al-Merrikh Stadium against Sudan on 5 September 2014. South Africa won the match 3–0 with two goals from Sibusiso Vilakazi in the 55th and 61st minutes and a goal from Bongani Ndulula in the 78th minute. South Africa&#x27;s second match in the AFCON qualifiers was a home match at Cape Town Stadium against Nigeria on 10 September. South Africa held off the defending AFCON champions for a 0–0 draw. Following these two matches, Bafana Bafana moved up two places to 67th in the FIFA world ranking.

South Africa then took on Congo at the Stade Municipal de Pointe-Noire on 11 October. The game was won 2–0 with goals from Bongani Ndulula and Tokelo Rantie in the second half. This victory brought South Africa to the top of Group A. Next was the return match in Polokwane&#x27;s Peter Mokaba Stadium. The game ended in a 0–0 stalemate which kept South Africa at the top of the group. Following these two matches, South Africa climbed ten places in the FIFA rankings to no. 57.

Next up was the second match against Sudan on 15 November which was won 2–1, with goals from Thulani Serero in the 37th minute, and Tokelo Rantie in the 54th minute. The game was originally scheduled to be played at the Mbombela Stadium in Nelspruit, but it was moved to the Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban in honour of captain and goalkeeper, Senzo Meyiwa who was shot and killed two weeks prior to the game. Coach Ephraim Mashaba said the win was for the fallen hero, who had not conceded a goal in the four qualifiers he had played. The result sealed qualification for South Africa, with an away game versus Nigeria to spare. It was the first time since 2008 that Bafana managed to qualify for the tournament (in 2013 they qualified as hosts after Libya exchanged their rights for security reasons).

The last game of the qualifiers was on 19 November at the Akwa Ibom Stadium in Uyo, Nigeria. It ended 2–2, therefore eliminating Nigeria and denying them the chance to defend their crown at 2015 AFCON. The coach Ephraim Mashaba had earlier said that South Africa would not do Nigeria any favours. It showed in the way that the South Africans approached the match. Tokelo Rantie missed a sitter in the fourth minute when he fluffed his chance over the bar, but he made amends when he opened the scoring in the 42nd minute after a neat pass from Dean Furman. It looked as if South Africa would get their first competitive win over Nigeria when Rantie doubled his and his country&#x27;s tally in the 48th minute. But it wasn&#x27;t to be, as they failed to hold on for a historic win. Nigeria came back to draw 2–2 but it wasn&#x27;t enough to secure Nigeria&#x27;s qualification as Congo beat Sudan 1–0 to book their place at the tournament.

Under Mashaba, South Africa failed to qualify for the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations. This, in addition to the various controversies, disparaging remarks that Mashaba allegedly made about SAFA top officials, his supposedly arrogant nature and his ill-treatment of overseas-based stars, led to his suspension after leading South Africa to a 2−1 victory over Senegal in a 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifier.

=== 2017–2023: promising generation ===

After being unable to reach the 2018 FIFA World Cup, South Africa had undergone a systematic reformation and transformation to regain its status as an African soccer power. The reformation of South African soccer was aided by the successful rise of its under-age soccer, including the U-17, U-20 and U-23 teams that all achieved some African successes and participated in World tournaments at their levels.

South Africa qualified for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations finishing second and undefeated, with a shock 2–0 away win over Nigeria. South Africa participated in the tournament grouped with Morocco, Ivory Coast and Namibia, and narrowly qualified to the knockout stage with only a single 1–0 win over Namibia and had to face host Egypt (which had Mohamed Salah), winners of AFCON seven times and had just qualified for Russia 2018 World Cup. The South Africans then pulled out the biggest upset in the tournament, knocking Egypt out in the round of 16 stage with a 1–0 win in Cairo. Then, South Africa once again faced Nigeria in the quarter-finals, but there was no further upset as Nigeria prevailed 2–1, but it was regarded as South Africa&#x27;s best performance in the 2010s.

Under Molefi Ntseki, South Africa failed to qualify for the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations. Molefi Ntseki was promptly sacked and the Hugo Broos was announced as his replacement.

Broos immediately set out to restructure the national team and the veteran players (Including captain Thulani Hlatshwayo) of the team were replaced with an exciting and young crop of players. Goalkeeper Ronwen Williams was named as the captain with Percy Tau being named as the vice-captain.

Broos&#x27; efforts led South Africa to put in a credible performance in the second round of African qualifiers for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, where South Africa were placed in a group with Ghana, Zimbabwe, and Ethiopia. South Africa got off to a promising start, beating a weakened Ghana side 1–0 at home on Matchday 2 and going to the top of the group. South Africa remained at the top of the group until the final matchday when they lost 0–1 away to Ghana after a dubious penalty was awarded to Ghana in the first half. South Africa ultimately finished second to Ghana on goals scored, narrowly missing out on qualification for the final 10-team playoff round to qualify for the World Cup. South Africa qualified to the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations after beating Liberia 2–1.

=== 2024: Resurgence ===
In the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations which was held in January 2024 at Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, Bafana Bafana was placed in Group E alongside Mali, Namibia and Tunisia. Pundits didn’t give them a flying chance, especially because two of their star strikers, Lyle Foster(Premier League) and Lebo Mothiba(Major Soccer League), were to miss the tournament on account of mental health challenges and injury respectively. While they did succumb to a 2-0 defeat against Mali, Bafana Bafana went on to trash Namibia 4-0 and drew 0-0 with Tunisia to secure a spot in the last 16 of the tournament. They were pitted against one of the tournament’s favourites, a massive Morocco side which boasted the likes of Achraf Hakimi. In a highly intense match, Bafana Bafana put Morocco to the sword by 2-0 and booked their place in the quarterfinals, where they were to face Cape Verde which was surprisingly on a winning streak. The game against Cape Verde ended goalless and was decided on penalties. This was a defining moment for goalkeeper and captain Ronwen Williams, who saved three penalties and made himself a contender for Goalkeeper of the Tournament accolade which he ultimately won. Bafana Bafana beat Cape Verde 2-1 on penalties and proceeded to the semi-finals.
They met Nigeria in the semi-finals; and the match ended 1-1. Unfortunately, they lost in the penalties. However, they redeemed themselves in the 3rd place play-off, where they secured a bronze medal against Democratic Republic of Congo. This was their best AFCON performance since the year 2000; and underscored the resurgence of Bafana Bafana as a continental powerhouse once again. With the goalkeeping prowess of Ronwen Williams; the midfield that has been patrolled by Teboho Mokoena and Sphephelo Sithole, as well as the silky displays of their veteran midfielder Themba Zwane, the resurgent Bafana Bafana has recently made things very difficult for every opponent they meet. 

The match against Nigeria in the AFCON also proved to be the last defeat for Bafana Bafana, who have since then dominated their opponents. In the two 2026 World Cup Qualifiers played in 2024, Bafana Bafana has played to a 1-1 draw against Nigeria away; and successfully defeated Zimbabwe 3-1 in a fully packed stadium in Bloemfontein.

In the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations Qualifiers, Bafana Bafana was placed in Group K alongside Uganda, Congo and South Sudan. The first game against Uganda at home ended in a 2-all draw. In the second game, Bafana Bafana edged South Sudan 3-2 away; and went on to demolish Congo at home by 5-0. While Congo was able to hold them to a 1-1 draw in their second meeting, Uganda was not so lucky and succumbed to a 2-0 defeat against Bafana Bafana. This placed Bafana Bafana at the summit of their group and guaranteed them qualification to the tournament. Their final match of the group was played on the 19th of November 2024 in a packed Cape Town Stadium against South Sudan, which stood no chance as Hugo Broos’ men ran a major riot and brutally dispatched their opponents with a resounding 3-0 to close off the year 2024 on a resounding high.

==Team image==

===Nickname===
&quot;Bafana Bafana&quot; is a nickname given to the national side by its fans. It is Nguni and translates literally as &quot;the boys, the boys&quot;. Its actual meaning in Nguni language is, &quot;Go boys! Go boys!&quot;, though others take the double use of &quot;Bafana&quot; to mean &quot;all of the boys&quot;---the team and management, as well as the spectators; togetherness, as in the African concept of ubuntu.

In July 1992, at Kings Park stadium in Durban, fans shouted &quot;Bafana Bafana&quot; [GO BOYS GO BOYS] when South Africa was on the verge of beating Cameroon and after the game. A group of three journalists, from South Africa newspaper &quot;The Sowetan&quot;, then began to use the name in print when referring to the team. The name was initially used only informally, as SAFA felt that it was not commercially viable, and that it was degrading to refer to a team of men as boys.

Standton Woodrush Ltd applied to trademark the name in 1993. The trademark was granted but was for clothing only. In 1994, the team&#x27;s technical sponsor at the time, Kappa, applied for the trademarks &quot;Bafana&quot; and &quot;Bafana Bafana&quot; in class 25. These were granted and subsequently passed on to SAFA. In 1997, SAFA filed for the trademark &quot;Bafana Bafana&quot; for all goods and services, in all classes.

SAFA then applied to have Standton Woodrush Ltd removed from the trademarks register, on the grounds that SAFA was the rightful owner of the name. The case was dismissed on the ground that SAFA was not an interested person within the meaning of this term as used in the Trade Marks Act No. 94 of 1993, which provides that only an interested party has legal standing to seek relief.

SAFA made another application to gain ownership of the trademark, with the second application going to the Appeal Court. The court again found that SAFA did not have the necessary grounds for ownership of the name in all classes. The court held that an intention to use a mark does not create a preference for registration, and that the proprietor of a trademark need not be its originator.

In 2011 SAFA paid R5 million to Standton Woodrush Ltd for rights to the name &quot;Bafana Bafana&quot;, in class 25 and all other classes.

===Home stadiums===

The South Africa national soccer team does not use a single stadium as its home stadium for matches. Instead, they use a variety of stadiums throughout South Africa to host matches.

The largest venue used is the 94,700-seater Soccer City in Soweto, outside Johannesburg. Other often used venues include the Atteridgeville Super Stadium, outside Pretoria, the Royal Bafokeng Stadium, outside Rustenburg, the Free State Stadium in Bloemfontein and Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban.

Matches have also been hosted at Ellis Park and Johannesburg Stadium in Johannesburg, Kings Park in Durban, Olympia Park in Rustenburg, Cape Town Stadium and Newlands Stadium in Cape Town, Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium and the EPRU Stadium in Port Elizabeth, Loftus Versfeld in Pretoria, Orlando Stadium in Soweto, Mbombela Stadium in Nelspruit, Peter Mokaba Stadium in Polokwane, Griqua Park in Kimberley, Jan Smuts Stadium and Buffalo City Stadium in East London, Odi Stadium in Mabopane, Mmabatho Stadium in Mafikeng, Atlantic Stadium in Witbank and Olen Park in Potchefstroom.

The team has also hosted matches outside of South Africa. In preparation for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, the team hosted a friendly in Baiersbronn, Germany. As a warm-up for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, the team hosted a friendly at Mong Kok Stadium in Hong Kong. In 2006 the team hosted a Nelson Mandela Challenge match at Griffin Park, in London, England. During their preparations for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, the team hosted two matches in Germany. The matches were played at the BRITA-Arena in Wiesbaden and the Stadion am Bieberer Berg in Offenbach am Main.

=== Kits and crest ===

Throughout the years, Bafana Bafana has employed multiple logos to represent the team. Notably, they often utilize two primary logos simultaneously on their jerseys.

==== Protea Emblem ====
The prominent Protea emblem, a national symbol of South Africa, particularly in the post-apartheid era, graces the right side of the jersey. This signifies the team&#x27;s connection to the broader South African sporting landscape.

==== South African Football Association (SAFA) Badge ====
Located on the left side of the jersey, the SAFA badge typically features a star above it, commemorating the team&#x27;s triumph in the 1996 Africa Cup of Nations.

==== Tertiary Emblem ====
A less frequently used yet noteworthy emblem was introduced approximately a decade ago. This distinctive logo depicts two stars embodied as footballers on the pitch, offering a symbolic representation of the team&#x27;s aspirations and achievements.

====Sponsors====
When the team returned to international soccer in 1992, their kit was supplied by an Italian clothing company, Kappa. The team wore Kappa kits up to and during the 1998 FIFA World Cup.

Following the 1998 World Cup, the kits for all South African national soccer teams were supplied by German sports apparel company Adidas. The sponsorship deal is believed to be worth Rs 14 million per year. Their contract with the South African Football Association ran until the end of 2010.

On 7 June 2011, SAFA announced Puma as its new technical sponsor and unveiled Bafana Bafana&#x27;s new kit.

In October 2013, ABSA announced its resignation as a sponsor of SAFA and the South African national team as of the end of their contract in December 2013. This was followed a week later by the announcement from Puma, that they too would step down as technical sponsors of Bafana Bafana.

From March 2014 until June 2020, the official kit provider was the American sporting apparel company Nike from the international friendly match against Brazil.

Since June 2020, the official kit provider has been French sporting apparel company Le Coq Sportif.

The team now has one main sponsor, Castle Lager, a brand owned by South African Breweries. Smaller sponsors and suppliers include Energade and Tsogo Sun Hotels.

In 2022, Banxso became the official online trading partner for the team.

===Media coverage===
The South African Football Association owns the rights to national team matches played in South Africa. SAFA currently has a contract with the South African Broadcasting Corporation, to broadcast these matches. It is up to the SABC to procure the rights to matches played outside of the country.

The SABC usually shows most national team games, though they have often had problems with broadcasting weekday matches. They have previously used delayed live footage, and sometimes not shown matches.

Most large tournaments in which the team play, such as the FIFA World Cup and Africa Cup of Nations, have separate broadcast rights. SuperSport purchase the pay TV rights to these tournaments, thus during these tournaments, they also show South African matches. The SABC usually holds the free to air rights to these tournaments, with the notable exception being the 2002 FIFA World Cup. Those matches were shown by e.tv.

===FIFA World Cup===
Although South Africa has made three appearances in the World Cup, they have not made it past the first round. The team&#x27;s first attempt to qualify was for the 1994 World Cup. The team finished second in their group, behind Nigeria, who went on to play at the World Cup.

Their first appearance was in France 1998, six years after they had been readmitted to FIFA. Despite a 3–0 drubbing to France in their opening game, they went on to draw against Denmark and Saudi Arabia; the team finished third and thus exited the tournament. Korea/Japan 2002 was expected to be an opportunity for &quot;Bafana Bafana&quot; to step up to the next level, but they were eliminated at the group stage despite drawing to Paraguay and beating Slovenia 1–0 for their first-ever World Cup win. The team finished third in their group, losing out to Paraguay on goal difference.

The team failed to qualify for the 2006 World Cup after finishing third in their qualifying group. Ghana won the group and progressed to the tournament, while Congo DR finished ahead of South Africa on head-to-head results. During the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, they beat France 2–1 and drew 1–1 to Mexico, but lost 0–3 to Uruguay. They failed to advance to the round of 16, on goal difference, for their second World Cup in a row and as the first host country to fail to advance past the group stage.

<doc id="1018603" wikidata="Q3487421" url="?curid=1018603" title="The Squire of Gothos">
<text>&quot;The Squire of Gothos&quot; is the 17th episode of the first season of the American science-fiction television series &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Written by Paul Schneider and directed by Don McDougall, it first aired on January 12, 1967.

In the episode, the childish but powerful ruler of the planet Gothos captures the crew of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; for his own amusement.

==Plot==
The USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;, under the command of Captain Kirk, is on an 8-day supply mission to Colony Beta VI. Passing through a &quot;star desert&quot;, the ship encounters a rogue planet previously hidden from their sensors.
As Lt. Sulu attempts to enter a course around the planet, he suddenly vanishes from the bridge, and Kirk vanishes a moment later.

First Officer Spock assumes that the two must have been taken to the planet, though sensor readings indicate the planet&#x27;s atmosphere is lethal to most forms of life. The &quot;Enterprise&quot; then receives a strange message on a viewscreen in blackletter writing: &quot;Greetings and Felicitations!&quot;, followed by &quot;Hip hip hoorah. Tallyho!&quot; Spock orders Chief Medical Officer Dr. McCoy, along with Lt. DeSalle and geophysicist Karl Jaeger, to form a landing party and conduct a search.

The landing party beams down and unexpectedly finds itself in a lush and breathable environment. They also come across what appears to be a medieval castle, within which they find Captain Kirk and Lt. Sulu, immobilized, along with a humanoid being who identifies himself as &quot;General Trelane, retired&quot;, and invites everyone to stay as his guests on his world, which he calls Gothos; he also explains that his hobby is studying Earth history and still [wrongly] believes Earth is engaging in world conquest. McCoy&#x27;s medical tricorder cannot detect this person as a living being.

Spock, meanwhile, manages to locate the landing party in a minute zone of breathable atmosphere, and beams everyone, except Trelane, back to the ship by locking onto every detectable lifeform in the area. Trelane, however, appears on the &quot;Enterprise&quot;″s bridge, and brings the entire bridge crew down to the planet, including Spock, Communications Officer Lt. Uhura, and Yeoman Teresa Ross. Trelane invites his &quot;guests&quot; to partake of his food (which tastes like straw) and his brandy (which tastes like water). Spock reasons that Trelane knows only the forms of earth history and not the substance; the equivalent of someone 900 light years away from earth who is studying earth history through a telescope but having no concept that 400 years have passed.

Kirk&#x27;s patience begins to wear thin, especially when Trelane dances with Yeoman Ross and changes her standard red uniform into an 18th-century ball gown. Kirk and Spock both notice that their host never strays far from a particular wall mirror; they surmise that the mirror is the source of his powers. To test this theory, Kirk provokes Trelane into a duel, and during the fight, he destroys the mirror and damages some strange machinery inside. The bridge crew then beams back to the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, but as the ship attempts to warp away, the planet Gothos keeps appearing in its path. Kirk finally orders the &quot;Enterprise&quot; into orbit and decides to beam down, alone.

On the planet, Kirk finds Trelane seated on a courtroom bench, dressed in the white wig and robes reminiscent of an English circuit judge. Trelane reads charges of &quot;treason&quot;, &quot;conspiracy&quot;, and &quot;fomenting insurrection&quot;, and then, silencing Kirk&#x27;s protests, condemns Kirk to death by hanging. Kirk, however, points out that Trelane could find a more stimulating alternative. Trelane suggests that Kirk be prey for a royal hunt, and Kirk agrees in return for the release of his ship. The hunt begins, and Kirk is eventually cornered at the castle entrance, but remains defiant – he slaps Trelane – tells him he has a lot to learn about life and breaks Trelane&#x27;s sword. Suddenly two energy beings appear and call out to Trelane, ordering him to &quot;come along&quot;, and lecturing him for his misbehavior. He then disappears, and the two beings follow after apologizing to Kirk, who returns to the ship.

==Production==

Writer Paul Schneider was inspired by seeing children play war, and originally intended the episode to be an antiwar statement.

Upon meeting Yeoman Ross, Trelane slightly misquotes Christopher Marlowe&#x27;s 16th-century play &quot; Doctor Faustus&quot;: &quot;Is this the face that launched a thousand ships, and burnt the topless towers of Ilium? Fair Helen, make me immortal with a kiss&quot;. The actual lines are: &quot;Was this the face that launch’d a thousand ships, And burnt the topless towers of Ilium? Sweet Helen, make me immortal with a kiss!&quot;

==Reception==
Zack Handlen of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; gave the episode an &#x27;A&#x27; rating, describing the episode as &quot;one of TOS&#x27;s most deservedly iconic hours&quot;, and noting it as &quot;wonderfully structured&quot;. William Campbell&#x27;s guest-star role was described as &quot;demanding, energetic, and endlessly delighted with himself.&quot; In 2012, they ranked it as one of top-10 &quot;must-see&quot; episodes of the original series.

In 2016, SyFy ranked guest star William Campbell&#x27;s performance as Trelane, as the fifth-best guest star on the original series.

In 2018, &quot;Collider&quot; ranked this episode the 17th-best original series episode.

In 2019, the &quot;Edmonton Journal&quot; ranked this as having one of the top 10 Spock character moments, pointing out his line &quot;I object to you. I object to intellect without discipline. I object to power without constructive purpose,&quot; in response to the Trelane alien.

In 2020, &quot;ScreenRant&quot; ranked it as the 14th-best episode of TOS to rewatch. They note how initially the crew is exposed to what appears to 18th-century technology on the planet, but is then tormented by Trelane, who possesses incredible powers. The character Trelane is reported to have inspired the character Q, who was presented in &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation.&quot; John de Lancie has stated in several interviews that his performance as Q was inspired by William Campbell&#x27;s depiction of Trelane.

==Continuity==

Kirk tells Trelane that he has been observing events that occurred on Earth 900 years earlier. Trelane mentions Napoleon (1769–1821), the Alexander Hamilton duel from 1804, and a Richard Strauss composition from 1880, and this has been interpreted as suggesting the episode was set in the 28th century at the earliest. However, later episodes and films placed &quot;Star Trek&quot; in the 23rd century.

==Non-canonical Star Trek media==
The similarity between Q and Trelane inspired writer Peter David to posit in his 1994 novel &quot;Q-Squared&quot; that Trelane is a member of the Q Continuum, and Q is his godfather. In the novel, the name &quot;Trelane&quot; originated due to an alternate version of the young Q-entity operating among three &quot;lanes&quot; of alternate timelines simultaneously.

Trelane appears in the 1993 video game &quot;Star Trek: Judgment Rites&quot; episode &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot;. The &quot;Enterprise&quot; is dispatched to search an area where several Federation starships have disappeared without explanation. When they arrive, Kirk and crew are confronted by Trelane, who now dresses and acts like a World War I German Fokker pilot and is revealed to have captured the missing ships using his powers so he can force them to participate in dogfights. After a battle with Trelane in his aircraft, Kirk and his crew are forced to once again match wits with the childish Baron in their hopes to rescue the ships.

<doc id="1018608" wikidata="Q922625" url="?curid=1018608" title="Checklist">
<text>Achecklist is a type of job aid used in repetitive tasks to reduce failure by compensating for potential limits of human memory and attention. Checklists are used both to ensure that safety-critical system preparations are carried out completely and in the correct order, and in less critical applications to ensure that no step is left out of a procedure. they help to ensure consistency and completeness in carrying out a task. A basic example is the &quot;to do list&quot;. A more advanced checklist would be a schedule, which lays out tasks to be done according to time of day or other factors, or a pre-flight checklist for an airliner, which should ensure a safe take-off. 

A primary function of a checklist is documentation of the task and auditing against the documentation. Use of a well designed checklist can reduce any tendency to avoid, omit or neglect important steps in any task. For efficiency and acceptance, the checklist should easily readable, include only necessary checks, and be as short as reasonably practicable.

== History ==
It is widely accepted that checklists appeared after the crash of the Boeing B-17 plane on October 30, 1935. Possibly, the source of such common knowledge is The Checklist Manifesto book by Atul Gawande. However, the Oxford English Dictionary states that the word appeared in 1853.

The earliest discovered evidence of the “check-list” usage is seen in the “Journal of the House of Representatives of the State of New Hampshire at Their Session Holden at the Capitol in Concord” issued in 1841 and describing the elections-related events of the autumn of 1840.

==Purpose==
In general, a checklist is a quality management tool, an aid to completing a complex task correctly and completely. It is an aid to recall, provides a reminder of the correct sequence, and uses the operator&#x27;s knowledge and skill efficiently to ensure that no critical steps are omitted, even when the operator is under stress or has degraded attention due to fatigue or other distractions, It allows cross checking, keeps team members informed of the status of readiness, and can provide a legal record of a sequence of events to indicate due diligence. It differs from an instruction manual or operating manual in that it does not normally provide details on how to perform the steps, as it assumes that the operator is competent and familiar with each step.

==Applications==

Checklists are used both to ensure that safety-critical system preparations are carried out completely and in the correct order, and in less critical applications to ensure that no step is left out of a procedure, or that all components have been accounted for, or as a means of recording biodiversity.

===Safety critical systems===
Checklists are used to help avoid accidental omission of important preparation of equipment and systems. These may be routine operations like pre-flight checks on an airliner or relatively infrequent occasions like commissioning a nuclear power station or launching a spacecraft. The value of checklists is proportional to the complexity of the system and the consequences of a system failure. They may also aid in mitigating claims of negligence in public liability claims by providing evidence of a risk management system being in place. A signed off checklist with a document describing the listed checks may be accepted as evidence of due diligence. Conversely, the absence of a mandatory checklist may be considered evidence of negligence.

====Aviation and space flight safety====
Checklists have long been a feature of aviation safety to ensure that critical items are not overlooked. The best known example is the cockpit preflight checklist, which is intended to ensure that the crew correctly configures the aircraft for flight on every flight. A normal checklist is used before critical flight segments, such as takeoff, approach and landing, which are the phases in which the highest incidence of accidents occur due to procedural error. Checklists are also used for troubleshooting, to identify and where practicable, correct malfunctions. They cannot substitute for pilot skill and learned and practiced immediate response to critical malfunctions, but are useful for mitigation attempts when time allows.

====Health care====
In health care, particularly surgery, checklists may be used to ensure that the correct procedure is carried out on each patient. Checklists have been used in healthcare practice to ensure that clinical practice guidelines are followed. An example is the WHO Surgical Safety Checklist developed for the World Health Organization and found to have a large effect on improving patient safety. According to a meta-analysis after introduction of the checklist mortality dropped by 23% and all complications by 40%, but higher-quality studies are required to make the meta-analysis more robust. Checklist use in healthcare has not always met with success and transferability between settings has been questioned. A survey found them to have no statistical effect in a cohort of hospitals in the Province of Ontario in Canada. In the UK, a study on the implementation of a checklist for provision of medical care to elderly patients admitting to hospital found that the checklist highlighted limitations with frailty assessment in acute care and motivated teams to review routine practices, but that work is needed to understand whether and how checklists can be embedded in complex multidisciplinary care.

====Underwater diving====
In professional diving, checklists are used in the preparation of equipment for a dive, and to ensure that the diver and life support systems are fully prepared before they enter the water. To a lesser extent, checklists are used by a minority of recreational divers, and by a larger proportion of technical divers during pre-dive checks. Studies have shown checklists to be effective at reducing the number of errors and consequent incidents.

===Quality assurance applications===
* Used in quality assurance of software engineering, to check process compliance, code standardization and error prevention, and others.
* Often used in industry in operations procedures
* In civil litigation to deal with the complexity of discovery and motions practice. An example is the open-source litigation checklist.
* Used by some investors as a critical part of their investment process,
* The creation of emergency survival kits, first aid kits and other collections of diverse apparatus, to ensure that the set is complete.
* Janitorial checklists are used for quality control.
* Digital checklists are used in quality control.

===For information===
* An ornithological checklist (:Category:Ornithological checklists), a list of birds with standardized names that helps ornithologists communicate with the public without the use of Latinised scientific names.
* A biodiversity checklist is a list of organisms recorded from a given geographical region or taxon. These include worldwide lists indicating the continued existence of species within specified taxa, and are also used to record the species found in countries, bioregions, or specific protected areas. They may be a form of database.
* A popular tool for tracking sports card collections. Randomly inserted in packs, checklist cards provide information on the contents of sports card set.

==Effectiveness of checklists==
Ranapurwala et al. (2017) found: 

Characteristics of effective checklists include:
* Checklists should be simple and convenient to use. Each listed item should be necessary and together they should be sufficient.
* Checklists focused on the responsibilities of a specific person, or a group who will work together, are less likely to have items left out. 
* Grouping items which can be done at the same time or place, or by the same person, often improves efficiency.
** A group may have a checkbox to indicate completion of the group. This is more likely to be helpful if there are several groups.
* Where reasonably practicable the items to be checked by a specific person can be grouped on the list. This makes it easier for them to keep track of what they have done and must still do. In some cases it may help to split them off as a separate checklist.
* Items should not be over-detailed in description nor ambiguous. A checklist should not try to define or describe procedures which should be familiar to the checker, though critical steps may usefully be listed in order when order is important. 
* Ordering of the list should be logical. Where chronological order is important, it should be indicated by order on the list. Where items to be checked are spatially distributed, an order minimising travel or search time is efficient.
* The most convenient and reliable checklists are normally completed from top to bottom in a single session. It should be easy to recover from any interruption without risking missing an item or redoing a check unnecessarily.
* The physical checklist must be convenient to use on site. It should not require special effort to read, or protect it from the environment.
* It may be useful to cross-reference the checklist to the standard procedure, where the process is definitively described in detail, particularly for training and audit purposes. This makes it easy to check if there is any doubt.
* Some checklists must be signed off and kept as evidence, others may be re-usable. This may affect the format and materials.
* Checkboxes at the beginning of each item are easier to find and follow to the next incomplete check. A keyword at the beginning of the text will help ensure that the correct box is ticked.
* When several checklists are used, due to complexity of the task, or the need for several people to make checks at different places, a master checklist indicating the completion of each subordinate checklist may be used.
* If instructions are necessary, they should be included. If not, they should be left out as they will distract the user.

==Types==
* Lists of actions for standard procedures, in which details are provided for each step.
* Lists of actions for standard procedures, in which no or very little detail is provided for each step on the assumption that the operator is entirely familiar with each step, and the checklist is used to ensure that no steps are omitted, or the preferred order is followed
* Project coordination lists, which specify who is responsible for each part of the project.
* Troubleshooting checklists, which may have multiple branches for diagnosis, or a series of procedures for responding to an emergency
* Checklists to increase objectivity in decision-making, to reduce emotional influences.
* Lists of things to be done over a specified period.

== Design ==
The design of a checklist should fit the purpose of the list. If a checklist is perceived as a top-down means to control behaviour by the organisational hierarchy it is more likely to be rejected and fail in its purpose. A checklist perceived as helping the operator to save time and reduce error is likely to be better accepted. This is more likely to happen when the user is involved in the development of the checklist. 

Rae et al. (2018) define &quot;safety clutter&quot; as &quot;the accumulation and persistence of &#x27;safety&#x27; work that does not contribute to operational safety&quot;, and state that &quot;when &#x27;safety&#x27; rules impose a significant and unnecessary burden on the performance of everyday activities, both work and safety suffer&quot;.

An objective in checklist design that it should promote a positive attitude towards the use of the checklist by the operators. For this to happen it must be realistic, convenient and not be regarded as a nuisance. A checklist should be designed to describe and facilitate a physical procedure that is accepted by the operators as necessary, effective, efficient and convenient.

===Mode of use===
A checklist may be used to identify the action, after which it is done, then checked off as complete and the next item identified, known as the &quot;read–do&quot;, &quot;do–list&quot; or &quot;call–do–response&quot; process, or the tasks may be done, and then the checklist consulted to ensure that nothing has been left out, the &quot;do–confirm&quot; procedure, in which the status of tasks must be remembered until checked off, which may result in more errors, or &quot;challenge, verification, and response&quot; process, in which the checklist is used after the tasks have been completed. Both methods have merit and suitable applications, and the most suitable type of checklist will depend on the type of operation.

In the &quot;call–do–response&quot; system, the checklist is used to lead the operators through a step-by-step procedure where one operator directs the others, following the list. Each item requiring configuration is listed on the checklist and all relevant operators must be present while the checks are done. This method tends to be more detailed and time-consuming. It may be more appropriate for systems which are less familiar to the operators.

In the &quot;challenge–verification–response&quot;, the operators prepare the system following a standard sequence of actions performed from memory, then use the checklist to verify that the critical items have been correctly configured. One operator reads the challenge part of the checklist, the designated parties verify the status, and one of them provides the appropriate response. This is done in sequence until the list is complete. It may be ticked or signed off as specified. This method is efficient, as each operator can get on with their checks and then when the checklist is run through, all the relevant crew are updated on the system status.

===Physical characteristics===
Physical characteristics are things such as the actual size of the document, contrast, colour, and typography. The main factors in typography are legibility of text and readability in the conditions in which the document is expected to be used.

Legibility of text involves the selection of characters to enable the reader to identify them quickly and positively discriminate them from other characters. Readability is the quality of the word or text which allows rapid recognition of single words, word groups, abbreviations, and symbols.

Thousands of fonts are available, in two major groups: Roman (with serifs) and sans-serif. Research has shown that sans-serif is more legible than Roman as the absence of serifs presents simple and clean typeface. Arial or Helvetica are preferred.

The consensus of researchers is that lowercase is more legible because the pattern of the whole word is more familiar, and the pattern of ascenders and descenders is helpful for recognition. The occasional use of uppercase words for emphasis or in acronyms is acceptable, particularly where this is the common usage.

Font size is important for readability, especially for older operators. A font size between 14 and 20 points is recommended for reasonably well illuminated situations. Font size less than 10 points is not recommended. Checklists for use in poorly illuminated conditions should use a larger font for improved readability. Black text on a white background is generally preferred for best contrast, though in some cases a yellow background is acceptable.

Other factors influencing readability and reducing error include both horizontal and vertical character spacing, stroke width and character height to width ratio, and line length. Italics reduce readability of large areas of text but are acceptable for emphasis of a few words. Bolding does not affect readability significantly, but is useful for emphasis, and is best used with discretion. The use of multiple type faces in body text can be confusing and significantly reduces readability, so should be avoided. Contrast is more useful than colour to provide visibility of characters. White on black can be useful if dark adaptation must be preserved, but is not optimum when illumination is good. If checklists are plastic laminated, an anti-glare finish should be used to prevent disruption by highlights. Opacity of the paper is important if printed on both sides or there is a possibility of backlighting.

===Content and layout===
The workload and time available should be considered. Each listed item should be necessary and together they should be sufficient. Only necessary instructions should be included. A checklist should be as brief as possible without compromising clarity. Items should not be over-detailed in description nor ambiguous. A checklist should not try to define or describe procedures which should be familiar to the checker, though critical steps may usefully be listed in order when order is important. Numbering the items usually helps with place-keeping. It may be useful to cross-reference the checklist to the standard procedure document, where the process is definitively described in detail, particularly for training and audit purposes. This makes it easy to check if there is any doubt, but does not distract the user. Version number and date may be required to ensure that the current authorised version is in use. 

Ordering of the list should be logical. Where chronological order is important, it should be indicated by order on the list. The most convenient and reliable checklists are normally completed from top to bottom in a single session. It should be easy to recover from any interruption without risking missing an item or redoing a check unnecessarily. Grouping items which can be done at the same time or place, or by the same person, often improves efficiency. Where items to be checked are spatially distributed, an order minimising travel or search time is efficient.

Checkboxes at the beginning of each item are easier to find and follow to the next incomplete check. A keyword at the beginning of the text will help ensure that the correct box is ticked.

===Format===

Checklists are often presented as lists with small checkboxes down the left hand side of the page. A small tick or checkmark is drawn in the box after the item has been completed. If practicable a check should not be split over two pages.

Other formats are also sometimes used. Aviation checklists generally consist of a system and an action divided by a dashed line, and lack a checkbox as they are often read aloud and are usually intended to be reused.

Some checklists must be signed off and kept as evidence, others may be re-usable. This may affect the format and materials.

===Errors===
Long or confusing items, an inconvenient order, or any other characteristic that causes the users to perceive it as an obstacle will increase the chances that when constrained for time, the operators will revert to alternative methods, omit items or disregard the checklist entirely.
Error conditions that may occur include:
* Using the wrong checklist. 
* Difficulty in finding the right checklist. 
* Difficulty in confirming that the checklist is the right one for the situation. 
* Losing track of where one is in the checklist. 
* Missing a step or not completing a step after an interruption. 
* Misunderstanding the action required by the checklist. 
* Difficulty in confirming that an action required by the checklist was done correctly. 
* Difficulty in finding the next step after a conditional statement. 
* Difficulty in reading a checklist. 
* Lack of clarity about who should carry out a checklist action. 
* Failing to complete the checklist.

===History===
During the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) hearings into the crash of Northwest Airlines Flight 255, human factors specialist Earl Weiner testified that he &quot;did not know of any human factors research on how a checklist should be designed&quot;. NASA research into the matter concluded that as of 1989, there was basically no human factors research available anywhere specific to aircraft checklists.

The NTSB recommended that the FAA investigate ways of presenting checklists that produce better performance. The Safety Board also recommended that the FAA should specify typography criteria for checklists for commercial operators. Researchers found problems with both the physical design and social issues associated with the use of checklists which degrades effective use. Two documents were produced by NASA, and . This was followed by a document from the UK CAA: &quot;CAP 676: Guidance on the Design, Presentation, and Use of Emergency and Abnormal Checklist&quot;.

==Use==
Excessive dependence of checklists may hinder performance when dealing with a time-critical situation, for example a medical emergency or an in-flight emergency. Checklists should not be used as a replacement for common sense or necessary skill. Intensive training including rote-learning of checklists can help integrate use of checklists with more adaptive and flexible problem solving techniques.

Experimental work has shown that memorised checklists are less effective than written checklists in identifying unsafe conditions when time is not critical.

<doc id="1018610" wikidata="Q496812" url="?curid=1018610" title="Leukopenia">
<text>Leukopenia () is a decrease in the number of leukocytes (WBC). Found in the blood, they are the white blood cells, and are the body&#x27;s primary defense against an infection. Thus the condition of leukopenia places individuals at increased risk of infection.

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms may include:
* skin or mouth ulcers
* sore throat
* cough
* difficulty in breathing
* light-headedness
* fever
* chills
* body aches

===Leukopenia vs. neutropenia===
Neutropenia, a subtype of leukopenia, refers to a decrease in the number of circulating neutrophil granulocytes, the most abundant white blood cells. The terms &quot;leukopenia&quot; and &quot;neutropenia&quot; may occasionally be used interchangeably, as the neutrophil count is the most important indicator of infection risk. Agranulocytosis is an acute form of neutropenia.

==Causes==
===Medical conditions===
Low white cell count may be due to acute viral infections, such as a cold or influenza. It has been associated with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, myelofibrosis, aplastic anemia (failure of white cell, red cell and platelet production), stem cell transplant, bone marrow transplant, HIV, AIDS, and steroid use.

Other causes of low white blood cell count include systemic lupus erythematosus, Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma, some types of cancer, typhoid, malaria, tuberculosis, dengue, rickettsial infections, enlargement of the spleen, folate deficiencies, psittacosis, sepsis, Sjögren syndrome and Lyme disease. It has also been shown to be caused by deficiency in certain minerals, such as copper and zinc.

Pseudoleukopenia can develop upon the onset of infection. The leukocytes (primarily neutrophils, responding to injury first) start migrating toward the site of infection, where they can be scanned. Their migration causes bone marrow to produce more WBCs to combat infection as well as to restore the leukocytes in circulation, but as the blood sample is taken upon the onset of infection, it contains low amount of WBCs, which is why it is termed &quot;pseudoleukopenia&quot;.

===Medications===
Certain medications can alter the number and function of white blood cells.

Medications that can cause leukopenia include clozapine, an antipsychotic medication with a rare adverse effect leading to the total absence of all granulocytes (neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils). Minocycline, a commonly prescribed antibiotic, is another drug known to cause leukopenia. There are also reports of leukopenia caused by divalproex sodium or valproic acid (Depakote), a drug used for epilepsy (seizures), mania (with bipolar disorder) and migraine.

The anticonvulsant drug, lamotrigine, has been associated with a decrease in white blood cell count.

The FDA monograph for metronidazole states that this medication can also cause leukopenia, and the prescriber information suggests a complete blood count, including differential cell count, before and after, in particular, high-dose therapy.

Immunosuppressive drugs, such as sirolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, ciclosporin, leflunomide and TNF inhibitors, have leukopenia as a known complication. Interferons used to treat multiple sclerosis, such as interferon beta-1a and interferon beta-1b, can also cause leukopenia.

Chemotherapy targets cells that grow rapidly, such as tumors, but can also affect white blood cells, because they are characterized by bone marrow as rapid growing. A common side effect of cancer treatment is neutropenia, the lowering of neutrophils (a specific type of white blood cell).

Decreased white blood cell count may be present in cases of arsenic toxicity.

==Diagnosis==
Leukopenia can be identified with a complete blood count.

Below are blood reference ranges for various types leucocytes/WBCs. The 2.5 percentile (right limits in intervals in image, showing 95% prediction intervals) is a common limit for defining leukocytosis.

<doc id="1018614" wikidata="Q2661314" url="?curid=1018614" title="Tool-assisted speedrun">
<text>A tool-assisted speedrun or tool-assisted superplay (TAS; ) is generally defined as a speedrun or playthrough composed of precise inputs recorded with tools such as video game emulators. Tool-assisted speedruns are generally created with the goal of creating theoretically perfect playthroughs. This may include the fastest possible route to complete a game or showcasing new optimizations to existing world records.

TAS requires research into the theoretical limits of the games and their respective competitive categories. The fastest categories have no restrictions and often involve a level of gameplay impractical or impossible for a human player, and those made according to real-time attack rules serve to research the limits of human players.

The TAS developer has full control over the game&#x27;s movement, per video frame, to record a sequence of fully precise inputs. Other tools include save states and branches, rewriting recorded inputs, splicing together best sequences, macros, and scripts to automate gameplay actions. These tools grant TAS creators precision and accuracy beyond a human player.

==History==
The term was coined during early &quot;Doom&quot; speedrunning. When Andy &quot;Aurican&quot; Kempling released a modified version of the &quot;Doom&quot; source code that made it possible to record demos in slow motion and in several sessions, it was possible for the first players to start recording tool-assisted demos. In a few months, in June 1999, Finnish Esko Koskimaa, Swedish Peo Sjöblom, and Israeli Yonatan Donner opened the first site to share these demos, &quot;Tools-Assisted Speedruns&quot;.

In 2003, a video of a Japanese player named Morimoto completing the NES game &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; in 11 minutes and performing stunts started floating around the Internet. The video was controversial, because not many people knew about tool-assisted speedruns, especially for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The video was not clearly labeled as such, so many people considered an emulator cheating. It inspired Joel &quot;Bisqwit&quot; Yliluoma to start the NESvideos website for TAS for the NES, and it was renamed TASVideos.

Tool-assisted speedruns have been made for some ROM hacks and for published games. In 2014, the speedrunning application TASBot was developed, capable of direct controller input.

==Method==
Creating a tool-assisted speedrun is the process of finding the optimal set of inputs to fulfill a given criterion — usually completing a game as fast as possible. No limits are imposed on the tools used for this search, but the result has to be a set of timed key-presses that, when played back on the actual console, achieves the target criterion. The basic method used to construct such a set of inputs is to record one&#x27;s input while playing the game on an emulator, all the while saving and loading the emulator&#x27;s state repeatedly to test out various possibilities and only keep the best result. To make this more precise, the game is slowed down. Initially, it was common to slow down to some low fraction of normal speed. However, due to advances in the field, it is now expected that the game is paused during recording, with emulation advanced one frame at a time to eliminate any mistakes made due to the urgency.

The use of savestates facilitates luck manipulation, which uses player input as entropy to make favorable outcomes. Examples include making the ideal piece drop in &quot;Tetris&quot;, or getting a rare item drop from a defeated enemy.

===Re-recording emulators===
Tool-assisted speedrunning relies on the same series of inputs being played back at different times always giving the same results. The emulation must be deterministic with regard to the saved inputs, and random seeds must not change. Otherwise, a speedrun that was optimal on one playback might not even complete it on a second playback. This desynchronization occurs when the state of the emulated machine at a particular time index no longer corresponds with that which existed at the same point in the movie&#x27;s production. Desyncs can also be caused by incomplete savestates, which cause the emulated machine to be restored in a state different from that which existed when it was saved. Desyncs can also occur when a user attempts to match inputs from an input file downloaded from TASVideos and fail to match the correct enemy reactions due to bad AI or RNG.

===Verification===
Some players have fraudulently recorded speedruns, either by creating montages of other speedrun or altering the playing time, posting them as TAS or RTA. Because tool-assisted speedruns can account for all aspects of the game code, including its inner workings, and press buttons precisely and accurately, they can be used to help verify whether an unassisted speedrun record is legitimate.

One of the best-known cases is Billy Mitchell, whose &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; and &quot;Pac-Man&quot; Guinness records were revoked in 2018, because he used the emulator MAME.

In 2018, the world record for Dragster by Todd Rogers was removed from Twin Galaxies and Guinness records after an experiment showed that his 5.51 second time was impossible to achieve even with a TAS.

==Examples==
In &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;, the current Famicom and NES human-theory world record, created by Maru, stands at 4:57.54 (4:54.265 in RTA timing). In &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot;, arbitrary code execution along with credits warp allows injecting a hack that simulates a Unix-like console, providing extra features to Mario. The current TAS standing at 216 milliseconds (13 frames) was performed by exploiting a small bug with the Famicom and NES hardware in which the CPU makes many extra &quot;read&quot; requests from one of the controller inputs, registering many more button presses than have occurred; the A button is mashed at a rate of 8 kilohertz (8000 times per second), performing the credits warp glitch. In &quot;Super Mario World&quot;, arbitrary code execution allows injection of playable versions of &quot;Flappy Bird&quot;, &quot;Pong&quot;, &quot;Snake&quot;, and &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;

<text>A cost centre is a department within a business to which costs can be allocated. The term includes departments which do not produce directly but they incur costs to the business, when the manager and employees of the cost centre are not accountable for the profitability and investment decisions of the business but they are responsible for some of its costs.

==Types==
There are two main types of cost centres:
* Production cost centres, where the products are manufactured or processed. Example of this is an assembly area.
* Service cost centres, where services are provided to other business units or other cost centres. Example of this is the personnel department or the canteen.

==Examples ==
* Marketing department
* Human resources
* Research and development
* Work office
* Quality assurance
* Engineering
* Logistics
* Procurement
Cost centres can be trimmed down to the smallest segregated tasks within Departments. It is not necessary to consider departments as outright cost centres. Some companies adopt a different approach when treating cost centres.

== Function-specific cost ==
The main function of a cost centre is the tracing of all expenses linked with a certain function. For example, by considering a call centre as an independent unit, the firm can calculate how much it is spending each year for its call centre support service. If a cost centre is not considered independent then it would take a lot of effort in measuring the cost of providing this service because it will include dividing up the company&#x27;s entire personnel and phone bills by department each month.

==Benefits==
There are numerous benefits of a cost centre which include:
* Monitoring efficiency – Cost centres are beneficial as they allow the effectiveness of all aspects within a company to be monitored closely.
* Employee confidence – The delegation of authority that takes place when making employees accountable for cost centre is a way to improve confidence.
* Loss prevention – Cost centres try to update processes, be more effective and save money so that they can reduce the expenses. Cost centres try to cover all of their costs with offsetting revenue by reducing expenses and producing unpredicted revenue, thus preventing loss.
* Increasing profit – If one of the cost centres is removed from a firm then it has a negative impact on the profit margin of that firm. For example, if an HR department was removed then basic employment functions and essential business processes cannot be performed which will affect the firm&#x27;s profit negatively.
* Management efficiency – Managers compare cost data from different time periods in order to see whether the cost centre is becoming more or less profitable. Generally a specific person (a cost centre manager) is held accountable for costs incurring in the cost centre under his or her control, in which case, collecting and comparing costs may motivate the manager to be more productive.

==Drawbacks==
There are a few drawbacks of cost centre which include:
* Negative effects on other departments – although the cost of operating a specific department is simple to calculate, cost centres are a source of encouragement for managers to underfund their elements so that it can benefit the cost centre, which can have a harmful effect on other departments within the firm.
* Hard to monitor efficiency – It is hard to keep a track of how efficient these centres are.
* Profit can not be controlled – Divisional performance can only be evaluated in terms of cost because profit is not in control of the manager.
* Efficiency and productivity cannot be assessed properly – in a cost centre, the result of a decision is calculated by cost alone; the achievements of the cost centre are not measured in financial terms, therefore it is hard to assess efficiency and productivity properly.

== Difference between a cost centre and a profit centre ==
A cost centre adds to a firm&#x27;s cost whereas a profit centre adds to the firm&#x27;s cost and profit. Furthermore, the main objective of a cost centre is to minimise cost whereas the main objective of a profit centre is to maximise profit. Profit centres provide a wider and more general measurement of performance than the cost centre. In cost centre, the manager is only responsible for the cost whereas in a profit centre, the manager is responsible for cost and profit. In situations like this when manager is responsible for both, profit and cost, the contribution of each manager to the goal of the firm becomes easier to measure.

<text>Bertha Wernham Wilson (September 18, 1923April 28, 2007) was a Canadian jurist and the first female puisne justice of the Supreme Court of Canada. Before her ascension to Canada&#x27;s highest court, she was the first female associate and partner at Osler, Hoskin &amp; Harcourt and the first woman appointed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario. During her time at Osler, she created the first in-firm research department in the Canadian legal industry.

==Early life==
Wilson was born in Kirkcaldy, Scotland, on September 18, 1923. She was the daughter of Archibald Wernham and Christina Noble. Wilson received a Master of Arts degree in philosophy from the University of Aberdeen in 1944. In 1949, Bertha Wilson emigrated to Canada with her husband, Reverend John Wilson, a Presbyterian minister, whom she had married in 1945. The couple settled in Renfrew, Ontario, after John Wilson accepted a posting as a pastor. Bertha Wilson had personally felt quite small in her space, and had always dreamed in pursuit of philosophy. Three years later, in 1952, her husband became a naval chaplain during the Korean War, and she worked as a dental receptionist in Ottawa. In 1954, her husband was posted to Halifax, Nova Scotia and they both moved.

==Legal career==

In 1955, Wilson was admitted to Dalhousie University to study law, and three years later she completed her Bachelor of Laws degree (LLB), and was called to the bar of Nova Scotia. Wilson applied for and was accepted into a Master of Laws program at Harvard Law School, but chose not to attend. Wilson moved to Toronto and joined Osler, Hoskin &amp; Harcourt in 1958, a year before she was called to the bar of Ontario, where she later became the firm&#x27;s first female associate. In 1968, Wilson became Osler&#x27;s first female partner. She founded the research department at Osler, which was the first of its kind in Canada, becoming a model for other research departments.

Wilson was the first woman appointed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario in 1975. In March, 1982, she became the first woman appointed to the Supreme Court of Canada, nominated by Pierre Trudeau. Wilson retired from the court in January, 1991, and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada, and in 1992, she was named Companion of the Order of Canada.

Wilson&#x27;s noteworthy Supreme Court rulings include &quot;R v Morgentaler&quot; in 1988 (opinion striking down abortion law), &quot;R v Lavallée&quot; in 1990 (battered-wife syndrome as self-defence), &quot;Operation Dismantle v R&quot; in 1985 (judicial review), the minority decision in &quot;R v Stevens&quot; (1988) which was adopted later in &quot;R v Hess; R v Nguyen&quot; in 1990 (&quot;mens rea&quot; and statutory rape), &quot;Kosmopoulos v Constitution Insurance Co of Canada&quot; (piercing the &quot;corporate veil&quot;), the dissenting opinion in &quot;McKinney v University of Guelph&quot; in 1990 (mandatory retirement), &quot;Andrews v Law Society of British Columbia&quot; in 1989 (equality rights test), and &quot;Sobeys Stores Ltd v Yeomans&quot; in 1989 (interpretative authority of tribunals) which are among the foundational cases interpreting the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot; that was enacted in 1982, the year that she was appointed to the Supreme Court.

==Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples==
From 1991 to 1996, Wilson was a Commissioner of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples (RCAP). She gave a controversial and much-discussed speech about the role and influence of women in legal professions and the judiciary, titled &quot;Will Women Judges Really Make a Difference?&quot;

==Death==
Wilson developed Alzheimer&#x27;s disease later in life and died in an Ottawa, Ontario, retirement home on April 28, 2007, at the age of 83.

<text>The South Korea national football team (; recognized as Korea Republic by FIFA) represents South Korea in men&#x27;s international football and is governed by the Korea Football Association, a member of FIFA and the Asian Football Confederation (AFC).

South Korea has emerged as a major football power in Asia since the 1980s, having participated in ten consecutive and eleven overall FIFA World Cup tournaments, the most for any Asian country. Despite initially going through five World Cup tournaments without winning a match, South Korea became the first (and so far only) Asian team to reach the semi-finals when they co-hosted the 2002 tournament with Japan. South Korea also has won two AFC Asian Cup titles, and finished as runners-up on four occasions. Furthermore, the team won three gold medals and three silver medals at the senior Asian Games.

The team is commonly nicknamed the &quot;Reds&quot; by both fans and the media due to the color of their primary kit. The national team&#x27;s supporting group is officially referred to as the Red Devils.

==History==

==Team image==
===Nicknames===
The South Korea national football team has been known or nicknamed as the &quot;Taegeuk Warriors&quot; () and the &quot;Tigers of Asia&quot; ().

===Kits and crest===

Red is the traditional shirt color of the South Korean national team, who are consequently nicknamed the &quot;Reds&quot;, while the fans are called the &quot;Red Devils&quot;. The away shirt has varied between white and blue. In 1994, the home shirt shifted from red to white, but in October 1995, red returned as the home color, paired with black shorts.

South Korea used to wear the country&#x27;s flag as their shirt badge until 2001, when their tiger crest was unveiled. On 5 February 2020, the KFA announced a new, more simplistic logo. The emblem retained the tiger, albeit in a more minimalist design, enclosed in a rectangular frame. Red, blue and white, South Korea&#x27;s traditional colors, have been maintained in the new logo.

===Home stadium===

The South Korea national team played their first home match at the Dongdaemun Stadium on 21 April 1956. The match was a qualifier for the 1956 AFC Asian Cup against the Philippines. They currently play their home matches at several stadiums, which are also used by K League clubs.

===Rivalries===

South Korea&#x27;s biggest rival is Japan. The rivalry is an extension of a competitive rivalry between the two nations that goes beyond football, and some matches in the past have been tainted with controversy. South Korea leads the all-time series with 42 wins, 23 draws and 16 losses.

A rivalry has also developed with Iran. The two nations have played against each other officially since 1958, totalling 33 matches as of March 2022, including eleven World Cup qualifiers. South Korea and Iran were among the strongest Asian national teams during the 1960s and 1970s. Although the teams played against each other only once in the final match of the Asian Cup, in 1972, they have faced each other five consecutive times in the quarter-finals between 1996 and 2011, with each team recording two wins, two losses, and a draw. Iran leads the all-time series with 13 wins, 10 draws and 10 losses.

Another major rival is Australia. In head-to-head matches, each team achieved 9 wins in 29 encounters, and 11 matches ended in a draw. The two countries have also met in four matches at the Asian Cup, including the 2015 final, where Australia won 2–1 after extra time for their first ever Asian championship.

South Korea has had great success against China, as China failed to beat them in competitive matches for 32 years before finally winning in 2010. They also possess a strong rivalry with North Korea, though matches are infrequent due to diplomatic and security reasons.

===Supporters===

The official supporter group of the national team, the Red Devils, were founded in 1995. Known for their passionate support, they are commonly referred to as the 12th man. Their most common chant is (), followed by five claps.

The FIFA Fan Fest was introduced at the 2002 World Cup in South Korea.

<text>The 1st Armoured Division is an armoured division of the Indian Army, headquartered at Patiala, Punjab. It is part of II Corps of the Indian Army&#x27;s Western Command.

==Formation==
The division was formed when the 31st Indian Armoured Division was re-designated on 1 September 1945.

The 1st Armoured Division was one of two divisional headquarters transferred from the British Indian Army to the Indian Army upon the partition of British India in August 1947. At the time, it had its divisional headquarters at Secunderabad and the 43rd Lorried Infantry Brigade away with the Punjab Boundary Force. In June 1946, the wartime 255th Indian Tank Brigade was redesignated as 1st Armoured Brigade and assigned to 1st Armoured Division.

The division played a major role in Operation Polo, the integration of Hyderabad into the Indian Union in 1948. During this time Major General Joyanto Nath Chaudhuri was serving as the division&#x27;s commander, also serving as Military Governor of the state in the immediate aftermath of the invasion. For the Hyderabad operation, the division controlled the 1st Armoured Brigade and the 7th and 9th Infantry Brigades.

The order of battle (ORBAT) for the division was as follows-

Strike Force
*9 Dogra 
*Skinner&#x27;s Horse (minus one squadron) 
*1 troop Division HQ Squadron
*Battery 1 Field Regiment (Self Propelled)
*1 Forward Air Control team

Smash Force - 1 Armoured Brigade (Brigadier S.D Verma)
*3 Cavalry (minus one squadron) 
*17 Horse (minus one squadron) 
*One troop Skinner&#x27;s Horse
*1 Field Regiment (Self Propelled) (less one battery) 
*2nd Battery 40 Medium Regiment

*2 Sikh
*3 Grenadiers
*14 Rajput
*9 Para Field Regiment

Vir Force - 9 Infantry Brigade (Brigadier Apji Randhir Singh)
*3 Punjab
*2/1 Gorkha Rifles
*34 Anti Tank Regiment

==Indo-Pakistani War of 1965==

The 1st Armoured Division with Major General Rajinder Singh &#x27;Sparrow&#x27; as the GOC played an important role in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965. He was awarded the Mahavir Chakra for his role during the war.

The division was part of the I Corps on the western front. The order of battle was as follows-

1 Armoured Division (Major General Rajinder Singh)
*1 Armoured Brigade (Brigadier Khem Karan Singh)
**17 Horse
**16 Light Cavalry
**62 Cavalry (was also part of other formations)
*43 Lorried Infantry Brigade (Brigadier HS Dhillon)
**2 Lancers
**8 Garhwal Rifles

**116 Infantry Brigade (from 9 to 12 September 1965)
**58 Infantry Brigade (from 12 to 16 September 1965)

The major battles fought by the division include the Battle of Phillora and the Battle of Chawinda. At the time of the cease-fire, 1 Corps held around 500 square kilometres of Pakistani territory and had caused substantial damage to the enemy armour. Lieutenant Colonel A B Tarapore, 17 Horse was posthumously awarded the Param Vir Chakra, Major General Rajinder Singh, GOC, 1 Armoured Division, Brig KK Singh, Commander 1 Armoured Brigade, Lieutenant Colonel MMS Bakshi, Commandant 4 Horse, and Major Bhupinder Singh, 4 Horse were awarded the Maha Vir Chakra.

==Indo-Pakistani War of 1971==

The division was under the XI Corps, but did not see action. The order of battle (ORBAT) for the division was as follows-

1 Armoured Division (Major General Gurbachan Singh)
*93 Independent Reconnaissance Squadron (from 65 Armoured Regiment)
*1 Armoured Brigade (Brigadier N.S. Cheema)
**2 Lancers
**65 Armoured Regiment
**67 Armoured Regiment
**68 Armoured Regiment
(all equipped with Vijayanta tanks)
*43 Lorried Infantry Brigade (Brigadier Ramesh Chandra)
**1 Madras

==The Present==
Following the 1971 Indo-Pakistani war, the division was re-organised with the 1st and 43rd Armoured Brigades and relocated in 1972 to Ambala. In 1984, it was reorganized with the 1st, 43rd and 98th Armoured Brigades. At present, the Divisional Headquarters is located at Patiala as are the 43 and 98 Armoured Brigades. 1 Armoured Brigade is located at Nabha and 1 Artillery Brigade at Ambala.

<text>Beach nourishment (also referred to as beach renourishment, beach replenishment, or sand replenishment) describes a process by which sediment, usually sand, lost through longshore drift or erosion is replaced from other sources. A wider beach can reduce storm damage to coastal structures by dissipating energy across the surf zone, protecting upland structures and infrastructure from storm surges, tsunamis and unusually high tides. Beach nourishment is typically part of a larger integrated coastal zone management aimed at coastal defense. Nourishment is typically a repetitive process because it does not remove the physical forces that cause erosion; it simply mitigates their effects.

The first nourishment project in the United States was at Coney Island, New York in 1922 and 1923. It is now a common shore protection measure used by public and private entities.

==History==
The first nourishment project in the U.S. was constructed at Coney Island, New York in 1922–1923.

Before the 1970s, nourishment involved directly placing sand on the beach and dunes. Since then more shoreface nourishments have been carried out, which rely on the forces of the wind, waves and tides to further distribute the sand along the shore and onto the beaches and dunes.

The number and size of nourishment projects has increased significantly due to population growth and projected relative sea-level rise.

==Erosion==

Beach erosion is a specific subset of coastal erosion, which in turn is a type of bioerosion which alters coastal geography through beach morphodynamics. There are numerous incidences of the modern recession of beaches, mainly due to a gradient in longshore drift and coastal development hazards.

===Causes of erosion===
Beaches can erode naturally or due to human impact (beach theft/sand mining).

Erosion is a natural response to storm activity. During storms, sand from the visible beach submerges to form sand bars that protect the beach. Submersion is only part of the cycle. During calm weather, smaller waves return sand from bars to the visible beach surface in a process called accretion.

Some beaches do not have enough sand available for coastal processes to respond naturally to storms. When not enough sand is available, the beach cannot recover after storms.

Many areas of high erosion are due to human activities. Reasons can include: seawalls locking up sand dunes, coastal structures like ports and harbors that prevent longshore transport, and dams and other river management structures. Continuous, long-term renourishment efforts, especially in cuspate-cape coastlines, can play a role in longshore transport inhibition and downdrift erosion. These activities interfere with the natural sediment flows either through dam construction (thereby reducing riverine sediment sources) or construction of littoral barriers such as jetties, or by deepening of inlets; thus preventing longshore transport of sediment.

== Types of shoreline protection approaches ==
The coastal engineering for the shoreline protection involves:

* Soft engineering: Beach nourishment is a type of soft approach which preserves beach resources and avoids the negative effects of hard structures. Instead, nourishment creates a “soft” (i.e., non-permanent) structure by creating a larger sand reservoir, pushing the shoreline seaward.
* Hard engineering: Beach evolution and beach accretion can be facilitated by the four main types of hard engineering structures in coastal engineering are, namely seawall, revetment, groyne or breakwater. Most commonly used hard structures are seawall and series of &quot;headland breakwater&quot; (breakwater connected to the shore with groyne).
* Managed retreat, the shoreline is left to erode, while buildings and infrastructure are relocated further inland.

== Approach==

=== Assessment ===
==== Advantages ====

* Widens the beach.
* Protects structures behind beach.
* Protects from storms.
* Increases land value of nearby properties.
* Grows economy through tourism and recreation.
* Expands habitat.
* Practical, environmentally-friendly approach to address erosional pressure.
* Encourages vegetation growth to help stabilize tidal flats.

==== Disadvantages ====
*Added sand may erode because of storms or lack of up-drift sand sources.
*Expensive and requires repeated application.
*Restricted access during nourishment.
*Destroys or buries marine life.
*Difficulty finding appropriate materials.

===Considerations ===

==== Costs ====
Nourishment is typically a repetitive process, as nourishment mitigates the effects of erosion, but does not remove the causes. A benign environment increases the interval between nourishment projects, reducing costs. Conversely, high erosion rates may render nourishment financially impractical.

In many coastal areas, the economic impacts of a wide beach can be substantial. Since 1923, the U.S. has spent $9 billion to rebuild beaches. One of the most notable example is the –long shoreline fronting Miami Beach, Florida, which was replenished over the period 1976–1981. The project cost approximately US$86 million and revitalized the area&#x27;s economy. Prior to nourishment, in many places the beach was too narrow to walk along, especially during high tide.

In 1998 an overview was made of all known beach nourishment projects in the USA (418 projects). The total volume of all these nourishments was 648 million cubic yards (495 m3) with a total cost of US$3387 million (adjusted to price level 1996). This is US$6.84 per m3. Between 2000 and 2020 the price per m3 has gone up considerably in the USA (see table below), while in Europe the price has gone down.

Around the North Sea prices are much lower. In 2000 an inventory was made by the North Sea Coastal Management Group.

From the Netherlands more detailed data are available, see below in the section on Dutch case studies.

The price for nourishments in areas without an available dredging fleet is often in the order of €20 - €30 per cubic meter.

==== Storm damage reduction ====

A wide beach is a good energy absorber, which is significant in low-lying areas where severe storms can impact upland structures. The effectiveness of wide beaches in reducing structural damage has been proven by field studies conducted after storms and through the application of accepted coastal engineering principles.

==== Environmental impact ====
Beach nourishment has significant impacts on local ecosystems. Nourishment may cause direct mortality to sessile organisms in the target area by burying them under the new sand. The seafloor habitat in both source and target areas are disrupted, e.g. when sand is deposited on coral reefs or when deposited sand hardens. Imported sand may differ in character (chemical makeup, grain size, non-native species) from that of the target environment. Light availability may be reduced, affecting nearby reefs and submerged aquatic vegetation. Imported sand may contain material toxic to local species. Removing material from near-shore environments may destabilize the shoreline, in part by steepening its submerged slope. Related attempts to reduce future erosion may provide a false sense of security that increases development pressure.

=====Sea turtles=====
Newly deposited sand can harden and complicate nest-digging for turtles. However, nourishment can provide more and better habitat for them, as well as for sea birds and beach flora. Florida addressed the concern that dredge pipes would suck turtles into the pumps by adding a special grill to the dredge pipes.

====Material used ====
The selection of suitable material for a particular project depends upon the design needs, environmental factors and transport costs, considering both short and long-term implications.

The most important material characteristic is the sediment grain size, which must closely match the native material. Excess silt and clay fraction (mud) versus the natural turbidity in the nourishment area disqualifies some materials. Projects with unmatched grain sizes performed relatively poorly. Nourishment sand that is only slightly smaller than native sand can result in significantly narrower equilibrated dry beach widths compared to sand the same size as (or larger than) native sand. Evaluating material fit requires a sand survey that usually includes geophysical profiles and surface and core samples.

Some beaches were nourished using a finer sand than the original. Thermoluminescence monitoring reveals that storms can erode such beaches far more quickly. This was observed at a Waikiki nourishment project in Hawaii.

====Profile nourishment====
&quot;Beach Profile Nourishment&quot; describes programs that nourish the full beach profile. In this instance, &quot;profile&quot; means the slope of the uneroded beach from above the water out to sea. The Gold Coast profile nourishment program placed 75% of its total sand volume below low water level. Some coastal authorities &quot;overnourish&quot; the below water beach (aka &quot;nearshore nourishment&quot;) so that over time the natural beach increases in size. These approaches do not permanently protect beaches eroded by human activity, which requires that activity to be mitigated.

====Project impact measurements ====
Nourishment projects usually involve physical, environmental and economic objectives.

Typical physical measures include dry beach width/height, post-storm sand volume, post-storm damage avoidance assessments and aqueous sand volume.

Environmental measures include marine life distribution, habitat and population counts.

Economic impacts include recreation, tourism, flood and &quot;disaster&quot; prevention.

Many nourishment projects are advocated via economic impact studies that rely on additional tourist expenditure. This approach is however unsatisfactory. First, nothing proves that these expenditures are incremental (they could shift expenditures from other nearby areas). Second, economic impact does not account for costs and benefits for all economic agents, as cost benefit analysis does. Techniques for incorporating nourishment projects into flood insurance costs and disaster assistance remain controversial.

The performance of a beach nourishment project is most predictable for a long, straight shoreline without the complications of inlets or engineered structures. In addition, predictability is better for overall performance, e.g., average shoreline change, rather than shoreline change at a specific location.

Nourishment can affect eligibility in the U.S. National Flood Insurance Program and federal disaster assistance.

Nourishment may have the unintended consequence of promoting coastal development, which increases risk of other coastal hazards.

== Other shoreline protection approaches ==
Nourishment is not the only technique used to address eroding beaches. Others can be used singly or in combination with nourishment, driven by economic, environmental and political considerations.

Human activities such as dam construction can interfere with natural sediment flows (thereby reducing riverine sediment sources.) Construction of littoral barriers such as jetties and deepening of inlets can prevent longshore sediment transport.

===Hard engineering or structural approach ===
The structural approach attempts to prevent erosion. Armoring involves building revetments, seawalls, detached breakwaters, groynes, etc. Structures that run parallel to the shore (seawalls or revetments) prevent erosion. While this protects structures, it doesn&#x27;t protect the beach that is outside the wall. The beach generally disappears over a period that ranges from months to decades.

Groynes and breakwaters that run perpendicular to the shore protect it from erosion. Filling a breakwater with imported sand can stop the breakwater from trapping sand from the littoral stream (the ocean running along the shore.) Otherwise the breakwater may deprive downstream beaches of sand and accelerate erosion there.

Armoring may restrict beach/ocean access, enhance erosion of adjacent shorelines, and requires long-term maintenance.

===Managed retreat===
Managed retreat moves structures and other infrastructure inland as the shoreline erodes. Retreat is more often chosen in areas of rapid erosion and in the presence of little or obsolete development.

===Soft engineering approaches ===

====Beach dewatering====
Beaches grow and shrink depending on tides, precipitation, wind, waves and current. Wet beaches tend to lose sand. Waves infiltrate dry beaches easily and deposit sandy sediment. Generally a beach is wet during falling tide, because the sea sinks faster than the beach drains. As a result, most erosion happens during falling tide. Beach drainage (beach dewatering) using Pressure Equalizing Modules (PEMs) allow the beach to drain more effectively during falling tide. Fewer hours of wet beach translate to less erosion. Permeable PEM tubes inserted vertically into the foreshore connect the different layers of groundwater. The groundwater enters the PEM tube allowing gravity to conduct it to a coarser sand layer, where it can drain more quickly. The PEM modules are placed in a row from the dune to the mean low waterline. Distance between rows is typically but this is project-specific. PEM systems come in different sizes. Modules connect layers with varying hydraulic conductivity. Air/water can enter and equalize pressure.

PEMs are minimally invasive, typically covering approximately 0.00005% of the beach. The tubes are below the beach surface, with no visible presence. PEM installations have been installed on beaches in Denmark, Sweden, Malaysia and Florida. The effectiveness of beach dewatering has not been proven convincingly on life-sized beaches, in particular for the sand beach case. Dewatering systems have been shown to lower very significantly the watertable but other morphodynamical effects generally overpower any stabilizing effect of dewatering for fine sediments, although some mixed results on upper beach accretion associated to erosion in middle and lower have been reported. This is in line with the current knowledge of swash-groundwater sediment dynamics which states that the effects of in/exfiltration flows through sand beds in the swash zone associated to modification of swash boundary layer and relative weight of the sediment and overall volume loss of the swash tongue are generally lower than other drivers, at least for fine sediments such as sand 

====Recruitment====
Appropriately constructed and sited fences can capture blowing sand, building/restoring sand dunes, and progressively protecting the beach from the wind, and the shore from blowing sand.

==== Dynamic revetment ====
Another approach is to create dynamic revetment, a berm using unmortared, unsorted rocks (cobbles). Seeds scattered among the cobbles can germinate to anchor the cobbles in place. Sand can collect and recreate a sandy beach. Leaving the rocks loose allows them to migrate and settle in a stable location. Separately, near the highest average waterline, a second berm around a meter in height can accelerate the recovery. This approach was employed at Washaway Beach in North Cove, Washington. Once the berms were in place, in one year the beach expanded by some 15 meters, and continued to grow. Projects in Washington, California, Europe, and Guam have adopted aspects of the techniques.

== Projects ==
The setting of a beach nourishment project is key to design and potential performance. Possible settings include a long straight beach, an inlet that may be either natural or modified and a pocket beach. Rocky or seawalled shorelines, that otherwise have no sediment, present unique problems.

===Cancun, Mexico===
Hurricane Wilma hit the beaches of Cancun and the Riviera Maya in 2005. The initial nourishment project was unsuccessful at a cost of $19 million, leading to a second round that began in September 2009 and was scheduled to complete in early 2010 with a cost of $70 million. The project designers and the government committed to invest in beach maintenance to address future erosion. Project designers considered factors such as the time of year and sand characteristics such as density. Restoration in Cancun was expected to deliver of sand to replenish of coastline.

===Northern Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia===
Gold Coast beaches in Queensland, Australia have experienced periods of severe erosion. In 1967 a series of 11 cyclones removed most of the sand from Gold Coast beaches. The Government of Queensland engaged engineers from Delft University in the Netherlands to advise them. The 1971 Delft Report outlined a series of works for Gold Coast Beaches, including beach nourishment and an artificial reef. By 2005 most of the recommendations had been implemented.

The Northern Gold Coast Beach Protection Strategy (NGCBPS) was an A$10 million investment. NGCBPS was implemented between 1992 and 1999 and the works were completed between 1999 and 2003. The project included dredging of compatible sand from the Gold Coast Broadwater and delivering it through a pipeline to nourish of beach between Surfers Paradise and Main Beach. The new sand was stabilized by an artificial reef constructed at Narrowneck out of huge geotextile sand bags. The new reef was designed to improve wave conditions for surfing. A key monitoring program for the NGCBPS is the ARGUS coastal camera system.

===Netherlands===
====Background====
More than one-quarter of the Netherlands is below sea level. The coastline along the North Sea (approx. ) is protected against flooding by natural sand dunes (only in the estuaries and behind the barrier islands there are no dunes). This coastline is eroding for centuries; in the 19th and beginning of 20th centuries it was tried to stop erosion by construction of groynes, which was costly and not very successful. Beach nourishment was more successful, but there were questions on the method of funding. 
In the Coastal Memorandum of 1990 the government decided, after a very detailed study, that all erosion along the full Dutch coastline would be compensated by artificial beach nourishment.

The shoreline is closely monitored by yearly recording of the cross section at points apart, to ensure adequate protection. Where long-term erosion is identified, beach nourishment using high-capacity suction dredgers is deployed. In 1990 the Dutch government has decided to compensate in principle all coastal erosion by nourishment. This policy is still ongoing and successful. All costs are covered by the National Budget.

A novel beach nourishment strategy was implemented in South Holland, where a new beach form was created using vast quantities of sand with the expectation that the sand would be distributed by natural processes to nourish the beach over many years (see Sand engine).

====Basic Coastline====
The basic coastline in the Netherlands is a representation of the low water line of 1990. This line is used to identify coastal erosion and coastal growth and to take measures if necessary. In the Coastal Memorandum, the Dutch Government decides to maintain the 1990 coastline by beach nourishment. The coastline in question is the low-water line. For practical application, the definition of this does not appear to be unambiguous, which is why the Memorandum also defines the momentary coastline (also called instantaneous coastline) (MKL) and basic Coastline (BKL). Each year, the shoreline to be tested ( TKL) is determined on the basis of the MKL, and if it threatens to come inland from the BKL, a sand nourishment is carried out.

====Definition of the instantaneous coastline====

The problem with the low water line mentioned in the 1990 Coastal Memorandum is that the height of the average low tide is well defined, but the position in the horizontal direction is not. See the attached figure, here the beach profile crosses three times the low water line. In fact, it is also not important to maintain a line, but to maintain the amount of sand in the active beach profile. To determine this volume, two heights are used, the average low water level (glw) and the height of the dune foot (dv). The height of the dune foot is basically determined by finding the intersection of the steep slope of the dune front and of the dry beach. In general, this theoretical dune foot point will be slightly below the sand. It is very difficult to redefine the height of the dune foot every year. Some administrators define the dune foot line as a certain elevation line, on which the dune foot usually lies. In relatively unalterable coastal sections, this is an acceptable approach. The method of determining the MKL is such that it is not very sensitive to the precise choice of the value dv. The location of the dune foot is thus determined by the height above NAP (National Datum, approx. Mean Sea Level) and the distance from that elevation line to the administrative coastline (Xdv). This administrative line has no physical meaning, but is simply the basis for survey work.

The recipe for calculating the position of the MKL is:
*Determine the location of the dune foot
*The height of the average low water (glw) is determined
*The height h of the dune foot above average low water is calculated
*The sand volume A is calculated; A is the volume of sand seaward of the dune foot and above the level (glw-h)
*The position of the momentary coastline (SKL) is defined in relation to the national beach pile line as: (A/2h) - Xdv 
The background of this method is that the thickness of the sand layer to be taken must be a function of the measuring wave height; however, it is unknown. But because the elevation of the dune foot is also a function of the measuring wave height, the value h is a good representation of the effect of both tide and wave influences. For the determination of the beach profiles, the so-called JarKus profiles are measured along the coastline. These profiles are roughly 250 metres apart and are measured annually from around 800 meters in the sea to just behind the dunes. These measurements are available throughout the coast from 1965 onwards. From the period from about 1850 there are also profile soundings available in some places, but these are often slightly shifted compared to the jarkus rowing and are therefore more difficult to analyse. In the case of groynes, the sounding is carried out exactly in the middle between the groynes.

====The Basic Coastline (BKL)====
 The Basic Coastline is by definition the coastline of 1 January 1990. But of course there are no measurements made on exactly that date, moreover, there are always variations in the measurements. The BKL is therefore determined by taking the beach measurements of the approximately 10 years prior to 1990 and by determining the MKL for each of those years. These values are placed in a graph, a regression line is determined. Where this regression line cuts the date 1-1-1990 lies the basic coastline BKL. In principle, the location of the BKL is immutable. In very special cases, where the coast is substantially altered by a work, it can be decided to shift the BKL. This is not based on a technical or morphological calculation, but actually a political decision. An example of this is the Hondsbossche Zeewering, as sea dike near the village of Petten, where the BKL was actually on the toe of the dike. Due to the construction of a new artificial dune in front of this dike (the Hondsbossche Duinen), a piece of dune was added, of which the intention is to preserve it. So there is the BKL shifted seaward.

====The coastline to be tested (TKL) ====

Within the framework of the coastal policy is determined annually whether nourishment is required in a given coastal sector. This is done by determining the coastline (TKL) to be tested before the reference date. This is determined in the same way as the BKL, namely by a regression analysis of the MKL values of the previous years. See the attached graph. In this example, a supplementation was carried out in 1990, causing the MKL to shift far seawards. The number of years over which the regression analysis can be carried out is therefore somewhat limited. If there are too few years available, a regression line is usually adopted parallel to the previous regression line (so it is assumed that the erosion before and after supplementation is approximately the same). By the way, the first year after supplementation is often more than average due to adjustment effects.
In this case, it appears that the TKL is still just satisfactory for 1995 and is no longer satisfactory for 1996. In principle, a supplement at this location would be required in the course of 1995. Now the decision to supplement does not depend on a single BKL exceedance, but only if multiple profiles are threatened to become negative. In order to assess this, coastal maps are issued annually by Rijkswaterstaat.
These maps indicate whether the coast is growing or eroding with a dark green or light green block. A red block indicates that in that place the TKL has exceeded the BKL, and that something has to happen there. A red hatched indicator means that the TKL has exceeded the BKL, but this coastal section has an accreting tendency, so no urgent works are needed

====Beach nourishment design====
A beach nourishment to broaden the beach and maintain the coastline can be designed using mathematical calculation models or on the basis of beach measurements. In the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany, a nourishment design is mainly based on measurement, while mathematical models are mainly used elsewhere. A nourishment design for coastal maintenance and beach widening can be made much more reliable based on measurement data, provided that they are present. If there are no good, long-term series of measurements of the beach profile, one must make the design using calculation models. In the Netherlands, the coast has been measured annually for years (JarKus measurements) and therefore the very reliable method based on measurements is used in the Netherlands for the design of supplements to prevent erosion.

====Use of measurements for nourishment design====
To compensate for coastal erosion, the design of a supplementation is actually very simple, every year the same amount of sand has to be applied as erosion disappears annually. The assumption is that there is no significant change in the wave climate and the orientation of the coastline. With most nourishments, this is a correct assumption. In case of substantial changes in the coastal orientation, this method is therefore not always usable (e.g. in the design of the sand engine). In practice, the length of the nourishment must be 20-40 times the width in order to apply this method.

In short, the method consists of the following steps:
#Make sure there are enough measured profiles (at least 10 years).
#Use these profiles to calculate the annual sand loss (in m3/year) for a coastal section.
#Multiply this amount by an appropriate lifetime (e.g. 5 years).
#Add a loss factor (order 40%).
#Place this amount of sand somewhere on the beach between the low water line and the dune foot.

To determine the amount of sand in the profile, the same method can be used as used for the basic Coastline. Given the fact that the instantaneous coastline has been measured for the necessary years and thus the decline of this coastline, determining the loss of sand is quite simple. Suppose the decline of the MKL is 5 m/year, then the annual sand loss is 5*(2h) m3 per year per linear meter of coastline. Here is 2h the height of the active beach profile. Along the Dutch coast, h is near Hoek van Holland in the order of 4 m, so in the above example the erosion would be 40 m3 per year per linear meter of coast. For a nourishment with a length of 4 km and a lifespan of 5 years is therefore 40*4000*5 = 80 000 m3. Because there is extra sand loss immediately after construction, a good amount is 1.4 *80000 = 112 000 m3. This is a seaward shift of 1.4*5*5= 35 m.
In the practice of beach nourishments (from 1990 onwards), this method appears to work very well. Analyses of nourishments in northern Germany also show that this is a reliable method.
The starting point is that the grain size of the nourishment sand is equal to the original beach sand. If this is not the case, it must be corrected. In case of finer sand in the win area, the volume of the nourishment will need to increase.

====Use of mathematical models for nourishment design====
&quot;Single line model&quot;

For relatively wide and short nourishment (such as the sand motor), a single-line model can be used. In this model, the coast is represented by a single line (e.g. the instantaneous coastline) and a constant profile along the entire coastline. For each profile, the orientation of the coast is given, and in each profile the sand transport is calculated by the surf induced current. If in a profile 1 the sand transport is larger than in a profile 2, there will be between profile 1 and 2 sedimentation, for details about the model. As there is sedimentation, the coastal orientation will change, and thus also the transport of sand. This makes it possible to calculate the coastline change. 
A classic example is the calculation of a relatively short and wide supplementation with straight waves. The single-line model can very well predict how such supplementation can develop over time. 
The Unibest calculation model of Deltares is an example of a single-line model.

====Field models====
In highly two-dimensional situations, e.g. at a tidal inlet or the mouth of an estuary, or if the nourishment itself has a strong two-dimensional character (as with the Sand Engine), an approach with profile measurements is not possible. A single-line model is often inappropriate. In these cases, a two-dimensional sand transport model is made (usually with models such as Delft3D from Deltares in the Netherlands or Mike 21 of DHI in Denmark). In such a model, the bed of the area is introduced as a depth map. Then there is a tidal flow calculation and a wave penetration calculation. After that, the sand transport is calculated at each mesh-point and from the difference in sand transport between the different mesh-points, the sedimentation and erosion is calculated in all boxes. It can then be assessed whether a nourishment behaves as intended.

The problem with this type of model is that (apart from the fairly long computation times for the computer) the results are rather sensitive to inaccuracies in the input. For example, at the edge of the model, the water levels and flow rates must be properly entered, and the wave climate must be well known. Also variations in the sand composition (grain size) have a great influence.

====Channel wall nourishment====
At some places along the Dutch coast tidal channels are very near to the beach. In the years from around 1990 these beaches were also nourished in the classical way, but the problem was that the width of the beach is small. So the amount of sand to be placed is limited, resulting in a short lifetime of the nourishment. It was found that in such cases it is more effective to nourish the landward wall of the channel, and in some cases uses sand from the seaward side of the channel as borrow area. This is in fact moving the tidal channel further from the coastline (chapter 4)

====Foreshore nourishments====

Instead of directly supplying the beach, it is also possible to supple the foreshore (underwater bank). The advantage of this is that the implementation of the nourishment is cheaper, and there is no direct effect of the work on the use of the beach. The sand is then transported over time by the waves from deeper water to the coast. A foreshore nourishment is calculated just like a beach nourishment, but the use of measurement data with beach profiles is then less easy, as a foreshore nourishment does not give a new beach line. Therefore, in those cases, a single-line model or a field model is usually used.

In the period 1990-2020 in total 236 million cubic meters has been nourished, mainly as beach nourishment. However after 2004 more focus has been on foreshore nourishment.

In 2006 the costs of some nourishment were analysed in detail. This resulted in:

F= Foreshore, B= Beach nourishment, B+F is combination; Price level 2006, excluding VAT.

===Hawaii===
====Waikiki====
Hawaii planned to replenish Waikiki beach in 2010. Budgeted at $2.5 million, the project covered in an attempt to return the beach to its 1985 width. Prior opponents supported this project, because the sand was to come from nearby shoals, reopening a blocked channel and leaving the overall local sand volume unchanged, while closely matching the &quot;new&quot; sand to existing materials. The project planned to apply up to of sand from deposits located offshore at a depth of . The project was larger than the prior recycling effort in 2006-07, which moved .

====Maui====
Maui, Hawaii illustrated the complexities of even small-scale nourishment projects. A project at Sugar Cove transported upland sand to the beach. The sand allegedly was finer than the original sand and contained excess silt that enveloped coral, smothering it and killing the small animals that lived in and around it. As in other projects, on-shore sand availability was limited, forcing consideration of more expensive offshore sources.

A second project, along Stable Road, that attempted to slow rather than halt erosion, was stopped halfway toward its goal of adding of sand. The beaches had been retreating at a &quot;comparatively fast rate&quot; for half a century. The restoration was complicated by the presence of old seawalls, groins, piles of rocks and other structures.

This project used sand-filled geotextile tube groins that were originally to remain in place for up to 3 years. A pipe was to transport sand from deeper water to the beach. The pipe was anchored by concrete blocks attached by fibre straps. A video showed the blocks bouncing off the coral in the current, killing whatever they touched. In places the straps broke, allowing the pipe to move across the reef, &quot;planing it down&quot;. Bad weather exacerbated the damaging movement and killed the project. The smooth, cylindrical geotextile tubes could be difficult to climb over before they were covered by sand.

Supporters claimed that 2010&#x27;s seasonal summer erosion was less than in prior years, although the beach was narrower after the restoration ended than in 2008. Authorities were studying whether to require the project to remove the groins immediately. Potential alternatives to geotextile tubes for moving sand included floating dredges and/or trucking in sand dredged offshore.

A final consideration was sea level rise and that Maui was sinking under its own weight. Both Maui and Hawaii Island surround massive mountains (Haleakala, Mauna Loa, and Mauna Kea) and were expanding a giant dimple in the ocean floor, some below the mountain summits.

=== The Outer Banks ===
The Outer Banks off the coast of North Carolina and southeastern Virginia include a number of towns. Five of the six town have undergone beach nourishment since 2011. The projects were as follows:

Duck, North Carolina: the beach nourishment took place in 2017 and cost an estimated $14,057,929.

Southern Shores, North Carolina - the estimated costs for the Southern Shores project was approximately $950,000 and was completed in 2017. There is a proposed additional project to widen the beaches in 2022 with an estimated cost of between $9 million and $13.5 million.

Kitty Hawk, North Carolina - the beach nourishment project in Kitty Hawk was completed in 2017 and included 3.58 miles of beaches running from the Southern Shores to Kitty Hawk and cost $18.2 million.

Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina - the beach nourishment project was completed in 2017.

Nags Head, North Carolina - The town&#x27;s first beach nourishment project took place in 2011 and cost between $36 million and $37 million. The renourishment project in 2019 cost an estimated $25,546,711.

Upcoming Projects - the towns of Duck, Southern Shores, Kitty Hawk and Kill Devil Hills have secured a contract with Coastal Protection Engineering for tentative re-nourishment projects scheduled for 2022.

=== United States ===
Florida - Ninety PEMs (Pressure Equalizing Modules) were installed in February 2008 at Hillsboro Beach. After 18 months the beach had expanded significantly. Most of the PEMs were removed in 2011. Beach volume expanded by 38,500 cubic yards over 3 years compared to an average annual loss of 21,000.

New Jersey - Over decades, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has pour millions of cubic yards of sand slurry along the Jersey Shore. Costs for the project are shared by the Army Corps of Engineers, the state, and local municipalities. Although New Jersey&#x27;s coastline is 1% of the U.S. coastline, from 1922 to 2022, more than $2.6 billion was expended on beach replenishment projects in the state, about 20% of the nation&#x27;s total spending on beach replenishment. &quot;Dredge and fill&quot; operations began in 1989. Justifications for the projects, controversial within New Jersey, have included flood control, prevention of damage to waterfront residences, and protection of summer tourism along the shore, as well as public access to beaches. Critics, such as the Sierra Club and Surfrider Foundation, have argued that beach renourishment in the state is wasteful since the sand often washes away quickly; they argue for alternative policies to mitigate the effects of climate change, storm surges and rising sea levels, and argue that renourishment is effectively a subsidy for wealthy homeowners.

=== Hong Kong ===
The beach in Gold Coast was built as an artificial beach in the 1990s with HK$60m. Sands are supplied periodically, especially after typhoons, to keep the beach viable.

<text>Gothos is a village at the base of Raganagad fort in Sindhudurg District of Maharashtra, India. It lies east of the district headquarters, Kudal. The village is spread across an area of and has 410 households. According to the 2001 Census of India, the village has a total population of 1,515 persons, of which 743 are male and 772 female. Its post code is 416519.

== History ==
The village was presented as Inam to the Rajyadhyaksha family of Kaundinya Gotra from Pilgaon in Goa, who were fleeing from the Portuguese Inquisition in the 17th century by the Raja of Sawantwadi. Hence the family was conferred the title of Gothoskar. Some families from Gothos village have taken this as their last name. The Gazetter of Ratnagiri District has a mention of the Sabnis of Gothos in the description of Manohargad and Mansantoshgad.

== Administration ==
The village comes under Kudal taluka (District headquarters). The administration is looked after by village panchayat.

== Landmarks ==
The Village has two main temples – भावई देवी Bhavai Devi (Gramdaivat) and विठोबा Vithoba temple. The Guardian Spirit of the Village is called दाडसाखळ Daadsakhal and is housed on a Banyan Tree on the main road.

<doc id="1018642" wikidata="Q1359152" url="?curid=1018642" title="Seawall">
<text>A seawall (or sea wall) is a form of coastal defense constructed where the sea, and associated coastal processes, impact directly upon the landforms of the coast. The purpose of a seawall is to protect areas of human habitation, conservation, and leisure activities from the action of tides, waves, or tsunamis. As a seawall is a static feature, it will conflict with the dynamic nature of the coast and impede the exchange of sediment between land and sea.

Seawall designs factor in local climate, coastal position, wave regime (determined by wave characteristics and effectors), and value (morphological characteristics) of landform. Seawalls are hard engineering shore-based structures that protect the coast from erosion. Various environmental issues may arise from the construction of a seawall, including the disruption of sediment movement and transport patterns. Combined with a high construction cost, this has led to increasing use of other soft engineering coastal management options such as beach replenishment.

Seawalls are constructed from various materials, most commonly reinforced concrete, boulders, steel, or gabions. Other possible construction materials include vinyl, wood, aluminum, fiberglass composite, and biodegradable sandbags made of jute and coir. In the UK, &quot;seawall&quot; also refers to an earthen bank used to create a polder, or a dike construction. The type of material used for construction is hypothesized to affect the settlement of coastal organisms, although the precise mechanism has yet to be identified.

==Types==
A seawall works by reflecting incident wave energy back into the sea, thus reducing the energy available to cause erosion. Seawalls have two specific weaknesses. Wave reflection from the wall may result in hydrodynamic scour and subsequent lowering of the sand level of the fronting beach. Seawalls may also accelerate the erosion of adjacent, unprotected coastal areas by affecting the littoral drift process.

Different designs of man-made tsunami barriers include building reefs and forests to above-ground and submerged seawalls. Starting just weeks after the disaster, in January 2005, India began planting &quot;Casuarina&quot; and coconut saplings on its coast as a natural barrier against future disasters like the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. Studies have found that an offshore tsunami wall could reduce tsunami wave heights by up to 83%.

The appropriate seawall design relies on location-specific aspects, including surrounding erosion processes. There are three main types of seawalls: vertical, curved, stepped, and mounds (see table below).

=== Natural barriers ===
A report published by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) suggests that the tsunami of 26 December 2004 caused less damage in the areas where natural barriers were present, such as mangroves, coral reefs or coastal vegetation. A Japanese study of this tsunami in Sri Lanka used satellite imagery modelling to establish the parameters of coastal resistance as a function of different types of trees. Natural barriers, such as coral reefs and mangrove forests, prevent the spread of tsunamis and the flow of coastal waters and mitigated the flood and surge of water.

==Trade-offs==
A cost-benefit approach is an effective way to determine whether a seawall is appropriate and whether the benefits are worth the expense. Besides controlling erosion, consideration must be given to the effects of hardening a shoreline on natural coastal ecosystems and human property or activities. A seawall is a static feature which can conflict with the dynamic nature of the coast and impede the exchange of sediment between land and sea. The table below summarizes some positive and negative effects of seawalls which can be used when comparing their effectiveness with other coastal management options, such as beach nourishment.

Generally, seawalls can be a successful way to control coastal erosion, but only if they are constructed well and out of materials that can withstand the force of ongoing wave energy. Some understanding is needed of the coastal processes and morphodynamics specific to the seawall location. Seawalls can be very helpful; they can offer a more long-term solution than soft engineering options, additionally providing recreation opportunities and protection from extreme events as well as everyday erosion. Extreme natural events expose weaknesses in the performance of seawalls, and analyses of these can lead to future improvements and reassessment.

==Issues==

===Sea level rise===
Sea level rise creates an issue for seawalls worldwide as it raises both the mean normal water level and the height of waves during extreme weather events, which the current seawall heights may be unable to cope with. The most recent analyses of long, good-quality tide gauge records (corrected for GIA and when possible for other vertical land motions by the Global Positioning System, GPS) indicate a mean rate of sea level rise of 1.6–1.8 mm/yr over the twentieth century. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (1997) suggested that sea level rise over the next 50 – 100 years will accelerate with a projected increase in global mean sea level of +18 cm by 2050 AD. This data is reinforced by Hannah (1990) who calculated similar statistics including a rise of between +16-19.3 cm throughout 1900–1988. Superstorm Sandy of 2012 is an example of the devastating effects rising sea levels can cause when mixed with a perfect storm. Superstorm Sandy sent a storm surge of 4–5 m onto New Jersey&#x27;s and New York&#x27;s barrier island and urban shorelines, estimated at $70 billion in damage. This problem could be overcome by further modeling and determining the extension of height and reinforcement of current seawalls which needs to occur for safety to be ensured in both situations. Sea level rise also will cause a higher risk of flooding and taller tsunamis.

===Hydrostatic water pressure===
Seawalls, like all retaining walls, must relieve the buildup of water pressure. Water pressure buildup is caused when groundwater is not drained from behind the seawall. Groundwater against a seawall can be from the area&#x27;s natural water-table, rain percolating into the ground behind the wall and waves overtopping the wall. The water table can also rise during periods of high water (high tide). Lack of adequate drainage can cause the seawall to buckle, move, bow, crack, or collapse. Sinkholes may also develop as the escaping water pressure erodes soil through or around the drainage system.

===Extreme events===
Extreme events also pose a problem as it is not easy for people to predict or imagine the strength of hurricane or storm-induced waves compared to normal, expected wave patterns. An extreme event can dissipate hundreds of times more energy than everyday waves, and calculating structures that will stand the force of coastal storms is difficult and, often the outcome can become unaffordable. For example, the Omaha Beach seawall in New Zealand was designed to prevent erosion from everyday waves only, and when a storm in 1976 carved out ten meters behind the existing seawall, the whole structure was destroyed.

=== Ecosystem impacts ===
The addition of seawalls near marine ecosystems can lead to increased shadowing effects in the waters surrounding the seawall. Shadowing reduces the light and visibility within the water, which may disrupt the distribution as well as foraging capabilities of certain species. The sediment surrounding seawalls tends to have less favorable physical properties (Higher calcification levels, less structural organization of crystalline structure, low silicon content, and less macroscale roughness) when compared to natural shorelines, which can present issues for species that reside on the seafloor.

The Living Seawalls project, which was launched in Sydney, Australia, in 2018, aims to help many of the marine species in Sydney Harbour to flourish, thus enhancing its biodiversity, by modifying the design of its seawalls. It entails covering parts of the seawalls with specially-designed tiles that mimic natural microhabitats - with crevices and other features that more closely resemble natural rocks. In September 2021, the Living Seawalls project was announced as a finalist for the international environment award the Earthshot Prize. Since 2022 it has become part of Project Restore, under the auspices of the Sydney Institute of Marine Science.

===Other issues===
Some further issues include a lack of long-term trend data of seawall effects due to a relatively short duration of data records; modeling limitations and comparisons of different projects and their effects being invalid or unequal due to different beach types; materials; currents; and environments. Lack of maintenance is also a major issue with seawalls. In 2013, more than 5,000 feet (1,500 m) of seawall was found to be crumbling in Punta Gorda, Florida. Residents of the area pay hundreds of dollars each year for a seawall repair program. The problem is that most of the seawalls are over a half-century old and are being destroyed by only heavy downpours. If not kept in check, seawalls lose effectiveness and become expensive to repair.

==History and examples==

Seawall construction has existed since ancient times. In the first century BCE, Romans built a seawall or breakwater at Caesarea Maritima
creating an artificial harbor (Sebastos Harbor). The construction used Pozzolana concrete which hardens in contact with seawater. Barges were constructed and filled with the concrete. They were floated into position and sunk. The resulting harbor/breakwater/seawall is still in existence today – more than 2000 years later.

The oldest known coastal defense is believed to be a 100-meter row of boulders in the Mediterranean Sea off the coast of Israel. Boulders were positioned in an attempt to protect the coastal settlement of Tel Hreiz from sea rise following the last glacial maximum. Tel Hreiz was discovered in 1960 by divers searching for shipwrecks, but the row of boulders was not found until storms cleared a sand cover in 2012.

More recently, seawalls were constructed in 1623 in Canvey Island, UK, when great floods of the Thames estuary occurred, prompting the construction of protection for further events in this flood-prone area. Since then, seawall design has become more complex and intricate in response to an improvement in materials, technology, and an understanding of how coastal processes operate. This section will outline some key case studies of seawalls in chronological order and describe how they have performed in response to tsunamis or ongoing natural processes and how effective they were in these situations. Analyzing the successes and shortcomings of seawalls during severe natural events allows their weaknesses to be exposed, and areas become visible for future improvement.

===Canada===
The Vancouver Seawall is a stone seawall constructed around the perimeter of Stanley Park in Vancouver, British Columbia. The seawall was constructed initially as waves created by ships passing through the First Narrows eroding the area between Prospect Point and Brockton Point. Construction of the seawall began in 1917, and since then this pathway has become one of the most used features of the park by both locals and tourists and now extends 22 km in total. The construction of the seawall also provided employment for relief workers during the Great Depression and seamen from on Deadman&#x27;s Island who were facing punishment detail in the 1950s (Steele, 1985).

Overall, the Vancouver Seawall is a prime example of how seawalls can simultaneously provide shoreline protection and a source of recreation which enhances human enjoyment of the coastal environment. It also illustrates that although shoreline erosion is a natural process, human activities, interactions with the coast, and poorly planned shoreline development projects can accelerate natural erosion rates.

=== India ===
On December 26, 2004, towering waves of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake tsunami crashed against India&#x27;s south-eastern coastline killing thousands. However, the former French colonial enclave of Pondicherry escaped unscathed. This was primarily due to French engineers who had constructed (and maintained) a massive stone seawall during the time when the city was a French colony. This 300-year-old seawall effectively kept Pondicherry&#x27;s historic center dry even though tsunami waves drove water above the normal high-tide mark.

The barrier was initially completed in 1735 and over the years, the French continued to fortify the wall, piling huge boulders along its coastline to stop erosion from the waves pounding the harbor. At its highest, the barrier running along the water&#x27;s edge reaches about above sea level. The boulders, some weighing up to a ton, are weathered black and brown. The seawall is inspected every year and whenever gaps appear or the stones sink into the sand, the government adds more boulders to keep it strong.

The Union Territory of Pondicherry recorded around 600 deaths from the huge tsunami waves that struck India&#x27;s coast after the mammoth underwater earthquake (which measured 9.0 on the moment magnitude scale) off Indonesia, but most of those killed were fishermen who lived in villages beyond the artificial barrier which reinforces the effectiveness of seawalls.

===Japan===
At least 43 percent of Japan&#x27;s coastline is lined with concrete seawalls or other structures designed to protect the country against high waves, typhoons, or even tsunamis. During the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, the seawalls in most areas were overwhelmed. In Kamaishi, waves surmounted the seawall – the world&#x27;s largest, erected a few years ago in the city&#x27;s harbor at a depth of , a length of and a cost of $1.5 billion – and eventually submerged the city center.

The risks of dependence on seawalls were most evident in the crisis at the Fukushima Dai-ichi and Fukushima Dai-ni nuclear power plants, both located along the coast close to the earthquake zone, as the tsunami washed over walls that were supposed to protect the plants. Arguably, the additional defense provided by the seawalls presented an extra margin of time for citizens to evacuate and also stopped some of the full force of energy which would have caused the wave to climb higher in the backs of coastal valleys. In contrast, the seawalls also acted in a negative way to trap water and delay its retreat.

The failure of the world&#x27;s largest seawall, which cost $1.5 billion to construct, shows that building stronger seawalls to protect larger areas would have been even less cost-effective. In the case of the ongoing crisis at the nuclear power plants, higher and stronger seawalls should have been built if power plants were to be built at that site. Fundamentally, the devastation in coastal areas and a final death toll predicted to exceed 10,000 could push Japan to redesign its seawalls or consider more effective alternative methods of coastal protection for extreme events. Such hardened coastlines can also provide a false sense of security to property owners and local residents as evident in this situation.

Seawalls along the Japanese coast have also been criticized for cutting settlements off from the sea, making beaches unusable, presenting an eyesore, disturbing wildlife, and being unnecessary.

===United States===

After 2012&#x27;s Hurricane Sandy, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio invested $3,000,000,000 in a hurricane restoration fund, with part of the money dedicated to building new seawalls and protection from future hurricanes.
A New York Harbor Storm-Surge Barrier has been proposed, but not voted on or funded by Congress or the State of New York.

In Florida, tiger dams are used to protect homes near the coast.

<text>Pan is a Filipino folk/punk rock band formed in 2002. The band was formed as a duo composed of former Yano bandmates Dong Abay on vocals and Onie Badiang on bass; the duo later added Duane Cruz and Melvin Leyson to play the bass and drums live.

The band only released one album, &quot;Parnaso ng Payaso&quot;. The song &quot;Hula&quot; () from that album won as Best Folk/Pop Recording at the 2003 Awit Awards.

In early 2005, Abay left Pan to pursue an indie career, resulting in the band going inactive.

<doc id="1018650" wikidata="Q172983" url="?curid=1018650" title="Michele Alboreto">
<text>Michele Alboreto (; 23 December 1956 – 25 April 2001) was an Italian racing driver, who competed in Formula One from to . Alboreto was runner-up in the Formula One World Drivers&#x27; Championship in with Ferrari, and won five Grands Prix across 14 seasons. In endurance racing, Alboreto won the 24 Hours of Le Mans in with Joest, as well as the 12 Hours of Sebring in 2001 with Audi.

His career in motorsport began in 1976, racing a car he and a number of his friends had built in the Formula Monza series. The car, however, achieved very little success and two years later Alboreto moved up to Formula Three. Wins in the Italian Formula Three championship and a European Formula Three Championship crown in 1980 paved the way for his entrance into Formula One with the Tyrrell team.

Two wins, the first in the final round of the season in Las Vegas, and the second a year later in Detroit, earned him a place with the Ferrari team. Alboreto took three wins for the Italian team and challenged Alain Prost for the 1985 Championship, eventually losing out by 20 points. The following three seasons were less successful, however, and at the end of the season, the Italian left Ferrari and re-signed with his former employers Tyrrell, where he stayed until joining Larrousse midway through .

Further seasons with Footwork, Scuderia Italia and Minardi followed during the tail end of his F1 career. In 1995, Alboreto moved on to sportscars and a year later the American IndyCar series. He took his final major victories, the 1997 Le Mans 24 Hours and 2001 Sebring 12 Hours, with German manufacturers Porsche and Audi, respectively. In 2001, a month after his Sebring victory, he was killed testing an Audi R8 at the Lausitzring in Germany.

==Career==

===1976–1981: Junior formulae===
Michele Alboreto started his career in 1976 racing in Formula Monza with a car he and his friends built, known as the &quot;CMR&quot;. The car itself proved to be uncompetitive and in 1978 Alboreto, now in a more competitive March, moved over to Formula Italia where he began to take race wins. Two years later Alboreto moved up to Formula Three, racing in a &quot;Euroracing&quot;-entered March-Toyota in both the European and Italian series. In his début Formula Three season, Alboreto finished 6th and 2nd respectively in the two championships, scoring three wins in the Italian series.

In 1980 he took the European crown and finished third in the Italian championship, taking five wins between the two series. An appearance in the British Championship was also made that year.

Alboreto&#x27;s European title earned him a move into Formula Two, a feeder series for Formula One, with the Minardi team. He scored Minardi&#x27;s only F2 victory, at Misano, during the 1981 season where he finished eighth in the championship.

===1980–1983: Sportscars===
Despite his career in open wheel racing, Alboreto was chosen by Lancia to be part of their official squad in the World Championship for Makes, running in rounds which did not conflict with his other races. He shared the Group 5 category Lancia Beta Montecarlo with Walter Röhrl or Eddie Cheever on four occasions during the 1980 season, scoring three second-place finishes and a fourth.

Alboreto again ran a partial schedule in 1981 even though he was also running Formula Two and Formula One. This season included his first participation in the 24 Hours of Le Mans. He earned an eighth-place finish overall, second in class, and was the highest-finishing Lancia. He followed this with his first win in the championship, at the Six Hours of Watkins Glen with co-driver Riccardo Patrese. Alboreto finished the year 52nd in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, the highest-ranked Lancia driver.

When Lancia chose to move to a new class of competition with the Lancia LC1 as the championship concentrated solely on endurance races in 1982, further success came for Alboreto. A small schedule for the championship, as well as an emphasis on European circuits, allowed him to compete in every race that year. Although the LC1 suffered from mechanical problems on its debut, Alboreto and teammate Patrese were able to rebound to earn a victory at the 1000 km of Silverstone. Teo Fabi joined the duo for the 1000 km of the Nürburgring, where they once again earned a victory. He was not able to repeat his previous success at Le Mans when the LC1&#x27;s engine failed, and was unable to complete an event at Spa when the car broke in the closing laps. A third victory was earned by Alboreto and new teammate Piercarlo Ghinzani at their home circuit, Mugello. The final two races of the World Championship season had Alboreto&#x27;s car eliminated from contention due to accidents. At the end of the season, he had secured fifth in the Drivers&#x27; Championship.

Lancia changed classes and cars once again in 1983 World Sportscar Championship season, but Alboreto remained as one of the team&#x27;s primary drivers. He brought the new Lancia LC2 to a ninth-place finish in its debut at the 1000 km of Monza, but the new car struggled to finish the next few races of the season. His entries would not finish another race until round five, where he earned eleventh. While Lancia chose to skip later rounds of the championship, he would not return to the team in order to concentrate fully on his commitments to Formula One. His troubles with the LC2 and early departure from the team earned him only two points in the championship.

===Formula One===

====1981–1983: Tyrrell====

At the age of 24, Alboreto made his Formula One debut at the 1981 San Marino Grand Prix for the Cosworth-powered Tyrrell Racing team, replacing Ricardo Zunino after the Argentine failed to impress team boss Ken Tyrrell. Unfortunately for the Italian, a collision with fellow countryman Beppe Gabbiani put him out of the race after completing 31 of the 60 laps. Alboreto failed to score a single point during his debut year, his highest position being ninth at the Dutch Grand Prix.

In comparison to the previous season, Alboreto had a more successful 1982 campaign. The Italian took the first podium of his Grand Prix career at Imola and, at the final round in Las Vegas, Alboreto took his first Grand Prix win. He is the last winner of the Caesars Palace Grand Prix as the following year, the track was axed from the calendar. Alboreto scored a total of 25 points during his second season of F1, finishing as the top Italian in eighth place overall.

Despite a win in Detroit, registered as not only the last victory for a naturally aspirated car until the end of the turbo-era in 1989, but the 155th and last F1 victory for the Cosworth DFV (technically Alboreto&#x27;s Tyrrell carried the DFV&#x27;s 1983 development, the DFY), after Nelson Piquet&#x27;s leading Brabham suffered a rear tyre deflation in the closing stages, Alboreto failed to finish in the points consistently and, with only one further points finish at Zandvoort, the Italian finished the season with ten points and down in twelfth position. However, it was announced that the Italian would partner René Arnoux at Ferrari. Replacing Patrick Tambay, he became the first Italian driver to race for the marque since Arturo Merzario in . Allegedly, by signing Alboreto, Enzo Ferrari broke his own personal rule about hiring an Italian driver for his Formula One team.

====1984–1988: Ferrari====
In his debut season for Ferrari, Alboreto took victory in the third round at Zolder becoming the first Italian driver to win an F1 Grand Prix for Ferrari since Ludovico Scarfiotti won the 1966 Italian Grand Prix. He finished on the podium a further three times: at the Österreichring where he finished third; Ferrari&#x27;s home circuit of Monza where he finished second; and at the Nürburgring, where he also finished in second place despite running out of fuel going into the final turn (the close following Brabham-BMW of reigning World Champion Nelson Piquet also ran out of fuel at the final turn allowing Alboreto to keep his 2nd place). Alboreto finished the 1984 season in fourth with 30.5 points, the half point coming from his sixth place at the Monaco Grand Prix which was cut to under half its original race distance due to heavy rain, resulting in half points being awarded.


 would prove to be Alboreto&#x27;s most successful year in Formula One. He took two wins: the first a dominant win at the Canadian Grand Prix with new team mate Stefan Johansson finishing second, and the second at the German Grand Prix where he had a somewhat luckier time, twice being involved in incidents with other cars (once with Johansson at the very first corner of the race, giving his team mate a flat tyre) and with his car trailing oil smoke for much of the event, though a brake problem and a lack of power from the TAG-Porsche engine kept his main title rival Alain Prost from challenging. Alboreto led the points table until Round 11 at Zandvoort, but finished the season in second place with 53 points, 20 points behind new World Champion Prost. Formula One journalist Nigel Roebuck commented that &quot;Alboreto was Prost&#x27;s only real challenger for the World Championship&quot;. Ultimately it was Ferrari&#x27;s unreliability which cost Alboreto his chance at the World Championship as he failed to finish the final five races of the season all due to mechanical failure, though he was classified 13th in Italy despite his engine blowing on lap 45 of 51. At the 1985 European Grand Prix at Brands Hatch, after stopping to replace a flat-spotted tyre on lap 11, his Ferrari blew its turbo halfway through lap 13. Alboreto, frustrated that Ferrari&#x27;s late-season reliability had cost him the World Championship, drove the car back to the pits with the rear of the car on fire. He drove the on-fire car into the pits and straight to his Ferrari pit. Many observers saw this as Alboreto&#x27;s way of showing that the Ferrari&#x27;s unreliability had cost him the World Championship, which Prost won by finishing 4th in the race.

In Ferrari&#x27;s new car, the F1/86 designed by Harvey Postlethwaite, proved to be slower and less reliable than its predecessor as Alboreto retired from nine races, of which seven were mechanical failures. Alboreto only scored one podium, at the Austrian Grand Prix – even then both Williams cars of Nigel Mansell and Nelson Piquet had retired and Alboreto finished a full lap behind race winner Alain Prost. The Italian finished the season ninth in the Drivers&#x27; Championship with fourteen points. While the Ferrari V6 turbo was rated as one of the more powerful engines on the grid, both Alboreto and his teammate Stefan Johansson were hampered by the F1/86 which refused to handle on tracks which had a bumpy surface. Johansson finished 5th in the championship with 20 points despite being the #2 driver in the team, causing many to question why the team chose to re-sign Alboreto and let Johansson go.

Austrian Gerhard Berger joined Ferrari in which signalled the end of Alboreto&#x27;s time as leader of the Ferrari team. Berger soon established himself as the team&#x27;s number one driver thanks to his wins in Japan and Australia at the end of the season, while Alboreto could only manage a handful of podiums at Imola, Monaco and a second place at the final round in Australia to make it a Ferrari one-two and only then after the Lotus 99T-Honda of second on the road finisher Ayrton Senna had been disqualified post-race for having oversized brake ducts. The Italian finished the year in seventh overall with 17 points, 19 points behind his teammate.

The 1988 season would be Alboreto&#x27;s final year with Ferrari. With the McLaren-Hondas of Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost dominating the season, the Ferrari team only managed a single win during the year at the Italian Grand Prix which Berger won from Alboreto in second place. Ferrari refused to offer the Italian a new contract so Alboreto looked elsewhere for a drive. This announcement came at the French Grand Prix in July and pit lane rumours had Michele re-joining Tyrrell for 1989 (in France, where Alboreto finished 3rd and Berger a distant 4th, was the only time in 1988 the Italian would finish in front of the Austrian in a race where both finished). After France he received an offer from Frank Williams, head of the Williams team who would have exclusive use of the new V10 Renault engine in 1989. Later that year before the Italian GP at Monza, Alboreto had not received any word from Williams and requested confirmation of his seat at the team. Williams replied by saying that &quot;he wanted him&quot; and &quot;not to move&quot;. At Monza, however, Williams announced he had signed Belgian Thierry Boutsen instead while also confirming that the team&#x27;s number 2 driver, Alboreto&#x27;s former Lancia sportscar teammate Riccardo Patrese, would be staying with the team. As it was late in the season, Alboreto was left with few options for the coming season and arguably signalled the end of his time driving for one of the top teams.

Alboreto competed in eighty Grands Prix for Ferrari, which established a new record. It stood until the 1995 Argentine Grand Prix, when it was surpassed by Berger.

====1989: Tyrrell and Larrousse====
A lack of a drive had left Alboreto in a difficult situation and he later said that he contemplated retirement – an option of which his family were very much in favour. However, he was offered a drive at his former employer Tyrrell, which he accepted. The relationship between Alboreto and team boss, Ken Tyrrell, soon turned sour. At the Monaco Grand Prix, Alboreto was told to drive the 1988 model Tyrrell 017, due to the newer 018 model not being completed. Teammate Jonathan Palmer was chosen to drive the new monoshock 018. Meanwhile, the Italian would have to wait until the following day for the 018 so he decided not to accept this. The result was Alboreto boycotting the Thursday practice session. Alboreto finished the race in fifth position while Palmer finished ninth. This was followed by a strong performance at the next race in Mexico, where Alboreto finished 3rd – the only podium the team would achieve during the season.

By the French Grand Prix, Ken Tyrrell had found a new sponsor in Camel cigarettes for the season and told Alboreto that if he wanted to continue with the team he would need to end his personal sponsorship deal with Marlboro, a rival brand to Camel. Alboreto was disappointed, as thanks to his Marlboro backing, the team had managed to fund his wages. Following Alboreto&#x27;s refusal to cut his ties with his sponsor, Tyrrell replaced him with the up-and-coming French Formula 3000 driver Jean Alesi. Alesi finished fourth in his first Grand Prix for the team at the French Grand Prix.

Ironically, Alboreto soon lost his Marlboro sponsorship as well after they refused to find him another drive for the rest of the 1989 season. He was, however, soon hired by the French Larrousse team, incidentally co-sponsored by Camel, for the German Grand Prix and the rest of the season. Although his new teammate Philippe Alliot showed that the Lola LC89 with its Lamborghini V12 engine could be a competitive car with high grid positions and challenging for points in various races, Alboreto failed to score a single point for the rest of the season, and twice he even failed to pre-qualify in Spain (where Alliot not only pre-qualified, but then qualified a season high 5th) and in the final round in Australia, while in between those two races the Italian also failed to qualify in Japan. During qualifying for the Hungarian Grand Prix the Italian cut one of the chicanes and broke two of his ribs in the process. After competing the year for two teams, Alboreto finished the year eleventh in the Drivers&#x27; Championship with six points.

====1990–1992: Footwork====
 saw Alboreto move to the Arrows team, which was in the process of being sold to sponsor Footwork. It was seen mainly as a &quot;transition year&quot; for him, as the chassis was in its second year and severe uncompetitiveness would be expected. Despite this, the 33-year-old finished in the top ten a number of times and only retired three times. Alboreto finished the season, however, as one of 21 drivers who failed to score a point.

Footwork secured Porsche works engines for and sponsorship from Japan, as the Footwork company completed its takeover of the team. The package did not, however, live up to its expectations as it failed to qualify a number of times. Soon the overweight and unreliable Porsche engines were replaced by Hart-supplied Cosworth engines for the rest of the season, the short-term fix not improving the team&#x27;s competitiveness. This would be Alboreto&#x27;s second season in succession that he failed to score a point.

Thanks to Footwork&#x27;s Japanese connections the team received a supply of Mugen Honda V10 engines for . The FA13 was reliable in comparison to its predecessor and Alboreto scored points four times, in addition to finishing in seventh place six times. With a season total of six points, the 35-year-old finished the year tenth overall.

====1993–1994: Scuderia Italia and Minardi====

Alboreto joined the Italian team Scuderia Italia, which had enjoyed a number of successes in its short history, most notably when Andrea de Cesaris and JJ Lehto had scored podium positions at the 1989 Canadian Grand Prix and 1991 San Marino Grand Prix respectively. At the start of 1993, however, the team moved away from its Dallara-built chassis and were instead supplied by Lola. The Italian failed to score any points over the year, and failed to qualify several times as the slowest runner in the 26-car field. Scuderia Italia withdrew before the end of the season, and merged with fellow Italian team Minardi for .

The Minardi cars proved to be mostly uncompetitive and unreliable, with a total of nine retirements from sixteen rounds. A sixth position in Monaco was Alboreto&#x27;s only points finish. At the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix, which was overshadowed by the deaths of Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger, whilst leaving the pitlane after a scheduled stop, Alboreto&#x27;s car lost its loose right rear wheel which bounced through the Benetton, Ferrari, and Lotus pit areas and crews, injuring several mechanics. At the end of the season, he decided to retire from Grand Prix racing, with a record of 194 starts and five Grand Prix wins.

===1994–2001: Post-Formula One career===
Following his departure from Formula One in 1995, Alboreto embarked on a career in the German Touring Car Championship, known as the Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft. Racing for Alfa Romeo&#x27;s factory team, Alfa Corse, the Italian finished 22nd in the championship, scoring four points. Further entries in the International Touring Car Championship and World Sportscar Championship, the latter being with Ferrari, also proved to be fruitless ventures.

Alboreto returned to open-wheel racing in 1996, entering the newly formed Indy Racing League (IRL) with Scandia/Simon Racing. The then 39-year-old competed in all three rounds where he finished fourth on his debut at Walt Disney World Speedway; eighth at the Phoenix International Raceway; and retired, due to gearbox problems, at the 1996 Indianapolis 500, his sole entry into the race. Alboreto also ran sports prototypes for Scandia/Simon while in the United States, entering the IMSA World Sports Car Championship with a Ferrari 333 SP. He also entered the Le Mans 24 Hours in a Joest Racing-entered Porsche WSC-95 alongside fellow Italian and former F1 teammate Pierluigi Martini and Belgian Didier Theys, but retired due to an engine failure after completing 300 laps. The following year, Alboreto earned his first and only podium in the IRL at the &quot;True Value 200&quot; held in New Hampshire, where he finished third. A further fifth place at Las Vegas earned Alboreto 62 points during his 1997 campaign which resulted in a 32nd place overall in the drivers&#x27; championship.

Also in 1997, Alboreto was called to testify at the trial following Ayrton Senna&#x27;s fatal accident in 1994. He told the tribunal that, in his opinion, Senna&#x27;s accident was likely caused by a technical failure rather than a driver error.

Alboreto won the 1997 24 Hours of Le Mans with the same car as the previous year, but this time alongside Swede Stefan Johansson, another former F1 teammate, and Dane Tom Kristensen, who would later go onto beat Jacky Ickx&#x27;s record for winning the most Le Mans 24 Hour races. The trio completed 361 laps, one more than second-placed Gulf Team Davidoff&#x27;s BMW-powered McLaren F1 GTR. This would prove to be the peak of Alboreto&#x27;s sportscar success as he failed to finish at Le Mans in 1998 with Porsche once again. However, a fourth place at the 1999 24 Hours of Le Mans with the newcomer Audi, a third at the 2000 Le Mans 24 Hours, a victory at the 2000 Petit Le Mans and a win at the 2001 Sebring 12 Hours gave the Italian some final success prior to his death a month after his win at Sebring.

==Death==

In late April 2001, Alboreto and a small group of Audi engineers travelled to the EuroSpeedway Lausitz near Dresden in eastern Germany to perform a series of tests on an Audi R8 in preparation for their participation at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in June. Alboreto mainly drove the car in the area of the facility that is used for public racing events, using the tri-oval for quicker laps and the Grand Prix circuit for slower laps, but some testing also took place within the limits of the adjacent proving ground, which features an elongated oval track with two long straights.

Around 5.30 p.m. local time on 25 April 2001, Alboreto accelerated the R8 along one of the two long straights at the proving ground. When the car reached the speed of approximately , its left rear tyre failed. The R8 was subsequently launched into the air, somersaulting over the Armco barrier and landing inverted. Alboreto&#x27;s head struck the ground, killing him instantly. Initially, Audi gave no reason for the crash, stating the R8 had &quot;already completed thousands of test kilometres on numerous circuits without any problems.&quot; Five days later, an investigation into the accident was reported to have concluded. The tyre failure was attributed to a gradual loss of air pressure, caused by a loose screw that had found its way into the tyre. As there was no indication of a mechanical problem or driver error, the tyre failure was determined to be the sole cause of the crash. The finding motivated Audi to expedite the implementation of a new sensor-based TPMS in their racecars.

Alboreto&#x27;s death brought much anguish among his family and friends who had longed for him to give up racing due to its dangerous nature. Michele&#x27;s cousin Marisa told Italian news agency ANSA, &quot;You can&#x27;t imagine what we&#x27;re going through as a family. We&#x27;re really distraught.&quot;

===Legacy===
Fellow Italian Giancarlo Fisichella dedicated his podium finish at the 2005 Italian Grand Prix to Alboreto, &quot;I know Alboreto was the last Italian on the podium at Monza before me. I was lucky enough to race together with him in touring cars, and he was a great person, really special. I want to dedicate the result to his memory.&quot;

On 28 August 2021, it was announced that the final corner at the Monza Circuit, the &quot;Curva Parabolica&quot;, would be officially renamed the &quot;Curva Alboreto&quot; during the 2021 Italian Grand Prix weekend to mark the 20th anniversary of Alboreto&#x27;s death.

==Helmet==
Alboreto&#x27;s helmet was blue with a yellow stripe with white edges covering the centre of the helmet. The colours were a tribute to Swedish driver Ronnie Peterson, whose helmet design also used them to reflect the Swedish flag. Alboreto and Peterson first met in 1972 and were friends until the Swedish driver&#x27;s death in 1978.

<text>A breakwater is a permanent structure constructed at a coastal area to protect against tides, currents, waves, and storm surges. Breakwaters have been built since antiquity to protect anchorages, helping isolate vessels from marine hazards such as wind-driven waves. A breakwater, also known in some contexts as a jetty or a mole, may be connected to land or freestanding, and may contain a walkway or road for vehicle access.

Part of a coastal management system, breakwaters are installed parallel to the shore to minimize erosion. On beaches where longshore drift threatens the erosion of beach material, smaller structures on the beach may be installed, usually perpendicular to the water&#x27;s edge. Their action on waves and current is intended to slow the longshore drift and discourage mobilisation of beach material. In this usage they are more usually referred to as groynes.

==Purposes==

Breakwaters reduce the intensity of wave action in inshore waters and thereby provide safe harbourage. Breakwaters may also be small structures designed to protect a gently sloping beach to reduce coastal erosion; they are placed offshore in relatively shallow water.

An anchorage is only safe if ships anchored there are protected from the force of powerful waves by some large structure which they can shelter behind. Natural harbours are formed by such barriers as headlands or reefs. Artificial harbours can be created with the help of breakwaters. Mobile harbours, such as the D-Day Mulberry harbours, were floated into position and acted as breakwaters. Some natural harbours, such as those in Plymouth Sound, Portland Harbour, and Cherbourg, have been enhanced or extended by breakwaters made of rock.

==Types ==
Types of breakwaters include vertical wall breakwater, mound breakwater and mound with superstructure or composite breakwater.

A breakwater structure is designed to absorb the energy of the waves that hit it, either by using mass (e.g. with caissons), or by using a revetment slope (e.g. with rock or concrete armour units).

In coastal engineering, a revetment is a land-backed structure whilst a breakwater is a sea-backed structure (i.e. water on both sides).

=== Rubble ===
Rubble mound breakwaters use structural voids to dissipate the wave energy. Rubble mound breakwaters consist of piles of stones more or less sorted according to their unit weight: smaller stones for the core and larger stones as an armour layer protecting the core from wave attack. Rock or concrete armour units on the outside of the structure absorb most of the energy, while gravels or sands prevent the wave energy&#x27;s continuing through the breakwater core. The slopes of the revetment are typically between 1:1 and 1:2, depending upon the materials used. In shallow water, revetment breakwaters are usually relatively inexpensive. As water depth increases, the material requirements—and hence costs—increase significantly.

=== Caisson ===
Caisson breakwaters typically have vertical sides and are usually erected where it is desirable to berth one or more vessels on the inner face of the breakwater. They use the mass of the caisson and the fill within it to resist the overturning forces applied by waves hitting them. They are relatively expensive to construct in shallow water, but in deeper sites they can offer a significant saving over revetment breakwaters.

An additional rubble mound is sometimes placed in front of the vertical structure in order to absorb wave energy and thus reduce wave reflection and horizontal wave pressure on the vertical wall. Such a design provides additional protection on the sea side and a quay wall on the inner side of the breakwater, but it can enhance wave overtopping.

=== Wave absorbing caisson ===
A similar but more sophisticated concept is a wave-absorbing caisson, including various types of perforation in the front wall.

Such structures have been used successfully in the offshore oil-industry, but also on coastal projects requiring rather low-crested structures (e.g. on an urban promenade where the sea view is an important aspect, as seen in Beirut and Monaco). In the latter, a project is presently ongoing at the Anse du Portier including 18 wave-absorbing high caissons.

=== Wave attenuator ===
Wave attenuators consist of concrete elements placed horizontally one foot under the free surface, positioned along a line parallel to the coast. Wave attenuators have four slabs facing the sea, one vertical slab, and two slabs facing the land; each slab is separated from the next by a space of . The row of four sea-facing and two land-facing slabs reflects offshore wave by the action of the volume of water located under it which, made to oscillate under the effect of the incident wave, creates waves in phase opposition to the incident wave downstream from the slabs.

=== Membrane Breakwaters ===
A submerged flexible mound breakwater can be employed for wave control in shallow water as an advanced alternative to the conventional rigid submerged designs. Further to the fact that, the construction cost of the submerged flexible mound breakwaters is less than that of the conventional submerged breakwaters, ships and marine organisms can pass them, if being deep enough. These marine structures reduce the collided wave energy and prevent the generation of standing waves.

==Breakwater armour units==
As design wave heights get larger, rubble mound breakwaters require larger armour units to resist the wave forces. These armour units can be formed of concrete or natural rock. The largest standard grading for rock armour units given in CIRIA 683 &quot;The Rock Manual&quot; is 10–15 tonnes. Larger gradings may be available, but the ultimate size is limited in practice by the natural fracture properties of locally available rock.

Shaped concrete armour units (such as Dolos, Xbloc, Tetrapod, etc.) can be provided in up to approximately 40 tonnes (e.g. Jorf Lasfar, Morocco), before they become vulnerable to damage under self weight, wave impact and thermal cracking of the complex shapes during casting/curing. Where the very largest armour units are required for the most exposed locations in very deep water, armour units are most often formed of concrete cubes, which have been used up to ~195 tonnes for the tip of the breakwater at Punta Langosteira near La Coruña, Spain.

Preliminary design of armour unit size is often undertaken using the Hudson&#x27;s equation, Van der Meer and more recently Van Gent et al.; these methods are all described in CIRIA 683 &quot;The Rock Manual&quot; and the United States Army Corps of Engineers Coastal engineering manual (available for free online) and elsewhere. For detailed design the use of scaled physical hydraulic models remains the most reliable method for predicting real-life behavior of these complex structures.


==Unintended consequences==
Breakwaters are subject to damage and overtopping in severe storms. Some may also have the effect of creating unique types of waves that attract surfers, such as The Wedge at the Newport breakwater. 

=== Sediment effects ===
The dissipation of energy and relative calm water created in the lee of the breakwaters often encourage accretion of sediment (as per the design of the breakwater scheme). However, this can lead to excessive salient build up, resulting in tombolo formation, which reduces longshore drift shoreward of the breakwaters. This trapping of sediment can cause adverse effects down-drift of the breakwaters, leading to beach sediment starvation and increased coastal erosion. This may then lead to further engineering protection being needed down-drift of the breakwater development. Sediment accumulation in the areas surrounding breakwaters can cause flat areas with reduced depths, which changes the topographic landscape of the seabed.

Salient formations as a result of breakwaters are a function of the distance the breakwaters are built from the coast, the direction at which the wave hits the breakwater, and the angle at which the breakwater is built (relative to the coast). Of these three, the angle at which the breakwater is built is most important in the engineered formation of salients. The angle at which the breakwater is built determines the new direction of the waves (after they&#x27;ve hit the breakwaters), and in turn the direction that sediment will flow and accumulate over time.

=== Environmental effects ===
The reduced heterogeneity in sea floor landscape introduced by breakwaters can lead to reduced species abundance and diversity in the surrounding ecosystems. As a result of the reduced heterogeneity and decreased depths that breakwaters produce due to sediment build up, the UV exposure and temperature in surrounding waters increase, which may disrupt surrounding ecosystems. 


==Construction of detached breakwaters==
There are two main types of offshore breakwater (also called detached breakwater): single and multiple. Single, as the name suggests, means the breakwater consists of one unbroken barrier, while multiple breakwaters (in numbers anywhere from two to twenty) are positioned with gaps in between (). The length of the gap is largely governed by the interacting wavelengths. Breakwaters may be either fixed or floating, and impermeable or permeable to allow sediment transfer shoreward of the structures, the choice depending on tidal range and water depth. They usually consist of large pieces of rock (granite) weighing up to 10–15 tonnes each, or rubble-mound. Their design is influenced by the angle of wave approach and other environmental parameters. Breakwater construction can be either parallel or perpendicular to the coast, depending on the shoreline requirements.

<doc id="1018658" wikidata="Q1621508" url="?curid=1018658" title="Junrei">
<text>Junrei (巡礼) is the word most commonly used for either of two major types of pilgrimages in Japan, in accordance with Buddhism or Shinto. These pilgrimages can be made as a visit to a group of temples, shrines, or other holy sites, in a particular order, often in a circuit of 33 or 88 sites. Other pilgrimages may center on a pilgrimage to a single site. One of the most popular pilgrimages for Buddhists in Japan is visiting the 88 temples on Shikoku. In certain contexts, Junrei can be used to refer to other pilgrimage practices in world religions foreign to Japan, such as the Hajj.

Pilgrimages can be organized by tour bus companies, taking only a couple of weeks to complete, although many pilgrims prefer to take the two- or three-month-long journeys on foot in the traditional manner. Pilgrims on the Shikoku &quot;junrei&quot; are referred to as &quot;henro&quot; (遍路) and traditionally wear straw hats and white clothing.

==Traditional observances==
There are a number of rules traditionally observed while on a &quot;junrei&quot;.

*Say the name of Kōbō-Daishi following one&#x27;s devotion it is preceded every thing. (Kōbō-Daishi is Kūkai&#x27;s posthumous name)
*Pilgrimage as the ascetic.
*Must not kill any living things.
*Must not say immoral things to women.
*Have some medicines for your unexpected bad condition.
*Must not drink any alcohol.
*Do not quarrel with your partner.
*Do not have a lot of money.
*Do not have unnecessary baggage.
*Pay attention to your food hygiene.
*Go to an inn before it gets dark.
*Must not go out of an inn during the night.

<doc id="1018662" wikidata="Q2667233" url="?curid=1018662" title="Kadomatsu">
<text>are traditional Japanese decorations made for the New Year. They are a type of &quot;yorishiro&quot;, or objects intended to welcome ancestral spirits or &quot;kami&quot; of the harvest. &quot;Kadomatsu&quot; are usually placed in pairs in front of homes and buildings.

==Construction and placement==
Historically, &quot;kadomatsu&quot; was often made with pine wood, but these days bamboo is more common. The central portion of the &quot;kadomatsu&quot; is formed from three large bamboos, though plastic &quot;kadomatsu&quot; are available. After binding all the elements of the &quot;kadomatsu&quot;, it is bound with a straw mat and newly woven straw rope. &quot;Kadomatsu&quot; are placed in pairs on either side of the gate, representing male and female.

== Usage ==
In modern times, &quot;kadomatsu&quot; are placed after Christmas until January 7 (or January 15 during the Edo period) and are considered temporary housing (&quot;shintai&quot;) for &quot;kami&quot;. Designs for &quot;kadomatsu&quot; vary depending on region but are typically made of pine, bamboo, and sometimes ume tree sprigs which represent longevity, prosperity and steadfastness, respectively. &quot;The fundamental function of the New Year ceremonies is to honor and receive the &quot;toshigami&quot; (deity), who will then bring a bountiful harvest for farmers and bestow the ancestors&#x27; blessing on everyone.&quot; After January 15 (or in many instances the 19th) the &quot;kadomatsu&quot; is burned to appease the &quot;kami&quot; or &quot;toshigami&quot; and release them.

<text>Percy Harrison Fawcett (18 August 1867 disappeared 29 May 1925) was a British geographer, artillery officer, cartographer, archaeologist and explorer of South America. He disappeared in 1925 (along with his eldest son, Jack, and one of Jack&#x27;s friends, Raleigh Rimmel) during an expedition to find an ancient lost city which he and others believed existed in the Amazon rainforest.

==Life==
===Early life===
Percy Fawcett was born on 18 August 1867 in Torquay, Devon, to Edward Boyd Fawcett and Myra Elizabeth (née MacDougall). The Fawcetts were a family of old Yorkshire gentry (Fawcett of Scaleby Castle) who had prospered as shipping magnates in the East Indies during the late 18th and 19th centuries. Fawcett&#x27;s father had been born in India, and was a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society (RGS), while his elder brother, Edward Douglas Fawcett, was a mountain climber, Eastern occultist and the author of philosophical books and popular adventure novels.

During the 1880s, Percy Fawcett was schooled at Newton Abbot Proprietary College, alongside Bertram Fletcher Robinson, the future sportsman, journalist, writer and mutual friend of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Thereafter, he attended the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, and was commissioned as a lieutenant of the Royal Artillery on 24 July 1886. That same year, Fawcett met his future wife, Nina Agnes Paterson, whom he married in 1901 and had two sons, Jack (1903–1925?) and Brian (1906–1984), and one daughter, Joan (1910–2005). On 13 January 1896, Fawcett was appointed Adjutant of the 1st Cornwall (Duke of Cornwall&#x27;s) Artillery Volunteers, and was promoted to captain on 15 June 1897. He later served in Hong Kong, Malta and Trincomalee, Ceylon.

Fawcett joined the RGS in 1901 with the aim of studying surveying and mapmaking. Later, he worked for the British Secret Service in North Africa while pursuing the surveyor&#x27;s craft. He served for the War Office on Spike Island in County Cork from 1903 to 1906, where he was promoted to major on 11 January 1905. Fawcett became friends with authors Conan Doyle and Sir Henry Rider Haggard; the former used Fawcett&#x27;s Amazonian field reports as inspiration for his novel &quot;The Lost World&quot;.

===Early expeditions===
Fawcett&#x27;s first expedition to South America was launched in 1906 after the RGS sent him to Brazil to map an area of the jungle bordering Bolivia. The RGS had been commissioned to map the area as a third party unbiased by local national interests. Fawcett arrived in La Paz in June. While on the expedition, in 1907, he claimed to have seen and shot a long giant anaconda, a claim for which he was ridiculed by scientists. He reported other mysterious animals unknown to zoology, such as a small cat-like dog about the size of a foxhound, which he claimed to have seen twice, and the giant Apazauca spider, which was said to have poisoned a number of locals. The giant peanuts which he found in the Mato Grosso region were almost certainly &quot;Arachis nambyquarae&quot; which has legumes up to 3.5 inches (nine cm) in length.

Fawcett made seven expeditions between 1906 and 1924. He was mostly amicable with the local indigenous peoples through gifts, patience and courteous behaviour. In 1908 he traced the source of the Rio Verde (Brazil) and in 1910 made a journey to Heath River (on the border between Bolivia and Peru) to find its source, having retired from the British Army on 19 January. In 1911, Fawcett once again returned to the Amazon and charted hundreds of miles of unexplored jungle, accompanied by his trusted, longtime exploring companion, Henry Costin, and biologist and polar explorer James Murray. After a 1913 expedition, Fawcett supposedly claimed to have seen dogs with double noses. These may have been double-nosed Andean tiger hounds.

By 1914, based on documentary research, Fawcett had formulated ideas about a &quot;lost city&quot; he named &quot;Z&quot; (&quot;Zed&quot;) somewhere in the Mato Grosso. He theorized that a complex civilization once existed in the region and that isolated ruins might have survived. Fawcett also found a document known as Manuscript 512, written after explorations made in the &quot;sertão&quot; of the state of Bahia, and housed at the National Library in Rio de Janeiro. It is believed to have been authored by Portuguese &quot;bandeirante&quot; , who wrote that in 1753 he had discovered the ruins of an ancient city that contained arches, a statue and a temple with hieroglyphics; the city is described in great detail without providing a specific location. This city became a secondary destination for Fawcett, after &quot;Z&quot;.

In Brazil, Fawcett carried a jade statue of a human figure with inscriptions on the chest and feet that he claimed had supernatural powers over the indigenous tribes of the Amazon. He told Ramiro Noronha, a Brazilian general, &quot;by showing the statue, he could exercise an irresistible power over the natives.&quot; 

At the beginning of the First World War, Fawcett returned to Britain to serve with the British Army as a reserve officer in the Royal Artillery, volunteering for duty in Flanders and commanding an artillery brigade despite being nearly fifty years old. He was promoted from major to lieutenant-colonel on 1 March 1918, and received three mentions in despatches from Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, in November 1916, November 1917, and November 1918. He was also awarded the Distinguished Service Order in June 1917.

After the war, Fawcett returned to Brazil to study local wildlife and archaeology. In 1920, he made a solo attempt to search for &quot;Z&quot; but ended it after suffering from a fever and shooting his pack animal.

===Final expedition===
In 1924, Fawcett returned to Brazil with his eldest son Jack and Jack&#x27;s longtime friend, Raleigh Rimmel, for an exploratory expedition to find &quot;Z&quot;. Fawcett left instructions stating that if the expedition did not return, no rescue expedition should be sent lest the rescuers suffer his fate.

Fawcett was a man with years of experience travelling and had taken equipment such as canned foods, powdered milk, guns, flares, a sextant and a chronometer. His travel companions were both chosen for their health, ability and loyalty to each other; Fawcett chose only two companions in order to travel lighter and with less notice to indigenous tribes, as some were hostile towards outsiders.

On 20 April 1925, Fawcett&#x27;s final expedition departed from Cuiabá. In addition to Jack and Rimmel, he was accompanied by two Brazilian labourers, two horses, eight mules and a pair of dogs. The last communication from the expedition was on 29 May when Fawcett wrote, in a letter to his wife delivered by a native runner, that he was ready to go into unexplored territory with only Jack and Rimmel. They were reported to be crossing the Upper Xingu, a southeastern tributary river of the Amazon River. The final letter, written from Dead Horse Camp, gave their location and was generally optimistic.

The RGS declared and accepted the men as lost in January 1927, almost two years after the party&#x27;s last message. Soon after this declaration, a large number of volunteers offered to attempt to locate the lost explorers. Many expeditions attempting to find Fawcett failed. At least one lone searcher died in the attempt.

Many people assumed that local indigenous peoples killed Fawcett&#x27;s party, as several tribes were nearby at the time: the Kalapalos, the last tribe to have seen them; the Arumás; the Suyás; and the Xavantes, whose territory they were entering. According to explorer John Hemming, Fawcett&#x27;s party of three was too few to survive in the jungle and his expectation that his indigenous hosts would look after them was likely to have antagonized them by failing to bring any gifts to repay their generosity. 

Twenty years later, a Kalapalo chief called Comatzi told his people how unwelcome strangers were killed, but others have thought they became lost and died of starvation, and the bones provided by Comatzi turned out not to be those of Fawcett. Edmar Morel and Nilo Vellozo reported that Comatzi&#x27;s predecessor, Izarari, had told them he had killed Fawcett and his son Jack, seemingly by shooting them with arrows after Fawcett allegedly attacked him and other Indians when they refused to give him guides and porters to take him to their Chavante enemies. Rolf Blomberg reported that Izarari had told him that Rimmel had already died of fever in a Kurikuro camp. A somewhat different version came from Orlando Villas-Bôas, who reported that Izarari had told him that he had killed all three men with his club the morning after Jack had allegedly consorted with one of his wives, when he claimed that Fawcett had slapped him in the face after the chief refused his demand for canoes and porters to continue his journey.

The Kalapalo have an oral story of the arrival of three explorers which states that the three went east, and after five days the Kalapalo noticed that the group no longer made campfires. The Kalapalo say that a very violent tribe most likely killed them. However, both of the younger men were lame and ill when last seen, and there is no proof that they were murdered. It is plausible that they died of natural causes in the Brazilian jungle.

In 1927, a nameplate of Fawcett&#x27;s was found with an Indian tribe. In June 1933, a theodolite compass belonging to Fawcett was found near the Baciary Indians of Mato Grosso by Colonel Aniceto Botelho. However, the nameplate was from Fawcett&#x27;s expedition five years earlier and had most likely been given as a gift to the chief of that tribe. The compass was proven to have been left behind before he entered the jungle on his final journey.

====Dead Horse Camp====
Dead Horse Camp, or Fawcett&#x27;s Camp, was his last known location. From Dead Horse Camp, he wrote to his wife about the hardships that he and his companions had faced, his coordinates, his doubts in Rimmel, and Fawcett&#x27;s plans for the near future. He concludes his message with, &quot;You need have no fear of any failure...&quot;

One question remaining about Dead Horse Camp concerns a discrepancy in the coordinates Fawcett gave for its location. In the letter to his wife, he wrote: &quot;Here we are at Dead Horse Camp, latitude 11 degrees 43&#x27; South and longitude 54 degrees 35&#x27; West, the spot where my horse died in 1920&quot; (). However, in a report to the North American Newspaper Alliance he gave the coordinates as . The discrepancy may have been a typographical error. However, he may have intentionally concealed the location to prevent others from using his notes to find &quot;Z&quot;. It may have also been an attempt to dissuade any rescue attempts; Fawcett had stated that if he disappeared, no rescue party should be sent because the danger was too great.

==Posthumous controversy and speculations==
===Henry Costin&#x27;s opinion===
Explorer Henry Costin, who accompanied Fawcett on five of his previous expeditions, expressed his doubt that Fawcett would have perished at the hands of native indigenous people, as he typically enjoyed good relations with them. He believed that Fawcett had succumbed to either a lack of food or exhaustion.

===Rumours and unverified reports===
During the ensuing decades, various groups mounted several rescue expeditions, without success. They heard only various rumours that could not be verified.

While a fictitious tale estimated that 100 would-be-rescuers died on several expeditions attempting to discover Fawcett&#x27;s fate, the actual toll was only one—a sole man who ventured after him alone. One of the earliest expeditions was commanded by American explorer George Miller Dyott. In 1927, he claimed to have found evidence of Fawcett&#x27;s death at the hands of the Aloique, but his story was unconvincing. From 1930 to 1931, Aloha Wanderwell used her seaplane to try to land on the Paraguay River to find him. After an emergency landing and living with the Bororo tribe for six weeks, Aloha and her husband Walter flew back to Brazil, with no luck.

===Fawcett&#x27;s alleged bones===
In 1951, Orlando Villas-Bôas, activist for indigenous peoples, received what were claimed to be the actual remaining skeletal bones of Fawcett and had them analysed scientifically. The analysis supposedly confirmed the bones were Fawcett&#x27;s, but his son Brian (1906–1984) refused to accept this. Villas-Bôas claimed that Brian was too interested in making money from books about his father&#x27;s disappearance. Later scientific analysis confirmed that the bones were not Fawcett&#x27;s. As of 1965, the bones reportedly rested in a box in the flat of one of the Villas-Bôas brothers in São Paulo.

In 1998, English explorer Benedict Allen went to talk to the Kalapalo people, said by Villas-Bôas to have confessed to having killed Fawcett and his party. An elder of the Kalapalo, Vajuvi, claimed during a filmed BBC interview with Allen that the bones found by Villas-Bôas were not really Fawcett&#x27;s. Vajuvi also denied that his tribe had any part in the disappearance of the expedition. No conclusive evidence supports the latter statement.

===Villas-Bôas story===
Danish explorer Arne Falk-Rønne journeyed to Mato Grosso during the 1960s. In a 1991 book, he wrote that he learned of Fawcett&#x27;s fate from Villas-Bôas, who had heard it from one of Fawcett&#x27;s murderers. Allegedly, Fawcett and his companions had a mishap on the river and lost most of the gifts they had brought along for the Indian tribes. Continuing without gifts was a serious breach of protocol; since the expedition members were all more or less seriously ill at the time, the Kalapalo they encountered decided to kill them. The bodies of Jack and Rimmel were thrown into the river; Fawcett, considered an old man and therefore distinguished, received a proper burial. Falk-Rønne visited the Kalapalo and reported that one of the tribesmen confirmed Villas-Bôas&#x27;s story about how and why Fawcett had been killed.

===Fawcett&#x27;s signet ring===
In 1979, Fawcett&#x27;s signet ring was found in a pawnshop. A new theory is that Fawcett and his companions were killed by bandits and the bodies were disposed of in a river while their belongings were despoiled.

===Russian documentary===
In 2003, a Russian documentary film, &quot;The Curse of the Incas&#x27; Gold / Expedition of Percy Fawcett to the Amazon&quot; (), was released as a part of the television series &quot;Mysteries of the Century&quot; (). Among other things, the film emphasizes the recent expedition of Oleg Aliyev to the presumed approximate place of Fawcett&#x27;s last whereabouts and Aliyev&#x27;s findings, impressions, and presumptions about Fawcett&#x27;s fate. The film concludes that Fawcett may have been looking for the ruins of El Dorado, a city built by more advanced people from the other side of the Andes, and that the expedition members were killed by an unknown primitive tribe that had no contact with modern civilization.

===Commune in the jungle===
On 21 March 2004, &quot;The Observer&quot; reported that television director Misha Williams, who had studied Fawcett&#x27;s private papers, believed that he had not intended to return to Britain but rather meant to found a commune in the jungle, based on theosophical principles and the worship of his son Jack. Williams explained his research in some detail in the preface to his play &quot;AmaZonia&quot;, first performed in April 2004.

== In popular culture ==

In 2005, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; staff writer David Grann visited the Kalapalo and reported that it had apparently preserved an oral history about Fawcett, among the first Europeans the tribe had ever seen. The oral account said that Fawcett and his party had stayed at their village and then left, heading eastward. The Kalapalos warned Fawcett and his companions that if they went that way they would be killed by the &quot;fierce Indians&quot; who occupied that territory, but Fawcett insisted upon going. The Kalapalos observed smoke from the expedition&#x27;s campfire each evening for five days before it disappeared. The Kalapalos said they were sure the fierce natives had killed them. The article also reports that a monumental civilisation known as Kuhikugu may have actually existed near where Fawcett was searching, as discovered recently by archaeologist Michael Heckenberger and others. Grann&#x27;s findings are further detailed in his book &quot;The Lost City of Z&quot; (2009).

In 2016, James Gray wrote and directed a film adaptation of Grann&#x27;s book, with Charlie Hunnam starring as Fawcett.

In Charles MacLean&#x27;s 1982 novel &quot;The Watcher&quot;, the protagonist believes himself to be a reincarnation of Percy Fawcett, and has visions of his supposed past life, experiencing a scene in the jungle seen through Fawcett&#x27;s eyes.

Episode 133 of British horror podcast &quot;The Magnus Archives&quot; features a fictional account given by Fawcett describing the events which occurred on his final expedition.

In 2022, Vox released a 6 minute and 54 second long short documentary film onto YouTube as part of their &#x27;Atlas&#x27; video series investigating Fawcett&#x27;s journeys in the Amazon, discussing his mistakes, and the reality of the &#x27;Lost Cities&#x27; through modern technology.

<text>Sir Richard John Cartwright (December 4, 1835 – September 24, 1912) was a Canadian businessman and politician.

Cartwright was one of Canada&#x27;s most distinguished federal politicians during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He was a cabinet minister in five Liberal governments. He served in the Canadian Parliament for 43 years and 5 months, being an MP from 1867 to 1904 then a Senator until his death in 1912.
Prior to Confederation, he had served 4 years, 1 month and 15 days in the Legislative Assembly of the old Province of Canada. 
Thus, he was a legislator for more than 47 and a half years. He was a vigorous and trenchant orator, and was known as &#x27;the Rupert of debate&#x27;. In particular, his debates with his Conservative counterpart, Sir George Eulas Foster, are the stuff of Canadian Parliamentary legend.

He was a progressive. A free trader, he stood against the Conservatives&#x27; high-tariff policy. Often propounding on the inalienable right of Canadian freeman to vote for and in support of their patriotic convictions independent of any party, he favoured proportional representation via Single Transferable Voting. He supported the fight of western farmers for accessible terminal grain elevators in 1910.

==Early life==
He was born and raised in Kingston, Upper Canada in a United Empire Loyalist family, the son of Harriet Dobbs Cartwright and the grandson of Richard Cartwright, a Loyalist who was expelled from the U.S. at the time of the War of Independence. His father, Robert Cartwright, was an Anglican minister. His uncle, John Solomon Cartwright, was his father’s twin brother and a notable businessman, lawyer, banker, and politician, being a member of the last Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada and then a member of the first Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada.

Richard Cartwright was a major landowner in the area, and became prominent in Kingston&#x27;s financial community as president of the Commercial Bank of Canada. He suffered a major blow when his bank failed in 1867.

==Early political career==
Cartwright entered politics when he was elected as a Conservative Party member and supporter of John A. Macdonald in the Province of Canada&#x27;s legislative assembly in 1863. In 1867, the Province of Canada became part of the new Canadian Confederation.

In 1867, Cartwright was elected to the newly formed House of Commons of Canada, again as a Tory. He was MP for the riding of Lennox, Ontario.

==Crosses floor to join Liberals==
In the year 1869, he broke with the Conservatives over Macdonald&#x27;s appointment of Sir Francis Hincks as Minister of Finance, and crossed the floor to join the Liberal Party of Canada.

==Cabinet Minister for Mackenzie==
With the Liberal party&#x27;s victory in the 1874 election, Cartwright was appointed Minister of Finance by Prime Minister Alexander Mackenzie. He supported free trade, but sought limited tariffs as a means of generating government revenue.

==Knighted==
Cartwright was not elected in the 1878 general election but was successful in a Nov. 2, 1878 by-election in Huron Centre.

He sat in the opposition bench. (The Liberals were defeated in the 1878 election.)

In recognition of his service, he was awarded a knighthood in 1879.

From the 1887 election, he represented the riding of Oxford South.

In 1887, he called for the House of Commons to consider proportional representation.

In the 1890s, the Liberals moved away from support for unrestricted reciprocity with the United States, and Cartwright&#x27;s influence in the party diminished.

==Cabinet Minister for Laurier==

With the victory of Wilfrid Laurier&#x27;s Liberals in the 1896 election, Cartwright returned to Cabinet. Laurier denied Cartwright the finance ministry as a way of assuring Canada&#x27;s business community that the government was not going to adopt free trade. Instead, he appointed Cartwright Minister of Trade and Commerce. Cartwright also served as a Canadian member of the Anglo-American Joint High Commission to resolve diplomatic problems between Canada and the United States in 1898. Cartwright was appointed to the Imperial Privy Council in 1902.

==Senator==
In 1904, he was elevated to the Senate of Canada, but remained Trade and Commerce minister until the fall of the Laurier government in the 1911 election. In this position he introduced, in 1908, a limited system of old age annuities. Additionally, he served as Leader of the Government in the Senate from 1909 until 1911, and as Leader of the Opposition in the Senate from 1911 until his death in 1912.

==Legacy==
In the Kingston, Ontario, area, Cartwright Street and Cartwright Point are named for him and his family, in recognition of their longstanding contributions to the region. He is honoured with commemorative plaques in Kingston on King Street (at his former residence) and in Memorial Hall, City Hall.

His memories were preserved in his book Reminiscences, published in 1912.

==Family==
Sir Richard Cartwright&#x27;s eldest son, Lieutenant Colonel Robert Cartwright, studied at the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ontario from 1878 to 1881, where he won several academic prizes. He was a railway engineer in Manitoba. He served in the suppression of the 1885 Riel rebellion and in the Boer war in South Africa, where he was mentioned in dispatches four times. He served as assistant adjutant-general at militia headquarters and as a musketry officer during World War I.

==Archives==
There is a Cartwright Family Fonds with the Ontario provincial archives, consisting of documents from 1799 to 1913. The documents were generated by Richard Cartwright, his sons John Solomon Cartwright and the Reverend Robert David Cartwright, Robert&#x27;s wife Harriet (Dobbs) Cartwright and their son, Sir Richard Cartwright.

<doc id="1018676" wikidata="Q246506" url="?curid=1018676" title="Field of sets">
<text>In mathematics, a field of sets is a mathematical structure consisting of a pair formula_1 consisting of a set formula_2 and a family formula_3 of subsets of formula_2 called an algebra over formula_2 that contains the empty set as an element, and is closed under the operations of taking complements in formula_6 finite unions, and finite intersections.

Fields of sets should not be confused with fields in ring theory nor with fields in physics. Similarly the term &quot;algebra over formula_2&quot; is used in the sense of a Boolean algebra and should not be confused with algebras over fields or rings in ring theory.

Fields of sets play an essential role in the representation theory of Boolean algebras. Every Boolean algebra can be represented as a field of sets.

== Definitions ==

A field of sets is a pair formula_1 consisting of a set formula_2 and a family formula_3 of subsets of formula_6 called an algebra over formula_6 that has the following properties:

In other words, formula_3 forms a subalgebra of the power set Boolean algebra of formula_14 (with the same identity element formula_15).
Many authors refer to formula_3 itself as a field of sets. 
Elements of formula_2 are called points while elements of formula_3 are called complexes and are said to be the admissible sets of formula_19

A field of sets formula_1 is called a σ-field of sets and the algebra formula_3 is called a σ-algebra if the following additional condition (4) is satisfied: 

== Fields of sets in the representation theory of Boolean algebras ==

=== Stone representation ===
For an arbitrary set formula_22 its power set formula_23 (or, somewhat pedantically, the pair formula_24 of this set and its power set) is a field of sets. If formula_25 is finite (namely, formula_26-element), then formula_23 is finite (namely, formula_28-element). It appears that every finite field of sets (it means, formula_1 with formula_3 finite, while formula_2 may be infinite) admits a representation of the form formula_24 with finite formula_25; it means a function formula_34 that establishes a one-to-one correspondence between formula_3 and formula_23 via inverse image: formula_37 where formula_38 and formula_39 (that is, formula_40). One notable consequence: the number of complexes, if finite, is always of the form formula_41

To this end one chooses formula_25 to be the set of all atoms of the given field of sets, and defines formula_43 by formula_44 whenever formula_45 for a point formula_46 and a complex formula_47 that is an atom; the latter means that a nonempty subset of formula_48 different from formula_48 cannot be a complex.

In other words: the atoms are a partition of formula_2; formula_25 is the corresponding quotient set; and formula_43 is the corresponding canonical surjection.

Similarly, every finite Boolean algebra can be represented as a power set – the power set of its set of atoms; each element of the Boolean algebra corresponds to the set of atoms below it (the join of which is the element). This power set representation can be constructed more generally for any complete atomic Boolean algebra.

In the case of Boolean algebras which are not complete and atomic we can still generalize the power set representation by considering fields of sets instead of whole power sets. To do this we first observe that the atoms of a finite Boolean algebra correspond to its ultrafilters and that an atom is below an element of a finite Boolean algebra if and only if that element is contained in the ultrafilter corresponding to the atom. This leads us to construct a representation of a Boolean algebra by taking its set of ultrafilters and forming complexes by associating with each element of the Boolean algebra the set of ultrafilters containing that element. This construction does indeed produce a representation of the Boolean algebra as a field of sets and is known as the Stone representation. It is the basis of Stone&#x27;s representation theorem for Boolean algebras and an example of a completion procedure in order theory based on ideals or filters, similar to Dedekind cuts.

Alternatively one can consider the set of homomorphisms onto the two element Boolean algebra and form complexes by associating each element of the Boolean algebra with the set of such homomorphisms that map it to the top element. (The approach is equivalent as the ultrafilters of a Boolean algebra are precisely the pre-images of the top elements under these homomorphisms.) With this approach one sees that Stone representation can also be regarded as a generalization of the representation of finite Boolean algebras by truth tables.

=== Separative and compact fields of sets: towards Stone duality ===

* A field of sets is called separative (or differentiated) if and only if for every pair of distinct points there is a complex containing one and not the other.
* A field of sets is called compact if and only if for every proper filter over formula_2 the intersection of all the complexes contained in the filter is non-empty.

These definitions arise from considering the topology generated by the complexes of a field of sets. (It is just one of notable topologies on the given set of points; it often happens that another topology is given, with quite different properties, in particular, not zero-dimensional). Given a field of sets formula_54 the complexes form a base for a topology. We denote by formula_55 the corresponding topological space, formula_56 where formula_57 is the topology formed by taking arbitrary unions of complexes. Then

* formula_55 is always a zero-dimensional space.
* formula_55 is a Hausdorff space if and only if formula_60 is separative.
* formula_55 is a compact space with compact open sets formula_3 if and only if formula_60 is compact.
* formula_55 is a Boolean space with clopen sets formula_3 if and only if formula_60 is both separative and compact (in which case it is described as being descriptive)

The Stone representation of a Boolean algebra is always separative and compact; the corresponding Boolean space is known as the Stone space of the Boolean algebra. The clopen sets of the Stone space are then precisely the complexes of the Stone representation. The area of mathematics known as Stone duality is founded on the fact that the Stone representation of a Boolean algebra can be recovered purely from the corresponding Stone space whence a duality exists between Boolean algebras and Boolean spaces.

== Fields of sets with additional structure ==

=== Sigma algebras and measure spaces ===

If an algebra over a set is closed under countable unions (hence also under countable intersections), it is called a sigma algebra and the corresponding field of sets is called a measurable space. The complexes of a measurable space are called measurable sets. The Loomis-Sikorski theorem provides a Stone-type duality between countably complete Boolean algebras (which may be called abstract sigma algebras) and measurable spaces.

A measure space is a triple formula_67 where formula_1 is a measurable space and formula_69 is a measure defined on it. If formula_69 is in fact a probability measure we speak of a probability space and call its underlying measurable space a sample space. The points of a sample space are called sample points and represent potential outcomes while the measurable sets (complexes) are called events and represent properties of outcomes for which we wish to assign probabilities. (Many use the term sample space simply for the underlying set of a probability space, particularly in the case where every subset is an event.) Measure spaces and probability spaces play a foundational role in measure theory and probability theory respectively.

In applications to Physics we often deal with measure spaces and probability spaces derived from rich mathematical structures such as inner product spaces or topological groups which already have a topology associated with them - this should not be confused with the topology generated by taking arbitrary unions of complexes.

=== Topological fields of sets ===

A topological field of sets is a triple formula_71 where formula_56 is a topological space and formula_1 is a field of sets which is closed under the closure operator of formula_57 or equivalently under the interior operator i.e. the closure and interior of every complex is also a complex. In other words, formula_3 forms a subalgebra of the power set interior algebra on formula_76

Topological fields of sets play a fundamental role in the representation theory of interior algebras and Heyting algebras. These two classes of algebraic structures provide the algebraic semantics for the modal logic &quot;S4&quot; (a formal mathematical abstraction of epistemic logic) and intuitionistic logic respectively. Topological fields of sets representing these algebraic structures provide a related topological semantics for these logics.

Every interior algebra can be represented as a topological field of sets with the underlying Boolean algebra of the interior algebra corresponding to the complexes of the topological field of sets and the interior and closure operators of the interior algebra corresponding to those of the topology. Every Heyting algebra can be represented by a topological field of sets with the underlying lattice of the Heyting algebra corresponding to the lattice of complexes of the topological field of sets that are open in the topology. Moreover the topological field of sets representing a Heyting algebra may be chosen so that the open complexes generate all the complexes as a Boolean algebra. These related representations provide a well defined mathematical apparatus for studying the relationship between truth modalities (possibly true vs necessarily true, studied in modal logic) and notions of provability and refutability (studied in intuitionistic logic) and is thus deeply connected to the theory of modal companions of intermediate logics.

Given a topological space the clopen sets trivially form a topological field of sets as each clopen set is its own interior and closure. The Stone representation of a Boolean algebra can be regarded as such a topological field of sets, however in general the topology of a topological field of sets can differ from the topology generated by taking arbitrary unions of complexes and in general the complexes of a topological field of sets need not be open or closed in the topology.

==== Algebraic fields of sets and Stone fields ====

A topological field of sets is called algebraic if and only if there is a base for its topology consisting of complexes.

If a topological field of sets is both compact and algebraic then its topology is compact and its compact open sets are precisely the open complexes. Moreover, the open complexes form a base for the topology.

Topological fields of sets that are separative, compact and algebraic are called Stone fields and provide a generalization of the Stone representation of Boolean algebras. Given an interior algebra we can form the Stone representation of its underlying Boolean algebra and then extend this to a topological field of sets by taking the topology generated by the complexes corresponding to the open elements of the interior algebra (which form a base for a topology). These complexes are then precisely the open complexes and the construction produces a Stone field representing the interior algebra - the Stone representation. (The topology of the Stone representation is also known as the McKinsey–Tarski Stone topology after the mathematicians who first generalized Stone&#x27;s result for Boolean algebras to interior algebras and should not be confused with the Stone topology of the underlying Boolean algebra of the interior algebra which will be a finer topology).

=== Preorder fields ===

A preorder field is a triple formula_77 where formula_78 is a preordered set and formula_1 is a field of sets.

Like the topological fields of sets, preorder fields play an important role in the representation theory of interior algebras. Every interior algebra can be represented as a preorder field with its interior and closure operators corresponding to those of the Alexandrov topology induced by the preorder. In other words, for all formula_80:
formula_81 and
formula_82 

Similarly to topological fields of sets, preorder fields arise naturally in modal logic where the points represent the &quot;possible worlds&quot; in the Kripke semantics of a theory in the modal logic &quot;S4&quot;, the preorder represents the accessibility relation on these possible worlds in this semantics, and the complexes represent sets of possible worlds in which individual sentences in the theory hold, providing a representation of the Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra of the theory. They are a special case of the general modal frames which are fields of sets with an additional accessibility relation providing representations of modal algebras.

==== Algebraic and canonical preorder fields ====

A preorder field is called algebraic (or tight) if and only if it has a set of complexes formula_83 which determines the preorder in the following manner: formula_84 if and only if for every complex formula_85, formula_86 implies formula_87. The preorder fields obtained from &quot;S4&quot; theories are always algebraic, the complexes determining the preorder being the sets of possible worlds in which the sentences of the theory closed under necessity hold.

A separative compact algebraic preorder field is said to be canonical. Given an interior algebra, by replacing the topology of its Stone representation with the corresponding canonical preorder (specialization preorder) we obtain a representation of the interior algebra as a canonical preorder field. By replacing the preorder by its corresponding Alexandrov topology we obtain an alternative representation of the interior algebra as a topological field of sets. (The topology of this &quot;Alexandrov representation&quot; is just the Alexandrov bi-coreflection of the topology of the Stone representation.) While representation of modal algebras by general modal frames is possible for any normal modal algebra, it is only in the case of interior algebras (which correspond to the modal logic &quot;S4&quot;) that the general modal frame corresponds to topological field of sets in this manner.

=== Complex algebras and fields of sets on relational structures===

The representation of interior algebras by preorder fields can be generalized to a representation theorem for arbitrary (normal) Boolean algebras with operators. For this we consider structures formula_88 where formula_89 is a relational structure i.e. a set with an indexed family of relations defined on it, and formula_90 is a field of sets. The complex algebra (or algebra of complexes) determined by a field of sets formula_91 on a relational structure, is the Boolean algebra with operators
formula_92
where for all formula_93 if formula_94 is a relation of arity formula_95 then formula_96 is an operator of arity formula_26 and for all formula_98
formula_99

This construction can be generalized to fields of sets on arbitrary algebraic structures having both operators and relations as operators can be viewed as a special case of relations. If formula_3 is the whole power set of formula_2 then formula_102 is called a full complex algebra or power algebra.

Every (normal) Boolean algebra with operators can be represented as a field of sets on a relational structure in the sense that it is isomorphic to the complex algebra corresponding to the field.

(Historically the term complex was first used in the case where the algebraic structure was a group and has its origins in 19th century group theory where a subset of a group was called a complex.)

<doc id="1018689" wikidata="Q277583" url="?curid=1018689" title="Kakemono">
<text>A , more commonly referred to as a , is a Japanese hanging scroll used to display and exhibit paintings and calligraphy inscriptions and designs mounted usually with silk fabric edges on a flexible backing, so that it can be rolled for storage. The origin is said to date back to the Nara period (710-794).

The &quot;Maruhyōsō&quot; style of kakejiku has four distinct named sections. The top section is called the &quot;ten&quot; heaven. The bottom is the &quot;chi&quot; earth with the &quot;hashira&quot; pillars supporting the heaven and earth on the sides. The maruhyōsō style, also contains a section of &quot;ichimonji&quot; made from &quot;kinran&quot; gold thread. On observation, the Ten is longer than the Chi. This is because in the past, Kakemono were viewed from a kneeling (seiza) position and provided perspective to the &quot;Honshi&quot; main work. This tradition carries on to modern times.

There is a cylindrical rod called &quot;jikugi&quot; (軸木) at the bottom, which becomes the axis or center of the rolled scroll. The end knobs on this rod are in themselves called &quot;jiku&quot;, and are used as grasps when rolling and unrolling the scroll.

Other parts of the scroll include the &quot;jikubo&quot; referenced above as the &quot;jikugi&quot;. The top half moon shaped wood rod is named the &quot;hassō&quot; to which the &quot;kan&quot; or metal loops are inserted in order to tie the &quot;kakehimo&quot; hanging thread. Attached to the jikubo are the &quot;jikusaki&quot;, the term used for the end knobs, which can be inexpensive and made of plastic or relatively decorative pieces made of ceramic or lacquered wood. Additional decorative wood or ceramic pieces are called &quot;fuchin&quot; and come with multicolored tassels. The variation in the kakehimo, jikusaki and fuchin make each scroll more original and unique.

The arrival of &quot;kakemono&quot; to the Spanish colonies in the Philippines and the Americas prompted local artists to imitate the format as a convenient way to provide portable art.

<text>James Lorimer Ilsley (3 January 1894 – 14 January 1967) was a Canadian politician and jurist. He was minister of finance from 1940 to 1946. He was finance minister during World War II; to fund the increase in wartime expenditure, he dramatically expanded the income tax by imposing it on millions of workers and citizens.

== Early life ==

He was born in Somerset, Nova Scotia, the son of Randel Ilsley and Catherine Caldwell. Ilsley was educated at Acadia University where he served as Editor-In-Chief of the university newspaper The Athenaeum. He then attended Dalhousie University and was admitted to the Nova Scotia bar in 1916. In 1919, he married Evelyn Smith. Ilsley then practised law in Yarmouth and Halifax, Nova Scotia until 1926.

== Political career ==

He was elected to the House of Commons of Canada as a Liberal in the 1926 election. He survived the 1930 election that sent the Liberals into Opposition. When the Liberal Party returned to power in the 1935 election, Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King brought Ilsley into Cabinet as Minister of National Revenue.

=== Finance minister ===

In 1940, he was promoted to Minister of Finance. He held that position for the duration of World War II during a period of massive expansion in expenditure due to the war effort, described as a &quot;transformation of the Canadian tax system&quot; by historian Colin Campbell. Under his direction, the minimum income required to pay income tax was push dramatically downward, effectively changing income tax from a &quot;class tax&quot; on the wealthiest 300,000 or so Canadians to a national tax imposed on millions of average workers, and directly deduced from their checks. The revenue generated from income tax during this era expand by nearly 1000%.

He also led the Victory Bond campaign, brought in wage and price controls in 1941, and deal with several currency crises. He was also known for his call for personal sacrifice by civilians during the war and led by example by giving up his car and riding the streetcar to Parliament Hill. In 1945, despite the taxes he had imposed on the general public, he was rated the most popular cabinet minister in the cabinet.

He was recognized for his service in 1946 when he was appointed to the Imperial Privy Council, and given the honorific of &quot;Right Honourable&quot;.

=== Minister of justice ===

The same year, he became Minister of Justice. He served in that position until he retired from politics in 1948.

== Later life ==

Illsley retired from politics in 1948. The next year, he was appointed to the Nova Scotia Supreme Court and became Chief Justice of Nova Scotia in 1950. He served in that capacity until his death in 1967 in Halifax at the age of 73.

J. L. Ilsley High School, opened in 1971 and located in Spryfield, Nova Scotia, bears his name.

<doc id="1018692" wikidata="Q5508406" url="?curid=1018692" title="Fulton Chain of Lakes">
<text>The Fulton Chain of Lakes is a string of eight lakes located in the Adirondack Park in upstate New York, United States. The chain is the dammed-up Moose River, and the dam which creates the chain holds back nearly of water. The lakes are located in Herkimer and Hamilton Counties. Inlet, Old Forge, and Eagle Bay are towns on them. The chain begins near Old Forge and ends before it reaches Raquette Lake. The lakes are named for Robert Fulton, inventor of the steamboat, who proposed connecting the lakes to create an Adirondack canal. They are suitable for pontoon boats (the most popular type in the area), kayaks, and motorboats. The chain is part of the Northern Forest Canoe Trail, which begins on First Lake and ends in Fort Kent, Maine.

== Geography == 
The lakes in the chain have been given ordinal designations: First Lake, Second Lake, Third Lake, Fourth Lake, Fifth Lake, Sixth Lake, Seventh Lake, and Eighth Lake. The chain begins with a small lake not counted in the series called Old Forge Pond. In reality, First, Second and Third Lake are one long lake separated by narrow straits. At the east end of Fourth Lake, by Inlet in Hamilton County, a stream, or channel, allows access to the small Fifth Lake. A portage is necessary to arrive at Sixth Lake, which is also connected by a narrow strait to Seventh Lake. Another portage is required to gain access to Eighth Lake.

Beyond Eighth Lake is Raquette Lake and another string of lakes in Indian Lake, New York.

=== Expansions in 1798 ===

The lakes were expanded from to in 1798 when the Moose River was dammed at Old Forge. The present dam at Old Forge holds back of water. This reservoir is managed by the HR-BR Regulating District. In the late 1800s, the State Water Power Commissioner made an agreement with Fulton Chain cottage owners and recreational users to maintain the water level during the summer season, an agreement still in effect.

Prior to World War II, the town of Inlet boasted fourteen Adirondack hotels. The Woods Inn is now the only historic hotel remaining open year round. Boating is a popular activity in the Fulton Chain of Lakes because any aspects of the lakes are accessible by water. For example, the restaurants of The Woods Inn, Great Pines (Formerly Northwoods Inn), Daikers, and the Screamen Eagle are all accessible by boat, you can also get to Inlet and Old Forge by boat. A very popular type of boat in the Adirondacks is the pontoon boat because many people enjoy relaxing on the lakes. Also fishing boats because of the vast numbers of types of fish and areas of the lakes to be able to fish. The lakes sport decent populations of gamefish including northern pike, lake trout, rainbow trout, brook trout, landlocked (Atlantic) salmon, largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, yellow perch, brown bullhead, tiger muskie and various panfish. Tubing, skiing, knee boarding, and wake boarding are all common water recreational activities that are seen while on the Fulton Chain of Lakes. In addition to boating, snowmobiling is also very popular in the region during the Winter. Although the Fulton Chain of Lakes are not technically part of the snowmobile trails, once frozen many snowmobilers use them to access the same restaurants noted above.

== Adirondack Canoe Classic ==
The Fulton Chain is the start of the Adirondack Canoe Classic, a three-day, canoe race. This canoe race is for anyone from beginners to experts, it is a way to get the community together and to get everyone involved with something. Many kids (usually older kids) will go with their parents and form a team. Many people train very hard for this 90 mile race, however some teams just go out there for the comradery of it all and just to have fun with friends. However, it is a rigorous course and includes three days of physical activity and hard work for participants.

== Hiking ==
Hiking is a popular activity in the Adirondack Park because of the high numbers and varieties of hikes available. Some of the varieties of hikes include anything from the High Peaks to the relatively flat hikes of Sis and Bub. Bald Mountain is one of the most popular mountains to hike not only by the Fulton Chain of Lakes but also in the Adirondacks as a whole due to the views of the entire chain. At the top of this mountain there is the Rondaxe Fire Tower that has been restored to allow hikers to climb to the top of it in order to enhance the views of the Fulton Chain of Lakes. Sis and Bub lakes is a relatively flat hike, it has some inclination however it is nothing too drastic. This hike is good for families with younger children because it is not very rigorous or challenging. Another hike is the Sis, Bub, and Moss Lake trail, it is a full loop that connects Sis and Bub lakes to Moss Lake, this hike is very suitable for families and is primarily flat.

== Surrounding towns ==
Inlet is located at the “head of Fourth Lake” and this is where it gets its name from because it is near the inlet of the fourth of the eight lakes. Inlet is a small town that includes Kalil’s Grocery Store, a post office, a realtor’s office, restaurants, other stores and a baseball field. Many of the businesses in the town are family owned and run.

Eagle Bay is a small town that is also located on Fourth lake and includes a neighborhood full of cabins. The town includes restaurants, a laundromat, and a fire station. The neighborhood of Eagle Bay is a small, quaint place where the homes are on mainly square plots set back in the woods, however some of them are waterfront. There are two community beaches that are accessible to homeowners of the neighborhood, as well as boat slips that are available for purchase with the property.

Old Forge is the biggest of the three towns adjacent to the lakes and is also located at the beginning of the Fulton Chain of Lakes, by the Old Forge Pond. In Old Forge there are grocery stores, restaurants, souvenir stores, realtors offices, and a fire station. Old Forge is a well known town all throughout the Adirondacks and especially around the Fulton Chain of Lakes. There is also a motel located right above the Old Forge Pond. A well-known water park called Enchanted Forest Water Safari is a very popular tourist attraction in Old Forge and is the largest water park in New York state.

<text>Arrowhead Springs is a highly mountainous neighborhood in the municipality of San Bernardino, California, officially annexed to the city on November 19, 2009. The neighborhood lies below the Arrowhead geological monument, which is California Historical Landmark #977.

This possibly indigenously carved Geoglyph on a geologic formation of light quartz on the side of Arrowhead Peak. It presides over San Bernardino and the rest of the San Bernardino Valley. The city of Lake Arrowhead, California and the adjacent lake, Lake Arrowhead Reservoir, take their names from the formation as does Arrowhead Water. The Native Americans of the San Bernardino Valley thought the Arrowhead pointed to the artesian hot springs below, which are the site of the historic Arrowhead Springs Hotel, Spa, &amp; Bungalows. The region is also home to the Arrowhead Country Club and Golf Course.

The Arrowhead landmark itself is at .

==Arrowhead Springs Hotel and Spa==

The historic Arrowhead Springs Hotel and Spa, located in the Arrowhead Springs neighborhood, encompasses directly beneath the Arrowhead geological monument that presides over the San Bernardino Valley. The present building was designed by architects Gordon B. Kaufmann and Paul R. Williams. The resort contains hot springs, in addition to mineral baths and steam caves located deep underground. It featured a Pacific Electric &quot;Red Car&quot; rail line connecting the hotel to San Bernardino and the Greater Los Angeles area. Long the headquarters for Campus Crusade for Christ, the site remained largely vacant and unused since their operations moved to Florida. In May 2016, the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians purchased the Arrowhead Springs property.

In 1924, architect Arthur B. Benton, designed a rustic concrete entrance archway encased in ornamental boulders. The archway stood 15 feet high with a 26-foot span. It appears the arch location was at .

==Future==
The specific plan for the future of the site includes: a new 115-room annex to the existing 135-room hotel; a new 300-room lakefront hotel; new reservoirs and a reconfiguration of the Lake Vonette; new vineyards, along with the Windy Point restaurant and wine-tasting site; a new 18-hole golf course; 36 new custom estates on fairway-adjacent lots; of commercial space, 34 apartment suites built to condominium standards, and 266 condominiums, townhomes, and single-family attached homes in the new Village Walk mixed-use lifestyle center; 300 new condominiums, townhomes, and/or senior apartments in an upscale retirement village; a new spa resort; 429 condominiums, townhomes, and single-family detached homes located adjacent to the golf course; commercial stables at a new polo club and equestrian center; extensive multi-purpose trails and watercourses; a public botanical garden; of private parks; a new office complex; a new conference center; and, of commercial space and 285 condominiums, townhomes, and single-family attached homes in the Hilltown development. Existing facilities on the grounds include: a cinema; ten private bungalows previously owned by such people as Eleanor Roosevelt, Lucille Ball, the Marx Brothers, Judy Garland, Elizabeth Taylor, and Humphrey Bogart; an outdoor amphitheater; a wedding chapel; the Esther Williams Pool and Cabanas; the Hill Auditorium; several ballrooms; a guard house; tennis courts; and the Hacienda.

<doc id="1018701" wikidata="Q2188827" url="?curid=1018701" title="Hanging scroll">
<text>A hanging scroll is one of the many traditional ways to display and exhibit East Asian painting and calligraphy. They are different from handscrolls, which are narrower and designed to be viewed flat on a table.

Hanging scrolls are generally intended to be displayed for short periods of time, after which they are rolled up and tied for storage. They are traditionally rotated according to season or occasion, rather than be on permanent display. Their artwork could be mounted with decorative brocade silk borders. The craft of creating a hanging scroll is considered an art in itself.

==History==
Scrolls originated in their earliest form from texts written on bamboo strips and silk banners across ancient China. The earliest hanging scrolls are related to and developed from silk banners in early Chinese history. These banners were long and hung vertically on walls. Such silk banners and hanging scroll paintings were found at Mawangdui dating back to the Han dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE). The aesthetic and structural objectives for hanging scrolls were summarized by the time of the Tang dynasty (618–907) and are still followed in the present day. During the early Song dynasty (960–1279), artists found that hanging scrolls were well suited to their art styles.

Originally introduced to Japan from China as a means of spreading Buddhism, hanging scrolls found a place in Japanese culture and art and plays an important role in interior decoration.

==Description==
Hanging scrolls provide a vertical format to display art on walls. They are one of the most common types of scrolls for Chinese painting and calligraphy. They are made in many different sizes and proportions. Horizontal hanging scrolls are also a common form.

Hanging scrolls are different from the handscrolls. A handscroll is a long narrow scroll for displaying a series of scenes in Chinese painting. It intended to be viewed section for section, flat on a table, during its unrolling. In contrast, a hanging scroll is appreciated in its entirety.

==Mounting styles==

There are several hanging scroll styles for mounting, such as:
* &quot;Yisebiao&quot; (一色裱, one color mount)
* &quot;Ersebiao&quot; (二色裱, two color mount)
* &quot;Sansebiao&quot; (三色裱, three color mount)
* &quot;Xuanhezhuang&quot; (宣和裝, Xuanhe style), also known as &quot;Songshibiao&quot; (宋式裱, Song dynasty mount)

==Arrangements and formats==

Besides the previous styles of hanging scroll mountings, there are a few additional ways to format the hanging scroll.

*Hall painting (中堂畫)
: A hall painting is intended to be the centerpiece in a main hall. It is usually large, serves as a focal point in an interior, and often has a complicated subject.

*Four hanging scrolls (四條屏)
:These hanging scrolls were developed from screen paintings. They comprise several narrow and long hanging scrolls usually hung next to each other on a wall, but they can also be hung separately. Their subjects have related themes, such as the &quot;Four Gentlemen&quot; (orchid, bamboo, chrysanthemum, plum blossom) or the &quot;Four Beauties&quot; (ladies renowned for their beauty).

*Panoramic screen (通景屏)
:The panoramic screen consists of several hanging scrolls that have continuous images, in which the subject continues further in another scroll. These hanging scrolls cover large areas of a wall and usually do not have a border in between.

*Couplet (對聯)
:A couplet is two hanging scrolls placed side by side or accompanying a scroll in the middle. They have calligraphy in vertical writing. This style became popular during the Ming dynasty (1368–1644).

*Thin strip painting (條幅畫)
:Narrow strip paintings intended for smaller rooms and spaces.

==Features and materials==

Chinese mounting and conservation techniques are considered a traditional craft and are believed to have developed around 2,000 years ago. This craft is considered an art unto itself. Careful attention was and still is paid to ensure the quality and variety of the silk and paper to protect and properly fit the artwork onto the mounting, as it gives form to the art. The art is fixed onto a four-sided inlay, made from paper or silk, thus providing a border.

The artwork in the middle of the scroll is called &quot;huaxin&quot; (畫心; literally &quot;painted heart&quot;). There is sometimes a section above the artwork called a &quot;shitang&quot; (詩塘; literally &quot;poetic pool&quot;), which is usually reserved for inscriptions onto the work of art, ranging from a short verse to poems and other inscriptions. These inscriptions are often done by people other than the artist. Although inscriptions can also be placed onto the material of the artwork itself. The upper part of the scroll is called &quot;tiantou&quot; (天頭; symbolizing &quot;Heaven&quot;) and the lower part is called &quot;ditou&quot; (地頭; symbolizing &quot;Earth&quot;).

At the top of the scroll is a thin wooden bar, called &quot;tiangan&quot; (天杆), on which a cord is attached for hanging the scroll. Two decorative strips, called &quot;jingyan&quot; (惊燕; literally &quot;frighten swallows&quot;), are sometimes attached to the top of the scroll. At the bottom of the scroll is a wooden cylindrical bar, called &quot;digan&quot; (地杆), attached to give the scroll the necessary weight to hang properly onto a wall, but it also serves to roll up a scroll for storage when the artwork is not in display. 
The two knobs at the far ends of the lower wooden bar are called &quot;zhoutou&quot; (軸頭) and help to ease the rolling of the scroll. These could be ornamented with a variety of materials, such as jade, ivory, or horn.

==Method and processes==
Traditional scroll mounters go through a lengthy process of backing the mounting silks with paper using paste before creating the borders for the scroll. Afterwards, the whole scroll is backed before the roller and fittings are attached. The whole process can take two weeks to nine months depending on how long the scroll is left on the wall to dry and stretch before finishing by polishing the back with Chinese wax and fitting the rod and roller at either end. This process is generally called &#x27;wet mounting&#x27; due to the use of wet paste in the process.

In the late 20th century a new method was created called &#x27;dry mounting&#x27; which involves the use of heat activated silicone sheets in lieu of paste which reduced the amount of time from a few weeks to just a few hours. This new method is generally used for mass-produced artwork rather than serious art or conservation as mounting done this way tends not to be as robust as wet mounting whose scrolls can last for over a century before it requires remounting.

<doc id="1018704" wikidata="Q648099" url="?curid=1018704" title="Grand Theft Auto Advance">
<text>Grand Theft Auto Advance (also marketed as Grand Theft Auto) is a 2004 action-adventure game developed by Digital Eclipse and published by Rockstar Games. The eighth entry in the &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; series, it was released for the Game Boy Advance in October 2004. The game takes place in Liberty City (a fictional parody of New York City), the same setting used for &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot;, to which it serves as a prequel. The story, set one year before &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot;, follows small-time criminal Mike&#x27;s quest for revenge after his partner&#x27;s supposed death, which leads him to become entangled in a world of organised crime, gang warfare, and corruption.

The game is played from a top-down perspective, similar to the style used in &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; and &quot;Grand Theft Auto 2&quot;; despite this, it is part of the series&#x27; &quot;3D universe&quot; canon, sharing continuity with the three-dimensional games of the franchise. It also features most gameplay elements of the 3D &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; games, including the vehicle-based side-missions, most weapons, the use of safe houses, and the style of the heads-up display. The game received mixed reviews from critics, and was followed by &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories&quot;, another &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot; prequel, in 2005.

== Gameplay ==
&quot;Grand Theft Auto Advance&quot; is an action-adventure game set in an open world environment and played from a top-down perspective. The game had to be adapted to the Game Boy Advance&#x27;s hardware limitations. As a result, it does not have animated cutscenes, nor does it have &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot;″s much-lauded pedestrian dialogue. All cutscenes are text-only with hand-drawn pictures of the characters&#x27; faces, with a thematic backdrop behind. The art style is consistent with that used for the cover and loading art of the three-dimensional releases in the series. Replacing the pedestrian dialogue, some soundbites taken from &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot; are played when the player hits someone&#x27;s car. Short police radio voiceovers will announce the player&#x27;s location and vehicle type when the player commits a crime.

The game does not feature radio channels. Like the Game Boy Color ports of &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; and &quot;Grand Theft Auto 2&quot;, each car has one fixed tune that is constantly repeated and cannot be changed. These include parts of some familiar &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot;, &quot;Grand Theft Auto 2&quot; and &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot; tunes, in instrumental versions. Despite this, billboards for the radio stations featured in &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot; can be seen throughout Liberty City.

== Synopsis ==
=== Setting and characters ===

The game is set in 2000 within Liberty City, the same setting used in &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot;. As the setting had to be recreated for the Game Boy Advance, much of it was noticeably changed in its conversion, including elements that were impossible to interpret to from the game&#x27;s top-view perspective. As a result of these changes, players familiar with the original setting have to explore it afresh in &quot;Grand Theft Auto Advance&quot;.

As a prequel to &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot;, the game features both new and returning characters. The protagonist is an original character named Mike, who in his quest to avenge the supposed death of his partner, Vinnie, crosses paths with several prominent criminals that offer him assistance. These include explosives expert and firearms trader 8-Ball, Yardies leader King Courtney, and yakuza co-leader Asuka Kasen, all previously featured in &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot;, although their characters received significant changes in appearance and lifestyle to reflect who they were one year prior.

=== Plot ===
Small-time criminal Mike works for the more connected criminal Vinnie in hopes of leaving Liberty City with him and retiring from their life of crime. Vinnie convinces Mike to do work for the Mafia to achieve this goal. However, after several jobs, Vinnie is seemingly killed in a car bomb explosion, which also destroys all their money. Mike vows revenge, and quickly falls out with the Mafia as he investigates Vinnie&#x27;s murder. After carrying out some jobs for 8-Ball, an explosives expert and old acquaintance of Vinnie&#x27;s, he points Mike to a bartender named Jonnie, who maintains connections with the city&#x27;s criminal underworld and might help him find the answers he seeks. Jonnie hires Mike for several jobs while they investigate Vinnie&#x27;s murder together, until the former is suddenly killed midway through the investigation.

While searching for the killer, Mike spots some Yardies leaving Jonnie&#x27;s bar in a rush, and follows them to their leader, King Courtney. Courtney denies involvement in Jonnie&#x27;s murder, claiming that his men were only sent to collect money Jonnie owed to him, and offers to help find the true culprit. After carrying out some jobs for him, Courtney points Mike to Colombian Cartel leader Cisco. When Mike confronts Cisco, however, he quickly realizes that the man is innocent, and that Courtney has been using him all along to eliminate his rivals. Mike then begins working separately for the Cartel and their main rivals, the yakuza, led by Asuka Kasen, in hopes either gang will aid his investigation. After Cisco is suddenly killed, Mike pursues the murderer, and is shocked to find a still-living Vinnie, who reveals that he faked his own death to flee Liberty City with their money, and killed both Jonnie and Cisco to ensure Mike never learned the truth. Enraged at his former partner&#x27;s betrayal, Mike kills Vinnie and steals his money, despite Vinnie&#x27;s warnings that every criminal in the city will now target him for his wealth.

While meeting with 8-Ball to tell him how his investigation ended, Mike is attacked by the Cartel, who mistakenly assumed that he had killed Cisco. Although Mike escapes the attack, 8-Ball is injured during the shootout and subsequently arrested by the police. After dealing with the Cartel&#x27;s new leader, Mike learns that Courtney is after his money and meets with Asuka one final time to plan an ambush at Courtney&#x27;s hideout. However, the yakuza fail to show up for the attack, leaving Mike to face Courtney on his own (in one of the instances, the yakuza will provide cover for Mike once he confronts King Courtney provided he gets into the hideout within the stipulated time). Mike fends off the waves of Yardie attacks and then gravely injures Courtney but before he can finish him off, the police raid Courtney&#x27;s hideout, forcing Mike to make his escape. After evading the police, Mike goes to the airport and leaves Liberty City in Cisco&#x27;s private plane. He reminisces his fallen friends and heads to Colombia to start a new life with his wealth.

== Reception ==

&quot;Grand Theft Auto Advance&quot; received &quot;mixed or average&quot; reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic.

The graphics of the game received mixed to positive commentary from critics, who likened it to other Game Boy Advance games. Craig Harris of &quot;IGN&quot; said that the game &quot;does a good job of looking like the old &quot;GTA&quot; games.&quot; Loki of &quot;Game Chronicles&quot; said that the game uses &quot;plenty of tricks&quot; to give it a &quot;3D feel,&quot; and that there&#x27;s a &quot;real sense of depth and perspective as you gaze down upon Liberty City.&quot; Conversely, &quot;1UP&quot; staff said that the game has &quot;flat visuals&quot; that are a &quot;poor leap&quot; compared to previous games in the &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; series.

The game&#x27;s music received mixed reactions. &quot;IGN&quot;″s Craig Harris said that the songs on the radio stations in the vehicles are &quot;pretty repetitive and aren&#x27;t so great.&quot; &quot;1UP.com&quot;″s Scott Sharkey stated that the music is &quot;pretty bad,&quot; and named the radio tracks &quot;very short and repetitive.&quot; Jeff Gerstmann of &quot;GameSpot&quot; commented on the camera movements while driving, and that it &quot;doesn&#x27;t zoom out far enough to give you a good view of the road.&quot;

<doc id="1018727" wikidata="Q4744300" url="?curid=1018727" title="American Labor Party">
<text>The American Labor Party (ALP) was a political party in the United States established in 1936 that was active almost exclusively in the state of New York. The organization was founded by labor leaders and former members of the Socialist Party of America who had established themselves as the Social Democratic Federation (SDF). The party was intended to parallel the role of the British Labour Party, serving as an umbrella organization to unite New York social democrats of the SDF with trade unionists who would otherwise support candidates of the Republican and Democratic parties.

Before and after its demise, many ALP members joined the Liberal Party of New York (LPNY) and the Progressive Party.

==History==
===Establishment===
The Socialist Party of America suffered an internal struggle between the right-wing Old Guard and left-wing. In May 1936, the Old Guard broke from the party and formed the Social Democratic Federation (SDF), taking &quot;The Forward&quot; with them. The SDF formed the People&#x27;s Party in New York.

In his 1944 memoir, Waldman wrote:Back from Detroit, I was immediately confronted with a problem which involved millions of dollars of property controlled by subsidiaries of the Socialist Party. In New York alone there were such institutions as the &quot;Jewish Daily Forward&quot;, the leading Jewish newspaper in the world with a circulation running into hundreds of thousands and with reserve funds amounting to millions. There was &quot;The New Leader&quot;, a weekly newspaper published in English; there was the Rand School of Social Science, which, together with Camp Tamiment, had enormous property value, not to speak of their importance as propaganda and educational instruments. Control of the &quot;Forward&quot; alone also meant probable control of fraternal and labor organizations such as the Workmen&#x27;s Circle, with its millions of dollars in property and tens of thousands of members throughout the United States... After Detroit it was obvious that the militant Socialists controlled the Socialist Party. I saw that all they had to do in order to gain control of the valuable property in New York was to revoke the New York State charter and expel all state organizations controlled by the Social Democrats or the Old Guard. Since there was always a minority of militant Socialists in each of these corporate institutions, these properties involving millions of dollars in property value and cash reserves would quickly fall into the hands of the militants... All during 1935 and the early part of 1936 my office was converted into a meeting place for the various committees and members of the organizations threatened by the militants. Constitutions and bylaws were modified in such a way as to prevent control falling into the hands of Norman Thomas&#x27; super-revolutionists. -- Louis Waldman, &quot;Labor Lawyer.&quot; 

On April 1, 1936, Sidney Hillman, John L. Lewis, and other officials of the unions of the American Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations established Labor&#x27;s Non-Partisan League (LNPL), an organization akin to the modern political action committee, designed to channel money and manpower to the campaigns of Roosevelt and others standing strongly for the declared interests of organized labor.

Max Zaritsky, a union president, suggested forming a political party from the Labor&#x27;s Non-Partisan League of the Congress of Industrial Organizations to David Dubinsky and Sidney Hillman. Zaritsky, Hillman, Dubinsky, Luigi Antonini and Isidore Nagler of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union, Louis Hollander of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, Baruch Charney Vladeck and Alexander Kahn of &quot;The Forward&quot;, and Louis Waldman of the SDF met at the Brevoort Hotel to discuss the plan. The party&#x27;s name, American Labor Party, was suggested by Nagler. The SDF agreed to join the initiative.

Antonini was the first state chairman of the party, serving from 1936 until 1942. James Farley, chair of the New York State Democratic Committee, and Edward J. Flynn, chair of the DNC, did not support the party, but Franklin D. Roosevelt ordered the Democrats to aid the ALP in collecting enough signatures for party status. During the summer of 1936, the New York state organization of LNPL was transformed into an independent political party in an effort to bolster Roosevelt&#x27;s electoral chances in the state by gaining him a place on a second candidate ballot line. 274,924 voted for Roosevelt using the ALP&#x27;s ballot line in the 1936 presidential election, with 238,845 coming from New York City. The largest amount of support came from Jewish areas.

===Rise and internal struggles===

The organization was largely funded by the needle trade unions of the state. The ALP found itself $50,000 in debt at the end of the 1936 campaign, but substantial contributions from labor groups erased the red ink. The ILGWU itself contributed nearly $142,000 to the 1936 campaign, a relatively huge sum for a third party campaign, given that only $26,000 from all sources had been raised and spent by Norman Thomas&#x27; Socialist campaign in the previous presidential election. Over 200 unions were affiliated with the ALP by 1937. Party decision-making in the first year was handled by ILGWU executive secretary Fred Umhey, the Amalgamated Clothing Workers Union&#x27;s Jacob Potofsky, and Alex Rose of the Milliners&#x27;.

The party supported Fiorello La Guardia during the 1937 New York City mayoral election and he received 482,790, 21.6% of the popular vote, on their ballot line. They were the second-largest party in the city and largest in some districts in the Bronx and Brooklyn.

Members of the Communist Party USA started joining the party and Israel Amter, chair of the Communist Party, called for the &quot;building of the American Labor Party&quot;. Although its constitution specifically barred Communists from the organization, there was no enforcement for this provision and large numbers flocked to registration as ALP members from the Communist-led United Electrical Workers, Transport Workers, and State, County, and Municipal Workers. Norman Thomas and the Socialists attempted to enter the party in 1937, but faced opposition. Algernon Lee opposed their entrance due to Thomas&#x27; pacifism.

Communists in the ALP opposed reelecting Roosevelt in the 1940 presidential election and the party&#x27;s leadership started an attempt to remove them from the party. The party condemned the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. Fights broke out at the party&#x27;s convention on September 14, 1940, where Roosevelt was given the nomination despite an attempted resolution condemning Roosevelt.

Vito Marcantonio was a supporter of the Soviet Union.

Labor activists Victor Alter and Henryk Ehrlich were executed by the Soviets. Anti-communists in the ALP condemned their deaths while communists defended the Soviet Union. This debate was one of the major issues in the party&#x27;s county committee elections in 1943, and the left-wing gained control over the Bronx affiliate.

Hillman, a member of the left-wing, threatened to have the ACWA become involved in the 1944 state committee elections if the party&#x27;s leadership voted against a proposal to increase union control over the party. The right-wing rejected it. Adolf A. Berle and Eleanor Roosevelt supported the party&#x27;s right-wing while Franklin Roosevelt wanted to avoid conflict between the factions. La Guardia proposed a compromise in which the state executive committee would be divided between the factions and no communist would be on the election slate. Hillman accepted the proposal, but Dubinsky rejected it. The left-wing won 620 of the 750 committee seats.

The Liberal Party of New York was formed in opposition to the ALP by Paul Blanshard, August Claessens, Harry W. Laidler, and others.

===Decline===
The passage of the Wilson Pakula prevented candidates from the ALP from being able to run for the nominations of other parties without the approval of the party&#x27;s committee. The party lost two state legislators in the 1948 election, but Marcantonio was able to win reelection solely on the American Labor ballot line.

In 1941, American Laborite Joseph V. O&#x27;Leary was appointed New York State Comptroller by Governor Herbert H. Lehman both to recognize the ALP&#x27;s previous and to maintain the party&#x27;s future support. In 1944 the Congress of Industrial Organization&#x27;s Greater New York Industrial Union Council, a federation of unions in New York City, formally linked itself to the ALP. The GNYIUC Executive Board &quot;adopted a resolution directing GNYIUC Community Councils, which had been organizing around community issues in neighborhoods throughout the city, to merge into the local ALP clubs,&quot; and the &quot;GNYIUC diverted some of its PAC monies directly to the ALP.&quot; With this move, the CIO&#x27;s largest labor federation, consisting of approximately 200 locals and 600,000 members, was formally connected to the ALP. Over the ensuing years, the council would call for local unions to ‘‘Build the American Labor Party, the strongest voice for labor in city and state affairs,’’ and would direct Political Action Stewards in workplaces across the city to ‘‘recruit shop members for active participation in the community activities of the American Labor Party.’’ This support would be instrumental in building the political capacity of the ALP and would ultimately lead to conflicts with the national CIO during the 1948 presidential election.

In 1947, several ALP leaders defected. On October 9, 1947, Charles Rubinstein, president of the United Civic Associations of the Bronx, member of the ALP&#x27;s State executive committee, and former ALP candidate for the City Council left the ALP for no other party, due to &quot;misguided Communist sympathizers&quot; within the ALP. On the same day, George Salvatore, vice chairman of the ALP&#x27;s Bronx executive committee and former ALP candidate for District Attorney and Supreme Court Justice, left the ALP for the Democratic Party, citing &quot;we are tending to become apologists for Russia&#x27;s point of view.&quot; The next day, October 10, 1947, Eugene Huber resigned as executive secretary of the ALP&#x27;s Bayside area to join the Liberal Party of New York State because, Huber said, he had found &quot;affixed a stranglehold by the Communist party upon the ALP which has in consequence become a mere envelope for Communist policies and candidates.&quot;

The ALP endorsed Henry A. Wallace&#x27;s position on the Soviet Union after he was dismissed from President Harry S. Truman&#x27;s cabinet. Vito Marcantonio supported giving the party&#x27;s presidential ballot line to Wallace while Jacob Potofsky opposed it and left the party in protest. Wallace previously rejected third-party politics at a speech before the ALP on May 25, 1946, when he stated that &quot;because of the election laws in any states, it would give a reactionary victory by dividing the votes of the progressives&quot;. The CIO called for all of its ALP-affiliated unions to disaffiliate and ACWA withdrew its support of the ALP after the party endorsed Wallace for president. Mike Quill, president of the Transport Workers Union of America, broke away from the party stating that &quot;the screwballs and crackpots who will continue to carry on as if the Communist Party and the American Labor Party were the same house with two doors&quot;.

In 1948, Tammany Hall formed the United Laborite Party, a paper party, meant to draw votes away from the ALP, but the courts ruled in favor of the ALP and stated that the party violated laws prohibiting similarly named parties.

Marcantonio won a seat again to the United States House of Representatives, representing East Harlem for the ALP, as he had done in 1938, 1940, 1942, 1944, and 1946 (but lost in 1950). Marcantonio had been the target of the New York Wilson Pakula Act in 1947 aimed at restricting candidates from one party running in another party&#x27;s primary election (electoral fusion). Leo Isacson was elected in early 1948 to fill a vacancy in a Bronx district but lost in the general election in November. The Communist Party USA openly endorsed the Progressive Party; some ALP candidates that year were known or alleged communists, e.g., Lee Pressman. Candidates included (winners bolded):
* United States House of Representatives: Marjorie Viemeister (1st District), Richard T. Mayes (2nd District) Herbert A. Shingler (3rd District), Thomas J.

===Demise===
The party lost its ballot access after John T. McManus, their 1954 gubernatorial candidate, received less than 50,000 votes. Marcantonio criticized communists for being the reason behind the party&#x27;s poor performance. He claimed that the party&#x27;s poor performance was due to their poor performance in the 1953 New York City mayoral election. He claimed that communists sabotaged the mayoral campaign by implying that they approved voting for the Liberal candidate.

Marcantonio lost reelection in the 1950 election. He resigned as chair and left the party in November 1953, due to disputes with Communist leaders who he claimed were no longer interested in third-party politics. The party dissolved in 1956.

<text>Beam-riding, also known as Line-Of-Sight Beam Riding (LOSBR), beam guidance or radar beam riding is a technique of directing a missile to its target by means of radar or a laser beam. The name refers to the way the missile flies down the guidance beam, which is aimed at the target. It is one of the simplest guidance systems and was widely used on early missile systems, however it had a number of disadvantages for long-range targeting and is now found typically only in short-range roles.

==Basic concept==
Beam riding is based on a signal that is pointed towards the target. The signal does not have to be powerful, as it is not necessary to use it for tracking as well.
The main use of this kind of system is to destroy airplanes or tanks. First, an aiming station (possibly mounted on a vehicle) in the launching area directs a narrow radar or laser beam at the enemy aircraft or tank. Then, the missile is launched and at some point after launch is “gathered” by the radar or laser beam when it flies into it. From this stage onwards, the missile attempts to keep itself inside the beam, while the aiming station keeps the beam pointing at the target. The missile, controlled by a computer inside it, “rides” the beam to the target.

==Radar beam riding==
Beam riding is one of the simplest methods of missile guidance using a radar. It was widely used for surface-to-air missiles in the post-World War II era for this reason. An early example was the British Brakemine, first tested in 1944, as was the first commercially available SAM, the Oerlikon Contraves RSA.

Early tracking radars generally use a beam a few degrees wide, which makes it easy to find the target as it moves about. Unfortunately, this makes the beam too wide to accurately attack the target, where measurements on the order of of a degree are required. To perform both operations in a single radar, some additional form of encoding is used. For WWII-era systems this was either lobe switching, or more commonly by the second half of the war, conical scanning. Conical scanning works by splitting the single radar beam in two, and comparing the return strength in the two beams to determine which is stronger. The radar is then rotated towards the stronger signal to re-center the target. The antenna is spun so that this comparison is being carried out all around the target, allowing it to track in both altitude and azimuth. Systems that performed this automatically were known as &quot;lock on&quot; or &quot;lock follow&quot;.

Beam riding systems can be easily adapted to work with such a system. By placing receiver antennas on the rear of the missile, the onboard electronics can compare the strength of the signal from different points on the missile body and use this to create a control signal to steer it back into the center of the beam. When used with conical scanning, the comparison can use several sets of paired antennas, typically two pairs, to keep itself centered in both axes. This system has the advantage of offloading the tracking to the ground radar; as long as the radar can keep itself accurately pointed at the target, the missile will keep itself along the same line using very simple electronics.

The inherent disadvantage of the radar beam riding system is that the beam spreads as it travels outward from the broadcaster (see inverse square law). As the missile flies towards the target, it, therefore, becomes increasingly inaccurate. This is not a problem at short ranges, but as many early surface-to-air missiles were designed to work at long ranges, this was a major issue. For example, earlier versions of the RIM-2 Terrier missile introduced in the 1950s were beam riders, but later variants employed semi-active radar homing to improve their effectiveness against high-performance and low-flying targets. In contrast to beam riding, semi-active guidance becomes &quot;more&quot; accurate as the missile approaches the target.

Another issue is the guidance path of the missile is essentially a straight line to the target. This is useful for missiles with a great speed advantage over their target, or where flight times are short, but for long-range engagements against high-performance targets the missile will need to &quot;lead&quot; the target in order to arrive with enough energy to do terminal manoeuvres. A possible solution for this problem was to use two radars, one for tracking the target and another for guiding the missile, but this drove up implementation costs. A more common solution for long-range missiles was to guide the missile entirely independently of the radar, using command guidance, as was the case for the Nike Hercules. Pure radar beam riding was rare by 1960.

==Laser beam riding==
Beam riding guidance based systems became more common again in the 1980s and 90s with the introduction of low-cost and highly portable laser designators. Due to the shorter wavelengths used, a laser beam can be projected with a much narrower angular resolution than a radar beam while not requiring a significant increase in the size of the projector&#x27;s aperture when compared to other optical devices being used by a typical guidance system for precision-guided munitions. Because of this, it is possible to spatially encode additional information in a beam using digital or electro-optical means, which has a number of advantages. Missiles with small optical receivers on their tail can beam-ride on lasers with similar ease as earlier radar beam systems, but will be inherently more accurate due to the higher spatial resolution of the beam&#x27;s encoding at the target.

Additionally, because the beam is usually projected directly onto the missile&#x27;s receiver, an order of magnitude less intensity is needed than a semi-active design where the target must be &quot;painted&quot; and the missile must detect the laser&#x27;s diffuse reflection from the target. The lower intensity requirement of laser beam riding systems compared to semi-active laser homing systems can make them significantly more difficult for a target&#x27;s laser warning receivers to detect. Very low power signals can be used.

In modern use, laser beam riding is generally limited to short-range missiles, both anti-air and anti-tank. Examples include ADATS, the Starstreak, the RBS 70, Russian 9K121 Vikhr and 9M119 Svir, Ukrainian Skif and Stuhna-P ATGMs.
