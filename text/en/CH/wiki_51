<text>Suburban Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll is the third studio album (fourth counting the then-unreleased &quot;Love You More than Football&quot;) by Space, released on 8 March 2004. It is their first proper album release since 1998&#x27;s &quot;Tin Planet&quot;. The tracks &quot;Zombies&quot;, &quot;Suburban Rock &#x27;N&#x27; Roll&quot; and &quot;20 Million Miles from Earth&quot; were released as singles, all of them failing to reach top 40.

On &quot;Suburban Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; Space sought to diverge from the lush, elaborate pop sound of their two previous albums, &quot;Tin Planet&quot; and &quot;Love You More than Football&quot;, by embracing a more stripped back, sample-driven style. Frontman Tommy Scott&#x27;s lyrical themes also shifted from character-driven stories to focus more on social commentary, with an overarching theme expressing anxieties towards suburban life and the growing impact of survelliance on society. The band also reunited with producer Stephen Lironi, who produced their debut album &quot;Spiders&quot;, and is credited as songwriter of a few tracks. &quot;Suburban Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; is the first Space album with no techno/electronic instrumentals from Franny Griffiths, as the band wanted to create a more cohesive listening experience.

Reception to &quot;Suburban Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; was mixed: whilst some critics praised the more mature sound than previous efforts, others considered it a disappointment and questioned the band&#x27;s longevity and place in the current musical landscape. However, it was generally well-received by fans, and is considered a personal favourite by members of the band. The band disbanded in 2005, a year after its&#x27; release.

==Background==

After touring and promotional commitments of their second album &quot;Tin Planet&quot; concluded in late 1998, Space returned to the studio to commence work on their third album, tentatively titled &quot;Love You More than Football&quot;. However, Gut Records objected to Edwyn Collins being chosen as producer, and forced the band to rework the material several times, delaying its release for over two years. A taster single from the album, &quot;Diary of a Wimp&quot;, was released in June 2000, but was poorly received by critics and peaked outside the top 40, the band&#x27;s first single to do so since &quot;Neighbourhood&quot; in early 1996.

Meanwhile, Gut were having massive success with Tom Jones&#x27;s album &quot;Reload&quot; (which Space participated in), and promoting it became top priority for the company. Label boss Guy Holmes was no longer communicating with the band on a regular basis, which led to them feeling they were being sidelined by the label. This resulted in an altercation between frontman Tommy Scott and Holmes, which served to further strain their partnership.

The long hiatus between albums and lack of substantial material also began affecting the band&#x27;s ability to play live, as former guitarist/vocalist Jamie Murphy recalls: &quot;When it was 3rd album time, I think we&#x27;d been away from it all for about a year and we had a tour while we had nothing out. We were doing 2000 capacity venues and there&#x27;d only be 400 people there. So we were going onstage every night going, &quot;What the fuck&#x27;s going on here? What have we done wrong?”.

Eventually, the album were scrapped in July 2001. By that time, the band had terminated their contract with Gut. According to Scott, it took the band a year to get out of it. &quot;One of the problems we had in the past was that we felt we were being pushed in the wrong direction – like they were trying to turn us into The Beautiful South or something, when in fact we never wanted that at all, we just wanted to be a cult band&quot;. Meanwhile, Jamie Murphy, who was growing estranged from the others, was dismissed from the line-up. According to Murphy, because tensions were running high at the time, the exchange was never made face-to-face between his bandmates, and was informed only by the management that he was out of the group. The recordings for &quot;Love You More than Football&quot; primarily existed as a bootleg, courtesy of a promotional CD-R which circulated around May 2000, before an official remixed version was released in 2019.

As a result, Space, now reduced to a four-piece and out of a record label, retreated to the studio for a couple of years, sporadically releasing several songs as MP3s free of charge to download through their website, becoming amongst the first major groups to do so. These tracks showcased a more experimental side to the band, and were eventually collated as the &quot;Music for Aliens&quot; EP.

==Recording==
The recording sessions for &quot;Suburban Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; took place between June and July 2002 at Highfield Street Studios in Liverpool. Stephen Lironi, who had previously worked with the band on their debut album &quot;Spiders&quot;, was brought on as producer, as well as contributing additional guitar and keyboard parts, with Gerald &quot;Ged&quot; Lynch providing percussion. Bassist Dave &#x27;Yorkie&#x27; Palmer co-produced early mixes of the tracks prior to Lironi&#x27;s involvement.

In comparison to the fraught &quot;Love You More than Football&quot; sessions, the band found the experience &quot;cleansing&quot; and recording with Lironi productive. As the band were still unsigned at the time of recording, they were excited to just be working on songs without any constraints or outside pressure from record labels. According to Tommy Scott, up to 40 song ideas were brought to the studio, before the group eventually settled on a concise, eleven song track listing. As is tradition, out-takes from the sessions would later end up as B-sides or &quot;Music for Aliens&quot; tracks. Doug Trantow engineered and mixed the album, and the final mix was mastered by Alan Yoshida at Ocean Way Studios in Hollywood.

==Composition==

===Lyrics===

In a webcast interview in 2003, Yorkie elaborated on the concept of &quot;Suburban Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;: &quot;The album basically deals with the subject of surveillance and a certain loss of freedom in modern society. On different levels from like the tiny sort of restrictive signs you see everywhere like you know: no ball games, no trespassing, no dogs, no cycling, clean it up to more oppressive things on a larger scale such as cameras in the back of police vans, helicopters with cameras in. Generally the whole idea that even though you may think you live in the most idyllic place every place comes with its own restrictions that prohibit you doing certain things and we just found it interesting because it seems to be an unnameable group of people who put these restrictions into place, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be by general consensus.&quot;

Most of the lyrics was inspired by Tommy Scott&#x27;s feelings of raising a family in West Derby, a suburban area in Liverpool, and how it parallels with having grown up on a council estate plagued by high levels of crime and unemployment (as previously discussed in the song &quot;Neighbourhood&quot;), as well as his opinions and experiences in the music industry. Whilst speaking with Scott in the &quot;Liverpool Daily Post&quot;, writer Philip Key noted that &quot;Suburbanites sometimes feel they are living in a world surrounded by CCTV with young kids on the rampage trying to destroy it. It&#x27;s a world which Scott suggests knocks the youthful rebellious feeling out of people as they grow older and better off. He likes to consider he is still a rebel but it&#x27;s a complex situation which the new album considers.&quot;

Scott singled out the album&#x27;s lead single &quot;Zombies&quot;, a self-described &quot;electro-punk&quot; song, as a key example of the record&#x27;s themes: &quot;Basically, it&#x27;s our little dig against the voyeuristic society that we all seem to be trapped in at the moment: &quot;Big Brother&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;, &quot;Popstars&quot;, even &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, &quot;EastEnders&quot;, etc. People seem to forget that they have their own lives to lead. We&#x27;ve all become a bit numb to real experience.&quot;

===Sound===

Whilst recording &quot;Suburban Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;, the band made a conscious decision not to repeat the sound of their last two albums, and set out to explore more experimental methods, with a greater emphasis on sampling. Jamie Murphy&#x27;s departure affected the direction of the music, as Yorkie noted: &quot;Some of the tracks have no noticeable guitar whereas you know Jamie being a proper sort of guitar hero type person wouldn&#x27;t allow that, it would, if there was a space there for guitar there would be guitar. So its a little bit sparser, maybe a little bit more disciplined the sound and its allowed I think texture wise like the keyboards and other things that we use like the samples to come through a bit more.&quot; The band credited the New York synth punk duo Suicide as a big influence on the album, and would often listen to their debut album on their way to the studio, providing inspiration for the track &quot;Pretty Suicide&quot;.

Keyboardist Franny Griffiths defended the album&#x27;s lack of dance tracks, which had been somewhat of a tradition on previous Space releases: &quot;For me it&#x27;s better. People might say why&#x27;s there no dance tracks or maybe there&#x27;s no Yorkie tracks, but I think when you listen back to it you&#x27;ll see why them things aren&#x27;t on it because its more consistent, even though it&#x27;s all our different ideas, it&#x27;s at a better blend, it runs better and you can listen to each track after each other no problem. You&#x27;re not jumping from one track to another, you want to actually listen to it from start to finish.&quot;

==Release==

&quot;Suburban Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; was released in March 2004. The band had initially proposed for it to be released through producer Stephen Lironi&#x27;s label Mutant, who had already released the album&#x27;s lead single &quot;Zombies&quot; in November 2002 almost 18 months earlier. However, the label began to experience financial problems, so at the end of 2003, after a brief spell at Sanctuary Records, the band eventually signed a deal with RandM Records, a label formed by veteran music industry executives Mike Andrews and Roy Eldridge from within the Chrysalis Group.

The band also ran into problems having the album artwork approved. The original sleeve was intended to depict a suburban household from the point of view of a sniper&#x27;s target, but the band had lost the rights to use the original photograph. Instead, a series of collages created by Tommy Scott were used as the artwork for the album and its accompanying singles. The eyes on the cover are lifted from a promotional still of German actor Conrad Veidt in his portrayal of Cesare from the film &quot;The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari&quot;, which Scott has referred to as his favourite film.

Three singles were issued from &quot;Suburban Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;: &quot;Zombies&quot;, &quot;Suburban Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; and &quot;20 Million Miles from Earth&quot;. &quot;Suburban Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; was the only single that managed to chart in top 75, peaking at a lukewarm #67 in the UK, and the only one to receive an official music video, although an animated clip for &quot;20 Million Miles from Earth&quot; was released on the band&#x27;s website. The band had shot a video for &quot;Zombies&quot; in late 2002, but was not released officially until it was uploaded by the user Davey Kirkham, who offered to remaster the footage with the band&#x27;s permission, to YouTube on March 8, 2024, to commemorate the album&#x27;s 20th anniversary. The album itself failed to chart altogether.

==Reception and aftermath==

Reception to &quot;Suburban Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; was mixed: &quot;The Independent&quot; reacted to it warmly, calling it a &quot;mature, absorbing work&quot; consisting of &quot;intelligent pop songs in the mould of Pulp and Squeeze, wry refractions of contemporary life which, they&#x27;ll probably be chagrined to hear, have potential hit appeal&quot;. Meanwhile, Dominic Willis of &quot;Rock TV&quot; wrote &quot;songwriter and head honcho Tommy Scott lets it all flood out with a collection that&#x27;s high on humour and musical invention. Scott likes to fascinate and confound by mixing and matching genres and, as with his Liverpudlian forebear John Lennon, his interests stretch right back to the British music hall tradition. Thanks to his keen grasp of melody, this makes &quot;Suburban Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; an intriguing listen. Space have lost none of their famed idiosyncrasies, and their odd take on a strange world is as perceptive and entertaining as ever.&quot;

&quot;York Press&quot; gave the album three stars, stating, &quot;Having lost guitarist Jamie Murphy, and parted company with major label Gut Records, the older and wiser Space are back in action on their own terms - but you can&#x27;t help thinking their time has been and gone.&quot; However, they applauded the band&#x27;s decision to shed much of &quot;the irritating cartoonishness of old&quot; and that they were &quot;now after cult status and creative freedom, not a return to chart success. So &quot;Suburban Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; is not the embarrassment it could have been&quot;.

However, others such as Chris Long of the BBC were much more critical: &quot;The major mistake lies where it always has with Space, deep in the heart of the ever-so clever clever sub-Paul Heaton witticisms, that hurtle at your ears like a sixth form poetry show. Quite what possessed Randm to put up the cash for &quot;Suburban Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; is anyone&#x27;s guess, but they really shouldn&#x27;t have. This is less a case of releasing a new album, than inflicting one.&quot;, whilst Tim DiGravina of AllMusic remarked, &quot;&quot;Suburban Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; is charming enough and even quite lovable in medium-sized doses, but one expects more from Space than an album of above-average and agreeably raucous tunes. For a band that once supplied highly addictive and grandiose gestures, they seem too content here to merely wink and pose.&quot;

At the time of the album&#x27;s release, Space had already set to work on a follow-up entitled &quot;Flies&quot;, and had premiered several of its songs at gigs in 2004. However, after the band decided to call it a day in 2005, the album never materialised, though a provisional tracklisting appeared on their website.

Looking back on &quot;Suburban Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; in 2022, both Tommy Scott and Yorkie declared it to be their favourite Space album, though acknowledged that, having been absent in the limelight for almost six years, its lack of success was down to poor timing, and its sound being at odds with the music scene at the time, which contributed to the band&#x27;s split.

In 2025, &quot;Suburban Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; was reissued on red vinyl for the first time as a limited run of 250 copies through Hug Records.

<doc id="1025227" wikidata="Q3543286" url="?curid=1025227" title="Pilita Corrales">
<text>Pilar Garrido Corrales (born August 22, 1939) is a Filipino pop singer, songwriter, actress, comedian and television presenter. She is best-known for her distinctive backbend when singing and is popularly referred to as the &quot;Asia&#x27;s Queen of Songs&quot; for her vocal style and longevity.

Hailed as the &quot;Greatest singer in the Philippines&quot; by the media and critics, Corrales has already recorded 135 albums throughout her six-decade career. Her recordings have mainly been in English and Filipino, while on occasion she records songs in Spanish and Cebuano. Her success would later extend to film and television, where her show &quot;An Evening with Pilita&quot; is considered as one of the standards in Philippine broadcasting history. She is a recipient of the prestigious &#x27;Lifetime Achievement Award&#x27; by the Philippine Association of the Record Industry (PARI) for introducing Filipino musical artistry to a global audience.

Lauded for her sweet voice and iconic singing style, Corrales was one of the first superstars in Philippines and became one of the first female artists to reach the top of the Australian pop charts. In 1963, her single &quot;A Million Thanks to You&quot; became one of the few songs by local artists to reach number one on the Philippine chart in the 1960s. She was also the first Filipino to win an international music festival at the first Tokyo Music Festival in 1972. She is recognized as one of the &#x27;Great Dames of Victorian Radio and Television&#x27; and has a street named after her in Melbourne, Australia. She was also honored with an honorary Doctorate in Music degree by the University of Visayas for her contribution to the Philippine music industry. In a career spanning over six decades, Corrales has released a string of signature hits including &quot;Kapantay ay Langit&quot; and &quot;A Million Thanks to You&quot;, which have since become standards.

==Life and career==
===Early life===
Pilar Garrido Corrales was born on August 22, 1939, at Lahug, Cebu City, to José Corrales and María Garrido.
Her cousin, Annie Corrales, was Miss Philippines in 1957 and married the businessman Eddie Woolbright.
After finishing her studies at Colegio de la Inmaculada Concepción in Cebu, she went to a finishing school (charm school) in Spain at the Colegio Mayor de Padre Poveda.

===Career===
In 1957, Corrales began her recording career after arriving in Australia for a brief period. She became a star of the Victoria Television circuit and her first hit, &quot;Come Closer to Me&quot;, became part of a collection on which she is billed as one of the &quot;Grand Dames of Victorian Radio and Television&quot;. She also recorded at least three LPs in the late 1950s and early 1960s: &quot;Pilita with Arthur Young: Pilita Tells the Story of Love&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ll Take Romance&quot; and &quot;This Is Pilita&quot; under Astor Records. Being one of the pioneers of Australia&#x27;s early television years, a street was named after her in Victoria. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) featured Corrales and several pioneering female artists in Australia in the 2nd episode of the highly acclaimed TV special, &quot;Love is in the Air&quot;. Corrales returned to Manila in 1963 to pursue a career in the Philippine music industry. Her Philippine career began when she hosted a radio program &quot;La Taverna&quot; over DZPI where she sang Spanish songs and played the guitar. She performed regularly in stage shows at the Manila Grand Opera House. She also appeared in movies, most of them musicals. Her film debut was a lead role in the 1968 film &quot;Miss Wawaw&quot; and was followed by 11 films for the next two years. Corrales later recorded songs in Spanish in the early 1960s as well as songs in English, Tagalog and Cebuano during the 1970s under Vicor Music Corporation.

Corrales frequently performed for &quot;Seeing Stars with Joe Quirino&quot; on IBC-Channel 13 after the martial law years where she demonstrated her range as a gifted performer of Spanish, English, Cebuano and Tagalog music. Aquarius Record Philippines produced a compilation of Pilita&#x27;s Spanish songs on CDs like &quot;Noche de Ronda&quot;, &quot;Vaya Con Dios&quot;. Her signature song &quot;A Million Thanks to You&quot; by Alice Doria-Gamilla was translated into seven languages. She eventually recorded songs composed by Filipino composers like Danny Holmsen, George Canseco, Willy Cruz, Ryan Cayabyab and several others. Under Vicor Records, Corrales interpreted numerous Filipino classics and introduced them to younger audiences. Corrales first met Canseco in &quot;Your Evening with Pilita&quot; (aired on pre-Martial Law ABS-CBN) as a guest in the composers&#x27; portion of the show&quot;. For the show Canseco brought with him &quot;You&#x27;re All I Love.&quot; Canseco later wrote Filipino lyrics for the song, which became &quot;Kapantay ay Langit&quot;, the first song Canseco sold to a record label in 1966. The song was first recorded by Amapola aka Maria Cabase for the movie theme of &quot;Kapantay ay Langit&quot; starring Marlene Dauden and Eddie Rodríguez. The song won for George Canseco and Amapola the Manila Film Festival award for best song of the year. The song did not fare well commercially, because Amapola had left (for her U.S. concert tours) and the song was not promoted properly, according to Canseco during an interview with the Philippine Daily Inquirer. But when Corrales revived the song, it turned into a classic and defied trends and time. &quot;The song,&quot; Corrales said, &quot;was included in my album &quot;Philippine Love Songs Vol. 1&quot;, which was released in the early 1970s.&quot;

Through the personal invitation of Sammy Davis Jr., Corrales became the first Filipino to sing at Caesars Palace. In her concert at Caesars Palace, Las Vegas during the late 1970s, Corrales sang Spanish, English, Cebuano, and Tagalog songs, all conducted and arranged by Ryan Cayabyab. After receiving a 1965 Philippine Citizen&#x27;s Award for TV as Best TV Female Performer, Corrales went on to receive &quot;Cecil&quot;, &quot;Aliw&quot;, &quot;Tinig&quot; and &quot;Awit&quot; and several other awards for her performances and lifetime achievement. In 1990, she received a Merit Award from the &quot;FAMAS&quot; Awards. In 1991, she was given a Lifetime Achievement Award by the Philippine Association of the Record Industry (PARI) for bringing Filipino musical artistry to an international audience. She was the first Filipino to win at an international music festival by bagging the Best Performer Award during the 1st Tokyo Music Festival (1972) where she bested numerous international artists, including Olivia Newton-John. She operates a restaurant bar in Greenhills named Pilita&#x27;s. In 2006, Corrales was selected by Associated Broadcasting Company (ABC Channel 5, now TV5, formerly The 5 Network) and FremantleMedia to be one of the celebrity judges for the first-ever nationwide search for the &quot;Philippine Idol&quot; together with composer Ryan Cayabyab and rapper Francis Magalona. She was a judge in the first &quot;Asian Idol&quot; held in Indonesia, representing &quot;Philippine Idol&quot;.

<doc id="1025228" wikidata="Q876726" url="?curid=1025228" title="Cam Clarke">
<text>Cam Clarke is an American voice actor, known for his work in animation, video games and commercials. Among his notable roles are Leonardo and Rocksteady in the 1987 &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; animated series, Shotaro Kaneda in the 1989 original Streamline Pictures English dub of &quot;Akira&quot;, and Liquid Snake in the &quot;Metal Gear&quot; series. He often serves as a voice double for Matthew Broderick and served as Broderick&#x27;s singing voice of Simba in &quot;The Lion King II: Simba&#x27;s Pride&quot;.

==Career==
Clarke began his acting career in &quot;The Hollywood Palace&quot; as &quot;The King Family Show&quot;. He continued to perform with his family on various television specials until the 1980s when he got his first voice acting roles in &quot;Snorks&quot; and &quot;Robotech&quot;. He was taught by Michael Bell.

To date, Clarke has voiced over four hundred titles. From 1987 until 1996, Cam Clarke would most notably portray Leonardo, the leader of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles as well as Rocksteady, one of the show&#x27;s antagonists. Clarke would reprise the role of Leonardo in non-musical spoken portions of the first show of the &quot;&quot; concerts designed around the Ninja Turtle characters held at Radio City Music Hall, though the later VHS tape released of the event leaves him uncredited.

==Personal life==
Clarke is the nephew to guitarist Alvino Rey and pianist Buddy Cole, cousin to actress Tina Cole, actor and &quot;TMNT&quot; co-star Pat Fraley, and writer Chris Conkling, half brother to musicians Ric and Lex de Azevedo, and uncle to voice actress Emilie Brown and actress Rachel Coleman.

Clarke is gay, and his experiences inspired his album &quot;Inside Out&quot;, which changed pronouns in lyrics of classic songs and his one-man autobiographical play &quot;Stop Me If I Told You This&quot;.

Clarke is a survivor of HIV, having lived with it for decades.

<text>Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc., formerly known as The Stanley Works, is a &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 American manufacturer of industrial tools and household hardware, and a provider of security products. Headquartered in the Greater Hartford city of New Britain, Connecticut, Stanley Black &amp; Decker is the result of the merger of The Stanley Works and Black &amp; Decker on March 12, 2010.

== History ==
The Stanley Works came to existence as a direct result of the 1920 merger of Stanley&#x27;s Bolt Manufactory, founded by Frederick Trent Stanley in 1843, and the Stanley Rule and Level Company, founded by Frederick&#x27;s cousin, Henry Stanley, in 1857. DeWalt was acquired in 1960, and sold to Black &amp; Decker.
In March 12, 2010 Black &amp; Decker merged with Stanley Works to become Stanley Black &amp; Decker. It’s a wholly owned subsidiary of that company.

During World War II, Stanley Works received the Army-Navy &quot;E&quot; Award for excellence in war production.

In May 2002, the company considered moving its corporate headquarters to Bermuda, but public and governmental outcry forced management to reconsider the move. By August 2002, the company had decided to maintain its incorporation in the United States.

John F. Lundgren was elected as chairman and chief executive officer in 2004, replacing John Trani, a former protégé of Jack Welch at General Electric.

The Hardware &amp; Home Improvement Group, including the Kwikset, Weiser, Baldwin, National Hardware, Stanley, FANAL, Pfister and EZSET brands, was acquired by Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc. on December 17, 2012.

In July 2016, CEO John F. Lundgren stepped down, with President and COO James M. Loree taking over as CEO.

In July 2022, CEO James M. Loree stepped down, with President and CFO Donald Allan, Jr taking over as CEO.

<text>Skegness Grammar School (sometimes SGS) is a coeducational grammar school and sixth form with academy status, located in Skegness, Lincolnshire, England.

Selection to the school is by the eleven-plus examination by entry test or personal interview. The school roll consists of 472 pupils including 106 pupils in the sixth form.

Skegness Grammar School was founded over 500 years ago by a Lord High Chancellor of England. It was the first British secondary school to be awarded Grant Maintained status by the government in 1988. The school has been classed as a High Performing Specialist School.

==History==
===Magdalen School===
In 1483 William Waynflete, also called William of Wainfleet, later the Bishop of Winchester, Provost of Eton College and Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain founded Magdalen College School in his home town of Wainfleet to act as a satellite feeder school for Magdalen College at Oxford University that he had also founded.

In 1933 Magdalen College School closed and was incorporated into its newer and larger buildings at Skegness where it became Skegness Grammar School. The school opened on Wednesday 20 September 1933, and cost £30,000 for 200 places. The headteacher was Kenneth George Spendlove.

===School houses===
The school is organised into four houses all named after historically prominent people or famous Lincolnshire men:

Lumley - after Aldred Lumley, 10th Earl of Scarbrough a major local landowner who was responsible for developing Skegness as a major Victorian holiday resort.

Magdalen - after the Magdalen College School in Wainfleet founded by William of Waynflete, one-time Bishop of Winchester and founder of the college by the same name at Oxford University.

Newton - after Lincolnshire&#x27;s most famous son Sir Isaac Newton, FRS (4 January 164331 March 1727) who was an English physicist, mathematician, astronomer, natural philosopher, alchemist and theologian.

Tennyson - after locally born Alfred Lord Tennyson (6 August 1809 – 6 October 1892) who was Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom and one of the most popular classical English poets of all time.

===Competitions===
The school competed against a team from Boston High School on Wednesday 14 September 1983 on &quot;Top of the Form&quot; on Radio 4. The team was Belinda Raisen aged 17, Mark Finney aged 15, Paula Baumber, Neil Ingham aged 12. The team lost 65-58. Paula gained Geography and Biology A-level in 1987.

===Grant maintained===
The Education Reform Act of 1988 introduced the concept of Grant-maintained schools which shifted the school funding away from the local education authority to direct grant support by central government. Skegness Grammar was the first school in the UK to both apply for and be awarded grant maintained status.

The grant maintained system was dis-established by the new Labour government in 1998 and schools were offered the choice of returning to local education authority funding or opting for foundation status.

===Academy===
The school converted to academy status on 1 September 2012, and is now sponsored by the David Ross Education Trust.

==Notable alumni==

* Noël Greig, playwright and gay rights campaigner.
* Tom Jarvis, Commonwealth Games table tennis player

<doc id="1025235" wikidata="Q17008021" url="?curid=1025235" title="NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund">
<text>The NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc. (NAACP LDF, the Legal Defense Fund, or LDF) is an American civil rights organization and law firm based in New York City.

LDF is wholly independent and separate from the NAACP. Although LDF can trace its origins to the legal department of the NAACP created by Charles Hamilton Houston in the 1930s, Thurgood Marshall founded LDF as a separate legal entity in 1940, which became totally independent from the NAACP in 1957.

Janai Nelson serves as the eighth President and Director-Counsel, since March 2022. Previous Director-Counsels include Sherrilyn Ifill (2012–2022), John Payton (2008–2012), Ted Shaw (2004–2008), Elaine Jones (1993–2004), Julius Levonne Chambers (1984–1993), Jack Greenberg (1961–1984), and founder Thurgood Marshall (1940–1961).

==Overview==
While primarily focused on the civil rights of African Americans in the U.S., LDF states it has &quot;been instrumental in the formation of similar organizations that have replicated its organizational model in order to promote equality for Asian-Americans, Latinos, and women in the United States.&quot; LDF has also been involved in &quot;the campaign for human rights throughout the world, including in South Africa, Canada, Brazil, and elsewhere.&quot;

LDF&#x27;s national office is in Manhattan, with regional offices in Washington, D.C. LDF has nearly two dozen staff lawyers and hundreds of cooperating attorneys across the nation.

===Areas of activity===
* Litigation
* Advocacy
* Educational outreach
* Policy research and monitoring legislation
* Coalition-building
* Provides scholarships for exceptional African-American students.

===Areas of concern===

==Creation and separation from the NAACP==

The board of directors of the NAACP created the Legal Defense Fund in 1940 specifically for tax purposes. In 1957, LDF was completely separated from the NAACP and given its own independent board and staff. Although LDF was originally meant to operate in accordance with NAACP policy, after 1961, serious disputes emerged between the two organizations. These disputes ultimately led the NAACP to create its own internal legal department while LDF continued to operate and score significant legal victories as an independent organization.

At times, this separation has created considerable confusion in the eyes and minds of the public. In the 1980s, the NAACP unsuccessfully sued LDF for trademark infringement. In its ruling rejecting the NAACP&#x27;s lawsuit, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit recognized that the &quot;universal esteem in which the [NAACP] initials are held is due in significant measure to [LDF&#x27;s] distinguished record as a civil rights litigator&quot; and that the NAACP has &quot;benefitted from the added luster given to the NAACP initials by the LDF&#x27;s litigation successes.&quot;

==Well-known cases==
Probably the most famous case in the history of LDF was &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;, the landmark case in 1954 in which the United States Supreme Court explicitly outlawed &quot;de jure&quot; racial segregation of public education facilities. During the civil rights protests of the 1960s, LDF represented &quot;the legal arm of the civil rights movement&quot; and provided counsel for Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., among others.

* 1986: &quot;Dillard v.

Abbott&quot;, The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, sitting en banc, held that Texas&#x27;s 2011 voter photo identification law violated the Voting Rights Act and that there was sufficient evidence to find that the Texas Legislature might have passed the law for the purpose of discriminating against Black and Latino voters. LDF presented oral argument in the Fifth Circuit on behalf of Black students and the Texas League of Young Voters.
* 2017: &quot;Buck v. Davis&quot;, the Supreme Court reversed the death sentence of Mr. Duane Buck because Mr. Buck&#x27;s trial attorney introduced evidence that suggested Mr. Buck was more likely to commit violent acts in the future because he is black. LDF represented and presented oral argument on Mr. Buck&#x27;s behalf in the Supreme Court.
* 2018: &quot;Stout v. Jefferson County Board of Education and Gardendale Board of Education&quot;, The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, blocked the City of Gardendale&#x27;s attempt to secede from the larger Jefferson County school system because Gardendale&#x27;s purpose was to create a mostly white school system separate from the more racially diverse Jefferson County schools.

* 2020: &quot;Thomas v. Andino&quot;, in May 2020, the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina granted a preliminary junction that prohibited South Carolina from enforcing its witness signature requirement for absentee voters in the June 2020 primary elections.

* 2020: &quot;NAACP v. United States Postal Service&quot;, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled that the US Postal Service&#x27;s widespread disruptions in mail delivery violated federal law and risked delaying the delivery of mail-in ballots — thereby causing voter disenfranchisement. On October 10, 2020, the court granted a preliminary injunction motion suspending service changes that had disrupted mail delivery. The court issued a series of additional orders leading up to the November 2020 General Election, which required the US Postal Service to take extraordinary measures to ensure the timely delivery of ballots and to provide daily updates about the delivery status of mail-in ballots. LDF represented the NAACP and individuals in the litigation.
* 2023: &quot;Allen v. Milligan&quot;, on June 8, 2023, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed a preliminary injunction against the State of Alabama&#x27;s 2021 congressional districts and ruled that Alabama&#x27;s map is racially discriminatory in violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. The Supreme Court also upheld the constitutionality of the Voting Rights Act in the redistricting context. LDF represented &quot;Milligan&quot; plaintiffs in the lower courts and presented oral argument on behalf of the &quot;Milligan&quot; appellees in the Supreme Court.
* 2024: &quot;Robinson v. Ardoin&quot;, In June 2022, a federal court preliminary enjoined Louisiana’s congressional map and ordered the state to draw a map with two majority-Black districts. But the Supreme Court of the United States put this order on hold temporarily pending its decision in &quot;Milligan&quot;. After the &quot;Milligan&quot; ruling, the Supreme Court returned the case to the lower courts, which ultimately gave the Louisiana legislature the chance to draw a map with a second majority-Black district. And, in January 2024, the Legislature responded by adopting a new VRA-compliant map. LDF represented the &quot;Robinson&quot; plaintiffs in the Supreme Court and lower courts.
* 2024: &quot;Alexander v. South Carolina State Conference of the NAACP&quot;, on January 6, 2023, a three-judge district court ruled against the State of South Carolina’s 2021 congressional map and concluded that the map is an unconstitutional racial gerrymander and intentionally discriminatory in violation of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. The Supreme Court took the case up on direct appeal and heard oral arguments on October 11, 2023. LDF represented the plaintiffs at trial and presented oral argument on their behalf in the Supreme Court.

<text>Clayton Charles Ruby (6 February 1942 – 2 August 2022) was a Canadian lawyer and activist, specializing in constitutional and criminal law and civil rights.

==Early life and education==
Ruby was born in Toronto, Ontario, to Marie (Bochner) and Toronto property developer and publisher Louis W. Ruby. Ruby received a Bachelor of Arts degree from York University in 1963. He earned a Bachelor of Laws degree from the University of Toronto in 1969, and was called to the bar in 1969.

In 1971, Ruby was the defense counsel for Brian Dodge, one of the prisoners charged with kidnaping for taking six prison guards hostage during the Kingston Penitentiary riot. Ruby told the courtroom in his defense of his client on 17 August 1971: &quot;The motive was different from the ordinary run-of-the-mill event. It was not for profit or for escape, but to try to better the prison system they lived in&quot;. Later in 1971, Ruby was one of the defense counsel at the trial of the &quot;Kingston 13&quot; charged with a torture-murder session during the Kingston Penitentiary riot again defending Dodge. About the secret meetings chaired by Justice William Henderson that ended the trial with plea bargains for the accused, Ruby told the media: &quot;I&#x27;m rather amazed that anyone should find what occurred at the Kingston trial to be in any way improper or unusual&quot;. In 1973, he earned a Master of Laws from the University of California, Berkeley.

==Career==
From 1976 to 2008 Ruby was a partner with the law firm of Ruby &amp; Edwardh with Marlys Edwardh. After 2007, he was a partner with the law firm of Ruby Shiller Chan Hasan in Toronto, Ontario.

In 1991, Ruby was part of the legal team used by the Church of Scientology to defend itself and nine of its members who were on trial for stealing documents concerning Scientology from the Ontario Ministry of the Attorney General, the Canadian Mental Health Association, two police forces and other institutions. The case stemmed from a surprise raid of the Church of Scientology&#x27;s Toronto headquarters in 1983 by more than a hundred policemen who seized an estimated 250,000 documents over the course of two days. Legal maneuvers used by Ruby delayed the case for many years and he later unsuccessfully attempted to get the case dismissed because of &quot;unreasonable delay.&quot; On 25 June 1992, seven church members were convicted for operations against the Ontario Provincial Police, the Ontario Ministry of the Attorney General and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). The Church of Scientology itself was convicted on two counts of breach of the public trust (infiltration of the offices of the Ontario Provincial Police and the Ontario Ministry of the Attorney General) and was ordered to pay a $250,000 fine.

In 2006, Ruby was made a Member of the Order of Canada.

In late 2005, Ruby became the acting Treasurer, or elected head, of the Law Society of Upper Canada, the body responsible for regulating Ontario&#x27;s legal profession. On 23 February 2006, however, Ruby was defeated in a special election and ceased to be Treasurer.

In 2012, Ruby represented a plaintiff who attempted to oust Mayor Rob Ford of Toronto in a high-profile conflict of interest case, which the plaintiff and Ruby won. The mayor subsequently launched an appeal. On 25 January 2012, Ford won the appeal and remained in office.

In 2013, Ruby successfully argued for the former Ontario Deputy Minister of Education Ben Levin&#x27;s release on $100,000 bail. Ruby told reporters &quot;(Ben Levin) is a man who has made enormous contributions to the educational system in this province, and indeed with changes that have been copied around the world, And I intend to work very hard to see that he shall be innocent.&quot; Ben Levin was charged with one count of making child pornography, one count of counselling to commit an indictable offence, 2 counts of distributing child pornography and agreeing to, or arranging, a sexual offence against a child under 16. Levin was eventually sentenced to three years in prison on the aforementioned charges.

==Personal life==
Clayton Ruby&#x27;s father, Louis Ruby, was publisher of &quot;Flash Weekly&quot;, a crusading Toronto tabloid and scandal sheet that ran from the late 1930s until the 1970s.
Ruby was married to Madam Justice Harriet Sachs of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. They have two daughters, Emma Ruby-Sachs and Kate J. Best (née Ruby-Sachs). Ruby died August 2, 2022, at the age of 80 from complications from heart surgery.

<text>The Government Open Systems Interconnection Profile (GOSIP) was a specification that profiled open networking products for procurement by governments in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

==Timeline==
* 1988 - GOSIP: Government Open Systems Interconnection Profile published by CCTA, an agency of UK government
* 1988 - UK&#x27;s CCTA commences work with France and West Germany on European Procurement Handbook (EPHOS)
* 1990 - The US specification requiring Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) protocols was first published as Federal Information Processing Standards document FIPS 146-1. The requirement for US Government vendors to demonstrate their support for this profile led them to join the formal interoperability and conformance testing for networking products, which had been done by industry professionals at the annual InterOp show since 1980.
* 1990 - Publication of European Procurement Handbook (EPHOS), intended to be a European GOSIP
* 1991 - 4th and final version of UK GOSIP released
* 1993 - Australia and New Zealand GOSIP Version 3 - 1993 Government Open Systems Interconnection Profile
* 1995 - FIPS 146-2 allowed &quot;...other specifications based on open, voluntary standards such as those cited in paragraph 3 (&quot;...such as those developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)... and the International Telecommunications Union, Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU–T))&quot;

In practice, from 1995 interest in OSI implementations declined, and worldwide the deployment of standards-based networking services since have been predominantly based on the Internet protocol suite. However, the Defense Messaging System continued to be based on the OSI protocols X.400 and X.500, due to their integrated security capabilities.

<text>Robert d&#x27;Aguiló (c. 1100 – c. 1159), also known as Robert Bordet, was a Norman knight who moved from Normandy to Catalonia in the early 12th century. He was a native of Cullei (modern Rabodanges in Orne, France), as reported by Orderic Vitalis, and his name d&#x27;Aguiló is a catalanized form of &quot;d&#x27;Aculley&quot; or &quot;de Culley&quot; that he adopted after marrying the daughter of a Catalan noble.

In 1124 Robert became governor of the newly conquered territory of Tudela and held that post for the next two years. Three years after his term office, on 14 March 1129, he was ceded secular authority in the district of Tarragona by Olegarius, Bishop of Barcelona, with the title of &quot;Prince of Tarragona&quot; (&quot;princeps Tarraconensis&quot;), effectively the archiepiscopate&#x27;s vidame or &quot;defensor&quot; (defender, advocate). His position in Tarragona he maintained until 1153.

On 24 January 1150 Robert granted the lordship of Riudoms to Arnau de Palomar. In 1149 Robert granted a charter to the city of Tarragona, and appointed one Guillem (William) as lord of the city, but Guillem was forced to resign in 1157. This occurred after he attempted to transfer his rights in the city to the Count of Barcelona but Robert rejected the agreement. On 29 April 1157 the lordship of Reus was granted by Robert to the Church of Tarragona but it was transferred to Bertran de Castellet less than two months later on 3 June. Two years later (1159) an ephemeral agreement between the count, the bishop, and Robert was reached.

Robert was married to Agnes Sibylla (died 1170), and had four sons by her: Guillem (William, died 1168), Robert, Ricard (Richard), and Berenguer (Berengar, who in conjunction with Robert, assassinated Bishop Hug de Cervelló in 1171).

<doc id="1025259" wikidata="Q1474375" url="?curid=1025259" title="Spark chamber">
<text>A spark chamber is a particle detector: a device used in particle physics for detecting electrically charged particles. They were most widely used as research tools from the 1930s to the 1960s and have since been superseded by other technologies such as drift chambers and silicon detectors. Today, working spark chambers are mostly found in science museums and educational organisations, where they are used to demonstrate aspects of particle physics and astrophysics.

Spark chambers consist of a stack of metal plates placed in a sealed box filled with a gas such as helium, neon or a mixture of the two. When a charged particle from a cosmic ray travels through the box, it ionises the gas between the plates. Ordinarily this ionisation would remain invisible. However, if a high enough voltage can be applied between each adjacent pair of plates before that ionisation disappears, then sparks can be made to form along the trajectory taken by the ray, and the cosmic ray in effect becomes visible as a line of sparks. In order to control when this voltage is applied, a separate detector (often containing a pair of scintillators placed above and below the box) is needed. When this trigger senses that a cosmic ray has just passed, it fires a fast switch to connect the high voltage to the plates. The high voltage cannot be connected to the plates permanently, as this would lead to arc formation and continuous discharging.

As research devices, spark chamber detectors have lower resolution than bubble chamber detectors. However they can be made highly selective with the help of auxiliary detectors, making them useful in searching for very rare events.

==Related devices==
A streamer chamber is a type of detector closely related to the spark chamber. In a spark chamber one looks at a stack of parallel plates edge-on. For this reason, best viewing is afforded when the particle comes in perpendicularly to the plates. A streamer chamber, in contrast, typically has only two plates, at least one of which is transparent (e.g. wire mesh or a conductive glass). Particles come in roughly parallel to the plane of these plates. A much shorter high-voltage pulse is used than with a spark chamber, so there is insufficient time for sparks to form. Instead very dim streamers of ionised gas are formed. These can be seen when image enhancement is applied.

<text>Sir Samuel Henry Strong (August 13, 1825 – August 31, 1909) was a lawyer and the third Chief Justice of Canada.

==Life==
Strong was born in Poole, England, to Samuel Spratt Strong and Jane Elizabeth Gosse. He emigrated to Upper Canada with his family in 1836, settling in Bytown (later known as Ottawa). He studied law in the office of local Ottawa lawyer Augustus Keefer. He was called to the bar in 1849 and established his practice in Toronto. He was elected a bencher of the Law Society of Upper Canada in 1860 and was made a QC in 1863. In 1869, Strong was appointed vice-chancellor of the Court of Chancery of Ontario. In 1874 he was appointed to the Ontario Court of Error and Appeal. 

Following Confederation he advised Prime Minister Sir John A. Macdonald on the establishment of the Supreme Court of Canada. He was named to the new court when it was created in 1875. He became Chief Justice in 1892 serving until his retirement in 1902, by which time he was the last of the original justices remaining. He died in 1909 at the age of 84 and was buried in Ottawa&#x27;s Beechwood Cemetery.

<text>The matter of German troop transfer through Finland and Sweden during World War II was one of the more controversial aspects of modern Nordic history beside Finland&#x27;s co-belligerence with Nazi Germany in the Continuation War, and the export of Swedish iron ore during World War II.

The Swedish concession to German demands during and after the German invasion of Norway in April–June 1940 is often viewed as a significant breach with prior neutrality policies that were held in high regard in many smaller European nations. After they were publicly acknowledged, the Soviet Union immediately requested a similar but more far-reaching concession from Finland, which invited the Third Reich to trade similar transit rights through Finland in return for weaponry lacked by the Finns. This was the first significant proof of a changed, more favorable, German policy vis-à-vis Finland, that ultimately would put Finland in a position of co-belligerence with Nazi Germany in the Continuation War against the Soviet Union (25 June 1941 – 4 September 1944).

== German troops through Sweden ==

After Denmark and Norway were invaded on 9 April 1940, Sweden and the other remaining Baltic Sea countries became enclosed by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, then on friendly terms with each other as formalized in the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. The lengthy fighting in Norway resulted in increased German requests for indirect assistance from Sweden, demands that Swedish diplomats were able to fend off by reminding the Germans of the Swedes&#x27; feeling of closeness to their Norwegian brethren. With the conclusion of hostilities in Norway this argument became untenable, forcing the Cabinet to give in to German pressure and allow continuous (unarmed) troop transports, via Swedish railroads, between Germany and Norway.

The extent of these transports was kept secret, although spreading rumors soon forced prime minister Per Albin Hansson to admit their existence. Officially the trains transported wounded soldiers and soldiers on leave &quot;(permittent-tåg)&quot;, which would still have been in violation of Sweden&#x27;s proclaimed neutrality.

In all, close to 100,000 railroad cars had transported 1,004,158 military personnel on leave to Germany and 1,037,158 to Norway through Sweden by the time the transit agreement was disbanded on 15 August 1943.

After the German invasion of the Soviet Union in early summer of 1941, Operation Barbarossa, the Germans on 22 June 1941 asked Sweden for some military concessions. The Swedish government granted these requests for logistical support. The most controversial concession was the decision to allow the railway-transfer of the fully armed and combat-ready 163rd Infantry Division from Norway to Finland.

In Sweden the political deliberations surrounding this decision have been called the &quot;midsummer crisis&quot;. Research by Carl-Gustaf Scott argues however that there never was a &quot;crisis&quot;, and that &quot;the crisis was created in historical hindsight in order to protect the political legacy of the Social Democratic Party and its leader Per Albin Hansson.&quot;

== Soviet troop transfers through Finland ==
The Moscow Peace Treaty that ended the Winter War in March 1940 required Finland to allow the Soviet Navy to establish a naval base on the Hanko Peninsula, at the entrance to the Gulf of Finland. The treaty didn&#x27;t contain any provisions for troop and material transfer rights, and Finland&#x27;s leadership was left with the impression that the Soviet Union would supply the base by sea.

On 9 July, two days after Sweden had officially admitted to having granted transfer rights to Germany, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov demanded free transfer rights through Finland, using Finnish Railways. In the ensuing negotiations the Finns were able to limit the number of Soviet trains simultaneously in Finland to three. An agreement was signed on 6 September.

== German troop transfers through Finland ==
In the summer of 1940, Nazi Germany&#x27;s occupation of Norway brought to the fore the need to transfer troops and munitions not only by sea, but also through the neutral countries of Sweden and Finland. The most convenient route to northernmost Norway was a rough truck road that passed through Finland. Diplomatic relations between Finland and the Third Reich improved after the Winter War, when Germany had sided with the Soviet Union, and on 18 August an agreement was reached that allowed Germany to set up supporting bases along the long Arctic truck road. The negotiations were carried out between the Finnish military leadership and Hermann Göring&#x27;s personal emissary Josef Veltjens. The agreement was kept secret until the first German troops arrived in the port of Vaasa on 21 September.

The German transfer rights were in breach of the spirit, if not the letter, of the Russo-Finnish Moscow Peace Treaty, as well as the Russo-German Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, but the Finns greeted the agreement as a balance against the increasing pressure from the Soviet Union. The transit road through northern Finland had a significant symbolic value, but in transit volume it was of lesser significance until the run up to Operation Barbarossa, when the route was used to deploy five Wehrmacht divisions in northern Finland.

== Timeline ==
* 9 April 1940 
** Germany invades Denmark and Norway
** Sweden accepts German demands for import and export of products to/from Norway as before—i.e., no war material.
* 16 April 1940
** Food and oil supplies permitted transport to northern Norway to &quot;save the population from starvation&quot; after the war had emptied the reserves.
** Troops, including 40 &quot;red-cross soldiers&quot; were denied transit.
* 18 April 1940
** The 40 &quot;red-cross soldiers&quot; were accepted for transit together with a train loaded with sanitary material. However, when this turned out to contain 90% food, according to the Swedish customs, further requests for transit of &quot;sanitary material&quot; were rejected.
* April to June 1940
** Norway protests that Sweden is taking the neutrality too seriously, expecting more support for Norway.
** German civil sailors were given individual transit visas.
** Wounded soldiers were transported through Sweden, and 20 further &quot;red-cross soldiers&quot; and a physician were allowed to pass together with five wagons with food.
* 18 June 1940
** As the war in Norway concluded, German demands for transit were repeated with greater emphasis. The Swedish parliament did formally modify the neutrality policy according to the German demands. (The United Kingdom and France were informed before the parliament debate.)
* 7 July 1940
** Sweden&#x27;s Prime Minister admits the transit in a public speech in Ludvika.
* 8 July 1940
** Swedish agreement with Nazi Germany formalized:
*** 1 daily train (500 man) back and forth Trelleborg–Kornsjø.
*** 1 weekly train (500 man) back and forth Trelleborg–Narvik.
*: The agreement with Germany was later expanded.
* 9 July 1940
** The Soviet Union demands troop transfer rights through Finland.
* 15 July 1940
** Protests from Norway&#x27;s exile Cabinet, and from the United Kingdom&#x27;s government, against Swedish concessions for German demands.
* August 1940
** After the Soviet occupation of the Baltic Republics, they are annexed to the Soviet Union, making the Soviet Union a dominant power at the Baltic Sea beside the Third Reich.
* 18 August 1940
** A German envoy agree on troop transfer rights with Finland&#x27;s leadership:
*** The Wehrmacht is granted rights to use
**** the ports of Vaasa, Oulu, Kemi, and Tornio.
*** rail lines from the ports to Ylitornio and Rovaniemi.
*** roads from Ylitornio and Rovaniemi to northern Norway, and to establish depots along the roads.
** The agreement was later expanded to include the port of Turku.
* 6 September 1940
** The troop transfer treaty between Finland and the Soviet Union is signed:
*** The Soviet Union can use rail lines from the Soviet border to Hanko.
*** Only three trains are allowed to be simultaneously in Finland.
* April 1941
** As the German plans for an attack on Russia were taken seriously by the Swedish government, it was discussed between the Cabinet and the Commander-in-chief how Sweden could react in case of a war between Germany, Finland and Russia.
*** The Commander-in-chief warned of the danger of a continued policy of neutrality, which could provoke German anger and occupation. Plans for cooperation with Germany and Finland were made.
*** Individual Cabinet members considered cooperation with the Soviet Union, however this was fiercely rejected by a large cabinet majority.
* Midsummer 1941
** In connection with Germany&#x27;s attack on Russia on Midsummer&#x27;s Day 1941, Sweden had its most serious cabinet crisis:
*** 22 June 1941, with Operation Barbarossa the German invasion of the Soviet Union starts.
**** Germany demanded to transit the fully armed Division Engelbrecht (163. Inf. Div) from Norway to Finland.
*** 23 June 1941
**** The Cabinet discuss the requested transit of one armed division (Division Engelbrecht) from northern Norway to northern Finland. Agrarians, Liberals and the Right supported acceding to the combined Finnish-German request. Some Social Democrats opposed it.
**** The king declared &quot;he would not be a party of giving a negative answer to Finland&#x27;s and Germany&#x27;s request&quot;, which was tactically cited by the prime minister in terms of a threat of abdication. It has not been decisively shown whether the prime minister&#x27;s interpretation was purely tactical, or if he in fact had perceived an honest intention to consider abdication on the part of the king, but the prime minister&#x27;s record and personality speak for the tactical-theory.
*** 24 June 1941
**** The Social Democratic parliament group decides, with the votes 72-59, to try to convince the other parties for a rejection, but to agree in case they insisted.
**** The other parties seemed prepared to split the Cabinet.
*** 25 June 1941
**** The Swedish government accepts the transit of Division Engelbrecht.
* 25 June 1941
** Soviet Union stages a major air assault with 460 planes against Finnish targets.

* 11 July 1941
** Finland&#x27;s official ambitions for a Greater Finland become known abroad with the publication of Mannerheim&#x27;s Order of the Day of 10 July, the so-called Sword Scabbard Declaration.
** New demands on transit of an armed division from Trelleborg to Tornio.
* following weeks of July 1941
** Public attitudes in Sweden to Finland&#x27;s and Germany&#x27;s demands grew less and less favorable.
** Troop transit is proposed in Swedish waters along the Swedish coast with Swedish escort.
* autumn of 1941
** Several requests for neutrality-violating exports and transits are rejected during the following autumn.

In 1943, as Germany&#x27;s prospects began to wane, Swedish public opinion turned against the agreement, and pressure from Britain and the USA mounted, the Swedish Cabinet declared on 29 June 1943 that the transits had to stop before October 1943. On 5 August it was officially announced that the transits were to cease.

== In popular culture ==
&quot;Attentatet i Pålsjö skog&quot; is a 1996 alternate history novel by Hans Alfredson. In the book a group of Swedish communists blow up a German train passing through Sweden, killing Eva Braun who is on board. Hitler is infuriated and invades Sweden, which surrenders on 12 May 1941.

&quot;Konjak &amp; nazister&quot; (&quot;Cognac and Nazis&quot;), a song by Euskefeurat, tells the story of a sabotage on a German train in Abisko where they drill a hole in the bottom of a freight car to get to the large barrel of cognac there.

Karl Gerhard performed the revue song &quot;Den ökända hästen från Troja&quot; (The Infamous Trojan Horse) in 1940 and it was later banned. The song used the tune by Isaak Dunajevskij with new words in Swedish by Lille Bror Söderlundh. When the song was performed, a large Dalecarlian horse was brought onto the stage, but instead of legs it had columns. It also had a fifth column that opened and Karl Gerhard stepped out.

<doc id="1025265" wikidata="Q5531000" url="?curid=1025265" title="Gender of connectors and fasteners">
<text>In electrical and mechanical trades and manufacturing, each half of a pair of mating connectors or fasteners is conventionally designated as male or female, a distinction referred to as its gender. The female connector is generally a receptacle that receives and holds the male connector. Alternative terms such as &quot;plug&quot; and &quot;socket&quot; or &quot;jack&quot; are sometimes used, particularly for electrical connectors.

The assignment is a direct analogy with male and female genitalia. The part bearing one or more protrusions, or which fits inside the other, is designated &quot;male&quot;, while the one with the corresponding indentations, or fitting outside the other, is designated &quot;female&quot;. Extension of the analogy results in the verb &quot;to mate&quot; being used to describe the process of connecting two corresponding parts together.

In some cases (notably electrical power connectors), the gender of connectors is selected according to rigid rules which enforce a sense of one-way directionality (e.g. a flow of power &quot;from&quot; one device &quot;to&quot; another). This is done to enhance safety, or ensure proper functionality, by preventing unsafe or non-functional configurations from being set up.

In terms of mathematical graph theory, an electrical power distribution network made up of plugs and sockets is a directed tree, with the directionality arrows corresponding to the female-to-male transfer of electrical power through each mated connection. This is an example where male and female connectors have been deliberately designed and assigned to physically enforce a safe network topology.

In other contexts, such as plumbing, one-way flow is &quot;not&quot; enforced through connector gender assignment. Flows through piping networks can be bidirectional, as in underground water distribution networks which have designed-in redundancy. In plumbing situations where one-way flow &quot;is&quot; desired, it is implemented through other means (e.g. air gaps or one-way check valves), and not through male-female gender schemes.

== Early mentions of the metaphor ==

The Talmud describes arrow heads and mating shafts as potentially being either male or female, depending on their construction, i.e. a prong on a male arrow head fits into a hollowed out shaft and vice versa. This is owing to a prohibition on a female shaft, from its susceptibility as a receptacle for impurity, for use as s&#x27;chach

18th-century dictionaries and encyclopedias mention male and female screws or cochleae. A 1736 builder&#x27;s manual mentions screw genders as metaphors for convex and concave shapes:

==Mechanical fasteners==

In mechanical design, the prototypical &quot;male&quot; component is a threaded bolt, but an alignment post, a mounting boss, or a sheet metal tab connector can also be considered as male. Correspondingly, a threaded nut, an alignment hole, a mounting recess, or sheet metal slot connector is considered to be female.

While some mechanical designs are &quot;one-off&quot; custom setups not intended to be repeated, there is an entire fastener industry devoted to manufacturing mass-produced or semi-custom components. To avoid unnecessary confusion, conventional definitions of fastener gender have been defined and agreed upon.

==Modular construction toys==

Several common construction toys embody gendered (and in some cases, genderless) mechanical interconnections. For example, the canonical Lego plastic blocks have &quot;female&quot; indentations on the lower surface, and &quot;male&quot; bosses or protrusions on the upper surfaces. Meccano and Erector have many gendered connections, starting with the nut-and-bolt fasteners they use frequently.

Stickle bricks, using interlocking plastic protrusions, are effectively genderless (while nonetheless maintaining an asymmetry). Lincoln logs use a very simple form of genderless connections. Kapla or KEVA planks are extremely simple genderless systems interconnected only by gravity.

Mathematicians have begun to classify well-known construction sets using group theory to study the combinatoric possibilities of structures that can be built.

==Plumbing==

In plumbing fittings, the &quot;M&quot; or &quot;F&quot; usually comes at the beginning rather than the end of the abbreviated designation. For example:
* MIPT denotes &quot;male iron pipe thread&quot;;
* FIPT denotes &quot;female iron pipe thread&quot;.

A short length of pipe having an MIP thread at both ends is sometimes called a nipple. A short pipe fitting having an FIP thread at both ends is sometimes called a coupling.

Hermaphroditic connections, which may include both male and female elements in a single unit, are used for some specialized tubing fittings, such as Storz fire hose connectors. A picture of such fittings appears in , below. Interchangeable garden hose fittings made by GEKA are also hermaphroditic, relying on a rubber gasket to make the final connection.

==Downspout==
Downspouts (also called downpipes, rain conductors, or leaders) are used to convey rainwater from roof gutters to the ground through hollow pipes or tubes. These tubes usually come in sections, joined by inserting the male end (often crimped with a special tool to slightly reduce its size) into the female end of the next section. These connections are usually not sealed or caulked, instead relying on gravity to move the rainwater from the male end and into the receiving female connection located directly below.

==Ductwork==
Sheet metal ductwork for conveying air in HVAC systems typically uses gendered connections. Typically, the airflow through a ductwork connection is from male to female. However, since one-way flow is implemented by forced-air fans or blowers, &quot;backwards&quot; gendered connections can be seen frequently in some systems, since all connections are typically sealed with duct sealing mastic or tape to prevent leakage anyway. The flow convention is usually loosely adhered to for simplicity of design, and to reduce the number of gender changer fittings required, but exceptions are made whenever expedient.

==Electrical and electronic==
Although the gender of tubing and plumbing fittings is usually obvious, this may not be true of electrical connectors because of their more complex and varying constructions. Instead, connector gender is conventionalized and thus can be somewhat obscure to the uninitiated. For example, the female D-subminiature connector body projects outward from the mounting plane of the chassis, and this protrusion could be erroneously construed as male. Instead, the &quot;maleness&quot; of the D-subminiature connectors is defined by specific presence of &quot;male pins&quot;, rather than by the protrusion of the connector (this is also true for many other pin-based connectors like XLR). The male/female distinction is more obvious with ring crimp lug connectors which are placed around a screw post, but again with spade or split ring crimp lug connectors the end alone is not obviously female.

Further confusion can be caused by the term &quot;jack&quot;, which is used for both female and male connectors and typically refers to the fixed (panel) side of a connector pair. IEEE STD 100, IEEE-315-1975 and IEEE 200-1975 (replaced by ASME Y14.44-2008) define &quot;plug&quot; and &quot;jack&quot; by location or mobility, rather than gender.

A connector in a fixed location is a &quot;jack&quot;, and a moveable connector is a &quot;plug&quot;. The distinction is relative, so a portable radio is considered stationary compared to the cable from the headphones; the radio has a jack, and the headphone cable has a plug. Where the relationship is equal, such as when two flexible cables are connected (an &quot;inline&quot; connection), each is considered a plug. Jacks use the reference designator prefix of J and plugs use the reference designator prefix of P. 

It is common practice to use female connectors for jacks, so the informal gender-based usage often happens to agree with the functional description of the technical standards. However, this is &quot;not&quot; always the case; often-seen exceptions include a computer&#x27;s AC Power Inlet and EIA232 DE9 Serial Port, or the male coaxial power jacks for connecting external power adapters to portable equipment.

To summarize, it is considered best practice to use &quot;male&quot; and &quot;female&quot; for connector &quot;gender&quot;, and &quot;plug&quot; and &quot;jack&quot; for connector &quot;function&quot; or &quot;mobility&quot;. 

===Variant usages===

In the United Kingdom, many Commonwealth countries, and some non-English-speaking countries such as France, the word &quot;jack&quot; may refer to the &quot;plug&quot; on the end of a removable cable. These connectors were originally referred to as &quot;jack plugs&quot;, or plugs intended to be mated with fixed receptacles, or &quot;sockets&quot; (which North Americans would call &quot;jacks&quot;), but the second word was dropped. This variant usage is in direct contradiction to common usage and official standards in North America.

For example, in the UK, the connector on the end of a headphone lead is known as a &quot;jack&quot;, that plugs into a &quot;socket&quot; on the main unit. The same usage also generally occurs in Italy, where the English word &quot;jack&quot; is commonly used to indicate the connector on the end of a headphone lead.

In Romania, female connectors are known as &quot;mamă&quot; (&quot;mother&quot;) and male connectors are &quot;tată&quot; (&quot;father&quot;).

===Abbreviations and alternate terminology===
The standard letters &quot;M&quot; and &quot;F&quot; are commonly used in part numbers to designate connector gender. For example, in Switchcraft XLR microphone or hydrophone connectors, the part numbers are denoted as follows:
* A3F = Audio 3-pin female connector;
* A3M = Audio 3-pin male connector.

The terms &quot;plug&quot;, &quot;pin&quot;, and &quot;prong&quot; are also often used for &quot;male&quot; connectors, and &quot;receptacle&quot;, &quot;socket&quot;, and &quot;slot&quot; are used for &quot;female&quot; connectors. In many cases these terms are more common than &quot;male&quot; and &quot;female&quot;, especially in documentation intended for the non-specialist. These nearly synonymous terms can cause a fair amount of confusion when the designations are shortened in labels.

For example, a female high-density D-subminiature connector with a size 1 shell can be named DE15F or DE15S (see accompanying pictures). Both terms mean the same thing but could be construed to be completely different items. Similarly, a male standard-density D-sub with a size 1 shell can be named DE9M or DE9P; a female standard-density D-sub with a size 2 shell can be named DA15F or DA15S; a male high-density D-sub with a size 3 shell can be named DB44M or DB44P; and so forth.

===Gender selection in electronic design===
Electronic designers often select female jack connectors for fixed mounting on electronic equipment they design. This is usually done because female connectors are more resistant to damage or contamination, by virtue of their concealed or recessed electrical contacts. A damaged motherboard connector can result in the scrapping of an expensive piece of electronic equipment. The risk of damage is reduced by relegating the more exposed male contacts to connecting cables, which can be repaired or replaced at lower cost. 

For example, in an RS-232 serial port, the male connector is more mechanically fragile than the female connector. Cost and reliability considerations probably drove the design decision to use female jack connectors on many computer terminals (and some personal computers) for the serial port, despite being in direct violation of the connector gender convention explicitly specified in the RS-232 standard for &quot;DTE&quot; (data terminal equipment) connections. This confusing reversal of the RS-232 connector gender convention has caused many hours of frustration for ill-informed end users, as they tried to troubleshoot non-functional serial port equipment connections.

===Safety===

In electrical connections where voltage or current is sufficient to cause injury, the part permanently connected to the power &quot;source&quot; is invariably female, with concealed contacts, to prevent inadvertent touching of live conductors by people or animals, or by conductive items that may cause a short circuit. A male plug, with fully exposed protruding contacts, is installed on the cord of (or directly onto) the device &quot;receiving&quot; the power. Devices that need to be robust against mechanical damage may use a special male IEC 60320 C14 connector (see the gallery above), which is recessed below the surface of a mounting panel, providing the desired physical protection while conforming to safety regulations.

In the case of consumer-level AC power, connector gender is used to implicitly enforce safe use of power connectors. Because of this consideration, it is illegal under electrical code to make or use any &quot;gender changers&quot; to connect AC line power to consumer-level equipment.
A double-ended male connector for utility-supplied (&quot;mains&quot;) electrical power is extremely dangerous, and sometimes is called a &quot;suicide cable&quot; or &quot;widowmaker cord&quot;. Some hardware shops explicitly refuse to make or sell them when asked by customers who have mistakenly hung a string of Christmas lights backwards and wish to connect the socket end to a wall socket, or who intend to connect a generator or inverter to their home&#x27;s electrical circuit in the event of a utility power outage. The exposed prongs on the live end of the cable pose serious electrical shock and fire hazards, and when improperly used in a generator setup may cause the equipment to burn out when utility power is restored. It can also backfeed power into the grid, potentially damaging utility equipment or even electrocuting linemen attempting to restore power.

Similarly, an exposed connection on a jumper cable for a 12V automotive battery can be hazardous, because of the potentially high current and energy involved. Accidental shorting of the wire to vehicle ground can cause sparks, rapid heating, or even a battery explosion.

In low-voltage use such as for data communications, electrical shock hazard is not an issue, and male or female connectors are used based on other engineering factors such as convenience of use, cost, or ease of manufacturing. For example, the common &quot;patch cables&quot; used for Ethernet (and the similar cords used for telephones) typically have male modular plugs on both ends, to connect to jacks on equipment or mounted in walls.

An example of a design tradeoff in power connector selection is a coaxial power connector, which is usually set up so that power is fed &quot;from&quot; the female plug &quot;into&quot; the male jack (which is typically a part of the electronic device accepting the power). Although the plug is female, with a partially recessed center contact, it is still possible for casual accidental contact with a metallic object to short-circuit the power source. Depending on the design of the power adapter, it may react to a short circuit by shutting down temporarily, or instead by blowing out an internal safety fuse.

In this example, the marginal reliability of the connector choice was deemed to be acceptable by the equipment designer, since the power adapter supplies low voltage that does not pose an electric shock hazard. The potential fire hazard from accidental short-circuiting is addressed by the internal safety fuse, although this requires that a failed power adapter be completely replaced. In a different design, if the power adapter were intended to supply a voltage sufficient to cause electrical shock, the semi-exposed center contact of the female plug would be considered unacceptably hazardous, requiring a different choice of connector.

===Ambiguous gender===
Some electrical connectors are hermaphroditic because they include both male and female elements in a single unit intended to interconnect freely, without regard for gender. See the discussion of genderless connectors in this article for more detailed information.

As an additional complication, certain electronic connector designs may incorporate combinations of male and female pins in a &quot;single&quot; connector body, for mating with a complementary connector with opposite gender pins in corresponding positions. For example, CEE 7/5 sockets have a male Ground pin. In these unusual cases, gender is often defined by the shape of the connector &quot;body&quot;, rather than the mixed-gender connector &quot;pins&quot; and &quot;sockets&quot;. These types of connectors are not strictly speaking hermaphroditic, since mating connectors are &quot;not&quot; freely interchangeable. An informal term that has been used for these connectors is &quot;bisexual&quot;, in addition to the more official terminology, mixed-gender. Thus, for example, one can have a mixed-gender female plug that connects to a mixed-gender male jack (though a reversed gender assignment of connectors would be a more typical design choice in this example).

Male connector pins are often protected by a shell (also called a shroud, surround, or shield), which may envelop the entire female connector when mated. RF connectors often have multiple layers of interlocking shells to properly connect the shields of coaxial and triaxial cable. In such cases, the gender is assigned based on the &quot;innermost&quot; connecting point. With the exception of reverse polarity BNC or TNC, where the outer shell determines the gender and the innermost connecting points are opposite to a standard connector, for example a female RP-TNC connector has a solid innermost pin.

Another ambiguous situation arises with the connectors used for USB, FireWire (IEEE-1394), HDMI, and Thunderbolt serial data bus connections. Close examination of these connectors reveals that the contact &quot;pins&quot; are not actually pins, but instead are conductive surfaces that slide past each other when they mate. Therefore, the traditional pin and socket nomenclature is not applicable. Instead, most computer hardware people fall back to referring to the wrap-around metal shield on the plug connector &quot;as if&quot; it were a connector &quot;pin&quot;. By this convention, the connectors on serial bus cables are &quot;male plugs&quot;, and the corresponding connectors on equipment are &quot;female jacks&quot;. 
A casual glance at a USB &quot;Type A&quot; plug connector may give the false impression that it is hermaphroditic. However, a physical attempt to mate two USB &quot;Type A&quot; cables with each other reveals the fact that the connectors will not interconnect. Classifying according to mathematical graph theory, USB buses are directed trees, whereas FireWire buses have a true bus network topology. This difference is reflected in the bus connectors used, in that USB cables are asymmetrical (one end Type A, other end Type B) while FireWire cables may have identical connectors at both ends. The more-recent USB-C cables may also have identical connectors on both ends (in which case the logical &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; ends are negotiated between the attached devices rather than being directly indicated by the plugs).

An example of a connector where the contacts themselves are hermaphroditic is the ELCO Varicon, wherein the contacts are bifurcated in recessed cross-shaped wells, and mate with one another axially at a 90 degree rotation. In this example, the plugs have the contacts oriented transversely and the sockets are arranged longitudinally.

==Genderless (hermaphroditic)==
By definition, a hermaphroditic connector includes mating surfaces having simultaneous male and female aspects, involving complementary paired identical parts each containing both protrusions and indentations. These mating surfaces are mounted into identical fittings which can freely mate with any other, without regard for gender (provided that the size and type are already matched). Alternative names include hermaphrodite, androgynous, genderless, sexless, combination (or combo), two-in-one, two-way, and other descriptive terms. Several of these latter alternate names are ambiguous in meaning, and should not be used unless carefully defined in context. True hermaphroditic connectors should not be confused with &quot;mixed gender&quot; connectors, which are described elsewhere in this article.

Another closely related type is the stackable connector for electronics, which typically has male pins on one surface and complementary female sockets on the opposite surface, allowing multiple units to be stacked up like plastic milk crates. Examples of this include stackable banana plugs, and interconnect cables specified for the IEEE-488 instrumentation bus. Stackable mezzanine bus connectors are used on some modular microcomputer accessory boards for systems such as the Arduino add-on daughterboards called &quot;shields&quot;. The older PC/104 embedded PC modules use a similar stackable format for interconnection. Stackable connectors are not classified as hermaphroditic in the strictest sense, but are often described as such in looser usage.

The hermaphroditic design is useful when multiple complex or lengthy components must be arbitrarily connected in various combinations. For example, if hoses have hermaphroditic fittings, they can be connected without having to pull a lengthy hose and reverse it because it has the wrong gender to connect to another hose. Some military fiber optical cables also have hermaphroditic connectors to prevent &quot;wrong gender&quot; connector problems in field deployments. In a similar fashion, railcars are usually equipped with hermaphroditic railway coupling mechanisms that allow either end of the vehicle to be connected to a train without having to turn the railcar around first.
For the same reason, several spacecraft docking mechanisms are designed to be &quot;androgynous&quot;,
including the Androgynous Peripheral Attach System, the NASA Docking System, and Chinese Docking Mechanism.

In the absence of genderless connectors, gender changer fittings might be used to enable certain connections. The designer of a connection system may use one or both schemes to allow arbitrary connectivity, or even combine both schemes into a single system.

When an enforced sense of unidirectionality or &quot;one-way flow&quot; is required for safety or other reasons (for example, AC electrical power connections), a strict assignment of connector genders is implemented to prevent undesired configurations, and gender changers are banned.

Some commonly seen examples of hermaphroditic connectors include the SAE connector for 12 V DC power, jackhammer air hose connectors, and the Anderson Powerpole series of modular high-current power connectors. The now-obsolete IBM Token Ring connector was another widespread example. The General Radio Corporation developed a hermaphroditic coaxial radio frequency connector often called the &quot;GR connector&quot;.

Some audio multicore cables are fitted with hermaphroditic multipin quick-disconnect connectors for ease of use in the field. One style of this audio signal cable is fitted on both ends with connectors that are each populated half with pins and half with sockets. The advantage to the user is that it does not matter which end connects to the stage and which to the audio mixer, facilitating faster set up. Another style of connector uses hybrid male/female pins with a receiving slot fitted in the center of each two-tine pin, and relies on 90-degree rotation of the pin axes to mate. The connector housings themselves are sexed male and female.

==Gender changers==
Devices used for mating two connectors of the same gender have a wide variety of terms, including for example: &quot;gender changer&quot;, &quot;gender mender&quot;, &quot;gender bender&quot;, and &quot;gender blender&quot;. A specific gender changer can be referred to by either the gender of its connectors, or the gender which it is designed to connect to, resulting in a thoroughly ambiguous terminology. Thus a &quot;male gender changer&quot; might have female connectors to mate two male ends, or male connectors to mate two female ends.

Adding to this potential for confusion, some gender changers also combine additional functions such as cross-over pin-outs. Active cables may incorporate embedded systems for communications protocol or logic level changes, which technically makes them &quot;adapters&quot;, but this distinction is sometimes neglected in marketing materials or common usage.

==Examples==
* Coaxial power connector, for low-voltage DC connections
* A power cord on an appliance terminates in a (male) plug; it connects to a (female) socket in a wall or on an extension cord.
* Coaxial cables used for video or other high-frequency signals are normally terminated, at both ends, in a connector comprising an inner pin and an outer fixed or rotating shell; these are conventionally reckoned as male.
* A threaded nut is female and a bolt is male.
* Connectors for air brake hoses on heavy trucks and railroad equipment use genderless &quot;gladhand connectors&quot;. In railroad air brake use, this makes the orientation of rolling stock irrelevant, and is used with the standard North American railroad coupler that connects cars together, also genderless.

<text>The Tour DuPont was a cycling stage race in the United States held annually between 1989 and 1996, initially called the Tour de Trump in the first two years. It was intended to become a North American cycling event similar in format and prestige to the Tour de France. The tour&#x27;s names came from its sponsors, first the businessman (and future U.S. President) Donald Trump and then later DuPont.

The race was held in the mid-Atlantic states, including areas near DuPont&#x27;s Wilmington, Delaware, headquarters. DuPont withdrew their sponsorship of the race after the 1996 edition, and the event has not been run since. During the eight-year history of the race as both the Tour de Trump and the Tour DuPont, it was won twice by Mexican rider Raúl Alcalá and twice by American Lance Armstrong. The race was cited as evidence of Richmond, Virginia&#x27;s ability to host international cycle racing when the city successfully bid for the 2015 UCI Road World Championships.

==Origins as the Tour de Trump==
The race was originally sponsored by Donald Trump and known as the &quot;Tour de Trump&quot; in 1989 and 1990. The idea for the race was conceived by CBS Sports reporter John Tesh, who had covered the 1987 Tour de France and on his return suggested holding a race in the United States to the basketball commentator and entrepreneur Billy Packer. Packer originally planned to call the race the Tour de Jersey. He approached representatives of casinos in Atlantic City for sponsorship, and Trump offered to be the race&#x27;s primary sponsor and Packer&#x27;s business partner in the venture. It was Packer who suggested the Tour de Trump name. Speaking at the time of the start of the first Tour de Trump in May 1989, Trump himself stated that &quot;When [the name] was initially stated, I practically fell out of my seat. I said, &#x27;Are you kidding? I will get killed in the media if I use that name. You absolutely have to be kidding&#x27;&quot;. However, Trump reportedly changed his mind within 20 seconds, and was convinced by the commercial value of the name.

Trump&#x27;s lawyers subsequently sent a &quot;cease and desist&quot; letter to the organizers of a bike race held in Aspen, Colorado called the Tour de Rump. The letter stated: &quot;You are using the name and mark Tour de Rump in connection with an &#x27;inaugural&#x27; cycling event. Your use of that name and mark is likely to cause confusion and constitutes trademark infringement, unfair competition and false designation of origin, all in violation of applicable federal and state laws&quot;. The organizer Ron Krajian&#x27;s lawyer responded by arguing that his race was a local and non-commercial event, and predated the Tour de Trump. No response was received from Trump&#x27;s lawyers, and the Tour de Rump went ahead.

The total prize money on offer for the first event in 1989 was US$250,000, including $50,000 for the winner of the general classification. This, together with the race&#x27;s place in the international calendar between the Giro d&#x27;Italia and the Tour de France, made it attractive to high-profile riders and teams, but the event did not attract large crowds. Interviewed on NBC prior to the start of the 1989 race, Trump stated that &quot;I would like to make this the equivalent of the Tour de France&quot;. The race filled a gap left by the demise of the Coors International Bicycle Classic, which had been North America&#x27;s major stage race but which folded following its 1988 edition. Some European teams reportedly missed the Vuelta a España in order to race the Tour de Trump.

The inaugural Tour de Trump started in Albany, New York, and consisted of 10 stages, totalling , taking in five Eastern states. The route took the race south from Albany to Richmond, Virginia, and then across to Atlantic City, where it finished in front of Trump&#x27;s casino. Some 114 riders from eight professional and 11 amateur teams competed. Riders competing included Greg LeMond, and Andrew Hampsten, and the teams represented included Lotto, Panasonic, PDM, and the Soviet national squad.

The race was met by anti-Trump protests in the first-stage finishing town of New Paltz, New York, where demonstrators held placards reading &quot;Fight Trumpism&quot;, &quot;Die Yuppie $cum&quot;, &quot;The Art of the Deal = The Rich Get Richer&quot; and &quot;Trump = Lord of the Flies&quot;. The 1989 race was won by the Norwegian rider Dag Otto Lauritzen of the American team 7-Eleven, although there was some controversy about the result as Belgian rider Eric Vanderaerden, who had won four stages and was expected to take the lead in the general classification in the final stage time trial in Atlantic City but took a wrong turn following a race motorbike. The Soviet rider Viatcheslav Ekimov, who took part as an amateur, won the first stage of the race (following a prologue time trial). Articles published the following year reported that Ekimov &quot;had had the nerve to win a stage as an amateur ... and some pros reportedly rewarded him by jamming a feed bag into his wheel&quot;, and that he &quot;threatened to win the Tour de Trump last year as an amateur before the pros banded together to eliminate any chance he had of winning&quot;. Nonetheless, the first edition of the race was described as &quot;a smashing success&quot; in &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, which noted: &quot;If you could get past the name, the Tour de Trump, without losing your lunch, and if you could somehow divorce the sporting event from the excess baggage that went with it ... what you had was a pretty nice bicycle race&quot;.

Following the first event, Packer wanted to expand the race to take in more states. The 1990 race started on May 4 in Wilmington in Delaware, a state which Trump considered important for his three casinos in Atlantic City, and also visited Baltimore, after Trump agreed to local racecourse owner Joe De Francis&#x27;s condition that he moor his yacht the &quot;Trump Princess&quot; in Baltimore Harbor during the race. It finished in Boston on May 13. Entrants in 1990 included 1989 winner Dag Otto Lauritzen, Greg LeMond, Steve Bauer, who had finished second in Paris–Roubaix that year, Andrew Hampsten, Davis Phinney, Ekimov, in his first year as a professional, and East German rider Olaf Ludwig. The race was won by Mexican rider Raúl Alcalá of the PDM–Concorde team.

After two editions, Trump withdrew his sponsorship of the race due to his business&#x27;s financial problems. According to Packer, reflecting on the event in 2016, he and Trump &quot;parted as good business friends&quot;, although he also explained that Trump&#x27;s personality and celebrity, as well as the scandals surrounding Trump&#x27;s marriage and business affairs, distracted from the event and annoyed European riders in the race.

==DuPont sponsorship era==
After Trump withdrew from sponsoring the event, DuPont became the primary sponsor. Between 1991 and 1995, national amateur teams took part alongside professional teams. The event attracted well-known competitors, including Lance Armstrong and Greg LeMond, and was attended by high-profile European-based professional cycling teams. In 1996, the Union Cycliste Internationale upgraded it to a 2.1 ranked race, meaning that amateurs could no longer compete. This made the race the highest ranked outside of Europe and the first North American stage race to be ranked 2.1. The 1996 race was the subject of a number of legal issues, including a dispute over rights to its profits between the race owners, Billy Packer and president of the United States Cycling Federation Mike Plant, which resulted in them suing each other. DuPont itself was involved in a dispute about the anti-homosexual employment policies of the local government in Greenville, South Carolina, with the company insisting that the race organizers exclude the city from the route. After 1996, DuPont dropped its sponsorship and the race has not been run since.

During its six years as the Tour DuPont, the race was won by Dutch rider Erik Breukink, Greg LeMond, Raúl Alcalá, Russian Viatcheslav Ekimov, and twice by Lance Armstrong. Over this time, a prologue time trial held in Wilmington, Delaware, became the traditional start to the race. Between 1992 and 1994, the race included a stage from Port Deposit and Hagerstown in Maryland, but in 1995, South Carolina was included on the route for the first time in its place. Every edition of the Tour DuPont visited Richmond, Virginia.

Breukink won in 1991 by overcoming a 50-second deficit going into the final stage, a individual time trial, despite puncturing 15 minutes into the stage, to win by 12 seconds from Norwegian Atle Kvålsvoll. In 1992, American Greg LeMond won the overall classification. It was the last major win of his career, although he competed in the race again in 1994. Alcalá&#x27;s victory in the race in 1993 was his second, having won the Tour de Trump in 1990. In 1993, he beat Lance Armstrong, who had held the leader&#x27;s jersey going into the final stage. Armstrong&#x27;s first participation in the race had been in 1991, when he finished midway down the overall classification. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2008, his performance in the 1991 Tour DuPont &quot;marked the arrival of a promising newcomer to the sport&quot;. In 1994, Alcalá and Armstrong returned to the race as teammates, both riding for Motorola. The race took place over 11 stages, covering . That year, Ekimov won the overall title, with Armstrong finishing second again. Armstrong finally won the overall classification of the Tour DuPont in 1995, when the race was held over , despite losing more than two minutes to Ekimov on the final-stage time trial. The final edition of the race, held in 1996, was also won by Armstrong, who became the first and only rider to win two editions of the event back-to-back. The French rider Pascal Hervé, of the Festina cycling team, was second. The total prize money for the 1996 race was in excess of US$260,000.

In July 1996, DuPont announced that it was ending its sponsorship of the race. According to a brand manager for the company, &quot;Over the past six years, the Tour DuPont has been an excellent vehicle for promoting our products. However, we need to focus more on strategic markets in other parts of the world, where a sustained annual program versus a two-week event can better leverage the DuPont brand equity for profitable growth&quot;. Race organizer Mike Plant explained that &quot;I talked to them a couple of months ago, and they had to make a hard decision. They don&#x27;t have hundreds of millions of dollars to put into worldwide advertising. They put a ton of money into this event and they built up a valuable franchise, but, like Motorola, corporations change the way they do business&quot;. Plant reported that polling had showed that public recognition of the event had grown significantly, but also that awareness of who sponsored it had declined.

Historian Eric Reed notes that a DuPont marketing executive characterized the initial sponsorship as &quot;a bargain&quot;, and that the company claimed that the American press clippings generated by the event weighed . DuPont executives also reported that they valued the global media exposure as worth close to US$70 million. Reed quotes a DuPont marketing executive as stating: &quot;In 40 years in [media relations], I have never seen such concentrated, sustained and positive media coverage&quot;. However, Reed argues that despite this initial enthusiasm, &quot;the Tour DuPont&#x27;s chronic weaknesses hamstrung the event&#x27;s growth&quot;, citing its &quot;pro-am&quot; status, which prevented professional riders from being able to win world ranking points in the event. He also states that despite having an estimated worldwide television audience of 200 million, &quot;American fan enthusiasm and roadside spectator interest in the event failed to spike significantly&quot;.

DuPont&#x27;s withdrawal also came months after John DuPont, heir to the Du Pont family fortune, had been arrested for the murder of Olympic wrestler Dave Schultz. At the time of the announcement of DuPont&#x27;s discontinuation of sponsorship, Mike Plant reported that a 1997 event was tentatively scheduled for May 1–11, and that he had been in discussions with ten companies about potential title sponsorship of the race.

==Legacy==
Organizers Packer and Plant arranged another race, in China, though it was short-lived. Before their falling out, Packer reports that his &quot;idea was to have a Triple Crown of cycling–one in Asia, one in America and have the Tour de France to be the third leg&quot;. When the Tour de Georgia was first run in 2003, Tim Maloney of Cyclingnews.com referred to it as &quot;the prodigal son of Tour DuPont&quot;. In 2015, the UCI Road World Championships were held in Richmond, Virginia, which had previously hosted stages of the Tour de Trump and the Tour DuPont. In 1994, the Tour DuPont included a stage that concluded with several laps of a circuit incorporating the cobbled climb of Libby Hill Park. This hill was included in the circuit of the 2015 World Championship road races. Tour de Trump and Tour DuPont organizer Mike Plant was, according to USA Cycling, instrumental in Richmond&#x27;s bid to hold the World Championships. As a member of the UCI Management Committee, when Richmond was announced as winning the bidding for the 2015 event, Plant commented that &quot;Richmond stepped up and proved they could support world class cycling when we brought the Tour de Trump and Tour DuPont to the city in the late &#x27;80s and early &#x27;90s&quot;.

<doc id="1025272" wikidata="Q1065345" url="?curid=1025272" title="Bohr–Einstein debates">
<text>The Bohr–Einstein debates were a series of public disputes about quantum mechanics between Albert Einstein and Niels Bohr. Their debates are remembered because of their importance to the philosophy of science, insofar as the disagreements—and the outcome of Bohr&#x27;s version of quantum mechanics becoming the prevalent view—form the root of the modern understanding of physics. Most of Bohr&#x27;s version of the events held in the Solvay Conference in 1927 and other places was first written by Bohr decades later in an article titled, &quot;Discussions with Einstein on Epistemological Problems in Atomic Physics&quot;. Based on the article, the philosophical issue of the debate was whether Bohr&#x27;s Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, which centered on his belief of complementarity, was valid in explaining nature. Despite their differences of opinion and the succeeding discoveries that helped solidify quantum mechanics, Bohr and Einstein maintained a mutual admiration that was to last the rest of their lives.

Although Bohr and Einstein disagreed, they were great friends all their lives and enjoyed using each other as a foil.

==Pre-revolutionary debates==
Einstein was the first physicist to say that Max Planck&#x27;s discovery of the energy quanta would require a rewriting of the laws of physics. To support his point, in 1905 Einstein proposed that light sometimes acts as a particle which he called a light quantum (see photon and wave–particle duality). Bohr was one of the most vocal opponents of the photon idea and did not openly embrace it until 1925. The photon appealed to Einstein because he saw it as a physical reality (although a confusing one) behind the numbers presented by Planck mathematically in 1900. Bohr disliked it because it made the choice of mathematical solution arbitrary. Bohr did not like a scientist having to choose between equations. This disagreement was perhaps the first real Bohr-Einstein debate. Einstein had proposed the photon in 1905, and Arthur Compton provided experiment in 1922 with his Compton effect, but Bohr refused to believe the photon existed even then. Bohr continued to dispute the existence of the quantum of light (photon) and along with Hans Kramers and John C. Slater elaborated the BKS theory in 1924. However, after the 1925 Bothe–Geiger coincidence experiment, BKS was proved to be wrong and Einstein&#x27;s hypothesis was proven to be correct.

==The quantum revolution==
The quantum revolution of the mid-1920s occurred under the direction of both Einstein and Bohr, and their post-revolutionary debates were about making sense of the change. Werner Heisenberg&#x27;s &quot;Umdeutung&quot; paper in 1925 reinterpreted old quantum theory in terms of matrix-like operators, removing the Newtonian elements of space and time from any underlying reality. In parallel, Erwin Schrödinger redeveloped quantum theory in terms of a wave mechanics formulation, leading to the Schrödinger equation. However, when Schrödinger sent a preprint of his new equation to Einstein, Einstein wrote back hailing his equation as a decisive advance of “true genius.” Then in 1926 when Max Born, collaborating with Heisenberg, proposed that mechanics were to be understood as a probability without any causal explanation.

Both Einstein and Schrödinger rejected Born&#x27;s interpretation with its renunciation of causality which had been a key feature of science previous to old quantum theory and was still a feature of general relativity. In a 1926 letter to Max Born, Einstein wrote:

At first, even Heisenberg had heated disputes with Bohr that his matrix mechanics was not compatible with the Schrödinger&#x27;s wave mechanics. And Bohr was at first opposed to Heisenberg&#x27;s uncertainty principle. But by the Fifth Solvay Conference held in October 1927 Heisenberg and Born concluded that the revolution was over and nothing further was needed. It was at that last stage that Einstein&#x27;s skepticism turned to dismay. He believed that much had been accomplished, but the reasons for the mechanics still needed to be understood.

Einstein&#x27;s refusal to accept the revolution as complete reflected his desire to see developed a model for the underlying causes from which these apparent random statistical methods resulted. He did not reject the idea that positions in space-time could never be completely known but did not want to allow the uncertainty principle to necessitate a seemingly random, non-deterministic mechanism by which the laws of physics operated. Einstein himself was a statistical thinker but denied that no more needed to be discovered or clarified. Einstein worked the rest of his life to discover a new theory that would make sense of quantum mechanics and return causality to science, what many now call the theory of everything. Bohr, meanwhile, was dismayed by none of the elements that troubled Einstein. He made his own peace with the contradictions by proposing a principle of complementarity that assigns properties only as result of measurements.

==Post-revolution: First stage==
As mentioned above, Einstein&#x27;s position underwent significant modifications over the course of the years. In the first stage, Einstein refused to accept quantum indeterminism and sought to demonstrate that the uncertainty principle could be violated, suggesting ingenious thought experiments which should permit the accurate determination of incompatible variables, such as position and velocity, or to explicitly reveal simultaneously the wave and the particle aspects of the same process. (The main source and substance for these thought experiments is solely from Bohr&#x27;s account twenty years later.) Bohr admits: “As regards the account of the conversations I am of course aware that I am relying only on my own memory, just as I am prepared for the possibility that many features of the development of quantum theory, in which Einstein has played so large a part, may appear to himself in a different light.”

=== Einstein&#x27;s argument ===
The first serious attack by Einstein on the &quot;orthodox&quot; conception took place during the Fifth Solvay International Conference on &quot;Electrons and Photons&quot; in 1927. Einstein pointed out how it was possible to take advantage of the (universally accepted) laws of conservation of energy and of impulse (momentum) in order to obtain information on the state of a particle in a process of interference which, according to the principle of indeterminacy or that of complementarity, should not be accessible.

In order to follow his argumentation and to evaluate Bohr&#x27;s response, it is convenient to refer to the experimental apparatus illustrated in figure A. A beam of light perpendicular to the &quot;X&quot; axis (here aligned vertically) propagates in the direction &quot;z&quot; and encounters a screen &quot;S&quot;1 with a narrow (relative to the wavelength of the ray) slit. After having passed through the slit, the wave function diffracts with an angular opening that causes it to encounter a second screen &quot;S&quot;2 with two slits. The successive propagation of the wave results in the formation of the interference figure on the final screen &quot;F&quot;.

At the passage through the two slits of the second screen &quot;S&quot;2, the wave aspects of the process become essential. In fact, it is precisely the interference between the two terms of the quantum superposition corresponding to states in which the particle is localized in one of the two slits which produces zones of constructive and destructive interference (in which the wave function is nullified). It is also important to note that any experiment designed to evidence the &quot;corpuscular&quot; aspects of the process at the passage of the screen &quot;S&quot;2 (which, in this case, reduces to the determination of which slit the particle has passed through) inevitably destroys the wave aspects, implies the disappearance of the interference figure and the emergence of two concentrated spots of diffraction which confirm our knowledge of the trajectory followed by the particle.

At this point Einstein brings into play the first screen as well and argues as follows: since the incident particles have velocities (practically) perpendicular to the screen &quot;S&quot;1, and since it is only the interaction with this screen that can cause a deflection from the original direction of propagation, by the law of conservation of impulse which implies that the sum of the impulses of two systems which interact is conserved, if the incident particle is deviated toward the top, the screen will recoil toward the bottom and vice versa. In realistic conditions the mass of the screen is so large that it will remain stationary, but, in principle, it is possible to measure even an infinitesimal recoil. If we imagine taking the measurement of the impulse of the screen in the direction &quot;X&quot; after every single particle has passed, we can know, from the fact that the screen will be found recoiled toward the top (bottom), whether the particle in question has been deviated toward the bottom or top, and therefore through which slit in &quot;S&quot;2 the particle has passed. But since the determination of the direction of the recoil of the screen after the particle has passed cannot influence the successive development of the process, we will still have an interference figure on the screen &quot;F&quot;. The interference takes place precisely because the state of the system is the &quot;superposition&quot; of two states whose wave functions are non-zero only near one of the two slits. On the other hand, if every particle passes through only the slit &quot;b&quot; or the slit &quot;c&quot;, then the set of systems is the statistical mixture of the two states, which means that interference is not possible. If Einstein is correct, then there is a violation of the principle of indeterminacy.

This thought experiment was begun in a simpler form during the general discussion portion of the actual proceedings during the 1927 Solvay conference. In those official proceedings, Bohr&#x27;s reply is recorded as: “I feel myself in a very difficult position because I don’t understand precisely the point that Einstein is trying to make.” Einstein had explained, “it could happen that the same elementary process produces an action in two or several places on the screen. But the interpretation, according to which psi squared expresses the probability that this particular particle is found at a given point, assumes an entirely peculiar mechanism of action at a distance.” It is clear from this that Einstein was referring to separability (in particular, and most importantly local causality, i.e. locality), not indeterminacy. In fact, Paul Ehrenfest wrote a letter to Bohr stating that the 1927 thought experiments of Einstein had nothing to do with the uncertainty principle, as Einstein had already accepted these “and for a long time never doubted.”

=== Bohr&#x27;s response ===
Bohr evidently misunderstood Einstein&#x27;s argument about the quantum mechanical violation of relativistic causality (locality) and instead focused on the consistency of quantum indeterminacy. Bohr&#x27;s response was to illustrate Einstein&#x27;s idea more clearly using the diagram in Figure C. (Figure C shows a fixed screen S1 that is bolted down. Then try to imagine one that can slide up or down along a rod instead of a fixed bolt.) Bohr observes that extremely precise knowledge of any (potential) vertical motion of the screen is an essential presupposition in Einstein&#x27;s argument. In fact, if its velocity in the direction &quot;X&quot; &quot;before&quot; the passage of the particle is not known with a precision substantially greater than that induced by the recoil (that is, if it were already moving vertically with an unknown and greater velocity than that which it derives as a consequence of the contact with the particle), then the determination of its motion after the passage of the particle would not give the information we seek. However, Bohr continues, an extremely precise determination of the velocity of the screen, when one applies the principle of indeterminacy, implies an inevitable imprecision of its position in the direction &quot;X&quot;. Before the process even begins, the screen would therefore occupy an indeterminate position at least to a certain extent (defined by the formalism). Now consider, for example, the point &quot;d&quot; in figure A, where the interference is destructive. Any displacement of the first screen would make the lengths of the two paths, &quot;a–b–d&quot; and &quot;a–c–d&quot;, different from those indicated in the figure. If the difference between the two paths varies by half a wavelength, at point &quot;d&quot; there will be constructive rather than destructive interference. The ideal experiment must average over all the possible positions of the screen S1, and, for every position, there corresponds, for a certain fixed point &quot;F&quot;, a different type of interference, from the perfectly destructive to the perfectly constructive. The effect of this averaging is that the pattern of interference on the screen &quot;F&quot; will be uniformly grey. Once more, our attempt to evidence the corpuscular aspects in &quot;S&quot;2 has destroyed the possibility of interference in &quot;F&quot;, which depends crucially on the wave aspects.

As Bohr recognized, for the understanding of this phenomenon &quot;it is decisive that, contrary to genuine instruments of measurement, these bodies along with the particles would constitute, in the case under examination, the system to which the quantum-mechanical formalism must apply. With respect to the precision of the conditions under which one can correctly apply the formalism, it is essential to include the entire experimental apparatus. In fact, the introduction of any new apparatus, such as a mirror, in the path of a particle could introduce new effects of interference which influence essentially the predictions about the results which will be registered at the end.&quot; Further along, Bohr attempts to resolve this ambiguity concerning which parts of the system should be considered macroscopic and which not:

:&quot;In particular, it must be very clear that...the unambiguous use of spatiotemporal concepts in the description of atomic phenomena must be limited to the registration of observations which refer to images on a photographic lens or to analogous practically irreversible effects of amplification such as the formation of a drop of water around an ion in a dark room.&quot;

Bohr&#x27;s argument about the impossibility of using the apparatus proposed by Einstein to violate the principle of indeterminacy depends crucially on the fact that a macroscopic system (the screen &quot;S&quot;1) obeys quantum laws. On the other hand, Bohr consistently held that, in order to illustrate the microscopic aspects of reality, it is necessary to set off a process of amplification, which involves macroscopic apparatuses, whose fundamental characteristic is that of obeying classical laws and which can be described in classical terms. This ambiguity would later come back in the form of what is still called today the measurement problem.

However, Bohr in his article refuting the EPR paper, states “there is no question of a mechanical disturbance of the system under investigation.” Heisenberg quotes Bohr as saying, “I find all such assertions as ‘observation introduces uncertainty into the phenomenon’ inaccurate and misleading.” Manjit Kumar&#x27;s book on the Bohr–Einstein debates finds these assertions by Bohr contrary to his arguments. Others, such as the physicist Leon Rosenfeld, did find Bohr&#x27;s argument convincing.

===Uncertainty principle applied to time and energy===

In many textbook examples and popular discussions of quantum mechanics, the principle of indeterminacy is explained by reference to the pair of variables position and velocity (or momentum). It is important to note that the wave nature of physical processes implies that there must exist another relation of indeterminacy: that between time and energy. In order to comprehend this relation, it is convenient to refer to the experiment illustrated in
Figure D, which results in the propagation of a wave which is limited in spatial extension. Assume that, as illustrated in the figure, a ray which is extremely extended longitudinally is propagated toward a screen with a slit furnished with a shutter which remains open only for a very brief interval of time formula_1. Beyond the slit, there will be a wave of limited spatial extension which continues to propagate toward the right.

A perfectly monochromatic wave (such as a musical note which cannot be divided into harmonics) has infinite spatial extent. In order to have a wave which is limited in spatial extension (which is technically called a wave packet), several waves of different frequencies must be superimposed and distributed continuously within a certain interval of frequencies around an average value, such as formula_2.
It then happens that at a certain instant, there exists a spatial region (which moves over time) in which the contributions of the various fields of the superposition add up constructively. Nonetheless, according to a precise mathematical theorem, as we move far away from this region, the phases of the various fields, at any specified point, are distributed causally and destructive interference is produced. The region in which the wave has non-zero amplitude is therefore spatially limited. It is easy to demonstrate that, if the wave has a spatial extension equal to formula_3 (which means, in our example, that the shutter has remained open for a time formula_4 where v is the velocity of the wave), then the wave contains (or is a superposition of) various monochromatic waves whose frequencies cover an interval formula_5 which satisfies the relation:

: formula_6

Remembering that in the Planck relation, frequency and energy are proportional:

: formula_7

it follows immediately from the preceding inequality that the particle associated with the wave should possess an energy which is not perfectly defined (since different frequencies are involved in the superposition) and consequently there is indeterminacy in energy:

: formula_8

From this it follows immediately that:

: formula_9

which is the relation of indeterminacy between time and energy.

===Einstein&#x27;s second criticism===

At the sixth Congress of Solvay in 1930, the indeterminacy relation just discussed was Einstein&#x27;s target of criticism. His idea contemplates the existence of an experimental apparatus which was subsequently designed by Bohr in such a way as to emphasize the essential elements and the key points which he would use in his response.

Einstein considers a box (called Einstein&#x27;s box, or Einstein&#x27;s light box; see figure) containing electromagnetic radiation and a clock which controls the opening of a shutter which covers a hole made in one of the walls of the box. The shutter uncovers the hole for a time formula_1 which can be chosen arbitrarily. During the opening, we are to suppose that a photon, from among those inside the box, escapes through the hole. In this way a wave of limited spatial extension has been created, following the explanation given above. In order to challenge the indeterminacy relation between time and energy, it is necessary to find a way to determine with adequate precision the energy that the photon has brought with it. At this point, Einstein turns to mass–energy equivalence of special relativity: formula_11. From this it follows that knowledge of the mass of an object provides a precise indication about its energy. The argument is therefore very simple: if one weighs the box before and after the opening of the shutter and if a certain amount of energy has escaped from the box, the box will be lighter. The variation in mass multiplied by formula_12
will provide precise knowledge of the energy emitted.
Moreover, the clock will indicate the precise time at which the event of the particle&#x27;s emission took place. Since, in principle, the mass of the box can be determined to an arbitrary degree of accuracy, the energy emitted can be determined with a precision formula_13 as accurate as one desires. Therefore, the product formula_14 can be rendered less than what is implied by the principle of indeterminacy.

The idea is particularly acute and the argument seemed unassailable. It&#x27;s important to consider the impact of all of these exchanges on the people involved at the time. Leon Rosenfeld, who had participated in the Congress, described the event several years later:

:&quot;It was a real shock for Bohr...who, at first, could not think of a solution. For the entire evening he was extremely agitated, and he continued passing from one scientist to another, seeking to persuade them that it could not be the case, that it would have been the end of physics if Einstein were right; but he couldn&#x27;t come up with any way to resolve the paradox. I will never forget the image of the two antagonists as they left the club: Einstein, with his tall and commanding figure, who walked tranquilly, with a mildly ironic smile, and Bohr who trotted along beside him, full of excitement...The morning after saw the triumph of Bohr.&quot;

===Bohr&#x27;s triumph===
The triumph of Bohr consisted in his demonstrating, once again, that Einstein&#x27;s subtle argument was not conclusive, but even more so in the way that he arrived at this conclusion by appealing precisely to one of the great ideas of Einstein: the principle of equivalence between gravitational mass and inertial mass, together with the time dilation of special relativity, and a consequence of these—the gravitational redshift. Bohr showed that, in order for Einstein&#x27;s experiment to function, the box would have to be suspended on a spring in the middle of a gravitational field. In order to obtain a measurement of the weight of the box, a pointer would have to be attached to the box which corresponded with the index on a scale. After the release of a photon, a mass formula_15 could be added to the box to restore it to its original position and this would allow us to determine the energy formula_16 that was lost when the photon left. The box is immersed in a gravitational field of strength formula_17, and the gravitational redshift affects the speed of the clock, yielding uncertainty formula_1 in the time formula_19 required for the pointer to return to its original position. Bohr gave the following calculation establishing the uncertainty relation formula_20.

Let the uncertainty in the mass formula_15 be denoted by formula_22. Let the error in the position of the pointer be formula_23. Adding the load formula_15 to the box imparts a momentum formula_25 that we can measure with an accuracy formula_26, where formula_27 ≈ formula_28. Clearly formula_29, and therefore formula_30. By the redshift formula (which follows from the principle of equivalence and the time dilation), the uncertainty in the time formula_19 is formula_32, and formula_33, and so formula_34. We have therefore proven the claimed formula_35.

More recent analyses of the photon box debate questions Bohr&#x27;s understanding of Einstein&#x27;s thought experiment, referring instead to a prelude to the EPR paper, focusing on inseparability rather than indeterminism being at issue.

==Post-revolution: Second stage==

The second phase of Einstein&#x27;s &quot;debate&quot; with Bohr and the orthodox interpretation is characterized by an acceptance of the fact that it is, as a practical matter, impossible to simultaneously determine the values of certain incompatible quantities, but the rejection that this implies that these quantities do not actually have precise values. Einstein rejects the probabilistic interpretation of Born and insists that quantum probabilities are epistemic and not ontological in nature. As a consequence, the theory must be incomplete in some way. He recognizes the great value of the theory, but suggests that it &quot;does not tell the whole story&quot;, and, while providing an appropriate description at a certain level, it gives no information on the more fundamental underlying level:

:&quot;I have the greatest consideration for the goals which are pursued by the physicists of the latest generation which go under the name of quantum mechanics, and I believe that this theory represents a profound level of truth, but I also believe that the restriction to laws of a statistical nature will turn out to be transitory...Without doubt quantum mechanics has grasped an important fragment of the truth and will be a paragon for all future fundamental theories, for the fact that it must be deducible as a limiting case from such foundations, just as electrostatics is deducible from Maxwell&#x27;s equations of the electromagnetic field or as thermodynamics is deducible from statistical mechanics.&quot;

These thoughts of Einstein would set off a line of research into hidden variable theories, such as the Bohm interpretation, in an attempt to complete the edifice of quantum theory. If quantum mechanics can be made &quot;complete&quot; in Einstein&#x27;s sense, it cannot be done locally; this fact was demonstrated by John Stewart Bell with the formulation of Bell&#x27;s inequality in 1964. Although, the Bell inequality ruled out local hidden variable theories, Bohm&#x27;s theory was not ruled out. A 2007 experiment ruled out a large class of non-Bohmian non-local hidden variable theories, though not Bohmian mechanics itself.

==Post-revolution: Third stage==
===The argument of EPR===
In 1935 Einstein, Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen developed an argument, published in the magazine &quot;Physical Review&quot; with the title &quot;Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?&quot;, based on an entangled state of two systems. Before coming to this argument, it is necessary to formulate another hypothesis that comes out of Einstein&#x27;s work in relativity: the principle of locality. &quot;The elements of physical reality which are objectively possessed cannot be influenced instantaneously at a distance.&quot;

David Bohm picked up the EPR argument in 1951. In his textbook &quot;Quantum Theory,&quot; he reformulated it in terms of an entangled state of two particles, which can be summarized as follows:

1) Consider a system of two photons which at time &quot;t&quot; are located, respectively, in the spatially distant regions &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; and which are also in the entangled state of polarization formula_36 described below:

:formula_37

2) At time &quot;t&quot; the photon in region A is tested for vertical polarization. Suppose that the result of the measurement is that the photon passes through the filter. According to the reduction of the wave packet, the result is that, at time &quot;t&quot; + &quot;dt&quot;, the system becomes

: formula_38

3) At this point, the observer in A who carried out the first measurement on photon &quot;1&quot;, without doing anything else that could disturb the system or the other photon (&quot;assumption (R)&quot;, below), can predict with certainty that photon &quot;2&quot; will pass a test of vertical polarization. It follows that photon &quot;2&quot; possesses an element of physical reality: that of having a vertical polarization.

4) According to the assumption of locality, it cannot have been the action carried out in A which created this element of reality for photon &quot;2&quot;. Therefore, we must conclude that the photon possessed the property of being able to pass the vertical polarization test &quot;before&quot; and &quot;independently of&quot; the measurement of photon &quot;1&quot;.

5) At time &quot;t&quot;, the observer in &quot;A&quot; could have decided to carry out a test of polarization at 45°, obtaining a certain result, for example, that the photon passes the test. In that case, he could have concluded that photon &quot;2&quot; turned out to be polarized at 45°. Alternatively, if the photon did not pass the test, he could have concluded that photon &quot;2&quot; turned out to be polarized at 135°. Combining one of these alternatives with the conclusion reached in 4, it seems that photon &quot;2&quot;, before the measurement took place, possessed both the property of being able to pass with certainty a test of vertical polarization and the property of being able to pass with certainty a test of polarization at either 45° or 135°. These properties are incompatible according to the formalism.

6) Since natural and obvious requirements have forced the conclusion that photon &quot;2&quot; simultaneously possesses incompatible properties, this means that, even if it is not possible to determine these properties simultaneously and with arbitrary precision, they are nevertheless possessed objectively by the system. But quantum mechanics denies this possibility and it is therefore an incomplete theory.

===Bohr&#x27;s response===
Bohr&#x27;s response to this argument was published, five months later than the original publication of EPR, in the same magazine &quot;Physical Review&quot; and with exactly the same title as the original. The crucial point of Bohr&#x27;s answer is distilled in a passage which he later had republished in Paul Arthur Schilpp&#x27;s book &quot;Albert Einstein, scientist-philosopher&quot; in honor of the seventieth birthday of Einstein. Bohr attacks assumption (R) of EPR by stating:

:&quot;The statement of the criterion in question is ambiguous with regard to the expression &quot;without disturbing the system in any way&quot;. Naturally, in this case no mechanical disturbance of the system under examination can take place in the crucial stage of the process of measurement. But even in this stage there arises the essential problem of an influence on the precise conditions which define the possible types of prediction which regard the subsequent behaviour of the system...their arguments do not justify their conclusion that the quantum description turns out to be essentially incomplete...This description can be characterized as a rational use of the possibilities of an unambiguous interpretation of the process of measurement compatible with the finite and uncontrollable interaction between the object and the instrument of measurement in the context of quantum theory&quot;.

Bohr&#x27;s presentation of his argument was hard to follow for many of the scientists (although his views were generally accepted). Rosenfeld, who had worked closely with Bohr for many years, later explains Bohr&#x27;s argument in a way that is perhaps more accessible:

:&quot;In the case of the two particles, it is true that the measurement carried out on the first particle does not cause any direct physical disturbance of the second; but the measurement decisively affects the nature of verifiable predictions we will be able to make about this second particle. (...) [A]s long as we do not carry out any measurement (...) we have no control at all over this correlation [between the two particles]. If we really want the system to be subject to study and communication, we must carry out some measurement. If we now observe the position of the first particle, the correlation between the positions of the particles can be used to give us information about where the second particle is, but we have no way of making use of the correlation between the pulses of the particles (...). If we observe the momentum of the first particle, it is just the opposite. We retain control over the momentum correlation, but lose it over the position correlation. The two different measurements define two complementary phenomena that can never be reconciled into a single description of the given two-particle system&quot;.

===Confirmatory experiments===

Years after the exposition of Einstein via his EPR experiment, many physicists started performing experiments to show that Einstein&#x27;s view of a spooky action in a distance is indeed consistent with the laws of physics. The first experiment to definitively prove that this was the case was in 1949, when physicists Chien-Shiung Wu and her colleague Irving Shaknov showcased this theory in real time using photons. Their work was published in the new year of the succeeding decade.

Later in 1975, Alain Aspect proposed in an article, an experiment meticulous enough to be irrefutable: &quot;Proposed experiment to test the non-separability of quantum mechanics&quot;. This led Aspect, together with his assistant Gérard Roger, and Jean Dalibard and (two young physics students at the time) to set up several increasingly complex experiments between 1980 and 1982 that further established quantum entanglement. Finally in 1998, the Geneva experiment tested the correlation between two detectors set 30 kilometres apart, virtually across the whole city, using the Swiss optical fibre telecommunication network. The distance gave the necessary time to commute the angles of the polarizers. It was therefore possible to have a completely random electrical shunting. Furthermore, the two distant polarizers were entirely independent. The measurements were recorded on each side, and compared after each experiment by dating each measurement using an atomic clock. The experiment once again verified entanglement under the strictest and most ideal conditions possible. If Aspect&#x27;s experiment implied that a hypothetical coordination signal travel twice as fast as &quot;c&quot;, Geneva&#x27;s reached 10 million times &quot;c&quot;.

==Post-revolution: Fourth stage==
In his last writing on the topic, Einstein further refined his position, making it completely clear that what really disturbed him about the quantum theory was the problem of the total renunciation of all minimal standards of realism, even at the microscopic level, that the acceptance of the completeness of the theory implied. Since the early days of quantum theory the assumption of locality and Lorentz invariance guided his thoughts and led to his determination that if we demand strict locality then hidden variables are naturally implied apropos EPR. Bell, starting from this EPR logic (which is widely misunderstood or forgotten) showed that local hidden variables imply a conflict with experiment. Ultimately what was at stake for Einstein was the assumption that physical reality be universally local. Although the majority of experts in the field agree that Einstein was wrong, the current understanding is still not complete (see Interpretation of quantum mechanics).

<text>Sir Henri-Elzéar Taschereau, (October 7, 1836 – April 14, 1911) was a Canadian jurist and the fourth Chief Justice of Canada.

==Career==
Taschereau was born in his family&#x27;s seigneurial manor house at Sainte-Marie-de-la-Beauce, Lower Canada to Pierre-Elzéar Taschereau and Catherine Hénédine Dionne. Tashereau attended the Université Laval and was called to the Bar of Quebec in 1857. That same year he married Marie-Antoinette de Lotbiniere Harwood (d. 1896), daughter of Robert Unwin Harwood, and they were the parents of seven children. He married his second wife, Marie-Louise Panet, in 1897 and fathered three more children.

He practiced law in Quebec City and entered politics in 1861 when he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of what was then the Province of Canada where he opposed Canadian Confederation. He was appointed a judge of the Quebec Superior Court in 1871 and to the Supreme Court of Canada in 1878 following the retirement of Jean-Thomas Taschereau (see below), and also taught law part-time at the University of Ottawa. He was made a knight bachelor on 14 August 1902, after the honour had been announced in the 1902 Coronation Honours list published on 26 June 1902. In November 1902 he became Chief Justice serving for four years until his retirement in 1906. He became a member of the British Privy Council in 1904, which entitled him to sit on the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.

==Family==
Taschereau was the great, great grandson of Thomas-Jacques Taschereau, the patriarch of the family in Canada. He was first-cousin once-removed to the brothers Elzéar Alexandre Cardinal Taschereau and Supreme Court Justice Jean-Thomas Taschereau. Jean-Thomas&#x27;s son Louis-Alexandre would serve as Premier of Quebec. His grandson Robert Taschereau would also serve as Chief Justice of Canada.

Henri-Elzéar Taschereau married at Vaudreuil, Quebec May 27, 1857, to Marie Antoinette Harwood, daughter of the Hon. R. U. Harwood, Seigneur of Vaudreuil, and his wife, Marie Louise Josephte Chartier de Lotbiniere. The couple had seven children. She died at Ottawa, June 2, 1896. Her remains were interred in the parish church of Vaudreuil.

Henri-Elzéar Taschereau married at Ottawa, March 22, 1897 his second wife Marie Louise Panet, daughter of Charles Panet, Clerk of Private Bills, House of Commons, Ottawa, and his wife, Euphemie Chateauvert. Marie Louise was born in Ottawa, February 29, 1868, and received her education at the Convent of the Sacred Heart (Grey Nuns) in Ottawa. The couple lived at 363 Theodore Street, Ottawa. The couple had two sons. Charles Elzear de Montarville Taschereau was born in Ottawa on October 5, 1898. Henri Edouard Panet Taschereau was born at Ottawa, August 9, 1902.

<text>Wilhelm Fabry (also William Fabry, Guilelmus Fabricius Hildanus, or Fabricius von Hilden) (25 June 1560 − 15 February 1634), often called the &quot;Father of German surgery&quot;, was the first educated and scientific German surgeon. He is one of the most prominent scholars in the iatromechanics school and author of 20 medical books. His , published posthumously in 1641, is the best collection of case records of the century and gives clear insight into the variety and methods of his surgical practice. He developed novel surgical techniques and new surgical instruments. He also wrote a notable treatise on burns.

Fabry was born in Hilden. In 1579, he became () in Düsseldorf of the extraordinary court surgeon Cosmas Slot.

He developed a device for operating eye tumours. On 25 July 1587, he married Marie Colinet (or &quot;Fabry&quot;), daughter of Eustache Colinet, a Genevese printer. She was a Swiss midwife–surgeon who improved the techniques of cesarean section delivery. She helped her husband in his surgical practice and was the first (in 1624) to use a magnet to extract metal from a patient&#x27;s eye (a technique still in use today). Fabry wrote a detailed description of the procedure in his &quot;Centuriae&quot; and, although he explicitly mentioned his wife as having invented it, was given credit for the discovery.

From 1602 to 1615, Fabry was a city surgeon in Payerne, Switzerland, and Lausanne. He was then made city surgeon () of Bern by appointment of the city council, a role he held until the year of his death.

The city of Bern, where he died, named a street after him (&quot;Hildanus&quot;strasse), using one of the Latin versions of his name.

His birth town named the city museum (featuring surgical instruments and the like) after him, honoured him with a bronze bust in the market place, and named streets after himself and after his wife.

<text>Himilco was a Carthaginian navigator and explorer who lived during the late 6th or early 5th century BC, a period of time where Carthage held significant sway over its neighboring regions.

Himilco is the first known explorer from the Mediterranean Sea to reach the northwestern shores of Europe. His lost account of his adventures is quoted by Roman writers. The oldest reference to Himilco&#x27;s voyage is a brief mention in &quot;Natural History&quot; (2.169a) by the Roman scholar Pliny the Elder. Himilco was quoted three times by Rufius Festus Avienius, who wrote &quot;Ora Maritima&quot;, a poetical account of the geography in the 4th century AD. 

Little is known of Himilco himself. Some believe that Himilco sailed north along the Atlantic coast from the Iberian Peninsula to the British Isles. However, no hard archeological or DNA evidence has been found to suggest that he arrived in Britain, nor is his voyage mentioned by subsequent English (Bede) or Irish historians. He traveled to northwestern France, as well as the territory of the Oestrimini tribe living in Portugal, likely in order to trade for tin (to be used for making bronze) and other precious metals. Records of the voyages of Himilco also mention the islands of Albion and Ierne. Avienius asserts that the outward journey to the Oestriminis took the Carthaginians four months. Himilco followed the northern Atlantic trade route used by the Tartessians of southern Iberia, according to Avienius.

Himilco described his journeys as quite harrowing, repeatedly reporting sea monsters and seaweed, likely in order to deter Greek rivals from competing on their new trade routes. Carthaginian accounts of monsters became one source of the myths discouraging sailing in the Atlantic.

<text>Edward Leonard Greenspan, (February 28, 1944December 24, 2014) was one of Canada&#x27;s most famous defence lawyers, and a prolific author of legal volumes. His fame was owed to numerous high-profile clients and to his national exposure on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation radio series (and later a CBC television series) &quot;Scales of Justice&quot; (1982–94).

==Life and career==
A graduate of University College, Toronto (1965) and Osgoode Hall Law School (1968), Greenspan was called to the Ontario Bar in 1970 and was the senior partner of the Toronto law firm of Greenspan Partners LLP. He was a vice president of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association. He was a member of the Quadrangle Society and a Senior Fellow of Massey College at the University of Toronto. Greenspan became a Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1982. In 1991 in Boston Massachusetts, he was inducted into the American College of Trial Lawyers.

Greenspan&#x27;s work as a criminal defence lawyer was widely recognized in the form of honorary degrees and medals. In 1999 the Law Society of Upper Canada awarded him an Honorary Doctor of Laws. He was awarded the G. Arthur Martin Medal in 2001. He received a Doctorate of Civil Laws from the University of Windsor in 2002, Assumption University in 2004 and Brock University in 2012. He was awarded the Advocates&#x27; Society Medal in 2009 and the highest honour to be bestowed on an Ontario Lawyer, the Law Society Medal.

In December 1983, Greenspan found himself marginally involved in the murder of the gangster Domenic Racco. The gangster Giuseppe Avigone saw Greenspan to ask him to cash the $8, 000 cheque that Racco had with him when he was killed, a request that Greenspan refused. 

A Canadian of Jewish heritage, Greenspan was a vocal supporter of Israel and related issues. On October 10, 2002, he and fellow Toronto lawyer David C. Nathanson published an opinion piece in the &quot;National Post&quot; arguing that the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency should recognize the Magen David Adom as a charitable organization.

Greenspan was an outspoken opponent of the death penalty. In 1986, when the House of Commons of Canada was debating a proposal to reinstate capital punishment in Canada, Greenspan suspended his practice for three months in order to tour the country and debate the issue in any forum available. The proposal was ultimately defeated. In 2001 he argued and won a case at the Supreme Court of Canada which barred extradition of people from Canada to face possible capital punishment in other countries.

Greenspan was partners with some of the most accomplished lawyers in Canada. Greenspan&#x27;s former partners include: Michael Moldaver (Supreme Court of Canada Judge), Marc Rosenberg (Judge of the Ontario Court of Appeal), Marie Henein and Todd B. White. As of 1986, he was reported to have billed $1.1 million for one murder case; when asked to disclose his fee, he suggested the reporter &quot;get charged with a criminal offence, come to my office and I&#x27;ll be happy to talk to you&quot;. Greenspan was an outspoken critic of Prime Minister Stephen Harper&#x27;s criminal justice legislation, including in a 2012 opinion piece in magazine &quot;The Walrus&quot; and a 2013 opinion piece in newspaper &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;.

He was the subject of a documentary film, &quot;A Criminal Mind&quot;, directed by Barry Avrich.

==Death==
Greenspan died of heart failure at the age of 70 while vacationing in Phoenix, Arizona in December 2014. Greenspan&#x27;s funeral was held at Beth Torah Synagogue in Toronto with burial at Mount Pleasant Cemetery.

Toronto Mayor John Tory said of Greenspan, &quot;Life as a defence lawyer isn&#x27;t always easy. Edward Greenspan was a larger than life figure in legal circles, our city and country. He was a brilliant lawyer who understood how important it is that everyone have a defence, and he was a tireless champion for human rights. On top of that he was a great citizen and a wonderful human being. On my own behalf, and on behalf of the people of Toronto, I offer my sincere condolences to his family. He will truly be missed.&quot;

The Ontario MPP Jagmeet Singh reflected on Greenspan&#x27;s career in fighting for &quot;societies marginalized&quot; as being an inspiration.

==Personal and family==
His brother, Brian Greenspan, is also a Canadian lawyer.

== Clients ==

<doc id="1025345" wikidata="Q5251402" url="?curid=1025345" title="Defense Message System">
<text>The Defense Message System or Defense Messaging System (DMS) is a deployment of secure electronic mail and directory services in the United States Department of Defense. DMS was intended to replace the AUTODIN network, and is based on implementations of the OSI X.400 mail, X.500 directory and X.509 public key certificates, with several extensions to meet the specific needs of military messaging. 

DMS is sometimes operated in conjunction with third-party products, such as the Navy&#x27;s DMDS (Defense Message Dissemination System), a profiling system that takes a message and forwards it, based on message criteria, to parties that are required to take action on a message. This combination has met with success with the upper echelons of command, since parties do not have to wait for messaging center operators to route the messages to the proper channels for action. The Navy also uses Navy Regional Enterprise Messaging System (NREMS). NREMS uses an AMHS backend to send secure Organizational Messages via a web interface to Naval commands. 

The US Army&#x27;s version of DMS is run solely on an AMHS platform both for CONUS and OCONUS operations. The Pentagon Telecommunications Center (PTC) is the hub for CONUS operations and there are several AMHS sites OCONUS for strategic messaging. In the tactical environment the Army deploys an independent Tactical Message Systems (TMS) that is also built on an AMHS platform for secure messaging capability in austere environments when communications with OCONUS AMHS sites are unavailable. 

DMS has been coordinated by the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), and testing began in 1995. DMS has many third-party vendor products, such as DMDS, DMDS Proxy MR, CP-XP (the CommPower XML Portal), AMHS (Automated Message Handling System), MMHS, and CMS 1.0.

<text>The Leningrad affair, or Leningrad case (, &quot;Leningradskoye delo&quot;), was a series of criminal cases fabricated in the late 1940s–early 1950s by Joseph Stalin in order to accuse a number of prominent Leningrad based authority figures and members of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of treason and intention to create an anti-Soviet, Russian nationalist, organization based in the city. This happened in the aftermath of the Siege of Leningrad during the war, the victorious end of which led to the mayor, his deputies and others who kept Nazi German forces out of the city earning fame and strong support as heroes all over the USSR. 

==Preamble==
Moscow and Leningrad were two competing power centers in the Soviet Union. Researchers argue that the motivation behind the cases was Joseph Stalin&#x27;s fear of competition from the younger and popular Leningrad leaders – who had been fêted as heroes following the city&#x27;s siege. Stalin&#x27;s desire to keep power was combined with his deep distrust of anyone from Leningrad from the time of Stalin&#x27;s involvement in the Russian Revolution, Russian Civil War, execution of Grigory Zinoviev and the Right Opposition. In this earlier time, among Stalin&#x27;s competitors from Leningrad who were also assassinated were two former leaders of the city, Sergei Kirov and Leon Trotsky, whose appointed subordinates continued to work in the city government for years after they left office. During the siege of Leningrad, the city leaders were relatively autonomous from Moscow. Survivors of the siege became national heroes, and leaders of Leningrad again gained much clout in the Soviet central government in Moscow.

==Events==

In January 1949 Pyotr Popkov, Alexey Kuznetsov and Nikolai Voznesensky organised a Leningrad Trade Fair to boost the post-war economy and support the survivors of the Siege of Leningrad with goods and services from other regions of the Soviet Union. The fair was attacked by official Soviet propaganda, and was falsely portrayed as a scheme to use the federal budget from Moscow for business development in Leningrad, although the budget and economics of such a trade fair were normal and legitimate and approved by State Planning Commission and the government of the USSR. Other accusations included that Kuznetsov, Popkov and others tried to re-establish Leningrad&#x27;s historic and political importance as a former capital of Russia, thus competing with the Moscow-centered communist government. The initial accuser was Georgy Malenkov, Stalin&#x27;s first deputy. Then formal accusations were formulated by the Communist Party and signed by Malenkov, Khrushchev and Lavrentiy Beria. Over two thousand people from the Leningrad city government and regional authorities were arrested. Also arrested were many industrial managers, scientists and university professors. The city and regional authorities in Leningrad were swiftly occupied by pro-Stalin communists transplanted from Moscow. Several important politicians were arrested in Moscow and other cities across the Soviet Union.

As a result of the first prosecution, on 30 September 1950, Nikolai Voznesensky (chairman of Gosplan), Mikhail Rodionov (Chairman of the RSFSR Council of Ministers), Alexey Kuznetsov, Pyotr Popkov, Ya. F. Kapustin and P. G. Lazutin were sentenced to death on false accusations of embezzlement of the Soviet State budget for &quot;unapproved business in Leningrad&quot;, which was labeled as anti-Soviet treason. Several of those prosecuted were also accused of Russian chauvinism for their desire to create a separate Russian Communist Party.

==Executions==
The verdict was announced behind closed doors after midnight and the six main defendants, including the mayor of the city, were executed by shooting on 1 October 1950. Stalin&#x27;s government had reinstated the death penalty in the Soviet Union on 12 January 1950; it had previously been repealed in 1947. It was applied to the accused retroactively. Over 200 Leningrad officials were sentenced to prison terms from 10 to 25 years. Their families were stripped of rights to live and work in any major city, thus limiting their lives to Siberia and other remote regions of the country. 
About 2,000 of Leningrad&#x27;s public figures were removed from their positions and exiled from their city, thus losing their homes and other property. All of them were repressed, together with their relatives. Respected intellectuals, scientists, writers and educators, many of whom were pillars of the city&#x27;s community, were exiled or imprisoned in the Gulag prison camps. Intellectuals were harshly persecuted for the slightest signs of dissent, such as Nikolai Punin, who was killed in a prison camp for expressing his dislike of Soviet propaganda and &quot;tasteless&quot; Lenin portraits.

The Leningrad affair was organised and supervised by Malenkov and Beria. Executions and purges were done by Viktor Abakumov and the MGB. The graves of the executed leaders of Leningrad were never marked and their exact locations are still unknown.

All of the accused were later rehabilitated during the Khrushchev Thaw, many of them posthumously.

Alexei Kosygin, the future Chairman of the Council of Ministers, and Iosif Shikin, the political director of the Red Army, survived but their political careers were hampered for some time.

<text>A bush plane is a general aviation aircraft used to provide both scheduled and unscheduled passenger and flight services to remote, undeveloped areas, such as the Canadian north or bush, Alaskan tundra, the African bush, or savanna, Amazon rainforest and the Australian Outback. They are used where ground transportation infrastructure is inadequate or does not exist.

==Common traits==
A bush plane is defined by how it is used, and many different aircraft with different configurations have been so used over the years. However, experience has shown certain traits to be desirable (though not mandatory), especially on aircraft specifically designed as bush planes.
* Undercarriage designed to be fitted with floats, skis or wheel/skis to permit operation from water or snow—primarily for Canadian, Alaskan and Russian use.
* High wings ease loading and unloading, particularly from docks; improve downward visibility during flight; and increase clearance to reduce the potential for damage during landing, take-off, loading, and unloading.
* Conventional or &quot;tail dragger&quot; landing gear—two large main wheels and a small rear wheel—reduces both weight and drag, increasing the aircraft&#x27;s speed and useful load. It reduces stress on the airframe compared to a nosewheel. A failure is also less critical, as a broken tailwheel is easily repaired and does not prevent the aircraft from flying, unlike a broken nose wheel.
* Short runway performance and low-speed flight characteristics are typically improved by high aspect ratio wings and high-lift devices such as flaps, slots and slats.
* Very large, low-pressure tundra tires may be fitted to enable the pilot to operate from broken ground. It is not uncommon for a bush pilot to land and take off from unprepared surfaces.
* Piston engines are preferred over turboprops, as they are cheaper to build and maintain and easier to start without the aid of ground facilities. In extremely remote areas where avgas can be difficult to acquire, some bush pilots prefer turboprop engines that can burn kerosene-derived jet fuel.

<text>Velbert (, Low Rhenish: &quot;Vèlbed&quot;) is a town in the district of Mettmann, in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia. The town is renowned worldwide for the production of locks and fittings.

==Geography==
Velbert is located on the hills of &#x27;Niederberg&#x27; (meaning &quot;Lower Mountain&quot;), part of the Berg region, approx. 20 kilometres north-east of the capital of North Rhine Westphalia, Düsseldorf, and 12 kilometers north-west of Wuppertal on the south side of the Ruhr river.

Velbert stands on the highest part of the Niederberg region and also in its centre. Its average elevation is around 230 metres above sea level; its highest point, at 303 metres, is the &quot;Hordt-Berg&quot;, and its lowest, at around 70.6 metres, is in Nierenhof am Deilbach. The highest point in Velbert itself is 263 metres above sea level, at the corner of Friedrichstraße and Langenberger Straße.

==Incorporation==
As part of the reform of local government districts in North Rhine-Westphalia that came into effect on 1 January 1975, the formerly independent cities of Velbert, Neviges and Langenberg were merged to form the present city of Velbert.

==History==

Velbert was first mentioned in AD 875 as Feldbrahti and was ruled by the abbey at Werden.

==Administration==
Velbert is divided into three administrative areas, reflecting the three former cities: Velbert-Mitte (&quot;Central Velbert&quot;), Neviges and Langenberg. There are also numerous suburbs, including Tönisheide, Losenburg, Nordpark, Langenhorst, Birth, Röttgen and Hefel.

==Politics==
The current mayor of Velbert has been Dirk Lukrafka of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) since 2014. The most recent mayoral election was held on 13 September 2020, with a runoff held on 27 September, and the results were as follows:

==Coat of arms==
The first coat of arms was created in 1882 and abolished in local government reform of 1975. It showed the lion of the Counts, later Dukes, of Berg (originally the symbol of Limburg) and keys referring to locksmithing, a traditional industry in Velbert.

After 1975 a new coat of arms was created that included heraldic symbols for all three formerly independent towns. The key, referring to Velbert&#x27;s main traditional industry, was retained with a simpler design. Langenberg is represented by an oak leaf, referring to the oak in the old arms of Langenberg. The chevrons in the bit of the key refer to the coat of arms of the lords of Hardenberg, from the coat of arms of Neviges.

==Economics==
The main traditional industry of Velbert is small scale manufacturing, mostly metal based, typical products include locks, hinges, small tools, hoseclamps. Most companies are small to medium scale and many evolved from backyard forges. There are also companies producing parts for the automotive industry, for example the suppliers of vehicle access systems Witte Automotive and Huf. As well as this Stein &amp; Co Gmbh, the makers of Sebo vacuum cleaners, are based in the city.

==Transportation==

The autobahns serving Velbert are the Aachen-Kassel A 44 and the Velbert-Sonnborner Kreuz A 535.

Velbert&#x27;s S-Bahn service runs every 30 minutes line S9, from Recklinghausen / Haltern am See–- Gladbeck to Bottrop– Essen-Nierenhof - Langenberg-Neviges - Rosenhügel-Wuppertal - Hagen, which is an attractive line to commuters though substantially to the east of the old town of Velbert, which has no railway connection left. The operational stations serving the city are Langenberg, Neviges, Nierenhof and Rosenhügel.

In 2011 most of the former railway line within the city was converted to a cyclepath. The former station buildings at Velbert-West and Velbert-Central are now restaurants, and the station at Velbert-Tönisheide is disused. All three were on the discontinued Niederberg Railway (Wülfrath-Velbert-Heiligenhaus–Kettwig).

Velbert also used to have a tram service, and was the meeting point of tramlines from Heidhausen, Neviges, Wülfrath and Hösel with Heiligenhaus. Nowadays a number of bus routes connect Velbert to the surrounding cities. The city belongs to the &quot;Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Ruhr&quot;.

<doc id="1025382" wikidata="Q2642317" url="?curid=1025382" title="José Sánchez del Río">
<text>José Luis Sánchez del Río (March 28, 1913 – February 10, 1928) was a Mexican Cristero who was put to death by government officials because he refused to renounce his Catholic faith. His death was seen as a largely political venture on the part of government officials in their attempt to stamp out dissent and crush religious freedom in the area. He was dubbed &quot;Joselito.&quot;
He was declared to be venerable on June 22, 2004, by Pope John Paul II and was beatified by Pope Benedict XVI – through the Cardinal-Prefect of the Congregation of the Causes of Saints – on November 20, 2005, in Mexico. Pope Francis approved a miracle attributed to him on January 21, 2016, allowing for his canonization to take place; a date was determined at a consistory on March 15, 2016, and he was canonized a saint on October 16, 2016.

==Background==
The Cristero War began when the government began eliminating church privileges and seizing church properties throughout the country, in accordance with anti-clerical laws written into the Mexican Constitution. President Plutarco Elías Calles, who took office in 1924, focused on the Roman Catholic Church, which led to seizure of church property, the closing of religious schools and convents, and the exile or the execution of priests.

==Life and Cristero War==
José Luis Sánchez del Río was born on March 28, 1913, in Sahuayo, Michoacán. He attended school first in his hometown, then in Guadalajara in Jalisco.

When the Cristero War broke out in 1926, his brothers joined the rebel forces, but his mother would not allow him to take part. The rebel general, Prudencio Mendoza Alcazar, also refused his enlistment. The boy insisted that he wanted the chance to give his life for Jesus Christ and so come to Heaven easily. Mendoza relented and allowed José to become the flagbearer of the troop. The Cristeros nicknamed him Tarcisius, after the early Christian saint who was martyred for protecting the Eucharist from desecration.

During heavy fighting on January 25, 1928, a soldier named Mendoza had his horse killed and José gave his horse to the man so that he could flee. Then he sought cover and fired at the enemy until he ran out of ammunition. The government troops captured the boy and imprisoned him.

===Torture and death===
It was later reported that José was captured by government forces, who ordered him to renounce his faith in Christ, under threat of death. He refused to accept apostasy.

To break his resolve, he was made to watch the hanging of another Cristero that they had in custody, but instead José encouraged the man, saying that they would soon meet again in Heaven after death. In prison, José prayed the Rosary daily and wrote an emotional letter to his mother, saying that he was ready to fulfill the will of God to whom he dedicated himself. His father attempted to raise a ransom to save him, but was not able to appease the government in time to do so, thus failing to secure the release of his son.

Others recalled the gruesome events that transpired after the government&#x27;s failure to break José&#x27;s resolve on the evening of February 10, 1928: &quot;Consequently they cut the bottom of his feet and obliged him to walk around the town toward the cemetery. They also at times cut him with a machete until he was bleeding from several wounds. He cried and moaned with pain, but he did not give in. At times they stopped him and said, &#x27;If you shout, &quot;Death to Christ the King&quot; we will spare your life&#x27;. José would only shout, &#x27;I will never give in. Viva Cristo Rey!&#x27;&quot;

===Burial and relics===
The remains of José Luis Sánchez del Río are enshrined above a side altar in the Church of Saint James the Apostle in Sahuayo, his hometown.

==Sainthood==
The sainthood proceedings opened in Zamora on May 1, 1996 in a diocesan process that continued until October 25, 1996. A week prior to the conclusion of that phase the Congregation for the Causes of Saints declared &quot;nihil obstat&quot; (nothing against) to the cause on October 21, 1996; this granted him the title Servant of God, the first stage in the sainthood process. The process was later ratified on November 29, 2002, and allowed for officials to draft and submit in 2003 the Positio on his martyrdom.

Pope John Paul II approved the findings on June 22, 2004, thus allowing his beatification. He was beatified by Pope Benedict XVI on November 20, 2005, in Mexico; the Cardinal-Prefect of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints presided on behalf of the pontiff.

The miracle needed for his canonization attributed to José Luis Sánchez del Río the inexplicable recovery of a baby in Mexico who doctors said had &quot;no hope of survival&quot;, 2008–2009. It was investigated on a local level in Mexico and concluded its work on January 30, 2015. A medical board approved it in 2015 while theologians did so as well on October 8, 2015; the C.C.S. granted final approval on January 12, 2016, before submitting it to the pope for his approval.

Pope Francis approved the miracle as being directly attributed to his intercession on January 21, 2016, and the pope confirmed at an ordinary consistory of cardinals on March 15, 2016, the date of which he would be elevated to sainthood. He was canonized as a saint of the Roman Catholic Church on October 16, 2016.

==Legacy==
The &quot;Blessed José Sánchez del Río High School Seminary&quot; was established in 2008 in Mankato, Minnesota by Father Carlos Miguel Buela of the Institute of the Incarnate Word (IVE) (), a Roman Catholic religious institute. The junior (middle) high school and high school is a preparatory seminary quartered on the 1854 parish grounds of the Saints Peter and Paul Catholic Church in Mankato, Minnesota. The school&#x27;s teen and young adult students are known collectively as &quot;The Minor Seminarians&quot;.

The newly named &quot;St. José Sánchez del Río Catholic School&quot; is located in San Antonio, Texas. Under the auspice of the Archdiocese of San Antonio, Archbishop Gustavo Garcia-Siller renamed the school prior to the start of the 2019–2020 school year. The school&#x27;s mascot are the &quot;Defenders of the Faith&quot; in line with the charism of San Joselito and uses the rosary, Virgen de Guadalupe, and a palm as symbols of his devotion and faith.
In 2021 the school closed and soon the campus was dedicated as the new St. Jose Sanchez Del Rio Catholic Church parish. The gymnasium has been repurposed as the church where Mass is celebrated every day. The new parish is growing fast with religious education and many ministries available to the approximately 450 families registered as parishioners as of early 2023.

==In popular culture==
José Luis Sánchez del Río is one of the characters portrayed in the film &quot;For Greater Glory&quot; which depicts the story of the Cristero War and also depicts his martyrdom.

<text>The Automatic Digital Network System, known as AUTODIN, is a legacy data communications service in the United States Department of Defense. AUTODIN originally consisted of numerous AUTODIN Switching Centers (ASCs) located in the United States and in countries such as England and Japan.

== Background ==
The design of the system, originally named &quot;ComLogNet&quot;, began in 1958 by a team of Western Union, RCA and IBM. The customer was the U.S. Air Force and the system&#x27;s purpose was to improve the speed and reliability of logistics traffic (spare parts for missiles) between five logistics centers and roughly 350 bases and contractor locations. An implementation contract was awarded in the fall of 1959 to Western Union as prime contractor and system integrator, RCA to build the 5 switching center computers and IBM for the compound terminals which provided for both IBM punched card and Teletype data entry. The first site became operational in 1962. During the implementation the government realized the broader value of the system and transferred it to the Defense Communications Agency (DCA) which renamed it &quot;AUTODIN&quot;. In 1962 the government solicited competitive bids for a 9 center expansion which was won by Philco-Ford.

Deployment started in 1966. On March 22, 1968, Autodin multimedia terminal in Europe became operational at Ramstein Air base in Germany. This system linked more than 300 Air Forces bases, material areas, depots and other authorized agencies into a single communications network. In the ASCs; operational until the late 1980s the Philco-Ford OL9 computers were still in use with periodic technological updates. In the 1988 to 1990 timeframe an initiative by the Department of Defense for &quot;off the shelf&quot; hardware initiated a replacement of the Philco-Ford processors by DEC VAX 11/780 series systems.

In 1982, a follow-on project, AUTODIN II, was terminated in favor of using ARPANET technology for the Defense Data Network (including a military subnet known as MILNET).

AUTODIN Switching Centers have been replaced by various hardware/software combinations. The following are some examples:

* A program called NOVA to operate circuits and route messages. The system is designed to run at 2400 baud, however speeds up to 9600 baud are possible. The system is able to run down to 15 baud if communications systems require it.
* A series of hardware/software systems called DABS (DoDIIS Autodin Bypass System) which allows the transmission of messages over Serial connections at up to 9600 Baud as well as TCP/IP connections that allow the transmission of messages across Ethernet connects at speeds limited only by the network bandwidth.

In 1996, DoD decided to phase out AUTODIN by December 31, 1999. Early in the 21st century, all but one of the AUTODIN Switching Centers had been shut down. The intention is to transition secure messaging traffic to the Defense Message System.

<text>d.a. levy (October 29, 1942 – November 24, 1968), born Darryl Alfred Levey (later changed to Darryl Allen Levy), was an American poet, artist, and alternative publisher active during the 1960s, based in Cleveland, Ohio. He consistently signed his work with lower-case letters.

== Biography ==
Levy was born to Joseph J. and Carolyn Levey on Cleveland&#x27;s near West side. Toward the end of his high school years and later, after a short stint in the Navy, Levy decided to read everything and write everything, and lose himself in the search for infinity. He later found a creative outlet in publishing on a small printing press. During this time he also discovered an important spiritual outlet in Buddhism, though Jewish by birth.

He published his own and others&#x27; works, printed on his hand press, or in mimeographed editions through his Renegade Press and Seven Flowers Press. His intense awareness of the gritty and burgeoning art scene of Cleveland, which included drugs and sex, and his need to express this scene which he felt a way of attaining enlightenment, meant that he was not welcome in the political environment.

===Obscenity trial===
In 1966, he was indicted for distributing obscene poetry to minors. He was arrested again in 1967, and his pressing materials confiscated. In a comment to then &quot;Cleveland Plain Dealer&quot; reporter Gene I. Maeroff, Levy said &quot;It&#x27;s absolutely not obscene,&quot; he said. &quot;And even if it were I wouldn&#x27;t care. You can go anywhere in this city and pick up something published by Grove Press or girlie or nudist magazines. The cops aren&#x27;t bothering them.&quot; 
The case attracted wide attention, and prompted a benefit reading on May 14, 1967, on the Case Institute of Technology campus which featured such figures as Allen Ginsberg, Tuli Kupferberg and the Fugs.

The case dragged on for a year, but in 1968 the prosecutor agreed to drop the obscenity charges against Levy and bookseller James Russell Lowell, proprietor of Cleveland&#x27;s Asphodel bookstore (who had also been charged). Levy&#x27;s lawyer convinced him to plead no contest to the charges of tending to contribute to the delinquency of minors, and Levy agreed to pay a $200 fine and no longer associate with juveniles or give them his poetry.&quot;

===Death===
He died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head on November 24, 1968, at the age of 26. He was cremated, and half his ashes are buried in Whitehaven Memorial Park in Mayfield Heights, Ohio. Some ashes remain in the charge of Cleveland Heights artist George Fitzpatrick, who intends to work them into a calligraphic painting of Levy&#x27;s words.

There is a conjecture in a book by Mike Golden that Levy was murdered by the Cleveland police or local government because of his anti-establishment writings, but this controversy died down shortly after publication, and is only maintained by those far-removed from the poetry community. Those who knew Levy first-hand reject the idea of anything but a suicide. Levy often talked about suicide. Russ Salamon, a friend of Levy and fellow Cleveland poet, gave Levy large stacks of books, replenishing them when necessary, knowing Levy would finish the texts, and therefore remain a little while longer on this earth. For the last three years of his life, Levy was fond of saying he would like to leave the city, the country, and go to &quot;Israel&quot; (is real).

== Published works ==
Levy is most known for &quot;The North American Book of the Dead&quot;, &quot;Cleveland Undercovers&quot;, and &quot;Suburban Monastery Death Poem&quot;, and in the last years of the 20th century his &quot;Tombstone as a Lonely Charm&quot; found a new following.

During 1967 and 1968, Levy published Cleveland&#x27;s first underground newspaper, the &quot;Buddhist Third-Class Junkmail Oracle&quot;.

In 1968 he also helped edit and wrote for the single issue of The Marijuana Review (New York).
His earliest poems were almost all in lowercase, and would appear to some to be lacking in focus. In his mimeographs of his writings (which could be considered an early form of zine), the poetry is sometimes misspelled. This could be style, error or perhaps it boils down to mimeo method, as correcting the stencils was laborious.

Levy also explored concrete poetry. In works such as &quot;The Tibetan Stroboscope&quot; he used the low fidelity copies produced by the mimeograph to create images of distorted and illegible text, combining these with collaged images of Buddhist artworks and cut-up phrases from commercial magazines such as &quot;NIBBANA IS NOT AN Air-conditioned Salesroom.&quot;

As Levy got more involved in both Buddhism and Cleveland, his poems got more playful at times, used spelling &quot;mistakes&quot; and syntax &quot;errors&quot; carrying multiple meanings, and other effects, and did not shy away from long lines of capital letters.

In 2011, 43 years after his death, two of Levy&#x27;s poems were translated to Hebrew and were published in Maayan, Israeli magazine of poetry .

=== An example of levy&#x27;s work ===
Here is a small sample from &quot;The North American Book of the Dead&quot;. Note the nouns placed next to each other with no verbs, and contrasting loaded images with the ordinary, the alignment of the text on the surface, and the use of caps.

<text>Sony Interactive Entertainment LLC (SIE) is an American video game and digital entertainment company that is a major subsidiary of Sony Group Corporation. It primarily operates the PlayStation brand of video game consoles and products. It is also the world&#x27;s largest company in the video game industry based on its equity investments.

In 1993, Sony and Sony Music Entertainment Japan jointly established Sony Computer Entertainment Inc. (SCE) in Tokyo, which released the video game console PlayStation in Japan the following year and subsequently in the United States and Europe the year after. In 2010, Sony underwent a corporate split and established Sony Network Entertainment International (SNEI), which provided gaming-related services through the PlayStation Network and Sony Entertainment Network, including the sale of game titles and content on the PlayStation Store, as well as offering PlayStation Plus. In 2016, SCE and SNEI jointly established Sony Interactive Entertainment and it was announced the new entity would be headquartered in the United States.

==History==

=== Sony Computer Entertainment founding, PlayStation release, and North American expansion (1993–2005) ===

Sony Computer Entertainment, Inc. (SCEI) was jointly established by Sony and its subsidiary Sony Music Entertainment Japan in 1993 to handle the company&#x27;s ventures into the video game industry. The original PlayStation console was released on December 3, 1994, in Japan. The company&#x27;s North American operations, Sony Computer Entertainment of America (SCEA), were originally established in May 1995 as a division of Sony Electronic Publishing. Located in Foster City, California, the North American office was originally headed by Steve Race.

In the months prior to the release of the PlayStation in Western markets, the operations were restructured: All video game marketing from Sony Imagesoft was folded into SCEA in July 1995, with most affected employees transferred from Santa Monica to Foster City. On August 7, 1995, Race unexpectedly resigned and was named CEO of Spectrum HoloByte three days later. He was replaced by Sony Electronics veteran Martin Homlish. This proved to be the beginning of a run of exceptional managerial turnover. The PS console was released in the United States on September 9, 1995. As part of a worldwide restructuring at the beginning of 1997, the American and European divisions of SCE were both re-established as wholly owned subsidiaries of SCEI.

The launch of the second PS console, the PlayStation 2 was released in Japan on March 4, 2000, and the U.S. on October 26, 2000. On July 1, 2002, chairman of SCEI, Shigeo Maruyama, was replaced by Tamotsu Iba as chairman. Jack Tretton and Phil Harrison were also promoted to senior vice presidents of SCE. The PlayStation Portable (PSP) was SCEI&#x27;s first foray into the small handheld console market. Its development was first announced during SCE&#x27;s E3 conference in 2003, and it was officially unveiled during their E3 conference on May 11, 2004. The system was released in Japan on December 12, 2004, in North America on March 24, 2005, and in Europe and Australia on September 1, 2005.

===Creation of SCE Worldwide Studios, acquisitions, and restructure (2005–2011)===
On September 1, 2005, SCEI formed SCE Worldwide Studios, a single internal entity to oversee all wholly-owned development studios within SCEI. It became responsible for the creative and strategic direction of development and production of all computer entertainment software by all SCEI-owned studios—all software is produced exclusively for the PS family of consoles. Shuhei Yoshida was named as president of Worldwide Studios on May 16, 2008, replacing Kazuo Hirai, who was serving interim after Harrison left the company in early 2008.

On December 8, 2005, video game developer Guerrilla Games, developers of the &quot;Killzone&quot; series, was acquired by Sony Computer Entertainment as part of Worldwide Studios. On January 24, 2006, video game developer Zipper Interactive, developers of the &quot;Socom&quot; series, was acquired by Sony Computer Entertainment as part of Worldwide Studios.

In March 2006, Sony announced the online network for its forthcoming PlayStation 3 (PS3) system at the 2006 PlayStation Business Briefing meeting in Tokyo, Japan, tentatively named &quot;PlayStation Network Platform&quot; and eventually called just PlayStation Network (PSN). Sony also stated that the service would always be connected, free, and include multiplayer support.

The launch date for the PS3 was announced by Hirai at the pre-E3 conference held at the Sony Pictures Studios in Culver City, California, on May 8, 2006. The PS3 was released in Japan on November 11, 2006, and the U.S. date was November 17, 2006. The PSN was also launched in November 2006.

On November 30, 2006, president of SCEI, Ken Kutaragi, was appointed as chairman of SCEI, while Hirai, then president of SCEA, was promoted to president of SCEI. On April 26, 2007, Ken Kutaragi resigned from his position as chairman of SCEI and group CEO, passing on his duties to the recently appointed president of SCE, Hirai.

On September 20, 2007, video game developers Evolution Studios and Bigbig Studios, creators of the MotorStorm series, were acquired by Sony Computer Entertainment as part of Worldwide Studios.

On April 15, 2009, David Reeves, president and CEO of SCE Europe, announced his forthcoming resignation from his post. He had joined the company in 1995 and was appointed as chairman of SCEE in 2003, and then president in 2005. His role of president and CEO of SCEE would be taken over by Andrew House, who joined Sony Corporation in 1990. The PSP Go was released on October 1, 2009, for North America and Europe, and on November 1, 2009, for Japan.

On April 1, 2010, SCEI was restructured to bring together Sony&#x27;s mobile electronics and personal computers divisions. The main Japanese division of SCEI was temporarily renamed &quot;SNE Platform Inc.&quot; (SNEP) on April 1, 2010, and was split into two divisions that focused on different aspects: &quot;Sony Computer Entertainment, Inc.&quot;, consisting of 1,300 employees who focused on the console business, and the network service business consisting of 60 to 70 employees. The network service business of SCEI was absorbed into Sony Corp&#x27;s Network Products &amp; Service Group (NPSG), which had already been headed by Hirai since April 2009. The original SCEI was then dissolved after the restructuring.

The North American and European branches of SCEI were affected by the restructuring, and remained as SCEA and SCEE. Hirai, by that time SCEI CEO and Sony Corporation EVP, led both departments.

On March 2, 2010, video game developer Media Molecule, developers of the PlayStation 3 game &quot;LittleBigPlanet&quot;, was acquired by SCEI as part of Worldwide Studios. On August 23, 2010, the headquarters of the company moved from Minami-Aoyama to the Sony City (Sony Corporation&#x27;s headquarters) in Kōnan, Minato, Tokyo. On April 20, 2011, SCEI was the victim of an attack on its PlayStation Network system, which also affected its online division, Sony Online Entertainment. On August 1, 2011, video game developer Sucker Punch Productions, developers of the &quot;Sly Cooper&quot; and &quot;Infamous&quot; series, was also acquired.

===Launch of PlayStation Vita and PlayStation 4, expansion into China (2011–2016)===
In January 2012, BigBig Studios was closed and Cambridge Studio—renamed Guerrilla Cambridge—becoming a sister studio of Guerrilla Games. In March 2012, Zipper Interactive, developers of the &quot;SOCOM&quot; series, &quot;MAG&quot; and &quot;Unit 13&quot;, was closed. On June 25, 2012, Hirai retired as chairman of Sony Computer Entertainment; however, he remains on the board of directors.

On July 2, 2012, Sony Computer Entertainment acquired Gaikai, a cloud-based gaming service. In August 2012, Studio Liverpool, developer of the &quot;Wipeout&quot; and &quot;Formula One&quot; series, was closed. In August 2012, Sony Computer Entertainment announced PlayStation Mobile for Vita and PlayStation certified devices, with developers such as THQ, Team17 and Action Button Entertainment signed up.

A press release was published on August 20, 2013, announcing the release date of the PlayStation 4 (PS4) console. On that date, SCEI introduced the CUH-1000A series system, and announced the launch date as November 15, 2013, for North American markets and November 29, 2013, for European, Australasian and Central and South American markets.

Following a January 2014 announcement by the Chinese government that the country&#x27;s 14-year game console ban would be lifted, the PS4 was scheduled to be the first Sony video game console to be officially and legally released in China since the PlayStation 2.

On March 6, 2014, Sony Computer Entertainment of America President and CEO, Tretton, announced he was resigning from his position at the end of the month, citing a mutual agreement between himself and SCEA for the cessation of his contract. Tretton had worked at SCEA since 1995 and was a founding member of the company&#x27;s executive team. He was involved in the launch of all PlayStation platforms in North America, including the original PlayStation, PS2, PSP, PS3, PSN, PS Vita, and PS4. Tretton was replaced by Shawn Layden, who was the vice-president and chief operating officer (COO) of Sony Network Entertainment International, effective April 1, 2014. On April 2, 2015, it was announced that Sony Computer Entertainment had acquired the intellectual property of the cloud gaming service OnLive, and that its services would cease by the end of the month.

The beta version of Sony&#x27;s first-ever cloud-based television service, PlayStation Vue (PSVue), was launched in the U.S. in November 2014. It was only offered on an invite-only basis for PS3 and PS4 users, prior to its official launch in early 2015. Sony signed deals with major networks, including CBS, Discovery, Fox, and Viacom, so that users can view live streaming video, as well as catch up and on-demand content, from more than 75 channels, such as Comedy Central and Nickelodeon. Although pricing and release dates for other regions was not publicized, Sony confirmed that PSVue will eventually be available on iPad, followed by other Sony and non-Sony devices.

===Restructuring as Sony Interactive Entertainment (2016–present)===
On January 26, 2016, Sony announced the reorganization and integration of Sony Computer Entertainment and Sony Entertainment Network International, establishing a new company called Sony Interactive Entertainment LLC (SIE) on April 1, 2016, under the umbrella of Sony Corporation of America. Unlike the former SCE, SIE is headquartered in San Mateo, California, and oversees the entire PlayStation brand, regional subsidiaries, and content business. SIE&#x27;s Japanese branch, Sony Interactive Entertainment Inc, was established as a direct subsidiary of Sony Corporation. On March 24, 2016, Sony announced the establishment of ForwardWorks, a new studio dedicated to producing &quot;full-fledged&quot; games based on Sony intellectual properties for mobile platforms such as smartphones; it would later develop &quot;Disgaea RPG&quot; and is currently supporting &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Golf&quot; on Android and iOS. ForwardWorks was later moved to another division within Sony becoming a subsidiary to Sony Music and therefore no longer a unit within Sony Interactive Entertainment.

It was reported in December 2016 by multiple news outlets that Sony was considering restructuring its U.S. operations by merging its TV and film business with SIE. According to the reports, such a restructuring would have placed Sony Pictures under Sony Interactive&#x27;s CEO, Andrew House, though House would not have taken over day-to-day operations of the film studio. According to one report, Sony was set to make a final decision on the possibility of the merger of the TV, film, and gaming businesses by the end of its fiscal year in March of the following year (2017). However, judging by Sony&#x27;s activity in 2017, the rumored merger never materialized.

On January 8, 2019, Sony announced that the company had entered into a definitive agreement for Sony Interactive Entertainment to acquire Audiokinetic.

On March 20, 2019, Sony Interactive Entertainment launched the educational video game platform toio in Japan.

The studio will be Sony Interactive Entertainment&#x27;s first studio in Southeast Asia.
SIE announced the formation of PlayStation Studios in May 2020 to be formally introduced alongside the PlayStation 5 later in 2020. PlayStation Studios will serve as an umbrella organization for its first-party game development studios, including Naughty Dog, Insomniac, Santa Monica Studio, Media Molecule and Guerrilla Games, as well as used for branding on games developed by studios brought in by Sony in work-for-hire situations. Sony plans to use the &quot;PlayStation Studios&quot; branding on both PlayStation 5 and new PlayStation 4 games to help with consumer recognition, though the branding was not ready for some of Sony&#x27;s mid-2020 releases like &quot;The Last of Us Part II&quot;.

SIE&#x27;s parent Sony bought a minority stake in Epic Games for $250 million in July 2020, giving the company about a 1.4% stake in Epic. The investment came after Sony helped with Epic&#x27;s development of new technologies in its Unreal Engine 5, which it was positioning for use in powering games on the upcoming PlayStation 5 to take advantage of its high speed internal storage solutions for in-game streaming.

In March 2021, SIE announced that it and RTS acquired the assets and properties of the Evolution Championship Series as a joint venture.

The suit has potential for damages up to ().

The management changes are scheduled to go into effect April 1, 2025

==Corporate affairs==
Hiroki Totoki serves as chairman of SIE, with Hideaki Nishino and Hermen Hulst leading the Platform and Studio Business Groups respectively. The first and longest-serving CEO of SIE is Ken Kutaragi, who served from 1993 to 2007. He is also known as the &quot;Father of the PlayStation&quot;, and was honorary chairman of SIE for another four years after he resigned as CEO. Kutaragi has remained at Sony as a senior technology advisor. As of November 7, 2019, Hermen Hulst is the Head of Worldwide Studios.

===Headquarters===
SIE currently has eight main headquarters around the world. They are as follows:
*Sony Interactive Entertainment LLC and Sony Interactive Entertainment America LLC (San Mateo, California) — the global and regional headquarters for North America and Latin America (except Cuba and the Caribbean countries)
*Sony Interactive Entertainment Europe Limited (London, England, United Kingdom) — controls operations in Europe, South Africa, Middle East, India, New Zealand and Turkey (except Russia, Egypt, Belarus and Baltic countries)
*Sony Interactive Entertainment Inc. and Sony Interactive Entertainment Japan Asia (Minato, Tokyo, Japan) — controls operations in Japan and was also formerly the regional headquarters for Sony Computer Entertainment Inc.
*Sony Interactive Entertainment Australia (Sydney, New South Wales, Australia) — controls Australian operations
*Sony Interactive Entertainment Korea (Seoul, South Korea) — controls South Korean operations
*Sony Interactive Entertainment Singapore (Singapore) — controls Southeast Asia operations
*Sony Interactive Entertainment Taiwan (Taipei, Taiwan) — controls Taiwanese operations
*Sony Interactive Entertainment Shanghai (Shanghai, China) — controls operations in mainland China

SIE also has smaller offices and distribution centers in Los Angeles, California, San Diego, California; Toronto, Ontario; Adelaide, South Australia; Melbourne, Victoria; Seoul, South Korea, Singapore; Shanghai, China and Liverpool, England.

===Game approval===
SIE evaluates and approves games for its consoles. The process is stricter than for the Nintendo Seal of Quality, and developers submit game concepts to Sony early in the design process. Each SIE unit has its own evaluation process; SIEE, for example, approved &quot;Billy the Wizard&quot; for its consumers but SIEA did not. The company sometimes imposes additional restrictions, such as when it prohibited PS and PS2 games from being ported to the PSP without 30% of content being new to the Sony console.

==Hardware==

===PlayStation===
SCEI produces the PlayStation line of video game hardware that consists of consoles and handhelds. Sony&#x27;s first wide home console release, the PlayStation (codenamed &quot;PSX&quot; during development), was initially designed to be a CD-ROM drive add-on for Nintendo&#x27;s Super NES (a.k.a. &quot;Super Famicom&quot; in Japan) video game console, in response to add-ons for competing platforms such as the TurboGrafx-CD and the Sega CD (sold as the PC Engine CD-ROM² System and Mega CD in Japan respectively). When the prospect of releasing the system as an add-on dissolved, Sony redesigned the machine into a standalone unit.

The PlayStation was released in Japan on December 3, 1994, and later in North America on September 9, 1995. By the end of the console 12-year production cycle, the PlayStation had sold 102 million units.

===PlayStation 2===
SCEI&#x27;s second home console, the PlayStation 2 (PS2) was released in Japan on March 4, 2000, and later in North America and Europe in October and November 2000, respectively. The PS2 is powered by a proprietary central processing unit, the Emotion Engine, and was the first video game console to have DVD playback functionality and also backwards compatibility with the original PlayStation games included out of the box.

The PS2 consisted of a DVD drive and retailed in the U.S. for US$299. SCEI received heavy criticism after the launch of the PS2 due to the games released as part of the launch, difficulties that it presented for video game designers, and users who struggled to port Sega Dreamcast games to the system. However, despite these complaints, the PlayStation 2 received widespread support from third party developers throughout its lifespan on the market.

On December 28, 2012, Sony confirmed that it would cease production of the PS2 through a gradual process that started in Japan—the continuing popularity of the console in markets like Brazil and India meant that PS2 products would still be shipped, while games for the console were released in March 2013. The PS2 stands as the best-selling home video game console in history, with a total of 155 million consoles sold.

Writing for the ExtremeTech website at the end of 2012, James Plafke described the PS2 as revolutionary and proclaimed that the console &quot;turn[ed] the gaming industry on its head&quot;:

Aside from being the &quot;first&quot; next-gen console, as well as providing many, many people with their first DVD player, the PlayStation 2 launched in something of a Golden Age of the non-PC gaming industry. Gaming tech was becoming extremely sophisticated ... Sony seemingly knew the exact route toward popularity, turning the console with the least powerful hardware of that generation into a juggernaut of success.

===PlayStation Portable===
The PlayStation Portable (PSP) was SCEI&#x27;s first foray into the small handheld console market. Its development was first announced during SCE&#x27;s E3 conference in 2003, and it was officially unveiled during their E3 conference on May 11, 2004. The system was released in Japan on December 12, 2004, in North America on March 24, 2005, and in Europe and Australia on September 1, 2005. The console has since seen two major redesigns, with new features including smaller size, more internal memory, a better quality LCD screen and lighter weight.

===PlayStation 3===
The launch date for the PS3 was announced by Hirai at the pre-E3 conference held at Sony Pictures Studios in Los Angeles, California, on May 8, 2006. The PS3 was released in Japan on November 11, 2006, and the U.S. date was November 17, 2006. Technology journalists observed that Sony had followed what Microsoft did with the Xbox 360, and produced the PS3 in two versions: one with a 20GB hard drive and the other with a 60GB hard drive.

The PS3 utilizes a unique processing architecture, the Cell microprocessor, a proprietary technology developed by Sony in conjunction with Toshiba and IBM. The graphics processing unit, the RSX &#x27;Reality Synthesizer&#x27;, was co-developed by Nvidia and Sony. Several variations of the PS3 have been released, each with slight hardware and software differences, and each denoted by the varying size of the included hard disk drive.

===PlayStation Vita===
The PS Vita is the successor to the PlayStation Portable. It was released in Japan and other parts of Asia on December 17, 2011, and then in Europe, Australia and North America on February 22, 2012.

Internally, the Vita features a 4-core ARM Cortex-A9 MPCore processor and a 4-core SGX543MP4+ graphics processing unit, as well as LiveArea software as its main user interface, which succeeds the XrossMediaBar.

On March 1, 2019, Sony has ended production of the system and physical cartridge games.

===PlayStation 4===
The PS4 was announced as the successor to the PS3 and was launched in North America on November 15, 2013, in Europe on November 29, 2013 and in Japan on February 23, 2014.

Described by Sony as a &quot;next generation&quot; console, the PS4 included features such as enhanced social capabilities, second-screen options involving devices like the handheld PlayStation Vita, a membership service and compatibility with the Twitch live streaming platform.

Following a January 2014 announcement by the Chinese government that the country&#x27;s 14-year game console ban would be lifted, the PS4 was scheduled to be the first Sony video game console to be officially and legally released in China since the PlayStation 2—the ban was enacted in 2000 to protect the mental health of young people. Around 70 game developers, including Ubisoft and Koei, will service Chinese PlayStation users.

The Chinese release dates and price details were announced in early December, with January 11, 2015, confirmed by SCEI. The makers announced that both the PS4 and Vita consoles will be released in China, and the former&#x27;s package will also consist of a 500GB and 1TB hard drive and controller.

The 20th anniversary of the original PS console was celebrated on December 6, 2014, with the release of a limited-edition, anniversary-edition PlayStation 4 with an aesthetic design that recalled the original 1994 PlayStation.

===PlayStation 5===
The PS5 was announced to succeed the PS4 in 2019, and released in Australia, Japan, New Zealand, North America, and South Korea on November 12, 2020, with a further worldwide release on November 19, 2020.

==Software and franchises==
===Development studios===
SIE has maintained several in-house studios since 2005, with the most recent move to brand these as PlayStation Studios starting in 2020. All of these studios develop PlayStation console-exclusive games for Sony.

The table below shows the current and former studios associated with SIE, and their respective franchises or games of note. In addition to those listed below, Bungie has operated as an independent studio and publisher under SIE since July 2022.

===Other platforms===
SIE began releasing some of its first-party studios&#x27; exclusive titles for Windows in 2020, starting with &quot;&quot; in August 2020, and with &quot;Days Gone&quot; in May 2021. Layden said in a 2021 interview that he was part of the team that came up with this concept, where they recognized &quot;we need to go out to where these new customers are, where these new fans could be. We need to go to where they are... Because they&#x27;ve decided not to come to my house, so I&#x27;ve got to go their house now. And what&#x27;s the best way to go to their house? Why not take one of our top-selling games?&quot; Ryan said in an interview that with some of the latter PlayStation 4 titles that &quot;There&#x27;s an opportunity to expose those great games to a wider audience&quot; and that &quot;Horizon: Zero Dawn&quot; release on Windows shows there was a strong interest in further releases. An investor report in 2021 stated that a primary factor in SIE&#x27;s recent desire to expand into PC gaming under Ryan stems from the motivation to expand the PlayStation brand into China, Russia and India—markets where console-oriented gaming is far less prevalent than in the West and Japan. In June 2021 after acquiring the studio Nixxes which had become their go-to developer for these ports, Sony confirmed that they are dedicated to PC gaming and value PC gamers, although the PlayStation consoles will still be the &quot;first&quot; and &quot;best&quot; places to play their games. Subsequent Windows releases included 2018&#x27;s &quot;God of War&quot; in January 2022, &quot;Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man Remastered&quot; in August 2022, the &quot;&quot; collection and &quot;&quot; in October 2022, &quot;Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales&quot; in November 2022, &quot;Returnal&quot; in February 2023, &quot;The Last of Us Part I&quot; in March 2023, and &quot;Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart&quot; in July 2023.

&quot;Video Games Chronicle&quot; observed that Sony had established a label, PlayStation PC around April 2021 to handle the publication of its games on Windows. The label was quietly renamed PlayStation Publishing in June 2024. The label will also release Sony&#x27;s first published video game for the Nintendo Switch, &quot;Lego Horizon Adventures&quot; (excluding the &quot;&quot; series which was published by MLB Advanced Media on rival platforms). SIE stated in a May 2022 investor report that sales of PC ports of their games had grown from in their 2020 fiscal year, to in 2021, and estimated to be for 2022. Because of this, SIE plans to continue to support PC releases of their PlayStation exclusive games and anticipate that by 2025, a third of their games revenue will come from PC sales.

SIE also began seeking the mobile games market, forming a division named ForwardWorks to develop mobile games for Japan in 2016. To expand this ambition to the West, they hired a former content manager for Apple Arcade in 2020, as a means to bring their IPs to this platform. SIE acquired Savage Game Studios as their first dedicated mobile developer within PlayStation Studios in August 2022 for an undisclosed sum. It expects that by 2025, mobile games will make up 20% of their games revenue.

<doc id="1025409" wikidata="Q5549192" url="?curid=1025409" title="Gerald Gould">
<text>Gerald Gould (1885 – 2 November 1936) was an English writer, known as a journalist and reviewer, essayist and poet.

==Life==

He was born in Scarborough, Yorkshire, and brought up in Norwich, and studied at University College London and Magdalen College, Oxford. He had a position at University College from 1906, and was a Fellow of Merton College, Oxford, from 1909 to 1916.

Gould had assisted the production of the edition of &quot;The Suffragette&quot; when the offices of the WSPU had been raided to review at the printers, whilst Grace Roe was going to Paris to speak to the Pankhursts.

On 6 February 1914 he and his wife Barbara Ayrton-Gould became two of the founders of the United Suffragists, which had male and female members, including Agnes Harben and her husband, and welcomed former militant and non-militants. The United Suffragists ended their campaign when the Representation of the People Act 1918 gave women limited suffrage in the United Kingdom.

From 1914 he was an official in C. F. G. Masterman&#x27;s Wellington House War Propaganda Bureau, which may explain his failure to produce much poetry concerned with the War. He also worked as a journalist on the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; as one of &quot;Lansbury&#x27;s Lambs&quot; — the group of idealistic young men helping with it after George Lansbury purchased it in 1913, and which included G. D. H. Cole, W. N. Ewer, Harold Laski, William Mellor and Francis Meynell.

It was probably Gould who brought Siegfried Sassoon to the paper as literary editor after its relaunch in 1919. Gould regularly contributed poetry to the &quot;Herald&quot; and gave several sonnets to Millicent Fawcett&#x27;s &quot;Common Cause&quot; when it became the &quot;Woman&#x27;s Leader&quot; in 1920.

Gould also reviewed novels for the &quot;New Statesman&quot;, moving to &quot;The Observer&quot; as fiction editor in 1920. He was also (not coincidentally) made chief reader for Victor Gollancz Ltd, where he was involved in the early publication history of George Orwell. He died in 1936 in London.

==Family==
Gould married Barbara Bodichon Ayrton (1888–1950), suffragist and after his death on the Labour National Executive and a Labour Party MP 1945–1950; she was daughter of the scientists William Edward Ayrton and Hertha Marks Ayrton. The artist Michael Ayrton (1921–1975) was their son.

==Works==

<text>An employment contract or contract of employment is a kind of contract used in labour law to attribute rights and responsibilities between parties to a bargain.
The contract is between an &quot;employee&quot; and an &quot;employer&quot;. It has arisen out of the old master-servant law, used before the 20th century. Employment contracts relies on the concept of authority, in which the employee agrees to accept the authority of the employer and in exchange, the employer agrees to pay the employee a stated wage (Simon, 1951).

==Terminology==

A contract of employment is usually defined to mean the same as a &quot;contract of service&quot;. A contract of service has historically been distinguished from a contract for services (contract for the supply of services). The differing terminology implies a dividing line between a person who is &quot;employed&quot; and someone who is &quot;self-employed&quot;. The purpose of the dividing line is to attribute rights to some kinds of people who work for others. This could be the right to a minimum wage, holiday pay, sick leave, fair dismissal, a written statement of the contract, the right to organise in a union, and so on. The assumption is that genuinely self-employed people should be able to look after their own affairs, and therefore work they do for others should not carry with it an obligation to look after these rights.

Following the unification of the city-states in Assyria and Sumer by Sargon of Akkad into a single empire ruled from his home city circa 2334 BC, common Mesopotamian standards for length, area, volume, weight, and time used by artisan guilds in each city was promulgated by Naram-Sin of Akkad (c. 2254–2218 BC), Sargon&#x27;s grandson, including those of shekels. &quot;Codex Hammurabi&quot; Law 234 (c. 1755–1750 BC) stipulated a 2-shekel prevailing wage for each 60-gur (300-bushel) vessel constructed in an employment contract between a shipbuilder and a ship-owner. Law 275 stipulated a ferry rate of 3-gerah per day on a charterparty between a ship charterer and a ship-owner. Law 276 stipulated a 2-gerah per day freight rate on a charterparty, while Law 277 stipulated a -shekel per day freight rate for a 60-gur vessel.

In Roman law the equivalent dichotomy was that between &quot;locatio conductio operarum&quot; (employment contract) and &quot;locatio conductio operis&quot; (contract for services).

The terminology is complicated by the use of many other sorts of contracts involving one person doing work for another. Instead of being considered an &quot;employee&quot;, the individual could be considered a &quot;worker&quot; (which could mean less employment legislation protection) or as having an &quot;employment relationship&quot; (which could mean protection somewhere in between) or a &quot;professional&quot; or a &quot;dependent entrepreneur&quot;, and so on. Different countries will take more or less sophisticated, or complicated approaches to the question.

== Employee vs. Independent Contractor ==
An independent contractor is in business for him or herself providing services to other businesses and does not work for or under an outside authority. Independent contractors are contracted on a temporary basis and paid at the completion of a project upon which their contract will be terminated. An employee works for an organization and is covered by federal and state employment and labor laws, which entitles them to certain benefits such as social security, income tax withholdings, and workers compensation, among others per the United States government (U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services, 2018).

== Types of Employment ==
Employment contracts define the type of employment, which fall into two categories: at-will employment and for-cause employment.

=== &quot;For-Cause Employment&quot; ===
For-cause employees can only have their employment terminated for a just reason. The employer&#x27;s decision to terminate an employee also must be reviewed by an independent body to ensure the termination was indeed just and provide protection for employees from unfair or arbitrary termination (Pitchford, 2005). The three largest classes of just-cause employees are federal and state employees, as well as union members.

=== &quot;At-Will Employment&quot; ===
On the other hand, at-will employment does not require an employer to give any cause for termination. At-will employment is unique to the United States, as most countries require specific procedures for employment termination. At-will employment was considered common law in the United States prior to the nineteenth century as opposed to the standard employment law in England, which was the annual hiring rule or seasonal hiring. In 1877, Horace Wood wrote his treatise on employment titled &quot;Master and Servant&quot;, which is considered by some to be the origin of at-will employment in the US. However, critics of Wood indicate that he incorrectly cited the cases to support his claim that employers can discharge workers for any reason. Shortly after, courts across the country upheld his claim (Pitchford, 2005).

There are several theories as to why at-will employment became a legal standard in the US. According to Jay Feinman in &quot;The Development of the Employment at Will Rule&quot;, as a result of the Industrial Revolution and increasing economic pressures, courts adopted the rule because it favored employers who were trying to avoid mounting employment lawsuits. Employers did not want employees to have a voice because if they knew they could be dismissed at any point, they would be less likely to protest working conditions, wages, etc. At-will employment doctrine also maximized employers’ ability to decrease their workforce in times of economic contraction (Ballam, 1996).

A second theory, proposed by Sanford Jacoby, argues that trade unions were much weaker in the US than in England during this period, so the courts did not offer as much protection for the annual hiring rule. Additionally, white collar workers in England during the nineteenth century garnered much more protection from the English courts due to their higher status compared to white collar workers in the United States (Ballam, 1996).

More recently, Deborah Ballam argues in Exploding the Original Myth Regarding Employment-At-Will: The True Origins of the Doctrine that the employment-at-will rule was the norm throughout the history of the United States because the agriculturally based economy and labor market were not conducive to the English annual hiring rule. “Because of the extensive use of indentured servitude, slavery, and express contracts for specified terms, and because of the severe labor shortage, few laborers would have been in situations where the annual hiring rule could have applied,” (Ballam, 1996).

== Types of Employment Contracts ==
The two most common types of employment contracts include fixed-term and open-ended contracts.

=== &quot;Fixed-Term Contract&quot; ===
Fixed-term contracts are used when an employer wishes to hire an employee for a specific amount of time that is agreed upon in advance . Also known as task contracts, a fixed-term contract can also be used for the completion of a specific task and the contract will be terminated automatically upon completion of the task. Either party may terminate the contract before the end of the specified term if appropriate notice is given by either side (University of Strathclyde, 2013).

=== &quot;Open-Ended Contract&quot; ===
Conversely, an open-ended employment contract does not have a specified end date. Open-ended employment contracts are also called permanent, indefinite, or continuing contracts as they are typically used for long-term employment situations (University of Strathclyde, 2013). This type of employment contract may be terminated if either party gives appropriate notice to the other party or in specific instances such as health concerns, resignation, or misconduct.

==Structure==
An employment contract should clearly define all terms and conditions of the employment relationship. The most common elements to any employment contract include the following:

* Terms of employment
* Employee responsibilities
* Employee compensation (i.e. wage/salary, benefits)
* Employment absence
* Dispute resolution
* Nondisclosure agreements
* Ownership agreements
* Assignment clauses
* Employment opportunity limitations
* Grounds for termination

== Common Clauses ==

=== &quot;Scope of employment&quot; ===
Each employment contract contains a job description including the range of activities that an employee is reasonably expected to perform. Scope of employment often identifies demotion, transfer to different responsibilities, and modification or increasing current responsibilities. Travel and relocation can also be discussed in this section.

=== &quot;Compensation and benefits&quot; ===
Compensation includes a negotiated base salary or earning potential for an employee, performance incentives, production bonuses, signing bonuses, equity, and stock options. Benefits include insurance (health, life, vision and dental), pension plans, paid time off, vacation time, sick and personal leave. This section will also include if or when an employee&#x27;s salary can be reduced for instances such as suspension or company financial distress.

=== &quot;Probationary period&quot; ===
Some companies begin employment with new employees on a probationary basis. An employee is hired for a trial period that gives the company an opportunity to evaluate an employee&#x27;s job performance and conduct. The duration of the trial period, training guidelines and assessment standards should be outlined in this section. If an employee&#x27;s performance is found to be unsatisfactory, the employer can terminate the employee at the end or before the completion of the probationary period. This section should also detail how the employer will inform the employee if they wish to continue the employment at the end of the probationary period. A probationary period can only be extended if agreed by both parties or if the employment contract allow it.

=== &quot;Non-competition&quot; ===
A non-competition clause prevents an employee from taking a position with a competitor of their employer following the termination of employment. The employer must have a legitimate interest in restricting the employee from future employment and the clause must be reasonable in time, activities, and geographic area.

=== &quot;Non-solicitation&quot; ===
A non-solicitation clause prevents an employee from soliciting the employer&#x27;s clients, customers, or employees for his or her own benefit. The employee also cannot solicit the employer&#x27;s clients, customers, or employees for a period of time after the termination of the agreement. This section protects the employer&#x27;s information and tries to ensure company loyalty.

=== &quot;Non-disclosure&quot; ===
Under a non-disclosure or confidentiality clause, the employee agrees to not disclose information that the employer deems confidential or sensitive to the business and to take reasonable steps to prevent disclosure. Non-disclosures are commonly used to protect trade secrets, client information and other valuable information. A non-disclosure agreement can continue indefinitely or can include a duration clause that stipulates an end date of the agreement.

=== &quot;Moonlighting &amp; best efforts&quot; ===
A moonlighting clause details the employer&#x27;s expectation that an employee with treat their employment with the business as their primary job and that other jobs will not interfere with their job performance. In some cases, a moonlighting clause will go as far as to specify that an employee cannot hold any other form of employment other than with their employer. The employer can also require an employee to report any outside work.

=== &quot;Intellectual property&quot; ===
An employer can assign all work products and intellectual property created by an employee during their term of employment is an exclusive right of the employer. This clause pertains to inventions that relate to the company&#x27;s past, present or reasonably foreseeable future business or research endeavors. Employers can claim the rights to inventions that were created using company resources, including confidential information, regardless of if they were developed during normal work hours.

=== &quot;Arbitration&quot;  ===
This clause specifies that the employer and employee will resolve disputes outside of court and with an arbitrator. In arbitration, the disputing parties each present their side of an issue to an arbitrator who will act like a judge and decide the matter without a jury. The court will then enforce the arbitrator&#x27;s binding decision on the dispute.

=== &quot;Termination&quot; ===
The term of the contract should be included in this section, detailing a specific time after which the contract will be terminated or no longer be enforceable. Renewals can be included as automatic with options not to renew or can be elective by both parties mutually.

== Legal Implications ==
With at-will employment, employers must be wary of legal issues that could potentially arise from wrongful termination.

=== &quot;Civil Rights Act of 1964&quot; ===
Employees in the United States are protected under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex or national origin (Prenkert et al., 2019). Title VII covers all employers with 15 or more employees and who are engaging in an industry affecting interstate commerce. Employers include individuals, partnerships, colleges and universities, labor unions and employment agencies, as well as state and local governments. Title VII prohibits two theories of employment discrimination: disparate treatment and disparate impact. Disparate treatment occurs when an employer treats an employee differently because of the employee&#x27;s protected status. Disparate impact occurs when an employer&#x27;s policies or practices are seemingly neutral regarding protected statuses and have a disproportionate negative impact on members of one of those groups (Prenkert et al., 2019).

=== &quot;Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990&quot; ===
Wrongful termination lawsuits can also arise from violating the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, which protects both individuals who can perform the essential functions of their job despite their disability and those who need a reasonable accommodation to perform their duties (Prenkert et al., 2019). Reasonable accommodation includes making existing facilities readily accessible and usable, acquiring new equipment, restricting job, modifying work schedules, and reassigning workers to vacant positions. However, employers do not need to make accommodations that would create undue hardships. An act requiring significant difficulty or expense (Prenkert et al., 2019).

=== &quot;Fair Labor Standards Act&quot; ===
The Fair Labor Standards Act also affects employers and employment contracts in that it establishes minimum wage, overtime pay, recordkeeping, and youth employment standards affecting employees in the private sector and in Federal, State, and local governments. The FLSA applies only to employers whose annual sales total $500,000 or more or who are engaged in interstate commerce (U.S. Department of Labor, n.d.).

=== &quot;Respondeat Superior&quot; ===
Lawsuits can arise as well from Respondeat Superior Liability or vicarious liability. Respondeat Superior is the legal doctrine that in Latin means “let the master answer.&quot; Respondeat Superior holds an employer legally responsible for the wrongful acts of an employee or agent if such acts occur within the scope of the employment or agency. A court will apply the doctrine regardless of how closely the employer was monitoring the employee. Respondeat Superior applies to employees, but not to independent contractors.

==Criticism==


Anarcho-syndicalists and other socialists who criticise wage slavery, e.g. David Ellerman and Carole Pateman, posit that the employment contract is a legal fiction in that it recognises human beings juridically as mere tools or inputs by abdicating responsibility and self-determination, which the critics argue are inalienable. As Ellerman points out, &quot;[t]he employee is legally transformed from being a co-responsible partner to being only an input supplier sharing no legal responsibility for either the input liabilities [costs] or the produced outputs [revenue, profits] of the employer&#x27;s business.&quot; Such contracts are inherently invalid &quot;since the person remain[s] a de facto fully capacitated adult person with only the contractual role of a non-person&quot; as it is impossible to physically transfer self-determination. As Pateman argues:

According to some law scholars, generally, the contract of employment denotes a relationship of economic dependence and social subordination. In the words of the controversial labour lawyer Sir Otto Kahn-Freund,
&quot;the relation between an employer and an isolated employee or worker is typically a relation between a bearer of power and one who is not a bearer of power. In its inception it is an act of submission, in its operation, it is a condition of subordination, however much the submission and the subordination may be concealed by the indispensable figment of the legal mind known as the &#x27;contract of employment&#x27;. The main object of labor law has been, and... will always be a countervailing force to counteract the inequality of bargaining power which is inherent and must be inherent in the employment relationship.&quot;

<text>Electromagnetic theories of consciousness propose that consciousness can be understood as an electromagnetic phenomenon.

== Overview ==
Theorists differ in how they relate consciousness to electromagnetism. Electromagnetic &quot;field&quot; theories (or &quot;EM field theories&quot;) of consciousness propose that consciousness results when a brain produces an electromagnetic field with specific characteristics. Susan Pockett and Johnjoe McFadden have proposed EM field theories; William Uttal has criticized McFadden&#x27;s and other field theories.

In general, quantum mind theories do not treat consciousness as an electromagnetic phenomenon, with a few exceptions. 

AR Liboff has proposed that &quot;incorporating EM field-mediated communication into models of brain function has the potential to reframe discussions surrounding consciousness&quot;.

Also related are E. Roy John&#x27;s work and Andrew and Alexander Fingelkurts theory &quot;Operational Architectonics framework of brain-mind functioning&quot;.

== Cemi theory ==
The starting point for McFadden and Pockett&#x27;s theory is the fact that every time a neuron fires to generate an action potential, and a postsynaptic potential in the next neuron down the line, it also generates a disturbance in the surrounding electromagnetic field. McFadden has proposed that the brain&#x27;s electromagnetic field creates a representation of the information in the neurons. Studies undertaken towards the end of the 20th century are argued to have shown that conscious experience correlates not with the number of neurons firing, but with the synchrony of that firing. McFadden views the brain&#x27;s electromagnetic field as arising from the induced EM field of neurons. The synchronous firing of neurons is, in this theory, argued to amplify the influence of the brain&#x27;s EM field fluctuations to a much greater extent than would be possible with the unsynchronized firing of neurons.

McFadden thinks that the EM field could influence the brain in a number of ways. Redistribution of ions could modulate neuronal activity, given that voltage-gated ion channels are a key element in the progress of axon spikes. Neuronal firing is argued to be sensitive to the variation of as little as one millivolt across the cell membrane, or the involvement of a single extra ion channel. Transcranial magnetic stimulation is similarly argued to have demonstrated that weak EM fields can influence brain activity.

McFadden proposes that the digital information from neurons is integrated to form a conscious electromagnetic information (cemi) field in the brain. Consciousness is suggested to be the component of this field that is transmitted back to neurons, and communicates its state externally. Thoughts are viewed as electromagnetic representations of neuronal information, and the experience of free will in our choice of actions is argued to be our subjective experience of the cemi field acting on our neurons.

McFadden&#x27;s view of free will is deterministic. Neurons generate patterns in the EM field, which in turn modulate the firing of particular neurons. There is only conscious agency in the sense that the field or its download to neurons is conscious, but the processes of the brain themselves are driven by deterministic electromagnetic interactions. The feel of subjective experience or qualia corresponds to a particular configuration of the cemi field. This field representation is in this theory argued to integrate parts into a whole that has meaning, so a face is not seen as a random collection of features, but as somebody&#x27;s face. The integration of information in the field is also suggested to resolve the binding/combination problem.

In 2013, McFadden published two updates to the theory. In the first, &#x27;The CEMI Field Theory: Closing the Loop&#x27; McFadden cites recent experiments in the laboratories of Christof Koch and David McCormick which demonstrate that external EM fields, that simulate the brain&#x27;s endogenous EM fields, influence neuronal firing patterns within brain slices. The findings are consistent with a prediction of the cemi field theory that the brain&#x27;s endogenous EM field - consciousness - influences brain function. In the second, &#x27;The CEMI Field Theory Gestalt Information and the Meaning of Meaning&#x27;, McFadden claims that the cemi field theory provides a solution to the binding problem of how complex information is unified within ideas to provide meaning: the brain&#x27;s EM field unifies the information encoded in millions of disparate neurons.

Susan Pockett has advanced a theory, which has a similar physical basis to McFadden&#x27;s, with consciousness seen as identical to certain spatiotemporal patterns of the EM field. However, whereas McFadden argues that his deterministic interpretation of the EM field is not out-of-line with mainstream thinking, Pockett suggests that the EM field comprises a universal consciousness that experiences the sensations, perceptions, thoughts and emotions of every conscious being in the universe. However, while McFadden thinks that the field is causal for actions, albeit deterministically, Pockett does not see the field as causal for our actions.

== Quantum brain dynamics ==
The concepts underlying this theory derive from the physicists, Hiroomi Umezawa and Herbert Fröhlich in the 1960s. More recently, their ideas have been elaborated by Mari Jibu and Kunio Yasue. Water comprises 70% of the brain, and quantum brain dynamics (QBD) proposes that the electric dipoles of the water molecules constitute a quantum field, referred to as the cortical field, with corticons as the quanta of the field. This cortical field is postulated to interact with quantum coherent waves generated by the biomolecules in neurons, which are suggested to propagate along the neuronal network. The idea of quantum coherent waves in the neuronal network derives from Fröhlich. He viewed these waves as a means by which order could be maintained in living systems, and argued that the neuronal network could support long-range correlation of dipoles. This theory suggests that the cortical field not only interacts with the neuronal network, but also to a good extent controls it.

The proponents of QBD differ somewhat as to the way in which consciousness arises in this system. Jibu and Yasue suggest that the interaction between the energy quanta (corticons) of the quantum field and the biomolecular waves of the neuronal network produces consciousness. However, another theorist, Giuseppe Vitiello, proposes that the quantum states produce two poles, a subjective representation of the external world and also the internal self.

== Advantages ==
Locating consciousness in the brain&#x27;s EM field, rather than the neurons, has the advantage of neatly accounting for how information located in millions of neurons scattered through the brain can be unified into a single conscious experience (called the binding problem): the information is unified in the EM field. In this way, EM field consciousness can be considered to be &quot;joined-up information&quot;. This theory accounts for several otherwise puzzling facts, such as the finding that attention and awareness tend to be correlated with the synchronous firing of multiple neurons rather than the firing of individual neurons. When neurons fire together, their EM fields generate stronger EM field disturbances; so synchronous neuron firing will tend to have a larger impact on the brain&#x27;s EM field (and thereby consciousness) than the firing of individual neurons. However their generation by synchronous firing is not the only important characteristic of conscious electromagnetic fields—in Pockett&#x27;s original theory, spatial pattern is the defining feature of a conscious (as opposed to a non-conscious) field.

== Objections ==
In a circa-2002 publication of The Journal of Consciousness Studies, the electromagnetic theory of consciousness faced an uphill battle for acceptance among cognitive scientists.

&quot;No serious researcher I know believes in an electromagnetic theory of consciousness&quot;, Bernard Baars wrote in an e-mail. Baars is a neurobiologist and co-editor of &quot;Consciousness and Cognition&quot;, another scientific journal in the field. &quot;It&#x27;s not really worth talking about scientifically&quot;, he was quoted as saying.

McFadden acknowledges that his theory, which he calls the &quot;cemi field theory&quot;, is far from proven but he argues that it is certainly a legitimate line of scientific inquiry. His article underwent peer review before publication.

The field theories of consciousness do not appear to have been as widely discussed as other quantum consciousness theories, such as those of Penrose, Stapp or Bohm. However, David Chalmers argues against quantum consciousness. He instead discusses how quantum mechanics may relate to dualistic consciousness. Chalmers is skeptical that any new physics can resolve the hard problem of consciousness. He argues that quantum theories of consciousness suffer from the same weakness as more conventional theories. Just as he argues that there is no particular reason why particular macroscopic physical features in the brain should give rise to consciousness, he also thinks that there is no particular reason why a particular quantum feature, such as the EM field in the brain, should give rise to consciousness either. Despite the existence of transcranial magnetic stimulation with medical purposes, Y. H. Sohn, A. Kaelin-Lang and M. Hallett have denied it, and later Jeffrey Gray states in his book &quot;Consciousness: Creeping up on the Hard Problem&quot;, that tests looking for the influence of electromagnetic fields on brain function have been universally negative in their result. However, a number of studies have found clear neural effects from EM stimulation.

In April 2022, the results of two related experiments at the University of Alberta and Princeton University were announced at The Science of Consciousness conference, providing further evidence to support quantum processes operating within microtubules. In a study Stuart Hameroff was part of, Jack Tuszyński of the University of Alberta demonstrated that anesthetics hasten the duration of a process called delayed luminescence, in which microtubules and tubulins trapped light. Tuszyński suspects that the phenomenon has a quantum origin, with superradiance being investigated as one possibility. In the second experiment, Gregory D. Scholes and Aarat Kalra of Princeton University used lasers to excite molecules within tubulins, causing a prolonged excitation to diffuse through microtubules further than expected, which did not occur when repeated under anesthesia. However, diffusion results have to be interpreted carefully, since even classical diffusion can be very complex due to the wide range of length scales in the fluid filled extracellular space. Nevertheless, University of Oxford quantum physicist Vlatko Vedral told that this connection with consciousness is a really long shot.

Also in 2022, a group of Italian physicists conducted several experiments that failed to provide evidence in support of a gravity-related quantum collapse model of consciousness, weakening the possibility of a quantum explanation for consciousness.

== Influence on brain function ==
The different EM field theories disagree as to the role of the proposed conscious EM field on brain function. In McFadden&#x27;s cemi field theory, as well as in Drs Fingelkurts&#x27; Brain-Mind Operational Architectonics theory, the brain&#x27;s global EM field modifies the electric charges across neural membranes, and thereby influences the probability that particular neurons will fire, providing a feed-back loop that drives free will. However, in the theories of Susan Pockett and E. Roy John, there is no necessary causal link between the conscious EM field and our consciously willed actions.

References to &quot;Mag Lag&quot; also known as the subtle effect on cognitive processes of MRI machine operators who sometimes have to go into the scanner room to check the patients and deal with issues that occur during the scan could suggest a link between magnetic fields and consciousness. Memory loss and delays in information processing have been reported, in some cases several hours after exposure.

One hypothesis is that magnetic fields in the 0.5-9 Tesla range can affect the ion permeability of neural membranes, in fact this could account for a lot of the issues seen as this would affect many different brain functions.

== Implications for artificial intelligence ==
If true, the theory has major implications for efforts to design consciousness into artificial intelligence machines; current microprocessor technology is designed to transmit information linearly along electrical channels, and more general electromagnetic effects are seen as a nuisance and damped out; if this theory is right, however, this is directly counterproductive to creating an artificially conscious computer, which on some versions of the theory would instead have electromagnetic fields that synchronized its outputs—or in the original version of the theory would have spatially patterned electromagnetic fields.

<text>The Boston Red Sox have been a member of the American League (AL) of Major League Baseball (MLB) since 1901, and have held spring training prior to each season.

The franchise&#x27;s first spring training was held in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 1901, when the team was known as the Boston Americans. Since 1993, the city of Fort Myers, Florida, has hosted Boston&#x27;s spring training, first at City of Palms Park, and since 2012 at JetBlue Park at Fenway South.

==List of Boston Red Sox spring training venues==


==Notable events==
In 1918, Babe Ruth hit a 573-foot home run during spring training in Hot Springs, Arkansas.

Norman Rockwell&#x27;s 1957 painting &quot;The Rookie&quot; is set in the team&#x27;s spring training locker room, which at the time was located at Payne Park in Sarasota, Florida.

In 1987, unhappy about his contract, pitcher Roger Clemens left spring training in Winter Haven, Florida, which prompted general manager Lou Gorman to quip, &quot;The sun will rise, the sun will set, and I&#x27;ll have lunch.&quot;

In 1988, presidential candidate Michael Dukakis took batting practice in Winter Haven.

In March 2020, due to impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on sports, all MLB spring training was halted and the start of the regular season was delayed. Three months later, team president Sam Kennedy advised that the team would complete its preseason training activities at Fenway Park, upon resumption of preparations for the 2020 MLB season. The Red Sox organization made multiple changes to Fenway Park to accommodate &quot;summer camp&quot;, including the use of luxury suites as alternate dressing rooms for players, and adding an additional bullpen area underneath the centerfield bleachers. In 2021, the team returned to JetBlue Park for spring training.

<doc id="1025423" wikidata="Q95158" url="?curid=1025423" title="Adam Strange">
<text>Adam Strange is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. Created by editor Julius Schwartz and designed by Murphy Anderson, he first appeared in &quot;Showcase&quot; #17 (November 1958).

Adam Strange made his live-action debut in the television series &quot;Krypton&quot;, portrayed by Shaun Sipos. Additionally, Michael T. Weiss, Michael Trucco, and Brian Bloom have voiced him in animation.

==Creation==
In 1957, DC Comics editorial director Irwin Donenfeld held a meeting with editors Jack Schiff and Julius Schwartz in his office, asking them each to create a new science fiction hero, one from the present and one from the future. Given first pick Schiff chose to create one from the future, Space Ranger. Schwartz was happy with the pick feeling that readers would more readily identify with a hero from the present. He conceived the idea of an Earth man repeatedly traveling to a planet in the Alpha Centauri star system by using a &quot;Zeta-beam&quot; altered by space radiation. Since Adam Strange was the first Earthman on another planet, he named his character Adam after the Biblical first man. When asked about the inspiration behind the character, Gardner Fox stated &quot;I suppose you could say that John Carter was in my subconscious, you had to think of some interesting way to transfer him to from earth up to the planet Rann before you even got started in on a plot, but it was fun to do.&quot;

==Publication history==

Adam Strange debuted in issues #17–19 of the tryout series &quot;Showcase&quot;, published November 1958-March 1959. The first artwork of the character was a cover for &quot;Showcase&quot; #17 by Murphy Anderson. Schwartz rejected the drawing and commissioned a new one by Gil Kane, though Anderson&#x27;s costume design was retained. Schwartz then assigned the scribing of the stories to Gardner Fox and the penciling to Mike Sekowsky. Schwartz and Fox devised the plots for the stories in Schwartz&#x27;s office and Fox would write the scripts at home. A science major, Schwartz specialized in giving Fox scientific pointers that gave the Adam Strange tales a plausibility that made them stand out from most science fiction comic books of the time.

Sales on the three-issue &quot;Showcase&quot; tryout were enough to justify giving Adam Strange a slot in &quot;Mystery in Space&quot;, which ran in issues #53–100 and 102. Though Schwartz and Fox continued their work on the character, Schwartz gave the penciler assignment to Carmine Infantino instead of Sekowsky. Most issues were inked by Murphy Anderson (although Bernard Sachs, Joe Giella and Sid Greene did a few issues each). After his adventures in Mystery in Space were cancelled, Adam Strange continued to have guest appearances in several DC Comics titles. Perhaps the most notable is an adventure written by Gardner Fox and illustrated by Murphy Anderson for &quot;Hawkman&quot; #18 (1967). In it, Hawkman fails to find his planet, Thanagar, and his search leads him to Rann, where he shares a adventure with Adam Strange. In &quot;Justice League of America&quot;, the Flash mentioned Adam Strange as a possible new member for the Justice League. When a letter to the editor pointed out the group had not met Adam Strange and could not have heard of him, as all his heroics took place on Rann, Schwartz and Fox wrote a story showing how the Justice League came to Rann and how Adam Strange saved them from Kanjar Ro. The story was published in &quot;Mystery in Space&quot; #75 and won the Alley Award for the &quot;Best Book-Length Story&quot; of 1962.

As of #92, Jack Schiff replaced Schwartz as editor of &quot;Mystery in Space&quot; and Lee Elias became the artist for Adam Strange. Following the discontinuation of the Adam Strange stories reprints were presented in &quot;Strange Adventures&quot; #217 through 244 (except for #222, which instead has a new story with Strange, written by Denny O&#x27;Neil, while #226 has a new Strange text story by Fox, with illustrations by Anderson).

Adam Strange had stories written by Dave Wood, Jerry Siegel, and Dennis O&#x27;Neil, art by Lee Elias and inks by John Giunta.

Through the 1970s the character was a regular presence in the DC Universe despite having no series of his own. In September 1980 Adam Strange began as a back-up feature in &quot;Green Lantern&quot; (this lasted from #132 to #147). Later in the 1980s Alan Moore wrote a retcon of Adam Strange&#x27;s reason for his visits to Rann. In this retcon the population of the planet, the majority of whom view the Terran with contempt, is sterile, and Adam Strange is there to be a breeding stud. In a 1990 limited series, &quot;The Man of Two Worlds&quot;, Adam learns of the population&#x27;s opinion of him and Alanna dies giving birth to their daughter Aleea. In 1997, Grant Morrison revived the Justice League of America in the &quot;JLA&quot; series. During this period, Mark Waid featured Adam Strange when he filled in for Morrison. In &quot;JLA&quot; #20 (July 1998), Alanna is revealed to be alive and is briefly reunited with her husband and daughter before Adam returns to Earth.

Adam appeared in stories set in the Silver Age: &quot;Legends of the DC Universe 80-Page Giant&quot; #1 (1998); &quot;Silver Age: Showcase&quot; #1 (2000); &quot;DC Universe: Legacies&quot; #5 (2010); and &quot;DC Retroactive: Justice League - The &#x27;70s&quot; (2011).

In 2013, Jeff Lemire said he intended to introduce a New 52 incarnation of Adam Strange at some point in &quot;Justice League Canada&quot;, a series scheduled to launch in Spring 2014. Lemire&#x27;s series was instead titled &quot;Justice League United&quot;, featuring Adam and Alanna.

The series &quot;Strange Adventures&quot; vol. 5, written by Tom King and illustrated by Mitch Gerads and Evan Shaner was launched in 2020, focusing on the character of Adam Strange.

==Fictional character biography==
Strange is an archeologist suddenly teleported from Peru, Earth, to the planet Rann through a &quot;Zeta-Beam&quot;. Upon his arrival, he is attacked by one of the planet&#x27;s predators and rescued by a dark-haired woman called Alanna. She takes him to her father Sardath, who explains that the Zeta-Beam was transmitted to Earth in the hopes that whatever form of intelligent life lived there would trace it back to Rann, and he also theorizes that in the four years it took the Zeta-Beam to reach Earth, it was exposed to radiation and transformed into a transportation beam. Called on to protect the planet from extraterrestrial threats using Rann&#x27;s technology, Strange grows to care for the planet and its inhabitants, especially Alanna. Eventually, the effects of the beam&#x27;s transportation wear off, returning Strange to Earth at the exact point of departure. However, Sardath gives him a schedule of beam firings, allowing him to periodically return to the planet.

Years later, during an exile in space, Swamp Thing arrives on Rann, where he meets Adam Strange. In this story it is revealed that centuries ago the planet&#x27;s population suffered nuclear wars and left them not only with the loss of a large part of their ecosystem, but also with a genetic problem that made the majority of the population sterile. Alanna is among the last Rannians born before the event and maintains fertility.

Over time, Sardath perfected a beam he would call the &quot;Mega Zeta-Beam&quot; which would allow Adam to permanently transport himself to Rann. In those days, Adam learns that he was transported to Rann on purpose to serve as Alanna&#x27;s husband and repopulate the planet. Eventually, Alanna gives birth to a girl named Aleea, but apparently dies in the process.

Grayven, Darkseid&#x27;s illegitimate son, tries to destroy Ranagar and take the Zeta-Beam. Adam Strange battles him with help from the Darkstars and Green Lantern Kyle Rayner.

Hyathis attempted to overthrow the government of Rann by using her telepathy to turn an alien race called the Zaredians against the Darkstars. The Zaredian attack created a diversion which allowed Hyathis to kidnap Aleea. Her plans were upset by the arrival of Superboy and the Ravers.

Years later, Adam is on Rann raising Aleea and helping to restore the planet, when he learns that Alanna was placed in suspended animation and captured by the En&#x27;Taran Slavemasters. Adam convinces the conquerors that he must kidnap the Justice League to rebuild the planet more quickly, and thus, together with the group, he not only rebuilds Rann but defeats the En&#x27;tarang and frees Alanna. Unfortunately in the process, Adam loses all traces of the Mega Zeta Ray in his body and returns to Earth. Strange returned to Rann and reunited with his family shortly after.

===&quot;Planet Heist&quot;===
&quot;Planet Heist&quot;, a 2004 eight-issue limited series, written by Andy Diggle, penciled by Pasqual Ferry and colored by Dave McCaig, replaced Adam Strange&#x27;s costume with a spacesuit that allows for interstellar travel. Adam is preparing to relocate to Rann permanently when he learns that Sardath transported the planet to another dimension to protect it from Starbreaker. Adam, with the help of the Omega Men and the Darkstars, among others, saves Rann and defeats Starbreaker.

===&quot;Rann-Thanagar War&quot;===

When Rann was moved from Alpha Centauri to Polaris, its orbit was believed to have pushed the planet Thanagar closer to its sun, destroying much of the surface. Many Thanagarians relocate to Rann, but enmity between the two races results in a war. Strange, working with Hawkman, Hawkwoman, Kyle Rayner and Kilowog, ends the war after discovering Superboy-Prime&#x27;s role in Thanagar&#x27;s relocation.

===&quot;52&quot;===

In &quot;52&quot;, Adam is stranded on another planet with Animal Man and Starfire and is blinded in a Zeta-Beam accident. After being attacked by Devilance the Pursuer, the three escape and battle Lady Styx, who is ravaging planets across the galaxy. With Styx presumably defeated and Animal Man seemingly killed, Strange and Starfire continue their journey back to Earth and Rann while Styx&#x27;s followers pursue them. With Starfire wounded in one such battle, and their ship breaking apart and malfunctioning, Adam is rescued by Mogo and a rookie Green Lantern. He is then brought to Rann, where his vision is restored.

===&quot;Countdown to Adventure&quot;===
Adam Strange joined Animal Man and Starfire in the series &quot;Countdown to Adventure&quot; written by Adam Beechen in August 2007.

In issue #1, Adam finds himself replaced as Rann&#x27;s protector by former actor Champ Hazard. However, Hazard has no regard for any life and is responsible for ending his battles in a horrifically bloody way. It appears Champ was infected by a madness plague created by Lady Styx before leaving Earth, and has infected one-third of the people on Rann, causing them to riot and say &quot;Believe in Her&quot;. Adam and his family escape to Earth, where he enlists the aid of Animal Man and Starfire, eventually discovering a way to cure the plague and restore the infectees to normal.

===&quot;Rann-Thanagar Holy War&quot;===
Adam Strange, along with many of the DC space heroes including Hawkman, Starfire, Weird, and Starman, battles Synnar the Demiurge. Adam Strange&#x27;s actions in this story result in the depopulation of Prince Gavyn&#x27;s Throneworld at the hands of Lady Styx. Later, to defeat Synnar and Lady Styx, Rann&#x27;s atmosphere was explosively discharged into outer space with Rann&#x27;s entire population Zeta-beamed to Throneworld. Strange also discovers in this story that he is a member of the so-called Aberrant Six.

===&quot;Strange Adventures&quot;===
With Throneworld renamed New Rann, Adam Strange once more teams up with the DC space heroes to investigate why some of the galaxy&#x27;s stars are disappearing. It is discovered from the future spirit of Synnar that he is destined to be one of &#x27;The Aberrant Six&#x27;, a group critical to preventing the Synnar of today (trapped in Weird&#x27;s body) from destroying the universe. Ultimately the Aberrant Six did not form and the future Synnar was forced to leave, but not before Captain Comet&#x27;s mercenary friend Eye was killed by Synnar&#x27;s supreme god-enemy to prevent the forming of the Six. Comet was entrusted with Eye&#x27;s robot companion Orb until she returns, told by Synnar that when that happens he will &quot;continue his negotiations – all has changed, but remains as it was&quot;. Adam Strange realizes that one day Synnar will return and force him to join his Aberrant Six.

===&quot;R.E.B.E.L.S.&quot;===
Adam Strange later works with Vril Dox and the R.E.B.E.L.S. to battle Starro. It was also around this time that Adam Strange visited New Krypton to protest the accord that their Council reached with the Thanagarians. Explaining that the Rannians have recently been on the losing end in a war with the Thanagarians, Adam questions the judgment of the Council in reaching this accord. Whilst there he aided Superman who was investigating a murder.

The plight of Rann&#x27;s people was soon resolved by Dox, seeking to restore his reputation after Starro stole L.E.G.I.O.N. from him and used it to enslave its client worlds. Dox Zeta-beamed Rann into the Vega system, in the orbit previously held by the now destroyed planet Tamaran, and proceeded to terraform Rann and make it suitable to sustain life again.

The restoration of Rann was not Dox&#x27;s only reason for relocating it into the Vega system. First, by putting Rann into Tamaran&#x27;s orbit, it restored the gravitational balance to the Vega system, which had been thrown off by Tamaran&#x27;s destruction. Secondly, in exchange for restoring their planet, the people of Rann agreed to let Dox rebuild L.E.G.I.O.N. headquarters on Rann.

Tamaranian refugees, led by Blackfire, attacked Rann believing that since the planet was in Tamaran&#x27;s orbit they had claim to it. The violence was ended when Dox, who was off-world at the start of the conflict, arrived with Thanagarian warships and stopped the fighting without bloodshed on either side. As it turned out, Dox was off-world negotiating an end to the Rann-Thanagar War, using Rann&#x27;s newfound distance from Thanagar and change in leadership on both sides as leverage.

Dox then went on to mediate the tension between the Rannians and the Tamaraneans by proposing that the Tamaraneans live on Rann&#x27;s uninhabited southern continent.

Adam Strange, as well as protector of Rann, would also become a senior commander of L.E.G.I.O.N. ensuring peace with the Green Lantern Corps. He also helped create an alliance between Rannians, Tamaraneans and L.E.G.I.O.N. after defeating Starro, ensuring security for Rann, the Vega System and the galaxy.

===The New 52===
In &quot;The New 52&quot;, a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe, Adam Strange was reintroduced to mainstream continuity as a Canadian archaeologist who has a relationship with Alanna (now Alanna Lewis, a former student of his). He and other heroes are teleported to his home planet Rann to stop Byth Rok. He and Alanna then became founding members of the Justice League United. An accident with the Zeta Beam allowed Adam to merge with its time-space energy signature, allowing him to project his consciousness throughout all known reality. By the end of the series, Adam would lose his newfound abilities and return to normal.

During Vandal Savage&#x27;s scheme to gain more power from the comet that made him immortal, the JLU assisted a weaker Superman&#x27;s efforts to thwart his plans. However, the heroes were captured and their powers used as fuel to bring the comet closer to Earth to give Savage&#x27;s descendants their own abilities. They were saved by Superman, who was now empowered by Kryptonite, and the heroes held back Savage&#x27;s forces long enough for Superman to finally defeat the immortal, after which the hero dies.

===DC Rebirth===
Strange was next featured in &quot;The Death of Hawkman&quot; series, once again caught in the middle of the Rann/Thanagar conflict. Suspicious that Thanagar initiated the first attack, Adam began an investigation into the events with the aid of his friend Hawkman. The two soon discover that Despero was behind the conflict, aiming to collect the planets Nth Metal supply. They fought Despero, but the villain proved to be too strong to handle. In an act of desperation, Hawkman ordered Adam to active a machine that will magnetize all of the planets Nth Metal, killing Hawkman and Despero. A reluctant Adam agreed, but the machine unexpectedly sent him hurtling into another dimension.

He soon found his way back to the DC Universe, where he divides his attention between his home world and his adopted world. He also became a reserve member of the Justice League.

==Skills and equipment==
Adam Strange lacks any real superhuman attributes, choosing to rely more on quick thinking and ingenuity. Before coming to Rann, Strange was an accomplished explorer and archaeologist who specialized in gathering and studying lost artifacts found in the remains of ancient civilizations. Applying these qualities to his new life on Rann, he would venture out with his new family into the wilds of their homeworld to study and rediscover its ancient history. Eventually his experiences accumulated on his adventures through the study and understanding of both Rannian culture and its vast technologies as well as its vested history, enabled Adam to pick up a host of vaunted combat techniques and scientific knowledge, giving him the edge needed to physically match and defeat immeasurably more imposing opponents over the many years. He has battled and bested adversaries both native and extraterrestrial in nature, such as Thanagarians, Durlans, Qwardians, En&#x27;Tarans, and Meta-Humans. This along with his many decades of thriving in the harsh environments of Rann, Earth and other galactic territories has made Adam an accomplished survivalist, having spent just as long traversing the rural areas as treacherous as the Amazon rainforest back on Earth.

Strange has a tactical intellect on par with - or exceeding - the likes of Bruce Wayne and Lex Luthor, and complements this with the learning that he has gained in his many years of study on Rann. He is able to reverse engineer functional technological wonders even from the damaged remains of an alien ship with ease. He is also an accomplished mathematician, who can expertly deduce the exact time and place when and where Sardath&#x27;s Zeta Beam will hit on his home planet of Earth. Mark Waid showcases his intellect in his run on &quot;JLA&quot;. After Rann is conquered by a telepathic race called En&#x27;Tarans, Strange defeats them by secretly converting the planet into a giant Zeta Beam gun, powered by the latent Mega Zeta Radiation in his body. With the aid of the JLA, Strange successfully transports the En&#x27;Taran fleet to another part of the galaxy. In the aftermath of the Infinite Crisis event, Adam Strange loses his eyes in a freak Zeta Beam accident. Sardath is able to clone a new set of eyes from his granddaughter, Aleea Strange, and transplant them into Adam. These new eyes enable Adam to see the entire electromagnetic spectrum.

===Technology===
As the protector of Rann, Adam is well connected with Sardath and his science council. Adam uses a colorful variety of technologies both as a hero and spacefarer. The resources pertaining to Rann&#x27;s wonders of science available to him are numerous. He has studied, disassembled and rebuilt much of his own equipment; consisting mainly of high-tech munitions, armor, gadgets &amp; utensils or cutting edge genetics engineering. Strange is also well versed in their mechanical function as well as practical use in his heroic endeavors.

====Space suit====
Strange is an adept aerial combatant, often making use of a fireproof, thermal insulated and environmentally adapted suit with which to traverse the terrains of foreign worlds or in the cold depths of space. With further upgrades, Strange’s costume boasts a built-in Zeta Beamer with which to warp lightyears across the universe in an instant.

The helmet is equipped with a life support system that protects Adam from harmful atmospheric conditions, while the suit itself pulls up a head-up display system with which to control his equipment via thought &amp; voice command. Technology of which is slaved to his handheld blaster, sporting real-time threat assessment and targeting priority reticules to better combat adversaries.

The jetpack is a twin-engine propulsion system attached to a harness adorning his back capable of aerial aviation for an undisclosed amount of time. Strange is also versed in other kinds of rocket propulsion equipment like a booster system with hidden back up blasters, with his equipment Strange can also make escape velocity to break planetary orbit.

====Alien arsenal====
Adam Strange&#x27;s primary weapon of choice is a Rannian laser pistol among other assorted weapons and munitions picked up from across the galaxy. He is a crack marksman with just about any ranged weapon on hand at the time, the gun comes with a targeting system conductor when worked in tandem with his costume and has a stun setting for non-lethal application.

Other munitions in his arsenal include Holo-Blasters, which are Hard-Light Energy arms that Strange can use to conjure any number of ordinance or enhanced protective shielding with while in a firefight. The effectiveness of these armaments makes them potent enough in dispatching Smite, one of Starro&#x27;s lieutenants boasting physical capabilities rivalling Superman or Lobo. When properly calibrated by outside forces, these energy weapons can also channel the light of a Power Ring or a facsimile of its corresponding emotion that can dispatch a small enclave of Black Lanterns.

====Zeta Beamer apparatus====
One of Strange&#x27;s as well as the planet of Rann&#x27;s greatest resource is the Zeta Beam technology developed by Sardath. Initially designed as a means of communications with intelligent life from across the universe, it was accidentally discovered to be an instantaneous means of intergalactic transport that rode along a cosmic radiation called Zeta Rays. The effects of the ray were always short lived, and their dissipation meant Adam would return to where he first intercepted the ray. This would be a running staple for years until later Zeta designs made its effects permanent, albeit at the cost debilitating mental sickness. Eventual innovations in Rannian transport technology produced a more streamlined device called the Zeta Beamer module, an A.I. commanded mobile drone in the form of a floating sphere that could be used to track Zeta Rays across galaxies and even into alternate universes. Like the Mega Zeta Beam, transport was also permanent, without the danger of Zeta Ray sickness. Further modifications integrated the transport device into Adam&#x27;s space suit.

==Awards and reception==
The character and series of the same name have received several awards over the years, including the 1967 and 1968 Alley Awards for Strip Most Desired for Revival. IGN ranked Adam Strange as the 97th greatest comic book hero of all time stating that:If by fluke we were given the chance to ride a Zeta Beam into space, meet a sexy alien princess on the planet Rann, and fight extraterrestrial threats with high-tech weaponry, I wouldn’t want to go back to mundane Earth-life either. That makes us completely sympathetic to Adam Strange’s plight.

<doc id="1025425" wikidata="Q669489" url="?curid=1025425" title="Life thru a Lens">
<text>Life thru a Lens is the debut solo album by English singer-songwriter Robbie Williams following his departure from Take That. Released on 29 September 1997 through Chrysalis Records, the album is influenced by Britpop, a departure from the poppier tone of the music Take That employed. The album&#x27;s working name was &quot;The Show-Off Must Go On&quot;.

The album&#x27;s first three singles, &quot;Old Before I Die&quot;, &quot;Lazy Days&quot; and &quot;South of the Border&quot;, were all moderate successes, but it was the fourth single &quot;Angels&quot; which catapulted Williams to international fame as a solo artist. Peaking at number 4, it has sold over 1 million copies in the UK and is his biggest-selling single to date. The fifth and final single &quot;Let Me Entertain You&quot; reached number 3. &quot;Freedom&quot;, Williams&#x27; first solo single, a cover of George Michael&#x27;s 1990 hit, is not featured on the album.

&quot;Life thru a Lens&quot; debuted at number 11 on the UK Albums Chart and initially remained in the lower regions, but, upon the chart success of &quot;Angels&quot;, it began steadily climbing and finally reached number one in April 1998, five months after its release. Though never selling more than 60,000 copies in a single week, the album sold over 2,094,000 copies by November 2013, making it Williams&#x27; fourth-best-selling studio album and fifth-best-seller when considering &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; (2004).

The album cover art, a photograph of Williams at the centre of a crowd of photographers, was created by Andy Earl. In 2024, the cover was altered to a chimpanzee depiction of Williams for the theatrical poster of his biopic, &quot;Better Man&quot;.

==Recording and music==
After trying hard to find his own sound during a period of personal upheaval, Williams began recordings for the album at London&#x27;s Maison Rouge studios in March 1997, shortly after his introduction to Guy Chambers. The title track, &quot;Life thru a Lens&quot; was written about his then-girlfriend Jacqueline Hamilton-Smith who was a socialite. It is often mistakenly attributed to Tara Palmer-Tompkinson, but they did not date until 2006. &quot;Ego a Go Go&quot; was written about Gary Barlow, &quot;South of the Border&quot; discusses Kate Moss, and &quot;Baby Girl Window&quot; was inspired by Samantha Beckinsale and her late father, actor Richard Beckinsale. &quot;One of God&#x27;s Better People&quot; and &quot;Angels&quot; were inspired by Williams&#x27; mother, Jan. Hidden track &quot;Hello, Sir&quot; is a poem that takes a dig at one of Williams&#x27; former teachers. Williams reprised part of the poem on the 1 Giant Leap song &quot;My Culture&quot;.

The sound of the album is influenced by Britpop, especially bands such as Oasis, a direction his former Take That bandmate Mark Owen had also chosen to pursue on his first solo album &quot;Green Man&quot; (1996). John Bush of AllMusic said that &quot;Life thru a Lens&quot; &quot;continually betrays overt influences from Oasis and other Britpop stars, but triumphs nevertheless due to gorgeous production, Williams&#x27; irresistible personality, and the overall flavor of outrageous, utterly enjoyable pop music.&quot;

==Critical reception==

Writing for &quot;Melody Maker&quot; in October 1997, Robin Bresnark gave &quot;Life thru a Lens&quot; a negative review; &quot;There&#x27;s nothing here... sure, Robbie Williams is as fascinating a hapless goon as we&#x27;re ever likely to come across. But this album feels more like a press release than an album – and that&#x27;s not what I call music.&quot; However, John Bush of AllMusic was very positive in his four and a half stars out of five review, calling the album &quot;excellent&quot; and &quot;one of the best U.K. debuts of the &#x27;90s&quot;.

&quot;Q&quot; ranked the album at number 43 in their 2004 list of &quot;The 50 (+50) Best British Albums Ever&quot; and in their unordered 2005 list of the &quot;Ultimate Music Collection&quot;. &quot;Record Collector&quot; included the album in their unordered 2000 list of &quot;10 Classic Albums from 21 Genres for the 21st Century&quot;, whilst Robert Dimery included the album in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

Martin C. Strong, writing in &quot;The Great Rock Discography&quot;, reflected that the general critical consensus on &quot;Life Thru a Lens&quot; was &quot;that Williams was having the last laugh, beating his former Take That cronies hands down (both Gary Barlow and Mark Owen were taking the solo road with middling success) and winning over a cross section of musical palates with his irrepressible style.&quot; Colin Larkin of &quot;The Encyclopedia of Popular Music&quot; considers it an &quot;excellent&quot; album that eclipsed Barlow&#x27;s album &quot;Open Road&quot;, &quot;both musically and critically&quot;. Commenting on the album&#x27;s music and it topping the UK charts 28 weeks after its initial release, Larkin wrote: &quot;Never before had so many pundits and critics been proved so wrong.&quot; &quot;Rough Guides&quot; contributor Jane Holly writes that &quot;Life Thru a Lens&quot; shows &quot;a wide mix of styles&quot; from ballads to rockers.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Life thru a Lens&quot; was released in October 1997, not long after Williams&#x27;s stint in rehab. It was launched with his first live solo gig at the Élysée Montmartre in Paris. At first, the album was slow to take off, debuting at number 11 on the UK Albums Chart, and falling to 104 not long after release, having sold a little over 30,000 copies. It reached the number one position after spending 27 weeks on the chart, as a consequence of the huge success of the &quot;Angels&quot; single, boosting the album&#x27;s sales to 300,000. The album spent a total of 218 weeks on the chart and two weeks at number one, becoming the 58th best selling album of all time in the UK with sales of 2.4 million copies. Despite its success in Williams&#x27; homeland, the album failed to make a bigger impact in the international market. However, in Argentina, it reached the top ten in early 1998. &quot;Life thru a Lens&quot; has sold more than 4 million copies worldwide and has been certified as 8× Platinum in the UK.

==Singles==
* &quot;Old Before I Die&quot;, a track co-written by Williams, Eric Bazilian, and Desmond Child, was released as the album&#x27;s lead single in April 1997, peaking at #2 on the UK Singles Chart. The song failed to make an impact in other international charts.
* &quot;Lazy Days&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s second single in the summer of 1997, amidst Williams&#x27; battle with addiction. He was allowed to check out from rehab to shoot the video for the song. The single charted at number-eight in the United Kingdom but, because promotion was nonexistent, struggled to reach the top forty of any other European chart.
* &quot;South of the Border&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s third single in September 1997. It failed to make a significant impact on the UK Singles Chart, peaking at #14, and as such, many saw this as the end of Williams&#x27; solo career.
* &quot;Angels&quot;, a song penned by Williams and Guy Chambers, was released as the album&#x27;s fourth single. The decision to release the song came after Williams met the record company to discuss concerns about his future. The single was released in December 1997, soon becoming Williams&#x27; best selling-single in the United Kingdom, being certified 2× Platinum by the BPI. The song became a hit around Europe and Latin America and sold almost two million copies worldwide, rocketing sales of his album.
* &quot;Let Me Entertain You&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s fifth and final single in March 1998. It peaked at #3 on the UK Singles Chart, becoming one of Williams&#x27; signature songs and being the opening song for most of Williams&#x27; concerts throughout his career.

<doc id="1025430" wikidata="Q442003" url="?curid=1025430" title="Patricia Crowther (Wiccan)">
<text>Patricia Crowther (born 14 October 1927) who also goes by the craft name Thelema, is a British occultist considered influential in the early promotion of the Wiccan religion and she is the mother of the witch or wiccan runes.

==Early life==
Crowther was born in Sheffield in 1927, then as Patricia Dawson. She was initiated into Witchcraft by fellow well-known Wiccan Gerald Gardner. Her handfasting to husband Arnold Crowther (1909–1974) took place in 1960.

==Career==
Along with Doreen Valiente, Lois Bourne, and Eleanor Bone, Crowther is considered to be one of the &quot;early mothers&quot; of modern Wicca. Patricia and her then-husband, Arnold Crowther, founded the Sheffield Coven in 1961, of which they were High Priestess and High Priest. Crowther has promoted Witchcraft through a number of book publications, contributions to occult magazines and journals, and through a number of interviews with local and national newspapers. She has also appeared several times on television.

In 1971, both Patricia and her then-husband Arnold wrote and presented &quot;A Spell of Witchcraft&quot;, a radio programme produced and broadcast by BBC Radio Sheffield in six 20-minute parts. The radio programme, the first of its kind in relation to modern Witchcraft as a religion, explored the history and folklore of Witchcraft and presented elements of a local coven&#x27;s activities and practices within the community.

<doc id="1025437" wikidata="Q6233842" url="?curid=1025437" title="John Frame (theologian)">
<text>John McElphatrick Frame (born April 8, 1939) is a retired American Christian philosopher and Calvinist theologian especially noted for his work in epistemology and presuppositional apologetics, systematic theology, and ethics. He is one of the foremost interpreters and critics of the thought of Cornelius Van Til.

==Biography==
Frame was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and became a Christian at the age of 13 through the ministry of Beverly Heights Presbyterian Church, a congregation of the United Presbyterian Church of North America in Pittsburgh. He graduated from Princeton University, where he was involved in the Princeton Evangelical Fellowship (PEF) and Westerly Road Church. The PEF and Westerly Road had a profound impact on forming Frame&#x27;s faith and theology. He says of their impact:

I owe much to PEF ... Fullerton and PEF cared deeply about people, spending hours in mutual prayer, exhortation, counseling, gospel witness. I never experienced that depth of fellowship in any Reformed church or institution ... So I am not much impressed by people who want to set up an adversary relation between &quot;Reformed&quot; and &quot;evangelical.&quot; Today, Reformed writers often disparage evangelical ministries as circuses, as clubs that will do anything at all to gain members, who pander to the basest lusts of modern culture. That was not true of PEF, or of Westerly Road Church ... PEF would never have imagined the effect their ministry had on me: they turned me into a Reformed ecumenist!
Frame received degrees from Princeton University (A.B.), Westminster Theological Seminary (BD), Yale University (AM, and M.Phil. and began work on a doctoral dissertation). He received an honorary doctorate of divinity in 2003 from Belhaven College. He has served on the faculty of Westminster Theological Seminary, and was a founding faculty member of their California campus; , Frame is an emeritus faculty member at Reformed Theological Seminary in Orlando, Florida. He is an ordained minister in the Presbyterian Church in America.

== Relations to other scholars: polemics and critical reviews ==

Frame is known for his critical view of historical modes of theology, including his criticism of such scholars as David F. Wells, Donald Bloesch, Mark Noll, George Marsden, D.G. Hart, Richard Muller, and Michael Horton. Particularly notable amongst Frame&#x27;s critical analyses is &quot;Machen&#x27;s Warrior Children&quot;, originally published in &quot;Alister E. McGrath and Evangelical Theology: a Dynamic Engagement&quot; (Paternoster Press, 2003). More recently, Frame reviewed Horton&#x27;s book &quot;Christless Christianity&quot; with a similar analysis. In 1998, he debated then librarian D.G. Hart in a student-organized discussion of the regulative principle of worship.

==Multiperspectival epistemology==
Frame has elaborated a Christian epistemology in his 1987 work &quot;The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God&quot;. In this work, he develops what he calls &quot;triperspectivalism&quot; or &quot;multiperspectivalism&quot; which says that in every act of knowing, the knower is in constant contact with three things (or &quot;perspectives&quot;) – the knowing subject himself, the object of knowledge, and the standard or criteria by which knowledge is attained. He argues that each perspective is interrelated to the others in such a fashion that, in knowing one of these, one actually knows the other two, also. His student and collaborator Vern Poythress has further developed this idea with respect to science and theology. Reformed theologian Meredith Kline wrote a critique of this view, explaining that Poythress and Frame had used multiperspectivalism in ways that had led to what he considered incorrect conclusions in regards to the relation of Kline&#x27;s position and Greg L. Bahnsen&#x27;s on covenant theology (more specifically theonomy).

==Presuppositions==
As a former student of Van Til, Frame is supporter of the presuppositionalist school of Christian apologetics. He defines a presupposition as follows:

==Rationalism and irrationalism in non-Christian thought==
Frame, developing the thought of his mentor Cornelius Van Til, has asserted in both his &quot;Apologetics to the Glory of God&quot; and his &quot;Cornelius Van Til: An Analysis of His Thought&quot;, that all non-Christian thought can be categorized as the ebb and flow of rationalism and irrationalism.

===Rationalism===
In this context Frame defines rationalism as any attempt to establish the finite human mind as the ultimate standard of truth and falsity. This establishing of the autonomous intellect occurs within the context of rejecting God&#x27;s revelation of himself in both nature and the Bible; a rationalist, in this sense, states that the human mind is able to fully and exhaustively explain reality.

Yet, when Frame speaks of &quot;exhaustive explanations&quot; he does not mean these systems seek omniscience; rather, he means that the history of non-Christian thought (though, admittedly, his focus is Western philosophy) is the history of various attempts to construct systems that account for everything (a distinctive metaphysic, epistemology and value theory).

According to Frame, examples of attempts to explain reality are found in Plato and Aristotle&#x27;s form/matter dualism; the debate between the nominalists and the realists over the status of universals and particulars, and the &quot;all is ... [fire, water, atoms,etc]&quot; of the pre-Socratics. More examples would include Descartes&#x27; mind/body dualism, Spinoza&#x27;s God or nature, and Leibniz&#x27;s monadology, Plotinus&#x27; &quot;The One&quot; and his teaching on emanation, the British empiricists&#x27; attempts to limit knowledge and possibility to that which can be empirically verified, Kant&#x27;s worlds of the noumena and the phenomena, and Hegel&#x27;s dialectic.

==Awards and recognition==

Belhaven College awarded Frame an honorary Doctor of Divinity in 2003.

==Personal life==
Frame married Mary Grace Cummings in 1984, and has two sons and three stepchildren. As of 2024, he lives in Orlando, Florida.

<doc id="1025441" wikidata="Q530083" url="?curid=1025441" title="The Seeds of Love">
<text>The Seeds of Love is the third studio album by English pop rock band Tears for Fears, released on 25 September 1989 by Fontana Records. It retained the band&#x27;s epic sound while incorporating influences ranging from jazz and soul to Beatlesque pop. Its lengthy production and scrapped recording sessions cost over £1 million. The album spawned the title hit single &quot;Sowing the Seeds of Love&quot;, as well as &quot;Woman in Chains&quot;, and &quot;Advice for the Young at Heart&quot;, both of which reached the top 40 in several countries.

&quot;The Seeds of Love&quot; was an international success, entering the UK Albums Chart at number one, and top ten in other countries including the United States. It has been certified Gold or Platinum in several territories including the United Kingdom, the US, France, Germany, Canada, and the Netherlands. Despite its success, personal tensions during recording led to band members Curt Smith and Roland Orzabal splitting up at the conclusion of their 1990 world tour, with Orzabal remaining as the band&#x27;s sole official member until the two reunited in the early 2000s.

In October 2020, the remastered reissue of &quot;The Seeds of Love&quot; was released in several formats including a super deluxe edition, with B-sides, remixes, and a 5.1 surround sound mix.

==Production==
The first song composed for &quot;The Seeds of Love&quot; was &quot;Badman&#x27;s Song&quot; (originally titled &quot;The Bad Man Song&quot;), written during the band&#x27;s 1985 world tour after Roland Orzabal overheard two members of the tour personnel maligning him in a hotel room one night. The song was co-written by Orzabal with keyboardist Nicky Holland, who was touring with the band throughout 1985. Holland would go on to play an integral part in the writing and recording of &quot;The Seeds of Love&quot;, much as keyboardist Ian Stanley had on the band&#x27;s previous album &quot;Songs from the Big Chair&quot;.

Recording sessions for the album began in late 1986 with producers Clive Langer and Alan Winstanley, but Orzabal and Curt Smith were unhappy with the results and so the recordings were scrapped in early 1987. Chris Hughes (who had produced both the previous Tears for Fears albums) was then brought back into the fold, but again conflicts arose over the direction of the new material. Orzabal in particular had grown weary of composing and playing music using machines and sequencers, as the majority of Tears for Fears&#x27; music had been up to that point, and was striving for something more organic and a different way of working.

The song &quot;Sowing the Seeds of Love&quot; was written in June 1987, the same week as the UK general election in which Margaret Thatcher and the Conservative Party won a third consecutive term in office (reflected in the lyric &quot;Politician granny with your high ideals, have you no idea how the majority feels?&quot;). Hughes and keyboardist Stanley both left the project later in 1987 citing &quot;creative differences&quot;, though their contributions to the track remained on the final album. After two failed attempts to make the album, the band opted to produce it themselves, assisted by engineer Dave Bascombe. Also in 1987, Orzabal and Smith flew over to the US to track down a hotel lounge pianist/vocalist named Oleta Adams, whom they had seen playing in Kansas City during their 1985 American tour. Hoping she could add to the organic feel by bringing a soulful warmth to their music, they invited Adams to work with them on their new album. Adams would ultimately perform on three tracks (&quot;Woman in Chains&quot;, &quot;Badman&#x27;s Song&quot; and &quot;Standing on the Corner of the Third World&quot;), and a solo recording contract was also offered to her by the band&#x27;s record company Fontana.

Recording recommenced in early 1988 and lasted until the summer of 1989. Featuring an assortment of respected session players including drummers Manu Katché and Simon Phillips, bassist Pino Palladino, and a guest appearance by Phil Collins on drums, much of the album was recorded as jam sessions featuring different performances of the music and then edited down later. Some of the tracks, particularly &quot;Badman&#x27;s Song&quot;, were recorded several times in a variety of musical styles including, according to Holland, versions of the song that were reminiscent of Barry White, Little Feat and Steely Dan before settling on the jazz/gospel version that is on the finished album. Co-producer Dave Bascombe commented that the final version of the song was almost nothing like the original demo because it had gone through so many changes. The track &quot;Swords and Knives&quot; was originally written for the 1986 film &quot;Sid and Nancy&quot; (about the relationship between Sid Vicious and Nancy Spungen), but was rejected by the filmmakers for not being &quot;punk&quot; enough.

Due to the starry cast of session players and lengthy production process, including the scrapped earlier recordings, the album reportedly cost £1 million to make (by comparison, &quot;Songs from the Big Chair&quot; cost approximately £70,000). The final mix of the album was completed at London&#x27;s Mayfair Studios in July 1989. Frustrations during the making of the album had also given rise to tensions between Orzabal and Smith, Orzabal having become something of an intricate perfectionist and Smith preoccupied with living a jet set lifestyle rather than focusing on the album (Smith&#x27;s first marriage had also ended in divorce during the making of the album). At one point, Orzabal considered calling the album &quot;Famous Last Words&quot; (the title of the album&#x27;s final track), commenting &quot;it may well turn out to be our last album.&quot; Indeed, the duo did not make any further recordings together for over a decade.

==Release==
Now assigned to the newly reactivated Phonogram subsidiary label Fontana, the first single from the album, &quot;Sowing the Seeds of Love&quot;, was released in August 1989. It became a worldwide hit, peaking at number 5 in the UK, number 2 in the US, and number 1 in Canada. The album was released in September 1989, entering the UK Albums Chart at number 1 and would be certified Platinum by the BPI within three weeks. In the US, it peaked at number 8 and was also certified Platinum. The album reached the top ten in numerous other countries around the world.

Two other singles from the album, &quot;Woman in Chains&quot; (recorded as a duet with Adams) and &quot;Advice for the Young at Heart&quot; (the only track featuring Smith on lead vocals) reached the Top 40 in UK and internationally. &quot;Famous Last Words&quot; was released as fourth single in mid-1990 by the record company without the band&#x27;s involvement, though this only peaked at number 83 in the UK. A video compilation, &quot;Sowing the Seeds&quot;, featuring the promo videos for the first three singles from the album was also released in 1990.

The band embarked on a world tour to promote the album in 1990, featuring Adams both as a support act and as a player with the band (her solo album, &quot;Circle of One&quot;, produced by Orzabal and Dave Bascombe was also released during this time). The band&#x27;s concert at the Santa Barbara County Bowl in May 1990 was filmed and released on home video, titled &quot;Going to California&quot;.

A 64-page companion book to the album, entitled &quot;Tears for Fears – The Seeds of Love&quot;, was also released in 1990 by Virgin Books and offers insight into the writing and recording process behind the album as well as the sheet music for each song and rare promotional photographs from the period.

The album was remastered and reissued in 1999 with four bonus tracks which were originally B-sides to the album&#x27;s first three singles. It does not include the B-side &quot;My Life in the Suicide Ranks&quot; which was an additional B-side to &quot;Woman in Chains&quot; and could at the time only be found on the band&#x27;s 1996 rarities compilation &quot;Saturnine Martial &amp; Lunatic&quot;. &quot;The Seeds of Love&quot; was re-released again in 2020 in five different formats including a 5-disc super deluxe edition boxed set featuring bonus material such as single versions, B-sides (this time including &quot;My Life in the Suicide Ranks&quot;), demos, outtakes, and a 5.1 surround-sound mix, again made by Steven Wilson, who also was responsible for the surround mix for &quot;Songs from the Big Chair&quot;. Other editions released at the same time include a 2-CD deluxe edition, a single CD edition, a vinyl album, and a vinyl picture disc album. The deluxe edition peaked at number 13 on the UK Albums Chart in October 2020.

==Reception==
Lloyd Bradley praised &quot;The Seeds of Love&quot; in &quot;Q&quot;, summarising the album as &quot;such a radical departure from Tears for Fears&#x27; robust, anthemic pop songs of the early &#x27;80s as to make them seem irrelevant.&quot; In &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Michael Azerrad wrote, &quot;If with the title track Tears for Fears beg comparison to the Beatles, it&#x27;s in the unspoken assertion that popular music can also be outstanding music. That&#x27;s something this remarkable record proves over and over again.&quot; Greg Kot of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; described the album as &quot;astonishing&quot;, with a &quot;wide open, soulful spaciousness that belies the heavy production expenses&quot;. &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; critic Chris Willman enjoyed the first three songs but lamented the &quot;uncharacteristically frenzied rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll climaxes&quot; and &quot;underdeveloped and overwrought&quot; lyrics among the later tracks, describing the album as overall &quot;just so-so&quot;. Simon Williams, writing for &quot;NME&quot;, perceived &quot;The Seeds of Love&quot; as a self-consciously &quot;&#x27;adult&#x27; and &#x27;mature&#x27;&quot; effort and found that Tears for Fears had &quot;tumbled from joyful pop simplicity to cliche-ridden complexity.&quot;

In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Stanton Swihart observed the album&#x27;s &quot;polished, atmospheric soul&quot;, labelling it &quot;the apotheosis of Orzabal and Smith&#x27;s evolution&quot;. A review of the 1999 reissue by AllMusic&#x27;s Bruce Eder pointed towards &quot;the best vocals in Tears for Fears&#x27; history&quot; and &quot;their most ambitious production&quot;. Appraising the 2020 reissue for &quot;Record Collector&quot;, John Earls alluded to Orzabal&#x27;s &quot;obsessive determination to achieve Steely Dan levels of technical perfection&quot;, while crediting his &quot;melodic gifts&quot; with preventing the album from &quot;becoming too overblown&quot;. On the other hand, Ira Robbins of &quot;Trouser Press&quot; had praise for the title track and Adams&#x27;s soulful vocals, but described the bulk of the album as &quot;absurdly overintellectualized&quot; and &quot;almost impenetrable&quot;.

==30th anniversary reissue==
Following the reissue campaigns of &quot;The Hurting&quot; (2013) and &quot;Songs from the Big Chair&quot; (2014), in October 2020, the remastered super deluxe edition of &quot;The Seeds of Love&quot; was released in several formats, including B-sides, remixes, 22 previously unreleased recordings, and a 5.1 surround sound mix.

Paul Sinclair, founder and head editor of the website SuperDeluxeEdition, co-compiled the track listing and interviewed band members, producers and collaborators for the extensive sleeve notes of the edition.

<doc id="1025455" wikidata="Q1200279" url="?curid=1025455" title="Killing vector field">
<text>In mathematics, a Killing vector field (often called a Killing field), named after Wilhelm Killing, is a vector field on a pseudo-Riemannian manifold that preserves the metric tensor. Killing vector fields are the infinitesimal generators of isometries; that is, flows generated by Killing vector fields are continuous isometries of the manifold. More simply, the flow generates a symmetry, in the sense that moving each point of an object the same distance in the direction of the Killing vector will not distort distances on the object.

== Definition ==

Specifically, a vector field formula_1 is a Killing vector field if the Lie derivative with respect to formula_1 of the metric tensor formula_3 vanishes:
: formula_4

In terms of the Levi-Civita connection, this is
: formula_5
for all vectors formula_6 and . In local coordinates, this amounts to the Killing equation
: formula_7

This condition is expressed in covariant form. Therefore, it is sufficient to establish it in a preferred coordinate system in order to have it hold in all coordinate systems.

== Examples ==
=== Killing field on the circle ===

The vector field on a circle that points counterclockwise and has the same magnitude at each point is a Killing vector field, since moving each point on the circle along this vector field simply rotates the circle.

=== Killing fields on the hyperbolic plane ===

A toy example for a Killing vector field is on the upper half-plane formula_8 equipped with the Poincaré metric . The pair formula_9 is typically called the hyperbolic plane and has Killing vector field formula_10 (using standard coordinates). This should be intuitively clear since the covariant derivative formula_11 transports the metric tensor along an integral curve generated by the vector field (whose image is parallel to the x-axis).

Furthermore, the metric tensor is independent of formula_12 from which we can immediately conclude that formula_10 is a Killing field using one of the results below in this article.

The isometry group of the upper half-plane model (or rather, the component connected to the identity) is formula_14 (see Poincaré half-plane model), and the other two Killing fields may be derived from considering the action of the generators of formula_14 on the upper half-plane. The other two generating Killing fields are dilatation formula_16 and the special conformal transformation .

=== Killing fields on a 2-sphere ===
The Killing fields of the two-sphere , or more generally the formula_17-sphere formula_18 should be obvious from ordinary intuition: spheres, having rotational symmetry, should possess Killing fields which generate rotations about any axis. That is, we expect formula_19 to have symmetry under the action of the 3D rotation group SO(3). That is, by using the &quot;a priori&quot; knowledge that spheres can be embedded in Euclidean space, it is immediately possible to guess the form of the Killing fields. 

The conventional chart for the 2-sphere embedded in formula_20 in Cartesian coordinates formula_21 is given by 
: formula_22
so that formula_23 parametrises the height, and formula_24 parametrises rotation about the formula_25-axis.

The pullback of the standard Cartesian metric formula_26 gives the standard metric on the sphere,
: formula_27

Intuitively, a rotation about any axis should be an isometry. In this chart, the vector field which generates rotations about the formula_25-axis:
: formula_29
In these coordinates, the metric components are all independent of , which shows that formula_30 is a Killing field.

The vector field
: formula_31
is not a Killing field; the coordinate formula_23 explicitly appears in the metric. The flow generated by formula_33 goes from north to south; points at the north pole spread apart, those at the south come together. Any transformation that moves points closer or farther apart cannot be an isometry; therefore, the generator of such motion cannot be a Killing field.

The generator formula_30 is recognized as a rotation about the formula_25-axis
: formula_36

A second generator, for rotations about the formula_12-axis, is
: formula_38

The third generator, for rotations about the formula_39-axis, is
: formula_40

The algebra given by linear combinations of these three generators closes, and obeys the relations 
: formula_41

This is the Lie algebra .

Expressing formula_1 and formula_6 in terms of spherical coordinates gives
: formula_44
and
: formula_45

That these three vector fields are actually Killing fields can be determined in two different ways. One is by explicit computation: just plug in explicit expressions for formula_46 and chug to show that . This is a worth-while exercise. Alternately, one can recognize formula_47 and formula_48 are the generators of isometries in Euclidean space, and since the metric on the sphere is inherited from metric in Euclidean space, the isometries are inherited as well.
These three Killing fields form a complete set of generators for the algebra. They are not unique: any linear combination of these three fields is still a Killing field.

There are several subtle points to note about this example.
* The three fields are not globally non-zero; indeed, the field formula_48 vanishes at the north and south poles; likewise, formula_1 and formula_6 vanish at antipodes on the equator. One way to understand this is as a consequence of the &quot;hairy ball theorem&quot;. This property, of bald spots, is a general property of symmetric spaces in the Cartan decomposition. At each point on the manifold, the algebra of the Killing fields splits naturally into two parts, one part which is tangent to the manifold, and another part which is vanishing (at the point where the decomposition is being made).
* The three fields formula_47 and formula_48 are not of unit length. One can normalize by dividing by the common factor of formula_54 appearing in all three expressions. However, in that case, the fields are no longer smooth: for example, formula_55 is singular (non-differentiable) at the north and south poles.
* The three fields are not point-wise orthogonal; indeed, they cannot be, as, at any given point, the tangent-plane is two-dimensional, while there are three vectors. Given any point on the sphere, there is some non-trivial linear combination of formula_47 and formula_48 that vanishes: these three vectors are an over-complete basis for the two-dimensional tangent plane at that point.
* The &quot;a priori&quot; knowledge that spheres can be embedded into Euclidean space, and thus inherit a metric tensor from this embedding, leads to a confusing intuition about the correct number of Killing fields that one might expect. Without such an embedding, intuition might suggest that the number of linearly independent generators would be no greater than the dimension of the tangent bundle. After all, fixing any point on a manifold, one can only move in those directions that are tangent. The dimension of the tangent bundle for the 2-sphere is two, and yet three Killing fields are found. Again, this &quot;surprise&quot; is a generic property of symmetric spaces.

=== Killing fields in Minkowski space ===
The Killing fields of Minkowski space are the 3 space translations, time translation, three generators of rotations (the little group) and the three generators of boosts. These are
* Time and space translations
*: formula_58
* Vector fields generating three rotations, often called the J generators,
*: formula_59
* Vector fields generating three boosts, the K generators,
*: formula_60

The boosts and rotations generate the Lorentz group. Together with space-time translations, this forms the Lie algebra for the Poincaré group.

=== Killing fields in flat space ===
Here we derive the Killing fields for general flat space.
From Killing&#x27;s equation and the Ricci identity for a covector ,
: formula_61
(using abstract index notation) where formula_62 is the Riemann curvature tensor, the following identity may be proven for a Killing field formula_63:
: formula_64
When the base manifold formula_65 is flat space, that is, Euclidean space or pseudo-Euclidean space (as for Minkowski space), we can choose global flat coordinates such that in these coordinates, the Levi-Civita connection and hence Riemann curvature vanishes everywhere, giving
: formula_66
Integrating and imposing the Killing equation allows us to write the general solution to formula_67 as
: formula_68
where formula_69 is antisymmetric. By taking appropriate values of formula_70 and , we get a basis for the generalised Poincaré algebra of isometries of flat space:
: formula_71
: formula_72
These generate pseudo-rotations (rotations and boosts) and translations respectively. Intuitively these preserve the metric tensor at each point.

For (pseudo-)Euclidean space of total dimension, in total there are formula_73 generators, making flat space maximally symmetric. This number is generic for maximally symmetric spaces. Maximally symmetric spaces can be considered as sub-manifolds of flat space, arising as surfaces of constant proper distance 
: formula_74
which have O(&quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;) symmetry. If the submanifold has dimension , this group of symmetries has the expected dimension (as a Lie group).

Heuristically, we can derive the dimension of the Killing field algebra. Treating Killing&#x27;s equation formula_75 together with the identity . as a system of second order differential equations for , we can determine the value of formula_76 at any point given initial data at a point . The initial data specifies formula_77 and , but Killing&#x27;s equation imposes that the covariant derivative is antisymmetric. In total this is formula_78 independent values of initial data.

For concrete examples, see below for examples of flat space (Minkowski space) and maximally symmetric spaces (sphere, hyperbolic space).

=== Killing fields in general relativity ===
Killing fields are used to discuss isometries in general relativity (in which the geometry of spacetime as distorted by gravitational fields is viewed as a 4-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian manifold). In a static configuration, in which nothing changes with time, the time vector will be a Killing vector, and thus the Killing field will point in the direction of forward motion in time. For example, the Schwarzschild metric has four Killing fields: the metric tensor is independent of , hence formula_79 is a time-like Killing field. The other three are the three generators of rotations discussed above. The Kerr metric for a rotating black hole has only two Killing fields: the time-like field, and a field generating rotations about the axis of rotation of the black hole.

De Sitter space and anti-de Sitter space are maximally symmetric spaces, with the formula_17-dimensional versions of each possessing formula_81 Killing fields.

=== Killing field of a constant coordinate ===
If the metric tensor coefficients formula_82 in some coordinate basis formula_83 are independent of one of the coordinates , then formula_84 is a Killing vector, where formula_85 is the Kronecker delta.

To prove this, let us assume . Then formula_86 and .

Now let us look at the Killing condition
: formula_87
and from . The Killing condition becomes
: formula_88
that is, , which is true.
* The physical meaning is, for example, that, if none of the metric tensor coefficients is a function of time, the manifold must automatically have a time-like Killing vector.
* In layman&#x27;s terms, if an object doesn&#x27;t transform or &quot;evolve&quot; in time (when time passes), time passing won&#x27;t change the measures of the object. Formulated like this, the result sounds like a tautology, but one has to understand that the example is very much contrived: Killing fields apply also to much more complex and interesting cases.

Conversely, if the metric tensor formula_89 admits a Killing field , then one can construct coordinates for which . These coordinates are constructed by taking a hypersurface formula_90 such that formula_63 is nowhere tangent to . Take coordinates formula_92 on , then define local coordinates formula_93 where formula_94 denotes the parameter along the integral curve of formula_63 based at formula_96 on . In these coordinates, the Lie derivative reduces to the coordinate derivative, that is,
: formula_97
and by the definition of the Killing field the left-hand side vanishes.

== Properties ==
A Killing field is determined uniquely by a vector at some point and its gradient (i.e. all covariant derivatives of the field at the point).

The Lie bracket of two Killing fields is still a Killing field. The Killing fields on a manifold &quot;M&quot; thus form a Lie subalgebra of vector fields on &quot;M&quot;. This is the Lie algebra of the isometry group of the manifold if &quot;M&quot; is complete. A Riemannian manifold with a transitive group of isometries is a homogeneous space.

For compact manifolds
* Negative Ricci curvature implies there are no nontrivial (nonzero) Killing fields.
* Nonpositive Ricci curvature implies that any Killing field is parallel. i.e. covariant derivative along any vector field is identically zero.
* If the sectional curvature is positive and the dimension of &quot;M&quot; is even, a Killing field must have a zero.

The covariant divergence of every Killing vector field vanishes.

If formula_1 is a Killing vector field and formula_6 is a harmonic vector field, then formula_100 is a harmonic function.

If formula_1 is a Killing vector field and formula_102 is a harmonic p-form, then .

=== Geodesics ===
Each Killing vector corresponds to a quantity which is conserved along geodesics. This conserved quantity is the metric product between the Killing vector and the geodesic tangent vector. Along an affinely parametrized geodesic with tangent vector formula_103 then given the Killing vector , the quantity formula_104 is conserved:
: formula_105

This aids in analytically studying motions in a spacetime with symmetries.

=== Stress-energy tensor ===
Given a conserved, symmetric tensor , that is, one satisfying formula_106 and , which are properties typical of a stress-energy tensor, and a Killing vector , we can construct the conserved quantity formula_107 satisfying
: formula_108

=== Cartan decomposition ===
As noted above, the Lie bracket of two Killing fields is still a Killing field. The Killing fields on a manifold formula_65 thus form a Lie subalgebra formula_110 of all vector fields on . Selecting a point , the algebra formula_110 can be decomposed into two parts:
: formula_112
and
: formula_113

where formula_114 is the covariant derivative. These two parts intersect trivially but do not in general split . For instance, if formula_65 is a Riemannian homogeneous space, we have formula_116 if and only if formula_65 is a Riemannian symmetric space.

Intuitively, the isometries of formula_65 locally define a submanifold formula_119 of the total space, and the Killing fields show how to &quot;slide along&quot; that submanifold. They span the tangent space of that submanifold. The tangent space formula_120 should have the same dimension as the isometries acting effectively at that point. That is, one expects . Yet, in general, the number of Killing fields is larger than the dimension of that tangent space. How can this be? The answer is that the &quot;extra&quot; Killing fields are redundant. Taken all together, the fields provide an over-complete basis for the tangent space at any particular selected point; linear combinations can be made to vanish at that particular point. This was seen in the example of the Killing fields on a 2-sphere: there are three Killing vector fields; at any given point, two span the tangent space at that point, and the third one is a linear combination of the other two. Picking any two defines ; the remaining degenerate linear combinations define an orthogonal space .

=== Cartan involution ===
The Cartan involution is defined as the mirroring or reversal of the direction of a geodesic. Its differential flips the direction of the tangents to a geodesic. It is a linear operator of norm one; it has two invariant subspaces, of eigenvalue +1 and −1. These two subspaces correspond to formula_121 and , respectively.

This can be made more precise. Fixing a point formula_122 consider a geodesic formula_123 passing through , with . The involution formula_124 is defined as
: formula_125

This map is an involution, in that . When restricted to geodesics along the Killing fields, it is also clearly an isometry. It is uniquely defined.

Let formula_126 be the group of isometries generated by the Killing fields. The function formula_127 defined by
: formula_128
is a homomorphism of . Its infinitesimal formula_129 is
: formula_130

The Cartan involution is a Lie algebra homomorphism, in that
: formula_131
for all . The subspace formula_132 has odd parity under the Cartan involution, while formula_121 has even parity. That is, denoting the Cartan involution at point formula_122 as formula_135 one has
: formula_136
and
: formula_137
where formula_138 is the identity map. From this, it follows that the subspace formula_121 is a Lie subalgebra of , in that .
As these are even and odd parity subspaces, the Lie brackets split, so that
formula_140 and .

The above decomposition holds at all points formula_122 for a symmetric space ; proofs can be found in Jost. They also hold in more general settings, but not necessarily at all points of the manifold.

For the special case of a symmetric space, one explicitly has that ; that is, the Killing fields span the entire tangent space of a symmetric space. Equivalently, the curvature tensor is covariantly constant on locally symmetric spaces, and so these are locally parallelizable; this is the Cartan–Ambrose–Hicks theorem.

== Generalizations ==
* Killing vector fields can be generalized to conformal Killing vector fields defined by formula_142 for some scalar . The derivatives of one parameter families of conformal maps are conformal Killing fields.
* Killing tensor fields are symmetric tensor fields &quot;T&quot; such that the trace-free part of the symmetrization of formula_143 vanishes. Examples of manifolds with Killing tensors include the rotating black hole and the FRW cosmology.
* Killing vector fields can also be defined on any manifold &quot;M&quot; (possibly without a metric tensor) if we take any Lie group &quot;G&quot; acting on it instead of the group of isometries. In this broader sense, a Killing vector field is the pushforward of a right invariant vector field on &quot;G&quot; by the group action. If the group action is effective, then the space of the Killing vector fields is isomorphic to the Lie algebra formula_110 of &quot;G&quot;.

<text>Heilbad Heiligenstadt is a spa town in Thuringia, Germany. It is the capital of the Eichsfeld district.

==Geography==
Heiligenstadt is approximately 14 km east of the tripoint where the states of Thuringia, Hesse and Lower Saxony meet. It lies on the upper course of the river Leine (a tributary of the Aller) that flows through the town from east to west and is joined near the centre of the town by the Geislede.

South of the town is the Iberg, a 453.2 m tall peak located in the Heiligenstadt Stadtwald, which forms part of the Naturpark Eichsfeld-Hainich-Werratal.

===Local subdivisions===
The municipality of Heilbad Heiligenstadt consists of the central town and the following villages (&quot;Ortsteile&quot;):
* Bernterode
* Flinsberg, the geographical centre of Germany.
* Glasehausen
* Günterode
* Hohes Kreuz
* Kalteneber
* Rengelrode

==History==
* Heiligenstadt was first mentioned in 973.
* In 1022 it was acquired by the archbishop of Mainz.
* In 1227, the town received town rights from the archbishop of Mainz.
* In 1333 it was destroyed by fire.
* In 1525 it was captured by Henry the Middle, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg.
* In 1540 Heiligenstadt became the capital of Eichsfeld.
* In 1581 a Jesuit college was established, operating until 1773.
* In the Thirty Years&#x27; War of 1618–1648, the city was devastated several times.
* In 1803 it came into possession of Prussia.
* In 1929 the salt-water hydropathic baths were built and in 1950 the town was designated a spa.
* On 9 November 1938, the town synagogue was desecrated. The event is commemorated in a plaque on the building, which is now a residence.
* In October 1989, demonstrations began in Heiligenstadt as part of the Peaceful Revolution in East Germany.
* In 1994, Heiligenstadt became the capital of the new district of Eichsfeld, formed by the amalgamation of the districts of Heiligenstadt and Worbis.

===Name of the town===
Despite the official designation of the town as a spa in 1929 and a 1950 decision by the town council to append the word &quot;Soleheilbad&quot; (salt-water spa) to its name, it remained officially &quot;Heiligenstadt&quot; (literally Holy City) during the East German years. In 1990 the city government still used only Heiligenstadt.

However, the post office used Heilbad Heiligenstadt, as did postcard companies and the local savings bank. In fact between 1950 and 1990, the town had the distinction of being referred to in three different ways: as Heiligenstadt, Heilbad Heiligenstadt, or Heiligenstadt (Eichsf.) (for Eichsfeld).

In 1990, the town council and especially the mayor began expanding the spa business and it took on increasing importance. In addition, after German reunification, there were several Heiligenstadts in Germany. Initially the government declined to rename the town Heilbad Heiligenstadt because of a lack of evidence that it was a spa, but the town lodged an appeal and used the one and a half years before an official visit and the relative lack of oversight immediately after reunification to create spa facilities and integrate the word &quot;Heilbad&quot; into official usage. Permission for the renaming was then granted since the town was evidently a spa and using that name.
== Culture and sights ==

=== Theatre ===
* Eichsfeld Kulturhaus

=== Museums ===
* Theodor Storm Literary Museum
* Eichsfeld Heimatmuseum (local history collection)
* Heiligenstadt (Ost) Station Museum
* The Borderland Museum Eichsfeld is located a few miles outside the city of Heiligenstadt and deals with the inner-German border and the history of the GDR

=== Buildings and monuments ===
* Mainz Schloss, seat of the administrator for Eichsfeld when it was a dominion of the Archbishopric of Mainz
* Klausmühle (1748 &quot;Fachwerk&quot; mill on the site of the birthplace of Tilman Riemenschneider)
* &quot;Einheitsdenkmal&quot; German Unity Monument in front of the town administration building, 2009

==== Churches and chapels ====
* St. Aegidius, also known as the &quot;Neustädter Kirche&quot; (new-town church): begun in the 13th century
* St. Mary&#x27;s, also known as the &quot;Altstädter Kirche&quot; (old-town church), &quot;Liebfrauenkirche&quot; (Our Lady&#x27;s) and &quot;Propsteikirche&quot; (abbey church): a 14th-century monastic foundation which replaced a 13th-century Romanesque building
* St. Anne&#x27;s chapel, possibly built as an ossuary, facing the north portico of St. Mary&#x27;s

=== Cemeteries ===
* The Jewish cemetery in Ibergstraße was last used for burial in 1940. The deportation of six Jewish residents to Theresienstadt concentration camp in September 1942 put an end to a Jewish community in the town which was first mentioned in writing in 1212 and which had built a synagogue and their own school in the 19th century.
* The Soviet cemetery and monument in Dingelstädter Straße commemorate 70 Soviet prisoners of war and impressed workers who died in the town due to forced labour during World War II.

===Parks===
* Heinrich Heine Kurpark (spa park)

===Regular events===
Heiligenstadt, like the rest of Eichsfeld, is traditionally Roman Catholic, so there are several annual religious events, in particular the procession through the old town on Palm Sunday with life-size figures from the Passion of Christ, which attracts numerous believers from the region and the rest of Germany.

====Ibergrennen====
The Ibergrennen is an annual road race held since 1994 on the last weekend in June on Landesstraße 2022 (Holzweg) in the western foothills of the Iberg. Sponsored by the German Mountain Cup and German Mountain Championship, it has included sports and touring cars since 1998, when the road surface was renewed and the barriers reinforced. In 2000, the course was extended from 1.96 km to 2.05 km. The climb remains 200 m. It is thus one of the shortest mountain race routes in Germany, but not without challenges.

The drivers&#x27; encampment is traditionally set up near the centre of Heiligenstadt, next to a filling station and a supermarket which is open on Sundays.

The first race was held in 1925, but only for motorcycles.

<text>The National Lawyers Guild (NLG) is a progressive public interest association of lawyers, law students, paralegals, jailhouse lawyers, law collective members, and other activist legal workers, in the United States. The group was founded in 1937 as an alternative to the American Bar Association (ABA) in protest of that organization&#x27;s then exclusionary membership practices and conservative political orientation. They were the first predominantly white US bar association to allow the admission of minorities to their ranks. The group sought to bring more lawyers closer to the labor movement and progressive political activities (e.g., the Farmer–Labor Party movement), to support and encourage lawyers otherwise &quot;isolated and discouraged&quot;, and to help create a &quot;united front&quot; against fascism.

Upon its formation in 1937, the organization aimed to provide a progressive and racially integrated alternative to the ABA. Shortly thereafter, New Dealers and civil libertarians split from the organization, making it more left-wing. In its early days some of its members also belonged to the Communist Party.

The group declares itself to be &quot;dedicated to the need for basic and progressive change in the structure of our political and economic system ... to the end that human rights shall be regarded as more sacred than property interests.&quot; During the McCarthy era, Attorney General Herbert Brownell Jr. and the House Un-American Activities Committee accused the organization of operating as a communist front group.

==History==
===1930s===
On December 1, 1936, nearly 25 East Coast lawyers met at the City Club of New York to discuss creation of a new group counter to the conservative American Bar Association. United Auto Workers general counsel Maurice Sugar was instrumental in calling the meeting. Lawyers present included: Morris Ernst, Robert Silberstein and Mortimer Reimer of the Lawyers Security League, ACLU attorney Osmond Fraenkel, IJA-US founder Carol Weiss King, and union lawyer Henry Sacher. The group agreed on an aim to unite &quot;all lawyers who regarded adjustments to new conditions as more important than the veneration of precedent, who recognize the importance of safeguarding and extending the right of workers and farmers upon whom the welfare of the entire nation depends, of maintaining our civil rights and liberties and our democratic institutions&quot;. The group elected Frank P. Walsh, member of the New York State Power Authority, as its first president. 

The National Lawyers Guild was founded in Washington, D.C., at a convention held from February 19–22, 1937, at the Hotel Washington. Individuals particularly instrumental in the creation of the organization included Harold I. Cammer and George Wagman Fish, among others. Other founding members included Frank P. Walsh, Albert Wald, Morris Ernst, Jerome Frank, as well as the general counsels of the American Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations. Another co-founder was Abraham Unger of New York City. Other charter members included John McTernan and Ben Margolis of Los Angeles. Another early member was Bartley Crum, defender of the Hollywood Ten. The first Executive Secretary of the organization was Mortimer Riemer. President Franklin D. Roosevelt sent a letter of support:
I am sure that the results of this meeting will be worth while. It is a time for progressive and constructive thinking, and having known most of you intimately for many years, I have every confidence that your deliberations will affect the welfare of your own profession and the well-being of the country at large. I send to you my hearty felicitations and warm personal regards.
According to Victor Rabinowitz, head of the NLG in the 1960s, the original membership of the organization came from two camps — established liberal attorneys with a labor-oriented perspective and &quot;a militant segment of the bar, mostly young and sometimes radical&quot;. The National Lawyers Guild was the nation&#x27;s first racially integrated bar association. Among the NLG&#x27;s first causes was its support of President Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal, which was opposed by the American Bar Association (ABA). NLG assisted the emerging labor movement, and opposed the racial segregation policies in the ABA and in society in general. Following the Nazis&#x27; invasion of the Soviet Union, the Guild gave its support to President Roosevelt&#x27;s wartime policies, including that of Japanese American internment.

Before mid-March 1937, within two weeks of its founding, the NLG formed chapters in New York City, Newark, Detroit, Boston, Philadelphia, Washington, St. Louis, and Chicago.

According to historian Harvey Klehr, the NLG was allied with the Communist Party; in the 1930s a significant number of NLG founders had been members or fellow travelers of the Communist Party USA, including Riemer and Joseph Brodsky of the CP&#x27;s International Labor Defense auxiliary. During the McCarthy era, the NLG was accused by Attorney General Herbert Brownell Jr. as well as the House Un-American Activities Committee of being a Communist front organization.

In 1937, Allan R. Rosenberg joined the NLG and remained a member as late as 1956 during his second appearance before HUAC.

In 1937, Ferdinand Pecora was a founding member of the NLG. On March 1, 1938, Pecora become NLG president, noted as a &quot;forceful speaker&quot;. Pecora resigned from the NLG during its third annual convention in 1939 after the vote against his resolution disavowing Communists failed to carry in the national vote.

By 1939, Assistant Secretary of State Adolf A. Berle was a Guild member. According to the NLG&#x27;s &quot;A History of the National Lawyers Guild 1937–1987&quot;, two factions arose as early as 1940. External events driving these factions included the Spanish Civil War (started 1936), the Hitler-Stalin Pact (1939), and the Russian invasion of Finland (1940). One faction, led by Berle and Ernst, supported New Deal policies. The other, led by Osmond Fraenkel and Thomas I. Emerson, supported freedom of speech and press as well as Anti-Fascism (seen at the time as a Popular Front stance, thus pro-Communist). Other issues supported by Fraenkel, Emerson, the National Executive Board and many chapters included: support for Loyalist Spain, criticism of J. Edgar Hoover and the FBI, and support for labor unions. Berle and Ernst recommended anti-Communist oaths, which Fraenkel and Emerson opposed. Many Berle and Ernst supporters left the NLG by 1940. During the NLG&#x27;s 1940 convention, newly elected president Robert W. Kenny of California and secretary Martin Popper of New York sought to persuade members to return. During a phone call from Kenny, Berle gave him a short list of lawyers to leave as a simple matter of &quot;cleaning house&quot;: Kenny rejected the request. David Scribner, civil rights and labor lawyer, was a member of both the IJA and the NLG.

===1940s===
Federal Bureau of Investigation director J. Edgar Hoover repeatedly tried to get successive Attorneys General to declare the NLG a &quot;subversive organization&quot;, but without success.

In 1944 the Special House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) chaired by Texas Congressman Martin Dies Jr. published a brief history of the NLG in its massive and controversial &quot;Appendix — Part IX&quot; cataloging so-called &quot;Communist Front Organizations&quot; and their supporters. This report charged that the NLG, despite being promoted as a &quot;professional organization of liberal lawyers&quot; had proven itself by its actions to be &quot;just one more highly deceptive Communist-operated front organization, primarily intended to serve the interests of the Communist Party of the United States...&quot;

The 1944 HUAC history asserted that the NLG was merely &quot;a streamlined edition of the International Juridical Organization&quot;, a Communist Party mass organization established in 1931. The document charged that &quot;the National Lawyers Guild has faithfully followed the line of the Communist Party on numerous issues and has proven itself an important bulwark in defense of that party, its members, and organizations under its control.&quot; Particularly damning in HUAC&#x27;s eyes was the NLG&#x27;s reversal of position on the war in Europe after the June 22, 1941 invasion of the Soviet Union by the forces of Nazi Germany, with an October resolution by the previously anti-war organization offering &quot;unlimited support to all measures necessary to the defeat of Hitlerism&quot; and supporting the Roosevelt administration&#x27;s policy of &quot;&#x27;all out aid&#x27; and full collaboration with Great Britain, the Soviet Union, China, and other nations resisting Fascist aggression.&quot;

===1950s===

In January 1950, the NLG published a report for US President Harry S. Truman that accused the FBI of &quot;systematic search by illegal methods&quot; into the politics of thousands of private citizens, reported the &quot;Washington Post&quot;. The report focused on FBI methods used against Soviet spy Judith Coplon. The report recommended that the President stop such practices. It also recommended that the President appoint a committee of private citizens to investigate the FBI. Contributors to the report were NLG president Clifford J. Durr, Frederick K. Beutel, Thomas I. Emerson, O. John Rogge, James A. Cobb, Joseph Forer, and Robert J. Silberstein.

On September 21, 1950, HUAC responded with &quot;Report on the National Lawyers Guild: Legal Bulwark of the Communist Party&quot;. The HUAC report accused the NLG of playing a part in &quot;an overall Communist strategy aimed at weakening our nation&#x27;s defenses against the international Communist conspiracy.&quot; The report advocated that Guild members be barred from federal employment in light of the organization&#x27;s alleged subversive character.

From 1951 to 1954, Earl B. Dickerson served as the first black president of the National Lawyers Guild. Dickerson was instrumental in contesting the proposed classification of the National Lawyers Guild as a &quot;subversive organization&quot;.

In 1954, the NLG New York chapter elected Frank Serri as president. Other officers included: Hubert T. Delany, Osmond K. Fraenkel, Leo J. Linder, Harold M. Phillips, David L. Weissman, Julius Cohen, and Simon Schachter. Directors included: Bella Abzug, Gloria Agrin, Michael B. Atkins, Benjamin H. Booth, Edward J. Cambridge, Harold Cammer, William B. Cherevas, George H. Cohen, Frank Donner, Issac C. Donner, Stanley Faulkner, Royal W. France, Nathan Frankel, Doris Peterson Galen, Murray Gordon, Charles Haydon, Lazaar Henkin, Bernard L. Jaffe, H. Leonard King, Rhoda Lakes, Mendel Lurie, Edward J. Malament, Stanley J. Mayer, Basil Pollitt, Samuel Rosenberg, Arnold E. Rosenblum, Barney Rosenstein, Simon Rosenstein, Mildred Roth, Harry Sacher, Arthur Schutzer, Elias M. Schwarzbart, Moses B. Sherr, Kenneth L. Shorter, Leonard P. Simpson, Lorna Rissler Wallach, and Henry R. Wolf.

In 1958, the US Government determined that the NLG could not be declared subversive.

===1970s–1990s===

Again in 1974, the US Government determined that the NLG could not be declared subversive.

Lawyers from the NLG were the biggest source of funding of the Weather Underground, a far left militant group.

In 1977, at the request of Arab-American lawyers, the NLG sent a delegation to the occupied Palestinian Territories and published its findings in a 1978 report: &quot;Treatment of Palestinians in Israeli-Occupied West Bank and Gaza&quot;.

In 1989 the FBI admitted its continued efforts to investigate and disrupt the NLG in the period from 1940 to 1975.

===2000s===

In the 2000s, the NLG opposed the PATRIOT Act, corporate globalization, the World Trade Organization, and has called for the adoption of &quot;the Plan of Action from the 2001 UN World Conference Against Racism, Xenophobia, and Related Intolerance.&quot; The NLG has also helped to train and provide legal observers for political demonstrations. The NLG has supported Palestinian rights and a number of other causes.

In 2005, NLG member Lynne Stewart was found guilty of violating Special Administrative Measures imposed on her client Omar Abdel Rahman and was sentenced in 2010 to 10 years in prison. The NLG mounted a campaign on her behalf.

In November 2007, the NLG passed a resolution calling for the impeachment of then President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney.

In 2011, the NLG defended the Occupy movement in the United States, making use of temporary restraining orders on behalf of encamped activists in an effort to forestall the forced dispersal of their sites by law enforcement. Charging that the Occupy movement was the subject of a &quot;coordinated national crackdown&quot;, NLG lawyers filed actions in Boston, New York City, San Diego, Fort Myers, Atlanta, and other cities seeking the temporary prohibition of site removal efforts.

Commenting on the contested 2024 Venezuelan presidential election, the NLG&#x27;s president, Suzanne Adely, said the elections &quot;were not only fair and transparent but also represented an example of popular civic participation. Their successful outcome is a triumph for the Venezuelan people, especially considering the level of U.S. interference and attempted sabotage of the democratic process, particularly through sanctions and coercive economic measures aimed at producing &#x27;regime change&#x27; in Venezuela&quot;.

==Structure==

Past Guild presidents have included Dobby Walker (the first female President of the NLG, first serving in 1970 and member of the 1972 &quot;Dream Team&quot; that successfully defended Angela Davis using innovative litigation techniques that are now mainstream), Marjorie Cohn (a law professor at Thomas Jefferson School of Law and author), and Azadeh Shahshahani (the first woman of color to be President of the NLG and a human rights attorney who defends the rights of immigrants and Muslims in the United States South). Heidi Boghosian served as its Executive Director for 15 years, from 1999 to 2014. Pooja Gehi is the current Executive Director.

Full membership in the NLG is open to lawyers, law students, legal workers (including legal secretaries, legal investigators, paralegals, law collective members, and jailhouse lawyers). Prior to the 1972 NLG National Convention, held in Boulder, Colorado, membership was only open to lawyers. Members now include labor organizers, tribal sovereignty activists, civil liberties advocates, civil rights advocates, environmentalists, and G.I. rights counselors.

The NLG is affiliated with the International Association of Democratic Lawyers. It has supported the Stolen Lives Project, which documents police brutality.

===Funding===

The NLG is a dues-paying membership organization, with income-based sliding scale rates ranging from $25 to $800 per annum used in 2020.

===Publications===

The first journal of the NLG was the &quot;National Lawyers Guild Quarterly,&quot; first issued in December 1937 and then terminated in July 1940. This was succeeded in October 1940 by a new quarterly called &quot;Lawyers Guild Review,&quot; which was published continuously through the year 1960. The publication&#x27;s editorial office was moved to Los Angeles and its name was briefly changed from 1961 through 1964 to &quot;Law in Transition,&quot; followed by a change in 1965 to &quot;Guild Practitioner.&quot; In 2009, the journal once again changed name to &quot;National Lawyers Guild Review&quot;, shortening to &quot;NLG Review&quot;. With the Center for Constitutional Rights, the NLG published a revised &quot;Jailhouse Lawyers Handbook&quot;, and annually distributes thousands of copies to inmates seeking legal information and resources.

<text>City of Palms Park is a baseball stadium in Fort Myers, Florida. It served as the spring training home of the Boston Red Sox of Major League Baseball (MLB) from its opening in 1993 to 2011. It has hosted college baseball games for Florida SouthWestern State College since 2014. The stadium&#x27;s name is taken from the city&#x27;s official nickname.

==History==

City of Palms Park was built in 1992 to be the spring training home of the Boston Red Sox. It has a seating capacity of 8,000 people. It was also the home of the Red Sox&#x27; Rookie-level team in Minor League Baseball, the Gulf Coast League Red Sox, who played a season lasting from June through August each year.

===Player Development Complex===
The Player Development Complex is where the Red Sox trained and practiced before the exhibition season began at City of Palms. It also housed all the Minor League Baseball affiliates and coaches the entire month of March, and it is where players were reassigned as they trimmed the roster down during spring training. Once spring training ended, extended spring training ran from April through the beginning of the Gulf Coast League season. Instructional league took place there from September to October.

This complex includes five baseball fields with bullpens and eight batting tunnels. The clubhouse includes a meeting room, conference room, kitchen, six offices, a players locker room with showers, a trainer/therapy room, a hydrotherapy room, laundry room, an umpire locker room, coaches locker room, and an expanded weight training room that was added in 2004–05.

===Red Sox departure===
The Red Sox had a lease with Fort Myers for City of Palms Park through 2019, however, team ownership had been considering exercising an early exit in their contract, allowing them to leave following 2009 spring training. On October 28, 2008, the Lee County commission voted 3–1 to approve an agreement with the Boston Red Sox to build a new spring training facility for the team in south Lee County. That new facility became known as &quot;JetBlue Park&quot;, and in February 2012, the Boston Red Sox moved their spring training operations into the newly constructed JetBlue Park at Fenway South located on County Road 876 (Daniels Parkway) in Fort Myers.

===Post-Red Sox usage===
Lee County has owned the stadium since 2003, when the City of Fort Myers transferred ownership due to the cost of upkeep. Since 2014, the stadium has been used by the baseball team of Florida SouthWestern State College, and it is also used for some amateur baseball games. The City of Fort Myers occasionally uses the venue for concerts.

In addition to City of Palms Park and JetBlue Park, there are two other spring training facilities in Fort Myers. The Minnesota Twins train in Hammond Stadium on the southern end of Fort Myers. Terry Park Ballfield (also known as the Park T. Pigott Memorial Stadium) in East Fort Myers is the former spring training home of the Philadelphia Athletics, Cleveland Indians, Pittsburgh Pirates and Kansas City Royals. Terry Park has not been used for spring training since 1987.

===Possible demolition===
The cost to maintain the ballpark each year is $500,000, yet the facility only creates $32,000 in revenue annually. In the fall of 2019, Lee County officials received a request from the City of Fort Myers to demolish the stadium, so the land could be given back to the city for use in a redevelopment project.

<text>Heinz 57 is a steak sauce. Its name comes from the historical advertising slogan &quot;57 Varieties&quot; by the H. J. Heinz Company located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States. It was developed as part of a marketing campaign that told consumers about the numerous products available from the Heinz company.

==History==

Henry J. Heinz introduced the marketing slogan &quot;57 pickle Varieties&quot; in 1896. He later claimed he was inspired by an advertisement he saw while riding an elevated train in New York City (a shoe store boasting &quot;21 styles&quot;). The reason for &quot;57&quot; is unclear. Heinz said he chose &quot;5&quot; because it was his lucky number and the number &quot;7&quot; was his wife&#x27;s lucky number. However, Heinz also said the number &quot;7&quot; was selected specifically because of the &quot;psychological influence of that figure and of its enduring significance to people of all ages&quot;. Whatever the reasons, Heinz wanted the company to advertise the greatest number of choices of pickles. In fact by 1892, four years before the slogan was created, the Heinz company was already selling more than 60 products.

The first product to be promoted under the new &quot;57 varieties&quot; slogan was prepared horseradish. By 1940, the term &quot;Heinz 57&quot; had become so synonymous with the company the name was used to market a steak sauce. Prior to that Heinz sold a “Beefsteak Sauce“ of unknown composition. 

==Description==
Heinz 57 Sauce has what amounts to a ketchup base, fortified with malt vinegar and seasoned with mustard, raisin, apple, garlic, onion, and other flavors. 

Its ingredient list includes tomato purée (water, tomato paste), high fructose corn syrup, distilled white vinegar, malt vinegar (contains barley), salt, less than 2% of modified food starch, raisin juice concentrate, mustard flour, soybean oil, turmeric, spices, apple purée, sodium benzoate and potassium sorbate (preservatives), caramel color, garlic powder, onion powder, and natural flavors.

==In popular culture==
In bingo in the United Kingdom, a commonly used call for &quot;57&quot; is &quot;Heinz variety&quot;.

In draw poker, &quot;Heinz 57&quot; is a variant where 5s and 7s are wild cards.

A mongrel dog with more than two distinct breeds in its bloodline may be referred to as a &quot;Heinz 57&quot; 

In UK betting terminology, a &#x27;Heinz&#x27; refers to a full-cover bet of doubles and upwards, consisting of six selections. It is known as a Heinz because there are 57 multiples (15 doubles, 20 trebles, 15 fourfolds, 6 fivefolds and 1 sixfold) within the bet.

The Heinz 57 is also a nickname for British Rail Class 57 locomotives.

When Pittsburgh-based Heinz purchased the naming rights of Heinz Field in 2001, they signed a deal to pay the Pittsburgh Steelers $57 million until 2021.

Former NHL player Steve Heinze requested to wear #57 when he was drafted by the Boston Bruins. However, the Bruins general manager Harry Sinden denied his request, stating that only captain Ray Bourque (#77) could wear an unorthodox number. Instead, Heinze wore #23 in Boston. He was granted #57 when he joined the Columbus Blue Jackets and he wore it for the remainder of his NHL career.

The leaves are bipinnate or tripinnate, with a feathery appearance, and green to strongly glaucous blue-green in colour. The flowers are yellow, with 4–5 petals, about 1 cm diameter, and borne in cymes. The fruit is a 4–5-lobed capsule, containing numerous seeds.

==Species==
, Plants of the World Online accepted ten species:
*&quot;Ruta angustifolia&quot; 
*&quot;Ruta chalepensis&quot; 
*&quot;Ruta corsica&quot; 
*&quot;Ruta graveolens&quot; 
*&quot;Ruta lamarmorae&quot; 
*&quot;Ruta lindsayi&quot; 
*&quot;Ruta microcarpa&quot; 
*&quot;Ruta montana&quot; 
*&quot;Ruta oreojasme&quot; 
*&quot;Ruta pinnata&quot; 

==Medicinal uses==

Extracts from rue have been used to treat eyestrain, sore eyes, and as insect repellent. Rue has been used internally as an antispasmodic, as a treatment for menstrual problems, as an abortifacient, and as a sedative.
&quot;Ruta graveolens&quot; and &quot;Ruta chalepensis&quot; are often confused in scientific literature.

==Traditional uses==
Since medieval times, rue has been used as an additive to wines (both white and red) to enhance its flavour and its keeping properties. The Dutch name &quot;wijnruit&quot;, translates as wine rue. In Italy, rue is added to grappa to produce Grappa alla Ruta. Rue&#x27;s toxicity has long been known but since it appears to be slight it has been used as an additive in wine for a long time.

In Brazil, according to folk tradition said to have been brought by West African slaves, the rue plant – locally called &quot;arruda,&quot; in Portuguese – is claimed to protect against the evil eye.

Traditionally, it has various health benefits including, digestive aid as it helps in stimulating digestion and alleviating stomach issues. Its anti-inflammatory properties help in curing joints pain and arthritis. It is used to regulate menstrual cycle and helps in relieve menstrual cramps. It also helps in reducing muscle spasms and cramps.

==Precautions==
Caution should be taken with using rue topically. Applied to the skin with sun exposure, the oil and leaves can cause blistering. Some people are much more sensitive than others. Exposure to common rue, or herbal preparations derived from it, can cause severe phytophotodermatitis, which results in burn-like blisters on the skin. The mechanism of action is currently unknown.

<text>Charles David Kelman (May 23, 1930June 1, 2004) was an American ophthalmologist, surgeon, inventor, jazz musician, entertainer, and Broadway producer. Known as the father of phacoemulsification, he developed many of the medical devices, instruments, implant lenses and techniques used in cataract surgery. In the early 1960s, he began the use of cryosurgery to remove cataracts and repair retinal detachments. Cryosurgery for cataracts remained in heavy use until 1978, when phacoemulsification, a procedure Kelman also developed in 1967, became the modern standard treatment. Kelman was given the National Medal of Technology by President George H. W. Bush and recognized as the Ophthalmologist of the Century by the International Congress of Cataract and Refractive Surgery in Montreal, Canada. He was also inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in Akron, Ohio, and received the 2004 Lasker Award.

Born in New York, Kelman graduated from Tufts University and earned his medical degree from University of Geneva before returning to New York to intern at Kings County Hospital and complete his residency at Wills Eye Hospital in Philadelphia. He was later an attending surgeon at the Manhattan Eye, Ear &amp; Throat Hospital and the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary, and maintained a private practice. Kelman served as clinical professor of ophthalmology at New York Medical College and individually taught his techniques to many surgeons around the world.

Kelman pursued a career as an entertainer alongside his medical career. He began playing the harmonica at a young age and performed on a radio show, &quot;The Horn and Hardart Children&#x27;s Hour&quot;. He later learned to play the clarinet and saxophone. As a teenager, he formed a big band, began composing music, and played in his high school band and as first clarinet on the New York All-City Orchestra. While in medical school in Geneva, he appeared on two jazz radio shows and one on television. After returning to New York, he recorded a song, &quot;Telephone Numbers&quot;, released by Chancellor Records to some success in national billboard charts. After inventing phacoemulsification, in part to promote the procedure, he began appearing regularly on television, first on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; in 1975. He developed a musical comedy routine which he performed on television as well as in Atlantic City, Las Vegas, and Carnegie Hall in New York, alongside several notable jazz musicians and entertainers. He co-produced several Broadway musicals and wrote at least two off-Broadway musicals.

== Early life and education ==
Charles David Kelman was born on May 23, 1930, in Brooklyn, New York, to Eva and David Kelman. He grew up in East New York before the family moved to Forest Hills, Queens. His father was a Jewish immigrant from Greece who never received the proper compensation and recognition for his inventions, including the first tar-free cigarettes and cellophane Christmas wreaths. He inspired his son&#x27;s desire to proudly seek recognition of his own inventions.

Charles began playing music at four years old, when he learned to play his first instrument, the harmonica. He began playing regularly for &quot;The Horn and Hardart Children&#x27;s Hour&quot; radio show. Kelman also learned to play the saxophone and clarinet, receiving professional training from musicians in the big band era. While attending Forest Hills High School, he played in the high school band and as the first clarinet of the New York All-City Orchestra.

He dreamed of stardom in music, however, he said that, when he was 17 years old, his father told him to bring his saxophone to the basement of their house and play for him. Charles played a song by Jimmy Dorsey after which his father asked if he had played as well as Dorsey. When Charles admitted he had not, his father announced: &quot;You&#x27;ll be a doctor.&quot;

Kelman attended Boston&#x27;s Tufts University and graduated in just two years to earn a B.S. degree in 1950. He then studied medicine at the University of Geneva and, after learning that his father was diagnosed with cancer, accelerated his studies with the hope of having his father see him becoming a doctor. He obtained his M.D. degree in 1956, but not before his father&#x27;s death the year before. After interning at Kings County Hospital, he did his residency at Wills Eye Hospital in Philadelphia.

== Career ==

=== As an ophthalmologist and surgeon ===
In 1960, Kelman started an ophthalmology private practice and began to experiment with the use of cryosurgery. His first invention in 1962 was the cryoprobe which he used to freeze a cataractous lens before removal in intracapsular cataract extraction (ICCE), which removed the lens with the capsule intact. While the technique has not been in heavy use since 1978 and the advent of other techniques such as extracapsular cataract surgery (ECCE) which Kelman helped develop, ICCE remains a viable surgical option. In 1963, Kelman then developed the use of cryopexy to treat retinal detachment.

In 1964, he applied for a research grant from the John A. Hartford Foundation to further investigate freezing techniques in eye surgery and, in an addendum to the application, proposed &quot;a method for removing a cataract through an incision small enough so that no hospitalization will be required.&quot; He received a three-year grant from the foundation. The idea for his next invention came to Kelman after seeing an ultrasonic device at his dentist&#x27;s office. Kelman envisioned using a similar device that vibrates to break up a cataractous lens and remove it without a large incision.

Kelman named the procedure phacoemulsification, a technique that has become standard treatment for cataracts. With medical instrument manufacturer Cavitron (which was later acquired by Coopervision), he devised an ultrasonic surgical instrument with an aspiration and irrigation system. He began testing the procedure on animals in April 1966. In 1967, Kelman secretly conducted his first surgery on a blind patient, awaiting enucleation, who volunteered knowing that the procedure would not bring back his vision. His first patient&#x27;s eye became infected and was removed. However, he was successful on subsequent attempts. He had made further improvements on the instrument, increasing the vibration speed from 20,000 cycles per second to 40,000 cycles per second and creating a smaller hand instrument. On July 25, 1967, Kelman and his co-inventor Anton Banko filed a patent application to register a phacoemulsification device for cataract surgery. Kelman began a novel business relationship with the manufacturer to produce the device.

After publishing &quot;Phaco-emulsification and Aspiration—A New Technique for Cataract Removal: A Preliminary Report&quot; in the &quot;American Journal of Ophthalmology&quot;, he began teaching courses to surgeons interested in learning this new technique. One of his students was Eric Arnott, a British ophthalmologist who introduced the procedure to the UK. Kelman&#x27;s developments allowed the incision necessary for ECCE to be reduced from to and minimized recovery time. This new surgery method removed the need for an extended hospital stay and made the surgery less painful. The technique and similar tools have also been adopted and used in neurosurgery to remove tumors from the brain and spinal cord, and subsequently ushered a trend of minimally-invasive outpatient surgical procedures.

Phacoemulsification initially faced significant criticism and skepticism in the 1970s. The National Eye Institute labeled the procedure as experimental, allowing insurance companies not to cover the procedure. Kelman&#x27;s critics said the procedure was &quot;ridiculous&quot; or &quot;malpractice&quot;. At 1973 Welsh Cataract Symposium, surgeons presented results of negative outcomes from the procedure with actual patients paraded as evidence. In 1974, the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) sponsored a comparative study of phacoemulsification, which found that the procedure was as effective as ICCE. Kelman decided to promote the procedure to the general public and, on February 21, 1975, appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; with Johnny Carson. The first International Congress on Phacoemulsification and Cataract Methodology sponsored by Foundation for Ophthalmic Education was held the same year and the procedure began to gain wider acceptance.

While many ophthalmologists accepted phacoemulsification and the small incision required as the best method for removing cataracts, they still needed to widen the incision to to insert a replacement artificial intraocular lens (IOL). While Kelman in 1975 began developing IOL that could fit in smaller incisions, this issue was only overcome when Thomas R. Mazzocco invented the silicone IOL in the early 1980s. What became known as the &quot;Mazzocco taco&quot; could be folded and inserted in the same small incision used for phacoemulsification. When the foldable IOL was approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration in 1984, the clear advantage of Kelman&#x27;s phacoemulsification was fully realized. That same year, the Kelman Satellite Teleconference was presented at the annual AAO conference, allowing the more than 400 in attendance to observe a live broadcast of Kelman performing five procedures.

Kelman treated many celebrities including Joe Frazier, Lionel Hampton, Rex Harrison, Ann Miller, Jan Peerce, and William B. Williams. Hedy Lamarr, who Kelman treated in October 1980, said &quot;I was blind for more than seven years. But I&#x27;m fine now. Dr. Kelman gave me my sight back. He gave me my eyes.&quot; In 1992, &quot;The New York Times&quot; estimated that Kelman&#x27;s innovation &quot;shaved $7 billion a year from the nation&#x27;s hospital bill.&quot; At various times in his career, Kelman served as clinical professor of ophthalmology at New York Medical College and as an attending surgeon at the Manhattan Eye, Ear &amp; Throat Hospital and the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary. He published numerous articles, papers, and scientific book chapters, as well as a lay book, &quot;Cataracts: What You Must Know About Them&quot;, published by Crown Publishers in 1982. Later in his career, he invented a way to create collagen from a patient&#x27;s skin to avoid allergic reactions. He continued to practice medicine, perform surgery, and teach alongside his career as an entertainer. Kelman held more than 100 patents for his instruments and innovations, and became known as the father of phacoemulsification. Cataract surgery with phacoemulsification is one of the most common surgeries in the world with more than 9.5 million such procedures performed each year around the world as of 2011.

=== As an entertainer ===
Kelman began composing music in high school and started a big band as a teenager. He continued his musical pursuits throughout his college education. While attending medical school in Geneva, he regularly performed on two jazz radio shows and another on television. He co-wrote &quot;Le Petit Déjeuner (Paroles et Musique de François Charpin et Charles Kelman)&quot; which was later recorded by the French singer Jean Sablon.

Using the stage name Kerry Adams, he recorded &quot;Telephone Numbers&quot;, which was released by Chancellor Records to some success in national billboard charts in 1960. The song&#x27;s success was cut short by the craze created by &quot;The Twist&quot; that would change the pop music genre. After this, Kelman believed his singing career had come to an end and began to focus on his medical career.

Just as his medical practice flourished, Kelman&#x27;s celebrity grew after appearing on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; in 1975, where he sang a song about a blind girl and promoted his surgical innovations. He continued to appear regularly on television shows hosted by Merv Griffin, Barbara Walters, Oprah Winfrey and David Letterman. As well as singing and playing the saxophone, he developed a musical comedy routine which he also performed in Atlantic City and Las Vegas, opening for or performing alongside the Spinners, Glen Campbell, James Darren, Dizzy Gillespie, Lionel Hampton and Regis Philbin. He also rented out Carnegie Hall for several benefit concerts in the mid-1970s.

Kelman co-produced several musicals on Broadway, including &quot;Can-Can&quot; (1981), &quot;Triumph of Love&quot; (1997), and &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; (1998–1999), and was a member of the Friars Club in New York. He recorded an album, &quot;Moonlight Serenade&quot;, released in 1992 by Columbia Records. &quot;The Marrano&quot;, a musical he wrote based on a premise that the Italian explorer Christopher Columbus was Jewish, also previewed in Cape Cod in 1992. His latest musical, &quot;The Right Pair of Shoes&quot;, was due to premiere in 2004 at the Caldwell Theatre in Boca Raton, Florida.

== Awards and honors ==

In 1970, Kelman was awarded by the American Academy of Achievement. In 1982, he was a recipient of the Congressional Salute in the U.S. Senate, 97th Congress, in Washington, D.C. In 1985, Kelman presented the first American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (ASCRS) Innovator&#x27;s Lecture. The lecture series was named in his honor in 2003. He also delivered the ASCRS&#x27;s Binkhorst Lecture in 1989, the Ridley Medal Lecture at the International Congress of Ophthalmology in 1990, and the Arthur J. Bedell Memorial Lecture at Wills Eye Hospital in 1991.

In June 1992, Kelman was awarded the National Medal of Technology from President George H. W. Bush. The same year, he had received the Distinguished Service Award from Tufts University and the Inventor of the Year Award from the New York Patent, Trademark and Copyright Law Association. At the July 1994 International Congress of Cataract and Refractive Surgery in Montreal, Canada, he was recognized as the Ophthalmologist of the Century.

In 1999, Kelman was selected as one of the ten most influential ophthalmologists of the 20th century by the ASCRS and became president of the society. The following year, he received a Doctor of Letters from Thomas Jefferson University&#x27;s Wills Eye Hospital Retina Service and the hospital also named its research facility the Charles D. Kelman Laboratory and Library. In 2003, Kelman received the Laureate Recognition Award from the AAO and the annual AAO Charles D. Kelman Lecture was established in 2005. In February 2004, he was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in Akron, Ohio. He was also awarded the 2004 Lasker Award, with the jury making an exception to the rules to allow the award to be given posthumously.

In January 2010, the New York public television station WLIW aired a documentary titled &quot;Through My Eyes: The Charlie Kelman Story&quot;; his autobiography published in 1985 was also titled &quot;Through My Eyes&quot;.

== Personal life and death ==
Kelman was an avid golfer and learned to fly a helicopter later in life. He and his first wife Joan Kelman (later Bernstein) had three children: David Joseph (who died in 2003), Lesley, and Jennifer. With his second wife Ann, he had three sons: Evan, Jason, and Seth. In 1996, Kelman moved to Boca Raton, where he died of lung cancer on June 1, 2004, at the age of 74.

<text>Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus (known as Sly Raccoon in PAL regions) is a stealth platform video game developed by Sucker Punch Productions and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation 2. It is the first installment in the &quot;Sly Cooper&quot; series. The game follows the titular Sly Cooper and his gang, Bentley the Turtle and Murray the Hippo, on their mission to recover the lost pages of the &quot;Thievius Raccoonus&quot; (a book listing every thieving technique created by Sly&#x27;s ancestors) from a rival gang known as the Fiendish Five.

&quot;Sly Cooper&quot; was praised for its technical achievements—particularly its use of a variation on cel-shading to create a film noir feel while still rendering as a hand-drawn animated film—and criticized for being too short. The game was followed by three sequels: &quot;Sly 2: Band of Thieves&quot; (2004), &quot;Sly 3: Honor Among Thieves&quot; (2005), and &quot;Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time&quot; (2013). The first three games were remastered and released as &quot;The Sly Collection&quot; for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita on April 16, 2014. &quot;Sly Cooper&quot; was digitally re-released on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 on June 11, 2024.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Sly Cooper&quot; is a third person platformer with stealth elements. An &quot;Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine&quot; retrospective describes the gameplay as &quot;mix[ing] one-hit-kill arcade action with &quot;Splinter Cell&quot; sneaking&quot;. The player controls Sly Cooper as he moves between each uniquely themed lair of the Fiendish Five and the sub-sections of those lairs, avoiding security systems and patrolling guards. Sly uses his cane, a family heirloom, to attack enemies, and he can be defeated with a single hit. The player is encouraged to perform stealth maneuvers and use the environment to evade or silently neutralize threats.

To assist in these stealth moves, the environment contains special areas colored with blue sparkles of light, identified in the game as Sly&#x27;s thief senses. The player can trigger context-sensitive actions in these areas, such as shimmying along a narrow ledge or wall, landing on a pointed object such as an antenna or streetlight, climbing along the length of a narrow pole or pipe, or using the cane to grapple onto something. The player must avoid detection by security systems and enemies, otherwise, an alarm will sound and the player will either have to destroy the alarm, avoid or defeat foes alerted by the alarm or hide for several seconds until the alarm resets. The game uses a dynamic music system that changes depending on the state of alarm in the area: the music will increase in volume and pacing when Sly attacks or is detected, and then will quiet down as the disturbance goes away.

Each sub-section of a lair contains a number of clue bottles that, when collected, allow Sly to access a safe in the level that contains a page from the Thievius Raccoonus. These pages grant Sly new moves to aid in movement, stealth, or combat, such as creating a decoy or dropping an explosive hat. Defeating each of the bosses also gives Sly moves, and these abilities are typically necessary to pass later levels. Coins are scattered about the levels and are also generated by defeating enemies or destroying objects. For every 100 coins collected, Sly gains a lucky horseshoe that is the color blue and when you have two horseshoes, it turns to gold. It will allow him to take extra hits, or if he currently has one, an extra life. If Sly collapses and loses a life, the current sub-level will be restarted or at a special &quot;repeater&quot; that acts as a checkpoint; if the player loses all of Sly&#x27;s lives, they must restart that boss&#x27;s lair from the beginning. Besides the regular gameplay, there are mini-games that include driving levels (based on Murray), shooting levels to protect Murray as he ascends certain levels, and a cyber-tank game representing a hacking attempt by Bentley. One notable boss battle includes a rhythm-based sequence similar to &quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot;.

Levels can be returned at any time to gain additional coins or to seek out special moves. When a level is completed, all of the clue bottles are collected and the secret move is found, the player can then attempt a &quot;Master Sprint&quot;, a timed sprint through the level to try to beat a set time. The player can unlock additional artistic content by completing all the levels in this fashion. For each level that has the &quot;Master Sprint&quot; completed, a developer&#x27;s commentary for that level is unlocked.

==Plot== 
Sly Cooper is an anthropomorphic raccoon and the last member of the Cooper Clan, a long line of master thieves who primarily steal from other criminals. On his 8th birthday, Sly was to inherit an ancient book known as the &quot;Thievius Raccoonus&quot;, which contains his family&#x27;s secrets, to help him become a master thief. However, a group of criminals known as the &quot;Fiendish Five&quot; invaded his home and murdered Sly&#x27;s father, then stole pages out from the &quot;Thievius Raccoonus&quot; before spreading across the world to forge their own criminal empires. Sly is raised in an orphanage, where he forms a gang with two boys who become his lifelong best friends and partners in crime: Bentley, a turtle technician, who plays the role of the brains of the gang, and Murray, a hippopotamus who acts as their getaway driver. The three leave the orphanage together at age sixteen to start their lives as international vigilante criminals, naming themselves the &quot;Cooper Gang.&quot; Sly swears to avenge his family by tracking down the Fiendish Five and recovering the pages of the &quot;Thievius Raccoonus&quot;.

Two years later, the Cooper Gang infiltrates Interpol headquarters in Paris, France to steal a secret police file containing information about the Fiendish Five. During the heist, they are ambushed by Inspector Carmelita Fox, an Interpol officer with a vendetta against the Cooper Gang. The gang manages to steal the police file and successfully escapes in the getaway van. They use the files to track the Fiendish Five to their respective hideouts around the globe. The Fiendish Five comprises Sir Raleigh, a frog pirate in Wales who built a storm machine to sink ships and steal their treasure; Muggshot, an American bulldog gangster in Utah who took over a city to build a gambling empire; Mz. Ruby, an alligator mystic in Haiti raising an undead army; and the Panda King, a giant panda explosives expert in China using fireworks to extort and destroy villages. Sly defeats each member of The Fiendish Five and takes back their pages of the &quot;Thievius Raccoonus&quot;, then leaves them for Carmelita to arrest. Each Fiendish Five member reveals the location of the next one, up to their leader, an elusive mechanical owl named Clockwerk.

The Cooper Gang breaches Clockwerk&#x27;s lair in a Russian volcano to discover that he has captured Carmelita. Sly rescues Carmelita, and they agree to a temporary truce to defeat Clockwerk. During their battle, Clockwerk reveals to Sly that he is himself a master thief; bitter and jealous of the Cooper Clan for eclipsing him with their superior talents, and in retaliation, he converted himself into a machine to gain immortality. Clockwerk explains that he killed Sly&#x27;s father and stole the &quot;Thievius Raccoonus&quot; in an effort to prove that the Cooper Clan was nothing without the book; Sly counters by saying that it took great thieves to create the book, rather than the other way around.

After Clockwerk is defeated, Carmelita ends the truce by attempting to arrest Sly, but she agrees to give him a ten-second head start. Instead of running, Sly kisses her at the last second, then runs off with the gang. Carmelita is initially smitten, then realizes Sly has handcuffed her to a rail and swears to hunt him down. Sly, Bentley, and Murray return to their hideout and continue pulling off heists with the fully recovered &quot;Thievius Raccoonus&quot;. After the credits, one of Clockwerk&#x27;s eyes flashes open.

==Development and release==
&quot;Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus&quot; was the second game developed by Sucker Punch Productions, following &quot;&quot; (1999) for the Nintendo 64. &quot;Sly Cooper&quot; was conceived shortly after Rocket was completed, and was in development for three years.

Sucker Punch used Autodesk Maya to develop the art assets. Brian Flemming of Sucker Punch called the rendering style &quot;toon-shading&quot;, comparing the detailed backgrounds with cel-shading foregrounds to that of animated films. Sucker Punch wanted Sly and his world to look illustrated, and &quot;one step away from a flattened graphic style.&quot; To prevent slowdowns with framerates, the team &quot;had at least one engineer working on nothing but performance for the entire development of Sly.&quot; The game art team &quot;collected hundreds of photos and drawings of areas that looked like the worlds [they] wanted to create&quot; to generate the backgrounds. The characters themselves underwent up to &quot;six or eight major revisions&quot; before the designs were finalized.

The music was composed by Ashif Hakik. The music was inspired by the artwork from the game, with Hakik stating, &quot;stylistic influences came from a combination of instrument choices and musical character defined and inspired by the locales in the game, and similar composer works like Yoko Kanno and her work on &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot;, Henry Mancini, and Carl Stalling.&quot; He noted that &quot;the interactive music engine we used made us consider the gameplay for each specific level a sort of starting point that would influence the way the music would be written.&quot;

&quot;Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus&quot; was released in North America on September 24, 2002. It was subsequently released as &quot;Sly Raccoon&quot; in Australia and Europe on January 16, 2003 and January 17, 2003, respectively.

The game was remastered alongside its initial two sequels and compiled as &quot;The Sly Collection&quot; for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita on April 16, 2014. The original PlayStation 2 version of the game was digitally re-released on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 on June 11, 2024 and included trophy support, save states, and rendering options.

==Reception==

&quot;Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus&quot; received &quot;generally favorable&quot; reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic. Most reviewers praised the unique look of the game. GameSpot noted that &quot;The game has a fantastic sense of style to its design that is reflected in everything from the animation to the unique use of the peaking fad, cel-shaded polygons.&quot; Many reviews also appreciated the ease of learning the controls and gameplay; IGN stated that &quot;Sly is incredibly responsive, and though his size seems a little large at times due to his long arms and legs and the cane he carries, skillfully jumping and hitting enemies with precision is a quick study.&quot; Several reviewers appreciated the fluidity of the game between actual play, cutscenes, and other features. The game was also praised for being a game that was accessible to both adults and children.

A common detraction of the game was its length; as commented by GameSpot&#x27;s review, &quot;The main problem is that just as you&#x27;re getting into a groove and really enjoying the variety seen throughout the different levels, the game ends.&quot; The length was defended by Sucker Punch&#x27;s developers; Brian Flemming noted that there was additional content to be unlocked at several levels, including &quot;for each [Master Sprint] you complete, you get bonus commentary from the designers, artists, and programmers here at Sucker Punch, something that people have reacted to really positively.&quot; The game was also cited as being too easy, with GameSpot stating that &quot;The game&#x27;s relative ease combined with a very short length prevents Sly Cooper from becoming the next big platformer. But it&#x27;s great while it lasts.&quot; However, &quot;Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine&quot; noted that in regards to the difficulty &quot;There&#x27;s a pleasant old-school feel to Thievius Raccoonus; the enemies are merciless but a bit stupid, and the platforming challenges come on strong and ramp up steadily in difficulty as the levels go by.&quot; Reviewers also noted some framerate slowdowns in latter levels of the game, as well as some camera control issues.

===Sales and accolades===
For their &quot;Best and Worst of 2002&quot; awards, &quot;GameSpot&quot; nominated the game for &quot;Best Game No One Played on PlayStation 2&quot; and &quot;Best Platformer&quot;. For &quot;IGN&quot;″s Best of 2002, &quot;Sly Cooper&quot; was the runner-up for &quot;Best Platformer&quot; and nominated for &quot;Special Achievements for Graphics&quot;. In 2003, &quot;GameSpy&quot; ranked 22 in their &quot;25 Most Underrated Games of All Time&quot;.
In 2008, &quot;IGN&quot; ranked the game 21 in its &quot;Top 25 PS2 Games&quot;. During the 6th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences awarded &quot;Sly Cooper&quot; with &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Animation&quot; and &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Art Direction&quot;, along with a nomination for &quot;Console Platform Action/Adventure Game of the Year&quot;.

The game sold over 400,000 copies within a year since its release and was republished under Sony&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; line in 2003. By July 2006, &quot;Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus&quot; had sold 800,000 copies and earned $21 million in the United States. &quot;Next Generation&quot; ranked it as the 78th highest-selling game launched for the Sixth generation of video game consoles.

==Sequels and other appearances==

The game has yielded three sequels, &quot;Sly 2: Band of Thieves&quot; (2004), &quot;Sly 3: Honor Among Thieves&quot; (2005) and &quot;Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time&quot; (2013). &quot;Sly Cooper&quot; won &quot;Best New Character&quot; and was nominated for &quot;Excellence in Visual Arts&quot; at the 2003 Game Developer&#x27;s Conference for 2002. The character of Sly Cooper has also been come to be considered as a mascot for the PlayStation systems, alongside both Ratchet &amp; Clank and Jak &amp; Daxter. This has led to collaboration between the development teams for all three series, Sucker Punch, Insomniac Games, and Naughty Dog,

<text>Jenna von Oÿ (born Jennifer Jean von Oy; May 2, 1977) is an American actress. She played the role of Six LeMeure in the 1990-1995 sitcom &quot;Blossom&quot; and Stevie Van Lowe in the 1999-2004 sitcom &quot;The Parkers&quot;.

==Early life and career==

Born in Danbury, Connecticut, to Gloria and Frank von Oy, Jenna attended Newtown High School and began her acting career as a child in regional stage productions and commercials. Von Oÿ made her television acting debut in 1986 in an episode of &quot;ABC Weekend Special&quot;, which was followed by guest roles on &quot;Tales from the Darkside&quot; and &quot;Kate &amp; Allie&quot;. From 1990 to 1991, she co-starred in the short-lived CBS sitcom &quot;Lenny&quot;.

From 1990 to 1995, von Oÿ appeared in the role of the fast-talking Six Lemeure in the series &quot;Blossom&quot;. After the series ended, she attended film school at the University of Southern California and was an active member of the Kappa Alpha Theta sorority for two years before dropping out to return to acting. In 1999, she won the role of Stevie Van Lowe, Kim Parker (Countess Vaughn)&#x27;s sidekick in &quot;The Parkers&quot;.

During the run of &quot;The Parkers&quot;, von Oÿ also provided the voice of Trinket St. Blaire in the animated series &quot;Pepper Ann&quot;. After &quot;The Parkers&quot; ended its run in 2004, von Oÿ appeared in the 2005 television film, &quot;Marsha Potter Gets a Life&quot;. Later that year, she guest-starred in an episode of &quot;Cold Case&quot; and parodied Alexis Bledel&#x27;s character Rory Gilmore in the &quot;Family Guy&quot; episode &quot;Perfect Castaway&quot;.

In addition to television, von Oÿ has also appeared in the feature film &quot;Born on the Fourth of July&quot; (1989) opposite Tom Cruise. She has also provided the voices of Stacey in &quot;A Goofy Movie&quot; (1995) and Gracie in the direct-to-DVD feature &quot;Dr. Dolittle 3&quot; (2006).

In June 2000, von Oÿ recorded a demo compact disc in an attempt to launch a recording career in country music. Her debut album, &quot;Breathing Room&quot;, was released on September 18, 2007.

==Personal life==
She married computer-data consultant Brad Bratcher in Newtown, Connecticut, in October 2010 but the couple has since divorced. They have two daughters, born in 2012 and 2014. She publicly came out as a lesbian in 2023.

<text>Colossal Adventure is a text based adventure game published by Level 9 Computing in 1982. It was originally released for the Nascom.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Colossal Adventure&quot; is an expanded version of the original &quot;Adventure&quot; by Will Crowther and Don Woods. Over 70 additional locations were added.

==Development and release==

&quot;Colossal Adventure&quot; was the first commercial game from Level 9.

It was later released as the first game in the &quot;Jewels of Darkness&quot; trilogy.

==Reception==
Allan J. Palmer for &quot;Page 6&quot; said &quot;Great Scott (Adams?)! Level 9 Computing have a winner here in this excellent rendition of the original Crowther/Woods mainframe Adventure game.&quot;

Steve Cooke for &quot;Personal Computer Games&quot; said &quot;Although by contrast with some programs available on other machines this program looks a little dated, it shines out like a star in an empty sky as far as Lynx owners are concerned.&quot;

John Conquest for &quot;Big K&quot; said &quot;Even by Level 9&#x27;s present standards, &quot;Colossal Adventure&quot; is not the best game available, nor the most engrossing, the most difficult, the most fun, or indeed the most anything.&quot;

Stuart Menges for &quot;Acorn User&quot; said &quot;&quot;Colossal Adventure&quot; is one of the best in its class. I would recommend it to any adventurer.&quot; Philip Garritt for &quot;Acorn User&quot; said &quot;The program [...] is good value and will give many hours of entertainment.&quot;

&quot;What MSX?&quot; said &quot;Level 9 is the number one software house for adventures, and this is the number one title. MSX owners start here.&quot;

&quot;Micro Adventurer&quot; referred to the game as a &quot;first-class version&quot; of the original &quot;Adventure&quot;, while &quot;Amstrad Action&quot; said &quot;it&#x27;s still the best and lengthiest version of this text-only classic available for a micro&quot;.

&quot;Crash&quot; considered the game &quot;Recommended.&quot;

A retrospective review in &quot;The Spectrum Show&quot; said &quot;If you want the granddaddy of all adventures, this is the one to get, closely followed by the Abersoft one that was bought by Melbourne House and released as Classic Adventure.&quot;

<text>A country park is a natural area designated for people to visit and enjoy recreation in a countryside environment.

==United Kingdom==

===History===
In the United Kingdom, the term &quot;country park&quot; has a specific meaning. There are around 250 designated country parks in England and Wales attracting some 57 million visitors a year, and another 40 or so in Scotland. Most country parks were designated in the 1970s, under the Countryside Act 1968, with the support of the former Countryside Commission. In more recent times there has been no specific financial support for country parks directly and fewer have been designated.

Most parks are managed by local authorities, although other organisations and private individuals can also run them. The Countryside Act 1968 empowered the Countryside Commission to recognize country parks. Although the act established country parks and gave guidance on the core facilities and services they should provide it did not empower the designation of sites as country parks, as it was left to local authorities to decide whether to endorse a site calling itself a country park. 

In England, country parks can be accredited by Natural England, and some also have Green Flag status.

===Purpose===

The purpose of a country park is to provide a place that has a natural, rural atmosphere for visitors who do not necessarily want to go out into the wider countryside. Visitors can enjoy a public open space with an informal atmosphere, as opposed to a formal park as might be found in an urban area. For this reason country parks are usually found close to or on the edge of built-up areas, and rarely in the wider countryside.

===Amenities===
A country park usually has some more formal facilities, such as a car park, toilets, maybe a cafe or kiosk, paths and trails, and some information for visitors. Some have much more, with museums, visitor centres, educational facilities, historic buildings, farms, boating, fishing, and other attractions.

Many larger country parks organise entertainment for visitors, and are venues for firework displays, shows and fairs and other large, outdoor events.

There is not necessarily any public right of access to country parks, and visitors are usually subject to byelaws when they enter the park. Some charge for car parking, some are free.

These parks vary tremendously from one to another, and really have only their purpose in common: to provide easy access to the countryside for those living in the towns and suburbs. They do not necessarily have any great nature conservation interest, although often this is the case.

==Hong Kong==

In Hong Kong a large part of the territory&#x27;s countryside is officially designated as country parks. Most of these are reservoir watersheds, serving the dual purpose of providing recreational facilities and contributing to Hong Kong&#x27;s water supply.

<text>D Magazine is a monthly magazine covering Dallas–Fort Worth. It is headquartered in Downtown Dallas.

&quot;D Magazine&quot; covers a range of topics including politics, business, food, fashion and lifestyle in the city of Dallas. The first issue was published in October 1974 by its founders, Wick Allison and Jim Atkinson.

==History==
&quot;D Magazine&quot; was founded in 1974 by two University of Texas graduates, Wick Allison and Jim Atkinson. Both had a vision of giving Dallas an independent city magazine with an impact that would serve readers’ interests. They developed their concept after-hours while Allison, a Dallas native, attended graduate school at Southern Methodist University and Atkinson reported on KERA’s daily &quot;Newsroom&quot; program. Their vision was backed financially by young Dallas business people who shared their belief in the need for a strong city magazine.

The magazine received an early boost from Neiman Marcus founder Stanley Marcus, who sent a letter to 200,000 Neiman Marcus cardholders in the Dallas area, urging them to subscribe to the new magazine. It is a member of the City and Regional Magazine Association (CRMA).

The magazine was not well received by everyone. In 1975 then-mayor Wes Wise sued the magazine for libel. That same year the Dallas Restaurant Association sent a letter to its members urging an advertising boycott of the magazine because of its critical dining reviews. In 1990, American Express purchased the magazine, but the new ownership was not successful. In 1996, original founder Wick Allison repurchased the magazine with a group of investors, and in 2003 became the sole owner.

The editors and staff writers of &quot;D&quot; also publish &quot;FrontBurner&quot;, a blog about things relating to Dallas. In 2000, Allison launched a sister magazine, &quot;D Home&quot;, for the home furnishings industry, and in 2003 a magazine for local brides called &quot;D Weddings&quot;. By 2007 there were five more magazines under the &quot;D&quot; brand, serving various communities of interest, as well as nine associated community weeklies serving affluent neighborhoods in Dallas.

In 2008, &quot;D Magazine&quot; laid off 19% of its staff and closed three of its newspapers due to shrinking revenue from advertising. The magazine laid off an additional 12% of its staff in 2009.

D Magazine Partners also publishes &quot;D Home,&quot; &quot;D CEO&quot;, &quot;Dallas/Fort Worth Medical Directory&quot;, &quot;D Weddings&quot;, &quot;Private School Handbook&quot;, and Dmagazine.com, a daily resource for best restaurants in Dallas, recommendations for things to do, local news, and commentary on life in Dallas.

<text>Coxiella burnetii is an obligate intracellular bacterial pathogen, and is the causative agent of Q fever. The genus &quot;Coxiella&quot; is morphologically similar to &quot;Rickettsia&quot;, but with a variety of genetic and physiological differences. &quot;C. burnetii&quot; is a small Gram-negative, coccobacillary bacterium that is highly resistant to environmental stresses such as high temperature, osmotic pressure, and ultraviolet light. These characteristics are attributed to a small cell variant form of the organism that is part of a biphasic developmental cycle, including a more metabolically and replicatively active large cell variant form. It can survive standard disinfectants, and is resistant to many other environmental changes like those presented in the phagolysosome.

==History and naming==
Research in the 1920s and 1930s identified what appeared to be a new type of &quot;Rickettsia&quot;, isolated from ticks, that was able to pass through filters. The first description of what may have been &quot;Coxiella burnetii&quot; was published in 1930 by Hideyo Noguchi, but since his samples did not survive, it remains unclear as to whether it was the same organism. The definitive descriptions were published in the late 1930s as part of research into the cause of Q fever, by Edward Holbrook Derrick and Macfarlane Burnet in Australia, and Herald Rea Cox and Gordon Davis at the Rocky Mountain Laboratory (RML) in the United States.

The RML team proposed the name &quot;Rickettsia diaporica&quot;, derived from the Greek word for having the ability to pass through filter pores, to avoid naming it after either Cox or Davis if indeed Noguchi&#x27;s description had priority. Around the same time, Derrick proposed the name &quot;Rickettsia burnetii&quot;, in recognition of Burnet&#x27;s contribution in identifying the organism as a &quot;Rickettsia&quot;. As it became clear that the species differed significantly from other &quot;Rickettsia&quot;, it was first elevated to a subgenus named after Cox, &quot;Coxiella&quot;, and then in 1948 to its own genus of that name, proposed by Cornelius B. Philip, another RML researcher. Research in the 1960s1970s by French Canadian-American microbiologist and virologist Paul Fiset was instrumental in the development of the first successful Q fever vaccine.

&quot;Coxiella&quot; was difficult to study because it could not be reproduced outside a host. However, in 2009, scientists reported a technique allowing the bacteria to grow in an axenic culture and suggested the technique may be useful for study of other pathogens.

==Pathogenesis==
Of the many &quot;C. burnetii&quot; strains, two of the most studied are the Nine Mile phase I and Priscilla phase I strain. In recent years, more strains have been studied. Nonetheless, it has been demonstrated that the Nine Mile strain is one of the most virulent strains of &quot;C. burnetti&quot; with as few as four organisms needed to cause infection. This is particularly relevant as murine rodents are poorly susceptible to &quot;C. burnetii&quot;, necessitating a higher dose and a more virulent dose to inoculate murine rodents for disease study. 

The ID50 (the dose needed to infect 50% of experimental subjects) is one via inhalation; i.e., inhalation of one organism will yield disease in 50% of the population. This is an extremely low infectious dose (only 1-10 organisms required), making &quot;C. burnetii&quot; one of the most infectious known organisms. Disease occurs in two stages: an acute stage that presents with headaches, chills, and respiratory symptoms, and an insidious chronic stage.

&quot;C. burnettii&quot; infections begins within the alveoli. Upon inhalation, it targets alveolar macrophages and passively enters them via actin-dependent phagocytosis. After initial binding, it is suggested that &quot;C. burnetii&quot; enters phagocytotic cells via passive actin-dependent phagocytosis and enters non-professional phagocytes via an active zipper mechanism. &quot;C. burnetii&quot; exploits the αVβ3 integrin to enter using RAC1-dependent phagocytosis, which is believed to have evolved as a mechanism to avoid the induction of an inflammatory response.

Following infection, &quot;C. burnetii&quot; has a biphasic developmental cycle, which consists of small cell variant (SCV) and large cell variant (LCV) morphological forms, which are both infectious. As the SCV is metabolically repressed and resistant to many environmental stressors, it is likely the form that initiates natural infections. Having entered a host cell, &quot;C. burnetii&quot; SCVs transit through the phagolysosomal maturation pathway. In the first six hours post-infection, endosomes, autophagosomes, and lysosomes containing acid phosphatase fuse with the nascent phagosome to form early PV, which fosters the transition from SCV to LCV. Resultantly, &quot;C. burnetii&quot; is metabolically activated and produces the T4SS to translocate effector proteins into the host cytoplasm. After 6 days, &quot;C. burnetii&quot; transitions back to SCV.

While most infections clear up spontaneously, treatment with tetracycline or doxycycline appears to reduce the symptomatic duration and reduce the likelihood of chronic infection. A combination of erythromycin and rifampin is highly effective in curing the disease, and vaccination with Q-VAX vaccine (CSL) is effective for prevention of it.

The bacteria use a type IVB secretion system known as Icm/Dot (intracellular multiplication / defect in organelle trafficking genes) to inject over 100 effector proteins into the host. These effectors increase the bacteria&#x27;s ability to survive and grow inside the host cell by modulating many host cell pathways, including blocking cell death, inhibiting immune reactions, and altering vesicle trafficking. In &quot;Legionella pneumophila&quot;, which uses the same secretion system and also injects effectors, survival is enhanced because these proteins interfere with fusion of the bacteria-containing vacuole with the host&#x27;s degradation endosomes.

==Use as a biological weapon==
The United States ended its biological warfare program in 1969. When it did, &quot;C. burnetii&quot; was one of seven agents it had standardized as biological weapons.

==Genomics==
At least 75 completely sequenced genomes of &quot;Coxiella burnetii&quot; strains exist, which contain about 2.1 Mbp of DNA each and encode around 2,100 open reading frames; 746 (or about 35%) of these genes have no known function. 

In bacteria small regulatory RNAs are activated during stress and virulence conditions. &quot;Coxiella burnetii&quot; small RNAs (CbSRs 1, 11, 12, and 14) are encoded within intergenic region (IGR). CbSRs 2, 3, 4 and 9 are located antisense to identified ORFs. The CbSRs are up-regulated during intracellular growth in host cells.

All &quot;C. burnetii&quot; isolates either carry one of four conserved independently-replicating large plasmids (QpH1, QpDG, QpRS, or QpDV) or a chromosomal element derived from QpRS. QpH1 carries virluence factors important for the bacterium&#x27;s survival inside mouse macrophages and Vero cells; growth on axenic media is unaffected. QpH1 also contains a toxin-antitoxin system. Among all plasmids, eight conserved genes code for proteins that are inserted into the host cell via the secretion system.
