<doc id="1032969" wikidata="Q4969959" url="?curid=1032969" title="British Far East Command">
<text>The Far East Command was a British military command which had 2 distinct periods. These were firstly, 18 November 1940 – 7 January 1942 succeeded by the American-British-Dutch-Australian Command (ABDACOM), and secondly, 1963–1971 succeeded by Australia, New Zealand, and United Kingdom Force (ANZUK Force)

==1940–1942==
The British had several commands with responsibilities East of Suez. General Sir Archibald Wavell, the Commander-in-Chief, India, directed army forces in India. Air force and naval forces in India had separate commanders. The Far East Command under Air Marshal Robert Brooke-Popham and from 23 December 1941 by Lieutenant-General Sir Henry Royds Pownall.

The C-in-C Far East Command was responsible directly to the Chiefs of Staff for the operational control and general direction of training of all British land and air forces in Malaya, Burma, and Hong Kong, and for the co-ordination of plans for the defence of those territories. But the CinC exercised no command or control over any naval forces.

It was intended that C-in-C should deal primarily with matters of major military policy and strategy, but it was not the intention that the C-in-C should assume any administrative or financial responsibilities or take over any of the day-to-day functions at that time exercised by the General (or Air) Officers Commanding (GOC) of the different areas. The degree of &quot;operational control&quot; of British land and air forces, which the Commander-in-Chief Far East should assume, was defined as meaning &quot;the higher direction and control&quot; as distinct from &quot;detailed operational control&quot;. To complicate matters, the GOCs correspond with the War Office, Air Ministry, Colonial Office and Local Governor&#x27;s Offices on all matters on which they had previously dealt with those departments. But the GOCs had to keep the C-in-C informed if he wished.

To enable the Commander-in-Chief Far East to carry out his functions, he was allowed a small staff, initially consisting of seven officers drawn from all three Services with the necessary clerical and cipher staff. For intelligence purposes, he had at his disposal the Far East Combined Bureau, though it remained under Admiralty control. Although the establishment of his staff was later increased to fifteen it was never large enough. The Naval Base was a considerable distance across Singapore from the Malaya Army Headquarters which discouraged frequent meetings.

On 5 December 1941 London gave permission for C-in-C Far East Command to decide if Operation Matador should be activated. The chief strategic decision to be decided was whether Siam should be invaded in a pre-emptive move, before any Japanese landings took place. The Malaya Command was responsible for the planning of Operation Matador.

When the Allied governments appointed General Sir Archibald Wavell as supreme commander of American-British-Dutch-Australian Command (ABDACOM), British Far East Command became redundant because its functions would in future be carried out by ABDACOM. So when Wavell arrived in Singapore, where the British Far East Command was based, on 7 January 1942, ABDACOM absorbed the British command in its entirety and C-in-C Far East Command Henry Royds Pownall became Wavell&#x27;s Chief of Staff. On 15 January, Wavell moved his headquarters to Lembang near Bandung on Java and assumed control of Allied operations.

===Commanders-in-Chief===
Commanders-in-Chief have included:
After the Far East came under the jurisdiction, from August 1943, of South East Asia Command (&#x27;SEAC&#x27;). The initial land forces operational area for SEAC had been India, Burma, Ceylon, British Malaya, Sumatra, and, for offensive operations, Siam (Thailand) and French Indochina. On 15 August 1945 this was expanded to include the Dutch East Indies and French Indochina. SEAC was disbanded in 1946 and in 1947 the Army Command was reformed under the name Far East Land Forces.

== History ==
=== Formation and early years ===
On 20 August 1938, New Zealand, captained by Margaret Matangi, made their test debut in an away match against at Australia at Royal Park, Melbourne. Australia defeated New Zealand 40–11.

===Rivalry with Australia===
New Zealand&#x27;s main rivals in international netball are Australia. Between 1963 and 2015, the two teams dominated the World Netball Championships and Commonwealth Games tournaments. Since 2010 the two teams have also competed for the Constellation Cup. Notable and memorable clashes have included the finals of the 1991, 1999 and 2011 World Netball Championships, the finals of the 2010 and the 2014 Commonwealth Games and the final match of the 2013 Constellation Cup.

==Tournament history==

After winning the 1967 World Netball Championships, New Zealand were world champions for the first time. The team was coached by Taini Jamison and captained by Judy Blair. In the final they beat Australia 40–43. Joan Harnett emerged as the star for New Zealand and was named player of the tournament. In 1996 the team was inducted into the New Zealand Sports Hall of Fame. 

At the 1979 World Netball Championships, New Zealand shared the gold medal with Australia and Trinidad and Tobago. After winning the 1987 World Netball Championships, with a team coached by Lois Muir and captained by Leigh Gibbs, New Zealand were world champions for a third time. New Zealand were dominant in group play, winning all eight matches. That saw them advance to a final round with Australia, England and Trinidad and Tobago. New Zealand were the only team to win all three of their games and were subsequently declared world champions. In 1996, the 1987 team was also inducted into the New Zealand Sports Hall of Fame.

At the 2003 World Netball Championships, with a team captained by Anna Rowberry, New Zealand won their fourth title. In the final they defeated Australia 49–47.

New Zealand were world champions for a fifth time when, with a team captained by Laura Langman and featuring Casey Kopua and Maria Folau, they won the 2019 Netball World Cup. In just fourteen months, head coach Noeline Taurua turned a team, demoralised at missing out on a medal at the 2018 Commonwealth Games, into world champions. New Zealand rebounded from a round robin defeat to Australia to defeat them 52–51 in the final. At the 2019 Halberg Awards, the Silver Ferns won both the Halberg Award Supreme and were named Team of the Year. Winning the 2019 Netball World Cup was declared New Zealand&#x27;s Favourite Sports Moment and Taurua, was named Coach of the Year. The team were also awarded the 2019 Lonsdale Cup.

Between 1998 and 2014 they played in every tournament final, winning two gold and three silver medals. In 2006 New Zealand won the gold medal for the first time with a 60–55 win over Australia. In 2010, New Zealand, led by Maria Tutaia and Irene van Dyk, won their second gold medal after they defeated Australia 66–64 in an epic encounter. Tutaia scored the winning goal in double extra time after 84 minutes of play. The Silver Ferns were also awarded the 2010 Lonsdale Cup.

<doc id="1032974" wikidata="Q1595425" url="?curid=1032974" title="Mogami-class cruiser">
<text>The was a ship class of four cruisers built for the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) during the 1930s. They were initially classified as light cruisers under the weight and armament restrictions of the London Naval Treaty. After Japan abrogated that agreement, all four ships were rearmed with larger guns and reclassified as heavy cruisers. All participated in World War II and were sunk.

==Design==

For the 1931 Fleet Replenishment Program, believing themselves understrength in cruisers, the IJN chose to build to the maximum allowed by the Washington Naval Treaty. This resulted in the choice of guns in five triple turrets (a first for Japan) in the &quot;Mogami&quot;s, also capable of 55° elevation, making the &quot;Mogami&quot;s one of the very few classes of cruiser to have a dual purpose (DP) main battery; this was coupled with very heavy anti-aircraft protection, as well as the standard reloadable, turreted torpedo launchers, also unique to the IJN.

To save weight and improve transverse stability, the class was given a more compact and lower superstructure, made of aluminium, which was welded rather than riveted. Only ten boilers could be fit under the weight limits (compared to twelve in the previous and classes), and the chimney arrangement was designed to minimize weight as well; the middle funnel featured no chimney of its own, instead venting its exhaust gasses into the underside of the forward chimney, which itself was reclined from its base so that, at its top, it merged with the aft funnel&#x27;s chimney. The new geared impulse turbines added over &quot;Atago&quot;, increasing the top speed by . Protection, however, was not stinted on; the class proved able to take substantial punishment.

The declared weight was 8,500 tons, though the true design weight was 9,500 and at trials they would displace 11,169 tons. “They must be building their ships out of cardboard or lying” said the Royal Navy’s Director of Naval Construction (DNC) in 1935 when briefed by Naval Intelligence about the public displacement figure announced by the Japanese.

The designers, however, had overreached; excessive topweight led to instability, and gunnery trials revealed cracking hull welds. Hull bulges were retrofitted to &quot;Mogami&quot; and &quot;Mikuma&quot;, and added to &quot;Kumano&quot; and &quot;Suzuya&quot;, increasing beam to and displacement to 11,200 tons, cutting speed by .

Following Japan&#x27;s withdrawal from the Second London Naval Treaty, plans were made to modernize and expand the entire fleet. Beginning in 1939, the class was brought in for substantial reconstruction, replacing the triple 155 mm turrets with twin 203 mm (8-inch) guns, turning over the 155 mm turrets for the battleships of the . Indeed, the designers had designed the class in mind so that the 6-inch guns could be switched with 8-inch batteries, in effect making them heavy cruisers and skirting the London Naval Treaty, though the Japanese had withdrawn from the conference and were not signatories to the Second London Naval Treaty of 1936.

Torpedo bulges were also added; in all, displacement rose to over 13,000 tons, and speed dropped to .
The United States Navy&#x27;s s were designed specifically to counter the &quot;Mogami&quot; class, and as a result had a very similar armament to the pre-refit &quot;Mogami&quot;s, in a nearly identical layout, although the US-pattern 6-inch/47-caliber gun was semi-automatic, with a higher rate of fire and the three weapons in each turret mounted in a single sleeve. Japan&#x27;s choice of the 155 mm gun caliber is curious, as Japan already had a 6-inch (152 mm) weapon in service, of nearly equal performance. In spite of the resulting multiplicity of similar gun calibers, Japan resented the 5-5-3 treaty ratios, and had vowed to build to the very limit allowed by the 1922 Washington and 1930 London Naval Treaties. As the French had already used a 155 mm main battery in the three s (1922–1926), this became the largest gun caliber allowed for light cruisers under the 1930 London Naval Treaty. This line of reasoning is wrong though: The shell of the 155mm version of the gun weighed 56kg versus 45kg of the ever so slightly smaller caliber. The new gun was a new design, not a minor modification to an existing design.

==War service==

All four ships participated in the Japanese invasion of the Dutch East Indies. &quot;Mogami&quot; and &quot;Mikuma&quot; were present at the Battle of Sunda Strait and contributed to the sinkings of the cruisers and .

In June 1942, all four took part in the Battle of Midway, where &quot;Mogami&quot; and &quot;Mikuma&quot; collided trying to avoid a submarine attack; &quot;Mikuma&quot; was finished off on 6 June 1942 by aircraft from aircraft carriers and . The heavily damaged &quot;Mogami&quot; limped home and spent ten months in yard, during which her afterparts were completely rebuilt, and &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; turrets were replaced by a flight deck (with the intention to operate 11 aircraft).

In October 1944, the survivors were reunited at the Battle of Leyte Gulf. &quot;Mogami&quot;, heavily damaged by a collision with the cruiser , cruiser gunfire, and aerial attack, was scuttled by the destroyer , while &quot;Kumano&quot; limped into Manila harbor on one boiler, to be sunk by Halsey&#x27;s aviators on 25 November 1944; the US escort carrier planes mauled &quot;Suzuya&quot; at Leyte, which was scuttled by the destroyer on 25 October.

<text>The bombing of Wieluń is considered by many to be the first major act of World War II, and the September Campaign. After Luftwaffe air units moved into Polish airspace in the early morning of 1 September, they reached the town of Wieluń by 04:40–45. Around this time, the first strikes on the town were conducted, with a total of 46,000 kg bombs being dropped on civilian targets for 9 consecutive hours. Elsewhere, the Battle of Westerplatte and Danzig skirmishes began around the same time (04:45), starting the well-coordinated Invasion of Poland.

Located near the German border, the town of Wieluń was completely undefended, lacking anti-air capabilities and a military garrison. Despite Wieluń having no military targets, airstrikes continued. German intelligence reports had stated there was a Polish cavalry brigade stationed in the town. The Luftwaffe had reportedly bombed a &quot;clearly marked&quot; hospital, and strafed fleeing civilians, and also bombed the nearby towns of Działoszyn, Radomsko, and Sulejów, which also had no military targets.

In the aftermath, 127 civilian casualties were reported – possibly &quot;several hundred&quot; – but the exact number remains unknown. 70% of the town (90 percent, in the city center) was destroyed.

As the attack on the town happened without a declaration of war, it constituted the first German war crime in World War II, because it violated the 1907 Hague Convention &quot;III - Opening of Hostilities&quot; prohibiting hostilities against neutral powers without notification of a declaration of war.

==Timing==
The exact time the first bombs fell on Wieluń on the morning of 1 September 1939 has been a subject of debate, particularly in reference to claims that the town&#x27;s bombing was the first overt act of World War II, preceding by five minutes the shelling of Westerplatte at 04:45, which has traditionally been considered the opening of the war.

The time given by most Polish sources is 04:40, but this is an average of eyewitness reports on various phases of the initial bombing run, which likely lasted more than a minute. Polish historian Tadeusz Olejnik reports a number of accounts of the first bombs falling as early as 04:30. Another Polish historian, Jan Książek, described 04:40 as a &quot;certainly confirmed&quot; time.

German sources report the time as 05:40, based on German flight documents (&quot;Startzeit: 5.02, Angriffzeit: 5.40, Landezeit: 06.05&quot;: take-off 05:02, attack 05:40, landing 06:05). The time difference, 04:40 versus 05:40, has been attributed by several writers, such as journalist , to a summer time-difference between Poland and Germany. Other historians, such as Grzegorz Bębnik, disagree that there was a time difference and give the attack time as 05:40; he also cites an eyewitness account giving the attack time as &quot;shortly before 6 a.m.&quot; and notes that the eyewitness testimonies are likely unreliable as they were collected in 1961, two years after a commemorative plaque was put up in the town, giving the time as 04:40. He concludes the eyewitnesses were likely influenced by the plaque, which &quot;corrected&quot; their memories. In 2004 the Polish Institute of National Remembrance stated that there was no time difference between Poland and Germany and gave the time of initial bombing as 05:40.

Even if the time 04:40 was to be correct, several historians identify the first (aerial) action of the war as the bombing of the key Tczew bridge in the Pomeranian Corridor by bombers from Sturzkampfgeschwader 1 around 04:30.

==Events==

On 1 September 1939, 29 Junkers Ju 87B &quot;Stukas&quot; of I group &quot;Sturzkampfgeschwader 76&quot;, under command of Captain (&quot;Hauptmann&quot;) Walter Sigel, took off from Nieder-Ellguth airfield. Half an hour later they reached Wieluń unopposed and dropped 29 500-kilogram bombs and 112 50-kilogram bombs. One of the first places hit was the hospital, which likely had Red Cross markings; 32 persons in the hospital were killed. After the hospital began burning, German pilots strafed patients trying to escape the building. Within the hour all 29 aircraft landed back at Nieder-Ellguth, where Sigel reported &quot;no noteworthy observation of the enemy.&quot; German pilots reported &quot;blue skies&quot; during the attack and gave detailed descriptions of buildings bombed. After the initial attack, German pilots reported no enemy presence in Wieluń. Two Dornier Do 17 reconnaissance planes that had surveyed the area between 04:50 and 05:02 for Polish military units, reported locating several, the nearest to the town being in a forest southwest of Wieluń.

Several more waves bombed the town; sources vary as to the number. One of the latter waves, described by Piątkowski as the second, of &quot;Stuka&quot; bombers of I./&quot;Sturzkampfgeschwader 77&quot;, was commanded by Captain Friedrich-Karl Freiherr von Dalwigk zu Lichtenfels. Książek describes the second wave, which bombed the town at 05:08 (or 06:08, according to the IPN, which does not name its commander, only the unit: I/StG 77), as being commanded by Captain von Schönborn, likewise of &quot;Sturzkampfgeschwader 77&quot;. II./&quot;Sturzkampfgeschwader 77&quot;, was actually commanded by &quot;Hauptmann&quot; Clemens Graf von Schönborn-Wiesentheid.

At 13:00 hours (or 14:00) a third wave of 29 Stukas of Sturzkampfgeschwader 2, commanded by Major Oskar Dinort from Nieder-Ellguth, struck Wieluń. However, Bębnik writes that the third wave, commanded by Major Dinort, bombed the town at around 08:00 and 09:00. This was followed by a fourth wave at about 14:00 hours, commanded by Günter Schwartzkopff, of 60 Ju 87 &quot;Stuka&quot;s of &quot;I./Sturzkampfgeschwader 77.&quot; Based on German documents, Bębnik concludes that three morning waves and one lighter, afternoon wave of bombing can be confirmed.

The city was bombed with extreme precision, from low altitude due to the absence of air defenses. After the bombing, the Germans strafed fleeing civilians. The town was captured by the German Army on the first day of the invasion.

In all, 380 bombs totaling 46,000 kilograms were dropped on the town, hitting the hospital and destroying 70% of the town&#x27;s buildings, including as much as 90% in the city center. Other estimates have suggested 75% of buildings destroyed. Casualty estimates vary substantially, as an accurate casualty count does not exist since no comprehensive analysis of damage was carried out until after the war. Early estimates from the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland gave a number of 2169 fatalities; as time went by they have been revised and lowered. Norman Davies, who cited the number of &quot;1,290 townspeople killed&quot;, common in older research, still relatively often reported in modern media, called the casualty rate &quot;more than twice as high as Guernica&#x27;s or Coventry&#x27;s&quot;. In 2013, historian Piątkowski stated that the number of confirmed casualties is 127 and writes that the estimate of some 1,200 is incorrect as it represents the number of fatalities in all of Wieluń County. A similar conclusion was reached in a 2004 Institute of National Remembrance report, which stated that, while the number of casualties was likely in the range of &quot;several hundred&quot;, there are insufficient sources to arrive at a conclusive number, and only 127 have been identified beyond all doubt.

== Purpose ==
Piątkowski writes that some historians, such as Grzegorz Bębnik and , describe the bombings as having resulted from faulty reconnaissance or intelligence. German historian Rolf-Dieter Müller writes that, while the town might not have contained military targets, German pilots bombed it due to poor visibility, assuming there were military targets present. Several accounts state that the German command had received reports of the possible presence of Polish cavalry of the Wołyń Cavalry Brigade in the town&#x27;s vicinity, and at least one German pilot described the bombing of cavalry targets in the town itself. However, other German pilots had reported no military targets present. German historian Jochen Böhler writes that the first operational report by Sturzkampfgeschwader 76 stated there had been &quot;no enemy sightings&quot;, a finding corroborated by Poland&#x27;s Institute of National Remembrance, which concluded there were no Polish military targets or units in the city or vicinity on 1 September or the preceding day—as had already earlier been stated as well by a number of historians.

Most historians agree that the town contained no targets of military value. Historian Timothy Snyder suggests that the civilian population itself may have been the primary target: &quot;The Germans had chosen a locality bereft of military significance as the site of a lethal experiment. Could a modern air force terrorize a civilian population by deliberate bombing?&quot; This view has also been supported by Polish historians Tadeusz Olejnik and Bogumił Rudawski. Another view of a number of historians is that the destruction of the town infrastructure may have been the raids&#x27; aim, in order to test the tactics and firepower of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, in particular of the new Ju 87B bomber. Two weeks before the war began, Germany&#x27;s Chief of the General Staff Franz Halder mentioned in his war diary a plan called &quot;Offensive Operation Red in the Wieluń area&quot;. In the first days of the war, the Luftwaffe launched several further attacks in the area, including on the small towns of Działoszyn and Kamieńsk, and produced aerial photographs of the effectiveness of attacks on other towns.

Halder distinguished in his war diary between &quot;terror attacks&quot; and attacks on military targets. German historian Hans-Erich Volkmann notes that, for the German 10th Army, which was the critical military factor in this section of the front, Wieluń would have had no operational, let alone strategic, importance to justify its bombing. The commander responsible for the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, Wolfram von Richthofen, would have personally ordered the attack. Volkmann, like Böhler, observes that while Richthofen might not have intended it as a &quot;terror attack&quot;, he had selected Wieluń as a target close to the border in order to test the capabilities and operational effectiveness of his dive bombers, if possible without losses to his own force. Volkmann characterizes the destruction of Wieluń as an attack on a non-military target and therefore as a war crime. Similar reasons for bombing a defenseless small town are given by historian Norman Davies for the bombing of Frampol two weeks later: &quot;Frampol was chosen partly because it was completely defenceless, and partly because its baroque street plan presented a perfect geometric grid for calculations and measurements.&quot;

Piątkowski, analysing the bombing from the perspective of aerial bombardment and international law, concludes that the bombing constituted a violation of a number of war norms, in particular relating to humanitarianism and proportional force. He also discusses the applicability of the term &quot;terror bombing&quot; in the light of a never-adopted 1923 draft convention (&quot;The Hague Rules of Air Warfare&quot;) that introduced the term. He concludes that, in order to describe the Wieluń raids as terror bombing, documents would have to prove that the real reason for the bombing was the terrorizing of the civilian populace and not a misidentification of military targets.

Legal scholar Antoni Zakrzewski wrote:

Despite the aforementioned debates, Wieluń remains the first assault involving civilian casualties of the Second World War, and many see it as a symbol of Polish suffering during the war. As such, it is being compared to Guernica – a town destroyed in 1937 during the Spanish Civil War, no less but by the same Luftwaffe forces under the command of the field marshal Wolfram Freiherr von Richthofen.

==Major landmarks, damaged or destroyed==
Targets destroyed by German bombing included:
*The , built in the 13th–14th centuries
*A mid-19th-century 
*The 14th-century 
*One wing of the 19th-century 
*The , with a clear Red Cross roof sign, whose bombing killed 32 persons, including 26 patients
*The 15th-century , severely damaged
*Over a dozen historic 18th- and early-19th-century houses

The city hall, with its 14th-century Kraków Gate, survived when a bomb got stuck in the city hall&#x27;s roof and failed to explode.

==Remembrance==
The first scholarly study of the bombing was performed in 1961 by Barbara Bojarska, based on her interviews with 14 Polish witnesses.

The attack on Wieluń has been commemorated by several Polish Presidents. In 2004 President Aleksander Kwasniewski unveiled a monument to the city&#x27;s fallen residents, saying that &quot;here total war was waged, not distinguishing between civilians and military, with the aim of mass extermination.&quot; In 2009 President Lech Kaczynski visited, emphasizing that &quot;Wieluń is a symbol of total war.&quot; In 2017 President Andrzej Duda visited and &quot;remind[ed] the world that the war started in Poland, on Westerplatte, but that in the first days the highest losses were sustained by civilians, and that Nazi Germany committed atrocities in bombing innocent populations.&quot;

The bombing of Wieluń is part of an exhibit at the German Bundeswehr Military History Museum in Dresden.

==Prosecution attempts==
Two attempts, in 1978 and 1983, to prosecute individuals for the bombing of the Wieluń hospital were dismissed by West German judges when prosecutors stated that, in the morning fog, the pilots had been unable to make out the nature of the structure.

<text>The Cenobites are fictional, extra-dimensional, and seemingly demonic beings who appear in the works of Clive Barker. Introduced in Barker&#x27;s 1986 novella &quot;The Hellbound Heart&quot;, they also appear in its sequel novel &quot;The Scarlet Gospels&quot;, the &quot;Hellraiser&quot; films, and in &quot;Hellraiser&quot; comic books published (intermittently) between 1987 and 2017. In the 1987 novel &quot;Weaveworld&quot;, they are mentioned in passing as &quot;The Surgeons&quot;. The Cenobites appear in prose stories authorized but not written by Clive Barker, such as the anthology &quot;Hellbound Hearts&quot; edited by Paul Kane and Marie O&#x27;Regan, the novella &quot;Hellraiser: The Toll&quot; (plotted by Barker and written by Mark Alan Miller), and the novel &quot;Sherlock Holmes and the Servants of Hell&quot; written by Paul Kane.

The most culturally significant, as can be seen through historical promotional material alongside the genesis of the third film in the series, of the Cenobites was nameless in the original novella, but was then nicknamed &quot;Pinhead&quot; by the production crew and fans of the first &quot;Hellraiser&quot; movie. In &quot;The Scarlet Gospels&quot;, he was given the official name of &quot;The Hell Priest&quot; by Barker.

==Etymology==
Etymologically the definition of the term &quot;&quot; represents the member of a religious order, who lives in a monastic community. Cenobite in the &quot;Hellraiser&quot; franchise represents a member of a masochistic religious community, priest of Leviathan.

== Attributes ==
&quot;The Hellbound Heart&quot; says the Cenobites are also known as &quot;The Order of the Gash&quot;. Cenobites were once human, having transformed to their current state in their pursuit of gratification. Cenobites are so removed from their former humanity and so dedicated to exploring physical experience that they no longer distinguish between sensations of pleasure and pain. Humans who summon the Cenobites, either by accident or in hopes of experiencing pleasures unknown on Earth, are often taken to their home dimension and become &quot;experiments&quot; in discovering the limits of physical experience, resulting in torture for eternity.

The Cenobites vary in number, appearance, and motivations depending on the medium (film, comic book, etc.) in which they appear. The involvement of multiple parties in the production of &quot;Hellraiser&quot; films and comics (many eschewing the creative supervision of Clive Barker) has led to varying levels of consistency with respect to their philosophies and abilities; for instance, their powers were much reduced in the 1992 film &quot;Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth&quot; compared with the first two films. The original novella and first two films indicate they are morally ambiguous (&quot;demons to some, angels to others&quot;) but later films and comics depict them as often malicious and taking delight in causing harm. The only constants are that they take the form of ritually mutilated people with varying degrees of human characteristics, and that they can only reach Earth&#x27;s reality when summoned through a schism in time and space, which is opened and closed using a puzzle box known as the Lament Configuration or, as described in the original story, the Lemarchand Configuration.

== Concept and design ==
After being disappointed with the way his material had been treated by producers in &quot;Underworld&quot;, Barker wrote &quot;The Hellbound Heart&quot; as his first step in directing a film by himself. The book describes a group of sadomasochistic entities who live in an extra-dimensional realm, where they perform &quot;experiments&quot; on humans in extreme sexual experiences. Although antagonist Frank Cotton believes they will take the form of beautiful women, they appear instead as monsters:

Author David McWilliam notes that the Cenobites are described in more explicitly sexual terms in the book compared with their depictions in the film adaptations. The four Cenobites described in the book each present unique mutilations and modifications: one Cenobite has stitches through its eyelids and a system of chains with bells hooked into various parts of its body; another has a grid tattooed to its head with jeweled pins driven into its skull at the intersections; the eyes of yet another are swollen shut and its mouth heavily disfigured; finally, a female Cenobite has undergone elaborate scarification to her pubis. The fifth, lead Cenobite, referred to as &quot;The Engineer&quot;, appears briefly in the book&#x27;s climax as an average human being whose body glows with intense light when he travels between realms.

After securing funding for a motion picture adaptation in early 1986, Barker and his producer Chris Figg assembled a team to design the cenobites. Among the team was Bob Keen and Geoff Portass at Image Animation and Jane Wildgoose, a costume designer who was requested to make a series of costumes for four or five &quot;super-butchers&quot; while refining the scarification designs with Image Animation.

Barker drew inspiration for the Cenobite designs from punk fashion, Catholicism, and by the visits he took to BDSM clubs in New York City and Amsterdam. Each of the four primary Cenobites from &quot;The Hellbound Heart&quot; were featured in the film, with appearances based upon their descriptions in the book. The first Cenobite became Butterball, the second Pinhead, the third Chatterer, and the fourth The Female. The Engineer was drastically altered for the film, taking the form of a giant creature with characteristics of different predatory animals.

=== In written works ===
* &quot;The Hellbound Heart&quot; (1986) – The original novella, introducing the Cenobites and the Lemarchand Configuration puzzle box. Though a few Cenobites are described, only one called the Engineer is named. One Cenobite is described as having a grid pattern tattooed to his head, with jeweled pins embedded in each intersection. This story&#x27;s character Kirsty (no last name given) is later adapted into the protagonist Kirsty Cotton in multiple &quot;Hellraiser&quot; films and comics.
* &quot;Hellbound Hearts&quot; (2009) – An authorized anthology featuring other creators telling their own stories featuring the Cenobites, edited by Paul Kane and Marie O&#x27;Regan. Includes works by Neil Gaiman, Dave McKean, Kelley Armstong, Mike Mignola, Steve Niles, Tim Lebbon, Christopher Golden, Conrad Williams, Nancy Holder, Sarah Langan, and Chaz Brenchley. The book includes a foreword by Clive Barker, an introduction by Stephen Jones who worked on the &quot;Hellraiser&quot; films, and an afterword by Doug Bradley who portrays Pinhead in the films.
* &quot;The Scarlet Gospels&quot; (2015) – A novel by Clive Barker wherein the &quot;Pinhead&quot; Cenobite is officially named the Hell Priest and encounters Harry D&#x27;Amour, the occult detective of several Barker prose stories and his film &quot;Lord of Illusions&quot;. The novel delves into the Hell Priest&#x27;s role in Hell and his ultimate goals. The Cenobites are shown to reside in a monastery that overlooks Hell&#x27;s capital city and are led by an Abbott until Pinhead kills them all.
* &quot;Sherlock Holmes and the Servants of Hell&quot; (2016) – An authorized novel written by Paul Kane, featuring Sherlock Holmes encountering the Cenobites and a man named Henri D&#x27;Amour.
* &quot;&quot; (2018) – Plotted by Clive Barker (who also provided artwork) and written by Mark Alan Miller, this novella acts as a bridge between &quot;Hellraiser&quot; film and &quot;The Scarlet Gospels&quot;, though it is also intended to work as a standalone story. The novella brings back Kirsty from &quot;The Hellbound Heart&quot; and &quot;Hellraiser&quot; films and gives her the last name Cotton (as opposed to Singer as it is in the novella), as well as making her the daughter of Larry Cotton as in the film. The story reveals that the Hell Priest is also known to some as &quot;the Cold Man&quot;.

=== &quot;Hellraiser&quot; films ===
In the second film &quot;&quot;, written by Clive Barker, the home of the Cenobites is revealed as a labyrinth-like dimension (possibly a part of the Christian Hell or a different place that inspired some myths of Hell) ruled over by a demonic entity called Leviathan, the creator of Cenobites. The film has Kirsty Cotton remind Pinhead and his group of Cenobites of their human origins. This spiritually weakens them and they are then seemingly destroyed. Barker wanted the villain Julia, played by Claire Higgins in both the first and second film, to carry the series as its main antagonist, reducing the Cenobites to a background role. However, Higgins declined to return to the series and fans rallied around Pinhead, portrayed by Doug Bradley, as the breakout character and main villain/anti-hero of the series. Pinhead&#x27;s nature and past are explored in &quot;Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth&quot;, where it is revealed he was not killed but simply had his human self freed, resulting in the Cenobite now existing without morality or restraint. The film ends with the human Elliott Spencer merging with Pinhead once more to stop the chaos and reintroduce restraint and a respect for rules into the Cenobite.

As the films continued, the stories were largely stand alone but Pinhead was a constant presence, though sometimes only briefly appearing. In &quot;The Ashgate Encyclopedia of Literary and Cinematic Monsters&quot;, David McWilliam writes that the Cenobites &quot;provide continuity across the series, as the stories become increasingly stand-alone in nature&quot;.

=== &quot;Hellraiser&quot; comic book series ===
Following the success of &quot;Hellraiser&quot; and &quot;Hellbound: Hellraiser II&quot;, Epic Comics published a &quot;Hellraiser&quot; spin-off comic series last twenty issues from 1989 to 1992. The comics featured several short stories written by new writers and artists, with Clive Barker acting as a creative consultant.

In 2011, Boom! Studios began a new comic book series following the canon of the first three &quot;Hellraiser&quot; films. The initial premise is that Pinhead is now bored with his existence as a Cenobite and plots a way to return to mortality. The series also involves Kirsty Cotton and Barker&#x27;s occult detective Harry D&#x27;Amour.

<text>The Cenobites LP is the eponymous debut album by the American hip hop duo the Cenobites, composed of rapper Kool Keith and producer Godfather Don. It was first released as an EP in 1995 via Fondle &#x27;Em Records and was later expanded for LP in 1997 and CD in 2000. Percee P and Bobbito Garcia made guest appearances on the record.

==History==
In 1992, South Bronx innovators Ultramagnetic MC&#x27;s recruited little known MC/producer Godfather Don to assist them on their third LP, &quot;The Four Horsemen&quot;. The dark, jazzy sound he contributed was something of a departure for the group, which was known for its futuristic funk. During and after the album&#x27;s recording, additional material featuring Kool Keith and Godfather Don was created for the Cenobites side project.

Radio personality Bobbito Garcia aka DJ Cucumberslice, a longtime fan and supporter of Ultramagnetic, dropped the &quot;Cenubites&quot; EP in 1995 on his own Fondle &#x27;Em label. He also made his rapping debut as a featured performer on two of the disc&#x27;s eight tracks. Another South Bronx veteran, Percee P, also contributed a guest appearance. All the artists involved with the project were regulars on WKCR&#x27;s Stretch Armstrong radio show in the early &#x27;90s, of which Bobbito was co-host.

Rumour has it that this album was recorded in a week, during a period where Kool Keith &amp; Godfather Don locked themselves away from the outside world (in a basement), only adding additional vocals after they emerged from their retreat. This would be in keeping with the name of the group &quot;Cenobite&quot;, as Cenobites are monks who would often shun the outside world in favor of a hermit type of life.

==Release==
Originally released as a seven-track extended play in 1995, it was reissued as nine-track longplay record with two more tracks added into it and retitled the Cenobites LP. A CD version was finally issued in 2000 with another bonus track, an extended version of Ultramagnetic MCs&#x27; &quot;Checkin&#x27; My Style&quot; renamed &quot;Return To Zero&quot;, which boasted a previously omitted Godather Don verse.

A handful of the Cenobites tracks remain officially unreleased including: &quot;You Lose,&quot; &quot;Lazy Woman,&quot; &quot;Cold Peein&#x27; On &#x27;Em,&quot; &quot;Break &#x27;Em Down&quot; and &quot;We Can Do This (ft. Mike L &amp; TR Love)&quot;. In addition, Kool Keith and Godfather Don appeared together on Raw Breed&#x27;s &quot;Rampage/Outta Control&quot; with the legendary Melle Mel, and reunited in 1998 for Godfather Don&#x27;s &quot;Voices&quot;.

<doc id="1032982" wikidata="Q2616170" url="?curid=1032982" title="Marine reserve">
<text>A marine reserve is a type of marine protected area (MPA). An MPA is a section of the ocean where a government has placed limits on human activity. A marine reserve is a marine protected area in which removing or destroying natural or cultural resources is prohibited, marine reserves may also be &quot;no-take MPAs,” which strictly forbid all extractive activities, such as fishing and kelp harvesting. As of 2007 less than 1% of the world&#x27;s oceans had been set aside in marine reserves. Benefits include increases in the diversity, density, biomass, body size and reproductive potential of fishery and other species within their boundaries.

As of 2010, scientists had studied more than 150 marine reserves in at least 61 countries and monitored biological changes inside the reserves. The number of species in each study ranged from 1 to 250 and the reserves ranged in size from 0.006 to 800 square kilometers (0.002 to 310 square miles). In 2014, the World Parks Association adopted a target of establishing no-take zones for 30% of each habitat globally.

== Design ==
A review of studies of 34 families (210 species) of coral reef fishes demonstrates that the design of a marine reserve has important implications for its ability to protect habitat and focal species.

=== Size and shape ===
Effective reserves included habitats that support the life history of focal species (e.g. home ranges, nursery grounds, migration corridors and spawning aggregations), and were located to accommodate movement patterns among them.

Movement patterns (home ranges, ontogenetic shifts and spawning migrations) vary among and within species, and are influenced by factors such as size, sex, behaviour, density, habitat characteristics, season, tide and time of day. For example, damselfishes, butterflyfishes and angelfishes travel &lt;0.1–0.5 km, while some sharks and tuna migrate over thousands of kilometres. Larval dispersal distances tend to be &lt;5–15 km, and self-recruitment to new habitat is common.

The review indicated that effective marine reserves are more than twice the size of the home range of focal/target species (in all directions). The presence of effective marine management outside the reserve may allow smaller reserves. Reserve size recommendations apply to the specific habitats of focal species, not the overall size. For example, coral reef species require coral reef habitats rather than open ocean or seagrass beds.

Marine reserve whose boundaries are extensively fished benefit from compact shapes (e.g., squares or circles rather than elongated rectangles). Including whole ecological units (e.g., an offshore reef) can reduce exports where that is desired.

=== Habitats ===
Minimum sustainable population sizes have not been determined for most marine populations. Instead, fisheries ecologists use the fraction of unfished stock levels as a proxy. Meta-analyses suggest that maintaining populations above ~37% of those levels generally ensures stable populations, although variations in fishing pressure allow fractions as small as 10% or as large as 40% (to protect species such as sharks and some grouper that have lower reproductive output or slower maturation). Higher fractions of habitat protection may protect areas vulnerable to disturbances such as typhoons or climate change. 20–30% protection can achieve fisheries objectives in areas with controlled fishing pressure and is the minimum level of habitat protection recommended by IUCN-WCPA.

=== Special areas ===
Many fish species congregate to facilitate spawning. Such congregations are spatially and temporally predictable and increase the species&#x27; vulnerability to overfishing. Species such as groupers and rabbitfishes travel long distances to congregate for days or weeks. Such gatherings are their only opportunities to reproduce and are crucial to population maintenance. Species such as snappers and parrotfishes congregate in feeding or resting areas. Juveniles may congregate in nursery areas without adults. Such special areas may require only seasonal protections if at other times no vital activities are taking place. Such reserves must be spaced to allow focal species to journey among them. If the location of such special areas is unknown, or is too large to include in a reserve, management approaches such as seasonal capture and sales restrictions may provide some protection. Sea turtle nesting areas, dugong feeding areas, cetacean migratory corridors and calving grounds are examples of other special areas that can be protected seasonally. Other types of special areas include isolated habitats that have unique assemblages and populations, habitats that are important for endemic species and highly diverse areas.

=== Isolated populations ===
Isolated populations (e.g. those on remote atolls) have high conservation value where they harbor endemic species and/or unique assemblages. A location or population 20–30 km from its nearest neighbor generally qualifies as isolated in the absence of a persistent linking current. Their isolation (low connectivity) requires such areas to be largely self-replenishing. This leaves them less resilient to disturbance. Sustaining their marine species requires a higher fraction of living areas to be protected.

=== Recovery ===
Coral reef fish species recovery rates (from e.g., overfishing) depend on their life history and factors such as ecological characteristics, fishing intensity and population size. In the Coral Triangle, species at lower trophic levels that have smaller maximum sizes, faster growth and maturation rates and shorter life spans tend to recover more quickly than species having the opposite characteristics. For example, in the Philippines, populations of planktivores (e.g., fusiliers) and some herbivores (e.g., parrotfishes) recovered in &quot;&lt;&quot;5–10 years in marine reserves, while predators (e.g., groupers) took 20–40 years. Increased fishing pressure adversely affects recovery rates (e.g., Great Barrier Reef and Papua New Guinea).

Long-term protection allows species with slower recovery rates to achieve and maintain ecosystem health and associated fishery benefits. Permanent protection protects these species over the long-term. Short-term protections do not allow slow-recovering species to reach or maintain stable populations.

In some Coral Triangle countries (e.g., Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands), short term protections are the most common form of traditional marine resource management. These protections can help address problems at lower trophic levels (e.g., herbivores) or allow spawning to succeed. Other reasons for adopting short-term protections include allowing communities to stockpile resources for feasts or close areas for cultural reasons. Short-term/periodic reserves also may function as partial insurance by enhancing overall ecosystem resilience against catastrophes. Reopened reserves can be protected by management controls that limit the harvest to less than the increase achieved during closure, although at greatly reduced recovery rates.

=== Resilience ===
Some habitats and species are better prepared environmental changes or extremes. These include coral communities that handle high sea surface temperature (SST); areas with variable SSTs and carbonate chemistry and areas adjacent to undeveloped low-lying inland areas that coastal habitats can expand into as sea levels rise. Such areas constitute climate change refugia and can potentially better protect biodiversity than more fragile areas. They may also provide fishery benefits, since habitat loss from climate change is a major fishery threat.

=== Local practices ===
Local practices such as overfishing, blast fishing, trawling, coastal development and pollution threaten many marine habitats. These threats decrease ecosystem health and productivity and adversely affect focal and other species. Such practices can also decrease resilience. Some practices that originate beyond reserve boundaries (e.g., runoff) can be mitigated by considering their impacts within broader management frameworks. Areas that are not threatened by such practices and that are adjacent to other unthreatening areas may be better choices for reserves.

== Networks ==
Networks of marine reserves can support both fisheries management and biodiversity conservation. The size, spacing and location of reserves within a network must respect larval dispersal and movement patterns of species that are targeted for protection.

=== Design ===
Existing ecological guidelines for designing networks independently focus on achieving either fisheries, biodiversity or climate change objectives or combinations of fisheries and biodiversity or biodiversity and climate change. These three goals have different implications for network design. The most important are reserve size and protection duration (permanent, long term, short term, or periodic closures).

==== Diversity ====
Maintaining diversity involves protecting all species. Generally this involves protecting adequate examples of each major habitat (e.g., each type of coral reef, mangrove and seagrass community). Resiliency to threats improves when multiple examples of each habitat are protected.

To address biodiversity or climate change, reserves 4–20 km across are recommended, because they protect larger populations of more species.

=== Climate change ===
Protecting areas that have already proven resilient to ecological changes and/or are relatively well-protected by other protocols are likely to better survive climate change as well.

==== Fisheries ====
Reserves 0.5–1 km across export more adults and larvae to fished areas, potentially increasing recruitment and stock replenishment there. Such small reserves are common in the Coral Triangle, where they benefited some fisheries.

=== Connectivity ===
Connectivity is the linking of local populations through the (voluntary) dispersal of individuals. Connected reserves are close enough to each other that larvae, juveniles or adults can cross from one to another as their behavior patterns dictate. Connectivity is a key factor in network design, since it allows a disturbed reserve to recover by recruiting individuals from other, potentially overpopulated, reserves. Effective networks spaced reserves at distances of &lt;15 km from each other, with smaller reserves spaced more closely.

Most coastal fish species have a bipartite life cycle where larvae are pelagic before settling out of the plankton to live on a reef. While these fish travel varying distances during their life history, their larvae have the potential to move tens to hundreds of km, more than the more sedentary adults and juveniles, which have home ranges of &lt;1 m to a few km. Adults and juveniles of some species travel tens to hundreds of kilometers as they mature to reach appropriate habitats (e.g., such as coral reef, mangrove and seagrass habitats) or to migrate to spawning areas. When adults and juveniles leave a marine reserve, they become vulnerable to fishing. However, larvae can generally leave a reserve without elevated risk because of their small size and limited fishery exposure. Effective networks account for the movement patterns of target species at each life cycle stage.

Given a strong, consistent current, siting marine reserves upstream increases downstream populations.

== Other protected marine categories ==
Marine reserves are distinct from marine parks, and marine sanctuaries, but there is some overlap in usage.

== Open ocean reserves ==
As of April 2008 no high seas marine reserves had been established. Greenpeace is campaigning for the &quot;doughnut holes&quot; of the western pacific to be declared as marine reserves and for 40 percent of the world&#x27;s oceans to be so protected.

<doc id="1032983" wikidata="Q6965592" url="?curid=1032983" title="Narbonic">
<text>Narbonic is a webcomic written and drawn by Shaenon K. Garrity. The storylines center on the misadventures of the staff of the fictional Narbonic Labs, which is the domain of mad scientist Helen Narbon. The strip started on July 31, 2000, and finished on December 31, 2006. On January 1, 2007, Garrity launched the &quot;Director&#x27;s Cut&quot;, an &quot;annotated replay&quot; of &quot;Narbonic&quot;. &quot;Narbonic&quot; was part of the subscription-based Modern Tales website for several years but moved to Webcomics Nation in July 2006, where it resumed being free-to-read. The comic is also a member of The Nice comics collective.

==About the strip==
Narbonic is drawn entirely by hand and presented in the style of the traditional American four-panel newspaper strip. It centers upon the adventures of computer programmer Dave Davenport, superintelligent gerbil RT-5478 (or &quot;Artie&quot;), evil intern Mell W. Kelly, and mad geneticist Helen Beta Narbon. While the strip is essentially an ensemble piece, with storylines focusing on major and minor characters alike, Dave occupies the role of protagonist more often than any other character.

As one of the few characters with a semblance of normality, the blandly cynical Dave Davenport has traditionally provided a convenient source of identification and emotional connection for the audience. In this strip&#x27;s world, however, such a person is a natural target for misfortune. As a result, Dave suffers more calamity than any of the other characters, having been killed, sent to Hell, shot to the Moon, transported helplessly through time, sent on a road trip with dozens of identical android fugitives, and experimented upon without his consent (repeatedly).

The strip uses the Mad Scientist trope as its premise, hearkening back to &quot;Sappo&quot; by Elzie Segar and the inventions of Rube Goldberg in theme. &quot;Mad scientist&quot; is a job description, and henchmen are unionized. The insane, pseudoscientific inventions and experiments of Helen Narbon and her nemesis and romantic crush, Professor Lupin Madblood, become the springboards for plotlines as the Narbonics Labs staff tries to deal with their consequences. These range from a revolution fomented by insane gerbils to Helen&#x27;s mother murdering Dave with one of Helen&#x27;s own death rays to a battle with the legions of Hell during a sleepover.

===Allusions===
Narbonic contains many allusions to an eclectic array of literary and film works, ranging from cult movie classics to Victorian Era science fiction. The reference may be as short as a single strip, or the basis for an entire story-arc, but recognition is never a prerequisite for understanding the strip.

Narbonic makes few references to other webcomics, even though this is a fairly common activity within the community. For example, in the story arc &quot;The End&quot;, Helen starts making up excuses to leave Dave. The four she gave were that her father killed himself in front of her, her college fiancé tried to rape her, she had Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, and she suffered &quot;a tragic miscarriage&quot;; references to, respectively, Faye in &quot;Questionable Content&quot;, Ki in &quot;General Protection Fault&quot;, Davan&#x27;s father in &quot;Something Positive&quot; and Lilah in &quot;Ctrl+Alt+Del&quot;. Two of the rare occasions on which other webcomics make an appearance are as follows. First, at the end of the initial story arc, a news report implies that most of Helen&#x27;s escaped giant ur-gerbils were slaughtered by Bun-Bun of Sluggy Freelance (with news reaction by Melonpool&#x27;s Sammy the Hammy). Second, at the end of the Doppelganger Gambit arc, Garrity draws, in the background of a bar scene, the cast of the webcomic 1/0 in the human forms they received at that strip&#x27;s end.

==Major characters==

===Helen B. Narbon, a.k.a. &quot;Beta&quot;===
The mad scientist who runs Narbonic Labs, Helen is cheerful, optimistic, and, definitionally, quite insane. Her favorite attire is a labcoat worn over jean shorts and a T-shirt reading &quot;evil&quot;, with the &quot;i&quot; dotted by a pink heart. Though Helen&#x27;s gerbil fixation is prominently featured in the strip, her well-justified fear that she will someday become identical to her mother, of whom she is a clone, may more deeply motivate her actions. It is, perhaps, this fear that feeds her second major scientific fascination: the biological underpinnings of mad genius.

Eventually, it is revealed that Helen has embarked on an ambitious research project to study just this question. Published under a pseudonym and known to the general mad science community only as the Tinasky Study (a probable allusion to Wanda Tinasky), Helen&#x27;s project is a detailed, covert study of a &quot;pre-mad&quot; mad genius, who happens to be none other than her faithful technician, Dave Davenport.

===Mell Kelly===
Helen&#x27;s evil intern Melody Wildflower Kelly has long, dark hair and glasses, and usually wears an off-the-shoulder top, a skirt, and tights. While she begins her employment with few evil skills, save a flair for treachery and a rather terrifying passion for weaponry, she eventually learns the value of foresight and planning. By shifting her focus to the subtler fields of evil, such as law and politics, she soon grows into an effective villainess in her own right. Despite a generally upbeat personality, Mell is actually an extremely dangerous person, and she is shown to have only one shoulder angel (whereas Helen and Dave each have several). All it does is quietly chant &quot;Kill... kill... kill...&quot; in her ear.

===Dave Davenport===
Helen&#x27;s computer technician, who is recruited directly from Vassar College&#x27;s graduation ceremony to fix a malfunctioning doomsday machine. Bespectacled, beflanneled, and bearded, and 6&#x27;1&quot; when he isn&#x27;t slouching, Dave Davenport is an unrepentant geek who generally expects the worst. Working at Narbonic Labs does little to correct this pessimism.

For much of the strip&#x27;s run, Dave is a chain-smoker, but his attempts to change his past, present and future when one of Helen&#x27;s experiments make him &quot;come unstuck in time&quot; result in his never having begun to smoke. This excursion to the past also offers Dave an opportunity to grapple with his own shortcomings, and thus gain the confidence he needs to approach Helen romantically. The romantic tension between Helen and Dave, and the conflict that results from Helen&#x27;s attempts to experiment upon him unawares, provide a continuous story arc over most of the strip&#x27;s run.

Dave is eventually revealed to be a latent mad genius. Helen in fact suspected this during their first meeting when he fixed her doomsday device within minutes. She became sure of his potential when he successfully &quot;repaired&quot; a broken &quot;death ray&quot; that was in fact the console from a rusted mail-sorting machine. She then spent the next several years studying the development of his abilities by subjecting him to various experiments and continuous on-the-job testing (giving him plenty of junk to repair and telling him it&#x27;s broken super-science gear). The final two story arcs revolve around the consequences of his mind finally snapping.

===Artie, a.k.a. RT-5478===
A superintelligent gerbil, created by Helen to do her taxes (although the author says that is merely an excuse and the real reason is that it would be cute), with the I.Q. of 1.17 Stephen Hawkings. Artie tends to be the outsider of the group, whether by virtue of being the lone voice of sanity among a crew of obsessives, the lone good soul among a crew of the wicked, or just the lone gerbil among a crew of humans. An ordained Unitarian Universalist minister and a Green Party member, Artie is a vocal proponent of nonviolence. An episode in which Helen transmogrifies him into human form destabilized his phenotype, and as a result, he now shifts between his original gerbil form and the form of a very tall, attractive, young gay black man with the voice of Ted Koppel. He has a (presumably unrequited) crush on forensic linguist Antonio Smith (see below).

==Hidden Story: Octavius Winter==
Octavius Winter was the Narbon family&#x27;s Evil Attorney during Helen Beta&#x27;s college years. The storyline in which he appears is told within the filenames of the image files Monday through Saturday. The filenames consist of the date (in mmddyy format) and a few words of the story. Garrity&#x27;s practice of adding additional words at the end of daily strips begins with the strip for August 17, 2002, near the end of the &quot;Dave Vs. Dave&quot; storyline; the story itself begins with the November 12th strip, during &quot;Class Reunion.&quot;

==&quot;The Astonishing Excursions of Helen Narbon &amp; Co.&quot;==
A long-running secondary storyline exists, featuring the Victorian Helen Narbon and her friends (and enemies) engaged in various steampunk exploits. Shaenon (who here identifies herself as &quot;S. K. Garrity&quot;) credits influence from &quot;the kind suggestions of Mr. Mark Schumann.&quot; It is drawn in rotation with the regular strip and the various other &quot;Narbonic&quot; creations (listed farther down).

Unlike the regular strip, &quot;Excursions&quot; is presented in brownscale sepia to add to the antique flavor. It is probable that the cast of this storyline are all the progenitors of the regular strip&#x27;s cast: while dead, Dave meets the ghosts of an earlier Helen and Mell, who are physically identical (except for their ghost tails) to, and dress the same as, the cast of &quot;Excursions&quot;. Another suggestion that it is the forerunner of &quot;Narbonic&quot; is that in one episode, Helen finds &quot;the old family artificial gravity formula&quot; - something that does indeed appear in &quot;Excursions&quot;.

Garrity had planned on doing another storyline with Silver Age superhero versions of the characters (note the superhero costumes among the paper-doll outfits), but &quot;Excursions&quot; ended up lasting until the end of Narbonic&#x27;s run.

==Outside the plot line==
Narbonic&#x27;s Sundays are dedicated to features other than whatever the characters are up to in the present plot arc. Other features (some regular, others sporadic) make up a large component of Narbonic history and some even have direct bearing on the storyline. These include:

*Reader art
*Mailbag
*Contests
**Haiku
**Create a caption for a cartoon
**Narbonic T-shirt
**Give Dave a last name
**Give MIT student Dave Barker (an enemy of the strip) a new title (following graduation)
*The Narbonic Coloring Book, featuring
**Connect the dots (of Mell&#x27;s gun)
**Paint by numbers (Helen and some living pink goo)
**Draw lines between two lists of animals (the second list is entirely &quot;&quot;)
**Crossword
*Fan fiction
*Down with the artist - a series of protests by the characters against the management of Shaenon.

==Reception==
Shaenon Garrity was nominated for &quot;Best New Talent&quot; in the 2001 Friends of Lulu awards. In 2005 she won their &quot;Lulu of the Year.&quot; Garrity also won the 2005 Web Cartoonist Choice Award for &quot;Outstanding Writer.&quot; Scott McCloud listed her as one of his 20 favorite web cartoonists in July 2004, saying, &quot;Garrity is emerging as one of our best online humor writers.&quot;

==Li&#x27;l Mell and Sergio==
&quot;Li&#x27;l Mell and Sergio&quot; is a prequel of sorts to &quot;Narbonic&quot;, featuring the grade school exploits of a hyperactive and violent young girl named Melody Kelly, or &quot;Mell&quot;, and her friend and classmate Sergio, a brilliant young boy with low self-esteem. It is published on the anthology site Girlamatic, and written by Garrity and drawn by a succession of artists, including Vera Brosgol, Bill Mudron, Andrew Farago, Neil Babra and Garrity herself. There is no evidence or mention of Sergio in Narbonic continuity, despite previous comics of her mentioned, including the comic that Dave and Mel both first appeared in. (Helen&#x27;s comic is also linked on her site.) However, Artie makes a cameo in human form. https://web.archive.org/web/20091205035512/http://girlamatic.com/mell/2000/01/01/page-seven/ This is explained further in Narbonic: Volume Six&#x27;s bonus story.

Sergio did later appear in Garrity&#x27;s subsequent comic, Skin Horse, which is set in the same mad science world as Narbonic.

<text>The Italian Hall disaster (sometimes referred to as the 1913 Massacre) was a tragedy that occurred on Wednesday, December 24, 1913, in Calumet, Michigan, United States. Seventy-three people – mostly striking mine workers and their families – were crushed to death in a stampede when someone falsely shouted &quot;fire&quot; at a crowded Christmas party.

==Background==
The Calumet and Hecla Mining Company (C&amp;H) was the single largest copper mining company in the Copper Country of northwest Michigan&#x27;s Keweenaw Peninsula. One of the longest strikes in the Copper Country occurred in 1913 and included all the C&amp;H mines. The Western Federation of Miners (WFM) first established a local in the area in 1908. Still, the WFM did not have a large enough membership to strike effectively until 1913.

At the time, there were perhaps 15,000 men working in the mines, of which the WFM claimed 9,000 as members. The membership voted in favor of demanding union recognition from management and asking &quot;for a conference with the employers to adjust wages, hours, and working conditions in the copper district of Michigan.&quot; The membership also voted to &quot;declare a strike&quot; if management refused to &quot;grant a conference or concessions.&quot; After the vote was held, the WFM sent letters to the mines demanding the conference; the mine managers refused the request, and the strike was called on July 23, 1913. The strike would not end until April 1914; the miners and the mines were still at a standoff at Christmas 1913, in a strike that was then five months old.

==Disaster==
On Christmas Eve, many of the striking miners and their families had gathered for a holiday party sponsored by the WFM&#x27;s Ladies Auxiliary. The party was held on the second floor of Calumet&#x27;s Italian Hall. A steep stairway was the only way to the second floor. However, there was a poorly-marked fire escape on one side of the building and ladders down the back of the building, which could be reached only by climbing through the windows. The incident began when over four hundred people were in the room, and someone came to the front door and yelled, &quot;Fire!&quot; although there was none.

However, attendees panicked and rushed for the stairs. In the ensuing stampede, 73 people (including 59 children) were killed. The dead comprised 50 Finnish Americans, 13 Croats, seven Slovenes and three Italians. To date, there has been much debate about who cried &quot;fire&quot; and why. It is conjectured by some historians and the singer-songwriter Woody Guthrie that an anti-union ally of mine management called out &quot;fire&quot; to disrupt the party.


There were several investigations into the disaster. In the coroner&#x27;s inquest, witnesses who did not speak English were forced to answer questions in English. Most witnesses were not asked follow-up questions. It appears that many persons called to testify had not seen what happened. After three days, the coroner issued a ruling that did not give a cause of death.

Early in 1914, a subcommittee of the U.S. House of Representatives came to the Copper Country to investigate the strike and took sworn testimony from witnesses for a full day on March 7, 1914. Twenty witnesses testified under oath and were offered interpreters. Eight witnesses swore that the man who first raised the cry of &quot;fire&quot; was wearing a button on his coat for Citizens&#x27; Alliance, an organization that opposed trade unions and strikes.

A common story regarding the tragedy states that the doors at the bottom of the Italian Hall&#x27;s stairs opened inward. According to the story, when the fleeing partygoers reached the bottom of the stairs, they pressed up against the doors, preventing them from opening and causing many people to be crushed. However, all photos of the doors suggest a double set of doors with both sets opening outward. Steve Lehto&#x27;s book &quot;Death&#x27;s Door: The Truth Behind Michigan&#x27;s Largest Mass Murder&quot; pointed out that the doors were not mentioned as a contributing factor at the December 1913 coroner&#x27;s inquest, the 1914 subcommittee hearing, or in any of the newspaper stories of the time. That book also included blueprints of the Italian Hall drawn by an architect, showing the locations and configurations of the doors, the staircase, and the landings. 

In her book &quot;Mine Towns&quot;, Alison K. Hoagland alleges there were two sets of doors opening onto a vestibule, and that the outer doors opened outward; and there may have been a set of inner bifold doors. In support of this, Hoagland notes that a &quot;newspaper article at the time of its dedication mentioned safety features such as &#x27;the ample main stairway&#x27;, two fire escapes, and &#x27;All doors open outward.&#x27;&quot; She notes that the club had previously been cited—for the predecessor building—for having doors that opened inward. Further, she opines that the foreshortened stereopticon photo was &quot;impossible&quot; and misleading; and further notes that, according to the &quot;pro-company&quot; &quot;Daily Mining Gazette&quot;, they opened out.

==Aftermath==
After the initial wave of grief had passed following the incident, while there was bitterness against C&amp;H, it was considerably greater against the Citizens&#x27; Alliance (the &quot;Alliance&quot;), which opposed the union and the strike. It was widely believed that the man who had yelled &quot;fire&quot; was wearing an Alliance badge, and WFM president Charles Moyer—who publicized the accusation—refused to retract it. 

A relief committee made up of Alliance members collected $25,000 to aid the families affected by the disaster. The bereaved families would not accept the committee&#x27;s money, saying that the WFM had promised them aid. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Alliance members who served on the relief committee learned that Moyer had forbidden them from taking the funds. The committee members visited Moyer at his hotel in nearby Hancock, shot and kidnapped him, then placed him on a train with instructions to leave Michigan and never return. After getting medical attention in Chicago, Moyer held a press conference where he displayed his gunshot wound and promised to return to Michigan to continue the work of the WFM.

The Italian Hall was demolished in October 1984 and only the archway remains, although a state historical marker was erected in 1987. The site is a park maintained by the Keweenaw National Historical Park. The marker incorrectly stated at first that the tragedy was partially caused by inward-opening doors; this error was later removed.

Ella Reeve Bloor was present at the disaster and wrote her version in her autobiography. Her telling is problematic. She claims she was near the stage when the panic occurred, but no witnesses ever testified to her presence. Some critics claim Bloor&#x27;s version of events in Calumet in 1913 is untrustworthy. Bloor claimed that Big Annie Clemenc led the funeral procession for the victims carrying a &quot;red flag&quot;, although all other accounts say that it was an American flag.

The event was memorialized by Woody Guthrie in the song &quot;1913 Massacre&quot;, which claims the doors were held shut on the outside by &quot;the copper boss&#x27; thug men.&quot;

The disaster generated a fair amount of scholarly debate. Historian Arthur Thurner&#x27;s &quot;Rebels on the Range: The Michigan Copper Miners&#x27; Strike of 1913–1914&quot; raises the possibility that there actually might have been a fire in another part of the hall, perhaps in the chimney of the building. Perhaps the strongest argument against an actual fire is that none of the investigations found any witnesses who would claim there was a fire. The fire log of the Red Jacket Fire Department (the local fire department that responded to the fire call) also specifically states &quot;no fire.&quot;

&quot;Death&#x27;s Door: The Truth Behind Michigan&#x27;s Largest Mass Murder&quot;, by Steve Lehto, first published in 2006, concludes that the culprit was most likely an ally of mine management. Lehto did not identify in the first edition of the book the specific person who yelled &quot;fire&quot;, but he did exhaustively examine news reports, transcripts of interviews with survivors, the coroner&#x27;s reports, and other documentation in an attempt to answer the question of whether this was a deliberate act by the mine management or a tragic error. In the second edition of &quot;Death&#x27;s Door&quot;, published in 2013, Lehto identifies the man he believes cried &quot;fire&quot;, going so far as to give the man&#x27;s name and occupation, as well as evidence to support the claim.

The 2019 novel &quot;Women of the Copper Country&quot;, by Maria Doria Russell includes a fictionalized account of the event and a background of the strike.

<doc id="1032989" wikidata="Q45125" url="?curid=1032989" title="Kitaro Nishida">
<text>was a Japanese moral 
philosopher, philosopher of mathematics and science, and religious scholar. He was the founder of what has been called the Kyoto School of philosophy. He graduated from the University of Tokyo during the Meiji period in 1894 with a degree in philosophy. He was named professor of the Fourth Higher School in Ishikawa Prefecture in 1899 and later became professor of philosophy at Kyoto University. Nishida retired in 1927. In 1940, he was awarded the Order of Culture (文化勲章, &quot;bunka kunshō&quot;). He participated in establishing the Chiba Institute of Technology (千葉工業大学) from 1940.

Nishida Kitarō died at the age of 75 of a renal infection. His cremated remains were divided in three and buried at different locations. Part of his remains were buried in the Nishida family grave in his birthplace Unoke, Ishikawa. A second grave can be found at Tōkei-ji Temple in Kamakura, where his friend D. T. Suzuki organized Nishida&#x27;s funeral and was later also buried in the adjacent plot. Nishida&#x27;s third grave is at Reiun&#x27;in (霊雲院, &quot;Reiun&#x27;in&quot;), a temple in the Myōshin-ji compound in Kyoto.

==Philosophy==
Being born in the third year of the Meiji period, Nishida was presented with a new, unique opportunity to contemplate Eastern philosophical issues in the fresh light that Western philosophy shone on them. Nishida&#x27;s original and creative philosophy, incorporating ideas of Zen and Western philosophy, was aimed at bringing the East and West closer. Throughout his lifetime, Nishida published a number of books and essays including &quot;An Inquiry into the Good&quot; and &quot;The Logic of the Place of Nothingness and the Religious Worldview&quot;. Taken as a whole, Nishida&#x27;s life work was the foundation for the Kyoto School of philosophy and the inspiration for the original thinking of his disciples.

One of the most famous concepts in Nishida&#x27;s philosophy is the logic of &quot;basho&quot; (Japanese: 場所; usually translated as &quot;place&quot; or &quot;&quot;), a non-dualistic concrete logic, meant to overcome the inadequacy of the subject-object distinction essential to the subject logic of Aristotle and the predicate logic of Immanuel Kant, through the affirmation of what he calls the &quot;absolutely contradictory self-identity&quot;, a dynamic tension of opposites that, unlike the dialectical logic of G.W.F. Hegel, does not resolve in a synthesis. Rather, it defines its proper subject by maintaining the tension between affirmation and negation as opposite poles or perspectives.

In David A. Dilworth&#x27;s survey of Nishida&#x27;s works, he did not mention the debut book, &quot;An Inquiry into the Good&quot;. There, Nishida writes about experience, reality, good and religion. He argues that the most profound form of experience is the pure experience. Nishida analyzes the thought, the will, the intellectual intuition, and the pure experience among them. According to Nishida&#x27;s vision as well as to the essence of Asian wisdom, one craves harmony in experience, for unity.

==Legacy==
According to Masao Abe, &quot;During World War II right-wing thinkers attacked him as antinationalistic for his appreciation of Western philosophy and logic. But after the war left-wing thinkers criticized his philosophy as nationalistic because of his emphasis on the traditional notion of &quot;nothingness&quot;. He recognized a kind of universality in Western philosophy and logic but did not accept that it was the only universality.&quot;

<text>A gas centrifuge is a device that performs isotope separation of gases. A centrifuge relies on the principles of centrifugal force accelerating molecules so that particles of different masses are physically separated in a gradient along the radius of a rotating container. A prominent use of gas centrifuges is for the separation of uranium-235 (235U) from uranium-238 (238U). The gas centrifuge was developed to replace the gaseous diffusion method of 235U extraction. High degrees of separation of these isotopes relies on using many individual centrifuges arranged in series that achieve successively higher concentrations. This process yields higher concentrations of 235U while using significantly less energy compared to the gaseous diffusion process.

== History ==
Suggested in 1919, the centrifugal process was first successfully performed in 1934. American scientist Jesse Beams and his team at the University of Virginia developed the process by separating two chlorine isotopes through a vacuum ultracentrifuge. It was one of the initial isotopic separation means pursued during the Manhattan Project, more particularly by Harold Urey and Karl P. Cohen, but research was discontinued in 1944 as it was felt that the method would not produce results by the end of the war, and that other means of uranium enrichment (gaseous diffusion and electromagnetic separation) had a better chance of success in the short term. This method was successfully used in the Soviet nuclear program, making the Soviet Union the most effective supplier of enriched uranium. Franz Simon, Rudolf Peierls, Klaus Fuchs and Nicholas Kurti made important contributions to the centrifugal process. 

Paul Dirac made important theoretical contributions to the centrifugal process during World War II; Dirac developed the fundamental theory of separation processes that underlies the design and analysis of modern uranium enrichment plants. In the long term, especially with the development of the Zippe-type centrifuge, the gas centrifuge has become a very economical mode of separation, using considerably less energy than other methods and having numerous other advantages.

Research in the physical performance of centrifuges was carried out by the Pakistani scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan in the 1970s–80s, using vacuum methods for advancing the role of centrifuges in the development of nuclear fuel for Pakistan&#x27;s atomic bomb. Many of the theorists working with Khan were unsure that either gaseous and enriched uranium would be feasible on time. One scientist recalled: &quot;No one in the world has used the [gas] centrifuge method to produce military-grade uranium... This was not going to work. He was simply wasting time.&quot; In spite of skepticism, the program was quickly proven to be feasible. Enrichment via centrifuge has been used in experimental physics, and the method was smuggled to at least three different countries by the end of the 20th century.

== Centrifugal process ==
The centrifuge relies on the force resulting from centrifugal acceleration to separate molecules according to their mass and can be applied to most fluids. The dense (heavier) molecules move towards the wall, and the lighter ones remain close to the center. The centrifuge consists of a rigid body rotor rotating at full period at high speed. Concentric gas tubes located on the axis of the rotor are used to introduce feed gas into the rotor and extract the heavier and lighter separated streams. For 235U production, the heavier stream is the waste stream and the lighter stream is the product stream. Modern Zippe-type centrifuges are tall cylinders spinning on a vertical axis. A vertical temperature gradient can be applied to create a convective circulation rising in the center and descending at the periphery of the centrifuge. Such a countercurrent flow can also be stimulated mechanically by the scoops that take out the enriched and depleted fractions. Diffusion between these opposing flows increases the separation by the principle of countercurrent multiplication.

In practice, since there are limits to how tall a single centrifuge can be made, several such centrifuges are connected in series. Each centrifuge receives one input line and produces two output lines, corresponding to light and heavy fractions. The input of each centrifuge is the product stream of the previous centrifuge. This produces an almost pure light fraction from the product stream of the last centrifuge and an almost pure heavy fraction from the waste stream of the first centrifuge.

==Gas centrifugation process==

The gas centrifugation process uses a unique design that allows gas to constantly flow in and out of the centrifuge. Unlike most centrifuges which rely on batch processing, the gas centrifuge uses continuous processing, allowing cascading in which multiple identical processes occur in succession. The gas centrifuge consists of a cylindrical rotor, a casing, an electric motor, and three lines for material to travel. The gas centrifuge is designed with a casing that completely encloses the centrifuge. The cylindrical rotor is located inside the casing, which is evacuated of all air to produce a near frictionless rotation when operating. The motor spins the rotor, creating the centrifugal force on the components as they enter the cylindrical rotor. This force acts to separate the molecules of the gas, with heavier molecules moving towards the wall of the rotor and the lighter molecules towards the central axis. There are two output lines, one for the fraction enriched in the desired isotope (in uranium separation, this is 235U), and one depleted of that isotope. The output lines take these separations to other centrifuges to continue the centrifugation process. The process begins when the rotor is balanced in three stages. Most of the technical details on gas centrifuges are difficult to obtain because they are shrouded in &quot;nuclear secrecy&quot;.

The early gas centrifuges used in the UK used an alloy body wrapped in epoxy-impregnated glass fibre. Dynamic balancing of the assembly was accomplished by adding small traces of epoxy at the locations indicated by the balancing test unit. The motor was usually a pancake type located at the bottom of the cylinder. The early units were typically around 2 metres long, but subsequent developments gradually increased the length. The present generation are over 4 metres in length. The bearings are gas-based devices, as mechanical bearings would not survive at the normal operating speeds of these centrifuges.

A section of centrifuges would be fed with variable-frequency alternating current from an electronic (bulk) inverter, which would slowly ramp them up to the required speed, generally in excess of 50,000 rpm. One precaution was to quickly get past frequencies at which the cylinder was known to suffer resonance problems. The inverter is a high-frequency unit capable of operating at frequencies around 1 kilohertz. The whole process is normally silent; if a noise is heard coming from a centrifuge, it is a warning of failure (which normally occurs very quickly). The design of the cascade normally allows for the failure of at least one centrifuge unit without compromising the operation of the cascade. The units are normally very reliable, with early models having operated continuously for over 30 years.

Later models have steadily increased the rotation speed of the centrifuges, as it is the velocity of the centrifuge wall that has the most effect on the separation efficiency. A feature of the cascade system of centrifuges is that it is possible to increase plant throughput incrementally, by adding cascade &quot;blocks&quot; to the existing installation at suitable locations, rather than having to install a completely new line of centrifuges.

===Concurrent and countercurrent centrifuges ===

The simplest gas centrifuge is the concurrent centrifuge, where separative effect is produced by the centrifugal effects of the rotor&#x27;s rotation. In these centrifuges, the heavy fraction is collected at the periphery of the rotor and the light fraction from nearer the axis of rotation.

Inducing a countercurrent flow uses countercurrent multiplication to enhance the separative effect. A vertical circulating current is set up, with the gas flowing axially along the rotor walls in one direction and a return flow closer to the center of the rotor. The centrifugal separation continues as before (heavier molecules preferentially moving outwards), which means that the heavier molecules are collected by the wall flow, and the lighter fraction collects at the other end. In a centrifuge with downward wall flow, the heavier molecules collect at the bottom. The outlet scoops are then placed at the ends of the rotor cavity, with the feed mixture injected along the axis of the cavity (ideally, the injection point is at the point where the mixture in the rotor is equal to the feed).

This countercurrent flow can be induced mechanically or thermally, or a combination. In mechanically induced countercurrent flow, the arrangement of the (stationary) scoops and internal rotor structures are used to generate the flow. A scoop interacts with the gas by slowing it, which tends to draw it into the centre of the rotor. The scoops at each end induce opposing currents, so one scoop is protected from the flow by a &quot;baffle&quot;: a perforated disc within the rotor which rotates along with the gas—at this end of the rotor, the flow will be outwards, towards the rotor wall. Thus, in a centrifuge with a baffled top scoop, the wall flow is downwards, and heavier molecules are collected at the bottom. Thermally induced convection currents can be created by heating the bottom of the centrifuge and/or cooling the top end.

===Separative work units===
The separative work unit (SWU) is a measure of the amount of work done by the centrifuge and has units of mass (typically &quot;kilogram separative work unit&quot;). The work formula_1 necessary to separate a mass formula_2 of feed of assay formula_3 into a mass formula_4 of product assay formula_5, and tails of mass formula_6 and assay formula_7 is expressed in terms of the number of separative work units needed, given by the expression

:formula_8
:where formula_9 is the value function, defined as
:formula_10

===Practical application of centrifugation===

====Separation of uranium-235 from uranium-238====
The separation of uranium requires the material in a gaseous form; uranium hexafluoride (UF6) is used for uranium enrichment. Upon entering the centrifuge cylinder, the UF6 gas is rotated at a high speed. The rotation creates a strong centrifugal force that draws more of the heavier gas molecules (containing the 238U) toward the wall of the cylinder, while the lighter gas molecules (containing the 235U) tend to collect closer to the center. The stream that is slightly enriched in 235U is withdrawn and fed into the next higher stage, while the slightly depleted stream is recycled back into the next lower stage.

====Separation of zinc isotopes====
For some uses in nuclear technology, the content of zinc-64 (64Zn) in zinc metal has to be lowered in order to prevent formation of radioisotopes by its neutron activation. Diethyl zinc is used as the gaseous feed medium for the centrifuge cascade. An example of a resulting material is depleted zinc oxide, used as a corrosion inhibitor.

<doc id="1032999" wikidata="Q1239004" url="?curid=1032999" title="Humphreys Peak">
<text>Humphreys Peak (, &quot;its summit never melts&quot;) is the highest mountain and the second most prominent peak after Mount Graham in the U.S. state of Arizona. With an elevation of , it is located within the Kachina Peaks Wilderness in the Coconino National Forest, about north of Flagstaff, Arizona. Humphreys Peak is the highest of a group of dormant volcanic peaks known as the San Francisco Peaks.

Humphreys Peak was named in about 1870 for General Andrew A. Humphreys, a U.S. Army officer who was a Union general during the American Civil War, and who later became Chief of Engineers of the United States Army Corps of Engineers. However, a United States General Land Office map from 1903 showed the name &quot;San Francisco Peak&quot; applied to this feature (apparently borrowed from San Francisco Mountain on which the peak stands). Thus the United States Board on Geographic Names approved the variant name in 1911. In 1933, the application of the names was rectified.
==Geology==
Humphreys Peak is a dormant volcano that rises from the San Francisco Volcanic Field. A gravity induced landslide or blast eruption similar to the 1980 eruptions of Mt St. Helens created the large open-bowl shape on the eastern half of the mountain. Before this collapse, the USGS estimated the volcano could have been 15,000 to 16,000 feet in elevation. During the ice ages of the Pleistocene Epoch, small glaciers carved narrow valleys just below the summit. Much of the mountain is composed of Trachyte, a gray volcanic rock.

==Climate==
The climate at the top of the mountain belongs to the dry-summer subarctic climate (Köppen: &quot;Dsc&quot;), close to the tundra climate (Köppen: &quot;ET&quot;), and the climate a little further down the mountainside is Hemiboreal climate (Köppen: &quot;Dsb&quot;) or warm dry-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csb&quot;). Six months of the year average temperatures below , and only July averages temperatures above . No month has a dew point higher than .

Due to its prominence and isolation, Mt Humphreys is often subject to lightning, especially during the monsoon months in the summer. Additionally, the upper half of the mountain is above the treeline and composed of steep rocks, making hikers more exposed to sudden changes in weather. In 2016, a 17-year-old hiker died and two other teens were injured after being struck by lightning on Humphreys Peak.


==Recreation==
The Arizona Snowbowl ski resort, which operates 8 lifts and 55 ski runs with a total vertical drop of 2,300 ft, is located on the western slope of Mount Humphrey.

Due to its proximity to Flagstaff and the US 180, the trail to the summit is relatively popular. In the summer, when there is no snow, the climb is relatively easy, being a strenuous, steep hike. In the winter, avalanche risk or blizzards is a possible hazard. The trail to the summit is 9 miles (14.5 kilometers) roundtrip with 3400 ft of elevation gain (1 km). The trailhead starts below the tree-line in a dense forest and ends well above the tree-line with unobstructed, 360 degree views, where the Grand Canyon can be seen in the distant north and Flagstaff just south.

<text>The &quot;Graveyard Poets&quot;, also termed &quot;Churchyard Poets&quot;, were a number of pre-Romantic poets of the 18th century characterised by their gloomy meditations on mortality, &quot;skulls and coffins, epitaphs and worms&quot; elicited by the presence of the graveyard. Moving beyond the elegy lamenting a single death, their purpose was rarely sensationalist. As the century progressed, &quot;graveyard&quot; poetry increasingly expressed a feeling for the &quot;sublime&quot; and uncanny, and an antiquarian interest in ancient English poetic forms and folk poetry. The &quot;graveyard poets&quot; are often recognized as precursors of the Gothic literary genre, as well as the Romantic movement.

==Overview==
The Graveyard School is an indefinite literary grouping that binds together a wide variety of authors; what makes a poem a &quot;graveyard&quot; poem remains open to critical dispute. At its narrowest, the term &quot;Graveyard School&quot; refers to four poems: Thomas Gray&#x27;s &quot;Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard&quot;, Thomas Parnell&#x27;s &quot;Night-Piece on Death&quot;, Robert Blair&#x27;s &quot;The Grave&quot; and Edward Young&#x27;s &quot;Night-Thoughts&quot;. At its broadest, it can describe a host of poetry and prose works popular in the early and mid-eighteenth century. The term itself was not used as a brand for the poets and their poetry until William Macneile Dixon did so in 1898.

Some literary critics have emphasized Milton&#x27;s minor poetry as the main influence of the meditative verse written by the Graveyard Poets. W. L. Phelps, for example, said: &quot;It was not so much in form as in thought that Milton affected the Romantic movement; and although &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; was always reverentially considered his greatest work, it was not at this time nearly so effective as his minor poetry; and in the latter it was &quot;Il Penseroso&quot; — the love of meditative comfortable melancholy — that penetrated most deeply into the Romantic soul&quot;. However, other critics like Raymond D. Havens, Harko de Maar and Eric Partridge have challenged the direct influence of Milton&#x27;s poem, claiming rather that graveyard poetry came from a culmination of literary precedents. As a result of the religious revival, the early eighteenth century was a time of both spiritual unrest and regeneration; therefore, meditation and melancholy, death and life, ghosts and graveyards, were attractive subjects to poets at that time. These subjects were, however, interesting to earlier poets as well. The Graveyard School&#x27;s melancholy was not new to English poetry, but rather a continuation of that of previous centuries; there is even an elegiac quality to the poems almost reminiscent of Anglo-Saxon literature. The characteristics and style of Graveyard poetry is not unique to them, and the same themes and tone are found in ballads and odes.

Many of the Graveyard School poets were, like Thomas Parnell, Christian clergymen, and as such they often wrote didactic poetry, combining aesthetics with religious and moral instruction. They were also inclined toward contemplating subjects related to life after death, which is reflected in how their writings focus on human mortality and man&#x27;s relation to the divine. The religious culture of the mid-eighteenth century included an emphasis on private devotion, as well as the end of printed funeral sermons. Each of these conditions demanded a new kind of text with which people could meditate on life and death in a personal setting. The Graveyard School met that need, and the poems were thus quite popular, especially with the middle class. For instance Elizabeth Singer Rowe&#x27;s &quot;Friendship in Death: In Twenty Letters from the Dead to the Living&quot;, published in 1728, had 27 editions printed by 1760. This popularity, as Parisot says, &quot;confirms the fashionable mid-century taste for mournful piety.&quot; Thomas Gray, who found inspiration in a churchyard, claimed to have a naturally melancholy spirit, writing in a letter that &quot;low spirits are my true and faithful companions; they get up with me, go to bed with me; make journeys and returns as I do; nay, and pay visits, and will even affect to be jocose, and force a feeble laugh with me; but most commonly we sit alone together, and are the prettiest insipid company in the world&quot;.

The works of the Graveyard School continued to be popular into the early 19th century and were instrumental in the development of the Gothic novel, contributing to the dark, mysterious mood and story lines that characterize the genre — Graveyard School writers focused their writings on the lives of ordinary and unidentified characters. They are also considered pre-Romanticists, ushering in the Romantic literary movement by their reflection on emotional states. This emotional reflection is seen in Coleridge&#x27;s &quot;&quot; and Keats&#x27; &quot;Ode on Melancholy&quot;. The early works of Southey, Byron and Shelley also show the influence of the Graveyard School.

==Criticism==
Many critics of Graveyard poetry had very little positive feedback for the poets and their work. Critic Amy Louise Reed called Graveyard poetry a disease, while other critics called many poems unoriginal, and said that the poets were better than their poetry. Although the majority of criticism about Graveyard poetry is negative, other critics thought differently, especially about poet Edward Young. Critic Isabell St. John Bliss also celebrates Edward Young’s ability to write his poetry in the style of the Graveyard School and at the same time include Christian themes, and Cecil V. Wicker called Young a forerunner in the Romantic movement and described his work as original. Eric Parisot claimed that fear is created as a spur to faith and that in Graveyard poetry, &quot;...it is only when we restore religion — to examine the various ways graveyard poetry exploited fear and melancholy — that we can fully grasp its enduring contribution to the Gothic...&quot;

==Poem samples==

The earliest poem attributed to the Graveyard School was Thomas Parnell&#x27;s &quot;A Night-Piece on Death&quot; (1721), in which King Death himself gives an address from his kingdom of bones:

:&quot;When men my scythe and darts supply
:How great a King of Fears am I!&quot; (61–62)

Characteristic later poems include Edward Young&#x27;s &quot;Night-Thoughts&quot; (1742), in which a lonely traveller in a graveyard reflects lugubriously on:

:The vale funereal, the sad cypress gloom;
:The land of apparitions, empty shades! (117–18)

Blair&#x27;s &quot;The Grave&quot; (1743) proves to be no more cheerful as it relates with grim relish how:

:Wild shrieks have issued from the hollow tombs;
:Dead men have come again, and walked about;
:And the great bell has tolled, unrung and untouched. (51–53)

However, a more contemplative mood is achieved in the celebrated opening verse of Gray&#x27;s &quot;Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard&quot; (1751):

:The curfew tolls the knell of parting day.
:The lowing herd wind slowly o&#x27;er the lea,
:The ploughman homeward plods his weary way,
:And leaves the world to darkness and to me. (1–4)

<doc id="1033005" wikidata="Q1142906" url="?curid=1033005" title="Cubanate">
<text>Cubanate are an English industrial band from London, England, founded in 1992 by Marc Heal and Graham Rayner with Phil Barry and Steve Etheridge. The group became well known for their combination of electro-industrial with distorted heavy metal guitars and techno percussion (later incorporating breakbeats).

==History==
===Initial career===
Graham Rayner originally used the name Cubanate for various one-off shows in the UK during the early 1990s. By 1992 however, the band&#x27;s lineup became solidified with Marc Heal, Phil Barry, and Steve Etheridge joining Rayner. They released a demo cassette in the summer of 1992, titled &quot;UK 92&quot;. It featured six songs which eventually found their way to the band&#x27;s full-length album. Cubanate played their first UK tour in November 1992 supporting leftfield UK techno duo Sheep on Drugs. The group signed to Berlin&#x27;s Dynamica Records shortly afterwards. The band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Antimatter&quot;, saw a UK release in 1993. After the release of the album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Body Burn&quot;, Rayner and Etheridge departed from the band in order to form K-Nitrate. The pair were replaced by Julian Beeston (former Nitzer Ebb drummer).

In early 1994, the band released the &quot;Metal&quot; EP which featured two new songs (&quot;Angeldust&quot; and &quot;Metal&quot;) plus a few &quot;Antimatter&quot; remixes. In May of that year, the &quot;Metal&quot; EP was Single of the Week in &quot;Melody Maker&quot; magazine. Later that year, Cubanate received media attention when they were weirdly paired with Carcass for what turned out to be a notoriously violent UK tour ending in death threats to Heal. There was also an on-air confrontation on the &quot;Radio One Rock Show&quot; with Bruce Dickinson. In 1995, &quot;Antimatter&quot; was belatedly released in the US with an altered tracklisting.

The second album &quot;Cyberia&quot; (1995) spawned the hit single &quot;Oxyacetylene&quot;. The album peaked at 3 on the CMJ RPM Chart in the U.S. For live work around the &quot;Cyberia&quot; tour the band hired Shep Ashton on guitar and Darren Bennett on keyboards. After 1996, Ashton and Bennett were replaced by Roddy Stone (currently fronting UK metal act Viking Skull) and David Bianchi (who later went on to become manager of rock bands The Enemy and Boy Kill Boy).

The third album, &quot;Barbarossa&quot; (1996) continued the crossover format, and despite being name-checked as influences by bands such as The Prodigy, the group decided a change was clearly needed.

Signed in the United States to Wax Trax! Recordings for the act&#x27;s fourth and final official full-length album to date, &quot;Interference&quot; (1998) was a departure from Cubanate&#x27;s earlier techno experiments with a strong drum and bass influence that alienated some of their traditionalist fans but was heralded as revelatory by others. The album was co-produced by Rhys Fulber.

===Early 2000s hiatus===

In 2004, a torrent appeared on the Internet with nine leaked demo tracks recorded by Heal in 2000 titled &quot;Search Engine&quot;. Featuring such tracks as &quot;Razor Edge&quot;, &quot;Superstructure&quot;, and &quot;Drowning Hands&quot; the material had been abandoned by Heal in 2000.

In October 2010, the band announced that they were recording again and would be releasing new material in 2011. A new track titled &quot;We Are Crowd&quot; was released on Alfa-Matrix&#x27;s compilation &quot;EBM1&quot;.

In a posting on his Facebook page dated 13 September 2011, Cubanate founder Marc Heal stated: &quot;Marc here. I should have posted this a while back, but I wanted to let everyone know that I have decided conclusively not to do another Cubanate album. It was a real blast getting back into studio with Phil – and he came up with some brilliant music. But I&#x27;m doing something different with my life now and I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion to leave it. Thanks for all your support, I really appreciate it. I&#x27;ll keep posting. M&quot;.

Both Heal and Barry have released solo work since that announcement.

===Reunion===
On 24 September 2016, Cubanate reformed to play the Cold Waves Festival (an annual industrial music festival held in Chicago, Illinois, United States) with members Marc Heal, Phil Barry and Vince McAley (variously from Dead on TV, GoFight and Die Warzau). The festival lineup included The Cocks (ex-Revolting Cocks members: Richard 23, Luc van Acker, Chris Connelly &amp; Paul Barker), &lt;PIG&gt;, 16Volt, Dead When I Found Her, Bloody Knives, and Kanga, many of whom had previously collaborated with Heal in projects such as Pigface and C-Tec. The band returned to Cold Waves for its first Los Angeles event in November 2017.

On 5 May 2017, Cubanate released a compilation album titled &quot;Brutalism&quot; via Armalyte Industries, featuring 14 remastered songs from Cubanate&#x27;s first three albums.

In 2019, Cubanate released &quot;Kolossus&quot;, their first new material since 1998.

==Musical style and legacy==
Cubanate has been described often as electro-industrial. AllMusic wrote that the band &quot;have explored the hybrid style created by mixing industrial music with the high-speed rhythms of techno&quot;. The band also has included elements of industrial metal in some songs, with vocals similar to the vocals of Lemmy Kilmister of heavy metal band Motörhead.

During their heyday, Cubanate&#x27;s fusion of techno and rock stirred both controversy and influence, with their impact continuing to echo in the present. As one of the rare UK bands labeled &#x27;Industrial&#x27; to break into the mainstream, they frequently appeared in a wide range of publications, from Kerrangg! to Melody Maker, where they earned multiple &quot;Single of the Week&quot; honors in each. They also featured on MTV&#x27;s Headbanger&#x27;s Ball and shared the stage with notable acts like Front 242, Gary Numan, Rammstein, The Sisters of Mercy, and Front Line Assembly.

&quot;Oxyacetylene&quot; was featured on the 1996 compilation album, &quot;Mortal Kombat: More Kombat&quot;, and was later used on the soundtrack of the best-selling 1998 PlayStation game &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; in the NTSC and EU versions. Apart from &quot;Oxyacetylene&quot;, three other Cubanate songs were used on &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; and the single &quot;Body Burn&quot; can be heard at length in episode eighty-two of &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, from the final season of the show.

<text>World Netball, previously known as the International Netball Federation and the International Federation of Netball Associations, is the worldwide governing body for Netball. The INF was created in 1960 and is responsible for world rankings, maintaining the rules for netball and organising the Netball World Cup and Netball at the Commonwealth Games

In June 2021 INF announced an official rebrand and became known as World Netball.

==General information==
The organisation is based in Manchester, England. The INF has over 70 national members which are grouped into five regional areas: Africa, Asia, Americas, Europe and Oceania. The INF is governed by a congress that meets every two years, a board of directors that meets three times a year, a chief executive officer and a Secretariat. It is also responsible for providing world rankings for national representative teams. The INF organises several major international competitions including the Netball World Cup and Netball World Youth Cup. It is also a signatory to the World Anti-Doping Code.

==History==
In 1957, a pair of national netball organisations discussed the need to create an international governing body for the sport to help address issues like standardising the rules. This conversation was started between England and Australia, while Australia was touring England. In 1960, netball representatives from Australia, England, New Zealand, South Africa and the West Indies finally gathered to create the needed organisation, the International Federation of Women&#x27;s Basketball and Netball. The meeting took place in Sri Lanka (then known as Ceylon), with rules for the newly creating organisation being created. A decision was made at this first meeting create a world championship competition for the sport to be held every four years, with the first event to be held in 1963 in Eastbourne, England.

The organisation has since undergone lies several changes. After all countries adopted the name &quot;netball&quot; for the sport, the organisation was renamed the &quot;International Federation of Netball Associations&quot; (IFNA). This name was used until November 2012, when the organisation changed to its current name, the &quot;International Netball Federation&quot; (INF), to bring it in line with other sports governing bodies.

==Netball World Cup==

The INF is responsible for organising the Netball World Cup (formerly the &quot;World Netball Championships&quot;), the premier event in international netball, held every four years. The table below contains a list of these championships/cups, where they took place and how many teams competed in the event and the winners.

==Netball World Youth Cup==
The INF is responsible for organising the Netball World Youth Cup (formerly the &quot;World Youth Netball Championships&quot;), the premier event in international netball, held every four years in a year other than that of the Netball World Cup. The Netball World Youth Cup is the pinnacle of netball competition for emerging players who are under 21 years of age and the INF has held an U21 international competition every four years since 1988. The table below contains a list of these championships/cups, where they took place and how many teams competed in the event and the winners.

==Fast5 Netball World Series==

The Fast5 Netball World Series is an international competition that features modified &quot;Fast5&quot; rules, and has been likened to Twenty20 cricket and rugby sevens. The competition is contested by the six top national netball teams in the world, according to the INF World Rankings, with teams from Australia, England, Fiji, Jamaica, Malawi New Zealand, Samoa and South Africa having played in the series so far.
The Series was first held in England from 2009-2011 and the game played was called Fast Net, this evolved into Fast5 in 2012.

==Goals and objectives==

The INF&#x27;s fundamental purpose is to promote, improve and grow netball globally, in accordance with the ideals and objects of the Olympic and Commonwealth movements.
One of the goals of the INF is to attain International Olympic Committee (IOC) recognition for netball and to lobby for the sport&#x27;s inclusion at future Olympic Games.

==National organisations==
The INF is responsible for Netball across the Globe with currently (March 2022) 88 Members, 65 Full Members and 23 Associate Members across 5 Regions; Africa, America, Asia, Europe and Oceania. 117 countries interest to netball. 39 Nations only interest and haven&#x27;t teams and federations.

<doc id="1033013" wikidata="Q2451168" url="?curid=1033013" title="Otto fuel II">
<text>Otto fuel II is a monopropellant mixture of chiefly propylene glycol dinitrate (an ester of nitric acid and propylene glycol, and structurally similar to nitroglycerin) that is used to drive torpedoes and other weapon systems. It was invented by Otto Reitlinger in 1963 (although tests with the substance had taken place before, for example in 1960). Otto fuel II, sometimes known simply as Otto fuel, is not related to the Otto cycle; it is named after Reitlinger and for being the second iteration of the fuel. It was developed by the US Navy and the first torpedo to use it was the Mark 48 torpedo in the 1960s.

==Properties==
Otto fuel II is a distinct-smelling (described by submariners as being similar in smell to wintergreen oil; i.e. sweet, fruity and minty), reddish-orange, oily liquid that is a mixture of three synthetic substances: propylene glycol dinitrate (the major component), 2-nitrodiphenylamine, and dibutyl sebacate. It does not need exposure to any oxidant to ignite and release energy, as its three components will react among themselves whenever vaporised and heated. Needing no oxidants and being a stable substance makes Otto fuel II ideal for use in the constrained environment of a submarine. Although the fuel can be made to explode, this requires such extreme conditions that it can be regarded as practically stable. The vapour pressure of the fuel is low (i.e., it is not volatile), minimizing toxic hazards. Finally, the fuel&#x27;s energy density far surpasses the capacity of the electric battery used in other torpedoes, maximizing range.

==Major ingredients==
Named after its inventor, Otto Reitlinger, Otto fuel II consists of the nitrated ester explosive propellant propylene glycol dinitrate (PGDN), to which a desensitizer (dibutyl sebacate) and a stabilizer (2-nitrodiphenylamine) have been added. The chief component, propylene glycol dinitrate, accounts for approximately 76% of the mixture, while dibutyl sebacate and 2-nitrodiphenylamine account for approximately 22.5% and 1.5% (by weight), respectively.

The principal current use of propylene glycol dinitrate is as a propellant in Otto fuel II. Nitrates of polyhydric alcohols such as this have been used in medicine for the treatment of angina pectoris, and as explosives since the mid-nineteenth century.

In addition to its use by the United States Navy as a stabilizer in the manufacture of Otto fuel II, 2-nitrodiphenylamine is employed for similar purposes by the United States Army in the manufacture of double base solid propellants. It also has civilian applications as a solvent dye.

Dibutyl sebacate is a desensitizer in Otto fuel II. However, its major use is as a plasticizer in production of plastics, namely cellulose acetate butyrate, cellulose acetate propionate, polyvinyl butyral, polystyrene, and many synthetic rubbers. It can be used for plastics in use in the food packaging industry. It is also used as a lubricating ingredient in shaving lotions, and a flavoring additive in non-alcoholic beverages, ice cream, ices, candy, and baked goods.

==Toxicity==
Otto fuel II is a toxic substance found in EPA National Priorities List. Ingestion of contaminated food or direct exposure at worksites can cause headaches, poor eye–hand coordination, eye irritation, congested noses, nausea, dizziness, and difficulty breathing. An MSA Demand Mask is mandatory for cleanup/mitigation efforts.

==Used in==
* Mark 37 torpedo (With speed-up kit)
* Mark 48 torpedo
* Mark 46 torpedo
* Mark 54 torpedo
* Spearfish torpedo (with oxidizer)
* Yu-6 torpedo
* Futlyar

<text>He Who Whispers is a mystery novel (1946) by John Dickson Carr. Like many of the works by Carr, the book features a so-called &quot;impossible crime&quot;. For the most part, such crimes fall into the category of locked room mysteries. In this case, the novel falls into a smaller sub-category of Carr&#x27;s work in that it is suggested that the &quot;impossible&quot; crime is the work of a supernatural being (here, a vampire). Dr. Gideon Fell is featured as the detective. Carr considered this one of his best novels.

==Plot summary==

A few months after the end of World War II, Miles Hammond is invited to the first meeting of the Murder Club in five years. When he arrives, no one else is there except Barbara Morell and Professor Rigaud. When no one else shows up, Rigaud tells the story of Fay Seton.

Seton was a young woman working for the Brooke family. She fell in love with Harry Brooke and the two became engaged, but Harry&#x27;s father, Howard, did not approve. One day, he agreed to meet Fay in a tower—all that remained of a burned-out chateau. It was a secure location on a lonely waterfront, and was the perfect place for such a meeting. Harry and Professor Rigaud left Howard alone at ten minutes before four. When they returned, fifteen minutes later, Howard had been stabbed, and the sword-cane that did it was found in two pieces beside his body. At first it seemed an open-and-shut case, but a family that was picnicking a few feet from the entrance of the tower swore that no one entered the tower in those fifteen minutes, that no boat came near the tower, and no one could have climbed up, because the nearest window was fifteen feet off the ground. The only one with any motive was Fay Seton, who was believed to be able to bring a vampire to life and terrorize people.

Miles quickly becomes involved in the affair because the new librarian he just hired is Fay Seton.

<doc id="1033027" wikidata="Q5441498" url="?curid=1033027" title="The Crooked Hinge">
<text>The Crooked Hinge is a mystery novel (1938) by detective novelist John Dickson Carr. It combines a seemingly impossible throat-slashing with elements of witchcraft, an automaton modelled on Maelzel&#x27;s Chess Player, and the story of the Tichborne Claimant. It was dedicated to fellow author Dorothy Sayers &quot;in friendship and esteem&quot;.

In a poll of 17 detective story writers and reviewers, this novel was voted as the fourth best locked room mystery of all time. &quot;The Hollow Man&quot; also by John Dickson Carr was voted the best.

== Plot introduction ==
In his ninth outing, Dr. Fell spends July 1937 at a small village in Kent. John Farnleigh is a wealthy young man married to his childhood love, and a survivor of the &quot;Titanic&quot; disaster. When another man comes along claiming to be the real John Farnleigh, an inquest is scheduled to determine which individual is the real Farnleigh. Then the first Farnleigh is killed—his throat is slashed in full view of three people, all of whom claim that they saw no one there. Later, a mysterious automaton reaches out to touch a housemaid, who nearly dies of fright, and a thumbograph (an early toy associated with the taking of fingerprints) disappears from a locked library. Dr. Gideon Fell investigates and reveals the surprising solution to all these questions.

==Literary significance and criticism==
This novel was fourth in a list of the top ten &quot;impossible crime&quot; mysteries of all time (created by noted locked-room mystery writer Edward D. Hoch).

<doc id="1033036" wikidata="Q1137203" url="?curid=1033036" title="Thin film">
<text>A thin film is a layer of materials ranging from fractions of a nanometer (monolayer) to several micrometers in thickness. The controlled synthesis of materials as thin films (a process referred to as deposition) is a fundamental step in many applications. A familiar example is the household mirror, which typically has a thin metal coating on the back of a sheet of glass to form a reflective interface. The process of silvering was once commonly used to produce mirrors, while more recently the metal layer is deposited using techniques such as sputtering. Advances in thin film deposition techniques during the 20th century have enabled a wide range of technological breakthroughs in areas such as magnetic recording media, electronic semiconductor devices, integrated passive devices, light-emitting diodes, optical coatings (such as antireflective coatings), hard coatings on cutting tools, and for both energy generation (e.g. thin-film solar cells) and storage (thin-film batteries). It is also being applied to pharmaceuticals, via thin-film drug delivery. A stack of thin films is called a multilayer.

In addition to their applied interest, thin films play an important role in the development and study of materials with new and unique properties. Examples include multiferroic materials, and superlattices that allow the study of quantum phenomena.

== Nucleation ==
Nucleation is an important step in growth that helps determine the final structure of a thin film. Many growth methods rely on nucleation control such as atomic-layer epitaxy (atomic layer deposition). Nucleation can be modeled by characterizing surface process of adsorption, desorption, and surface diffusion.

=== Adsorption and desorption ===
Adsorption is the interaction of a vapor atom or molecule with a substrate surface. The interaction is characterized the sticking coefficient, the fraction of incoming species thermally equilibrated with the surface. Desorption reverses adsorption where a previously adsorbed molecule overcomes the bounding energy and leaves the substrate surface.

The two types of adsorptions, physisorption and chemisorption, are distinguished by the strength of atomic interactions. Physisorption describes the van der Waals bonding between a stretched or bent molecule and the surface characterized by adsorption energy formula_1. Evaporated molecules rapidly lose kinetic energy and reduces its free energy by bonding with surface atoms. Chemisorption describes the strong electron transfer (ionic or covalent bond) of molecule with substrate atoms characterized by adsorption energy formula_2. The process of physic- and chemisorption can be visualized by the potential energy as a function of distance. The equilibrium distance for physisorption is further from the surface than chemisorption. The transition from physisorbed to chemisorbed states are governed by the effective energy barrier formula_3.

Crystal surfaces have specific bonding sites with larger formula_3 values that would preferentially be populated by vapor molecules to reduce the overall free energy. These stable sites are often found on step edges, vacancies and screw dislocations. After the most stable sites become filled, the adatom-adatom (vapor molecule) interaction becomes important.

=== Nucleation models ===
Nucleation kinetics can be modeled considering only adsorption and desorption. First consider case where there are no mutual adatom interactions, no clustering or interaction with step edges.

The rate of change of adatom surface density formula_5, where formula_6 is the net flux, formula_7 is the mean surface lifetime prior to desorption and formula_8 is the sticking coefficient:

formula_9

formula_10

Adsorption can also be modeled by different isotherms such as Langmuir model and BET model. The Langmuir model derives an equilibrium constant formula_11 based on the adsorption reaction of vapor adatom with vacancy on the substrate surface. The BET model expands further and allows adatoms deposition on previously adsorbed adatoms without interaction between adjacent piles of atoms. The resulting derived surface coverage is in terms of the equilibrium vapor pressure and applied pressure.

Langmuir model where formula_12 is the vapor pressure of adsorbed adatoms:

formula_13

BET model where formula_14 is the equilibrium vapor pressure of adsorbed adatoms and formula_15 is the applied vapor pressure of adsorbed adatoms:

formula_16

As an important note, surface crystallography and differ from the bulk to minimize the overall free electronic and bond energies due to the broken bonds at the surface. This can result in a new equilibrium position known as “selvedge”, where the parallel bulk lattice symmetry is preserved. This phenomenon can cause deviations from theoretical calculations of nucleation.

=== Surface diffusion ===
Surface diffusion describes the lateral motion of adsorbed atoms moving between energy minima on the substrate surface. Diffusion most readily occurs between positions with lowest intervening potential barriers. Surface diffusion can be measured using glancing-angle ion scattering. The average time between events can be describes by:

formula_17

In addition to adatom migration, clusters of adatom can coalesce or deplete. Cluster coalescence through processes, such as Ostwald ripening and sintering, occur in response to reduce the total surface energy of the system. Ostwald repining describes the process in which islands of adatoms with various sizes grow into larger ones at the expense of smaller ones. Sintering is the coalescence mechanism when the islands contact and join.

==Deposition==
The act of applying a thin film to a surface is &quot;thin-film deposition&quot; – any technique for depositing a thin film of material onto a substrate or onto previously deposited layers. &quot;Thin&quot; is a relative term, but most deposition techniques control layer thickness within a few tens of nanometres. Molecular beam epitaxy, the Langmuir–Blodgett method, atomic layer deposition and molecular layer deposition allow a single layer of atoms or molecules to be deposited at a time.

It is useful in the manufacture of optics (for reflective, anti-reflective coatings or self-cleaning glass, for instance), electronics (layers of insulators, semiconductors, and conductors form integrated circuits), packaging (i.e., aluminium-coated PET film), and in contemporary art (see the work of Larry Bell). Similar processes are sometimes used where thickness is not important: for instance, the purification of copper by electroplating, and the deposition of silicon and enriched uranium by a chemical vapor deposition-like process after gas-phase processing.

Deposition techniques fall into two broad categories, depending on whether the process is primarily chemical or physical.

===Chemical deposition===
Here, a fluid undergoes a chemical change at a solid surface, leaving a solid layer. An everyday example is the formation of soot on a cool object when it is placed inside a flame. Since the fluid surrounds the solid object, deposition happens on every surface, with little regard to direction; thin films from chemical deposition techniques tend to be &quot;conformal&quot;, rather than &quot;directional&quot;.

Chemical deposition is further categorized by the phase of the precursor:

Plating relies on liquid precursors, often a solution of water with a salt of the metal to be deposited. Some plating processes are driven entirely by reagents in the solution (usually for noble metals), but by far the most commercially important process is electroplating. In semiconductor manufacturing, an advanced form of electroplating known as electrochemical deposition is now used to create the copper conductive wires in advanced chips, replacing the chemical and physical deposition processes used to previous chip generations for aluminum wires

Chemical solution deposition or chemical bath deposition uses a liquid precursor, usually a solution of organometallic powders dissolved in an organic solvent. This is a relatively inexpensive, simple thin-film process that produces stoichiometrically accurate crystalline phases. This technique is also known as the sol-gel method because the &#x27;sol&#x27; (or solution) gradually evolves towards the formation of a gel-like diphasic system.

The Langmuir–Blodgett method uses molecules floating on top of an aqueous subphase. The packing density of molecules is controlled, and the packed monolayer is transferred on a solid substrate by controlled withdrawal of the solid substrate from the subphase. This allows creating thin films of various molecules such as nanoparticles, polymers and lipids with controlled particle packing density and layer thickness.

Spin coating or spin casting, uses a liquid precursor, or sol-gel precursor deposited onto a smooth, flat substrate which is subsequently spun at a high velocity to centrifugally spread the solution over the substrate. The speed at which the solution is spun and the viscosity of the sol determine the ultimate thickness of the deposited film. Repeated depositions can be carried out to increase the thickness of films as desired. Thermal treatment is often carried out in order to crystallize the amorphous spin coated film. Such crystalline films can exhibit certain preferred orientations after crystallization on single crystal substrates.

Dip coating is similar to spin coating in that a liquid precursor or sol-gel precursor is deposited on a substrate, but in this case the substrate is completely submerged in the solution and then withdrawn under controlled conditions. By controlling the withdrawal speed, the evaporation conditions (principally the humidity, temperature) and the volatility/viscosity of the solvent, the film thickness, homogeneity and nanoscopic morphology are controlled. There are two evaporation regimes: the capillary zone at very low withdrawal speeds, and the draining zone at faster evaporation speeds.

Chemical vapor deposition generally uses a gas-phase precursor, often a halide or hydride of the element to be deposited. In the case of metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy, an organometallic gas is used. Commercial techniques often use very low pressures of precursor gas.

Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition uses an ionized vapor, or plasma, as a precursor. Unlike the soot example above, this method relies on electromagnetic means (electric current, microwave excitation), rather than a chemical-reaction, to produce a plasma.

Atomic layer deposition and its sister technique molecular layer deposition, uses gaseous precursor to deposit conformal thin film&#x27;s one layer at a time. The process is split up into two half reactions, run in sequence and repeated for each layer, in order to ensure total layer saturation before beginning the next layer. Therefore, one reactant is deposited first, and then the second reactant is deposited, during which a chemical reaction occurs on the substrate, forming the desired composition. As a result of the stepwise, the process is slower than chemical vapor deposition; however, it can be run at low temperatures. When performed on polymeric substrates, atomic layer deposition can become sequential infiltration synthesis, where the reactants diffuse into the polymer and interact with functional groups on the polymer chains.

===Physical deposition===
Physical deposition uses mechanical, electromechanical or thermodynamic means to produce a thin film of solid. An everyday example is the formation of frost. Since most engineering materials are held together by relatively high energies, and chemical reactions are not used to store these energies, commercial physical deposition systems tend to require a low-pressure vapor environment to function properly; most can be classified as physical vapor deposition.

The material to be deposited is placed in an energetic, entropic environment, so that particles of material escape its surface. Facing this source is a cooler surface which draws energy from these particles as they arrive, allowing them to form a solid layer. The whole system is kept in a vacuum deposition chamber, to allow the particles to travel as freely as possible. Since particles tend to follow a straight path, films deposited by physical means are commonly &quot;directional&quot;, rather than &quot;conformal&quot;.

Examples of physical deposition include:

A thermal evaporator that uses an electric resistance heater to melt the material and raise its vapor pressure to a useful range. This is done in a high vacuum, both to allow the vapor to reach the substrate without reacting with or scattering against other gas-phase atoms in the chamber, and reduce the incorporation of impurities from the residual gas in the vacuum chamber. Only materials with a much higher vapor pressure than the heating element can be deposited without contamination of the film. Molecular beam epitaxy is a particularly sophisticated form of thermal evaporation.

An electron beam evaporator fires a high-energy beam from an electron gun to boil a small spot of material; since the heating is not uniform, lower vapor pressure materials can be deposited. The beam is usually bent through an angle of 270° in order to ensure that the gun filament is not directly exposed to the evaporant flux. Typical deposition rates for electron beam evaporation range from 1 to 10 nanometres per second.

In molecular beam epitaxy, slow streams of an element can be directed at the substrate, so that material deposits one atomic layer at a time. Compounds such as gallium arsenide are usually deposited by repeatedly applying a layer of one element (i.e., gallium), then a layer of the other (i.e., arsenic), so that the process is chemical, as well as physical; this is known also as atomic layer deposition. If the precursors in use are organic, then the technique is called molecular layer deposition. The beam of material can be generated by either physical means (that is, by a furnace) or by a chemical reaction (chemical beam epitaxy).

Sputtering relies on a plasma (usually a noble gas, such as argon) to knock material from a &quot;target&quot; a few atoms at a time. The target can be kept at a relatively low temperature, since the process is not one of evaporation, making this one of the most flexible deposition techniques. It is especially useful for compounds or mixtures, where different components would otherwise tend to evaporate at different rates. Note, sputtering&#x27;s step coverage is more or less conformal. It is also widely used in optical media. The manufacturing of all formats of CD, DVD, and BD are done with the help of this technique. It is a fast technique and also it provides a good thickness control. Presently, nitrogen and oxygen gases are also being used in sputtering.

Pulsed laser deposition systems work by an ablation process. Pulses of focused laser light vaporize the surface of the target material and convert it to plasma; this plasma usually reverts to a gas before it reaches the substrate. 

Thermal laser epitaxy uses focused light from a continuous-wave laser to thermally evaporate sources of material. By adjusting the power density of the laser beam, the evaporation of any solid, non-radioactive element is possible. The resulting atomic vapor is then deposited upon a substrate, which is also heated via a laser beam. The vast range of substrate and deposition temperatures allows of the epitaxial growth of various elements considered challenging by other thin film growth techniques.

Cathodic arc deposition (arc-physical vapor deposition), which is a kind of ion beam deposition where an electrical arc is created that blasts ions from the cathode. The arc has an extremely high power density resulting in a high level of ionization (30–100%), multiply charged ions, neutral particles, clusters and macro-particles (droplets). If a reactive gas is introduced during the evaporation process, dissociation, ionization and excitation can occur during interaction with the ion flux and a compound film will be deposited.

Electrohydrodynamic deposition (electrospray deposition) is a relatively new process of thin-film deposition. The liquid to be deposited, either in the form of nanoparticle solution or simply a solution, is fed to a small capillary nozzle (usually metallic) which is connected to a high voltage. The substrate on which the film has to be deposited is connected to ground. Through the influence of electric field, the liquid coming out of the nozzle takes a conical shape (Taylor cone) and at the apex of the cone a thin jet emanates which disintegrates into very fine and small positively charged droplets under the influence of Rayleigh charge limit. The droplets keep getting smaller and smaller and ultimately get deposited on the substrate as a uniform thin layer.

===Growth modes===

Frank–van der Merwe growth (&quot;layer-by-layer&quot;). In this growth mode the adsorbate-surface and adsorbate-adsorbate interactions are balanced. This type of growth requires lattice matching, and hence considered an &quot;ideal&quot; growth mechanism.

Stranski–Krastanov growth (&quot;joint islands&quot; or &quot;layer-plus-island&quot;). In this growth mode the adsorbate-surface interactions are stronger than adsorbate-adsorbate interactions.

Volmer–Weber (&quot;isolated islands&quot;). In this growth mode the adsorbate-adsorbate interactions are stronger than adsorbate-surface interactions, hence &quot;islands&quot; are formed right away.

There are three distinct stages of stress evolution that arise during Volmer-Weber film deposition. The first stage consists of the nucleation of individual atomic islands. During this first stage, the overall observed stress is very low. The second stage commences as these individual islands coalesce and begin to impinge on each other, resulting in an increase in the overall tensile stress in the film. This increase in overall tensile stress can be attributed to the formation of grain boundaries upon island coalescence that results in interatomic forces acting over the newly formed grain boundaries. The magnitude of this generated tensile stress depends on the density of the formed grain boundaries, as well as their grain-boundary energies. During this stage, the thickness of the film is not uniform because of the random nature of the island coalescence but is measured as the average thickness. The third and final stage of the Volmer-Weber film growth begins when the morphology of the film’s surface is unchanging with film thickness. During this stage, the overall stress in the film can remain tensile, or become compressive.  

On a stress-thickness vs. thickness plot, an overall compressive stress is represented by a negative slope, and an overall tensile stress is represented by a positive slope. The overall shape of the stress-thickness vs. thickness curve depends on various processing conditions (such as temperature, growth rate, and material). Koch states that there are three different modes of Volmer-Weber growth. Zone I behavior is characterized by low grain growth in subsequent film layers and is associated with low atomic mobility. Koch suggests that Zone I behavior can be observed at lower temperatures. The zone I mode typically has small columnar grains in the final film. The second mode of Volmer-Weber growth is classified as Zone T, where the grain size at the surface of the film deposition increases with film thickness, but the grain size in the deposited layers below the surface does not change. Zone T-type films are associated with higher atomic mobilities, higher deposition temperatures, and V-shaped final grains. The final mode of proposed Volmer-Weber growth is Zone II type growth, where the grain boundaries in the bulk of the film at the surface are mobile, resulting in large yet columnar grains. This growth mode is associated with the highest atomic mobility and deposition temperature. There is also a possibility of developing a mixed Zone T/Zone II type structure, where the grains are mostly wide and columnar, but do experience slight growth as their thickness approaches the surface of the film. Although Koch focuses mostly on temperature to suggest a potential zone mode, factors such as deposition rate can also influence the final film microstructure.

=== Epitaxy ===

A subset of thin-film deposition processes and applications is focused on the so-called epitaxial growth of materials, 
the deposition of crystalline thin films that grow following the crystalline structure of the substrate. The term epitaxy comes from the Greek roots epi (ἐπί), meaning &quot;above&quot;, and taxis (τάξις), meaning &quot;an ordered manner&quot;. It can be translated as &quot;arranging upon&quot;.

The term homoepitaxy refers to the specific case in which a film of the same material is grown on a crystalline
substrate. This technology is used, for instance, to grow a film which is more pure than the substrate, has a lower density
of defects, and to fabricate layers having different doping levels. Heteroepitaxy refers to the case in which the film being deposited is different from the substrate.

Techniques used for epitaxial growth of thin films include molecular beam epitaxy, chemical vapor deposition,
and pulsed laser deposition.

== Mechanical Behavior ==

=== Stress ===
Thin films may be biaxially loaded via stresses originated from their interface with a substrate. Epitaxial thin films may experience stresses from misfit strains between the coherent lattices of the film and substrate, and from the restructuring of the surface triple junction. Thermal stress is common in thin films grown at elevated temperatures due to differences in thermal expansion coefficients with the substrate. Differences in interfacial energy and the growth and coalescence of grains contribute to intrinsic stress in thin films. These intrinsic stresses can be a function of film thickness. These stresses may be tensile or compressive and can cause cracking, buckling, or delamination along the surface. In epitaxial films, initially deposited atomic layers may have coherent lattice planes with the substrate. However, past a critical thickness misfit dislocations will form leading to relaxation of stresses in the film.

=== Strain ===
Films may experience a dilatational transformation strain formula_18 relative to its substrate due to a volume change in the film. Volume changes that cause dilatational strain may come from changes in temperature, defects, or phase transformations. A temperature change will induce a volume change if the film and substrate thermal expansion coefficients are different. The creation or annihilation of defects such as vacancies, dislocations, and grain boundaries will cause a volume change through densification. Phase transformations and concentration changes will cause volume changes via lattice distortions.

==== Thermal Strain ====
A mismatch of thermal expansion coefficients between the film and substrate will cause thermal strain during a temperature change. The elastic strain of the film relative to the substrate is given by:

formula_19

where formula_20 is the elastic strain, formula_21 is the thermal expansion coefficient of the film, formula_22 is the thermal expansion coefficient of the substrate, formula_23 is the temperature, and formula_24 is the initial temperature of the film and substrate when it is in a stress-free state. For example, if a film is deposited onto a substrate with a lower thermal expansion coefficient at high temperatures, then cooled to room temperature, a positive elastic strain will be created. In this case, the film will develop tensile stresses.

==== Growth Strain ====
A change in density due to the creation or destruction of defects, phase changes, or compositional changes after the film is grown on the substrate will generate a growth strain. Such as in the Stranski–Krastanov mode, where the layer of film is strained to fit the substrate due to an increase in supersaturation and interfacial energy which shifts from island to island. The elastic strain to accommodate these changes is related to the dilatational strain formula_18 by:

formula_26

A film experiencing growth strains will be under biaxial tensile strain conditions, generating tensile stresses in biaxial directions in order to match the substrate dimensions.

==== Epitaxial Strains ====
An epitaxially grown film on a thick substrate will have an inherent elastic strain given by:

formula_27

where formula_28 and formula_29 are the lattice parameters of the substrate and film, respectively. It is assumed that the substrate is rigid due to its relative thickness. Therefore, all of the elastic strain occurs in the film to match the substrate.

=== Measuring stress and strain ===
The stresses in Films deposited on flat substrates such as wafers can be calculated by measuring the curvature of the wafer due to the strain by the film. Using optical setups, such as those with lasers, allow for whole wafer characterization pre and post deposition. Lasers are reflected off the wafer in a grid pattern and distortions in the grid are used to calculate the curvature as well as measure the optical constants. Strain in thin films can also be measured by x-ray diffraction or by milling a section of the film using a focused ion beam and monitoring the relaxation via scanning electron microscopy.

==== Wafer Curvature Measurements ====
A common method for determining the stress evolution of a film is to measure the wafer curvature during its deposition. Stoney relates a film’s average stress to its curvature through the following expression:  

formula_30

where formula_31, where formula_32 is the bulk elastic modulus of the material comprising the film, and formula_33 is the Poisson’s ratio of the material comprising the film, formula_34 is the thickness of the substrate, formula_35 is the height of the film, and formula_36 is the average stress in the film. The assumptions made regarding the Stoney formula assume that the film and substrate are smaller than the lateral size of the wafer and that the stress is uniform across the surface. Therefore the average stress thickness of a given film can be determined by integrating the stress over a given film thickness:  

formula_37

where formula_38 is the direction normal to the substrate and formula_39 represents the in-place stress at a particular height of the film. The stress thickness (or force per unit width) is represented by formula_40 is an important quantity as it is directionally proportional to the curvature by formula_41. Because of this proportionality, measuring the curvature of a film at a given film thickness can directly determine the stress in the film at that thickness. The curvature of a wafer is determined by the average stress of in the film. However, if stress is not uniformly distributed in a film (as it would be for epitaxially grown film layers that have not relaxed so that the intrinsic stress is due to the lattice mismatch of the substrate and the film), it is impossible to determine the stress at a specific film height without continuous curvature measurements. If continuous curvature measurements are taken, the time derivative of the curvature data: formula_42

can show how the intrinsic stress is changing at any given point. Assuming that stress in the underlying layers of a deposited film remains constant during further deposition, we can represent the incremental stress formula_43 as:  

formula_44

==== Nanoindentation ====
Nanoindentation is a popular method of measuring the mechanical properties of films. Measurements can be used to compare coated and uncoated films to reveal the effects of surface treatment on both elastic and plastic responses of the film. Load-displacement curves may reveal information about cracking, delamination, and plasticity in both the film and substrate.

The Oliver and Pharr method can be used to evaluate nanoindentation results for hardness and elastic modulus evaluation by the use of axisymmetric indenter geometries like a spherical indenter. This method assumes that during unloading, only elastic deformations are recovered (where reverse plastic deformation is negligible). The parameter formula_45 designates the load, formula_46 is the displacement relative to the undeformed coating surface and formula_35 is the final penetration depth after unloading. These are used to approximate the power law relation for unloading curves:

formula_48

After the contact area formula_49 is calculated, the hardness is estimated by:

formula_50

From the relationship of contact area, the unloading stiffness can be expressed by the relation:

formula_51

Where formula_52 is the effective elastic modulus and takes into account elastic displacements in the specimen and indenter. This relation can also be applied to elastic-plastic contact, which is not affected by pile-up and sink-in during indentation.

formula_53

Due to the low thickness of the films, accidental probing of the substrate is a concern. To avoid indenting beyond the film and into the substrate, penetration depths are often kept to less than 10% of the film thickness. For a conical or pyramidal indenters, the indentation depth scales as formula_54 where formula_55 is the radius of the contact circle and formula_56 is the film thickness. The ratio of penetration depth formula_46 and film thickness can be used as a scale parameter for soft films.

=== Strain engineering ===
Stress and relaxation of stresses in films can influence the materials properties of the film, such as mass transport in microelectronics applications. Therefore precautions are taken to either mitigate or produce such stresses; for example a buffer layer may be deposited between the substrate and film. Strain engineering is also used to produce various phase and domain structures in thin films such as in the domain structure of the ferroelectric Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT).

==Multilayer medium==
In the physical sciences, a multilayer or stratified medium is a stack of different thin films. Typically, a multilayer medium is made for a specific purpose. Since layers are thin with respect to some relevant length scale, interface effects are much more important than in bulk materials, giving rise to novel physical properties.

The term &quot;multilayer&quot; is &quot;not&quot; an extension of &quot;monolayer&quot; and &quot;bilayer&quot;, which describe a &quot;single&quot; layer that is one or two molecules thick. A multilayer medium rather consists of several thin films.

===Examples===
*An optical coating, as used for instance in a dielectric mirror, is made of several layers that have different refractive indexes.
*Giant magnetoresistance is a macroscopic quantum effect observed in alternating ferromagnetic and non-magnetic conductive layers.

== Applications ==

=== Decorative coatings ===
The usage of thin films for decorative coatings probably represents their oldest application. This encompasses ca. 100 nm thin gold leaves that were already used in ancient India more than 5000 years ago. It may also be understood as any form of painting, although this kind of work is generally considered as an arts craft rather than an engineering or scientific discipline. Today, thin-film materials of variable thickness and high refractive index like titanium dioxide are often applied for decorative coatings on glass for instance, causing a rainbow-color appearance like oil on water. In addition, intransparent gold-colored surfaces may either be prepared by sputtering of gold or titanium nitride.

=== Optical coatings ===
These layers serve in both reflective and refractive systems. Large-area (reflective) mirrors became available during the 19th century and were produced by sputtering of metallic silver or aluminum on glass. Refractive lenses for optical instruments like cameras and microscopes typically exhibit aberrations, i.e. non-ideal refractive behavior. While large sets of lenses had to be lined up along the optical path previously, nowadays, the coating of optical lenses with transparent multilayers of titanium dioxide, silicon nitride or silicon oxide etc. may correct these aberrations. A well-known example for the progress in optical systems by thin-film technology is represented by the only a few mm wide lens in smart phone cameras. Other examples are given by anti-reflection coatings on eyeglasses or solar panels.

===Protective coatings===
Thin films are often deposited to protect an underlying work piece from external influences. The protection may operate by minimizing the contact with the exterior medium in order to reduce the diffusion from the medium to the work piece or vice versa. For instance, plastic lemonade bottles are frequently coated by anti-diffusion layers to avoid the out-diffusion of , into which carbonic acid decomposes that was introduced into the beverage under high pressure. Another example is represented by thin TiN films in microelectronic chips separating electrically conducting aluminum lines from the embedding insulator in order to suppress the formation of . Often, thin films serve as protection against abrasion between mechanically moving parts. Examples for the latter application are diamond-like carbon layers used in car engines or thin films made of nanocomposites.

===Electrically operating coatings===

Thin layers from elemental metals like copper, aluminum, gold or silver etc. and alloys have found numerous applications in electrical devices. Due to their high electrical conductivity they are able to transport electrical currents or supply voltages. Thin metal layers serve in conventional electrical system, for instance, as Cu layers on printed circuit boards, as the outer ground conductor in coaxial cables and various other forms like sensors etc. A major field of application became their use in integrated passive devices and integrated circuits, where the electrical network among active and passive devices like transistors and capacitors etc. is built up from thin Al or Cu layers. These layers dispose of thicknesses in the range of a few 100 nm up to a few μm, and they are often embedded into a few nm thin titanium nitride layers in order to block a chemical reaction with the surrounding dielectric like . The figure shows a micrograph of a laterally structured TiN/Al/TiN metal stack in a microelectronic chip.

Heterostructures of gallium nitride and similar semiconductors can lead to electrons being bound to a sub-nanometric layer, effectively behaving as a two-dimensional electron gas. Quantum effects in such thin films can significantly enhance electron mobility as compared to that of a bulk crystal, which is employed in high-electron-mobility transistors.

===Biosensors and plasmonic devices===
Noble metal thin films are used in plasmonic structures such as surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensors. Surface plasmon polaritons are surface waves in the optical regime that propagate in between metal-dielectric interfaces; in Kretschmann-Raether configuration for the SPR sensors, a prism is coated with a metallic film through evaporation. Due to the poor adhesive characteristics of metallic films, germanium, titanium or chromium films are used as intermediate layers to promote stronger adhesion. Metallic thin films are also used in plasmonic waveguide designs.

=== Thin-film photovoltaic cells ===

Thin-film technologies are also being developed as a means of substantially reducing the cost of solar cells. The rationale for this is thin-film solar cells are cheaper to manufacture owing to their reduced material costs, energy costs, handling costs and capital costs. This is especially represented in the use of printed electronics (roll-to-roll) processes. Other thin-film technologies, that are still in an early stage of ongoing research or with limited commercial availability, are often classified as emerging or third generation photovoltaic cells and include, organic, dye-sensitized, and polymer solar cells, as well as quantum dot, copper zinc tin sulfide, nanocrystal and perovskite solar cells.

===Thin-film batteries===
Thin-film printing technology is being used to apply solid-state lithium polymers to a variety of substrates to create unique batteries for specialized applications. Thin-film batteries can be deposited directly onto chips or chip packages in any shape or size. Flexible batteries can be made by printing onto plastic, thin metal foil, or paper.

===Thin-film bulk acoustic wave resonators (TFBARs/FBARs)===

For miniaturising and more precise control of resonance frequency of piezoelectric crystals thin-film bulk acoustic resonators TFBARs/FBARs are developed for oscillators, telecommunication filters and duplexers, and sensor applications.

<doc id="1033043" wikidata="Q1623606" url="?curid=1033043" title="Blood Canticle">
<text>Blood Canticle is a 2003 vampire novel by American writer Anne Rice, the tenth book in her &quot;The Vampire Chronicles&quot; series. The novel includes some characters who cross over from Rice&#x27;s &quot;Lives of the Mayfair Witches&quot; trilogy (1990–1994), concluding the unified story begun in &quot;Merrick&quot; (2000) and continued in &quot;Blackwood Farm&quot; (2002).

&quot;Blood Canticle&quot; was originally intended to conclude the saga of Rice&#x27;s famed vampire Lestat de Lioncourt, but in March 2014 she announced a sequel titled &quot;Prince Lestat&quot;.

==Plot summary==
Narrated by the vampire Lestat de Lioncourt, &quot;Blood Canticle&quot; finds young Mayfair witch and heiress Mona slowly dying, afflicted with a mysterious disease brought on by the birth of her daughter Morrigan. Over time, Mona and her guardian, Rowan Mayfair, reveal more and more about the powerful genetic plague that has haunted the Mayfairs for generations: their connection to the Taltos, an advanced species of human to which both women have given birth. Mona and the young vampire Tarquin &quot;Quinn&quot; Blackwood are in love. Lestat turns a dying Mona into a vampire so that the lovers can be together forever.

While trying to prevent Mona&#x27;s family from discovering her transformation, Lestat falls in love with the married Rowan, and she secretly pines for him as well. As Mona adjusts to her new power, Lestat enlists the ancient vampire Maharet to help find Mona&#x27;s Taltos child. Lestat, Quinn and Mona arrive at the remote island colony of the Taltos, but instead of finding a secluded utopia, they discover that years of criminal intrigue and civil war have taken their toll. The remaining Taltos join the Mayfair clan at the Mayfair Medical Center where they intend to safely learn and grow as a family. Mona and Quinn are instructed in the proper ways of vampirism by Maharet and her twin Mekare. Rowan seeks out Lestat, half in love with him but torn by her love for her husband Michael. Exhausted by her life, she requests that he make her a vampire. Lestat declines, pained though he is, because she is a guiding force for the Mayfair family and he cannot take her away from it.

==Crossovers==
Some characters from Rice&#x27;s &quot;Lives of the Mayfair Witches&quot; trilogy (1990–1994) appear in &quot;Merrick&quot; (2000), and later &quot;Blackwood Farm&quot; (2002) and &quot;Blood Canticle&quot;.

==Audiobooks==
In 2003, Penguin Random House Audio released an abridged audiobook adaptation of &quot;Blood Canticle&quot;, narrated by Stephen Spinella, as well as an unabridged version, narrated by David Pittu.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Blood Canticle&quot; debuted at No. 5 on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list, spending a total of five weeks on the list. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; wrote, &quot;The vampirization of young Mona, a true child of our times, gives Rice a dynamic new vampire personality with whom to play. Writing as if her blood-inked quill were afire, Rice seems truly possessed by [Lestat] as she races through the story. She sometimes slights members of the vast supporting cast, both dead and alive, but neatly ties up all their loose ends.&quot; Alynda Wheat of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called &quot;Blood Canticle&quot; &quot;overwrought and pulpy as only Rice knows how to be&quot;, adding that &quot;while he occasionally displays the flashes of vanity, wit, and style that originally lured fans, Lestat is lately hampered with a desire to be (ick!) good. It&#x27;s a moral U-turn that drives the Blood Hunter toward the ultimate literary sin: tedium.&quot;

After &quot;Blood Canticle&quot; received many &quot;virulently negative reviews&quot; from readers on Amazon.com, Rice responded on the site with &quot;a blistering 1,200-word defense&quot; of the novel. Compelled to speak out because many of the postings included personal attacks on her writing ability, health and state of mind since her husband&#x27;s 2002 death, Rice added that she had received many emails of support from fellow writers who had also felt &quot;savaged and trashed&quot; by Amazon.com reviews.

<text>Boundary Peak is a mountain in Esmeralda County, Nevada, United States. With a peak elevation of , it is the highest natural point in the state of Nevada.

==Geography==
Boundary Peak is the northernmost peak of 13,000 feet or greater elevation within the White Mountains. The summit is located in Esmeralda County of southwestern Nevada, and is within the Boundary Peak Wilderness of the Inyo National Forest. It is less than half a mile (1 km) from the California state line, which is how it derived its name.

While it is the highest point in Nevada, the considerably taller Montgomery Peak () is less than away, across the state line in California. By most definitions Boundary Peak, which has a prominence of only , is considered to be a sub-peak of Montgomery Peak.

Boundary Peak is only taller than Wheeler Peak, which is located in Great Basin National Park, White Pine County in eastern Nevada. By most definitions, Wheeler Peak is the tallest independent mountain within Nevada.

===Climate===
==Climbing==
This peak is most often climbed from the Nevada side. From there, a climber may scramble the ridge connecting to Montgomery Peak. It is recommended that the U.S. Forest Service (Inyo National Forest) be contacted so they can provide climbing information.

<text>In mathematics, the Marcinkiewicz interpolation theorem, discovered by , is a result bounding the norms of non-linear operators acting on &quot;L&quot;p spaces.

Marcinkiewicz&#x27; theorem is similar to the Riesz–Thorin theorem about linear operators, but also applies to non-linear operators.

==Preliminaries==
Let &quot;f&quot; be a measurable function with real or complex values, defined on a measure space (&quot;X&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, ω). The distribution function of &quot;f&quot; is defined by

:formula_1

Then &quot;f&quot; is called weak formula_2 if there exists a constant &quot;C&quot; such that the distribution function of &quot;f&quot; satisfies the following inequality for all &quot;t&quot; &gt; 0:

:formula_3

The smallest constant &quot;C&quot; in the inequality above is called the weak formula_2 norm and is usually denoted by formula_5 or formula_6 Similarly the space is usually denoted by &quot;L&quot;1,&quot;w&quot; or &quot;L&quot;1,∞.

(Note: This terminology is a bit misleading since the weak norm does not satisfy the triangle inequality as one can see by considering the sum of the functions on formula_7 given by formula_8 and formula_9, which has norm 4 not 2.)

Any formula_2 function belongs to &quot;L&quot;1,&quot;w&quot; and in addition one has the inequality

:formula_11

This is nothing but Markov&#x27;s inequality (aka Chebyshev&#x27;s Inequality). The converse is not true. For example, the function 1/&quot;x&quot; belongs to &quot;L&quot;1,&quot;w&quot; but not to &quot;L&quot;1.

Similarly, one may define the weak formula_12 space as the space of all functions &quot;f&quot; such that formula_13 belong to &quot;L&quot;1,&quot;w&quot;, and the weak formula_12 norm using

:formula_15

More directly, the &quot;L&quot;&quot;p&quot;,&quot;w&quot; norm is defined as the best constant &quot;C&quot; in the inequality

:formula_16

for all &quot;t&quot; &gt; 0.

Informally, Marcinkiewicz&#x27;s theorem is

:Theorem. Let &quot;T&quot; be a bounded linear operator from formula_12 to formula_18 and at the same time from formula_19 to formula_20. Then &quot;T&quot; is also a bounded operator from formula_21 to formula_21 for any &quot;r&quot; between &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot;.
In other words, even if one only requires weak boundedness on the extremes &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot;, regular boundedness still holds. To make this more formal, one has to explain that &quot;T&quot; is bounded only on a dense subset and can be completed. See Riesz-Thorin theorem for these details.

Where Marcinkiewicz&#x27;s theorem is weaker than the Riesz-Thorin theorem is in the estimates of the norm. The theorem gives bounds for the formula_21 norm of &quot;T&quot; but this bound increases to infinity as &quot;r&quot; converges to either &quot;p&quot; or &quot;q&quot;. Specifically , suppose that

:formula_24
:formula_25

so that the operator norm of &quot;T&quot; from &quot;L&quot;&quot;p&quot; to &quot;L&quot;&quot;p&quot;,&quot;w&quot; is at most &quot;N&quot;&quot;p&quot;, and the operator norm of &quot;T&quot; from &quot;L&quot;&quot;q&quot; to &quot;L&quot;&quot;q&quot;,&quot;w&quot; is at most &quot;N&quot;&quot;q&quot;. Then the following interpolation inequality holds for all &quot;r&quot; between &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; and all &quot;f&quot; ∈ &quot;L&quot;&quot;r&quot;:
:formula_26
where
:formula_27
and
:formula_28
The constants δ and γ can also be given for &quot;q&quot; = ∞ by passing to the limit.

A version of the theorem also holds more generally if &quot;T&quot; is only assumed to be a quasilinear operator in the following sense: there exists a constant &quot;C&quot; &gt; 0 such that &quot;T&quot; satisfies

:formula_29

for almost every &quot;x&quot;. The theorem holds precisely as stated, except with γ replaced by

:formula_30

An operator &quot;T&quot; (possibly quasilinear) satisfying an estimate of the form

:formula_31

is said to be of weak type (&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;). An operator is simply of type (&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;) if &quot;T&quot; is a bounded transformation from &quot;Lp&quot; to &quot;Lq&quot;:

:formula_32

A more general formulation of the interpolation theorem is as follows:

* If &quot;T&quot; is a quasilinear operator of weak type (&quot;p&quot;0, &quot;q&quot;0) and of weak type (&quot;p&quot;1, &quot;q&quot;1) where &quot;q&quot;0 ≠ &quot;q&quot;1, then for each θ ∈ (0,1), &quot;T&quot; is of type (&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;), for &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; with &quot;p&quot; ≤ &quot;q&quot; of the form
::formula_33

The latter formulation follows from the former through an application of Hölder&#x27;s inequality and a duality argument.

==Applications and examples==
A famous application example is the Hilbert transform. Viewed as a multiplier, the Hilbert transform of a function &quot;f&quot; can be computed by first taking the Fourier transform of &quot;f&quot;, then multiplying by the sign function, and finally applying the inverse Fourier transform.

Hence Parseval&#x27;s theorem easily shows that the Hilbert transform is bounded from formula_34 to formula_34. A much less obvious fact is that it is bounded from formula_2 to formula_37. Hence Marcinkiewicz&#x27;s theorem shows that it is bounded from formula_12 to formula_12 for any 1 &lt; &quot;p&quot; &lt; 2. Duality arguments show that it is also bounded for 2 &lt; &quot;p&quot; &lt; ∞. In fact, the Hilbert transform is really unbounded for &quot;p&quot; equal to 1 or ∞.

Another famous example is the Hardy–Littlewood maximal function, which is only sublinear operator rather than linear. While formula_12 to formula_12 bounds can be derived immediately from the formula_2 to weak formula_2 estimate by a clever change of variables, Marcinkiewicz interpolation is a more intuitive approach. Since the Hardy–Littlewood Maximal Function is trivially bounded from formula_44 to formula_44, strong boundedness for all formula_46 follows immediately from the weak (1,1) estimate and interpolation. The weak (1,1) estimate can be obtained from the Vitali covering lemma.

==History==
The theorem was first announced by , who showed this result to Antoni Zygmund shortly before he died in World War II. The theorem was almost forgotten by Zygmund, and was absent from his original works on the theory of singular integral operators. Later realized that Marcinkiewicz&#x27;s result could greatly simplify his work, at which time he published his former student&#x27;s theorem together with a generalization of his own.

In 1964 Richard A. Hunt and Guido Weiss published a new proof of the Marcinkiewicz interpolation theorem.

<text>Edmund Ross Colhoun (6 May 1821 – 17 February 1897) was a rear admiral of the United States Navy who served during the Mexican War and the American Civil War, in which he was commended for his participation in the bombardment and capture of Fort Fisher.

==Naval career==

===Service from 1839 to 1853===
Colhoun was born at Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, on 6 May 1821 and was appointed a midshipman on 1 April 1839. He was attached to the sloop-of-war in the Brazil Squadron from 1839 to 1841, then to the frigate in the Mediterranean Squadron and Brazil Squadron from 1842 to 1844. He then attended the Philadelphia Naval School in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1845 and, after completing his studies, was promoted to passed midshipman on 2 July 1845.

Colhoun next served aboard the frigate from 1846 to 1847, seeing action in the Mexican War, first under Commodore David Conner in the first attack on Alvarado, Mexico, and then under Commodore Matthew C. Perry at Tabasco, Mexico.

From 1850 to 1851, Colhoun served aboard a receiving ship at Philadelphia, then aboard the frigate in the Pacific Squadron from 1851 to 1853, being promoted to master on 6 January 1853. He resigned from the Navy on 27 June 1853.

===Service from 1861 to 1883===
With the onset of the American Civil War in April 1861, Colhoun returned to U.S. Navy service, becoming an acting lieutenant on 24 September 1861. From 1861 to 1862 he was commanding officer first of the steam tugboat , then of the steamer , both operating as part of the Union blockade of the Confederate States of America in the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron. In command of &quot;Hunchback&quot;, he saw combat at the Battle of Roanoke Island on 7–8 February 1862, the Battle of New Bern on 14 March 1862, and in an engagement on the Blackwater River south of Franklin, Virginia, on 3 October 1862 during the joint expedition against Franklin.

Promoted to commander on 17 November 1862, Colhoun took command of the steamer in the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron in 1863. Later that year, he became commanding officer of the monitor in the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron, and led &quot;Weehawken&quot; in various actions against Confederate forts – among them Fort Sumter, Fort Wagner, and Fort Beauregard – between 10 July and 15 September 1863. He next commanded the monitor from 1864 to 1865, engaging Howlett&#x27;s Battery on the James River in Virginia on 21 June and 5 December 1864 and taking her into action in North Carolina in both the First Battle of Fort Fisher in December 1864 and the Second Battle of Fort Fisher in January 1865. He was commended for his participation in the bombardment and capture of Fort Fisher.

After the war, Colhoun had special duty at New York City in 1866 before serving as Fleet Captain of the South Pacific Squadron from 1866 to 1867. He was promoted to captain on 2 March 1869 and was commanding officer of the monitor from 1869 to 1870. He commanded the sloop-of-war , flagship of the Asiatic Squadron, from 1873 to 1874 and was in command of the entire Asiatic Squadron from 12 January 1874 to 29 May 1874. He then took command of the sloop-of-war , flagship of the South Pacific Squadron, in August 1874.

Leaving &quot;Richmond&quot; in July 1875, Colhoun was promoted to commodore on 26 April 1876 and took command of Mare Island Navy Yard in Vallejo, California, on 17 April 1877. On 15 January 1881, he relinquished command of the navy yard and was on special duty until 1882 as inspector of vessels in California. He was promoted to rear admiral on 3 December 1882 and retired from the Navy on 6 May 1883 upon reaching the mandatory retirement age of 62.

==Personal life==
Colhoun married the former Mary Ann Hays (15 July 1825 – 11 February 1916) in 1845. They had four children. 

Colhoun died suddenly of heart failure in Washington, D.C., late on the evening of 17 February 1897. He is buried with his wife at Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia.

==Namesakes==
Two U.S. Navy destroyers have been named in Colhoun&#x27;s honor.

<doc id="1033060" wikidata="Q7860881" url="?curid=1033060" title="Type Ia sensory fiber">
<text>A type Ia sensory fiber, or a primary afferent fiber, is a type of afferent nerve fiber. It is the sensory fiber of a stretch receptor called the muscle spindle found in muscles, which constantly monitors the rate at which a muscle stretch changes. The information carried by type Ia fibers contributes to the sense of proprioception.

==Function of muscle spindles==
For the body to keep moving properly and with finesse, the nervous system has to have a constant input of sensory data coming from areas such as the muscles and joints. In order to receive a continuous stream of sensory data, the body has developed special sensory receptors called proprioceptors. Muscle spindles are a type of proprioceptor, and they are found inside the muscle itself. They lie parallel with the contractile fibers. This gives them the ability to monitor muscle length with precision.

==Types of sensory fibers==
This change in length of the spindle is transduced (transformed into electric membrane potentials) by two types of sensory afferents, whose cell bodies are located in dorsal root ganglia located next to the spinal cord.

The two kinds of sensory fibers are different with respect to the kind of potentials they generate:

The first of the two main groups of stretch receptors wrapping the intrafusal fibers are the Ia fiber, which are the largest and fastest fibers, and they fire when the muscle is stretching. They are characterized by their rapid adaptation, because as soon as the muscle stops changing length, the Ia stop firing and adapt to the new length. Ia fibers essentially supply proprioceptive information about the &quot;rate of change&quot; of its respective muscle: the derivative of the muscle&#x27;s length (or position).

Type Ia fibers connect to both nuclear bag fibers and nuclear chain fibers. These connections are also called &quot;annulospiral endings&quot;, deriving from the Latin word &quot;annulus&quot; which means &quot;a ring-shaped area or structure&quot;.

==Efferent innervation==
In addition, the spindle also has a motor efferent innervation carried by the efferent nerve fibers of gamma motor neurons, which is used by the nervous system to modify the spindle&#x27;s sensitivity.

==Termination of afferents==
Proprioceptive afferents send central axons through the dorsal root of spinal nerve bifurcating into ascending and descending branches, which in turn send branches to multiple spinal segments. Some branches synapse at the dorsal horn and some at the ventral horn (where the motor neurons are) which mediate different responses including stretch reflex. Ascending pathways to the brain have some similarities with the cutaneous afferents, but are different because the proprioceptive information also has to reach the cerebellum which controls the timings of muscle contractions for voluntary movements.

<doc id="1033063" wikidata="Q16926867" url="?curid=1033063" title="Operation Krohcol">
<text>Operation Krohcol, or the Battle for The Ledge, was a British operation in December 1941 to invade southern Thailand following the Japanese invasion of Malaya and of Thailand during World War II. It was authorised by Lieutenant-General Arthur Percival as a &quot;mini Matador&quot; after Operation Matador, a pre-emptive strike into Thailand which had been opposed by the British government and was not carried out. Due to delays in authorisation by Percival and in the forwarding of his order, the need to reorganise the troops for Krohcol instead of Matador, and resistance from Thai policemen the Kroh column did not reach the Ledge in time.

==Mini Matador==
As an alternative to Matador, three ad hoc columns were put together to harass and delay the Japanese advance from their beachheads at Songkhla and Pattani.

Krohcol was the most important of the three. Krohcol was tasked with the destruction of the feature known as the Ledge. Destruction of the Ledge would effectively block the road from Pattani, thereby ensuring the security of 11th Indian Infantry Division&#x27;s lines of communication and retreat. For the Japanese, capture of the Ledge would allow them access to the rear areas of the 11th Indian Division, either forcing the British to retreat from Perak and Kedah, or if they were fast enough, they could even cut the 11th Indian Division off entirely.

==Forces==

===British Commonwealth Forces===
It was named Krohcol as it was operating from the town of Kroh at the Perak-Thailand border and &#x27;col&#x27; is short for column (meaning battle group).

The original Krohcol was to consist of:
*3/16th Punjab Regiment - Lt. Col. Henry Dawson Moorhead
*5/14th Punjab Regiment - Lt. Col. Cyril Lovesy Lawrence Stokes ( in captivity on 15 February 1942 following the Battle of Slim River)
*10th Indian Mountain Battery - Major D.G.C. Cowie
*45th Field Company, Royal Bombay Sappers &amp; Miners - Major J.R. Dinwiddie

The column that departed Kroh consisted of men from the 3/16th Punjab and some engineers under the command of Lt Col Henry Moorhead, carried in the Marmon-Herrington AWD trucks of the 2nd/3rd Australian Motor Transport Company under Major G.A.C. Kiernan. Krohcol was under its designated strength and delayed due to a second battalion the 5/14th Punjab Regiment and a light artillery battery failing to arrive on time. The column left without them. The column&#x27;s objective was a six-mile (10 km) stretch of road cut through a steep hillside and bounded on the other side by sheer drop into a river and known as The Ledge. Blowing the hillside on to the road would cause the Japanese invasion force considerable delay.

===Thailand Forces===
Royal Thai Police

Opposing this Commonwealth invasion force was the resistance of the policemen and volunteers from Betong under Major Prayoon Rattanakit, who caused further delays to the column. The Thai Police were, at the same time combating the Japanese 5th Division at Pattani, prior to a ceasefire between the two sides.

===Japanese Forces===
IJA 5th Infantry Division
*42nd Infantry Regiment - Colonel Tadao Ando
** Battalion, 42nd Regiment - Major Shigeharu Asaeda
**2 Companies, 14th Tank Regiment

==Battle of Betong==
===8 December===
Krohcol crossed the frontier some 14 hours after the Japanese landings at Kota Bharu, and met opposition force from Thai policemen and civilian volunteers led by Major Prayoon Rattanakit, police commissioner of the town of Betong. 
This force harassed the British column from the safety of the surrounding forests and felled rubber trees across the narrow road, slowing down the progress of the Bren gun carriers. In the meantime much of the Thai population of Betong evacuated the town, leaving behind Chinese and Indian merchants. 

===9 December===
Thai resistance delayed the Punjab&#x27;s until afternoon and they did not reach the town of Betong, only five miles (8 km) inside the frontier, until evening. 
Later, when Krohcol entered Betong, a Thai constable commanding a police unit allowed them to pass through unopposed. He then approached Lt Col Moorhead and courteously apologised for the &quot;mistake.&quot; However, it is not known why Moorhead did not immediately push on to the Ledge, but the delay proved fatal.

==Race for the Ledge==

===10 December===
On the morning of 10 December, 3/16th Punjab set off from Betong and headed for the Ledge, 26 miles (42 km) away. The Japanese 42nd Regiment of the 5th Division with two companies of light tanks, which had landed at Pattani at 03:00, won the race, reaching the Ledge at midday on 10 December.

About 14:00, while advancing through a ravine above the Pattani River and still a mile (1.6 km) short of the Ledge at km 37, Krohcol&#x27;s advance A (P.M.) Company (Subadar Sher Khan) came under fire again, this time from the Japanese 5th Division. A Company had advanced around a hill and was out of sight when it came under fire. Moorhead sent forward D (P.M.s) Company (Lieutenant Zarif Khan) along the road to support A Company, and C (Dogra) Company (Captain K.A.H. Casson) was sent over the thick jungle covered hill on the left flank. B (Sikh) Company (Lieutenant G.B. Palmer) covered the battalion&#x27;s right flank.

Shortly afterwards, Moorhead lost contact with all three lead companies. Later in the afternoon a runner from D Company reported that A Company was in a desperate battle against tanks and infantry with D Company in support. The battalion adjutant, Captain A.E. Charlton, went forward across a wooded bridge over the Kampong To stream and with the runner he turned the sharp bend a hundred meters ahead. On rounding the bend, Charlton discovered a Japanese tank a short distance ahead and the mortar section of A Company in a heavy firefight. Charlton hurried back to the wooden bridge and brought forward the battalion&#x27;s anti-tank platoon. Major Dinwiddie&#x27;s Sappers took the bridge apart by hand. When the tank rounded the bend, it received a hot reception from the battalion&#x27;s Boys Anti-Tank Rifles and retreated. But Japanese infantry had now occupied the road ahead. B and C Companies returned shortly before nightfall. By midnight on 10 December Lt Col Stokes with 5/14th Punjab and the 10th Mountain Battery transported by 2/3rd Australian MT Company had arrived at Kroh.

With no possibility of any further advance, and now cut off from two of his companies, Moorhead remained with HQ Company and B Company at the bridge position with the sounds of heavy fighting carrying on throughout the night.

===11 December===
The situation on the morning of 11 December was that Moorhead held the bridge at km 37 (25 miles north of Betong), but he had lost complete contact with A and D Companies. Havildar Manawar Khan and eight men from A Company returned with the news that Subadar Sher Khan and A Company had been completely destroyed by tanks and infantry.

Lt Col Stokes&#x27; 5/14th Punjab and the 10th Mountain Battery spent the morning preparing defensive positions at Kroh, whilst Stokes himself went forward to consult with Moorhead. Moorhead ordered Stokes to prepare a position nine miles (14 km) north of Betong to cover the battalion when it withdrew. Stokes left C (P.M.) Company, 5/14th Punjab (Lieut C.E.N. Hopkins-Husson) at Kroh and moved forward with the rest of his battalion plus the mountain battery to the 15 km post where they prepared new positions.

The NCO reported that on the previous day, A Company had advanced beyond the bridge when they had spotted Japanese tanks and infantry coming from the Ledge position. Subadar Sher Khan deployed his company into the jungle east of the road and allowed the two leading tanks to pass. Once they had passed Khan ordered his men to charge the Japanese infantry. Khan was almost immediately severely wounded, but kneeling beside the road, he continued to give encouragement to his men, and the Japanese retreated in complete disorder, leaving a number of casualties. A second group of two tanks and infantry arrived soon after and the first tank ran over the wounded Subadar, killing him instantly. The rest of his company fought fiercely for the next half-hour, inflicting many casualties, but caught on the open road they were eventually wiped out. Only one NCO managed to escape, with eight other survivors.

At 11:00 on 11 December, to the relief of Moorhead, Lieutenant Zarif Khan and D Company returned through the jungle, having hung on to their position until nightfall. Lieutenant Khan withdrew into the jungle, and taking a long detour, reached the battalion positions, having lost 15 men.

During the afternoon of 11 December the battalion was attacked three times, the final attack before night fall was of battalion strength along the entirety of the 3/16th Punjab perimeter. The Japanese regimental infantry guns destroyed most of the Punjabi carriers, but were eventually put out of action by the Punjab 2-inch (51 mm) mortars. The 2/3rd Australian Motor Transport Company and the 36th Field Ambulance evacuated the Punjabi wounded throughout the day.

With casualties mounting, Moorhead made up his mind to fall back to Betong, with permission from divisional headquarters. Moorhead telephoned Colonel Harrison (GSO 1), who told him that he had to hang on until the orders arrived. Written permission to withdraw to Betong had to be carried by motorcycle messenger from Murray-Lyon at his HQ 113 miles (182 km) away.

===12 December===
The battalion held its position throughout the night, but by dawn it became evident that the Japanese were attempting to outflank the battalion from the east and south. Soon after at 07:00 the strongest Japanese attack began, supported by the outflanking forces to the east and south. Moorhead decided that he had to attempt to withdraw rapidly.

Lieutenant Palmer&#x27;s Sikh Company was able to extricate itself, but at the cost of 30 casualties whilst Captain Casson&#x27;s Dogra Company soon found itself completely surrounded. Casson gave orders for his men to fight their way out. A handful of survivors reached D Company&#x27;s positions. The survivors reported that both Casson and his second in command 2nd Lieutenant Frank Skyrme had been killed in the hand-to-hand fighting. Captain Harry Casson (from the island of Saint Vincent) was reported missing in action, believed killed. In reality, he had survived the battle, but was cut off. He survived in the jungle for the next five months, eventually being captured on 24 April 1942.

Nearly outflanked by the Japanese and under heavy artillery fire, Krohcol began their retreat. Colonel Moorhead, armed with a rifle, remained with the rearguard of four surviving Bren carriers. As they were just leaving two of the carriers were hit by shell fire. Moorhead jumped aboard the two remaining Bren gun carriers, but not before rescuing a wounded Punjabi soldier (Moorhead spotted him lying on the shell-blasted road, lifting a weary hand of farewell to him. He leaped out of the carrier, carried him on his shoulder, and returned to the carrier).

Moorhead was forced to make a fighting retreat back to Betong throughout 12 December, where they passed through Lt. Col. Stokes&#x27; 5/14th Punjab, which was digging in and preparing defences. The 3/16th Punjab were reduced to around 350 officers and men.

Japanese scouts found the 5/14th Punjabi&#x27;s position just after dark and probed the area throughout the night.

===13 December===
At first light on 13 December the Japanese attacked the position with light tanks and motorised infantry. One light tank was destroyed and a number of frontal infantry attacks beaten off. With their usual speed the Japanese were soon pushing troops around Stokes&#x27; flanks. The 5/14th Punjab were forced to withdraw back to Kroh, which they did with relatively minor casualties.

The Japanese released a prisoner from a local jail, an ex-bandit who knew the area well. Betong was re-occupied, and the force under Prayoon began taking punitive actions against the local Chinese, who were believed to have greeted Krohcol flying the Union Jack as well as the Kuomintang flag. A local Indian accused of volunteering his services (as a guide) to Krohcol was tracked down, cornered, and shot dead by a group of vengeful Thais.

==The two other columns==

===Laycol===
One of the other columns, consisting of 200 truck-borne troops from the 1/8th Punjabis, and a section of the 273rd Anti-Tank Battery all under the command of Major E.R.Andrews, had crossed the Thai border at the same time as Krohcol. The column, named Laycol after Brigadier William Lay, commander of the 6th Indian Infantry Brigade, crossed the frontier at 17:30 on 8 December 1941 and moved towards Songkhla to harass and delay the enemy. Laycol reached Ban Sadao, ten miles (16 km) north of the frontier at dusk, where it halted and took up a position north of the village.

Laycol made contact with a Japanese mechanised column from Colonel Saeki&#x27;s reconnaissance unit of the Japanese 5th Division with a company of tanks from the 1st Tank Regiment. The force was led by the tanks and moved in close formation with full headlights blazing. The two leading tanks were knocked out by the anti-tank guns, but the Japanese infantry quickly debussed and started an enveloping movement around the flanks of the Punjabis. Laycol withdrew on 11 December through the outpost position at Kampong Imam, destroying two bridges and partially destroying a third on the way back.

===Armoured train===
The last column was an armoured train, with 30 men from the 2/16th Punjab Regiment and some engineers, advancing into Thailand from Padang Besar in Perlis. This armoured train reached Khlong Ngae, in southern Thailand, and successfully destroyed a 200-foot (60 m) bridge before withdrawing back to Padang Besar.

<doc id="1033066" wikidata="Q2931433" url="?curid=1033066" title="CHEK-DT">
<text>CHEK-DT (channel 6) is an independent television station in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, serving Vancouver Island and Greater Vancouver. The station is owned by the CHEK Media Group, a consortium made up of station employees and local investors. CHEK-DT&#x27;s studios are located on Kings Road in Victoria, and its transmitter is located atop Mount Warburton Pike on Saturna Island.

==History==
===CBC and CTV affiliation===
The station first signed on the air on December 1, 1956. Originally operating as a CBC affiliate, it was founded by David Armstrong, owner of local radio station CKDA (1220 AM, now CJZN-FM on 91.3); Armstrong originally applied to assign the CKTV call letters for the station, which was changed to CHEK-TV prior to the station&#x27;s sign-on. Its original studio facilities were located on Epsom Drive in Saanich. Initially, the radio and television stations shared staff such as Andy Steven (who was CHEK&#x27;s first news director) and Keith MacKenzie (who served as its sports director). CHEK was the only local television station that operated on Vancouver Island for many years, until CHUM Limited signed on CIVI-TV (channel 53) in October 2001. The station was the first (and is currently the oldest) privately owned television station in British Columbia. Only CBC owned-and-operated station CBUT-DT (channel 2) in Vancouver has been on the air longer, having signed on in December 1953.

In 1963, the station was purchased by businessman Frank Griffiths, who also owned Vancouver CTV affiliate CHAN-TV (channel 8, now a Global owned-and-operated station). By September of that year, CHEK&#x27;s schedule consisted of some CTV programming and simulcasts of CHAN-originated shows mixed in with the CBC network schedule, along with CHEK-based local productions and syndicated programs not aired on CHAN; this setup continued into the late 1960s and early 1970s, when CHAN started to timeshift network programs. CHEK would also air CBC programs during the afternoon and primetime while running CTV shows such as &quot;University of the Air&quot; and &quot;Canada AM&quot; in the morning (simulcast with CHAN).

In 1972, CHEK, which had simulcast CHAN&#x27;s &quot;News Hour&quot; since the Griffiths purchase (and would continue to do so until 2001), began producing its own news program, &quot;News Hour Vancouver Island&quot;. It aired at 5:30 p.m. before the CHAN &quot;News Hour&quot; simulcast (in some cases, CHAN&#x27;s &quot;News Hour&quot; would only be broadcast on CHEK due to other programming commitments, primarily Vancouver Canucks hockey), and at 11:15 p.m. following CBC&#x27;s &quot;The National&quot;. From 1975 to 1976 and again from 1983 to 1986, CHEK used the same Pacific dogwood logo as CHAN; in both cases, they later reverted to using their own logo.
Beginning around the 1978–79 television season, CHEK gradually added more CTV programs during the prime time hours (which were timeshifted from their airings on CHAN). On January 5, 1981, when CBUT launched repeater stations in Sooke and Mount Macdonald, CHEK disaffiliated from CBC and became a full-time CTV station.
In 1982, Western International Communications (WIC) acquired a 59% interest in CHEK and CHAN. WIC bought the remaining 41% interest from Selkirk Communications in 1989, when that company sold most of its broadcasting assets. In 1984, CHEK moved its operations from its original studios in Saanich to its present location at 780 Kings Road; the studio facility had originally been built to house a planned CBC Television station for Victoria, but budget cuts caused the plans to be shelved and then canceled.

Until 2001, CHEK also broadcast many of the same programs as CHAN on a timeshifted basis; as with CHAN, this consisted of a mixture of CTV network programming and WIC-owned programming (usually drawn from the schedule of CHCH in Hamilton), although the WIC programming usually differed from that aired on CHAN. The launch of Baton Broadcasting-owned CIVT (channel 32) in 1997 further complicated the distribution of CTV network programming in southwestern British Columbia, with CIVT becoming the area&#x27;s third station (after CHAN and CHEK) to carry CTV programming. However, after CHAN strengthened its own morning newscast around 2000, CHEK became the only station in the province that aired &quot;Canada AM&quot;, as CIVT aired its own local morning news program.

===Canwest takes ownership===

CHEK came under the ownership of Canwest Global Communications in 2000 after that company acquired Western International Communications. This acquisition set off a major affiliation switch among the Vancouver–Victoria market&#x27;s television stations in 2001, with both CHEK and CHAN disaffiliating from CTV, and CIVT becoming the sole CTV station in British Columbia. CHAN and CHEK&#x27;s affiliation agreements with CTV were originally due to end in 2000; they were extended to expire on September 1, 2001, in view of the uncertainty surrounding the local media landscape.

After disaffiliating from CTV, CHEK became part of Canwest&#x27;s new CH system. It rebranded as &quot;CH Vancouver Island&quot;, and took on a schedule similar to that of Hamilton sister CHCH. CHEK aired 15 to 20 hours of local news programming each week, and often programs that were usually shown on CHAN were moved to accommodate its news programming. It also took the sports highlight and discussion program &quot;Sports Page&quot; from former Global owned-and-operated station CKVU (channel 10); however, CHAN continued to produce the program until its cancellation in September 2005.

CHEK celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2006; as part of the celebration, it aired vignettes of past station promos from the pre-CH era during commercial breaks. Another short vignette was also introduced consisting of CHEK&#x27;s logos and station IDs through the years, from its original logo in 1956 to its then-current logo as &quot;CH Vancouver Island&quot;.

On September 7, 2007, the station&#x27;s newscasts were retitled &quot;CHEK News&quot;, a partial reversal of the current trend for Canadian television networks and systems to solely use their branding for their owned-and-operated stations, as a result of the rebranding of CH to E!. Programming on CHEK outside local newscasts were branded simply as &quot;E!&quot;.

On January 3, 2009, CHEK began simulcasting CHAN&#x27;s broadcast of &quot;Global National&quot; at 5:30 p.m., the first time that CHEK had simulcast its former sister station&#x27;s programming since the September 2001 affiliation switch.

===Threatened closure; ownership by CHEK Media Group===
On February 5, 2009, Canwest announced it would explore &quot;strategic options&quot;, including a possible sale of the stations, for CHEK and its other E! owned-and-operated stations, on the basis that &quot;a second conventional TV network [was] no longer key to the long-term success&quot; of the company.

On July 22, 2009, after failing to find a buyer, Canwest announced it would be shutting down CHEK on August 31, 2009, issuing layoff notices to the station&#x27;s staff. This would have resulted in CIVI-TV becoming the only remaining television station to serve the Victoria area. Shortly after the announcement was made, CHEK employees announced a proposal to acquire a 25% interest in the station and find local investors to acquire the remaining 75%, and organized a campaign to support the plan and save channel 6. On August 27, 2009, station employees announced that they had raised $2.5 million for the buyout plan; however, the following day, Canwest announced that the employee buyout did not meet company guidelines to keep the station on the air, and that the station had no programming and advertising lined up beyond August 31, at which date Canwest would permanently shut down the station. CHEK would have closed down following the late newscast that night, after a retrospective on the station&#x27;s history.

However, on August 31, 2009, during its 5 p.m. newscast, the station announced that its shutdown would be put on hold, and that it would continue broadcasting while negotiations between Canwest and the prospective new owners continued. Facing a new deadline of September 4, Canwest announced on that date that it had reached a deal to sell the station to CHEK&#x27;s employees and several local investors, through a consortium known as CHEK Media Group, for $2. Canwest would continue to provide transitional support for CHEK, including providing certain programming, allowing the use of its Vancouver studios, and leasing, at &quot;favourable rates,&quot; the 780 Kings Road studios to the new owners with the assumption of various station liabilities. The sale was approved by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) on November 9. After the sale&#x27;s announcement, station manager John Pollard revealed to CBC News that CHEK would operate as an independent station (one of two such stations in Canada that began as a CBC Television affiliate, and then later a CTV affiliate, alongside CJON-DT in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador), with no plans to simulcast any American programs.

CHEK Media Group took control of the station&#x27;s programming on that date the station also disaffiliated from E! (which shut down a few days prior), and adopted a new schedule that included a mix of movies and older programming (both Canadian and American in origin), syndicated programming and a greater emphasis on local newscasts (including a new 10 p.m. newscast that debuted on September 1), and reverted to branding itself as simply &quot;CHEK&quot;. With no plans to simulcast American programming at some point, CHEK would add, in sparse amounts, additional programming during the 2009–10 season, including &quot;Let&#x27;s Get It On&quot;, a mixed martial arts program; Ed the Sock&#x27;s &quot;This Movie Sucks!&quot;, a movie show featuring the former MuchMusic character alongside co-host Liana Kerzner and comedian Ron Sparks; and infomercials.

The station later reversed its stance on running recent American programs; in September 2010, CHEK, for the first time since it came under the employee/investor control, began airing American network television series. Many of the programs that were added to the schedule (including &quot;Smallville&quot;, &quot;Supernatural&quot;, &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;, &quot;Chuck&quot; and &quot;60 Minutes&quot;) were previously carried in the Vancouver–Victoria market on CHNU-DT (channel 66) and on cable through Toronto/Hamilton independent station CKXT-TV (that station&#x27;s owner, Quebecor, was in the process of replacing that station&#x27;s licence with one for an all-news cable channel; Quebecor shut down the station and relinquished the CKXT license to the CRTC in 2011). The station also acquired &quot;I Hate Hollywood&quot;, produced by CHCH-DT, which picked up all of the mentioned programs.

On January 25, 2013, CHEK began sharing space with the local CBC Radio One station CBCV-FM, which migrated its operations into the television station&#x27;s Kings Road studios.

==Programming==

As an independent station, CHEK is programming features a mix of newscasts and other locally produced programs, syndicated programming, movies and infomercials. Some entertainment programming is aired through its secondary affiliation with indieNET (formerly Net5).

===Past local programming===
The following is a partial list of local programs that formerly aired on CHEK:
* &quot;Sports Page&quot; (sports highlights – produced at CHAN-TV)
* &quot;Vancouver Canucks hockey&quot; (sports)
* &quot;Vancouver Grizzlies basketball&quot; (sports)

===Notable past foreign programming===
* From August 1995 to August 1999, CHEK carried the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; at 4:30 on weekday afternoons. Other channels that have carried the talk show, including originating U.S. network CBS, have aired the program in the late evening (11:35 p.m. ET/PT).
* From 1995 to 2001 &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; weekdays on CTV.

===News operation===
CHEK-DT presently broadcasts hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with hours each weekday and an hour each on Saturdays and Sundays); in addition, the station also produces news updates between entertainment programs at the top of each hour between 1 and 3:30 p.m. each weekday. Unlike most news-producing television stations in major Canadian markets, the station does not broadcast a late evening newscast on weekends (its only weekend newscast is a one-hour 5 p.m. newscast). In addition, the station produces the half-hour public affairs program &quot;CHEK Point&quot;. CHEK uses shoots on DVC-Pro tapes for all its programming and pre-recorded segments during its newscasts.

Longtime news anchor Hudson Mack left CHEK in 2004, after 19 years at the station, following his appointment as news director at CIVI effective September 1 (Mack later became anchor of that station&#x27;s 5 p.m. newscast the following month on October 11). To replace Mack, Sophie Lui returned to the station from CHAN-TV and was paired with former CIVT Victoria bureau chief Ed Watson as the station&#x27;s main anchors. On August 25, 2008, production for CHEK&#x27;s newscasts migrated from Victoria to CHAN&#x27;s facility in Burnaby with the addition of a new virtual set, and a launch of a new newscast, &quot;CHEK News: Island 30&quot; – which focused on news stories outside Victoria. The program was retooled months later into a newsmagazine and renamed to simply &quot;Island 30&quot;. Longtime CHAN anchor Tony Parsons joined CHEK on March 15, 2010, as anchor of CHEK&#x27;s 10 p.m. newscast; Parsons had earlier stepped down as anchor at CHAN after a 35-year run as anchor of its &quot;News Hour&quot; supper hour broadcast on December 16, 2009.

In April 2010, CHEK entered into a news share agreement with the CBC, in which the station and CBC Television&#x27;s Vancouver O&amp;O CBUT would share news content, staff and resources. Parsons also joined the CBC to anchor CBUT&#x27;s 90-minute early evening newscast, &quot;CBC News: Vancouver&quot;, resulting in him flying to Victoria after that program to anchor CHEK&#x27;s 10 p.m. newscast. A simulcast of the 6 p.m. half-hour of &quot;CBC News: Vancouver&quot; was also added to CHEK&#x27;s schedule on that date. On June 15, 2012, Parsons relinquished his duties on the 10 p.m., while remaining lead anchor of the 6 p.m. half-hour of the CBUT newscast; a rotation of anchors and reporters temporarily replaced Parsons as 10 p.m. anchor.

Long time reporter Stacy Ross was named anchor of &quot;CHEK News at 5:00 and 6:30&quot;, after the resignation of Jim Beatty. In October 2015, former CTV and Global News International correspondent Ben O&#x27;Hara-Byrne joined the station, as they launched &quot;CHEK News at 6&quot;, which O&#x27;Hara-Byrne was hired to anchor the 6 and 10 p.m. news.

In 2018, former prime time CHEK anchor Scott Fee returned to the company as News Director. Fee set out to renew and restructure CHEK News. In his first year, Fee oversaw the design and installation of a new upgraded set, new cameras, and made some fresh personnel changes.

In 2019, Fee recruited Joe Perkins from CTV Vancouver Island to anchor the now hour-long 6 p.m. newscast.

In 2021, CHEK carved out a new role by bringing in Rob Shaw, a longtime Vancouver Sun legislative columnist and reporter, as the station&#x27;s first political correspondent.

The same year, CHEK launched its foray into community podcasts, producing &quot;MicCHEK&quot;, &quot;Political Capital&quot;, &quot;Our Native Land&quot; and &quot;Chamber Chats&quot;. It also launched a popular newscast segment featuring positive news called &quot;The Upside&quot; hosted by Jeff King and Ed Bain. 

In 2023, Joe Perkins took over as news director. Perkins&#x27; first move was recruiting Global BC morning show host Paul Haysom to take over as the 6 p.m. news anchor. Perkins also promoted CHEK reporter April Lawrence to executive producer and hired long-time CTV Vancouver Island anchor/reporter Jordan Cunningham, as well as &quot;Our Native Land&quot;″s Tchadas Leo as a multimedia journalist.

===Notable former on-air staff===
* Mi-Jung Lee
* Pamela Martin
* Harvey Oberfeld
* Tony Parsons
* Michaela Pereira
* Judi Tyabji

==Technical information==

===Subchannel===
===Spectrum repacking===
In April 2017, Industry Canada posted new channel assignments for stations as a result of spectrum repacking due to the US 600 MHz spectrum auction. CHEK-DT moved to channel 16 on July 3, 2020.

===Analogue-to-digital conversion===
CHEK flash cut its digital signal into operation, over UHF channel 49, on August 31, 2011, the official date on which Canadian television stations in CRTC-designated mandatory markets transitioned from analogue to digital broadcasts. Digital television receivers display CHEK-DT&#x27;s virtual channel as its analog-era VHF channel 6. Due to technical issues with the digital transmitter, the analogue transmitter did not shut down until October 26, 2011; it was the last television station in the Vancouver–Victoria market to continue operating its main analogue transmitter, making Calgary the largest market in Western Canada to have an analogue station operate over-the-air and also unseating Edmonton as Canada&#x27;s second-largest market to have all of its stations convert to digital-only broadcasts. While all Vancouver and Victoria area television stations continued operating analogue signals until August 31, CHEK-TV was the only such station in the Vancouver–Victoria market, as all of the other transmitters in these markets shut down as required by 12 a.m. on September 1, 2011. KVOS-TV (channel 12) in nearby Bellingham, Washington was the first television station that served Vancouver to shut down its analogue signal on February 17, 2009, as part of the digital television transition in the United States.

CHEK-TV was not the last analogue transmitter to shut down as part of Canada&#x27;s August 31, 2011, digital conversion deadline in mandatory markets. A handful of other transmitters in Canada were also late to shut down, though unlike CHEK-DT, the other stations did not have their digital transmitters on-air by August 31, 2011.

===Transmitter===

Note: 
*On November 18, 2011, CHEK-TV received approval from the CRTC to shut down its Sooke transmitter.
*On July 24, 2014, CHEK-TV received approval from the CRTC to shut down its Port Alberni and Campbell River transmitters, with their final day of broadcast being September 1, 2014.

<text>Tumbarumba ( ) is a town in New South Wales, Australia, about southwest of the state capital, Sydney. Tumbarumba is located on the periphery of the Riverina and South West Slopes regions at the western edge of the Snowy Mountains. The showed the population of the town and surrounding area to be 1,862 people. Locals refer to the town as &#x27;Tumba&#x27;.

To the south and east, the highest peak of the Snowy Mountains and mainland Australia—Mount Kosciuszko—can be seen.

==History==
The Aboriginal history of the region is contentious. According to the map developed by Tindale, the area that is now Tumbarumba lay at the boundary of the lands of the Wiradjuri and Walgalu peoples. Since the Wiradjuri word for the &#x27;Walgalu&#x27; was Guramal, meaning &#x27;hostile men&#x27;, presumably there was little in common between these peoples, who spoke different languages. The Walgulu spoke the same Ngarigo language as the more easterly Ngarigo people of the Monaro region, and in more recent times these groups have been considered by some to be just one people, the Ngarigo, whose lands included Tumbarumba. There are different views on the origin on the word &#x27;tumbarumba&#x27; and whether it derives from the Wirajuri or Ngarigo language. Tumbarumba and surrounds now lie within the Brungle/Tumut Aboriginal Land Council Area.

The settler community was established in the late 1850s after gold was discovered in the district. The Post Office opened on 1 August 1860 but was spelt Tumberumba until 1915.

A railway branch line was opened to Tumbarumba in 1921. The Tumbarumba railway line ran from Wagga Wagga through Tarcutta. The service ceased in September 1974 and the line has since been officially closed. The 21 km final section of the line between Rosewood and Tumbarumba opened as the first rail trail in NSW in April 2020.

Gold mining petered out in the 1930s, and the region&#x27;s economy now depends on agriculture and tourism. The timber industry dominates the Shire&#x27;s economy.

The name &quot;Tumbarumba&quot; may be derived from the sound of thunder. or alternatively from the Aboriginal words for &quot;hollow sounding ground&quot;, &quot;thunder&quot;, &quot;sound&quot; or &quot;place of big trees&quot;.

==Industry==
The major industry in the town is softwood timber processing, with the Hyne and Sons Timber Mill to the west of the town being the biggest employer. Other industries include tourism, viticulture (Tumbarumba is in the Tumbarumba wine region), and blueberry growing. Tourism is a source of income due to its proximity to the snow fields.

==Climate==
Tumbarumba has a temperate oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;), with a great seasonal range in maximum temperatures and a pronounced winter rainfall peak. Frosts are frequent throughout much of the year. Snow is fairly common, generally falling on about two days per annum, though is usually light due to the town&#x27;s valley location. The lowest recorded maximum temperature was on 15 July 1966, and the lowest minimum was on 13 July 1970. The town gets 109.2 clear days annually, with the grand majority in summer and early autumn. The winters tend to be quite cloudy.

Rainfall records commenced at Tumbarumba Post Office in 1885, however temperature records (both averages and extremes) didn&#x27;t commence until 1965. 
Another site approximately to the north-west of Tumbarumba operated from 1938 to 1997, at the Carabost Forest Headquarters. There is a remarkable warming trend to be observed between the two sites; particularly in the winter months, where Tumbarumba Post Office averages in July maxima, compared to just at Carabost. A reduction in winter rainfall, but increase in summer rainfall, is noted. It too should be noted that Carabost was of a somewhat lower altitude than Tumbarumba Post Office: a deficit of . 
==Sport==
The Tumbarumba Greens field rugby league teams in the Murray Cup competition. The club is notable for having a full team of Goldspinks playing in the 1960s. The club formerly competed in the Group 13 Rugby League and Group 9 Rugby League competitions before joining their current league.

The Tumbarumba Kangaroos Australian rules football club, founded in 1969, competes in the Victorian-based Upper Murray Football League.

==Cultural references==
*In November 1963, New Zealander Johnny Devlin (with Bee Gees on backing vocals) released the single &quot;Stomp The Tumbarumba&quot;, a song covered later by, among others, the Australian rock band Hoodoo Gurus (see &quot;Come Anytime&quot; and &quot;1000 Miles Away&quot;). &quot;Tumbarumba&quot; in the song&#x27;s title may or may not have something to do with the name of the town.
*Tumbarumba is one of the very few Australian placenames mentioned in James Joyce&#x27;s prose-poem Finnegans Wake. &#x27;Tumbarumba mountain&#x27; is listed as one of the places of origin of HCE (Humphrey Chimpden Earwicker), one of the central characters of the Wake (FW 596.11).
* Shirley Abicair, the UK based Australian singer, made the town of Tumbarumba&#x27;s name familiar to many British children with the publication of her book &quot;Tales of Tumbarumba&quot; in 1962.
*&quot;Tumbarumba&quot; is another word for a tmesis, a linguistic term which refers to the placing of a word within another word, such as &quot;ri-&quot;goddamn&quot;-diculous&quot;. The origin of this meaning may come from the poem &quot;Tumba-bloody-rumba&quot; by John O&#x27;Grady, which includes several tmeses including &quot;Tumba-&quot;bloody&quot;-rumba&quot;, &quot;e-&quot;bloody&quot;-nough&quot;, and &quot;kanga-&quot;bloody&quot;-roos&quot;.

<doc id="1033073" wikidata="Q1493617" url="?curid=1033073" title="Gannett Peak">
<text>Gannett Peak is the highest mountain peak in the U.S. state of Wyoming at . It lies in the Wind River Range within the Bridger Wilderness of the Bridger-Teton National Forest. Straddling the Continental Divide along the boundary between Fremont and Sublette counties, it has the second greatest topographic prominence in the state (7076&#x27;) after Cloud Peak (7077&#x27;), and is the highest ground for in any direction.

==Overview==
Geographically, Gannett Peak is the apex of the entire Central Rockies, the largely continuous chain of mountains occupying the states of Wyoming, Idaho and Montana. Named in 1906 for American geographer Henry Gannett, the peak is also the high point of the Wind River Range. The mountain slopes are located in both Bridger-Teton National Forest and Shoshone National Forest.

Gannett is the highest peak within what is better known as the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem and is the highest peak in the Rocky Mountains outside of Colorado. The Gannett Glacier, which is likely the largest single glacier in the American portion of the Rocky Mountains, extends across the northern slopes of the mountain. Minor Glacier is situated in the western cirque of the peak while Dinwoody and Gooseneck Glaciers can be found on the southeast side of the mountain.
Gannett Peak is in the heart of a remote and rugged wilderness. Because of this, its elevation, and extreme weather, it is often considered by mountaineers to be one of the most difficult U.S. state high points to reach, after Denali and possibly Granite Peak.

==Climate==
The summit has an &quot;ET&quot; (tundra) climate, with short, chilly summers and very long, very cold winters. Precipitation (mostly snow) is moderate year-round, but the wettest month is April.

==Hazards==

Encountering bears is a concern in the Wind River Range. There are other concerns as well, including bugs, wildfires, adverse snow conditions and nighttime cold temperatures.

Importantly, there have been notable incidents, including accidental deaths, due to falls from steep cliffs (a could be fatal in this class 4/5 terrain) and due to falling rocks, over the years, including 1993, 2007 (involving an experienced NOLS leader), 2015 and 2018. Other incidents include a seriously injured backpacker being airlifted near SquareTop Mountain in 2005, and a fatal hiker incident (from an apparent accidental fall) in 2006 that involved state search and rescue. The U.S. Forest Service does not offer updated aggregated records on the official number of fatalities in the Wind River Range.

<text>[[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]] (Wendell Elvis Vaughn) is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. He is one of Marvel&#x27;s cosmic heroes, a character whose adventures frequently take him into outer space or other dimensions. However, Quasar deviates from the archetype of the noble, dauntless alien set by such Silver Age cosmic heroes as the Silver Surfer, Adam Warlock and Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell) in that he is an everyman. He starred in an eponymous monthly ongoing series written by Mark Gruenwald that ran for sixty issues beginning in 1989 and has served as a member of The Avengers.

==Publication history==
The character first appeared as Marvel Boy in &quot;Captain America&quot; #217 (Jan. 1978). He continued to make guest appearances in &quot;Captain America&quot;, &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot;, &quot;Marvel Two-in-One&quot;, and &quot;The Avengers&quot;. He was revamped as Quasar by Mark Gruenwald, and first appeared under this new name in &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; vol. 2 #234 (April 1979).

Quasar received an eponymous series in October 1989, written by Mark Gruenwald and illustrated by Paul Ryan and Danny Bulanadi. The title crossed over with &quot;Infinity Gauntlet&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;The Infinity War&quot;.

Later, the New Universe&#x27;s Star Brand was introduced into the Marvel Universe. Its presence precipitated into the &quot;Starblast&quot; storyline, which was intended to stir up interest in Quasar&#x27;s solo series or a prospective cosmic team series starring Quasar, but it failed to do so. &quot;Quasar&quot; was cancelled at issue #60.

He would appear sporadically over the next several years. The character appeared in the 1996 &quot;Star Masters&quot; miniseries (as well as &quot;Cosmic Powers Unlimited&quot; &amp; &quot;Silver Surfer&quot; vol 3 #123) as part of a team of cosmic heroes with the Silver Surfer and Beta Ray Bill. He also appeared in the &quot;&quot; miniseries, &quot;Maximum Security&quot; (2000), and &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #521-524 (2006).

Quasar appeared and died in the four-issue mini-series &quot;Annihilation: Nova&quot; (June-Sept. 2006). He appeared as a spirit in &quot;: Quasar&quot; #1-4 (Sept.-Dec. 2007), by writer Christos Gage and penciller Mike Lilly. An astral form of Quasar had a recurring role in &quot;Nova&quot; vol 4 beginning with issue #17, as the writers Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning (known collectively as DnA) thought he was too useful a character to stay dead:

The character regained a physical form in the &quot;Realm of Kings&quot; one-shot (2009) and played a role in &quot;The Thanos Imperative&quot; (2010). Quasar assumed the leadership role of the titular team in &quot;Annihilators&quot; #1-4 (2011) and &quot;Annihilators: Earthfall&quot; (2011).

==Fictional character biography==

===Origin and early career===
Wendell Vaughn was born in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin. He graduated from S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy. Although considered highly capable by his superiors, they nonetheless deem him unfit for field work, sensing that Vaughn lacked the necessary &quot;killer instinct&quot;—the will to win at all costs.

His first assignment is security detail for a research facility where a team of scientists were performing experiments on the Quantum Bands taken from the deceased Crusader. A test pilot selected to wear the bands proves spectacularly successful at wielding them, but he perishes when the energy output reaches a critical mass beyond his control. Vaughn dons the bands when the criminal scientists A.I.M. launch a full-scale assault on the facility. Using the bands&#x27; power to generate solid energy constructs, he repulses the attack. When the energy buildup begins to overwhelm him, he decides to simply relax and &quot;go with the flow&quot;. To his surprise, the buildup abruptly dissipates. Vaughn realizes the key to wielding the bands is a flexible will, rather than an indomitable, uncompromising one. Ultimately, his lack of a killer instinct makes him a more suitable wielder of the bands.

Wendell Vaughn becomes a superhero, using the codename Marvel Boy in his first appearance alongside S.H.I.E.L.D.&#x27;s superhuman Super-Agents. He later becomes Marvel Man, and finally settles on Quasar.

Alongside Captain America, the Falcon, and Hulk, he battles Moonstone and the Corporation. Later, as security chief of Project: Pegasus, he battles the original Deathlok, Nuklo, the Grapplers, and the Nth Man when they attack the facility. Quasar later journeys with the Thing into an alternate reality. His mind is temporarily taken over by the Serpent Crown.

===Protector of the Universe===
Quasar journeys to Uranus, where the original Marvel Boy had received the bands. The bands&#x27; true nature and origins are revealed to him by the cosmic entity called Eon. Eon explains the bands were intended to be worn by his agent, the Protector of the Universe (previously the late Captain Mar-Vell). Quasar is offered the role and accepts. As a result, his mind is opened to the true extent of the bands&#x27; power, including how to use the bands to teleport via a dimension called the Quantum Zone. He also battles Deathurge. After returning to Earth, he resumes his role as a superhero and assists the Avengers in battle against Super-Nova. He is inducted into the Avengers shortly after.

Quasar meets Uatu the Watcher. He encounters the Stranger, and solves the Watcher&#x27;s &quot;Oblivion Plague&quot;.
After a falling-out with both his estranged father and Eon, he quits his role as Protector of the Universe. During this time Maelstrom, the &quot;Cosmic Assassin&quot;, kills both Quasar and Eon. However, Quasar is recreated in an energy form by the cosmic being Infinity and battles Maelstrom and Oblivion. Quasar saves the universe from collapse. Maelstrom is destroyed by the Quantum-bands and Quasar resurrects himself. Quasar fights Thanos at Eon&#x27;s funeral. Eon is reincarnated in the form of its newborn offspring Epoch.

When a stargate being used by the Shi&#x27;ar during the threatens to destroy Earth&#x27;s sun, Quasar is able to undo the damage with the help of Binary.

During the 1992 storyline &quot;Infinity War&quot;, Quasar travels to the Dimension of Manifestations to gather intelligence. With the aid of the Contemplator, he discovers the cosmic being Eternity in a catatonic state. He leaves the dimension to join with his fellow superheroes. Quasar attempts to use the near-omnipotent Ultimate Nullifier against the god-like villain Magus, but Magus uses the Infinity Gauntlet to turn the weapon against Quasar, wiping him from existence.

He is briefly replaced by a supervillain who claims his Quantum Bands for himself but Quasar is able to resurrect himself through means of the Star Brand, which he had acquired during a trip to the New Universe prior to the Infinity War. He saves the Living Tribunal from power-hungry Deviant Ereshkigal and stops Skeletron and The Black Fleet from acquiring the Star Brand for themselves. When the Presence threatens to kill his loved ones, Quasar fakes his death and leaves Earth.

===Avengers Deep-Space/Annihilation===
Quasar helps defend the universe from aliens called Infinites. When Earth is threatened by Ego the Living Planet, Quasar absorbs Ego&#x27;s essence and exiles himself into space, for fear of Ego expanding to planet-size.

Quasar helps to operate an Avengers deep-space sensing station with the support of Living Lightning and Monica Rambeau, and then becomes involved in Kang&#x27;s War. He later assists the Fantastic Four in a battle with Galactus. When the Annihilation Wave strikes, Quasar and Nova try to stop it. Quasar is killed by Annihilus.

Wendell is restored to life in a Quantum Energy form thanks to the scientists of Project Pegasus.

===Realm of Kings===
Wendell volunteers to scout the rip in spacetime that occurs during the 2009 &quot;War of Kings&quot; storyline. During the trip, he regains physical form and discovers an alternate universe planning to invade his universe. Trying to return to his reality, Quasar encounters an Imperial Guard exploration ship. Quasar joins Nova&#x27;s team to resist the invasion.

In an effort to prevent further galactic catastrophes, Quasar joins the Annihilators. The team protects Galador from an invasion of the Dire Wraiths and brings an end to the generations long war between the two worlds. The Annihilators learn of an attempt to revive the Magus by the Universal Church of Truth, and they prevent his resurrection with the aid of the Avengers. Quasar and the other Annihilators later confront Thanos and Adam Warlock while the two are on a cosmic crusade, and are defeated.

===Pleasant Hill===
During the &quot;&quot; storyline, Vaughn begins to lose control of the Quantum Bands and willingly allows his memories and appearance to be altered by Kobik in Pleasant Hill, a secret S.H.I.E.L.D. prison disguised as a gated community run by Maria Hill, who poses as its mayor. During this time, he works as the curator of the Pleasant Hill museum. When Wendell&#x27;s memories are restored during Baron Helmut Zemo&#x27;s prison revolt, he bequeaths the Quantum Bands to a young S.H.I.E.L.D. agent named Avril Kincaid and agrees to mentor her so she can become the next Quasar.

==Powers and abilities==
Wendell Vaughn is an athletic man with no inherent superhuman powers. He received extensive training in hand-to-hand combat, and moderate experience in the same. He is an expert in all basic espionage skills, as a S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy graduate.

===Quantum Bands===
===Star Brand===
While he possessed the power of the Star Brand, Quasar gained the abilities of flight, superhuman strength and resilience. He also was able to regenerate his entire body from minute remains and did not need to eat, drink or breathe. However, virtually all of the energy derived from the Star Brand was depleted not long after he gave it away. The Living Tribunal later stated that Quasar&#x27;s body retains only an insignificant trace amount of energy.

===Cosmic awareness===
Quasar also briefly possessed the same powers of cosmic awareness that Eon granted to Kree soldier Mar-Vell (later known as the original Captain Marvel). By simply concentrating for a moment, he could gain complete knowledge about virtually anything in the universe.

===Standard Operating Procedure===
While Quasar&#x27;s powers are quite powerful and diverse, since he doesn&#x27;t make it a habit of using all of his power to destroy his opponent, it is important to note his standard operating procedure:
* Contain. Quasar encounters someone who looks menacing. Immediate reaction: whip up a containment vessel around him to prevent further danger.
* Drain. If it appears this menace has energy-based powers, Quasar taps those powers and drains them off. The length of time this takes depends on the extent of the menace&#x27;s power. He cannot do this to persons whose energies are outside the electromagnetic spectrum.
* Attack. Clobber the guy with a quantum-construct, be it a personal weapon (Quasar prefers nunchakus) or something big like a giant hammer or anvil.

==Reception==
* In 2012, Quasar was ranked 36th in IGN&#x27;s list of &quot;The Top 50 Avengers&quot;.
* In 2018, &quot;CBR.com&quot; ranked Quasar (Wendell Vaughn) 7th in their &quot;25 Fastest Characters In The Marvel Universe&quot; list.

==Other versions==

===Captain Universe Quasar===

After a failed war with the Elder God Set and the deaths of every hero on Earth save the Silver Surfer, Quasar is merged with Captain Universe to form a super-being capable of capturing and defeating Set. Using the Eye of Agamotto, Quasar traps himself and Set within its pocket dimension.

Once, during a trip through alternate realities, the Earth-616 version of Quasar viewed his Captain Universe-enhanced counterpart and Set battling each other.

===Guardians of the Galaxy===

Tricked by Eon&#x27;s evil &quot;child&quot; Era, Quasar jumps to a sentient nexus of energy and is killed. He ends up in the &#x27;White Room&#x27;, where all Quantum Band wielders go after death. Eon is entrapped with him, in the form of a centerpiece on the Room&#x27;s table.

Her, now called Kismet, teams up with the long-lost son she had with Quasar, Starhawk. They visit Quasar&#x27;s grave and learn what Era has done. With the aid of the Hawk-God Starhawk worships, the two vow to stop Era.

===House of M Quasar===

Wendell Vaughn briefly appears as a scientist in the alternate timeline. There is no indication that he possesses the quantum bands in this universe.

===Last Avengers Story===

Quasar is briefly mentioned as having gone insane in &quot;Last Avengers Story&quot; #1, but does not appear.

===Marvel Zombies===
In &quot;Marvel Zombies: Dead Days&quot; #1, Quasar is one of the heroes attending the briefing given by Nick Fury about defending their world from the zombie plague. A zombified Quasar is featured in the 2009 limited series &quot;Marvel Zombies Return&quot;, part of a super-powered zombie force including the Super-Skrull, Namor, Moon Knight, and Thundra. The group destroys many of the somewhat heroic zombies featured in &quot;Marvel Zombies 2&quot;. Quasar murders his reality&#x27;s human Kitty Pryde, holding her underwater until she is forced to turn solid, upon which it is implied that Namor eats her. Quasar and his zombie cohorts are killed at the end of the series.

===Ultimate Marvel===
In the &quot;Ultimate Marvel&quot; universe, S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Wendell Vaughn is the head of security for the top secret Project Pegasus in Devil&#x27;s Point, Wyoming. He first appears in &quot;Ultimate Power&quot; #1, when Project Pegasus is attacked by the Serpent Squad until stopped by the Fantastic Four.

<doc id="1033084" wikidata="Q1138138" url="?curid=1033084" title="Gaseous diffusion">
<text>Gaseous diffusion is a technology that was used to produce enriched uranium by forcing gaseous uranium hexafluoride (UF6) through microporous membranes. This produces a slight separation (enrichment factor 1.0043) between the molecules containing uranium-235 (235U) and uranium-238 (238U). By use of a large cascade of many stages, high separations can be achieved. It was the first process to be developed that was capable of producing enriched uranium in industrially useful quantities, but is nowadays considered obsolete, having been superseded by the more-efficient gas centrifuge process (enrichment factor 1.05 to 1.2).

Gaseous diffusion was devised by Francis Simon and Nicholas Kurti at the Clarendon Laboratory in 1940, tasked by the MAUD Committee with finding a method for separating uranium-235 from uranium-238 in order to produce a bomb for the British Tube Alloys project. The prototype gaseous diffusion equipment itself was manufactured by Metropolitan-Vickers (MetroVick) at Trafford Park, Manchester, at a cost of £150,000 for four units, for the M. S. Factory, Valley. This work was later transferred to the United States when the Tube Alloys project became subsumed by the later Manhattan Project.

Of the 33 known radioactive primordial nuclides, two (235U and 238U) are isotopes of uranium. These two isotopes are similar in many ways, except that only 235U is fissile (capable of sustaining a nuclear chain reaction of nuclear fission with thermal neutrons). In fact, 235U is the only naturally occurring fissile nucleus. Because natural uranium is only about 0.72% 235U by mass, it must be enriched to a concentration of 2–5% to be able to support a continuous nuclear chain reaction when normal water is used as the moderator. The product of this enrichment process is called enriched uranium.

==Technology==
;Scientific basis
Gaseous diffusion is based on Graham&#x27;s law, which states that the rate of effusion of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of its molecular mass. For example, in a box with a microporous membrane containing a mixture of two gases, the lighter molecules will pass out of the container more rapidly than the heavier molecules, if the pore diameter is smaller than the mean free path length (molecular flow). The gas leaving the container is somewhat enriched in the lighter molecules, while the residual gas is somewhat depleted. A single container wherein the enrichment process takes place through gaseous diffusion is called a diffuser.

;Uranium hexafluoride
UF6 is the only compound of uranium sufficiently volatile to be used in the gaseous diffusion process. Fortunately, fluorine consists of only a single isotope 19F, so that the 1% difference in molecular weights between 235UF6 and 238UF6 is due only to the difference in weights of the uranium isotopes. For these reasons, UF6 is the only choice as a feedstock for the gaseous diffusion process. UF6, a solid at room temperature, sublimes at 56.4 °C (133 °F) at 1 atmosphere. The triple point is at 64.05 °C and 1.5 bar. Applying Graham&#x27;s law gives:

:formula_1

where:
:&quot;Rate1&quot; is the rate of effusion of 235UF6.
:&quot;Rate2&quot; is the rate of effusion of 238UF6.
:&quot;M1&quot; is the molar mass of 235UF6 = 235.043930 + 6 × 18.998403  = 349.034348 g·mol−1
:&quot;M2&quot; is the molar mass of 238UF6 = 238.050788 + 6 × 18.998403  = 352.041206 g·mol−1

This explains the 0.4% difference in the average velocities of 235UF6 molecules over that of 238UF6 molecules.

UF6 is a highly corrosive substance. It is an oxidant and a Lewis acid which is able to bind to fluoride, for instance the reaction of copper(II) fluoride with uranium hexafluoride in acetonitrile is reported to form copper(II) heptafluorouranate(VI), Cu(UF7)2. It reacts with water to form a solid compound, and is very difficult to handle on an industrial scale. As a consequence, internal gaseous pathways must be fabricated from austenitic stainless steel and other heat-stabilized metals. Non-reactive fluoropolymers such as Teflon must be applied as a coating to all valves and seals in the system.

;Barrier materials
Gaseous diffusion plants typically use aggregate barriers (porous membranes) constructed of sintered nickel or aluminum, with a pore size of 10–25 nanometers (this is less than one-tenth the mean free path of the UF6 molecule). They may also use film-type barriers, which are made by boring pores through an initially nonporous medium. One way this can be done is by removing one constituent in an alloy, for instance using hydrogen chloride to remove the zinc from silver-zinc (Ag-Zn) or sodium hydroxide to remove aluminum from Ni-Al alloy.

;Energy requirements
Because the molecular weights of 235UF6 and 238UF6 are nearly equal, very little separation of the 235U and 238U occurs in a single pass through a barrier, that is, in one diffuser. It is therefore necessary to connect a great many diffusers together in a sequence of stages, using the outputs of the preceding stage as the inputs for the next stage. Such a sequence of stages is called a &quot;cascade&quot;. In practice, diffusion cascades require thousands of stages, depending on the desired level of enrichment.

All components of a diffusion plant must be maintained at an appropriate temperature and pressure to assure that the UF6 remains in the gaseous phase. The gas must be compressed at each stage to make up for a loss in pressure across the diffuser. This leads to compression heating of the gas, which then must be cooled before entering the diffuser. The requirements for pumping and cooling make diffusion plants enormous consumers of electric power. Because of this, gaseous diffusion was the most expensive method used until recently for producing enriched uranium.

==History==
Workers working on the Manhattan Project in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, developed several different methods for the separation of isotopes of uranium. Three of these methods were used sequentially at three different plants in Oak Ridge to produce the 235U for &quot;Little Boy&quot; and other early nuclear weapons. In the first step, the S-50 uranium enrichment facility used the thermal diffusion process to enrich the uranium from 0.7% up to nearly 2% 235U. This product was then fed into the gaseous diffusion process at the K-25 plant, the product of which was around 23% 235U. Finally, this material was fed into calutrons at the Y-12. These machines (a type of mass spectrometer) employed electromagnetic isotope separation to boost the final 235U concentration to about 84%.

The preparation of UF6 feedstock for the K-25 gaseous diffusion plant was the first ever application for commercially produced fluorine, and significant obstacles were encountered in the handling of both fluorine and UF6. For example, before the K-25 gaseous diffusion plant could be built, it was first necessary to develop non-reactive chemical compounds that could be used as coatings, lubricants and gaskets for the surfaces that would come into contact with the UF6 gas (a highly reactive and corrosive substance). Scientists of the Manhattan Project recruited William T. Miller, a professor of organic chemistry at Cornell University, to synthesize and develop such materials, because of his expertise in organofluorine chemistry. Miller and his team developed several novel non-reactive chlorofluorocarbon polymers that were used in this application.

Calutrons were inefficient and expensive to build and operate. As soon as the engineering obstacles posed by the gaseous diffusion process had been overcome and the gaseous diffusion cascades began operating at Oak Ridge in 1945, all of the calutrons were shut down. The gaseous diffusion technique then became the preferred technique for producing enriched uranium.

At the time of their construction in the early 1940s, the gaseous diffusion plants were some of the largest buildings ever constructed. Large gaseous diffusion plants were constructed by the United States, the Soviet Union (including a plant that is now in Kazakhstan), the United Kingdom, France, and China. Most of these have now closed or are expected to close, unable to compete economically with newer enrichment techniques. Some of the technology used in pumps and membranes remains top secret. Some of the materials that were used remain subject to export controls, as a part of the continuing effort to control nuclear proliferation.

==Current status==
In 2008, gaseous diffusion plants in the United States and France still generated 33% of the world&#x27;s enriched uranium. However, the French plant (Eurodif&#x27;s Georges-Besse plant) definitively closed in June 2012, and the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Kentucky operated by the United States Enrichment Corporation (USEC) (the last fully functioning uranium enrichment facility in the United States to employ the gaseous diffusion process) ceased enrichment in 2013. The only other such facility in the United States, the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Ohio, ceased enrichment activities in 2001. Since 2010, the Ohio site is now used mainly by AREVA, a French conglomerate, for the conversion of depleted UF6 to uranium oxide.

As existing gaseous diffusion plants became obsolete, they were replaced by second generation gas centrifuge technology, which requires far less electric power to produce equivalent amounts of separated uranium. AREVA replaced its Georges Besse gaseous diffusion plant with the Georges Besse II centrifuge plant.

<text>IBM MQ is a family of message-oriented middleware products that IBM launched in December 1993. It was originally called MQSeries, and was renamed &quot;WebSphere MQ&quot; in 2002 to join the suite of WebSphere products. In April 2014, it was renamed &quot;IBM MQ&quot;. The products that are included in the MQ family are IBM MQ, IBM MQ Advanced, IBM MQ Appliance, IBM MQ for z/OS, and IBM MQ on IBM Cloud. IBM MQ also has containerised deployment options.

MQ allows independent and potentially non-concurrent applications on a distributed system to securely communicate with each other, using messages. MQ is available on a large number of platforms (both IBM and non-IBM), including z/OS (mainframe), IBM i, Transaction Processing Facility, UNIX (AIX, HP-UX, Solaris), HP NonStop, OpenVMS, Linux, and Microsoft Windows.

==MQ components==

The core components of MQ are:
* Message: Messages are collections of binary or character (for instance ASCII or EBCDIC) data that have some meaning to a participating program. As in other communication protocols, storage, routing, and delivery information is added to the message before transmission and stripped from the message prior to delivery to the receiving application.
* Queue: Message queues are objects that store messages in an application.
* Queue Manager: a system service that provides a logical container for the message queue. It is responsible for transferring data to other queue managers via message channels. Although not strictly required for message-oriented middleware, is an IBM MQ prerequisite. Queue managers handle storage, timing issues, triggering, and all other functions not directly related to the actual movement of data.

Programs integrated with IBM MQ use a consistent application program interface (API) across all platforms.

==Messaging types==
MQ supports point-to-point and publish–subscribe messaging.

==APIs==
APIs directly supported by IBM include:
* IBM Message Queue Interface (MQI) for C, COBOL, PL/I, Java, Rexx, RPG, and C++
* Java Message Service (JMS)
* XMS for C/C++ and .NET
* .NET
* REST 
* SOAP

Additional APIs (not officially supported) are also available via third parties, including:
* Perl interface (developed and contributed by Hildo Biersma), available from CPAN.
* Python interface &quot;PyMQI&quot; (originally developed by Les Smithson), available from PyPI
* PowerShell

==Features==
One-time delivery: MQ uses once and once only delivery. This quality of service typically prevents message loss or duplication.

Asynchronous messaging: MQ provides application designers with a mechanism to achieve non-time-dependent architecture. Messages can be sent from one application to another, regardless of whether the applications are running at the same time. If a message receiver application is not running when a sender sends it a message, the queue manager will hold the message until the receiver asks for it. Ordering of all messages is preserved, by default this is in FIFO order of receipt at the local queue within priority of the message.

Data transformation: e.g. Big Endian to Little Endian, or EBCDIC to ASCII. This is accomplished through the use of message data &quot;exits.&quot; Exits are compiled applications that run on the queue manager host, and are executed by the IBM MQ software at the time data transformation is needed.

Message-driven architecture framework: IBM MQ allows receipt of messages to &quot;trigger&quot; other applications to run.

Range of APIs: It implements the Java Message Service (JMS) standard API, and also has its own proprietary API, known as the Message Queuing Interface (MQI), which preceded the JMS several years in existence. As of version 8.0.0.4, MQ also supports the MQ Light API.

Clustering: Multiple MQ implementations share the processing of messages, providing load balancing.

==Communication==
Queue managers communicate with the outside world either through:
*Bindings: a direct software connection. Generally faster, but limited to programs running on the same physical host as the queue manager.
*A network or &quot;client&quot; connection: applications using a client connection can connect to a queue manager on any other host in the network. The physical location of the queue manager is irrelevant, as long as it is reachable over the network.

===Communication between queue managers===
This relies on a &quot;channel&quot;. Each queue manager uses one or more channels to send and receive data to other queue managers. A channel is uni-directional; a second channel is required to return data. In a TCP/IP based network, a channel sends or receives data on a specific port.

Channel types:
*Sending channel: has a defined destination and is associated with a specific transmission queue (the mechanism by which messages are queued awaiting transmission on the channel).
*Receiving channel: receives data from any other queue manager with a sending channel of the same name.

When a receiving channel receives a message, it is examined to see which queue manager and queue it is destined for. In the event of a communications failure, MQ can automatically re-establish a connection when the problem is resolved.

The &quot;listener&quot; is the application&#x27;s network interface to the queue manager. The listener detects connections from incoming channels, and manages the connection of the sending channels to the receiving channels. In a TCP/IP network, the listener will &quot;listen&quot; for connections on a specific port.

===Transmitting data to a queue on another queue manager===
Queue types:
*Local queue: represents the location where data is stored awaiting processing.
*Remote queue: represents a queue on another queue manager. They define the destination queue, which is one element of the routing mechanism for messages.
*Cluster queue: represents a queue which is reachable via any queue manager in its cluster.

A message is placed on a remote queue. The messages goes to a temporary storage transmission queue associated with a channel. On placing a message on a remote queue, the message is transmitted across the remote channel. If the transmission is successful, the message is removed from the transmit queue. On receiving a message, the receiving queue manager examines the message to determine whether the message is for itself or if must go to another queue manager. If the receiving queue manager, the required queue will be checked, and if it exists, the message is placed on this queue. If not, the message is placed on the dead letter queue. MQ has features to manage efficient transmission of data across a variety of communication media. For example, messages can be batched together until a queue reaches a particular depth.

===Ordering===
Although the queue is FIFO, it is ordered based on the receipt in the local queue, not the committing of the message from the sender. Messages can be prioritized, and by default, the queue is prioritized in order of arrival. Queues will only be in sequence of addition if the message is added locally. Message grouping can be used to ensure a set of messages are in a specific order, aside from that, if sequence is critical, it is the application&#x27;s responsibility to place sequence data in the message or implement a handshaking mechanism via a return queue. In reality, ordering will be maintained in straightforward configurations.

===The log===
The other element of a queue manager is the &quot;log&quot;. As a message is placed on a queue or a configuration change is made, the data is also logged. In the event of a failure, the log is used to recreate damaged objects and recreate messages. Only &quot;persistent&quot; messages are recreated when a failure occurs—&quot;non-persistent&quot; messages are lost. Non-persistent messages can be sent across a channel set to a fast mode, in which delivery is not assured in the event of a channel failure.

MQ supports both circular and linear logging.

===Retrieving messages from queues===
Information can be retrieved from queues either by polling the queue to check for available data at suitable intervals, or alternatively MQ can trigger an event, allowing a client application to respond to the delivery of a message.

==Availability==
IBM MQ offers a variety of solutions to cater for availability:

Replicated Data Queue Manager (RDQM / &#x27;Easy HA&#x27;- MQ Advanced on distributed only):
Synchronous replication between three servers that all share a floating IP address.

Queue Manager Clusters:
Groups of two or more queue managers on one or more computers are defined to a cluster, providing automatic interconnection, and allow queues to be shared among them for load balancing and redundancy.

Queue Sharing Groups (z/OS only):
In a Shared Queue environment, an application can connect to any of the queue managers within the queue-sharing group. Because all the queue managers in the queue-sharing group can access the same set of shared queues, the application does not depend on the availability of a particular queue manager. This gives greater availability if a queue manager stops because all the other queue managers in the queue-sharing group can continue processing the queue.

Multi-Instance Queue Managers (available from v7.0.1):
Instances of the same queue manager are configured on two or more computers with their queues and meta data residing on shared storage. By starting multiple instances, one instance becomes the active instance and the other instances become standbys. If the active instance fails, a standby instance running on a different computer automatically takes over.

===Background architectural reference===
With the advent of computers, IBM saw an opportunity to apply new technology to the need for message switching.

In the early 1960s, IBM marketed the IBM 7740 Communication Control System and the IBM 7750 Programmed Transmission Control, which were programmable message switching systems.

The IBM System/360 was announced in April 1964 and with it came communication access methods such as BTAM and QTAM (Basic and Queued Telecommunications Access Methods). In 1971, TCAM, the Telecommunications Access Method, offered its users a more advanced form of message switching or message routing. TCAM was widely accepted, especially in the financial and brokerage industries. It supported asynchronous messaging, as with the later MQ. TCAM 3.0 added in reusable disk message queues for recovery soon thereafter, as with MQ. A high-level PL/I program could be used to access TRANSIENT datasets (dynamic message queues). Reading a message from a transient dataset resulted in that message being removed from the queue, as with a non-browse READ with MQ.

In the late 1970s, transaction management systems came into being, each trying to achieve a leadership position in the industry. Within IBM, CICS and IMS were chosen as strategic products to address the need for transaction management. Within both CICS and IMS, each had its version of message switching, IMS being a front-end queued system and CICS having its Transient Data facility as the possible basis for message switching.

CICS established itself as a popular transaction management system in the 1968-1971 timeframe. Those users who had adopted TCAM for its message handling capabilities now wanted a combined use of TCAM with CICS. In December 1971, IBM announced CICS support of TCAM as part of the CICS/OS-Standard product, to be delivered in December 1972. For interested customers, this enabled them to use TCAM for its message handling strengths and also have TCAM-connected terminals or computers interface with CICS online applications.

In January 1973, TCAM continued to be supported by CICS/OS-Standard Version 2.3. However, TCAM support was omitted from the initial release of CICS/VS, announced in February 1973 and delivered in June 1974. Needless to say, many CICS-TCAM customers were not happy with that product direction.

With considerable pressure from CICS-TCAM customers, the CICS support of TCAM was reinstated in the CICS/VS 1.1 product, as of September 1974. In addition to the previous DCB support, with this reinstatement of TCAM support, CICS began to support TCAM access via VTAM, also known as the ACB support. CICS TCAM ACB support was discontinued as of the CICS/ESA Version 3 product in 1990.

In 1992, IBM announced a new product called MQSeries. This brand name was later renamed to WebSphere MQ (however its official short name remained MQ) in 2002 to support the WebSphere family name and the product. In 2014, it was renamed IBM MQ. MQ was to be the extension of TCAM functionality from IBM-only systems to all other platforms. MQ has an architecture that enables heterogeneous systems to communicate with each other (e.g. IBM, HP, Sun, Tandem, etc.). MQ can be used with CICS systems to send and receive data to/from any other MQ-eligible system. MQ can be used to initiate work in a CICS system or a CICS transaction can initiate work in another CICS or non-CICS system.

IBM MQ now supports 80 different environments and has become the leading message assured delivery switching/routing product in the industry.

==MQ and web services==
IBM MQ can be used as a foundation for creating service-oriented architectures. Several additional product options exist to help convert legacy programs into functioning web services through the use of MQ. Larger, heterogeneous enterprises often appear as a federation of somewhat autonomous domains based on lines of business, functional or governance areas. In such environments, some services may be shared or reused only within a single domain, while others may be shared or reused throughout the enterprise. IBM MQ provides the means by which communication exists between lines-of-business or otherwise separate business domains.

A related product in the IBM MQ product family, called IBM App Connect Enterprise (formerly IBM Integration Bus / WebSphere Message Broker) enables a diverse and robust set of extensions to queue-based architectures. Using IBM Integration Bus, users can implement a WebServices front-end, complete with WSDL file support that can interact with any queue-based application.

<text>Panna is a city and a municipality in Panna district in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. It is known for its diamond mines and temples. It is the administrative centre of Panna District.

==History==
Panna was a Bundela Rajput State. It was a Gond settlement until the 13th or 17th century (cite reference), when the Gondi were defeated by the Chandelas they migrated to other parts of Madhya Pradesh. Until that date, there were many rulers of the area. The famous mandir of Padmavatipuri Dham, adorned with divine lustre, is located in Panna town at the centre of Vindhyachal in Madhya Pradesh. The itinerant sage Mahamati Prannath and his disciples reached Panna with a divine message of awakening one&#x27;s soul. Seeing a desert island, he decided to unfurl the flag of Jagani there. He helped the king Chhatrasal and adorned him with the title of Maharaja. He remained there for eleven years, and took samadhi inside the dome. The place, therefore, is known as the seat of salvation [Muktipitha] or Padmavatipuri Dham.

Panna was the capital of Chhatar Sal, the Bundela Rajput leader who led a revolt against the Mughal Empire. Upon his death in 1732, his kingdom was divided among his sons, with one-third of the kingdom going to his ally, the Maratha Peshwa Baji Rao I.

The Kingdom of Panna went to Harde Sah, the eldest son of Chhatar Sal Of Bundela Rajput Clan. In the early 19th century, Panna became a princely state of British India, and gained control states of the states of Nagod and Sohawal. Raja Nirpat Singh assisted the British in the Revolt of 1857, and the British rewarded him with the title maharaja. Maharaja Mahendra Yadvendra Singh acceded to the Government of India on 1 January 1950, and the kingdom became Panna District of the new Indian state of Vindhya Pradesh. Vindhya Pradesh was merged into Madhya Pradesh on 1 November 1956.

==Tourism==
Panna has a tiger reserve which is called Panna National Park. The sightings of tigers in Panna have fallen over recent years, and official tiger population figures were disputed by naturalists. There were plans to relocate two tigresses to Panna in 2009, which happened, but the last male tiger meanwhile disappeared. A male tiger was relocated there. One of the relocated tigresses gave birth to three cubs in 2010. The reserve is home to a wide variety of other animals, many of which can be seen at closer quarters than in other reserves, because Panna has fewer visitors. There are jungle lodges and hotels near the reserve, it can also be reached from Khajuraho. Raneh fall, Pandav fall, brahspati kund and lakhanpur rain fall are also sites tourists visit during monsoon. Panna is also famous for its temples. Temples include Shree jugal Kishore ji, pran nath ji, Jagannath swami ji, ram Mandir and Govind dev ji temple.
==Diamond mining==
A large group of diamond deposits extends North-East on a branch of the Vindhya Range for or so, and is known as the Panna group. They do not cover an area of more than . Great pits, in diameter and, perhaps, in depth, are dug for the sake of reaching the diamond conglomerate, which, in many cases, was only a very thin layer. According to Valentine Ball, who edited the 1676 &#x27;Travels in India&#x27; of Jean-Baptiste Tavernier, Tieffenthaler was the first European to visit the mines in 1765 and claimed that the Panna diamonds could not compare in hardness and fire with other locations in India. No really large diamonds have come from this area. The most productive mines were in the 1860s and were found in Sakaria, around from Panna. Four classifications were given to the Panna diamonds: first, Motichul, clear and brilliant; 2nd, Manik, with a faint orange tint; 3rd, Panna, verging in tint towards green; 4th, Bunsput, sepia coloured. Mines is situated in the interior of Panna district. Diamond mines in Panna are managed under the Diamond Mining Project of National Mineral Development Corporation (NMDC Ltd), a Public Sector Undertaking (PSU) owned by the Government of India. In other mines the land is leased to prospective miners every year by the government agency. The diamonds unearthed are all collected by the district magistrate of Panna and are auctioned in the month of January. Auctions are open to the public and require a Rs. 5000 deposit. Upwards of 100 diamonds of different carat and shade are offered for auction.

<text>Magden (Swiss German: &quot;Magde&quot;) is a municipality in the district of Rheinfelden in the canton of Aargau in Switzerland.

It is located 3 km to the south of the Rheinfelden. Its Roman name was Magdinium, and it is the site of the ancient Magdalener spring which today serves as the water supply of the Feldschlösschen brewery in Rheinfelden, which was recently acquired by Carlsberg.

==History==
The first evidence of a human settlement is a paleolithic/neolithic village. A few, scattered Roman era items were discovered in Magden. Two empty Alamanni cist graves were also found near the village. The modern municipality of Magden is first mentioned in 804 as &quot;in curte Magaduninse&quot;. The counts of Thierstein and then their successors the Habsburgs ruled over Magden until 1797. They owned the land and exercised the &quot;Zwing und Bann&quot; rights over the entire village. With the Act of Mediation in 1803, the entire &quot;Fricktal&quot;, including Magden, joined the newly created Canton of Aargau. The first school opened in Magden in 1761.

The village church of St. Martin was built during the Frankish Empire. In 1036, Count Ulrich I von Lenzburg granted the patronage right over the village church to the monastery at Beromünster. They transferred the rights in 1351 to the monastery at Olsberg. The current church was built in 1620. When the Capuchin monastery in Rheinfelden was suppressed in 1811, their three altars were transferred to Magden. In 1806 the church came under the authority of the Canton of Aargau. In 1872 the majority of the villagers converted to the Christian Catholic Church of Switzerland. Then, in 1906 the Christian Catholic congregation took over the church. A Roman Catholic church was built in 1969 and a Reformed church was built in 1976.

Nearby Iglingen monastery and its Chapel of St. Niklaus is first mentioned in 1360. A group of Third order lay brothers moved into the monastery grounds in 1465. The monastery church was consecrated in 1509 and in the late 16th Century a convent for nuns was added. The church burned in 1860, and only the choir survived. This was converted to serve as a small chapel.

Toward the end of the 19th Century fruit (especially cherries) orchards replaced the traditional vineyards. After World War II, the chemical industry moved into the &quot;Fricktal&quot; offering many new jobs.

<text>The Pancho Villa Expedition—now known officially in the United States as the Mexican Expedition, but originally referred to as the &quot;Punitive Expedition, US Army&quot;—was a military operation conducted by the United States Army against the paramilitary forces of Mexican revolutionary Francisco &quot;Pancho&quot; Villa from March 14, 1916, to February 7, 1917, during the Mexican Revolution of 1910–1920.

The expedition was launched in retaliation for Villa&#x27;s attack on the town of Columbus, New Mexico, an incident of the larger Mexican Border War. The declared objective of the expedition by the administration of US President Woodrow Wilson was the capture of Villa. Despite locating and defeating the main body of Villa&#x27;s command who were responsible for the Columbus raid, US forces were unable to achieve Wilson&#x27;s stated main objective of preventing Villa&#x27;s escape.

The active search for Villa ended after a month in the field when troops sent by Venustiano Carranza, the head of the Constitutionalist faction of the revolution and then head of the Mexican government, resisted the US incursion. The Constitutionalist forces used arms at the town of Parral to resist passage of a US Army column. The US mission was changed to prevent further attacks on it by Mexican troops and to plan for the possibility of war. When war was averted diplomatically, the expedition remained in Mexico until February 1917 to encourage Carranza&#x27;s government to pursue Villa and prevent further raids across the border.

==Background==

Trouble between the United States and Pancho Villa had been growing since October 1915, when the United States government officially recognized Villa&#x27;s rival and former ally Venustiano Carranza as head of the government of Mexico. The US also provided rail transportation through the United States, from Eagle Pass, Texas, to Douglas, Arizona, to move more than 5,000 Carrancista forces to fight Villa at the Battle of Agua Prieta; Villa&#x27;s seasoned &quot;División del Norte&quot; was smashed. Feeling betrayed, Villa began attacking US nationals and their property in northern Mexico. On November 26, 1915, Villa sent a force to attack the city of Nogales and in the course of the ensuing battle, engaged with American forces before withdrawing.

On January 11, 1916, sixteen American employees of the American Smelting and Refining Company were removed from a train near Santa Isabel, Chihuahua, and summarily stripped and executed. Brigadier General John J. Pershing, commanding the district headquartered at Fort Bliss, Texas, received information that Villa with a new force was on the border and about to make an attack that would force the United States to intervene, embarrassing the Carranza government. Raids were so commonplace, however, that the rumor was not seen as credible. Local lore in Columbus holds that the attack &quot;may&quot; have been caused by a merchant in Columbus who supplied Villa with arms and ammunition. Villa is said to have paid several thousand dollars in cash for the weapons, but the merchant refused to deliver them unless he was paid in gold, giving &quot;cause&quot; for the raid.

At about 4:00 am on March 9, 1916, Villa&#x27;s troops attacked Columbus, New Mexico, and Camp Furlong, the US Army post there, where four troops (about 240 soldiers) of the 13th Cavalry Regiment had been stationed since September 1912. The raiders burned the town, stole horses and mules, and seized machine guns, ammunition, and merchandise before fleeing back to Mexico. Ten civilians and eight soldiers were killed in the attack, and two civilians and six soldiers wounded.

Villa&#x27;s soldiers had suffered considerable losses, with at least 67 dead and dozens more wounded. Many of the casualties were inflicted when the machine gun troop of the 13th Cavalry led by 2nd Lt. John P. Lucas set up its light machine guns under fire along the north boundary of Camp Furlong, firing over 5,000 rounds apiece by the glow of burning buildings to illuminate targets. About 13 of Villa&#x27;s wounded later died of their wounds, and five wounded Villistas taken prisoner by the Americans were tried and hanged for murder. 

The next day, acting on the recommendations of the commanders of his cavalry regiments, Southern Department commanding general Frederick Funston recommended an immediate pursuit in force into Mexico. US President Woodrow Wilson concurred, designating Pershing to command the force and releasing a statement to the press:

An adequate force will be sent at once in pursuit of Villa with the single object of capturing him and putting a stop to his forays. This can and will be done in entirely friendly aid to the constituted authorities in Mexico and with scrupulous respect for the sovereignty of that Republic.

==Expedition==
===Pursuit phase===


Pershing assembled an expeditionary force consisting primarily of cavalry and horse artillery, the cavalry units being armed with M1909 machine guns, M1903 Springfield rifles, and M1911 semi-automatic pistols. On March 15, 1916, organized into a provisional division of three brigades (four regiments of cavalry, two of infantry, and 6,600 men), the expedition crossed the border into Mexico to search for Villa, marching in two columns from Columbus and Culberson&#x27;s Ranch.

The 2nd Provisional Cavalry Brigade reached Colonia Dublán after dark on March 17, where Pershing established the main base of operations for the campaign. The 1st Aero Squadron, included in the expedition for liaison duties and aerial reconnaissance on the orders of United States Secretary of War Newton D. Baker, departed San Antonio, Texas, on March 13 by rail with eight Curtiss JN3 airplanes and flew the first aerial reconnaissance of the area from Columbus on March 16, the day after it arrived. The entire squadron flew to the advanced camp at Colonia Dublán on March 19–20, losing two aircraft in the process.

Pershing immediately sent the 7th Cavalry (seven troops in two squadrons) south just after midnight on March 18 to begin the pursuit, followed by the 10th Cavalry moving by rail two days later. From March 20 to March 30, as the 11th Cavalry arrived in Columbus by train from Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia, and then forced marched into Mexico, Pershing dispatched four additional &quot;flying columns&quot; through the mountainous territory into the gaps between the original three columns. Persistent winter weather through early April, particularly bitterly cold nights at high altitude, made both pursuit and logistics more difficult. An additional regiment of cavalry and two of infantry were added to the expedition in late April, bringing its total size to 4,800 men. Ultimately more than 10,000 men—virtually every available unit of the Regular Army and additional National Guard troops—were committed to the expedition either in Mexico or its supporting units at Columbus.

Because of disputes with the Carranza administration over the use of the Mexico North Western Railway to supply Pershing&#x27;s troops, the United States Army employed trucks to convoy supplies to the encampment where the Signal Corps also set up wireless telegraph service from the border to Pershing&#x27;s headquarters. This was the first use of truck convoys in a US military operation and provided useful experience for World War I. During this phase of the campaign Pershing maintained a small mobile headquarters of 30 men using a Dodge touring car for personal transportation, to keep abreast of the moving columns and control their movements, employing aircraft of the 1st Aero Squadron as messengers. His headquarters advanced as far as the 1st Aero Squadron&#x27;s field at Satevó, southeast of the city of Chihuahua, before falling back at the end of April.

Villa had a six-day head start on the pursuit, all but ensuring that his forces would successfully break up into smaller bands and he would be able to hide in the trackless mountains. Nevertheless, he was nearly caught by the forced marches of the pursuing cavalry columns when he recklessly paused in his retreat to attack a Carrancista garrison. The Battle of Guerrero was fought on March 29, 1916, after a 55-mile night march through the snowy Sierra Madre by Colonel George A. Dodd and 370 men of the 7th Cavalry. 360 Villistas had remained in Guerrero celebrating the victory won over the Carrancista garrison and 160 more were in the next valley in nearby San Ysidro.

Dodd&#x27;s force was unexpected by the Villistas, who hastily dispersed when the US troops appeared on the steep eastern bluffs overlooking the town. Dodd immediately attacked, sending one squadron west around the town to block escape routes and advancing with the other. A planned charge was thwarted when the fatigued horses were unable to attain the proper gait. During a five-hour pursuit of fleeing Villista elements, over 75 of Villa&#x27;s men were killed or wounded and he was forced to retreat into the mountains. Only five of the Americans were hurt, none of them fatally. The battle is considered the single most successful engagement of the expedition and possibly the closest Pershing&#x27;s men came to capturing Villa.

After advancing from Namiquipa on March 24 to , the 10th Cavalry became isolated from Pershing&#x27;s headquarters by a fierce snow storm on March 31. A squadron of the 10th marched toward Guerrero after receiving reports of the action there and at midday April 1 a meeting engagement resulted with one of the retreating Villista groups, 150 strong, under Francisco Beltrán at a ranch near Agua Caliente. Breaking up into even smaller groups and retreating over a wooded ridge, some of the Villistas attempted to defend themselves behind a stone wall, resulting in what was purported to be the first mounted cavalry charge by US troops since 1898, led by Major Charles Young. The pursuit lasted until darkness and the Buffalo Soldiers killed at least two Villistas left on the field and routed the remainder without loss. The action also was the first time the US Army used plunging fire by machine guns to support an attack.

The columns pushed deeper into Mexico, increasing tensions between the United States and the Carranza government. On April 12, 1916, Major Frank Tompkins and Troops K and M, 13th Cavalry, numbering 128 men, were attacked by an estimated 500 Mexican troops as they were leaving the town of Parral, 513 miles into Mexico and almost to the state of Durango, following violent protests by the civilian populace. Tompkins had been personally ordered to avoid a straight-up engagement with de facto government troops to prevent war between the countries and so used a rear guard to keep the Carrancistas at a distance during a retreat to his starting point, the fortified village of Santa Cruz de Villegas. Two Americans were killed in the skirmishing, one was missing from the rear guard, and another six were wounded, while the Carrancistas lost between fourteen and seventy men, according to conflicting accounts.

The battle marked a turning point in the campaign. Military opposition by Carranza forced a halt in further pursuit while diplomatic conversations took place by both nations to avoid war. Only four days earlier, on April 8, Army Chief of Staff General Hugh L. Scott had expressed to Secretary of War Baker that Pershing had virtually accomplished his mission and that it was &quot;not dignified for the United States to be hunting one man in a foreign country&quot;. Baker concurred and so advised Wilson, but following the fight at Parral the administration refused to withdraw the expedition, not wanting to be seen as caving in to Mexican pressure during an election year. Instead, on April 21 Pershing ordered the four columns that had converged near Parral to withdraw to San Antonio de Los Arenales. A week later he assigned the cavalry regiments, including the newly arrived 5th Cavalry, to five districts created in central Chihuahua in which to patrol and seek out the smaller bands.

While executing the withdrawal order, Dodd and a portion of the 7th Cavalry fought an engagement on April 22 with about 200 Villistas under at the small village of Tomochic. As the Americans entered the village, the Mexicans opened fire from the surrounding hills. Dodd first sent patrols out to engage the Villistas&#x27; rear guard, to the east of Tomochic, and after these were &quot;scattered&quot;, located the main body on a plain to the north and brought it into action. Skirmishing continued, but after dark the Villistas retreated and the Americans moved into Tomochic. The 7th Cavalry lost two men killed and four wounded, while Dodd reported his men had killed at least thirty Villistas.

===Patrol district actions===

The five districts that Pershing established west of the Mexican Central Railway on April 29, 1916, were:
* Namiquipa District (10th Cavalry) south of the 30th parallel to Namiquipa;
* Bustillos District (13th Cavalry), below the eastern part of Namiquipa District around Laguna Bustillos to San Antonio de Los Arenales and Chihuahua City;
* Guerrero District (7th Cavalry), below the western part of Namiquipa District and west of the Bustillos and San Borja Districts;
* San Borja District (11th Cavalry), south of Bustillos District between the Guerrero and Satevó Districts to Parral; and
* Satevó District (5th Cavalry), southeast of the Bustillos District and east of the San Borja District, south to Jimenez.

The next significant engagement took place on May 5. A small Carrancista garrison at the silver mining town of Cusihuiriachic was attacked by Villa&#x27;s forces on May 4, prompting the garrison commander to request help from US forces at nearby San Antonio. Six troops of the 11th Cavalry, its machine gun platoon, and a detachment of Apache Scouts under 1st Lt. James A. Shannon, totaling 14 officers and 319 men, began a night march under Major Robert L. Howze. Arriving at Cusihuirischic, Howze found that 140 Villistas under Julio Acosta had pulled back into the mountains to the west to a ranch at Ojos Azules, and that the garrison commander had received orders not to cooperate with the Americans. Howze was delayed three hours in finding a guide and by the time he located the ranch and was deploying to attack, day had broken. When Acosta&#x27;s guards and Howze&#x27;s advance guard exchanged fire, Howze with Troop A immediately ordered a charge with pistols through the hacienda. Unable to deploy on line, the charge was made in column of fours and closed with the fleeing elements of Villistas. The other troops deployed to either side of the hacienda attempting to block escape and were supported by plunging fire from the machine gun troop. Friedrich Katz called the action the &quot;greatest victory that the Punitive Expedition would achieve.&quot; Without a single casualty, the Americans killed forty-four Villistas and wounded many more. The survivors, including Acosta, were dispersed.

Also on May 5, several hundred Mexican raiders, under a Villista officer, attacked the geographically isolated towns of Glenn Springs and Boquillas in the Big Bend region of Texas. At Glenn Springs the Mexicans overwhelmed a squad of just nine 14th Cavalry troopers guarding the town, set fire to it, then rode on to Boquillas where they killed a boy, looted the town and took two captives. Local commanders pursued the Mexicans 100 miles into the state of Coahuila to free the captives and regain the stolen property. On May 12, Major George T. Langhorne and two troops of the 8th Cavalry from Fort Bliss, Texas, reinforced by Colonel Frederick Sibley and Troops H and K of the 14th Cavalry from Fort Clark, rescued the captives at El Pino without a fight. Three days later a small detachment of cavalry encountered the raiders at Castillon, killing five of the Villistas and wounding two; the Americans had no casualties. The cavalry force returned to the United States May 21 after ten days in Mexico.

On May 14, 2nd Lt. George S. Patton raided the San Miguelito Ranch, near Rubio, Chihuahua. Patton, a Pershing aide and a future World War II general, was out looking to buy some corn from the Mexicans when he came across the ranch of Julio Cárdenas, an important leader in the Villista military organization. With fifteen men and three Dodge touring cars, Patton led America&#x27;s first motorised military action, in which Cárdenas and two other men were shot dead. The young lieutenant then had the three Mexicans strapped to the hood of the cars and driven back to General Pershing&#x27;s headquarters. Patton is said to have carved three notches into the twin Colt Peacemakers he carried, representing the men he killed that day. General Pershing nicknamed him the &quot;Bandito&quot;.

The Villistas launched an attack of their own on May 25. This time a small force of ten men from the 7th Cavalry were out looking for stray cattle and correcting maps when they were ambushed by twenty rebels just south of Cruces. One American corporal was killed and two other men were wounded, though they killed two of the &quot;bandit leaders&quot; and drove off the rest.

On June 2, Shannon and twenty Apache scouts fought a small skirmish with some of Candelaro Cervantes&#x27; men who had stolen a few horses from the 5th Cavalry. Shannon and the Apaches found the rebels&#x27; trail, which was a week old by then, and followed it for some time until finally catching up with the Mexicans near Las Varas Pass, about forty miles south of Namiquipa. Using the cover of darkness, Shannon and his scouts attacked the Villistas&#x27; hideout, killing one of them and wounding another without losses to themselves. The Villista who died was thought to be the leader as he carried a sword during the fight.

Another skirmish was fought on June 9, north of Pershing&#x27;s headquarters and the city of Chihuahua. Twenty men from the 13th Cavalry encountered an equally small force of Villistas and chased them through Santa Clara Canyon. Three of the Mexicans were killed, and the rest escaped. There were no American casualties.

===End of active operations===
On May 9, at a face-to-face meeting in El Paso, Texas, Carranza&#x27;s Secretary of War and Navy, General Álvaro Obregón, threatened to send a massive force against the expedition&#x27;s supply lines and forcibly drive it out of Mexico. Funston reacted by ordering Pershing to withdraw all his troops from San Antonio de Los Arenales to Colonia Dublán. Although the order was rescinded on the evening of May 11 when no evidence of Carrancista troop movements was found, the southernmost supply depots had been closed and materiel sent north that could not easily be turned around. Pershing was ordered to halt in place at Namiquipa, making tactical dispositions of his forces there and on El Valle to the north. The movements began a gradual withdrawal of the expedition to Dublán. On May 19, units of the 10th and 11th Cavalry returned to the base to guard the supply lines with Columbus and conduct reconnaissance in the absence of the temporarily grounded 1st Aero Squadron. As the threat of war with the de facto government increased, the northward movement continued. Pershing&#x27;s headquarters left Namiquipa on June 21, setting up again in Dublán, after which the advanced supply depot at Namiquipa closed June 23. June 29 found the expedition concentrated on the main base and a forward camp at El Valle 60 miles to the south.

The last and most costly engagement of the Mexican Expedition was fought on June 21 when 3 officers and 87 men of Troops C and K of the 10th Cavalry, sent separately to scout Carrancista dispositions reported along the Mexican Central Railway, combined into a single column and encountered a blocking force of 300 soldiers. They were soundly defeated at the Battle of Carrizal, with Captain Charles T. Boyd, 1st Lt. Henry R. Adair, and ten enlisted men killed, ten wounded and another 24 (23 soldiers and 1 civilian guide) taken prisoner. The remainder, including the sole surviving officer, Capt. Lewis S. Morey, were rescued four days later by a relief squadron of the 11th Cavalry. The Mexicans did not do much better; they reported the loss of 24 men killed and 43 wounded, including their commander, General Félix Uresti Gómez, while Pershing listed 42 Carrancistas killed and 51 wounded. When General Pershing learned of the battle he was furious and asked for permission to attack the Carrancista garrison in the city of Chihuahua. President Wilson refused, knowing that it would certainly start a war.

The action at Parral in April had made the destruction of Villa and his troops secondary to the objective of preventing further attacks on US forces by Carrancistas. The battle at Carrizal brought the countries to the brink of war and forced both governments to make immediate overt gestures clearly showing their intent to avoid it. Although the United States deployed 100,000 troops on the border, by July 4 the major crisis had passed. The Punitive Expedition, US Army remained at Colonia Dublán indefinitely as a fixed-base operation to be a negative incentive to the Carranza government to take seriously its obligation to catch Villa. The Carranza government proved unequal to the task but nevertheless US operations inside Mexico virtually ceased over the next six months.

A Joint High Commission for negotiations with the Carranza government was agreed upon in July, and the first of 52 sessions met on September 6 in New London, Connecticut. Although the commission reached accord on all issues, the negotiations failed to result in a formal agreement for withdrawal of US forces signed by the Mexican government. Despite this, Pershing was ordered on January 18, 1917, to prepare the expedition for return to the United States, which was executed between January 28 and February 5. While the expedition made a dozen successful contacts with Villista groups in the first two months of the campaign, killing many of his important subordinates and 169 of his men, all of whom had participated in the attack on Columbus, it failed in its other major objective of capturing Villa. However, between the date of the American withdrawal and Villa&#x27;s retirement in 1920, Villa&#x27;s troops did not again successfully raid the United States.

==National Guard call-ups==

Between June 1915 and June 1916 Mexican irregulars carried out 38 raids on United States territory, resulting in the deaths of 26 soldiers and 11 civilians. Following the attack on Glenn Springs, the Army transferred three regiments of active duty soldiers to the border area. On May 8, state militia units from Texas, Arizona, and New Mexico were activated. On June 15, 1916, another attempted raid by Mexican border-crossers, this at San Ygnacio, Texas, 30 miles downstream from Laredo, was repulsed by US soldiers with casualties to both sides. As a result, using powers granted by passage of the National Defense Act of 1916, Wilson on June 18 fully mobilized Guard units from the remainder of the states and the District of Columbia for duty on the border. More than 140,000 National Guard troops were called up, but only two regiments, the 1st New Mexico Infantry and the 2nd Massachusetts Infantry, were actually assigned to the Mexican Expedition, and those to guard the base at Columbus. Historian Clarence C. Clendenen asserts that although no Guard units officially crossed into Mexico at any time, soldiers from the two regiments at Columbus did enter Mexico to perform various tasks.

Wide differences in proficiency existed between various Guard units in training, leadership and equipment, but for the most part, units came to the border with only basic drilling as experience. Units were initially assigned as static guards for railroad bridges and border crossing points, but as training made them more proficient, they were assigned increasing responsibilities for patrolling the border that resulted in encounters with smugglers and bandits who still posed an occasional threat. For example, records of the Utah National Guard indicate that it participated in three skirmishes after it arrived at Camp Stephen J. Little on the Arizona border in July 1916. The final action of the three, occurring January 26, 1917, resulted in an all-day border skirmish between Utah cavalrymen and Mexicans in which the Guardsmen were reinforced and ten Mexicans were killed or wounded. While incapable of conducting organized combat operations with other units, the border security mission proved a training environment for the officers and men of the National Guard, who were again inducted into federal service after the United States entered World War I in April 1917. Many National Guard leaders in both world wars traced their first federal service to the Mexican Expedition. In their history of the call-up, Charles Harris and Louis Sadler reveal its significance:

Between June 1916 and April 1917 the guard received intensive field training. Units from different states were sometimes grouped into large provisional units. Not only did the men become more proficient, but many officers gained invaluable experience commanding large formations. At the same time the guard was receiving badly needed equipment and supplies. The great call-up transformed the national guard into a much more effective fighting force, for it was as close as the United States came to the large-scale military maneuvers in which European armies traditionally engaged.

==Aftermath==
After US forces were withdrawn in January 1917, Pershing publicly claimed the expedition to be a success, which in light of the public declarations by President Wilson was clearly not the case since Villa eluded capture by the US Army. Pershing complained privately to his family that Wilson had imposed too many restrictions, which made it impossible for him to fulfill that portion of his mission. In the sting of the moment, having been compelled to withdraw out of political considerations and before much larger events in Europe put the episode behind him, he wrote that &quot;Having dashed into Mexico with the intention of eating the Mexicans raw, we turned back at the first repulse and are now sneaking home under cover, like a whipped curr with its tail between its legs&quot;, referring to the massive rules of political restrictions put on him by President Wilson. Villa, however, gloated about Pershing&#x27;s failure of capturing him with his characteristic harshness &quot;That Pershing, came in like an eagle, and leaves now like a wet chicken&quot;. During the three months of active operations, American forces killed or captured 292 Villistas and captured 605 rifles, 5 pistols, 14 machine guns, and 139 horses and mules from the Villistas. Most of the horses and mules were returned to local residents and the pistols kept as souvenirs. 

Pershing was permitted to bring into New Mexico 527 Chinese refugees who had assisted him during the expedition, despite the ban on Chinese immigration at that time under the Chinese Exclusion Act. The Chinese refugees, known as &quot;Pershing&#x27;s Chinese&quot;, were allowed to remain in the US if they worked under the supervision of the military as cooks and servants on bases. In 1921, Congress passed Public Resolution 29, which allowed them to remain in the country permanently under the conditions of the 1892 Geary Act. Most of them settled in San Antonio, Texas. A number of Mexicans who had supported the US forces as well as American Mormons who had resided in Mexico also returned with Pershing. In 2009 a historical marker giving more details about these refugees was erected at Fort Sam Houston.

Soldiers who took part in the Villa campaign were awarded the Mexican Service Medal.

==Legacy==
The chase after Villa was a small military episode, but it had important long-term implications. It enabled Carranza to mobilize popular anger, strengthen his political position, and permanently escalate anti-American sentiment in Mexico. On the American side, it made Pershing a national figure and, when Funston died of a heart attack shortly after the expedition returned to the United States, an obvious choice to lead the American forces in France in 1917. It gave the inexperienced American army some needed experience in dealing with training, logistics, and command using national guardsmen in a foreign land. It gave the American public a way to work out its frustrations over the European stalemate and it showed that the United States was willing to defend its borders while keeping that demonstration on a small scale.

<doc id="1033167" wikidata="Q818607" url="?curid=1033167" title="Beowulf (1999 film)">
<text>Beowulf is a 1999 American science fantasy-action film loosely based on the Old English epic poem Beowulf. The film was directed by Graham Baker and written by Mark Leahy and David Chappe. Unlike most film adaptations of the poem, this version is a science-fiction/fantasy film that, according to one film critic, &quot;takes place in a post-apocalyptic, techno-feudal future that owes more to &quot;Mad Max&quot; than &quot;Beowulf.&quot;&quot; While the film remains fairly true to the story of the original poem, other plot elements deviate from the original poem (Hrothgar has an affair with Grendel&#x27;s mother, and they have a child together, Grendel; Hrothgar&#x27;s wife commits suicide).

== Plot ==
A castle-like outpost comes under attack by a creature, named Grendel, on a nightly basis. However, it refuses to attack the border lord Hrothgar. One of the outpost&#x27;s residents, Pendra, escapes the following morning but is captured by a rival siege line who intend to kill her to prevent the outpost&#x27;s evil from spreading. Pendra is saved by a mysterious warrior named Beowulf and rides with him, but when she realizes Beowulf is riding for the outpost, she runs back to the siege line and is killed. Beowulf meets Hrothgar and is permitted to stay to help slay the beast. Hrothgar, his daughter Kyra, and his military leader Roland suspect that Beowulf was sent by a rival family to avenge the death of their son Nivri, Kyra&#x27;s former husband. However, Kyra&#x27;s suspicions dissipate when she realizes that Beowulf can sense evil.

For a few nights, Hrothgar experiences nightmares about his late wife&#x27;s suicide, triggered by a mysterious woman who stalks him in his sleep. When Grendel attacks during the day, Beowulf and Hrothgar&#x27;s remaining soldiers are forced to confront Grendel. They evacuate the women and children to a sanctuary, but they are immediately slaughtered by Grendel. Beowulf manages to wound Grendel, but is also wounded in the process. As Kyra attends to Beowulf, Roland confesses his romantic feelings for her; however, she only sees him as a brother. After Beowulf recovers, Kyra reveals that Nivri was an abusive spouse and she killed him after he attempted to force himself on her. Beowulf believes she was justified. Beowulf faces Grendel again and severs its arm. Believing Grendel to be dead, the survivors celebrate and Roland is lured by the woman, who kills him.

Kyra discloses her romantic feelings to Beowulf and the two have sex. Afterwards, Beowulf reveals to Kyra that he is half-human because his mother was impregnated by Bael and he is only able to suppress his inner evil by battling evil. Beowulf senses the mysterious woman and rushes to find her. Kyra and Hrothgar return to the dining hall to find everyone dead, including Roland. They encounter her, who reveals herself to be Grendel&#x27;s mother and Hrothgar as its father, hence why Grendel had spared him before. Hrothgar&#x27;s unfaithfulness led to his wife&#x27;s suicide. Hrothgar attempts to kill the succubus but is killed by Grendel. Beowulf arrives and kills the beast. Grendel&#x27;s mother attempts to appeal to Beowulf&#x27;s inner evil to seduce him, but fails and transforms into a giant humanoid spider-like creature. After Beowulf defeats her, their battle forces the outpost to collapse on itself. Beowulf and Kyra escape, and she convinces him to let her accompany him on his journeys.

==Production==
The production was filmed in Romania. The film&#x27;s end credits says: &quot;Filmed on location in Romania&quot;. The specific location is the city of Rupea, in Transylvania.

==Themes==
As with other &quot;Beowulf&quot; adaptations, the film reinterprets the poem, blending its original genre with &quot;tropes from horror and soft pornography,&quot; but it also retains and expands on its original elements.

The film addresses the poem&#x27;s plot point of Beowulf not having a wife or an heir, as it reveals Beowulf to be the same kind of creature as the monsters themselves, making him refusing to produce offspring. The poem&#x27;s emphasis on genealogy is represented by humans and monsters mating with each other, with Grendel being the son of Hrothgar and Beowulf being the result of a god of darkness inseminating a woman. Beowulf and Grendel are shown as mirror images of each other, as the former harbors an internal struggle to contain his monstrous nature, while the latter was conceived by his mother as a revenge for an external oppression.

Grendel&#x27;s mother is portrayed as a representation of monstrous female sexuality. She operates as a seductive succubus, giving birth to monsters, but can also shapeshift into a monster herself. This form resembles a dragon, an arachnid and a gorgon, not only evoking the Freudian Medusa&#x27;s Head, but also evoking the archaic mother by resembling a vagina dentata with phallic talons. She also sexually attacks Hrothgar, inverting the trope of horror film monsters chasing after female leads.

==Music==

The film&#x27;s soundtrack mainly featured electronic and industrial songs from various artists and original score material by Juno Reactor&#x27;s Ben Watkins.

==Critical response==
Critical reaction to the film has been highly negative. The general criticisms for the film were the weak script, below-average acting, corny dialogue, deviations from the source material, and over-reliance on camp, although it was hailed for its production design. Danél Griffin of Film as Art said the film &quot;understands that liberties must be taken with the poem&#x27;s characters to create a more cinematic experience, and there are moments that, even in its liberties, it reveals a deep appreciation for the poem, and a profound understanding of its ideas. There are other moments, however, that seem so absurd and outlandish that we wonder if the writers, Mark Leahy and David Chappe, have even read the poem.&quot; Griffin added that &quot;Lambert is certainly effective&quot;, but concluded that &quot;clever ideas aside, the film is unfortunately mediocre at best. The set design and some of the revised storyline are both stupendous, but the overall experience makes for poor cinema.&quot;

Beyond Hollywood&#x27;s review said that &quot;genre films don&#x27;t get any sillier than this&quot;, but called the film &quot;above average&quot;. The review praised the film&#x27;s &quot;energetic action&quot; and said that it &quot;excels in set design&quot;, but added that &quot;the techno (music) is pretty annoying.&quot; Calling the film &quot;a cheesy post-apocalyptic update of the ancient tale&quot;, Carlo Cavagna of About Film praised the film&#x27;s action scenes but felt that Lambert and Mitra had no chemistry.

Literature scholars have been negative as well. Michael Livingstone and John William Sutton are brief, calling it an &quot;an otherwise ridiculous&quot; film, though they say it well reflects the problematization of &quot;black-and-white morality&quot; &quot;in our postmodern, post Vietnam, post-9/11 era.&quot; Commenting on the movie&#x27;s proposed similarity between Beowulf and Grendel, they say, &quot;although the film is cringingly hokey and melodramatic, it effectively illustrates the idea of the &quot;&quot;—that Beowulf and the monsters may have more in common than we care to admit.&quot;

<text>Isaiah Robinson (unknown – c. 1781) was a captain in the Continental Navy during the American Revolutionary War.

==Biography== 
Robinson, probably born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was a member of the Philadelphia Ship Masters&#x27; Association and served as a lieutenant on the with Joshua Barney. He later commanded the 10-gun Continental sloop-of-war , fitted out by the Marine Committee shortly after Admiral Esek Hopkins&#x27; fleet sailed for New Providence in 1776, and captured a six-gun British letter of marque off the Virginia Capes.
Appointed captain in the Continental Navy on 10 October 1776, he assumed command of the 14-gun brig . One of the more important smaller boats of the Continental Navy, the brig sailed under orders of the Secret Committee, dated 17 October 1776, for the Dutch island of Sint Eustatius to take on a cargo of military stores. When the &quot; Andrew Doria&quot; entered the harbor at Sint Eustatius on 16 November, it received one of the first gun salutes rendered to the American flag (at the time, the Grand Union Flag).

Upon the return voyage in late November, he captured the British 12-gun sloop-of-war after a two-hour engagement near Puerto Rico.

The following year, Captain Robinson cruised against enemy shipping off Cape May, but was finally blockaded in the Delaware River. During the defense of Philadelphia, and following the destruction of Fort Mifflin on 15 November 1777, he was forced to burn &quot;Andrew Doria&quot; to prevent the vessel from falling into enemy hands. He commanded the 12-gun Pennsylvania privateer &quot;Pomona&quot; in 1779 and succeeded in taking several British privateers.

The date of his death is unknown, but his will, dated 12 August 1777, was probated in the city of Philadelphia on 25 September 1781.

==Legacy==
The destroyers and were named in his honor.

Robinson appears in John Edward Jennings&#x27; 1950 historical novel &quot;The Sea Eagles&quot;.

<doc id="1033173" wikidata="Q2954025" url="?curid=1033173" title="Netball World Cup">
<text>The Netball World Cup is a quadrennial international netball world championship organised by World Netball, inaugurated in 1963. Since its inception the competition has been dominated primarily by the Australia national netball team and the New Zealand national netball team, Trinidad and Tobago is the only other team to have won a title (a three-way tie in the 1979 championship). The most recent tournament was the 2023 Netball World Cup in Cape Town, South Africa, which was won by Australia.

==History==

In 1960, representatives from Australia, England, New Zealand, South Africa and the West Indies met to discuss standardising the rules of the sport. This led to the establishment of the International Federation of Women&#x27;s Basketball and Netball (which later became the International Federation of Netball Associations). Formal rules were established at this inaugural meeting and a decision to hold World Championship tournaments every four years was also made. The first World Netball Championship was held in 1963 and was hosted by England. The tournament was renamed to the World Cup as opposed to &quot;Championships&quot; in 2015. Since 1991 the tournament has maintained a format allowing semi-finals and finals matches to be played, where previously the tournament held no finals and instead utilised the round-robin system, which occasionally led to more than one nation being crowned world champions.

Australia or New Zealand have won all of the titles, though emerging netball nations England, South Africa and Jamaica have come close to dislodging the top-tier nations on several occasions. In 1979 Australia, New Zealand and Trinidad and Tobago were all joint champions. South Africa finished runners-up in 1995, England too in 2023. Jamaica have contested several bronze medal matches and come up short in narrow semi-final defeats. The reigning world champions are Australia, who defeated England in the 2023 final. They will defend their title in Sydney, Australia in 2027.

<doc id="1033177" wikidata="Q5166129" url="?curid=1033177" title="Convenience">
<text>Convenient procedures, products and services are those intended to increase ease in accessibility, save resources (such as time, effort and energy) and decrease frustration. A modern convenience is a labor-saving device, service or substance which make a task easier or more efficient than a traditional method. Convenience is a relative concept, and depends on context. For example, automobiles were once considered a convenience, yet today are regarded as a normal part of life.

Because differences in lifestyles around the world, the term is a relative term based upon the conveniences previously available to a person or group. For instance, an American definition of &#x27;modern convenience&#x27; is likely different from that of an individual living in a developing country. Most of the time, the term &#x27;modern convenience&#x27; is used to express personal lifestyle and home life.

==Examples==
Service conveniences are those that save shoppers time or effort, and includes variables such as credit availability and extended store hours. Service convenience pertains to the facilitation of selling both goods and services, and combinations of the two.

Convenience goods are widely distributed products that &quot;require minimal time and physical and mental effort to purchase.&quot;

Ready meals and convenience cooking spare the consumer effort in preparation of a meal while providing high levels of energy and pronounced, if mostly artificial, flavour.

Filling stations sell items that have nothing to do with refuelling a motor vehicle, (e.g. milk, newspapers, cigarettes) but purchasing at that location can save the consumer time compared to making a separate journey to a supermarket. Conveniences such as can save companies and consumers money, though this may or may not be passed along to the consumer.

Some conveniences can become nuisances when they break down or don&#x27;t function correctly. It costs time and money to fix items of convenience when they break down, and may cause much greater costs if something else that depends on them cannot take place.

==History==
===Late 20th century===
Household
In 1911, architect and author Louis. H. Gibson defined modern conveniences as &quot;those arrangements and appliances which make it possible for people to live comfort ably in a larger house, without seriously increasing the cares which they had in a smaller one&quot;. The supposition is that at that time if a family lived in a smaller home, they would have less furniture, appliances and other goods to take care of, and as a result the family&#x27;s lifestyle and housekeeping would be relatively easy. If, on the other hand, a family moved into a larger home the increase area and furnishings would be much more difficult to manage without labor-saving devices.

Examples of modern conveniences at that time included:
* Kitchen sinks with tap water hot and cold running water and wastewater drainage
* The addition of bathrooms as separate rooms with sinks and toilets, also with waste water and sewage drainage
* A furnace, also identified as a significant cost savings
* Closets in bedrooms, bathrooms, hallway for linen, broom closets
* Gas lighting, stoves and fireplaces, where gas was available
* Icebox or refrigerator

===20th century===
The homes of the 20th century are much bigger than the homes of our family members from the 19th century, both in terms of square footage and number of rooms. Homes built at the beginning of the 21st century have 2–3 times more rooms than homes at the turn of the 20th century. In terms of square footage, new homes built in 2000 are 50% larger than a home built in the 1960s.

The 20th century also enjoyed a proliferation of home appliances like washing machines, dryers, dishwashers, microwave ovens, frost-free refrigerators, water heaters, air conditioning, vacuum cleaners, and irons. Electricity and innovative electronics products including stereo equipment, color television, answering machine, and video cassette recorders also facilitated modern life.

===21st century===

Comparison of modern conveniences in new housing construction

In his 2011 book &quot;America&#x27;s Ticking Bankruptcy Bomb: How the Looming Debt Crisis Threatens the American Dream—and How We Can Turn the Tide Before It&#x27;s Too Late&quot;, Peter Ferrara says that the residential access to modern convenience is markedly different in the 21st century compared to the beginning of the 20th century:
Upcoming technological advancements
David Kirkpatrick, author of &quot;The Facebook Effect&quot; (2010), wrote in an article called &quot;Tech Targets the Third World&quot; projects that technological advancements in education and health care, mobile computing and broadband will empower the poor and provide economic opportunities that they would not otherwise have access. These technologies are relatively easy and cost-effective to implement because of technological advancements that have driven down the costs and because developing countries do not have expensive and outdated legacy systems to manage emerging technology.

==Religious groups==
Religious groups that shun modern conveniences include Anabaptists (and their direct descendants, the Amish, Hutterites, and Mennonites) and Judaism.

===Anabaptists===
Key beliefs that determine an Anabaptist community&#x27;s position on use of modern conveniences are:
* The belief that in order to enter the Kingdom of God, they must live apart from the &quot;world&quot;, or the unreformed.
* Avoiding &quot;worldly&quot; behaviors that pull their attention and intentions away from their religious community.

===Orthodox and Conservative Judaism===
For Orthodox and Conservative Jews, Shabbat is the seventh day of the Jewish week and is a day of rest in Judaism. Shabbat is observed from a few minutes before sunset on Friday evening until a few minutes after the appearance of three stars in the sky on Saturday night. On Shabbat, Jews recall the Genesis creation narrative describing God creating the Heavens and the Earth in six days and resting on the seventh. It also recalls the giving of the Torah at Mount Sinai, when God commanded the Israelite nation to observe the seventh day and keep it holy. Shabbat is considered a festive day, when a Jew is freed from the regular labors of everyday life, can contemplate the spiritual aspects of life, and can spend time with family.

Orthodox and some Conservative authorities rule that there are 39 prohibited activities of work (referred to as &quot;melakhot&quot;), such as turning electric devices on or off, driving cars, and more, during the Shabbat, as listed in Mishnah Tractate Shabbat.

==Consequences==
There are many ramifications of the development of modern conveniences for individuals and their families over the past 150 or more years. The many labor-saving devices have kept pace with growing houses and furnishings and allow for greater leisure. There are also some negative effects, some of which are also as the result of advancements in chemical technology in the food that we eat or products that we use. In these cases there are also conflicting opinions about the extent to which some of the products are harmful. Here are a few examples of positive and negative effects of modern conveniences.

===Positive effects===
====Health care====
Some of the major improvements over the past century has been in improved health care. For example, modern medicine has made leaps in preventing infectious diseases in part due to improved water and sewage treatment. This is obvious in the marked rises in life expectancy.

====Technological advancement in underdeveloped countries====
Some of the most dramatic technological benefits are seen in underdeveloped countries. For instance, cabling for landline telephone service is expensive and requires a lot of time to complete, especially in the most remote areas. Introduction of cellphone service, on the other hand, is much cheaper and dramatically improves individual&#x27;s ability to be economically productive, often in microbusinesses. It is estimated that 80% of the world&#x27;s population is now located within range of cellular towers, 1.5 billion cellular phones are in use in developing countries and, in India alone, five million customers sign up for cellular service each week. The Four Asian Tigers—i.e., Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, and South Korea—are a few of the countries that have leveraged technology to become a presence in the global community.

:Another example, led by Nicholas Negroponte of MIT&#x27;s Media Lab in rural Asia, Latin America and Africa, provides $100 laptop computers to underdeveloped countries.

===Negative effects===
In 1905, the &quot;Journal of the American Medical Association&quot; published an article titled &quot;Nervous Strain&quot; about how &quot;modern conveniences&quot; make our lives busier and with less direct contact than the preceding generations. As an example, the author compared having a calming cup of tea with a person to the more distant practice of placing a telephone call. Labor-saving devices meant that people now spent more time sitting, breathed machine-generated smoke, and ate food, especially meat, fat and sugars, in greater abundance, changing peoples&#x27; diets. These activities were speculated to result in high blood pressure, obesity, and &quot;nervous strain&quot;.

====Meat consumption====

Because of the enormous productivity growth in intensive agriculture and meat industry, meat has become a major part of the diet in most developed countries and is on the rise in developing countries. Red meat consumption has been linked to colon cancer; besides, growth hormone and antibiotics treatment of cattle and poultry has raised serious concerns about the adverse effects of those substances in industrially produced meat.

====Processed food and food preparation====
:Processed foods, high-fructose corn syrup, and increased fat—the greater reliance on processed, packaged, microwaveable food has resulted in a rise in Type 2 diabetes, obesity, and other health concerns. Margarine, once seen as a great alternative to butter, does not help with absorption of nutrients and may contribute to heart disease.

====Other====
:Styrofoam cups release styrene as the food or drink is consumed. Leaded fuel is another hazardous chemical. Although it has been outlawed in the United States, its use in developing countries impacts the health of local people and the global environment.

<text>A pet passport is a document that officially records information related to a specific animal, as part of that procedure. The effect is to drastically speed up and simplify travel with and transport of animals between member countries, compared to previous procedures if the regulations are followed. The Pet Travel Scheme (PETS) is a system which allows animals to travel easily between member countries of the European Union without undergoing quarantine.

==History==
On 1 October 2001, the European Union introduced the Pet Travel Scheme (PETS), under which animals from any member country may freely travel to any other member country on approved carriers.
In December 2014, EU regulation 576/2013 went into effect, standardising the rules for the transport of pets within the EU. This includes the requirement to present identification for the pet. The rules governing the identification documents are standardised under EU regulation 577/2013. Pet passports issued prior to 2014 retain their validity.

Over time the EU scheme has recognised other countries, such as Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United States, and relaxed some of the entry requirements for pets travelling from these countries.

== Appearance ==

The pet passport itself comes in multiple forms, sometimes a pink A4 sheet, sometimes a small blue booklet. It contains the microchip or tattoo number of the animal, the certification that the animal has had a rabies vaccination, and needs to be signed by an officially approved veterinarian.

A new style passport with laminated strips and additional security measures was introduced in the UK in December 2014. Old style passports remain valid, although passports issued in the UK ceased to be valid after the end of the Brexit transition period.

The passport is not to be confused with the folder routinely issued by vets, which records the complete vaccination history of the pet.

== Procedure ==
Every country has different requirements, both for export and import of animals, although some features are common to all.

=== Requirements ===
* Subcutaneous (below the skin) microchip implant that meets the International Society of Pharmacovigilance (ISoP) specification
* Certified rabies vaccination and results from a blood serum test to confirm the presence of rabies antibodies. For pet travel in Europe, the rabies vaccine should be administered by a veterinarian a minimum of 21 days before travel. Some countries may differ.
* Proof of treatment for ticks, fleas and tapeworms 
* Veterinarian&#x27;s letter or certificate confirming fitness to travel and/or no obvious signs of disease
* Government certification that the veterinarian&#x27;s export documentation and certificates are in order for travel
In some countries, the formal passport is needed. Others will accept documentation in any form so long as it provides clear evidence of the procedure being followed. Usually, the animal and its papers are checked thoroughly upon both departure and arrival.

A pet passport alone can be used to enter some countries if it records all relevant information (e.g., the UK), but it will not suffice to enter many countries. For instance Guatemala, in common with almost every country operating such a scheme, demands that all imported pets have a rabies vaccination, but will not accept the pet passport as proof of said vaccination. They require the proof of the rabies vaccination in the animal&#x27;s records.

Tapeworm treatment must be administered by a vet not less than 24 hours and not more than 120 hours (1–5 days) before scheduled arrival time.

=== Specific country regulations ===

==== United Kingdom ====
The rules for bringing pets into the UK can be quite complex. The official UK Government website covers this topic in detail. Dogs, cats and ferrets with Pet Passports from EU (and some other) countries can enter the UK via specified routes and ferry companies, including the Channel Tunnel by car. Before entering the UK, most pet dogs (including assistance dogs), but not cats or ferrets, must be treated for tapeworm. The treatment must be administered by a vet not less than 24 hours and not more than 120 hours (1–5 days) before its scheduled arrival time in the UK. (There is no mandatory requirement for tick treatment.) No treatment is required for dogs entering the UK from Finland, Ireland, Norway or Malta. All animals (except guide dogs) travelling by air to the UK must travel in the hold as manifest cargo and can only use specific airports and airlines. (Similar rules apply to pets arriving by sea, other than by specific ferry services.) British law precludes all animals entering the UK by air either in the cabin or in the hold as excess or checked baggage. Most airlines do not offer cargo services to individual passengers directly and specialist agents are normally used. UK law does not prohibit the transport of dogs and cats in the cabin or as hold baggage when departing from the UK, but restrictions may be imposed by individual airlines or destination countries. Swiss Airlines publishes a guide which is typical of the services provided by several European airlines.

==== Japan ====
Although a participant in PETS, to bring pets into Japan from member states there are several separate procedures that must be followed. These do not cover Iceland, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, Hawaii and Guam, which have designated (rabies-free) region status. If a pet is taken out of Japan, it may take between six months to a year for it to re-enter. Including prior contact with Japanese Quarantine several months before entry:
* The dog or cat must be microchipped.
* The dog or cat must have stayed in the country for at least 180 days (6 months) since its birth or having left Japan.
* The dog or cat must have had 2 rabies injections and a blood test 6 month before entering/re-entering Japan, proving the pet is free of rabies. This test must be carried out at a designated laboratory.
* The dog or cat does not have or show signs of rabies or leptospirosis (dogs only).

To take a dog or cat out of Japan, on top of the necessary injections and microchip, travellers must:
* Have certificates issued by an official vet to prove that their pet has been vaccinated, microchipped and dewormed as necessary. These are vets designated by the prefecture as able to issue certificates and officially vaccinate pets. 
* More than a week before travelling, the Animal Quarantine Service must be notified at the port of departure, and an export inspection for the pet applied for. Inspections are carried out by the Quarantine Office () before the pet is checked in.

== Other information ==

The PETS scheme is not yet standardised, which can lead to much confusion. Every journey between any two countries may differ in requirements for the animal to be accepted upon arrival at the departure point.

* The major delay in obtaining a pet passport is the time required for the rabies vaccination. The implications are:
*# An animal may get a valid rabies vaccination and serology check, and then apply for a passport on the spot, at a later date.
*# An animal whose rabies vaccination is allowed to go out of date (typically 1–2 years) by even one day, without a booster, must start with a new vaccination and delay.
* Because PETS is European wide, regulations may differ for travel within and outside Europe. Requirements for travel to a destination may be quite different from the requirements upon returning.
* A suitable and carrier-approved travel crate may be required, which must have the correct food and water containers as set out by the relevant bodies
* Animals should not be sedated for air travel since altitude can affect medications. Most airlines will not accept tranquilised animals. Instead, they are kept in a dark, heated, pressurised hold, which encourages them to sleep for the duration of travel.
* Larger animals may be restricted to airline routes which can accommodate their crates. Not all airlines will carry animals, and charges vary widely.
* Some routes will not fly animals if the temperature is adverse
* On some airlines, animals may travel as excess baggage or cargo. Excess baggage (in effect treating the crate and animal as another suitcase) ensures they travel on the same flight and is often much cheaper.
* The UK restricts incoming flights to ship animals as cargo. A cheaper alternative is to fly to another European city, such as Paris or Amsterdam, and then travel to the UK by rail or ferry instead, which do not have this restriction. Passengers travelling with animals by rail or ferry to or from the UK must in many cases have access to a vehicle, as animals cannot be taken directly on foot by Eurostar, nor on most ferry routes. After arriving in Europe from a non-EU participating country, the certificate received from customs or quarantine is valid for Europe-wide travel for up to 4 months.

<text>Nancy Barrett (born October 5, 1941) is an American actress. She is best known for her portrayal of Carolyn Stoddard (among other characters) in the 1960s gothic soap opera &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;.

==Biography==
Barrett was born in Shreveport, Louisiana, but most of her early life was spent in Bartlesville, Oklahoma. After completing high school, she entered Baylor University in Waco, Texas, but she spent her final year of college at UCLA.

After graduating from UCLA, she married Ralph Pine, her agent. The couple moved to New York City, New York, where she landed the role of &quot;Carolyn Stoddard&quot; on the gothic soap opera &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; in June 1966. While on the show, she met David Ford, who was one of the other actors on the show. Following her divorce from Pine, Barrett and Ford married in 1967; the marriage lasted two years. Barrett, Ford, and her future &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; co-star Jerry Lacy all appeared on stage at the Wayside Theatre in 1967.

While on &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;, she appeared in two films based on the series – &quot;House of Dark Shadows&quot; (1970) and &quot;Night of Dark Shadows&quot; (1971). The series itself was canceled in April 1971. She appeared in a total of four hundred and three episodes.

Barrett married psychiatrist Harold Kaplan in the early seventies. Throughout that decade, she appeared on numerous soaps, including &quot;The Doctors&quot;, &quot;One Life to Live&quot;, and &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot;. She made her last onscreen appearance in 1986&#x27;s &quot;Belizaire the Cajun&quot;.

In 2009, she reprised her role of Carolyn in the audio drama &quot;Curse of the Pharaoh&quot;. Barrett&#x27;s husband, the aforementioned Harold Kaplan, died in January 1998. Since his passing, she has appeared in the New York production of Francis Patrelle&#x27;s &quot;The Yorkville Nutcracker&quot;, marking her ballet debut.

Nancy married practicing New York dentist Stuart S. Leichter D.D.S. in 2005. Stuart died in Arizona after a long illness in 2017.

<doc id="1033199" wikidata="Q1203713" url="?curid=1033199" title="Pump action">
<text>Pump action is a type of manual firearm action that is operated by moving a sliding handguard on the gun&#x27;s forestock. When shooting, the sliding forend is pulled rearward to eject any expended cartridge and typically to cock the hammer or striker, and then pushed forward to load a new cartridge into the chamber. Most pump-action firearms use an integral tubular magazine, although some do use detachable box magazines. Pump-action firearms are typically associated with shotguns, although it has also been used in rifles, grenade launchers, and other types of firearms. A firearm using this operating mechanism is colloquially referred to as a pumpgun.

Because the forend is manipulated usually with the support hand, a pump-action firearm is much faster than a bolt-action and somewhat faster than a lever-action, as it does not require the trigger hand to be removed from the trigger while reloading. Also because the action is cycled in a linear fashion, it creates less torque that can tilt and throw the gun off aim when repeat-firing rapidly.

==History==
The first slide action patent, in both single-shot breech-loader and repeating magazine form, was issued to Lewis Jennings of America in 1849, although the pump was actuated via a ring trigger rather than a sliding handguard underneath the barrel. Alexander Bain of Britain patented a pump action harmonica gun in 1854 that was actuated via a sliding piece underneath the barrel. Another pump action firearm with a magazine was the gun patented in America on the 22nd of May in 1866 by Josiah V. Meigs although the pump action was actuated via the trigger guard rather than a sliding handguard underneath the barrel. The first magazine-using pump-action firearm to operate using a sliding handguard underneath the barrel was the firearm patented by William Krutzsch of Britain on the 27th of August in 1866, a few months after Meigs. The first pump-action shotgun to be sold commercially and in substantial quantities was the Spencer 1882.

Many older pump-action shotguns can be fired faster than modern ones, as they often did not have a trigger disconnector, and were capable of firing a new round as fast as the pump action was cycled, with the trigger held down continuously. This technique is called a slamfire, and was often used in conjunction with the M1897 and M1912 shotguns in World War I trench warfare.

Modern pump-action designs are a little slower than a semi-automatic shotgun, but the pump-action offers greater flexibility in selection of shotshells, allowing the shooter to mix different types of loads and for using low-power or specialty loads. Semi-automatic shotguns must use some of the energy of each round fired to cycle their actions, meaning that they must be loaded with shells powerful enough to reliably cycle. The pump-action avoids this limitation. In addition, like all manual action guns, pump-action guns are inherently more reliable than semi-automatic guns under adverse conditions, such as exposure to dirt, sand, or climatic extremes. Thus, until recently, military combat shotguns were almost exclusively pump-action designs.

==Disadvantages==
Like most lever-action rifles and shotguns, the majority of pump-action shotguns and rifles use a fixed tubular magazine. This makes for slow reloading, as the cartridges have to be inserted individually into the magazine of the firearm. However, some pump-action shotguns and rifles, including the Russian Zlatoust RB-12, Italian Valtro PM5, American Remington 7600 series, and the Mossberg 590M, use detachable box magazines.

==Layout==
A pump-action firearm is typically fed from a tubular magazine underneath the barrel, which also serves as a guide to the movable forend. The rounds are fed in one by one through a port in the receiver, where they are pushed forward. A latch at the rear of the magazine holds the rounds in place in the magazine until they are needed. If it is desired to load the gun fully, a round may be loaded through the ejection port directly into the chamber, or cycled from the magazine, which is then topped off with another round. Pump shotguns with detachable box magazines or even drums exist, and may or may not allow the magazine to be inserted without stripping the top round.

==Operating cycle==
Nearly all pump-actions use a back-and-forward motion of the forend to cycle the action. Only a few pump-actions use the &quot;reverse&quot; or forward-and-back motion of the forend to cycle the action, a few examples are the Russian RMB-93 and South African NeoStead 2000. The forend is connected to the bolt by one or two bars; two bars are considered more reliable because it provides symmetric forces on the bolt and pump and reduces the chances of binding. The motion of the bolt back and forth in a tubular magazine model will also operate the &quot;elevator&quot;, which lifts the shells from the level of the magazine to the level of the barrel.

After firing a round, the bolt is unlocked and the forend is free to move. The shooter pulls back on the forend to begin the operating cycle. The bolt unlocks and begins to move to the rear, which extracts and ejects the empty shell from the chamber, cocks the hammer, and begins to load the new shell. In a tubular magazine design, as the bolt moves rearwards, a single shell is released from the magazine, and is pushed backwards to come to rest on the elevator.

As the forend reaches the rear and begins to move forward, the elevator lifts up the shell, lining it up with the barrel. As the bolt moves forward, the round slides into the chamber, and the final portion of the forend&#x27;s travel locks the bolt into position. A pull of the trigger will fire the next round, where the cycle begins again.

Most pump-action firearms do not have any positive indication that they are out of ammunition, so it is possible to complete a cycle and have an empty chamber. The risk of running out of ammunition unexpectedly can be minimized in a tubular magazine firearm by topping off the magazine by loading new rounds to replace the rounds that have just been fired. This is especially important when hunting, as many locations have legal limits on the magazine capacity: for example, three rounds for shotguns and five rounds for rifles.

The BSA Machine Carbine used a unique pump-action that also required twisting the handguard.

Another variant was the Burgess Folding Shotgun from the late 19th century where instead of manipulating the forend to cycle the action, it had a sleeve around the grip area of the stock which the shooter would slide back and forward to cycle the gun. This was done because the forend based pump action was under patent at the time.

==Shotguns==

Pump-action shotguns, also called pump shotguns, slide-action repeating shotguns or slide-action shotguns are the most commonly seen pump-action firearms. These shotguns typically use a tubular magazine underneath the gun barrel to hold the shells, though there are some variants that use a box magazine like most rifles. It&#x27;s not uncommon to see extra ammunition stored in externally mounted &quot;shell holder&quot; racks (usually as &quot;sidesaddle&quot; on one side of the receiver, or on the buttstock) for quick on-field reloading. The shells are chambered and extracted by pulling/pushing the sliding fore-end enveloping the tubular magazine toward the user.

In modern shotguns, the fore-end can be replaceable and often include picatinny rails or M-LOK for mounting accessories such as a tactical light, and the traditional straight grip might be replaced with a pistol grip for a more stable control.

===Trigger disconnectors===
Modern pump shotgun designs, such as the Remington 870 and Mossberg 500, have a safety feature called a trigger disconnector, which disconnects the trigger from the sear as the bolt moves back, so that the trigger must be released and pulled again to fire the shotgun after it closes. Many early pump shotguns, such as the Winchester 1897, did not have trigger disconnectors, and would, if the trigger were held back, fire immediately upon closing. Due to the higher rate of fire that this allows, some shooters prefer models without this feature, such as the Ithaca 37, Stevens Model 520/620, and Winchester Model 12.

==Rifles==

When used in rifles, this action is also commonly called a slide action. In the late 19th and early 20th century it was referred to as a trombone action, because it functioned similarly to the musical instrument of the same name. Colt manufactured the Colt Lightning Carbine from 1884 to 1904 chambered in .44-40 caliber. The slide action Winchester Model 1890 chambered in .22 caliber was one of the most successful repeating rimfire rifle made by Winchester. Approximately 849,000 Model 1890 rifles were produced between 1890 and 1932. Later pump-action rifles were also manufactured by Winchester, Marlin, Browning and Remington.

A &quot;reverse pump-action&quot; design can sometimes be found, where the extraction is done by pushing the fore-end forwards, and re-chambered by pulling backwards. One such 21st-century variant is the Krieghoff Semprio &quot;in-line repeating rifle&quot;. The Semprio is a reverse pump-action system that ejects cartridges when the fore-end is pushed forward and loads the chamber when pulled backward. The Semprio&#x27;s 7-lug bolt head design displays a locking surface of compared to the of the Mauser M98 bolt-action rifle.

==Airguns==
The term &quot;pump-action&quot; can also be applied to various airsoft guns and air guns, which use a similar mechanism to both load a pellet and compress a spring piston for power, or pneumatic guns where a pump is used to compress the air used for power. See the airgun article for information on how spring piston and pneumatic airguns work.

==Grenade launchers==

The 43mm GM-94 is a pump-action grenade launcher developed by the KBP design bureau for use by Russian special forces. It carries three rounds in an above-the-barrel tubular magazine.

Another pump-action grenade launcher is the China Lake grenade launcher, which saw usage by the U.S. Navy SEALS in the Vietnam War in limited numbers.

<text>The Merger Treaty, also known as the Treaty of Brussels, was a European treaty which unified the executive institutions of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) and the European Economic Community (EEC). The treaty was signed in Brussels on 8 April 1965 and came into force on 1 July 1967. It set out that the Commission of the European Communities should replace the High Authority of the ECSC, the Commission of the EEC and the Commission of Euratom, and that the Council of the European Communities should replace the Special Council of Ministers of the ECSC, the Council of the EEC and the Council of Euratom. Although each Community remained legally independent, they shared common institutions (prior to this treaty, they already shared a Parliamentary Assembly and Court of Justice) and were together known as the European Communities. This treaty is regarded by some as the real beginning of the modern European Union.

This treaty was abrogated by the Amsterdam Treaty signed in 1997:

<doc id="1033203" wikidata="Q849649" url="?curid=1033203" title="Prajñā (Buddhism)">
<text>&#x27; () or &#x27; () is a Buddhist term often translated as &quot;wisdom&quot;, &quot;insight&quot;, &quot;intelligence&quot;, or &quot;understanding&quot;. It is described in Buddhist texts as the understanding of the true nature of phenomena. In the context of Buddhist meditation, it is the ability to understand the three characteristics of all things: (&quot;impermanence&quot;), (&quot;dissatisfaction&quot; or &quot;suffering&quot;), and (&quot;non-self&quot; or &quot;egolessness&quot;). Mahāyāna texts describe it as the understanding of (&quot;emptiness&quot;). It is part of the Threefold Training in Buddhism, and is one of the ten of Theravāda Buddhism and one of the six Mahāyāna .

==Etymology==
 is often translated as &quot;wisdom&quot;, but according to Buddhist bioethics scholar Damien Keown, it is closer in meaning to &quot;insight&quot;, &quot;non-discriminating knowledge&quot;, or &quot;intuitive apprehension&quot;. The component parts of the word are:

; &quot;Pra&quot; () : an intensifier which can be translated as &quot;higher&quot;, &quot;greater&quot;, &quot;supreme&quot; or &quot;premium&quot;, or &quot;being born or springing up&quot;, referring to a spontaneous type of knowing
; &quot;jñā&quot; () : can be translated as &quot;consciousness&quot;, &quot;knowledge&quot;, or &quot;understanding&quot; 

Pali scholars T. W. Rhys Davids and William Stede define () as &quot;intelligence, comprising all the higher faculties of cognition&quot; and &quot;intellect as conversant with general truths&quot;.

British Buddhist monk and Pāli scholar Ñāṇamoli Bhikkhu translates (), as &quot;understanding&quot;, specifically the &quot;state of understanding&quot;. Ñāṇamoli Bhikkhu notes that Pāli makes a distinction between the &quot;state of understanding&quot; () and the &quot;act of understanding&quot; () in a way different from how English does.

==Role in Buddhist traditions==
 is the fourth virtue of ten found in late canonic (Khuddaka Nikāya) and Theravādan commentary, and the sixth of the six Mahāyāna . It is the third level of the Threefold Training in Buddhism consisting of , , and .

===Theravada Buddhism===
Theravada Buddhist commentator Acariya Dhammapala describes as the comprehension of the characteristics of things or phenomena with skillful means. Dhammapala states that has the attribute of penetrating the true nature of phenomena.

Abhidharma commentaries relate that there are three types of :

# learned ()
#: knowledge or wisdom that is acquired from books or listening to others.
# reflective ()
#: knowledge or wisdom that is acquired from thought or logic and reasoning.
# from spiritual development ()
#:knowledge or wisdom that is acquired from direct spiritual experience. Fifth-century Theravada commentator Buddhaghosa states that this category of knowledge is produced from higher meditative absorptions.

Thai Buddhist monk and meditation-master Ajahn Lee classifies the first two types of as on the theory-level and the last as on the practice-level. Ajahn Lee states that this results in two levels of : mundane which is the comprehension of worldly and subjects, and transcendent which is an awareness of the supramundane that is realized by enlightened beings.

Abhidharma commentaries describe seven ways to gain :

# asking a wise person
# keeping things clean
# balancing the five faculties (faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom)
# avoiding foolish people
# associating with wise people
# reflecting on and analyzing the 
# having the mind inclined towards developing wisdom
Buddhaghosa states in his commentary and meditation treatise, the &quot;Visuddhimagga&quot;, that there are many different types and aspects of but does not define them all. Buddhaghosa specifies in relation to Buddhist meditation as being specifically (&quot;insight wisdom&quot;), meaning insight knowledge endowed with virtue.

Buddhaghosa defines as “knowing in a particular mode separate from the modes of perceiving () and cognizing ()”. Buddhaghosa makes the analogy of how a child, villager, and money-changer sees money to explain his definition. The child can perceive () coins through the senses but does not know the value, the villager knows the value of the coins and is conscious () of the coins&#x27; characteristics as a medium of exchange, and the money-changer has an understanding () of the coins that is even deeper than the surface understanding the villager has because the money-changer can identify which coins are real or fake, which village created them, etc.

 in the context of Buddhist meditation is described as the ability to understand the three characteristics of all things, namely impermanence, suffering, and non-self. Buddhaghoṣa states that the function of is &quot;to abolish the darkness of delusion&quot; in order to understand the &quot;individual essence of states&quot;.

===Mahāyāna Buddhism===
In Mahayana Buddhism and in the northern Abhidharma schools, prajñā (Tibetan: &quot;shes rab&quot;; Chinese: 般若/慧, &quot;bōrě&quot;/&quot;huì&quot;; Japanese: &quot;hannya&quot;) or understanding, is one of the five mental factors (caitta) present in all wholesome (kuśala) mental states. Prajñā involves the precise and analytical discernment of dharmas (phenomena) as expounded in Buddhist teachings. This wisdom allows practitioners to distinguish between virtues and flaws, thereby dispelling doubt and fostering clarity.

Prajñā is also one of the five spiritual faculties (pañcendriya) and powers (pañcabala). It works alongside faith (śraddhā) to overcome skepticism (vicikitsā) and cultivates balanced spiritual development. As one of the three primary trainings (triśikṣā), along with morality (śīla) and concentration (samādhi), prajñā transcends mere mental stability achieved through meditation. It entails a deep comprehension of reality, often compared to a sword that cuts through ignorance. 

According to Mahayana sources like the &quot;Yogācārabhūmi-śāstra,&quot; to cultivate prajñā one must also cultivate ethics (sīla), since a mind free of guilt is one which is psychologically fertile for the arising of wisdom. 

Three distinct forms of prajñā (Sanskrit: trividhā prajñā; Chinese: 三慧) are recognized in the Indian &quot;Yogācārabhūmi-Śāstra&quot;, reflecting different ways a Buddhist can attain an understanding of reality or three capabilities of knowledge. These three are: 

# Śrutamayī-prajñā (Wisdom from Hearing / Learning; Ch: 聞慧): This foundational form of wisdom arises through listening to teachings, reading texts, or studying the Dharma. It lays the groundwork for mindfulness and concentration, which are vital for achieving meditative calm (śamatha).
# Cintāmayī-prajñā (Wisdom from Reflection; Ch: 思慧): Building on learning, this type of wisdom emerges from thoughtful contemplation and analysis of teachings. Practitioners deepen their intellectual grasp of the Dharma, applying insights to understand the nature of existence. While it involves focused attention, it does not yet reach the full tranquility of advanced meditation.
# Bhāvanāmayī-prajñā (Wisdom from Cultivation; Ch: 修慧): The culmination of wisdom, this form is generated through meditative practice and experiential realization. It represents the integration of śamatha (calm abiding) and vipaśyanā (insight), allowing practitioners to perceive reality directly and profoundly.
These three forms of wisdom are always discussed in this order, indicating that they are a progressive and developmental process, from a more foundational kind of wisdom to a more complete form of wisdom (though this does not indicate one abandons the earlier wisdoms on attaining the latter forms). The three types of wisdom are said to be “generated through practice” (prayogajā). One list of practices which is closely linked to the three types of wisdom are found in various sources, including the &quot;Mahāyānasūtrālaṅkāra&quot;, and consist of ten practices “associated with the Dharma”: &quot;copying (lekhanā), worshipping (pūjanā), gifting (dānam), hearing (śravaṇam), speaking (vācanam), memorizing (udgrahaṇam), clarifying (prakāśanā), reciting (svādhyāyanam), reflecting (cintanā), and cultivating (bhāvanā).&quot; 

While the term prajñā can refer to all kinds of understanding and discernment of Buddhist truths (such as understanding the four noble truths, the various dharmas taught in Abhidharma, the various Buddhist theories of rebirth and enlightenment etc.), the highest kind of prajñā in Mahayana is Prajñāpāramitā, the &quot;Perfection of Wisdom&quot;. This is a direct non-conceptual knowledge of the ultimate truth (Dharmadhatu, Thusness, Emptiness, etc), which is both an essential quality for bodhisattvas striving for enlightenment and a genre of texts detailing this profound wisdom. These teachings emphasize the realization of ultimate truth as a means to attain Buddhahood.

According to Paul Williams, Mahayana considers the analysis of found in the Hinayana and Abhidharma texts to be incomplete in comparison to Mahayana teachings on wisdom. For Mahayana, the abhidharma descriptions of stops at the discernment of as the final reality, but Mahayana and some non-Mahayana schools go on to teach that all s (all phenomena) are empty (). Williams goes on to say that the meaning of according to Mahayana Prajñāpāramitā sutras is ultimately the state of understanding emptiness (). This view of prajñā is found in texts like the &quot;Heart Sutra&quot; which states that those who want &quot;to practice the profound perfection of wisdom () should view things in this way [as empty]&quot;. Dale S. Wright explains that while the conceptual view itself is not the perfection of wisdom, it can aid in its attainment.

<text>The Stranger is the fifth studio album by American singer-songwriter Billy Joel, released on September 29, 1977, by Columbia Records. It was the first of Joel&#x27;s albums to be produced by Phil Ramone, with whom he would work for five subsequent albums.

Joel&#x27;s previous album, &quot;Turnstiles&quot; (1976), had sold modestly and peaked low on the US charts, prompting Columbia to consider dropping him if his next release sold poorly. Joel wanted the new album to feature his touring band, formed during the production of &quot;Turnstiles&quot;. The band consisted of drummer Liberty DeVitto, bassist Doug Stegmeyer, and multi-instrumentalist Richie Cannata, who played the saxophone and organ. Seeking out a new producer, he first turned to veteran Beatles producer George Martin before coming across and settling on Ramone, whose name he had seen on albums by other artists such as Paul Simon. Recording took place over three weeks, featuring DeVitto, Stegmeyer, and Cannata. Other studio musicians filled in as guitarists on various songs.

Spending six weeks at on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, &quot;The Stranger&quot; was Joel&#x27;s critical and commercial breakthrough. Four singles were released in the US, all of which became Top 40 hits on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart: &quot;Just the Way You Are&quot; (), &quot;Movin&#x27; Out (Anthony&#x27;s Song)&quot;, &quot;She&#x27;s Always a Woman&quot; (both ), and &quot;Only the Good Die Young&quot; (). Other songs, such as &quot;Scenes from an Italian Restaurant&quot; and &quot;Vienna&quot;, have become staples of his career and are frequently performed in his live shows. The album won two awards at the 21st Annual Grammy Awards: Record of the Year and Song of the Year for &quot;Just the Way You Are&quot;. It remains his best-selling non-compilation album to date and surpassed Simon &amp; Garfunkel&#x27;s &quot;Bridge over Troubled Water&quot; (1970) to become Columbia&#x27;s best-selling album release, with more than 10 million units sold worldwide. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked the album number 70 in its 2003 list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;, repositioned to number 169 in a 2020 revision.
In 2008, &quot;The Stranger&quot; was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

==Background==
Before &quot;The Stranger&quot;, Billy Joel was on the verge of being dropped by his record label Columbia Records. After the unexpected success of Joel&#x27;s second album, &quot;Piano Man&quot; (1973), his subsequent albums were commercially disappointing. &quot;Turnstiles&quot;, Joel&#x27;s 1976 release, had peaked at only number 122 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart.

By 1976, Joel had formed a reliable touring band, consisting of Doug Stegmeyer on bass, Liberty DeVitto on drums and Richie Cannata on saxophone, flute, clarinet and organ. Joel grew to appreciate this group of musicians, finding that they had a high-energy, rough-around-the-edges feel that he hoped to capture in his studio recordings. Joel had mostly worked with session players for his first three studio albums, which contained only scattered contributions from his own backup musicians, and strongly disliked the polished sound of these albums. During the production of &quot;Turnstiles&quot;, his fourth album, Joel initially worked with veteran producer Jim Guercio, who had him work with members of Elton John&#x27;s band; dissatisfied with the results, Joel instead opted to self-produce the album and record with his own touring band. Joel was likewise set on recording his fifth studio album with this band. Having written some new material for the record, Joel sought a producer who could cultivate his desired style. Joel, a longtime fan of the Beatles, initially looked to famed Beatles producer George Martin. But after meeting with Joel, Martin expressed interest in producing the album, but did not want to use Joel&#x27;s band, wishing instead to bring in session players. Joel, however, was adamant in his desire to record with his own band and declined Martin&#x27;s offer. Ultimately, Joel turned to Phil Ramone, a veteran New York City sound engineer and record producer who had recently worked with Paul Simon, another singer-songwriter, on Simon&#x27;s album &quot;Still Crazy After All These Years&quot; (1975). According to Joel, he and Ramone met with each other at Fontana di Trevi, an Italian restaurant near Carnegie Hall, where Joel had been playing at the time. The restaurant would go on to inspire the setting of &quot;Scenes from an Italian Restaurant&quot;, a song on &quot;The Stranger&quot;. According to Joel, Ramone expressed an appreciation for Joel&#x27;s band and their energy, and understood the reasoning behind Joel&#x27;s attitude towards recording, which ultimately led Joel to choose Ramone as the producer for his next album.

==Production and recording==
The recording sessions for &quot;The Stranger&quot;, described by Joel as &quot;a blast&quot; to be a part of, took place across the span of three weeks in between July and August 1977. The album contains nine songs, four of which were released as singles in North America. The songs were all recorded with Joel alongside his band, which he had formed while touring, in addition to various other musicians who were brought into the studio for specific songs. Despite the formation of Joel&#x27;s band, the songs on &quot;The Stranger&quot; didn&#x27;t feature any consistent guitarists, with different players instead featuring in each song, and according to Joel, the reason for the initial lack of a constant guitarist was because it was hard to find the right one. The photograph on the back cover of the album, featuring Joel, Ramone (donning a Yankees shirt at the time of the picture) and each of the band members, was taken at the Supreme Macaroni Company, one of several restaurants where the group would go to &quot;have these crazy lunches and dinners&quot;.

The opening song, &quot;Movin&#x27; Out (Anthony&#x27;s Song)&quot;, centers around Anthony, a grocery-store employee from Long Island who &quot;dreams of making it big&quot;, receiving pressure from his family to move out and go his own way. Joel stated in a Q&amp;A session that he initially wrote the song&#x27;s lyrics to the tune of the song &quot;Laughter in the Rain&quot; by Neil Sedaka, doing so without even realizing the similarity until it was brashly pointed out the next day by drummer Liberty DeVitto. Not wanting to waste all of the words he had come up with, Joel rewrote the song, coming up with a new melody that fit with the lyrics. The album&#x27;s title track, according to Joel, was written by him without any core themes in mind and could be open up to interpretation, though he stated that it could be seen as a song about a man with schizophrenia. While composing the song, Joel whistled the track&#x27;s signature theme for Ramone, claiming that he (Joel) needed to find an instrument to play it. Ramone told Joel that the whistling he did was perfect, and thus it was kept in the final recording. According to Joel in an interview with &quot;Today&quot;, the percussive rhythm used in the song came about while he was toying around with an Ace Tone Rhythm Ace drum machine, which contained a drum beat that he heard while scrolling through the machine&#x27;s library of rhythm tracks. After hearing the beat, he thought that the rhythm would be nice to fool around with, and wrote the song shortly afterwards. &quot;Just the Way You Are&quot; was inspired by Joel&#x27;s love for his wife at the time, Elizabeth Weber. He stated on a SiriusXM broadcast in 2016 that the melody came to him in a dream while he was working on &quot;The Stranger&quot;. He forgot about the melody shortly afterwards, but it came back to him while he was in a business meeting. Joel originally considered keeping the song off the album, as he dismissed it as a &quot;gloppy ballad&quot; that was out-of-place compared to the rest of the album. Ramone disagreed, and brought Linda Ronstadt and Phoebe Snow into the studio to prove that it was worth including. Upon hearing the song, the two artists both praised it, thus convincing him to feature the song. The 7 minute epic &quot;Scenes from an Italian Restaurant&quot;, which follows a pair of young lovers from Long Island named Brenda and Eddie who go through a failed marriage, is three different, shorter songs: &quot;The Italian Restaurant Song&quot;, &quot;Things Are OK in Oyster Bay&quot; and &quot;The Ballad of Brenda and Eddie&quot;. Joel stitched the three songs together, inspired by the similar approach taken with side two of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Abbey Road&quot; and by Freddie Mercury and Queen with &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;, while Ramone helped intertwine them with backing orchestration.

The song &quot;Vienna&quot;, which opens up the album&#x27;s B-side, was inspired by a trip Joel took to Vienna, Austria, to visit his father a few years after starting his music career. While there, he found that Austrians had a vastly different outlook on life than the one he was familiar with in America. As he recalls, Joel had this realization after taking notice of an old woman sweeping out on the city streets, telling his father that he pitied the woman for having to do such a menial and unimportant task; Joel&#x27;s father responded by explaining that the woman was giving herself a sense of worth by doing a service that helped everyone rather than &quot;sitting at home wasting away&quot;. Joel tried to make the song feel Viennese in nature and compared it to the work of Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill, specifically The Threepenny Opera. &quot;Only the Good Die Young&quot;, which is sung from the point-of-view of a boy trying to appeal to an abstinent Catholic woman, was inspired by a girl named Virginia Davis, on whom Joel had a crush in high school. According to Joel, he saw Davis looking at him while he was playing in his high school band, The Echoes, which was the event that had him &quot;completely hooked&quot; to the prospect of being a musician. &quot;Only the Good Die Young&quot; was written by Joel while opening for the Beach Boys in Knoxville, Tennessee, at which point it sounded slower-pace and more akin to a reggae tune, with Joel even singing the song&#x27;s lyrics in a Jamaican accent. The mood of the song was shifted at the insistence of drummer Liberty DeVitto, who reportedly said to Joel &quot;Why are you singing like that? The closest you&#x27;ve been to Jamaica was the Long Island Rail Road!&quot; Ramone suggested that the song be played as a straight-four piece while DeVitto played a shuffle beat, a proposition that Joel found he enjoyed the sound of despite the concept initially seeming &quot;odd and clunky&quot;. The song featured guitar playing by Hugh McCracken, a famous session player who Ramone brought in. &quot;She&#x27;s Always a Woman&quot;, like &quot;Just the Way You Are&quot;, was written about Elizabeth Weber, described by Joel as &quot;a commentary on women in business being persecuted and insulted&quot;. Joel tried to stylize the song as one that would be sung by Gordon Lightfoot. &quot;Get It Right the First Time&quot; is inspired by the challenge of first meeting and confronting a person, highlighting the importance of not flubbing such an encounter and &quot;gett[ing] it right the first time&quot;. The album&#x27;s final song, &quot;Everybody Has a Dream&quot;, a gospel-influenced piece, was also inspired by Joel&#x27;s wife. The song closes the album out with a reprise of the whistled theme from &quot;The Stranger&quot;.

==Commercial performance==
Spending a total of 17 weeks in varying positions within the top 10 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, &quot;The Stranger&quot; first entered the bottom position on January 21, 1978, approximately four months after its initial release. A month later, on February 18, the album reached its peak position at number 2 on the chart and remained there for six more weeks. The second single from the album, &quot;Just The Way You Are&quot;, peaked at number 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, having received a boost in popularity following Joel&#x27;s performance of the song on an episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. The other three singles were all top 40 hits, with &quot;Movin&#x27; Out (Anthony&#x27;s Song)&quot; and &quot;She&#x27;s Always a Woman&quot; both peaking at number 17. While &quot;Movin&#x27; Out (Anthony&#x27;s Song)&quot; was the first single released for the album, radio stations put little attention toward it, instead expressing interest in &quot;Just the Way You Are&quot;; thus, the latter song was released just six weeks following the debut of &quot;Movin&#x27; Out&quot;, after which it achieved far larger success. The single for &quot;Movin&#x27; Out&quot; was later rereleased, after which it achieved higher success and ultimately became a hit. According to Joel, &quot;Only the Good Die Young&quot; sold poorly when it was first put out as a single; however, following the song&#x27;s release, Christian groups and archdiocese areas began calling for the song to be banned on several radio stations across the nation. The controversy helped raise the song&#x27;s popularity, particularly among rebellious youth according to Joel, and the single thus fared much better as a result, ultimately peaking at number 24 in the US singles chart. &quot;The Stranger&quot; remains one of Joel&#x27;s best-selling original studio albums to date, receiving a Diamond certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for surpassing sales of 10 million units. At the time, it had surpassed Simon &amp; Garfunkel&#x27;s &quot;Bridge over Troubled Water&quot; to become Columbia Records’ best-selling album release. In Canada the album spent 72 weeks in the Top 100 Album charts between November 1977 and April 1979.

==Reception==
&quot;The Stranger&quot; was well received by critics, particularly in retrospect, with many considering it to contain some of Joel&#x27;s best-written material. In a contemporary review of the album, Ira Mayer of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; deemed it an improvement over Joel&#x27;s previous studio efforts, praising its musical variety and Ramone&#x27;s production. In a less enthusiastic review, &quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau graded the album &quot;B−&quot; and held it slightly above Joel&#x27;s previous works; speaking specifically of Joel himself, he wrote that the artist had &quot;more or less grown up&quot; with what he considered less egotistical songwriting, and that he is &quot;now as likeable as your once-rebellious and still-tolerant uncle who has the quirk of believing that OPEC was designed to ruin his air-conditioning business&quot;.

Retrospectively, Sal Cinquemani of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; described &quot;The Stranger&quot; as &quot;a concept album of sorts, an ode to the singer&#x27;s native New York underscored by his paranoid obsession (and resistance) to change&quot;. He called the album &quot;a rejection of the American Dream&quot;, highlighting the pessimism expressed in some of its songs&#x27; lyrics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic praised &quot;The Stranger&quot; as a highlight of Joel&#x27;s discography, noting that its lyrical shortcomings are outweighed by Joel&#x27;s musical flair, and ultimately concluding that Joel &quot;rarely wrote a set of songs better than those on &quot;The Stranger&quot;, nor did he often deliver an album as consistently listenable&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;The Stranger&quot; at number 67 on its 2003 list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. It also placed on the 2012 and 2020 editions of the list at numbers 70 and 169, respectively. In 2000, &quot;The Stranger&quot; was voted number 246 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;.

As his breakthrough album, &quot;The Stranger&quot; kicked off a long string of successful albums for Joel, continuing up through 1993&#x27;s &quot;River of Dreams&quot;. George Martin, who had initially declined to produce &quot;The Stranger&quot; using Joel&#x27;s band, reportedly wrote Joel a letter following the album&#x27;s massive success, in which he congratulated Joel and reflected that he was wrong about the band. Phil Ramone would continue to serve as Joel&#x27;s producer for a number of years, working with him on each of his albums up through 1986&#x27;s &quot;The Bridge&quot;. &quot;Movin&#x27; Out (Anthony&#x27;s Song)&quot; went on to lend its name to a 2002 jukebox musical, featuring several of Joel&#x27;s songs alongside narrative choreography by Twyla Tharp. The play ran successfully on Broadway for three years, holding its final performance on December 15, 2005, after a total of 1,303 performances. In 2017, to celebrate the album&#x27;s 40th anniversary, a picture-disc vinyl rerelease of &quot;The Stranger&quot; with newly remastered audio was released by Brookville Records on October 20.

Many of the songs from the album went on to become staples in Joel&#x27;s repertoire. Though never released as a single, &quot;Scenes from an Italian Restaurant&quot; is a staple of his live set, named by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Rob Sheffield as Joel&#x27;s equivalent to Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;Jungleland&quot;. Joel stated in an interview that &quot;I don&#x27;t think I could do a show without performing that song.&quot; &quot;Vienna&quot; has also become a popular part of his live set; when Joel lets the audience choose between it and &quot;Just the Way You Are&quot;, &quot;Vienna&quot; is most often the winning contender. The song was featured in an episode of the TV series &quot;Taxi&quot;, and was prominently showcased later on in the 2004 teenage comedy film &quot;13 Going on 30&quot;. Joel has cited &quot;Scenes from an Italian Restaurant&quot; and &quot;Vienna&quot; as his favorite and 5th-favorite songs that he has written, respectively.

<text>Jacksonville Executive at Craig Airport , formerly known as Craig Municipal Airport, is a public airport located eight miles (13 km) east of the central business district of Jacksonville, in Duval County, Florida, United States. It is owned by the Jacksonville Aviation Authority.

This mid-sized general aviation airport handles personal aircraft and small commuter planes. The entrance is located along St. Johns Bluff Road north of Atlantic Blvd, although it also borders Atlantic Boulevard to the south. The airport has a control tower and handles 400-500 aircraft operations daily. It previously served as a joint civil-military airport hosting an Army Aviation Support Facility and helicopter units of the Florida Army National Guard prior to their relocation to nearby Cecil Field following the latter facility&#x27;s inactivation as a naval air station in 1999.

The United States Navy&#x27;s &quot;Blue Angels&quot; performed their first airshow at Jacksonville Executive at Craig Airport on June 15, 1946.

== Facilities and aircraft ==
Jacksonville Executive at Craig Airport covers an area of which contains two asphalt paved runways: 5/23 measuring 4,004 x 120 ft and 14/32 measuring 4,008 x 120 ft.

Runway 5/23 was repaved during the summer of 2011. In addition to filling cracks and adding a 120- x 150-foot blast pad, the entire runway was surfed with a 0.5-inch leveling course and a 1.5 inch Superpave surface course. In January 2012, the paving project was awarded the inaugural Ray Brown Airport Pavement Award by the National Asphalt Pavement Association, recognizing it as the highest quality airport asphalt pavement project completed during 2011.

For the 12-month period ending February 7, 2018, the airport had 158,769 aircraft operations, an average of 435 per day: 85% general aviation, 9% military and 5% air taxi. There were at the time 203 aircraft based at this airport: 127 single-engine, 45 multi-engine, 8 helicopter, 18 military and 5 jet.

The airport has 2 FBOs on the field, JAX Executive Jet Center and Sky Harbor Aviation.

The JAA board unanimously voted to approve a ground lease agreement with Amazon Services LLC in July 2023 to build a 181,000-square-foot warehouse on 79 acres.

Jacksonville Executive Craig Airport&#x27;s current CEO, Mark VanLoh, said Amazon is its highest paying tenant at Craig Airport, which is in East Arlington at northeast Atlantic Boulevard and St. Johns Bluff Road.

In October 2020, the JAA conducted a public solicitation through a request for interest to identify parties to lease and develop the available nonaeronautical property.

Seefried Development Properties Inc, on behalf of Amazon Services LLC, is developing the more than $40 million warehouse and distribution facility.

Residents and landowners in the area objected to potential traffic congestion and construction of a roadway that required traffic intersection improvements.

Those issues are resolved or still in review.

Many residents in the area feel the addition of the Amazon warehouse is going to drastically change the overall atmosphere of the community. Many believe the decision to lease and develop to one of the largest corporations in the world does not align with the original values of the airport and some say they are choosing profit over people.

Development of an Amazon.com last-mile distribution center at Jacksonville Executive at Craig Airport is “moving along quite rapidly,” Jacksonville Aviation Authority CEO Mark VanLoh told the JAA board March 25.

<text>Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is neuropathic pain that occurs due to damage to a peripheral nerve caused by the reactivation of the varicella zoster virus (herpes zoster, also known as shingles). PHN is defined as pain in a dermatomal distribution that lasts for at least 90 days after an outbreak of herpes zoster. Several types of pain may occur with PHN including continuous burning pain, episodes of severe shooting or electric-like pain, and a heightened sensitivity to gentle touch which would not otherwise cause pain or to painful stimuli. Abnormal sensations and itching may also occur.

Postherpetic neuralgia is the most common long-term complication of herpes zoster, and occurs in approximately 20% of patients with shingles. Risk factors for PHN include older age, severe prodrome or rash, severe acute zoster pain, ophthalmic involvement, immunosuppression, and chronic conditions such as diabetes mellitus and lupus. The pain from postherpetic neuralgia can be very severe and debilitating. There is no treatment which modifies the course of the disease and management primarily aims to control symptoms. Affected individuals often experience a decrease in their quality of life.

Shingles vaccination is the only way for adults to be protected against both shingles and postherpetic neuralgia, with the vaccine &quot;Shingrix&quot; providing 90% protection from postherpetic neuralgia. The chickenpox vaccine is approved for infants to prevent chickenpox, which also protects against PHN from a herpes zoster infection.

==Overview==

Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is neuropathic pain that occurs due to damage to a peripheral nerve caused by the reactivation of the varicella zoster virus (herpes zoster, also known as shingles). Typically, the nerve pain (neuralgia) is confined to an area of skin innervated by a single sensory nerve, which is known as a dermatome. PHN is defined as dermatomal nerve pain that persists for more than 90 days after an outbreak of herpes zoster affecting the same dermatome. Several types of pain may occur with PHN including continuous burning pain, episodes of severe shooting or electric-like pain, and a heightened sensitivity to gentle touch which would not otherwise cause pain (mechanical allodynia) or to painful stimuli (hyperalgesia). Abnormal sensations and itching may also occur.
The nerve pain of PHN is thought to result from damage in a peripheral nerve that was affected by the reactivation of the varicella zoster virus. PHN typically begins when the herpes zoster vesicles have crusted over and begun to heal, but can begin in the absence of herpes zoster—a condition called &quot;zoster sine herpete&quot;.
There is no treatment that modifies the disease course of PHN; therefore, controlling the affected person&#x27;s symptoms is the main goal of treatment. Medications applied to the skin such as capsaicin or topical anesthetics (e.g., lidocaine) are used for mild pain and can be used in combination with oral medications for moderate to severe pain. Oral anticonvulsant medications such as gabapentin and pregabalin are also approved for treatment of PHN. Tricyclic antidepressants reduce PHN pain, but their use is limited by side effects. Opioid medications are not generally recommended for treatment except in specific circumstances. Such cases should involve a pain specialist in patient care due to mixed evidence of efficacy and concerns about potential for abuse and addiction.

Shingles vaccination is the only way for adults to be protected against both shingles and postherpetic neuralgia, with the vaccine &quot;Shingrix&quot; providing 90% protection from postherpetic neuralgia. The chickenpox vaccine is approved for infants to prevent chickenpox, which also protects against PHN from a herpes zoster infection.
PHN is the most common long-term complication of herpes zoster. The incidence and prevalence of PHN are uncertain due to varying definitions. Approximately 20% of people affected by herpes zoster report pain in the affected area three months after the initial episode of herpes zoster, and 15% of people similarly report this pain two years after the herpes zoster rash. Since herpes zoster occurs due to reactivation of the varicella zoster virus, which is more likely to occur with a weakened immune system, both herpes zoster and PHN occur more often in the elderly. Risk factors for PHN include older age, severe prodrome or rash, severe acute zoster pain, ophthalmic involvement, immunosuppression, and chronic conditions such as diabetes mellitus and lupus. PHN is often very painful and can be quite debilitating. Affected individuals often experience a decrease in their quality of life.

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms:
* With resolution of the herpes zoster eruption, pain that continues for three months or more is defined as postherpetic neuralgia.
* Pain is variable, from discomfort to very severe, and may be described as burning, stabbing, or gnawing.

Signs:
* Area of previous herpes zoster may show evidence of cutaneous scarring.
* Sensation may be altered over the areas involved, in the form of either hypersensitivity or decreased sensation.
* In rare cases, the patient might also experience muscle weakness, tremor, or paralysis if the nerves involved also control muscle movement.

==Pathophysiology==
Postherpetic neuralgia is thought to be due to nerve damage caused by herpes zoster. The damage causes nerves in the affected dermatomic area of the skin to send abnormal electrical signals to the brain. These signals may convey excruciating pain, and may persist or recur for months, years, or for life.

A key factor in the neural plasticity underlying neuropathic pain is altered gene expression in sensory dorsal root ganglia neurons. Injury to sensory nerves induces neurochemical, physiological, and anatomical modifications to afferent and central neurons, such as afferent terminal sprouting and inhibitory interneuron loss. Following nerve damage, NaCl channel accumulation causes hyperexcitability, and downregulation of the TTX-resistant Nav1.8 (sensory neuron specific, SNS1) channel and upregulation of TTX-sensitive Nav1.3 (brain type III) and TRPV1 channels. These changes contribute to increased NMDA glutamate receptor-dependent excitability of spinal dorsal horn neurons and are restricted to the ipsilateral (injured) side. A combination of these factors could contribute to the neuropathic pain state of postherpetic neuralgia.

==Diagnosis==
Lab Studies:
* No laboratory work is usually necessary.
* Results of cerebrospinal fluid evaluation are abnormal in 61%.
** Pleocytosis is observed in 46%, elevated protein in 26%, and VZV DNA in 22%.
* These findings are not predictive of the clinical course of postherpetic neuralgia.
* Viral culture or immunofluorescence staining may be used to differentiate herpes simplex from herpes zoster in cases that are difficult to distinguish clinically.
* Antibodies to herpes zoster can be measured. A 4-fold increase has been used to support the diagnosis of subclinical herpes zoster (zoster sine herpete). However, a rising titer secondary to viral exposure rather than reactivation cannot be ruled out.

Imaging studies:
* Magnetic resonance imaging lesions attributable to herpes zoster were seen in the brain stem and cervical cord in 56% (9/16) of patients.
* At three months after onset of herpes zoster, 56% (5/9) of patients with an abnormal magnetic resonance image had developed postherpetic neuralgia.
* Of the seven patients who had no herpes-zoster-related lesions on the magnetic resonance image, none had residual pain.
==Prevention==
===Primary prevention===
Shingles vaccination is the only way for adults to be protected against both shingles and postherpetic neuralgia, with two vaccines approved for use in people over age 50. The zoster vaccine &quot;Shingrix&quot; provides around 90% protection from postherpetic neuralgia, and has been used in many countries since 2017. The earlier vaccine &quot;Zostavax&quot; provides lesser protection against shingles, and PHN.

The varicella vaccine is approved for infants to prevent chickenpox, which also protects against PHN from a herpes zoster infection. Vaccination decreases the overall incidence of virus reactivation, and also decreases the severity of disease development and incidence of PHN if reactivation does occur.

===Secondary prevention===
A 2013 Cochrane meta-analysis of 6 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating oral antiviral medications given within 72 hours after the onset of herpes zoster rash in immunocompetent people for preventing postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) found no significant difference between placebo and aciclovir.
Additionally, there was no significant difference in preventing the incidence of PHN found in the one RCT included in the meta-analysis that compared placebo to oral famciclovir treatment within 72 hours of HZ rash onset. Studies using valaciclovir treatment were not included in the meta-analysis.
PHN was defined as pain at the site of the dermatomic rash at 120 days after the onset of rash, and incidence was evaluated at 1, 4, and 6 months after rash onset. Patients who are prescribed oral antiviral agents after the onset of rash should be informed that their chances of developing PHN are no different than those not taking oral antiviral agents.

==Treatment==
The pain from postherpetic neuralgia can be very severe and requires immediate treatment. There is no treatment which modifies the course of the disease and management primarily aims to control symptoms.

===Medications===
====Topical medications====
Medications applied to the skin can be used alone if the pain from PHN is mild or in combination with oral medications if the pain is moderate to severe. Topical medications for PHN include low-dose (0.075%) and high-dose (8%) capsaicin and anesthetics such as lidocaine patches. Lidocaine patches (5% concentration) are approved in the United States and Europe to treat PHN though evidence supporting their use is limited. A meta-analysis of multiple small placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials found that for every two people treated with topical lidocaine, one person experienced at least a 50% reduction in their PHN-associated pain (number needed to treat (NNT)=2).

Low-dose capsaicin may be useful for reducing PHN-associated pain but is limited by side effects (redness and a burning or stinging sensation with application) and the need to apply it four times daily. Approximately three people must be treated with low-dose capsaicin cream for one person to experience significant pain relief (number needed to treat =3.3). A single topical application of a high-dose capsaicin patch over the affected area after numbing the area with a topical anesthetic has also been found to relieve PHN-associated pain. For every eleven people treated with a high-dose capsaicin patch for up to 12 weeks, one person experienced a significant improvement in their pain. (number needed to treat=11). Due to the need for topical anesthesia before application of the high-dose capsaicin patch, referral to a pain specialist is generally recommended if this approach is being considered.

====Oral medications====
Multiple oral medications have demonstrated efficacy in relieving postherpetic neuralgia pain. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), such as nortriptyline or desipramine, are effective in reducing postherpetic neuralgia pain but are limited by their numerous side effects. For every three people treated with a tricyclic antidepressant, one person is expected to have a clinically significant reduction in their pain (NNT=3). Additionally, of every sixteen people treated with a TCA, one person is expected to stop the medication due to a bothersome side effect, such as dry mouth, constipation, or urinary retention (number needed to harm=16). The anticonvulsant medications pregabalin and gabapentin also effectively relieve postherpetic neuralgia pain. Treatment with pregabalin leads to a reduction in pain intensity of 50% or more in one person out of every 4–5 people treated (NNT=4–5). Similarly, treatment with gabapentin also leads to a 50% reduction in pain intensity in one person out of every 7-8 people treated (NNT=7.5).

Opioids such as tramadol, methadone, oxycodone, and morphine have not been well-studied for postherpetic neuralgia treatment. Acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are thought to be ineffective and have not undergone rigorous study for PHN.

====New medications====
Pharmacological treatment of PHN is unsatisfactory for many patients and there is a clinical need for new treatments. Between 2016 and 2023, 18 clinical trials have been carried out evaluating 15 molecules with pharmacological actions on nine different molecular targets: antagonism of the angiotensin type 2 receptor (AT2R) (olodanrigan), inhibition of the α2δ subunit of the voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC)(crisugabalin, mirogabalin and pregabalin), activated sodium channel (VGSC) blockade (funapide and lidocaine), cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) inhibition (TRK-700), adapter-associated kinase 1 inhibition ( AAK1) (LX9211), lanthionine synthase C-like protein (LANCL) activation (LAT8881), N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonism (esketamine), mu opioid receptor agonism (tramadol, oxycodone e hydromorphone) and nerve growth factor (NGF) inhibition (fulranumab). Of them, some of them report promising results while others did not work.

==Prognosis==
The natural history of postherpetic neuralgia involves slow resolution of the pain syndrome. A subgroup of affected individuals may develop severe, long-lasting pain that does not respond to medical therapy.
==Epidemiology==
In the United States each year approximately 1,000,000 individuals develop herpes zoster, with nearly 1 in 3 people in the United States developing it in their lifetime. Of those individuals, approximately 10–18% develop postherpetic neuralgia.

The incidence of herpes zoster, and also developing postherpetic neuralgia, both increase with age. The frequency and severity of postherpetic neuralgia increase with advancing age, occurring in 20% of people age 60–65 years old who have had herpes zoster, and in more than 30% of people over 80 years old.

<doc id="1033234" wikidata="Q242829" url="?curid=1033234" title="52nd Street (album)">
<text>52nd Street is the sixth studio album by American singer-songwriter Billy Joel, released on October 11, 1978, by Columbia Records. Presenting itself as the follow-up to his breakthrough studio album, &quot;The Stranger,&quot; Joel tried to give the new album a fresh sound, hiring various jazz musicians to differentiate it from his previous studio albums.

The album&#x27;s title is a reference to 52nd Street, a popular street location in Midtown Manhattan for jazz musicians, beginning during the Great Depression and continuing through to the 1950s. Joel&#x27;s label was headquartered within the CBS Building on West 52nd Street at the time of the album&#x27;s release. The studio where recording took place was also on 52nd Street, one block away from where Joel&#x27;s label was headquartered.

&quot;52nd Street&quot; was an instant commercial success, becoming Joel&#x27;s first album to reach number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, a spot it held for eight consecutive weeks. Three songs reached the Top 40 in the United States, contributing to the album&#x27;s success: &quot;My Life&quot; (number 3), &quot;Big Shot&quot; (number 14), and &quot;Honesty&quot; (number 24). It was similarly well received by critics, earning two Grammy awards for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance and Album of the Year at the 22nd Annual Grammy Awards. The latter Grammy was presented to its producer, Phil Ramone. Upon Ramone&#x27;s death, &quot;52nd Street&quot;″s Album of the Year Grammy was passed on to Joel.

The album was among the first commercially released on the compact disc format, reaching store shelves on October 1, 1982, in Japan (it was one of 50 CDs released that day, including &quot;The Stranger&quot;, but bore the first catalogue number in the sequence, 35DP-1, and so is frequently cited as the first to be released). In keeping with this history, it was also the first release when Sony returned to manufacturing vinyl records in 2018.

==Reception==
Reviewing &quot;52nd Street&quot; for &quot;The Village Voice&quot; in 1979, Robert Christgau noted Joel&#x27;s talent for writing catchy songs and likened him to Elton John, albeit with more &quot;smarm.&quot; &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; determined that &quot;the music really is starting to sound repetitive and formulaic—as though the songwriter&#x27;s musical vocabulary is too limited to match his sense of the big city&#x27;s varied dramas.&quot;

Retrospectively, AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine praised Joel for expanding stylistically on 1977s &quot;The Stranger&quot;, describing &quot;52nd Street&quot; as &quot;more sophisticated and somewhat jazzy.&quot; In 2000, it was voted number 621 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;. In 2003, &quot;52nd Street&quot; was ranked number 352 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;, and at 354 on a 2012 revised list.

<text>The Abangan are Javanese people who are Muslims and practice a much more syncretic version of Islam than the more orthodox santri. The term, apparently derived from the Javanese language word for red, &quot;abang&quot;, was first developed by Clifford Geertz, but the meaning has since shifted. &quot;Abangan&quot; are more inclined to follow a local system of beliefs called adat and Kebatinan than pure Sharia (Islamic law). Their belief system integrates Hinduism, Buddhism and animism. However, some scholars hold that what has classically been viewed as Indonesian variance from Islam is often a part of that faith in other countries. For example, Martin van Bruinessen notes similarity between &quot;adat&quot; and historical practice among Muslims in Egypt as described by Edward Lane. 

==Indonesian mass killings of 1965–66==
Many Abangans were supporters of the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI), and their interests were thus supported by the PKI. They subsequently made up most of the people who were slaughtered in the anti-Communist Indonesian mass killings of 1965–66. Abangans were targeted for attacks by Ansor, the youth wing of Nahdlatul Ulama and the Santri with help from the Indonesian Army. To avoid being classified as atheist and communists, Abangan Muslims were forced by the Indonesian government to convert to Hinduism and Christianity in the aftermath of the slaughter.

<doc id="1033237" wikidata="Q1090273" url="?curid=1033237" title="Kamiya Kaoru">
<text>, known as Kaoru Kamiya in the Media Blasters English-language dub and Kori Kamiya in the English Sony &quot;Samurai X&quot; dub, is a fictional character in the &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; manga created by Nobuhiro Watsuki. In the story Kaoru is the instructor of a kendo school in Tokyo, . The students leave when many people are killed by someone claiming to be the from the &quot;Kamiya Kasshin-ryū&quot;&quot;, damaging the school&#x27;s reputation. Kaoru is saved from the murderous impostor by the real &quot;Battōsai&quot;, Himura Kenshin, now a wanderer who has sworn to stop killing. During the series, Kaoru grows fond of Kenshin due to his good actions to society and becomes his ally.

Kaoru also appears in the film version of the series and other media of the franchise, including electronic games and a series of original video animations (OVAs). Although Watsuki wanted to design Kaoru &quot;more cutely&quot; and to be &quot;more fashionable&quot;, he toned down those qualities and made her poor and &quot;down-to-earth&quot;. There was concern that Watsuki would kill her off, with her critical reception having been mostly positive.

==Appearances==
===&quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot;===

Kaoru is the instructor of the Kamiya Kasshin martial-arts school. She inherited her fighting style and a small dojo from her father, who was drafted by a police swordsmen unit and died defending a comrade during the Seinan War. At the beginning of the story, Kaoru has no students and runs the dojo alone; she seems likely to lose it when Kenshin helps her. Despite occasional mood swings and a reputation for bad cooking, she is independent, compassionate, courageous and a good fighter. In her first appearance, Kaoru searches for the assassin Hitokiri Battosai, who claims to be from Kamiya Kasshin-ryu. Kaoru is saved by the real Battosai, Himura Kenshin, and invites him to her dojo. One of her greatest fears is that Kenshin might return to wandering, leaving her alone again, and she is jealous if another girl (such as Takani Megumi) is interested in him. In the series&#x27; first story arc, Kaoru gains a student (Myojin Yahiko) and loses one (Tsukayama Yutaro).

When the Meiji government requests Kenshin&#x27;s aid to kill the former Hitokiri Shishio Makoto, he bids Kaoru an emotional farewell and leaves for Kyoto. Kaoru falls into a depression before she follows him to Kyoto after a pep talk from Megumi. With the Oniwabanshu&#x27;s Makimachi Misao, she defeats one of Shishio&#x27;s Juppongatana: Honjō Kamatari.

In Tokyo, after Kaoru learns about Yukishiro Enishi&#x27;s plans to kill everyone connected to Kenshin she teaches Yahiko the &quot;ougi&quot; of the Kamiya Kasshin. Enishi says that his goal is not to kill Kenshin, but to make him suffer by killing the person most important to him: Kaoru. He kidnaps her, leaving a replica of her dead body. Convinced that he again failed to save the one who was most important to him, Kenshin flees to the Fallen Village and falls into a catatonic depression. When he learns that Kaoru is alive, he and the group rescue her from Enishi. They marry and have a son, Himura Kenji. Five years later, after taking in Hasegawa Ashitaro, Inoue Aran, and Kubota Asahi into the Kamiya dojo, Kaoru receives information from them that her father is presumably alive and living in Hokkaido, prompting her and her family to travel there in the hopes of reuniting with him.

===Other media===
In &quot;Rurouni Kenshin: Reflection&quot;, although Kenshin and Kaoru are married he begins wandering again because he needs to help others; he returns every couple of years. Kaoru lets him go, promising to welcome him home with a smile and their child. Kenshin develops a mysterious disease, and Kaoru convinces him to transmit it to her. He leaves to help people in the First Sino-Japanese War, as he had promised the Meiji government. When he returns to Japan, Kenshin collapses in Kaoru&#x27;s arms and dies. In the pilot issue of &quot;Rurouni: Meiji Swordsman Romantic Story&quot;, first published in 1992, Kaoru is the sister of Megumi and Yahiko. Many of the character&#x27;s details changed in her transition to mainstream manga. Kaoru appears in all &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; video games (including &quot;Jump Super Stars&quot; and &quot;Jump Ultimate Stars&quot;), primarily as a supporting character. In the manga reboot &quot;Rurouni Kenshin: Restoration&quot;, Kaoru works for Takeda Kanryū to regain her dojo. After Kenshin defeats Takeda, she continues living in the dojo with Kenshin and his friends. Kaoru was played by Emi Takei in 2012&#x27;s &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; and its three sequels.

==Concept==
Watsuki said that he used &quot;no specific model&quot; and &quot;no specific motif&quot; in designing Kaoru, saying that if he had to name one model it would be Chiba Sanako, who was Sakamoto Ryōma&#x27;s fiancée.
He wanted to include the &quot;commanding&quot; qualities of from Shōtarō Ikenami&#x27;s &quot;Kenkaku Shōbai&quot; (剣客商売). According to Watsuki, Kaoru is a &quot;plain, regular girl&quot; despite her commanding qualities. By the first Japanese compilation, he thought that the character worked and many female &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; readers identified with Kaoru. At the time, Watsuki had not decided if Kaoru would be Kenshin&#x27;s love interest. Although he wanted to design Kaoru &quot;more cutely&quot; and to be &quot;more fashionable&quot;, he toned down those qualities and made her poor and &quot;down-to-earth&quot;. The artist described her ponytail as &quot;de rigueur&quot; for a girl practicing kendo. According to Watsuki, he enjoys drawing Kaoru but filling in her hair is &quot;sometimes a pain.&quot; At the end of &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot;, Kaoru received a new hairstyle. Watsuki felt that Kaoru would look odd without her ponytail, but her original hairstyle did not look maternal and he changed it for the ending. When female readers asked Watsuki if Kaoru was a strong fighter, he called the character &quot;quite independent for her age&quot; who could &quot;hold her own&quot; against the local dojo masters and compete at the national level (although she is weaker than Kenshin and Sagara Sanosuke).

Watsuki said that in volume seven the series took on a more adult tone, influenced by the shōjo manga he was reading at the time. During the series he considered killing Kaoru off, deciding against it in favor of a happy ending for a manga aimed at young readers and influenced by the previous story arc&#x27;s upbeat ending. However, he thought the storyline then lost its main theme (revenge); readers praised and criticized the twist. Watsuki apologized to his young audience for the dark chapters suggesting that Kaoru was dead. Miki Fujitani (who voices the character) said in an interview that in the OVA series Kaoru is brave and very different from her original version whose characterization has been felt closer to the calm Yukishiro Tomoe. Watsuki described Tomo Sakurai&#x27;s CD-drama voice as &quot;not too airhead-y,&quot; &quot;not too high&quot; and &quot;not too low.&quot;

==Reception==
Kaoru has been popular with &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; readers, placing fourth or fifth in every popularity poll. Kaoru merchandise includes plushes, keychains and sweatbands. Manga, anime and video-game publications have responded positively to Kaoru; in T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews, Carlos Ross called her a &quot;spirited girl&quot;. Kaoru and Kenshin&#x27;s relationship ranked eighth in About.com&#x27;s &quot;Top 8 Anime Love Stories&quot;, with Katherine Luther calling it a &quot;classic romance.&quot; Rebecca Silverman of Anime News Network was disappointed by Kaoru&#x27;s lack of development in the series &quot;Rurouni Kenshin Restoration&quot;. SciFi.com liked her character due to how Kaoru does not see Kenshin as the past murderer Battosai but instead as a kind wanderer who wants protect others. The writer also enjoyed the good actions Kaoru does like protecting Yahiko in early episodes. Megan Lavey from Mania Entertainment found Kaoru more appealing in the manga version over the anime adaptation due to that, while in both versions it is obvious that she has romantic feelings for Kenshin, in the manga she has a better understanding of Kenshin&#x27;s darker persona most notably when former assassin prepares to leave Tokyo. For the final arc in the manga, &quot;Mania Entertainment&quot; felt that twist that happens shortly after Kenshin&#x27;s battle with Enishi helps to show why Kaoru loves Kenshin carefully.

Kaoru&#x27;s &quot;Reflection&quot; OVA series version was criticized; Efrain Diaz, Jr. of IGN wrote that although some of Kenshin and Kaoru&#x27;s private moments are touching, others are depressing. According to Anime News Network&#x27;s Mike Crandol, Kaoru is the least visually successful character redesign in the &quot;Reflection&quot; OVA. Citing the manga version&#x27;s &quot;distinctive girlish charm&quot;, Crandol said that the staff members tried too hard to make her look like Yukishiro Tomoe. Don Houston from DVD Talk noted the controversy between the fandom as they refrained from treating &quot;Reflection&quot; as canon due to how tragic the life of Kaoru and Kenshin&#x27;s family became. About.com&#x27;s Serdar Yegulalp felt the romance between Kaoru and Kenshin was entertaining to watch but at the same time criticized they often acted out of character, commenting on how Kaoru lets her husband leave the house in contrast to how in the original series, Kenshin left Tokyo while still not married with her. Ridwan Khan from Animefringe praised the romance between Kaoru and Kenshin, feeling it was well developed in the OVAs and served as a fitting finale to the series. On a more negative review, Carl Kimlinger stated that Kaoru was one of the most damaged characters in the OVAs as a result of being a more stereotipycal female character waiting for her husband to come back home rather than Watsuki&#x27;s original version where Kaoru would not allow Kenshin to leave or instead go with him when he leaves Tokyo to work. According to Ashley D. Lake from UC Riverside, Kaoru represents the Daitō-ryū Aiki-jūjutsu values defied in the &quot;Meiji era&quot; that Kenshin chooses to protect due to the values it offers to people, something rare in anime series due to prominent violence during the time &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; premiered in Japan.

ABC CBN&#x27;s Karen Flores praised Emi Takei&#x27;s portrayal of the character in the first live-action film, stating the actress played her character just like the one from the manga and anime. However, she was criticized for lacking her tomboyish traits when interacting with the young Myojin Yahiko. The lack of the love triangle between Kaoru, Kenshin and Takani Megumi was criticized by Ko Ransom from Anime News Network, as the writer noted the first film covered too many subplots. David West from &quot;Neo&quot; lamented Kaoru had few appearances in the final film, citing her role in the previous ones appealing.

<doc id="1033243" wikidata="Q2564558" url="?curid=1033243" title="Myōjin Yahiko">
<text>, known as Yahiko Myojin in the Media Blasters English-language dub and Yoshi Mujin in the English Sony &quot;Samurai X&quot; dub, is a fictional character from the &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; manga and anime series authored by Nobuhiro Watsuki. The character of Yahiko is based on the author&#x27;s childhood experiences practicing kendo; since Watsuki&#x27;s experienced frustration during kendo classes, the author wrote Yahiko as experiencing frustration with his kendo skills. Watsuki liked Yahiko, and while writing the manga, he began to develop the character so that readers would enjoy him.

The fictional setting takes place during the pre-Meiji period of Japan. Yahiko is an orphan from a samurai family who was forced to work as a thief to repay the debt he had presumably owed, as his parents died before they could repay it. When he is rescued by the main character of the story Himura Kenshin, he decides that he will grow up to be just like Kenshin. But because of his strong beliefs, Kenshin will not teach the sword style he had learned. Therefore, Kenshin arranges for Yahiko to be trained by Kamiya Kaoru, the teacher of the . As the series progresses, Yahiko becomes skilled at swordsmanship and faces many opponents.

Yahiko appears in the featured movie of the series, as well as other media relating to the franchise, including a wide range of electronic games and an original video animations (OVAs) series. His character has been very popular with readers from &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot;, ranking near the top of the series&#x27; popularity polls. His character is featured in various types of merchandising developed for the series, such as figurines and key-chains. Several publications have commented on his character. While he was initially criticized for his lack of action in the plot, his further development in the series has been praised.

==Creation and conception==

Nobuhiro Watsuki, creator of &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot;, says that he used no particular logic when drawing Yahiko except for the &quot;defiant&quot; eyes and &quot;mussed&quot; hair. (Watsuki describes these traits as &quot;a must&quot; in a &quot;shōnen&quot; comic.) Watsuki enjoyed practicing kendo &quot;almost as much as drawing manga&quot;. To create Yahiko, Watsuki drew on his emotions from junior high school. He has described himself then as &quot;weak&quot; and &quot;an embarrassment to my 183 centimeters of height&quot; (183 centimeters is equivalent to 6 feet). He says he was a member of the kendo starting squad only because the school suspended another student originally intended to be a starter. However, he failed to win in a league tournament, experienced frustration and felt he was &quot;awful&quot; despite his desire to succeed; he yearned to improve his kendo skills. As an &quot;outlet&quot; for Watsuki&#x27;s kendo emotions, Yahiko &quot;knows a pain that hero-types like Himura Kenshin and Sagara Sanosuke can never know&quot;. As Watsuki further developed the story, Yahiko becomes a comedic character. Watsuki wanted to draw Yahiko in a way that readers could envision him as being a &quot;great&quot; swordsman five to ten years later, eventually giving him a stronger characterization during the Kyoto arc which surprised his readers.

During the last story arc from the manga, the story takes a darker tone than those from other &quot;shōnen&quot; series published by Shueisha. As the series was aimed at teenagers, Watsuki made Yahiko the main character during the time when Kenshin thought that Kamiya Kaoru was dead; his role was to serve as the identifying character for readers. However, the author found this hard to do, as the more time Kenshin was unwilling to continue to live, the worse Yahiko felt, leaving Watsuki a more negative feeling concerning the story. By the end of the series as Yahiko becomes a teenager, Watsuki had redesigned his appearance. He wanted Yahiko to impress manga readers so that he could be a protagonist for a possible series sequel. He said this goal influenced his design of Yahiko, with Kenshin&#x27;s physical appearance as well as Sanosuke&#x27;s personality. He added Sanosuke&#x27;s kanji of to the back of his clothes, and was pleased that various readers recognized it. Although he suggested he was not going to make a sequel, he said the main characters would be Yahiko, Sanjō Tsubame and Tsukayama Yutarō. Watsuki thought about writing a story in which Yahiko and Tsubame would have a son, Myōjin Shinya, who would become a skilled swordsman.

In the 20th volume from the &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; &quot;kanzenban&quot; edition, Watsuki again redesigned Yahiko&#x27;s appearance to show how he would appear at that time. His hair was not as spiky as it was originally, and he had new clothes. He wore a dark jacket, a white short-sleeved T-shirt and short trousers. He did not have socks under his sandals and he had bandages on his hands in order hold a swords. He had two swords—a shinai and a katana—with the latter tied on his back.

In the anime adaptation of &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot;, Watsuki&#x27;s designs were combined with the voice talents of Miina Tominaga, a voice actress. In producing the English dub version of the series, Media Blasters chose Wendee Lee to voice Yahiko, but she was credited as Elyse Floyd.

==Appearances==

===In &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot;===
Yahiko starts off as arrogant and bad-mannered; he had already bestowed upon himself the title &quot;Tokyo Samurai&quot;, as his father was a samurai who died during the Battle of Ueno in the Boshin War, slain at the Keneiji Temple. Because Yahiko respected his parents, he becomes a thief before the start of the series, to pay back their debt. Yahiko first appears trying to rob Kenshin, who stops him but lets him go. As his yakuza bosses are about to beat him to death for his desire to quit, Kenshin arrives to save him and take him to Kaoru&#x27;s dojo to learn swordsmanship. Yahiko&#x27;s dream is to be as strong as Kenshin so he will be able to protect himself and the people he loves. Despite his young age and his short time of training, as the series continues Kenshin allows Yahiko to fight with him, noting that he is too mature for his age. He becomes a witness to many of Kenshin&#x27;s later battles to the point which Yahiko becomes adept at imitating some of Kenshin&#x27;s techniques, combining them to perform many other powerful sword techniques. Yahiko also learns the principles of , which matches Kenshin&#x27;s ideal of saving lives. When Kenshin goes to Kyoto to fight Shishio Makoto who wanted to conquer Japan, Yahiko accompanies Kaoru to find and aid Kenshin. While Kenshin goes to have his final fight against Shishio, he stays in Kyoto to defend their base, a hotel named Aoi-ya, from Shishio&#x27;s forces along with Kaoru and the Oniwabanshū. They are successful in doing it, and Yahiko manages to defeat one of Shishio&#x27;s strongest soldiers, Henya.
Back in Tokyo after Shishio&#x27;s defeat, Yahiko notices Yukishiro Enishi&#x27;s revenge plot against Kenshin. Sensing his own inability to help, he trains much harder to learn the two succession techniques in &quot;Kamiya Kasshin-ryū&quot;. Such moves allow him to block an opponent&#x27;s attack and then hit him with his weapon. He successfully learns both of this techniques and becomes so adept at using them, that Yahiko starts performing several variations. He uses these moves against one of Enishi&#x27;s partners Otowa Hyōko and defeats him. While Yahiko rests from to his injuries, Kaoru is kidnapped by Enishi, and Yahiko and his friends start searching for her. When another of Enishi&#x27;s comrades, Kujiranami Hyōgo escapes from jail and goes on a rampage, Yahiko stands up against him. However, he is not strong enough on his own to defeat him and Kenshin saves him at the last moment. After he and Kenshin recover from their fight injuries, they go to rescue Kaoru from Enishi. While on his island fortress, Yahiko defeats one of the four bodyguards from Enishi&#x27;s partner, Heishin, and witnesses Kenshin&#x27;s fight against Enishi, which Kenshin wins. Five years later, he is the acting instructor at the Kamiya Kasshin-ryū dojo. One day Kenshin calls him to test his skills; when he lands a hit on Kenshin, he gives Yahiko his own reverse-blade sword as a present for his coming-of-age ceremony.

===In other media===
In &quot;Rurouni, Meiji Swordsman Romantic Story&quot;, he is known as and is the brother of Takani Megumi and Kaoru. Yahiko also appears in all of the &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; video games, including the crossover game &quot;Jump Ultimate Stars&quot;. After the manga serialization ended, Watsuki authored one-shot chapter from the series in which Yahiko goes to take care from the people of dojo, but ends confronting a former soldier from Shishio who takes as hostages the students from the dojo. In &quot;Requiem for the Ishin Patriots&quot;, Yahiko joins the samurai Takimi Shigure&#x27;s group in their attempt to overthrow the Meiji Government, but Shigure later knocks Yahiko out to make him stay out of danger. In &quot;Rurouni Kenshin: Reflection&quot;, set various years after the manga&#x27;s end, a now adult Yahiko lives with Sanjō Tsubame, a childhood friend he met who works at a restaurant where both worked together. He starts taking care of Kaoru when she suffers from an illness while Kenshin went to assist people injured in wars. Due to Kaoru&#x27;s suffering, Yahiko goes to Kyoto to request Kenshin and Kaoru&#x27;s son, Himura Kenji, to accompany his mother. In order to make him accept, both have a duel, and Yahiko wins.

In the reboot &quot;Rurouni Kenshin: Restoration&quot;, he works for Takeda Kanryu. As Kanryu plans to kill Kaoru who is fighting for her dojo, Yahiko requests Kenshin&#x27;s help to save her. After Kanryu&#x27;s defeat, Yahiko stays in Kaoru&#x27;s dojo alongside her and Kenshin.

Yahiko was featured in the live action film portrayed by Taketo Tanaka and in the sequels &quot;Kyoto Inferno&quot; and &quot;The Legend Ends&quot; portrayed by Kaito Ōyagi. In &quot;Saishūshō: The Final&quot; he was portrayed by Riku Ohnishi. He appears as the only student in Kaoru&#x27;s dojo, instead of starting as a thief from the streets in the original series. Also, in the film, he doesn&#x27;t join Kenshin and Sanosuke in rescuing Megumi from Kanryuu&#x27;s mansion as he does in the manga.

In the manga sequel &quot;Rurouni Kenshin: The Hokkaido Arc&quot;, Yahiko confronts Kenshin to make sure he has the same strength he is known for after being told by Kaoru that he became weaker. As Yahiko loses, he returns Kenshin his &quot;sakabato&quot; to help him in his new journey to find Kaoru&#x27;s father. Shortly after Kenshin&#x27;s family leaves, Yahiko remains in charge of the dojo and proposes to Tsubame when she realizes he feels lonely now.

==Reception==
The character from Yahiko has been well received by manga readers, having consistently placed highly in the &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; popularity polls of the series, usually in the top ten characters and once taking third place. A plethora of merchandise have been released in Yahiko&#x27;s image, including key-chains wall scrolls, and action figures in both his child and teenager appearances. In an interview with Miina Tominaga, the voice actress for the character, has said that she was a bit afraid when performing the voice of Yahiko in the OVAs since the character was now an adult, but she ended up happy with her performance. Watsuki described Minami Takayama, the CD voice actor, as having &quot;a lot of energy&quot; and as being a &quot;great fit&quot; for Yahiko.
Various publications for manga, anime and other media have provided acclaim and criticism of Yahiko&#x27;s character. While reviewing the volume 8 from the manga, Mania Entertainment writer Megan Lavey applauded the way Yahiko starts acting much stronger after Kenshin&#x27;s departure to Kyoto and noted that, along with the other characters starring in the volume, he is seen more in-depth. While reviewing volume 15, Lavey praised Yahiko&#x27;s development during the series as he becomes a good fighter and his courage shows a remarkable potential to become a powerful swordsman. However, Carlos Ross from T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews criticized Yahiko for being &quot;a bit annoying&quot; during the start of the series but noted that he has his enjoyable moments. Matthew Warner from the &quot;Fandom Post&quot; stated that the reboot incarnation of Yahiko underwent a major character arc in his battle. In the&quot; Critical Survey of Graphic Novels: Manga&quot;, multiple writers acknowledged how both Yahiko and Sagara Sanosuke spend their time in the series searching for ways to become stronger. However, they do it for a heroic reason which is assisting Kenshin.

His design in the OVA series has drawn acclaim as one of the few to be well translated from his original manga design by Mike Crandol from Anime News Network. In the second review from the OVA, Crandol liked that Yahiko appeared several times in contrast to the previous OVA in which he was &quot;written out&quot; so that the story would focus more in Kamiya Kaoru and Kenshin&#x27;s relationship. He also noted his battle against Himura Kenji to be very entertaining, but not as much as the previous fight which was between Kenshin and Yukishiro Enishi. Ridwan Khan from Animefringe noted the fight between Yahiko and Kenji had been long awaited, it was mostly overshadowed by Kenshin and Kaoru&#x27;s ending.

<text>A sick bay is a compartment in a ship, or a section of another organisation, such as a school or college, used for medical purposes.

The sick bay contains the ship&#x27;s medicine chest, which may be divided into separate cabinets, such as a refrigerator for medicines requiring cold storage and a locked cabinet for controlled substances such as morphine. The sick bay and the medicine chest should be kept locked, with the keys only being available to the medical officer and the ship&#x27;s master.

The term is also applied ashore by the United States Navy and Marine Corps to treatment clinics on naval stations and Marine bases.

Sick bays (sometimes referred to as med bays) appear in popular science fiction franchises, such as &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; and &quot;Star Trek&quot;, as the medical facility on board a starship.

<doc id="1033269" wikidata="Q598169" url="?curid=1033269" title="Priston Tale">
<text>PristonTale is a 3D fantasy MMORPG that centers on action-based role-playing. It was originally released in South Korea by Yedang Online in 2001. It was created by Triglow Pictures Inc. (later Priston Inc.) and has since been published for Japan, China, Taiwan, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Philippines, Brazil and the Spanish-speaking countries. In 2004, the English version of &quot;PristonTale&quot; went out of public beta (in which it had remained for nearly two years) and became a commercial pay-to-play game. On May 17, 2007, PristonTale announced free-to-play service for everyone; instead of paying for the game, PristonTale has a cash shop in which players can pay real money for game items. On September 30, 2008, the English server for Priston Tale closed; Suba Games opened a new English server three days later. There are more players in the private servers.

Some of the features of &quot;PristonTale&quot; include a clan system, in-game shops, ten character classes – all of which can use every item available if they have the correct upgraded statistics (with the exception of armour, robes, and orbs) – a five-tiered skill system for each class, item upgrades, a simple yet involving battle system and an easy to use interface. &quot;PristonTale&quot; is also intensive in potion using, and dying is moderately easy. The experience loss per death also tends to climb quite steeply (experience loss is based on a percentage of obtained experience), mirroring the ever increasing experience needed to level.

== Gameplay ==
Gameplay mostly consists of leveling up, though there are several activities players can participate in that are essential to the game. Some of these activities are:

* Trading: Buying and selling items. Players usually find this necessary in order to gain money and equipment otherwise unobtainable from NPC merchants.
* Clans: Players can join clans, in which teamwork prevails. They are the core of the social community of the game. Clans can also participate in special events created for clans only. Clans can be made once a player reaches level 40 or higher.
* Bellatra: formerly known as Survive or Die (SoD), a competition in which four teams with members of the same clan are forced to fight monsters until two teams are declared finalists. These two teams will continue fighting monsters until the last one survives. The winning team is chosen by whichever one has the higher number of points. Teams receive points by killing monsters and monster bosses. The Boss monsters give higher numbers of points. The winning team&#x27;s Clan Chief acquires rights over the Bellatra by gaining the ability to modify the monsters when the Chief fights next, by receiving an income from Bellatra, etc. Bellatra is located in the town Navisko and available for players level 80 and above.
* Bless Castle: Bless Castle is a Player vs. Player activity in which one clan holds and defends the castle from all other participating clans, which can use siege equipment.
* Ghost Castle: Three characters of different classes play together, can be done once a day. Entrance to Ghost Castle is in Garden of Freedom.
* Ardor: Also known as Ricarten SoD, located in the town Ricarten by the exit to Garden of Freedom, this is SoD for players level 40 to level 79.
* Trecor Yalta was known to be the main boss next to Fury 1, 2 &amp; 3

The other aspects of game play are &quot;training&quot;, &quot;climbing&quot;, hunting, player vs. player fights and socializing.
* Training: A player levels by killing large numbers of monsters at one given time, or many individual monsters quickly. Players may be in &quot;party&#x27;s&quot; of 2–6 and level together.
* Climbing : One will attempts to move their character in a way that causes s/he to be on top of structures inside the game.
* Hunting: One faces as few as one monster but usually no more than three, to look for certain items in the game.
* Player vs. Player: One goes to a specified area to compete against other players, sometimes only one and sometimes as many as twenty.
* Socializing: Self-explanatory, used in PristonTale to obtain items, throwing friends at enemies and anything else considered of value in the game.

Throughout the game, the characters progress through a series of levels and acquire skill points. As they progress they get different items, such as weapons and armour, to help them in their quest of achieving the ultimate warrior. Items of this calibre usually require a larger number of skill points in an area than the previous items. Armour in general helps the character stay alive longer by giving them different attributes. Weapons in general help the character defend themselves or attack any monster they wish with a lot more force.

At the same time, there are certain specifications as to when players may use such weapons and armour. These are mostly based on level and stat requirements. Also, there are certain specs for armour and weapons so that they may achieve their great performance and special stats. These may be found in game, written on the armour or weapon (e.g. Fighter Spec, Knight Spec, etc.). Different Classes use different weapons; for example, the knight mainly uses two-handed swords and blades, whereas the Archer uses bows. The different items players may obtain with specs determine which types of character classes use them. Most swords will come as Knight or Mechanician spec when most wands/staves will come as Magician Spec or Priestess Spec.

At higher level&#x27;s obtaining items can become quite difficult due to low supply and high demand for the &quot;high level&quot; items. Magic characters such a Priestess and Magician will find the market for their items is less competitive. Whereas the melee characters such as Fighter, Pikeman, and Knight have a higher rate of competition for items.

== Reception ==

&quot;PristonTale&quot; received an award for &quot;Outstanding Online Game&quot; in December 2002 and &quot;Outstanding Programming&quot; at the 2003 Korean Gaming Grand Ceremony.

==&quot;Priston Tale II&quot;==
The sequel to &quot;Priston Tale&quot; was released in February 2008. The developers sought to take the basic concepts of the first game and improve upon them. The development team stated at one point that they were &quot;inexperienced&quot; and had &quot;learnt a lot&quot; from the first version and that the second has had much better planning. Screenshots of the new game from E3 2006 depicted many recognizable characters, enemies, and environments, albeit altered significantly. It uses Unreal Engine 2.

As of 2008, &quot;Priston Tale 2&quot; has only been released outside of beta in South Korea. Player response in South Korea has been very good, with over 30,000 players online, playing simultaneously on the first day of open beta, and 40,000 players online simultaneously as of the third day. The game still maintains popularity and is competing with SP1 and Twelve Skies for market share, with tens of thousands of players online simultaneously at any given time.

Yedang Online has contracted with various publishers, and localized versions (including North America) will begin beta service in early to mid-2009. The European closed beta of &quot;Priston Tale II&quot; was released in October 2008. The open beta was released February 14, 2009 although access to the European open beta is subject to regional restrictions via an IP block on the login server. As of March 2013 English server of &quot;Priston Tale II&quot; closed down.

<doc id="1033278" wikidata="Q1126888" url="?curid=1033278" title="Songs in the Attic">
<text>Songs in the Attic is the first live album by Billy Joel, released in 1981. 

At the time of its release, it was the first widely available appearance of music from his first album, &quot;Cold Spring Harbor&quot;, released in 1971.

==History==
In the liner notes, Joel writes that &quot;Songs in the Attic&quot; introduced his earlier work to fans who had come to know his work after &quot;The Stranger&quot;. In that earlier work, most of the instruments were played by session musicians while Joel himself sang and played piano, keyboards, and harmonica. But by the late 1970s, Joel had a fairly consistent touring/recording band and wanted to showcase his songs as played by his band.

The single-releases included: &quot;Say Goodbye to Hollywood&quot;, which peaked at #17 on the U. S. Billboard Hot 100; and &quot;She&#x27;s Got a Way&quot;, which reached #23 on the same chart; and &quot;You&#x27;re My Home&quot;. In Japan, &quot;Los Angelenos&quot; was also available in 1981.

A series of promotional music videos were filmed. Though the concert filming may have been staged for the occasion, the audio versions are nonetheless different from the live recordings featuring on the live album. A total of five promo videos were filmed: four of them recorded at Sparks Saloon in Huntington, NY, and one in a recording studio. At least two of them were not released as worldwide official singles. 
&quot;Everybody Loves You Now&quot; (not a single) directed by Steve Cohen (live at Sparks); 
&quot;You&#x27;re My Home&quot; directed by Steve Cohen (live at Sparks); 
&quot;Los Angelenos&quot; (not a single, though a Japanese 7&quot; vinyl was in existence) directed by Steve Cohen (live at Sparks); 
&quot;Say Goodbye to Hollywood&quot; directed by Steve Cohen (live at Sparks); 
&quot;She&#x27;s Got a Way&quot; live in a studio, also a different version from the live album.

<doc id="1033288" wikidata="Q5526797" url="?curid=1033288" title="Gastric varices">
<text>Gastric varices are dilated submucosal veins in the lining of the stomach, which can be a life-threatening cause of bleeding in the upper gastrointestinal tract. They are most commonly found in patients with portal hypertension, or elevated pressure in the portal vein system, which may be a complication of cirrhosis. Gastric varices may also be found in patients with thrombosis of the splenic vein, into which the short gastric veins that drain the fundus of the stomach flow. The latter may be a complication of acute pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, or other abdominal tumours, as well as hepatitis C. Gastric varices and associated bleeding are a potential complication of schistosomiasis resulting from portal hypertension.

Patients with bleeding gastric varices can present with bloody vomiting (hematemesis), dark, tarry stools (melena), or rectal bleeding. The bleeding may be brisk, and patients may soon develop shock. Treatment of gastric varices can include injection of the varices with cyanoacrylate glue, or a radiological procedure to decrease the pressure in the portal vein, termed transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt or TIPS. Treatment with intravenous octreotide is also useful to shunt blood flow away from the stomach&#x27;s circulation. More aggressive treatment, including splenectomy (surgical removal of the spleen) or liver transplantation, may be required in some cases.

==Signs and symptoms==

Gastric varices can present in two major ways. First, patients with cirrhosis may be enrolled in screening gastroscopy programs to detect esophageal varices. These evaluations may detect gastric varices that are asymptomatic. When gastric varices are symptomatic, however, they usually present acutely and dramatically with upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The symptoms can include vomiting blood, melena (passing black, tarry stools); or passing maroon stools or frank blood in the stools. Many people with bleeding gastric varices present in shock due to the profound loss of blood.

Secondly, patients with acute pancreatitis may present with gastric varices as a complication of a blood clot in the splenic vein. The splenic vein sits over the pancreas anatomically. Inflammation or cancers of the pancreas may result in a blood clot forming in the splenic vein. As the short gastric veins of the fundus of the stomach drain into the splenic vein, thrombosis of the splenic vein will result in increased pressure and engorgement of the short veins, leading to varices in the fundus of the stomach.

Laboratory testing usually shows low red blood cell count and often a low platelet count. If cirrhosis is present, there may be coagulopathy manifested by a prolonged INR; both of these may worsen the bleeding from gastric varices.

In rare cases, gastric varices are caused by splenic vein occlusion as a result of the mass effect of slow-growing pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of gastric varices is often made at the time of upper endoscopy.

===Classification===
The Sarin classification of gastric varices identifies four different anatomical types of gastric varices, which differ in terms of treatment modalities:
*Type 1 Gastroesophageal Varices: Esophagus extending to lesser curvature of stomach
*Type 2 Gastroesophageal Varices: Esophagus extending to greater curvature of stomach
*Type 1 Gastric Varices: Isolated to the fundus
*Type 2 Gastric Varices: Anywhere in the stomach, or duodenum
Type 1 isolated gastric varices were seen only in primary cases (i.e. without prior sclerotherapy) in the original study of Sarin et al. (1992), while type 1 gastroesophageal varices were the most common overall.

Other classification systems include Hashizume&#x27;s classification and Arakawa&#x27;s classification.

==Treatment==
Initial treatment of bleeding from gastric varices focuses on resuscitation, much as with esophageal varices. This includes administration of fluids, blood products, and antibiotics.

Another treatment for gastric varices is injection of the varices with cyanoacrylate, first described by German surgeon Nib Soehendra and colleagues in 1986. The results from two randomized trials comparing band ligation vs cyanoacrylate suggests that endoscopic injection of cyanoacrylate, known as gastric variceal obliteration or GVO is superior to band ligation in preventing rebleeding rates. Cyanoacrylate, a common component in &#x27;super glue&#x27; is often mixed 1:1 with lipiodol to prevent polymerization in the endoscopy delivery optics, and to show on radiographic imaging. GVO is usually performed in specialized therapeutic endoscopy centers. Complications include sepsis, embolization of glue, and obstruction from polymerization in the lumen of the stomach.

Other techniques for refractory bleeding include:
* Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPS)
* Balloon occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration techniques (BRTO)
* Coil-assisted retrograde transvenous obliteration (CARTO)
* Gastric variceal ligation, although this modality is falling out of favour
* Intra-gastric balloon tamponade as a bridge to further therapy
** a caveat is that a larger balloon is required to occupy the fundus of the stomach where gastric varices commonly occur
* Liver transplantation

<doc id="1033291" wikidata="Q1143929" url="?curid=1033291" title="Kamba people">
<text>The Kamba or Akamba (sometimes called Wakamba) people are Bantu peoples ethnic group who predominantly live in Kenya stretching from Nairobi to Tsavo and northwards to Embu, in the southern part of the former Eastern Province. This land is called &quot;Ukambani&quot; and constitutes Makueni County, Kitui County and Machakos County. They also form the second largest ethnic group in 8 counties including Nairobi and Mombasa counties.

==Origin==
The Kamba are of Bantu origin and they are originally believed to have originated from the Congo Basin. They are also known as the &#x27;Akamba.&#x27; They are closely related in language and culture to the Kikuyu, the Embu, the Mbeere and the Meru of whom together they form the GEMA community, and to some extent relate closely to the Kambe and the Giriama of the Kenyan coast. The Kambas are concentrated in the lowlands of southeast Kenya from the vicinity of Mount Kenya to the coast.

The first group of Kamba people settled in the present-day Mbooni Hills in the Machakos District of Kenya. This was in the second half of the 17th century, before spreading to Machakos, Makueni and Kitui Districts.

Some authorities suggest that they arrived in their present lowlands east of the Mount Kenya area of habitation from earlier settlements further to the north and east. Others argue that the Kamba, along with their closely related Eastern Bantu neighbours the Kikuyu, the Embu, the Mbeere and the Meru, moved into Kenya from points further south.

==Distribution==
Most of the Akamba people live in Kenya, and are concentrated in the lower eastern counties of Machakos, Kitui, and Makueni.

According to the national census of 2019, there were 4,663,910 Akamba people in Kenya, being the fifth-most populous tribe in the country. Machakos is the most populous of the three Ukambani counties, with 1,421,932 residents. This is followed by Kitui (1,136,187 residents) then Makueni (987,653 residents). They make up the second largest ethnic demographics in each of the urban city - counties of Nairobi and Mombasa as well as Taita–Taveta, Kiambu, Muranga, Kirinyaga, Kwale and Kilifi counties. They also form the third largest ethnic group in Embu, Garissa, Meru and Kajiado counties. In Embu county the Kamba live in Mbeere South region and in Taita–Taveta County they are mainly concentrated in the Taveta region. They share a border with the Maasai people and are literally separated by the Kenya-Uganda railway from Athi-River to Kibwezi. Up until late 20th Century the Maasai and the Akamba communities were involved in persistent cattle-rustling and pasture conflicts especially on the pasture-rich Konza plains. This attracted the interest of colonial government who created Cooperative Society and the later the establishment of Konza, Potha and Malili Ranches where the proposed Konza Technology City sits.

==Kamba people outside of Kenya==
Apart from Kenya, Kamba people can also be found in Uganda, Tanzania and in Paraguay. The population of Akamba in Uganda is about 8,280, 110,000 in Tanzania and about 10,000 in Paraguay.

The Kamba people in the South American country of Paraguay form two groups: Kamba Cuá and Kamba Kokue with the former being the most famous. They arrived in Paraguay as members of a regiment of 250 spearmen (&#x27;lanceros de Artigas&#x27;), men and women, who accompanied General Jose Gervasio Artigas, in his exile in Paraguay in 1820. The Kamba Cuá are famous for their African traditional ballet that is described as the &quot;central cultural identity of the Afro-Paraguayan community&quot;.

==Language==
The Kamba speak the Kamba language (also known as Kikamba) as a mother tongue. It belongs to the Bantu branch of the Niger-Congo language family. Kikamba has no letters c, f, j, r, x, q and p in its alphabet.
The Swahili language reveals closer ties to the Akamba mother tongue, this being due to the various interactions of the Akamba people with Arab traders for centuries.

==Economy==
Like many Bantus, the Akamba were originally hunters and gatherers but later became long distance traders because of their knowledge of the expansive area they inhabited. They also had good relations with neighbouring communities as well as excellent communication skills. They would go on to later adopt subsistence farming and pastoralism due to the availability of the new lands that they came to occupy.

Today, the Akamba are often found engaged in different professions: some are agriculturalists, others are traders, while others have taken up formal jobs. The Kamba also practiced Barter trade with the Kikuyu, Maasai, Meru and Embu people in the interior and the Mijikenda and Arab people of the coast.

Over time, the Akamba extended their commercial activity and wielded economic control across the central part of the land that was later to be known as Kenya (from the Kikamba, &#x27;Ki&#x27;nyaa&#x27;, meaning &#x27;the Ostrich Country.&#x27; This was derived from the reference they made to Mount Kenya and its snow cap similar to the male Ostrich), from the Indian Ocean in the east to Lake Victoria in the west, and all the way up to Lake Turkana on the northern frontier. The Akamba traded in locally produced goods such as sugar cane wine, ivory, brass amulets, tools and weapons, millet, and cattle. The food obtained from trading helped offset shortages caused by droughts and famines experienced in their Kamba land.

They also traded in medicinal products known as &#x27;Miti&#x27; (literally: plants), made from various parts of the numerous medicinal plants found on the Southeast African plains. Maingi Ndonye Mbithi, commonly referred by his peers and locals as Kanyi, from Kimutwa village in Machakos was known for his concoction of herbs mixed with locally fermented brew (kaluvu) with the ability to heal cancerous boils (Mi&#x27;imu). The Akamba are still known for their fine work in wood carving, basketry and pottery and the products . Their artistic inclination is evidenced in the sculpture work that is on display in many craft shops and galleries in the major cities and towns of Kenya.

In the mid-eighteenth century, a large number of Akamba pastoral groups moved eastwards from the Tsavo and Kibwezi areas to the coast. This migration was the result of extensive drought and lack of pasture for their cattle. They settled in the Mariakani, Kinango, Kwale, Mombasa West (Changamwe and Chaani) and Mombasa North (Kisauni) areas of the coast of Kenya, creating the beginnings of urban settlement. They are still found in large numbers in these towns, and have been absorbed into the cultural, economic and political life of the modern-day Coast Province. Several notable businessmen and women, politicians, as well as professional men and women are direct descendants of these itinerant pastoralists.

==History==
===Colonialism and the 19th century===

In the latter part of the 19th century the Arabs took over the coastal trade from the Akamba, who then acted as middlemen between the Arab and Swahili traders and the tribes further upcountry. Their trade and travel made them ideal guides for the caravans gathering elephant tusks, precious stones and some slaves for the Middle Eastern, Indian, and Chinese markets. Early European explorers also used them as guides in their expeditions to explore Southeast Africa, due to their wide knowledge of the land and neutral standing with many of the other societies they traded with.

During the colonial era, British colonial officials considered the Kamba to be the premier martial race and sharp-shooters of Africa. The Kamba themselves appeared to embrace this label by enlisting in the colonial army in large numbers. After confidently describing the Kamba serving in the King&#x27;s African Rifles (the KAR, Britain&#x27;s East African colonial army) as loyal &quot;soldiers of the Queen&quot; during the Mau Mau Emergency, a press release by the East Africa Command went on to characterize the Kamba as a &quot;fighting race.&quot; These sentiments were echoed by other colonial observers in the early 1950s who deemed the Kamba a hardy, virile, courageous, and &quot;mechanically-minded tribe.&quot; Considered by many officers to be the &quot;best [soldierly] material in Africa,&quot; the Kamba supplied the KAR with askaris (soldiers) at a rate that was three to four times their percentage of the overall Kenyan population.&#x27;

The Kamba people successfully resisted an attempt by the British colonialists to seize their livestock in an obnoxious livestock control legislation in 1938. They peacefully fought the British until the law was repealed.Among the Akamba people, lack of rain is considered an event requiring ritual intervention. As a result, they perform a ritual rain making dance called Kilumi. It is a healing rite designed to restore environmental balance through spiritual blessings, movement, offering, and prayers. According to Akamba, Kilumi has been present since the very beginning of Kamba existence. This ritual emphasizes symbolic dance movements as a key force in achieving the goal of the ceremony. The heart of the dance ritual is its spiritual essence; in fact, it is the spiritual aspect that distinguishes the dances of Africans and their descendants worldwide. For this reason, it is important to understand the nature of rituals. Dance rituals take participants on a journey; they are designed to foster a transformation moving them to different states, with the ultimate goal of invoking spiritual intervention to resolve the problem at hand.

Akamba resistance to colonial &quot;pacification&quot; was mostly non-violent in nature. Some of the best known Akamba resistance leaders to colonialism were: Syokimau, Syotune wa Kathukye, Muindi Mbingu, and later Paul Ngei, JD Kali, and Malu of Kilungu. Ngei and Kali were imprisoned by the colonial government for their anti-colonial protests. Syotune wa Kathukye led a peaceful protest to recover cattle confiscated by the British colonial government during one of their raiding expeditions on the local populations.

Muindi Mbingu was arrested for leading another protest march to recover stolen land and cattle around the Mua Hills in Masaku district, which the British settlers eventually appropriated for themselves. JD Kali, along with Paul Ngei, joined the Mau Mau movement to recover Kenya for the Kenyan people. This movement took place between 1952 and 1960. He was imprisoned in Kapenguria during the fighting between the then government and the freedom fighters.

==Culture and beliefs==
Their origin myth is as follows:
&quot;In the beginning, Mulungu created a man and a woman. This was the couple from heaven and he proceeded to place them on a rock at Nzaui where their foot prints, including those of their livestock can be seen to this day.
Mulungu then caused a great rainfall. From the many anthills around, a man and a woman came out. These were the initiators of the &#x27;spirits clan&#x27;- the Aimo. It so happened that the couple from heaven had only sons while the couple from the anthill had only daughters. Naturally, the couple from heaven paid dowry for the daughters of the couple from the anthill. The family and their cattle greatly increased in numbers. With this prosperity, they forgot to give thanks to their creator. Mulungu punished them with a great famine. This led to dispersal as the family scattered in search of food. Some became the Kikuyu, others the Meru while some remained as the original people, the Akamba.&quot;
The Akamba are not specific about the number of children that each couple had initially borne.

The Akamba believe in a monotheistic, invisible and transcendental God, Ngai or Mulungu, who lives in the sky (&quot;yayayani&quot; or &quot;ituni&quot;). Another venerable name for God is Asa, or the Father. He is also known as Ngai Mumbi (God the Creator) na Mwatuangi (God the finger-divider). He is perceived as the omnipotent creator of life on earth and as a merciful, if distant, entity. The traditional Akamba perceive the spirits of their departed ones, the &quot;Aimu&quot; or &quot;Maimu&quot;, as the intercessors between themselves and Ngai Mulungu. They are remembered in family rituals and offerings / libations at individual altars.

===The Akamba family===
In Akamba culture, the family known as (Musyi) plays a central role in the community. The Akamba extended family or clan is called &quot;mbai&quot;. The man, who is the head of the family, is usually engaged in an economic activity popular among the community like trading, hunting, cattle-herding or farming. He is known as &quot;Nau&quot;, &quot;Tata&quot;, or &quot;Asa&quot;.

The woman, regardless of her husband&#x27;s occupation, works on her plot of land, which she is given upon joining her husband&#x27;s household. She supplies the bulk of the food consumed by her family. She grows maize, millet, sweet potatoes, pumpkin, beans, pigeon peas, greens, arrow root, cassava, and yam in cooler regions like Kangundo, Kilungu and Mbooni. It is the mother&#x27;s role to bring up the children. Even children that have grown up into adults are expected to never contradict the mother&#x27;s wishes. The mother is known as &quot;Mwaitu&quot; (&#x27;our One&#x27;).

Very little distinction is made between one&#x27;s children and nieces and nephews. They address their maternal uncle as &quot;inaimiwa&quot; and maternal aunts as &quot;mwendya&quot; and for their paternal uncle and aunt as &quot;mwendw&#x27;au&quot;. They address their paternal cousins as &quot;wa-asa&quot; or &quot;wa&#x27;ia&quot; (for men is &quot;mwanaasa&quot; or &quot;mwanaa&#x27;ia&quot;, and for women is &quot;mwiitu wa&#x27;asa&quot; or &quot;mwiitu wa&#x27;ia&quot;), and the maternal cousins (mother&#x27;s side) as &quot;wa mwendya&quot; (for men &quot;mwanaa mwendya&quot;; for women &quot;mwiitu wa mwendya&quot;). Children often move from one household to another with ease, and are made to feel at home by their aunts and uncles who, while in charge of their nephews/nieces, are their de facto parents.

Grandparents known as (&quot;Susu&quot; or (grandmother), &quot;Umau&quot; or &quot;Umaa&quot; (grandfather)) help with the less strenuous chores around the home, such as rope-making, tanning leather, carving of beehives, three-legged wooden stools, cleaning and decorating calabashes, making bows and arrows, etc. Older women continue to work the land, as this is seen as a source of independence and economic security. They also carry out trade in the local markets, though not exclusively. In the modern Akamba family, the women, especially in the urban regions, practice professions such as teaching, law, medicine, nursing, secretarial work, management, tailoring and other duties in accordance with Kenya&#x27;s socioeconomic evolution. The Kamba clans are: Anzauni, Aombe, Akitondo, Amwei (Angwina), Atwii, Amumui, Aethanga, Atangwa, Amutei, Aewani, Akitutu, Ambua, Aiini, Asii, Akiimi, Amũũti, Amũũnda.

===Naming and Kamba names===
Naming of children is an important aspect of the Akamba people. In most but not all cases, the first four children, two boys and two girls, are named after the grandparents on both sides of the family. The first boy is named after the paternal grandfather and the second after the maternal grandfather. Girls are similarly named. Because of the respect that the Kamba people observe between the varied relationships, there are people with whom they cannot speak on &quot;first name&quot; terms.

The father and the mother in-law on the husband&#x27;s side, for instance, can never address their daughter in-law by her first name. Neither can she address them by their first names. Yet she has to name her children after them. To solve this problem, a system of naming is adopted that gave names which were descriptive of the quality or career of the grandparents. Therefore, when a woman is married into a family, she is given a family name (some sort of baptismal name), such as &quot;Syomunyithya/ng&#x27;a Mutunga&quot;, that is, &quot;she who is to be the mother of Munyithya/Mutunga&quot;.

Her first son is to be called by this name. This name Munyithya was descriptive of certain qualities of the paternal grandfather or of his career. Thus, when she is calling her son, she would indeed be calling her father in-law, but at the same time strictly observing the cultural law of never addressing her in-laws by their first names.

After these four children are named, whose names were more or less predetermined, other children could be given any other names, sometimes after other relatives and / or family friends on both sides of the family. Occasionally, children were given names that were descriptive of the circumstances under which they were born:
*&quot;Nduku/Katuku&quot; (girl) and &quot;Mutuku/Kituku&quot; (boy) meaning born at night,
*&quot;Kiloko&quot; (girl) and &quot;Kioko&quot; (boy) born in the morning, 
*&quot;Mumbua/Syombua/ Mbula&quot; (girl) and &quot;Wambua/Mbua&quot; (boy) for the time of rain, 
*&quot;Wayua&quot; (girl) for the time of famine, 
*&quot;Makau&quot; (boy) for the time of war, 
*&quot;Musyoka/Kasyuko/Musyoki&quot; (boy) and &quot;Kasyoka/Kasyoki&quot; (girl) as a re-incarnation of a dead family member, 
*&quot;Mutua/Mutui&quot; (boy) and &quot;Mutuo/Mwikali&quot; (girl) as indicative of the long duration the parents had waited for this child, or a lengthy period of gestation.
*&quot;Munyao&quot; (boy) for the time of famine
*&quot;Mueni/Waeni&quot; (girl) for the time of visitors
*&quot;Maundu&quot; (boy) for the time of multiple activities/things
*&quot;Muthami/Muthama&quot; (boy) for the time of migration

Children were also given affectionate names as expressions of what their parents wished them to be in life. Such names would be like 
*&quot;Mutongoi&quot; (leader) 
*&quot;Musili&quot; (judge) 
*&quot;Muthui&quot; (the rich one)
*&quot;Ngumbau&quot; (hero, the brave one)
*&quot;Kitonga&quot; (wealthy one)

Of course, some of these names could be simply expressive of the qualities displayed by the man or woman after whom they were named. Very rarely, a boy may be given the name &quot;Musumbi&quot; (meaning &quot;king&quot;). I say very rarely because the Kamba people did not speak much in terms of royalty; they did not have a definite monarchical system. They were ruled by a council of elders called &quot;king&#x27;ole&quot;. There is a prophecy of a man, who traces his ancestry to where the sun sets (west) (in the present day county of Kitui) who will bear this name.

A girl could be called &quot;Mumbe&quot; meaning beautiful one or &quot;Mwende&quot; (beloved); Wild animal names like &quot;Nzoka&quot; (snake), &quot;Mbiti&quot; (hyena), &quot;Mbuku&quot; (hare), &quot;Munyambu&quot; (lion), or &quot;Mbiwa&quot; (fox); or domesticated animal names like &quot;Ngiti&quot; (dog), &quot;Ng&#x27;ombe&quot; (cow), or &quot;Nguku&quot; (chicken), were given to children born of mothers who started by giving stillbirths. This was done to wish away the bad omen and allow the new child to survive. Sometimes the names were used to preserve the good names for later children. There was a belief that a woman&#x27;s later children had a better chance of surviving than her first ones.

===Kikamba music===
The Akamba people&#x27;s love of music and dance is evidenced in their spectacular performances at many events in their daily lives or on occasions of regional and national importance. In their dances they display agility and athletic skills as they perform acrobatics and body movements. The Akamba dance techniques and style resemble those of the Batutsi of Rwanda-Burundi and the Aembu of Kenya. The earliest, most famous and respected traditional Kamba soloist who can be documented was Mailu Mboo and came from &quot;Kwa Vara&quot; Now mwingi.

The following are some of the varieties of traditional dance styles of the Akamba community:
* &quot;Mwali&quot; (plural &quot;Myali&quot;), a dance accompanying a song, the latter which is usually made to criticise anti-social behaviour.
* &quot;Kilumi&quot; and &quot;Ngoma&quot;, religious dances, performed at healing and rain-making ceremonies;
* &quot;Mwilu&quot; is a circumcision dance;
* &quot;Mbalya&quot; or &quot;Ngutha&quot; is a dance for young people who meet to entertain themselves after the day&#x27;s chores are done.
* &quot;Kamandiko&quot;, or the modern disco usually held after a wedding party.

Dances are usually accompanied by songs composed for the occasion (marriage, birth, nationally important occasion), and reflect the traditional structure of the Kikamba song, sung on a pentatonic scale. The singing is lively and tuneful. Songs are composed satirising deviant behaviour, anti-social activity, etc. The Akamba have famous work songs, such as &quot;Ngulu Mwelela&quot;, sung while work, such as digging, is going on. Herdsmen and boys have different songs, as do young people and old. During the Mbalya dances the dance leader will compose love songs and satirical numbers, to tease and entertain his/her dancers.

===Clothing and costumery===
The Akamba of the modern times, like most people in Kenya, dress rather conventionally in western / European clothing. The men wear trousers and shirts. Young boys will, as a rule, wear shorts and short-sleeved shirts, usually in cotton, or tee-shirts. Traditionally, Akamba men wore leather short kilts made from animal skins or tree bark. They wore copious jewellery, mainly of copper and brass. It consisted of neck-chains, bracelets, and anklets.

The women in modern Akamba society also dress in the European fashion, taking their pick from dresses, skirts, trousers, jeans and shorts, made from the wide range of fabrics available in Kenya. Primarily, however, skirts are the customary and respectable mode of dress. In the past, the women were attired in knee-length leather or bark skirts, embellished with bead work. They wore necklaces made of beads, these obtained from the Swahili and Arab traders. They shaved their heads clean, and wore a head band intensively decorated with beads. The various kilumi or dance groups wore similar colours and patterns on their bead work to distinguish themselves from other groups.

Traditionally, both men and women wore leather sandals especially when they ventured out of their neighbourhoods to go to the market or on visits. While at home or working in their fields, however, they remained barefoot.

Schoolchildren, male and female, shave their heads to maintain the spirit of uniformity and equality. Currently the most popular Kamba artist include; Ken Wamaria, Kativui, Kitunguu, Katombi, Maima, Vuusya Ungu etc. Ken Wamaria is rated as the top artist in Ukambani and the richest Kenyan artist (Kioko, 2012).

<text>The Rutan Model 202 Boomerang is an aircraft designed and built by Burt Rutan, with the first prototype taking flight in 1996. The design was intended to be a multi-engine aircraft that in the event of failure of a single engine would not become dangerously difficult to control due to asymmetric thrust. The result is an asymmetrical aircraft with a very distinct appearance.

==Design and development==
The Boomerang was designed around the specifications of the Beechcraft Baron 58, one of the best known and most numerous twin-engine civilian aircraft. The use of the asymmetrical design allows the Boomerang to fly faster and farther than the Baron using smaller engines, and seating the same number of occupants.
The Boomerang is powered by two engines, with the right engine producing 10 hp (8 kW) more power than the left one (the engines are in fact the same model, just rated differently). The wings are forward-swept.

A single prototype was completed in 1996, registered as N24BT. It was operated by Rutan for six years.

Rutan&#x27;s Boomerang was restored to flying condition in 2011 and made an appearance at Oshkosh that year as part of the Tribute to Rutan.

==Morrow Aircraft Corporation MB-300==
In 1997, avionics entrepreneur Ray Morrow and his son, Neil, founded an air taxi company, Skytaxi. Initially they used Cessna 414s as interim aircraft, but in the long term they planned to use a modified version of Rutan&#x27;s Boomerang design, which they designated the MB-300, and founded Morrow Aircraft Corporation in order to design and manufacture the MB-300.
In 1999, Morrow applied to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) of the United States for a type certificate for the MB-300, however development was suspended in 2002 before the prototype was completed, and was not resumed.

<doc id="1033297" wikidata="Q153484" url="?curid=1033297" title="Resident Evil (film)">
<text>Resident Evil is a 2002 action horror film written and directed by Paul W. S. Anderson. The film stars Milla Jovovich, Michelle Rodriguez, Eric Mabius, James Purefoy, Martin Crewes, and Colin Salmon. It is the first installment in the &quot;Resident Evil&quot; film series, which is loosely based on the video game series of the same name. Borrowing elements from the video games &quot;Resident Evil&quot; and &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot;, the film follows amnesiac heroine Alice and a band of Umbrella Corporation commandos as they attempt to contain the outbreak of the T-virus at a secret underground facility.

German studio Constantin Film bought the rights to adapt the series in live-action in January 1997. Several writers and filmmakers, such as Alan B. McElroy, George A. Romero and Jamie Blanks, were initially hired to direct and write the film, but their scripts were rejected. In 2000, Anderson was announced as writer and director. Developed as a prequel set in the same continuity as the video game series, the film was initially titled &quot;Resident Evil: Ground Zero&quot;, but was retitled after the September 11 attacks. Cast was announced in early 2001 and principal photography commenced in March 2001 in Berlin.

&quot;Resident Evil&quot; was theatrically released in Germany on March 12, 2002, by Constantin Film Verleih, and in the United Kingdom on July 12, 2002, by Pathé Distribution. It received generally negative reviews from critics but grossed $103 million worldwide against a production budget of $33 million. It was followed by five sequels establishing their own continuity: &quot;Apocalypse&quot; (2004), &quot;Extinction&quot; (2007), &quot;Afterlife&quot; (2010), &quot;Retribution&quot; (2012), and &quot;The Final Chapter&quot; (2016).

==Plot==
Underneath Raccoon City, a genetic research facility called the Hive is owned by the Umbrella Corporation. A thief steals the genetically engineered T-virus and contaminates the Hive with it. In response, the facility&#x27;s artificial intelligence, the Red Queen, seals the Hive and kills everyone inside to prevent the virus from leaking into the outside world.

Alice awakens in the bathroom of a deserted mansion, suffering amnesia. An unknown person tackles her as a group of commandos led by James Shade breaks in. Alice&#x27;s attacker claims to be Matt Addison, who just transferred as a cop in Raccoon P.D. Alice and Matt are ordered to go down to the Hive with the group, where they find another amnesiac, Spence, hidden in their train. The commandos explain that everyone in the group except Matt is an employee of the Umbrella Corporation, and Alice and her partner Spence were assigned to guard the Hive&#x27;s secret entrance beneath the mansion under the pretense of being married.

A laser defense system kills Shade and three more commandos outside the Red Queen&#x27;s chamber. Despite the Red Queen&#x27;s pleas for the group to leave, Kaplan disables it, causing the power to fail and all of the doors in the Hive to open. This releases the zombified staff and containment units holding Lickers, creatures created through experimentation with the T-virus. The horde attacks the group, and J.D. dies while the rest are separated. Alice starts regaining her memories while Matt finds his sister Lisa zombified. Alice saves him, and Matt explains that he and Lisa were environmental activists. Lisa infiltrated Umbrella to smuggle out the evidence of illegal experiments and shut Umbrella down. Alice remembers that she was Lisa&#x27;s contact in the Hive but does not tell Matt. The survivors reunite at the Red Queen&#x27;s chamber, where the commandos explain they have one hour before the Hive traps them inside automatically. Alice and Kaplan activate the Red Queen to find an exit; they rig a remote shutdown to force her cooperation.

As they escape through maintenance tunnels, zombies ambush them, and a reanimated J.D. bites Rain before she shoots him dead. They reach safety except Kaplan, who is bitten and separated from the group. Alice remembers that an anti-virus is in the lab, but they find it missing. Spence’s memory returns, revealing he was the thief who stole and purposefully released the T-virus in the beginning; he hid both the T-virus and anti-virus on the train. Spence turns against the others but is bitten by a zombie before trapping the survivors in the lab. Spence retrieves the anti-virus but is killed by a Licker. The Red Queen offers to spare Alice and Matt if they kill Rain, who has been infected. A power outage occurs. Kaplan appears, having shut down the Red Queen to open the lab doors. The group heads to the train, where Alice retrieves the anti-virus and kills a reanimated Spence.

On the train, they inject Rain and Kaplan with the anti-virus. The Licker attacks them, clawing Matt and killing Kaplan. Alice subdues the Licker before a zombified Rain attacks Matt, the anti-virus having failed to cure her. He shoots Rain dead.

At the mansion, Matt&#x27;s wound begins mutating. Before Alice can give him the anti-virus, a group of Umbrella scientists seizes them. They reveal Matt is to be put into the Nemesis Program, and the Hive is to be re-opened for an investigation into the incident.

Sometime later, Alice awakens at the Raccoon City Hospital strapped to an examination table. She escapes outside, only to find Raccoon City in ruins. She retrieves a shotgun from an abandoned police car for defense.

==Cast==

==Production==
===Development===
German production company Constantin Film bought the live-action film rights for &quot;Resident Evil&quot; in January 1997, and hired screenwriter Alan B. McElroy to write the script. At the time, McElroy was also writing the film adaptation for another video game, &quot;Doom&quot;, which ultimately wasn&#x27;t used. The June 1998 issue of &quot;&quot; published an article about McElroy&#x27;s &quot;Resident Evil&quot; script. Described as action- and horror-packed and very violent, the script was similar to the original game. Some changes were made; for example, there was no mention of the Umbrella Corporation or STARS. Instead, the plot followed a special forces team sent by the government to rescue scientists from the mansion laboratory after the SWAT team sent in earlier was killed, during which they realize the mission was a trap and that they are specimens in a medical experiment. The script included all major characters and monsters from the game. McElroy&#x27;s script was rejected.

In 1998, George A. Romero directed a television commercial for the video game &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot;. The original game&#x27;s director, Shinji Mikami, is a fan of Romero and had been influenced by his films. The commercial was only shown in Japan, but impressed Sony enough for them to ask him to write and direct &quot;Resident Evil&quot;. Romero stated that he had his secretary play the entire game through and record the gameplay so he could study it as a resource. Romero&#x27;s screenplay was based on the first &quot;Resident Evil&quot; game and included characters from the video games. Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine were the lead characters, involved in a romantic relationship. Barry Burton, Rebecca Chambers, Ada Wong, and Albert Wesker were to also appear. The ending to the film would have been similar to the first &quot;Resident Evil&quot; game. Romero also hired artist Bernie Wrightson to design some concept artwork of creatures for the film, and Wrightson did several designs of Tyrant, based on its look in the original game and its description in Romero&#x27;s script. In a 2002 interview in &quot;Fangoria&quot;, Romero said that he wrote a total of five or six different drafts, but that they were rejected. Robert Kulzer, head of the production, said that, although he felt Romero&#x27;s script was good, the film would have received an NC-17 rating if it had been approved. He also said that the producers thought that McElroy did well with his script, but that they rejected it because, by the time it was finished, the second game would have been released and they felt a film based on the first game would appear dated. Romero said a number of people from Capcom and Constantin supported his script, but Constantin head Bernd Eichinger ultimately rejected it. In 2019, the University of Pittsburgh&#x27;s Library System acquired the &quot;George A. Romero Archival Collection&quot;, which included material involving his work on &quot;Resident Evil&quot;. These include several more copies of Romero&#x27;s &quot;Resident Evil&quot; script, and a first draft of McElroy&#x27;s script, dated May 29, 1997, all of which are available to read at the university. A documentary based on this adaptation was released on digital on January 7, 2025.

In 2000, director Jamie Blanks was attached to a new adaptation that was said to borrow more elements from the &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot; and &quot;Resident Evil 3: Nemesis&quot; games.

In 1995, Paul W. S. Anderson&#x27;s low budget film &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; became one of the first commercially successful video game adaptations. After playing &quot;Resident Evil&quot;, Anderson saw its cinematic potential and wrote a script titled &quot;Undead&quot;, which he described as &quot;a ripoff&quot; of the game. Bernd Eichinger, head of Constantin Film, was enthusiastic, so Anderson developed it into the script for &quot;Resident Evil&quot;. In late 2000, Anderson was announced as director and writer, and &quot;Resident Evil&quot; re-entered pre-production stages. Anderson stated the film would not include any tie-ins with the video game series as &quot;under-performing movie tie-ins are too common and &quot;Resident Evil&quot;, of all games, deserved a good celluloid representation&quot;.

===Casting===
In early 2001, Michelle Rodriguez, James Purefoy and Milla Jovovich were the first of the cast to be signed on the project. David Boreanaz was intended to portray the male cop lead of Matt Addison, but he turned down the role to continue work on the WB series &quot;Angel&quot;. Boreanaz suggested that he was in negotiations to have a smaller role in the film, but he later declined the role. The role of Matt Addison then went to Eric Mabius who was cast in March 2001, along with Heike Makatsch, who was cast as Matt Addison&#x27;s sister Lisa Addison, an employee working for Umbrella&#x27;s Hive facility.

===Filming and story development===

In early March 2001, half of the film was to be shot in Adlershof Studios in Berlin and its surroundings. Principal photography began on March 5, 2001, at numerous locations including the then-unfinished station U-Bahnhof Bundestag of the Berlin U-Bahn, Landsberger Allee, Kaserne Krampnitz and the Schloss Lindstedt.

The film was originally subtitled as &quot;Resident Evil: Ground Zero&quot; when it was considered a prequel to the games, but the subtitle was removed following 9/11. The film&#x27;s synopsis as of March 16, 2001 revealed that Jovovich&#x27;s Alice and Rodriguez&#x27;s Rain were the leaders of a commando team sent in to prevent a viral outbreak from spreading to the rest of the world. The character of the Red Queen was added into the film&#x27;s story as an homage to Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;.

During production, professional dancers were hired to star as zombies as they had better control of their body movements. While computer effects were used on some zombies, much of the undead appearances were accomplished through make-up while their movements were a more laissez-faire approach, as Anderson told the actors to move however they thought a zombie would, given their conditions. Whilst filming, there was a shortage of manpower where the available dancers were not enough to represent the required numbers of undead, but some of Capcom&#x27;s executives and several of the film producers including Jeremy Bolt agreed to make appearances. The film&#x27;s stunt coordinator also made an appearance as the dog trainer while Bolt&#x27;s girlfriend and sister both appeared as zombies.

The film&#x27;s score and soundtrack were composed by Marco Beltrami and Marilyn Manson during mid-2001. Manson described the score and soundtrack as being more &quot;electronic&quot; than his previous work.

==Relationship to the games==
Elements are borrowed from &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot; and &quot;Resident Evil 3: Nemesis&quot;, including Alice&#x27;s character awakening in Raccoon City Hospital with a viral outbreak occurring in the city. There are several references to characters and organizations such as the Umbrella Corporation, the Nemesis program, the underground train bearing the moniker &quot;Alexi-5000&quot; (a double callback to a similar train in &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot; and &quot;Code: Veronica&quot;″s villain Alexia Ashford), and a police cruiser, from which Alice takes out a shotgun, with a &quot;STARS&quot; logo on the hood. Jason Isaacs appears uncredited in the film as an unnamed masked doctor, a reference to William Birkin. The character of Dr. Isaacs (played by Iain Glen) in the later films is named after him.

Other references include Alice examining the mansion outside, where crows are visible; crows are minor enemies throughout the games. Alice finds a picture of her wedding day with Spence, which is in the same style as the photos in the first version of the &quot;Resident Evil&quot; game: black-and-white with the foreground image noticeably spliced into the background. In the newspaper at the end of the film, the words &quot;Horror in Raccoon City! More Victims Dead!&quot; are shown in the upper right corner. This is a reference to the same newspaper in the censored opening of the first &quot;Resident Evil&quot; game and the prologue chapter for the &quot;Resident Evil: The Umbrella Conspiracy&quot; novel. Near the beginning of the film, Alice examines a statue after the wind blows its cover off. This statue is similar in design to one in the mansion of the first game.

While returning to the Red Queen&#x27;s chamber, Kaplan points out that the four bodies of the group&#x27;s dead crew from the Glass Hallway Trap sequence are gone. This is a reference to the games, where the bodies of enemies disappear. When the survivors make their escape from the Hive with a countdown as they fight the Licker, this is a reference to the &quot;Resident Evil&quot; game which ends with a five-minute countdown, during which the boss must be defeated.

Anderson has stated that the film&#x27;s camera angles and several shots allude to the video game&#x27;s camera angles, such as the fight between Alice and the security guard. These include a scene near the beginning where there is a close up of Alice&#x27;s eye, a direct reference to the title screen of the first game. In another scene, Alice awakes and hears a creepy sound, which is a reference to the plot of the first game.

==Release==
===Marketing===
In March 2001, the official website was set up, which revealed the film&#x27;s original October 26, 2001 release and a redirect to the film&#x27;s production company Constantin Film. The website was fully opened in July 2001, and composed of images, plot info, character biographies and downloads. In January 2002, the film was officially announced to have an R rating, although Anderson decided not to make it as gory as the games. Originally it received an NC-17 rating and Anderson had to make cuts; the uncut version was teased but never released.

In December 2001, Sony gave fans a chance to design the film&#x27;s poster with a prize of an undisclosed amount of cash and free screening of the film, with the final design being the film&#x27;s poster. On February 16, 2002, Nick Des Barres, a 23-year-old aspiring actor and ex-video game magazine designer, was announced as the winner of the competition. The film&#x27;s trailer and clips were released in late January and early February 2002. &quot;Resident Evil&quot; was released on March 15, 2002, in the US.

On June 29, 2004, over two years after the film&#x27;s release, a novelization by Keith R. A. DeCandido was published.

===Distribution===
In May 2001, it was announced that Sony Pictures Releasing would distribute the film in North America and Italy through their Screen Gems label. It was suggested by Capcom executives that the film would not be released in 2001, but rather in 2002, which was later confirmed by Sony in August 2001. The film was set for release on April 5, 2002, before being pushed forward to a March 15 release.

In December 2001, it was announced that Pathé and FilmFour had acquired the British theatrical distribution rights to the movie as part of a partnership between the two companies. They would both share acquisition and distribution costs and divide profits equally, while Pathé&#x27;s UK distribution arm would handle distribution.

=== Home media ===

&quot;Resident Evil&quot;: Special Edition was released on VHS and DVD by Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment on July 30, 2002, in the United States, April 14, 2003 by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment in the United Kingdom and October 2002 by Buena Vista Home Entertainment in Australia. It was a special edition release, with a number of documentaries including five featurettes, one of which explained the making of &quot;Resident Evil&quot;, the film&#x27;s score composition, costume design, set design, zombie make up tests, and the music video for a remixed version of &quot;My Plague&quot; by Slipknot.

A Deluxe Edition was released on September 7, 2004, which included new special features such as an alternate ending with director Anderson&#x27;s video introduction, a clip compilation for &quot;Apocalypse&quot;, From Game to Screen featurette, a storyboarding &quot;Resident Evil&quot; featurette, and 6 other exclusive featurettes: The Creature, The Elevator, The Train, The Laser, Zombie Dogs and Zombies.

Screen Gems released &quot;Resident Evil: Resurrected Edition&quot;, a 2-disc package containing &quot;Resident Evil&quot; and &quot;Resident Evil: Apocalypse&quot;, on September 4, 2007.

On January 1, 2008, a Blu-ray of the &quot;Resident Evil&quot; trilogy was released. The film was also released on Ultra HD Blu-ray along with the five sequels on November 17, 2020.

=== Television ===
In the United Kingdom, it was watched by viewers on television during the first half of 2005, making it the eighth most-watched UK film on television during that period.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film opened in 2,528 theaters and grossed $17,707,106 on its opening weekend (March 15–17, 2002), ranking in second place behind &quot;Ice Age&quot;. The film grossed $40,119,709 domestically and $103,787,401 worldwide.

===Critical response===

On Rotten Tomatoes the film has a score of 36% based on reviews from 132 critics and an average rating of 4.6/10. The consensus reads, &quot;Like other video game adaptations, &quot;Resident Evil&quot; is loud, violent, formulaic, and cheesy.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has an average score of 35 out of 100 based on 24 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Robert K. Elder from the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; thought the film &quot;updates the zombie genre with an anti-corporate message while still scaring its audience and providing heart-pounding action&quot;. Owen Gleiberman from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; noted: the film is as &quot;impersonal in its relentlessness as the video-game series that inspired it&quot;.

&quot;Resident Evil&quot; and its sequel appeared on Roger Ebert&#x27;s most hated films list, published in 2005. In his review, Ebert described it as a zombie movie set in the 21st century, where &quot;large metallic objects make crashing noises just by being looked at&quot;, and criticized the dialogue for being a series of commands and explanations with no &quot;small talk&quot;.

In 2014, filmmaker James Cameron named &quot;Resident Evil&quot; his biggest guilty pleasure.

===Accolades===
==Sequels==
After commercial success at the box office, a sequel, &quot;Resident Evil: Apocalypse&quot; (2004) was released. It was followed by &quot;Resident Evil: Extinction&quot; (2007), &quot;Resident Evil: Afterlife&quot; (2010), &quot;Resident Evil: Retribution&quot; (2012) and &quot;Resident Evil: The Final Chapter&quot; (2016). Anderson did not direct the second or third films due to filming commitments with &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot; (2004) and &quot;Death Race&quot; (2008).

<text>A shift-share analysis, used in regional science, political economy, and urban studies, determines what portions of regional economic growth or decline can be attributed to national, economic industry, and regional factors. The analysis helps identify industries where a regional economy has competitive advantages over the larger economy. A shift-share analysis takes the change over time of an economic variable, such as employment, within industries of a regional economy, and divides that change into various components. A traditional shift-share analysis splits regional changes into just three components, but other models have evolved that expand the decomposition into additional components.

== Overview ==
A shift-share analysis attempts to identify the sources of regional economic changes. The region can be a town, city, country, statistical area, state, or any other region of the country. The analysis examines changes in an economic variable, such as migration, a demographic statistic, firm growth, or firm formations, although employment is most commonly used. The shift-share analysis is performed on a set of economic industries, like those defined by the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). The analysis separates the regional economic changes within each industry into different categories. Although there are different versions of a shift-share analysis, they all identify national, industry, and regional factors that influence the variable changes.

== Traditional model ==
The traditional form of the shift-share analysis was developed by Daniel Creamer in the early 1940s, and was later formalized by Edgar S. Dunn in 1960. Also known as the &quot;comparative static model&quot;, it examines changes in the economic variable between two years. Changes are calculated for each industry in the analysis, both regionally and nationally. Each regional change is decomposed into three components. 
# &quot;National growth effect&quot; is the portion of the change attributed to the total growth of the national economy. It equals the theoretical change in the regional variable had it increased by the same percentage as the national economy. 
# &quot;Industry mix effect&quot; is the portion of the change attributed to the performance of the specific economic industry. It equals the theoretical change in the regional variable had it increased by the same percentage as the industry nationwide, minus the national growth effect.
# &quot;Local share effect&quot; is the portion of the change attributed to regional influences, and is the component of primary concern to regional analysts. It equals the actual change in the regional variable, minus the previous two effects.

===Formula===
The regional change in the variable within industry between the two years and is defined as the sum of the three shift-share effects: national growth effect (), industry mix effect (), and local share effect ().

:formula_1

The beginning and ending values of the economic variable within a particular industry are and , respectively. Each of the three effects is defined as a percentage of the beginning value of the economic variable.

:formula_2

:formula_3

:formula_4

The total percent change in the economic variable nationwide for all industries combined is , while the national and regional industry-specific percent changes are and , respectively.

These three equations substituted into the first equation yield the following expression (from where the decomposition starts), which simply says that the regional economic variable (for industry i) grows at the speed of the regional industry-specific percent change. Note that usually (in case of slow growth) 0 &lt; gi &lt; 1 and that refers to the whole period from to .

:formula_5

=== Example ===
As an example, a shift-share analysis might be utilized to examine changes in the construction industry of a state&#x27;s economy over the past decade, using employment as the economic variable studied. Total national employment may have increased 5% over the decade, while national construction employment increased 8%. However, state construction employment decreased 2%, from 100,000 to 98,000 employees, for a net loss of 2,000 employees.

The national growth effect is equal to the beginning 100,000 employees, times the total national growth rate of 5%, for an increase in 5,000 employees. The shift-share analysis implies that state construction would have increased by 5,000 employees, had it followed the same trend as the overall national economy.

The industry mix effect is equal to the original 100,000 employees times the growth in the industry nationwide, which was 8%, minus the total national growth of 5%. This results in an increase in 3,000 employees (100,000 employees times 3%, which is the 8% industry growth minus the 5% total growth). The analysis implies that the state construction would have increased by another 3,000 employees had it followed the industry trends, because the construction industry nationwide performed better than the national economy overall.

The local share effect in this example is equal to the beginning 100,000 employees times the state construction employment growth rate of −2% (it is &quot;negative&quot; because of the loss of employees), minus the national construction growth rate of 8%. This results in 100,000 employees times -10%, for a loss of 10,000 employees. However, the actual employment loss was only 2,000 employees, but that equals the sum of the three effects (5,000 gain + 3,000 gain + 10,000 loss). The analysis implies that local factors lead to a decrease in 10,000 employees in the state construction industry, because the growth in both the national economy and the construction industry should have increased state construction employment by 8,000 employees (the 5,000 national share effect plus the 3,000 industry mix effect).

===Names and regions===

Shift-share analysts sometimes use different labels for the three effects, although the calculations are the same. National growth effect may be referred to as &quot;national share&quot;. Industry mix effect may be referred to as &quot;proportional shift&quot;. Local share effect may be referred to as &quot;differential shift&quot;, &quot;regional shift&quot;, or &quot;competitive share&quot;.

In most shift-share analyses, the regional economy is compared to the national economy. However, the techniques may be used to compare any two regions (e.g., comparing a county to its state).

== Dynamic model ==

In 1988, Richard Barff and Prentice Knight, III, published the dynamic model shift-share analysis. In contrast to the comparative static model, which only considers two years in its analysis (the beginning and ending years), the dynamic model utilizes every year in the study period. Although it requires much more data to perform the calculations, the dynamic model takes into account continuous changes in the three shift-share effects, so the results are less affected by the choice of starting and ending years. The dynamic model is most useful when there are large differences between regional and national growth rates, or large changes in the regional industrial mix.

The dynamic model uses the same techniques as the comparative static model, including the same three shift-share effects. However, in the dynamic model, a time-series of traditional shift-share calculations are performed, comparing each year to the previous year. The annual shift-share effects are then totaled together for the entire study period, resulting in the dynamic model&#x27;s shift-share effects.

=== Formula ===
The regional change in the variable within industry between the two years and is defined as the sum of the three shift-share effects: national growth effect (), industry mix effect (), and local share effect ().

:formula_1

If the study period ranges from year to year , then traditional shift-share effects are calculated for every year , where spans from to . The dynamic model shift-share effects are then calculated as the sum of the annual effects.

:formula_7

:formula_8

:formula_9

The growth rates used in the calculations are annual rates, not growth from the beginning year in the study period, so the percent change from year to in the economic variable nationwide for all industries combined is , while the national and regional industry-specific percent changes are and , respectively.

== Esteban-Marquillas Model ==

In 1972, J.M. Esteban-Marquillas extended the traditional model to address criticism that the regional share effect is correlated to the regional industrial mix. In the Esteban-Marquillas model, the regional share effect itself is decomposed into two components, isolating a regional shift component that is not correlated to the industrial mix. The model introduced a then-new concept to shift-share analyses, a homothetic level of the economic variable within an industry. This is the theoretical value of the variable within an industry assuming the region has the same industrial mix as the nation.

In the Esteban-Marquillas model, the calculations of the national share and industrial mix effects are unchanged. However, the regional share effect in the traditional model is separated into two effects: a new regional share effect that is not dependent on the industrial mix, and an allocation effect that is. The allocation effect indicates the extent to which the region is specialized in those industries where it enjoys a competitive advantage.

=== Formula ===
The regional change in the variable within industry between the two years and is defined as the sum of the four shift-share effects: national growth effect (), industry mix effect (), regional share effect (), and allocation effect ().

:formula_10

The beginning and ending values of the economic variable within a particular industry are and , respectively. The beginning value of the regional homothetic variable within a particular industry is . It is based on the regional and national values of the economic variable across all industries, and respectively, and the industry-specific national value .

:formula_11

Each of the four shift-share effects is defined as a percentage of either the beginning value of the economic variable, the homothetic variable, or the difference of the two. 
:formula_12

:formula_13

:formula_14

:formula_15

The total percent change in the economic variable nationwide for all industries combined is , while the national and regional industry-specific percent changes are and , respectively.

== Arcelus Model ==
In 1984, Francisco Arcelus built upon Esteban-Marquillas&#x27; use of the homothetic variables and extended the traditional model even further. He used this method to decompose the national share and industrial mix effects into &quot;expected&quot; and &quot;differential&quot; components. The expected component is based on the homothetic level of the variable, and is the effect not attributed to the regional specializations. The differential component is the remaining effect, which is attributable to the regional industrial mix. 
Arcelus claimed that, even with the Esteban-Marquillas extension, the regional share effect is still related to the regional industry mix, and that the static model assumes all regional industries operate on a national market basis, focusing too heavily on the export markets and ignoring the local markets. In order to address these issues, Arcelus used a different method for separating the regional share effect, resulting in a &quot;regional growth effect&quot; and a &quot;regional industry mix effect&quot;. Both of these are decomposed into expected and differential components using the homothetic variable.

=== Formula ===
The regional change in the variable within industry between the two years and is defined as the sum of the eight shift-share effects: expected national growth effect (), differential national growth effect (), expected industry mix effect (), differential industry mix effect (), expected regional growth effect (), differential regional growth effect (), expected regional industry mix effect (), and differential regional industry mix effect ().

:formula_16

The eight effects are related to the three traditional shift-share effects from the comparative static model.

:formula_17

:formula_18

:formula_19

The homothetic variable is calculated the same as in the Esteban-Marquillas model. The beginning value of the regional homothetic variable within a particular industry is . It is based on the regional and national values of the economic variable across all industries, and respectively, and the industry-specific national value .

:formula_11

Each of the eight shift-share effects is defined as a percentage of either the beginning value of the economic variable, the homothetic variable, or the difference of the two. 
:formula_21

:formula_22
:formula_23

:formula_24

:formula_25

:formula_26

:formula_27

:formula_28

The total percent changes in the economic variable nationally and regionally for all industries combined are and respectively, while the national and regional industry-specific percent changes are and , respectively.

<text>The ARWEN 37 is a less-lethal launcher which fires a variety of 37mm less-lethal munitions which includes direct impact batons, chemical irritant delivery munitions and smoke delivery munitions. The ARWEN 37 has 5-round rotary drum magazine.

== History ==
In 1977 the British government directed their Royal Small Arms Factory (RSAF) Enfield, then part of the Royal Ordnance Factories, to develop a weapon for effective crowd control that would outperform existing weapon systems.

By 1979 a design team led by Norman Trevor Brint designed three prototypes for consideration:

* The Enfield XL75E1, which incorporated a pump action
* The Enfield XL76E1, which incorporated a rotary magazine capable of holding five rounds 
* The Enfield XL77E1, which incorporated a semi automatic box style magazine

After initial testing it was the Enfield XL76E1 which was chosen for further development. As almost all weapons designed or produced at the Royal Small Arms Factory incorporate the letters EN or the word Enfield into their name, and the fact that it featured a 37mm barrel, the Enfield XL76E1 was officially designated the ARWEN 37 (Anti Riot Weapon ENfield).

General production of the first generation of the ARWEN 37, the Mk I, began in 1984 in Enfield, England.

The second generation of the ARWEN 37, the Mk II, were produced in Nottingham, England.

In 2001, all ARWEN trademarks and patents were acquired by the Canadian Police Ordnance Company Inc., who began production of the third generation, or Mk III, variety of the ARWEN 37. The launcher is currently manufactured under license in Canada.

== Design ==
Unlike many 37mm launchers which have a smooth bore, the ARWEN 37 features a rifled barrel.

The launcher features a revolver like rotary magazine which holds five munitions and which allows for a rate of fire of five rounds in four seconds without reloading. The rotary magazine can be manually unloaded or topped up by the user at any time in a rapid manner.

Many ARWEN 37 parts are constructed of anodized aluminum or proprietary polymer so that the overall weight of the launcher can be kept to an absolute minimum.

Because of their unique design, ARWEN munitions (rounds) act as the chamber for the launcher when it is fired. This means that the rotary magazine housing can be designed in such a way that the user can easily look inside of the launcher and instantly identify how many and what type of munitions have been loaded into it, an important safety feature.

== Munition Types ==
The ARWEN 37 is part of a less lethal system which incorporates a variety of less lethal munitions which can be deployed through the same launcher.

The AR-1 munition consists of a proprietary polymer baton which is intended to be deployed at living tissue as a means of inflicting blunt force trauma through direct impact at ranges up to . 

The AR-2 munition consists of an aluminum canister which is intended to deploy a large quantity of pyrotechnic smoke along with a payload of chemical irritant in the form of micronized CS.

The AR-3 munition consists of a proprietary polymer baton which is intended to be deployed at living tissue as a means of inflicting blunt force trauma through direct impact at ranges up to Unlike the AR-1 munition, the AR-3 also contains a discrete payload of chemical irritant in the form of CS or OC powder which are intended to contaminate the target when struck.

The AR-4 munition consists of an aluminum canister which is intended to deploy a large quantity of pyrotechnic smoke suitable for screening purposes in a variety of colours.

The AR-5 munition consists of a composite plastic projectile which is intended to be fired at a physical obstruction such as a window, door or other barricade. The munition is designed to penetrate and pass through the obstruction at which time it deploys a payload of chemical irritant in the form of micronized CS or OC.

The AR-6 munition consists of either OC or CS chemical irritant powder which is immediately dispersed through the muzzle of the ARWEN when fired and designed to immediately contaminate an individual or area through blast dispersion.

<text>Steven Wallman is the former commissioner of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Wallman held this position from 1994 to 1997. He has also founded several companies, including Folio Financial, Inc. and Proxy Governance, Inc.

== Biography ==
Steven Wallman was sworn in as a commissioner of the SEC on July 5, 1994, having been appointed by Bill Clinton. Wallman previously was a partner at law firm Covington &amp; Burling. Wallman received a J.D. from Columbia University and a B.S. and M.S. from MIT.

In his time with the SEC, he fought for the &quot;decimalization&quot; of stock prices (i.e., using decimals instead of the then-standard fractions, e.g., $10.25 instead of $10¼) on the New York Stock Exchange, NASDAQ, and AMEX. After much testing and various pilot programs, the first day of decimalized stock prices took place on March 26, 2001.

Wallman is the founder of several companies, including Folio Financial, Inc. (acquired in 2020 by Goldman Sachs) and Proxy Governance, Inc.

In late September 2008, Wallman published a commentary in the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; to help solve the credit crisis without a bailout by using taxpayer-provided funds to make money available to homeowners who live in their homes (and not speculators) to stabilize housing.

Wallman&#x27;s plan is to provide financial institutions a government guarantee in lieu of any penalties or foreclosure to homeowners that have a mortgage in distress the current or missed payments under the mortgage. When a borrower agrees to have the government take over the mortgage payments, the mortgage company notify the government, then the government to make the payments, and the borrower would sign a note agreeing to repay the government with interest at the same rate currently required under the borrower&#x27;s mortgage.

In late September 2008, FOLIOfn released a media advisory that Wallman is available to comment on the proposed Proposed bailout of United States financial system.

Wallman currently serves on FINRA&#x27;s FinTech Industry Committee.
