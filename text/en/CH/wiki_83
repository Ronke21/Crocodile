<text>Peter Fintan Lalor (; 5 February 1827 – 9 February 1889) was an Irish-Australian rebel and, later, politician, who rose to fame for his leading role in the Eureka Rebellion, an event identified with the &quot;birth of democracy&quot; in Australia.

==Early life==
Lalor was born at Tenakill House, Raheen, in Queen&#x27;s County (later Laois) in Ireland, which was part of the United Kingdom at the time. He was the son of Ann (née Dillon) and Patrick &quot;Patt&quot; Lalor, a landowner and supporter of the abolition of tithes, who was a member of the British parliament (MP) in 1832–1835. Patt Lalor was the first Catholic MP from Queen&#x27;s County since the anti-Catholic Test Acts of the 17th century. He had 11 children: Joseph Lalor, James Fintan Lalor, Richard Lalor, Mary Lalor, Patrick Lalor, Thomas Lalor, Catherine Lalor, Margrett Ellen Lalor, Jerome Lalor, John Lalor and William A. Lalor Sr., of whom Peter was the youngest.

The eldest brother was James Fintan Lalor, who was later involved in the Young Ireland movement and the unsuccessful Young Irelander Rebellion of 1848. Another brother, Richard Lalor, also became a member of the British Parliament, representing the Parnellite nationalist party. Their mother died on 4 June 1835 and Patt Lalor later remarried, to Ellen Mary Anne Loughnan, with whom he had no children.

Peter Lalor was educated at Carlow College and trained as a civil engineer at Trinity College. Three of the Lalor brothers migrated to America and fought on both sides of the Civil War. However, Peter and his brother Richard decided to go to Australia, arriving in Victoria in October 1852. Lalor worked briefly on the construction of the Geelong to Melbourne railway, but resigned to take part in the Victorian Gold Rush.

He began mining in the Ovens diggings (Beechworth), then moved to the Eureka Lead at Ballarat where he befriended Duncan Gillies, who later became Premier of Victoria. His brother Richard returned to Ireland, becoming politically active and a member of the House of Commons.

==Events leading to the Eureka Stockade==
Agitation against the requirement to buy a monthly licence to mine for gold began with the Red Ribbon Movement at Bendigo in 1853, and was quickly taken up at Ballarat. A Reform League was formed amongst the diggers on the various goldfields for the redress of grievances. Provocatively, in October 1854, the Government ordered the police to go out hunting for unlicensed diggers two times a week.

In the later half of 1854, a digger named James Scobie was killed in a scuffle at the Eureka Hotel, on Specimen Hill. James Bentley, the hotel publican, was considered by the diggers to have participated in the murder. He and others were charged with murder and arrested, but were discharged after a trial that miners believed was corrupt.

An indignation meeting was held at Ballarat on 17 October, close to the spot where Scobie had been killed. At the meeting, a committee was appointed, which included Peter Lalor, to raise money for the further prosecution of Bentley. The goldfield authorities, fearing that the meeting might lead to an attack on Bentley&#x27;s hotel, sent police to guard it. A youth threw a stone at the lamp in front of the building, breaking the glass. That sparked cries of &quot;Down with the house&quot; and &quot;Burn it&quot;, and the angry mob stormed the hotel and set it on fire. Three people were arrested and charged with acts of incendiarism, tried, and imprisoned.

A mass meeting was held on Bakery Hill on 11 November 1854, to demand the release of the alleged incendiaries. It also passed resolutions affirming the right of the people to parliamentary representation, demanding manhood suffrage, the abolition of property qualification for members of parliament, the payment of members, short parliaments (the gap between elections), and the abolition of the Gold Commission and diggers&#x27; licenses. Bentley, in the meantime, had been re-arrested, on the advice of the Attorney-General William Stawell, for the murder of Scobie. He was convicted and sentenced to three years working on the roads.

On 29 November, a meeting of about 12,000 people was held at Ballarat. It is said to be the first public meeting that Lalor addressed, and he moved one of the resolutions which was passed. It called for a meeting of the Reform League for the following Sunday to elect a central committee. An &quot;insurgent flag&quot; was hoisted on the platform, which consisted of a representation of the Southern Cross constellation on a dark blue background. Another resolution passed at the meeting declared the miner&#x27;s license fee to be an unjustifiable imposition. A bonfire was soon kindled and many licences were burnt. At this meeting, the rebellion was formally inaugurated.

==Eureka Stockade==
Lalor led the miners&#x27; opposition against the incompetent and often brutal administration of the goldfields authorities, and was elected to lead the men in the armed uprising after the meeting on Bakery Hill. The diggers erected a protective stockade, which was overrun by troops and police on the morning of 3 December. Lalor was seriously wounded in the left arm, resulting in its amputation. A warrant for his arrest on charges of sedition was issued, but he was taken from Ballarat by his supporters and hid in the Young Queen Hotel in South Geelong. The warrant was withdrawn in June 1855 after juries had found 13 other ringleaders not guilty of sedition.

As a result of the uprising, a number of the miners&#x27; complaints were resolved. Legislation was passed to give miners the right to vote. A new form of licensing was introduced: a miner&#x27;s right, costing £1 per year. The monthly gold tax was abolished. A general amnesty for the three miners arrested after the Bentley&#x27;s Eureka Hotel fire and the 114 arrested at the Eureka Stockade was proclaimed.

===Lalor&#x27;s escape===
While the victors of Eureka were removing them alive from the stockade, Peter Lalor, the diggers&#x27; leader, lay under the pile of slabs in which he had been hidden, bleeding from the wound in his arm. A musket ball had shattered the bone close to the shoulder, and the few who knew where he was lying saw the blood trickling from beneath the pile of slabs even while the soldiers, keen to capture him, were still in the stockade. When the last of them had gone, Lalor was helped from his hiding place, put upon a white horse, and rode away through the bush towards Warrenheip. There he claimed shelter at the hut of a man he knew. The digger was absent, and his wife went to look for him. Lalor, however, doubted her genuineness, and believing that she had gone to communicate with the police, he took to the bush again for shelter. All that night he wandered about, with his crushed arm still swinging useless and unattended. He was greatly weakened from loss of blood, and only his indomitable pluck kept him up. Towards morning he determined to seek assistance from Stephen Cummins, an old friend whom he could trust, and who lived with his wife on Pennyweight Hill.

It was on the early morning of the Monday following the fight that Mrs. Cummins drew her husband&#x27;s attention to a man walking slowly between the holes on the flat, and said, &quot;That is Peter Lalor; I feel sure of it&quot;. &quot;As I ran down to help him&quot;, Steve Cummins told a friend, &quot;his face was grey and worried. He looked like a frail old man rather than a powerful young one, so greatly had pain and loss of blood during the 24 hours weakened him. I helped him into the hut, where as well as we could, my wife and I bandaged the wounded arm. I knew that my hut was no place for him. A reward of £200 had been offered for his arrest, and there were many mean spirits keen to earn it. Our friendship was well known, and I felt sure that sooner or later my place would be searched by the police. I ran at once across the gully to the Roman Catholic Presbytery and told Father Smyth that Lalor was in my tent badly wounded and in need of surgical assistance. I told him my fears as to the police visiting us, and Father Smyth said, &#x27;He will be safer here, I think. Bring him over after dark.&#x27; So that night we took him across to the presbytery, meeting, fortunately, not a soul upon the road.&quot; Steve Cummins&#x27;s intuition had served him well, for next night the police searched his hut, just at the time when he was watching Drs. Doyle and Stewart amputating Peter Lalor&#x27;s arm, for the severity of the wound and the delay in treating it precluded any possibility of the arm being saved. Through the ordeal of amputation, as in every other emergency of life, he showed that fine courage which nothing could shake!

A man employed about the Presbytery took the severed arm away as soon as the operation was over, and threw it down an abandoned shaft, but by Father Smyth&#x27;s orders it was recovered later and properly buried. The first operation was not complete. A portion of the bullet remained lodged in the stump of the arm, and it was only after a second operation at Geelong that the wound healed properly.

==Politics==

Due to the political changes caused by the Eureka Stockade, Lalor was elected to the Victorian Legislative Council in November 1855 as one of the two members for the new district of Ballaarat, and remained in that role until March 1856. At the general election in September and October 1856, under the new, more democratic constitution, which featured near-universal white male suffrage, Lalor was elected unopposed to the Legislative Assembly seat of North Grenville (Ballarat West). Because he was the Eureka hero, his policies were not scrutinised at all before the election and his later voting record as a parliamentarian shows he opposed a bill to introduce full white male suffrage in the colony of Victoria.

During a speech in the Legislative Council in 1856 he said, &quot;I would ask these gentlemen what they mean by the term &#x27;democracy&#x27;. Do they mean Chartism or Communism or Republicanism? If so, I never was, I am not now, nor do I ever intend to be a democrat. But if a democrat means opposition to a tyrannical press, a tyrannical people, or a tyrannical government, then I have been, I am still, and will ever remain a democrat.&quot;

Historian Weston Bate wrote that the role of landowner and company director seemed to suit Lalor more than that of rebel, and that he &quot;disgraced himself in democratic eyes&quot; by trying to use Chinese as strike-breakers at the Clunes mine, of which he was a director. Some argue that he was ruthless in using low-paid Chinese workers to get rid of Australians seeking better and safer working conditions. In parliament, he supported a repressive land Bill in 1857 which favoured the rich, and there were 17,745 Ballarat signatures to a petition against Lalor&#x27;s land Bill. Withers and others were puzzled and hurt that the folk hero should prove to be a better fighter for money and political position than for the people&#x27;s rights. Like many young radicals, he undoubtedly became more conservative in later life. However, he was consistent in being a risk-taker and, in his later business career, undoubtedly suffered lows as well as highs, at one point narrowly avoiding having to declare bankruptcy. Lalor held North Grenville until it was abolished in 1859, and never represented Ballarat again. In the October 1859 election, he stood for and won South Grant in the Legislative Assembly.

Lalor held South Grant for over eleven years, until the general election in 1871. At that election, he unsuccessfully contested the seat of North Melbourne. In the 1874 general election, he was elected in South Grant once again. At the 1877 election, he successfully contested the Legislative Assembly seat of Grant, which he held for almost twelve years, until his death in February 1889.

Lalor&#x27;s key ministerial postings were as Commissioner of Trade and Customs and Postmaster-General of Victoria from August to October 1875, then Commissioner of Trade and Customs from May 1877 until March 1880, as well as Postmaster-General again from May to July 1877. Lalor also served as chairman of committees in the period from 1859 to 1868.

As the successor to Sir Charles Gavan Duffy, his most effective political post was probably that of Speaker, a position he held from 1880 until 1887, when illness forced his retirement, after which he was awarded a pension of £4,000 by parliament.

==Later life and death==
Lalor married Alicia Dunne on 10 July 1855 in Geelong. Their daughter, Anne (Annie), was born in Prahran in 1856, and their son, Joseph, was born at Sandridge (now called Port Melbourne) on 18 December 1857. Annie Lalor married Thomas Lempriere in 1882, but died three years later of pulmonary phthisis. Joseph Lalor became a medical doctor, marrying Agnes McCormick of Dublin, Ireland and leaving descendants.

Alicia Lalor died on 17 May 1887 at the age of 55 years. Following her death, Peter Lalor took leave from Parliament and visited San Francisco, California.

Lalor died on Saturday, 9 February 1889 at age 62, four days after his birthday, at his son&#x27;s home in Richmond, and was buried at the Melbourne General Cemetery.

==Legacy==
A statue of Peter Lalor was erected at Sturt Street in Ballarat in 1893. It was presented to the municipality by a friend of Lalor&#x27;s, James Oddie, who was also first chairman of the city, and was unveiled by another friend, the Premier, the Hon Duncan Gillies.

The Melbourne suburb of Lalor, Victoria, was named after him in 1945. The suburb was originally pronounced &quot;LAW-luh&quot;, after Peter Lalor, and although many people still pronounce it as such, in recent times the pronunciation &quot;LAY-lor&quot; has become predominant.

Peter Lalor Vocational College (formerly Peter Lalor Secondary College), in the Lalor area, is named in his honour.

A federal electorate in the south-western suburbs of Melbourne, the Division of Lalor, was named after him in 1948. It has been held successively by senior Labor figures Reg Pollard, Jim Cairns, Barry Jones and Julia Gillard. The suburb of Lalor is not in the electorate, which is pronounced &quot;LAW-luh&quot;.

Lalor Street in Ballarat East was also named in his honour.

The University of Ballarat (now known as Federation University Australia) honoured Lalor by naming one of the two Halls of Residence at the Mt Helen campus after him (the other being named after Bella Guerin, the first woman to graduate from an Australian university).

Portrayals of Lalor&#x27;s role in the Eureka Rebellion appear in film.
The first film to have Lalor appear in is supposed to be &quot;Eureka Stockade&quot;, but only a seven-minute fragment of it has survived. In 1915, Lalor was portrayed by Leslie Victor in the silent film The Loyal Rebel, which is also considered lost.
Next, he was played by Chips Rafferty in the 1949 British film &quot;Eureka Stockade&quot; (released in United States of America under the title, &quot;Massacre Hill&quot;). He was played by Australian actor Bryan Brown in &quot;Eureka Stockade&quot;, a two-part television mini-series which aired on the Seven Network in 1984. The most recent film in which Lalor is portrayed was the Australian documentary &quot;Riot or Revolution: Eureka Stockade 1854&quot; (2006), with Lalor played by Andrew Larkins.

For further information about the various films depicting Peter Lalor, see: Eureka Rebellion in popular culture.

Since 1992, Lalor has been depicted in the commemorative Son et lumière &quot;Blood Under the Southern Cross&quot; at Sovereign Hill.

A caricature bollard by artist Jan Mitchell, depicting Peter Lalor holding the Eureka flag, was erected on the Geelong foreshore in 1999 as part of the Waterfront Geelong bollard walk.

His portrait is featured on two commemorative postage stamps, a 38c Irish stamp released on 3 May 2001 in the &quot;Rebel Spirit, Irish Heritage of Australia&quot; series, and a 2004 AUD2.45 Australian stamp commemorating the Eureka Stockade.

<text>Eastbourne Redoubt is a circular coastal defence fort at Eastbourne, East Sussex, on the south coast of England. It was built in 1805 as part of the British anti-invasion preparations during the Napoleonic Wars. The building is now owned by the local authority and is open to the public.

==Description==

The redoubt is a circular structure, measuring 224 feet (68 metres) in diameter and is built almost entirely of brick with some granite facing. The lower tier is composed of a ring of 24 casemates or vaulted chambers, which open into a central parade ground. Casemate 11 was the main magazine for the redoubt, casemate 8 was modified in the 1870s as a cook house and casemates 23 and 24 were altered in the 1880s to provide a detention room and two cells.

The upper tier above the casemates forms the terreplein or gun platform, which has a tall parapet pierced by granite-faced embrasures for eleven guns. Beside each gun position is an L-shaped expense magazine which held a supply of ammunition for the guns to use in combat and could also be used as a shelter for the gun crews during an enemy bombardment. The low roof of these magazines forms a banquette or fire step so that the garrison could fire their muskets over the parapet in the event of an infantry attack. The parapet is also pierced by the main gate, which was originally the only access to the redoubt.

The redoubt is surrounded by a ditch or dry moat which is 30 feet (9 metres) from the top of the parapet and 25 feet (7 metres) wide. On the far side of the moat, a glacis or earth ramp slopes away to ground level. Both the moat and the glacis have been removed on the seaward side during construction of a sea wall and promenade in 1890. The floor of the ditch is traversed by five caponiers or covered galleries with loopholes that allowed the defenders to fire at any attackers who had reached that point. These are unique in any of the circular redoubts and are thought to have been added in the mid-19th century. Access to the main gate of the redoubt is across a wooden drop bridge, which is a modern reconstruction of the original, built in 2003 with help from the Royal Engineers. A second entrance from the ditch was created in 1957 by inserting a large doorway through the scarp wall into one of the casemates.
==History==

===Origin===
The decision to build the redoubt was made at a conference held in Rochester on 21 October 1804, to discuss defence against Napoleon&#x27;s planned invasion of the United Kingdom, preparations for which were gaining momentum on the opposite side of the English Channel. The meeting, which was attended by the Prime Minister, William Pitt the Younger, agreed to adopt a revolutionary scheme to build a chain of mutually-supporting circular artillery towers along a stretch of the Channel coast where the French were thought to be most likely to land. The scheme had been devised by Captain William Henry Ford of the Royal Engineers and championed by Brigadier-General William Twiss who commanded the Royal Engineer Southern District. The original plan called for 83 Martello towers, each mounting a single heavy gun, at intervals along the coast and three 11-gun towers at Sea Houses (Eastbourne), Rye Harbour and Dymchurch. In the event, 74 Martello Towers were actually built and plans for the 11-gun tower at Rye were abandoned. The 11-gun towers, which came to be known as &quot;circular forts&quot; or &quot;grand redoubts&quot;, were intended to act as barracks and stores depots for the rest of the Martello chain, as well as formidable fortresses in their own right. A third redoubt was later constructed at Harwich in Essex to support the Martello chain built to defend the east coast; although broadly similar, it differs in some details from the south coast redoubts.
===Construction and the Napoleonic Wars===
The contract to build the redoubt at Eastbourne was awarded to William Hobson. Five million bricks were brought around the coast by barge from London for the project and others were made locally. Work started on 16 April 1805, but a report by Brigadier-General Twiss to the Board of Ordnance in May 1808 recommended that the money to settle Hobson&#x27;s account be withheld until all the work was completed. The structure was built on a raft of compacted chalk laid directly onto the natural shingle. It was constructed almost entirely of brick, over 50,000 being used in a single course. 

Cavities within the structure were filled with shingle. The redoubt was initially armed with 24-pounder guns on traversing carriages; although there are embrasures for 11 guns, only 10 appear to have been mounted. These were replaced shortly afterwards by longer ranged 36-pounder guns, after fears the redoubt could be bombarded at a distance by heavier French weapons. By the time that the redoubt had been fully armed and garrisoned, the likelihood of an invasion had become very remote and the guns were only fired in anger once; in 1812 two shots were fired at a passing French warship but missed.

===Later 19th-century developments===
By the 1830s, Europe was experiencing a long peaceful period and the garrison consisted of only seven gunners and a gate keeper, together with their families. The main role of the redoubt was as a barracks rather than a fortress, with troops being stationed there for a few weeks at a time while using nearby training facilities. Although it was intended for 350 men, it is thought unlikely that more than 200 could be accommodated at any one time. Despite this, the armament of the fort was progressively improved throughout the century. In 1853, the 36-pounders were replaced by 68-pounder smoothbore guns. In 1859, the Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom which had been set up by Lord Palmerston to review Britain&#x27;s fortifications, reported that the redoubts and Martello towers were &quot;not an important element of security against attack&quot;. Nevertheless, by 1873, the armament had been increased to four 8 inch rifled muzzle loaders and three 110-pounder rifled breech loaders, together with two of the older 68-pounders. Various improvements were made to the living conditions in the barracks including the addition of a cookhouse in the 1870s and a latrine outside the main gate in the 1880s.

===The World Wars and later===

During the First World War the military police used the redoubt as a headquarters and temporary gaol. Following this, Eastbourne Borough Council purchased the redoubt for £150 with the plan to turn it into a venue for leisure activities. The only part of the plan to be implemented was in 1934; the construction of a new bandstand in the gardens just to the west of the redoubt and an associated colonnade to shelter the audience, which was built over part of the moat. During the Second World War, the army requisitioned the building to use for storage. The remaining artillery pieces were sold for scrap. 

In 1944, anti-aircraft guns were mounted on the gun platforms to counter passing V-1 flying bombs. In 1957, the redoubt was leased to an entrepreneur named Benjamin White, who created a model village on the parade ground and constructed a new entrance from the moat, with a staircase that gives access from the promenade. The bandstand colonnade was converted into the Blue Grotto Aquarium, which was captured in 3D by VistaScreen. The model village was vandalised and then removed in the 1970s, and the aquarium closed in 1996.

== Access and events ==
The redoubt and cafe is open to the public between April and mid-November, every day from 10 am to 5 pm. Access to the gun platform and the parade ground is free. There is an admission charge to visit the inside of the fortress, which includes the regimental museums of the Queen&#x27;s Royal Irish Hussars and the Royal Sussex Regiment, with the Sussex Combined Services military collection. The fortress has an events programme, including films, lectures, tours, stargazing and ghost nights. It encourages families to visit, has permanent children&#x27;s area and through the school holidays runs daily events to keep children entertained.

<text>Luksusowa Vodka () is a brand of vodka from Poland that is distilled from potatoes. The Polish word &quot;luksusowa&quot; means &quot;luxury&quot;; thus in English-language markets, it is also referred to as &quot;Luksusowa Luxury Vodka&quot;.

Luksusowa has been in continuous production since 1928, making it one of the oldest Polish vodkas. When Poland&#x27;s boundaries were moved westward after World War II, Luksusowa&#x27;s production was moved to its current site in Zielona Góra. According to its producer, Luksusowa accounts for approximately 10% of Poland&#x27;s vodka market.

In 2010, W.J. Deutsch &amp; Sons, Ltd. became the exclusive United States importer for Luksusowa.

Luksusowa vodkas are currently available in these varieties:
* Clear (traditional)
* Black (50% alcohol by volume, compared to 40% in the other varieties)
* Citrus (lemon-flavored)
* Wild Berry (&quot;blackberries, raspberries, blueberries, cranberries, and a touch of wild cherry&quot;)

<doc id="1036088" wikidata="Q4867508" url="?curid=1036088" title="Basing House">
<text>Basing House was a Tudor palace and castle in the village of Old Basing in the English county of Hampshire. It once rivalled Hampton Court Palace in its size and opulence. Today only parts of the basement or lower ground floor, plus the foundations and earthworks, remain. The ruins are a Grade II listed building and a scheduled monument.

==History==
Basing House was built from 1531 as a new palace for William Paulet, 1st Marquess of Winchester, treasurer to King Edward VI, Queen Mary I and Queen Elizabeth I. The nearby &#x27;Great Barn&#x27; was completed in 1534, just before a visit from Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn.

In its final form, Basing House comprised two linked houses. The &quot;Old House&quot; replaced the keep of an older ringwork castle, so was located within a defensive ring of earthworks and walls, whilst the slightly later &quot;New House&quot; was located outside the defences. A bridge and gateway linked the two across and through the defences, a link that was to prove fatal in the final battle for the fortress. The &quot;New House&quot; &#x27;annex&#x27; in itself had approximately 360 rooms and was built primarily to accommodate the multitude of people that accompanied royalty when they visited.

Edward VI visited on 7 September 1552 and went on to Donnington Castle after three days. Elizabeth I came in August 1560 and so liked the house and entertainment that she said she would have married Lord Treasurer Paulet if he had been a younger man. She returned in August 1569. In September 1601 she entertained the French ambassador, the Duke de Biron, at the expense of the Marquess of Winchester. She hunted in the park with visiting French noblemen and killed 20 deer, and knighted 11 men. King James visited in August 1603. Anne of Denmark stayed in September 1603. There was dancing, and the elderly Earl of Nottingham was betrothed to the much younger Margaret Stewart.

On taking the title in February 1629, the 5th Marquess downsized, moved the family out and waited until returns from his extensive estates all over England allowed him to start restorations. For the first half of the 1630s, the house was closed and the windows boarded over after the family relocated to its other houses. The 4th Marquess&#x27;s entertainments almost bankrupted the family, maintenance of the house fell behind, and the design of such a large brick-built (and somewhat experimental) complex after one hundred years had its problems with dry and wet rot, broken windows, leaking roofs, and keeping the various wings heated.
At the time of the outbreak of the English Civil War in 1642, the 5th Marquess. John Paulet, was a supporter of King Charles I. As a consequence, parliamentary forces invested Basing House on three occasions, with the Royalists breaking the first two sieges.

The final siege started in August 1645 when Colonel John Dalbier, with 800 troops, took up position around the walls. The garrison held out, despite further reinforcements to the attacking force, until Oliver Cromwell arrived with a heavy siege-train. By 14 October 1645, the New House had been taken and the defences of the Old House breached. The final storming took place across the link from the New House. Many valuable goods were carried off, and a fire destroyed the building, as well as killing several priests who had taken refuge in the cellar. From the first firing of the guns, the assault was over in forty-five minutes, with the fires raging for up to nine hours after the event.

To send a message to other Royalist supporters, Cromwell returned to London and there was a Parliamentary decree issued that anyone could take from the estate, and therefore local villagers were encouraged to remove bricks from Basing House, and these materials were reused in homes in the surrounding area. While the local populace would sometimes be used to dismantle buildings, it was unusual to encourage them to make use of the materials. There is archaeological evidence that the materials of the house were arranged into types for systematic reclaim, rather than a &#x27;free-for-all&#x27;.

John Paulet had his estates confiscated and was sent to the Tower of London on a charge of high treason, which was later dropped, and the site of Basing House was returned to him by Charles II. His son Charles Paulet, 1st Duke of Bolton, became wealthy again as a consequence of his support for William of Orange during the Glorious Revolution. This wealth was used to demolish what was left of Basing House and to build nearby a new house at Hackwood that became the new seat of the Marquesses of Winchester (later titled also Dukes of Bolton) until 1794. The prior history of the area on which this house stands is unclear.

==Location==
Basing House is located in the village of Old Basing, approximately one mile east of the centre of the town of Basingstoke, in the north of the English county of Hampshire. The house is situated close to the upper reaches of the River Loddon. Operated and funded by Hampshire Cultural Trust since 2014, the extensive ruins and gardens are open to the public. Parts of the basement or lower ground floor remain, including the wine cellar, brick doorways and archways, bread ovens, salt alcoves, side rooms with surviving vaulted roofs, a vaulted tunnel, and even some original plaster and mortar. Access is by a riverside walk from a car park several hundred yards away. A UK Heritage Lottery Fund scheme has supported significant upgrades and renovations in recent years. The former Basingstoke Canal (1788-1910) ran around Basing House and through other parts of Old Basing.

<text>Taylor Graham (born June 3, 1980) is a former American soccer player.

==Career==

===Youth and college===
Graham attended Rio Americano High School and played five years of college soccer at Stanford University, registering as a walk-on his freshman year of 1998, and only appearing in two games in 1999. After appearing in 18 games his sophomore season, Graham started every possible game his final two, winning first team All-Pac-10 his senior year, as he led the Cardinal to an appearance in the NCAA College Cup.

===Professional===
After graduating from Stanford, Graham was drafted 33rd overall in the 2003 MLS SuperDraft by the Kansas City Wizards. Graham was signed to a developmental contract, making two appearances and playing a total of ten minutes. In his second season Graham was given significantly more playing time, playing as both a right back and central defender. After a season in the USL First Division when he played every minute for the Seattle Sounders, led his team to the title, and was named USL Defender of the Year, Graham was acquired by the MetroStars, now New York Red Bulls. He was released midway through the 2007 season and signed with his former club Seattle Sounders. He then signed with Seattle Sounders FC, a continuation of the Sounders in Major League Soccer. On May 26, 2010, he had his first appearance of the 2010 season in a friendly against Boca Juniors of Argentina, playing the full 90 minutes and putting up a solid performance.

Graham announced his retirement on December 2, 2011, after he was dropped from the roster by the Seattle Sounders.

===International===
Graham represented Puerto Rico in three international friendlies (including the team&#x27;s first win in 14 years) during early 2008. The national team coach Colin Clarke had misunderstood the requirements to play for Puerto Rican national side following a change to the eligibility criteria.

Previously, all U.S. citizens were eligible for Puerto Rico national teams, but now the player pool is restricted to players who have lived on the island for at least five years, meaning that Graham is no longer eligible for the Puerto Rico national team per federation rules.

<doc id="1036104" wikidata="Q2234359" url="?curid=1036104" title="Midge">
<text>A midge is any small fly, including species in several families of non-mosquito nematoceran Diptera. Midges are found (seasonally or otherwise) on practically every land area outside permanently arid deserts and the frigid zones. Some midges, such as many Phlebotominae (sand fly) and Simuliidae (black fly), are vectors of various diseases. Many others play useful roles as prey for insectivores, such as various frogs and swallows. Others are important as detritivores, and form part of various nutrient cycles. The habits of midges vary greatly from species to species, though within any particular family, midges commonly have similar ecological roles.

Examples of families that include species of midges include:

* Blephariceridae, net-winged midges
* Cecidomyiidae, gall midges
* Ceratopogonidae, biting midges (also known as no-see-ums or punkies in North America and sandflies in Australia)
* Chaoboridae, phantom midges
* Chironomidae, non-biting midges (also known as muckleheads, muffleheads or lake flies in the Great Lakes region of North America)
* Deuterophlebiidae, mountain midges
* Dixidae, meniscus midges
* Scatopsidae, dung midges 
* Thaumaleidae, solitary midges

== Examples ==

The Ceratopogonidae (biting midges) include serious blood-sucking pests, feeding both on humans and other mammals. Some of them spread the livestock diseases known as blue tongue and African horse sickness – other species though, are at least partly nectar feeders, and some even suck insect bodily fluids.

Many midges are known for having symbiotic relationships with many other organisms. These can be commensal, parasitic or mutualistic relationships. Many of the commensal relationships are found within the family Chironomidae.
Other ceratopogonid midges are major pollinators of &quot;Theobroma cacao&quot; (cocoa tree). Having natural pollinators has beneficial effects in both agricultural and biological products because it increases crop yield and also density of predators of the midges (still beneficial to all parties).
The term &quot;midge&quot; is a vague term that refers to a large and diverse group of organisms. Although many are known as &quot;bloodsuckers,&quot; there are many different roles that they play in their respective ecosystems. There is, for example, no objective basis for excluding the Psychodidae from the list, and some of them (or midge-like taxa commonly included in the family, such as &quot;Phlebotomus&quot;) are blood-sucking pests and disease vectors.

Most midges, apart from the gall midges (Cecidomyiidae), are aquatic during the larval stage. Some Cecidomyiidae (e.g., the Hessian fly) are considered significant pests of some plant species. The larvae of some Chironomidae contain hemoglobin and are sometimes referred to as bloodworms.

Non-biting midge flies are commonly considered a minor nuisance around bodies of water.

<text>Pat Garrett &amp; Billy the Kid is the twelfth studio album and first soundtrack album by American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, released on July 13, 1973, by Columbia Records for the Sam Peckinpah film &quot;Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid&quot;. Dylan himself appeared in the film as the character &quot;Alias&quot;. The soundtrack consists mainly of instrumental music and was inspired by the movie itself. The album includes &quot;Knockin&#x27; on Heaven&#x27;s Door&quot;, which became a trans-Atlantic Top 20 hit.

Certified gold by RIAA, &quot;Pat Garrett &amp; Billy the Kid&quot; reached in the US and in the UK.

==Filming of &quot;Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid&quot;==
&quot;Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid&quot; scriptwriter Rudy Wurlitzer was a previous acquaintance of Dylan&#x27;s, and asked him to provide a couple of songs for the movie. Dylan performed &quot;Billy&quot; for director Peckinpah, who found the performance very moving and offered Dylan an acting part on the spot. The role he ended up getting was a character named Alias. In November 1972, Dylan and his family moved to Durango, Mexico, where filming took place. Filming lasted from late 1972 to early 1973.

==Recording==
Dylan&#x27;s first session for the &quot;Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid&quot; soundtrack was on January 20, 1973 at CBS Discos Studios in Mexico City. The only song from that day that was included on the album was &quot;Billy 7&quot;; also recorded were multiple other takes of &quot;Billy&quot;, and the outtakes &quot;Under Turkey&quot;, &quot;Billy Surrenders&quot;, &quot;And He&#x27;s Killed Me Too&quot;, &quot;Goodbye Holly&quot; and &quot;Pecos Blues&quot;. The following month, Dylan recorded two days at Burbank Studios in Burbank, California. The rest of the album&#x27;s songs were recorded, as well as the outtakes &quot;Sweet Amarillo&quot; and &quot;Rock Me, Mama&quot;.

==Outtakes==
The Mexico City session produced three notable outtakes: &quot;Peco&#x27;s Blues&quot;, an instrumental based on the traditional &quot;What Does The Deep Sea Say?&quot;, the song &quot;Goodbye Holly&quot; and &quot;Billy Surrenders&quot;. All three tracks were rejected but eventually bootlegged and unofficially released as &quot;Peco&#x27;s Blues Pat Garrett &amp; Billy the Kid Outtakes&quot; in 1994. Of the 24 tracks written and performed by Bob Dylan on the bootleg album, only 10 were released on the final studio album. The remaining 14 songs have not been officially released.

=== Legacy ===
In February 1973, during the second of the Burbank sessions, Bob Dylan recorded 19 songs for the album. Among them were &quot;Sweet Amarillo&quot; and &quot;Rock Me, Mama&quot;. According to Ketch Secor of the Nashville band Old Crow Medicine Show, Bob Dylan attributed the lyrics of &quot;Rock Me, Mama&quot; to Arthur &quot;Big Boy&quot; Crudup who in turn attributed them to Big Bill Broonzy.

Both &quot;Rock Me, Mama&quot; and &quot;Sweet Amarillo&quot; were eventually completed and recorded by the Nashville band Old Crow Medicine Show, who credited Bob Dylan as co-writer. &quot;Wagon Wheel&quot; was released in 2004 (and subsequently covered by many other artists, including Darius Rucker) and &quot;Sweet Amarillo&quot; was released in 2014.

==Critical reception==

Most critics at the time responded unfavorably. Robert Christgau graded it a &quot;C&quot; in &quot;Creem&quot;, described the album as &quot;two middling Dylan songs, four good original Bobby voices, and a lot of Schmylan music&quot;. Jon Landau wrote in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that &quot;it is every bit as inept, amateurish and embarrassing as &quot;Self Portrait&quot;. And it has all the earmarks of a deliberate courting of commercial disaster, a flirtation that is apparently part of an attempt to free himself from previously imposed obligations derived from his audience.&quot;

The album spawned a significant hit in &quot;Knockin&#x27; on Heaven&#x27;s Door&quot;, which would be covered by acts such as Eric Clapton, Guns N&#x27; Roses and Warren Zevon.

==Legacy==
After Peckinpah completed his own cut of &quot;Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid&quot;, MGM re-cut the film without his input, removing several significant scenes and re-shuffling most of Dylan&#x27;s music in the process. Peckinpah&#x27;s film was released to mixed reviews. Years later, critical re-evaluation of Peckinpah&#x27;s film would lead many to regard it as one of his major works, a revisionist view aided by the restoration of Peckinpah&#x27;s original cut in 1984.

After witnessing firsthand Peckinpah&#x27;s battles with MGM, Dylan had his own problems with Columbia Records. After years of minimal activity, Dylan had lost Columbia&#x27;s patience, and when negotiations for a renewed contract began in 1972, the label (except for Clive Davis) had little interest in being generous. &quot;Early in 1973 I finally did conclude negotiations for a new contract with Bob,&quot; wrote Clive Davis in his autobiography. Davis had been a longtime supporter of Dylan&#x27;s, but he had been the victim of a corporate coup. While finalizing the details of Dylan&#x27;s contract, Davis was fired by CBS president Arthur Taylor on May 29. Dylan testified on Davis&#x27;s behalf in a well-publicized civil trial held in July 1975. In the meantime, the incident soured Dylan&#x27;s relationship with CBS, convincing him to sign with David Geffen&#x27;s fledgling Los Angeles-based label Asylum Records.

<text>Flash mob computing or flash mob computer is a temporary &quot;ad hoc&quot; computer cluster running specific software to coordinate the individual computers into one single supercomputer. A flash mob computer is distinct from other types of computer clusters in that it is set up and broken down on the same day or during a similar brief amount of time and involves many independent owners of computers coming together at a central physical location to work on a specific problem and/or social event.

Flash mob computer derives its name from the more general term flash mob which can mean any activity involving many people co-ordinated through virtual communities coming together for brief periods of time for a specific task or event. Flash mob computing is a more specific type of flash mob for the purpose of bringing people and their computers together to work on a single task or event.

==History==
The first flash mob computer was created on April 3, 2004 at the University of San Francisco using software written at USF called FlashMob (not to be confused with the more general term flash mob).

The event, called FlashMob I, was a success. There was a call for computers on the computer news website Slashdot. An article in The New York Times &quot;Hey, Gang, Let’s Make Our Own Supercomputer&quot; brought a lot of attention to the effort. More than 700 computers were brought to the gym at the University of San Francisco, and were wired to a network donated by Foundry Networks.

At FlashMob I the participants were able to run a benchmark on 256 of the computers, and achieved a peak rate of 180 Gflops (billions of calculations per second), though this computation stopped three quarters of the way due to a node failure.

The best, complete run used 150 computers and resulted in 77 Gflops. FlashMob I was run off a bootable CD-ROM that ran a copy of Morphix Linux, which was only available for the x86 platform.

Despite these efforts, the project was unable to achieve its original goal of running a cluster momentarily fast enough to enter the (November 2003) Top 500 list of supercomputers. The system would have had to provide at least 402.5 Gflops to match a Chinese cluster of 256 Intel Xeon nodes. For comparison, the fastest super computer at the time, Earth Simulator, provided 35,860 Gflops.

== Creators of flash mob computing ==

Pat Miller was a research scientist at a national lab and adjunct professor at USF. His class on Do-It-Yourself Supercomputers evolved into FlashMob I from the original idea of every student bringing a commodity CPU or an Xbox to class to make an evanescent cluster at each meeting. Pat worked on all aspects of the FlashMob software. 

Greg Benson, USF Associate Professor of Computer Science, invented the name &quot;flash mob computing&quot;, and proposed the first idea of wireless flash mob computers. Greg worked on the core infrastructure of the FlashMob run time environment. 

John Witchel (Stuyvesant High School &#x27;86) was a USF graduate student in computer science during 2004. After talking to Greg about the challenges of networking a stadium of wireless computers and listening to Pat lecture on what it takes to break the Top 500, John asked, &quot;Couldn&#x27;t we just invite people off the street and get enough power to break the Top 500?&quot; FlashMob I and the FlashMob software was John&#x27;s master&#x27;s thesis.

<doc id="1036108" wikidata="Q515069" url="?curid=1036108" title="Hadda, Afghanistan">
<text>Haḍḍa () is a Greco-Buddhist archeological site located ten kilometers south of the city of Jalalabad, in the Nangarhar Province of eastern Afghanistan.

Hadda is said to have been almost entirely destroyed in the fighting during the civil war in Afghanistan.

==Background==
Some 23,000 Greco-Buddhist sculptures, both clay and plaster, were excavated in Hadda during the 1930s and the 1970s. The findings combine elements of Buddhism and Hellenism in an almost perfect Hellenistic style.

Although the style of the artifacts is typical of the late Hellenistic 2nd or 1st century BCE, the Hadda sculptures are usually dated (although with some uncertainty), to the 1st century CE or later (i.e. one or two centuries afterward). This discrepancy might be explained by a preservation of late Hellenistic styles for a few centuries in this part of the world. However it is possible that the artifacts actually were produced in the late Hellenistic period.

Given the antiquity of these sculptures and a technical refinement indicative of artists fully conversant with all the aspects of Greek sculpture, it has been suggested that Greek communities were directly involved in these realizations, and that &quot;the area might be the cradle of incipient Buddhist sculpture in Indo-Greek style&quot;.

The style of many of the works at Hadda is highly Hellenistic, and can be compared to sculptures found at the Temple of Apollo in Bassae, Greece.

The toponym Hadda has its origins in Sanskrit haḍḍa n. m., &quot;a bone&quot;, or, an unrecorded *haḍḍaka, adj., &quot;(place) of bones&quot;. The former - if not a fossilized form - would have given rise to a Haḍḍ in the subsequent vernaculars of northern India (and in the Old Indic loans in modern Pashto). The latter would have given rise to the form &quot;Haḍḍa&quot; naturally and would well reflect the belief that Hadda housed a bone-relic of Buddha. The term haḍḍa is found as a loan in Pashto haḍḍ, n., id. and may reflect the linguistic influence of the original pre-Islamic population of the area.

==Buddhist scriptures==

It is believed the oldest surviving Buddhist manuscripts-indeed the oldest surviving Indian manuscripts of any kind-were recovered around Hadda. Probably dating from around the 1st century CE, they were written on bark in Gandhari using the Kharoṣṭhī script, and were unearthed in a clay pot bearing an inscription in the same language and script. They are part of the long-lost canon of the Sarvastivadin Sect that dominated Gandhara and was instrumental in Buddhism&#x27;s spread into central and east Asia via the Silk Road. The manuscripts are now in the possession of the British Library.

==Tapa Shotor monastery (2nd century CE)==
Tapa Shotor was a large Sarvastivadin Buddhist monastery. According to archaeologist Raymond Allchin, the site of Tapa Shotor suggests that the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhara descended directly from the art of Hellenistic Bactria, as seen in Ai-Khanoum.

The earliest structures at Tapa Shotor (labelled &quot;Tapa Shotor I&quot; by archaeologists) date to the Indo-Scythian king Azes II (35-12 BCE).

A sculptural group excavated at the Hadda site of Tapa-i-Shotor represents Buddha surrounded by perfectly Hellenistic Herakles and Tyche holding a cornucopia. The only adaptation of the Greek iconography is that Herakles holds the thunderbolt of Vajrapani rather than his usual club.

According to Tarzi, Tapa Shotor, with clay sculptures dated to the 2nd century CE, represents the &quot;missing link&quot; between the Hellenistic art of Bactria, and the later stucco sculptures found at Hadda, usually dated to the 3rd-4th century CE. The scultptures of Tapa Shortor are also contemporary with many of the early Buddhist sculptures found in Gandhara.

==Chakhil-i-Ghoundi monastery (2nd-3rd century CE)==

The Chakhil-i-Ghoundi monastery is dated to the 4th-5th century CE. It is built around the Chakhil-i-Ghoundi Stupa, a small limestone stupa. Most of the remains of the stupa were gathered in 1928 by the archeological mission of Frenchman Jules Barthoux of the French Archaeological Delegation in Afghanistan, and have been preserved and reconstituted through a collaboration with the Tokyo National Museum. They are today on display at the Musée Guimet in Paris. It is usually dated to the 2nd-3rd century CE.

The decoration of the stupa provides an interesting case of Greco-Buddhist art, combining Hellenistic and Indian artistic elements. The reconstitution consists of several parts, the decorated stupa base, the canopy, and various decorative elements.

==Tapa Kalan monastery (4th-5th century CE)==

The Tapa Kalan monastery is dated to the 4th-5th century CE. It was excavated by Jules Barthoux.

One of its most famous artifact is an attendant to the Buddha who display manifest Hellenistic styles, the &quot;Genie au Fleur&quot;, today in Paris at the Guimet Museum.

==Bagh-Gai monastery (3rd-4th century CE)==
The Bagh-Gai monastery is generally dated to the 3rd-4th century CE. Bagh-Gai has many small stupas with decorated niches.

==Tapa-i Kafariha Monastery (3rd-4th century CE)==

The Tapa-i Kafariha Monastery is generally dated to the 3rd-4th century CE. It was excavated in 1926–27 by an expedition led by Jules Barthoux as part of the French Archaeological Delegation to Afghanistan.

==Tapa Tope Kalān monastery (5th century CE)==
This large stupa is about 200 meters to the northeast of the modern city of Hadda. Masson called it &quot;Tope Kalān&quot; (Hadda 10), Barthoux &quot;Borj-i Kafarihā&quot;, and it is now designated as &quot;Tapa Tope Kalān&quot;.

The stupa at Tope Kalan contained deposits of over 200 mainly silver coins, dating to the 4th-5th century CE. The coins included Sasanian issues of Varhran IV (388–399 CE), Yazdagird II (438–457 CE) and Peroz I (457/9–84 CE). There were also five Roman gold solidi: Theodosius II (408–50 CE), Marcianus (450–457 CE) and Leo I (457–474 CE). Many coins were also Hunnic imitations of Sasanian coins with the addition of the Alkhon tamgha, and 14 Alkhon coins with rulers showing of their characteristic elongated skulls. All these coins point to a mid-late 5th century date for the stupa.

However, the team changed direction under new coach Colin Clarke and the acquisition of Simo Valakari relegated Stone primarily to a substitute role. Stone announced his retirement from professional soccer on 25 October 2004, in order to pursue a college degree at Texas Tech University.

==International soccer career==
Stone saw significant playing time for the Youth council team in Africa U.S. national teams, playing in the 1999 FIFA U-17 World Championship, and playing an important role for the US Under-20 team, playing in the 2003 FIFA World Youth Championship.

<doc id="1036116" wikidata="Q532555" url="?curid=1036116" title="Trenčianske Teplice">
<text>Trenčianske Teplice (; ) is a health resort and small spa town in western Slovakia, in the valley of the river Teplička, at the foothills of the Strážovské vrchy mountains, a few kilometres away from the city of Trenčín.

==Characteristics==
The town of Trenčianske Teplice is known not only for its thermal springs and the health resorts, but also for an international film festival Art film and the Bridge of Fame. Not far from the town is also a small village Motešice, known very well for horse-breeding farm and horse racing. &#x27;Green Frog&#x27; is a name for sport/recreational complex, very popular by locals, which was renovated and reopened in 2015.

==Legend==
A legend says that the healing springs were discovered by a gammy shepherd while he was looking for a lost sheep. He found a small hot water pool with a sulphuric smell and after several days, he recovered.

==History==
In the middle of the 13th century as &quot;terra Teplicza&quot; it was property of the Cseszneky de Milvány family. It has been a spa site since the 14th century. As early as the 16th century, the spa was known all over Europe, and was mentioned as the most important of the Kingdom of Hungary. The spa was owned by the Illésházy, an aristocratic family of the Kingdom of Hungary, from 1582 onwards. In 1835, it was bought by the Viennese financier Jozef Sina, who developed the area. The spa was nationalised after the Second World War.

==Bridge of Fame==
What does make bridges famous? Might be architects, builders, location, size or shape. The Bridge of Fame in Trenčianske Teplice is different. The bridge is located in small town, overarching a small river, but known by whole country. Bridge of Fame is the place where a plate dedicated to the top guest of the biggest film festival in Slovakia is added. The festival was held in Trenčianske Teplice since 1993 (until 2015), Artfilm. The plates given here to date include those dedicated to Sophia Loren, Gina Lollobrigida, Franco Nero, Ornella Muti, as well as exceptional Slovak film actors and actress as: Jozef Kroner or Emília Vášáryová.

==Artfilm==
Film festival Art Film Fest was held for first time 1993, the year when &quot;Slovak republic&quot; was founded. Artfilm is the longest active international film related festival in Slovakia. The festival was founded by &quot;Peter Hledik&quot;, who is also the director. As Mr. Hledik said, the reason for founding the festival was affected by the time, early 90s. The time when film studios in Slovakia had significant financial problems and they stopped filming. Artfilm wanted to replace live cinematography. The first years of the festival begins 14 June 1993 in Trenčianske Teplice with &quot;UNESCO&quot; support. It was a small review of documentary movies in one cinema hall for just 200 people.
By the time, festival has been growing and has become one of the most iconic cultural events in Slovakia. While in 1993 the festival welcomed just 300 visitors, in 2009 it was 25 000 visitors. 
Because of the growing tendency, in 2016, the event was moved from small town of Trenčianske Teplice to the second biggest city in Slovakia Košice.

==Carpathian Jewel==
Long before the era of the successful film festival was kicked off, Trenčianske Teplice, became famous as a spa resort. The town is nested amid lovely nature in the Teplicka Valley, and thanks to the exceptional location and the healing springs it was given a Romanic attribute – &#x27;Carpatian Jewel&#x27;. When lords of Trenčin Castle learned about this natural jewel in the past, they discovered that it&#x27;s worth not only being protected, but also aggrandised. Palatine Štefan Zápoľský in the 16th century laid the foundation stone of what later became the spa resort area. The spa is open year-round, and is visited by people looking for a cure for diseases of locomotive organs and nervous system. The resort lies in an ideal natural environment, protected against wind and enjoying many sunny days. Traditional curative methods have been marvellously joined by the modern methods of comprehensive balneotherapy. This features the use of curative effects of thermal mineral springs along with wonderful healing effects of mineralised mud. Thermal water rises from the depth of around 1200 meters, and before it comes out on the surface, it flows through limy soil and layers of magnesium, which results in its intense mineralization and warming. Besides enjoying the beneficial effects of the healing springs, visitors to the spa have a chance to admire an interesting architecture of the own of Trenčianske Teplice. The most popular is a bath called hammam, which can be taken in a spa house called Sina]. The house is decorated in an Oriental (Arabic/Moorish) style of late 19th century. The surroundings of the spa houses are glamorised by a Romantic English park with a small pond.

A hydroelectric power station (it was producing polyphase AC of 5250 V) was built between 1886 and 1888 and supplied the town&#x27;s streetlights as well as surrounding communities (Trenčianska Teplá, Košeca, Ladce) with electricity. It also powered a special narrow-gauged public electric railway opened on 29 July 1909. The railway has a length of and connects Trenčianske Teplice with a railway junction at Trenčianska Teplá. Regular service on the railway was discontinued, seasonal trains still operate.

==Sport==
Slovak Bandy Association has its seat in Trenčianske Teplice.

==Demographics==
According to the 2001 census, the town had 4,438 inhabitants. 96.6% of inhabitants were Slovaks, 1.7% Czechs and 0.2% Hungarians. The religious makeup was 77.7% Roman Catholics, 13.6% people with no religious affiliation, and 4.6% Lutherans.

<doc id="1036128" wikidata="Q469919" url="?curid=1036128" title="Bhairon Singh Shekhawat">
<text>Bhairon Singh Shekhawat (23 October 1923 – 15 May 2010) was an Indian politician who served as the vice president of India. He served in that position from August 2002, when he was elected to a five-year term by the electoral college following the death of Krishan Kant, until he resigned on 21 July 2007, after losing the presidential election to Pratibha Patil. Bhairon Singh Shekhawat was a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party. He served as the Chief Minister of Rajasthan three times, from 1977 to 1980, 1990 to 1992 and 1993 to 1998. He represented several constituencies in Rajasthan Vidhan Sabha from 1952 to 2002. He was awarded Padma Bhushan in the year 2003.

== Early life ==
He was born in 1923 to a Rajput family in the village of Khachriyawas, then in Sikar district, Rajputana Agency, British India. His father Devi Singh was a farmer of the village and his mother, Bane Kanwar was a housewife. He was very good in studies and completed high school but was unable to complete college due to his father&#x27;s death. He had to support his family. He worked as a farmer and an officer sub-inspector of police. After working in Police Department for few years he saw his interest in the politics and joined Bharatiya Jana Sangh in 1950. In the year 1952, he resigned from the position of Police Inspector to contest Elections in Rajasthan Legislative Assembly.

== Legacy ==
Referred to as &quot;Rajasthan Ka Ek Hi Singh&quot; (The only lion of Rajasthan) or &quot;Babosa&quot; (Head of the family of Rajasthan) and affectionately as Bhairon Baba, Bhairon Singh Shekhawat entered politics in 1952. In 1952 he was MLA from Ramgarh, in 1957 from Sri Madhopur, 1962 and 1967 he was MLA from Kisan Pol. In 1972 elections he lost but in 1973 he was elected to Rajya Sabha from Madhya Pradesh. In 1975 during emergency he was arrested and sent to Rohtak jail. He remains the only Non-Congress politician to be the Chief minister of Rajasthan 3 times and was the first Vice President of India from BJP.

== Political career ==

=== Janata Party ===
After emergency in 1977 he became MLA from Chhabra as Janata Party candidate. In that year the Janata Party won 151 of the 200 seats in the state assembly elections of Rajasthan and Shekhawat took over as the first non Congress Chief Minister of Rajasthan in 1977. His government was dismissed by Indira Gandhi in 1980.

=== Bharatiya Janata Party ===
In 1980, Shekhawat joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and became MLA again from Chabda and was leader of opposition. In 1985, he was MLA from Nimbahera. However, in 1989 an alliance between the BJP and the Janata Dal won all 25 of the Rajasthan seats in the Lok Sabha and also 138 seats (BJP:84+Janata Dal:54) in the 1990 elections to the Ninth Rajasthan Legislative Assembly. Shekhawat once again became Chief Minister of Rajasthan and was MLA from Dholpur. His government was dismissed in 1992 and President&#x27;s rule imposed.

In the next elections, in 1993, Shekhawat led the BJP to be the single largest party, winning 96 seats. He himself contested from two seats, becoming MLA from Bali, but he lost from Ganganagar seat where he finished third and Congress candidate Radheshyam Ganganagar won. Three BJP-supported independents also won seats and other independents who supported the BJP took its total to 116. And Shekhawat became Chief Minister of Rajasthan for third time.

In 1998, Shekhawat was elected from Bali again but the BJP lost power and Shekhawat became Leader of Opposition in the legislative assembly. Shekhawat won every election to the Rajasthan Legislative Assembly, except in 1972 when he lost from Gandhi Nagar in Jaipur, and in Ganganagar he lost in 1993 and Congress leader Radheshyam Ganganagar won.

In the 1999 general elections, he had recommended the BJP to give Prem Singh Rathore from Hyderabad, a close friend a ticket from Maharajganj (now goshamahal) and helped him win his elections and established strong BJP presence in North Andhra Region. Shekhawat also helped Rathore in his daughters marriage by fixing the marriage with a relative.

Shekhawat was elected as the Vice-President of India in 2002, when he defeated the opposition candidate, Sushil Kumar Shinde by a margin of 149 votes out of the 750 votes polled.

In July 2007, Shekhawat fought the presidential election as an independent candidate backed by National Democratic Alliance as a popular presidential candidate next to A. P. J. Abdul Kalam; but lost to the United Progressive Alliance-Left backed candidate Pratibha Patil. He became the first vice-president to lose presidential election. Following this defeat, Shekhawat resigned from the post of vice-president on 21 July 2007.

== Notable Policies ==

=== Against Sati Pratha ===
Shekhawat played the most crucial role in removing Sati (practice) from Rajasthan as a part of their culture, especially among Rajput community, to which he belonged. At the time of 1987 when an 18 years old girl &#x27;Roop Kanwar&#x27; was burnt as Sati, then the matter came in controversy. Then at that time without thinking about his votebank, he put a total ban on this practice.

=== Antyoday Yojna ===
Shekhawat started the &quot;Antyoday Yojna&quot; scheme, which was intended to uplift the poorest of the poor. The chairman of the World Bank, Robert McNamara, referred to him as the Rockefeller of India.

=== Powerful Administration ===
Shekhawat was also known for his control over bureaucracy and the police. He had involvement in policies designed to improve literacy and industrialisation in Rajasthan, as well as tourism centred on the themes of heritage, wildlife and villages. He was also lauded by both, national and international leaders for his historic conduct of the Rajya Sabha.

== Death ==
Bhairon Singh Shekhawat succumbed to cancer and other related health problems, and died on 15 May 2010 at the Sawai Man Singh Hospital in Jaipur. He was cremated the next day, at a plot of land provided by the government of Rajasthan, where his memorial is now built. His funeral was attended by thousands of people. He was survived by his wife, Suraj Kanwar and his only daughter, Ratan Rajvi who is married to BJP leader Narpat Singh Rajvi.

His wife, Suraj Kanwar (1927–2013), died on 9 March 2013 at the age of 86, after outliving her husband by two to three years and was cremated at Shekhawat&#x27;s memorial as per her last wish.

<text>Natural American Spirit, often referred to simply as American Spirit, is an American brand of cigarettes and other tobacco products, currently owned by Reynolds American and manufactured by the Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Company.

==History==
The company was founded in 1982 by Bill Drake, author of &quot;The Cultivator&#x27;s Handbook of Natural Tobacco&quot;; Robert Marion, an acupuncture student at the Kototama Institute in Santa Fe; and Chris Webster, a Santa Fe entrepreneur and realtor. Startup investments came from Edward Wikes, a Santa Fe plumber/contractor who took out a loan to support the venture; Robert Wolf, an oil rig roughneck; and Philip Naumburg, an heir to the Elkan Naumburg fortune. In January 2002, the company was acquired by Reynolds American and is now a wholly owned independent subsidiary of Reynolds American, which is in turn owned by British American Tobacco. Japan Tobacco announced in September 2015 that it acquired the right to sell Natural American Spirit products in markets outside the United States.

==Markets==
Natural American Spirit cigarettes have been sold in the United States, Canada, Netherlands, Brazil, United Kingdom, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Tunisia, Japan, Spain, Italy, France, Greece, Finland and Denmark.

==Products==
Natural American Spirit offers various types of select filter cigarettes which are color-coded to denote the nicotine and tar contents, which are altered by using different filters and cigarette paper. American Spirit also has a &quot;Perique Blend Filter cigarette&quot;, which contains 10% Perique tobacco, and an &quot;Organic Filter cigarette&quot;, which contains organic tobacco.

Natural American Spirit also offers several &quot;Roll Your Own&quot; tobaccos in tins and pouches.

In the UK, American Spirit rolling tobacco comes in Blue (regular) or Yellow (light).

American Spirit cigarettes are sold in packs of 20. They come as follows:
*Orange – Smooth Mellow Original Taste
*Yellow – Original Blend Mellow Original Taste
*Blue – Original Blend Full-bodied Taste
*Light Green – Organic Mellow Menthol
*Dark Green – Organic Full-Bodied Menthol
*Gold – Organic Mellow Taste
*Turquoise – Organic Full-Bodied Taste
*Black – Perique Rich Robust Taste 
*Light Blue – Full-Bodied Taste
*Dark Blue – U.S. Grown Premium Full-Bodied Taste
*Tan – U.S. Grown Premium Mellow Taste
*Sky – Smooth Taste, charcoal filter
*Celadon Green – Unique Balanced Taste
*Hunter Green – Full-Bodied Balanced Taste
*Gray – Perique Rich Taste
*Agate (Japan Only) – Rich Sweet Taste
*Brown – Unique Non-Filtered

==Controversies==
===The claim of additive-free cigarettes===
Natural American Spirit products in the year 2000 were advertised as &quot;100% Additive-Free Tobacco&quot;.

California Attorney General Jerry Brown announced on March 1, 2010, that his office had secured an agreement with the Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Company to clearly disclose that its organic tobacco is &quot;no safer or healthier&quot; than other tobacco products. Attorneys general from 32 other states and the District of Columbia signed onto the agreement.

===Use of Native American imagery===
The use of Native American/American Indian imagery by the brand, such as the depiction of an Indigenous person on the package and the use of fake folktales, has been criticized as cultural appropriation and promoting stereotypes. Research found that the use of this imagery led to many smokers, including Indigenous peoples, having the misperception that the brand was owned or operated by a tribe/on tribal land and that it was more &quot;natural&quot; and thus healthier. In response, Robin Sommers, the CEO and majority owner of Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Company, stated that &quot;Native Americans are not a target market for American Spirit&quot;, stating that the use of this imagery was due to the company&#x27;s goal to bring tobacco usage more in line with a perceived &quot;moderation&quot; by Indigenous peoples in the 15th century and that proceeds from sales support Native communities.

<doc id="1036137" wikidata="Q1165451" url="?curid=1036137" title="Alan Gordon (soccer)">
<text>Alan Gordon (born October 16, 1981) is an American former professional soccer player. In the majority of his career, Gordon was mostly relied upon to make goals in game as a Super–sub.

==Youth and college career==

Gordon moved to Gilbert, Arizona in his mid-teens, and played two years of college soccer for Yavapai College, where he scored 39 goals in his two seasons, before a transfer to Oregon State University, where he won All-Pac-10 honors twice and scored 11 goals as a junior and 15 as a senior. Gordon scored 40 goals and 7 assists for the Oregon State Beavers, setting several program records.

==Club career==

===2004–2010===

Upon graduating, Gordon was drafted 53rd overall in the 2004 MLS SuperDraft&#x27;s sixth round by Los Angeles Galaxy, but was not signed by the team. He signed with the Portland Timbers of the A-League and had a successful season, ending the regular season with 17 goals in 27 matches to tie Dante Washington for the league lead. Gordon was named the A-League Rookie of the Year and was a finalist for the MVP Award, having helped Portland to a first-place finish in the regular season. He was loaned back to the Galaxy, where he occupied a developmental roster slot, and made his MLS debut on September 25, 2004, as a substitute for Carlos Ruiz. Gordon earned a spot in the starting lineup for 2005, but only played in five matches due to reoccurring injuries, including a strained hip and groin early in the season.

He returned to the starting lineup during the 2006 season and scored his first MLS goal on August 26 against D.C. United. Gordon then scored twice the following week in a home match against the Kansas City Wizards and ended the season with four goals in league play. He scored three goals in the Galaxy&#x27;s 2007 SuperLiga campaign, which ended with a second-place finish. During a friendly with Chelsea, Gordon was substituted for David Beckham&#x27;s debut with the Galaxy. For much of the 2007 season, he was a third-string forward and also coached a girls youth team to supplement his MLS salary.

On April 26, 2008, Gordon scored two goals off the bench in the Galaxy&#x27;s 5–2 victory over rivals Chivas USA. He finished 2008 with a career year. He scored five goals and seven assists, even though he was not a full-time starter.

===2010–2018===

In August 2010, he was traded to neighboring Chivas USA for allocation money just one match short of his 100 league appearances with the Galaxy, during which time he notched 16 goals. Following the 2010 season, he was selected by Vancouver Whitecaps FC in the 2010 MLS Expansion Draft, but was immediately traded back to Chivas USA, along with Alejandro Moreno, for allocation money and an international roster spot.

He was traded to Toronto FC ahead of the 2011 season in exchange for Nick LaBrocca. Gordon made his debut for Toronto on March 26 in a 2–0 home victory against Portland Timbers with both goals coming from Javier Martina. On April 2 Gordon scored his first goal for Toronto in a 1–1 tie against his former team Chivas. Gordon had a memorable return to The Home Depot Center on June 11 when he scored two goals against The Galaxy in a 2–2 thriller which saw two goals scored in injury time of the second half.

Following Toronto&#x27;s designated player signing of Danny Koevermans, Gordon became a dispensable asset and was traded along with Jacob Peterson and Nana Attakora to the San Jose Earthquakes for Ryan Johnson, allocation money, and an international roster spot in July 2011. Gordon signed a new contract with San Jose in January 2012 and reunited with former Galaxy head coach Frank Yallop. Alan Gordon had a career best of 13 goals in 23 appearances with the Earthquakes that year, primarily as a late substitute alongside Chris Wondolowski and Steven Lenhart.

In April 2013, during a match with the Portland Timbers, Gordon was caught on camera using the word &quot;faggot&quot; in reference to Portland midfielder Will Johnson. Gordon was suspended for three matches following the incident, in addition to the one-match ban he received for drawing a red card in the 78th minute of the same match.

Gordon returned once again to Los Angeles when San Jose traded him to the Galaxy in August 2014 in exchange for allocation money. Gordon ended the season scoring five goals, four of them from off the bench.

Prior to the 2017 MLS season, Gordon announced that he would join the Colorado Rapids on a free agent deal.

On March 16, 2018, Gordon joined MLS side Chicago Fire. On October 28, 2018, Gordon announced that he would retire from playing professional soccer after their final game of the season against D.C. United.

==International career==
Gordon earned his first call-up to the United States men&#x27;s national soccer team in August 2012 in advance of a friendly match against Mexico. Gordon was again called up in October 2012 to prepare for the final two matches in the semifinal round of qualifying for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. He made his first international appearance on October 12, 2012, as a substitute against Antigua and Barbuda, where he provided a critical assist to Eddie Johnson, who scored a 90th minute game-winning goal.

He was called into the squad for the 2013 Gold Cup, after the U.S. advanced to the knockout stages. He did not play, however, as the U.S. won the tournament.

He was also called into the squad for the 2015 Gold Cup, after the U.S. advanced to the knockout rounds, replacing Jozy Altidore, who was still trying to recover from an injury. He came on as a late substitute for Aron Johannsson in the U.S. 2–1 loss the Jamaica in the semifinals but failed to make an impact.

<text>Joey DiPaolo (born September 5, 1979) is an American AIDS activist who is HIV positive.

DiPaolo contracted HIV during a heart surgery in 1984. He required a blood transfusion, and the blood given to him came from an HIV-infected donor. DiPaolo had been diagnosed with a heart disease, atrial septal defect, and surgery was needed to save his life.

From 1985 to 1988, DiPaolo went through several episodes of sickness although none heart-related. In 1988, DiPaolo was diagnosed with HIV. At the time, doctors gave him one year to live and told his family that it would be best for them to hide his condition. Instead, DiPaolo became very active in school and, with the help of medicines, saw his health improve in 1989 to the point that he was able to live a typical life.

In early 1990, DiPaolo became so ill early during that year that doctors gave him only two days to live. He recovered and was able to attend an AIDS funds gala where he met NFL football player Lawrence Taylor. Taylor autographed a ball for DiPaolo, the two had a photo taken together, and DiPaolo disclosed that he was HIV positive.

The next day, DiPaolo&#x27;s disclosure was published in local newspapers. Schoolmates&#x27; parents threatened to withdraw their children, family friends began avoiding the DiPaolos, and crowds began appearing to protest at his school. A legal battle ensued between the family and parents of children of the school that DiPaolo went to. Eventually, a New York court decided that DiPaolo would stay in the educational center he attended.

In 1992, HBO aired the &quot;&quot; special &quot;Blood Brothers: The Joey DiPaolo Story&quot;. DiPaolo won a lawsuit against the center from which the blood with which he was contaminated came.

DiPaolo is an AIDS activist. In 2000 he founded Camp TLC, Together Living a Challenge, for children who cannot attend regular summer camps because of AIDS. He resides in Staten Island, with his wife Lauren and daughters Joey Jayde and Vivy Rey, and operates DiPaolo&#x27;s Barber Shop in Tottenville.

<text>Tighe Dombrowski (born March 4, 1982) is an American former soccer player.

Dombrowski played four years of college soccer for the UW–Milwaukee Panthers of the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee from 2000 to 2003, during which he was named first team All-Horizon League three times. He was named an honorable mention All-American following his senior season in 2003. Dombrowski tallied sixteen goals and thirteen assists in his time at UW–Milwaukee, and helped them advance to the second round of the NCAA Tournament his sophomore, junior, and senior years. In 2002, he played for the Des Moines Menace in the Premier Development League. In 2003, he played for the Chicago Fire Reserves.

After graduating from UW–Milwaukee, Dombrowski was drafted fiftieth overall in the 2004 MLS SuperDraft by the San Jose Earthquakes, and signed to a developmental contract. Along with the rest of his Earthquakes teammates, he moved to Houston for the 2006 season, but was signed by Swedish then-Division 1 (effectively the third division) side IK Sirius Fotboll in April 2006, having impressed the coaching staff at Studenternas IP during his trial in February and March. In July 2007, Tighe helped Sirius save three points by scoring two goals in the last minutes of the game against Jönköpings Södra IF, turning the game from 0–1 to 2–1 in the span of six minutes.

Dombrowski had a trial with New York Red Bulls but did not earn a contract and later signed with USL-1 side Minnesota Thunder.

<text>The 47th New Zealand Parliament was a term of the Parliament of New Zealand. Its composition was determined by the 2002 election, and it sat until 11 August 2005.

The Labour Party and the Progressive Party, backed by United Future, commanded a majority throughout the 47th Parliament. The Labour-led administration was in its second term. The National Party, although dealt a significant blow in the last election, remained the largest opposition party. Other non-government parties were New Zealand First, ACT, the Greens, and (from mid-2004) the Māori Party.

The 47th Parliament consisted of 120 representatives. Sixty-nine of these were chosen by geographical electorates, including seven Māori electorates. The remainder were elected by means of party-list proportional representation under the MMP electoral system.

==Electoral boundaries for the 47th Parliament==
==Overview of seats==
The table below shows the number of MPs in each party following the 2002 election and at dissolution:

Notes
* United Future supported the Labour-Progressive coalition on a confidence and supply basis.
* Tariana Turia resigned as MP and from the Labour Party on 30 April 2004 following the foreshore and seabed controversy. She won the resulting by-election under the banner of the new Māori Party.
* The Working Government majority is calculated as all Government MPs less all other parties.
* The relationship differs from the one in the last Parliament in that the Greens are not now providing a guarantee of confidence and supply. The agreement notes that the government parties and the Green party share many similar aspirations and are keen to work together.

==Initial composition of the 47th Parliament==
The initial members of the 47th Parliament were as follows:
==By-elections during 47th Parliament==
There was one by-election held during the term of the 47th Parliament.

===Summary of changes during term===
*Graham Kelly, a Labour list MP, left Parliament on 29 July 2003 to take up a position as High Commissioner to Canada. Moana Mackey, the next candidate on Labour&#x27;s party list, entered Parliament in his place. 
*Donna Awatere Huata, an ACT list MP, was officially declared an independent on 11 November 2003. This followed her suspension from the ACT caucus on 11 February 2003 after allegations of fraud were made against her. After a lengthy legal fight which went all the way to the Supreme Court, she was expelled from Parliament on 19 November 2004. She was replaced by Kenneth Wang on 30 November.
*Tariana Turia, the Labour MP for Te Tai Hauauru, resigned from Parliament over the foreshore and seabed issue on 17 May 2004. On 10 July, Turia won the resulting by-election under the banner of the new Māori Party, and took her seat again on 27 July.
*Jonathan Hunt, a Labour list MP, left Parliament on 30 March 2005 to take up a position as High Commissioner to the United Kingdom. Lesley Soper, the next candidate on Labour&#x27;s party list, was sworn in to replace him on 5 April.

== Seating plan ==

=== As on 10 August 2004 ===
The chamber is in a horseshoe-shape.

<doc id="1036146" wikidata="Q36158" url="?curid=1036146" title="Kumzari language">
<text>Kumzari (, ) is a Southwestern Iranian language that is similar to the Persian, Achomi and Luri languages. Although vulnerable, it survives today with between 4,000 and 5,000 speakers. It is spoken by Kumzaris on the Kumzar coast of Musandam Peninsula (northern Oman) as well as the Shihuh in the United Arab Emirates. Kumzari speakers can also be found in the towns of Dibba and Khasab as well as various villages, and on Larak Island. 

Kumzari is the only Iranian language spoken exclusively in the Arabian Peninsula.

==Location==
The Kumzari name derives from the historically rich mountainous village of Kumzar. The language has two main groups of speakers, one on each side of the Strait of Hormuz: the Shihuh tribe of the Musandam Peninsula and the Laraki community of Larak Island in Iran. On the Musandam Peninsula, the Kumzar population is concentrated in Oman, in the village of Kumzar and in a quarter of Khasab known as the Harat al-Kamazirah. In addition, Kumzari is found at Dibba and the coastal villages of Elphinstone and the Malcolm Inlets. It is the mother tongue of fishermen who are descendants of the Yemeni conqueror of Oman, Malek bin Faham (). Based on linguistic evidence, Kumzari was present in the Arabia region before the Muslim conquest of the region in the 7th Century A.D.
==Alphabet==
Kumzari can be written with the Arabic script.
 The Kumzari alphabet has 33 letters: 28 letters from the alphabet, 3 additional letters, the lam-Alif ligature and Hamza.
 Kumzari alphabet:
* ا: الف (alif) - - / ā (no pronunciation or /aː/)
* ب: به (ba) - b (/b/
* پ: په (pa) - p (/p/
* ت: ته (ta) - t (/t/)
* ث: ثه (sa) - s (/s/)
* ج: جيم (jīm) - j (/dʒ/
* چ: چيم (gīm) - g (/g/

 Kumzari uses the letter چ, which in Persian represents tʃ, to represent the /g/ sound. This practice is not unique to Kumzari: it is also used to transliterate Hebrew words in the Arabic script for the ג, and also in Lebanon and Greek Aljamiado. The tʃ sound in Kumzari is writtenۺ, which is also used in Arabi Malayalam script for the Malayalam ഷ.

 Kumzari has 8 vowels: a, ā (/aː/), i, ī (/iː/), u, ū (/uː/), e (/eː/) and o (/oː/). The short vowels a, i and u are written with the 3 harakats Fatḥa, Kasra and Ḍamma, and the long vowels with the 3 harakats followed by ا, ي and و. The long ā vowel at the beginning of a word is written آ. Short vowels a i u at the end of word are written with the 3 diacritics followed by ه. The e and o vowels are written withي and و without any diacritics.

== Phonology ==

=== Consonants ===
Kumzari has consonants, and all but three () also exist as geminates


=== Vowels ===
Kumzari has a length distinction in its vowels, with five long vowels and three short vowels. Vowels never occur in direct hiatus; rather, they are separated by either a semivowel such as or /w/, or a glottal stop ().

<text>The London Defence Positions were a late 19th-century scheme of earthwork fortifications in the southeast of England, designed to protect London from foreign invasion landing on the south coast. The positions were a carefully surveyed contingency plan for a line of entrenchments, which could be quickly excavated in a time of emergency. 

The line to be followed by these entrenchments was supported by thirteen permanent small polygonal forts or redoubts called London Mobilisation Centres, which were equipped with all the stores and ammunition that would be needed by the troops tasked with digging and manning the positions.

==Origins==
The 1859 Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom report on Britain&#x27;s defences believed that London was practically undefendable; they proposed a fort at Shooters Hill to defend the Royal Arsenal at Woolwich, but it was never acted upon. Following a number of proposals by senior military figures, an 1888 memorandum written by Colonel John Charles Ardagh envisaged a scheme of simple earthworks for infantry and moveable armaments, intended to be dug and manned in an emergency by the Volunteer Force, the line being supported by permanent works, the London Mobilisation Centres, at 5 mile (8 km) intervals, which acted as stores and magazines. The London Defence Scheme was announced in Parliament in March 1889 by the Secretary of State for War, Edward Stanhope, by which time the 13 sites for the Mobilisation Centres had already been purchased at a cost of £25,000.

==Locations==

The London Mobilisation Centres were built along a 70-mile (113-kilometre) stretch of the North Downs from Guildford to the Darenth valley and across the River Thames in Essex. Thirteen sites were chosen, at Pewley Hill, Henley Grove, Denbies, Box Hill, Betchworth, Reigate, East Merstham, Fosterdown, Woldingham, Betsom&#x27;s Hill, Halstead, Farningham and (to the northeast of London) North Weald. 

The design of each site varied, but they were never very elaborate, just a magazine and storehouses for the mobilisation of troops, with limited defences. The intention was that the centres would, in addition to holding ammunition and other supplies, act as strong points in an almost continuous line of field fortifications. The trench lines joining the Defence Positions could be rapidly excavated on the outbreak of war. Related stores were set up at Tilbury, Warley and possibly Caterham. They were quickly viewed as obsolete, and all were sold off in 1907, with the exception of Fort Halstead, now used by DSTL.

During World War I, part of the London Defence Positions scheme was resurrected to form a stop line of trenches, in case of a German invasion. North of the Thames, the line was continued to the River Lea at Broxbourne rather than stopping at Epping. South of the Thames, it was continued to Halling, via Wrotham, linking to the Chatham defences. At the western end the line was stopped short at Buckland Hill, just beyond Reigate Fort.

At Guildford, houses have been built on the Pewley Hill site, but Henley Fort (aka Henley Grove) has been well preserved as a youth education centre. It could be seen on a Heritage Open Day.

== Reigate Fort ==

Reigate Fort has been owned by the National Trust since 1932. The structure was falling into disrepair, but grant money from the Biffaward, the Heritage Lottery grant and the National Trust itself has enabled the Trust to restore the building. The first phase of the repairs was carried out in 2000 and was funded by a grant of £104,000 from the Biffaward. A second phase cost £174,000.

The fort opened to the public free of charge in 2007, though restoration work is ongoing. Information boards have been installed to tell visitors about the buildings. A teacher&#x27;s pack is available and educational visits can be arranged.

<doc id="1036161" wikidata="Q889073" url="?curid=1036161" title="Rodulf, Herule king">
<text>Rodulf was king of the Heruli kingdom on the Middle Danube in the period around 500, and possibly of Scandinavian origin. He died in a battle in about 508, with the neighbouring Lombards, which led to the splitting up of the Heruli. He is probably the same Heruli king that Theoderic the Great wrote to in two surviving letters which do not mention his name, in one of which Theoderic &quot;adopted&quot; him with a gift of arms. Less certainly, many scholars also equate him to the King Rodulf that Jordanes mentions as having come from Scandinavia to Italy, to join Theoderic.

Rodulf was described by Procopius as the king of the Danubian Heruli already three years after the beginning of the reign of Emperor Anastasius (reigned 491-518). Paul the Deacon gave the same name for the Herul king who died when they were defeated by the Lombards, which is normally dated by historians to about 508. After this defeat Procopius reported that while some crossed the Danube into the Roman empire, another part of the Heruli nobility migrated north to the island of Thule (the name Procopius gave to Scandinavia), while others were allowed to settle in a new kingdom under Roman controlled territory near present-day Belgrade.

It is uncertain but possible that this Rodulf is the same king of that name who is described in the &quot;Getica&quot; of Jordanes, as the king of the Ranii on the &quot;island&quot; of Scandza (what Jordanes called Scandinavia), who left his kingdom near the Danes, and came to Italy, where he succeeded in gaining the &quot;embrace&quot; (&quot;gremium&quot;) of the Ostrogothic King of Italy, Theodoric the Great. Notably, Jordanes mentions that the Heruli had a connection to this area. Some had lived in the region until they were driven out at some point in time by the Danes. However, Jordanes does not specifically connect Rodulf of the Rani to the Heruli. Procopius confirms that the Heruli had a connection to Scandinavia at least after the death of their king Rudolf, because he explains that some of the nobles who did not wish to come under Roman domination subsequently migrated there - leading some scholars to propose that these immigrants were the Heruli who the Danes expelled.

Another possible record of Rodulf of the Rani, and possibly of the Herules, is thus one of the surviving state papers of Theoderic which shows that he adopted a Herule king (who is not named in that passage) as a &quot;son in arms&quot;. The letter was made during the time of Cassiodorus&#x27;s public service in the early 6th century, and is dated to 507-511. Apart from the name Rudolf, the special allegiance to Theoderic is notable. 

The Scandza passage of Jordanes is subject to many different interpretations, and some historians have proposed that Jordanes made errors. For example, Theodor Mommsen believed Jordanes should have described the Scandinavian Rudolf as a Herul, and the historian Herwig Wolfram has described this Scandinavian Rudolf as a Gaut.

Due to the similarity of the circumstances, it has been suggested that the various accounts describe one individual, although this remains uncertain. Historians such as Andrew Merrill have pointed out that the similar elements in the accounts of Jordanes and Procopius may come from a common source, such as Cassiodorus, who worked for Theoderic.

More speculatively, another debated issue is whether Rodulf could be the inspiration for certain aspects of later heroic poetry, possibly including the Norse saga character Hrólfr Kraki.

==King of the Heruls==
The Herul kingdom was somewhere in the area of northern Lower Austria, north of the Upper Danube. The Danubian Heruli became escaped Hunnish domination in 454, after the Battle of Nedao. Rodulf is the first known king of this kingdom, and the first mention of him which can be associated with a date is the remark of Procopius that implies he was ruling already in the early 490s. This was in the period after Theoderic the Great took over the Kingdom of Italy from Odoacer in 493. In Italy, Odoacer had himself been named as a Heruli king, and other Danubian peoples who had followed him there. After his murder in 493, the Herules still ruled a kingdom north of the Danube:
Procopius thus sees the conflict with the Langobards starting already in the 5th century, around 494. If however the un-named Herule king who was adopted by Theoderic was Rodulf, based on the idea that there was no Herule king after him who Theoderic would have allied to, then the letter announcing his adoption is estimated to be from 507-511, and the war can not have been earlier than that.

The correspondence of Theoderic collected in the &quot;Variae&quot; of Cassiodorus also mentions an unnamed king of the Heruli, who has been identified with Rodulf by some historians. He mentioned that Theodoric adopted a king of the Heruli as his &quot;son in arms,&quot; by giving him a horse, sword and shield, probably around 507. The letter to the king, which was to be translated and explained by the envoys, stated that the king would &quot;hold the first rank among the peoples&quot;.

After becoming ruler of Italy, Theodoric wanted to repacify the previous homeland of the Goths near Sirmium, and according to historian Herwig Wolfram, he therefore wanted to establish an alliance with the Heruli king Rodulf. As a result, according to Wolfram, Rodulf &quot;probably included in his sphere of influence the region north of Lake Balaton.&quot;

In another letter from the collection of Cassiodorus, probably from between 507 and 514, Theodoric asks for the assistance of the kings of the Heruli, Thuringi and Varni for a counter-attack against the pressure from the Franks, who were in conflict with the Visigoths. Procopius implied that the battle which led to Rodulf&#x27;s death took place around 494, it is therefore considered unlikely to have occurred about 508.

A later account of the battle with the Lombards by Paul the Deacon gives Rodulf a more legitimate &quot;casus belli&quot; against the Lombards. Rodulf purportedly declared war against the Lombards because his brother was murdered by Tato&#x27;s daughter Rumetruda, after a falling-out between the two, during his brother&#x27;s return home.

In the &quot;Historia Langobardorum&quot; (&quot;History of the Lombards&quot;), Paul the Deacon mentions that Rodulf was among the dead in a battle against the Lombards under Tato, probably in 508. Theodoric did not manage to intervene in time, and the Heruls thus suffered a crushing defeat. The Heruls were split up as a result of the defeat in the battle. The Lombards took both Rodulf&#x27;s standard (&quot;vexillum&quot;) and his helmet, and Paul the Deacon claimed that this broke the courage of the Heruli such that they never had a king again. However Procopius, who was much closer to the events, notes that the Heruli divided and moved, but still had kings.
==King in Scandza==

King Rodulf (&quot;Roduulf rex&quot;) of the Ranii is only mentioned once, in the &quot;Getica&quot; (&quot;De origine actibusque Getarum&quot;; &quot;The Origin and Deeds of the Goths&quot;) which was written by the Roman historian Jordanes. Although he wrote some generations later, one of his sources was the now lost &quot;Historia Gothorum&quot; (&quot;History of the Goths&quot;) of Cassiodorus, who had written his account at the request of Theodoric the Great, King of the Ostrogoths and ruler of Italy.

In the 19th century, the German classicist Theodor Mommsen argued that the Rodulf of the Ranii tribe and the Rodulf of the Heruli tribe constituted the same person. He proposed that Rodulf could have arrived to Theodoric in 489, when he was in Moesia.

Some modern historians have speculated that it could have been this Rodulf or a similar traveler who provided Cassiodorus or Jordanes with the information for their extensive lists and details of Scandinavian peoples and tribes. In any case, Rodulf was not the only Nordic warlord who visited the Goths and potentially could have provided knowledge about Scandinavian tribes. He probably traveled together with a band of warriors.

In the &quot;Getica&quot;, it is said that Rodulf spurned and fled his own kingdom, in times which were still recent for Jordanes. The way that his text has come to us, Rodulf is described as king of the &quot;Ranii&quot; who are described as one of several peoples living near the Danes. Jordanes describes him as achieving what he desired from Theoderic. The passage, as translated by Christensen, is as follows:
Modern historians are uncertain whether Jordanes intended to say that Rodulf was king of the Ranii tribe alone, or if he ruled all, or any other of the tribes described in the same context.

Historian Otto J. Maenchen-Helfen, who accepted Mommsen&#x27;s identification, thought Rodulf should actually be read as king of the Heruli, with the short list of neighbouring tribes inserted confusingly, namely the &quot;Granii, Augandzi, Eunixi, Taetel, Rugii, Arochi, Ranii.&quot;

In contrast, other historians have proposed that Rodulf had been kings of the list of seven peoples (Granii ... Rani), but most of these can not be identified with any confidence. Since Mommsen&#x27;s edition of Jordanes, with index notes by Karl Müllenhof, there have been proposals connecting them to Norway. Some modern historians, mostly Norwegian, have continued to make such proposals and imply that Rodulf was a king of all seven of these peoples there. For example, the list has been interpreted as referring to the inhabitants of &quot;Grenland, Halogaland, Telelmark, Ryfylkem, Hordaland, and Ranrike or Romsdal&quot;. The vast geographic distances between the tribes, scattered throughout the Norwegian coast, and the unlikeliness of a unified kingdom of such a magnitude at this early point has been cited as an argument against such a possibility.

The name of the Rugii, on the other hand, matches another Middle Danubian people, who were neighbours of the Heruli, and they are thought to have migrated from the Baltic Sea. Historian Axel Kristinsson has speculated that it could have been natural for Rodulf to seek out some of his kinsmen, namely the Danubian Rugians who had joined the Ostrogoths after their kingdom was destroyed in 487.

The scientist-explorer Fridtjof Nansen proposed that &quot;Heruli&quot; at first perhaps was a common name for bands of northern warriors, who to a certain degree consisted of Norwegians. In his book &quot;In northern mists&quot;, Nansen suggested that Rodulf of the Ranii tribe could have migrated south with a band of warriors, and that on arriving at the Danube, pressed by other warlike tribes in the vicinity, he sought alliance with Theodoric. Nansen believed this could have happened before Theodoric&#x27;s invasion of Italy in 489, at the same time that the Heruli were just north of the Danube, and were the nearest neighbours of the Goths.

In short, although particularly scholars have long identified the unnamed Heruli king and the Rodulfs as the same person, including the &quot;Reallexikon der Germanischen Altertumskunde&quot; in an entry by Norwegian historian Claus Krag, others such as historian Walter Goffart and archaeologist Dagfinn Skre have questioned this identification.

Historian A. H. Merrills, on the other hand, has proposed the possibility that associating Rodulf with the scandinavian tribes could have been politically motivated: &quot;The &quot;Getica&quot; may, of course, be correct in its association of Roduulf with the far north, but the possibility that it merely reflects an ideological distortion should not be overlooked.&quot;

==Aftermath==
In the early 6th century, the Lombard king Wacho took Silinga as his third wife, who was said to be the daughter of the last king of the Heruls. This has led some scholars to believe that Silinga was probably a daughter of Rodulf. They had the son Walthari. The marriage between Wacho and Silinga functioned to legitimize the Lombards as the successors to the kingdom of the Heruls.

It has been debated whether Rodulf may have influenced later heroic poetry, since the causes of the war between the Lombards and the Heruli (as reported by Paul the Deacon) concerns related issues. Some have furthermore argued that Rodulf could be the background for the character Hrólfr Kraki who appears in the later sagas. Evidence for this includes the significant similarities between the traditions of, on the one side, the Scyldings of the &quot;Skjöldunga saga&quot; and the Scylfings of the Swedish sagas, and on the other, historical knowledge of the environment around the Heruli, Goths and Huns.

It has also been speculated that the Ráðulfr mentioned in the Rök runestone (which also mentions Theodoric the Great) could be identical with Rodulf.

<doc id="1036167" wikidata="Q3430189" url="?curid=1036167" title="Earthly Powers">
<text>Earthly Powers is a panoramic saga novel of the 20th century by Anthony Burgess first published on October 13th 1980. It begins with the &quot;outrageously provocative&quot; first sentence: &quot;It was the afternoon of my eighty-first birthday, and I was in bed with my catamite when Ali announced that the archbishop had come to see me.&quot;

On one level it is a parody of a &quot;blockbuster&quot; novel, with the 81-year-old hero, Kenneth Toomey (allegedly loosely based on British author W. Somerset Maugham), telling the story of his life in 82 chapters. It &quot;summed up the literary, social and moral history of the century with comic richness as well as encyclopedic knowingness&quot;, according to Malcolm Bradbury.

The novel appeared on the shortlist for the Booker Prize in the year of its publication but lost out to William Golding&#x27;s &quot;Rites of Passage&quot;. In an October 2006 poll in &quot;The Observer&quot;, it was named joint third for the best work of British and Commonwealth fiction of the last 25 years (along with Ian McEwan&#x27;s &quot;Atonement&quot;, Penelope Fitzgerald&#x27;s &quot;The Blue Flower&quot;, Kazuo Ishiguro&#x27;s &quot;The Unconsoled&quot;, and Salman Rushdie&#x27;s &quot;Midnight&#x27;s Children&quot;).

==Plot summary==
On his eighty-first birthday, retired homosexual writer Kenneth Toomey is asked by the Archbishop of Malta to assist in the process of canonisation of Carlo Campanati, the late Pope Gregory XVII and his brother-in-law. Toomey subsequently works on his memoirs, which span the major part of the 20th century.

==References to historical events==
The novel includes coverage of: 
*The Great War
*The 1918–1919 influenza pandemic
*The rise of fascism in Italy
*Nazi Germany
*World War II
*Post-colonialism in Africa

Since it is an integral theme of the novel that the protagonist is an unreliable narrator, the work highlights the fallibility of memory by including many deliberate factual errors, as explained by Burgess in the second volume of his autobiography, &quot;You&#x27;ve Had Your Time&quot;. These may be found on almost every page of the novel, and vary in subtlety from inaccuracies of German grammar to deliberately contrary re-writings of history.

* The fictional Carlo Campanati becomes Pope Gregory XVII. This name was allegedly the one to be adopted by Giuseppe Siri, who four times failed to be elected Pope in controversial circumstances. The dates of Carlo&#x27;s papal election (1958) and death (3 June 1963) correspond to those of Pope John XXIII, as does his general appearance. However, many of Campanati&#x27;s achievements and attributes are shared by the real-life Pope Paul VI, who, like Carlo, was Archbishop of Milan before his election. Other concordances between Carlo and Paul VI include his dealings with Benito Mussolini&#x27;s government, his support for Jews escaping the Nazis, his arguments against contraception and priestly marriage, and his world travels during his papacy. Carlo&#x27;s plan for an ecumenical reorganisation of the church is reflected in both John XXIII, who called the Second Vatican Council, and in Paul VI, who opted to continue the council after John&#x27;s death.
* The Jonestown mass suicide of 1978 is presented in the form of a fictional group called the &quot;Children of God&quot; (not to be confused with the new religious movement of the same name). While the basic premise of the incident is retained in the novel (charismatic religious leader leads a group of disenfranchised followers to ritual suicide), many of the details are changed. In the novel, the mass suicide takes place in 1963, not 1978, in a compound located in the Mojave Desert of California, not Guyana, and the congregation is given cyanide tablets, rather than the now-infamous poisoned Flavor Aid.
*In chapter 47, Toomey, one of whose books is turned into a film in Nazi Germany, is invited to a film festival in Berlin. He takes the airship LZ 129 &quot;Hindenburg&quot; which from 6 May 1936 until the disaster of 6 May 1937 at Lakehurst NJ made ten trips to the US. In Berlin &quot;nowhere on the streets so clean you could eat your dinner from them did I see wretches wearing the yellow David star into trucks being harried. That would all be round the back.&quot;
:The yellow badge was not introduced in Germany until 1 September 1941.

*There is a reception with Goebbels at the Propagandaministerium, &quot;he in tails, his lady in white and jewels. I had met her before ... when she was still the wife of a certain Herr Friedländer, a rich jew who had been forced by the party to endow her on her new marriage with half a million marks and also to give her new husband as a wedding present the Friedländer &quot;Schloss&quot; at Schwannwerder.&quot;
:Actually the Jewish merchant Friedländer had been her stepfather and thus made her Magda Friedländer. Before industrialist Günther Quandt married her in 1921, on request of her mother&#x27;s first husband, Dr. Ritschel, Magda was registered as his daughter. After her divorce from Quandt in 1929 Magda married Goebbels in 1931 and bore him six children. In 1934 the Goebbelses settled on the island of Schwanenwerder buying cheaply from persecuted Jews.

*In chapter 49 the first film shown at the festival is &quot;Hitlerjunge Quex&quot;, an early Nazi film of 1933, on the next day to be followed by the premiere of a new film on the life of Horst Wessel. The reader is correctly informed that already in 1933 a film on Horst Wessel had been made, but out of &quot;suspicions that the film would not really serve ... the name of the hero had been changed to Hans Westmar.&quot;
:That the premiere of &quot;Hans Westmar&quot; had actually, as the novel states, been attended not only by Hermann Göring but also by Wilhelm Furtwängler is unlikely.

*In the fictional Horst Wessel film Toomey gets to see, the Berliner Wessel is played by the popular Viennese actor Paul Hörbiger. Wessel had died in February 1930 at the age of 22 (the novel says the funeral was in 1929). Hörbiger in 1936/37 was 42 years old and married with four children. The novel describes him as &quot;quite clearly to me homosexual: impulses flashed between us in the garish swastika-flagged eau-de-cologne-sprayed entrance hall&quot;. This has nothing to do with the real Hörbiger.
* The fictional writer Jakob Strehler, whose work Toomey starts reading, is said to have been awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1935. The prize was not awarded that year.

<text>Jean-Baptiste Frédéric Isidor, Baron Thielemans (29 April 1922 – 22 August 2016), known professionally as Toots Thielemans (), was a Belgian jazz musician. He was mostly known for playing the chromatic harmonica, as well as his guitar and whistling skills, and composing. According to jazz historian Ted Gioia, his most important contribution was in &quot;championing the humble harmonica&quot;, which Thielemans made into a &quot;legitimate voice in jazz&quot;. He eventually became the &quot;preeminent&quot; jazz harmonica player.

His first professional performances were with Benny Goodman&#x27;s band when they toured Europe in 1949 and 1950. He emigrated to the U.S. in 1951, becoming a citizen in 1957. From 1953 to 1959 he played with George Shearing, and then led his own groups on tours in the U.S. and Europe. In 1961 he recorded and performed live one of his own compositions, &quot;Bluesette&quot;, which featured him playing guitar and whistling. In the 1970s and 1980s, he continued touring and recording, appearing with musicians such as Oscar Peterson, Elis Regina, Caetano Veloso, Ella Fitzgerald, Ivan Lins, Sarah Vaughan, Bill Evans, Dizzy Gillespie, Kenny Werner, Pat Metheny, Jaco Pastorius, Mina Mazzini, Elis Regina, Quincy Jones, George Shearing, Natalie Cole, Billy Joel, Paul Simon, and Paquito D&#x27;Rivera.

Thielemans recorded the soundtracks for &quot;The Pawnbroker&quot; (1964), &quot;The Reivers&quot; (1969), &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot; (1969), &quot;The Getaway&quot; (1972), &quot;Cinderella Liberty&quot; (1973), &quot;The Sugarland Express&quot; (1974) and &quot;Looking for Mr. Goodbar&quot; (1977). His harmonica theme song for the popular &quot;Sesame Street&quot; TV show was heard for 40 years. He often performed and recorded with Quincy Jones, who once called him &quot;one of the greatest musicians of our time.&quot; In 2009 he was designated a Jazz Master by the National Endowment for the Arts, the highest honor for a jazz musician in the United States.

==Early years==
Thielemans was born in Brussels on 29 April 1922. His parents owned a café. He began playing music at an early age, using a homemade accordion at age three. During the German occupation of Belgium beginning in 1940, he became attracted to jazz, but was then playing on a full-size accordion or a harmonica, which he taught himself to play in his teens.

After being introduced to the music of Belgian-born jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt, he became inspired to teach himself guitar, which he did by listening to Reinhardt&#x27;s recordings. At the time he was a college student majoring in mathematics. By the war&#x27;s end in 1945, he considered himself a full-time musician. He said in 1950, &quot;Django is still one of my main influences, I think, for lyricism. He can make me cry when I hear him.&quot; During an interview in 1988, he recalled, &quot;I guess I was born at the right time to live and adapt and be touched by the evolution in the jazz language.&quot;

==Career==
===1940s–1950s===

In 1949 he joined a jam session in Paris with Sidney Bechet, Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, Max Roach and others. He first heard the faster bebop style of jazz from records by Parker and Dizzy Gillespie after they had reached Belgium after the war. They became his musical &quot;prophets&quot;. As his small collection of jazz records grew, the music of Benny Goodman and Lester Young began to impress him the most.

During a visit to the U.S. in 1948, an agent of Benny Goodman heard him play at a small New York music club. Not long after he returned to his home in Belgium, he received a letter inviting him to join Goodman&#x27;s band while they toured in Europe. He readily accepted the invitation and joined their tours in 1949 and 1950. During the tour, Goodman was &quot;shocked&quot; when he learned that these tours were the first time Thielemans had earned money from his playing. Although Thielemans was hired on as a guitarist, when Goodman&#x27;s group debuted at the London Palladium, he played the harmonica due to union restrictions.

During those years, he also made his first record with fellow band member, tenor saxophonist Zoot Sims. In 1951 he toured with singer-songwriter and compatriot Bobbejaan Schoepen, performing strictly as a guitarist.

Thielemans moved to the United States in 1952 where he was a member of Charlie Parker&#x27;s All-Stars and worked with Miles Davis and Dinah Washington. In 1957 he became a U.S. citizen. From 1953 to 1959 he played guitar and harmonica with the George Shearing Quintet. With Shearing, he added whistling to his repertoire. While Thielemans was playing in Hamburg in 1960 on tour with Shearing, a young musician and observer —John Lennon— noticed that Thielemans played a Rickenbacker guitar. Lennon was impressed, and felt he had to have an American guitar, on the principle that &quot;if it was good enough for Thielemans it was good enough for me.&quot; Lennon and the Beatles helped make Rickenbacker guitars world-famous.

In 1955, Thielmans recorded his first album as a band leader, &quot;The Sound&quot;. During the 1950s, Thielemans had dominated the &quot;miscellaneous instrument&quot; category in &quot;Down Beat&quot; magazine&#x27;s poll. Jerry Murad, of Jerry Murad&#x27;s Harmonicats recalls Thielemans&#x27;s mastery:
From 1959 on he toured internationally with his small group along with intermittently recording in the studio. He recorded with singers and musicians including Ella Fitzgerald, Pat Metheny, Jaco Pastorius, Stephane Grappelli, J.J. Johnson, Oscar Peterson, Shirley Horn, Joe Pass, and jazz pianist Bill Evans, among others. Thielemans says that his recording with Evans&#x27;s trio, &quot;Affinity,&quot; (1979) was one of his favorites.

===1960s–1970s===

Toots Thielemans wrote &quot;Bluesette&quot;, a jazz standard, which he performed on harmonica or while playing the guitar and whistling in unison. He said, &quot;If there&#x27;s a piece of music that describes me, it&#x27;s that song.&quot; First recorded by him in 1962, with lyrics added by Norman Gimbel, the song became a major worldwide hit. It has since been covered by over one hundred artists. Toots also wrote the ballad &quot;Ladyfingers&quot;, which appeared on Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass&#x27;s album &quot;Whipped Cream and Other Delights&quot;.

He worked both as a bandleader and as a sideman, including many projects with composer/arranger Quincy Jones. In the 1960s he performed on television with Peggy Lee. In 1969 he recorded &quot;Honeysuckle Rose Aquarela Do Brasil&quot; with singer Elis Regina and performed with her on Swedish television special.

During his career he performed on many film soundtracks, such as &quot;The Pawnbroker&quot; (1964), &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot; (1969), &quot;The Getaway&quot; (1972), &quot;Turkish Delight&quot; (1973), &quot;Cinderella Liberty&quot; (1973), &quot;The Sugarland Express&quot; (1974), &quot;The Yakuza&quot; (1974), &quot;Looking for Mr. Goodbar&quot; (1977), &quot;The Wiz&quot; (1978), &quot;Jean de Florette&quot; (1986), and &quot;French Kiss&quot; (1995). His closing theme to the popular &quot;Sesame Street&quot; television show was heard for 40 years.

His music was heard on the Belgian television series &quot;Witse,&quot; and in the Netherlands, for the &quot;Baantjer&quot; program. He composed the music for the 1974 Swedish film &quot;Dunderklumpen!,&quot; in which he also provided the voice of the animated character Pellegnillot. His whistling and harmonica playing was heard on Old Spice commercials in the 1960s. He played harmonica on &quot;Night Game&quot; on Paul Simon&#x27;s 1975 album &quot;Still Crazy After All These Years&quot;.

===1980s and later===

During the early 1980s Thielemans was a guest a number of times on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman.&quot; He performed with the bassist Jaco Pastorius, and in 1983 he contributed to Billy Joel&#x27;s album &quot;An Innocent Man,&quot; in the song, &quot;Leave A Tender Moment Alone&quot;. A year later, he appeared on the Julian Lennon song &quot;Too Late for Goodbyes&quot; from the album &quot;Valotte.&quot;

In 1984, he recorded with Billy Eckstine on the singer&#x27;s final album (&quot;I Am a Singer&quot;), featuring ballads and standards arranged and conducted by Angelo DiPippo. In the 1990s, Thielemans embarked on theme projects that included world music. In 1998 he released a French-flavoured album titled &quot;Chez Toots&quot; featuring guest singer Johnny Mathis.

During those years, he often recorded songs as personal tributes to those who were influential during his career. On &quot;Chez Toots&quot;, for example, he included &quot;Dance For Victor&quot;, which he dedicated to his sometimes keyboard accompanist, Victor Feldman. Similarly, he recorded &quot;Waltz for Sonny&quot; as a tribute to saxophonist Sonny Rollins. In June 1998, at Germany&#x27;s Jazzbaltica, he paid tribute to Frank Sinatra who died a month earlier. And during the first Caspian Jazz and Blues Festival in Azerbaijan in 2002, he performed his recorded version of &quot;Imagine&quot;, his tribute to its writer, John Lennon.

Thielemans was well liked for his modesty and kind demeanor in his native Belgium, and was known for describing himself as a Brussels &quot;&quot;ket&quot;,&quot; which means &quot;street kid&quot; in old Brussels slang.

==Later life==

He was nominated for the title of the Greatest Belgian in 2005. In the Flemish version, he finished in 20th place, and in the Walloon version he came 44th. On 23 January 2009, he joined guitarist Philip Catherine on stage at the Liberchies church (Belgium) in memory of the 100th anniversary of the birth of Django Reinhardt. In 2012, the Jazz at Lincoln Center concerts in New York celebrated Thieleman&#x27;s 90th birthday with, among others, Herbie Hancock, Eliane Elias, and Kenny Werner. He performed for the occasion and left the stage standing among his friends.

Because of health issues that led to show cancellations, Thielemans announced his retirement on 12 March 2014, cancelling all scheduled concerts. He was also hospitalized for a broken arm. His manager stated that Thielemans &quot;wants to enjoy the rest he deserves.&quot; However, he did make one more stage appearance, unannounced, in August 2014, at the Jazz Middelheim Festival in Antwerp.

==Death==
Thielemans died in Braine-l&#x27;Alleud, Belgium, at the age of 94.

After the announcement, the Netherlands-based jazz and pop orchestra Metropole Orkest, along with American musician Quincy Jones, performed at London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall in Thielemans&#x27; honor. Another concert was performed at the Grand-Place, Brussels.

Thielemans was buried on 27 August 2016 in La Hulpe, just outside Brussels. Pianist Kenny Werner read a personal message from U.S. President Barack Obama for his widow, Huguette. It read: &quot;Dear Huguette. I was deeply saddened when I heard about your husband&#x27;s passing. I hope that shared memories will soften your suffering. Lift faith from the support of friends and family. Know that you will be in my thoughts for the next days. May Toots&#x27; music lead you and offer you consolation. I&#x27;m sure it will do this for all of us.&quot;

== Toots Thielemans Collection ==
In December 2016, the Music Division of the Royal Library of Belgium acquired the Toots Thielemans Collection. The collection consists of hundreds of sound recordings (78 rpm, vinyl records and CDs) and thousands of documents, such as photographs, press articles, scores, letters and concert programmes.

==Honours and awards==
Thielemans received a joint honorary doctorate from the Université libre de Bruxelles and the Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Belgium. In 2001, he was raised into the Belgian nobility by King Albert II and created &quot;Baron&quot; Thielemans for life, this in recognition of his contribution to music. Herewith, he chose the motto &quot;Be yourself, no more no less&quot;.

In 2006, Thielemans was honoured by an all-star tribute concert for him at Carnegie Hall. Pianist Herbie Hancock and clarinetist Paquito D&#x27;Rivera were among the performers. In 2009, he was awarded the highest U.S. honour that can be accorded to a jazz musician, the distinction of &quot;Jazz Master&quot;, by The National Endowment for the Arts. He was celebrated by a Google Doodle on his 100th birthday, 29 April 2022.

In 2020, the Brussels public transport authority began work on the Toots Thielemans Metro station. It will form part of the extension of Metro Line 3 and is expected to come into service in 2025.

<text>The Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (Ontario Section) – The Farmer-Labor Party of Ontario, more commonly known as the Ontario CCF, was a democratic socialist provincial political party in Ontario that existed from 1932 to 1961. It was the provincial wing of the federal Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF). The party had no leader in the beginning, and was governed by a provincial council and executive. The party&#x27;s first Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) was elected by voters in the 1934 Ontario general election. In the 1937 general election, no CCF members were elected to the Ontario Legislature. In 1942, the party elected Toronto lawyer Ted Jolliffe as its first leader. He led the party to within a few seats of forming the government in the 1943 general election; instead, it formed the Official Opposition. In that election, the first two women were elected to the Ontario Legislature as CCFers: Agnes Macphail and Rae Luckock. The 1945 election was a setback, as the party lost most of its seats in the Legislature, including Jolliffe&#x27;s seat. The party again became the Official Opposition after the 1948 general election, and defeated the Conservative premier George Drew in his seat, when Bill Temple unexpectedly won in the High Park constituency. The middle and late 1940s were the peak years for the Ontario CCF. After that time, its electoral performances were dismal, as it was reduced to a rump of two seats in the 1951 election, three seats in the 1955 election, and five seats in the 1959 election. Jolliffe stepped down as leader in 1953, and was replaced by Donald C. MacDonald.

The period between the 1951 defeat and the founding of the Ontario New Democratic Party was one of much internal strife, but MacDonald managed to keep the party together, despite the constant electoral defeats. In October 1961, the party dissolved itself and became part of the New Democratic Party.

==History==
===Origins===
The Ontario CCF was indirectly the successor to the 1919–23 United Farmers of Ontario–Labour coalition that formed the government in Ontario under Ernest C. Drury. While in 1934 several former United Farmer Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) became Liberal-Progressives aligned with the Ontario Liberal Party, the United Farmers of Ontario (UFO), as an organization, participated in the formation of the Ontario CCF, and was briefly affiliated with the party.

After a meeting in Ottawa on May 26, 1932, that brought together all the Members of Parliament that belonged to the Ginger Group, and some members of the League for Social Reconstruction (LSR), the CCF was formed, making J. S. Woodsworth the de facto leader, and giving responsibility for organizing Ontario to Agnes Macphail of the UFO. Macphail, as president of the Ontario Provincial Council, persuaded her fellow delegates at the December 1932 UFO convention to affiliate with the CCF provincial council. After the 1933 Regina convention, the name of the party was introduced as the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (Ontario Section) – The Farmer-Labor Party, though the shorter Ontario CCF was the most commonly used name.

Macphail served as the first chairman of the Ontario CCF from 1932 until 1934. As a UFO Member of Parliament (MP) in the Canadian House of Commons, she was forced to resign from the CCF after the UFO withdrew from the party after alleging communist influence in it. Consequently, the UFO&#x27;s two candidates in the 1934 provincial election, longtime incumbent MLA Farquhar Oliver (Grey South) and former MLA Leslie Warner Oke (Lambton East) under the UFO banner rather than with the CCF (though Oke was also endorsed by the CCF). Oliver was elected and would caucus with the Liberals before joining the party several years later. Macphail later served in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario as the CCF Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) for York East from 1943 to 1945 and again from 1948 to 1951.

Samuel Lawrence, an Independent Labour Party member of Hamilton City Council, was elected to the Ontario legislature as a CCF MPP in the 1934 provincial election, the first Ontario election contested by the CCF. The party received 7.1 percent of the vote and, with Lawrence&#x27;s election in Hamilton East, won its first seat in the Ontario Legislature. The Ontario CCF failed to win any seats in the 1937 election. He was elected Ontario CCF president in 1941. and served as Mayor of Hamilton from 1944 to 1949 leading a CCF slate in that city.

Alderman John Mitchell of Hamilton was elected the first Ontario CCF president in 1934 as part of a reorganization of the party after its provincial council had been suspended by federal leader J. S. Woodsworth for suspected communist infiltration. The reorganization created a new provincial council and central party executive and centralized what had been a loose structure of affiliate organizations and riding clubs. It was accompanied by a purge of party clubs and affiliates suspected of having been infiltrated by Communists and the removal of suspected Communists from senior party positions. The reorganization was prompted by complaints of Communist infiltration, due to the party&#x27;s previously loose structure. In reaction to alleged Communist involvement, the United Farmers of Ontario disaffiliated from the CCF. Mitchell unofficially led the Ontario CCF during the 1934 Ontario general election and conducted a province-wide tour during the 1937 election campaign but failed to win a seat in the Legislature. He continued as party president until 1941.

Graham Spry, a publisher and broadcaster who was also a member of the LSR, served as the Ontario CCF&#x27;s vice-president of its provincial council from 1934 to 1936. He was the first federal CCF candidate in Ontario, running in the September 24, 1934 by-election in Toronto East. Other prominent members were Elmore Philpott, a former Liberal. Philpott joined the CCF in 1933 and became president of the Ontario Association of CCF Clubs but resigned in March 1934 over the A. E. Smith affair that had caused the UFO to leave as well. Philpott rejoined the Liberal Party in 1935. The disagreement was in regards to how much support the fledgling CCF should give Smith, leader of the Canadian Labour Defence League, who had been charged with sedition for claiming that the state had attempted to assassinate imprisoned Communist Party of Canada leader Tim Buck. The CLDC was a communist front group. Woodsworth, and the Ontario CCF provincial council, opposed the CCF having any formal links with it or any other communist group. Some individual CCFers ignored this policy as did one section of the Ontario CCF, which was expelled. Nevertheless, Philpott and the UFO saw the Smith affair as evidence that the CCF had been infiltrated by Communists and left. The issue of what relationship the CCF should have with the Communist Party came to the fore again in 1936 when the party voted to ban any united front with Communists, over the objections of prominent CCFers such as East York reeve Arthur Henry Williams.

===Electoral breakthrough===
At the Ontario CCF&#x27;s tenth annual convention in Toronto, the first leadership election was held. Two candidates came forward: Toronto lawyer and Ontario CCF vice-president Ted Jolliffe, and union activist and former Ontario CCF Youth Movement organizer Murray Cotterill. On April 4, 1942, Jolliffe won the election, but the voting results were not announced. The newly created Leader position&#x27;s role was political and legislative, while internal CCF affairs and administration would remain the president&#x27;s domain.

The party achieved a major breakthrough under Jolliffe, in the 1943 general election, when it formed the Official Opposition with 32 percent of the vote and 34 seats. The CCF was just four seats short of George Drew&#x27;s Progressive Conservatives (&quot;Tories&quot;), who formed a minority government that was the beginning of what became a 42-year political dynasty.

===1945 &quot;Gestapo&quot; campaign===
In the 1945 election, Premier Drew ran an anti-Semitic, union bashing, Red-baiting campaign. The previous two years of anti-socialist attacks by the Conservatives and their supporters, like Gladstone Murray and Montague A. Sanderson, were devastatingly effective against the previously popular CCF. Much of the source material for the anti-CCF campaign came from the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP)&#x27;s Special Investigation Branch&#x27;s agent D-208: Captain William J. Osbourne-Dempster. His office was supposed to be investigating war-time 5th column saboteurs. Instead, starting in November 1943, he was investigating, almost exclusively, Ontario opposition MPPs, mainly focusing on the CCF caucus. The fact that Jolliffe knew about these &#x27;secret&#x27; investigations as early as February 1944 led to one of the most infamous incidents in 20th-century Canadian politics.

====May 24, 1945 radio speech====
The 1945 campaign was anything but genteel and polite. Jolliffe replied by giving a radio speech – written with the assistance of Lister Sinclair – that accused Drew of running a political Gestapo in Ontario. In the speech excerpt below, Jolliffe alleged that a secret department of the Ontario Provincial Police was acting as a political police – spying on the opposition and the media.

Jolliffe&#x27;s inflammatory speech became the main issue of the campaign, and dominated coverage in the media for the rest of the election. Drew, and his Attorney-General Leslie Blackwell vehemently denied Jolliffe&#x27;s accusations, but the public outcry was too much for them to abate. On May 26, 1945, during his own radio speech, Drew announced that he would be appointing a Royal Commission to investigate these charges. Jolliffe&#x27;s CCF and Mitchell Hepburn&#x27;s Ontario Liberal Party wanted the election suspended until the commission tabled its report. Hepburn sent Drew a personal telegram stating he would stop campaigning if the commission were held immediately. Drew ignored these requests and continued to hold the election on its original date, despite it being many months before the commission&#x27;s findings would be made available.

===Election Day, June 4, 1945===
Jolliffe&#x27;s CCF went from 34 seats to 8, but almost garnered the same number of votes cast, though their percentage of the popular vote dropped from 32 to 22 percent. A Gallup poll done a month earlier showed the CCF at essentially the same percentage, making it questionable whether or not the &quot;Gestapo&quot; speech had an effect on the campaign. Drew, with his attack campaign, successfully drove the voter turn-out up, thereby driving the CCF&#x27;s percentage and seat totals down.

Nineteen forty-five was one of Ontario&#x27;s most important elections in the 20th century, according to Caplan and David Lewis. It shaped the province for the next 40 years, as the Conservatives won a massive majority in the Legislature, and would remain in government for the next 40 consecutive years–most of that time with majority governments until the mid-1970s.

For Jolliffe, another election consequence was his tenure as the MPP from York South ended, at least for the time-being. He lost the election but did better than any other CCF candidate in Toronto or in the outlying Yorks.

===LeBel Royal Commission===
On May 28, Drew appointed Justice A.M. LeBel as the Royal Commissioner, thereby forming what has become known as the LeBel Royal Commission. His terms of reference were restricted to the question of whether Drew was personally responsible for the establishment of &quot;a secret political police organization, for the purpose of collecting, by secret spying, material to be used in attempt to keep him in power.&quot; Wider questions like why the OPP, Ontario civil servants, were keeping files on MPPs were not allowed.

Jolliffe acted as his own counsel throughout the commission, but was assisted by fellow CCF lawyer, Andrew Brewin. He and Brewin were able to establish, from several eyewitnesses, that agent D-208, Dempster, was spying on the CCF. What they could not prove, because they did not have access to the information in 1945, were the letters that Drew wrote to his supporter M.A. (Bugsy) Sanderson suggesting that he would finance any lawsuits or other charges stemming from the information provided by Dempster in his advertisements. Sanderson was, in late 1943 to 1945, along with Gladstone Murray, leading the libellous advertisement campaigns against the CCF in newspapers and billboards, with information gleaned from Dempster&#x27;s briefings. Jolliffe presented several witnesses that claimed to have seen these documents. But Jolliffe could not produce the letter, and Drew denied ever writing it.

On October 11, 1945, Justice LeBel issued his report that essentially exonerated Drew and Blackwell. Because Jolliffe presented only circumstantial evidence that linked Drew to Dempster, Murray and Sanderson, the Commissioner found the information unconvincing, even though LeBel believed Dempster&#x27;s interaction with Sanderson and Murray was inappropriate.

Jolliffe&#x27;s motives regarding his accusations, and his choice of words, were questioned for many years afterwards. In the late 1970s, when David Lewis was doing research for his &quot;Memoirs&quot;, he came across archival evidence proving the charge. Because of Lewis&#x27;s discovery, Drew&#x27;s son Edward, placed extremely restrictive conditions on his father&#x27;s papers housed in the Public Archives of Canada.

As Lewis pointed out in his memoirs, &quot;We found that Premier Drew and Gladstone Murray did not disclose all information to the Lebel Commission; indeed, they deliberately prevaricated throughout. The head of the Government of Ontario had given false witness under testimony... The perpetrator of Ontario&#x27;s Watergate got away with it.&quot;

===1945 election aftermath===
After the LeBel Report was published, the Ontario CCF still had to go on with the business of running the party, and hold its annual convention. It had been over 18 months since the previous provincial convention was held. The convention was held from Thursday, November 22, to Saturday, November 24 at the Toronto Labor Lyceum on Spadina Avenue. Jolliffe made it publicly known before the convention that he intended to continue as leader. He ran despite the elements within the party that blamed him for the election defeat. His critics charged that the CCF did not stress policy enough during the election; that the party&#x27;s platform was too vague, too leader-based, and was too reliant on slogans. Jolliffe was attacked for how he handled the last weeks of the campaign, especially over the &quot;Gestapo&quot; speech. These critics also blamed labour&#x27;s involvement in dumbing-down the campaign, which was seen as the trade unions doing anything to achieve power. It got so bad, that a motion to expel Jolliffe, and David Lewis over these perceived grievances made it on to the convention floor. The motion read, &quot;the campaign tactics of the 1945 election had been decided by Mr. Jolliffe with the advice of Mr. Lewis and the democratic processes within the CCF had been ignored.&quot; It was defeated, but it also demonstrated that the party&#x27;s establishment had angered its socialist militant base.

On Saturday afternoon, after the grievances were aired, the convention unanimously passed a resolution condemning Premier Drew asking him to stop spying on labour and political officials. After that, the party&#x27;s establishment candidates held on to their positions: University of Toronto professor, George Grube remained as president, while Jolliffe remained leader.

In 1946, there was major labour strife in Ontario, and the CCF made it clear they were on the side of the unionists. The party&#x27;s annual convention was held outside of Toronto for the first time. The convention was held at the Royal Connaught Hotel in Hamilton, Ontario from December 9–11, 1946, the city where the United Steelworkers of America (USWA) went through a long protracted strike about reducing the work-week to 40 hours. Jolliffe faced a leadership challenge at this convention from former Toronto Controller Lewis Duncan. There were rumblings in 1945 that Duncan would take over from Jolliffe, but that was rumoured to be only if he were able to defeat Drew in the High Park constituency, which he failed to do. As party chairman John Mitchell stated at the time, it wasn&#x27;t even close, as Jolliffe was easily re-elected CCF leader again for the fourth time. Professor Grube stepped down as the president, and Andrew Brewin succeeded him after defeating former York South MP, Joseph W. Noseworthy by four votes. The main resolution that would affect the upcoming provincial election was one that condemned Drew&#x27;s government for its hastily approved legislation allowing for cocktail bars to operate in Ontario.

===1948 Ontario general election===
Though the 1948 election came about a year sooner than normal, the Ontario CCF had been expecting this because of the polling information available that indicated that Drew&#x27;s popularity was falling. The CCF were able to rebound from their previous dismal election performance in 1945, and this time managed to get 21 members elected, including Jolliffe in York South, to again form the Official Opposition.

The real surprise was that Premier Drew lost his seat, even though his Progressive Conservatives won a majority. In his High Park constituency, Drew was up against his local nemesis William (Bill) Temple. Temple was a temperance campaigner and made Drew&#x27;s cocktail bar legislation the main campaign issue. Temple castigated Drew for softening Ontario&#x27;s liquor laws, claiming the Premier was the captive of &quot;liquor interests&quot; because of the government&#x27;s decision to allow liquor sales in cocktail bars. While Drew&#x27;s party swept to victory across the province, Drew was defeated by Temple, and decided to resign as premier and move to federal politics.

===1951 election disaster and its aftermath===
The CCF&#x27;s return to popularity was short-lived because of the prosperity of the 1950s and the anti-Communist hysteria of the Cold War. This rapid decline in their popularity reduced the party to two seats in the 1951 election and allowed the Ontario Liberal Party to become the Official Opposition. No social democratic party would be the Official Opposition again until 1975, when Stephen Lewis&#x27;s NDP displaced the Liberals as the second party in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario.

Beginning with the 1951 provincial campaign, the Ontario Federation of Labour (OFL) played an increased role in the Ontario CCF by lending it organizational, personnel and material support. The increasing role of the trade union leadership in the party was unpopular with some activists like MPP Bill Temple. The &quot;Ginger Group&quot; led by Temple, True Davidson and others was formed in the wake of the disastrous 1951 electoral result which they blamed on the &quot;bureaucratization&quot; of the party and its movement away from socialist principles and particularly socialist education, developments for which they held what they saw as the conservative, anti-democratic and bureaucratic influence of the OFL as responsible. At the party&#x27;s 1952 convention, Temple ran for party leader but withdrew at the last moment, allowing Jolliffe to be acclaimed leader. Temple did not stop from making trouble for the establishment, when he ran for party president, and almost won. He and Davidson were elected to the party executive as vice-presidents and the Ginger Group elected a number of its followers to the provincial council. They were unsuccessful in achieving their goals, however. The increasing role of the OFL in the Ontario CCF proved to be a precursor to the eventual fusion of the national CCF and the trade union movement with the creation of the New Democratic Party of Canada at the federal and provincial levels in 1961.

===End of the CCF/New Party and revival===
Donald C. MacDonald became leader in 1953, and spent the next years rebuilding the party, from two seats when he took over the party&#x27;s helm, to three in his first election and then five in 1959. Delegates from the Ontario CCF, delegates from affiliated union locals, and delegates from New Party Clubs took part in the founding convention of the New Democratic Party of Ontario held in Niagara Falls at the Sheraton Brock Hotel from 7–9 October 1961 and elected MacDonald as their leader. The Ontario CCF Council ceased to exist on Sunday, 8 October 1961, when the newly elected NDP executive officially took over. The rebuilding process continued under Macdonald who led a 20-person caucus by the time he stepped down in 1970.

==Election results==

==Leaders==

There was no party leader prior to 1942. From 1932 to 1934 Agnes Macphail, as chair of the Ontario CCF provincial council, was the main co-spokesperson. Her other co-spokesperson was Elmore Philpott – from 1933 to 1934 – as president of the Ontario Association of CCF Clubs. They were the most prominent figures in the Ontario party and acted as spokespersons until their March 1934 resignations.

From 1934 to 1942 the new position of Ontario CCF president was the party&#x27;s effective leader.

Ontario CCF president John Mitchell, a Hamilton alderman, led the party&#x27;s campaigns in the 1934 and 1937 Ontario elections.

From 1934 to 1937 Samuel Lawrence, MPP for Hamilton East led the party in the legislature as its sole MPP. Lawrence succeeded Mitchell as party president in 1941 and recommended that the party select a leader at its 1942 convention.

*1942-1952 - Ted Jolliffe, MPP for York South (1943-1945, 1948-1951)
*1953-1961 - Donald C. MacDonald, MPP for York South (1955-1982)

W. J. Grummett (Cochrane South) was House Leader of the CCF, leading the party in the Ontario Legislature from 1951, when Jolliffe lost his seat, until 1955, when MacDonald entered the legislature.

MacDonald became the first leader of the Ontario New Democratic Party when it was formed in 1961.

<doc id="1036177" wikidata="Q205979" url="?curid=1036177" title="Sogdian language">
<text>The Sogdian language was an Eastern Iranian language spoken mainly in the Central Asian region of Sogdia (capital: Samarkand; other chief cities: Panjakent, Fergana, Khujand, and Bukhara), located in modern-day Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan; it was also spoken by some Sogdian immigrant communities in ancient China. Sogdian is one of the most important Middle Iranian languages, along with Bactrian, Khotanese Saka, Middle Persian, and Parthian. It possesses a large literary corpus.

The Sogdian language is usually assigned to a Northeastern group of the Iranian languages. No direct evidence of an earlier version of the language (&quot;Old Sogdian&quot;) has been found, although mention of the area in the Old Persian inscriptions means that a separate and recognisable Sogdia existed at least since the Achaemenid Empire (559–323 BCE).

Like Khotanese, Sogdian may have possessed a more conservative grammar and morphology than Middle Persian. The modern Eastern Iranian language Yaghnobi is the descendant of a dialect of Sogdian spoken around the 8th century in Osrushana, a region to the south of Sogdia.

==History==
During the period of the Chinese Tang dynasty (ca. 7th century CE), Sogdian was the &quot;lingua franca&quot; in Central Asia of the Silk Road, along which it amassed a rich vocabulary of loanwords such as &quot;tym&quot; (&quot;hotel&quot;) from the Middle Chinese /tem/ ().

The economic and political importance of Sogdian guaranteed its survival in the first few centuries after the Muslim conquest of Sogdia in the early eighth century. A dialect of Sogdian spoken around the 8th century in Osrushana (capital: Bunjikat, near present-day Istaravshan, Tajikistan), a region to the south of Sogdia, developed into the Yaghnobi language and has survived into the 21st century. It is spoken by the Yaghnobi people.
==Discovery of Sogdian texts==
The first discovered Sogdian text was the Karabalgasun inscription, however, it was not understood until 1909 that it contained text in Sogdian.
Aurel Stein discovered 5 letters written in Sogdian known as the &quot;Ancient Letters&quot; in an abandoned watchtower near Dunhuang in 1907, dating to the end of the Western Jin dynasty. The finding of manuscript fragments of the Sogdian language in China&#x27;s Xinjiang region sparked the study of the Sogdian language. Robert Gauthiot, (the first Buddhist Sogdian scholar) and Paul Pelliot, (who while exploring in Dunhuang, retrieved Sogdian material) began investigating the Sogdian material that Pelliot had discovered in 1908. Gauthiot published many articles based on his work with Pelliot&#x27;s material, but died during the First World War. One of Gauthiot&#x27;s most impressive articles was a glossary to the Sogdian text, which he was in the process of completing when he died. This work was continued by Émile Benveniste after Gauthiot&#x27;s death.

Various Sogdian pieces have been found in the Turfan text corpus by the German Turfan expeditions. These expeditions were controlled by the Ethnological Museum of Berlin. These pieces consist almost entirely of religious works by Manichaean and Christian writers, including translations of the Bible. Most of the Sogdian religious works are from the 9th and 10th centuries.

Dunhuang and Turfan were the two most plentiful sites of Manichean, Buddhist, and Christian Sogdian texts. Sogdiana itself actually contained a much smaller collection of texts, discovered in the early 1930s near Mt. Mug in Tajikistan. These texts were business related, belonging to a minor Sogdian king, Divashtich. These business texts dated back to the time of the Muslim conquest, about 700.

Between 1996 and 2018, a number of inscribed fragments have been found at Kultobe in Kazakhstan. They date back to the Kangju culture, are significantly earlier than the 4th century A.D. and showcase an archaic state of Sogdian.

In the years between 2003 and 2020, three new bilingual Chinese-Sogdian epitaphs have been discovered and published.

==Writing system==
Like all the writing systems employed for Middle Iranian languages, the Sogdian alphabet ultimately derives from the Aramaic alphabet. Like its close relatives, the Pahlavi scripts, written Sogdian contains many logograms or ideograms, which were Aramaic words written to represent native spoken ones. The Sogdian script is the direct ancestor of the Old Uyghur alphabet, itself the forerunner of the Traditional Mongolian alphabet.

As in other writing systems descended from the Proto-Sinaitic script, there are no special signs for vowels. As in the parent Aramaic system, the consonantal signs ’ y w can be used as matres lectionis for the long vowels [a: i: u:] respectively. However, unlike it, these consonant signs would also sometimes serve to express the short vowels (which could also sometimes be left unexpressed, as they &quot;always&quot; are in the parent systems). To distinguish long vowels from short ones, an additional aleph could be written before the sign denoting the long vowel.

The Sogdian language also used the Manichaean alphabet, which consisted of 29 letters.

In transcribing Sogdian script into Roman letters, Aramaic ideograms are often noted by means of capitals.

==Phonology==

===Consonants=== 
The consonant inventory of Sogdian is as follows (parentheses mark allophones or marginal phonemes):

===Vowels===

Sogdian has the following simple vowels:

Sogdian also has three rhotacized vowels: ər, ir, ur.

The diphthongs in Sogdian are āi, āu, and those where the second element is a rhotacized vowel or a nasal element ṃ. 

==Morphology==

Sogdian has two different sets of endings for so-called &#x27;light&#x27; and &#x27;heavy&#x27; stems. A stem is heavy if it contains at least one heavy syllable (containing a long vowel or diphthong); stems containing only light vowels are light. In heavy stems, the stress falls on the stem, and in light stems, it falls on the suffix or ending.

<text>Thomas Langton Church (1873 – February 7, 1950) was a Canadian politician.

After serving as Mayor of Toronto from 1915 to 1921, he was elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1921 election as a Conservative from the riding of Toronto North. He was defeated in the 1930 election in Toronto West Centre, but returned to Parliament as Member of Parliament (MP) for Toronto East in a 1934 by-election. He remained in the House of Commons until his death in 1950.

As mayor, Church was strongly backed by the &quot;Toronto Telegram&quot; and opposed by the &quot;Toronto Daily Star&quot;. He was occasionally mocked in the pages of the &quot;Star&quot; by Ernest Hemingway who was, at the time, a reporter for the paper. Late in his career as an MP, Church denounced the newly formed United Nations as &quot;modern tower of Babel&quot;, for &quot;which Canada and Great Britain should not allow their interests to be the play thing.&quot;

In the House of Commons in June 1936, he protested against the requirement of bilingual banknotes in the Bank of Canada Act for banknotes to be introduced as the 1937 Series, stating there was no authority for it in the British North America Act, and that it had not been an issue during the 1935 federal election. He favoured printing dual-language banknotes (distinct English and French banknotes) as had been done for the 1935 Series. He was also a member of the Orange Order in Canada.

<doc id="1036187" wikidata="Q5544541" url="?curid=1036187" title="George Shiu Raj">
<text>George Shiu Raj is an Indo-Fijian former politician, who served as Minister for Multi-Ethnic Affairs from 2001 to 30 September 2004, when he resigned amid accusations of misuse of funds. At the time, he was the only Indo-Fijian minister in the Cabinet of Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase. On 8 September 2005, he was acquitted of charges of conspiracy to defraud the government and of obtaining money under false pretenses, and Prime Minister Qarase announced his decision to reappoint Raj to the Cabinet. He was duly sworn in by Vice-President Ratu Joni Madraiwiwi on 13 September.

Following the parliamentary election held on 6–13 May 2006, in which Raj retained his seat with a large majority, Prime Minister Qarase appointed him Minister for Women, Social Welfare, and Poverty Alleviation. This appointment was harshly criticised by Fiji Labour Party leader Mahendra Chaudhry. In a parliamentary debate on 8 June 2006, Chaudhry called the appointment of a male to head the Ministry for Women an &quot;act of violence&quot; against women, and called on Raj to resign.

== The misappropriation allegations and resignation ==
The allegations centred on a visit to India that Raj made early in 2004. According to a report from the Auditor-General, Raj had chosen not to fly business class, which the government had paid for, and had opted for the cheaper economy class. Raj had allegedly pocketed the difference, instead of refunding it to the government. He had also allegedly taken his official driver to India, and had taken excess per diem for his own extended stay there.

Raj told the Fiji Times that he was innocent of the charges, and that he had chosen to resign in order to protect the government. &quot;I have great respect for the Speaker of the House, the Parliament, Prime Minister and the nation,&quot; he said, &quot;and don&#x27;t want such allegations to tarnish their image. The only proper action is to resign voluntarily while the legal process and police investigations take place.&quot; He was sure that the ensuing police investigation would clear him.

Prime Minister Qarase accepted the resignation with regret, saying that Raj was one of his best-performing ministers. He announced that rather than replace Raj, he would take on responsibility for the Multi-Ethnic Affairs portfolio himself, pending the outcome of the police investigation. If exonerated by the inquiry, Raj might then be reinstated, Qarase said. He reiterated this position on 16 December 2004.

== Acquittal and reinstatement ==
On 23 August 2005, Raj appeared in court along with Sashi Sanjeev Pal, the managing director of Hunts Travel, on charges of conspiracy to defraud the government and of obtaining money (F$10,000) by false pretenses. Raj and Pal pleaded not guilty to both charges.

The trial of Raj and Pal began on 5 September. Department of Public Prosecutions lawyer Daniel Gounder told the three trial assessors that Raj and Pal had defrauded the government not once, but twice. Between 30 December 2001 and January 2002, the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office authorized Raj to travel to India on business class tickets, Gounder said. He alleged that rather than using the money (F$8363) to purchase a business class ticket for himself, he colluded with Pal to purchase three economy class tickets for himself, his wife Praveena Kumari, and one other man, Pundit Jayant Maharaj. On a second occasion, he alleged, Raj was again sponsored to fly business class, but opted for economy class, and pocketed the difference.

On 8 September 2005, Justice Gerard Winter declared that Raj and Pal had no case to answer and dismissed the charges. Winter ruled that there was no legal obligation for Cabinet Ministers to travel business class, and that payment for Raj&#x27;s trips were paid by the Fijian government, through the Indian government; at no time had Raj himself obtained any money illegally or dishonestly. Winter said that Raj had acted transparently and had hidden nothing. The fact that he had voluntarily resigned from the Cabinet and paid back the money he allegedly owed showed him to be a man of honesty and integrity, Winter said.

An emotional Raj thanked God, the Prime Minister, and his constituents for standing by him. He had always known that truth would prevail, he said. He encouraged other politicians to resign as he had, should they be accused of any kind of wrongdoing, and said he was glad to have cleared his name. &quot;Now that I&#x27;ve cleared my name I can get my reputation back,&quot; he said. Prime Minister Qarase told the Fiji Village news service that he would begin the process of readmitting Raj to the Cabinet in mid-September. The Department of Prosecutions, however, said that it would study the ruling and consider an appeal.

Raj&#x27;s acquittal generated criticism from a number of quarters. Opposition Leader Mahendra Chaudhry said that he still believed that Raj had abused state funds. &quot;Using State funds is a case of abuse. He should not have used it and nothing will change that fact. Abuse is abuse,&quot; Chaudhry said on 12 September. The same day, National Alliance Party Secretary Filipe Bole said the court&#x27;s decision was improper. He endorsed the judgement of Auditor-General Eroni Vatuloka that state entitlements were for the purpose of fulfilling civil service duties, and were not transferable to others. He also shared Vatuloka&#x27;s concerns that the judgement would adversely impact other court cases involving misappropriation of funds. Also on 12 September, the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions announced that the ruling would be appealed, as Opposition Leader Chaudhry had urged. The appeal was duly filed with the Court of Appeal on 12 April 2006. Lawyer Hemendra Nagin announced that he would represent Raj at the appeal, expected to be held in July.

== Other controversies ==
On 10 August 2005, Parliamentarian Lekh Ram Vayeshnoi of the opposition Fiji Labour Party accused Raj of cheating farmers in Ra Province of their sugarcane earnings by offering them loans. Raj denied the accusation, and invoked parliamentary standing orders. He said that most of the farmers he had helped were indigenous Fijians, and that many had increased their production from 50 tons to 200 or 300 tons.

== Background and career ==
Raj was first elected to represent the Ra Open Constituency in the House of Representatives as an independent candidate at the 1999 general election. He was appointed Minister for Multi-Ethnic Affairs in the interim Cabinet that was formed in the wake of the Fiji coup of 2000, and retained his seat as a candidate of the newly formed &quot;Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua&quot; (SDL) in the election held to restore democracy in September 2001. Raj generated outrage among his fellow Indo-Fijians in his Maiden speech (the speech typically made by a newly elected parliamentarian in Commonwealth countries). He said that Fiji had been given to the Fijian people by God and that they, not Indo-Fijians or others, were therefore entitled to govern the country. Many saw him as grovelling before the strongly pro-ethnic Fijian Qarase.</text><links>

<doc id="1036189" wikidata="Q259255" url="?curid=1036189" title=".303 British">
<text>The .303 British (designated as the 303 British by the C.I.P. and SAAMI) or 7.7×56mmR, is a calibre rimmed tapered bottleneck centerfire rifle cartridge. The .303-inch bore diameter is measured between rifling lands as is the common practice in Europe which follows the traditional black powder convention.

It was first manufactured in Britain as a stop-gap black powder round put into service in December 1888 for the Lee–Metford rifle. From 1891 the cartridge used smokeless powder which had been the intention from the outset, but the decision on which smokeless powder to adopt had been delayed. It was the standard British and Commonwealth military cartridge for rifles and machine guns from 1889 until it was replaced by the 7.62×51mm NATO in the 1950s.

==Cartridge specifications==
The .303 British has a 3.64 mL (56 gr H2O) cartridge case capacity. The pronounced tapering exterior shape of the case was designed to promote reliable case feeding and extraction in bolt-action rifles and machine guns alike, under challenging conditions.

Americans would define the shoulder angle at alpha/2 ≈ 17 degrees. The common rifling twist rate for this cartridge is , 5 grooves, Ø lands = , Ø grooves = , land width = and the primer type is Berdan or Boxer (in large rifle size).

According to official rulings of the (CIP), the .303 British can handle up to Pmax piezo pressure. In CIP-regulated countries every rifle cartridge combo has to be proofed at 125% of this maximum CIP pressure to certify for sale to consumers.
This means that .303 British chambered arms in CIP-regulated countries are, , proof tested at PE piezo pressure.

The Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers&#x27; Institute (SAAMI) maximum average pressure (MAP) for this cartridge is piezo pressure (45,000 CUP).

The measurement is the nominal size of the bore measured between the lands which follows the older black powder nomenclature. Measured between the grooves, the nominal size of the bore is . Bores for many .303 military surplus rifles are often found ranging from around . Recommended bullet diameter for standard .303 British cartridges is .

==Military use==
===History and development===
During a service life of over 70 years with the British Commonwealth armed forces, the .303-inch (7.7 mm) cartridge in its ball pattern progressed through ten marks, eventually extending to about 26 variations.
The bolt thrust of the .303 British is relatively low compared to many other service rounds used in the early 20th century.

===Propellant===
The original .303 British service cartridge employed black powder as a propellant, and was adopted for the Lee–Metford rifle, which had rifling designed to lessen fouling from this propellant, which replaced the Martini-Henry rifle in 1888. Some Martini-Henrys were rebarrelled to use the new .303 as the &quot;Martini–Metford&quot;.

The Lee–Metford was used as a trial platform by the British Committee on Explosives to experiment with many different smokeless powders then coming to market, including Ballistite, Cordite, and &quot;Rifleite&quot;. Ballistite was a stick-type smokeless powder composed of soluble nitrocellulose and nitroglycerine. Cordite was a stick-type or &#x27;chopped&#x27; smokeless gunpowder composed of nitroglycerine, gun-cotton, and mineral jelly, while &quot;Rifleite&quot; was a true nitrocellulose powder, composed of soluble and insoluble nitrocellulose, phenyl amidazobense, and volatiles similar to French smokeless powders. Unlike Cordite, &quot;Rifleite&quot; was a flake powder, and contained no nitroglycerine. Excessive wear of the shallow Metford rifling with all smokeless powders then available caused ordnance authorities to institute a new type of barrel rifling designed by the Royal Small Arms Factory at Enfield, to increase barrel life; the redesigned rifle introduced in 1895 as the Lee–Enfield. After extensive testing, the Committee on Explosives selected Cordite for use in the Mark II .303 British service cartridge.

===Projectile===
The initial .303 Mark I and Mk II service cartridges used a , round-nosed, copper-nickel full metal jacketed bullet with a lead core. After tests determined that the service bullet had too thin a jacket when used with cordite, the Mk II bullet was introduced, with a flat base and thicker copper-nickel jacket.

===Mark II – Mark VI===
The Mk II round-nosed bullet was found to be unsatisfactory when used in combat, particularly when compared to the &quot;dum-dum&quot; expanding bullet rounds issued in limited numbers in 1897 during the Chitral and Tirah expeditions of 1897–98 on the North West Frontier of India. This led to the 1898 introduction of the &quot;Cartridge S.A. ball .303 inch Cordite Mark III&quot;, basically the original 215-grain (13.9 g) bullet with the jacketing cut back to expose the lead in the nose. The Mk III load, however, was almost immediately withdrawn as a result of production issues leading to the introduction of the similar Mk IV hollow-point loading in February of the next year, which was put into mass production in Britain, Canada and New Zealand. Following the pivotal Battle of Omdurman of the Mahdist War, Major Mathias of the Royal Army Medical Corps observed a young man who had been struck twice by Mark IV bullets:

The design of the Mk IV hollow-point bullet shifted bullet weight rearwards, improving stability and accuracy over the regular round-nose bullet. These soft-nosed and hollow-point bullets, while effective against human targets, had a tendency to shed the outer metal jacket upon firing; the latter occasionally stuck in the bore, causing a dangerous obstruction. This was addressed by the introduction of a revised Mk V loading later in October (controversially so, as by August the Hague Convention had already made the military implementation of such expanding bullets illegal) identical to the Mark IV round apart from the addition of 2% antimony to the lead core and an additional 1.3 mm in length.

The concern about expanding bullets was brought up at the Hague Convention of 1899 by Swiss and Dutch representatives. The Swiss were concerned about small arms ammunition that &quot;increased suffering&quot;, and the Dutch focused on the British Mark III .303 loading in response to their treatment of Boer settlers in South Africa. The British and American defence was that they should not focus on specific bullet designs, like hollow-points, but instead on rounds that caused &quot;superfluous injury&quot;. The parties in the end agreed to abstain from using expanding bullets. With the use of expanding bullets against signatories of the convention deemed inhumane, the Mk III, Mk IV, and Mk V were withdrawn from active service. The remaining stocks (over 45 million rounds) were used for target practice. The Mark III and other expanding versions of the .303 were not issued during the Second Boer War (1899–1902). Boer guerrillas allegedly used expanding hunting ammunition against the British during the war, and New Zealand Commonwealth troops may have brought Mark III rounds with them privately after the Hague Convention without authorization.

To replace the Mk III, IV, and V, the &quot;Mark VI&quot; round was introduced in 1904, using a round nose bullet similar to the Mk II, but with a thinner jacket designed to produce some expansion, though this proved not to be the case.

===Mark VII===
In 1898, Atelier de Construction de Puteaux (APX), with their &quot;Balle D&quot; design for the 8×50mmR Lebel cartridge, revolutionised bullet design with the introduction of pointed &quot;spitzer&quot; rounds. In addition to being pointed, the bullet was also much lighter in order to deliver a higher muzzle velocity. It was found that as velocity increased the bullets suddenly became much more deadly.

In 1910, the British took the opportunity to replace their Mk VI cartridge with a more modern design. The &quot;Mark VII&quot; loading used a pointed bullet with a flat-base. The .303 British Mark VII cartridge was loaded with of Cordite MDT 5-2 (cordite MD pressed into tubes) and had a muzzle velocity of and a maximum range of approximately . The Mk VII was different from earlier .303 bullet designs or spitzer projectiles in general. Although it appears to be a conventional spitzer-shape full metal jacket bullet, this appearance is deceptive: its designers made the front third of the interior of the Mk 7 bullets out of aluminium (from Canada) or &quot;tenite&quot; (cellulosic plastic), wood pulp or compressed paper, instead of lead and they were autoclaved to prevent wound infection. This lighter nose shifted the centre of gravity of the bullet towards the rear, making it tail heavy. Although the bullet was stable in flight due to the gyroscopic forces imposed on it by the rifling of the barrel, it behaved very differently upon hitting the target. As soon as the bullet hit the target and decelerated, its heavier lead base caused it to pitch violently and deform, thereby inflicting more severe gunshot wounds than a standard single-core spitzer design. The Mk VII bullet was considered to be in compliance of the Hague Convention as its metal jacket completely covered the cores. The convention only prohibited &quot;the use of bullets which can easily expand or change their form inside the human body such as bullets with a hard covering which does not completely cover the core...&quot;. It was noted by German Professor K. Stargardt in December 1914 that the Mk VII bullet would routinely &quot;...disintegrate on the lightest contact with a firm body, such as a bone,&quot; resulting in an &quot;explosive effect,&quot; and leaving artillery-like fragmentation in the body.

The &quot;Mk VIIz&quot; (and later Mk VIIIz) rounds have versions utilizing Dupont No. 16 single-base smokeless powder based on nitrocellulose flake shaped propellants. The nitrocellulose versions—first introduced in World War I—were designated with a &quot;z&quot; postfix indicated after the type (e.g. Mark VIIz, with a bullet weight of ) and in headstamps.

====.276 Enfield====
.303 British cartridges, along with the Lee–Enfield rifle, were heavily criticized after the Second Boer War. Their heavy round-nosed bullets had low muzzle velocities and suffered compared to the 7×57mm rounds fired from the Mauser Model 1895. The high-velocity 7×57mm had a flatter trajectory and longer range that excelled on the open country of the South African plains. In 1910, work began on a long-range replacement cartridge, which emerged in 1912 as the .276 Enfield. The British also sought to replace the Lee–Enfield rifle with the Pattern 1913 Enfield rifle, based on the Mauser M98 bolt action design. Although the round had better ballistics, troop trials in 1913 revealed problems including excessive recoil, muzzle flash, barrel wear and overheating. Attempts were made to find a cooler-burning propellant, but further trials were halted in 1914 by the onset of World War I. As a result, the Lee–Enfield rifle was retained, and the .303 British cartridge (with the improved Mark VII loading) was kept in service.

===Mark VIIIz===
In 1938 the &quot;Mark VIIIz&quot; &quot;streamline ammunition&quot; round was approved to obtain greater range from the Vickers machine gun. The streamlined bullet was based on the 7.5×55mm Swiss GP11 projectiles and slightly longer and heavier than the Mk VII bullet at , the primary difference was the addition of a boat tail at the end of the bullet and using of nitrocellulose smokeless powder as propellant in the case of the Mk VIIIz, giving a muzzle velocity of . As a result, the chamber pressure was higher, at , depending upon loading, compared to the of the Mark VII(z) round. The Mark VIIIz streamline ammunition had a maximum range of approximately . Mk VIIIz ammunition was described as being for &quot;All suitably-sighted .303-inch small arms and machine guns&quot; – rifles and Bren guns were proofed at – but caused significant bore erosion in weapons formerly using Mk VII ammunition, ascribed to the channelling effect of the boat-tail projectile. As a result, it was prohibited from general use with rifles and light machine guns except when low flash was important and in emergencies. As a consequence of the official prohibition, ordnance personnel reported that every man who could get his hands on Mk VIIIz ammunition promptly used it in his own rifle.

===Tracer, armour-piercing and incendiary===
Tracer and armour-piercing cartridges were introduced during 1915, with explosive Pomeroy bullets introduced as the Mark VII.Y in 1916.

Several incendiaries were privately developed from 1914 to counter the Zeppelin threat but none were approved until the Brock design late in 1916 as BIK Mark VII.K Wing Commander Frank Brock RNVR, its inventor, was a member of the Brock fireworks-making family. Anti-zeppelin missions typically used machine guns loaded with a mixture of Brock bullets containing potassium chlorate, Pomeroy bullets containing dynamite, and Buckingham bullets containing pyrophoric yellow phosphorus. A later incendiary was known as the de Wilde, which had the advantage of leaving no visible trail when fired. The de Wilde was later used in some numbers in fighter guns during the 1940 Battle of Britain.

These rounds were extensively developed over the years and saw several Mark numbers. The last tracer round introduced into British service was the G Mark 8 in 1945, the last armour-piercing round was the W Mark 1Z in 1945 and the last incendiary round was the B Mark 7 in 1942. Explosive bullets were not produced in the UK after 1933 due to the relatively small amount of explosive that could be contained in the bullet, limiting their effectiveness, their role being taken by the use of Mark 6 and 7 incendiary bullets.

In 1935, the .303 O Mark 1 Observing round was introduced for use in machine guns. The bullet to this round was designed to break up with a puff of smoke on impact. The later Mark 6 and 7 incendiary rounds could also be used in this role.

During World War I British factories alone produced 7,000,000,000 rounds of .303 ammunition. Factories in other countries added greatly to this total.
===Pencils===

Spent .303 cartridges were used to make cases of the bullet pencils included in some of the Princess Mary Christmas gift boxes given to troops in World War 1.

==Japanese 7.7 mm ammunition==

Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service adopted Ro-Go Ko-gata seaplane armed with a .303 MG in 1918, and the calibre was common on surplus Entente aircraft acquired by the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service after WWI, so its usage continued during the Interbellum, and on naval aircraft even throughout WWII. Japan produced a number of machine guns that were direct copies of the British Lewis (Japanese Type 92 machine gun) and Vickers machine guns as well as ammunition for them. The 7.7 mm cartridge used by the Japanese versions of the British guns is a direct copy of the .303 British (7.7×56mmR) rimmed cartridge and is distinctly different from the 7.7×58mm Arisaka rimless and 7.7×58mm Type 92 semi-rimmed cartridges used in other Japanese machine guns and rifles.

Note: standard Japanese ball ammunition was very similar to the British Mk 7 cartridge. The two had identical bullet weights and a &quot;tail-heavy&quot; design, as can be seen in the cut-away diagram.

==Civilian use==
The .303 cartridge has seen much sporting use with surplus military rifles, especially in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and to a lesser extent in the United States and South Africa. In Canada, it was found to be adequate for any game. In Australia, it was common for military rifles to be re-barrelled in .303/25 and .303/22. However the .303 round still retains a considerable following as a game cartridge for all game species, especially Sambar deer in wooded country. A change.org petition asking Lithgow Arms to chamber the LA102 centrefire rifle in .303 as a special edition release has attracted considerable attention both in Australia and worldwide. In South Africa, .303 Lee–Enfield rifles captured by the Boers during the Boer War were adapted for sporting purposes and became popular with many hunters of non-dangerous game, being regarded as adequate for anything from the relatively small impala to the massive eland and kudu.

===Commercial ammunition ===


The .303 British is one of the few (along with the .22 Hornet, .30-30 Winchester, and 7.62×54mmR) bottlenecked rimmed centrefire rifle cartridges still in common use today. Most of the bottleneck rimmed cartridges of the late 1880s and 1890s fell into disuse by the end of the First World War. Commercial ammunition for weapons chambered in .303 British is readily available, as the cartridge is still manufactured by major producers such as Remington, Federal, Winchester, Sellier &amp; Bellot, Denel-PMP, Prvi Partizan and Wolf. Commercially produced ammunition is widely available in various full metal jacket bullet, soft point, hollow point, flat-based and boat tail designs, both spitzer and round-nosed.

===Hunting use===
The .303 British cartridge is suitable for all medium-sized game and is an excellent choice for whitetail deer and black bear hunting. In Canada it was a popular moose and deer cartridge when military surplus rifles were available and cheap; it is still used. The .303 British can offer very good penetrating ability due to a fast twist rate that enables it to fire long, heavy bullets with a high sectional density. Canadian Rangers use it for survival and polar bear protection. In 2015, the Canadian Rangers began the process to evaluate rifles chambered for .308 Winchester. The Canadian Department of National Defence has since replaced the previously issued Lee–Enfield No. 4 rifles with the Colt Canada C19 chambered as evaluated in 7.62×51mm NATO/.308 Winchester.

==Rounds developed from .303==
===Pre-WWI sporting rounds===
During the 1890s, Scottish gunsmith Daniel Fraser developed a rimless version of the cartridge known as &quot;.303 Fraser Velox&quot; or &quot;.303 Fraser Rimless&quot;, loaded with a bullet of his own oblique ratchet design to enhance expansion which was patented in 1897 The bullet was also used in a proprietary loading of .303 British marketed as &quot;.303 Fraser Flanged&quot;.

Proprietary loadings of .303 British include the &quot;.303 Marksman&quot; by Eley Brothers from before 1908. and &quot;.303 Swift&quot; from before 1911.

In 1899, the British service round was lengthened and necked-out to create the .375 Flanged Nitro Express hunting cartridge for single-shot and double rifles. Around 1905, it was necked down back to create .375/303 Westley Richards Accelerated Express.

===Post-1917 military experiments===
In 1917, design work started on a more powerful military cartridge of the same calibre and overall length. In 1918 it was planned that the new round, also retaining the old rim diameter, would be used in rechambered P14 rifles with AP rounds to defeat German targets on the battlefield of WWI as well as in the RAF in modified Lewis gun. The cartridge was &quot;produced in quantity&quot; but not adopted formally. The case was 62mm long with the bullet (a Ball Mark VII or Mark VIIW) set deep within to keep overall length down. The ordinary round was designated &quot;Cartridge S.A. ball .303 inch Rimless&quot; despite the fact that it retained headspacing on its rim and was semi-rimmed. It is better known today under names like &quot;.303 Lewis Semi-Rimmed&quot;.
===Post-1945 Australian wildcats===
After WWII, Australians found themselves with quite a few .303&quot; service rifles but at the same time new legal restrictions on military ammunition, which led to development of many wildcat rounds, the best-known of which are .303/25 and .303/22.
===Post-1945 South African developments===
In parallel to Australia, the same wildcatting was happening in other countries of the Commonwealth, and in 1969 Pretoria Metal Pressings started factory production of a .303 necked down to 6 mm (.243&quot;) under the name of 6 mm Musgrave.
===.303 Epps===
Canadian Ellwood Epps, founder of Epps Sporting Goods, created an improved version of the .303 British. It has better ballistic performance than the standard .303 British cartridge. This is accomplished by increasing the shoulder angle from 16 to 35 degrees, and reducing the case taper from to . These changes increase the case&#x27;s internal volume by approximately 9%. The increased shoulder angle and reduced case taper eliminate the drooping shoulders of the original .303 British case, which, combined with reaming the chamber to .303 Epps, improves case life.

<doc id="1036197" wikidata="Q70390" url="?curid=1036197" title="Matthias Goerne">
<text>Matthias Goerne (born 31 March 1967) is a German baritone. He has performed and recorded extensively, both on the opera stage and in Lieder settings. Goerne has been referred to as &quot;Today&#x27;s leading interpreter of German art songs&quot; by the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, while the &quot;Boston Globe&quot; describes him as &quot;one of the greatest singers performing today&quot;.

Prominent opera stages on which Goerne has appeared include the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden; Teatro Real, Madrid; Paris National Opera; Vienna State Opera; and the Metropolitan Opera, New York. His carefully chosen roles range from Wolfram (&quot;Tannhäuser&quot;), Amfortas (&quot;Parsifal&quot;), Kurwenal (&quot;Tristan&quot;) and Orest (&quot;Electra&quot;) right up to the title roles in Alban Berg&#x27;s &quot;Wozzeck&quot;, Bartók&#x27;s &quot;Bluebeard&#x27;s Castle&quot;, Hindemith&#x27;s &quot;Mathis der Maler&quot; and Reimann&#x27;s &quot;Lear&quot;.

In Lieder settings, he has worked with many pre-eminent pianists, including Alfred Brendel, Vladimir Ashkenazy, Daniil Trifonov and Seong-Jin Cho.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Goerne was born in Weimar. He grew up in a musical environment, his father being a dramaturgist and director of several acting theaters in Dresden. His first instrument was the cello, but he soon switched to singing. At the age of 9 he determined that he wanted to become a professional singer. He sang in the children&#x27;s choirs of several of his father&#x27;s theater productions, including Carmen and La Bohème. From the age of 18 to 22 he studied voice in Leipzig under . He would later refer to Beyer as being his most important teacher, and as the one who enabled him to start winning competitions. In 1989, he won second prize in the Robert Schumann Competition and first prizes in the Salomon-Lindberg and Hugo Wolf competitions. Two years into his studies, he won a singing competition in West Berlin. The head of the jury, composer and pianist Aribert Reimann, introduced him to Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, whom Goerne considered his idol and the greatest artist he knew. He was to receive singing lessons from Fischer-Dieskau for 3 years. Next, he studied with Elisabeth Schwarzkopf for two and a half to three years.

===Career===
====1990s====
Goerne made his professional début in Leipzig in 1990 after being invited by Kurt Masur to sing in Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s St. Matthew Passion.

Goerne made his Salzburg Festival début in 1997 (Papageno).

====2000s====
From 2001 through 2005, Goerne taught as an honorary professor of song interpretation at the Robert Schumann Hochschule in Düsseldorf. In 2001, he was appointed an Honorary Member of the Royal Academy of Music in London.

====2010s====
In the late 2000s to 2014, he recorded a selection of Schubert lieder, &quot;The Goerne/Schubert Edition&quot; on 12 CDs, for Harmonia Mundi. The final volume, published in December 2014, received the highest rating in BBC Music magazine and a &quot;Diapason d&#x27;Or&quot;. His recording of Hanns Eisler lieder was awarded a &quot;Diapason d&#x27;Or de l&#x27;Année&quot; the same year.

Highlights of the 2011/12 season included a tour with the Vienna Philharmonic, appearances at the Vienna State Opera and the Saito Kinen Festival (Bluebeard with Seiji Ozawa) and song recitals with Christoph Eschenbach, and Leif Ove Andsnes in Paris, Vienna and New York (Carnegie Hall).

From 2012 to 2013, Goerne sang Wolfram at the Bavarian State Opera and Amfortas in concert with the Teatro Real in Madrid. Concert highlights included appearances with the Orchestre de Paris (Bluebeard), Berlin Philharmonic (War Requiem), Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra (Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony), Filarmonica del Teatro alla Scala (Mahler Lieder), Israel Philharmonic, and San Francisco Symphony (Wagner arias) as well as song recitals with Pierre-Laurent Aimard and Schubert cycles with Christoph Eschenbach at the Vienna Musikverein.

====2020s====

In 2020, Goerne signed with Deutsche Grammophon for a trilogy of Lieder albums released in 2020, 2021 and 2022 with pianists Jan Lisiecki, Seong-Jin Cho and Daniil Trifonov, respectively.

In 2021, German composer Detlev Glanert composed a setting for voice and orchestra of the poem &quot;Der Einsiedler&quot; (the hermit) by Joseph von Eichendorff especially for Goerne. It was performed by Goerne and the Concertgebouworkest under conductor Jaap van Zweden to critical acclaim.

===Personal life===

Goerne has an adopted son born in 1989, and a daughter born in 2000. His first marriage ended in divorce.

He smoked cigarettes &quot;a lot&quot; early in life, but stopped after noting the detrimental effects on his voice.

Goerne is not religious, although he does &quot;have beliefs&quot;.

==Views on music==

Goerne has criticized the modern day relevance of opera productions, going so far as to state that most popular operas should not be performed at all anymore because they have become outdated, no longer having &quot;enough substance for the questions posed by our society&quot;.

He has expressed a distaste for most contemporary art music from a vocal perspective, claiming that its focus on using the extremes of the voice, &quot;singing very high or very low, very loud or very quietly&quot;, is not conducive to the expression of thoughts and feelings. Furthermore, he opines that this style of vocal writing makes pieces &quot;boring and one-dimensional&quot;.

Goerne has expressed a preference for working with solo pianists over pianists who specialize in accompaniment, citing the former&#x27;s superior artistic vision and the latter&#x27;s relative lack of technical proficiency.

==Awards and honors==

Goerne is a recipient of the Wigmore Hall, London, medal.

<doc id="1036200" wikidata="Q787305" url="?curid=1036200" title="Tokyo Metro Yūrakuchō Line">
<text>The is a subway line in Japan owned and operated by Tokyo Metro. The line connects Wakōshi Station in Wakō, Saitama and Shin-Kiba Station in Kōtō, Tokyo. On maps, diagrams and signboards, the line is shown using the color &quot;gold&quot;, and its stations are given numbers using the letter &quot;Y&quot;.

The line was named after the Yūrakuchō business district in Chiyoda, Tokyo. The proper name as given in an annual report of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport is . According to the Tokyo urban transportation plan, however, it is more complicated. The line number assigned to the section south from Kotake-Mukaihara to Shin-Kiba is Line 8, but that north of Kotake-Mukaihara to Wakōshi is Line 13, which indicates the section is a portion of Fukutoshin Line which shares the same number.

==Services==
The Yurakucho Line runs generally northwest to southeast between Wakōshi Station in Saitama Prefecture and Shin-Kiba Station in Kōtō Ward. Although it was originally planned as a bypass for the established Marunouchi Line through central Tokyo, it was also built to serve the developing wards of Itabashi, Nerima, Toshima, and Koto. The section between Wakōshi and Kotake-mukaihara shares tracks with its sister line, the Tokyo Metro Fukutoshin Line.

The Yurakucho Line has inter-running counterparts on its northern side, both of which are &quot;major&quot; Japanese private railway companies in Greater Tokyo. One is the Tobu Railway at Wakōshi, north to . The other is the Seibu Railway at with its bypass line Seibu Yūrakuchō Line connecting to its main Ikebukuro Line, through trains north to or .

According to the Tokyo Metropolitan Bureau of Transportation, as of June 2009 the Yurakucho Line is the fifth most crowded subway line in Tokyo, at its peak running at 173% capacity between Higashi-Ikebukuro and Gokokuji stations.

 services ran on the Yurakucho Line between June 14, 2008 and March 6, 2010, operating twice hourly between Wakōshi and Shin-Kiba. Between Wakōshi and Ikebukuro, semi-express trains stopped only at Kotake-Mukaihara; between Ikebukuro and Shin-Kiba, trains stopped at all stations. The semi-express trains ran between rush hours during weekdays and more frequently on weekends and holidays. These services were abolished and replaced with local services on March 6, 2010.

==History==
The Yurakucho line was first proposed in 1962 along with the Chiyoda Line. It was originally envisioned to run between Nakamurabashi Station and Kinshicho Station. In 1968, it was later revised to run between Chikatetsu-narimasu Station in the northwest and Shintomichō Station in the southeast; the extensions to Wakoshi and Shin-kiba were not confirmed at the time.

Line 8 was planned to serve areas that were not served by the Tokyo subway network such as Nerima and Koto Wards, while providing an adequate bypass for the overcrowding Marunouchi Line from Ikebukuro to Ginza-itchōme. This initial section began construction in 1970 and opened for revenue service on 30 October 1974 as the Yūrakuchō Line. In the late 1970s, the extensions towards Wakoshi and Shin-kiba were authorized. On 27 March 1980, the second section between Ginza-itchōme and Shintomichō section opened, while the third section between Eidan-narimasu (now Chikatetsu-narimasu) and Ikebukuro opened on 24 June 1983.

Through services with the Seibu Railway Seibu Yūrakuchō Line began on 1 October 1983 with the opening of the Kotake-Mukaihara – Shin-Sakuradai section. The northwestern extension to Wakōshi opened on 25 August 1987, allowing through service with the Tōbu Tōjō Line. The final section from Shintomichō to Shin-kiba opened on 8 June 1988, completing the current line.

On 18 March 1993, 07 series EMUs introduced. On 7 December 1994, the &quot;Yūrakuchō New Line&quot; (now the Fukutoshin Line) opened from Kotake-mukaihara to Ikebukuro. All trains on it made Ikebukuro their terminus and did not stop at Senkawa or Kanamechō. Through service from Shin-kiba or Ikebukuro (on the New Line) to on the Seibu Yūrakuchō Line began on that same day, with through operation to the Seibu Ikebukuro Line beyond Nerima beginning on 26 March 1998.

On 1 April 2004, the owner of the line changed from Teito Rapid Transit Authority (TRTA, &quot;Eidan&quot;) to Tokyo Metro due to the former&#x27;s privatization. Women-only cars were introduced on 31 October 2005. 10000 series were introduced to the line on 1 September 2006.

On 3 May 2008, Limited Express &quot;Bay Resort&quot; (operated first from/to Odakyu Line) services began operating. On 14 June 2008, the Tokyo Metro Fukutoshin Line began service, and the Yurakuchō New Line was absorbed into it. The Yurakuchō Line shares tracks with the Fukutoshin Line between Wakōshi and Kotake-Mukaihara. Semi-Express services began running until they were abolished on 6 March 2010.

In October 2008, Automatic train control was enabled on the Yurakuchō Line. On 10 September 2012, 10-car 5050-4000 series sets entered revenue service on the Yurakucho Line, with inter-running through to the Tobu Tojo Line. Since March 26, 2017, Seibu operates the &quot;S-Train&quot; limited-stop express service between Toyosu and Tokorozawa on the Seibu Ikebukuro Line on weekday mornings and evenings.

On 6 August 2022, &quot;Wanman&quot; one-person operation began on the section between Kotake-Mukaihara and Shin-Kiba
===Future developments===
In 2021, plans were announced to branch the Yurakucho line at Toyosu Station, traveling north for connecting with on the Tozai Line and Sumiyoshi Station on the Shinjuku Line and Hanzomon Line. An additional two stations (Edagawa and Sengoku) would also be added in the Koto Ward serving the Sengoku and Toyo districts. Tentative names for the new stations were determined in August 2022. The branch line (nicknamed the Toyozumi Line according to official city documents) is intended to aid in redevelopment efforts in Koto Ward. As of 28 January 2022 the expected cost of construction is ¥269 billion (2021). There are also plans for a spur branching off from the planned Tokyo Rinkai Subway line at Kachidoki to link up to the future Toyozumi Line (Yurakucho Line branch) platforms at Toyosu Station. The branch line is expected to be in service in the mid-2030s. 

A branch line from Toyosu Station has been planned since the early 1980s, heading north via Kameari Station (on the Jōban Line) to Noda in northwest Chiba Prefecture.

<doc id="1036203" wikidata="Q7368660" url="?curid=1036203" title="Roses Tournament">
<text>The Roses Tournament is an annual varsity sports competition between Lancaster University and the University of York in England, often described as the largest inter-university sports tournament in Europe. It is organised by their respective Students&#x27; Unions, LUSU and YUSU. It takes its name from the 15th-century civil war, the Wars of the Roses, between the House of Lancaster and the House of York. The counties of Lancashire and Yorkshire are traditionally symbolized by the red and the white rose respectively, although some York teams play in gold and black kits. The competition is held every year during the early May bank holiday weekend, alternating its venue between the two universities.

==History==
The first event happened on 15 May 1965 after the Vice-Chancellor of York, Lord James of Rusholme, suggested a boat race between the two universities. The students amplified this idea and held a 5-day event with a variety of sports: rowing, table tennis, relay race, mixed field hockey, and tug of war. The winner of each of the sports received two points, and the losing vice-chancellor presented a trophy to the winning university.
The event has continued to increase in size since its founding, with new events added every year (2004 had 37 different sports). Live coverage of the event is broadcast every year by a collaboration between the two universities&#x27; student television stations YSTV and LA1:TV, and their two student radio stations, Bailrigg FM and University Radio York. The importance of non-sporting social activities at the event has also been increased, with organised events on the Friday and Saturday evenings.

In 1989, Roses celebrated its silver Jubilee with rugby, rowing, a boat race and tug of war some of the 30 sports. York won the tournament by 101-97 with a 3-1 win in the soccer securing the win. 

In the 2012 tournament a stadium was used for the first time. The Rugby 1sts XV battled it out at Huntington Stadium, the home of the York City Knights. During the 2013 tournament York opted to use the same venue again, for the second year running.

The Lancaster University Men&#x27;s Hockey Club 4th Team, Lancaster Bombers American Football team and the Lancaster Trampolining team were the only teams to remain unbeaten in the history of the tournament to date going into Roses 2012, however all three teams lost to their York counterparts in 2012.

For the 50th battle of the Roses in 2014, the tournament was hosted at Lancaster. Lancaster created a purpose built stadium for first time which hosted the opening and closing ceremony, as well as fixtures including women&#x27;s rugby, men&#x27;s rugby and archery. 

The 2015 tournament was officially opened by England football team manager Roy Hodgson and Football Association chairman Greg Dyke. The opening ceremony, which featured a series of boxing matches dubbed &#x27;Friday Night Fight Night&#x27;, was watched by 1,000 people in the University of York&#x27;s Central Hall, with a further 5,000 people watching on large screens across campus. It was also the first year that one university had scored more than 200 points; however more point scoring activities are present now compared to 50 years ago.

Esports were introduced to the tournament for the first time in 2016 in the form of &quot;League of Legends&quot;, &quot;Dota 2&quot; and &quot;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive&quot;.

The 2018 tournament saw the introduction of dodgeball and golf to the competition, as won by the Lancaster Royals.

In March 2020 it was announced that the event would be cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, a competition was held with the Roses tournament being replaced by a Virtual Roses tournament which was won by York.

The first Roses following the COVID-19 pandemic saw the largest win margin of the tournament&#x27;s history as Lancaster beat York 241 points to 102.

==Results==

*Lancaster: 29 wins (24 home, 5 away)
*York: 28 wins (24 home, 4 away)

In past years, croquet is usually played between &quot;executive&quot; teams comprising some combination of chancellors, vice-chancellors and Students&#x27; Union presidents, and does not contribute any points to the overall score. In some years, this has been replaced with crown green bowls.

<text>In economics, the Hicks–Marshall laws of derived demand assert that, other things equal, the own-wage elasticity of demand for a category of labor is high under the following conditions:
* When the price elasticity of demand for the product being produced is high (scale effect). So when final product demand is elastic, an increase in wages will lead to a large change in the quantity of the final product demanded affecting employment greatly.
* When other factors of production can be easily substituted for the category of labor (substitution effect).
* When the supply of other factors of production is highly elastic (that is, usage of other factors of production can be increased without substantially increasing their prices) (substitution effect). That is, employers can easily replace labor as doing so will only moderately increase other factor prices.
* When the cost of employing the category of labor is a large share of the total costs of production (scale effect)

The &quot;Hicks–Marshall&quot; is named for economists John Hicks (from &quot;The Theory of Wages&quot;, 1932) and Alfred Marshall (from &quot;Principles of Economics&quot;, 1890).

<doc id="1036208" wikidata="Q1215549" url="?curid=1036208" title="Against the Ropes">
<text>Against the Ropes is a 2004 American sports drama film directed by Charles S. Dutton (in his feature film directorial debut) and starring Meg Ryan and Omar Epps. The story is a fictionalized account of boxing manager Jackie Kallen, the first woman to achieve success in the sport. Kallen has a bit part in the film playing a reporter, and a few lines in the scene where the press interviews the principal characters.

The film was shot primarily at the Wolstein Center in Cleveland, Ohio, United States and Hamilton, Ontario, Canada at the Copps Coliseum. &quot;Against the Ropes&quot; grossed less than $6 million in the US and was panned by critics for its resemblance to other boxing films.

==Plot==

At a young age, Jackie Kallen learns about boxing with her father and uncle in a small gym. Later, she becomes assistant to a Cleveland boxing promoter. Her boss then begins doing business with Sam LaRocca, a sports manager, during a middleweight championship fight.

Challenged after the contest to demonstrate an understanding of the fight game, she proceeds to embarrass LaRocca, who then offers to sell the loser&#x27;s contract to her for the price of one dollar. She accepts, only to discover upon visiting the fighter in his home that he is addicted to drugs and enmeshed in a dangerous and self-destructive lifestyle.

Enter Luther Shaw, a small-time hood. Kallen watches in horror and fascination as Shaw pummels the former middleweight champ. She offers to manage him professionally. Shaw is at first hesitant, but eventually signs on with her.

Because of LaRocca&#x27;s influence, Kallen can&#x27;t find Shaw a fight anywhere in Ohio, so the two are forced to go on the road until Shaw makes a name for himself. Jackie begins to get swept up in all the attention she gets for being the first female boxing manager. Her attention eventually shifts from Shaw to her own media persona as her fighter&#x27;s number of wins continues to climb.

Finally realizing that she is not paying enough attention to her only client, Kallen agrees to sell Shaw&#x27;s contract to LaRocca on the condition that he be given a championship fight. LaRocca agrees, setting Shaw up for a shot at the title before he could be ready. Kallen arrives at the fight and stands in Shaw&#x27;s corner as he pulls off an upset and wins the championship.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Against the Ropes&quot; was a box office bomb, grossing only $6,614,280, with an estimated budget of $39,000,000. It opened up at No. 8 at the box office, grossing $3,038,546 in the opening weekend. The film was released on February 20, 2004 to 1,601 theaters (widest release) gathering an average of $1,897 per theater. The film closed its box office run after seven weeks, gathering a total of $5,884,190 from the domestic market and $730,090 from overseas for an international total of $6,614,280.

===Critical response===
The film garnered negative reviews from critics. It received a approval rating on review aggregate Rotten Tomatoes, based on reviews with an average rating of , summarizing it as &quot;a bland, dumbed-down package of sports cliches.&quot; On Metacritic, it holds a score of 36 out of 100 based on 36 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;.

A. O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; commended the performances for displaying &quot;flashes of idiosyncrasy and flair&quot; despite the &quot;pedestrian script&quot; but was critical of the film overall for having various &quot;inspirational sports-movie clichés&quot; and &quot;competence that is more flat-footed than inspiring&quot; in both the drama and boxing scenes. Marrit Ingman of &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; found Ryan &quot;predictably fine&quot; in the &quot;plum role&quot; of Jackie Kallen but criticized Dutton and Edwards for relying too much on &quot;the well-worn underdog formula&quot; when telling her story and not focusing on more &quot;meatier&quot; issues outside of the movie&#x27;s text. Scott Tobias of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; wrote that: &quot;True to form, &quot;Against The Ropes&quot; favors a much tamer version of the real thing, never getting into the deep fissures that led to the real-life Kallen&#x27;s long estrangement with Toney. Right up to the ludicrous finale and an even more improbable denouement, everything rings Hollywood-false. More galling still, the filmmakers&#x27; inventions take the zing out of the facts.&quot; Nick Schager of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; criticized the film for being a &quot;lackluster melodrama&quot; with a script containing &quot;corny clichés and metaphors&quot; that uses prejudice to add color to their story, concluding that: &quot;While Dutton&#x27;s fight scenes are directed with reasonable panache, the rest of the film&#x27;s visuals are so blandly static that one can imagine the ease with which &quot;Against the Ropes&quot; will be pan-and-scanned for television.&quot;

However, the film did receive some positive reviews; Roger Ebert gave it 3 stars out of 4, remarking:
:&quot;It works near the end of &quot;Against the Ropes,&quot; a biopic about Jackie Kallen, who was (and is) the first female fight promoter in the all-male world of professional boxing. It works, and another cliche works, too: the Big Fight scene, right out of &quot;Rocky&quot; and every other boxing movie, in which the hero gets pounded silly but then somehow, after becoming inspired between rounds, comes back and is filled with skill and fury.&quot;

<doc id="1036224" wikidata="Q1494084" url="?curid=1036224" title="Vincenzo Ruffo">
<text>Vincenzo Ruffo (c. 1508 – 9 February 1587) was an Italian composer of the Renaissance. He was one of the composers most responsive to the musical reforms suggested by the Council of Trent, especially in his composition of masses, and as such was an influential member of the Counter-Reformation.

Vincenzo Ruffo was born at Verona, and became a priest there in 1531. Most likely he studied with Biagio Rossetti, the organist at the cathedral in Verona. Ruffo published his first book of music in 1542. Also in 1542 he became &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; at the cathedral in Savona, but he only held this position for a year; the cathedral was destroyed in 1543 by the Genoese, and Ruffo fled.

In either 1543 or 1544 he went to Milan to work for Alfonso d&#x27;Avalos, who was the governor of Milan at this time. When d&#x27;Avalos was called back to Madrid in 1546, Ruffo went back to in Verona, where he was the music director at the Accademia Filarmonica in 1551-1552, superseding Jan Nasco; in 1554 he became the choirmaster at the cathedral of Verona. While there he probably taught Gian Matteo Asola and Marc&#x27; Antonio Ingegneri, the teacher of Monteverdi; it is possible, though not proven, that he taught Andrea Gabrieli there as well.

His music during this time was strongly influenced by the Franco-Flemish school, but when he in 1563 became &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; in the cathedral of Milan under Carlo Borromeo, he began composing in the Tridentine style of which Borromeo was a strong supporter. One of the criticisms of the Council of Trent was that music had become so contrapuntally complex that it was impossible to understand the words being sung: Ruffo responded by composing masses in as simple a style as was consistent with clear expression of the text. Late in his life, however, he evidently became dissatisfied with composing masses in a strictly chordal style and returned to using a moderately contrapuntal style.

In 1564 several of his compositions were published in Milan; two works from this book were included many years later in the English manuscript known as the Dow Partbooks. In 1572 he became the &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; at Pistoia, and then Milan again; for his final job he had a similar employment at the cathedral in Sacile, where he died in 1587.

<text>Abortion Rights is an advocacy organisation that promotes access to abortion in the United Kingdom. It was formed in 2003 by the merger of the Abortion Law Reform Association (ALRA) and the National Abortion Campaign (NAC). The ALRA campaigned effectively after World War II for the elimination of legal obstacles to abortion and the peak of its work was the Abortion Act 1967.

==History==
The &quot;Abortion Law Reform Association&quot; was founded in the United Kingdom in 1936 by Janet Chance, Alice Jenkins, Joan Malleson and Stella Browne. Its intention was to change attitudes and the law to allow access to abortion in the United Kingdom. Janet Chance created the funding and the marketing whilst Alice Brook Jenkins was the honorary secretary. Jenkins created a network of supporters.

At the end of their first year they had 35 new members, and by 1939 they had almost 400. The membership were gathered from the working class using labour groups and women&#x27;s branches of the co-operative movement. These women wanted the privileges that “moneyed classes had enjoyed for years.”

The ALRA was very active between 1936 and 1939 sending speakers around the country to talk about Labour and Equal Citizenship and attempted to have letters and articles published in newspapers. They were in the frame when a member of the ALRA&#x27;s Medico-Legal Committee received the case of a fourteen-year-old girl who had been raped, and she received a termination of this pregnancy from Dr. Joan Malleson, a progenitor of the ALRA.

Alice Jenkins wrote an important book titled &quot;Law For The Rich&quot; which was published in 1960. Her book drew attention to the double standards that faced women with unwanted pregnancies. Abortion was nominally illegal so many women had to give birth to unplanned children, however rich women could persuade their private doctors that their mental health was at risk. The doctors were then able to carry out an abortion that was denied to most women in Britain.

During the 1970s and 1980s there were several proposed amendment bills against the Abortion Act 1967, so in defense of  the Abortion Act 1967 The National Abortion Campaign (NAC) was formed in 1975.

==Lobbying for change==
Vera Houghton became the chair of the ALRA in 1963 and over the next seven years she led the organisation. The ALRA&#x27;s turning point was to gain the support of the Liberal Party MP David Steel, who placed a private members bill through the House of Commons to reform the laws of abortion, choosing this issue over calls to instead amend the law on plumbers or the rights of homosexuals. He cites Alice Jenkin&#x27;s argument in her book &quot;Law For The Rich&quot; as being pivotal in his decision. Steele put forward a private members bill that was backed by the government and it resulted in the 1967 Abortion Act.

In 1974 the &quot;Working Women&#x27;s Charter&quot; was launched at the Trades Union Congress headquarters in London. The charter was an attempt to bridge the gap between women&#x27;s economic and social requirements. and included equal pay, an end to the glass ceiling, free contraception and access to abortion. In 1975, the Scottish politician James White introduced a bill in parliament to make abortion more difficult. A demonstration was arranged to protest at moves to restrict the then legal access to abortion. This demonstration led to the formation of National Abortion Campaign.

&quot;Abortion Rights&quot; was formed in 2003 by the merger of the &quot;Abortion Law Reform Association (ALRA)&quot; and the &quot;National Abortion Campaign&quot; (NAC). The organization is led by Anne Quesnay.

==Scottish devolution==

In 2016, abortion law was devolved to the Scottish Parliament in the Scotland Act 2016.

The devolved organisation Abortion Rights Scotland is a campaigning and advocacy organisation, taking part in an annual prochoice demo in Edinburgh on the anniversary of the Abortion Act 1967, giving evidence to the Scottish Parliament for the Safe Access Zones Bill, and taking part in the debate on decriminalization of abortion in Scotland.

<text>Carlos Alberto Sánchez (born in Girardot, Colombia, January 30, 1974), known professionally as Charlie Zaa, is a Colombian singer. Zaa is the son of singer Luis Humberto Sánchez.

==Early and personal life==
Zaa was a singer in two Colombian salsa orchestras: &quot;Grupo Niche&quot; and &quot;Orquesta Guayacán&quot;. When he launched his career as a solo artist, he decided to switch to the bolero rhythm. This career decision was made in the mid 90s.

On July 23, 2004, Zaa suffered a severe abdominal pain as he was about to begin a concert in Ponce, Puerto Rico. He couldn&#x27;t perform that day, having to be taken to a local hospital. Zaa was then flown to Miami, Florida, where he remained hospitalized until he was diagnosed with a kidney condition. Soon after, his personal doctor corrected the problem in a surgery performed in his native Colombia.

Zaa&#x27;s daughter Lauren Mia Sanchez was a survivor of the 2018 Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in which 17 people lost their lives, including one of her teachers.

==Music career==
Charlie Zaa has recorded over 10 albums since launching his career as a solo artist. His record &quot;Sentimientos&quot;, in which he sings some past hit songs, sold over three million copies throughout Latin America and the United States. His albums &quot;Sentimientos&quot; and &quot;Un Segundo Sentimiento&quot; led to him winning the 1998 Artist of the Year award at the Billboard Latin Music Awards. For his fourth album, Zaa returned to the Sonolux studios in Bogotá, where he made his first album &quot;Sentimiento&quot;, and to his original producer, Milton Salcedo, and recorded old romantic standards, boleros and waltzes, in an attempt to replicate the success of &quot;Sentimiento&quot;. Zaa&#x27;s album &quot;De Un Solo Sentimiento&quot; was nominated for a Latin Grammy Award in 2002. In 2011, Zaa&#x27;s album &quot;De Bohemia&quot; reached the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Latin Albums chart. Some of Charlie Zaa&#x27;s music was inspired by notable Ecuadorian singer and recording artist &quot;Julio Jaramillo&quot;.

<text>The Waterfall rail accident was a train accident that occurred on 31 January 2003 near Waterfall, New South Wales, Australia. The train derailed, killing seven people aboard, including the train driver, and injuring 40. The accident is famously remembered by systems engineers due to the poorly designed safety systems.

==Incident==
On the day of the disaster, a Tangara interurban train service, set G7, which had come from Sydney Central station at 6:24 am, departed Sydney Waterfall railway station moving south towards Port Kembla station via Wollongong. At approximately 7:15 am, the driver suffered a sudden heart attack and lost control of the train. The train was thus travelling at as it approached a curve in the tracks through a small cutting. The curve is rated for speeds no greater than . The train derailed, overturned and collided with the rocky walls of the cutting in a remote area south of the station. It was reported that the rescuers had to carry heavy lifting equipment for more than to reach the site. Two of the carriages landed on their sides and another two were severely damaged in the accident. In addition to the seven fatalities, many more passengers were injured.

The subsequent official inquiry discovered the deadman&#x27;s brake had not been applied. The train guard&#x27;s solicitor stated that the guard was in a microsleep for as much as 30 seconds, just prior to the accident. The human-factors accident investigator determined the organisational culture had the driver firmly in charge, making it psychologically more difficult for the guard to act.

==Causes of the accident==

Tangara trains have a number of safety and vigilance devices installed, such as a deadman&#x27;s brake, to address problems when the driver becomes incapacitated. If the driver releases pressure from this brake, the train will safely come to a halt.

The train in question was a four-car Outer Suburban Tangara set, numbered G7 and fitted with a Mitsubishi Electric alternating current traction system for evaluation purposes. The driver was in the leading driving carriage and the guard was in the rear driving carriage, in between which were two non-driving motor cars. On this service, the guard, who could have applied the emergency brake, and the deadman&#x27;s brake were the main safety mechanisms in place.

The train was later found to be travelling in excess of as it approached the curve where the accident occurred. Neither the deadman&#x27;s brake nor the guard had intervened in this situation, and this excessive speed was found to be the direct cause of the accident. Deficient training of train staff was also found to be a contributing factor in the accident.

Train G7 did not re-enter service. It was scrapped in 2005 due to the damage sustained in the accident as all four cars were damaged beyond repair.

These were the official findings of the NSW Ministry of Transport investigation of the accident. A report of the accident, managed by Commissioner Peter McInerney, was released in January 2004.

===Systemic causes and ignored technical problems===
It was reported that G7 was said to have been reported for technical problems &quot;possibly half a dozen times&quot; and had developed a reputation amongst the mechanical operations branch, saying the problems were &quot;normal&quot; for the set in question. During the six months leading up to the accident, three reports of technical problems were made.

The inquiry found a number of flaws in the deadman&#x27;s handle (which was not implicated in the accident) and related to the deadman&#x27;s pedal:
* The dead weight of the unconscious and overweight driver after he suffered a heart attack appeared to be enough to defeat the deadman&#x27;s pedal, of which 44% of Sydney train drivers&#x27; legs were of sufficient mass.
* The design of the deadman&#x27;s pedal did not appear to be able to operate as intended with drivers above a certain weight.
* Marks near the deadman&#x27;s pedal indicated some drivers were wedging a conveniently-sized red signalling flag to defeat the deadman&#x27;s pedal to prevent their legs from cramping in the poorly-configured footwell and to give themselves freedom of movement in the cabin.

Some of the technical problems reported for Tangaras generally, included brake failure and reported power surge problems. After the accident, they were often blamed by some for being the cause of the accident. Many of the survivors of the accident mentioned a large acceleration before the accident occurred. Furthermore, there was an understanding that the emergency brake should be seldom used because the train would accelerate between before the brake came into effect. It was noted that the G7 trainset was the only train in the Tangara fleet to use 3-phase induction motors, and that these are not able to &quot;run-away&quot;. Furthermore, the majority of braking and traction system components were thoroughly examined and tested by experts from Australia and overseas, and found to be working normally. Those damaged in the crash were examined and were also found not to have had pre-existing damage able to cause such an accident.

Official findings into the accident also blamed an &quot;underdeveloped safety culture&quot;. There has been criticism of the way CityRail managed safety issues, resulting in what the NSW Ministry of Transport termed &quot;a reactive approach to risk management&quot;.

At the inquiry, Paul Webb, Queen&#x27;s Counsel, representing the guard on the train, said the guard was in a microsleep at the time of the question, for as much as 30 seconds, which would have removed the opportunity for the guard to halt the train. Webb had also proposed there had been attitudes that the driver was completely in charge of the train, and speeding was not an acceptable reason for the guard to slow or halt the train, which would have been a contributing factor in the accident.

Prior to this derailment, neither training nor procedures mandated the guard to exercise control over the speed of the train by using the emergency brake pipe cock (&quot;the tail&quot;). Apart from the driver being considered to be the sole operator of the train, the emergency brake pipe cock does not provide the same degree of control over the automatic brake as a proper brake valve. The consensus among train crews was that a sudden emergency application from the rear could cause a breakaway (which is in fact not possible, as the cock does not apply the brakes solely to the rear car but rather uniformly along the full length of the train), and there was some evidence from previous accidents to validate such an opinion, however these were not involving the modern multiple-unit train design of which the Tangara is an example.

Since this derailment, CityRail training and operational procedures now emphasise the guard&#x27;s responsibility to monitor the train&#x27;s speed, and if necessary, open the emergency brake pipe tap to stop the train.

==Changes implemented==
All Sydney and Intercity NSW TrainLink trains now have an additional safety feature, which has been fitted since the accident. In addition to the deadman handle and foot pedal, the trains are fitted with &quot;task linked vigilance&quot; – which resets a timer every time the driver activates certain controls. If there is no change in control, a flashing lamp and then buzzer sound and the driver is required to acknowledge a vigilance button. If the train&#x27;s driver does not use the controls and does not acknowledge the vigilance alarm, the vigilance system is activated and makes an emergency brake application. All trains have also been fitted with data loggers to record the driver&#x27;s and guard&#x27;s actions as they work the train, as well as the train&#x27;s speed. Such a system had been fitted to G7, but was in the early stage of fleet roll-out, and hence had not been commissioned and switched on at the time of the accident.

Rescue workers who attended the scene were impeded from accessing the trapped passengers on the train because they did not have the keys required to open the emergency exit doors. Emergency exit mechanisms have all been modified, to allow them to be used without requiring a key. RailCorp has installed internal emergency door release mechanisms on all new trains. However many passengers found their own way out since the train was broken into three pieces during the accident.

CityRail/RailCorp incorporated emergency door releases on the insides of the new Waratah trains as a result of the inquiries to this disaster, enabling passengers to open the doors themselves in case of an emergency, where the crew are incapacitated and the train is at a standstill.

The 2004 changes to medical assessments of rail workers were developed in response to the incident. Overseen by the National Transport Commission, Cardiac assessments are mandatory for certification and re-certification with a proscribed mandatory checklist as part of the national standard in the interest of ensuring public safety, the intended purpose of the health assessments whereas previously the health assessments did not have an occupational risk but a clinical focus.

<text>Wittgenstein&#x27;s rod is a problem in geometry discussed by 20th-century philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein.

==Description==
A ray is drawn with its origin on a circle, through an external point and a point is chosen at some constant distance from the starting end of the ray; what figure does describe when all the initial points on the circle are considered? The answer depends on three parameters: the radius of the circle, the distance from the center to , and the length of the segment . The shape described by can be seen as a &#x27;figure-eight&#x27; which in some cases degenerates to a single lobe looking like an inverted cardioid.

If remains on the same side of with respect to the center of the circle, instead of a ray one can consider just a segment or the rod .

Wittgenstein sketched a mechanism and wrote:

<doc id="1036235" wikidata="Q146597" url="?curid=1036235" title="Zand dynasty">
<text>The Zand dynasty () was an Iranian dynasty, founded by Karim Khan Zand (1751–1779) that initially ruled southern and central Iran in the 18th century. It later expanded to include much of the rest of contemporary Iran (except for the provinces of Balochistan and Khorasan) as well as parts of Iraq. The lands of present-day Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia were controlled by khanates which were de jure part of the Zand realm, but the region was de facto autonomous. The island of Bahrain was also held for the Zands by the autonomous Al-Mazkur sheikhdom of Bushehr.

The reign of its most important ruler, Karim Khan, was marked by prosperity and peace. With its capital at Shiraz, arts and architecture flourished under Karim Khan&#x27;s reign, with some themes in architecture being revived from the nearby sites of the Achaemenid (550–330 BC) and Sasanian (224–651 AD) era&#x27;s of pre-Islamic Iran. The tombs of the medieval Persian poets Hafez and Saadi Shirazi were also renovated by Karim Khan. Distinctive Zand art which was produced at the behest of the Zand rulers became the foundation of later Qajar arts and crafts. Following Karim Khan&#x27;s death, Zand Iran went into decline due to internal disputes amongst members of the Zand dynasty. Its final ruler, Lotf Ali Khan Zand (1789–1794), was eventually executed by Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar (1789–1797) in 1794.

As noted by &quot;The Oxford Dictionary of Islam&quot;, &quot;Karim Khan Zand holds an enduring reputation as the most humane Iranian ruler of the Islamic era&quot;. When following the Islamic Revolution of 1979 the names of the past rulers of Iran became a taboo, the citizens of Shiraz refused to rename the Karim Khan Zand and Lotf Ali Khan Zand streets, the two main streets of Shiraz.

== Name ==
Since the Safavid era, (Guarded Domains of Iran) was the common and official name of Iran. The idea of the Guarded Domains illustrated a feeling of territorial and political uniformity in a society where the Persian language, culture, monarchy, and Shia Islam became integral elements of the developing national identity. The concept presumably had started to form under the Mongol Ilkhanate in the late 13th-century, a period in which regional actions, trade, written culture, and partly Shia Islam, contributed to the establishment of the early modern Persianate world.

==History==
===Karim Khan Zand===

The dynasty was founded by Karim Khan Zand, chief of the Zand tribe, which is a tribe of Laks, a branch of Lurs who may have been originally Kurdish. Nader Shah moved the Zand tribe from their home in the Zagros mountains to the eastern steppes of Khorasan. After Nader&#x27;s death, the Zand tribe, under the guidance of Karim Khan, went back to their original land. After Adil Shah was made king Karim Khan and his soldiers defected from the army and along with Ali Morad Khan Bakhtiari and Abolfath Khan Haft Lang, two other local chiefs, became a major contender but was challenged by several adversaries. Abolfath Khan was the Vizier, Karim Khan became the army chief commander and Ali Morad Khan became the regent.

Karim Khan declared Shiraz his capital, and in 1778 Tehran became the second capital. He gained control of central and southern parts of Iran. In order to add legitimacy to his claim, Karim Khan placed the infant Shah Ismail III, the grandson of the last Safavid king, on the throne in 1757. Ismail was a figurehead king and real power was vested in Karim Khan. Karim Khan chose to be the military commander and Alimardan Khan was the civil administrator. Soon enough Karim Khan managed to eliminate his partner as well as the puppet king and in 1760, founded his own dynasty. He refused to accept the title of the king and instead named himself &quot;Vakilol Ro&#x27;aya&quot; (&quot;Advocate of the People&quot;).

By 1760, Karim Khan had defeated all his rivals and controlled all of Iran except Khorasan, in the northeast, which was ruled by Shah Rukh. His foreign campaigns against Azad Khan in Azerbaijan and against the Ottomans in Mesopotamia brought Azerbaijan and the province of Basra into his control. But he never stopped his campaigns against his arch-enemy, Mohammad Hassan Khan Qajar, the chief of the Qoyunlu Qajars. The latter was finally defeated by Karim Khan and his sons, Agha Mohammad Khan and Hossein Qoli Khan Qajar, were brought to Shiraz as hostages.

Karim Khan&#x27;s monuments in Shiraz include the famous Arg of Karim Khan, Vakil Bazaar, and several mosques and gardens. He is also responsible for building of a palace in the town of Tehran, the future capital of the Qajar dynasty.

===Decline and fall===

Karim Khan&#x27;s death in 1779 left his territory vulnerable to threats from his enemies. His son and successor Abu al-Fath was an incompetent ruler who was heavily influenced by his half uncle (and Karim Khan&#x27;s commander), Zaki Khan. Other rulers such as Ali Morad and Jafar Khan also failed to follow the policies of Karim Khan and soon enough, the country was under attack from all sides.

The biggest enemies of the Zands, the Qajar chiefs, led by the former hostage, Agha Mohammad Khan, were advancing fast against the declining kingdom. Finally, in 1789, Lotf Ali Khan, a grand-nephew of Karim Khan, declared himself the new king. His reign (until 1794) was spent mostly in war with the Qajar khan. He was finally captured and brutally killed in the fortress of Bam, putting an effective end to the Zand dynasty.

Politically, it is also important that the Zands, especially Karim Khan, chose to call themselves &quot;Vakilol Ro&#x27;aya&quot; (&quot;Advocate of the People&quot;) instead of kings. Other than the obvious propaganda value of the title, it can be a reflection of the popular demands of the time, expecting rulers with popular leanings instead of absolute monarchs who were totally detached from the population, like the earlier Safavids.

==Foreign policy==
In foreign policy, Karim Khan attempted to revive the Safavid era trade by allowing the British to establish a trading post in the port of Bushehr. This opened the hands of the British East India Company in Iran and increased their influence in the country. The taxation system was reorganized in a way that taxes were levied fairly. The judicial system was fair and generally humane. Capital punishment was rarely implemented.

==Art==

The Zand era was a time of relative peace and economic growth for the country. Many territories that were once captured by the Ottomans in the late Safavid era were retaken, and Iran was once again a coherent and prosperous country. From 1765 onwards Karim Khan promoted art and architecture at his capital Shiraz. After Iranian painting reached its height at the end of the 17th century, a special school of painting took shape during the Zand era in the 17th and 18th centuries. Painting thrived under Karim Khan, and notable paintings from this era include &quot;Muhammad Karim Khan Zand and the Ottoman Ambassador&quot; which was created . The most important painter of the Zand era was Mohammad Sadiq. The art of this era is remarkable and, despite the short length of the dynasty, a distinct Zand art had the time to emerge. Many Qajar artistic traits were copied from the Zand examples and Zand art became the foundation of Qajar arts and crafts. Following Karim Khan&#x27;s death, the Zand dynasty became embroiled in disputes over succession and other intrigues, which put a halt to further significant patronage of the arts.

===Architecture===
Karim Khan&#x27;s first architectural considerations were focussed on defense and he therefore rebuilt the city walls of Shiraz in 1767. He decorated Shiraz with new buildings including the Arg of Karim Khan, the Vakil Bazaar and the Kulah-e Farangi and grouped these around a public square (&quot;maidan&quot; in Persian). Zand-era architecture is notable in Iranian history for &quot;its revetments in carved marble and overglaze-painted tiles with flowers, animals and people&quot;. &quot;The Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art and Architecture&quot; notes that some themes employed by Zand architecture were knowingly revived from the nearby ancient Achaemenid and Sasanian sites, such as Persepolis and Naqsh-e Rostam.

===Cultural patronage===
According to the Italian scholar Alessandro Bausani: &quot;The eighteenth century, which in Europe (and partly also in India, for example) was a ferment of renewal, is the darkest and most sterile period in Persian literature and culture.&quot; Scholars of Persian literature have also made a similar conclusion. John Perry commented on these statements: &quot;While regrettably true of literature, this view is somewhat too sweeping to be fair to the fine and applied arts.&quot; Like Nader Shah, Karim Khan was uninterested in poetry panegyric and had no more than a passing tolerance for history. He supported the court artisans and artists, albeit in an indifferent manner.

The numerous artists active during Karim Khan&#x27;s time who were born in or educated in Isfahan, many of whom carry the surname &quot;Esfahani,&quot; can be considered as representations of the lengthy political and cultural traditions of the Safavid court; they account for at least seventeen of the twenty-seven identified by Abu&#x27;l-Hasan Mostawfi Ghaffari. In the 1750s, some people—including the poet Hazin Lahiji—had immigrated to India. Others, like Vafa of Qom, departed for India under Nader Shah&#x27;s rule but later came back to Iran under Karim Khan. During the interim period, a large number of people, primarily in the central region of Isfahan, Qom, and Kashan, remained in Iran. These people included Moshtaq, Azar Bigdeli, Hatef Esfahani, and Rafiq. Shiraz largely took up Isfahan&#x27;s role as the patronage hub.

Seven calligraphers, including Mohammad Hashem Zargar, and least as many poets, including Azar Bigdeli, and the doctor Mirza Mohammad Nasir left Isfahan to settle in Shiraz. One of the factors behind Isfahan&#x27;s loss as the literary center of Iran is reported by Abd al-Razzaq Beg Donboli. The city&#x27;s poets, including Azar Bigdeli, were actively supported by the governor Mirza Abd ol-Vahhab Musavi. However, after the latters death in 1759/60, the governorship of Isfahan was given to the tyrannical figure Hajji Agha Mohammad Ranani. In 1763/64, disgruntled poets and other prominent individuals sent a delegation to Karim Khan in which they attempted to have Hajji Agha replaced. After their efforts were unsuccessful, some of them relocated to Shiraz.

== Imperial ideology ==
The distinguishing quality of Karim Khan&#x27;s leadership came from his refusal to exercise royal authority independent of nominal Safavid sovereignty. However, his decision to continue serving as &quot;vakil al-dowleh&quot; (&quot;deputy of the state&quot;) marked a subtle change from his previous role as the regent of a prince distantly related to the Safavid dynasty and of no importance. Moreover, he appears to have tacitly changed his authority from Safavid kingship to that of representing the people by using the title of &quot;Vakil ol-Ra&#x27;aya&quot; (&quot;deputy of the people&quot;). The subtle change reflected Karim Khan&#x27;s standing among his subjects, particularly the urban people. He also drew on Iranian monarchy traditions that were directly related to the Fars province in order to distance himself from the distressing events of recent times.

Karim Khan attempted to recreate the territorial Iran of the Safavid era, just like Nader Shah and Agha Mohammad Khan. A common reference for consecutive rulers was Nader Shah&#x27;s mention of Iran&#x27;s established borders during the Safavid dynasty. Karim Khan made use of the same justification for similar land dispute resolutions.

== Court and administration ==

When compared to the complex structure of hierarchy and ceremony that distinguished the Safavid court, Karim Khan&#x27;s household in Shiraz was smaller, simpler, and more focused on real administrative and military requirements than on the lavish display of the Safavid shah. The Zand nobility was a remnant of the Safavid nobility and was later almost entirely absorbed into the Qajar nobility. As with previous dynasties, the official language and court literature was in Persian, and the majority of the chancellors, ministers, and bureaucrats were well-educated and talented Persian speakers.

The central government was under the complete control of Karim Khan. Historical documents do contain occasional references to the established Safavid court offices and protocols under the Zands, but nothing suggests that the chief minister (&quot;etemad ol-dowleh&quot;, &quot;sadr-e azam&quot;) and resident court amirs (the &quot;qurchi-bashi&quot;, &quot;qollar-aghasi&quot;, &quot;eshik-aqasi-bashi&quot;, and &quot;tofangchi-aghasi&quot;) formed the &quot;close council of state&quot; as they did in the late Safavid era. Under Karim Khan, no government official attained significant importance. Instead, he gave his kinsmen and trusted tribal leaders the responsibility for military campaigns and governance. Local administrators, who were all directly accountable to him, were given charge of the provinces. When a Zand prince was given a title, it was more like a honorific rather than an official position in the government.

The &quot;vazir-e divan&quot; was Karim Khan&#x27;s direct subordinate in the bureaucracy. The first to occupy that office under him was Mirza Aqil Esfahani, who was executed in 1763 and succeeded by Mirza Mohammad Ja&#x27;far Esfahani. The office of &quot;mostowfi ol-mamalek&quot; was almost equally important and was held by Mirza Mohammad Borujerdi and Mirza Mohammad Hossein Farahani in succession. Karim Khan treated the people holding these senior administrative and senior fiscal positions as nothing more than secretarial assistants, treating them more like friends than colleagues.

==Religious policy==
Karim Khan might have been anticipated to seek the &quot;ulama&#x27;s&quot; approval for his unusual position as the head of an nominally neo-Safavid (but in reality kingless) monarchy. However, he refused to comply with this. By minting coins under the name of the hidden imam, erecting mosques and shrines, and probably participating in Friday prayers—though this is not mentioned—Karim Khan supported the Shia beliefs in a traditional manner. Abu&#x27;l-Hasan Qazvini, who was one the more religious historians, claims that Karim Khan never prayed throughout his entire life. The government-appointed &quot;shaykh ol-eslam&quot; was the most important religious figure in Shiraz. His responsibilities seemed to be more constrained than those of his Safavid predecessors, and the title &quot;molla-bashi&quot; (chief theologian) created by Soltan Hoseyn was not retained.

Religious officers typically selected by the crown got degrees and set payments from Karim Khan, such as the guardian of the Shah Abdol-Azim Shrine at Ray in 1765 and the supervisor of religious activities at Qazvin. However, the lesser &quot;akhunds&quot;, theologians, Alavid seyyeds, and dervishes who anticipated living off of government pensions were let down. They were reportedly seen as parasites by Karim Khan, who claimed that by controlling pricing, they could live happily with what they had just like others. Presentations of the passion play, which reenacted the martyrdom of Husayn ibn Ali, gained popularity from Karim Khan&#x27;s reign onward, possibly as a result of the more tolerant religious climate.

Both Karim Khan in 1764 and Ali-Morad Khan in 1781 issued &quot;farmans&quot; (royal edicts) that ensured freedom of residence, worship, and trade to Christian missionary groups in Iran, including the Carmelites, Benedictines, Jesuits, Capuchins, Augustinians, and others. The only requirement was that they behaved in a manner that did not anger the Shia and its supporters.

== Population ==
Roughly between the 1730s and the 1780s, hundreds of literate and renowned Iranians escaped to India due to the devastating circumstances. Many of them, including Abol-Hasan Golestaneh, expressed regret. The latter was a hostage in Karim Khan&#x27;s entourage during the struggle for supremacy in western Iran, but in 1756 he managed to escape to the Shia shrine city of Najaf and subsequently to India, where he reunited with his family. Three of his uncles had served Nader Shah, but two of them fell out of favor and fled to India. His &quot;Mojmel al-tavarikh&quot;, a comprehensive history of the early Zand period, was written there in Murshidabad in 1782. Native Jews, Armenians, and other Christians, who were frequent targets of extortion and persecution, also migrated in very large numbers. Between 1742 and 1758, refugees settled in Mughal India, Bengal, Ottoman Iraq and Yemen, giving rise to a new generation of Iranians and Armenians. Baghdad and the adjacent shrine towns were home to an estimated 100,000 Iranian refugees, and Basra was claimed to be two-thirds occupied by refugees.

While European and Iranian emigrants eagerly scanned the horizon for signs that &quot;Persia would soon be reunited under one chief, which would undoubtedly lead to the reestablishment of trade, so long interrupted,&quot; rumors of Karim Khan&#x27;s victories and of his fair rule started to spread in the mid-1750s, which convinced many refugees to come back. By 1760, every day refugees were returning to Iran. Thousands of them from all social classes arrived along the now-secure caravan routes.

The population of Isfahan had decreased to perhaps 20,000 by 1750 from what may have been between 250,000 and 500,000 during the Safavid era. It increased to an estimated 40,000–50,000 by 1772. Even though Shiraz appeared to be &quot;demolished and destroyed... altogether depopulated and empty of Christians&quot; in 1756, refugees from Isfahan, especially Armenians from the suburb of New Julfa, were already making their way there every day. According to John R. Perry; &quot;There are no contemporary estimates of the population of Shiraz under the Vakil, but it seems reasonable to assume that between 1759 and 1779 it grew at a much faster rate than Isfahan, reaching roughly the same population as the latter, though within a much more compact urban area.&quot;

Shiraz lost around half of its population following its sack by Agha Mohammad Khan, numbering 20,000. Other cities in central Iran, like Qom, reportedly experienced a revival under Karim Khan&#x27;s rule after suffering under the Afghans, Afsharids and the Zand-Qajar conflicts.

=== The Armenians and Jews ===
Many of the Armenians of New Julfa and Peria who had fled Iran, returned to the country by settling in Shiraz, which welcomed their return. The Armenian population in Shiraz, whose quarter was located in the western corner by the Kazerun Gate, was primarily engaged in viticulture and wine trade. They also had their own mayor, and the government promoted their settlement by granting them villages around the capital. Mkrtic Vardapet, the Armenian prelate, divided his time between New Julfa and Shiraz every year for six months. Shiraz became the largest Jewish hub in Iran as a result of the return of many Jews, whose population may have decreased by about 20,000 between 1747 and 1779. They paid a special tax in exchange for being given their own section of land west of the bazaar. Although they seemed to be struggling financially in 1765, they were not the target of any persecution until after Karim Khan&#x27;s death in 1779.

== Coinage ==

Various anonymous or semi-anonymous currencies were struck by Karim Khan and his successors, but the abbasi of 4.6 gram and the rupee of 11.5 gram seemed to be the most common. Isfahan, Kashan, Yazd, Shiraz, Tabriz, Qazvin, Rasht, Mazandaran, and the court mint were the main coin mints under Karim Khan. There was no monetary unity in Iran even though Karim Khan was acknowledged as the overlord of the majority of the country after 1763, as many regions remained independent or semi-autonomous. This was especially true for the semi-autonomous local khans that controlled the Caspian and Caucasian regions, as well as Khorasan, which was ruled by the Durranids and Afsharids.

A number of these khanates, including Ganja, Shirvan, Shaki, Derbent, and Karabakh, produced their own coins, first in the name of Nader Shah and then in the name of Karim Khan. A large portion of their coinage was completely nameless by the end of the 18th-century. While a few uncommon issues of Derbent contain a vague reference to one of their khans, none of the khans ever put their names on their coins, due to lacking the legitimacy of an sovereign monarch and any claims to independence. These northern Iranian coins were made entirely of silver and copper.

==Legacy==

As noted by &quot;The Oxford Dictionary of Islam&quot;, &quot;Karim Khan Zand holds an enduring reputation as the most humane Iranian ruler of the Islamic era&quot;. Karim Khan is the subject of many stories about his &quot;kindness, generosity and justice&quot;. &quot;The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Islamic World &quot; adds that he is described as &quot;a model ruler who never took the title of Shah&quot;. The Zand entity of Karim Khan was at peace and the roads within the realm were reportedly free of bandits. Karim Khan rebuilt Shiraz, his capital, and decorated it with new buildings including the Arg of Karim Khan, the Vakil Bazaar and the Kulah-e Farangi. He also restored the tombs of the medieval Persian poets Hafez and Saadi Shirazi. Until this day, the inhabitants of Shiraz honor Karim Khan. When following the Islamic Revolution of 1979 the names of the past rulers of Iran became a taboo, the citizens of Shiraz refused to rename the Karim Khan Zand Street and Lotf-Ali Khan Zand Street, the two main streets of Shiraz.

<doc id="1036238" wikidata="Q28747" url="?curid=1036238" title="Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate">
<text>Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, abbreviated NADP or, in older notation, TPN (triphosphopyridine nucleotide), is a cofactor used in anabolic reactions, such as the Calvin cycle and lipid and nucleic acid syntheses, which require NADPH as a reducing agent (&#x27;hydrogen source&#x27;). NADPH is the reduced form, whereas NADP is the oxidized form. NADP is used by all forms of cellular life. NADP is essential for life because it is needed for cellular respiration.

NADP differs from NAD by the presence of an additional phosphate group on the 2&#x27; position of the ribose ring that carries the adenine moiety. This extra phosphate is added by NAD+ kinase and removed by NADP+ phosphatase.

== Biosynthesis ==

=== NADP ===
In general, NADP+ is synthesized before NADPH is. Such a reaction usually starts with NAD+ from either the de-novo or the salvage pathway, with NAD+ kinase adding the extra phosphate group. ADP-ribosyl cyclase allows for synthesis from nicotinamide in the salvage pathway, and NADP+ phosphatase can convert NADPH back to NADH to maintain a balance. Some forms of the NAD+ kinase, notably the one in mitochondria, can also accept NADH to turn it directly into NADPH. The prokaryotic pathway is less well understood, but with all the similar proteins the process should work in a similar way.

=== NADPH ===
NADPH is produced from NADP+. The major source of NADPH in animals and other non-photosynthetic organisms is the pentose phosphate pathway, by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) in the first step. The pentose phosphate pathway also produces pentose, another important part of NAD(P)H, from glucose. Some bacteria also use G6PDH for the Entner–Doudoroff pathway, but NADPH production remains the same.

Ferredoxin–NADP reductase, present in all domains of life, is a major source of NADPH in photosynthetic organisms including plants and cyanobacteria. It appears in the last step of the electron chain of the light reactions of photosynthesis. It is used as reducing power for the biosynthetic reactions in the Calvin cycle to assimilate carbon dioxide and help turn the carbon dioxide into glucose. It has functions in accepting electrons in other non-photosynthetic pathways as well: it is needed in the reduction of nitrate into ammonia for plant assimilation in nitrogen cycle and in the production of oils.

There are several other lesser-known mechanisms of generating NADPH, all of which depend on the presence of mitochondria in eukaryotes. The key enzymes in these carbon-metabolism-related processes are NADP-linked isoforms of malic enzyme, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), and glutamate dehydrogenase. In these reactions, NADP+ acts like NAD+ in other enzymes as an oxidizing agent. The isocitrate dehydrogenase mechanism appears to be the major source of NADPH in fat and possibly also liver cells. These processes are also found in bacteria. Bacteria can also use a NADP-dependent glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase for the same purpose. Like the pentose phosphate pathway, these pathways are related to parts of glycolysis. Another carbon metabolism-related pathway involved in the generation of NADPH is the mitochondrial folate cycle, which uses principally serine as a source of one-carbon units to sustain nucleotide synthesis and redox homeostasis in mitochondria. Mitochondrial folate cycle has been recently suggested as the principal contributor to NADPH generation in mitochondria of cancer cells.

NADPH can also be generated through pathways unrelated to carbon metabolism. The ferredoxin reductase is such an example. Nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase transfers the hydrogen between NAD(P)H and NAD(P)+, and is found in eukaryotic mitochondria and many bacteria. There are versions that depend on a proton gradient to work and ones that do not. Some anaerobic organisms use NADP+-linked hydrogenase, ripping a hydride from hydrogen gas to produce a proton and NADPH.

Like NADH, NADPH is fluorescent. NADPH in aqueous solution excited at the nicotinamide absorbance of ~335 nm (near UV) has a fluorescence emission which peaks at 445-460 nm (violet to blue). NADP has no appreciable fluorescence.

== Function ==
NADPH provides the reducing agents, usually hydrogen atoms, for biosynthetic reactions and the oxidation-reduction involved in protecting against the toxicity of reactive oxygen species (ROS), allowing the regeneration of glutathione (GSH). NADPH is also used for anabolic pathways, such as cholesterol synthesis, steroid synthesis, ascorbic acid synthesis, xylitol synthesis, cytosolic fatty acid synthesis and microsomal fatty acid chain elongation.

The NADPH system is also responsible for generating free radicals in immune cells by NADPH oxidase. These radicals are used to destroy pathogens in a process termed the respiratory burst.
It is the source of reducing equivalents for cytochrome P450 hydroxylation of aromatic compounds, steroids, alcohols, and drugs.

== Stability ==
NADH and NADPH are very stable in basic solutions, but NAD+ and NADP+ are degraded in basic solutions into a fluorescent product that can be used conveniently for quantitation. Conversely, NADPH and NADH are degraded by acidic solutions while NAD+/NADP+ are fairly stable to acid.

== Enzymes that use NADP(H) as a coenzyme ==
Many enzymes that bind NADP share a common super-secondary structure named named the &quot;Rossmann fold&quot;. The initial beta-alpha-beta (βαβ) fold is the most conserved segment of the Rossmann folds. This segment is in contact with the ADP portion of NADP. Therefore, it is also called an &quot;ADP-binding βαβ fold&quot;.

* Adrenodoxin reductase: This enzyme is present ubiquitously in most organisms. It transfers two electrons from NADPH to FAD. In vertebrates, it serves as the first enzyme in the chain of mitochondrial P450 systems that synthesize steroid hormones.

== Enzymes that use NADP(H) as a substrate ==
In 2018 and 2019, the first two reports of enzymes that catalyze the removal of the 2&#x27; phosphate of NADP(H) in eukaryotes emerged. First the cytoplasmic protein MESH1 (), then the mitochondrial protein nocturnin were reported. Of note, the structures and NADPH binding of MESH1 (5VXA) and nocturnin (6NF0) are not related.

<text>Abecedarians were a 16th-century German sect of Anabaptists who rejected all human learning. Questions have been raised as to the historical accuracy of the name and sect, though the term was applied broadly to the Zwickau Prophets.

==Rejection of education==
According to the original &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;, the Abecedarians were a 16th-century German sect of Anabaptists who affected an absolute disdain for all human knowledge, contending that God would enlighten his elect from within themselves, giving them knowledge of necessary truths by visions and ecstasies, with which human learning would interfere.

They rejected every other means of instruction, and claimed that to be saved one must even be ignorant of the first letters of the alphabet; whence their name, A-B-C-darians. They also considered the study of theology as a species of idolatry, and regarded learned men who did any preaching as falsifiers of God&#x27;s word.

Nicholas Storch led this sect, preaching that the teaching of the Holy Spirit was all that was necessary.
Andreas Karlstadt adopted these views, abandoned his title of doctor and became a street porter, going so far as to burn his doctor&#x27;s gown, according to one source.

Storch (also spelled Stork), a follower of Luther, 
&quot;maintained that each individual among the faithful was equally qualified to penetrate the sense of the inspired writings, as the best divines; that God himself was our immediate instructor, and that study took off our attention to the divine inspirations. Hence he inferred, that the only method to prevent distractions would be, absolutely not to learn to read.&quot;
Bell also claims that the sect was considerable for some time in Germany.

John Blunt claimed that &quot;Abecedarian theory, in a more moderate form, has had much influence on some modern sects, especially the more ignorant sects of Methodists.&quot;

===Doubts of accuracy===
Early Anabaptists were viewed disdainfully by their adversaries as a radical peasant movement. Thus some consider the extant descriptions to be an elitist caricature of either a particular Anabaptist group or Anabaptists as a whole. Most recent reference works have ceased to mention the group at all. No equivalent entry was present in the &quot;New Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;. No historical references later than the early 20th century mention these claims.

==Cultural references==
In The Adventures of Tintin graphic novel &quot;The Calculus Affair&quot;, Captain Haddock uses the word &quot;Abecedarian&quot; as an epithet. Los Angeles post-punk band Abecedarians named themselves after the sect. They released three albums between 1986 and 1988. Don DeLillo references Abecedarians in his novel &quot;The Names&quot;.

<doc id="1036244" wikidata="Q6804446" url="?curid=1036244" title="Mecha Press">
<text>Mecha Press is a North American anime and manga magazine that was published by IANVS Publications in the early 1990s.

The magazine was released on a roughly bimonthly schedule, with 5 to 6 issues per year. Each issue usually focused on one particular anime or manga, dedicating up to one third of its page content on related synopsis, character and mecha presentations.

==The magazine==
&quot;Mecha Press&quot; was originally started as a sister magazine to &quot;Protoculture Addicts&quot;, the oldest anime and manga magazine in North America. Its name derives from its main focus, mecha, although the content also covered characters, stories, toys, games and scale models. The publisher of &quot;Mecha Press&quot; was Ianus Publications.

The first issue, a red duo-tone test called issue #0, was published in 1991. Issue #1 officially launched the magazine the next year. Issues #1 through 6 had an oversized format similar to a tabloid newspaper. From issue #7 and onward, the magazine was shrunk to a more standard size, but gained a color section.

When the design team, Dream Pod 9, started focusing exclusively on games, the magazine was cancelled with issue #17. It appeared in March–April 1995. The remaining unpublished content was then merged into &quot;Protoculture Addicts&quot; magazine. Archive issues are available as PDF e-books from the publisher.

== Detailed content ==
Starting with #2, each issue has one main topic and several derivative ones. The following abbreviations are used in the listing to save space: Basics of Mecha Modeling - BoMM; Battletech - Btech; Engineering Outlook - EO; Heavy Gear - HG; Heavy Gear Fighter - HGF; Jovian Chronicles - JC; Mobile Suit - MS; Mekton II - MkII; Questions &amp; Answers - Q&amp;A.

<text>Rory Hugh Culkin (born July 21, 1989) is an American actor known for his roles in &quot;You Can Count on Me&quot; (2000), &quot;Signs&quot; (2002), &quot;Scream 4&quot; (2011), and &quot;Columbus&quot; (2017). He has also appeared on television series such as &quot;Waco&quot; (2018), &quot;Under the Banner of Heaven&quot; (2022), and the &quot;Black Mirror&quot; (2023) episode &quot;Beyond the Sea&quot;.

He is the youngest brother of actors Macaulay and Kieran Culkin.

==Early life==
Rory Hugh Culkin was born July 21, 1989, in New York City, the youngest of seven children born to Christopher &quot;Kit&quot; Culkin, a former Broadway stage actor, and Patricia Brentrup, a native of North Dakota who met Kit in 1974 while working as a road traffic controller in Sundance, Wyoming. Culkin&#x27;s siblings include Shane ( 1976), Dakota (1979–2008), Macaulay ( 1980), Kieran ( 1982), Quinn ( 1984), and Christian ( 1987). He also had a paternal half-sister, Jennifer (b. 1970), who died in 2000. Culkin&#x27;s paternal aunt is actress Bonnie Bedelia. He has German, Irish, and Norwegian ancestry.

==Career==
Culkin began acting by playing alongside his elder brothers, among them Macaulay and Kieran, often as the younger versions of their characters. He first appeared in a photograph as a baby in &quot;The Good Son&quot; (1993), then as Young Richie in &quot;Ri¢hie Ri¢h&quot; (1994) (Richie being played by his brother Macaulay) and in 2002, played 10-year-old Igby in &quot;Igby Goes Down&quot; (17-year-old Igby was played by his older brother Kieran).

Culkin&#x27;s breakthrough role was in &quot;You Can Count on Me&quot; (2000), opposite Laura Linney, a role for which he received much praise and a Young Artist Award. Since then, Culkin has appeared in numerous films, including &quot;Signs&quot; (2002), in which he starred alongside Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix and &quot;Electrick Children&quot;, in which he starred alongside Julia Garner.

As a teenager, Rory started moving into more independent films. He took a leading role in &quot;Mean Creek&quot; (2004), a film about a group of teenagers that plan revenge on a bully. The entire youth cast won an Independent Spirit Award for this film. He appeared in other independent films, such as &quot;The Chumscrubber&quot; (2005), &quot;Down in the Valley&quot; (2005), and &quot;Hick&quot; (2011). 

Since his Young Artist Award win for &quot;You Can Count on Me&quot;, Culkin has received three more nominations. He had a guest role in the &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; episode &quot;Manic&quot;, and in the episode &quot;Azoth the Avenger Is a Friend of Mine&quot; of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; alongside Patrick Warburton. In May 2010, Culkin was cast for the slasher film &quot;Scream 4&quot;, which was released on April 15, 2011. Culkin was cast as Euronymous in the biographical film &quot;Lords of Chaos&quot; (2018) which tells the story about the events of the Norwegian black metal scene and the band Mayhem.

In 2014, Culkin starred as the titular character in &quot;Gabriel&quot;. Culkin was commended by critics, and was subsequently nominated for the Gotham Independent Film Award for Breakthrough Actor.

In 2016, he appeared in the horror movies &quot;Welcome to Willits&quot; and &quot;Jack Goes Home&quot;.

In 2023, Culkin guest-appeared in Amazon Prime Video series &quot;Swarm&quot;.

== Personal life ==
In April 2018, Culkin married cinematographer Sarah Scrivener in New Orleans, Louisiana. Their wedding was officiated by Paul Heyman on the eve of WrestleMania 34. Scrivener and Culkin had met already in 2009 while working on &quot;Scre4m&quot;, the fourth film of the Scream franchise. In 2019, they collaborated on the Showtime series &quot;City on a Hill&quot;; further, in 2022, they worked together on a music video that Scrivener directed, produced and filmed for musician Quinn Murphy.

<text>Ratu Dr. Epeli Qaraninamu Nailatikau (born 1942) is a Fiji a medical doctor and former political leader, who served in the Senate from 2004 to 2006. He was nominated on 24 September 2004 by the Fiji Labour Party, to fill a vacancy caused by the death of former Senator Joeli Kalou. Under the Constitution of Fiji, the Leader of the Opposition nominates 8 of the 32 Senators. The eight nominees of the Leader of the Opposition were required to reflect the political composition of the House of Representatives. As the Labour Party was the principal opposition, it got to choose most or all of the eight opposition Senators.

== Medical career ==
Nailatikau had wide experience locally and internationally as a medical doctor. Once the chief medical officer to the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, he later played an important role after the Fiji coup of 2000, as head of the trauma team providing counseling for the parliamentarians (and their families) who had been kidnapped and held hostage in the insurrection. He also established his own medical clinic, the Siloah People&#x27;s Clinic, in Tavua.

== Views on the chiefly system, religion ==

Nailatikau spoke out in early March 2006 against what he said was the failure of chiefs to set examples of good leadership, transparency, and vision for the following generations. &quot;We must be role models and practice what we say. Right now there is a lack of authority at the village level,&quot; he said. Instead of leading the people, some chiefs were using their positions for personal enrichment, he alleged at the Peace and Stability Development Analysis Awareness Forum, which was organized by the United Nations Development Program. He declared that traditional influence in a modern government was out of place. On a separate issue, he said that traditional objections to interracial marriages were an obstacle to peace and stability in Fiji.

Nailatikau continued his attack on the chiefly system with a Parliamentary speech on 10 March. Fijian culture and traditions needed to be brought up to date with the modern world, he said, and chiefs should be chosen democratically and for fixed terms, the Fiji Times quoted him as saying. According to the Fiji Sun, he also called for politics and religion to be clearly separated, though with the latter morally underpinning the former.

== Personal life ==
Nailatikau is married to Latu, a schoolteacher.

<text>The Dreamers is the title of a fantasy book series by American writer David Eddings and his wife Leigh Eddings. The story revolves around four beings known as The Elder Gods residing in the land of Dhrall: Dahlaine of the North, Veltan of the South, Zelana of the West and Aracia of the East. They must recruit the help of outlanders to destroy the fiendish Vlagh and prevent its attempt at world conquest.
The Elder Gods are not permitted to use their powers to kill, but the young Dreamers can use their dreams to predict and affect the future.

The series includes four titles:
# &quot;The Elder Gods&quot; (2003)
# &quot;The Treasured One&quot; (2004)
# &quot;Crystal Gorge&quot; (2005)
# &quot;The Younger Gods&quot; (2006)

==Plot summary==

=== The Elder Gods===

The first volume of the series, &quot;The Elder Gods&quot;, is about the invasion of the unsuspecting Zelana&#x27;s Domain by the hordes of the Vlagh inhabiting the Wasteland center of the Land of Dhrall.

The Elder Gods are each given an infant told to be a Dreamer and are supposed to save the world and defeat the Vlagh. When Eleria, Zelana&#x27;s child, has the first dream, the Elder Gods go out in search of mercenaries to hire with gold (found useless and common in the land of Dhrall).

Zelana takes to the west of Dhrall to the land of Maag where she forces a storm to bring the ship and crew of Sorgan Hook-Beak to her domain. Hook-Beak is shown that she will pay a large quantity of gold to hire an army from Maag and fight a war. He takes the native archers Longbow and Red-Beard as well as Zelana with her child Eleria to Maag in search of more crews. They find much success but when the Vlagh sends an agent out to convince a crew to destroy Sorgan Hook-Beak and steal the gold, they are stopped thanks to a vision of Eleria. The night they came to attack, Longbow and the small Maag smith of Hook-Beak&#x27;s crew, Rabbit, destroy the enemy fleet and the Vlagh agent responsible. A tight friendship is made by Rabbit and Longbow.

Meanwhile, in the Trogite Empire, south of Dhrall, Veltan has managed to hire a retired army general, Narasan, and his companions Padan, Gunda, Keselo and Jalkan.

The two armies meet in the western domain in surprise due to their extreme dislike for one another but Hook-Beak and Narasan become friends quickly as they plan to stop the foreseen attack in the Ravine above the Dhrall village of Lattash, the home of Red-Beard. Yaltar, the Dreamer of Veltan, foresees that the Vlagh would attack there and that there would be much killing on both sides. As the armies of Maag and the Trogite Empire build their barricades and planned their assault after the warm ocean air, created by Eleria, melts the snow where the Vlagh&#x27;s servants are waiting, thus creating flooding and winning most of the war then. While Eleria dreams up the flood, Rabbit and Kesselo are informed about the true nature of the gods, and what they really are, and told to keep it a secret from the other outlanders.

Sure enough, Eleria&#x27;s dream brings forth an extremely warm wind and many servants die in the flood. The native archers dip the arrows in the venom of the dead servants washed down to Lattash to ensure their victory, but the venom was also used with spears and wooden stakes. The remaining creatures of the Vlagh in the ravine met their ends with their own poison.

After the Vlagh&#x27;s first wave of minions were obliterated, the outlander armies moved north to the top of the ravine and built a fort to prevent the continuous coming of the servants. However, as the fort was finished and the domain of Zelana was seemingly impregnable, the Vlagh&#x27;s servants revealed their clever trick. They were using creatures to climb the mountain to the fort as decoys so that the bulk of their army would walk through tunnels in the mountain to end up far down in the ravine. The Vlagh had successfully trapped the outlanders as the earth began to shake. Veltan came and warned the outlanders to reach safe ground as Yaltan was having a dream that was about to unleash a behemoth. The outlanders evacuated as two volcanoes of massive power eradicated the Vlagh&#x27;s creatures by filling up the tunnels and burrows with molten rock. The war had been won by the outlanders.

Zelana was afraid of the capabilities of the Dreams and fled but when she returned, Lattash had to be moved due to the twin volcanoes and the chief of the people of Lattash passed on his title to Red-Beard as the natives and outlanders pondered the next location of the Vlagh&#x27;s attack.

===The Treasured One===

Narasan and Sorgan move their armies to the Domain of Veltan, where they meet Veltan&#x27;s friend, Omago. Before their arrival, Veltan had given Omago a knife, and Omago figured out how to turn the knife into a spear, a weapon that was common in the outside world, but unknown to the peaceful people of Veltan&#x27;s domain. Veltan shows the outlanders his house, which they are shocked to discover is made from one stone. They examine a miniature model of the Domain, and begin to make plans. Omago&#x27;s wife, Ara, enters, announcing supper is ready, and Jalkan, known for his violent and corrupt nature, suggests she take up prostitution, and Omago hits him. Jalkan attempts to retaliate, but Keselo stops him, and Narasan fires him, ordering Padan to chain him up and throw him in the brig of his flagship, the Victory.

Jalkan escapes and returns to The Trogite Empire, where he reconnects with his former friend and partner-in-crime, Adnari Estarg. Adnari maintains a position of power within the corrupt Amarite church, and is interested in the tales Jalkin brings of abundant gold in the land of Dhrall. The church puts together a large expedition intent on plundering Veltan&#x27;s domain and selling its peaceful citizens into slavery. However, shortly after they arrive on Dhrall, a supernatural being (later revealed to be Omago&#x27;s wife, Ara) bewitches the Amarite force into believing that the Wasteland of the Vlagh is covered in gold dust. The church&#x27;s soldiers, forced into a supernatural frenzy, rush towards the Wasteland, leaving their camp unguarded and freeing the natives whom they have enslaved.

Meanwhile, the combined Armies of Narasan, Sorgan, and Red-Beard, along with a group of farmers-turned-soldiers led by Omago face off against the minions of the Vlagh, who have evolved into three new forms. Bat-insect hybrids serve as scouts for the Vlagh, while large snake-men and giant spiders with shells like turtles comprise its combat force. Although they initially appear formidable, these creatures are revealed to be slow and stupid, and are easily held back by the defenders.

Longbow has a dream in which a mysterious woman (again, later revealed to be Ara) encourages him to pull the defending armies back, thereby allowing the Amarite church&#x27;s expedition to advance towards the Wasteland. Still believing they will find gold, the church army engages the minions of the Vlagh. While they are fighting, one of the dreamers redirects the course of a river, causing it to drown both invading forces.

===Crystal Gorge===

The Crystal Gorge is another book by David and Leigh Eddings. Like the Treasured one, it is divided into sections which give background information on a particular character, and summarizes the story from the first book to the present from the character&#x27;s point of view.
After the battle in Veltan&#x27;s domain, the important characters meet at Veltan&#x27;s home to discuss
their next moves. They agree to separate their forces until one of the children gives them an indication to where the servants of the Vlagh are going to mount their third invasion. Narasan and his Trogite soldiers go to Aracia&#x27;s domain (who knowing that her domain is defenseless tries to convince Dahlaine that the servants of the Vlagh are going to attack her domain next.)
In the end they split up their forces, and the Maags go north to Dahlaine&#x27;s Domain. Rabbit, Longbow, Red-beard and Keselo go with them. Ekial and Veltan go to the land of the Malavi to hire Malavi horse warriors, and then with a little tampering from Veltan get the warriors to Dahlaine&#x27;s country. They discover that the servants of the Vlagh are stirring up trouble in the numerous clans of Dahlaine&#x27;s nations. Lillabeth has her dream, which the other Dreamers know about and tell Zelana that Aracia is trying to keep Lillabeth quiet. Zelana goes to intimidate her sister and learn of the dream. The defenders get rid of the insane Atazkan chief and find the source of the plague which is not a plague - it is actually the poison of the servants of the Vlagh.
Afterwards, the defenders fortify Crystal Gorge, with the help of the Malavi, the Trogites, and the Maags, the defenders fight back the minions of the Vlagh. Finally, a tornado of fire sweeps through crystal gorge, created by the Dreamers, destroying the servants of the Vlagh.

===The Younger Gods===
The end of the 25 eons has arrived. The Elder Gods are getting sleepier and sleepier by the second, but are forced to stay awake and alert as Alcevan, a servant of The Vlagh, convinces Aracia to kill Lillabeth, saying that The &#x27;Wicked Enalla&#x27; is trying to usurp Aracia&#x27;s throne. And by killing Lillabeth, Enalla will be prevented from ever taking Aracia&#x27;s place again. Aracia, in her insanity, tries to kill Lillabeth, but in her madness forgets the most fundamental law that defines the gods of Dhrall: they may not kill. Aracia thus ceases to exist.

Meanwhile, Longbow, Omago and others journey to the Wasteland. Omago uses his newly remembered powers to block the Vlagh from the Overmind and order all the bugs out their nest. The Vlagh comes out, as Aracia&#x27;s copy, and watches as her bug-servants eat the other bugs til there are no more and the Vlagh is all alone. The Vlagh screams out loud, (Omago comments that &quot;It will probably continue on forever&quot;) and Longbow is delighted as he had seen the Vlagh suffer, and says that Misty-Water is now avenged. Screaming in the same cave but a different cavern is the servant who convinced Aracia to attempt to kill Lillabeth. And they shall scream for eternity.

Because of Aracia&#x27;s disappearance, Eleria is convinced to be Aracia&#x27;s replacement, since Balacenia and her can no longer merge, as Zelana&#x27;s hands-off approach to parenting and Eleria&#x27;s subsequent time being raised by dolphins means they are now too different. Eleria requests that Ara resurrect Longbow&#x27;s love Misty-Water, who was killed by the Vlagh years before. Ara agrees, and both the Elder and Younger Gods attend the wedding.

The story ends with Zelana and Eleria going to sleep, with Balacenia promising to awaken them when she is ready to sleep again in another 25,000 year.

<text>A refrigerator, commonly shortened to fridge, is a commercial and home appliance consisting of a thermally insulated compartment and a heat pump (mechanical, electronic or chemical) that transfers heat from its inside to its external environment so that its inside is cooled to a temperature below the room temperature. Refrigeration is an essential food storage technique around the world. The low temperature reduces the reproduction rate of bacteria, so the refrigerator lowers the rate of spoilage. A refrigerator maintains a temperature a few degrees above the freezing point of water. The optimal temperature range for perishable food storage is . A freezer is a specialized refrigerator, or portion of a refrigerator, that maintains its contents’ temperature below the freezing point of water. The refrigerator replaced the icebox, which had been a common household appliance for almost a century and a half. The United States Food and Drug Administration recommends that the refrigerator be kept at or below and that the freezer be regulated at .

The first cooling systems for food involved ice. Artificial refrigeration began in the mid-1750s, and developed in the early 1800s. In 1834, the first working vapor-compression refrigeration system, using the same technology seen in air conditioners, was built. The first commercial ice-making machine was invented in 1854. In 1913, refrigerators for home use were invented. In 1923 Frigidaire introduced the first self-contained unit. The introduction of Freon in the 1920s expanded the refrigerator market during the 1930s. Home freezers as separate compartments (larger than necessary just for ice cubes) were introduced in 1940. Frozen foods, previously a luxury item, became commonplace.

Freezer units are used in households as well as in industry and commerce. Commercial refrigerator and freezer units were in use for almost 40 years prior to the common home models. The freezer-over-refrigerator style had been the basic style since the 1940s, until modern, side-by-side refrigerators broke the trend. A vapor compression cycle is used in most household refrigerators, refrigerator–freezers and freezers. Newer refrigerators may include automatic defrosting, chilled water, and ice from a dispenser in the door.

Domestic refrigerators and freezers for food storage are made in a range of sizes. Among the smallest are Peltier-type refrigerators designed to chill beverages. A large domestic refrigerator stands as tall as a person and may be about wide with a capacity of . Refrigerators and freezers may be free standing, or built into a kitchen. The refrigerator allows the modern household to keep food fresh for longer than before. Freezers allow people to buy perishable food in bulk and eat it at leisure, and make bulk purchases.

==History==
===Technology development===
Ancient origins

Ancient Iranians were among the first to invent a form of cooler utilizing the principles of evaporative cooling and radiative cooling called yakhchāls. These complexes used subterranean storage spaces, a large thickly insulated above-ground domed structure, and outfitted with badgirs (wind-catchers) and series of qanats (aqueducts).

Pre-electric refrigeration

In modern times, before the invention of the modern electric refrigerator, icehouses and iceboxes were used to provide cool storage for most of the year. Placed near freshwater lakes or packed with snow and ice during the winter, they were once very common. Natural means are still used to cool foods today. On mountainsides, runoff from melting snow is a convenient way to cool drinks, and during the winter one can keep milk fresh much longer just by keeping it outdoors. The word &quot;refrigeratory&quot; was used at least as early as the 17th century.

Artificial refrigeration
The history of artificial refrigeration began when Scottish professor William Cullen designed a small refrigerating machine in 1755. Cullen used a pump to create a partial vacuum over a container of diethyl ether, which then boiled, absorbing heat from the surrounding air. The experiment even created a small amount of ice, but had no practical application at that time.
In 1805, American inventor Oliver Evans described a closed vapor-compression refrigeration cycle for the production of ice by ether under vacuum. In 1820, the British scientist Michael Faraday liquefied ammonia and other gases by using high pressures and low temperatures, and in 1834, an American expatriate in Great Britain, Jacob Perkins, built the first working vapor-compression refrigeration system. It was a closed-cycle device that could operate continuously. A similar attempt was made in 1842, by American physician, John Gorrie, who built a working prototype, but it was a commercial failure. American engineer Alexander Twining took out a British patent in 1850 for a vapor compression system that used ether.

The first practical vapor compression refrigeration system was built by James Harrison, a Scottish Australian. His 1856 patent was for a vapor compression system using ether, alcohol or ammonia. He built a mechanical ice-making machine in 1851 on the banks of the Barwon River at Rocky Point in Geelong, Victoria, and his first commercial ice-making machine followed in 1854. Harrison also introduced commercial vapor-compression refrigeration to breweries and meat packing houses, and by 1861, a dozen of his systems were in operation.

The first gas absorption refrigeration system (compressor-less and powered by a heat-source) was developed by Edward Toussaint of France in 1859 and patented in 1860. It used gaseous ammonia dissolved in water (&quot;aqua ammonia&quot;).

Carl von Linde, an engineering professor at the Technological University Munich in Germany, patented an improved method of liquefying gases in 1876, creating the first reliable and efficient compressed-ammonia refrigerator. His new process made possible the use of gases such as ammonia (NH3), sulfur dioxide (SO2) and methyl chloride (CH3Cl) as refrigerants, which were widely used for that purpose until the late 1920s despite safety concerns. In 1895 he discovered the refrigeration cycle.

=== Electric refrigerators ===

In 1894, Hungarian inventor and industrialist István Röck started to manufacture a large industrial ammonia refrigerator which was powered by electric compressors (together with the Esslingen Machine Works). Its electric compressors were manufactured by the Ganz Works. At the 1896 Millennium Exhibition, Röck and the Esslingen Machine Works presented a 6-tonne capacity artificial ice producing plant. In 1906, the first large Hungarian cold store (with a capacity of 3,000 tonnes, the largest in Europe) opened in Tóth Kálmán Street, Budapest, the machine was manufactured by the Ganz Works. Until nationalisation after the Second World War, large-scale industrial refrigerator production in Hungary was in the hands of Röck and Ganz Works.

Commercial refrigerator and freezer units, which go by many other names, were in use for almost 40 years prior to the common home models. They used gas systems such as ammonia (R-717) or sulfur dioxide (R-764), which occasionally leaked, making them unsafe for home use. Practical household refrigerators were introduced in 1915 and gained wider acceptance in the United States in the 1930s as prices fell and non-toxic, non-flammable synthetic refrigerants such as Freon-12 (R-12) were introduced. However, R-12 proved to be damaging to the ozone layer, causing governments to issue a ban on its use in new refrigerators and air-conditioning systems in 1994. The less harmful replacement for R-12, R-134a (tetrafluoroethane), has been in common use since 1990, but R-12 is still found in many old systems.

Refrigeration, continually operated, typically consumes up to 50% of the energy used by a supermarket. Doors, made of glass to allow inspection of contents, improve efficiency significantly over open display cases, which use 1.3 times the energy.

===Residential refrigerators===

In 1913, the first electric refrigerators for home and domestic use were invented and produced by Fred W. Wolf of Fort Wayne, Indiana, with models consisting of a unit that was mounted on top of an ice box. His first device, produced over the next few years in several hundred units, was called DOMELRE. In 1914, engineer Nathaniel B. Wales of Detroit, Michigan, introduced an idea for a practical electric refrigeration unit, which later became the basis for the Kelvinator. A self-contained refrigerator, with a compressor on the bottom of the cabinet was invented by Alfred Mellowes in 1916. Mellowes produced this refrigerator commercially but was bought out by William C. Durant in 1918, who started the Frigidaire company to mass-produce refrigerators. In 1918, Kelvinator company introduced the first refrigerator with any type of automatic control. The absorption refrigerator was invented by Baltzar von Platen and Carl Munters from Sweden in 1922, while they were still students at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. It became a worldwide success and was commercialized by Electrolux. Other pioneers included Charles Tellier, David Boyle, and Raoul Pictet. Carl von Linde was the first to patent and make a practical and compact refrigerator.

These home units usually required the installation of the mechanical parts, motor and compressor, in the basement or an adjacent room while the cold box was located in the kitchen. There was a 1922 model that consisted of a wooden cold box, water-cooled compressor, an ice cube tray and a compartment, and cost $714. (A 1922 Model-T Ford cost about $476.) By 1923, Kelvinator held 80 percent of the market for electric refrigerators. Also in 1923 Frigidaire introduced the first self-contained unit. About this same time porcelain-covered metal cabinets began to appear. Ice cube trays were introduced more and more during the 1920s; up to this time freezing was not an auxiliary function of the modern refrigerator.

The first refrigerator to see widespread use was the General Electric &quot;Monitor-Top&quot; refrigerator introduced in 1927, so-called, by the public, because of its resemblance to the gun turret on the ironclad warship USS &quot;Monitor&quot; of the 1860s. The compressor assembly, which emitted a great deal of heat, was placed above the cabinet, and enclosed by a decorative ring. Over a million units were produced. As the refrigerating medium, these refrigerators used either sulfur dioxide, which is corrosive to the eyes and may cause loss of vision, painful skin burns and lesions, or methyl formate, which is highly flammable, harmful to the eyes, and toxic if inhaled or ingested.

The introduction of Freon in the 1920s expanded the refrigerator market during the 1930s and provided a safer, low-toxicity alternative to previously used refrigerants. Separate freezers became common during the 1940s; the term for the unit, popular at the time, was deep freeze. These devices, or &quot;appliances&quot;, did not go into mass production for use in the home until after World War II. The 1950s and 1960s saw technical advances like automatic defrosting and automatic ice making. More efficient refrigerators were developed in the 1970s and 1980s, even though environmental issues led to the banning of very effective (Freon) refrigerants. Early refrigerator models (from 1916) had a cold compartment for ice cube trays. From the late 1920s fresh vegetables were successfully processed through freezing by the Postum Company (the forerunner of General Foods), which had acquired the technology when it bought the rights to Clarence Birdseye&#x27;s successful fresh freezing methods.

== Styles of refrigerators ==
The majority of refrigerators were white in the early 1950s, but between the mid-1950s and the present, manufacturers and designers have added color. Pastel colors, such as pink and turquoise, gained popularity in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Certain versions also had brushed chrome plating, which is akin to a stainless steel appearance. During the latter part of the 1960s and the early 1970s, earth tone colors were popular, including Harvest Gold, Avocado Green and almond. In the 1980s, black became fashionable. In the late 1990s stainless steel came into vogue. Since 1961 the Color Marketing Group has attempted to coordinate the colors of appliances and other consumer goods.

==Freezer==

Freezer units are used in households and in industry and commerce. Food stored at or below is safe indefinitely. Most household freezers maintain temperatures from , although some freezer-only units can achieve and lower. Refrigerator freezers generally do not achieve lower than , since the same coolant loop serves both compartments: Lowering the freezer compartment temperature excessively causes difficulties in maintaining above-freezing temperature in the refrigerator compartment. Domestic freezers can be included as a separate compartment in a refrigerator, or can be a separate appliance. Domestic freezers may be either upright, resembling a refrigerator, or chest freezers, wider than tall with the lid or door on top, sacrificing convenience for efficiency and partial immunity to power outages. Many modern upright freezers come with an ice dispenser built into their door. Some upscale models include thermostat displays and controls.

Home freezers as separate compartments (larger than necessary just for ice cubes), or as separate units, were introduced in the United States in 1940. Frozen foods, previously a luxury item, became commonplace.

In 1955 the domestic deep freezer, which was cold enough to allow the owners to freeze fresh food themselves rather than buying food already frozen with Clarence Birdseye&#x27;s process, went on sale.

=== Walk-in freezer ===
There are walk in freezers, as the name implies, they allow for one to walk into the freezer. Safety regulations requires an emergency releases and employers should check to ensure no one will trapped inside when the unit gets locked as hypothermia is possible if one is in freezer for longer periods of time.

== Refrigerator technologies ==



===Compressor refrigerators===
A vapor compression cycle is used in most household refrigerators, refrigerator–freezers and freezers. In this cycle, a circulating refrigerant such as R134a enters a compressor as low-pressure vapor at or slightly below the temperature of the refrigerator interior. The vapor is compressed and exits the compressor as high-pressure superheated vapor. The superheated vapor travels under pressure through coils or tubes that make up the &quot;condenser&quot;; the coils or tubes are passively cooled by exposure to air in the room. The condenser cools the vapor, which liquefies. As the refrigerant leaves the condenser, it is still under pressure but is now only slightly above room temperature. This liquid refrigerant is forced through a metering or throttling device, also known as an expansion valve (essentially a pin-hole sized constriction in the tubing) to an area of much lower pressure. The sudden decrease in pressure results in explosive-like flash evaporation of a portion (typically about half) of the liquid. The latent heat absorbed by this flash evaporation is drawn mostly from adjacent still-liquid refrigerant, a phenomenon known as &quot;auto-refrigeration&quot;. This cold and partially vaporized refrigerant continues through the coils or tubes of the evaporator unit. A fan blows air from the compartment (&quot;box air&quot;) across these coils or tubes and the refrigerant completely vaporizes, drawing further latent heat from the box air. This cooled air is returned to the refrigerator or freezer compartment, and so keeps the box air cold. Note that the cool air in the refrigerator or freezer is still warmer than the refrigerant in the evaporator. Refrigerant leaves the evaporator, now fully vaporized and slightly heated, and returns to the compressor inlet to continue the cycle.

Modern domestic refrigerators are extremely reliable because motor and compressor are integrated within a welded container, &quot;sealed unit&quot;, with greatly reduced likelihood of leakage or contamination. By comparison, externally-coupled refrigeration compressors, such as those in automobile air conditioning, inevitably leak fluid and lubricant past the shaft seals. This leads to a requirement for periodic recharging and, if ignored, possible compressor failure.

====Dual compartment designs====
Refrigerators with two compartments need special design to control the cooling of refrigerator or freezer compartments. Typically, the compressors and condenser coils are mounted at the top of the cabinet, with a single fan to cool them both. This arrangement has a few downsides: each compartment cannot be controlled independently and the more humid refrigerator air is mixed with the dry freezer air.

Multiple manufacturers offer dual compressor models. These models have separate freezer and refrigerator compartments that operate independently of each other, sometimes mounted within a single cabinet. Each has its own separate compressor, condenser and evaporator coils, insulation, thermostat, and door.

A hybrid between the two designs is using a separate fan for each compartment, the Dual Fan approach. Doing so allows for separate control and airflow on a single compressor system.

===Absorption refrigerators===
An absorption refrigerator works differently from a compressor refrigerator, using a source of heat, such as combustion of liquefied petroleum gas, solar thermal energy or an electric heating element. These heat sources are much quieter than the compressor motor in a typical refrigerator. A fan or pump might be the only mechanical moving parts; reliance on convection is considered impractical.

Other uses of an absorption refrigerator (or &quot;chiller&quot;) include large systems used in office buildings or complexes such as hospitals and universities. These large systems are used to chill a brine solution that is circulated through the building.

===Peltier effect refrigerators===
The Peltier effect uses electricity to pump heat directly; refrigerators employing this system are sometimes used for camping, or in situations where noise is not acceptable. They can be totally silent (if a fan for air circulation is not fitted) but are less energy-efficient than other methods.

===Ultra-low temperature refrigerators===
&quot;Ultra-cold&quot; or &quot;ultra-low temperature (ULT)&quot; (typically ) freezers, as used for storing biological samples, also generally employ two stages of cooling, but in cascade. The lower temperature stage uses methane, or a similar gas, as a refrigerant, with its condenser kept at around −40°C by a second stage which uses a more conventional refrigerant.

For much lower temperatures, laboratories usually purchase liquid nitrogen (), kept in a Dewar flask, into which the samples are suspended. Cryogenic chest freezers can achieve temperatures of down to , and may include a liquid nitrogen backup.

===Other refrigerators===
Alternatives to the vapor-compression cycle not in current mass production include:

* Acoustic cooling
* Air cycle
* Magnetic cooling
* Malone engine
* Pulse tube
* Stirling cycle
* Thermoelectric cooling 
* Thermionic cooling
* Vortex tube
* Water cycle systems.
==Layout==

Many modern refrigerator/freezers have the freezer on top and the refrigerator on the bottom. Most refrigerator-freezers—except for manual defrost models or cheaper units—use what appears to be two thermostats. Only the refrigerator compartment is properly temperature controlled. When the refrigerator gets too warm, the thermostat starts the cooling process and a fan circulates the air around the freezer. During this time, the refrigerator also gets colder. The freezer control knob only controls the amount of air that flows into the refrigerator via a damper system. Changing the refrigerator temperature will inadvertently change the freezer temperature in the opposite direction. Changing the freezer temperature will have no effect on the refrigerator temperature. The freezer control may also be adjusted to compensate for any refrigerator adjustment.

This means the refrigerator may become too warm. However, because only enough air is diverted to the refrigerator compartment, the freezer usually re-acquires the set temperature quickly, unless the door is opened. When a door is opened, either in the refrigerator or the freezer, the fan in some units stops immediately to prevent excessive frost build up on the freezer&#x27;s evaporator coil, because this coil is cooling two areas. When the freezer reaches temperature, the unit cycles off, no matter what the refrigerator temperature is. Modern computerized refrigerators do not use the damper system. The computer manages fan speed for both compartments, although air is still blown from the freezer.

== Features ==
Newer refrigerators may include:
*Automatic defrosting
*A power failure warning that alerts the user by flashing a temperature display. It may display the maximum temperature reached during the power failure, and whether frozen food has defrosted or may contain harmful bacteria.
*Chilled water and ice from a dispenser in the door. Water and ice dispensing became available in the 1970s. In some refrigerators, the process of making ice is built-in so the user doesn&#x27;t have to manually use ice trays. Some refrigerators have water chillers and water filtration systems.
*Cabinet rollers that lets the refrigerator roll out for easier cleaning
*Adjustable shelves and trays
*A status indicator that notifies when it is time to change the water filter
*An in-door ice caddy, which relocates the ice-maker storage to the freezer door and saves approximately of usable freezer space. It is also removable, and helps to prevent ice-maker clogging.
*A cooling zone in the refrigerator door shelves. Air from the freezer section is diverted to the refrigerator door, to cool milk or juice stored in the door shelf.
*A drop down door built into the refrigerator main door, giving easy access to frequently used items such as milk, thus saving energy by not having to open the main door.
*A Fast Freeze function to rapidly cool foods by running the compressor for a predetermined amount of time and thus temporarily lowering the freezer temperature below normal operating levels. It is recommended to use this feature several hours before adding more than 1 kg of unfrozen food to the freezer. For freezers without this feature, lowering the temperature setting to the coldest will have the same effect.
* Freezer Defrost: Early freezer units accumulated ice crystals around the freezing units. This was a result of humidity introduced into the units when the doors to the freezer were opened condensing on the cold parts, then freezing. This frost buildup required periodic thawing (&quot;defrosting&quot;) of the units to maintain their efficiency. Manual Defrost (referred to as Cyclic) units are still available. Advances in automatic defrosting eliminating the thawing task were introduced in the 1950s, but are not universal, due to energy performance and cost. These units used a counter that only defrosted the freezer compartment (Freezer Chest) when a specific number of door openings had been made. The units were just a small timer combined with an electrical heater wire that heated the freezer&#x27;s walls for a short amount of time to remove all traces of frost/frosting. Also, early units featured freezer compartments located within the larger refrigerator, and accessed by opening the refrigerator door, and then the smaller internal freezer door; units featuring an entirely separate freezer compartment were introduced in the early 1960s, becoming the industry standard by the middle of that decade.
These older freezer compartments were the main cooling body of the refrigerator, and only maintained a temperature of around , which is suitable for keeping food for a week.

* Butter heater: In the early 1950s, the butter conditioner&#x27;s patent was filed and published by the inventor Nave Alfred E. This feature was supposed to &quot;provide a new and improved food storage receptacle for storing butter or the like which may quickly and easily be removed from the refrigerator cabinet for the purpose of cleaning.&quot; Because of the high interest to the invention, companies in UK, New Zealand, and Australia started to include the feature into the mass refrigerator production and soon it became a symbol of the local culture. However, not long after that it was removed from production as according to the companies this was the only way for them to meet new ecology regulations and they found it inefficient to have a heat generating device inside a refrigerator.

Later advances included automatic ice units and self compartmentalized freezing units.

== Types of domestic refrigerators ==
Domestic refrigerators and freezers for food storage are made in a range of sizes. Among the smallest is a Peltier refrigerator advertised as being able to hold 6 cans of beer. A large domestic refrigerator stands as tall as a person and may be about wide with a capacity of . Some models for small households fit under kitchen work surfaces, usually about high. Refrigerators may be combined with freezers, either stacked with refrigerator or freezer above, below, or side by side. A refrigerator without a frozen food storage compartment may have a small section just to make ice cubes. Freezers may have drawers to store food in, or they may have no divisions (chest freezers).

Refrigerators and freezers may be free-standing, or built into a kitchen&#x27;s cabinet.

Three distinct classes of refrigerator are common:

===Compressor refrigerators===
*Compressor refrigerators are by far the most common type; they make a noticeable noise, but are most efficient and give greatest cooling effect. Portable compressor refrigerators for recreational vehicle (RV) and camping use are expensive but effective and reliable. Refrigeration units for commercial and industrial applications can be made in various sizes, shapes and styles to fit customer needs. Commercial and industrial refrigerators may have their compressors located away from the cabinet (similar to split system air conditioners) to reduce noise nuisance and reduce the load on air conditioning in hot weather.

===Absorption refrigerator===
*Absorption refrigerators may be used in caravans and trailers, and dwellings lacking electricity, such as farms or rural cabins, where they have a long history. They may be powered by any heat source: gas (natural or propane) or kerosene being common. Models made for camping and RV use often have the option of running (inefficiently) on 12 volt battery power.

===Peltier refrigerators===
*Peltier refrigerators are powered by electricity, usually 12 volt DC, but mains-powered wine coolers are available. Peltier refrigerators are inexpensive but inefficient and become progressively more inefficient with increased cooling effect; much of this inefficiency may be related to the temperature differential across the short distance between the &quot;hot&quot; and &quot;cold&quot; sides of the Peltier cell. Peltier refrigerators generally use heat sinks and fans to lower this differential; the only noise produced comes from the fan. Reversing the polarity of the voltage applied to the Peltier cells results in a heating rather than cooling effect.

Other specialized cooling mechanisms may be used for cooling, but have not been applied to domestic or commercial refrigerators.

===Magnetic refrigerator===
*Magnetic refrigerators are refrigerators that work on the magnetocaloric effect. The cooling effect is triggered by placing a metal alloy in a magnetic field.
*Acoustic refrigerators are refrigerators that use resonant linear reciprocating motors/alternators to generate a sound that is converted to heat and cold using compressed helium gas. The heat is discarded and the cold is routed to the refrigerator.

== Energy efficiency ==
In a house without air-conditioning (space heating and/or cooling) refrigerators consume more energy than any other home device. In the early 1990s a competition was held among the major US manufacturers to encourage energy efficiency. Current US models that are Energy Star qualified use 50% less energy than the average 1974 model used. The most energy-efficient unit made in the US consumes about half a kilowatt-hour per day (equivalent to 20 W continuously). But even ordinary units are reasonably efficient; some smaller units use less than 0.2 kWh per day (equivalent to 8 W continuously).
Larger units, especially those with large freezers and icemakers, may use as much as 4 kW·h per day (equivalent to 170 W continuously).
The European Union uses a letter-based mandatory energy efficiency rating label, with A being the most efficient, instead of the Energy Star.

For US refrigerators, the Consortium on Energy Efficiency (CEE) further differentiates between Energy Star qualified refrigerators. Tier 1 refrigerators are those that are 20% to 24.9% more efficient than the Federal minimum standards set by the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act (NAECA). Tier 2 are those that are 25% to 29.9% more efficient. Tier 3 is the highest qualification, for those refrigerators that are at least 30% more efficient than Federal standards. About 82% of the Energy Star qualified refrigerators are Tier 1, with 13% qualifying as Tier 2, and just 5% at Tier 3.

Besides the standard style of compressor refrigeration used in ordinary household refrigerators and freezers, there are technologies such as absorption and magnetic refrigeration. Although these designs generally use a much more energy than compressor refrigeration, other qualities such as silent operation or the ability to use gas can favor their use in small enclosures, a mobile environment or in environments where failure of refrigeration must not be possible.

Many refrigerators made in the 1930s and 1940s were far more efficient than most that were made later. This is partly due to features added later, such as auto-defrost, that reduced efficiency. Additionally, after World War 2, refrigerator style became more important than efficiency. This was especially true in the US in the 1970s, when side-by-side models (known as American fridge-freezers outside of the US) with ice dispensers and water chillers became popular. The amount of insulation used was also often decreased to reduce refrigerator case size and manufacturing costs.

===Improvement===
Over time standards of refrigerator energy efficiency have been introduced and tightened, which has driven steady improvement; 21st-century refrigerators are typically three times more energy-efficient than in the 1930s.

The efficiency of older refrigerators can be improved by regular defrosting (if the unit is manual defrost) and cleaning, replacing deteriorated door seals with new ones, not setting the thermostat colder than actually required (a refrigerator does not usually need to be colder than ), and replacing insulation, where applicable. Cleaning condenser coils to remove dust impeding heat flow, and ensuring that there is space for air flow around the condenser can improve efficiency.

==== Auto defrosting ====

Frost-free refrigerators and freezers use electric fans to cool the appropriate compartment. This could be called a &quot;fan forced&quot; refrigerator, whereas manual defrost units rely on colder air lying at the bottom, versus the warm air at the top to achieve adequate cooling. The air is drawn in through an inlet duct and passed through the evaporator where it is cooled, the air is then circulated throughout the cabinet via a series of ducts and vents. Because the air passing the evaporator is supposedly warm and moist, frost begins to form on the evaporator (especially on a freezer&#x27;s evaporator). In cheaper and/or older models, a defrost cycle is controlled via a mechanical timer. This timer is set to shut off the compressor and fan and energize a heating element located near or around the evaporator for about 15 to 30 minutes at every 6 to 12 hours. This melts any frost or ice build-up and allows the refrigerator to work normally once more. It is believed that frost free units have a lower tolerance for frost, due to their air-conditioner-like evaporator coils. Therefore, if a door is left open accidentally (especially the freezer), the defrost system may not remove all frost, in this case, the freezer (or refrigerator) must be defrosted.

If the defrosting system melts all the ice before the timed defrosting period ends, then a small device (called a defrost limiter) acts like a thermostat and shuts off the heating element to prevent too large a temperature fluctuation, it also prevents hot blasts of air when the system starts again, should it finish defrosting early. On some early frost-free models, the defrost limiter also sends a signal to the defrost timer to start the compressor and fan as soon as it shuts off the heating element before the timed defrost cycle ends. When the defrost cycle is completed, the compressor and fan are allowed to cycle back on.

Frost-free refrigerators, including some early frost-free refrigerators/freezers that used a cold plate in their refrigerator section instead of airflow from the freezer section, generally don&#x27;t shut off their refrigerator fans during defrosting. This allows consumers to leave food in the main refrigerator compartment uncovered, and also helps keep vegetables moist. This method also helps reduce energy consumption, because the refrigerator is above freeze point and can pass the warmer-than-freezing air through the evaporator or cold plate to aid the defrosting cycle.

==== Inverter ====

With the advent of digital inverter compressors, the energy consumption is even further reduced than a single-speed induction motor compressor, and thus contributes far less in the way of greenhouse gases.

The energy consumption of a refrigerator is also dependent on the type of refrigeration being done. For instance, Inverter Refrigerators consume comparatively less energy than a typical non-inverter refrigerator. In an inverter refrigerator, the compressor is used conditionally on requirement basis. For instance, an inverter refrigerator might use less energy during the winters than it does during the summers. This is because the compressor works for a shorter time than it does during the summers.

Further, newer models of inverter compressor refrigerators take into account various external and internal conditions to adjust the compressor speed and thus optimize cooling and energy consumption. Most of them use at least 4 sensors which help detect variance in external temperature, internal temperature owing to opening of the refrigerator door or keeping new food inside; humidity and usage patterns. Depending on the sensor inputs, the compressor adjusts its speed. For example, if door is opened or new food is kept, the sensor detects an increase in temperature inside the cabin and signals the compressor to increase its speed till a pre-determined temperature is attained. After which, the compressor runs at a minimum speed to just maintain the internal temperature. The compressor typically runs between 1200 and 4500 rpm.
Inverter compressors not only optimizes cooling but is also superior in terms of durability and energy efficiency.
A device consumes maximum energy and undergoes maximum wear and tear when it switches itself on. As an inverter compressor never switches itself off and instead runs on varying speed, it minimizes wear and tear and energy usage.
LG played a significant role in improving inverter compressors as we know it by reducing the friction points in the compressor and thus introducing Linear Inverter Compressors. Conventionally, all domestic refrigerators use a reciprocating drive which is connected to the piston. But in a linear inverter compressor, the piston which is a permanent magnet is suspended between two electromagnets. The AC changes the magnetic poles of the electromagnet, which results in the push and pull that compresses the refrigerant. LG claims that this helps reduce energy consumption by 32% and noise by 25% compared to their conventional compressors.

=== Form factor ===
The physical design of refrigerators also plays a large part in its energy efficiency. The most efficient is the chest-style freezer, as its top-opening design minimizes convection when opening the doors, reducing the amount of warm moist air entering the freezer. On the other hand, in-door ice dispensers cause more heat leakage, contributing to an increase in energy consumption.

== Impact ==

=== Global adoption ===
The gradual global adoption of refrigerators marks a transformative era in food preservation and domestic convenience. Since the refrigerators introduction in the 20th century, refrigerators have transitioned from being luxurious items to everyday commodities which have altered the understandings of food storage practices. Refrigerators have significantly impacted various aspects of many individual&#x27;s daily lives by providing food safety to people around the world spanning across a wide variety of cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds.

The global adoption of refrigerators has also changed how societies handle their food supply. The introduction of the refrigerator in different societies has resulted in the monetization and industrialized mass food production systems which are commonly linked to increased food waste, animal wastes, and dangerous chemical wastes being traced back into different ecosystems. In addition, refrigerators have also provided an easier way to access food for many individuals around the world, with many options that commercialization has promoted leaning towards low-nutrient dense foods.

After consumer refrigerators became financially viable for production and sale on a large scale, their prevalence around the globe expanded greatly. In the United States, an estimated 99.5% of households have a refrigerator. Refrigerator ownership is more common in developed Western countries, but has stayed relatively low in Eastern and developing countries despite its growing popularity. Throughout Eastern Europe and the Middle East, only 80% of the population own refrigerators. In addition to this, 65% of the population in China are stated to have refrigerators. The distribution of consumer refrigerators is also skewed as urban areas exhibit larger refrigeration ownership percentages compared to rural areas.

=== Supplantation of the ice trade ===
The ice trade was an industry in the 19th and 20th centuries of the harvesting, transportation, and sale of natural and artificial ice for the purposes of refrigeration and consumption. The majority of the ice used for trade was harvested from North America and transported globally with some smaller operations working out of Norway. With the introduction of more affordable large and home scale refrigeration around the 1920s, the need for large scale ice harvest and transportation was no longer needed, and the ice trade subsequently slowed and shrank to smaller scale local services or disappeared altogether.

=== Effect on diet and lifestyle ===
The refrigerator allows households to keep food fresh for longer than before. The most notable improvement is for meat and other highly perishable wares, which previously needed to be preserved or otherwise processed for long-term storage and transport. This change in the supply chains of food products led to a marked increase in the quality of food in areas where refrigeration was being used. Additionally, the increased freshness and shelf life of food caused by the advent of refrigeration in addition to growing global communication methods has resulted in an increase in cultural exchange through food products from different regions of the world. There have also been claims that this increase in the quality of food is responsible for an increase in the height of United States citizens around the early 1900s.

Refrigeration has also contributed to a decrease in the quality of food in some regions. By allowing, in part, for the phenomenon of globalization in the food sector, refrigeration has made the creation and transportation of ultra-processed foods and convenience foods inexpensive, leading to their prevalence, especially in lower-income regions. These regions of lessened access to higher quality foods are referred to as food deserts.

Freezers allow people to buy food in bulk and eat it at leisure, and bulk purchases may save money. Ice cream, a popular commodity of the 20th century, could previously only be obtained by traveling to where the product was made and eating it on the spot. Now it is a common food item. Ice on demand not only adds to the enjoyment of cold drinks, but is useful for first-aid, and for cold packs that can be kept frozen for picnics or in case of emergency.

== Temperature zones and ratings ==
===Residential units===
The capacity of a refrigerator is measured in either liters or cubic feet. Typically the volume of a combined refrigerator-freezer is split with 1/3 to 1/4 of the volume allocated to the freezer although these values are highly variable.

Temperature settings for refrigerator and freezer compartments are often given arbitrary numbers by manufacturers (for example, 1 through 9, warmest to coldest), but generally is ideal for the refrigerator compartment and for the freezer. Some refrigerators must be within certain external temperature parameters to run properly. This can be an issue when placing units in an unfinished area, such as a garage.

Some refrigerators are now divided into four zones to store different types of food:
* (freezer)
* (meat zone)
* (cooling zone)
* (crisper)

European freezers, and refrigerators with a freezer compartment, have a four-star rating system to grade freezers.
Although both the three- and four-star ratings specify the same storage times and same minimum temperature of , only a four-star freezer is intended for freezing fresh food, and may include a &quot;fast freeze&quot; function (runs the compressor continually, down to as low as ) to facilitate this. Three (or fewer) stars are used for frozen food compartments that are only suitable for storing frozen food; introducing fresh food into such a compartment is likely to result in unacceptable temperature rises. This difference in categorization is shown in the design of the 4-star logo, where the &quot;standard&quot; three stars are displayed in a box using &quot;positive&quot; colours, denoting the same normal operation as a 3-star freezer, and the fourth star showing the additional fresh food/fast freeze function is prefixed to the box in &quot;negative&quot; colours or with other distinct formatting. 

Most European refrigerators include a moist cold refrigerator section (which does require (automatic) defrosting at irregular intervals) and a (rarely frost-free) freezer section.

== Disposal ==
An increasingly important environmental concern is the disposal of old refrigerators—initially because chlorofluorocarbon coolants damage the ozone layer—but as older generation refrigerators wear out, the destruction of CFC-bearing insulation also causes concern. Modern refrigerators usually use a refrigerant called HFC-134a (1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane), which, unlike CFCs, does not deplete the ozone layer, although it still is a quite potent greenhouse gas. HFC-134a is becoming much rarer in Europe, where newer refrigerants are being used instead. The main refrigerant now used is R-600a (isobutane), which has a smaller effect on the atmosphere if released. There have been reports of refrigerators exploding if the refrigerant leaks isobutane in the presence of a spark. If the coolant leaks into the refrigerator, at times when the door is not being opened (such as overnight) the concentration of coolant in the air within the refrigerator can build up to form an explosive mixture that can be ignited either by a spark from the thermostat or when the light comes on as the door is opened, resulting in documented cases of serious property damage and injury or even death from the resulting explosion.

Disposal of discarded refrigerators is regulated, often mandating the removal of doors for safety reasons. Children have been asphyxiated while playing with discarded refrigerators, particularly older models with latching doors. Since the 1950s regulations in many places have banned the use of refrigerator doors that cannot be opened by pushing from inside. Modern units use a magnetic door gasket that holds the door sealed but allows it to be pushed open from the inside. This gasket was invented, developed and manufactured by Max Baermann (1903–1984) of Bergisch Gladbach/Germany.

Regarding total life-cycle costs, many governments offer incentives to encourage recycling of old refrigerators. One example is the Phoenix refrigerator program launched in Australia. This government incentive picked up old refrigerators, paying their owners for &quot;donating&quot; the refrigerator. The refrigerator was then refurbished, with new door seals, a thorough cleaning, and the removal of items such as the cover that is strapped to the back of many older units. The resulting refrigerators, now over 10% more efficient, were then given to low-income families. The United States also has a program for collecting and replacing older, less-efficient refrigerators and other white goods. These programs seek to replace large appliances that are old and inefficient or faulty by newer, more energy-efficient appliances, to reduce the cost imposed on lower-income families, and reduce pollution caused by the older appliances.

<text>Joseph David Murray (born May 3, 1961) is an American animator, cartoonist, illustrator, writer, producer, and director. He is best known as the creator of Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life,&quot; Cartoon Network&#x27;s &quot;Camp Lazlo&quot;, and PBS Kids&#x27; &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Luna!.&quot; Murray is the winner of two Primetime Emmy Awards for &quot;Camp Lazlo&quot; and the TV film &quot;Camp Lazlo: Where&#x27;s Lazlo?.&quot;

== Early life ==
Born and raised in San Jose, California, Joe Murray said that he developed an interest in working as an artist as a career when he was three years old, but his father didn&#x27;t approve. According to Murray, his kindergarten teacher told his mother that he was the only student who drew zippers on pants and breasts on women. Murray credits his Leland High School art teacher Mark Briggs for teaching him &quot;so much about my art.&quot; At age 16, he became a full-time artist, drawing caricatures of people and animals at an amusement park in his spare time.

Taking the position of political cartoonist for a newspaper in San Jose, Murray&#x27;s cartoons often targeted then-President Jimmy Carter. In a 2007 entry on his website, he said that he admired Carter&#x27;s post-presidential work.

Murray has cited Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Walt Kelly, Mark O&#x27;Hare, Max Fleischer, Jay Ward, Tex Avery, Bob Clampett, and Chuck Jones as his main influences.

==Career==
As a young adult, Murray was hired as a designer at an agency. He invested his earnings from the company into independent animated films. At age 20, Murray founded his independent illustration company, Joe Murray Studios (or Joe Murray Productions), in 1981 while still in university. His early attempts at animation date back to 1986 when he joined De Anza College. Murray created several short animated films, his most successful was made in 1987, which was a two-minute animated short titled &quot;The Chore,&quot; which focused on a harried husband who uses his cat as a novel solution while not wanting to do a chore for his wife. He drew the scenes on typing paper and shot the scenes with 16 mm film. For creating &quot;The Chore&quot; Murray earned the Merit Student Academy Award two years later in 1989.
 In the early 1990s, he did the storyboards and layouts on &quot;A Pup Named Scooby-Doo&quot;, &quot;Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;, &quot;Bobby&#x27;s World&quot;, and &quot;The Twisted Tales of Felix the Cat&quot;, while working as a freelancer at Drew Takahashi&#x27;s now-defunct Colossal Pictures studio.

In 1988, he did two network IDs for MTV, and left in 1991 in hopes of starting his own projects. One of the MTV ID&#x27;s Murray created involved the future &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot; character Heffer Wolfe; the ID featured Heffer being pushed out of a building with the MTV logo branded onto his buttocks.

&quot;My Dog Zero&quot;, released in 1992, was Murray&#x27;s third independent film and first color film. Murray said that &quot;My Dog Zero&quot; was his &quot;most gratifying&quot; artistic project to date because of his own &quot;stubbornness&quot; in resolving the obstacles and issues involved in the production, such as lack of funding and lack of resources. With a grant he employed twelve people, mostly university students, to cel-paint the film. According to Murray, when he finished the film, several distributors refused to air it. He appeared at the Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco with a copy of the film and persuaded the staff to air the film with the scheduled films. According to Murray, &quot;My Dog Zero&quot; received &quot;good response&quot;.

To fund the film, Murray initially tried to pre-sell the television show rights to &quot;My Dog Zero&quot; but instead created a separate television series called &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot;.

===&quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot;===
Murray created, and was the executive producer, for the animated series &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot;, which aired on Nickelodeon from 1993 to 1996. He voiced the character Ralph Bighead in the episodes &quot;I Have No Son&quot; and &quot;Wacky Delly&quot;, and a caricature version of himself in &quot;Short Story&quot;.

Originally, the character Rocko appeared in an unpublished comic book titled &quot;Travis&quot;. Murray tried selling the comic book in the late 1980s, but was never successful of getting it in production. Murray wanted funding for &quot;My Dog Zero&quot;, so he wanted Nickelodeon to pre-buy television rights for the series. Murray presented a pencil test to Nickelodeon Studios, which afterwards became interested in buying and airing the show. After deciding that &quot;My Dog Zero&quot; would not work as a television series, Murray combed through his sketchbooks, developed the &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot; concept and submitted it to Nickelodeon, believing that the concept would likely be rejected. According to Murray, around three or four months later he had &quot;forgotten about&quot; the concept and was working on &quot;My Dog Zero&quot; when Linda Simensky informed Murray that Nickelodeon wanted a pilot episode. Murray said that he was glad that he would get funding for &quot;My Dog Zero&quot;.

In 1992, two months prior to the production of season 1 of &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot;, Murray&#x27;s first wife, Diane, committed suicide. Murray had blamed the show being taken as the reason for his wife&#x27;s suicide. Murray felt that he had emotional and physical &quot;unresolved issues&quot; when he moved to Los Angeles. He describes the experience as like participating in &quot;marathon with my pants around my ankles&quot;. Murray initially believed that he would create one season, move back to the San Francisco Bay Area and &quot;clean up the loose ends I had left hanging&quot;. To his surprise Nickelodeon approved new seasons.

After season 3, he decided to hand the project to Stephen Hillenburg, who did most work for season 4 and created &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; shortly after that; Murray continued to manage the cartoon. Murray said that he would completely leave the production after season 4. Murray said that he encouraged the network to continue production. Nickelodeon decided to cancel the series. Murray described all 52 episodes as &quot;top notch&quot; and that, in his view, the quality of a television show may decline as production continues &quot;when you are dealing with volume&quot;.

===Post-&quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot;===
After completing 52 episodes of &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot;, Murray took a break from the animation business and produced two children&#x27;s books and illustrated two others: &quot;Who Asked the Moon to Dinner?&quot; (1999), &quot;The Enormous Mister Schmupsle: An ABC Adventure&quot; (2003), &quot;Hugville&quot; (written by Court Crandall) (2005), and &quot;Funny Cryptograms&quot; (written by Shawn Kennedy).

Murray was working on a web-based cartoon named &quot;The Family Pop&quot;, which was produced in Flash and was in the middle of negotiations for this cartoon just prior to the onset of &quot;Camp Lazlo&quot;. On September 30, 2008, Murray added a new feature to his website, The Tin Box, where Murray posts some of his independent work. The first work posted was &quot;Where&#x27;s Poppa&quot;, a short episode of &quot;The Family Pop&quot;.

===&quot;Camp Lazlo&quot;===

Murray decided to return to television cartooning, this time selling his work to Cartoon Network Studios. In 2005, he produced a pilot for the cartoon &quot;Camp Lazlo&quot;, which was picked up for a 13-episode first season and ran for five seasons, with production ending in November 2007.

On September 8, 2007, the TV movie &quot;Where&#x27;s Lazlo?&quot; won an Emmy for Outstanding Animated Program (For an Hour or More). During the production of &quot;Camp Lazlo&quot;, Murray underwent a divorce.

===Recent work===
Once production finished for &quot;Camp Lazlo&quot;, and the final episodes were delivered, Murray developed a new television series. While he is working out details about production and distribution, he has started work on his next independent film project, &quot;Fish Head&quot;, and publishing &quot;Creating Animated Cartoons with Character&quot;, a book on creating and producing an animated TV series, and working on producing a new short series, entitled &quot;Frog in a Suit&quot; for his web network; KaboingTV.

On April 20, 2010, Murray launched a donation drive on Kickstarter to fund the project, KaboingTV, a web network entirely dedicated to cartoons. By June 5, the project surpassed its goal of $16,800 and Murray developed episodes of his &quot;Frog in a Suit&quot; series for the platform. KaboingTV premiered on March 11, 2011.

Murray worked on the PBS animated series &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Luna!&quot;, which aired from November 2018 to November 2022.

Murray also worked on the hour-long &quot;Rocko&quot; TV special &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life: Static Cling&quot;, which premiered on Netflix on August 9, 2019. This included reprising his voice role as Rachel Bighead. In October 2019, Murray and his wife relocated from California to Belgium, and at the time Murray expressed interest in developing new series for Nickelodeon Europe.

In 2023, Murray completed work on his independent film, now entitled &quot;Fiego and the Magic Fish&quot;. A reimagining of the fairy tale &quot;The Fisherman and His Wife&quot;, the short was produced by his Garden Box Studio in Belgium and received a Cannes Film Festival award for Best Direction for an Animated Film in 2024. 

==Character creation process==
On his personal website, Murray describes his character creation process as &quot;sometimes like playing Frankenstein&quot;.
* He starts with the personality. He shapes the conditions that make the character &quot;tick&quot;, the character&#x27;s imperfections, and the appeal. He asks himself, &quot;Why would I want to tell stories about them?&quot;.
* If he is working with an anthropomorphic series or book with varying animals, he chooses an animal that, in his eyes, match the created personality. According to Murray, this resulted in a social caricature in &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot;.
* If he is working with an anthropomorphic series or book using one animal, he alters the specific character design to match the personality.
* Murray likes to vary eyeballs by size and color. He also varies nostrils. Murray believes that inconsistencies &quot;make it more interesting&quot;.
* Murray then selects colors that, in his view, &quot;feels right&quot;. He believes that yellow and bright colors &quot;match a mood&quot;. If a character is &quot;negative&quot;, he will pick a color that, in his opinion, matches the character.
* If he has to teach a crew of artists how to draw the character, he creates a model sheet for the character.

Murray explains that one of the interesting aspects of character creation is the evolution of the personalities over time. In a one-time movie, the characters will have a static personality, but for a television series, the characters will change from season to season, developing new relationships, and even changing from mere background characters into a main character.

<text>John Frederick Freeman (29 January 1880 – 23 September 1929) was an English poet and essayist, who gave up a successful career in insurance to write full-time.

He was born in London, and started as an office boy aged 13. He was a close friend of Walter de la Mare from 1907, who lobbied hard with Edward Marsh to get Freeman into the &quot;Georgian Poetry&quot; series; with eventual success. De la Mare&#x27;s biographer Theresa Whistler describes him as &quot;tall, gangling, ugly, solemn, punctilious&quot;.

He won the Hawthornden Prize in 1920 with &quot;Poems 1909-1920&quot;. His &quot;Last Hours&quot; was set to music by Ivor Gurney.

<doc id="1036266" wikidata="Q1796200" url="?curid=1036266" title="Finnveden">
<text>Finnveden or Finnheden is one of the ancient &quot;small lands&quot; of Småland. It corresponded to the hundreds of Sunnerbo, Östbo and Västbo. Finnveden had its own judicial system and laws, as did the other &quot;small lands&quot;. Finnveden is situated around lake Bolmen and the river Lagan. Most runestones in Finnveden describe men who died in England. Finnveden is today divided and is a part of the counties of Halland, Kronoberg and Jönköping.
It was first mentioned by Jordanes when he referred to its population as the &quot;Finnaithae&quot; (derived from an old form of &quot;Finnheden&quot;, &quot;Finn(h)aith-&quot;) when describing the nations of Scandza in &quot;Getica&quot;.

==Etymology==
The Scandinavian placenames Finnveden, Finnmark and the province of Finland (which gave name to Finland) are all thought to be derived from &quot;finn&quot;, an ancient Germanic word for nomadic hunter-gatherers (cf. &quot;to find&quot;).

<text>.22 BB Cap (Bulleted Breech Cap), also known as the 6mm Flobert, is a variety of .22 caliber rimfire ammunition. Invented by Louis-Nicolas Flobert in 1845, it was the first rimfire metallic cartridge. The .22 BB Cap and .22 CB Cap are interchangeable and are relatively quiet, low velocity cartridges, designed for indoor target shooting.

==History==
Frenchman Louis-Nicolas Flobert invented the first rimfire metallic cartridge in 1845. His cartridge consisted of a percussion cap with a bullet attached to the top. Flobert then made what he called &quot;parlor guns&quot; for this cartridge, as these rifles and pistols were designed to be shot in indoor shooting parlors in large homes. Usually derived in the 6 mm and 9 mm calibres, it is since then called the Flobert cartridge, but it does not contain any powder; the only propellant substance contained in the cartridge is within the percussion cap. In Europe, the .22 BB Cap and .22 CB Cap are both called 6mm Flobert and are considered the same cartridge.

==Description==
These rimfires closely resemble a .22 caliber air rifle in power and are often used for indoor shooting and close range pest control. Developed for indoor shooting galleries with special &quot;gallery guns&quot;, the .22 BB Cap was the first rimfire cartridge, dating back to 1845. It has no separate propellant charge, relying on the impulse created by the primer alone to fire a round lead ball. This results in a low muzzle velocity of around 700 ft/s (210 m/s) or less. More common is the .22 CB Cap, which fires a slightly heavier conical bullet and is available in a variety of cartridge lengths.

<text>The Order of the October Revolution (, &quot;Orden Oktyabr&#x27;skoy Revolyutsii&quot;) was instituted on 31 October 1967, in time for the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution. It was conferred upon individuals or groups for services furthering communism or the state, or in enhancing the defenses of the Soviet Union, military and civil. It is the second-highest Soviet order, after the Order of Lenin.
The insignia of the Order consisted of a badge, which was a red star with golden rays between the arms; at the centre was a pentagon bearing the image of the cruiser &quot;Aurora&quot; participating in the October Revolution. Above this was a red flag bearing the words &quot;October Revolution&quot; in Russian. A Hammer and Sickle emblem was placed at the bottom. The badge was worn on the left chest with a red ribbon bearing five blue stripes at the centre.

The &quot;Aurora&quot; was itself awarded the Order, the only ship ever to have received the award. Military units and institutions receiving the award applied the order name to their title upon its reception.

<text>Chatswood railway station is a rapid transit and suburban railway station located in the Sydney suburb of Chatswood. It is served by Sydney Trains services; the T1 North Shore &amp; Western Line and the T9 Northern Line, and Sydney Metro North West &amp; Bankstown Line services.

==History==

Chatswood station opened on 1 January 1890 when the North Shore line opened from Hornsby to St Leonards. An island platform was built on 23 May 1900 and a third dock platform brought into use on 12 July 1919. There was a small goods yard, similar to the one at St Leonards, on the western side of the station, beyond the northern end of the platforms. The dock platform on the eastern side of the station was used for electric parcel-van traffic and also for terminating some services from the city, until these were rescheduled to terminate further along the North Shore line from January 1992. It was removed in October 1994. Until 1958 there was a tram terminus in Victoria Avenue beside the station. The station entrance was later integrated with a shopping centre called The Interchange in the mid-1980s.

With the construction of the Chatswood to Epping line, it was decided to redevelop the station to accommodate Chatswood&#x27;s new role as a junction station. The original station, as well as the attached bus interchange and shopping centre were demolished in 2005 and a temporary station was opened where the former platform 3 was located. A new western island platform opened in place of the original island platform on 16 October 2006. The eastern island platform opened in 2008. The signal cabin that was located at the northern end of the station building, was saved and has been preserved as part of the bus interchange.

The new station precinct is known as the Chatswood Transport Interchange (CTI) and consists of the railway station, a bus interchange and pedestrian pathways connecting the precinct to the surrounding streets. The CTI was constructed as a Public Private Partnership and was to include a new shopping plaza called Metro Chatswood and three towers. The private developers, CRI Chatswood, went into receivership whilst construction was underway. As a result, the shopping centre remained closed until 2014 and major construction of the towers was delayed for several years.

From 26 May 2019, Chatswood station became the major terminus of the Metro North West Line which replaced the Epping to Chatswood railway line which closed on 29 September 2018. This will, at a later date be extended to Bankstown via the Sydney Harbour Rail Tunnel. This will leave Platforms 1 and 4 the only platforms served by Sydney Trains, while the two terminating roads are used by the Metro North West Line.

==Station layout==

The station consists of two island platforms – a city-bound platform and an outbound platform. The two centre platforms now serve as the terminus of the Sydney Metro Northwest line. The outer platforms serve the Northern and North Shore lines. A turnback / stabling road is located to the south of the station and is used to terminate some trains from the Sydney Metro.

Access to Chatswood station is provided by a series of pedestrian walkways at three different intersections: Victoria Avenue and Railway Street, Chatswood Mall and Orchard Road, and Post Office Lane and Victor Street. Additional pedestrian entrances are available from Chatswood Central Plaza, adjacent to the north side of the station concourse.

Because the station and tracks are level with the ground, the concourse is actually below street level despite being open-air in nature. The installation of new &quot;jump-proof&quot; opal card ticket barriers in 2018 reduces fare evasion and ensures faster entry into the concourse which features stairs, lifts, and escalators to access the platforms. The station fulfills Sydney Trains&#x27; Easy Access criteria.

==Services==
Chatswood station is served by bus routes operated by Busways, CDC NSW, Keolis Downer Northern Beaches, Transit Systems, and two NightRide routes.

<doc id="1036303" wikidata="Q1205942" url="?curid=1036303" title="Variation of parameters">
<text>In mathematics, variation of parameters, also known as variation of constants, is a general method to solve inhomogeneous linear ordinary differential equations.

For first-order inhomogeneous linear differential equations it is usually possible to find solutions via integrating factors or undetermined coefficients with considerably less effort, although those methods leverage heuristics that involve guessing and do not work for all inhomogeneous linear differential equations.

Variation of parameters extends to linear partial differential equations as well, specifically to inhomogeneous problems for linear evolution equations like the heat equation, wave equation, and vibrating plate equation. In this setting, the method is more often known as Duhamel&#x27;s principle, named after Jean-Marie Duhamel (1797–1872) who first applied the method to solve the inhomogeneous heat equation. Sometimes variation of parameters itself is called Duhamel&#x27;s principle and vice versa.

== History ==

The method of variation of parameters was first sketched by the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler (1707–1783), and later completed by the Italian-French mathematician Joseph-Louis Lagrange (1736–1813).

A forerunner of the method of variation of a celestial body&#x27;s orbital elements appeared in Euler&#x27;s work in 1748, while he was studying the mutual perturbations of Jupiter and Saturn. In his 1749 study of the motions of the earth, Euler obtained differential equations for the orbital elements. In 1753, he applied the method to his study of the motions of the moon.

Lagrange first used the method in 1766. Between 1778 and 1783, he further developed the method in two series of memoirs: one on variations in the motions of the planets and another on determining the orbit of a comet from three observations. During 1808–1810, Lagrange gave the method of variation of parameters its final form in a third series of papers.

== Description of method ==

Given an ordinary non-homogeneous linear differential equation of order &quot;n&quot;

Let formula_1 be a basis of the vector space of solutions of the corresponding homogeneous equation

Then a particular solution to the non-homogeneous equation is given by

where the formula_2 are differentiable functions which are assumed to satisfy the conditions

Starting with (), repeated differentiation combined with repeated use of () gives
One last differentiation gives

By substituting () into () and applying () and () it follows that
The linear system ( and ) of &quot;n&quot; equations can then be solved using Cramer&#x27;s rule yielding

:formula_3

where formula_4 is the Wronskian determinant of the basis formula_1 and formula_6 is the Wronskian determinant of the basis with the &quot;i&quot;-th column replaced by formula_7

The particular solution to the non-homogeneous equation can then be written as

:formula_8

== Intuitive explanation ==

Consider the equation of the forced dispersionless spring, in suitable units:
:formula_9
Here is the displacement of the spring from the equilibrium , and is an external applied force that depends on time. When the external force is zero, this is the homogeneous equation (whose solutions are linear combinations of sines and cosines, corresponding to the spring oscillating with constant total energy).

We can construct the solution physically, as follows. Between times formula_10 and formula_11, the momentum corresponding to the solution has a net change formula_12 (see: Impulse (physics)). A solution to the inhomogeneous equation, at the present time , is obtained by linearly superposing the solutions obtained in this manner, for going between 0 and .

The homogeneous initial-value problem, representing a small impulse formula_12 being added to the solution at time formula_10, is
:formula_15
The unique solution to this problem is easily seen to be formula_16. The linear superposition of all of these solutions is given by the integral:
:formula_17

To verify that this satisfies the required equation:
:formula_18
:formula_19
as required (see: Leibniz integral rule).

The general method of variation of parameters allows for solving an inhomogeneous linear equation
:formula_20
by means of considering the second-order linear differential operator &quot;L&quot; to be the net force, thus the total impulse imparted to a solution between time &quot;s&quot; and &quot;s&quot;+&quot;ds&quot; is &quot;F&quot;(&quot;s&quot;)&quot;ds&quot;. Denote by formula_21 the solution of the homogeneous initial value problem 
:formula_22
Then a particular solution of the inhomogeneous equation is 
:formula_23
the result of linearly superposing the infinitesimal homogeneous solutions. There are generalizations to higher order linear differential operators.

In practice, variation of parameters usually involves the fundamental solution of the homogeneous problem, the infinitesimal solutions formula_21 then being given in terms of explicit linear combinations of linearly independent fundamental solutions. In the case of the forced dispersionless spring, the kernel formula_25 is the associated decomposition into fundamental solutions.

== Examples ==

=== First-order equation ===
:formula_26
The complementary solution to our original (inhomogeneous) equation is the general solution of the corresponding homogeneous equation (written below):
:formula_27
This homogeneous differential equation can be solved by different methods, for example separation of variables:
:formula_28

:formula_29

:formula_30

:formula_31

:formula_32

:formula_33
The complementary solution to our original equation is therefore:
:formula_34
Now we return to solving the non-homogeneous equation:
: formula_35
Using the method variation of parameters, the particular solution is formed by multiplying the complementary solution by an unknown function &quot;C&quot;(&quot;x&quot;):
:formula_36
By substituting the particular solution into the non-homogeneous equation, we can find &quot;C&quot;(&quot;x&quot;):
: formula_37

: formula_38

: formula_39

: formula_40
We only need a single particular solution, so we arbitrarily select formula_41 for simplicity. Therefore the particular solution is:
:formula_42
The final solution of the differential equation is:
:formula_43

This recreates the method of integrating factors.

=== Specific second-order equation ===
Let us solve
:formula_44

We want to find the general solution to the differential equation, that is, we want to find solutions to the homogeneous differential equation
: formula_45
The characteristic equation is:
: formula_46

Since formula_47 is a repeated root, we have to introduce a factor of &quot;x&quot; for one solution to ensure linear independence: formula_48 and formula_49. The Wronskian of these two functions is

: formula_50

Because the Wronskian is non-zero, the two functions are linearly independent, so this is in fact the general solution for the homogeneous differential equation (and not a mere subset of it).

We seek functions &quot;A&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) and &quot;B&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) so &quot;A&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)&quot;u&quot;1 + &quot;B&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)&quot;u&quot;2 is a particular solution of the non-homogeneous equation. We need only calculate the integrals

:formula_51

Recall that for this example

:formula_52

That is,

:formula_53
:formula_54

where formula_55 and formula_56 are constants of integration.

=== General second-order equation ===
We have a differential equation of the form

:formula_57

and we define the linear operator

:formula_58

where &quot;D&quot; represents the differential operator. We therefore have to solve the equation formula_59 for formula_60, where formula_61 and formula_62 are known.

We must solve first the corresponding homogeneous equation:

:formula_63

by the technique of our choice. Once we&#x27;ve obtained two linearly independent solutions to this homogeneous differential equation (because this ODE is second-order) — call them &quot;u&quot;1 and &quot;u&quot;2 — we can proceed with variation of parameters.

Now, we seek the general solution to the differential equation formula_64 which we assume to be of the form

:formula_65

Here, formula_66 and formula_67 are unknown and formula_68 and formula_69 are the solutions to the homogeneous equation. (Observe that if formula_66 and formula_67 are constants, then formula_72.) Since the above is only one equation and we have two unknown functions, it is reasonable to impose a second condition. We choose the following:

:formula_73

Now,

:formula_74

Differentiating again (omitting intermediary steps)

:formula_75

Now we can write the action of &quot;L&quot; upon &quot;u&quot;&quot;G&quot; as

:formula_76

Since &quot;u&quot;1 and &quot;u&quot;2 are solutions, then

:formula_77

We have the system of equations

:formula_78

Expanding,

:formula_79

So the above system determines precisely the conditions

:formula_73
:formula_81

We seek &quot;A&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) and &quot;B&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) from these conditions, so, given

:formula_82

we can solve for (&quot;A&quot;′(&quot;x&quot;), &quot;B&quot;′(&quot;x&quot;))T, so

:formula_83

where &quot;W&quot; denotes the Wronskian of &quot;u&quot;1 and &quot;u&quot;2. (We know that &quot;W&quot; is nonzero, from the assumption that &quot;u&quot;1 and &quot;u&quot;2 are linearly independent.) So,

:formula_84

While homogeneous equations are relatively easy to solve, this method allows the calculation of the coefficients of the general solution of the &quot;in&quot;homogeneous equation, and thus the complete general solution of the inhomogeneous equation can be determined.

Note that formula_66 and formula_86 are each determined only up to an arbitrary additive constant (the constant of integration). Adding a constant to formula_66 or formula_67 does not change the value of formula_89 because the extra term is just a linear combination of &quot;u&quot;1 and &quot;u&quot;2, which is a solution of formula_61 by definition.

<text>John &amp; Mary is a United States–based folk rock duo featuring John Lombardo and Mary Ramsey both members of alternative rock band 10,000 Maniacs.

==History==
===1989–1993===
John &amp; Mary was formed by John Lombardo and Mary Ramsey soon after they first met in Buffalo, NY in December 1989. Lombardo, one of the founding members of 10,000 Maniacs and responsible for much of their early sound, had left the band in 1986 due to &quot;creative and political&quot; differences. 
The pair signed with Rykodisc in 1990 and recorded their first album &quot;Victory Gardens&quot; which was released in 1991, and were the opening act for the Maniacs on the Time Capsule Tour in late 1990. They followed up with their second release, &quot;The Weedkiller&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, also on Rykodisc, in 1993.

===1994–2000===
Both joined (or re-joined) the Maniacs as full-time members in 1994 after Natalie Merchant&#x27;s departure. The duo released two albums with the Maniacs, 1997&#x27;s &quot;Love Among the Ruins&quot;, which contained a cover of the Roxy Music song &quot;More Than This&quot; that reached number 25 on the U.S. Hot 100 chart, and 1999&#x27;s &quot;The Earth Pressed Flat&quot;. Lombardo and Ramsey continued to perform occasionally as John &amp; Mary between tours. 
After the death of the Maniacs&#x27; lead guitar player Rob Buck in December 2000, the Maniacs went on hiatus, following which, Ramsey was replaced with singer Oskar Saville from the Chicago-based band Rubygrass. Lombardo quit the group at the same time.

===2001–2006===
After leaving 10,000 Maniacs, John &amp; Mary began work on a new album in 2001. &quot;The Pinwheel Galaxy&quot; was released in December 2002 and the duo began a ten date national tour to promote it. 
The two performed locally around Buffalo regularly from 2002 to 2006. Ramsey was rehired by 10,000 Maniacs as a viola player and backing vocalist for the 2006 shows with Oskar Saville and returned to the lead vocalist spot after the departure of Saville in 2007.

===Since 2007===
In late 2006, John &amp; Mary began working with a new backing band, the Valkyries, made up of some of the best local Buffalo musicians, and their latest album, &quot;Peace Bridge&quot; was released the following year. Lombardo and Ramsey both have continued to appear regularly with 10,000 Maniacs during 2008 to 2017 as well as doing regular shows as John &amp; Mary with the Valkyries.

==Band members==
* John Lombardo – Lombardo, an original member of 10,000 Maniacs, co-wrote most of the early Maniacs songs, but left the band in 1986. He returned in 1994 with Mary Ramsey, and picked up where he left off by writing and shaping the band&#x27;s music for two albums, &quot;Love Among the Ruins&quot; (1997) and &quot;The Earth Pressed Flat&quot; (1999). He left the band again in 2002 and returned as a touring member in 2015.
* Mary Ramsey – Ramsey opened up 10,000 Maniacs shows with John Lombardo as John &amp; Mary in 1990, and played viola and sang backing vocals with the Maniacs on a few songs in 1990 to 1991. She was a touring musician with the band in 1992 to 1993, playing viola and singing backing vocals. When Natalie Merchant left 10,000 Maniacs in 1993, Ramsey replaced her on lead vocals and added the viola as a main instrument of the band, starting with live shows in 1994 and continuing on until 2001. Oskar Saville replaced her as lead singer in 2002, but Ramsey again became a touring musician with the band in 2006, singing backing vocals and playing viola on select songs. She was lead singer for the band again for their final show of 2007 after Oskar Saville left the band and continues in that role.
* The Valkyries – the initial line up in 2006 and on their 2007 release &quot;Peace Bridge&quot; included Patrick Kane on lead guitar, Rob Lynch on drums, Joe Rozler on keyboards, Nelson Starr on keyboards, and Kent Weber on bass guitar.

It was designed and built by New South Wales Department of Railways. It is also known as Waverton Railway Station group. The station was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

==History==
Waverton railway station is located on the North Shore line, between Wollstonecraft and North Sydney railway stations. The North Shore of Sydney can be defined as a relatively narrow strip of land extending from Milsons Point to Waitara, a distance of approximately .

In 1887, tenders were called for construction of a branch line extending south from Hornsby to the North Shore. The 16.8 km section between Hornsby and St Leonards was opened on 1 January 1890. Stations provided at the opening of the line included Chatswood and St Leonards. A single line was constructed at the time. The line between St Leonards and Milsons Point (the terminus at the edge of the harbour) was completed 1 May 1893.

Waverton Railway Station was opened on 1 May 1895. At the time, the station was named Bay Road but on 20 May 1929, Bay Road was renamed Waverton - the name it carries today.

The area was scarcely settled in 1893, but a committee of inquiry found that the route for the line recommended was the best to give a good grade for the railway to the harbourside, hence the route opening up new areas for settlement. The line between St Leonards and Milsons Point (the terminus) was built as double track and both Wollstonecraft and Waverton stations were built to suit the duplicated track from the outset.

At the time of opening, Waverton railway station consisted of two side platforms (for Up and Down North Shore lines), with a small timber station building on each of the platforms. Bay Road tunnel (and Lavender Bay tunnel) were both built during construction of the line between St Leonards and Milsons Point and opened for service as double track tunnels in 1893. After leaving the previous station (Wollstonecraft), the North Shore line passes through a series of curves before passing through the relatively short Bay Road tunnel (&#x27;S&#x27; curve within the tunnel), then a rock cutting before entering Waverton station. The rock cutting is spanned by a bridge carrying a local road (Bay Road). The Booking Office for Waverton Railway Station was built on the overhead bridge with steps leading down to each of the platforms at the time of opening. After Waverton, the line then proceeded to the original Milsons Point station at Lavender Bay.

Electrification of the North Shore line was opened in 1927, with full electric services in 1928. Automatic signalling followed and most signal boxes on the line were closed. The signalling in the vicinity of Waverton was then controlled by North Sydney signal box.

With the opening of the Sydney Harbour Bridge in 1932 and construction of new stations at North Sydney and Milsons Point on a much higher level (to suit the bridge arrangements), the trackwork at Waverton was substantially altered. The original line which was laid down the grade, through the Lavender Bay tunnel to the original Milsons Point station at Lavender Bay became a branch line. The original terminus sidings at Milsons Point was then re-used as off peak storage sidings for the suburban electric cars, and is still in use today. To suit this new arrangement and allow electric car sets to either re-enter service after storage at the sidings, or for car sets to proceed to the sidings, a new dead-end siding was laid in behind the existing Down main platform at Waverton, but at a slightly higher level. Trains from the storage sidings would proceed into the dead-end, reverse and proceed through points toward North Sydney, whereas trains coming out of service would enter the dead-end siding from North Sydney, reverse and proceed down to Lavender Bay. This arrangement is still in use today.

The 1895-built overhead Booking Office was replaced in 1993, with the design of the original structure and original features such as steps being repeated in the new building.

The station received an accessibility upgrade which included lifts on each platform at some point between January 1992 and September 1998. It was one of the first low patronage stations in Sydney to receive an easy access upgrade, along with Pennant Hills.

The station received unusual attention in January 2007, when part of the Platform 2 face was seen to have an apparition of Jesus Christ on it. Church leaders are unconvinced but remaining open-minded about the apparition, which has been explained as a combination of worn away paint and moss. People visited the station to see the apparition, requiring station staff to ensure that no observer is hit by a passing train.

<text>The Violet Town rail accident, also known as the Southern Aurora disaster, was a railway accident that occurred on 7 February 1969 following the incapacitation of the driver of one of the trains, near the McDiarmids Road crossing, approximately 1 km south of Violet Town, Victoria, Australia. The crash resulted in nine deaths and 117 injuries.

== Background ==
The &quot;Southern Aurora&quot; was an overnight express service between the two largest Australian cities, Melbourne and Sydney. The service began in 1962 with the opening of the North East standard gauge line in Victoria, which enabled direct rail traffic between the two capitals for the first time. Owned and operated jointly by the Victorian Railways (VR) and New South Wales Government Railways (NSWGR), the &quot;Southern Aurora&quot; ran in both directions each night with first-class sleeping carriages making up the entire train.

Disputes between VR and NSWGR during the design and construction phase of the passenger carriages had led to several compromises, including the ability to fit bogies of the preferred types of both railways. Due to the insistence of manufacturer Commonwealth Engineering, stainless steel was eventually selected as the primary material, despite the initial reluctance of the railways, who wished to use their own existing carriage designs. Among the vaunted benefits of stainless steel construction was its superior crashworthiness, a benefit that was maximised by late design changes made to improve the energy-absorbing capacity of the draw gear between carriages.

Freight services had also begun on the standard gauge line in 1962, with the commissioning of facilities at Melbourne&#x27;s South Dynon. Passenger services like the &quot;Aurora&quot; shared the primarily single-track main line with freight traffic in both directions; it was usual practice for freight trains to be held at passing loops (short sections of double track) in order to minimise delays to passenger timetables. One such crossing loop was located at Violet Town, around in rail distance to the north-east of Melbourne. The loop had a length of , and, like the rest of the standard gauge line between Melbourne and Albury, signals and points were operated by centralised traffic control from Melbourne.

On the night of the accident, 7 February 1969, the &quot;Southern Aurora&quot; from Sydney departed with fourteen carriages, carrying a near-capacity load of 192 passengers and 22 crew by the time it reached Violet Town. Its driver was Jack Bowden, a highly experienced 52-year-old VR employee; its fireman was 30-year-old Mervyn Coulthard; and its guard William Wyer. A fast freight train of 22 wagons, mostly containing new cars, had departed Melbourne at 1:25 a.m. travelling north, driven by Lawrence Rosevear and supported by relief driver Arnfried Brendecke. The train controller on duty at Train Control in Melbourne was Frank McDonnell.

== Accident ==
The southbound &quot;Southern Aurora&quot; and northbound freight train were timetabled to cross at Benalla, north of Violet Town, at 6.44 a.m. The freight train was scheduled to enter the Benalla crossing loop at 6.15 a.m. However, at 6.30 a.m., McDonnell observed that both the &quot;Southern Aurora&quot; and the goods train were running behind schedule, and so he decided to have the trains pass each other at Violet Town instead. The driver of the goods train was instructed to prepare for a &quot;running cross&quot;, under which the freight train would be diverted into the loop line at slow speed, while the &quot;Southern Aurora&quot; continued on the main line.

As the &quot;Southern Aurora&quot; passed through Benalla, driver Bowden increased its speed to the limit of , which was maintained up to the point of impact. Shortly afterwards, his train passed an automatic signal showing &quot;normal speed warning&quot;. That signified that the next signal might have a &quot;stop&quot; indication. Although it was standard practice to slow a train by at least after receiving such a warning, Bowden did not respond in any way. It was later established that he had died about before the crash, and had probably not been in effective control of the train for some time before that.

After noticing the warning indication on the signal, and anticipating a lengthy stop at Violet Town, fireman Coulthard said he had left his seat and gone into the nose of the locomotive to fill the electric kettle with water. While performing that task, he heard and felt the train pass over the points at the start of the crossing loop. He noted that the &quot;Southern Aurora&quot; had not reduced speed. Upon re-entering the main driving cab, he saw the &quot;stop&quot; signal ahead and the headlights of the freight train. He shouted at Bowden to stop the train, and ran into the engine room behind the cab to take shelter.

The freight train had approached Violet Town at , and driver Rosevear saw the headlight of the approaching &quot;Southern Aurora&quot;. He slowed his train to to safely enter the crossing loop, but realised the oncoming passenger train was not going to stop to allow him to do so. He applied the emergency brake and flashed the headlight of his locomotive in an attempt to warn the driver of the &quot;Southern Aurora&quot;. He then opened the cab door and helped fireman Brendecke to jump out, before seeking refuge in the engine room of his locomotive.

Shortly before 7 a.m., the trains collided head-on at a closing speed later estimated at . According to Brendecke (who survived his fall from the cab and the subsequent crash), as well as motorists on the adjacent Hume Highway, the force of the collision propelled the locomotive of the &quot;Southern Aurora&quot;, and several of the goods wagons, into the air. Six of the passenger carriages were derailed, and one was completely crushed by other wreckage. The two leading carriages telescoped into the rear of the locomotive, and two others rode over the top of the wreckage, suspending them some in the air.

Immediately following the crash, spilt diesel fuel caused the locomotive of the goods train to catch fire. The flames quickly spread to the derailed &quot;Southern Aurora&quot; carriages, where passengers were already attempting to escape through broken windows.

== Aftermath ==
Local Country Fire Authority volunteers in Violet Town witnessed the crash, and immediately began organising the firefighting response. Initially, the Euroa Urban Fire Brigade, the nearest major fire service, was told of a collision between two trucks, and later of a truck hit by a train; firefighters were not aware that a major rail accident had occurred until they arrived on scene to find the burning wreckage. Over 100 firefighters eventually arrived from neighbouring districts to assist with the firefighting, rescue and recovery effort.

Train controller McConnell observed the crash on his control panel and immediately reported the circumstances to his supervisor, and a recovery effort was shortly underway in Melbourne. Aircraft from the Department of Civil Aviation, the Royal Australian Air Force and Trans Australia Airlines were used to transport rescuers, railway officials and investigators to the crash site.

== Memorial ==
A stone cairn was erected on the 25th anniversary of the tragedy by the Public Transport Corporation at the site of the accident. Hundreds attended the commemoration in the early morning, which was followed by a morning tea.

In early 2018, a local group announced plans to expand the memorial significantly, saying that the existing cairn naming only a &quot;public transport official&quot; was an inadequate tribute to the disaster. The plans include signage listing the names of both the dead and local rescuers who were awarded for their bravery, and organisers anticipated their completion prior to the 50th anniversary of the crash in 2019.

<text>Vale Cemetery is a historic rural cemetery and the largest cemetery in Schenectady, New York. It opened on 21 October 1857, when the Rev. Julius Seely dedicated what was then termed &quot;the Vale&quot;. It has tripled its size since opening and today it holds the remains of some of the most notable persons in Upstate New York. In 1973, a 35-acre tract of unused and abandoned cemetery land around the ponds of Cowhorn Creek was sold to the city of Schenectady to form Vale Park.

The cemetery and park were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004.

==History==
By 1850 the old public burying ground on Green and Front streets was being overrun with weeds and was described as being unsanitary. The Common Council resolved on 2 July 1856 to develop the grounds of the old Hospital Farm on Nott Terrace as a public cemetery. On 16 June 1857, Mayor Benjamin V. S. Vedder appointed a committee to oversee the work.

To provide access from a main street, Dr Eliphalet Nott, the President of Union College donated an avenue from Nott Terrace into the grounds. Later in 1863, two pieces of land were purchased from the college, creating what is now known as Vale Park. The entrance on State Street was a donation from the First Reformed Church in 1867. The cemetery was planned by Burton Thomas as a rural cemetery. It featured many winding paths and he had more than 1,000 trees planted; Cowhorn Creek was dammed to create a lake within the grounds. The cemetery has since expanded and covers approximately and holds some 33,000 burials. The cemetery includes the historic African-American Burying Ground. Since 2001, city residents have held annual commemorations of Juneteenth, celebrating emancipation and the end of the American Civil War; particularly since 2006, some have been held at the Burying Ground.

==Vale Cemetery Association==
In February 1858, the Common Council declared that it could not continue to run the cemetery at the taxpayers&#x27; expense and that the cemetery must be taken up by private owners. Fourteen of the lot holders formed the Vale Cemetery Association and bought the from the Common Council. They paid the sum of $800, and announced that some land, known as the Potters&#x27; Field, would be set aside for the burial of the poor. In 2007 as part of the Schenectady Colonial celebrations, the Association held a dinner to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the cemetery.

==Vale mapping project==
In late 2006, interest in mapping the cemetery was indicated by several people connected with the cemetery. They developed the Vale mapping project. The project started in spring 2007, using GPS and techniques used in England and Scotland to locate each grave. The group intends to map all the graves and document them, to establish a full record before there is further damage or deterioration of many of the historic memorials.

* The oldest grave marker is that of Jan Maybee, of Mabee House, who died in 1725.

==Sections==
The cemetery is divided into several sections, each having its own historic importance:
* Veterans Section – veterans from the Civil War and Spanish–American War are buried here, as well as later ones.
* First Reformed Church – The graves in this section predate the formation of Vale Cemetery. They were moved in 1879 from various small First Reformed Church cemeteries scattered throughout the Stockade. The oldest marker is that of Jan Mabee, survivor of the Schenectady Massacre, who died in 1725.
* African Section (now called the African-American Burying Ground) – the original African Cemetery was located on Hamilton Hill. Judge Alonzo C. Paige purchased that area for real estate development. He purchased space in Vale and had the remains re-interred at his expense. His action protected the graves, as people had disturbed the graves on the hill by removing sandy soil for cement making.

<doc id="1036324" wikidata="Q446879" url="?curid=1036324" title="Anna Louisa Geertruida Bosboom-Toussaint">
<text>Anna Louisa Geertruida Bosboom-Toussaint (September 16, 1812April 14, 1886) was a Dutch novelist.

==Life and career==
Geertruida Toussaint was born in Alkmaar, Netherlands, on 16 September 1812. Her father, a pharmacist of Huguenot descent, gave her a fair education, and at an early period of her career she developed a taste for historical research, fostered by a forced indoor life as a result of weak health.

Her first romance, &quot;Almagro&quot;, appeared in 1837, followed by &quot;De graaf van Devonshire&quot; (&quot;The Earl of Devonshire&quot;) in 1838; &quot;De Engelschen te Rome&quot; (&quot;The English at Rome&quot;) in 1840, and &quot;Het Huis Lauernesse&quot; (&quot;The House of Lauernesse&quot;) in 1841, an episode of the Reformation that was translated into many European languages. These stories, mainly founded upon some of the most interesting epochs of Dutch history, betrayed a remarkable grasp of facts and situations, combined with an undoubted mastery over her mother tongue, although her style is sometimes involved and not always faultless.

Toussaint spent 1840 to 1850 carrying out further studies, resulting in an 1851-1854 series of three novels dealing with the first Earl of Leicester&#x27;s adventures in the Low Countries: &quot;Leycester in Nederland&quot; (3 vols.), &quot;Vrouwen van het Leycestersche Tydperk&quot; (Women of Leicester&#x27;s Epoch, 3 vols.), and &quot;Gideon Florensz&quot; (3 vols.). In 1851 she married the Dutch painter, Johannes Bosboom (1817–1891), after which she was known as Mrs Bosboom-Toussaint.

After 1870 Geertruida Bosboom-Toussaint abandoned historical romance for the modern society novel, but her &quot;Delftsche Wonderdokter&quot; (&quot;The Necromancer of Delft&quot;, 1871) and &quot;Majoor Frans&quot; (&quot;Major Frank&quot;, 1875) did not achieve the success of her earlier works. &quot;Majoor Frans&quot; was translated into English (1885). Her novels were published in a collected edition (1885–1888, 25 vols.). She died in The Hague on 14 April 1886.

<text>Gerard Hugh &quot;Leo&quot; Sayer (born 21 May 1948) is an English-Australian singer and songwriter who has been active since the early 1970s. He has been an Australian citizen and resident since 2009.

Sayer launched his career in the United Kingdom in the early 1970s and became a top singles and album act on both sides of the Atlantic in that decade. His first seven UK hit singles reached the Top 10 – a feat first accomplished by his first manager, Adam Faith. His songs have been sung by other notable artists, including Cliff Richard, Roger Daltrey and Three Dog Night.

In 1978, his song &quot;You Make Me Feel Like Dancing&quot; became a Grammy Award winner as that year&#x27;s best Rhythm and Blues Song.

==Early life==
Sayer was born and brought up in Shoreham-by-Sea in Sussex to Thomas E. G. Sayer and the former Theresa Nolan as the second of three sons (Michael was born in 1939 and Brian in 1951). His father was English and his mother was born in Maguiresbridge, County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland. He spent holidays on her father&#x27;s small farm at Edenmore, a townland near the hamlet of Killesher, also in County Fermanagh.

Sayer attended St Peter&#x27;s Catholic Primary School in Shoreham-by-Sea and then Blessed Robert Southwell (now St Oscar Romero Catholic School) in Goring-by-Sea, before studying commercial art and graphic design at West Sussex College of Art and Design in Worthing, Sussex.

Sayer was initially discovered by musician David Courtney, who then co-managed and co-produced him with former pop singer Adam Faith. In January 1967, while 18-year-old Sayer was working as a hall porter at the King&#x27;s Hotel in Hove, he assisted in the rescue of elderly guests from a serious fire that damaged the hotel&#x27;s first floor. He himself was rescued from the blazing hotel by builders working on a block of flats beside the hotel.

==Career==
===Beginnings; 1970s===
Sayer began his music career co-writing songs with David Courtney, including &quot;Giving It All Away&quot;, which gave Roger Daltrey of the Who his first solo hit in 1973. All but two of the songs on the album &quot;Daltrey&quot; were co-written by Sayer and Courtney. The same year, Sayer began his career as a recording artist under the management of Adam Faith, who signed Sayer to the Chrysalis label in the United Kingdom and Warner Bros. Records in the United States.

His debut single, &quot;Why Is Everybody Going Home&quot;, failed to chart, but he achieved national prominence in the UK with his second single, the music hall-styled song &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot;, which Sayer performed on British television wearing a pierrot costume and makeup. The single went to No. 2 on the UK singles chart, as was matched by his debut album, &quot;Silverbird&quot;, on the UK albums chart co-written with David Courtney, who also co-produced the album with Adam Faith. Three Dog Night&#x27;s cover of &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot; was the group&#x27;s last &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 top 10 record, reached No. 4 on 25 May 1974.

His subsequent singles were all major hits in the UK&quot;One Man Band&quot; went to No. 6 in 1974, &quot;Long Tall Glasses&quot; (UK No. 4, 1974) became his first Top Ten hit in the US, reaching No. 9, and &quot;Moonlighting&quot; went to No. 2 in the UK in 1975. In 1976, Sayer recorded three Beatles songs, &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot;, &quot;Let It Be&quot; and &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot;, for the Beatles-themed concept film &quot;All This and World War II&quot;. His albums in this period were also consistently successful in the UK: he scored five consecutive Top 10 placings on the UK albums chart between 1973 and 1977.

He also garnered success as an album artist in the US, beginning with his second LP &quot;Just a Boy&quot; (1974), which reached No. 16. His fourth album, &quot;Endless Flight&quot; (1976), consolidated his international popularity, reaching No. 4 in the UK and No. 10 in the US; it also charted strongly in other countries including Sweden, Norway, the Netherlands, and New Zealand, and was certified as a platinum album in both the UK and the US, and double-platinum in Canada.

===Career peak; late 1970s–1980s===
The peak of his career came in 1977, when he achieved two consecutive number one hits in the US, first with the disco-styled &quot;You Make Me Feel Like Dancing&quot; (a Grammy Award winner for the year&#x27;s best Rhythm and Blues Song), followed by a romantic ballad, &quot;When I Need You&quot; (1977), which reached number one in both the UK and US. Written by Albert Hammond and Carole Bayer Sager, it was Sayer&#x27;s first No. 1 single in the UK (after three number two hits). It was also the first of two chart-toppers in a row in the UK for producer Richard Perry. Also from &quot;Endless Flight&quot;, Sayer covered the Danny O&#x27;Keefe song &quot;Magdalena&quot;, which served as the B-side to the &quot;You Make Me Feel Like Dancing&quot; single.

In 1979, the compilation album &quot;The Very Best of Leo Sayer&quot; (originally released by Chrysalis in the UK and elsewhere, with its first release in the US in 2000 by Rhino Records with different cover art) became Sayer&#x27;s first UK No. 1 album and his seventh consecutive UK Top 20 album. Sayer also guest-starred in the second episode of the third season of &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, and performed &quot;You Make Me Feel Like Dancing&quot;, &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot;, and &quot;When I Need You&quot;.

Sayer also made cover versions of Bobby Vee&#x27;s Sonny Curtis-Jerry Allison composition &quot;More Than I Can Say&quot; (his fourth UK No. 2 hit and US No. 2), and Buddy Holly&#x27;s &quot;Raining in My Heart&quot; (1979) and Bee Gees&#x27; &quot;Heart (Stop Beating in Time)&quot; in 1982. In the US, three of his singles&quot;You Make Me Feel Like Dancing&quot; (1977), &quot;When I Need You&quot; (1977) and &quot;More Than I Can Say&quot; (1980)were certified gold.

===&quot;The Missing Link&quot; (1980–1990)===
Sayer provided songs for the soundtrack of the French–Belgian animated film &quot;The Missing Link&quot; (&quot;Le Chainon manquant&quot;) in 1980. In 1981, he voiced Dan the forest ranger in &quot;The Raccoons on Ice&quot;, the second of four specials serving as a predecessor to the Canadian animated series &quot;The Raccoons&quot;. He also sang several songs for the special, all of which were included on the 1983 album &quot;Lake Freeze&quot; and the 1984 album &quot;The Raccoons: Let&#x27;s Dance!&quot;

In 1990, he contributed to the last studio collaboration between Alan Parsons and Eric Woolfson, Woolfson&#x27;s solo album &quot;Freudiana&quot;, performing &quot;I Am A Mirror&quot;. Sayer performed at the Sanremo Music Festival in 1990, with &quot;The Moth And The Flame&quot; (English version of &quot;Tu... sì&quot; by Mango) and, in 1991, with &quot;All Alone&quot; (English version of &quot;Dubbi No&quot; by Mietta).

===Financial difficulties (1990–2006)===
After a decade of success, Sayer&#x27;s career suffered repeated setbacks due to a series of financial and legal problems. When Sayer and his first wife Janice divorced in 1985, subsequent financial disclosure revealed that Adam Faith had mishandled Sayer&#x27;s business affairs. Much of the income Sayer had earned over the previous decade had been lost through Faith&#x27;s questionable investments and business expenses.

Sayer sued Faith for mismanagement and the case was eventually settled out of court in 1992, with Sayer receiving a reported payout of £650,000. In the early 1990s, his career stalled again while he fought a protracted but ultimately successful legal battle against his former label, Chrysalis, to regain the publishing rights to his songs.

In 1996, Sayer sued his new management, after he discovered that his pension fund had allegedly been mismanaged to around £1 million. Despite spending more than £90,000 in legal fees the case never made it to court and Sayer abandoned the suit for reasons of cost. He assembled a band led by former Van Morrison guitarist Ronnie Johnson and toured his way back to financial security. They recorded a live album, &quot;Live in London&quot;, which was released in 1999.

===Later career (2006–2015)===
On 12 February 2006, Sayer made a return to number one in the UK singles chart, with DJ Meck&#x27;s remix of &quot;Thunder In My Heart&quot;. It was his first appearance in the Top 10 in the UK for almost 24 years, and his second chart-topper in the UK, almost three decades after his first. &quot;Leo Sayer: At His Very Best&quot;, a career spanning compilation album, was released in the UK on 6 March 2006. It featured the Meck single, alongside &quot;When I Need You&quot; and &quot;You Make Me Feel Like Dancing&quot;.

In June 2008, Sayer released a new album only in Australia, &quot;Don&#x27;t Wait Until Tomorrow&quot;. This album, produced by Garth Porter (from the Australian pop band Sherbet) and released by Universal Music Australia, features selections from his catalog rearranged with strings and acoustic and jazz instrumentation.

In January 2009, Sayer became an Australian citizen, having lived in Sydney since 2005.

Sayer has appeared in various television shows in addition to &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, including the 1998 Vic and Bob game show &quot;Families at War&quot; (on which he performed &quot;When I Need You&quot; while given a piggyback by a contestant running on a treadmill); The Wiggles 2008 DVD, &quot;You Make Me Feel Like Dancing&quot;, which featured Sayer&#x27;s hit of the same name; &quot;Celebrity Big Brother UK&quot; in 2007; and the Australian television comedy, &quot;Stupid, Stupid Man&quot;.

===&quot;Restless Years&quot; and &quot;Selfie&quot; (2015–present)===
In January 2015, Sayer released his album, &quot;Restless Years&quot;, and toured Australia and Singapore, with various support acts including Jason Ayres. Also in January 2015, he featured in Singapore&#x27;s &quot;Leo Sayer in Concert – 40 Years at the Top&quot;, presented by the British Theatre Playhouse. In October 2015, he was awarded with a Gold Badge of Merit from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors.

On 3 May 2019, Sayer released his latest album, &quot;Selfie&quot; on Demon Records. It was recorded at his home studio at The Barn in Plainland, Queensland, Australia.

On 29 November 2024, Sayer released his album, &quot;1992&quot;, also on Demon Records. It contained a selection of his songs recorded in that year but until now unreleased.

==Personal life==
Sayer and his wife Janice married in 1973 and divorced in 1985. He then had a relationship with Donatella Piccinetti, with whom he moved to Australia; they separated briefly in 2007, but were reunited and ultimately married on 15 April 2023. Sayer resides in the Southern Highlands of New South Wales.

In January 2009, Sayer became an Australian citizen at the Australia Day citizenship ceremony in Canberra. In 2020, he became an ambassador for the Canberra Hospital Foundation.

===Health problems===
He still suffers from the effects of injuries to his legs and ankles that were caused by a fall off a stage in 1977.
Sayer&#x27;s family has a history of cancer; both his parents died of cancer as did other family members on both sides. On his 65th birthday, after experiencing intestinal problems, Sayer was given a colonoscopy which revealed he had intestinal ulcers and a tumour. He underwent surgery which successfully treated both problems and showed that the tumour was benign.

<text>Victor Benjamin Neuburg (6 May 1883 – 31 May 1940) was an English poet and writer. An intimate associate of Aleister Crowley, he wrote on the subject of occultism, including Theosophy and Thelema. He edited &quot;The Poet&#x27;s Corner&quot; column in the &quot;Sunday Referee&quot;, and also published the early works of Dylan Thomas and Pamela Hansford Johnson.

==Early life==
Neuburg was born into and raised in an upper middle-class Jewish family in Islington. His father, Carl Neuburg, who had been born in 1857 in Plzeň, Bohemia, and was a commission agent based in Vienna, abandoned the family shortly after his son&#x27;s birth. Victor was brought up by his mother, Jeanette Neuburg, &quot;née&quot; Jacobs (1855–1939), and his maternal aunts. He was educated at the City of London School and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied medieval and modern languages.

==Relationship with Aleister Crowley==
When he was 25, in around 1906, Neuburg came in contact with Crowley, also a poet, who had read some of Neuburg&#x27;s pieces in the &quot;Agnostic Journal&quot;. Crowley&#x27;s description of him was:

Crowley initiated Neuburg into his magical Order, the A∴A∴, in which he took the magical name &quot;Frater Omnia Vincam&quot;. Crowley also began an extended sentimental and sexual relationship with Neuburg. In 1909 Crowley took Neuburg to Algiers, and they set off into the desert, where they performed a series of occult rituals based on the Enochian system of Doctor John Dee, later chronicled in &quot;The Vision and the Voice&quot;. In the midst of these rituals Crowley put the ideas of sex and magick together, and performed his first sex magick ritual. Neuburg&#x27;s anthology of poems &quot;The Triumph of Pan&quot; (1910) dates from shortly after these events and shows the distinct influence of Crowley:

Crowley was highly impressed by Neuburg&#x27;s poetic ability:

Back in London, Neuburg showed potential as a dancer, so Crowley gave him a leading role in his proto-performance art pieces &quot;Rites of Eleusis&quot;. Neuburg also pursued a doomed relationship with the actress Ione de Forest, who committed suicide shortly after their break-up.

In 1913 Crowley and Neuburg again joined forces in a sexual ritual magic operation known as &quot;the Paris Working&quot;. According to one of Crowley&#x27;s biographers, Lawrence Sutin, Crowley subsequently used anti-Semitic epithets to bully Neuburg, and compared Neuburg to a dromedary. This spurred Neuburg to break with Crowley some time in 1914, describing the slurs as &quot;ostrobogulous piffle&quot;, inventing the word &#x27;ostrobogulous&#x27; for the occasion.

==The Vine Press==
From 1916 Neuburg served in the British Army. After the end of the First World War he moved to Steyning in Sussex, where he ran a small press, the Vine Press. In 1920 he published a collection of ballads and other verse under the title &quot;Lillygay&quot;. Many of these were adapted from earlier ballad collections. In 1923 Peter Warlock set five of these verses to music under the same title.

==&quot;The Poet&#x27;s Corner&quot; and Dylan Thomas==
From 1933 onwards Neuburg edited a section called &quot;The Poet&#x27;s Corner&quot; in a British newspaper, the &quot;Sunday Referee&quot;. Here he encouraged new talent by awarding weekly prizes of half a guinea for the best poem. One first prize was awarded to the then-unknown Dylan Thomas, and the publisher of the &quot;Sunday Referee&quot; sponsored Neuburg&#x27;s publication of Thomas&#x27;s first book, &quot;18 Poems&quot;.

Another poet who contributed to the column was Pamela Hansford Johnson, and for many months, Johnson and Thomas seemed to alternate as winners of first prize. In 1937, Jean Overton Fuller submitted a poem to &quot;The Poets&#x27; Corner&quot; and was drawn into Neuburg&#x27;s circle, eventually becoming his biographer.

==Personal life==
Neuburg married Kathleen Rose Goddard in 1921, but the marriage eventually broke up. They had a son, Victor Edward Neuburg (1924–1996), who became a writer on English literature.

Neuburg later started a relationship with Runia Tharpe, and moved to Swiss Cottage, London, to live with her.

==Death==
Victor Benjamin Neuburg died from tuberculosis on 30 May 1940. Dylan Thomas declared on hearing of Neuburg&#x27;s death:

<text>Zhan Ziqian (; c. mid to late 6th century) was a famous painter of ancient China from Yangxin County in modern-day Shandong province. His birth and death dates are unknown. It is known that in the Sui dynasty (581–618) he was appointed to the office of Chaosan Dafu () and later of Zhangnei Dudu ().

According to the historical documents, Zhan Ziqian painted a number of genres and religion paintings which have not survived. He was especially noted for his paintings of pavilions and people, and horses. His paintings of people were particularly lifelike. The only painting by him that survives today is &quot;Strolling About in Spring&quot;, which is a perspective arrangement of mountains. It has been cited as the earliest surviving work of Chinese landscape painting or the first &quot;shan shui&quot; painting.

<doc id="1036331" wikidata="Q7241582" url="?curid=1036331" title="Presqu'ile Provincial Park">
<text>Presqu&#x27;ile Provincial Park is a park in southeastern Northumberland County on the north shore of Lake Ontario near the town of Brighton in Ontario, Canada. The park occupies an area of . The name of the park is the French word for peninsula, or literally &quot;almost island&quot;, and was believed to be named by Samuel De Champlain on his second expedition. The peninsula was formed when a limestone island was connected to the mainland by a sand spit; this kind of formation is referred to as a tombolo.

==Nature and ecology==
The park&#x27;s wetlands are one of the larger wetlands along the north shore of Lake Ontario, and are noteworthy for the many sand ridges running through them, which increases habitat diversity. The mixture of sand dunes, marshes and forests leads to very high plant diversity.

In some ways, the flora of this site is therefore similar to the much larger sand spit at Long Point. The long sand spits in Presqu&#x27;ile also create natural vegetation gradients from sand dunes and pannes to coniferous and deciduous forest. Sand dunes and pannes are uncommon along the north shore of lake Ontario. Pannes are an unusual moist sand habitat, calcareous and seasonally flooded, similar to a wet prairie or wet meadow. This creates situations with high plant diversity. The pannes support many unusual plants, such as &quot;Carex aurea&quot;, &quot;Cladium mariscoides&quot;, &quot;Scleria verticillata&quot;, &quot;Parnassia glauca&quot; and &quot;Physostegia virginiana&quot;. The colourful pink flowers of the &quot;Physostegia&quot; are a good indicators of panne habitat during the summer. Because of their scarcity and scientific importance, these wetlands have been used to develop and test general models for factors affecting diversity in plant communities. In drier conditions, these pannes grade into more typical sand dune vegetation. In wetter conditions, they grade into rich marshes and sedge meadows, which intergrade with forested sand ridges in the &quot;Fingers&quot;. This rare and distinctive vegetation type is not mentioned in the park&#x27;s resource management plan., and has been damaged in the past by factors such as road construction, mowing and planting of exotic tree species.

The dunes and wetlands arise out of natural processes, such as the natural high and lower water periods in the Great Lakes. Both the area of wetlands, and the number of plant species in them, depends upon a combination of high water and low water years over decades.

The park&#x27;s location on Lake Ontario makes it a perfect stop over for migrating birds along the Michigan Flyway. For this reason is it also an important location for viewing migrating birds and monarch butterflies. The park&#x27;s long beaches make it particularly appealing to migrating shorebirds. Limestone islands near the park area support large nesting colonies of double-crested cormorants, Caspian and common terns, several gull species, great blue herons, great egrets, and black-crowned night-herons. In early spring, Presqu&#x27;ile Bay is an important staging area for thousands of migrating waterfowl. The park also includes a large marsh which provides nesting habitat for rails, bitterns and other wetland birds. There are also forested areas and open fields: a wide variety of habitats in a relatively small park. There is also a fairly substantial population of white-tailed deer, whose grazing is doing significant damage to native plants in general, and to tree regeneration in particular. Presqu&#x27;ile has been identified as a Canadian Important Bird Area. In all this small park has seven distinct ecosystems.

==History==

The park area had been selected in 1797 as the site of a town called Newcastle which was to become the county seat. However, on October 8, 1804, the schooner HMS Speedy, which was bringing officials to a trial at the new courthouse, sank offshore with all on board lost. The ship was never found, nor the bodies of the passengers and crew. The county seat was moved to nearby Amherst (now Cobourg, Ontario). In 1840, a lighthouse was completed at Presqu&#x27;ile Point. The designer of the 69-foot, octagonal structure was Nicol Hugh Baird. Baird also designed the Murray Canal, parts of the Trent-Severn Waterway and the Rideau Canal. Today, this lighthouse stands as the second oldest operating lighthouse on the north shore of Lake Ontario.

In 1922, a private commission was given authority to develop a park at Presqu&#x27;ile. In the 20th century, Presqu&#x27;ile became popular for recreation, with two kilometres of sandy beaches, a summer hotel and dance pavilion, an annual regatta race, a nine-hole golf course and opportunities for boating. As the decades passed, the type of recreation enjoyed at the park changed which caused the dismantling of the golf course and the closure of the hotel and dance pavilion. Presqu&#x27;ile was incorporated into the Ontario Parks system in 1954 and has become a popular destination for campers, naturalists, and other users.

==Facilities and activities==
Presqu&#x27;ile has 397 campsites, day use area, beach, store and two visitor centres. The park is aimed at family recreation, and offers a Natural Heritage Education program. The park often holds special events such as the Waterfowl Weekend in March, History Weekend in August, Parks Day, and Canada Day celebrations. Recreational activities popular at Presqu&#x27;ile include cycling, swimming, paddling, fishing, hiking, wildlife viewing, and hunting.

<doc id="1036351" wikidata="Q4427525" url="?curid=1036351" title="Bible citation">
<text>A citation from the Bible is usually referenced with the book name, chapter number and verse number. Sometimes, the name of the Bible translation is also included. There are several formats for doing so.

==Common formats==
A common format for biblical citations is &quot;Book chapter:verses&quot;, using a colon to delimit chapter from verse, as in:
: &quot;In the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth&quot; (&quot;Gen. 1:1&quot;).

Or, stated more formally,

:&quot;Book chapter&quot; for a chapter (&quot;John 3&quot;);
:&quot;Book chapter1–chapter2&quot; for a range of chapters (&quot;John 1–3&quot;);
:&quot;book chapter:verse&quot; for a single verse (&quot;John 3:16&quot;);
:&quot;book chapter:verse1–verse2&quot; for a range of verses (&quot;John 3:16–17&quot;);
:&quot;book chapter:verse1,verse2&quot; for multiple disjoint verses (&quot;John 6:14, 44&quot;).

The range delimiter is an en-dash, and there are no spaces on either side of it.

This format is the one accepted by the Chicago Manual of Style to cite scriptural standard works. The MLA style is similar, but replaces the colon with a period.

Citations in the APA style add the translation of the Bible after the verse. For example, (&quot;John 3:16, New International Version&quot;). Translation names should not be abbreviated (e.g., write out King James Version instead of using KJV). Subsequent citations do not require the translation unless that changes. In APA 7th edition, the Bible is listed in the references at the end of the document, which has changed since previous versions.
Citations in Turabian style requires that when referring to books or chapters, do not italicize or underline them. The book names must also be spelled out. For example, (The beginning of Genesis recounts the creation of our universe.) When referring directly to a particular passage, the abbreviated book name, chapter number, a colon, and verse number must be provided. Additionally, the Bible is not listed in the references at the end of the document and the edition of the Bible is required when citing inside parentheses. For example, (Eph. 2:10 [New International Version]).

==Punctuation==
When citations are used in run-in quotations, they should not, according to &quot;The Christian Writer&#x27;s Manual of Style&quot;, contain the punctuation either from the quotation itself (such as a terminating exclamation mark or question mark) or from the surrounding prose. The full-stop at the end of the surrounding sentence belongs outside of the parentheses that surround the citation. For example:
: Take him away! Take him away! Crucify him! (&quot;John 19:15&quot;).

&quot;The Christian Writer&#x27;s Manual of Style&quot; also states that a citation that follows a block quotation of text may either be in parentheses flush against the text, or right-aligned following an em-dash on a new line. For example:
: These things I have spoken to you, so that in Me you may have peace. In the world you have tribulation, but take courage; I have overcome the world. (&quot;John 16:33 NASB&quot;)
: These things I have spoken to you, so that in Me you may have peace. In the world you have tribulation, but take courage; I have overcome the world. — &quot;John 16:33 NASB&quot;

==Abbreviating book names==
The names of the books of the Bible can be abbreviated. Most Bibles give preferred abbreviation guides in their tables of contents, or at the front of the book. Abbreviations may be used when the citation is a reference that follows a block quotation of text.

Abbreviations should not be used, according to &quot;The Christian Writer&#x27;s Manual of Style&quot;, when the citation is in running text. Instead, the full name should be spelled out. Hudson observes, however, that for scholarly or reference works that contain a large number of citations in running text, abbreviations may be used simply to reduce the length of the prose, and that a similar exception can be made for cases where a large number of citations are used in parentheses.

There are two commonly accepted styles for abbreviating the book names, one used in general books and one used in scholarly works.

Electronic editions of Bibles use internal abbreviations. Some of these abbreviation schemes are standardized. These include OSIS and ParaTExt USFM.

==Roman numerals==
Roman numerals are often used for the numbered books of the Bible. For example, Paul&#x27;s First Epistle to the Corinthians may be written as &quot;I Corinthians&quot;, using the Roman numeral &quot;I&quot; rather than the Arabic numeral &quot;1&quot;. &quot;The Christian Writer&#x27;s Manual of Style&quot;, however, recommends using Arabic numerals for numbered books, as in &quot;2 Corinthians&quot; rather than &quot;II Corinthians&quot;.

==Editions==
The &quot;Student Supplement to the SBL Handbook of Style&quot; published by the Society of Biblical Literature states that for modern editions of the Bible, publishers information is not required in a citation. One should simply use the standard abbreviation of the version of the Bible (e.g. &quot;KJV&quot; for King James Version, &quot;RSV&quot; for Revised Standard Version, &quot;NIV&quot; for New International Version, and so forth).

==Multiple citations==
The &quot;Student Supplement to the SBL Handbook of Style&quot; recommends that multiple citations be given in the form of a list separated by a semicolon, without a conjunction before the final item in the list. When multiple consecutive citations reference the same book, the name of the book is omitted from the second and subsequent citations. For example:
:&quot;John 1–3; 3:16; 6:14, 44&quot;

==Citing non-biblical text in Bibles==
Some Bibles, particularly study bibles, contain additional text that is not the biblical text. This includes footnotes, annotations, and special articles. The &quot;Student Supplement to the SBL Handbook of Style&quot; recommends that such text be cited in the form of a normal book citation, not as a Bible citation.

<doc id="1036364" wikidata="Q5136159" url="?curid=1036364" title="Club Buggery">
<text>Club Buggery is an Australian television series made in the 1990s. It was created and performed by Australian comedy duo Roy and HG (John Doyle and Greig Pickhaver) and broadcast on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) network in 1996 and 1997.

==Development==
The series was an offshoot of the duo&#x27;s long-running, groundbreaking improvised radio comedy series &quot;This Sporting Life&quot; (TSL), which premiered on the Triple J radio network in 1986 and ran until 2008. Doyle and Pickhaver first essayed a television adaptation of TSL in 1993, but that series was only partially successful and suffered from the limitations imposed by its predominantly &#x27;talking head&#x27; style.

Its successor &quot;Club Buggery&quot;, broke these limitations by creating an innovative blend of format elements including variety, talk and sketch comedy. It referenced many Australian club and television entertainment genres including the RSL club circuit, and vintage television programs in the sport, variety, quiz, talk and music genres. The intertextual and subversive nature of the humour was evidenced by the title.

The program ran for two series of 28 episodes each under the title &quot;Club Buggery&quot; and it then was retitled as &quot;The Channel Nine Show&quot; (retaining the same basic format) for a further series of ten episodes in 1998. The title was a reference to both a vintage television series (it was the Sydney title of the famous Melbourne-based variety series &quot;In Melbourne Tonight&quot;, presented by Graham Kennedy), as well as referring ironically to contemporary rumours that the duo were leaving the ABC to go to the Kerry Packer-owned Nine Network.

Later in 1998 they presented the similarly-formatted &quot;Planet Norwich&quot;, which was recorded in the UK and presumably intended for the British market. Some time later they also presented segments as part of a comedy series hosted by British comedian Ben Elton.

==Title==
In most English speaking countries, the word &quot;buggery&quot; has two quite specific and extremely negative meanings – one refers to the act of anal intercourse, and the other to the charge in law that proscribes that act. But in Australian English, the word &quot;buggery&quot; and its derivations have taken on a remarkably broad range of uses, many of which are generally understood as being slightly (and usually deliberately) exaggerated and comical in tone, and while probably considered somewhat &quot;common&quot;, most of these usages are now quite broadly accepted and are in general not considered overly offensive. It was this peculiar Australian usage pattern which obviously made it attractive to Doyle and Pickhaver as a title.

For example – one can tell someone to &quot;go to buggery&quot;, which is a slightly stronger equivalent to the American expression &quot;take a hike&quot;. The adverb &quot;buggered&quot; is also widely used and often refers to a broken or defective object (&quot;my car&#x27;s buggered&quot;) or is used as a means of expressing tiredness or exhaustion (&quot;I&#x27;m buggered after that bushwalk&quot;). The word can also be used as an expression of lack, such as in the phrase &quot;There&#x27;s bugger-all (money) left in the bank&quot;. But this novel range of usages is evidently only inoffensive in Australia, and the use of the word &quot;buggery&quot; in the series title was a source of some amazement to overseas guests such as Canadian comedian Mike Myers.

==Format==
Essentially a blend of variety, talk show, and sketch comedy. The show interspersed interviews with guests, giveaway segments, discussion and comment by Roy &amp; HG, music segments, pre-taped comedy inserts (including a soap opera parody performed by a number of famous sporting personalities including footballers Paul Sironen and Warren Boland) and a closing musical performance by a well-known Australasian music star of the past.

The guest interviews were often highlights of the show, as Roy and HG honed their often revealing two-handed &quot;good cop/bad cop&quot; interview style. Typically HG opened by asking some seemingly innocuous questions (some of which had a subtle sting) and he was followed by Roy, who had a much more probing and sarcastic manner and specialised in asking questions that put the guest &quot;on the spot&quot;. One memorable interview was with actor/comedian Mike Myers who jokingly flirted with Doyle and the two danced arm-in-arm afterwards. Other notable guests included actor Roger Moore, singer Pat Benatar, musician Nick Cave and comedian/writer Alexei Sayle. One celebrity who turned down an invitation to appear was Sting as his manager was concerned about the show&#x27;s title.

Other regular features included:-
* The Nissan Cedrics, a singing duo composed of Dannielle Gaha and Louise Anton who provided musical links and jingles to introduce guests and regular segments and also occasionally performed full-length songs. The name of the duo was a tribute to the classic 1960s car. They released a self-titled album of cover songs in 1997.
* A segment where an Australian sporting or entertainment celebrity would appear in a pre-filmed sketch where they would mime an old classic song. One memorable example was actor Andrew McFarlane who acted out a WW2 movie spoof whilst miming Dean Martin&#x27;s &quot;Everybody Loves Somebody&quot;.
* The weekly &#x27;This is Living&#x27; giveaway where the couple or party that Roy &amp; HG judged to be the best-dressed amongst the studio audience were given a prize. In the first series, the prize was an over-sized &#x27;Meat-Tray&#x27; over which Roy and HG gave a lurid description of how they hunted and shot it earlier that week. In the later series, the prize was a special night-out for the winners to a venue carefully chosen by Roy &amp; HG. Amongst the memorable evenings were a smorgasboard dinner and pokies at an RSL club, a visit to a Greyhound track and front-row seats to a showing of Kenneth Branagh&#x27;s 4-hour movie version of Hamlet.
* Ian &#x27;Turps&#x27; Turpie performed as &#x27;Club President&#x27; (MC) for all 4 years of the show, being referred to as &quot;The Giant of the G-Chord&quot; and he also performed musical numbers. In addition, he starred in several comedy sketches, each of which ran for a number of short episodes. These were;- &quot;Turps about the House&quot; in which he played the flat-mate of the Nissan Cedrics, a police drama &quot;Sam Stain&quot; which also starred actor Harold Hopkins and TV presenter Indira Naidoo and Star Trek spoof &quot;Captain Ajax&quot; which also featured Hopkins (whose character&#x27;s name was Dogrooter) and a sultry cameo from Network Ten newsreader Anne Fulwood.
* As already mentioned above, another regular segment was the soap-opera parody &quot;Ian&quot; which, in addition to footballers Sironen and Boland, also featured musician Col Joye, athlete and actress Lisa Forrest, cricketer Greg Matthews and TV presenter Annette Shun Wah. When introducing the segment, HG usually described the show as &quot;extraordinary people doing bloody ordinary things&quot;.

==2000 Olympics==
The duo scored their greatest successes and reached a peak of popularity in 2000. Having moved to the commercial Seven Network, the official Australian broadcaster for the 2000 Summer Olympics, they were ideally placed to present a new version of the &quot;This Sporting Life&quot; concept. The series, &quot;The Dream with Roy and HG&quot;, gained record ratings and won them a huge new audience, and made their unofficial animal mascot, &#x27;Fatso the Fat-Arsed Wombat&#x27;, into a national icon.

==Awards==
* At the 39th Annual TV Week Logie Awards held in 1997, the program won the Logie for the &#x27;Most Outstanding Achievement In Comedy&#x27;
* At the 39th Annual TV Week Logie Awards held in 1997, the program was nominated for the &#x27;Most Popular Comedy Program&#x27;
* At the 40th Annual TV Week Logie Awards held in 1998, the program was nominated for the Logie for the &quot;Most Outstanding Achievement In Comedy&quot;.

<text>Gregory Vlastos (; ; July 27, 1907 – October 12, 1991) was a preeminent scholar of ancient philosophy, and author of many works on Plato and Socrates. He transformed the analysis of classical philosophy by applying techniques of modern analytic philosophy to restate and evaluate the views of Socrates and Plato.

==Life and career==
Vlastos was born in Istanbul, to a Scottish mother and a Greek father, where he received a Bachelor of Arts from Robert College before moving to Harvard University where he received a PhD in 1931. After teaching for several years at Queen&#x27;s University in Kingston, Ontario, Canada, he moved to Cornell University in 1948. He was Stuart Professor of Philosophy at Princeton University between 1955 and 1976. Upon his retirement from Princeton, he became Mills Professor of Philosophy at University of California, Berkeley until 1987. He received a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship in 1990. He was twice awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship, was a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a corresponding fellow of the British Academy, and a member of the American Philosophical Society. In 1988 he gave the British Academy&#x27;s Master-Mind Lecture. Vlastos died in 1991, before finishing a new compilation of essays on Socratic philosophy.

==Philosophical work==

Vlastos is credited with bringing about a renaissance of interest in Plato among philosophers throughout the world. Many of Vlastos&#x27; students have become important scholars of ancient philosophy, including Terence Irwin, Richard Kraut, Paul Woodruff, and Alexander Nehamas.

===Theory of Socratic philosophy===
In his work &quot;The Philosophy of Socrates: a Collection of Critical Essays&quot; (UNDP 1971), Vlastos advanced the idea &quot;that one can identify in certain Platonic dialogues a philosophical method and a collection of philosophical theses which may properly be attributed to Socrates.&quot; He suggested a plausible modern analytic framework for Socratic philosophy as a pursuit distinct from Platonic philosophy. The dialogues of Plato’s Socratic period, called &quot;elenctic dialogues&quot; for Socrates’s preferred method of questioning, are &quot;Apology&quot;, &quot;Charmides&quot;, &quot;Crito&quot;, &quot;Euthyphro&quot;, &quot;Gorgias&quot;, &quot;Hippias Minor&quot;, &quot;Ion&quot;, &quot;Laches&quot;, &quot;Protagoras&quot; and book 1 of the &quot;Republic&quot;. The idea remains controversial and those who agree with his position are referred to as Vlastosians.

<doc id="1036374" wikidata="Q375056" url="?curid=1036374" title="Juan Boscán Almogáver">
<text>Joan Boscà i Almogàver (, ; 1490 – 21 September 1542), was a Spanish poet who incorporated hendecasyllable verses into Spanish.

==Biography==
The exact date of birth for Boscà is unclear, but there is a consensus that he was born anywhere between 1487 and 1492. Boscà was born in Barcelona and was one of three children. His father, Joan Valentí Boscà, was a public official, and his mother was named Violant Almogàver. Boscà&#x27;s father died in 1492. Around 1507, Boscà left to live in the court of Fernando and Isabel, where he was a student of Lucio Marineo Siculo from Vizzini, Italy, who taught him the skill of translating Italian love poetry, Latin, and Greek lyrics into Spanish. Marineo&#x27;s teachings evidence the close cultural interactions that existed between Spain and Italy and helped to develop the talent of Boscán.

By 1522, Joan Boscà was working as a tutor to Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, Duke of Alba. In this same year, he participated with Garcilaso de la Vega in giving naval assistance to the Isle of Rhodes during a Turkish invasion. Boscà fought against the Turks again in 1532 with Álvarez de Toledo and Charles I in Vienna. During this period, Boscán had made serious progress in his mastery of verse in the Italian style.

Boscà is most famous for the incorporation of hendecasyllable verses into Spanish. Although he was preceded by Íñigo López de Mendoza, 1st Marquess of Santillana, who wrote 42 sonnets in the Italian style, Boscà was one of the first people to use the present-day structures of the sonnet in Castilian. His originality and open-minded nature made him an innovator, and his use of hendecasyllabic verse gave his poetry a distinctly creative flare that allowed him to emphasize the emotions and significance of each poem.

In the 1520s he came under the influence of Andrea Navagero, the Venetian ambassador to Spain. It is because of Navagiero&#x27;s persuasion that Boscà abandoned the traditional eight-syllable verses of Spanish poetry. Boscán was also influenced by another Italian ambassador (a friend of Navagiero) named Count Baldassare Castiglione. Boscán was urged by Castiglione and Garcilaso to translate the ambassador&#x27;s &quot;Il Cortegiano&quot; into Spanish, which was published on 2 April 1534 to great success.

With Boscán&#x27;s fame came great controversy, because he constantly had to combat with those who preferred the old style of poetry over the new. In 1539, he married Ana Girón de Rebolledo of Valencia and fathered three daughters. Boscán died on 21 September 1542 after becoming ill in Perpignan, while he was preparing some of his poetry for publication.

==Works==
Joan Boscà&#x27;s most famous works appear in &quot;Las obras de Boscán y algunas de Garcilaso de la Vega repartidas en quatro libros&quot; (&quot;The Works of Boscà and Some of Garcilaso de la Vega Divided in Four Volumes&quot;). In volume three, this includes &quot;Leandro y Hero&quot; (Leander and Hero), based on an ancient Greek fable and &quot;Ottava Rima&quot; (Royal Octave). A stanza of &quot;Ottava Rima&quot; reads:
Carlos Clavería, who has edited Boscán´s work, affirms that the reader who reaches the third book will find veritable treasures, including the above cited mythological poem based on Musaeus and with touches of Virgil and Hesiod. The reader will also find a Petrarchan poem that has includes a very surprising turn. &quot;Capítulo&quot;, which begins in a rather conventional manner, but then turns to describe in the last thirty-two tercets a painting from antiquity: Timanthes&#x27;s &quot;The Sacrifice of Iphigenia&quot; best known for the veil worn by Agamemnon, her father, since the poet was unable to show his immense suffering. This is one of the earliest ekphrasis found in Iberian Renaissance poetry. What cannot be shown or described in the poem is the extreme jealousy felt by the poetic voice.

==Later reputation==
Boscán&#x27;s and his close friend Garcilaso de la Vega (who he met at the Spanish court) are seen as very influential in the poetry of the Spanish Renaissance. Boscán was the first poet to introduce the Italian metres to Spain.

Boscán’s poems were published after his death by his widow around 1543 (Garcilaso died in 1536 and Boscà was given the task of editing some of his works before his own death on September 21, 1542). The collection proved popular: between 1543 and 1597, twenty-one editions were printed throughout Europe. While the collection was supposed to focus mainly on his poetry, Boscán was soon overshadowed by his friend Garcilaso. In contrast to Garcilaso, who explored several genres and themes in the new Italian style, Boscán wrote mostly about love. He has been compared to Fray Luis de León, a poet and professor of the 16th century, who also enjoyed the process of translating and writing poetry.

One of his works, &quot;Oh Sombra!&quot;, was adapted into a song by the British rock band Electrelane in 2004.

<text>Karrie Anne Webb (born 21 December 1974) is an Australian professional golfer. She plays mainly on the U.S.-based LPGA Tour, and also turns out once or twice a year on the ALPG Tour in her home country. She is a member of the World Golf Hall of Fame. She has 41 wins on the LPGA Tour, more than any other active player.

== Early life and amateur career ==

Webb was born in Ayr, Queensland. She was a member of the Australian Amateur team, making six international appearances from 1992 to 1994, including a 1994 appearance in the Espirito Santo Trophy World Amateur Golf Team Championships. This was the year she became the Australian Stroke Play Champion

==Professional career==
Webb began her professional golfing career in 1994 playing on the Ladies European Tour, where she finished second at the Women&#x27;s Australian Open, and the Futures Tour in the U.S., where she won one tournament. In 1995 she became the youngest ever winner of the Weetabix Women&#x27;s British Open in her rookie season in Europe, prior to it being classed as an LPGA major, and was European Rookie of the Year. She qualified for the LPGA Tour after she finished second at the LPGA Final Qualifying Tournament, despite playing with a broken bone in her wrist.

In 1996 Webb won her first LPGA tournament in her second LPGA start at the HealthSouth Inaugural, on the fourth hole of a sudden death
playoff. She won three other tournaments and became the first LPGA player to win $1 million mark in a single season, topping the year end money list. She was also the 1996 LPGA Rookie of the Year.

In 1997 Webb won three times on the LPGA Tour including another win at the Weetabix Women&#x27;s British Open, won her first Vare Trophy and was voted 1997 ESPY Best Female Golfer. In 1999 Webb won her first major championship at the du Maurier Ltd. Classic and won her first LPGA Tour Player of the Year award.

Webb also took part in the largest playoff in LPGA Tour history at the 1999 Jamie Farr Kroger Classic. Se Ri Pak birdied the first sudden death playoff hole to defeat Webb, Mardi Lunn, Carin Koch, Sherri Steinhauer, and Kelli Kuehne.

In 2000, Webb won two more major championships, following up her win at the Nabisco Championship with a win at the U.S. Women&#x27;s Open. This gained her a second consecutive Rolex Player of the Year title and Vare Trophy, and she topped the money list, missing out on a chance to become the LPGA&#x27;s first single-season $2 million winner by taking a mid season break to return home to Australia to run with the Olympic torch. Teamed with Rachel Hetherington representing Australia she won the Women&#x27;s World Cup in Malaysia, was awarded the preeminent sport award in Australia, the Dawn Fraser Award. and was named Female Player of the Year by the Golf Writers Association of America.

She successfully defended her U.S. Women&#x27;s Open title in 2001 and won the LPGA Championship, to become the youngest winner of the LPGA Career Grand Slam. She teamed with David Duval to play against Annika Sörenstam and Tiger Woods in a made-for-TV Battle at Bighorn between the two best male and two best female players in the world. At the time, it provided women&#x27;s golf its largest audience ever. Webb&#x27;s win at the 2002 Women&#x27;s British Open, which had become an LPGA major in 2001, meant she completed a Super Career Grand Slam – every available major championship in women&#x27;s golf in her career.

Webb then suffered a three-year slump. She collected just two LPGA wins in the next two years, and in 2005 had a best LPGA finish of tied sixth although she did team up with Rachel Hetherington to represent Australia at the Women&#x27;s World Cup of Golf and won her fifth ANZ Ladies Masters title back home in Australia.

Webb qualified for entry to the World Golf Hall of Fame in 2000, but was not eligible for induction until she had played ten LPGA Tour events in each of ten seasons. She met this criterion on 9 June 2005 when she completed the first round of the LPGA Championship. At age 30, she became the youngest living person ever to enter the Hall of Fame, and kept that distinction until 2007, when fellow LPGA star Se Ri Pak was inducted.

Webb staged a comeback season in 2006. In the final round at the Kraft Nabisco Championship she holed a 116-yard shot from the fairway to eagle the 18th hole, and then birdied the same hole in a sudden-death playoff to beat Lorena Ochoa and win her second Kraft Nabisco Championship. She won four other tournaments including the Evian Masters and Mizuno Classic. Her 2006 Kraft Nabisco win took her into the top ten of the Women&#x27;s World Golf Rankings for the first time since they were introduced in February 2006.

Her 41 LPGA Tour victories places her tied for 10th with Babe Zaharias on the list of players with the most career LPGA tournament wins and first among all active players.

<doc id="1036390" wikidata="Q5274945" url="?curid=1036390" title="Diener">
<text>A diener is a morgue worker responsible for handling, moving, and cleaning the corpse. In the UK, the equivalent job title is &quot;mortuary assistant&quot;, whilst the preparation, evisceration and reconstruction of the deceased is performed by an anatomical pathology technician. In the US, dieners are also referred to as &quot;mortuary assistants&quot; or &quot;autopsy technicians&quot;. The word is derived from the German word &quot;Leichendiener&quot;, which literally means &quot;corpse servant&quot; (&quot;diener&quot; means &quot;servant&quot;.).

A diener performs a number of tasks in medical schools and morgues. Helping a pathologist with examining and reconstructing cadavers are main tasks performed by a diener. A diener assists a pathologist or physician during an autopsy completing tasks such as handling tools and supplies, preparation of the deceased before and after autopsy. 
In addition to physical work with a pathologist and cadavers, dieners do work such as record keeping of identification and documentation of deceased in the form of items such as death certificates.

In the American Moravian Church (), the men and (particularly) the women who assist in church services (like the Lovefeast) are called &quot;dieners&quot;, from the German title for their office, &quot;Saaldiener&quot; or &quot;chapel servant&quot;.

== Education ==
Education requirements for a diener includes a high school diploma or a GED certificate. Requirements also include completion of one year of undergraduate coursework composed of at least six semester hours in courses including biology, human anatomy, physiology, zoology, or criminal justice with laboratory work as well. Becoming a diener includes experience working as a laboratory assistant which involved use of surgical tools or human anatomy knowledge, instead of any undergraduate course work. Dieners can use their work experience to pursue a degree in similar fields such as forensics, clinical laboratory work, and law enforcement.

== Training ==
In the beginning stages of working as a diener, there are training requirements. Formal training requirements for a diener includes manual handling, infection control, and safety procedures. The training has two parts: Taught Units and Workplace Competency.

The first portion, Taught Units, consists of five sections.

* Human Anatomy and Physiology for Anatomical Pathology Technicians
* Governance and Administration of Mortuary Practices
* Health and Safety in the Mortuary
* Microbiology and Infection Control for Anatomical Pathology Technicians
* Principles of Effective Communication for Anatomical Pathology Technicians

The second portion of formal training, Workplace Competency, consists of five sections as well.

* Assist with Post Mortem Examinations
* Preparation and Operation of a Mortuary
* Prepare for Post Mortem Examinations
* Team Working
* Viewing of the Deceased

In addition to formal training, dieners learn how to do basic tasks through shadowing a mentor.

== Skills ==
Skills a diener needs includes physical strength, reasoning, problem solving, attention to detail, and stress tolerance. In addition to the above skills, integrity/honesty, visual identification, flexibility, and reading are other important skills a diener should possess.

Another skill is the ability to work with human remains, diagnostic tools, and surgical instruments involved in a death investigation. A diener is required to be knowledgeable of lab and safety techniques including the collection and preservation of evidence and any tasks involving any chemical, biological, microbiological, pathogenic and miscellaneous hazards.

== Places of employment ==
A diener can work in areas that include hospital mortuaries morgues and medical schools. When working in a medical school, a diener helps train medical students, interns, and residents on performing an autopsy. Dieners help train medical students, interns, and residents in autopsy techniques and procedures.

== Duties ==
The multiple duties of a diener are typically the same wherever employed.

One of the main duties is to assist in autopsies. One duty in assisting with autopsies includes positioning patients for them to be fingerprinted. Another task done as a part of assisting with autopsies involves the removal of organs, tissues, and any fluids (such as blood) from the body. Fingerprinting patients, removing tissues and organs, drawing and spinning blood samples are done as a part of collecting and preserving forensic evidence, which is a portion of the responsibilities for a diener. In autopsy assisting, a diener can collect and keep record of evidence relating to a patient’s death. Examples of collectible evidence includes any body tissues, slides, radiographs, and any on-scene evidence. A diener also performs tasks such as x-rays (body and dental) and developing and evaluating films from x-rays as a part of record keeping. The record keeping of evidence examined in an autopsy by a diener is used in the determination of the cause of death.

In addition to evidence collection and record keeping, a diener has the task of explaining the process of an autopsy in entirety to other employees, law enforcement, and others interested, such as family members of the dead.

A diener performs tasks such as checking inventory and placing orders for equipment and supplies regularly. In addition to performing inventory-related tasks, a diener will clean radiological and medical equipment, as well as inspecting equipment for any issues.

== Hazards ==
There are hazards involved with being a diener. There are approximately six types of hazards that a diener is at risk for: mechanical, sharp force, electrical, chemical, radiation, and infection.

Mechanical hazards categorize harm such as back injury from activity such as transporting cadavers. Sharp force hazards categorize any bodily harm from the use of tools and equipment such as scalpels and needles which resulting in cuts or punctures. Electrical hazards encompass any potential harm in the form of shock from the use of equipment like saws or defibrillators. Chemical hazards include harm from the use of a variety of chemicals used in the autopsy process such as cyanide and formaldehyde. Radiation hazards are related to any exposure from performing x-rays. Infection hazards are due to the potential that a cadaver is infected with a communicable disease.

== Promotion opportunities ==
A diener can be promoted to positions in the mortuary and forensic areas of practice. Dieners can advance to positions (such as a forensic morgue technician) and perform tasks of greater complexity and mainly works with a forensic pathologist, over a general pathologist. Dieners can be promoted to supervisory positions based upon the gaining of supervisory and administrative skills.

== Salary ==
The salary for a diener varies based upon education, experience, employer, and employment location (i.e., city or state of employment). The salary is typically between $25,000 and $38,000 annually.

<doc id="1036394" wikidata="Q499249" url="?curid=1036394" title="Walter (name)">
<text>Walter is a German and English masculine given name of Germanic origin, composed of the elements &quot;walt-&quot; (Proto-Germanic &quot;*wald-&quot;) &quot;power&quot;, &quot;ruler&quot;, and &quot;hari&quot; (Proto-Germanic &quot;*χarja&quot;) &quot;army&quot;.

The name was first popularized by the epic German hero Walther von Aquitaine, and later from the name of the writer Walther von der Vogelweide.

The name is first recorded in the 6th century, with Walthari son of Wacho, who was king of the Lombards during 539–546. Old Germanic forms are recorded as &quot;Walthari&quot;, &quot;Waltari&quot;, &quot;Walthar&quot;, &quot;Waltar&quot;, &quot;Waltere&quot;, &quot;Waldheri&quot;, &quot;Waldhere&quot;, &quot;Waltheri&quot;, &quot;Walthere&quot;, &quot;Walther&quot;, &quot;Walter&quot;, &quot;Waldher&quot;, and &quot;Valter&quot;. The Old English equivalent is &quot;Wealdhere&quot;, Old Norse has &quot;Valðar&quot; and &quot; Valdarr&quot;. The name entered the French language as &quot;Gauthier&quot;, Spanish as &quot;Gutierre&quot;, Portuguese as &quot;Gualter&quot; and Italian as &quot;Gualtiero&quot;. The modern Dutch form of the name is &quot;Wouter&quot;. The German name has also been adopted in a number of languages in the spelling &quot;Valter&quot;.

The Latinized form is &quot;Waltharius&quot;, the title of a poem of the late 9th or early 10th century on the legendary Gothic king Walter of Aquitaine. A fragmentary Old English poem on the same character is known as &quot;Waldere&quot;. Jacob Grimm in &quot;Teutonic Mythology&quot; speculates that &quot;Walthari&quot;, literally &quot;wielder of hosts&quot;, may have been an epithet of the god of war, Ziu or Eor, and that the circumstance that the hero of the &quot;Waltharius&quot; poems loses his right hand in battle may be significant, linking him to the Norse tradition of Tyr.

==Geographical distribution==
As of 2014, 43.5% of all known bearers of the surname &quot;Walter&quot; were residents of Germany (frequency 1:643), 23.4% of the United States (1:5,374), 5.0% of Nigeria (1:12,307), 4.0% of France (1:5,814), 2.0% of Austria (1:1,467), 1.9% of England (1:10,157), 1.8% of Brazil (1:38,529), 1.6% of Australia (1:5,113), 1.4% of Angola (1:6,511), 1.3% of Canada (1:9,641), 1.3% of Switzerland (1:2,176), 1.2% of Ghana (1:7,682), 1.1% of Argentina (1:13,353), 1.0% of Poland (1:12,776) and 1.0% of South Africa (1:19,181).

<text>André Comte-Sponville (born 12 March 1952) is a French philosopher.

==Biography==
André Comte-Sponville was born in Paris, France. He studied in the École Normale Supérieure and earned a PhD from Panthéon-Sorbonne University, and is aggregated in philosophy. He is a proponent of atheism and materialism, but in a particular form, because of his spiritualistic aim.

The most important aspect of his work is an overcoming of traditional materialistic atheism in a perspective of post-materialism, because he demonstrates a spiritualization of atheism. This is especially present in his essay &quot;&quot;, published in 2006.

<text>(, &quot;Book of Settlements&quot;), often shortened to , is a medieval Icelandic written work which describes in considerable detail the settlement () of Iceland by the Norse in the 9th and 10th centuries CE.
 is divided into five parts and over 100 chapters. The first part tells of how the island was found. The latter parts count settlers quarter by quarter, beginning with west and ending with south. It traces important events and family history into the 12th century. More than 3,000 people and 1,400 settlements are described. It tells where each settler settled and provides a brief genealogy of his or her descendants. Sometimes short anecdote-like stories are also included. lists 435 people (&quot;&quot;, which includes men and women) as the initial settlers, the majority of them settling in the northern and southwestern parts of the island. It remains an invaluable source on both the history and genealogy of the Icelandic people.
Some have suggested a single author, while others have believed it to have been put together when people met at things (assemblies).

==Versions==
Ari Þorgilsson may have written the earliest version of in addition to his shorter ; or early versions may have been based on the genealogies that Ari states he left out of . The oldest surviving versions were written in the 13th and 14th centuries. The initial settlement of Iceland largely took place during the Viking Age between 870 and 930, but mentions descendants significantly later than the actual settlement period, at least into the 11th century.

Five versions of survive, of which three were written in the Middle Ages, the other two in the 17th century preserving medieval material:

* by Sturla Þórðarson, thought to have been written between 1275 and 1280
*A version in the early 14th-century compilation by Haukr Erlendsson, who says he based it on &quot;Sturlubók&quot; and a lost 13th-century version by , 
*&quot;Melabók&quot;, written c. 1300, of which only two sheets survive; genealogies were appended to this in the early 14th century
*&quot;Skarðsárbók&quot;, compiled prior to 1636 by from and 
*&quot;Þórðarbók&quot;, compiled in the 17th century by Þórður Jónsson from &quot;Skarðsárbók&quot; with the addition of sections of &quot;Melabók&quot;, some of which may derive from 

 is one of the main sources of information on the heathen religion of the settlers. According to Sveinbjörn Rafnsson, the &quot;Sturlubók&quot; and &#x27; versions tend to overemphasise Christianity, &quot;Melabók&quot; less so. An epilogue to Þórðarbók&quot;, probably copied from &quot;Melabók&quot;, justifies studying Icelandic history as a defence against foreign accusations of descent from &quot;slaves or rogues&quot; and because &quot;all reasonable peoples&quot; want to know about their origins.

==Historical accuracy==
Some debate exists on whether the account is entirely historical or if some elements of the document may contain folklore and mythology. According to Icelandic historian Gunnar Karlsson, the story about Hrafna-Flóki draws similarities to the Bible story of Noah and the great flood, who also used three ravens to guide him to dry land after the deluge. The earliest preserved versions of Landnámabók are written after the Christianization of Iceland and some historians theorise that some of the content may be an attempt of early Icelandic Christians to tie the island into biblical lore. Although Gunnar also notes this does not disprove the story and the accuracy of the document remains inconclusive.

Other stories in the document are supported by other sources, according to another Icelandic historian, Helgi Þorláksson, the story of Ingólfr Arnarson&#x27;s settlement seems to be accurate and in accordance with other sources.

<text>Shift Out (SO) and Shift In (SI) are ASCII control characters 14 and 15, respectively (0x0E and 0x0F). These are sometimes also called &quot;Control-N&quot; and &quot;Control-O&quot;.

The original purpose of these characters was to provide a way to shift a coloured ribbon, split longitudinally usually with red and black, up and down to the other colour in an electro-mechanical typewriter or teleprinter, such as the Teletype Model 38, to automate the same function of manual typewriters. Black was the conventional ambient default colour and so was shifted &quot;in&quot; or &quot;out&quot; with the other colour on the ribbon.

Later advancements in technology instigated use of this function for switching to a different font or character set and back. This was used, for instance, in the Russian character set known as KOI7-switched, where SO starts printing Russian letters, and SI starts printing Latin letters again. Similarly, they are used for switching between Katakana and Roman letters in the 7-bit version of the Japanese JIS X 0201.

SO/SI control characters also are used to display VT100 pseudographics. Shift In is also used in the 2G variant of SoftBank Mobile&#x27;s encoding for emoji.

The ISO/IEC 2022 standard (ECMA-35, JIS X 0202) standardises the generalized usage of SO and SI for switching between pre-designated character sets invoked over the 0x20–0x7F byte range. It refers to them respectively as Locking Shift One (LS1) and Locking Shift Zero (LS0) in an 8-bit environment, or as SO and SI in a 7-bit environment. In ISO-2022-compliant code sets where the 0x0E and 0x0F characters are used for the purpose of emphasis (such as an italic or red font) rather than a change of character set, they are referred to respectively as Upper Rail (UR) and Lower Rail (LR), rather than SO and SI.

<text>Wollstonecraft railway station is a suburban railway station located on the North Shore line, serving the Sydney suburb of Wollstonecraft. It is served by Sydney Trains T1 North Shore line services.

==History==
Wollstonecraft station opened on 1 May 1893 when the North Shore line opened from St Leonards to Milsons Point. Originally named Edwards Road, named after J. G Edwards, it was renamed Wollstonecraft on 1 September 1900. The original buildings were replaced in the 1980s.

The platform is located on a sharp 200-metre radius curve, leading to complaints from residents about the squeal from train wheels.

In May 2022, an upgrade to the station was opened with accessibility upgrades including new bridges and lifts, raising the station platform and drainage works. Tendering for the upgrade started in mid-2020, with Downer being awarded to manage contractor contracts, with the work contracts being then awarded to RJS Infrastructure.

<doc id="1036425" wikidata="Q649326" url="?curid=1036425" title="9×21mm">
<text>The 9×21mm pistol cartridge (also known as the 9×21mm GP, 9×21mm IMI, 9mm IMI, 9×21mm Italian, or 9mm Italian) was designed by Jager (Loano, Italy), then adopted and commercialised by Israel Military Industries for those jurisdictions where military service cartridges, like the 9×19mm Parabellum, are or were illegal for civilian purchase (i.e. Italy, France, Brazil, and Mexico).

==History==
Based on the 9×19mm Parabellum cartridge, the case was lengthened from . The bullet sits slightly deeper in the case, which results in almost the same overall length as the 9×19mm Parabellum cartridge ().

The cartridge was designed by Erasmus Giordano &amp; Armando Piscetta to be used for civil purposes with large pistols (also those designed for .45 ACP). It was named &quot;9 mm GP&quot;. The users were not enthusiastic at the very beginning for several reasons, such as the fact that barrels had to be modified.

During the 1980s, Israel Military Industries (IMI) started to use 9×21mm and received permission to import the UZI Defender (also called Micro Uzi) into Italy chambered for 9×21 IMI. It was the first official commercial launch for the 9×21mm. From that period on several companies in Italy started to sell 9×21mm pistols and ammunition. In just a few decades, the 9×21mm GP or 9×21 IMI became roughly 80% of the civilian small arms market in Italy.

==Competition use==
As it is a rimless round, the 9×21mm is used in USPSA/IPSC competition in open class firearms. A rimless case is preferred because, unlike semi-rimmed or rimmed cartridges, it will not tend to lock together with other rounds in a double-column magazine, resulting in a malfunction. As other .38 Super–based rimless cartridges became available, the 9×21mm decreased in popularity in the United States for competition use, but it is still widely used in many other parts of the world.

==Synonyms==
*9×21mm IMI
*9 mm IMI
*9mm Italiano
*Winchester 9×21mm WIN [124-gr. bullet]

==Cartridge dimensions==
The 9×21mm has 1.01 ml (15.5 grains H2O) cartridge case capacity.

9×21mm maximum C.I.P. cartridge dimensions All sizes in millimeters (mm).

The common rifling twist rate for this cartridge is 254 mm (1 in 10 in), 4 grooves, Ø lands = 8.79 mm, Ø grooves = 9.03 mm, land width = 3.80 mm and the primer type is small pistol.

According to the official C.I.P. (Commission Internationale Permanente pour l&#x27;épreuve des armes à feu portatives) guidelines, the 9×21mm case can handle up to piezo pressure. In C.I.P. regulated countries every pistol cartridge combo has to be proofed at 130% of this maximum C.I.P. pressure to certify for sale to consumers.

<doc id="1036434" wikidata="Q4391689" url="?curid=1036434" title="Grain Fort">
<text>Grain Fort is a former artillery fort located just east of the village of Grain, Kent. It was constructed in the 1860s to defend the confluence of the Rivers Medway and Thames during a period of tension with France. The fort&#x27;s location enabled its guns to support the nearby Grain Tower and Garrison Point Fort at Sheerness on the other side of the Medway. It was repeatedly altered and its guns upgraded at various points in its history, before being decommissioned in 1956 when the UK abolished its coastal defence programme. It was subsequently demolished. The remnants of the fort are still visible and have been incorporated into a coastal park.

==Strategic context==

The fort was constructed in response to a naval arms race between Britain and France. Britain&#x27;s coastal defences had not been substantially upgraded since the Napoleonic Wars, but a new generation of accurate and powerful guns, mounted on fast-moving, manoeuvrable iron-clad warships, had obsoleted the existing 18th and early 19th century forts along the British coastline. The Thames was seen as particularly vulnerable; as well as being one of the country&#x27;s most important trade routes, it possessed several naval installations of great importance, including the victualling yards at Deptford, the armaments works of Woolwich Arsenal, the shipbuilding yards at North Woolwich, and the magazines at Purfleet.

The government&#x27;s response to the increased threat was to appoint a Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom, which published a far-reaching report in 1860. It recommended that many existing forts should be upgraded or rebuilt entirely, and that new forts should be constructed to guard particularly strategic or vulnerable points along the coast. In all, around 70 forts and batteries were constructed around the English coast as a result of the Royal Commission&#x27;s report.

An existing gun battery, Grain Tower, already existed just off the shoreline at Grain, about away from the site of the later Grain Fort. It had been built in the style of a Martello tower between 1848 and 1855 but the introduction of powerful and accurate rifled muzzle loader (RML) guns during the 1850s made it obsolete as soon as it was completed. The 1860 Commission report recommended that Grain Tower should be turned into a fully casemated fort, which would be built around the existing structure. However, the cost of doing this was seen as excessive and the proposal was dropped as part of a cost-cutting exercise to reduce the overall cost of the fort-building programme. Instead, a
new land fort was built at Grain, while the existing battery at Garrison Point on the Isle of Sheppey was upgraded and fortified to create Garrison Point Fort.

==Construction and layout==
Grain Fort was constructed between 1861–68 to a heptagonal design. It initially had thirteen open emplacements carried on an earthwork, under which lay the magazines and linking passages. A semi-circular brick keep on a north–south alignment stood at the centre of the fort. It provided barrack accommodation for the garrison and was designed to be defensible, with loopholes in its front face to facilitate musket fire. Similarly, its gorge at the rear, where the main entrance stood, had crenelations to provide protection for defenders faced with a rearward attack. In front of the keep was a ditch, accessed via a gate at the rear of the fort. It had four caponiers that guarded the angles and were accessed via passages through the underlying structure. An inner ditch around the keep was covered by a further three caponiers and two demi-caponiers which led into the earthwork ramparts in one direction and into the keep in the other. The keep could also be accessed via a bridge which connected it with the terreplein.

==Operational history==

Grain Fort&#x27;s initial armament consisted of 13 heavy RMLs (six 11-inch, four 9-inch and three 64-pdr. guns). By the end of the 19th century these had been replaced by four much more powerful guns: two 9.2-inch Mark X breech-loading guns and two 4.7-inch guns. The original thirteen emplacements were reduced to five by 1895. The fort continued in use during the Second World War and underwent further alterations when its two existing 6-inch close defence guns were enclosed within bomb-proof shelters. Fire control positions were also added, along with spigot mortars at each end of the terreplein. In 1956 the fort was decommissioned and sold to the local authority five years later, following which the surface buildings were demolished.

To supplement the fort&#x27;s firepower, two additional gun batteries were subsequently constructed nearby. These were Grain Wing Battery (constructed 1890–95) south of Grain Fort, and Dummy Battery (constructed 1861–68), about south of the fort. Neither was used for long before they were disarmed and used for other purposes, and both were decommissioned and sold off along with Grain Fort.

==Current status==

Little is now visible of Grain Fort above the ground. In addition to the keep&#x27;s demolition, the spaces within which the surface buildings once stood have been filled with rubble and rubbish. The fort&#x27;s earthworks and a brick revetment still survive and a path links the concrete aprons of the infilled gun emplacements. The front caponiers are buried but have also survived mostly intact. Magazines and tunnels still exist within the subsurface structure and have been visited by urban explorers. Many of the fittings are reported to still survive. The site of the fort is now within the Isle of Grain Coastal Park, which is managed by the Friends of the Coastal Park in partnership with its owners, St James Parish Council. The fort is part of a scheduled monument designated in 1976 to cover &quot;coastal artillery defences on the Isle of Grain, immediately east and south east of Grain village&quot;.
