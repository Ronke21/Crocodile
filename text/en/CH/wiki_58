<text>In mathematics, a simplicial set is a sequence of sets with internal order structure (abstract simplices) and maps between them. Simplicial sets are higher-dimensional generalizations of directed graphs. 

Every simplicial set gives rise to a &quot;nice&quot; topological space, known as its geometric realization. This realization consists of geometric simplices, glued together according to the rules of the simplicial set. Indeed, one may view a simplicial set as a purely combinatorial construction designed to capture the essence of a topological space for the purposes of homotopy theory. Specifically, the category of simplicial sets carries a natural model structure, and the corresponding homotopy category is equivalent to the familiar homotopy category of topological spaces.

Formally, a simplicial set may be defined as a contravariant functor from the simplex category to the category of sets. Simplicial sets were introduced in 1950 by Samuel Eilenberg and Joseph A. Zilber.

Simplicial sets are used to define quasi-categories, a basic notion of higher category theory. A construction analogous to that of simplicial sets can be carried out in any category, not just in the category of sets, yielding the notion of simplicial objects.

==Motivation==

A simplicial set is a categorical (that is, purely algebraic) model capturing those topological spaces that can be built up (or faithfully represented up to homotopy) from simplices and their incidence relations. This is similar to the approach of CW complexes to modeling topological spaces, with the crucial difference that simplicial sets are purely algebraic and do not carry any actual topology.

To get back to actual topological spaces, there is a &quot;geometric realization&quot; functor which turns simplicial sets into compactly generated Hausdorff spaces. Most classical results on CW complexes in homotopy theory are generalized by analogous results for simplicial sets. While algebraic topologists largely continue to prefer CW complexes, there is a growing contingent of researchers interested in using simplicial sets for applications in algebraic geometry where CW complexes do not naturally exist.

== Intuition ==

Simplicial sets can be viewed as a higher-dimensional generalization of directed multigraphs. A simplicial set contains vertices (known as &quot;0-simplices&quot; in this context) and arrows (&quot;1-simplices&quot;) between some of these vertices. Two vertices may be connected by several arrows, and directed loops that connect a vertex to itself are also allowed. Unlike directed multigraphs, simplicial sets may also contain higher simplices. A 2-simplex, for instance, can be thought of as a two-dimensional &quot;triangular&quot; shape bounded by a list of three vertices &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot; and three arrows &quot;B&quot; → &quot;C&quot;, &quot;A&quot; → &quot;C&quot; and &quot;A&quot; → &quot;B&quot;. In general, an &quot;n&quot;-simplex is an object made up from a list of &quot;n&quot; + 1 vertices (which are 0-simplices) and &quot;n&quot; + 1 faces (which are (&quot;n&quot; − 1)-simplices). The vertices of the &quot;i&quot;-th face are the vertices of the &quot;n&quot;-simplex minus the &quot;i&quot;-th vertex. The vertices of a simplex need not be distinct and a simplex is not determined by its vertices and faces: two different simplices may share the same list of faces (and therefore the same list of vertices), just like two different arrows in a multigraph may connect the same two vertices.

Simplicial sets should not be confused with abstract simplicial complexes, which generalize simple undirected graphs rather than directed multigraphs.

Formally, a simplicial set &quot;X&quot; is a collection of sets &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;, &quot;n&quot; = 0, 1, 2, ..., together with certain maps between these sets: the &quot;face maps&quot; &quot;d&quot;&quot;n&quot;,&quot;i&quot; : &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot; → &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1 (&quot;n&quot; = 1, 2, 3, ... and 0 ≤ &quot;i&quot; ≤ &quot;n&quot;) and &quot;degeneracy maps&quot; &quot;s&quot;&quot;n&quot;,&quot;i&quot; : &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;→&quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;+1 (&quot;n&quot; = 0, 1, 2, ... and 0 ≤ &quot;i&quot; ≤ &quot;n&quot;). We think of the elements of &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot; as the &quot;n&quot;-simplices of &quot;X&quot;. The map &quot;d&quot;&quot;n&quot;,&quot;i&quot; assigns to each such &quot;n&quot;-simplex its &quot;i&quot;-th face, the face &quot;opposite to&quot; (i.e. not containing) the &quot;i&quot;-th vertex. The map &quot;s&quot;&quot;n&quot;,&quot;i&quot; assigns to each &quot;n&quot;-simplex the degenerate (&quot;n&quot;+1)-simplex which arises from the given one by duplicating the &quot;i&quot;-th vertex. This description implicitly requires certain consistency relations among the maps &quot;d&quot;&quot;n&quot;,&quot;i&quot; and &quot;s&quot;&quot;n&quot;,&quot;i&quot;. 

Rather than requiring these &quot;simplicial identities&quot; explicitly as part of the definition, the short modern definition uses the language of category theory.

==Formal definition==

Let Δ denote the simplex category. The objects of Δ are nonempty totally ordered sets. Each object is uniquely order isomorphic to an object of the form
:[&quot;n&quot;] = {0, 1, ..., &quot;n&quot;}
with &quot;n&quot; ≥ 0. The morphisms in Δ are (non-strictly) order-preserving functions between these sets.

A simplicial set &quot;X&quot; is a contravariant functor

:&quot;X&quot; : Δ → Set

where Set is the category of sets. (Alternatively and equivalently, one may define simplicial sets as covariant functors from the opposite category Δop &quot;→&quot;f Set.) Given a simplicial set &quot;X,&quot; we often write &quot;Xn&quot; instead of &quot;X&quot;([&quot;n&quot;]).

Simplicial sets form a category, usually denoted sSet, whose objects are simplicial sets and whose morphisms are natural transformations between them. This is the category of presheaves on Δ. As such, it is a topos.

===Face and degeneracy maps and simplicial identities===
The morphisms (maps) of the simplex category Δ are generated by two particularly important families of morphisms, whose images under a given simplicial set functor are called the face maps and degeneracy maps of that simplicial set.

The &quot;face maps&quot; of a simplicial set &quot;X&quot; are the images in that simplicial set of the morphisms formula_1, where formula_2 is the only (order-preserving) injection formula_3 that &quot;misses&quot; formula_4.
Let us denote these face maps by formula_5 respectively, so that formula_6 is a map formula_7. If the first index is clear, we write formula_8 instead of formula_6.

The &quot;degeneracy maps&quot; of the simplicial set &quot;X&quot; are the images in that simplicial set of the morphisms formula_10, where formula_11 is the only (order-preserving) surjection formula_12 that &quot;hits&quot; formula_4 twice.
Let us denote these degeneracy maps by formula_14 respectively, so that formula_15 is a map formula_16. If the first index is clear, we write formula_17 instead of formula_15.

The defined maps satisfy the following simplicial identities:

#formula_19 if &quot;i&quot; &lt; &quot;j&quot;. (This is short for formula_20 if 0 ≤ &quot;i&quot; &lt; &quot;j&quot; ≤ &quot;n&quot;.)
#formula_21 if &quot;i&quot; &lt; &quot;j&quot;.
#formula_22 if &quot;i&quot; = &quot;j&quot; or &quot;i&quot; = &quot;j&quot; + 1.
#formula_23 if &quot;i&quot; &gt; &quot;j&quot; + 1.
#formula_24 if &quot;i&quot; ≤ &quot;j&quot;.

Conversely, given a sequence of sets &quot;Xn&quot; together with maps formula_25 and formula_26 that satisfy the simplicial identities, there is a unique simplicial set &quot;X&quot; that has these face and degeneracy maps. So the identities provide an alternative way to define simplicial sets.

==Examples==
Given a partially ordered set (&quot;S&quot;, ≤), we can define a simplicial set &quot;NS&quot;, called the nerve of &quot;S&quot;, as follows: for every object [&quot;n&quot;] of Δ we set &quot;NS&quot;([&quot;n&quot;]) = homposet( [&quot;n&quot;] , &quot;S&quot;), the set of order-preserving maps from [&quot;n&quot;] to &quot;S&quot;. Every morphism φ: [&quot;n&quot;] → [&quot;m&quot;] in Δ is an order preserving map, and via composition induces a map &quot;NS&quot;(φ) : &quot;NS&quot;([&quot;m&quot;]) → &quot;NS&quot;([&quot;n&quot;]). It is straightforward to check that &quot;NS&quot; is a contravariant functor from Δ to Set: a simplicial set.

Concretely, the &quot;n&quot;-simplices of the nerve &quot;NS&quot;, i.e. the elements of &quot;NS&quot;&quot;n&quot; = &quot;NS&quot;([&quot;n&quot;]), can be thought of as ordered length-(&quot;n&quot;+1) sequences of elements from &quot;S&quot;: (&quot;a&quot;0 ≤ &quot;a&quot;1 ≤ ... ≤ &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot;). The face map &quot;d&quot;&quot;i&quot; drops the &quot;i&quot;-th element from such a list, and the degeneracy maps &quot;s&quot;&quot;i&quot; duplicates the &quot;i&quot;-th element.

A similar construction can be performed for every category &quot;C&quot;, to obtain the nerve &quot;NC&quot; of &quot;C&quot;. Here, &quot;NC&quot;([&quot;n&quot;]) is the set of all functors from [&quot;n&quot;] to &quot;C&quot;, where we consider [&quot;n&quot;] as a category with objects 0,1...,&quot;n&quot; and a single morphism from &quot;i&quot; to &quot;j&quot; whenever &quot;i&quot; ≤ &quot;j&quot;.

Concretely, the &quot;n&quot;-simplices of the nerve &quot;NC&quot; can be thought of as sequences of &quot;n&quot; composable morphisms in &quot;C&quot;: &quot;a&quot;0 → &quot;a&quot;1 → ... → &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot;. (In particular, the 0-simplices are the objects of &quot;C&quot; and the 1-simplices are the morphisms of &quot;C&quot;.) The face map &quot;d&quot;0 drops the first morphism from such a list, the face map &quot;d&quot;&quot;n&quot; drops the last, and the face map &quot;d&quot;&quot;i&quot; for 0 &lt; &quot;i&quot; &lt; &quot;n&quot; drops &quot;ai&quot; and composes the &quot;i&quot;-th and (&quot;i&quot; + 1)-th morphisms. The degeneracy maps &quot;s&quot;&quot;i&quot; lengthen the sequence by inserting an identity morphism at position &quot;i&quot;.

We can recover the poset &quot;S&quot; from the nerve &quot;NS&quot; and the category &quot;C&quot; from the nerve &quot;NC&quot;; in this sense simplicial sets generalize posets and categories.

Another important class of examples of simplicial sets is given by the singular set &quot;SY&quot; of a topological space &quot;Y&quot;. Here &quot;SY&quot;&quot;n&quot; consists of all the continuous maps from the standard topological &quot;n&quot;-simplex to &quot;Y&quot;. The singular set is further explained below.

==The standard &quot;n&quot;-simplex and the category of simplices==

The standard &quot;n&quot;-simplex, denoted Δ&quot;n&quot;, is a simplicial set defined as the functor homΔ(-, [&quot;n&quot;]) where [&quot;n&quot;] denotes the ordered set {0, 1, ... ,&quot;n&quot;} of the first (&quot;n&quot; + 1) nonnegative integers. (In many texts, it is written instead as hom([&quot;n&quot;],-) where the homset is understood to be in the opposite category Δop.)

By the Yoneda lemma, the &quot;n&quot;-simplices of a simplicial set &quot;X&quot; stand in 1–1 correspondence with the natural transformations from Δ&quot;n&quot; to &quot;X,&quot; i.e. formula_27.

Furthermore, &quot;X&quot; gives rise to a category of simplices, denoted by formula_28 , whose objects are maps (&quot;i.e.&quot; natural transformations) Δ&quot;n&quot; → &quot;X&quot; and whose morphisms are natural transformations Δ&quot;n&quot; → Δ&quot;m&quot; over &quot;X&quot; arising from maps [&quot;n&quot;] &quot;→&quot; [&quot;m&quot;] in Δ. That is, formula_28 is a slice category of Δ over &quot;X&quot;. The following isomorphism shows that a simplicial set &quot;X&quot; is a colimit of its simplices:

: formula_30

where the colimit is taken over the category of simplices of &quot;X&quot;.

==Geometric realization==
There is a functor |•|: sSet &quot;→&quot; CGHaus called the geometric realization taking a simplicial set &quot;X&quot; to its corresponding realization in the category |•|: sSet &quot;→&quot; CGHaus of compactly-generated Hausdorff topological spaces. Intuitively, the realization of &quot;X&quot; is the topological space (in fact a CW complex) obtained if every &quot;n-&quot;simplex of &quot;X&quot; is replaced by a topological &quot;n-&quot;simplex (a certain &quot;n-&quot;dimensional subset of (&quot;n&quot; + 1)-dimensional Euclidean space defined below) and these topological simplices are glued together in the fashion the simplices of &quot;X&quot; hang together. In this process the orientation of the simplices of &quot;X&quot; is lost.

To define the realization functor, we first define it on standard n-simplices Δ&quot;n&quot; as follows: the geometric realization |Δ&quot;n&quot;| is the standard topological &quot;n&quot;-simplex in general position given by

:formula_31

The definition then naturally extends to any simplicial set &quot;X&quot; by setting

:|X| = limΔ&quot;n&quot; → &quot;X&quot; | Δ&quot;n&quot;|

where the colimit is taken over the n-simplex category of &quot;X&quot;. The geometric realization is functorial on sSet.

It is significant that we use the category CGHaus of compactly-generated Hausdorff spaces, rather than the category Top of topological spaces, as the target category of geometric realization: like sSet and unlike Top, the category CGHaus is cartesian closed; the categorical product is defined differently in the categories Top and CGHaus, and the one in CGHaus corresponds to the one in sSet via geometric realization.

==Singular set for a space==
The singular set of a topological space &quot;Y&quot; is the simplicial set &quot;SY&quot; defined by 
:(&quot;SY&quot;)([&quot;n&quot;]) = homT&quot;op&quot;(|Δ&quot;n&quot;|, &quot;Y&quot;) for each object [&quot;n&quot;] ∈ Δ.

Every order-preserving map φ:[&quot;n&quot;]→[&quot;m&quot;] induces a continuous map |Δ&quot;n&quot;|→|Δ&quot;m&quot;| in a natural way, which by composition yields &quot;SY&quot;(&quot;φ&quot;) : &quot;SY&quot;([&quot;m&quot;]) → &quot;SY&quot;([&quot;n&quot;]). This definition is analogous to a standard idea in singular homology of &quot;probing&quot; a target topological space with standard topological &quot;n&quot;-simplices. Furthermore, the singular functor &quot;S&quot; is right adjoint to the geometric realization functor described above, i.e.:

:homTop(|&quot;X&quot;|, &quot;Y&quot;) ≅ homsSet(&quot;X&quot;, &quot;SY&quot;)

for any simplicial set &quot;X&quot; and any topological space &quot;Y&quot;. Intuitively, this adjunction can be understood as follows: a continuous map from the geometric realization of &quot;X&quot; to a space &quot;Y&quot; is uniquely specified if we associate to every simplex of &quot;X&quot; a continuous map from the corresponding standard topological simplex to &quot;Y,&quot; in such a fashion that these maps are compatible with the way the simplices in &quot;X&quot; hang together.

==Homotopy theory of simplicial sets==
In order to define a model structure on the category of simplicial sets, one has to define fibrations, cofibrations and weak equivalences. One can define fibrations to be Kan fibrations. A map of simplicial sets is defined to be a weak equivalence if its geometric realization is a weak homotopy equivalence of spaces. A map of simplicial sets is defined to be a cofibration if it is a monomorphism of simplicial sets. It is a difficult theorem of Daniel Quillen that the category of simplicial sets with these classes of morphisms becomes a model category, and indeed satisfies the axioms for a proper closed simplicial model category.

A key turning point of the theory is that the geometric realization of a Kan fibration is a Serre fibration of spaces. With the model structure in place, a homotopy theory of simplicial sets can be developed using standard homotopical algebra methods. Furthermore, the geometric realization and singular functors give a Quillen equivalence of closed model categories inducing an equivalence

:|•|: &quot;Ho&quot;(sSet) ↔ &quot;Ho&quot;(Top)

between the homotopy category for simplicial sets and the usual homotopy category of CW complexes with homotopy classes of continuous maps between them. It is part of the general
definition of a Quillen adjunction that the right adjoint functor (in this case, the singular set functor) carries fibrations (resp. trivial fibrations) to fibrations (resp. trivial fibrations).

==Simplicial objects==

A simplicial object &quot;X&quot; in a category &quot;C&quot; is a contravariant functor

:&quot;X&quot; : Δ → &quot;C&quot;

or equivalently a covariant functor
:&quot;X&quot;: Δop → &quot;C,&quot;

where Δ still denotes the simplex category and op the opposite category. When &quot;C&quot; is the category of sets, we are just talking about the simplicial sets that were defined above. Letting &quot;C&quot; be the category of groups or category of abelian groups, we obtain the categories sGrp of simplicial groups and sAb of simplicial abelian groups, respectively.

Simplicial groups and simplicial abelian groups also carry closed model structures induced by that of the underlying simplicial sets.

The homotopy groups of simplicial abelian groups can be computed by making use of the Dold–Kan correspondence which yields an equivalence of categories between simplicial abelian groups and bounded chain complexes and is given by functors

:&quot;N:&quot; sAb → Ch+

and

: Γ: Ch+ →  sAb.

==History and uses of simplicial sets==
Simplicial sets were originally used to give precise and convenient descriptions of classifying spaces of groups. This idea was vastly extended by Grothendieck&#x27;s idea of
considering classifying spaces of categories, and in particular by Quillen&#x27;s work of algebraic K-theory. In this work, which earned him a Fields Medal, Quillen
developed surprisingly efficient methods for manipulating
infinite simplicial sets. These methods were used in other areas on the border between algebraic geometry and topology. For instance, the André–Quillen homology of a ring is a &quot;non-abelian homology&quot;, defined and studied in this way.

Both the algebraic K-theory and the André–Quillen homology are defined using algebraic data to write down a simplicial set, and then taking the homotopy groups of this simplicial set.

Simplicial methods are often useful when one wants to prove that a space is a loop space. The basic idea is that if formula_32 is a group with classifying space formula_33, then formula_32 is homotopy equivalent to the loop space formula_35. If formula_33 itself is a group, we can iterate the procedure, and formula_32 is homotopy equivalent to the double loop space formula_38. In case formula_32 is an abelian group, we can actually iterate this infinitely many times, and obtain that formula_32 is an infinite loop space.

Even if formula_41 is not an abelian group, it can happen that it has a composition which is sufficiently commutative so that one can use the above idea to prove that formula_41 is an infinite loop space. In this way, one can prove that the algebraic formula_43-theory of a ring, considered as a topological space, is an infinite loop space.

In recent years, simplicial sets have been used in higher category theory and derived algebraic geometry. Quasi-categories can be thought of as categories in which the composition of morphisms is defined only up to homotopy, and information about the composition of higher homotopies is also retained. Quasi-categories are defined as simplicial sets satisfying one additional condition, the weak Kan condition.

<doc id="1027792" wikidata="Q1065092" url="?curid=1027792" title="Captain Charles Johnson">
<text>Captain Charles Johnson was the British author of the 1724 book &quot;A General History of the Robberies and Murders of the most notorious Pyrates&quot;, whose identity remains a mystery. No record exists of a captain by this name, and &quot;Captain Charles Johnson&quot; is generally considered a pen name for one of London&#x27;s writer-publishers. Some scholars have suggested that the author was actually Daniel Defoe, but this is disputed.

A prime source for the biographies of many well known pirates of the era, Johnson gave an almost mythical status to the more colourful characters, and it is likely that the author used considerable artistic licence in his accounts of pirate conversations. First appearing in Charles Rivington&#x27;s shop in London, the book sold so well that by 1726, an enlarged fourth edition had appeared. English naval historian David Cordingly writes: &quot;It has been said, and there seems no reason to question this, that Captain Johnson created the modern conception of pirates.&quot;

==Character of the author==
Johnson&#x27;s identity is unknown, but he demonstrates a knowledge of the sailor&#x27;s speech and life, suggesting that he could have been an actual sea captain. He could also have been a professional writer using a pseudonym who was well versed in the sea. If this is true, the name may have been chosen to reflect playwright Charles Johnson, who had a play called &quot;The Successful Pyrate&quot; performed in 1712. The play addressed the career of Henry Every, and it had been something of a scandal for seeming to praise a criminal. Following the book, many biographies and catalogs of criminals were published, including catalogs of highwaymen and prostitutes. This theory suggests that the &quot;Charles Johnson&quot; of the pirate catalog was merely taking part in a burgeoning industry in criminal biography.

==Identity of author==
The author has remained unknown in spite of numerous attempts by historians to discover his identity. There has been no record found of anyone with the name Charles Johnson serving as a captain in any capacity, save forty-two years before the publication of &quot;A General History&quot;. There was a playwright by that name in the early 18th century, but there are no ties to piracy found in his works. Some have suggested that the &quot;Captain&quot; was in fact a common pirate, but again, there is no record of this man.

===Daniel Defoe===

In 1932, literary scholar and writer John Robert Moore posited that Daniel Defoe be acknowledged the author of &quot;A General History&quot;. After years of research in connection with a collection of Defoe&#x27;s works, Moore published a study of his findings, detailing his argument for Defoe&#x27;s authorship of this, and other works. Moore declared that &quot;A General History&quot; was &quot;substantially&quot; a work of Defoe based on writing style (including frequent meditations on morality similar to in Defoe&#x27;s work) and content similar to other pieces that have been attributed to Defoe. Moore argued that Defoe&#x27;s interest in subjects such as &quot;seafaring&quot; and criminals (including pirates) shows that &quot;A General History&quot; falls squarely into his repertoire. Moore posited that not only could other works be used to confirm that Defoe wrote &quot;A General History&quot;, but that &quot;A General History&quot; could be used to endorse his authorship of those same works. Another point that Moore counted on to validate his claims was that many authors, to include historians, had used &quot;A General History of the Pyrates&quot; as a source of information for their own writings.

Moore&#x27;s study and his reputation as a Defoe scholar was so convincing that most libraries recataloged &quot;A General History&quot; under Defoe&#x27;s name.

====Criticism====
However, in 1988, scholars P. N. Furbank and W. R. Owens attacked the theory in &quot;The Canonisation of Daniel Defoe&quot;, in which they point out that there is no documentary evidence linking Johnson to Defoe, and that there are discrepancies between &quot;A General History&quot; and Defoe&#x27;s known works.

Disputes between different Defoe biographers called his body of work into question. Based on the accounts of these many biographers, Defoe&#x27;s attributed canon went from 101 different works to 570 between the years of 1790 and 1970. Most of these additions were made on the basis of internal, &quot;stylistic&quot; evidence. Moore&#x27;s publication of his Checklist of the Writings of Daniel Defoe added almost 200 works alone. Many questioned not only his attribution of &quot;A General History&quot; to Defoe, but the general trend of biographers to continually add to the canon. One critic even suggested, based on this trend, that all anonymous works from the early eighteenth century be designated Defoe&#x27;s.

Furbank and Owens&#x27; arguments against Defoe&#x27;s authorship of &quot;A General History&quot; address the parallels that are drawn to other works of the time (often also attributed to Defoe) and the logical fallacies that are necessary to subscribe to such a large, diverse catalog. Many of the ideas and phrases that Moore points to as parallels, and therefore as proof of Defoe&#x27;s continuity in his works, were commonplace in the eighteenth century. According to Furbank and Owens, Moore&#x27;s attribution of &quot;A General History&quot; to Defoe was based on no external evidence and only those few circumstantial parallels. They also cite inconsistencies in the accounts of Henry Every and John Gow.

Author Colin Woodard, in &quot;The Republic of Pirates&quot;, considers attribution of Johnson&#x27;s work to Defoe to be erroneous.

===Nathaniel Mist===
The author could have been publisher Nathaniel Mist (or somebody working for him). Woodard considers Mist &quot;far more likely&quot; than Defoe, citing Bialuschewski&#x27;s 2004 paper &quot;Daniel Defoe, Nathaniel Mist, and the &quot;General History of the Pyrates&quot;&quot;. Specifically, Woodard&#x27;s reasoning includes that Mist was a former sailor familiar with the West Indies, that he was a journalist and a publisher who lived near to and had a working relationship with Charles Rivington (the first publisher of record of &quot;A General History&quot;), that Mist was the man in whose name the book was registered at Her Majesty&#x27;s Stationery Office, and Mist&#x27;s Jacobitism (which perhaps gave him reason to write somewhat sympathetically about some of the pirates, as in &quot;A General History&quot;).

==Contents of the different editions==
The original publisher Charles Rivington emphasized the fact that the catalogue included stories of &quot;the remarkable ACTIONS and ADVENTURES of the two Female Pyrates, Mary Read and Anne Bonny&quot; A second edition came out within a few months, vastly enlarged and most likely assembled from writings by other authors. German and Dutch translations were published in 1725. These German- and Dutch-language versions greatly played up the salaciousness of the accounts of &quot;Amazon&quot; pirates.

==Modern editions and related works==
A &quot;General History of the Pyrates&quot; continues to be reprinted in many different editions, often with additional commentary, sometimes published under Charles Johnson&#x27;s name and sometimes under Daniel Defoe&#x27;s name. Nova Scotian author William Gilkerson published the children&#x27;s novel &quot;Pirates Passage&quot; (Trumpeter Books, 2006) which was inspired by the life and work of Charles Johnson, reissued as &quot;The Brotherhood of Pirates&quot;.

<text>The Kansas City Art Institute (KCAI) is a private art school in Kansas City, Missouri. The college was founded in 1885 and is an accredited by the National Association of Schools of Art and Design and Higher Learning Commission. The institute has approximately 75 faculty members and 700 students, and offers a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree.

==History==

The school was founded in 1885 when art enthusiasts formed the &quot;Sketch Club&quot; with the purpose of &quot;talking over art matters in general and to judge pictures.&quot; Meetings were originally in private homes and then moved to the Deardorf Building at 11th and Main in downtown Kansas City. The club had its first exhibition in 1887 and 12 benefactors stepped forward to form the &quot;Kansas City Art Association and School of Design.&quot;

In 1927, Howard Vanderslice purchased the August R. Meyer residence, a Germanic castle entitled Marburg and its estate at 44th and Warwick Boulevard adjacent to the planned Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art. A Wight and Wight addition was added to the building. The residence was later renamed &quot;Vanderslice Hall&quot; and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places along with another building on the campus—Mineral Hall. The campus has since expanded to .

In 1935, painter Thomas Hart Benton left New York City to teach at the school. Among the artists Benton influenced as a teacher at KCAI were Frederic James, Margot Peet, Jackson Lee Nesbitt, Roger Medearis, Glenn Gant, and Delmer J. Yoakum. Though Benton brought attention to the Art Institute, he was dismissed in 1941 after making disparaging references to, as he claimed, the excessive influence of homosexuals in the art world.

In 1992, the Kemper Museum of Contemporary Art opened on the west side of the campus. On the occasion of its 130th anniversary in 2015, the Kansas City Art Institute received an anonymous donation of $25 million, one of the largest gifts ever to an American art school. The money will be used to bolster the school&#x27;s general endowment, improve and renovate its campus adjacent to the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art and, in the form of a challenge grant of $6 million, sharply increase the number of scholarships the school is able to give out.

<text>Marian Smoluchowski (; 28 May 1872 – 5 September 1917) was a Polish physicist who worked in the territories of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He was a pioneer of statistical physics and made significant contributions to the theory of Brownian motion and stochastic processes. 

Smoluchowski graduated in physics from the University of Vienna in 1895 before becoming a &quot;privatdozent&quot; at the University of Lemberg three years later. In 1913, he was appointed the chair of the Faculty of Experimental Physics at the Jagellonian University in Kraków. He is known for the Smoluchowski equation, Einstein–Smoluchowski relation and Feynman–Smoluchowski ratchet.

==Life==
He was born in 1872 into an upper-class family in Vorder-Brühl, near Vienna, to father Wilhelm and mother Teofila (née Szczepanowska). He attended the prestigious Collegium Theresianum and subsequently studied physics at the University of Vienna (1890-95). In 1895, he obtained his doctorate based on his dissertation entitled &quot;Acoustical Studies of Elasticity of Soft Materials&quot;. His teachers included Franz S. Exner and Josef Stefan. Ludwig Boltzmann held a position at Munich University during Smoluchowski&#x27;s studies in Vienna, and Boltzmann returned to Vienna in 1894 when Smoluchowski was serving in the Austrian army. They apparently had no direct contact, although Smoluchowski&#x27;s work follows in the tradition of Boltzmann&#x27;s ideas.

After several years at other universities (Paris, Glasgow, Berlin), in 1899 Smoluchowski moved to Lwów (present-day Lviv), where he took a position at the University of Lwów. He was president of the Polish Copernicus Society of Naturalists, (1906–1907).

In 1913 Smoluchowski moved to Kraków to take over a chair in the Experimental Physics Department, succeeding August Witkowski, who had long envisioned Smoluchowski as his successor. When World War I began the following year, the work conditions became unusually difficult, as the spacious and modern Physics Department building, built by Witkowski a short time before, was turned into a military hospital. The possibility of working in that building had been one of the reasons Smoluchowski had decided to move to Kraków. Smoluchowski was now forced to work in the apartment of the late Professor Karol Olszewski. During his lectures in experimental physics, use of even the simplest demonstration equipment was virtually impossible.

Smoluchowski lectured in experimental physics; his students included Józef Patkowski, Stanisław Loria and Wacław Dziewulski.

Smoluchowski was a member of the Copernicus Society of Natural Scientists and the Polish Academy of Sciences and Letters.
Smoluchowski died in Kraków in 1917, as a result of a dysentery epidemic. Professor Władysław Natanson wrote in an obituary of Smoluchowski: &quot;With great pleasure I recall the charm of his life, his noble cordiality, combined with exquisite kindness. I wish I could render the curious appeal of his personality, recall how temperate he was, how modest and elegantly diffident, yet always full of a pure, spontaneous joy.&quot;

==Work==
Smoluchowski conducted fundamental research on the kinetic theory of matter. In 1904 he discovered density fluctuations in the gas phase, and in 1908 he was the first physicist to ascribe the phenomenon of critical opalescence to large density fluctuations. His investigations explained the blue color of the sky as a consequence of light scattering in the atmosphere.

In 1906, shortly after Albert Einstein, he independently explained Brownian motion.
Smoluchowski presented an equation, known as the Smoluchowski equation, which became a basis for the theory of stochastic processes. It describes the time evolution of the probability density function for a particle undergoing Brownian motion under the influence of external forces and diffusion. Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar described it as &quot;one of the most outstanding achievements in molecular physics&quot;.

In 1916, he proposed the equation for diffusion in an external potential field. This equation bears his name.

==Personal life==
In 1901, he had married Zofia Baraniecka (1881-1959), the daughter of Jagiellonian University Professor Marian Baraniecki. They had two children, Aldona Smoluchowska (1902–84) and Roman Smoluchowski (1910-96). Roman became a notable physicist who worked in Poland, and after World War II settled in the United States (the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton).

His non-professional interests included skiing, mountain climbing in the Alps and the Tatra Mountains, watercolor painting, and playing the piano.

==Awards and recognition==

In 1901, he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Glasgow. In 1908, he was awarded the Haitinger Prize of the Austrian Academy of Sciences for his theoretical explanation of Brownian motion. In 1913, he was the Wolfskehl Foundation lecturer at Göttingen. In 1936, he was posthumously awarded the Commander&#x27;s Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta.

In 1965, the Polish Physical Society established the Marian Smoluchowski Medal, an international award for significant achievements in the field of physics in recognition of Smoluchowski&#x27;s contributions to science.

In 1970, the International Astronomical Union named one of the craters on the Moon &quot;Smoluchowski&quot; after the Polish physicist.

The Institute of Physics of the Jagiellonian University bears the name of Smoluchowski in honour of the scientist.

Streets in several Polish cities bear the name of Smoluchowski including in Gdańsk, Lublin, Malbork, Kraków, Poznań and Wrocław.

In 2017, the Senate of Poland passed a special resolution on the 100th anniversary of Smoluchowski&#x27;s death establishing 2017 as the &quot;Year of Marian Smoluchowski&quot;.

Physicist Andrzej Kajetan Wróblewski named Smoluchowski among the greatest Polish physicists of the 20th century alongside Marie Curie, Karol Olszewski, Jerzy Pniewski and Marian Danysz.

In 2022, Jan Grzanka published a book &quot;Zapomniany geniusz fizyki: rzecz o Marianie Smoluchowskim&quot; (The Forgotten Physics Genius: Marian Smoluchowski) devoted to the life and scientific work of Smoluchowski.

<doc id="1027814" wikidata="Q1328632" url="?curid=1027814" title="Ritsuko Okazaki">
<text>was a Japanese singer-songwriter born on Hashima Island, Nagasaki Prefecture. She first made her professional debut with the single, &quot;Kanashii Jiyū / Koi ga, Kiete Yuku&quot;. She is also known as the Shelby Flint of Japan.

==Biography==
===Early life===

Okazaki was born in Hashima Island, Nagasaki Prefecture on December 29, 1959. She was born left-handed. During her childhood, she was forced by her mother to use her right hand. However, after hearing that it was bad to force her to use her right hand, her mother quickly advised her to use her natural hand. During her school days, she spent time in the bakery where she worked part-time, and practiced with her band, &quot;Eleanor&quot;. She was then in charge of the chorus and piano.

===Career===
Okazaki made her debut as a singer-songwriter in 1993. During the nineties, she continued singing and also wrote songs for various voice actors. As she became more involved with anime she composed songs for &quot;Wedding Peach&quot;, &quot;Fruits Basket&quot;, &quot;Princess Tutu&quot;, &quot;Symphonic Rain&quot;, and &quot;Love Hina&quot;. She formed the duo Melocure in 2002 with singer-songwriter Megumi Hinata.

In the following two years, the duo released several singles and an album, &quot;Melodic Hard Cure&quot;. Okazaki also produced songs during these years for artists such as Megumi Hayashibara, Mayumi Iizuka, and Yui Horie. According to her fans, the lyrics of Okazaki&#x27;s songs are characterized by poetic imagery, depth of emotion, gentle optimism and simplicity.

===Death===
She was diagnosed with stomach cancer in 2003 but still continued with her work. During this time there was little information released about her. The news was revealed to the public in the liner notes of the CD soundtrack re-release of the visual novel &quot;Symphonic Rain&quot;, which was released a year after her death.

On May 5, 2004, Okazaki died suddenly at the age of 44 from septic shock as a result of sepsis. She was unable to speak any last words, and left her work unfinished.

<text>The secondary mandate is a proposed system for indirectly electing the UK parliament&#x27;s second chamber, as espoused by singer-songwriter-activist Billy Bragg.

The Secondary Mandate works by counting up the first past the post General Election votes by party at a regional level, and then distributing each party a number of seats roughly proportionately, through closed list proportional representation.

The system has attracted support from a number of Government ministers including Peter Hain and Lord Falconer of Thoroton. It has however been criticised for being little more than a system of appointment as the closed list system it uses puts too much power into the hands of the political parties themselves. It also greatly disadvantages smaller parties who may not field candidates in all constituency seats.

<text>The Guatemala national football team () represents Guatemala in men&#x27;s international football and is controlled by the &quot;Federación Nacional de Fútbol de Guatemala&quot;. Founded in 1919, it has been affiliated to FIFA since 1946, as a member of CONCACAF.

The team has made three Olympic tournament appearances, competing at the 1968, 1976, and 1988 Olympic Games. Guatemala have yet to qualify for the finals tournament of the World Cup, although they have reached the final round of qualification on four occasions.

Guatemala won the 1967 CONCACAF Championship and the 2001 UNCAF Nations Cup. The team&#x27;s best performance in a CONCACAF Gold Cup was in 1996, when they finished fourth. More recently, the team almost beat their best at the 2023 Gold Cup in fifth place. Guatemala has also earned a bronze medal at the 1983 Pan American Games in Caracas, Venezuela. The national team kits are supplied by Umbro, which in the past have been supplied by Atletica, Adidas and Puma. Since the 2000s, Guatemala&#x27;s home kit have featured a light blue sash on a white shirt.

==History==

===Beginnings===

Guatemala created its first football team, made up of 22 players, on 23 August 1902. The team was split into two sides, blue and white. With time, clubs were made and eventually the Guatemala national team, nicknamed &quot;la Azul y Blanco&quot; (the blue and white), was created in 1921. Guatemala had its first game on 16 September 1921, in the Independence Centenary Games held in Guatemala City, against Honduras. Guatemala beat Honduras 9–0. In the final, Guatemala were defeated 6–0 by Costa Rica.

Guatemala had success in several editions of the CCCF Championship, the precursor of the Gold Cup, by being the runners-up in 1943, 1946, and 1948. In 1958, Guatemala began participating in the qualifying rounds of the World Cup. They finished last, without a point, in a group with Costa Rica and the Netherlands Antilles.

===Success in the 1960s===
Guatemala&#x27;s performance in the World Cup qualifying rounds began to improve in the 1960s. In 1962 they drew against both Costa Rica (4–4) and Honduras (1–1). However they again finished last in their qualifying group.

Guatemala did not participate in the qualifying round in 1966, as FIFA refused their participation for administrative reasons.

Guatemala joined CONCACAF in 1961. In 1967, they again showed the progress they had made when by participating by winning the Gold Cup for the only time in their history. In that tournament, hosted by Honduras, Guatemala began with a 2–1 win against Haiti, followed by a 1–0 win over the defending champions, Mexico, a 0–0 draw against Honduras, a 2–0 win over Trinidad and Tobago, and a 2–0 win over Nicaragua. The forward Manuel &quot;Escopeta&quot; Recinos was Guatemala&#x27;s top scorer with four goals, including the goal against Mexico.

Guatemala were also the runners-up in the CONCACAF Championship in 1965 and 1969.

Results
In 1967, Guatemala showed further progress by qualifying for the 1968 Olympic football tournament in Mexico City. In the first round, they won 1–0 against Czechoslovakia, and 4–1 against Thailand, and lost to Bulgaria 2–1. They went on the next round, where they lost 1–0 to the eventual champions, Hungary.

===2006 World Cup===
Before the 2006 World Cup qualifiers, Carlos Ruiz was the main focus in providing goals for the national team along with Juan Carlos Plata. Many other stars such as Fredy Garcia, Gonzalo Romero, Guillermo Ramirez, and Martin Machón were expected to play huge roles as well. In the 2006 World Cup qualifying, Guatemala advanced to the third round by beating Suriname 4–2. There they finished second in Group B, behind Costa Rica, with 10 points each. In the fourth round they started with a 0–0 draw against Panama and a 5–1 win against Trinidad and Tobago. Then followed a 2–0 loss against the United States and Mexico and a 3–2 loss against Costa Rica, and a 2–1 win against Panama. They lost against Trinidad and Tobago 3–2, drew against the United States 0–0 and then lost to Mexico 5–2. Guatemala had 8 points with one game left, and a win alongside a Trinidad and Tobago defeat against Mexico would send them into the play-offs. They won 3–1 against Costa Rica but Trinidad and Tobago beat Mexico 2–1. They finished in fifth place, two points away from the play-off spot. Juan Carlos Plata and Martin Machón announced their retirement from International Football in 2006.

===2010 World Cup===
After a third-place finish at the 2007 UNCAF Nations Cup, and reaching the knockout stage in the Gold Cup of the same year, along with a couple of satisfying friendly matches, including a 3–2 win against Mexico, Hernán Darío Gómez was to be the next coach to lead Guatemala into the Hexagonal in the World Cup qualifying stage. However, after losing 5–0 in early 2008 against the under-23 Argentine team, the Colombian soon departed. During 2010 World Cup qualifying, expectations of qualifying for the finals were set among the national team as Ramon Maradiaga returned as coach. They began well by advancing to the third round by defeating Saint Lucia 9–1 on aggregate.

In the third round, Guatemala began with a 1–0 home loss to the United States, with controversies surrounding the Panamanian referee Roberto Moreno, including not awarding a penalty to Guatemala in the first half after a handball from Steve Cherundolo, as well as Gustavo Cabrera being sent off after colliding with Eddie Lewis in the second half. In their second match, &quot;Los Chapines&quot; salvaged a draw in the closing minutes of the game against Trinidad and Tobago in Port of Spain after Carlos Gallardo deflected a free kick by Marco Pappa. On 10 September, Cuba shocked the Guatemalan supporters by taking the lead after Roberto Linares scored in the 25th minute, but by half-time, Carlos Ruiz had equalised, and in the second half, Ruiz scored again. Mario Rodríguez and José Manuel Contreras also scored and Guatemala won 4–1.

On 11 October, many fans gathered around the Estadio Mateo Flores for the game against Trinidad and Tobago. Despite being reduced to 10 men, the Soca Warriors were able to hold Guatemala to a 0–0 stalemate. Guatemala then lost in Cuba, falling behind 1–0 after Jaime Colome scored a penalty. Marco Pappa volleyed in an equalizer in the 80th minute, but Urgelles won the match for Cuba in the 90th minute. Meanwhile, the Trinidadians defeated the United States 2–1 at home, putting them in second place. Maradiaga was fired and Benjamin Monterroso was appointed, focusing on the Copa UNCAF the following January. A 2–0 away loss against the United States confirmed the elimination of the national team from the World Cup.

At the UNCAF nations cup, Monterroso wanted to introduce more youthful players into the starting line up such as Minor Lopez, Ricardo Jerez and Wilson Lalin, but Guatemala lost both group stage matches against Costa Rica and also lost 2–0 to Nicaragua in the play-off match for the final berth to attend the next Gold Cup; Minor Lopez was the lone goal scorer for Los Bicolores. As a result, the national team were inactive for the next two years and Monterroso stepped down after two months in charge.

===2014 World Cup===
In May 2010, the Uruguayan-born Paraguayan Ever Hugo Almeida was appointed as the Guatemala&#x27;s next coach. At the 2011 Copa Centroamericana, formerly known as the &quot;UNCAF Nations Cup&quot;, Guatemala finished in fifth place, losing 2–0 to Costa Rica and 3–1 Honduras before defeating Nicaragua 2–1 to qualify for the 2011 Gold Cup.

At the Gold Cup, Guatemala drew 0–0 against Honduras despite being reduced to nine men. They lost against a physically superior Jamaica 2–0, but managed to redeem themselves by beating Grenada 4–0, with goals from José Javier del Águila, Marco Pappa, Carlos Ruiz, and Carlos Gallardo. In the quarter-finals, they lost to 2–1 the reigning champions Mexico, after Ruiz had given them the lead in the first half.

For the 2014 World Cup qualifiers, Guatemala began in the second round with six wins in six games, advancing to a third round group alongside the United States, Jamaica and Antigua and Barbuda. Before the third round, three key players – Guillermo Ramirez, Gustavo Cabrera and Yony Flores – were sent home during a practice session after their team-mates Ruiz and Luis Rodriguez heard of their involvement in money laundering and bribery in fixing multiple fixtures; they were subsequently banned for life.

The team began with an away loss to Jamaica, with Dwight Pezzarossi only managing to pull back one goal in stoppage time. In the next match, Guatemala drew at home against the United States, with Marco Pappa&#x27;s free kick salvaging a draw for the Guatemalans. At home against Antigua and Barbuda, Guatemala again fell behind, but after the Antiguan goalkeeper Molvin James was sent off for wasting time, Ruiz scored a brace and a goal from Pezzarossi sealed a 3–1 victory. Four days later, a goal from Ruiz sufficed for an away win against the same opponents in North Sound.

Guatemala beat Jamaica at home 2–1, leaving them needing a draw against the United States to progress to the final stage of the qualifiers. After they took the lead in the first five minutes thanks to Ruiz, the United States scored three unanswered goals, and Guatemala finished behind Jamaica on goal difference.

In January 2013, still led by Almeida, Guatemala participated in the 2013 Copa Centroamericana. With a team of mainly younger players, they could only manage three draws in their group play (1–1 against Nicaragua, 0–0 against Belize and 1–1 against Costa Rica), losing out to Belize for direct qualification for the 2013 Gold Cup. They faced Panama in the fifth place match, but lost 3–1, and Almeida stepped down in favour of the technical director, Victor Hugo Monzón.

====Group E====
====Third Round (Group A)====
===2016 FIFA suspension===
On 28 October 2016, the Guatemalan football federation was suspended indefinitely by FIFA, after the international football governing body had appointed an oversight committee to look into allegations of corruption. FIFA stated that the Guatemalan federation (FEDEFUT) had rejected the committee&#x27;s mandate to run FEDEFUT&#x27;s business, organize elections, and modernize its statutes, and would remain barred from international competition until FEDEFUT ratified an extension of the mandate.
The football team missed their chance on qualifying on the 2017 and 2019 CONCACAF Gold Cup tournaments (2017 Copa Centroamericana and 2019–20 CONCACAF Nations League qualifying) as they missed deadlines to have their suspension lifted.

The suspension was lifted on 31 May 2018 after FEDEFUT&#x27;s normalization committee became fully operational.

===2018 World Cup===
After their FIFA suspension, Guatemala resumed normal operations and went through World Cup Qualification. They did not advance beyond qualification for the 2018 FIFA World Cup. Guatemala drew in the first leg against Bermuda, and won 1-0 in the second. After a loss of 0-1 to Antigua and Barbuda in the first leg, they won 2-0 in the second leg. Overall, they placed 3rd in their table and failed to advance further.
===2022 World Cup===
Between 2018-2022, Guatemala had mixed results in their international meetings, losing 0-3 to intracontinental neighbors, Mexico, and 0-2 to Panama. However, they did beat Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, French Guiana, and El Salvador by large margins, those being 10-0, 2-0, and 4-0 respectively.

Before qualification, they had lost twice, drawn once and won only 3 of 6 matches in early 2020 before 2022 World Cup qualification.

Guatemala did not advance beyond qualification for the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Guatemala won 1-0 against Cuba with a goal from Luis Martinez in the 60th minute. They then won 0-3 against British Virgin Islands. Guatemala then scored 10 goals by 10 different players against Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. They drawed 0-0 against Curaçao, leading to Curaçao and Guatemala being drawn with 10 points each in the table, and Curaçao went on to the next round of qualification due to having more goals scored, thus eliminating Guatemala from further eliminatory matches in qualification.
===Road to 2026 World Cup===
Guatemala had a historic run in the 2023 CONCACAF Gold Cup, topping Group D, where they beat Cuba 1-0, drew against Canada, and won 2-3 in their final group stage game against Guadeloupe. They lost in the quarter-finals against Jamaica with a 0-1 score. They ended in fifth place at the tournament. In the following tournament, the 2023-24 CONCACAF Nations League, Guatemala finished 4th in Group A of League A, finishing below Martinique and Panama. They only won 1 of 4 matchdays with a 2-0 win against El Salvador, losing against Trinidad and Tobago and Panama.

At the beginning of 2024, Guatemala played a friendly against European national team Iceland, where they lost 0-1 in a late winner by Ísak Þorvaldsson in the 79th minute. In March, they played against South American national team Ecuador, losing 2-0 from an early 8th minute goal by John Yeboah and a late finisher 86th minute goal by Gonzalo Plata. Guatemala were winless in their first four national fixtures of 2024.
Guatemala saw victories during the 2026 FIFA World Cup Qualification, in their first 2 games. They lifted strong score lines, winning 6-0 against Dominica and 0-3 against the British Virgin Islands. In June, Guatemala played against 2022 FIFA World Cup champions Argentina, losing 4-1 with their only goal being by Lisandro Martinez, who scored an own goal in the fourth minute after a Guatemalan freekick. It is the first and only goal Guatemala has ever scored against Argentina. Nicholas Hagen recorded 6 saves against Argentina, with 5 being in the penalty box. Hagen saved an attempted bicycle kick from Ángel Di María, preventing an Argentinian goal.

==Home stadium==
The Estadio Nacional Mateo Flores, also known as Coloso de la Zona 5, is a multi-use national stadium in Guatemala City, the largest in Guatemala. It was built in 1948, to host the Central American and Caribbean Games in 1950, and was renamed after long-distance runner Mateo Flores, winner of the 1952 Boston Marathon. It has a capacity of 26,000 seats.

Used mostly for football matches, the stadium has hosted the majority of the home matches of the Guatemala national football team throughout its entire history. Its highest record attendance was of 82,000 during the 1950 Central American and Caribbean Games.

<text>Wojciech Alojzy Świętosławski (: ; 1881–1968) was a Polish physical chemist, who is considered the &quot;father of modern thermochemistry&quot;. He developed a static method of cryometric measurement and a new method of testing coal. Świętosławski was vice-chairman of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) and created the foundations for a new branch of physical chemistry: polyazeotropy. In 1933 he became a member of the Temporary Advisory and Scientific Committee.

== Early years ==
Świętosławski was born on 21 June 1881 in the village of Kiryjówka, Volhynia Governorate, Russian Empire. He spent his early years in Kiev, where he graduated from high school (1899). In 1906, he graduated with an engineering degree at Chemistry Department of Kiev Technical University. His first research paper, &quot;Thermochemical Analysis of Organic Compounds&quot; was published in 1908, in &quot;Polish Yearly Magazine (&quot;Rocznik Polski&quot;). In appreciation of his work, Świętosławski was awarded the Mendeleyev Award by Russian Scientific Association. In the 1910s, Świętosławski went to Moscow, where he took a job at Chemical Laboratory of Moscow University. In 1917 he completed his thesis, writing about oxymes.

In the mid-, and late 1910, Świętosławski remained in Moscow, working, among others, on Aromatic hydrocarbon, Nitric acid, Nitro compound, Amine, and burning in bomb calorimeters.

== Interwar Poland ==
In 1918 Świętosławski returned to Poland, leaving his laboratory in Moscow and urging other highly qualified Polish scientists to follow him. In 1919, he was named Professor of Physical Chemistry at Warsaw University of Technology, and returned to scientific research, working on enthalpy of vaporization. In 1920, at the Conference of International Chemical Union in Rome, he made a motion to accept benzoic acid as an international standard of marking the bomb calorimeters. In 1922, his motion was accepted, and Świętosławski was named head of the Thermochemical Data Commission, which coordinated research on marking the heat of combustion.

In the early 1920s, Świętosławski developed a new direction in the calorimetrical research, which he called microcalorimetry. He constructed microcalorimeters, which worked in isometric and adiabatic conditions as well as microcalomieters based on partial heat exchange with the surroundings. Due to his research, it became possible, among others, to mark the value of radiation of uranium aperture. Later on, he worked on measuring of Vapor pressure and boiling temperature. Furthermore, he constructed the ebulliometer.

In 1928, Świętosławski was named deputy chairman of International Chemical Union. In 1934 he was appointed chairman of Commission of Physical-Chemical Data. At the same time, he held the post of dean of Warsaw University of Technology. He also was chairman of Polish Chemical Association (1925 - 1926), wrote for &quot;Chemical Annual&quot;, was a member of Warsaw Scientific Society, Polish Academy of Learning, Academy of Technical Sciences, and Temporary Advisory and Scientific Committee.

From November 1935 until 1939, Świętosławski was Minister of Religious Denominations and Public Enlightenment in the governments of Marian Zyndram-Kościałkowski and Felicjan Sławoj Składkowski. Also, in 1935 - 1939, he was a member of the Polish Senate.

== World War II ==
After the outbreak of World War II, Świętosławski left Poland for the United States, where he remained until the end of the war. He worked at the University of Pittsburgh, and was a Senior Fellow at the Carnegie Mellon Institute of Industrial Research. He also wrote three monographies of Polish science in the English language, contributing to popularization of Polish scientific achievements in the USA.

== After the War ==
In 1946 Świętosławski returned to Poland. He re-created Physical Chemistry Department at the Warsaw University, also returned to work at the Warsaw University of Technology. Upon the creation of Polish Academy of Sciences he became the manager of Department of Physical Chemistry of Organic Raw Materials. Furthermore, he wrote several scientific papers, and continued working until 1960. Twice nominated to the Nobel Prize, he received a number of important Polish and international awards and was named doctor honoris causa of eight Polish universities.

Wojciech Świętosławski died in Warsaw on 29 April 1968 and was buried at the Powązki Cemetery in Warsaw.

In 2013, a monument dedicated to Świętosławski was officially unveiled at the Kyiv Polytechnic Institute where he used to study.

<doc id="1027838" wikidata="Q1544697" url="?curid=1027838" title="Octopussy and The Living Daylights">
<text>Octopussy and The Living Daylights (sometimes published as Octopussy) is the fourteenth and final James Bond book written by Ian Fleming. The book is a collection of short stories published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape on 23 June 1966, after Fleming&#x27;s death in August 1964.

The book originally contained two stories, &quot;Octopussy&quot; and &quot;The Living Daylights&quot;; subsequent editions also included &quot;The Property of a Lady&quot; and then &quot;007 in New York&quot;. The stories first appeared in different publications: &quot;Octopussy&quot; was serialised in the &quot;Daily Express&quot; in October 1965; &quot;The Living Daylights&quot; appeared in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; colour supplement on 4 February 1962; &quot;The Property of a Lady&quot; was commissioned by Sotheby&#x27;s for the 1963 edition of their journal, &quot;The Ivory Hammer&quot;; and &quot;007 in New York&quot; appeared in the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; in October 1963.

Many of the elements of the stories are from Fleming&#x27;s own interests and experiences, including climbing in Kitzbühel, Austria, wartime commando deeds and the sea-life of Jamaica. He used the names of friends and acquaintances for characters within the stories and also used a recipe for scrambled eggs given to him by a friend.

The two original stories, &quot;Octopussy&quot; and &quot;The Living Daylights&quot;, were adapted for publication in comic strip format in the &quot;Daily Express&quot; in 1966–1967. Elements from the stories have also been used in the Eon Productions Bond films. &quot;Octopussy&quot;, starring Roger Moore as James Bond, was released in 1983 as the thirteenth film in the series and Fleming&#x27;s story provided the background for the film character Octopussy; &quot;The Property of a Lady&quot; was closely adapted for an auction sequence in the film. &quot;The Living Daylights&quot;, released in 1987, is the fifteenth Bond film produced by Eon and stars Timothy Dalton in his first appearance as Bond. &quot;007 in New York&quot; provided character and plot elements for the first two films starring Daniel Craig as Bond, &quot;Casino Royale&quot; and &quot;Quantum of Solace&quot;.

==Plots==
===&quot;Octopussy&quot; ===
The Secret Service operative James Bond travels to Jamaica to interview Major Dexter Smythe, a former Royal Marine officer implicated in the murder of Franz Oberhauser, an Austrian mountain guide, and the theft of a cache of Nazi gold estimated to be £40-50,000. Bond appears only briefly in this story, which is mostly told from the perspective of Smythe. Smythe remained in Kitzbühel, Austria, after the war, found the gold with the help of Oberhauser and killed him. Bond was put on the case after the guide&#x27;s body fell out of a glacier over fifteen years after the murder; Oberhauser had been Bond&#x27;s skiing instructor and, as Bond describes it, &quot;something of a father to me at a time when I happened to need one&quot;.

Bond chooses not to take Smythe into custody immediately, but leaves him to contemplate his options: suicide or a court martial. While hunting for a scorpion fish to feed Octopussy—an octopus that lives offshore of his beach—Smythe is stung by the fish. When he goes to feed Octopussy, he is dragged underwater by it as the poison sets in. Bond views the death as a suicide, but classifies it as an accidental drowning to spare Smythe&#x27;s reputation.

===&quot;The Living Daylights&quot; ===
Bond is assigned sniper duty to help a British agent—code number 272—escape from East Berlin. Bond&#x27;s duty is to safeguard his crossing into West Berlin by eliminating a top KGB assassin codenamed &quot;Trigger&quot;, who has been dispatched to kill 272. Bond takes up a position on the western edge of the border, in a hotel overlooking the no-man&#x27;s land that 272 will have to cross. On each of three nights, he sees a female orchestra arrive for rehearsal and leave, and he takes particular notice of a beautiful blonde cellist. Once 272 starts to cross the border, Bond sees Trigger get in position to kill him and he realises that she is the cellist. He adjusts his aim at the last moment and shoots her weapon instead of killing her, allowing 272 to reach safety.

===&quot;The Property of a Lady&quot; ===
The Secret Service learns that Maria Freudenstein, one of their employees known to be a double agent working for the Soviet Union, has just received a valuable item of jewellery crafted by Peter Carl Fabergé and is planning to auction it at Sotheby&#x27;s. Bond suspects that the resident director of the KGB in London will attend the auction and underbid for the item to drive the price up to the value needed to pay Freudenstein for her services. Bond attends the auction, spots the man, and leaves to make arrangements for his expulsion from London as &quot;persona non grata&quot;.

===&quot;007 in New York&quot; ===
A brief tale in which Bond muses about New York. He is on a quick mission to the city to warn a female MI6 employee that her new boyfriend is a KGB agent. It includes reference to Solange, a young lady of Bond&#x27;s intimate acquaintance who works in Abercrombie&#x27;s; it also includes Fleming&#x27;s recipe for &quot;scrambled eggs &#x27;James Bond&#x27;&quot;.

==Background and writing history==
By the time Fleming died of a heart attack on 12 August 1964, he had published eleven novels and one short story in his &quot;James Bond&quot; series. Eight months later his twelfth and final novel, &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot;, was published. The rights to his works were held by the Fleming family-owned Glidrose Productions (now Ian Fleming Publications) and the company decided that two short stories, &quot;Octopussy&quot; and &quot;The Living Daylights&quot;, would be published in 1966.
In July 1962 Fleming was in the midst of marital troubles with his wife, Ann. While in New York he sent her a telegram saying that he needed &quot;time to rest and reflect on our future which at present looks intolerable&quot;, and travelled to his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica. While there, he wrote &quot;Octopussy&quot;. The story has Bond as catalyst for a narrative told in flashback, rather than as the main character for action; as such, it is told in the manner of &quot;Quantum of Solace&quot;, a short story first published in 1959 and then included in the collection &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot;. &quot;Octopussy&quot; was serialised in the &quot;Daily Express&quot; from 4–8 October 1965.
&quot;The Sunday Times&quot; decided to launch a colour magazine, to start on 4 February 1962, and asked Fleming—one of their columnists—to write an article for it. He wrote a piece titled &quot;The Guns of James Bond&quot;, but this was rejected as being too long and specialised for the target audience; accordingly, he wrote the story of Bond as a sniper. As background research to the story, he corresponded with Captain Le Mesurier, the secretary of the British National Rifle Association at Bisley for information, and to correct some of the more specialist areas of knowledge required for sniper shooting. Fleming originally titled the story &quot;Trigger Finger&quot;, although it was published under the title of &quot;Berlin Escape&quot;. It was also published in the June 1962 issue of the American magazine &quot;Argosy&quot; under the same name. For &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, Fleming had commissioned Graham Sutherland to undertake the artwork to accompany the piece, at a cost of 100 guineas, although the artwork was not used in the published edition.

&quot;Property of a Lady&quot;, which was written in early 1963, was commissioned by Sotheby&#x27;s for use in their annual journal, &quot;The Ivory Hammer&quot;, and published in November 1963. The Sotheby&#x27;s chairman Peter Wilson is mentioned by name in the story. Fleming was so unhappy with the final piece, he wrote to Wilson and refused payment for something he considered so lacklustre. Fleming&#x27;s original names for the piece were &quot;The Diamond Egg&quot; and &quot;The Fabulous Pay-Off&quot;.
In 1959 Fleming was commissioned by &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; to travel around the world and write a series of articles based on world cities, the material for which later was collected into a book entitled &quot;Thrilling Cities&quot;. Although he liked New York, his experiences on the trip soured his view of the city, and he wrote: &quot;Go into the first drugstore, ask your way from a passer-by, and the indifference and harshness of the New Yorker cuts the old affection for the city out of your body as sharply as a surgeon&#x27;s knife.&quot; Because of his harshness toward the city, his American publishers asked him to modify the chapter; Fleming refused. By way of recompense, in August 1963 he wrote a short story from the point of view of Bond. &quot;007 in New York&quot; was originally titled &quot;Reflections in a Carey Cadillac&quot;. The story was first published in the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; in October 1963 as &quot;Agent 007 in New York&quot;, but was subsequently renamed as &quot;007 in New York&quot; for the 1964 US editions of &quot;Thrilling Cities&quot;.
Although Fleming did not date the events within his novels, John Griswold and Henry Chancellor—both of whom wrote books for Ian Fleming Publications—have identified timelines based on episodes and situations within the novel series as a whole. Chancellor puts the events of &quot;The Living Daylights&quot; in October 1959; &quot;Octopussy&quot; in 1960; &quot;007 in New York&quot; in early 1961; and &quot;The Property of a Lady&quot; in June 1961. Griswold differs and considers &quot;Octopussy&quot; to have taken place in July 1960; &quot;The Living Daylights&quot; at the end of September to the beginning of October 1960; &quot;The Property of a Lady&quot; in June 1961; and &quot;007 in New York&quot; at the end of September 1961.

==Development==

===Inspirations===

Fleming&#x27;s biographer Andrew Lycett and Chancellor consider that much of the background of &quot;Octopussy&quot; is directly from Fleming&#x27;s own interests and experiences, including wartime commando deeds, climbing in Kitzbühel, hidden gold and the sea-life of Jamaica. Fleming had often hiked and skied in Kitzbühel in the late 1920s, while he was attending a small private school to study for entry into the Foreign Office. He knew the area well and his experiences were used as the part of the story where Smythe hunted for the gold. Fleming had an interest in octopuses and observed one—which he named &quot;Pussy&quot;—regularly while diving at his beach at Goldeneye; he wrote an article about the animal for &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; in 1957, &quot;My Friend the Octopus&quot;. One of Fleming&#x27;s neighbours in Jamaica, and later his lover, was the heiress Blanche Blackwell. She had given Fleming a coracle, which he named &quot;Octopussy&quot;; he then used the name for the story. Smythe&#x27;s wartime unit, the &quot;Miscellaneous Objectives Bureau&quot;, was a fictional version of Fleming&#x27;s 30 AU unit. Fleming had a long-standing interest in hidden gold and was involved in the commissioning of an article for &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; about Nazi gold that had supposedly been dumped in Lake Toplitz, Austria.
Part of the background to the plot of &quot;The Living Daylights&quot; included using the noise of the orchestra to cover the crossing over no-man&#x27;s land. This was inspired by Pat Reid&#x27;s escape from Colditz prisoner-of-war camp, during which two escapers ran across a courtyard under the cover of the noise from an orchestra. The conductor of the Colditz orchestra was Douglas Bader, who played golf with Fleming on several occasions. The assassin, Trigger, was partly based on Amaryllis, Fleming&#x27;s half-sister. She was a concert cellist with blonde hair, and Fleming managed to get a passing reference to her in the story, saying: &quot;Of course Suggia had managed to look elegant, as did that girl Amaryllis somebody.&quot; Fleming used the surname of one of his acquaintances—the wartime head of MI6, Sir Stewart Menzies—for Corporal Menzies, who aids Bond during his rifle practice at the start of the story.

Fleming was a lover of scrambled eggs and included in &quot;007 in New York&quot; a recipe for the dish. This originally came which came from May Maxwell, the housekeeper of Fleming&#x27;s friend Ivar Bryce. Fleming also used her name for Bond&#x27;s own housekeeper, May.

===Characters===

According to Matthew Parker and Jon Gilbert, respectively a biographer and a bibliographer of Fleming, Smythe is a semi-autobiographical portrayal of Fleming, although Chancellor thinks it likely that the character &quot;is so well drawn that he sounds like a neighbour or friend&quot;. Both Parker and Gilbert highlight that both Fleming and Smythe were ex-military men, previously fit and active, but now suffering from heart problems (including suffering a heart attack); lived on a Jamaican beach, where they drank and smoked heavily; and had been involved in capturing German units at the war&#x27;s end. The sociologist Anthony Synnott, in his examination of aesthetics in the Bond books, observes that Smythe is one of only two British villains in the canon, along with Vesper Lynd (from the 1953 novel &quot;Casino Royale&quot;); both characters die at the end of their stories.
Raymond Benson, the author of the continuation Bond novels, wrote that in &quot;The Living Daylights&quot;, Bond&#x27;s thoughts on killing are examined once again. The story shows that although Bond did not like doing it, he considered that he must kill as part of his duty to complete an assignment. Once the mission is completed, Bond having deliberately wounded but not killed the assassin, he demonstrates an attitude of complacency and shrugs off his colleague&#x27;s complaints about the incident. The historian Jeremy Black sees Bond&#x27;s colleague, the officious Captain Sender, as the antithesis of Bond and an echo of Colonel Schreiber, the head of security at Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe, who appeared in the 1960 short story &quot;From a View to a Kill&quot;.
The lady referred to in the title of &quot;Property of a Lady&quot; was Maria von Freudenstein, a traitor within the Secret Service who thought she was sending high-grade intelligence to the KGB, but was unknowingly passing low-level information and some misinformation instead. She is described as 

an unattractive girl with a pale, rather pimply skin, black hair and a vaguely unwashed appearance. Such a girl would be unloved, make few friends, have chips on her shoulder ... Perhaps her only pleasure in life was the triumphant secret she harboured in that flattish bosom.

Synnott sees this as another example of Fleming&#x27;s use of using physical unattractiveness as a shorthand method of indicating evil or criminality. Black observes that the suggestion that her ugliness has caused her treachery means there is no place for ideology in her actions. Black sees that Fleming&#x27;s description of Piotr Malinowski, the KGB agent at the auction, also shows the same pattern of equating unattractive physical features with criminality. The KGB man is described thus:

The hair grew low down on the back of the man&#x27;s rather squat neck and the lobes of his ears were pinched in close to his head. He had a slight hump, perhaps only a bone deformation, high up on his back.

==Style==

Within the &quot;James Bond&quot; series, Benson identifies what he described as the &quot;Fleming Sweep&quot;, the use of &quot;hooks&quot; at the end of chapters to heighten tension and pull the reader into the next. In &quot;Octopussy&quot; he sees the hooks being used to keep the pace of the story moving, despite there being no passages of action. The story, which he considers a morality tale, uses the flashback technique that Fleming liked.
The Fleming Sweep is also present in &quot;The Living Daylights&quot;, which Benson considers &quot;compressed and intensely written&quot;. He considers that Fleming&#x27;s rich use of detail makes some scenes vivid; these are identified as scenes of the range at Bisley, Berlin and the attempted shooting of the British agent.

==Release and reception==
===Publication history===
&quot;Octopussy and The Living Daylights&quot; was published in Britain on 23 June 1966 by Jonathan Cape and cost 10s.6d. The hardback edition of the book contained only the two stories mentioned in the title. As he had done for many of Fleming&#x27;s other &quot;Bond&quot; novels, the artist Richard Chopping provided the cover art; his fee rose from 300 to 350 guineas. The first edition had a print run of approximately 45,000. It sold slowly and the first edition was still being sold when the UK decimalised its currency in February 1971, meaning Jonathan Cape put stickers over the pre-decimal price. The book was published in US in mid 1966 by New American Library with illustrations from Paul Bacon.

&quot;Octopussy and The Living Daylights&quot; was published in paperback form in the UK by Pan Books in July 1967; &quot;The Property of a Lady&quot; was also added, although the book&#x27;s title remained unchanged. The book sold 79,000 copies in the UK that year and 362,000 in 1968; overseas sales for 1967 were more than 76,000. By 2002 &quot;007 in New York&quot; had been added to the book by Viking Press.

===Reviews===
The poet Philip Larkin wrote in &quot;The Spectator&quot; that although he found the two stories of the first edition to be &quot;full of shading and nuance&quot;, he was &quot;not surprised that Fleming preferred to write novels. James Bond, unlike Sherlock Holmes, does not fit snugly into the short-story length: there is something grandiose and intercontinental about his adventures that require elbow room and such examples of the form as we have tend to be eccentric or muted. These are no exception.&quot; The critic for &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; thought the stories were predictable, but praised the descriptions of ballistics and sea-life. Writing in &quot;The Listener&quot;, the writer Anthony Burgess thought that &quot;fascinated poring on &quot;things&quot; ... remind us that the stuff of the anti-novel needn&#x27;t necessarily spring from a thought-out aesthetic&quot;, going on to note that &quot;it is the mastery of the world that gives Fleming his peculiar literary niche&quot;.

Some reviewers wrote about the book in light of the films or other similar works: in &quot;Tatler&quot;, Carole d&#x27;Albiac described the stories as &quot;short, throwaway and inimitable&quot;, and considered &quot;that these morsels only serve to emphasise how miserably many imitators fail, and how the films don&#x27;t quite catch the flavour&quot;; the critic from &quot;The Observer&quot; felt that &quot;Both are as readable as one might expect, though some way from Fleming&#x27;s best form. Perhaps the spate of inferior imitations may make them seem rather better than they really are.&quot; Other critics reviewed the stories in the light of Fleming&#x27;s death, including George Dowson of the &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot;, who wrote &quot;Both are little gems in the best Bond tradition and illustrate just how much we lost with the death of Ian Fleming&quot;. Burgess finished his review by stating &quot;I admired all the Bond books and I&#x27;m sorry there&#x27;ll be no more. A sad farewell to Fleming&quot;.

==Adaptations and reprints==
&quot;Property of a Lady&quot; was reprinted in &quot;Playboy&quot; in January 1964; &quot;Octopussy&quot; was serialised in the March and April 1966 editions of the magazine. The artist Barry Geller used Sean Connery&#x27;s likeness for the illustrations accompanying &quot;Octopussy&quot;. Two of the short stories were adapted for publication in comic-strip format, which were published daily in the &quot;Daily Express&quot; and syndicated worldwide. &quot;The Living Daylights&quot; ran from 12 September to 12 November 1966, adapted by Jim Lawrence and illustrated by Yaroslav Horak; the same pair also worked on &quot;Octopussy&quot;, which ran from 14 November 1966 to 27 May 1967. The story lines for the strips were altered from the original Fleming version to ensure that they contained a glamorous reason for being Bond involved and to include Bond in action. The strips were reprinted by Titan Books in 1988 and then again in &quot;The James Bond Omnibus Vol. 2&quot;, published in 2011.

In 1983 Eon Productions loosely adapted elements of two of the stories, &quot;Octopussy&quot; and &quot;The Property of a Lady&quot; for the thirteenth film in their Bond series, starring Roger Moore as Bond. &quot;Octopussy&quot; provided the title of the film and the background for the character Octopussy, the daughter of a character Bond had allowed to commit suicide rather than face the shame of arrest and imprisonment. The film also used the plot device of the auctioning of a Fabergé egg at Sotheby&#x27;s from &quot;The Property of a Lady&quot;; as with the story the auction item was described as being the same &quot;property of a lady&quot;. In 1987 Eon used the plot of &quot;The Living Daylights&quot;, almost unchanged, for a section of their 1987 film of the same name. The film starred Timothy Dalton in his first role as Bond, and the character of Trigger became that of the cello player Kara Milovy. Eon used the name Solange—from &quot;007 in New York&quot;—for a character in the 2006 film &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, and in the 2008 film &quot;Quantum of Solace&quot;, the epilogue uses the premise from &quot;007 in New York&quot;—that of Bond warning a female intelligence agent that her boyfriend is an enemy agent. The character of Oberhauser was used in the 2015 film &quot;Spectre&quot;; he was adapted to be the father of Ernst Stavro Blofeld, the leader of the criminal organisation Spectre and the former legal guardian of Bond in his youth.

<text>Security Pacific National Bank (SPNB) was a large U.S. bank headquartered in Los Angeles, California. It was acquired by Bank of America in 1992.

== History ==

On September 1, 1868, Hellman, Temple and Co. opened their first bank branch in Los Angeles. The banking firm was the predecessor of Farmers and Merchants Bank (1870), which was the predecessor of Security First National Bank. The bank earned a reputation for aggressive business practices and benefited from economic and population growth in the Western United States. By the mid-20th century it had an international presence, and was ranked the fifth-largest bank in the United States and third-largest in California in terms of deposits.

In 1967, Security First National Bank bought Pacific National Bank of San Francisco and became Security Pacific National Bank.
In 1971, SPNB Security Pacific National Bank (SPNB) bought 69% of Bank of Canton.
In 1975, Security Pacific Bank constructed a 55-story tower in downtown Los Angeles, now known as Bank of America Plaza.

In 1978, computer consultant Stanley Rifkin learned the electronic codes Security Pacific used to telegraph funds to other banks. On October 25 he stole $10,200,000 from a non-existent account, executing one of the largest bank robberies in history. He used the funds to buy some 115,000 Russian diamonds in Switzerland, which he smuggled back into the United States and attempted to sell, but he was captured. Security Pacific took ownership of the diamonds but received few offers for such a large quantity. Eventually it was forced to sell them on unfavorable terms to a Liechtenstein firm affiliated with the De Beers company.

On May 9, 1980, five men robbed the Security Pacific branch in Norco, California. They were among the most heavily armed bank robbers in history, carrying semi-automatic firearms, handguns, and improvised explosive devices, and succeeded not only in stopping several patrol cars but forcing a San Bernardino police helicopter to give up pursuit. By the end of the Norco shootout, a police officer and two robbers had been killed, with the other three suspects arrested and sentenced to life in prison.

In 1984, the boards of SPNB and Bank of Canton announced that SPNB wanted to acquire the ordinary and preferred shares of the Bank of Canton it did not already own. The agreement stipulated that the management of Bank of Canton would remain in place and that Russell Fok would continue as chairman of the board. Furthermore, a company associated with Fok would be entitled, upon completion of the acquisition, to purchase a limited equity position in BoC. SPNB agreed to pay $59.31 per share for the 714,128 common shares (31%) that it did not already own for a total cost of about $42 million.

In 1985, a class action lawsuit against Security Pacific accused it of overcharging some 2,500 trust accounts going back to 1974. Also in 1985, Security Pacific acquired The Arizona Bank.

In 1986, SPNB acquired California Pacific National Bank, a small bank that primarily served Los Angeles&#x27; Chinese business community, for US$11.5 million. Earlier, BoC had revealed plans for a major expansion in the United States, concentrating on the growing Asian community in California. SPNB also entered into talks with American Asian Bank. This Chinese ethnic bank operated four branches around San Francisco and four in the Los Angeles area.

In 1987, Security Pacific acquired Rainier Bancorp, which served the Pacific Northwest.

In 1988, Security Pacific denied a job to hacker Kevin Mitnick for his failure to disclose prior convictions. Four days later, a false press release circulated stating that the bank had lost $400 million in the first quarter, hurting the bank&#x27;s share price. The Federal Bureau of Investigation attempted to use this circumstantial evidence in their case against Mitnick, but no proof of a connection was ever uncovered. Mitnick, in particular, denied the allegation in his book &quot;Ghost in the Wires&quot;, saying it was not his style, while admitting other crimes unrelated to the bank.

Also in 1988 SPNB completed the acquisition of Bank of Canton and renamed it Security Pacific Asian Bank. SPNB finally acquired American Asian Bank, controlled by individuals associated with the ailing Hong Kong–based Tung Group. (Earlier American Asian had acquired a portion of the failed American City Bank in 1983 and Toronto Dominion Bank of California in 1984).

The 1980s boom for a time sustained the bank, but its aggressive acquisition strategy, unfavorable financial engineering arrangements, and the 1990 recession and Southern California real estate crash devastated its loan portfolio and balance sheet. Banking regulators, concerned problems at Security Pacific could compound the emerging savings and loan crisis, placed the bank under heightened scrutiny.

On April 22, 1992, Security Pacific Bank merged with San Francisco–based BankAmerica (now called Bank of America), a deal that was at the time one of the largest bank mergers in history. Federal regulators, however, forced the sale of Security Pacific&#x27;s Washington subsidiary, Rainier Bank, as the combination of Seafirst and Rainier would have given BankAmerica too large a share of the market in that state. The Rainier Bank branches were divided and sold off to West One Bancorp (now U.S. Bancorp) and KeyBank. Later that year, BankAmerica expanded into Nevada by acquiring Valley Bank of Nevada.

In 1993, Bank of America changed Security Pacific Asian Bank&#x27;s name to Bank of America (Asia). In 1994 Arab-Malaysian Bank acquired Security Pacific Asian Bank operations in Malaysia.

In 2000, Robert H. Smith, Security Pacific&#x27;s last chairman and CEO, published a book called&quot; Dead Bank Walking: One Gutsy Bank&#x27;s Struggle For Survival And The Merger That Changed Banking Forever&quot;, which chronicled the merger with Bank of America.

==New Security Pacific Bank==
A new Security Pacific Bank emerged in February 2005, the result of a name change by a bank formerly known as Network Bank USA and, prior to that, Golden Pacific Bank. The new Security Pacific Bank (which failed on November 7, 2008) had no relation to Bank of America or the former Security Pacific National Bank, although it did use a similar interlocking &quot;S&quot; logo as the former bank. After its closure, it was acquired by Pacific Western Bank.

<text>Mieczysław Wolfke (29 May 1883 – 4 May 1947) was a Polish physicist, professor at the Warsaw University of Technology, the forerunner of holography and television. He discovered the method of solidification of helium as well as two types of liquid helium. He was a Masonic Grand Master of the National Grand Lodge of Poland from 1931 to 1934. He served as president of the Polish Physical Society between 1930 and 1934.

== Biography ==
Mieczysław Władysław Wolfke was born on 29 May 1883 in Łask near Łódź. His father, Karol Juliusz Wolfke, was a road engineer.

In 1892 Mieczysław and his parents moved to Częstochowa where his father became a district roadside engineer. At the age of 12, Wolfke wrote a dissertation about interplanetary travelling (especially to the Moon). It contained the theory of spaceships driven by the jet force. He also presented scientific hypotheses supported by mathematical models.

In Częstochowa Mieczysław completed five years of the gymnasium for boys. Then he continued his education in Realschule in Sosnowiec which he graduated in 1902. At the age of 17, Wolfke developed a device which he called &quot;telektroskop&quot; (telectrosope). This invention was used to send images at a distance via electromagnetic waves. It was a prototype of television and Wolfke patented it in Russia and Germany. This patent received appreciation at the exhibition of the Polytechnic Society in Lviv in 1902 and gave him recognition in the world.

In 1902 Mieczysław Wolfke moved to Leodium, Belgium to start studying at the university. Because of the low standard of laboratories and inadequate equipment, he went to Sorbonne in Paris. In Paris he got acquainted with ideas of Freemasonry. In 1907 he failed the bachelor&#x27;s exam and moved to Wroclaw (at that time Germany). He entered the University of Breslau and in 1910 he passed with the doctorate of philosophy (PhD) for his dissertation on the ability of resolution of optical systems on the example of microscope. Professor Otto Lummer was his supervisor. After the annulment of his first marriage, in March 1912 he married Agnes Erica Ritzmann.

After the patent of the cadmium-mercury lamp, which he and Karl Ritzmann (in the next years his brother-in-law) received in 1909, Wolfke was employed at the Carl Zeiss Company in Jena. However, working in the industry did not match his ambitions, in 1912 he went to Karlsruhe, where he worked as an assistant of professor Otto Lehmann at the Faculty of Physics at the local Polytechnic for four months. Soon after that, he moved to Zurich, where on 26 May 1913 he received a habilitation at the ETH (reviewers: Albert Einstein and Pierre Weiss) and in the next year – at the kantonal University (reviewers Max von Laue and Alfred Kleiner). Until the end of his stay in Zurich he lectured at both of these universities. He also worked for Carl Zeiss and Brown Boveri, but he consistently rejected any propositions of permanent and well-paid jobs in the industry. In 1915 his son, Karol Wolfke, was born and in 1918, the daughter, Lucyna was born.

After the restoration of Poland&#x27;s independence in 1918, Wolfke obtained a Polish passport. In 1920 he got a proposal to take the position of professor at the University of Warsaw and accepted the nomination, but due to the financial problems and the lack of a laboratory, he did not undertake this job. In 1921 he obtained a successive habilitation at the University of Zurich (reviewers: Edgar Meyer and Erwin Schrödinger).
In 1922 Wolfke got a position of professor at the Warsaw University of Technology and returned to Poland. At the Warsaw University of Technology he led the Department of Physics on the Faculty of Electrotechnics. In 1924 he started the cooperation with the Institute of Low Temperatures in Leiden.

In 1926 his second son, Stefan Wolfke, was born.

In the early thirties, Wolfke started to organize the Low Temperatures Institute. In 1938 he took part in the organization of the flight of Polish stratospheric balloon called &quot;Star of Poland&quot;. The first flight was unsuccessful and the second one was precluded by the World War II.

After the beginning of the World War II Wolfke was arrested (10@th November 1939), sent to Pawiak where he spent a week in cell number 49. After the release Mieczysław Wolfke managed (with the agreement of the occupier) the Research Department of Technical Physics and then lectured at the Higher State Technical School created in polytechnic buildings. He also organized support for the conspiracy and participated in underground teaching.

In May 1944, Mieczysław&#x27;s daughter Lucyna Rassalska died.

The events of 1944 separated Mieczysław from his family. Mieczysław went to Cracow, while his wife, son-in-law and grandson stayed in the Warsaw University of Technology until the end of the Warsaw Uprising. After the end of it they were resettled to Cracow. Mieczysław&#x27;s sons stayed in camps in Germany until the end of the war . In 1944 Mieczysław Wolfke married Krystyna Chądzyńska in Kraków.

After the end of military actions, Wolfke took part in the reconstruction of Polish science. He lectured at the University of Mining and Metallurgy in Cracow and at the Gdansk University of Technology. He also was involved in the formation of the Silesian University of Technology in Gliwice. In December 1945 he returned to Warsaw where he started to organize the Faculty of Physics at Warsaw University of Technology. At the time of reconstruction of the Faculty of Physics (building was destroyed during the Warsaw Uprising) Mieczysław Wolfke was delegated to foreign scientific centers to acquire the knowledge about an actual situation of world&#x27;s scientific research, an organization of institutes and also to buy a modern apparatus.

4 May 1947 Mieczysław Wolfke died suddenly in Zurich and was buried at Sihlfeld cemetery.

== Scientific activities ==
Mieczysław Wolfke became interested in science at a pretty early age. In 1895 he wrote &quot;Planetostat&quot; – a dissertation about interplanetary communication and in 1901 – &quot;Abstraktyka&quot; – a philosophical dissertation about &quot;science of science&quot;. However, these treatises were only in the form of manuscripts. In 1898 he patented in Russia and Germany a telectroscope. It was based on modified, rotating Nipkow disk, photosensitive selenium electrode and Geissler tube with brightness modulation. Wolfke was inspired by Jan Szczepanik&#x27;s telectroscope (invented a few years earlier), but his project was wireless using electromagnetic waves. Two years later he devised a mathematical theory of surface displacements on a plane.

His first science publication: &quot;Electron, considered as a center of pressure in ether&quot; was written in 1907 in Paris. In the same year he had a presentation in the Astronomical Society in Paris about the idea of a telescope with a concave mirror – it was giving larger magnification than before. In recognition the Society invited him to participate in it.

After arrival to Wrocław, Wolfke invented in 1908 a cathode tube with a glass window, and in 1909 with Karl Ritzmann he patented a cadmium-mercury lamp. He later sold his rights to it to the Carl-Zeiss Jena company, where he worked for a year after obtaining his doctorate. At University of Wrocław in the Otto Lummer’s team Wolfke worked at the generalization of the Abbe’s theory of optical imaging for non-linear gratings. In 1910 he obtained degree of Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) for dissertation about the resolving power of optical systems on example of microscope. Despite many great scientific achievements in his later years, Mieczysław Wolfke judged its content the most valuable.

During the stay in Zurich Mieczysław Wolfke was a member of a narrow group of physicists who created the paths of the world physics. In 1916 he started to study subject of Anode rays and – in 1917 – melting of tungsten (together with Gmür e CO company) and also on mercury Rectifiers. One year later his interests changed to carbon lamps, tungsten smelting and nitrogen combustion. At this time he published also dissertation &quot;Über die Möglichkeit der optischen Abbildung von Molekulargittern&quot; – (About a possibility of optical imaging of molecular gratings) – the world&#x27;s first concept of holography and the second of the achievements cherished the most by himself. This thesis refers to Wolfke&#x27;s stay in Karlsruhe in 1912, where he was an assistant to Professor Otto Lehmann – a physicist known as the father of Liquid crystals. In his laboratory Wolfke noticed that it was possible to first record the image on a photographic plate by illuminating the X-ray crystal and then read it with the use of additional optical unit and visible light. Dennis Gabor, during his Nobel lecture said: “I did not know at that time, and neither did Bragg, that Mieczysław Wolfke had proposed this method in 1920, but without realizing it experimentally”.

In 1922, after returning to Poland, Mieczysław Wolfke took up the problem of low temperatures. In 1924 Józef Wierusz-Kowalski – physicist, professor at the Warsaw University of Technology and from 1921 – Polish ambassador in the Hague – offered him a trip to Leiden and cooperation with the Institute of Low Temperatures in Leiden, where professor H. K. Kamerlingh-Onnes and (later) Willem Keesom studied the dielectric constant of liquid helium at various temperatures. The theoretical experiments led him to the discovery of two liquid phases of helium and solidification of helium what Mieczysław Wolfke considered as the third of his greatest achievements. In the early thirties Wolfke started to organize the separated Institute of Low Temperatures at Warsaw University of Technology, even running the first installation.

In 1927 Wolfke worked on the liquid helium dielectric constant and in the next year on the association in liquid dielectrics. He also started cooperation with the Polish Army in Temporary Advisory and Scientific Committee and created many inventions for the soldiers.

In 1930 he presented the theory of multiple associations. He also conducted the research on the point of change in the liquid phase and worked on the experimental finding of light molecules. Einstein mentioned his work at the Berlin Academy of Science.

In 1936 he checked the electric conductivity of liquid helium and started to organize the institute of low temperature at the Warsaw University of Technology. He also worked on the magnetocalorimetric of liquid helium.

In 1937 he found the direct evidence of fulfilment of the law of &quot;action and reaction&quot; for the electrical circuit of any shape. In 1938 he made his final measurements of magnetostriction of liquid oxygen and began researching autoprotonal discharges from palladium hydrogenated anodes.

All Wolfke&#x27;s plans were crossed by the World War II. From his Institute the German soldiers stole the lab equipment. During the occupation, Wolfke led the Research Institute of Technical Physics at the Warsaw University of Technology (which was controlled by the occupier) and had lectures at the Higher State Technical School. He also organized support for the conspiracy and participated in the underground teaching.

Before the war, in May 1939, Wolfke wrote an article in the magazine &quot;Polish Armed Forces&quot; which was a warning against Nuclear weapons, and in 1945 he wrote a book entitled &quot;Atomic bomb&quot;.

During his life he had many opened lectures which were very popular and gathered many listeners.

== Organizations ==
Mieczysław Wolfke belonged to many different organizations and associations, for example: Prussian Academy of Sciences, Academy of Technical Sciences, Commission of the International Institute of Refrigeration, Warsaw Scientific Society, Polish Physical Society, Polish Academy of Learning in Kraków, Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft, Schweizerische Physikalische Gesellschaft, Warsaw Polytechnic Society, Polish Society of Scientific Expeditions, International Cryogenic Commission, French Physical Society, Swiss Physical Society, Polish National Committee of the International Physical Society, Physical Education and Applied Sciences Committee, YMCA and the Grand National Assembly.

== Awards and honors ==
Mieczysław Wolfke was decorated the Commander&#x27;s Cross of Polonia Restituta.

<doc id="1027851" wikidata="Q1125773" url="?curid=1027851" title="Congo Bongo">
<text>also known as is a platform game released as an arcade video game by Sega in 1983. A message in the ROM indicates it was coded at least in part by the company Ikegami Tsushinki. The game is viewed in an isometric perspective, like Sega&#x27;s earlier &quot;Zaxxon&quot; (1982), but does not scroll. Numerous home ports followed.

The player takes the role of a red-nosed safari explorer attempting to catch an ape named Bongo who set fire to the explorer&#x27;s tent. The goal in each of the four screens is to move from the lower left corner to the location of the ape on the right or upper right. He must climb ledges, jump over water and gaps in the terrain, and avoid animal attackers.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Congo Bongo&quot; has similar elements and gameplay to Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; from 1981, with the isometric perspective from Sega&#x27;s &quot;Zaxxon&quot; released in Japan in early 1982. Both &quot;Congo Bongo&quot; and &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; involve primates who throw objects at the player from a vantage point atop a structure. Both games involve a large-nosed protagonist whose only ability is to jump. Both games have four different, single-screen stages. The goal of the first stage in both games is to climb to the top. Even the graphics of the bonus timer are similar to &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;″s.

===Stages===
#In the first stage, the hunter must avoid coconuts thrown by Bongo and he has to climb a series of cliffs to reach the ape, while at the same time shaking off three monkeys that try to throw the hunter off the mountain.
#In the second stage, the hunter must cross a swamp platform by riding on the backs of diving and swimming hippopotamuses and avoiding both venomous snakes and scorpions.
#The third stage requires the hunter to cross a plain and crouch into holes to evade the horns of charging rhinoceroses, while climbing up large flights of stairs to proceed to the next area.
#In the fourth and final stage, the hunter crosses a second swamp with lily pads, fish, and hippos, to reach a gate of charging rhinos that are blocking the entrance to Bongo in a hot tub.

The game repeats from the first level with increased difficulty.

==Ports==
&quot;Congo Bongo&quot; was ported to the Apple II, SG-1000, MSX, Intellivision, ColecoVision, Commodore 64 (first as a cartridge, then disk), VIC-20, IBM PC compatibles, Atari 2600, Atari 5200, Atari 8-bit computers, and TI-99/4A. Sega&#x27;s ports for the Atari 2600, 5200, Atari 8-bit, Intellivision, and Commodore 64 (cartridge version) include two of the four levels from the arcade original, while the ColecoVision release is missing the &quot;Snake Lake&quot; level.

The Atari 2600 version was released in March 1984, while the ColecoVision version was released in October of the same year.

==Reception==
In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Congo Bongo&quot; on their June 15, 1983 issue as being the fifth most-successful table arcade unit of the month. In the United States, &quot;Time&quot; magazine initially reported in 1983 that the arcade game was a commercial failure, before it went on to become a popular arcade game according to &quot;Computer Games&quot; magazine in early 1985. The game went on to have a number of home conversions, which were commercially successful in the United States.

&quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; magazine gave the arcade game a generally favorable review. They called its concept of &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; (1981) &quot;in three dimensions&quot; a &quot;fascinating idea&quot; while also noting the final level has similarities to &quot;Frogger&quot; (1981).

The home conversions received a mixed reception. The ColecoVision, Atari 5200 and Intellivision versions were awarded &quot;Best Videogame Audio-Visual Effects&quot; at the 1984 Arkie Awards. &quot;Ahoy!&quot; in 1984 stated that &quot;Congo Bongo&quot; for the Commodore 64 and VIC-20 &quot;is fraught with problems; gameplay is repetitive, frustrating, tedious, inconsistent, and at times confusing, and the music not only got on my nerves but stomped on them. Plus, the whole thing is derivative&quot;. &quot;Computer Games&quot; magazine gave the Atari VCS version a C− rating, calling the &quot;VCS version of&quot; the arcade game, &quot;for the most part, a disappointment&quot;. &quot;ST. Game&quot; readers named the Atari version of the game the worst Atari program of 1983, even worse than the notorious &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot;.

==Legacy==
The original arcade release is included in the PlayStation Portable version of &quot;Sega Genesis Collection&quot; (as an unlockable game) and &quot;Sonic&#x27;s Ultimate Genesis Collection&quot; for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. An enhanced remake was released for the PlayStation 2 under the Sega Ages label as a part of &quot;Sega Ages 2500 Series Vol. 23: Sega Memorial Selection&quot;.

<doc id="1027852" wikidata="Q1481820" url="?curid=1027852" title="Virgin Interactive Entertainment">
<text>Avalon Interactive Group, Ltd., formerly known as Virgin Interactive Entertainment, was a British video game distributor based within Europe that formerly traded as the video game publishing and distributing division of British conglomerate the Virgin Group.

During the company&#x27;s time under the Virgin brand, they had developed and published games for major platforms and employed developers, including Westwood Studios co-founder Brett Sperry and &quot;Earthworm Jim&quot; creators David Perry and Doug TenNapel. Others include video game composer Tommy Tallarico and animators Bill Kroyer and Andy Luckey.

Formed as Virgin Games in 1983, and built around a small development team called the Gang of Five, the company grew significantly after purchasing budget label Mastertronic in 1987. As Virgin&#x27;s video game division grew into a multimedia powerhouse, it crossed over to other industries from toys to film to education. To highlight its focus beyond video games and on multimedia, the publisher was renamed Virgin Interactive Entertainment in 1993.

As result of a growing trend throughout the 1990s of media companies, movie studios and telecom firms investing in video game makers to create new forms of entertainment, VIE became part of the entertainment industry after being acquired by media companies Blockbuster and Viacom, who were attracted by its multimedia and CD-ROM-based software development. 
Being located in close proximity to the thirty-mile zone and having access to the media content of its parent companies drew Virgin Interactive&#x27;s U.S. division closer to Hollywood as it began developing sophisticated interactive games, leading to partnerships with Disney and other major studios on motion picture-based games such as &quot;The Lion King&quot;, &quot;Aladdin&quot;, &quot;RoboCop&quot;, and &quot;The Terminator&quot;, in addition to being the publisher of popular titles from other companies like Capcom&#x27;s &quot;Resident Evil&quot; series and &quot;Street Fighter Collection&quot; and id Software&#x27;s &quot;Doom II&quot; in the European market.

Within the late-1990s, the North American operations were sold to Electronic Arts, while the European division later went under the hands of Interplay Entertainment and Titus Interactive. They soon transitioned exclusively as a distributor and were rebranded by Titus as Avalon Interactive in August 2003, and closed in 2005 following the former&#x27;s bankruptcy. Currently, the VIE library and intellectual properties are owned by Interplay Entertainment as a result of its acquisition of Titus. A close affiliate and successor of Spanish origin, Virgin Play, was formed in 2002 from the ashes of former Virgin Interactive&#x27;s Spanish division and kept operating until it folded in 2009.

==History==
===Early history (1983–1987)===
Nick Alexander formed Virgin Games in 1983 after leaving Thorn EMI. It was headquartered in Portobello Road, London. The firm initially relied on submissions by freelancer developers, but set up its own in-house development team in 1984, known as the Gang of Five. Early successes included &quot;Sorcery&quot; and &quot;Dan Dare&quot;. The company expanded with the acquisition of several smaller publishers, Rabbit Software, New Generation Software and Leisure Genius (publishers of the first officially licensed computer versions of &quot;Scrabble&quot;, &quot;Monopoly&quot; and &quot;Cluedo&quot;).

===Purchase of Mastertronic and rebranding to Virgin Mastertronic (1987–1991)===
1987 marked a turning point for Virgin after its acquisition of struggling distributor Mastertronic. Mastertronic had opened its North American headquarters in Irvine, California just a year earlier to build on its success at home, though growth exhausted its resources after expanding in Europe and acquiring publisher Melbourne House. Richard Branson stepped in and offered to buy 45 percent of Mastertronic stake, in exchange Mastertronic joined the Virgin Group.
The subsequent merger created Virgin Mastertronic Ltd. in 1988 with Alper as its president which enabled Virgin to expand its business reach overseas. Mastertronic had been the distributor of the Master System in the United Kingdom and is credited with introducing Sega to the European market, where they expanded rapidly. The Mastertronic acquisition enabled Virgin to compete with Nintendo in the growing home console market. The new owners then dissolved the Gang of Five internal development team in 1989.

===Return to publishing (1991–1993)===
To gain a foothold in its newly established market, Sega Enterprises, Ltd. acquired Mastertronic in 1991 while Virgin retained a small publishing unit, which was renamed Virgin Interactive Entertainment in 1993. A new London internal development team was set up in 1992.

Hasbro, who had previously licensed some of its properties to Virgin, bought 15 percent—later increased to 16.2 percent—stake in VIE in August 1993. Hasbro wanted to create titles based on its brands, which included Transformers, G.I. Joe and Monopoly. The deal cut off competitors like Mattel and Fisher-Price who were interested in a similar partnership.

In late 1993, Virgin Interactive spun off a new company, Virgin Sound and Vision, to focus exclusively on CD-based children&#x27;s and family entertainment.

===Purchase by Blockbuster Entertainment and Spelling Entertainment (1994–1998)===
As more media companies became interested in interactive entertainment, Blockbuster Entertainment, then the world&#x27;s largest video-store chain, acquired 20 percent of Virgin Interactive Entertainment in January 1994. It acquired 75 percent of VIE&#x27;s stock later in 1994 and purchased the remaining shares held by Hasbro in an effort to expand beyond its video store base. Hasbro went on to found their own game company, Hasbro Interactive the following year. The partnership with Blockbuster ended a year later when Blockbuster sold its stake to Spelling Entertainment, at the time being a subsidiary of Viacom. Viacom is the owner of Paramount Pictures and MTV, which made Virgin Interactive part of one of the world&#x27;s largest entertainment companies. Viacom had planned to sell Spelling and buy Virgin Interactive out of Spelling before the sale. While it abandoned the Spelling sale some time ago, the collapse in the games market appears to have killed off any interest in buying Virgin.

Blockbuster and Viacom invested heavily in the production of CD-based interactive multimedia—video games featuring sophisticated motion-picture video, stereo sound and computer animation. VIE&#x27;s headquarters were expanded to include 17 production studios where expensive SGI &quot;graphics supercomputers&quot; were used to build increasingly complicated games, eventually becoming one of the five largest U.S.-based video game companies.

In 1995, VIE signed a deal with Capcom to publish its titles in Europe, supplanting Acclaim Entertainment as Capcom&#x27;s designated European distributor. The U.S. division&#x27;s American development branch had adopted the name Burst in 1995 via recommendation from Neil Young. Around the same time, the London development branch had adopted the name Crimson. VIE later published titles released by other companies, such as Hudson Soft. That year, the company expanded their distribution arm over to Spain, by forming Virgin Interactive España SA. In the same year, the company launched a budget reissue brand for their PC titles called &quot;The White Label&quot;.

===Re-independence and purchase of US operations by Electronic Arts (1998–1999)===
Spelling put its ownership of Virgin up for sale as a public stock offering in 1997, stating that Virgin&#x27;s financial performance had been disappointing. Since Spelling&#x27;s purchase of the company, Virgin had lost $14 million in 1995 and was expected to post similar losses for 1996.

In 1998, Virgin Interactive&#x27;s US operations were divested to Electronic Arts as part of its $122.5 million (£75 million) acquisition of Westwood Studios that same year. Electronic Arts also acquired the Burst Studios development studio, which was renamed to Westwood Pacific by its new owners.

The European division though was put out in a majority stake buyout backed by Mark Dyne, who became its chief executive officer in the same year. Tim Chaney, the former managing director was named president.

===Purchase by Interplay and Titus (1999–2001)===
On February 17, 1999, Virgin Interactive announced they had entered into a distribution agreement with Interplay Entertainment, where Interplay would distribute Virgin Interactive&#x27;s titles in North America and several other territories including South America and Japan, while Virgin Interactive would exclusively distribute Interplay&#x27;s titles in Europe, folding their own distribution arm in the process. To coincide with the distribution agreement, Interplay acquired a 43.9% minority stake (Initially a 49.9% stake) in the company. The deal was made as part of Interplay&#x27;s attempt to gain profits, and the deal did not include publishing, which would remain as stand-alone entities.

In July 1999, French publisher Titus Interactive announced plans to purchase 50.6% of Interplay&#x27;s shares. Shortly after the purchase, they announced they would purchase a 50.1% majority stake in Virgin Interactive, with the publisher&#x27;s shareholders and management retaining a 6% stake. The following year in May 2000, Titus acquired the shareholders&#x27; 6% stake, with Titus now holding 56.6% in Virgin while Interplay retained their 43.9% stake. Titus also announced on the same day that Virgin Interactive would now distribute its titles in Europe and replace their standalone distribution arm. The deal was made following a similar distribution agreement in North America that would allow Interplay to market Titus&#x27; titles in the territory. A week later, Virgin signed a deal with Swing! Entertainment Media AG to distribute their titles in all European territories.

Virgin&#x27;s presence outside Europe at this point was almost non-existent, with only a few titles such as &quot;Viva Soccer&quot; and &quot;Jimmy White&#x27;s 2: Cueball&quot;, which was distributed in the North American market by Bay Area Multimedia instead of Interplay. However, in 2001, the North American branch of Titus; Titus Software, announced to resurrect the Virgin Interactive brand in North America to release several of Virgin&#x27;s existing European PC releases as $20 budget titles.

===Acquisition by Titus, sale of Spanish operations, rebranding, and fate (2002–2006)===

On 16 April 2001, Titus announced they had expanded their shares in Interplay to 72.5% and purchased their stake in Virgin Interactive, making Virgin a fully-owned subsidiary of Titus Interactive, S.A. The deal was done to simplify their publishing and distribution sides, with Virgin continuing to be Titus and Interplay&#x27;s exclusive European distributor. The developer Crimson, who was the London&#x27;s development branch, was renamed to Point Blank by its new owners during the development of &quot;Falcone: Enter the Maelstorm&quot;, which was subsequently cancelled.

On June 11, 2002, Titus announced they had accepted a management buyout of Virgin&#x27;s Spanish operations; Virgin Interactive España SA, by Virgin&#x27;s former CEO Tim Chaney along with former Spanish president and founder Paco Encinas. The deal was done for Titus to focus more on the UK, French and German subsidiaries. The business was renamed as Virgin Play in October, and would continue to distribute Titus and Interplay titles in Spain.

On July 1, 2003, Titus announced that Virgin Interactive would be renamed Avalon Interactive, with the French, Benelux and German operations soon following afterward.

In August 2004, the company launched a PC budget range titled &quot;Just2Play&quot; with Dutch publisher Xing Interactive for the UK and Benelux territories. The range was aimed to be similar to Avalon&#x27;s White Label range, but with the addition of titles from Xing Interactive.

===Closure===
In January 2005, Titus Interactive filed for bankruptcy with €33 million ($43.8 million) debt. Avalon France and all of Titus&#x27; French operations were closed down immediately, while the UK branch continued to trade as Titus&#x27; non-French operations were unaffected. Avalon&#x27;s UK operations were dissolved by November 2005.

<doc id="1027861" wikidata="Q6229555" url="?curid=1027861" title="John Dobson (architect)">
<text>John Dobson (9 November 17878 January 1865) was a 19th-century English neoclassical architect. During his life, he was the most noted architect in Northern England. He designed more than 50 churches and 100 private houses, but he is best known for designing Newcastle railway station and his work with Richard Grainger developing the neoclassical centre of Newcastle. Other notable structures include Nunnykirk Hall, Meldon Park, Mitford Hall, Lilburn Tower, St John the Baptist Church in Otterburn, Northumberland, and Beaufront Castle.

==Early life==
Dobson was born on 9 December 1787 in High Chirton, North Shields, in what is now the Pineapple Inn. He was the son of an affluent market gardener, John Dobson, and his wife Margaret.

Educated in Newcastle, he had an exceptional gift for drawing as a young child. Aged 11, he took the role of Hournary Draftsman for a well-renowned local damask weaver producing designs and sketches. At 15, he was placed as a pupil with David Stephenson, the leading architect-builder in Newcastle and the designer of All Saints&#x27; Church and the original Theatre Royal on Mosley Street. Dobson completed his studies in 1810, when he was 23.

He left Newcastle to study art in London as a pupil of the watercolourist John Varley. At first, Varley refused the offer of Dobson studying under him, saying he could not spare the time. However, upon seeing his disappointment, he agreed to give him lessons and quickly developed a mutual rapport. During his time in London, he formed lasting friendships with the likes of J. M. W. Turner, William H. Hunt, William Mulready and Robert Smirke. His Friends strongly encouraged him to stay and work in London, but he was back in Newcastle by 1811 assisting Sir Charles Monck design Belsay Hall. Monck, a passionate devotee of Grecian art and architecture, is thought to have strongly influenced Dobson, who adopted that architectural style in many of his future works. At the time, Dobson and Ignatius Bonomi in County Durham were the only practising architects between York and Edinburgh. The first building Dobson designed is unclear, but his daughter maintained it was North Seaton Hall, near Ashington, built in 1813 and demolished in 1960.

==Country houses==

Dobson was very versatile and could design in Gothic or Tudor style if his clients desired, but Georgian was his preferred style. His country houses are not well-known, as they generally are privately held, not large enough to be open to the public, and landscaped behind parkland and trees. Architectural features of Dobson country houses include the use of golden sandstone, Corinthian or Ionic pillared entrance porticos, elegant staircases with beautiful ironwork balustrades leading to an upper gallery with matching iron balustrades, and an entry hall with a domed ceiling and glass centrepiece. Often the ground-floor design includes a curved or bow end at one side of the house, like Nunnykirk Hall and Longhirst Hall. The quality of the stonework in all Dobson homes is superb, and it is believed that he regularly used the same team of stonemasons as he did with other craftsmen he employed.

==Plans for Newcastle==
In 1824, several years before Richard Grainger did the same, Dobson presented plans to the council to purchase and develop Anderson Place in Newcastle&#x27;s centre. Dobson proposed a Mansion House as a &quot;civic palace&quot; with grand squares linked by wide tree-lined streets. Dobson&#x27;s scheme called for an elegant city centre, but it was hugely expensive, and he lacked financial backing. Grainger&#x27;s later Newcastle plan was not as grand but showed greater business acumen, a reason it was accepted.

==Church of St Thomas the Martyr==
In 1820, the Newcastle City Council authorized the demolition of the Chapel of St Thomas the Martyr at the north end of the Tyne Bridge so the road could be widened. The council chose Barras Bridge on Magdalene Meadow, belonging to St Mary Magdalene Hospital, as the location for the new chapel. Dobson designed it in the modified Gothic style in 1827, featuring a novel hollow tower. Construction was completed by 1830, at the cost of £6,000. Dobson also designed the Watergate Building, Sandhill, which replaced the demolished Chapel of St. Thomas the Martyr.

==Central Station==
In 1849 the High Level Bridge was built over the River Tyne, bringing the railway to Newcastle and north to Scotland. A suitably impressive station was required for a thriving town such as Newcastle, and Dobson provided it in his plans. His original plan of 1848 showed an ornate façade with a vast portico having double colonnades and an Italianate tower at the east end. Behind this was an enormous train shed made up of three arched glass roofs built in a curve on an radius. This design won an award at the Paris Exhibition of 1858. Unfortunately, Dobson was forced to alter his plans to produce a much less substantial portico and remove the Italianate tower. The station was completed in 1850 without the planned portico, and it was not until 1863 that this was added.
John Dobson argued for the role of the architect in building railway stations, and his Newcastle Central is regarded by many as the finest in England. According to Gordon Biddle and Oswald Nock in &quot;The Railway Heritage of Britain&quot;: &quot;Undoubtedly it would have been one of the finest 19th-century classical buildings in Europe had it been completed... Even so, Newcastle Central today is magnificent inside for its spectacular combination of curves and outside for its sheer size and length&quot;. The train shed at Newcastle, the authors state, &quot;was the first of the great arched roofs and represented a bold step forward which was copied by others&quot;. It was the first use of malleable rolled iron ribs – indeed the first large glass and iron vault in England, predating the Crystal Palace. Gibson Kyle, Dobson&#x27;s nephew, was the clerk of works on this project.

==The Royal Arcade==
In 1830, the Newcastle City Council rejected Richard Grainger’s proposed corn exchange on a site at the bottom of Pilgrim Street, opposite Mosley Street. Grainger then built a Dobson-designed shopping arcade on the site, completed in 1832. Modelled after an elegant London shopping arcade, it had two office blocks facing Pilgrim Street and Manor Chare. The two were connected by a narrow block that formed the arcade. The arcade&#x27;s front façade had six fluted Corinthian columns, and its interior was long with an arched Grecian-style ceiling with several domed skylights. Although elegant, the Royal Arcade was not a commercial success. It was located too far from the town centre&#x27;s main shopping areas. Demolition was considered as early as the 1880s, but the arcade survived until the 1960s.

==Eldon Square==
In 1824, Richard Grainger commissioned Dobson to produce designs for Eldon Square. Dobson&#x27;s clean Grecian-inspired design had three two and story terraces facing a central square. The east and west terraces had 27 bays of windows, and the north terrace had 39 bays. The first floors had continuous cast-iron balconies with Grecian honeysuckle decoration. Giant Doric pilasters at the end of each terrace were faced with finely cut ashlar, more elegant and clean than the stucco used extensively in London at the time. Only the east terrace survives, as the other two were demolished by 1973 for the Eldon Square Shopping Centre.

==Grainger Market==

Grainger&#x27;s plans for the development of Newcastle town centre involved the demolition of the existing flesh market. Grainger, therefore, offered to build a new meat market and vegetable market. The meat market was placed between two new streets, Grainger Street and Clayton Street, and the vegetable market was placed on the west side of Clayton Street. Both were designed by Dobson. The meat market had pilastered arcades, 360 windows, fanlights and wooden cornices, and four avenues each long. It contained 180 butchers&#x27; shops when it opened. The vegetable market was given an open-plan layout, long, wide and high, with a fine timber roof. In 1835, to celebrate the opening of the markets, a grand dinner was given in the vegetable market, with 2,000 guests and presided over by the Mayor. Surprisingly, in the after-dinner speeches, no mention was made of Dobson.

==Grey Street==
The crowning piece of Grainger&#x27;s plan for the development of Newcastle was a new street leading up from Dean Street to intersect with Blackett Street. Originally called Upper Dean Street, it was eventually renamed Grey Street. Dobson was originally credited for the whole street&#x27;s design (by Pevsner for one), possibly due to his daughter&#x27;s assertions. It is now believed that Dobson was responsible only for the east side from Shakespeare Street to Mosley Street, and architects from Grainger&#x27;s office, John Wardle and George Walker, designed the west side.

==Contribution to Grainger Town==
Richard Grainger exercised close control over the master plan for Grainger Town and the quality of the work. John Dobson is given much of the credit for the detailed design, but other architects made significant contributions, especially Thomas Oliver and John and Benjamin Green. Substantial work was also done by two architects in Grainger&#x27;s office, John Wardle and George Walker. They designed the west side of Grey Street, as well as Grainger Street, Clayton Street and Market Street. Dobson&#x27;s daughter, Jane, confused crediting by claiming her father did the work of other architects. For instance, she claimed that Dobson designed Leazes Terrace and Leazes Crescent, although Thomas Oliver actually designed them.

==Break with Grainger==
In 1841, Grainger, unknown to Dobson, had serious financial difficulties and owed Dobson a large sum of money for his work. Grainger attempted to reduce the indebtedness by charging Dobson £250 for a staircase and painted ceiling removed from Anderson Place. Dobson thought the amount was outrageous and an underhanded trick, expressing his indignation to Grainger in various surviving letters. It is believed these circumstances led to the final break of their professional relationship.

==Personal life==
Dobson married Isabella, the eldest daughter of Alexander Rutherford of Warburton House, Gateshead. She had great artistic talent and was an excellent painter of miniatures. They had three sons and five daughters. His youngest son, Alexander, Ralph, Dobson born November 1834, inherited his father&#x27;s artistic genius, gaining first prize in architecture at University College. He had just returned to his father&#x27;s office full of enthusiasm to work when he was killed aged just 19 in the great explosion on Gateshead quayside on 4 October 1854 whilst helping to extinguish the Great fire of Newcastle and Gateshead.

==Later life==
Dobson&#x27;s wife, Isabella, died at 51 in 1846. Thirteen years later, in 1859, he was elected first President of the newly formed Northern Architectural Association at 72. He suffered a stroke, from which he never fully recovered, and retired in 1863. He lived for a time in Ryton but died on 8 January 1865 at 77 in his home at 15 New Bridge Street, leaving a comfortable £16,000 fortune. He is buried in Jesmond Old Cemetery, where a memorial was erected circa 1905.

The house in which Dobson died still stands. It was fully restored in 2019 after having been the Oxford Galleries and a series of nightclubs.

<text>The PJSC Lukoil Oil Company ( stylized as LUKOIL or ЛУКОЙЛ in Cyrillic script) is a Russian multinational energy corporation headquartered in Moscow, specializing in the business of extraction, production, transport, and sale of petroleum, natural gas, petroleum products, and electricity. It was formed in 1991 when three state-run, western Siberian companies merged. The original companies were named after their respective towns in Khanty–Mansi Autonomous Okrug that each was based in; Langepasneftegaz, Urayneftegaz, and Kogalymneftegaz. Its new name is the combination of the acronym LUK (initials of the oil-producing cities of Langepas, Uray, Kogalym) and the English word &quot;oil&quot;.

Lukoil is the second largest company in Russia after Gazprom, and the country&#x27;s largest non-state enterprise in terms of revenue, with ₽4,744 billion in 2018. In the 2020 Forbes Global 2000, Lukoil was ranked as the 99th-largest public company in the world. Internationally, it is one of the largest global producers of crude oil. In 2019, the company produced 87.488 million metric tons of oil (1.639 million barrels per day) and 35.046 billion cubic meters of natural gas. , the company had operations and subsidiaries in more than 30 countries around the world. In 2022, the company&#x27;s revenue amounted to 2.9 trillion rubles.

==History==
=== Origins ===
&quot;Langepas, Uray, and Kogalym&quot; oil (Lukoil) was established by the Soviet Union Council of Ministers Decree No. 18 on November 25, 1991, as a state-owned enterprise. In the new company, three oil production companies, Langepasneftegaz, Uraineftegaz, and Kogalymneftegaz, processing company Permnefteorgsintez, and the Volgograd and Novosibirsk refineries, were merged (the latter soon came under the control of the authorities of Bashkortostan).

The central figure in the company&#x27;s founding was the Soviet deputy minister of oil production Vagit Alekperov. He came to believe the only way Russians could compete against western companies was to copy their business model. That meant vertically integrating the three branches of the industry—exploration, refining, and distribution—that were strictly separate under the old Soviet system.

On April 5, 1993, Lukoil transformed itself from a state-owned enterprise to a private open joint-stock company based on Presidential Decree No. 1403 of November 17, 1992.

=== 1990s ===
In 1994, Lukoil became the first company to begin offering shares of stock on the new Russian Trading System. The Filanovsky oil field was discovered and operated by Lukoil.

In 1995, Lukoil controlled the stakes of nine oil-producing, marketing and service enterprises in Western Siberia, the Urals, and Volgograd Oblast in order to abide by Government Decree No. 861 of September 1, 1995. In the same year, a 5% stake of Lukoil was sold by the state with a minimum excess of the starting price in an auction. In November 1995, Lukoil filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to issue American depositary receipts on Western stock markets. This allowed United States investors for the first time, to be able to buy shares in a Russian company.

In 1997, Lukoil signed a contract with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil for the development and production of the second stage of the West Qurna-2 oil field. After Saddam Hussein&#x27;s regime was overthrown, the project was suspended and later terminated.

In 1999, Lukoil acquired numerous enterprises such as the Odesa Oil Refinery in Ukraine, the Burgas Oil Refinery in Bulgaria, and KomiTEK.

=== 2000s ===
In 2000, Lukoil acquired the distribution and marketing operations of American oil company Getty Oil. This resulted in the control of a network of gas stations in the United States as well as the first time Lukoil enters the American oil market.

In September 2004, ConocoPhillips purchased a 7.6% stake in Lukoil for about $2 billion. According to some commentators, the sale of this deal was planned before in a personal meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and ConocoPhillips&#x27; president and CEO, James Mulva. After the auction, Lukoil and ConocoPhillips announced the creation of a strategic alliance. Later, the American company increased its stake to 20% in Lukoil and sold to the Russian company part of its network of gas stations in the United States and Western Europe. The two oil companies also agreed to jointly develop an oil and gas field in the northern Timan-Pechora area of Russia (Komi Republic) and intended to secure the rights to develop the West Qurna Field in Iraq, one of the country&#x27;s largest.

Uzbekistan&#x27;s deputy prime minister Ergash Shaismatov announced on 30 August 2006 that the Uzbek government and an international consortium consisting of state-run Uzbekneftegaz, Lukoil Overseas, Petronas, Korea National Oil Corporation, and China National Petroleum Corporation signed a production sharing agreement to explore and develop oil and gas fields in the Aral Sea, stating &quot;The Aral Sea is largely unknown, but it holds a lot of promise in terms of finding oil and gas. There is risk of course but we believe in the success of this unique project&quot;. In December 2006, Lukoil announced the acquisition of 376 filling stations in six European countries: Belgium, the Czech Republic, Finland, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia, from ConocoPhillips.

In 2007, Lukoil established a joint-venture with Gazprom and in 2008, established a joint-venture as well with Italian oil company Erg S.p.A. In 2009, Lukoil and Norwegian oil company Statoil won a tender offer for the development of the West Qurna Field in Iraq. However, in early 2012, Statoil withdrew from the project, resulting in Lukoil consolidating 75% of development of the oil field.

=== 2010s ===
From 2010 to February 2011, ConocoPhillips sold its whole 20% stake in Lukoil due to its difficult financial situation.

In September 2012, Lukoil created a shared service centre in the Czech Republic to provide accounting services to its subsidiaries in Belgium, Poland, and Bulgaria. In December 2012, Lukoil bought the Imilor field for ₽50.8 billion in the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug to explore and develop the hydrocarbon deposits located there.

In February 2013, Lukoil sold the Odesa Oil Refinery to the Ukrainian &quot;East European Fuel and Energy Company&quot; (VETEK). For Lukoil, the oil refinery was unprofitable when production was stopped as early as October 2010 and the refinery finally closed in the summer of 2013. In April 2013, Lukoil agreed to buy Hess Corporation&#x27;s Russian unit for $2.05 billion.

In 2014, the company faced a sharp decline in retail sales in Ukraine by 42%, caused by Russian intervention in Ukraine. As a result, the management of Lukoil agreed to sell 100% of its subsidiary Lukoil Ukraine to the Austrian company AMIC Energy Management, which was announced at the end of July 2014.

In 2014, Lukoil sold its service stations in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary.

In 2015, it sold its service stations in Estonia and Ukraine, and in 2016, it sold its service stations in Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Cyprus.

=== 2020s ===
In March 2022, Lukoil&#x27;s market stock price dropped 95 percent, as a result of international sanctions during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

On 21 April 2022, Lukoil issued a statement saying that president Vagit Alekperov had stepped down and resigned from the board of directors after 29 years.

The Norway state-owned oil company Equinor exited the last of their joint ventures in Russia by withdrawing the joint venture with Lukoil and exiting the Kharyaga project on 2 September 2022.

In 2023 Lukoil is planning to double the production of oil from the Iraq project, West Qurna Field 2, to 800,000 bpd.

‡ do not process Russian crude oil 

Speaking at a press conference in New York on October 18, 2006, the company&#x27;s CEO Vagit Alekperov said Lukoil is refusing to build a new refinery in Russia. According to him, &quot;at this stage it is inexpedient and economically inefficient.&quot; At the same time, Lukoil planned to build a large complex in Kalmykia for the processing of natural gas from the North Caspian fields worth over $3 billion. The work was supposed to start in the spring of 2008. Also in March 2007, Lukoil announced it would expand the capacity in the Lukoil Neftochim Burgas refinery in Burgas, Bulgaria from 7.5 million tons to 10 million tons of oil per year.

=== Effects from Russo-Ukrainian War ===
In March 2022, Toby Gati, Roger Munnings and Wolfgang Schüssel left the board of directors due to International sanctions during the Russo-Ukrainian War.

During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the chairman of Lukoil Ravil Maganov had criticised the Russian attack on Ukraine. On 1 September 2022 he was found dead outside his hospital window the day that President Putin visited the hospital. Nearby video cameras had been turned off. The company has acknowledged the death in a statement saying that Ravil Maganov: &quot;passed away following a severe illness&quot;.

The refinery in Italy was sold in 2023, the one in Bulgaria was allowed to continue after agreeing to pay taxes in Bulgaria and the refinery in Romania was permitted to continue provided it only refined non-Russian oil. In September 2023, the Bulgarian authorities transferred the Rosenets port oil terminal under state control. By decision of parliament, Lukoil&#x27;s 35-year concession was terminated early without payment of compensation.

== Environmental record ==
According to Lukoil, their numbers in 2007 recorded a drop of 7.8% in the volume of pollutant effects and a drop of 3.8% in the area of contaminated lands compared to 2006. These numbers came after an appeal from EMERCON, the Ministry of the Russian Federation for Civil Defense, Emergencies and Natural Disaster Recovery, which proposed that Lukoil participate in the development of monitoring, prevention, and emergency recovery systems.

In an effort to increase productivity, Lukoil organized a contract to begin an oil pumping block in the Azerbaijani sector of the Caspian Sea. It arranged an Environmental Impact Assessment of the drill site in order to organize a second exploration drill. This block, D-222, was the largest prospective structure in the north-east section of the Caspian Sea as of 2008. The key issue was to assess how much damage the oil block would inflict on local fish populations. Taking into account the depth of the operation, around 700 meters, the amount of harm was projected to be minimal, with the majority of the damaged marine life being plankton and benthos. A rescue and salvage ship would be stationed there to mitigate the environmental effects on the area. Lukoil would develop contingency plans for oil spills and implement an environmental monitoring system.

At the same time, Lukoil faces criticism from various environmental organizations. In particular, the company&#x27;s oil production in the Baltic Sea near Kaliningrad Oblast was criticized as it is 22 kilometers away from the Curonian Spit, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

According to a number of critics, Lukoil inherited the worst standards of the Soviet oil industry with respect to the environment, not taking enough responsibility to minimize pollution in its oil fields and refineries.

Lukoil has been ranked as among the 14th best of 92 oil, gas, and mining companies on indigenous rights and resource extraction in the Arctic.

In the Arctic Environmental Responsibility Index (AERI) Lukoil is ranked no. 37 out of 120 oil, gas, and mining companies involved in resource extraction north of the Arctic Circle.

== Controversies ==

=== Environmental incidents ===
On one of the storage ponds of JSC &quot;Lukoil-Volgograd-neftepererabotka&quot; during the period from July 25 to August 8, 1996, the oil sludge was ignited due to the unacceptable conduct of welding operations. The surface layer of oil products was formed during the last two decades, and a similar ignition in this area was already noted in 1972. As a result of the 1996 fire, about 50,000 tons of oil products were burned, since even the soil was saturated with volatile fractions at this site. Where the fire was first lit, the concentration of carbon monoxide exceeded the permissible standards by almost 28 times, nitrogen dioxide tripled, hydrogen sulfide and phenol more than 1.5 times. In the residential areas of the Krasnoarmeysky district of Volgograd, located 7 km from the fire, as well as in the nearby settlements - B. and M. Chapurnik, Dubov Gully, Chervlen, Tingut - the content of combustion products in the air also exceeded the maximum permissible concentration. In the liquidation of this major technogenic emergency situation with severe environmental consequences, the divisions of the Ministry of Emergency Situations of Russia took part.

In the fall of 2003, the Russian Emergencies Ministry revealed the oil spill as a result of the depressurization of the interfacial oil pipeline belonging to the TPP Lukoil-Usinskneftegaz on the territory of the Komi Republic near the city of Usinsk. The area of oil pollution in one case was about 1.8 thousand m2, in the second - 377 m2.

On January 25, 2011 at about 10:00 (local time), as a result of oil leakage in the engine room LGPZ (CCI &quot;Langepasneftegaz&quot;), there was a fire. Fire extinguished more than 50 fighter. The plant suspended its work.

On April 20, 2012, at the Trebs field, developed jointly by Lukoil and Bashneft, there was an accident that caused significant damage to the natural environment: over a day, continued flowing of oil from the re-opened well, which led to large-scale contamination of the territory. According to the press service of the administration of the Nenets Autonomous District, the contamination area exceeded 5 thousand square meters, the volume of spilled oil, according to Bashneft, was 600 tonnes (in independent sources numbers were up to 2.2 thousand tonnes).

On May 11, 2021, a leakage was identified in a pipeline connected to Lukoil&#x27;s Oshkoye field. The spill was estimated at 100 tons of oil, yet environmentalists argued that 100 tons is an underestimate. The spill had infiltrated the Kolva river and traveled upstream, affecting the river habitats. Russia&#x27;s Northwest Komi Republic declared emergency. The damage was estimated at $4.1 billion.

=== Ukrainian investigation ===
In January 2015, the Security Service of Ukraine announced an investigation into whether Lukoil had financed separatists in Donbas.

=== Antitrust law violations ===
In November 2009, the Federal Antimonopoly Service of Russia (FAS) imposed a record fine of ₽6.54 billion on the company for violating antitrust legislation. The fine was imposed for the abuse of the company&#x27;s dominant position in the wholesale market of petroleum products in the first half of 2009, expressed in &quot;the seizure of goods from circulation&quot; and the creation of &quot;discriminatory conditions for the sale of petroleum products to individual counterparties&quot;. As FAS has calculated, these actions led to an increase in prices in the wholesale markets of motor gasoline, diesel fuel, and aviation kerosene in the first half of 2009.

=== Cambridge Analytica ===
In March 2018, the data firm Cambridge Analytica, tied to the 2016 Trump Campaign, was accused of discussing &quot;political targeting&quot; of American voters with representatives of Lukoil. &quot;Cambridge Analytica sought to identify mental and emotional characteristics in certain subsets of the American population and worked to exploit them by designing them to activate some of the worst vulnerabilities in people, such as neuroticism, paranoia and racial biases,&quot; whistleblower Christopher Wylie told the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2018. With Lukoil, the consulting firm shared election disruption strategies, which included videos and posters intended to demoralise and alarm voters. Lukoil is on the Sectoral Sanctions Identifications list, has been linked to Russian influence in the past, and CEO Vagit Alekperov, a former oil minister, had made statements suggesting that he considers helping Russia to be a strong political ambition.

=== VP driving accident ===
On February 25, 2010, Lukoil&#x27;s vice president crashed his Mercedes S500 into a Citroën C3 car with doctor Olga Alexandrina and famous obstetrician Vera M. Sidelnikova inside; both women died in the collision. The General Administration for Traffic Safety blamed the driver of the Citroën but it was suggested the administration was covering up that the real culprit of the accident was the driver of the Mercedes, who, according to eyewitnesses, was driving around a traffic jam and went into the oncoming lane. There is also some speculation that the driver of the Mercedes was the vice-president of Lukoil himself. A few days after the accident, the Head of the State Traffic Safety Inspectorate of Moscow issued a notice of misconduct to the commander of the Traffic Police battalion who registered the accident on Leninsky Avenue because he had prematurely called the driver of the Citroën, Olga Alexandrin, the culprit of the accident. The incident caused a public reaction, in particular, a boycott of this company&#x27;s gas stations was organized. Blogger Andrei Bocharov announced a mock advertisement of Lukoil based on this accident, and rapper Noize MC wrote the song &quot;Mercedes S666 (Make Way for the Chariot)&quot;.

=== Bulgaria ===
In July 2011, Lukoil had a conflict with Bulgarian authorities. According to the latter, the company&#x27;s Bourgas refinery did not have timely installed meters for the manufactured fuel (used to determine the amount of excises paid), which, according to officials, Lukoil allegedly underpaid about €250 million to the country&#x27;s budget. As a result, the company lost its license and was stopped, but in early August 2011 the plant was re-launched.

In 2023 Bulgaria took the decision to force Russian energy companies out of the country, and increased the tax rate to 60% on the Lukoil Neftohim Burgas profits, hoping the plant will be sold. Bulgaria also banned the export of refined Russian oil from 1 January 2024 and the import of Russian crude oil from 1 March 2024.

=== Romania ===
In October 2023 Romania invalidated the petroleum products wholesale trading licence that had been held by the Swiss-registered subsidiary of Lukoil, Litasco SA, which supplies crude oil to and distributes refined oil from the Petrotel Lukoil Refinery. Apart from a tax dispute, Romania claims the refinery does not disclose the source of its crude oil, the amount it processes or where the refined oil is distributed.

=== Sanctions ===
On 11 September 2014, US President Obama said that the United States would join the EU in imposing tougher sanctions on Russia&#x27;s financial, energy and defence sectors, following the escalation of Russo-Ukrainian War. The U.S. added Lukoil to the Sectoral Sanctions Identifications list on September 12, 2014.

The effect of sanctions in 2022 against shipped Russian oil has had a detrimental effect on the Priolo Gargallo ISAB refinery in Sicily with an inability to bring in oil from Russia and related cash flow finance problems. This has resulted in the refinery being put under Italian trusteeship with a buyer being sought.

Lukoil has been sanctioned by New Zealand.

== Criticism ==
* The Association of Small and Medium-Sized Oil Production Enterprises, also known as Assoneft, criticized Lukoil and the authorities of the Komi Republic for providing tax breaks to the oil companies of the region, which are obliged to extract at least 7 million tons of oil per year and (or) recycle at least 3 million tons. Only two enterprises–Lukoil-Komi and Lukoil-Ukhtaneftepererabotka–correspond to these conditions in the region. In March 2007, the Federal Antimonopoly Service initiated a case against the State Council of the Komi on the grounds of violation of Part 1 of Art. 15 of the Law &quot;On Protection of Competition&quot; with regard to restricting competition in the oil production and refining markets.
* In October 2005, then-prime minister of Lithuania, Algirdas Brazauskas, was in the center of the scandal involving Lukoil. The opposition of the Lithuanian parliament, Homeland Union, began collecting signatures for the creation of a parliamentary commission to investigate the entrepreneurial activity of Brazauskas&#x27; wife, Christina Butrimene-Brazauskiene, in particular with the acquisition of a 38% stake in the elite Vilnius Crowne Plaza hotel from the wife of the head of the Lukoil-Baltija company. The charges were related to Lukoil&#x27;s contention at that time for a stake in one of the largest enterprises in Lithuania, the oil refinery ORLEN Lietuva, part of Polish energy company ORLEN. Brazauskas rejected allegations of corruption, but admitted his wife owns 51% of the hotel shares, and another 48% belong to his son. On November 22, at the insistence of the country&#x27;s president Valdas Adamkus, Algirdas Brazauskas spoke on television, saying he was not involved in the privatization of the hotel, and that all charges should be considered by law enforcement bodies, not by the parliamentary commission.
* On September 14, 2012, more than fifty Lukoil gas station owners in New Jersey and Pennsylvania temporarily raised their prices to over $8 a gallon to protest Lukoil&#x27;s wholesale gas pricing. The owners are typically charged a wholesale price that is 5 to 10 cents a gallon more than their competitors and some are assessed an additional 25 to 30 cents per gallon based on their location. According to the station owners this makes it difficult to be competitive with stations that sell more established brands for lower prices.
* In March 2016, there were accusations by the press of the company not acquiring rights to part of the Massandra vineyards in Crimea.

<doc id="1027883" wikidata="Q5369408" url="?curid=1027883" title="Empa, Cyprus">
<text>Empa () is one of the largest villages in Paphos, Cyprus. It is spread over a wide area and not only borders Paphos but also the villages of Chlorakas, Kissonerga, Tala, Tremithousa and Mesogi. It has a population of more than 4,000 people.
==History==
The village already existed by the Byzantine era and it is known from the Frankish period with the same name. The 15th century Cypriot historian Leontios Machairas in his &quot;Chronicle&quot;, par. 129, mentions a visit of the King of Cyprus, Peter I (1359–1369), quoting &quot;...and the king went hunting and reached Emba towards Paphos...&quot;.

Louis de Mas Latrie includes the village both amongst those that belonged to the family of the king of Cyprus during the period of Frankish rule, and as one of the king&#x27;s villages that cultivated sugarcane. During 1468 the village had fallen under the region of Chrysochous, under the regional law officer (bailliage).
==Etymology==
The appellation of the village is purely Greek, belonging to the Cypriot dialect. In this dialect &quot;Emba&quot; means &quot;enter&quot;. It is possible that the name of the village was given because it is built at the entrance of Paphos, that is the edges of the city, through which the travellers from the north, northwest and west came in. Another version mentions that the name was given to the village because it is situated near the coast from where people departed from or arrived to Cyprus by sea, during the Byzantine era or even later during the period of Frankish rule. It is mentioned that King Peter I departed for Europe from the area in 1362. The village is noted as &#x27;Emba&#x27; in medieval maps.

==Monuments==
The ancient church of Panayia Chryseleoussis is in the community. Built in the 12th century in Byzantine Rhythm, it literally embellishes the village square. Almost all the walls in the interior of the church are covered with frescoes. Certain of them are priceless for their religious and historical value, such as that of Pantokratoros and that of Saint George that are next to the pulpit and which date from around the 13th century. Also to be appreciated is the fretworked gold plated iconostasis from the 16th of century which is adorned with ancient pictures of Jesus, the Virgin Mary and Saint John Precursor. In the church is also found a Gospel from the 16th century, which was printed in Venice. Thousands of tourists visit the church each year to admire its architecture and the wonders it contains.

There are also a number of chapels in Emba such as the Byzantine chapel dedicated to Saint George (in the vicinity of Petridia),the cave chapel of Saint Limbros (also at Petridia), and the new chapel dedicated to Saint Charalambos. At Petridia in former times there was also the church of Saint Akakios built on land which was a dependency of the Monastery of Stavros at the village of Omodos. The other chapels of Emba now in ruins are the following: the Chapel of Saint Eleftherios, the Chapel of All Saints (Ayioi Pantes), the Chapel of Timios Prodromos, the Chapel of Saint Sofronios, the Chapel of Saint Mercurios, the Chapel of the Five Saints (Ayioi Pente): Efstratios, Afxentios, Evgenios, Mardarios, Orestis), the Chapel of Saint Paraskevi, and the Cave of Saint Kournoutas at Petridia.

Recently a new church was constructed near the old one; it was dedicated to the apostle Andreas (St. Andrew) and on his name day, 30 November, a religious festival is held on the church grounds.

==Economy==
Emba has a few shops and tavernas dotted along the narrow winding road that runs through the village. In the evening the local men can be seen sitting outside their local coffee shops and often spilling out onto the narrow roads on their wooden chairs.
==Personalities==
Outstanding personalities of the village of Emba include the Bishop Anthimos of Irinoupolis (situated then in Baghdad, Iraq) who was born at the village of Emba and died in 1791, Nikolas Solomonides who was the private secretary of the Dragoman of Cyprus Hadjigeorgakis Kornesios, but also a poet and an intellectual, his brother Andreas Solomonides who was a nobleman and was employed at the Ottoman Court (seraglio) in Nicosia and thus saved the church of Emba from being destroyed by the Ottomans, but also the villagers of Emba from paying taxes to them after 1821. They both lived during the end of the 18th century and early 19th century. Another outstanding personality from Emba was Father Christodoulos (1816), a great priest of the village.

<text>The CCCF Championship was the first official football competition for senior national teams from Central America and the Caribbean. It was organized by the [[Confederación Centroamericana y del Caribe de Fútbol]] (CCCF) as its top regional tournament, from 1941 to 1961.

==History==
The regional competition was born in 1938, in Panama City, with the founding of the Confederación Centroamericana y del Caribe de Fútbol (), but the outbreak of the Second World War, a year later, prevented the first championship from taking place.

The initiative, at first, did not have great acceptance in May 1941, during the opening tournament in the Costa Rican capital San José, as only five teams were registered. The champion was the host Costa Rica and in the individual field, the Costa Rican José Rafael &quot;Fello&quot; Meza and the Curaçao-born Hans Najar were the top scorers, with eight goals, and the Costa Rican Hugo Zúñiga was the goalkeeper who was beaten the least, having only conceded five goals in four games.

In the II Central American and Caribbean Football Championship, held in December 1943 at the Estadio Jorge &quot;El Mágico&quot; González in San Salvador.

The host El Salvador was shaping up to be the future champion, and to do so it only needed to beat Costa Rica. The tournament&#x27;s Organizing Committee was so confident that it prepared a final ceremony with great pomp and display. Unfortunately for them, Costa Rica won 4–2, against a local team cheered on by 30,000 people. The Ticos thus aborted the Salvadoran celebration. The fans unleashed their anger against Costa Ricans and Guatemalans, who happily hugged each other in the middle of the field and were showered with insults. Members of the army intervened to guard the Costa Rican team to the Astoria Hotel, guaranteeing their safety. The site was soon surrounded by a crowd, which came defiant of their team&#x27;s defeat.

El Salvador and Guatemala tied for first place with nine points, and had to play a playoff to decide the title. But the Guatemalan delegation, after the bitter experience of Costa Rica in the last game, decided to withdraw from the competition, fearful of what would happen if they won, so the Salvadoran team was the champion for having a better goal difference than the Guatemalans.

The III Central American and Caribbean Football Championship, held again in San José, between February and March 1946, Guatemala was one point behind Costa Rica, which took over the title with eight points, compared to seven of its enemies.

For the IV Central American and Caribbean Football Championship, Costa Rica once again took over the laurels. An incredible 5–4 in favor of the Canaleros, in their duel against Guatemala, automatically produced the championship for Costa Rica with 11 points.

Jaime Meza, like his brother Fello did in 1941, obtained this time the title of top scorer of the championship, with 11 points; while Manuel Cantillo was declared the goalkeeper with the fewest defeats, with eight goals in five matches.

Only Nicaragua, Panama and Costa Rica attended the 1951 Central American and Caribbean tournament, as Guatemala, El Salvador and the rest of the nations in the area declined to participate, concerned about the news of an outbreak of polio in Panama.

The first game was Costa Rica, which decided to bring a team of young people since it protected its figures from the disease, against the weak Nicaraguan team. It was the only game that the Ticos took seriously, as they won it with an unchallengeable 8–1.

However, this victory, which fueled the belief that the tournament would be another trophy for the Ticos, was just an illusion. The Panamanians soon defeated them 0–2, in a very rough game.

In the second round, Costa Rica lost the chance to retain the cup, as it tied 1–1 with Panama and beat the Panamanian team 7–2, results that gave the title to the host team and the runner-up spot to the Costa Rican team. Thanks to the title, the host qualified for the 1952 Panamerican Championship.

Undefeated in six games, it was the highest scoring team, with 19 goals, and the team with the fewest goals scored, with two. These results gave Costa Rica - in March 1953 - its fourth Central American and Caribbean football title, with which it regained the crown lost two years earlier in Panama.

Costa Rica thus managed, with a football related to quality and spectacle, to overcome all rivals and add the unattainable score of 12 points.

The next tournament was held at the National Stadium in Tegucigalpa, from August 14 to 28, 1955, and was quite an event, since Guatemala withdrew after the incidents in the match against Costa Rica; the organizing committee first decided to award 2 points to all teams even though they had to play against Guatemala (Cuba, Honduras and Aruba) but following a protest from Curaçao and consultation with FIFA, it was decided on August 25 to annul all their results.

In the end, Costa Rica was the champion, winning 4 of the last 5 editions. Therefore, it qualified for the 1956 Panamerican Championship.

Havana (Cuba) took part in the IX Central American and Caribbean Football Championship between February and March 1960.

Costa Rica regained the championship title that it had lost in 1957, due to its absence from the tournament in Willemstad, Curaçao, and which on that occasion was passed on to Haiti.

The championship was played on that occasion in a single round, all against all, with the participation of Dutch Guiana, Honduras, the Netherlands Antilles, Costa Rica and the host country, Cuba, which was going through times of turmoil due to the recent revolutionary events of 1959, led by Fidel Castro.

At the end of the contest, Costa Rica and the Netherlands Antilles had six points. It was therefore necessary to hold an attractive playoff game.

The Ticos showed their hegemony and better football, and consequently, they defeated the team 4–0, thus the title once again remaining in Costa Rican territory. As an additional reward for this triumph, Costa Rica placed one of its forwards, Alberto Armijo, as the top scorer of the competition, with five goals.

No one was spared from Costa Rica&#x27;s artillery during the 10th Central American and Caribbean Football Championship, held in San José in March 1961. In seven matches in the first and second phases, they scored 32 goals against the enemy. The Costa Rican team&#x27;s performance, which earned them the title of the last Central American and Caribbean Championship held, was led by Juan Ulloa, author of ten victories in the competition.

An undefeated record that confirmed Costa Rica as the last champion of the regional competition. They won seven titles throughout their ten editions. An unforgettable era in which Costa Rican football was the strongest in the area.

==Results==
10 editions of the tournament were held.

<text>The Communist Party of Pakistan (CPP; Urdu: ) is a communist party in Pakistan founded in 1948 by Sajjad Zaheer.

==History==
The Communist Party of Pakistan (CPP) was founded in Calcutta, India, soon after the establishment of Pakistan on 6 March 1948. A decision was taken at the 2nd Congress of the Communist Party of India, which was held in Calcutta at that time, that a separate communist party ought to be created in the new state of Pakistan. It was thought that Pakistan, being a relatively nascent country and suffering from instability, was ripe for revolution. The delegates from Pakistan separated themselves and held a separate session where they constituted the CPP. Sajjad Zaheer, founder of the All-India Progressive Writers Association, from West Pakistan, was elected general-secretary. The delegates from East Pakistan elected an East Pakistan Provincial Committee. Many Muslim leaders of the CPI were sent to Pakistan to help with the formation of the party. The CPP adopted a Leninist ideology, aiming to instigate a communist revolution through a core group of intellectuals and laborers, a strategy inspired by Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s approach in the 1917 Russian Revolution.

The CPP was indirectly involved in organizing labor and student movements, notably founding the Democratic Students Federation (DSF), which became a major student organization. These affiliations were covert, with CPP members leading without explicit party endorsements.

In 1951, the CPP unintentionally became involved in a failed military coup attempt led by Major-General Akbar Khan, who was disenchanted with government decisions and influenced by Kemal Atatürk&#x27;s ideologies. The coup was discovered prematurely, resulting in the arrests and subsequent jailing of Zaheer and other CPP figures. The party was banned in 1954 on charges of plotting to overthrow the then government of Prime Minister Liaqat Ali Khan. Previously, Rawalpindi Conspiracy case was registered in 1951 against the coup plotters and crackdown was launched against its leadership throughout the country.

After the incident, the CPP operated underground, using organizations like the DSF and later the National Students Federation (NSF) as fronts. Through a strategy known as Entryism, CPP members infiltrated other leftist parties, notably the National Awami Party (NAP), which had emerged as a major leftist force in Pakistan by the 1960s, supported by ethnic nationalists and secret CPP members within.

==Struggles==
Diplomatic intervention by Jawaharlal Nehru led to the most prominent CPP leaders being freed and sent back to India. At this stage, the CPP was in poor shape in West Pakistan, while in East Pakistan the party had a limited foundation. However, it was difficult to have a unified underground political organization spanning such a vast geographical territory and the East Pakistan branch was able to operate with autonomy.

==1950s==
In the provincial elections in East Pakistan in 1954, the CPP supported the United Front launched by the Awami League, Krishak Praja Party, and the Nizam-e-Islam party. Four out of ten CPP candidates were elected, and 23 CPP members were elected as candidates of other parties.

In 1954, the party and its front organizations such as the National Students Federation, Progressive Writers&#x27; Movement and Railway Workers&#x27; Union were banned. As a result, the CPP launched the Azad Pakistan Party (APP) in West Pakistan with Mian Iftikhar-ud-Din as a leader. In 1957, the CPP and other leftists created the National Awami Party as a legal party. The APP merged into the NAP.

In East Pakistan, the CPP worked within the Awami League and then in Ganatantri Dal.
In 1958, the Kull Pakistan Kissan Association (All Pakistan Peasants Association) was launched.

==1960s==
In the mid-1960s, the US State Department estimated the party membership to be approximately 3000. The CPP also began to organize themselves abroad. In Europe, the CPP branch published the Urdu magazine &quot;Baghawat&quot;, which translates as &quot;rebellion&quot;.

In 1966, the Sino-Soviet split reached the CPP. In East Pakistan a pro-Chinese group broke away from the CPP.
At the fourth party congress in Dhaka in 1968, a decision was taken that a separate communist party should be formed for East Pakistan. Thus the Communist Party of East Pakistan (CPEP) was founded. The CPEP later became the Communist Party of Bangladesh.

The CPP organized a militant and armed peasants struggle in Patfeeder, Baluchistan. The CPP resisted the autocratic regimes of the times, and built up militant trade union movements.

==1990s==
In December 1990, Jam Saqi became general secretary of the party. In April 1991, he resigned from the party. In 1995, the CPP merged with the Major Ishaque faction of the Mazdoor Kissan Party to form the Communist Mazdoor Kissan Party (CMKP). The CPP accepted the criticism that they had been too uncritical towards the Soviet Union. However, in 1999, a group broke away from the CMKP and reconstituted the CPP. In 2002, the CPP split, leading to the existence of two separate CPPs, one led by Maula Bux Khaskheli and a splinter group led by Khadim Thaheem.

==Current status==

The party is not registered in Pakistan.

<text>This list of autonomous areas arranged by country gives an overview of autonomous areas of the world. An autonomous area is defined as an area of a country that has a degree of autonomy, or has freedom from an external authority. It is typical for it to be geographically distant from the country, or to be populated by a national minority. Countries that include autonomous areas are often federacies. The autonomous areas differ from federal units and independent states in the sense that they, in relation to the majority of other sub-national territories in the same country, enjoy a special status including some legislative powers, within the state (for a detailed list of federated units, see federated state).

This list includes areas that are internationally recognized, as well as some that are generally unrecognized. The definition of an &quot;autonomous area&quot; varies from country to country, so the native term as defined by the respective country&#x27;s government is listed, and the English translation of the term is included.


==Autonomous areas==
=== Created by international agreements ===
Notes:

* Svalbard, Norway: Although it does not fit the definition of &quot;autonomous area&quot; (not possessing partial internal sovereignty), Svalbard has the sovereignty of Norway limited by the &quot;Spitsbergen Treaty of 1920&quot; and therefore is considered as having special status (as it is considered fully integrated with Norway, and not a dependency, it is a &quot;sui generis&quot; case).
* Heligoland, Germany: Although it is part of a German state, Schleswig-Holstein, it has been excluded from some European Union normatives, such as customs union and the Value Added Tax Area.
* Büsingen am Hochrhein, Germany and Campione d&#x27;Italia, Italy: Despite being integral parts of their respective countries, these two enclaves of Switzerland predominantly use Swiss franc as currency and are in customs union with it.

===Created by internal statutes===
===Dependent and associated territories with autonomy===
===All sub-national regions are autonomous===

==Other entities called &quot;autonomous&quot;==
A number of entities are also officially called &quot;autonomous&quot;, though they do not have an exceptional freedom from external authority, and would not fall under the definition of autonomous area. They are listed here for clarity.

===Capitals called &quot;autonomous&quot;===
===Independent cities called &quot;autonomous&quot;===
===Self-declared entities called &quot;autonomous&quot; ===

<doc id="1027896" wikidata="Q994458" url="?curid=1027896" title="Chest hair">
<text>Chest hair is hair that grows on the chest in the region between the neck and the abdomen. Chest hair develops during and after puberty along with other types of androgenic hair.

== Development and growth ==
Although vellus hair is already present in the area in childhood, chest hair is the terminal hair that develops as an effect of rising levels of androgens (primarily testosterone and its derivatives) due to puberty. Different from the head hair, it is therefore a secondary sexual characteristic. Men tend to be covered with far more terminal hair, particularly on the chest, the abdomen, and the face.

The development of chest hair begins normally during late puberty, usually between the ages of 12 and 18. It can also start later, between the age of 20 and 30, so that many men in their twenties have not yet reached their full chest hair development. The growth continues subsequently.

== Patterns and characteristics ==
The individual occurrence and characteristics of chest hair depend on the genetic disposition, the hormonal status and the age of the person. The genes primarily determine the amount, patterns and thickness of chest hair. Some men are very hairy, while others have no chest hair at all. All ranges and patterns of hair growth are normal. The areas where terminal hair may grow are the periareolar areas (nipples), the centre and sides of the chest and the clavicle collarbone.

The direction of growth of hair can make for interesting patterns, akin to depictions of mathematical vector fields. Typical males will exhibit a node on the upper sternum, the hair above which points up and the hair below which points down. Some individuals have spirals on their upper pectoral regions (several inches from the nipple towards the neck) which run clockwise on the left breast and counter-clockwise on the right.

Considering an individual occurrence of chest hair as abnormal is usually not due to medical indications but primarily to cultural and social attitudes. An excessive growth of terminal hair on the body is called hypertrichosis. This medical term has to be distinguished from hirsutism that just affects women. These women can develop terminal hair on the chest following the male pattern as a symptom of an endocrine disease.

=== Setty patterns ===
There have been occasional studies documenting patterns of chest hair in men and occurrence of these patterns. A study of 1,400 white men aged 17 to 71 conducted by L.R. Setty in the 1960s defines 15 patterns of chest hair. In this study, four parts of the chest in which terminal hair occurs were identified:

Chest hair may occur on each of these areas independent from the others, making for a total of 15 combinations in addition to the &quot;apilose&quot; (bare) pattern. Hair is said to occur on both the pectoral and circumareolar areas when there is hair around the nipples and on the breast, but these areas are not connected.

The &quot;pecto-sterno-infraclavicular&quot; pattern, in which the breast, sternum and medial end of the clavicle is covered with terminal hair, is most common (57%).

<doc id="1027904" wikidata="Q563379" url="?curid=1027904" title="Tsai Wan-lin">
<text>Tsai Wan-lin (; 10 November 1924 – 27 September 2004) was a Taiwanese businessman who, at the peak of his wealth in 1996, was considered to be the fifth richest person in the world, with a family net worth of US$12.2 billion. At the time of his death in 2004, he was the richest man in Taiwan with a fortune of US$4.6 billion (NT$156.3 billion), ranked 94th worldwide. He founded the Lin Yuan Group, a large banking and insurance group.

He was born into a poor farmer&#x27;s family in Chikunan Town, Chikunan District, Shinchiku Prefecture, Japanese-era Taiwan (modern-day Zhunan, Miaoli County). Tsai started out in Taipei by selling vegetables and soybeans with his brothers as a child.

With one of his brothers Tsai joined Taipei&#x27;s Tenth Credit Cooperative in 1960. Two years later, they founded Cathay Life Insurance, which at the time of his death was the largest life insurance company in Taiwan. Tenth Credit Cooperative was eventually transferred to Tsai Wan-lin&#x27;s nephew Tsai Chen-chou.

The family split Cathay Life Insurance in 1979. Tsai Wan-lin founded the Lin Yuan Group with his share. Over the next 10 years, the Lin Yuan Group expanded to become the largest Taiwanese conglomerate. Cathay Financial Holdings, a division of the Lin Yuan Group, became Taiwan&#x27;s largest financial holding company. Cathay Insurance was renamed Fubon Insurance in 1992.

Tsai was first listed by Forbes as a billionaire in 1987. He was appointed a senior adviser to the president of the Republic of China in 2000.

He died of heart disease at the age of 81 in Taipei&#x27;s Cathay General Hospital, which he founded in 1977. He had been hospitalized for six years. Tsai was married to Chou Pao-chin and had seven children.

<doc id="1027910" wikidata="Q358090" url="?curid=1027910" title="Adler (surname)">
<text>Adler is a surname of German origin meaning &quot;eagle.&quot; and has a frequency in the United Kingdom of less than 0.004%, and of 0.008% in the United States.
In Christian iconography, the eagle is the symbol of John the Evangelist, and as such a stylized eagle was commonly used as a house sign/totem in German-speaking areas. From the tenement the term easily moved to its inhabitants, particularly to those having only one name. This phenomenon can be easily seen in German and Austrian censuses from the 16th and 17th centuries.

<text>James Bezan (born May 19, 1965) is a Conservative Canadian politician who has represented the riding of Selkirk—Interlake—Eastman (formerly Selkirk—Interlake) in the House of Commons of Canada since 2004. He is currently the Conservative Shadow Minister for National Defence.

==Early life and career==
Bezan was born May 19, 1965, in Russell, Manitoba Bezan majored in livestock technology in Olds College&#x27;s Agricultural Production program. Bezan worked in the livestock and cattle industries in the 1980s and 1990s and started his own company in 1996. He served as Chief Executive Officer of the Manitoba Cattle Producer&#x27;s Association and has sat on boards in the fields of cattle and food production. He also operates a family farm near Teulon, Manitoba.

==Federal politics==
Bezan was first elected in the riding of Selkirk—Interlake in the 2004 federal election, and was re-elected in the 2006, 2008, 2011, 2015, 2019 federal elections and 2021 federal elections.

In opposition, Bezan served on the executive of the Canada-Europe Parliamentary Association and as the Conservative Associate Agriculture Critic.

In the 38th Canadian Parliament, Bezan tabled Motion M-309 which sought to increase benefits for parents of critically ill children. This motion became law within Government Bill C-44 in 2012 which proposes a new Employment Insurance (EI) special benefit for parents who take time off work to care for their critically ill or injured children.

=== In government ===
In the 2006 federal election, Bezan was re-elected, defeating former Manitoba premier and Governor General of Canada Ed Schreyer, who ran for the New Democratic Party.

Between 2006 and 2015 as a member of government, Bezan has served as Chair of the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food; Chair of the Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development; Chair of the Manitoba Conservative Caucus; Chair of the Canadian Section of the Inter-Parliamentary Forum of the Americas (FIPA); and Secretary of the Canada-Ukraine Parliamentary Friendship Group.

Bezan has advocated marketing choice for Western Canadian grain farmers and fishermen. As a longtime and outspoken opponent of the long-gun registry, Bezan was pleased when the registry was ended. Bezan has also been instrumental in securing over $35 million in funding for the Lake Winnipeg Basin Initiative in Budgets 2007 and 2012.

In the 39th Canadian Parliament, Bezan passed Private Member&#x27;s Bill C-459, which established the Ukrainian Famine and Genocide Memorial Day and recognizes the Ukrainian Famine of 1932-33, the Holodomor, as an act of genocide. Bezan was awarded the Order of Prince Yaroslav the Wise, Ukraine&#x27;s highest civilian award, by the President of Ukraine.

Bezan&#x27;s wife Kelly has survived melanoma skin cancer on a number of occasions. Bezan, who also used artificial tanning equipment, tabled a Private Member&#x27;s Bill, C-497 in the 40th Canadian Parliament, to strengthen warning labelling on tanning beds on the carcinogenic risks from radiation caused by tanning equipment.

In the first session of the 41st Parliament, Bezan served as the Chair of the Standing Committee on National Defence and was elected as the Vice President of the Canada-Ukraine Parliamentary Friendship Group and executive member for the Canadian Section of ParlAmericas. During the 41st Parliament, Bezan founded and co-chairs the Canadian Parliamentarians for Democracy and Human Rights in Iran, which is an all-party group.

In the 41st Canadian Parliament, Bezan introduced two pieces of legislation. The first was the Tanning Equipment Prohibition and Warning (Cancer Risks) Act (Bill C-386). This Bill influenced the Government to put warning labels about the health risks of indoor tanning on tanning equipment in February 2013. In February 2013, Bezan tabled Bill C-478, The Respecting Families of Murdered and Brutalized Persons Act. This Bill seeks to extend the parole eligibility period for those convicted of the abduction, sexual assault and murder of an individual.

On September 19, 2013, Bezan was appointed by Prime Minister Stephen Harper as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of National Defence. He began the 2nd session of the 41st Parliament with this role.

While serving in Her/His Majesty&#x27;s Loyal Opposition since 2015, Bezan has served as the Shadow Minister for National Defence, the Deputy Official Opposition Whip, Co-coordinator for Question Period Planning and Shadow Minister for Ethics.

Throughout his time in Parliament, Bezan has worked on Ukrainian and Iranian human rights and democracy issues. Bezan travelled with Prime Minister Harper to Ukraine in 2010 and 2015 and has served as an election monitor in the last four Ukrainian elections. Bezan lobbied to have the Iranian embassy shut down and have the MeK delisted as a terrorist organization. Both of these actions by Bezan were acted upon by the Government of Canada during the 41st Canadian Parliament.

Bezan was one of thirteen Canadians banned from travelling to Russia under retaliatory sanctions imposed by Russian President Vladimir Putin in March 2014. He replied through his official Twitter feed, &quot;Sanctions by Russia will not silence me standing up for Ukraine. This is a badge of honour for all critics of the Crimea Invasion.&quot;

===Elections Canada dispute===
The Speaker of the House of Commons received a request from Elections Canada to suspend Bezan as a member of Parliament (MP) in June 2013 over an alleged failure to properly claim the cost of advertising signage he erected while MP. The Speaker made a ruling on June 18, 2013, in response to a question of privilege, to have the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs (PROC) review this issue. On February 5, 2014, Bezan and Elections Canada came to an agreement on a corrected campaign return. In a statement on his website, he said:
I am pleased to say that Elections Canada has agreed with the commercial value of my MP signs I submitted in my corrected campaign return on May 5, 2013 at $518 per sign. My final campaign return for the 2011 election is below the allowable election expense limit, and my personal contributions are also below the allowable limit. As a matter of fact, the total difference between my corrected return filed on May 5, 2013 and my final return is only $458.&quot;

<text>The Timan-Pechora Basin is a sedimentary basin located between Timan Ridge and the Ural Mountains in northern Russia. The basin contains oil and gas fields.

== Oil and gas extraction ==
A planned project to mine its oil and gas was conceived in the mid-1990s and approved by United States and Russian Governments. As of September 29, 2004, Conoco and LUKoil planned to jointly develop this Basin.

Since 2004 the production increased and the importance for LUKoil increased. However, the production began to decline in 2010. Large investments are needed to increase production rates or at least to maintain production at levels over 17 million tons annually.

Oil extraction has produced limited environmental damage. In particular it has caused eutrophication and organic contamination of waters as interpreted from low diatom diversity and absence of pollution sensitive diatoms among other things. Possibly oil extraction is also behind lower avian diversity at some locations as transport activity might have disturbed wildlife. Despite this much of the Pechora region can be described as &quot;semi-pristine&quot; from an ecological point of view.

In a 2018 assessment, the United States Geological Survey estimated for undiscovered, technically recoverable continuous resources, the mean totals for the region are 1,425 million barrels of shale oil, or 1.4 billion barrels of oil; 45,721 billion cubic feet, or 46 trillion cubic feet of gas; and 737 million barrels of natural gas liquids.

<doc id="1027922" wikidata="Q214771" url="?curid=1027922" title="Elfen Lied">
<text>is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Lynn Okamoto. It was serialized in Shueisha&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Weekly Young Jump&quot; from June 2002 to August 2005, with its 107 chapters collected into twelve volumes. &quot;Elfen Lied&quot; revolves around the interactions, views, emotions, and differences between human beings and the Diclonii, a mutant species similar to humans in build but distinguishable by two horns on their heads and &quot;vectors&quot;, transparent telekinetically controlled arms that have the power to manipulate and cut objects within their reach. The series is centered on the teenage Diclonius girl &quot;Lucy&quot; who was rejected by human beings and subsequently wants revenge.

The series takes its name from the poem &quot;Elfenlied&quot;, German for &quot;song of the fairies&quot;, which is featured in the story. &quot;Elfen Lied&quot; involves themes of discrimination, social alienation, identity, prejudice, revenge, abuse, jealousy, regret, and the value of humanity. It is also noted for the graphic violence, emotional themes of how the characters change through, and the overall transgressive subject matter of the whole story.

A 13-episode anime television series adaptation was produced by the studio Arms and broadcast on AT-X from July to October 2004. The anime finished airing before the manga was complete; as a result, the plot differed between the two, especially the ending. The manga is licensed in North America by Dark Horse Comics. The anime series has been licensed in North America by ADV Films and in Australia by Madman Entertainment.

==Plot and characters==

&quot;Elfen Lied&quot; takes place in Kamakura and Kanagawa, and focuses on the &quot;Diclonius&quot;, a newly mutated species. Their appearance is similar to humans, but with several differences, namely horn-like protrusions on the forehead, the presence of telekinetic invisible arms called &quot;vectors&quot; and unconventional hair colour. One such Diclonius, Lucy, is the main character of the series: Initially held in a facility built for experimentation, located off the coast of Kamakura, she manages to escape and wreak havoc, but is injured in the process, an event which causes her to develop a secondary, childlike personality known as Nyu.

Lucy is found by two locals, Kouta and his cousin Yuka, who study at the local university. They take her in and become involved with the numerous, often brutal, attempts to recapture her by a Special Assault Team and a number of other Diclonius, who shift frequently from oblivious to murderous.

===Diclonius===
Much of the plot of &quot;Elfen Lied&quot; revolves around the Diclonii species, which strongly resemble humans; the only obvious difference is the two horn-like protrusions extending from the temporal bone and parietal bone regions of the skull.

Diclonii powers involve the use of invisible arms, known as &quot;vectors&quot;, that can grasp and impact things as if they are solid, but also become insubstantial and pass through objects. They can slice objects as well, which is how Diclonii usually kill their victims. Vectors usually have a limited range of a few meters, but the length varies among each Diclonius. Diclonii also demonstrate the ability to sense one another.

A key point of debate throughout the series is the Diclonius propensity towards violence. Many have a vendetta against humans, and have ambitions to wipe out the human race and populate the world with their own species. It is disputed and contradicted during the series as to how Diclonii develop their violent behavior, whether it is part of their genetic code or whether it stems from abuse by humans.

If a Diclonius vector penetrates or even so much as touches a human male body, the &quot;vector virus&quot; is transferred to the human, causing their children to be born as Diclonii (when born from infected humans, they are called &quot;Silpelits&quot;). An incident involving the escape of a child Diclonius during Kurama&#x27;s early years, where the Diclonius&#x27; vectors penetrated him without causing him pain, resulted in Mariko being born a Diclonius and Kurama taking precautions against a recurrence by urging Bando to be sterilized. All Silpelits are sterile, female and age rapidly. There&#x27;s only one Diclonius that is actually capable of reproducing: Lucy, the &quot;queen&quot;.

==Production==
===Anime===
When &quot;Elfen Lied&quot; was being adapted into an anime series, director Mamoru Kanbe was recommended to work on the series by the series composer, Takao Yoshioka. Yoshioka believed that Kanbe&#x27;s general drawing style and composition would be ideal to adapt the manga, still in publication at the time, into an anime series. Kanbe himself, originally reluctant about joining the production, gained interest in it upon reading the manga.

While the manga was still ongoing at the time, Kanbe and the production team were forced to condense the plot of the series into thirteen episodes, even though they felt it was necessary to make more as several significant plot details in the manga which Kanbe felt he could have used to make the series more emotive were left out.

According to Kanbe, he considered &quot;Elfen Lied&quot; as a &quot;love story,&quot; and he wanted to &quot;bring viewers to tears.&quot; Thus, he made attempts throughout the series to provide a contrast of emotions, commenting that he could make the violence exemplify this throughout the series. The production team were originally surprised by Okamoto&#x27;s choice of Kamakura as a setting for the series; however, after several visits to the area, Kanbe commented that the setting in Kamakura was, according to the production team, ideal for the poignant and reflective drama in the series to unfold, as its general tranquility and geography made for a reflective and yet eerie, deep-meaning backdrop to the series. This can be seen in several examples, such as on top of a set of steps overlooking the coastline, where many of the interactions between characters take place. This is used as an important device in conveying the ideas of memory and emotional association, such as the contrast between Kohta and Lucy&#x27;s conversation when they were ten years old in comparison with their conversation in the final episode.

====Style and themes====
In comments made by director Mamoru Kanbe on the &quot;Elfen Lied&quot; website, he stated that he intended for the anime to question and discuss values relating to the way in which humans divide each other by difference, as well as the belief that atrocities such as those committed by Lucy in the series are strongly influenced by the way in which people are treated by their fellow beings. The series frequently discusses the events and treatment which define the human character in such a way, and the problems which arise from discrimination, as well as the wild contrasts between compassion and vengeance between fellow humans, through the strong vengeance of Lucy compared with her past memory of Kohta. Many of the themes are mentioned in the teasers at the ends of episodes.

Themes such as genocide and the attempts to &quot;purify&quot; the earth from each other also appear in the anime. Both Diclonius and the human species feel the need to populate the earth with their own and wipe the other out. Kanbe quoted this in relation to the desire of humans to cast each other out and segregate one another.

Throughout the series, there is a great deal of blood and gore, graphic violence as well as psychological violence. One of the most prevalent motifs of the series is the humanity of the Diclonius, especially contrasted against the inhumanity of ordinary people. One reviewer described the series as &quot;devoted to quite a few of the darker, more callous factors of human nature.&quot; Throughout the series, there are various incidences of casual beatings, cruel experimentation, and outright killing. Also, animal cruelty is present when three young boys mercilessly beat Lucy&#x27;s puppy until it dies; though the act is off-screen, a copious amount of blood is shown; which drives Lucy to murder the bullies out of revenge and insanity.

 Most of the episodes contain graphic violence, including instances of torture and at one point the series addresses the consequences of the rape of a child. The series also includes scenes that present female nudity and strong language (specifically in the English dub). The series juxtaposes many different tones and genres and was described by Bamboo Dong of Anime News Network as &quot;mixing insane amounts of violence with a heavy dose of ultracuteness.&quot; The series balances its darker themes with romantic sub-plots as well as many comic moments. &quot;Elfen Lied&quot; has been described as similar to, or borrowing elements from &quot;Chobits&quot;, &quot;3×3 Eyes&quot; and &quot;Gunslinger Girl&quot;.

====Cultural references====
The opening and ending sequences feature artistic drawings of the principal characters. These characters are drawn in a style based on Gustav Klimt&#x27;s paintings, including &quot;The Kiss&quot;, &quot;Adele Bloch-Bauer I&quot;, and others with similar imitating poses, colors, and patterns. In promotional art as well as in the series itself, characters make use of a famous El Greco hand symbol of outstretched fingers with the middle and ring fingers connected. The song &quot;Elfenlied&quot; (&quot;Elf Song&quot;) appears in the manga and is credited to the composer Hugo Wolf. A poem by Eduard Mörike is the basis for Wolf&#x27;s version. It is taught to Nyu by the manga-only protagonist Nozomi. In the manga, the Diclonius are kept in a grotto called the Lebensborn Cave, a reference to the Nazi eugenics program.

==Media==
===Manga===

Written and illustrated by Lynn Okamoto, &quot;Elfen Lied&quot; was serialized in Shueisha&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Weekly Young Jump&quot; from June 6, 2002, to August 25, 2005. Shueisha collected its 107 chapters in twelve volumes, released from October 18, 2002, to November 18, 2005.

In North America, the manga was licensed for English release by Dark Horse Comics. They released it in a four-volume omnibus edition from May 22, 2019, to September 9, 2020.

===Anime===

A 13-episode anime television series adaptation was directed by Mamoru Kanbe, animated by Arms and produced by Genco and VAP. Author Lynn Okamoto has a brief cameo appearance in episode 12. &quot;Elfen Lied&quot; first aired on TV Tokyo&#x27;s AT-X satellite channel from July 25 to October 17, 2004, and was broadcast again in 2005. A single twenty-four-minute original video animation (OVA) episode was released by VAP on April 21, 2005. It takes place somewhere within the timespan of the series&#x27; eleventh episode.

The anime&#x27;s opening theme song is &quot;Lilium&quot;, performed by opera singer , sung in Latin, with lyrics extracted from biblical passages and Christian sources, including the Book of Psalms, the Epistle of James, the Kyrie prayer, and the hymn &quot;Ave mundi spes Maria&quot;. The ending theme song is &quot;Be Your Girl&quot; by Chieko Kawabe.

;Home media and distribution
The series was released on Blu-ray in Japan on December 19, 2012.

The anime was licensed by ADV Films in the United States in 2004 and released on DVD in 2005. ADV said the series was one of their bestselling and &quot;most notorious&quot; releases of 2005. During the &quot;Anime Boston 2006&quot; convention, ADV announced the distribution rights of the OVA in the United States. However, the OVA was never released on television and was not included with the box set released by ADV Films in November 2006 or in the &quot;Complete Collection&quot; DVDs released in June 2009 and December 2011. When ADV divided their assets, &quot;Elfen Lied&quot; remained with them and in-print. A Blu-ray box set (as well as a new DVD set) was released on September 3, 2013, by ADV and Section23 Films, making it the only Blu-ray release under the ADV brand, and contains the previously released OVA. In Australia, the series was licensed by Madman Entertainment.

The series aired in the United Kingdom on Propeller TV (Sky) as part of Anime Network&#x27;s short-lived launch in the United Kingdom. The series also aired uncut despite a stricter censorship standard imposed by OFCOM on UK cable TV. The Anime Network is streaming the series On Demand in English, German and French. The ADV DVD box set confirms a rating of TV-MA SV; the Canadian rating is 14A.

In a post to the now defunct official Adult Swim message board in April 2006, programming director Kim Manning revealed that despite the series&#x27; high level of controversial content, the network inquired into the possibility of airing, as Manning was an avid fan herself and watched the entire series in one sitting. However, the channel&#x27;s Broadcast Standards and Practices department would have required the series to be so extensively edited (&quot;it would have been cut to shreds&quot;, she described in the post) in order to air that it would have been &quot;unintelligible&quot;. Ultimately, Adult Swim decided not to air it to preserve and respect the series&#x27; original quality.

==Reception==
Reviewing the first English omnibus volume of &quot;Elfen Lied&quot;, Anime UK News gave it an 8 out of 10 rating and noted that it is much more detailed than the anime adaptation by explaining what Diclonius are and showing more of the characters&#x27; inner thoughts. Although, they stated that the beginning of the anime had &quot;more punch.&quot; Anime UK News criticized Okamoto&#x27;s art as poor throughout the book, but enjoyed the extra unrelated stories included at the end. Comic Buzz gave a 9/10 score, calling it a &quot;great read from start to finish&quot;. They felt the art style changed with the characters&#x27; emotions and said it reminded them variously of &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; and the work of Junji Ito. Rai of TheOASG gave the omnibus a 3 out of 5 star rating, criticizing the art and fan service, and overall preferred the anime which she acknowledged having bias for.

Reception for the anime was generally mixed to positive. Reviewers such as Tasha Robinson of &quot;Sci Fi Weekly&quot; and Theron Martin of &quot;Anime News Network&quot; praised &quot;Elfen Lied&quot; for its story and technical excellence in production quality, animation and color. Due to the many scenes of nudity and gore, Dominic Laeno of &quot;THEM Anime Reviews&quot; criticized the series as being &quot;overly blatant.&quot; Martin criticized the anime for having &quot;sub-par voice acting&quot; in both the original Japanese audio track and the English dub, although he gave an &quot;A−&quot; rating for both language dubs. Martin also said that the series &quot;ends abruptly with some loose ends to the story that could leave viewers unsatisfied,&quot; but also called it &quot;a horror series of exceptional merit.&quot; Laeno called the series &quot;a genuinely good watch.&quot; Stig Høgset, also of &quot;THEM Anime Reviews&quot;, called &quot;Elfen Lied&quot; &quot;a very special show, good and bad parts taken into consideration.&quot;

On June 12, 2015, the now-defunct Chinese Ministry of Culture listed &quot;Elfen Lied&quot; among 38 anime and manga titles banned in China.

==Legacy==
Matt and Ross Duffer have cited &quot;Elfen Lied&quot; as an influence on their 2016 Netflix series &quot;Stranger Things&quot;. They said that &quot;Elfen Lied&quot; was like an &quot;ultraviolent &quot;E.T.&quot;&quot; and noted that the character Eleven was inspired by the anime. Another cited influence was the 1988 anime film &quot;Akira&quot;, which they felt had in turn influenced &quot;Elfen Lied&quot;.

The anime opening theme &quot;Lilium&quot;, with its Latin lyrics extracted from biblical sources, is sometimes sung as a hymn in churches around the world, including in countries such as Ukraine, Sweden, Brazil, and Chile.

<doc id="1027923" wikidata="Q84455" url="?curid=1027923" title="Ödön von Horváth">
<text>Edmund Josef von Horváth (9 December 1901, in Sušak, Rijeka, Austro-Hungarian Empire – 1 June 1938, in Paris, French Third Republic) was an Austro-Hungarian playwright and novelist who wrote in German, and went by the &quot;nom de plume&quot; Ödön von Horváth (). He was one of the most critically admired writers of his generation prior to his untimely death. He enjoyed a series of successes on the stage with socially poignant and romantic plays, including &quot;Revolte auf Côte 3018&quot; (1927), &quot;Sladek&quot; (1929), &quot;Italienische Nacht&quot; (1930), &quot;Hin und Her&quot; (1934), and &quot;Der Jüngste Tag&quot; (1937). His novels include &quot;Der ewige Spießer&quot; (1930), &quot;Ein Kind unserer Zeit&quot; (1938), and &quot;Jugend ohne Gott&quot; (1938).

==Early life and education==
Ödön von Horváth was the eldest son of an Austro-Hungarian diplomat of Hungarian origins from Slavonia, Edmund (Ödön) Josef Horváth, and Maria Lulu Hermine (Prehnal) Horváth, who was from an Austro-Hungarian military family.

From 1908, Ödön attended elementary school in Budapest, and later attended the &quot;Rákóczianum&quot;, where his education was in the Hungarian language. In 1909, his father was ennobled and assigned to Munich, unaccompanied. In 1913, Horváth attended secondary school in Pressburg and Vienna, where he learned German as a second language, and earned the &quot;Matura&quot; (secondary school diploma) then reunited with his parents at Murnau am Staffelsee, in Upper Bavaria; from 1919, Horváth studied at the Ludwig Maximilians University, in Munich.

==Later life and death==
He started writing as a student, from 1920. After quitting university without a degree in early 1922, he moved to Berlin. Later, he lived in Salzburg and Murnau am Staffelsee. In 1931, he was awarded, along with Erik Reger, the Kleist Prize. In 1933, at the beginning of the Nazi regime in Germany, he relocated to Vienna. Following the annexation of the Federal State of Austria with Nazi Germany in 1938, Horváth emigrated to Paris.

Horváth was hit by a falling branch from a tree and killed during a thunderstorm on the Champs-Élysées in Paris, opposite the &quot;Théâtre Marigny&quot;, in June 1938. Ironically, only a few days earlier, Horváth had said to a friend: &quot;I am not so afraid of the Nazis...There are worse things one can be afraid of, namely things one is afraid of without knowing why. For instance, I am afraid of streets. Roads can be hostile to one, can destroy one. Streets scare me.&quot; And a few years earlier, Horváth had written poetry about lightning: &quot;Yes, thunder, that it can do. And bolt and storm. Terror and destruction.&quot;

Horváth was buried in the Saint-Ouen Cemetery, in northern Paris. In 1988, on the 50th anniversary of his death, his remains were transferred to Vienna and reinterred at the Heiligenstädter Friedhof.

==Literary themes==

Important topics in Horváth&#x27;s works were popular culture, politics, and history. He especially tried to warn of the rise of Fascism in Europe and its dangers. Among Horváth&#x27;s more enduringly popular works, &quot;&quot; (&quot;Youth Without God&quot;) describes the youth in Nazi Germany from the point of view of a disgruntled teacher who initially is an opportunist but is helpless against the racist and militaristic Nazi propaganda that dehumanizes his pupils.

The English title of his novel &quot;Ein Kind unserer Zeit&quot; (&quot;A Child of Our Time&quot;) was used by Michael Tippett for his oratorio (1939–1941), composed during World War II.

== Quotes ==
A few select quotes amongst many by Horváth:
*&quot;Nothing conveys the feeling of infinity as much as stupidity does.&quot; (Motto of &quot;Geschichten aus dem Wienerwald&quot;)
*&quot;Eigentlich bin ich ganz anders, nur komme ich so selten dazu.&quot; &quot;Actually what I&#x27;m really like is very different. I just so rarely find time for it.&quot; (From &quot;Zur schönen Aussicht&quot;)
*Ödön von Horváth was once walking in the Bavarian Alps when he discovered the skeleton of a long dead man with his knapsack still intact. Von Horváth opened the knapsack and found a postcard reading &quot;Having a wonderful time&quot;. Asked by friends what he did with it, von Horváth replied &quot;I posted it&quot;.
*&quot;If you ask me what is my native country, I answer: I was born in Fiume, grew up in Belgrade, Budapest, Pressburg (Bratislava), Vienna and Munich, and I have a Hungarian passport, but I have no fatherland. I am a very typical mix of old Austria-Hungary: at once Magyar, Croatian, German and Czech; my country is Hungary; my mother tongue is German.&quot;

==In popular culture==
*Christopher Hampton&#x27;s play &quot;Tales from Hollywood&quot; (1982, adapted for television in 1992) portrays a fictional Horváth. He survives the falling branch and moves to the United States, where expatriate German authors such as Bertolt Brecht and Heinrich Mann write for the motion picture industry.
*Danilo Kiš&#x27;s short story &quot;The Man Without a Country&quot;, published in the 1994 collection &quot;The Lute and The Scars&quot;, fictionalizes the death of Horváth.
*Duncan Macmillan adapted Horváth&#x27;s &quot;Don Juan Comes Back From The War&quot; for the National Theatre Studio and Finborough Theatre in 2012. The updated production used contemporary language to explore the effects of conflict and trauma. It was directed by Andrea Ferran.
*Lydia Davis&#x27; short story &quot;Ödön von Horváth Out Walking,&quot; published in the 2014 collection &quot;Can&#x27;t and Won&#x27;t,&quot; concerns Horváth&#x27;s encounter with the skeleton in the Alps.

<text>&quot;Old Folks at Home&quot; (also known as &quot;[[Suwannee River|Swanee River]]&quot;) is a folk song written by Stephen Foster in 1851. Since 1935, it has been the official state song of Florida, although in 2008 the original lyrics were revised. It is Roud Folk Song Index no. 13880.

==Composition==

&quot;Old Folks at Home&quot; was commissioned in 1851 by E. P. Christy for use by Christy&#x27;s Minstrels, his minstrel troupe. Christy also asked to be credited as the song&#x27;s creator, and was so credited on early sheet music printings. As a result, while the song was a success, Foster did not directly profit much from it, though he continued to receive royalties for the song.

Foster had composed most of the lyrics but was struggling to name the river of the opening line, and asked his brother, Morrison, to suggest one. Morrison wrote, “One day in 1851, Stephen came into my office, on the bank of the Monongahela, Pittsburgh, and said to me, ‘What is a good name of two syllables for a Southern river? I want to use it in this new song of &quot;Old Folks at Home&quot;.’ I asked him how Yazoo would do. ‘Oh,’ said he, ‘that has been used before.’ I then suggested Pedee. ‘Oh, pshaw,’ he replied, ‘I won’t have that.’ I then took down an atlas from the top of my desk and opened the map of the United States. We both looked over it and my finger stopped at the ‘Swanee,’ a little river in Florida emptying into the Gulf of Mexico. ‘That’s it, that’s it exactly,’ exclaimed he delighted, as he wrote the name down; and the song was finished, commencing, ‘Way Down Upon de Swanee Ribber.’ He left the office, as was his custom, abruptly, without saying another word, and I resumed my work.” Foster himself never saw the Suwannee, or even visited Florida, but nevertheless Florida made &quot;Old Folks At Home&quot; its state song in 1935, replacing &quot;Florida, My Florida&quot;. Despite the song&#x27;s popularity during the era, few people outside of Florida actually knew where the Suwannee River was, or that it was even a real place.

Antonín Dvořák&#x27;s &quot;Humoresque No. 7&quot;, written in the 1890s, is musically similar and is sometimes played along with &quot;Old Folks at Home&quot;. The Library of Congress&#x27;s National Jukebox presents a version with soprano Alma Gluck and violinist Efrem Zimbalist Sr.
Jean Arthur and Gary Cooper sing a duet of &quot;Old Folks at Home&quot; combined with &quot;Humoresques (Dvořák)|Humoresque No. 7&quot; in the 1936 film &quot;Mr. Deeds Goes to Town&quot;.

==Lyrics revisions==

Written in the first person from the perspective and in the dialect of an African slave (at a time when slavery was legal in 15 of the states of the US), the song&#x27;s narrator states &quot;longing for de old plantation&quot;, which has been criticized as romanticizing slavery. On the other hand, a longing for the &quot;old folks at home&quot; has sometimes been interpreted, for example, by W. E. B. Du Bois in &quot;The Souls of Black Folk&quot; (1903), as a longing for the people and traditions of Africa, where most of the human beings enslaved in the New World had been free before they were kidnapped and shipped across the Atlantic Ocean in the Atlantic slave trade. The word, &quot;darkies&quot;, used in Foster&#x27;s lyrics, has been amended; for example, &quot;brothers&quot; was sung in place of &quot;darkies&quot; at the dedication of the new Florida state capitol building in 1978. In general, at public performances another word like &quot;lordy&quot;, &quot;mama&quot;, &quot;darling&quot;, &quot;brothers&quot;, &quot;children&quot;, or &quot;dear ones&quot; is typically substituted.

In practice, the pronunciation, as written in dialect, has long been disregarded in favor of the corresponding standard American English usage, as demonstrated by the song&#x27;s performances at the 1955 Florida Folk Festival.

===State song of Florida===

As the official state song of Florida, &quot;Old Folks at Home&quot; has traditionally been sung as part of a Florida governor&#x27;s inauguration ceremony. However, over time, the lyrics were progressively altered to be less offensive; as Diane Roberts observed:
Florida got enlightened in 1978; we substituted &quot;brothers&quot; for &quot;darkies&quot;. There were subsequent revisions. At Jeb Bush&#x27;s second inauguration as governor in 2003, a young black woman gave a moving, nondialect rendition of &quot;Old Folks at Home&quot;, except &quot;still longing for the old plantation&quot; came out &quot;still longing for my old connection&quot;. Perhaps someone confused Stephen Foster&#x27;s lyrics with a cell phone commercial.

In his 2007 inauguration ceremony, Charlie Crist decided not to include the state song, but rather to use in its place &quot;The Florida Song&quot;, a composition written by black Floridian jazz musician Charles Atkins. Crist then encouraged state Senator Tony Hill, who was the leader of the legislature&#x27;s Black Caucus, to find a new song. Hill joined forces with state Representative Ed Homan and the Florida Music Education Association to sponsor a contest for a new state song.

On January 11, 2008, the song &quot;Florida (Where the Sawgrass Meets the Sky)&quot; was selected as the winner. The Florida Legislature considered the issue and ultimately adopted it as the state anthem while retaining &quot;Old Folks at Home&quot; as the state song, replacing its original lyrics with a revised version approved by scholars at the Stephen Foster Memorial. Governor Crist stated that he was not pleased by the &quot;two songs&quot; decision; but he signed the bill, creating a new state anthem and establishing the reworded version of the state song by statute, rather than by resolution like the 1935 decision.

==Notable recordings==
Joel Whitburn identifies early successful recordings by Len Spencer (1892), Vess Ossman (1900), Haydn Quartet (1904), Louise Homer (1905), 
Alma Gluck (1915), Taylor Trio (1916) and by Oscar Seagle and Columbia Stellar Quartet (1919).

The song enjoyed a revival in the 1930s with versions by Jimmie Lunceford and by Bunny Berigan. Bing Crosby sang the song in the 1935 movie &quot;Mississippi&quot; and also recorded the song commercially the same year.

Ray Charles used it as an inspiration for his 1957 remake of the song on the Atlantic label, entitled: &quot;Swanee River Rock (Talkin&#x27; &#x27;Bout That River)&quot;.

Kenny Ball And His Jazzmen recorded a swing version of the song (using only the first verse and chorus twice over and substituting &quot;Lordy&quot; for &quot;darkies&quot;) in 1962 for Pye Records. The recording appeared on the B side of their 1963 single &quot;Sukiyaki&quot;. Another swing version was recorded by Hugh Laurie (2011).

Tony Sheridan recorded it in 1962 on the Polydor label as a Rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll song with his backing band The Beat Brothers issued on his album &quot;My Bonnie&quot;. Another version was also done for him that same year by the Beatles but this recording was lost.

The Beach Boys recorded it in 1963 with changed lyrics as &quot;South Bay Surfer&quot;, after Brian Wilson had recorded it with The Honeys in yet another iteration, as &quot;Surfin&#x27; Down the Swanee River&quot;. The Beach Boys would later revisit it as an instrumental intro to &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot; during the recording sessions for their 1968 20/20 album, which wouldn&#x27;t make the final cut.

Larry Groce sang the song on Disney Children&#x27;s Favorite Songs 2 in 1979, omitting the second verse.

<text>Thrilling Cities is the title of a travelogue by the James Bond author and &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; journalist Ian Fleming. The book was first published in the UK in November 1963 by Jonathan Cape. The cities covered by Fleming were Hong Kong, Macau, Tokyo, Honolulu, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Chicago, New York, Hamburg, Berlin, Vienna, Geneva, Naples and Monte Carlo.

&quot;Thrilling Cities&quot; was initially a series of articles Fleming wrote for &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, based on two trips he took. The first trip was in 1959, in which he travelled around the world, and the second was in 1960, in which he drove around Europe. The first trip was at the behest of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;″s features editor Leonard Russell; the paper&#x27;s chairman, Roy Thomson, enjoyed the series so much he requested Fleming undertake a second trip. The book version includes material edited out of the original articles, as well as photographs of the various cities.

==Synopsis==
&quot;Thrilling Cities&quot; is Ian Fleming&#x27;s view of thirteen cities he visited in two trips in 1959 and 1960. The cities covered are: Hong Kong, Macau, Tokyo, Honolulu, Los Angeles and Las Vegas (the two cities are examined in one chapter), Chicago, New York, Hamburg, Berlin, Vienna, Geneva, Naples and Monte Carlo. Fleming&#x27;s account is highly personal and deals with his visit and his experiences and impressions. Each chapter closes with what Fleming called &quot;Incidental Intelligence&quot;, dealing with the hotels, restaurants, food and night life.

==Background==
In 1959 the features editor of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, Leonard Russell, suggested to Ian Fleming that he take a five-week, all-expenses-paid trip around the world for a series of features for the paper. Fleming declined, saying he was a terrible tourist who &quot;often advocated the provision of roller-skates at the door of museums and art galleries&quot;. Russell persuaded him, pointing out that Fleming could also get some material for the Bond books in the process. Fleming took £500 (£ in 2025 pounds) of travellers cheques for expenses and flew BOAC to his first stop, Hong Kong. He was guided around the city by his friend Richard Hughes, the Australian correspondent for &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;; Hughes was later the model for the character Dikko Henderson in &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot;, as well as for &quot;Old Craw&quot; in John le Carré&#x27;s &quot;The Honourable Schoolboy&quot;. Fleming stayed just three days in Hong Kong, before he and Hughes flew to Tokyo where they were joined by Torao Saito—also known as &quot;Tiger&quot;—a journalist with the &quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot; newspaper group. Saito later became the model for the character Tiger Tanaka in &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot;. Fleming spent three days in Tokyo and decided there would be &quot;no politicians, museums, temples, Imperial palaces or Noh plays, let alone tea ceremonies&quot; on his itinerary; he instead visited a judo academy, a Japanese soothsayer and the Kodokan, a local gymnasium.

Fleming left Tokyo on Friday the 13th to fly to Hawaii; 2,000 miles into the Pacific one of the Douglas DC-6&#x27;s engines caught fire and the plane nearly crashed, although it managed to make an emergency landing on Wake Island. After Honolulu, Fleming moved on to Los Angeles, where he visited a number of places he had been before, including the Los Angeles Police Intelligence headquarters, where he again met Captain James Hamilton, much as he had done during his research for &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot;. By the time Fleming got to New York he was fed up with travelling and his biographer, Andrew Lycett notes that &quot;his sour mood transferred to the city and indeed the country he had once loved&quot;. The series opened in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; on 24 January 1960, with an introduction from Fleming, followed by the article on Hong Kong the following week. The series finished on 28 February 1960 with the article about Chicago and New York.

Roy Thomson, the chairman of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, enjoyed Fleming&#x27;s articles and suggested a number of other cities, including Rio de Janeiro, Buenos Aires, Havana, New Orleans and Montreal. Others, such as &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; editor Harry Hodson, were less enthusiastic; Hodson considered that &quot;more serious readers have tut-tutted a bit about missing the really important things&quot;. Fleming planned to drive most of his second tour of cities, which concentrated on places he wanted to visit in Europe. For the trip he took his own car, a Ford Thunderbird convertible, crossing the channel and journeying through Ostend, Antwerp and Bremen before arriving at his first destination: Hamburg. He stayed only briefly in the city, praising the sex industry by writing &quot;how very different from the prudish and hypocritical manner in which we so disgracefully mismanage these things in England&quot;. Fleming moved on to Berlin, where he was shown round the city by &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; correspondent Anthony Terry and his wife Rachel. Terry took Fleming into East Berlin and told him many of the details about Operation Stopwatch, the Anglo-American attempt to tunnel into the Soviet-occupied zone to tap into landline communication of the Soviet Army headquarters. In comparison to Hamburg, Fleming thought Berlin was &quot;sinister&quot;.

Fleming moved on to Vienna and found the city boring, calling it &quot;clean, tidy, God-fearing&quot;, before travelling into Geneva. He met Ingrid Etler, a journalist and old girlfriend, who was resident in the city and who provided him with much of his background material. Fleming then travelled to Les Avants, the villa near Montreux of his close friend Noël Coward, where Coward introduced Fleming to Charlie Chaplin. Fleming had asked Coward to set up the meeting as Chaplin was writing his memoirs and Leonard Russell had asked Fleming to secure the rights for the paper; Fleming was successful in his approach and the memoirs were later serialised in the paper.

Fleming&#x27;s wife Ann had joined him in Les Avants and the couple then moved on to Naples, where Fleming interviewed Lucky Luciano, finding him &quot;a neat, quiet, grey-haired man with a tired good-looking face.&quot; After Naples, the Flemings moved to Monte Carlo, the final stop on Fleming&#x27;s journey; Despite spending time at the casino, Fleming thought Monte Carlo somewhat seedy. The second series of articles started on 31 July 1960 with Fleming&#x27;s trip to Hamburg, and finished with his visit to Monte Carlo. Overall the series was considered popular and successful.

==Release and reception==
&quot;Thrilling Cities&quot; was first published in the UK by Jonathan Cape, in November 1963; the book was 223 pages long and cost 30 shillings. The cover was designed by artist Paul Davis and shows &quot;a surreal version of Monte Carlo&quot;. For the US market, the book was released in June 1964 through New American Library and cost $4.95. Fleming&#x27;s comments on New York were so cutting that when the book was published in the US, the American publishers asked if he could tone down the wording. Fleming refused, but instead wrote the short story &quot;007 in New York&quot; to be included in the US version by way of recompense.

===Reviews===
The reviews for &quot;Thrilling Cities&quot; were broadly good. The critic for &quot;The Times&quot; thought that Fleming&#x27;s style was &quot;no nonsense over fine writing&quot;, and summed up the book as &quot;Fleming&#x27;s smooth, sophisticated, personally conducted tours&quot;, noting that the author &quot;has a knack of enjoying himself&quot;. John Raymond, in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, wrote that &quot;Mr Fleming&#x27;s prose arouses the &quot;voyeur&quot; that lurks in all but the best of us&quot;, and considered that the book remained &quot;supremely readable&quot; throughout. Writing for &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;, Xan Fielding found the title of the book to be misleading, noting that apart from a very small win at the casinos of Las Vegas, &quot;his personal experience of thrills seems to have been just as limited everywhere else on his itinerary.&quot; Fielding considered that the cities Fleming visited had the potential for thrills, and hoped that the material gathered was used in Fleming&#x27;s literary works with thrills included.

Christopher Wordsworth, writing for &quot;The Listener&quot;, believed that &quot;Thrilling Cities&quot; was &quot;a fascinating informative mock-up, disarmingly snob-ridden&quot;. Writing for the &quot;Daily Express&quot;, Peter Grosvenor thought that Fleming—a &quot;tourist extraordinary&quot;—was &quot;never afraid to record a controversial view&quot;, citing Fleming&#x27;s views on the differences between oriental and western women&#x27;s approaches to men.

The critic for &quot;The Financial Times&quot;, James Bredin, declared that &quot;Thrilling Cities&quot; &quot;can—and will, compulsively—be read at a sitting&quot;, although he found that overall &quot;it is an unsatisfying report&quot; because of the brevity of the subject. Honor Tracy, providing the critique for &quot;The Guardian&quot; thought Fleming praiseworthy, as he &quot;writes without any pretension at all&quot;, while also managing to be &quot;invariably entertaining and often funny&quot;. Overall Tracy considered that &quot;Thrilling Cities&quot; was &quot;a lively, enjoyable book, written from an unusual point of view and well illustrated.&quot; Writing for &quot;The Observer&quot;, Francis Hope was surprised by Fleming&#x27;s written style, which he found to be &quot;more flabby verbose than one expects of a thriller writer&quot;, although this was redeemed by Fleming having &quot;some interesting conversations with local experts on crime&quot;.

The reviewer for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Robert Kirsch, did not enjoy the book and considered Fleming to be &quot;a second-rate reporter, filled with the irritating prejudices and pomposities of a middle-class English traveller.&quot; For Kirsch, Fleming&#x27;s style was a combination of Sax Rohmer and James Fitzpatrick, although he also considered that &quot;Fleming&#x27;s wit is provincial&quot;. Writing the review for &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, Marjory Adams thought &quot;Thrilling Cities&quot; to have &quot;an acid gaiety in its descriptions&quot;, which contributed to her overall summary of the book: &quot;it is fun!&quot;

<text>Coralie Clément (born Coralie Biolay; 1 September 1978 in Villefranche-sur-Saône, Rhône) is a French singer.

==Biography==
Clément was born into a family of musicians, her father a clarinetist, and studied the violin from the age of six but later quit. Her brother, Benjamin Biolay, also a singer, has written for Henri Salvador and wrote for and produced her own debut, as well as its follow-up. Among her claimed inspirations are Serge Gainsbourg, Françoise Hardy, Jane Birkin. She recorded her first album while studying history at university.

Clément sang the song &quot;Dorénavant,&quot; used as the theme of the film &quot;L&#x27;Idole&quot; by Samantha Lang, starring Leelee Sobieski. A song from her first album was used in the soundtrack of the movie &quot;Something&#x27;s Gotta Give&quot; starring Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson.

In 2001, she released her first album, &quot;Salle des Pas Perdus&quot;. This album is a collaborative effort between her and her brother, Benjamin Biolay, who wrote and arranged 10 of the 12 songs. Her second album, &quot;Bye bye beauté&quot;, was released in 2005 and features songs that are more pop and rock oriented than those of &quot;Salle des Pas Perdus&quot;, and was also produced by her brother.

<text>West Qurna () is one of Iraq&#x27;s largest oil fields, located north of Rumaila field, 65 km northwest of Basra. West Qurna is believed to hold of recoverable reserves – making it one of the biggest oil fields in the world. Until 2009, the field was closed to Western firms.

==Phases==

===West Qurna Phase I===
In November 2009, an ExxonMobil - Shell joint venture won a $50 billion contract to develop the &quot;West Qurna Phase I&quot;. As per Iraqi Oil Ministry estimates, the project required a $25 billion investment and another $25 billion in operating fees creating approximately 100,000 jobs in the underdeveloped southern region. ExxonMobil was to increase the production from within seven years. The Iraqi government, in turn, was to pay $1.90 per barrel produced by ExxonMobil-Shell alliance. In November 2023, PetroChina took over as the main operator of West Qurna 1, replacing ExxonMobil.

===West Qurna Phase II===
In December 2009, Russia&#x27;s Lukoil and Norway&#x27;s Statoil were awarded the rights to develop the &quot;West Qurna Phase II&quot; oil field. The Lukoil-Statoil alliance will receive $1.15 per barrel that they produce. In addition, they will work to raise output from West Qurna 2 to by 2012 and over a period of 13 years. In March 2012, Statoil sold its 18.75% stake in the field to Lukoil, giving the Russian firm a 75% stake, and leaving the Iraqi state oil company with 25%.

In 2023 Lukoil announced it is planning to double the production of oil from the West Qurna Field 2, to 800,000 bpd.

===Water-injection project===
A new joint multibillion-dollar water-injection project will be awarded to operator ExxonMobil. The project includes construction of a plant which will help 6 major oil-field development projects by producing of water per day. The alliance will include Shell, Eni, Lukoil, CNPC and Petronas.

<doc id="1027949" wikidata="Q33315" url="?curid=1027949" title="Herero language">
<text>Herero (Otjiherero) is a Bantu language spoken by the Herero and Mbanderu peoples in Namibia and Botswana, as well as by small communities of people in southwestern Angola. There were speakers in these countries between 2015 and 2018.

==Distribution==
Its linguistic distribution covers a zone called Hereroland, which is constituted of the region of Omaheke along with the Otjozondjupa and Kunene Regions. The Himba people, who are related to the Herero and Mbanderu, speak a dialect very close to Otjiherero. Many Herero-speakers live in Windhoek, the capital of Namibia.

==Phonology==

=== Consonants ===

The sounds /f s l/ are found in loanwords.

=== Vowels ===
==Script==
Because of the translation of missionary Gottlieb Viehe (1839–1901) of the Bible into Herero, at the end of the 19th century, the spoken language was transcribed to an alphabet based on the Latin script. Father Peter Heinrich Brincker (1836–1904) translated several theological works and songs.

== Grammar ==
==Education==
Otjiherero is taught in Namibian schools both as a native tongue and as a secondary language. It is included as a principal material at the University of Namibia. Otjiherero is also one of the six minority languages that are used by the Namibian State Radio (NBC). Gamsberg Macmillan, , has published the only dictionary in Otjiherero.

==Varieties==
The Hakaona variety is now considered a separate Bantu language, as sometimes is Zemba (&quot;Otjizemba&quot;). Maho (200) also removes Kuvale to Bantu Zone R.10, while differentiating North-West Herero (Kaokoland Herero, including Zemba and presumably Himba and Hakaona), R.311, and Botswana Herero (including Mahalapye Herero), R.312, as distinct from but closely related to Herero proper. Within Herero proper, he recognizes two dialects: Central Herero and Mbandero (East Herero).

Northwest/Zemba is found on either side of the Namibian–Angolan border. Central Herero covers a large area in central Namibia, with East Herero and a few islands to the east but still in Namibia. Botswana Herero consists of a few scattered islands in Botswana, with about 15% of the population of Herero proper.

&quot;Ethnologue&quot; separates Zimba as a distinct language but retains Himba, East Herero, and Botswana Herero within the Herero language. However, it no longer recognizes Kuvale as a dialect but as a separate language.

<text>The Great North Air Ambulance Service (GNAAS) is a registered charity and air ambulance based in the United Kingdom. It operates a dedicated helicopter emergency service for the North of England with three aircraft. It serves North Yorkshire, the North-East, Cumbria, the Scottish borders and the Isle of Man.

== Current operations ==

GNAAS operates three Dauphin helicopters from its two bases at Langwathby, near Penrith in Cumbria, and Urlay Nook, near Eaglescliffe in County Durham. Between July and December 2021, the service had an average of 85 helicopter call-outs per month.

In hours of darkness, when the helicopters do not fly, North East Ambulance Service funds a Medical Emergency Response Incident Team (MERIT), which is staffed by a doctor and paramedic team from GNAAS. The MERIT service extended in November 2018 to cover Thursday to Sunday nights, which were previously covered on an on-call basis. The service uses Volvo XC90 vehicles.

In 20142015, GNAAS had operating costs of £4.6million and an income of £6.2million. 
In 20222023, the operating costs were £7.1million against an income of £10.8million, which included a total of £350,000 from government contracts and grants.

In 2020, GNAAS began trials in using jet suits to get from landed helicopters on call-outs to casualties in locations difficult to access. The simulation exercise showed a casualty, whose position it would take 25minutes to reach on foot, could be reached in a jet suit in 90seconds.

==History==
The air ambulance service began in 1994 with the leased Eurocopter AS350 Écureuil helicopter G-NAAS. MBB Bo 105 helicopters were operated from 2003, and an MD 902 from 2006. 2006 also saw the introduction of the first Dauphin helicopter, G-HEMS. In 2010, the charity consolidated around a fleet of three Dauphin N2 helicopters, which were the first aircraft it owned. This ended the practice of leasing aircraft, which created financial issues. Two of these three Dauphin N2 helicopters were later replaced by newer Dauphin N3 helicopters G-NHAD and G-NHAE between 2019 and 2020. This was done to mitigate the risk involved with flying older aircraft.

==In the media==
From 8 March 2018, the charity appeared on Channel 4&#x27;s TV programme &quot;Emergency Helicopter Medics&quot;, which followed the crews responding and treating emergency patients. Other air ambulances that featured in the show include Thames Valley Air Ambulance and East Anglian Air Ambulance.

<doc id="1027953" wikidata="Q4818495" url="?curid=1027953" title="Bleasdale">
<text>Bleasdale is a village and civil parish in the Wyre district of Lancashire, England, in the Forest of Bowland Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The two sources of the River Brock lie within the parish. According to the 2001 census, it had a population of 147, increasing to 167 at the 2011 Census.

== Landmarks ==
Within the parish are:
* Bleasdale parish church, probably the only one anywhere dedicated to Saint Eadmer.
* Bleasdale Circle, a Bronze Age circular earthwork, originally with an outer ring (at ) and possibly aligned with the sunrise of the Summer Solstice.
* Bleasdale Church of England Primary School (closed in August 2019). 
* The Parish Hall, built in 1929.
* The former post office, housed in the forge opposite Higher Brock Mill (at ) on the River Brock, supporting brown and rainbow trout. From 1947 to 2002 the post office housed a café for locals, cycling and hiking folk to refresh, fitted with a well, dating from about 1700, beneath the building. In the early 1900s, &quot;Jack Custard&quot; was renowned there for the quality of his custard tart.

The ancient Forest of Bleasdale is less well known than its more famous neighbour, the Forest of Bowland but its history is recounted by Smith. Being a part of Wyresdale, Bleasdale never fell under the sway of the powerful medieval Lordship of Bowland.

==Notable buildings==

* St Eadmer&#x27;s Church was rebuilt in 1835 by John Dewhurst and restored and enlarged in 1897. It has a west tower and lancet windows. The church retains its pews and western gallery.
* Bleasdale Tower was built in the early 19th century by William Garnett.
* Clough Heads Cottages was once a boy&#x27;s Reformatory School.

==Geodesy==
&quot;Paddy&#x27;s Pole&quot; on Fair Snape Fell in Bleasdale parish was the origin (meridian) of the 6 inch and 1:2500 Ordnance Survey maps for Lancashire.

<text>Yuri Georgiyevich Shargin () is a retired cosmonaut of the Russian Space Forces.

== Biography ==
He was born March 20, 1960, in Engels, Saratov Oblast, Russian SFSR. His father was Jewish. He is divorced and has two children.

Shargin graduated in 1982 from the Military Engineering Academy for Aeronautics and Astronautics located in Leningrad. He is a lieutenant colonel in the Russian Space Forces.

He was selected as a cosmonaut on February 9, 1996.

He was selected in 2004, to be the flight engineer on the Soyuz TMA-5 mission to the International Space Station. Soyuz TMA-5 was successfully launched on October 14, 2004.

Shargin was the first Russian Space Forces cosmonaut to launch into space. Due to his late addition to the crew and lack of background information or information about his activities in space, some questioned the motives of his flight. However, chief flight director Vladimir Solovyov, assured, “We, on the ISS, are not involved in military matters.”

After nearly 10 days in space, he returned to Earth on board Soyuz TMA-4

He retired from the cosmonaut corps in August 2008

<text>Jan Wnęk (1828 – 10 July 1869) was a Polish carver of religious statues who is claimed to have constructed and flown a glider (aircraft) in the 1860s, predating the flights of Otto Lilienthal. There is a speculative &quot;reconstruction&quot; of Wnek&#x27;s glider in the Ethnographic Museum of Kraków.

Jan Wnek was born in the village of Kaczówka near Dąbrowa Tarnowska. He was the son of a serf and received no formal education., but was trained as a carpenter. Encouraged by a local priest, Father Stanislaw Morgenstern, Wnęk became a prolific sculptor in wood and stone for churches and cemeteries in Kraków and Odporyszów. The angels he sculpted are described as having wings of &quot;exceptional beauty&quot;. He also possessed an instinctive talent for mechanics and improved some contemporary agricultural machinery, and acted in village plays.

There is no contemporary written description of the glider and the reconstruction in the Kraków Museum of Ethnography is entirely speculative. The claims for his flights are based on a local oral tradition. Although Professor Tadeusz Seweryn, former director of the Museum of Ethnography, claimed to have discovered some church records with descriptions of Jan Wnęk&#x27;s flights, these have never been made available for independent scrutiny.

Wnęk had no formal education, and his ideas were based on his observation of bird flight and on his own skills as a craftsman. He noted that some soaring birds made use of rising air currents to gain height and so identified the optimum weather conditions for his flights. He allegedly built several experimental models and although he did not understand the theory of aerodynamic lift, he copied the upper curvature of a bird&#x27;s wing. He tested his models by launching them by hand. In 1866 he is claimed to have started construction of a full-sized glider which he named &quot;Loty&quot; (Flyer), which had an ash framework covered with varnished linen. It is claimed that he controlled his glider by twisting the wing&#x27;s trailing edge using strings attached to stirrups at his feet. Wnęk is said to have made his first short controlled flights in June of the same year from a small hill. After several flights, some adjustments and learning his glider behavior, Wnęk is then said to have felt confident enough to ask for authorization from the Odporyszów church priest, Father Stanisław Morgenstern, to build a special ramp on top of the church tower to launch himself from. The tower stands high and is built on top of a hill, making it high launch above the valley below.
Several public flights are claimed between 1866 and 1869, mainly during religious festivals, carnivals and New Year celebrations., and that during the Pentecost Carnival held on 16 May 1869 at Odporyszów, Austria-Hungary, Wnęk&#x27;s made a flight that ended in an accident. An assistant, Michał Sowiński, was reported to be implicated in his death.

He died a few weeks later, aged 41, leaving a wife and three children. His flying activities spanned about four years. If these flights took place, they preceded those of Otto Lilienthal by 25 years. Unknown outside the locality, any achievement made by Wnek had no influence on the development of heavier-than-air flight.

<text>Irving Brooks Harris (August 4, 1910 – September 25, 2004) was an American businessman and philanthropist. 

== Early life and career==

Harris was one of three children born and raised in Saint Paul, Minnesota. His father, Bill Harris, was a wealthy woolen merchant. He attended Yale University and graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1931. He was of Jewish descent.

He went to work for the Toni Home Permanent Company, a hair care company co-founded by his brother Neison Harris (with Ray Lee) in 1944 which introduced the first home permanent. Toni Home was sold to the Gillette Safety Razor Co. in 1948 for nearly $20.0 million. The original Toni manufacturing facility was located in a former schoolhouse near Forest Lake, Minnesota. 

In 1948, he moved to Chicago, where he served as chairman of fire and burglar alarm manufacturer Pittway, which was later acquired by Honeywell International, and then as the chairman of the mutual fund, Liberty Acorn. In 1957, he became a partner of R.J. Levy and Company, a New York Stock Exchange firm headquartered in New York. In 1975, he left Levy to focus on managing his family’s assets. In 1986, he renamed the family investment firm, William Harris Investors, Inc., in honor of his father.

== Philanthropy and activism==
Harris did much of his charitable work in Chicago, Illinois, but he also donated substantially to the arts in Aspen, Colorado. Harris contributed most of his money to programs for children and the arts such as the Joan W. and Irving B. Harris Theater for Music and Dance at Millennium Park. In 1986, Harris gave a donation that established The Irving B. Harris Graduate School of Public Policy Studies at The University of Chicago.

Harris gave the lead gift in 1954 to create public television station WTTW in Chicago - he later served as the station&#x27;s Chairman of the Board.

His philanthropy created several non-profits in Chicago: Family Focus (with Bernice Weissbourd); the Ounce of Prevention Fund, a public-private partnership dedicated to preventing teenage pregnancy, child abuse and neglect; and the Erikson Institute, a graduate school founded in 1966 involved child development. Harris was also an ardent supporter and donor of Zero to Three, an early childhood organization.

Harris was a benefactor to Jewish causes. He was a member of the American Jewish Committee&#x27;s National Leadership Council, President&#x27;s Cabinet and was a Founder of the AJC&#x27;s Institute on American Jewish-Israeli Relations. He served on the Advisory Council of the AJC Chicago Chapter for 35 years. He was awarded the AJC&#x27;s Human Rights Medallion for his efforts to combat anti-Semitism.

Harris published a book, &quot;Children in Jeopardy,&quot; in 1996.

== Personal life ==
Harris married twice. His first wife was Rosetta Wolpert (b 1910 Minneapolis, MN); they had two daughters, Roxanne Harris Meyer Frank and Virginia Harris Polsky, and a son, William Wolpert Harris. His second wife was Joan Harris. Harris is the grandfather of noted New York City restaurateur Danny Meyer, son of Roxanne Harris Meyer Frank.

<doc id="1028011" wikidata="Q866142" url="?curid=1028011" title="Bischofferode">
<text>Bischofferode is a village and a former municipality in the Eichsfeld district, in Thuringia, Germany. Since 1 December 2010, it is part of the municipality Am Ohmberg. Bischofferode consists of the subdivisions of Bischofferode, Hauröden and Siedlung &quot;Thomas Müntzer&quot;.

==Bischofferode and Holungen==

The historical border of the area &quot;Eichsfeld&quot; goes straight through the drainage area of the two schools - Bischofferode and Holungen are dominated by the Catholic belief, that shows the traditional membership to the Eichsfeld. Hauröden is dominated by the Protestant belief, what shows, that the village was historically stronger linked to the Protestant area of Nordhausen and Sondershausen. (Hauröden has been a part of the district of Nordhausen until 1952).

It was first mentioned in 1186 as a convent village of the monastery in Gerode.

Little hamlets in the boundary: - Wenigenbischofferode - Husen - Poppenrode

The arms are The unprooting hoe and the crosier show the origin as an unprooting village and the bishop&#x27;s property.

===Economy===

The people mainly earned their money in the agricultural production until the beginning of the 20th century. Then in 1909 the salt mine opened. It was the most important branch until 31 December 1993. This date was the end of the salt production in Bischofferode. Today the trade plays a more important role.

==Village of Hauröden==

The village Hauröden - hauröden has been a part of Bischofferode since 1974.
The first mention is: 1206 Howeritte 1370 Houenreden.
The village was nearly depopulated as a result of the Thirty Years&#x27; War.

Little hamlets in the boundary: Bennrode, Sipterode, Billrode.

===Economy===

Agricultural production and weaving were the first sources of income followed by the salt-mining. Working in the salt-mine meant better wages for the people. In 1897 a railway line was built, the housing estate &quot;Neubleicherode&quot; was founded and electricity introduced in 1917. A housing estate for the workers was built in Hauröden itself in 1919.

===Sights/ tourist attractions===
Church (Trinitatiskirche) built in 1617 in rustic baroque style - war memorial (1927) - very old lime tree (under protection) - &quot;Hauröder Klippen&quot; - a lookout in the hills of the Ohm Hills - restaurant &quot;Hauröder Klippen&quot; (in 1997 renovated, with rooms to let)

Church (Marienkirche) with a baroque tower and a modern interior decorating (projected by Prof. Tresst) - museum of the &quot;potash union&quot; - a lot of public footpaths

<text>The Rice Belt of the United States includes Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas, four southern U.S. states that grow a significant portion of the nation&#x27;s rice crop.

Arkansas is the nation&#x27;s leading rice producer, followed by California (not part of the Rice Belt), Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas, and Missouri (bordering on, but not part of, the Rice Belt).

<doc id="1028024" wikidata="Q500634" url="?curid=1028024" title="Nasal septum">
<text>The nasal septum () separates the left and right airways of the nasal cavity, dividing the two nostrils.

It is depressed by the depressor septi nasi muscle.

==Structure==
The fleshy external end of the nasal septum is called the columella or columella nasi, and is made up of cartilage and soft tissue. The nasal septum contains bone and hyaline cartilage. It is normally about 2 mm thick.

The nasal septum is composed of four structures:
* Maxillary bone (the crest)
* Perpendicular plate of ethmoid bone
* Septal nasal cartilage (ie, quandrangular cartilage)
* Vomer bone

The lowest part of the septum is a narrow strip of bone that projects from the maxilla and the palatine bones, and is the length of the septum. This strip of bone is called the maxillary crest; it articulates in front with the septal nasal cartilage, and at the back with the vomer. The maxillary crest is described in the anatomy of the nasal septum as having a maxillary component and a palatine component.

===Development===

At an early period, the septum of the nose consists of a plate of cartilage, known as the &quot;ethmovomerine cartilage&quot;.

The posterosuperior part of this cartilage is ossified to form the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid; its anteroinferior portion persists as the septal cartilage, while the vomer is ossified in the membrane covering its posteroinferior part.

Two ossification centers, one on either side of the middle line, appear about the eighth week of fetal development in this part of the membrane, and hence the vomer consists primarily of two lamellae.

About the third month, these unite below, and thus a deep groove is formed in which the cartilage is lodged.

As growth proceeds, the union of the lamellae extends upward and forward, and at the same time, the intervening plate of cartilage undergoes absorption.

By the onset of puberty the lamellae are almost completely united to form a median plate, but evidence of the bilaminar origin of the bone is seen in the everted alae of its upper border and in the groove on its anterior margin.

== Clinical significance ==

The nasal septum can depart from the centre line of the nose in a condition that is known as a deviated septum caused by trauma. However, it is normal to have a slight deviation to one side. The septum generally stays in the midline until about the age of seven, at which point it will frequently deviate to the right. An operation to straighten the nasal septum is known as a septoplasty.

A perforated nasal septum can be caused by an ulcer, trauma due to an inserted object, long-term exposure to welding fumes, or cocaine use. There is a procedure that can be of help to those suffering from the perforated septum. A silicone button can be inserted in the hole to close the open sore.

The nasal septum can be affected by both benign tumors such as fibromas, and hemangiomas, and malignant tumors such as squamous cell carcinoma.

== Cosmetic procedures ==
A nasal septum piercing is usually carried out through the fleshy columella close to the end of the nasal septum.

<text>Holungen is a village and a former municipality in the district of Eichsfeld in Thuringia, Germany. Since 1 December 2011, it is part of the municipality Sonnenstein, of which it is an &quot;Ortschaft&quot;.
It lies approximately from the university town of Göttingen. With a population of around 1,000, it is one of the medium-sized villages in the district.

==Coat of arms==
On the coat of arms, the right half represents the Sonnenstein, a hill very close to the town. On the upper left quarter, the Wheel of Mainz represents the Archbishopric of Mainz, and the lower left quarter shows two crossed hammers indicative of potash mining and symbolising the environment. Over many decades, mining was of enormous economic importance.

==Origin of the name==
The research into the origin of the name traces it back to antiquity. Evidence for the origin comes mostly from documents in the Gerode Monastery. The name “Holungen” is said to derive from the German word “Hold” (= a gentle benevolent goddess or woman). However, in speech, this word is indistinguishable from “Holt”, an older German word for wood. In old title deeds the name also appears as “Holdungen”, which suggests the name could also derive from “Haulungen”, meaning “pasture in a clearing on sloping ground”. This interpretation infers that Holungen was designated as a “Waldsiedlung” (settlement in a forest). Villages whose names end in “-ungen” were all founded in an earlier settlement period. Therefore, is it possible that Holungen&#x27;s founding could date back as far as the initial colonisation of modern Germany by Germanic peoples. It could have existed as far back as 531, the Second Settlement Period (all placenames ending in “-ungen”), when the Franks conquered Thuringia. Later on, the northern part of Eichsfeld, including Holungen, belonged to the Saxons. Saxon characteristics and peculiarities were taken up. This also explains why a language border (isogloss) runs through Holungen. Residents speak Low German, while people of the neighbouring town of Bischofferode speak standard German.

==Location==
Holungen is located at the foot of the Ohm Hills at the bottom of the Bode valley, about 35 km from the Harz mountains. It is a so-called &quot;Haufendorf&quot; (&quot;clustered village&quot;; denotes an irregular, unplanned and quite closely packed village, built around a central square). To the south lie the Sonder and the Ohmberg with the “Wilde Kirche” (Wild Church). The Hohenkammer lies to the west, where the Segeltal valley separates it from the Sonder. To the north, the 486-metre-high Sonnenstein rises above the village. In addition, the Graseforst is found there. The course of the Bode runs along the valley floor to the east. There is also a large spoil heap from potash mining, which is nearly as big as the adjacent mountains.

Holungen lies 350 m above sea level. It is well protected from the easterly winds and other external influences by mountains. Its soil is formed from crystalline rocks, made of minerals such as quartz, feldspar and mica. The erosion of rocks forms sandy soil from quartz, and clay and loam from potash/feldspar-based rocks.

==History==

===Early history===
According to documents found in the monastery at Gerode, Holungen was founded between 531 and 800. In the following centuries, there was much armed conflict near the village and in the surrounding area. In 933, Henry I beat the Magyars at the Unstrut river. Twenty-two years later, his son Otto the Great did the same at the Lechfelde, bringing peace to the area. Between 1118 and 1120 the Gerode Monastery was founded.

In 1247, the Thuringian landgrave Heinrich Raspe died, bringing conflict back to the area. From 1236 to 1247, he was &quot;Landesherr&quot; (territorial lord) of part of the march of Tu-der-stede, modern-day Duderstadt. He was also brother-in-law to Elisabeth of Hungary. In 1246 he was elected counter-king to Conrad IV, son of Frederick II. Although his forces defeated Conrad&#x27;s at the battle of Nidda, he died shortly afterwards, and after his death fighting broke out over the order of succession for the title Landgrave of Thuringia, during which Holungen was devastated. Many inhabitants fled to Duderstadt. Some evidence for this comes from deeds dating to 1266 and 1299. The documents of 1266 also give us the first mention of Holungen, under the name “Haldrungen”. Between 1350 and 1370, the village was rebuilt again and belonged to the county of Lohra. In 1370, Holungen became a part of the county of Honstein and in 1431, it became by exchange the monastery village of the monastery at Gerode. In 1525, Holungen was destroyed during the course of the German Peasants&#x27; War.

===The period until the German Empire===
The Thirty Years&#x27; War arrived and reached Holungen, and in 1626, much devastation was caused by the army of Duke Christian of Brunswick. In 1701, Prussia became a kingdom, but Eichsfeld and Holungen remained subordinate to the Electorate of Mainz. Between 1740–1786 Eichsfeld took up arms in the service of Austria against Frederick the Great and fought against Prussia. Many inhabitants of Holungen were involved in these wars or were enlisted with the “Kurmainzischen Husarencorps” (Hussar Corps of the Electorate of Mainz). Thus even today there are still some Holungen surnames in Vienna. In 1802, Eichsfeld was finally annexed to Prussia. This took place on 3 August, the birthday of the King of Prussia Frederick William III.

Prussian rule lasted only for four years and ten weeks, up to the years 1806 and 1807, when Prussia was nearly completely destroyed. In addition, half of its constituent states, as well as its status as a great power, were taken from it. In 1806, Prussia lost the Battle of Jena-Auerstedt, with the result that, in December that year, Napoleon took possession of the two Eichsfeld districts, including Holungen. Frederick William III fled with his wife and the princes to Memel. The French required masses of supplies, which the Holungers had to furnish. In 1807, Eichsfeld became part of the Kingdom of Westphalia with its capital at Kassel. On 1 January 1808 the Napoleonic Code came into effect. Young men had to serve in the French army. During this period, many troops marched through Eichsfeld and settled in Holungen. After the struggle for liberty, Eichsfeld was returned to Prussia. ‘Ordered’ laws were created, and Worbis received their own city and regional courts. Holungen was assigned to the judicial office (Gerichtsamt) at Gerode. At that time Holungen had 650 inhabitants. In 1841, Holungen received its first Kaplan, literally “Chaplain”, a term used in German to mean a Roman Catholic priest in the first few years after his ordination. Since 28 January 1844, full Mass has been held every Sunday and Saint&#x27;s Day.

In 1848, the year of many attempted revolutions in large parts of Europe, violence in the district of Worbis was widespread, leading to the formation of Bürgerwehren (vigilante militia groups), under the control of the mayor in each village. The vigilantes were equipped with pikes, sabres and rifles. One year later the setting up of the Grundbuchamt (lit. land register office) in the district court of Worbis was completed. Cholera came to Worbis district in 1850. Most deaths occurred in neighbouring Weißenborn, Holungen was only minimally affected. In September 1855, the king visited many places in the district. During the wars of independence, the Eichsfeld had suffered much, leading to crop failures and widespread illness. Holungen received money from the king for the reconstruction of several burned-down houses. On 2 February 1861, King Frederick William IV died, and his brother William I took his place. In the same year, the shooting club was formed, and the Chaussee (main road) was extended over the Graseforst. The Holungers were dissatisfied with this extension, since they had supported a different route, one which would have been more favourable for the area but had been dropped. In February 1865, this led to a big court case, which the Holungers lost. The Chaussee led from Worbis over the Sonnenstein to Gerode and was half-an-hour further away than the old road, which almost completely cut Holungen off from long-distance traffic.

===The period of the German Empire===
The years 1870 and 1871 saw the Franco-Prussian War, and on 30 January 1871, Germany became an empire under the Prussian King William I. The soldiers returned home with the Iron Cross, the Kriegsgedenkmünze (War Service Medal) and other service decorations. Many Kriegskameradschaften (veterans’ groups) were formed, and later joined by a Kriegerverein (veterans’ association). In Holungen, support for Kaiser Wilhelm was very high. This was due in large part to the fact that a Holunger (Josef Hildebrandt), was the Kaiser&#x27;s driver from 1861–1888. At this time, Holungen had approximately 650 inhabitants, two nursery gardens, one Hirtenhaus (lit. shepherd&#x27;s house), one school, one local pub (Am. inn) and one fire pond. It covered roughly 98 acres / 40 hectares (196 Äcker).

On 1 April 1876, rector Friedrich Polak from Nordhausen was appointed out as the school inspector. Holungen received a second teacher and a new school was built. In March 1871 land plots on all the farmland were remeasured. Due to the differing altitudes it was possible that there were differences in the measurements, but in 232 cases the permissible difference was exceeded. In 100 cases it amounted to even twice the limit. The owners gave the land over to the Separationsverfahren (roughly, the process of crop rotation) and “had it given back afterwards” (uncertain literal translation of “und ließen es sich hinterher zurückgeben” from German original), as a result of which the total area of farmland was reduced. In 1906, it became apparent that roughly 90 acres / 36 hectares (180 Äcker) of Holungen, which were actually registered in the land registry, were missing. In 1925, the land was recorded twice, one for the forest treasury and the other for the municipality of Weißenborn. Holungen objected, but without any success.

In June 1890, a Church-building Society was founded in Holungen, and one year later the building of the church began. The stones were supplied from the nearby quarry at Wehnberg. A teacher from Holungen began rehearsals of stageplays with the young people from the village and put on performances in neighbouring villages to support the construction of the church. On 20 June 1893, Holungen was consecrated by suffragan bishop (Weihbischof) Dr. Augustinus Gockel. One year later, the registry office was moved from Bischofferode to Holungen. In 1895, the road to Bischofferode was built, with Holungen receiving support from the Landesbauinspektion (roughly State Construction Inspectorate) at Mühlhausen. In 1896, Holungen received a new church organ. One year later, the church tower was hit by lightning, and repairs were still under way when the new church bell was installed, the old bell having cracked during ringing. In 1899, the Holunger Gesangsverein, a singing association, was created. 1908 saw opening of Potash Shaft 1 at the Thomas Müntzer potash mine.

===Holungen during the two World Wars===
Holungen was largely unaffected by direct action of the two World Wars. In the First World War, 160 Holungers were conscripted. 36 men did not return home. A memorial was erected in their memory in the church under the tower.

In the Second World War, men from Holungen fought in Poland, France and the Soviet Union, among other places. In total, 47 men from Holungen died during the Second World War. The village itself only felt the effects of the war just before its end. An aerial mine was dropped nearby, and several aircraft shot down by the Luftwaffe. Holungen remained entirely untouched by enemy air attacks. Several inhabitants had to pay fines for not fully blacking out their windows. In spring 1945, German troops were being pushed back, and on 14 March Holungen found itself billeting many soldiers from both Flak and Infantry units, bringing the parish into the war zone. At around 11 o’clock on the night of 9th to 10 April combat erupted. Flak cannon fired at enemy aircraft during a three-hour period, although there were fairly long pauses during that time. Both the inhabitants and buildings of Holungen remained undamaged.

On 11 April the American advance reached Holungen, the German troops having fled the previous day. When the news of the American approach became known, the mayor and the parish vicar went out to meet the approaching troops. As the first vehicles neared them, the two men went up to the Americans and asked them to spare Holungen. They explained that there were no more German soldiers left in the village, and that Holungen would offer no resistance. The inhabitants had hoisted a white flag with a red cross atop the church tower.

American troop movements continued through the area until 18 April, with the tank columns taking the first three days to pass through. The inhabitants could only use the main street between noon and 1 p.m. each day, and all the streets in the village were torn up by tank tracks. On 4 July 1945, Russian soldiers arrived in Holungen, the village lying only from the border with the British occupation zone (see this page about the GDR for a map of the zones). On 20 August the majority of the Russian troops withdrew and only a small garrison remained.

===East Germany, Reunificiation and the mines===
Thanks to the strongly held Catholic faith in the Eichsfeld, particularly in Holungen, the SED found it difficult to get a foothold in the area. Nevertheless, the GDR controlled everything. The situation was made worse by the proximity of Holungen to the Grenzsperrgebiet, the closed military exclusion zone that ran along the East German side of the border with the West. The neighbouring villages of Brehme and Jützenbach were located within this zone. This zone, part of a complex border system which extended several kilometres into the GDR, was intended to catch people trying to escape across the border to the West before they reached the actual border fences. Tourists were not permitted entry. Only those who lived in the zone or were visiting relatives in the zone, and had the necessary permits, could enter, making life additionally difficult for the many Holungers with friends and relatives living in the zone.

In the GDR period, the potash mine, now known as the “Thomas Müntzer” mine, was the largest employer in the region. From 1955 to 1961 the number of employees rose from 25 to nearly 300. Even in 1939, the mine had been the main potash source for the German war effort and was considered to be “Rüstungsindustriestufe SS” (“Armaments Industry – SS level”). It was the only mine delivering 98 to 99% by weight potassium chloride at the highest purity grade. These salts were used to produce explosives and other compounds important for the war effort. In 1977, the potassium salt was granted the “K1 price supplement” due to its consistent quality, receiving the “Q” quality mark two years later. From 1985 onwards the mine was the sole supplier of car seat position adjusters for the Wartburg. The mine also produced skylights and artificial fertiliser. In 1993, the mining company was closed. The closing of mine shafts resulted in nationwide attention for the potash miners, who took part in a lot of industrial action (Hunger strikes and a march to Berlin) under the slogan “Bischofferode ist überall” (“Bischofferode is everywhere”). Mining was of great importance for the neighbouring villages and created over 1,000 jobs. The economy of the region was slow to recover from this shock. Even though the mine was better-known in connection with Bischofferode, a large part of the operation was located in Holungen.

In Holungen after the “Wende” (Reunification), several streets were renovated. Many households got a telephone connection, mains gas, etc. In 1995 the second Eichfeld “Trachtenfest” (festival at which traditional costume is worn) was celebrated in Holungen. This festival resulted in various improvements to the village, for example the square around the pond and the fire station was redesigned.

==Population==
In 1900, Holungen numbered 671 people in 104 households. Each household had, on average, 5 to 7 people. Up to the start of the First World War, the number of inhabitants rose slowly. After the war, the increase continued as many people sought refuge in Holungen. From 1925 to 1940 the population declined. During the Second World War, many evacuees arrived, and so in 1945 the population exceeded a thousand for the first time, reaching 1,092 residents. In 1947, the population reached 1,332, which still stands as the highest-ever number today. After this time the total population decreased again slowly. In 1964, there were 1,080 people in 315 families. The number of extended families decreased ever more quickly. In 1978, the population was again below a thousand, rising above this again in 1983. In the Reunification year of 1990, it lay at 948, thereafter fluctuating around 1,000. In 2001 the number was 991, and at the start of 2003 only 978.

==People==
Holungen-born:
*Dr. Hermann Iseke (1856–1907) poet of the “Eichsfelder Sang” and other works.
*Anton Thraen (1843–1903) gave names to minor planets including 442 Eichsfeldia and 443 Photographia

==Associations==
The largest associations in Holungen are the Male Singers’ Society &quot;Einigkeit&quot; (&quot;Unity&quot;), the Church Choir &quot;Sankt Cäcilia&quot; (&quot;St Cecilia&quot;) the Local History Society &quot;Dr. Hermann Iseke Holungen&quot;, the &quot;Thomas-Müntzer-Kaliverein Bischofferode e.V.&quot; (&quot;Thomas Müntzer Potash Association of Bischofferode [Registered Charity]&quot;) and the Sports Association &quot;Blau-Weiß Holungen&quot; (&quot;Holungen Blue-and-White&quot;). Several traditions date back to the 19th century.

The Sports Association has had some success at faustball, the women&#x27;s team having been GDR Champions twice, although faustball is no longer played in Holungen. The men&#x27;s football team plays in Thüringen 2. Kreisklassen (Kreis Eichsfeld), Staffel 1 &quot;(Thuringia 2nd District classification (Eichsfeld district), group 1)&quot;. Here, too, past youth teams have had some success (District Champions, District Cup Winners, District Indoor Football Champions). Thanks to several year groups being under-represented in the village, Holungen is currently arranging Spielgemeinschaften (joint teams) with other villages (JSG Bodetal: &quot;Bode&quot; Valley Youth Joint Team).

In 1864 the Holungen Shooting Club was founded, although after the two World Wars a refounding wasn&#x27;t permitted. In spite of this, Holungen still has its shooting range. A similar situation holds for the amateur dramatics group, which had been known throughout the region – despite putting on a few performances after Reunification, it eventually folded.

<doc id="1028040" wikidata="Q4970858" url="?curid=1028040" title="British Rail Class 85">
<text>The British Rail Class 85 (also known by the designation AL5) is an electric locomotive that was designed and produced at British Rail’s (BR) Doncaster Works during the early 1960s. While largely developed by BR, much of its systems can be attributed to the British manufacturing interest Associated Electrical Industries (AEI). 

The locomotive was developed as a part of the programme of works to electrify the West Coast Main Line during the late 1950s and early 1960s. BR deliberately opted to procure multiple batches of locomotives from a range of manufacturers, leading to the procurement of five prototype classes (Classes 81-85) and subsequently placed a larger order for a refined model of one of these, eventually leading to the development of the Class 86 locomotive.

The Class 85 proved to be a relatively reliable workhorse of the London Midland region, particularly following a refurbishment during the 1970s that saw the replacement of their rectifiers. Some members of the type were in service for thirty years, their withdrawal having commenced during the mid 1980s and lasting into the early 1990s, having been effectively displaced by the arrival of newer types such as the and later . Following the retirement of the Class 85, a single example was preserved.

==Background==
During the late 1950s, British Rail (BR) embarked upon the electrification of the West Coast Main Line, a strategy which necessitated the procurement of a large number of electric locomotives to utilise the newly-installed infrastructure. A detailed specification, listing various performance attributes for such a locomotive, was produced by the British Transport Commission. 

It was decided that, instead of a bulk order from a single manufacturer, several batches of similar locomotives would be ordered from several companies, the first of these being the AL1 series. Further contracts were awarded, including one to BR&#x27;s own Doncaster Works, to procure a similar locomotive, thus resulting in the Class 85. Under the earlier BR classification, the type was given the designation &quot;AL5&quot; (meaning the fifth design of 25 kV AC locomotive), and locomotives were numbered E3056–E3095. 

While BR planned had intended for this procurement strategy to have led to work being spread out to a variety of different manufacturers, many of the systems used across the different prototype classes were similar or in some cases identical, having been supplied by the same firm, the Metropolitan-Vickers division of the British manufacturing group Associated Electrical Industries (AEI). Between 1961 and 1964, a total of forty such locomotives were constructed, all of which were built at Doncaster.

== Design ==
The Class 85 is an AC electric locomotive intended for express services on the West Coast Main Line. Its design bore considerable similarities to the earlier British Rail Class 81, particularly in terms of their shared AEI-supplied equipment. One key area of difference was its adoption of semiconductor-based rectifiers and a rheostatic braking system; the latter was viewed as likely to generate considerable cost savings in comparison to conventional braking by reducing wheel wear. A small proportion of the locomotive&#x27;s equipment, such as the bogies, were designed by the French industrial group Alstom.

In order to achieve the minimal weight requirement stipulated by BR, while still maintaining sufficient structural strength, the lower halves of the body sides were merged into the locomotive&#x27;s underframe, while the roof and sides above the base of the windows were built from a relatively light steel frame with an aluminium covering. The underframe is a welded steel assembly divided into seven box-like sections, while the bogie frame is built from rolled steel members that were welded together. On the outer faces of the underframe, the coupler and oleo-pneumatic buffers were fitted. The locomotive was seated upon each bogie via a double-ended rubber cone-shaped , the alignment of which was defined by a transverse spring anchorage. Much of the weight was carried by two sets of four spring-loaded side-bearers, which used rubber brushes wherever practical to eliminate the need for lubrication.

The Class 85 featured a sizeable power compartment, of which particular attention was paid to making it as accessible for maintenance purposes as was realistically possible. The bulk of the equipment was installed within two compartments, one containing the rectifier apparatus and the other accommodated the main transformer and associated equipment, while a walkway spanned the length of the power compartment for access purposes. Above the transformer was its roof-mounted radiator and cooling fans, while the braking resistors and motor contactor panel were positioned close by. In between the transformer unit and the rear bulkhead was the brake compressor, primary air reservoir, and the fault indicator panel. On the opposite side of the power compartment, next to the forward bulkhead, was the auxiliary compressor, battery charging apparatus, and a chemical toilet for the locomotive crew.

Power was delivered to the locomotive via overhead catenary, which was always energised at 25,000 V AC. However, the main transformer, which was normally operated with the four windings in series, could be operated at 6.25 kV AC with the transformer windings in parallel. This voltage was intended to be used where limited clearances gave concern over use of the higher voltage arcing onto lineside structures, especially those made of cast iron. Since the clearances were found to be adequate, the lower voltage connections were locked out of use. A standardised Stone-Faiveley AMBR pantograph was adopted for the type, which was raised using pressurised air, the power for which was provided via the battery-powered auxiliary air compressor.

Driver&#x27;s cabs are provided at both ends of the locomotive. The cabs are of double-skin construction, with a sheet steel exterior around a steel frame, and an inner lining of plastic-faced plywood along with fibreglass mouldings for the ceiling. Asbestos was also applied for its thermal insulation and soundproofing properties; several electric heater units were also present each of the cabs. The driving controls, which conformed to BR&#x27;s standard conventions of the era, were mounted on a sloped plastic-covered desk directly beneath the forward window; various instruments, light switches, indicators, and gauges lined the centre console. The master controller was to the right of the driver while the air brake controls were to the left.

==Operational history==

Upon their entry to service, the AL5 fleet was used to haul express trains on the then newly electrified West Coast Main Line, from Birmingham, to , Manchester Piccadilly, Liverpool, and later . By 1965, electrification had spread south to London Euston, allowing for services to be extended shortly thereafter.

The first 30 Class 85 locomotives were built with germanium rectifiers in their power systems, after which the final 10 used silicon-based rectifiers instead. Silicon rectifiers were retrofitted across the whole fleet by the end of 1986.

In 1968, the type was reclassified as Class 85 as a result of BR&#x27;s introduction of the TOPS numbering system. From 1971 onwards, locomotives were progressively renumbered into the 85001–85040 range. Fourteen locomotives were later converted for freight-only use, numbered in the 85/1 subclass. These locomotives were restricted to .

==Accidents and incidents==
* On 23 April 1983, 85027 caught fire while hauling a southbound intermodal train near Kings Langley. It was not returned to service.
* On 13 October 1985, 85001 caught fire while hauling the 16:15 Euston to Manchester service.
* On 27 April 1989, a passenger train hauled by 85012 was derailed near .

== Preservation ==
One locomotive has been preserved, 85101 (having previously numbered E3061 &amp; 85006) This locomotive is preserved by the AC Locomotive Group, who also have examples of Classes 81-84 and 86. at Barrow Hill Engine Shed. It was named to commemorate the 150th anniversary of Doncaster Works and is painted in &quot;Railfreight Distribution&quot; livery, a livery it never carried in service. Their intention is to eventually restore this locomotive to operational condition.

<doc id="1028044" wikidata="Q257222" url="?curid=1028044" title="Medical torture">
<text>Medical torture describes the involvement of, or sometimes instigation by, medical personnel in acts of torture, either to judge what victims can endure, to apply treatments which will enhance torture, or as torturers in their own right. Medical torture overlaps with medical interrogation if it involves the use of professional medical expertise to facilitate interrogation or corporal punishment, in the conduct of torturous human experimentation or in providing professional medical sanction and approval for the torture of prisoners. Medical torture also covers torturous scientific (or pseudoscientific) experimentation upon unwilling human subjects.

==Medical ethics and international law==
Medical torture fundamentally violates medical ethics, which all medical practitioners are expected to adhere to.
* The Hippocratic Oath makes explicit statements against deliberate harm not in the patient&#x27;s best interests. These statements are often translated as &quot;I will prescribe regimens for the good of my patients according to my ability and my judgment&quot; and &quot;to never deliberately do harm to anyone, for anyone else&#x27;s interest.&quot; (Note: these statements are formulations of the ethical principles of beneficence and non-maleficence.)
* In response to the Nazi human experimentation on prisoners during World War II, which were declared at the post-World War II Nuremberg Trials to be &quot;crimes against humanity&quot;, the World Medical Association developed the Declaration of Geneva to supplant the dated Hippocratic Oath. The Declaration of Geneva requires medical practitioners to state &quot;[I, the medical practitioner] will maintain the utmost respect for human life from its beginning even under threat and I will not use my medical knowledge contrary to the laws of humanity.&quot;
* The Nuremberg Trials also led to the emergence of the Nuremberg Code which explicitly outlines the boundaries of acceptable medical experimentation.
* Additionally in response to the Nazi atrocities, the Geneva Conventions of 1949 outright prohibits the torture of prisoners of war and other protected non-combatants.
* The World Medical Association Declaration of Tokyo (1975) makes a number of specific statements against torture, including &quot;The doctor shall not &quot;countenance&quot;, &quot;condone&quot; or &quot;participate in&quot; the practice of torture&quot;.
* Also the UN Convention Against Torture, which applies to medical personnel in addition to law enforcement officers, military personnel, politicians, and other persons acting in an official capacity, prohibits the use of torture under any circumstance. Under Article 2(2) of the Convention, it states that &quot;No exceptional circumstances whatsoever, whether a state of war or a threat of war, internal political instability or any other public emergency, may be invoked as a justification of torture.&quot;
* The UN Principles of Medical Ethics relevant to the Role of Health Personnel, particularly Physicians, in the Protection of Prisoners and Detainees against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (UN.1982) applies specifically to medical and other health workers but it has no implementation mechanism to ensure enforcement. It is up to state, provincial, and national bodies to enforce the standards in the document.
* The development of command responsibility established criminal liability for all people, including physicians, involved in crimes against humanity.

There remain gaps in regulation relating to medical torture in many countries. A higher standard of behaviour is expected of health professionals yet the UN Principles of Medical Ethics are not enforceable when governments are complicit in violations. This higher standard is reflected in the principles of beneficence, non-maleficence (above all do no harm), autonomy, justice, dignity and informed consent and these are not covered comprehensively by the UN Convention Against Torture.

==Examples==
* Between 1937 and 1945, Japanese medical personnel who were part of Unit 731 participated in the torture and murder of as many as 10,000 Chinese, Russian, Korean, American and other prisoners as well as Allied POWs during the second Sino-Japanese War.
* During World War II, inmates in Nazi concentration camps were subjected to medical experiments. Josef Mengele was the most notorious perpetrator, earning him the nickname &quot;Angel of Death&quot;. Some doctors also ensured that inmates were painfully executed. For example, Hermann Fischer-Hüllstrung, who played a role in executing notable inmates such as Dietrich Bonhoeffer, &quot;had the job of reviving political prisoners after they had been hanged until they were almost dead, in order to prolong the agony of their dying.&quot;
* Between 1970 and 1971, British security forces used the five techniques against a number of detainees in Northern Ireland during the Troubles. After this came to the Irish government&#x27;s attention, they filed a case to the European Commission for Human Rights, who ruled that use of the five techniques constituted torture. However, the European Court of Human Rights subsequently ruled that usage of the five techniques did not constitute torture but still qualified as cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.
* In Soviet mental hospitals used to hold political prisoners, very unpleasant medications were given to these &quot;patients&quot; as a means of punishment. A psychiatric diagnosis was devised to describe people who oppose government policies.
* In 1978, &quot;Pisaot menuh&quot; (&quot;Human Experiments&quot;) were performed on seventeen political prisoners held at the infamous prison Tuol Sleng in Phnom Penh under the Khmer Rouge.
* A study called &quot;The Aversion Project&quot; found that gay conscripts in the South African Defence Forces (SADF) during the apartheid era had been forced to submit to &quot;curing&quot; their homosexuality, both by electroshock therapies and by botched sex changes.
* There have been numerous claims that electroconvulsive therapy and prefrontal lobotomies and similar psychiatric treatments have sometimes been performed not in the patient&#x27;s best interests, but rather as punishment for misbehaviour or to otherwise make the patient easier to manage. A classic example of this is the Lake Alice, New Zealand atrocity which occurred in the early 1970s. Children admitted to the Lake Alice Hospital&#x27;s open child and adolescent unit were routinely punished with unmodified ECT (that is, ECT without anesthesia). Some governments (e.g. Norway and New Zealand) have since begun paying reparations to patients who suffered such treatments. The World Health Organization has called for a ban on unmodified ECT, and states no form of it should be used on children.
* In 2016, a group consisting of 71 British medical doctors urged that Israel&#x27;s membership in the World Medical Association should be revoked, alleging that Israeli doctors performed state-endorsed &quot;medical torture&quot; on Palestinians. However, no official motion for expulsion was ever filed, nor were these allegations upheld by the World Medical Association.

==Purported medical or professional complicity==
According to the Center for Constitutional Rights&#x27; When Healers Harm campaign, health professionals were complicit in the torture and abuse of detainees during U.S. President George W. Bush&#x27;s &quot;war on terror&quot;. Health professionals, including medical doctors, psychiatrists, medical examiners, psychologists, and nurses, have been implicated in the torture and abuse of prisoners in CIA secret prisons and military detention centers, such as those in Guantánamo, Afghanistan, and Iraq.

Health professionals are accused of:

* crafting abusive tactics and falsely legitimizing their use;
* advised interrogators on methods of abuse that would exploit prisoners’ vulnerabilities;
* using medical procedures to harm prisoners;
* gauging pain and monitoring interrogations that risked leaving prisoners in need of treatment;
* checking prisoners to certify that they were capable of surviving additional abuse;
* conditioning medical or mental health treatment on cooperation with interrogation;
* sharing confidential patient information that was used to harm patients;
* covering up evidence of torture and abuse; and
* turning a blind eye to cruel treatment.

To date, no state licensing boards or professional associations have investigated – or recognized, in some cases – abusive conduct by individual members of their professions. In 2009, after years of denial, the American Psychological Association finally recognized that psychologists had engaged in torture. However, the American Psychological Association has not recognized that psychologists were involved in the Bush Administration’s torture policy. Some criticize the APA for failing to respond to allegations of “collusion between APA officials and the national security apparatus in providing ethical cover for psychologists’ participation in detainee abuse.&quot;

Although the American Medical Association has made clear that physicians should not be involved in interrogations of any kind, it continues to insist that it has “no specific knowledge of doctors being involved in abuse or torture,” despite evidence to the contrary, including government documents and Office of Legal Counsel memos, a report by the International Committee of the Red Cross and multiple accounts by survivors.

Some other accounts of medical or professional complicity in torture include:
*The SERE (&quot;Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape&quot;) program&#x27;s chief psychologist, Col. Morgan Banks, issued guidance in early 2003 for the &quot;behavioral science consultants&quot; who helped to devise Guantánamo&#x27;s interrogation strategy although he has emphatically denied that he had advocated the use of SERE counter-resistance techniques to break down detainees. The &quot;New Yorker&quot; notes that in November, 2001 Banks was detailed to Afghanistan, where he spent four months at Bagram Air Base, &quot;supporting combat operations against Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters&quot;.
*Confidential medical records of Guantánamo prisoners were used to identify physical and psychological weaknesses that could be exploited during abusive interrogation.
* A 2005 report by Human Rights Watch suggested that torture was routine under the appointed Iraqi government.
* Dr. J. C. Carothers, British colonial Kenyan psychiatrist, has been implicated by some recent academic historians in designing interrogation of Mau Mau prisoners. His advice was published by the Kenya Government as &quot;The Psychology of Mau Mau&quot;, in 1954.
*Similarly, it has been implied that Interim Iraqi Prime Minister Dr. Ayad Allawi violated his obligation to medical ethics whilst serving as Western European chief of secret police for the Baathist government of Saddam Hussein. However, the same sources allege that Allawi had abandoned his medical education at that point and his medical degree &quot;was conferred upon him by the Baath party.&quot;

==In fiction==

* Actor Michael Palin plays a medical torturer in Director Terry Gilliam&#x27;s 1985 dark comedic dystopian film &quot;Brazil&quot;.
* In the film adaptation of George Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; the main character, Winston Smith, is subjected to medical torture by the thought police.
* Actor Gregory Peck plays Nazi medical torturer Josef Mengele in Director Franklin J. Schaffner&#x27;s &quot;The Boys from Brazil&quot;.
* Actor Laurence Olivier plays Nazi torturer dentist Christian Szell in Director John Schlesinger&#x27;s 1976 &quot;Marathon Man&quot;.
* The film &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot;, starring Jack Nicholson, depicts abuse of psychiatric techniques including electroconvulsive therapy and lobotomy.
* In the popular series, &quot;24&quot;, various forms of medical torture (including hallucinogens and injections) are utilized to obtain confessions and information from high-threat terrorists being interrogated in the fictional Counter-Terrorist Unit (CTU) of the United States.
* In Anthony Burgess&#x27; book &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;, Alex, the anti-hero of the book, undergoes a fictional medical torture program called &#x27;The Ludovico Technique&#x27;, in which he is given a nausea-inducing drug, strapped to a chair with his eyelids forced open and forced to watch hours of films of extreme violence and rape to condition him to associate feelings of nausea with rape and violence.
* The theme of the 2009 horror film &quot;The Human Centipede (First Sequence)&quot; is that of a sadistic, psychopathic retired surgeon torturing three people by surgically connecting them mouth to rectum, forcing the last two to swallow the excrement of the person in front of them and physically beating all three of them if they try to rebel or escape.
* The 2008 horror film &quot;Autopsy&quot; focused on an insane doctor who runs a hospital where victims are lured in and experimented with, so that the doctor can find a cure for his wife&#x27;s terminal disease.
* In the book &quot;Dearly Devoted Dexter&quot; by Jeff Lindsay the central antagonist is a character nicknamed &#x27;Dr. Danco&#x27; who surgically removes all body parts not necessary for life from his victims as what is revealed to be forfeits in a twisted game of hangman, carrying out the operations with the victim conscious and watching the procedures in a mirror.
* The multi-perspective novel &quot;The Sea and Poison&quot; (Shusaku Endo, 1957; translated by Michael Gallagher) depicts the vivisection experiments performed by Japanese doctors on American soldiers during World War II. Kei Kumai&#x27;s 1986 drama film &quot;The Sea and Poison&quot; is based on this book (original film title &quot;Umi to dokuyaku&quot;).
* Dr. Jane Payne, a character in the children&#x27;s book &quot;Wayside School Gets A Little Stranger&quot;, is a sadistic dentist who pulls more teeth than is necessary in order to get extra money.
* In the Ajin manga, the Ajins are immortal humans who are captured and tracked by the government in order to become test subjects for medical torture, and many experiments which implies amputations without anesthesia, repeated murdering and torture for studying their immortality.

<text>The Muttahida Majlis–e–Amal (MMA; Urdu: , ) is a political alliance consisting of conservative, Islamist, religious, and right-wing parties of Pakistan. Naeem Siddiqui (the founder of Tehreek e Islami) proposed such an alliance of all the religious parties back in the 1990s.

Qazi Hussain Ahmad endeavored for it and due to his efforts, it was formed in 2002 in a direct opposition to the policies led by President Pervez Musharraf to support for the War in Afghanistan. The alliance more densely consolidated its position during the nationwide general elections held in 2002. The JUI(F) led by its leader, the cleric Fazl-ur-Rahman, retained most of the political momentum in the alliance. The MMA retained the provisional government of Khyber–Pakhtunkhwa and remained in alliance with PMLQ in Balochistan. Much public criticism and disapproval nonetheless grew against the alliance.

Despite its conservatism, the alliance survived for a short period of time, when the JUI(F) left the alliance over the political disagreement on the issues of boycotting the general elections held in 2008. The JUI(F) later becoming an integral part in the government led by the left-wing Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and refused to revive the alliance in 2012, before the upcoming 2013 elections, in opposition to PPP.

==Background==
===Historical and academic accounts===
The MMA conglomeration of distinct Islamist parties that ran under a single banner during the nationwide general elections held in 2002. Islamist movements are defined as those which derive inspiration from the Islamic scriptures, the &quot;Qur&#x27;an&quot; and &quot;Hadith&quot;, and then vie to come to power in a state. Historically, the literature concerning Islamism and Muslim political institutions has been propagated via the Orientalist discourse, where the rejection of certain post-Enlightenment, national, and secular values has been translated into such movements&#x27; nature.

In fact, much of Islamism and its ideology are critiqued as a launching pad for fundamentalism and radicalism, as political movements such as Hezbollah, Hamas, and the ‘Islamic’ revolution of Iran are highlighted. However, social science and ethnographic work has proven that Islamism emerges from middle-class lay intellectuals concentrated in urban centers.

===Activism and politics===
The Islamic political parties united on a single platform in 1993 as &quot;Islamic Front&quot; but competition ensued between conservative PML(N) and leftist PPP forced the front into split when the JUI(F) decided to opt in support of Benazir Bhutto of PPP against the Pakistan Muslim League. Overall in the 1990s, the Islamic influence in the politics was very limited in the public.

After the deadly terrorist attacks on the United States in September 2001, the religious extremism began to grow in a military response to these attacks. The Islamic political parties formed the think tank, known as Pakistan-Afghanistan Defense Council (later known as Pakistan Defence Council), yet the formation of the MMA in 2001 was the first time such a coalition entered the electoral process.

Despite its huge mass, populism, and support, the MMA alliance only retained 63 seats whilst the PPP retained 94 seats and the President Musharraf&#x27;s PML(Q) securing 124 seats during the general elections held in 2002. The alliance comprised the following notable groups:
# Jamiat Ulema-e-Pakistan (JUP): A traditional Sunni-(Aqeeda-e-Sawad-e-Azam of Aaulia, Sufia) political party which is popular with traditional and folk Muslims in rural areas of Sindh and Punjab. They chant the slogan as the &#x27;love slogan&#x27; of their party.
# The Jamiat Ulama-e-Islam: The party is led by Fazal-ur-Rehman who became widely known for his vocal and strong support for Benazir Bhutto and the Pakistan Peoples Party in the 1990s. The JUI(F) was politically influential, got more hardlines, and had traditional stream of thinking – with popular appeal amongst clerics, Pashtuns and Baloch of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. The JUI(F) later became an integral part in PPP led government formed in 2008–13.
# Tehrik-e-Jafaria Pakistan (TJP): The party is led by Syed Sajid Ali Naqvi. The Shiite and ultraconservative party that played a crucial role in uniting the &quot;Shia&quot; masses to offer support to MMA. Its political influence was also less in the alliance&#x27;s political shifts. Historically, it has foreign support and ties with Iran.
# Jamiat Ahle Hadith (JAH): Although a missionary political party, the JAH derives itself from the Ahl-al-Hadith movement.

==Rise to power==
The success of MMA can be attributed to the context-specific, political environment of the 2002 elections, due to the region&#x27;s geopolitical significance following the Afghanistan invasion, military-civilian relations, and the threat of religion under secular authoritarian rule. Leading up to the 2002 elections, the PPP and the PML-N were severely handicapped as elite members of their respective parties were charged with corruption under the military regime, and thus, under the Legal Framework Ordinances (LFO), were rendered incapable of running for office.

In addition, the government exempted the MMA from standard campaign conduct, for their use of loudspeakers, street rallies, and anti-government inflammatory rhetoric which was not objected to by the government.

Another form of assistance from the government came in the revision of article 8a of the constitution, where a graduation clause required degrees from accredited universities, which included JI and JIU-F affiliated &#x27;madaris&#x27;, for participation in the electoral process. Such a clause restricted the ANP in its strongholds in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, and thus favored the MMA.

However, in addition to the military prioritizing and providing several concessions to the MMA in its rise to legitimacy, ideological pragmatism as a campaign strategy lifted the 5 party alliance into Pakistan&#x27;s mainstream political institutions. Given the destabilized nature of the PPP and PML-N, the MMA benefited from the &quot;ideological bankruptcy,&quot; monopolizing on the public&#x27;s sentiment towards the U.S. involvement in Afghanistan. Also, in public, the MMA remained confrontational and opposed Musharraf for his partnership with the U.S, his promotion of &quot;enlightened moderation&quot;, and his refusal to take off his uniform despite making several promises to do so. The MMA&#x27;s political program highlighted its nationalist, populist tendencies, while hindering its religious rhetoric. Leading up to the elections, the MMA composed a 15-point manifesto as follows:

#To revive fear of God, affection to the Islamic Prophet Mohammed and service to people with particular emphasis on government officials and cabinet members.
#To make Pakistan a true Islamic welfare state to ensure justice to people and eradicate corruption whatsoever.
#To ensure provision of bread, clothes, shelter, education, jobs and marriage expenses to all citizens.
#To protect basic human rights (life, property and honour) of citizens
#To create an independent, just and humane economic system where citizens will be provided opportunities for &#x27;halal&#x27; (legitimate) jobs, business, and investments.
#To ensure uniform and quick justice to every citizen, from the president to a layman.
#To develop God-fearing, helping, brave and protecting police system.
#To get the entire society literate within ten years to enable everyone to know one&#x27;s rights and responsibilities.
#To ensure compulsory and free of charge education up to matriculation (high school level) and provide opportunities to meritorious students and scholars for advanced research.
#To protect rights of women guaranteed by Islam and restoration of their honour and prestige.
#To abolish all chronic and new feudal systems with forfeiture of illegal wealth and its distribution among the poor.
#To provide lands to peasants and farmers for their livelihood and guarantee reasonable prices for their produce.
#To protect provincial autonomy and district governments, taking care of backward areas and classes and taking special steps to get them at par with developed areas.
#To get the country and people rid of imperialistic forces and their local agents.
#To extend moral, political and diplomatic help and support to all suppressed with particular emphasis on Kashmiris, Palestinians, and Afghans.

The MMA&#x27;s manifesto relies on heavy promises towards social services, eradication of foreign imperialism, extinguish corruption and exercise justice, while highlighting local and international struggles towards autonomy. Although the implementations of Shari’a and gender segregation were cornerstones to the MMA&#x27;s ideology, such goals were vague and rarely highlighted during election campaigns. In addition, its relative passiveness against Musharraf&#x27;s incumbent regime helped the party&#x27;s cause, such as exemption from restrictions on public rallies and madrassa registration.

Such political strategies worked for the MMA in Balochistan and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Due to the Balochi nationalists’ fragmentation following the withdrawal of the Soviets from the region and its failure to denounce the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan, the Balochi incumbents were viewed as Musharraf sympathizers. In the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the MMA performed well due to the high number of Pakhtuns, who received the MMA&#x27;s policies towards anti-imperialism well. The coalition consisted of large numbers of ethnic Pakhtuns, and thus was active in organizing demonstrations against the plight of Afghan Pakhtuns under siege. In Sindh, the MMA won popular support, and five out of twenty National Assembly seats, by attacking the incumbent party, the MQM. Highlighting their history of extortion and lack of progress towards addressing social concerns, the MMA rallied the masses through its &#x27;madaris&#x27; networks to voice their position and pile up votes on Election Day.

Through utilizing the several concessions made by the military regime, exploiting ideological and public weaknesses of incumbent parties, and politicizing the Afghan invasion, the MMA was able to secure eleven percent of the popular vote and 58 seats in the National Assembly. Given the conditions of the election, which were limited and not free under the watchful eye of the military-government, the MMA&#x27;s ascension does not seem as surprising. However, in the following years, leading up to the 2008 election, the MMA was further exposed to the public and held publicly accountable.

==Collapse of MMA==

The MMA&#x27;s success in the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, Balochistan, and the city government of Karachi were the transient events, as seen in the alliance&#x27;s split in the 2005 elections and official collapse in the 2008 elections.

Over the years, the public disapproval of MMA nonetheless grew and found itself in a tough situation in its competition with more resourceful and influential Alliance for Restoration of Democracy. Although the Military-MMA relationship is pertinent to the party&#x27;s demise, the MMA&#x27;s fate can be more accurately ascribed to its relationship to other secular institutions, individual and organizational corruption, and competing Islamisms. The MMA&#x27;s actions while serving in the government portray the party&#x27;s ideological fissures, its inadequacy in serving the public and delivering campaign promises, and its illiteracy in realpolitik. With such exposed shortcomings while serving as constituents in Pakistan&#x27;s democratic institutions, the MMA was evaluated on the basis of its performance, and was duly rejected in the subsequent provincial and national elections.

==Restoration==
The restoration of MMA took place on 9 November 2017 in a second meeting at Mansoorah, Lahore in the presence of five Islamic parties Jamiat Ulama-e-Islam, Jamaat-e-Islami, Markazi Jamiat Ahle Hadith, Islami Tehreek and Jamiat Ulema-e-Pakistan and other religious parties. While the formal announcement took place on 14 December 2017 at Karachi and thus MMA was revived.

Fazal-ur-Rehman became head of MMA in March 2018, a political alliance of above-mentioned 5 religious parties. Alliance&#x27;s five parties would have one election symbol, one flag and one election campaign manifesto.

On 11th March 2019, Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) has formally parted ways with Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal (MMA). “The JI will not conduct any future programme under the banner of the MMA,” announced the JI Central Executive Council (Shoora).

<doc id="1028060" wikidata="Q5138483" url="?curid=1028060" title="Coat of arms of North Dakota">
<text>The coat of arms of North Dakota was created for use by the state government and National Guard units . An image of the coat of arms is seen on the flag of the governor of North Dakota and a short discussion of its use can be found at the North Dakota state government website.

==Heraldic description==
Section 54-41-01 of the North Dakota Century Code specifies the design (blazon) of the coat of arms thus;
:Device: On an Indian arrowhead point to base Or a bend vert charged with three mullets of the first, in base a fleur-de-lis of the second.
:Crest: On a wreath Or and azure, a sheaf of three arrows argent armed and flighted gules behind a stringed bow fessways Or with grip of the second (gules).
:Motto: Strength from the soil.

==Allusions==
The allusions made in the arms are laid down in section 54-41-02 NDCC:
:&quot;The colors of yellow gold and green are indicative of the great agricultural state of North Dakota and has particular reference to ripening grain and the abundant grazing areas. The Indian arrowhead forms the shield of the coat of arms and symbolizes the &quot;Sioux State.&quot; The three stars denote the trinity of government; legislative, executive, and judicial. Each star in the bend is given the heraldic value of thirteen which signifies the thirteen original colonies of the United States, and the cumulative numerical value of the three stars indicates that North Dakota was the thirty-ninth state admitted to the Union. The stars also allude to the history of the territory under three foreign flags. Three stars are borne upon the coat of arms of Meriwether Lewis of the Lewis and Clark expedition and also on the coat of arms of Lord Selkirk, head of the first permanent settlement in this state. The fleur-de-lis alludes to La Vérendrye, a North American French explorer who was the first known white man to visit the territory of this state. The blue and gold wreath in the crest reflects the history of the territory as part of the Louisiana purchase. The crest which shall constitute the military crest of the state of North Dakota is a motif taken from the state seal and to the Sioux Indian tribes signifies mighty warriors.&quot;

==Limits of use==
Section 54-41-03 limits use of the symbol to the following:
* The governor of North Dakota
* The North Dakota National Guard
* Departments and agencies of the state of North Dakota
* North Dakota veterans organizations
* Officially recognized North Dakota educational institutions, systems, or divisions thereof
* Recognized North Dakota &quot;patriotic organizations&quot;.

==Other uses==
* The North Dakota Army National Guard uses the crest of the coat of arms as their shoulder sleeve insignia.

<doc id="1028067" wikidata="Q455876" url="?curid=1028067" title="France Nuyen">
<text>France Nuyen (born France Nguyễn Vân Nga on 31 July 1939) is a French-American actress, model, and psychological counselor. She is known to film audiences for playing romantic leads in &quot;South Pacific&quot; (1958), &quot;Satan Never Sleeps&quot; (1962), and &quot;A Girl Named Tamiko&quot; (also 1962), and for playing Ying-Ying St. Clair in &quot;The Joy Luck Club&quot; (1993). She also originated the title role in the Broadway play &quot;The World of Suzie Wong&quot;, based on the novel of the same name. She is a Theatre World Award winner and Golden Globe Award nominee.

==Early life==
Nuyen was born France Nguyễn Vân Nga in Marseille, the daughter of a Romani French mother and a father from French Indochina. Her father is widely reported to be Viet; however, Nuyen identifies him and herself as Chinese or Hoa. Nuyen’s father abandoned her and her mother when she was young, and she was raised in Marseille by a cousin she calls &quot;an Orchidaceae raiser who was the only person who gave a damn about me.&quot; During World War II, her mother and grandfather were persecuted by the Nazis for being Romani.

Having left school at the age of 11, she began studying art and became an artist&#x27;s model. She was later signed to Candy Jones’ agency, and moved to New York City at age 16. In 1955, while working as a seamstress, Nuyen was discovered on the beach by &quot;Life&quot; photographer Philippe Halsman. She was featured on the cover of 6 October 1958 issue of &quot;Life&quot;.

==Career==
France Nuyen became a motion picture actress in 1958. In her first role, she appeared as Liat, daughter of Bloody Mary (played by Juanita Hall), in the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical &quot;South Pacific&quot;.

In 1978 Nuyen guest-starred with Peter Falk and Louis Jourdan in the &quot;Columbo&quot; episode &quot;Murder Under Glass&quot;. In 1986 she joined the cast of &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; as Dr. Paulette Kiem, remaining until the series ended in 1988.

Nuyen appeared in several films including &quot;The Last Time I Saw Archie&quot; (1961) &quot;Satan Never Sleeps&quot; (1962), &quot;A Girl Named Tamiko&quot; (1962), &quot;Diamond Head&quot; (1963), &quot;Dimension 5&quot; (1966), &quot;Battle for the Planet of the Apes&quot; (1973), &quot;The Joy Luck Club&quot; (1993), and &quot;The American Standards&quot; (2008).

===With William Shatner===
France Nuyen worked several times with actor William Shatner. At age 19, she was cast in Shatner&#x27;s 1958 Broadway play &quot;The World of Suzie Wong&quot;. After a dubious initial opening, the play ran for more than 500 performances and was quite financially successful. Both Nuyen and Shatner later collected notable accolades for their work on the show at the 1959 Theatre World Awards.

Nuyen worked again with Shatner across three US television projects, starting with &quot;Elaan of Troyius&quot;, a 1968 third season episode of the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; in which Nuyen was the title character. She would later appear with Shatner in the 1973 made-for-TV movie &quot;The Horror at 37,000 Feet&quot;, and afterward in a 1974 episode of the &quot;Kung Fu&quot; series entitled &quot;A Small Beheading&quot;.

==Personal life==

Nuyen had many on-and-off relationships, most notably an affair with Marlon Brando in 1960. From 1963 to 1966, Nuyen was married to Thomas Gaspar Morell, a psychiatrist from New York, by whom she has a daughter, Fleur, who resides in Canada and works as a film make-up artist. She met her second husband, Robert Culp, while appearing in four episodes of his television series &quot;I Spy&quot;. They married in 1967, but divorced three years later. 
In 1986, Nuyen earned a master&#x27;s degree in clinical psychology and began a second career as a counselor for abused women and children and women in prison. She received a Woman of the Year award in 1989 for her psychology work. In the &quot;Life&quot; cover story on Nuyen, she is quoted as saying a proverb she also repeated in character as a spy in the &quot;I Spy&quot; episode &quot;Magic Mirror&quot;: &quot;I am Chinese. I am a stone. I go where I am kicked.&quot;

As of 2019, she resides in Beverly Hills.

<text>Pier Antonio Mezzastris (or Pierantonio Mezastris; c. 1430 – c. 1506) was an Italian painter of the Quattrocento, painting in a somewhat provincial style for the time.

He was born at Foligno in Umbria. He painted religious subjects, working mostly in fresco, and was a local painter, in that all of his known works can be found within 15 km (10 mi) of his hometown, except for two frescoes in Narni. Though his subjects are very limited, his work is good, marked by technical ability and polish combined with elegance and delicacy of feeling. He is described as a follower of Benozzo Gozzoli. He should not be confused with Bernardino Mezzastris, a much lesser artist, possibly his son. His sister, Onofria, married Matteo da Gualdo, a painter from Foligno and active in Ancona and Norcia.

==Works==
Definite works by Mezzastris include:

*Foligno:
**&quot;Madonna &amp; Saints&quot; (1486) and other detached frescoes now in Pinacoteca Civica, 
**Large monochrome fresco in the church of San Domenico
**&quot;Madonna &amp; Child with St Lucia and St Claire&quot;, fresco (1471) in monastery of S. Lucia
**&quot;Madonna &amp; Child with Two Female Saints&quot;, fresco in monastery of S. Anna
**&quot;Madonna &amp; Child with Angels, Saints, and Sibyls&quot;, in the church of Madonna della Fiamenga
**Frescoes in the church of S. Maria in Campis, 2 km (1 mi) from Foligno
**&quot;Madonna &amp; Saints&quot;, frescoes in church of Vescia, 5 km (3 mi) from Foligno
*elsewhere:
**Oratorio dei Pellegrini in Assisi: the frescoes of the vault, depicting the Doctors of the Church; on the walls, frescoes of St Anthony Abbot blessing the Camels, and of the Miracles of St James
**&quot;Crucifixion&quot; (1482) in the convent of S. Damiano near Assisi
**&quot;Madonna Worshipping the Child, with St Francis and St Anthony of Padua&quot;, in the church of S. Martino of Trevi
**&quot;St Anthony&#x27;s Niche&quot;, with several frescoes, in the church of S. Francesco of Montefalco
**Scenes from the life of St Francis, and Two Scenes from the life of St Benedict, in church of S. Francesco in Narni

Attributed to Mezzastris are:
*&quot;St Francis receiving Stigmata&quot;, in monastery of S. Anna of Foligno
*&quot;St Francis receiving Stigmata&quot; in San Girolamo, Spello
*&quot;Crucifixion&quot; (fresco, damaged), in church of S. Vincenzo of Bevagna
*&quot;Madonna and Child with Angel&quot; (very damaged), in church of S. Agostino of Montefalco
*&quot;Deposition&quot;, fresco in the Duomo of Narni
*&quot;St. Roch and the Redeemer&quot; (ca. 1480) &quot; painting in the Church of San Giacomo (Foligno)

<doc id="1028080" wikidata="Q3232057" url="?curid=1028080" title="Japantown, Vancouver">
<text>Japantown, Little Tokyo or  is an old neighbourhood in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, located east of Gastown and north of Chinatown, that once had a concentration of Japanese immigrants.

Japantown ceased to be a distinct Japanese ethnic area during World War II when Japanese Canadians had their property confiscated and were interned. Although some Japanese returned after the war, the community never revived to its original state as the properties of Japanese Canadians were permanently forfeited by the Canadian government. As Japantown ceased to exist, the area is often referred to and marketed as Railtown by real estate developers.

==History==
Japantown was attacked on 7 September 1907 by the Asiatic Exclusion League, which smashed many windows in parts of Chinatown, and then moved on to Japantown. Four waves of attacks ensued, with the mob repulsed by armed Japantown residents who had received warning of the attacks in Chinatown. In spite of injuries inflicted by the residents, the rioters smashed the windows of more than 50 stores and businesses on Powell Street, causing thousands of dollars of damage. The centenary of the attacks was marked by a Riot Walk through Chinatown and Japantown on 7 September 2007.

Prior to World War II, in addition to having many restaurants, hotels and businesses, the district was home to three Japanese daily papers (Tiriku Nippo, Canada Shimbun, and Minshu), three Buddhist churches, several sentō (Chitose, Tokiwa, Kotobuki, and Matsunoyu), and a Japanese language school with as many as one thousand students. By 1921, the number of Japanese stores and businesses on the street had reached 578. The kenjinkai (prefecture association) organized mutual aid for the community, mitigating the need for welfare during the Great Depression.

During World War II, Japanese Canadians had their property confiscated and were sent to internment camps and prisoner of war camps, and Japantown ceased to be a distinct Japanese ethnic area. Although some Japanese returned to the area after the war, the community never revived as the properties confiscated by the Canadian government were never returned. The area is now part of Strathcona in the Downtown Eastside and the area is informally known as Railtown.

Along Powell Street, a few remnants of the former Japanese neighbourhood still exist. The Vancouver Buddhist Church, formerly the Japanese Methodist Church, still exists at 220 Jackson Avenue at Powell, as does the Vancouver Japanese Language School and Japanese Hall at 475 and 487 Alexander Street at Jackson, which is the only property in Canada that was ever returned to Japanese Canadians after World War II. Until the boom in Japanese restaurants in the 1980s, two restaurants on Powell Street were among the only Japanese dining establishments in the city.

==Oppenheimer Park==
Oppenheimer Park (Powell Street Grounds) in this area was the home for Asahi baseball team and it is the site for the annual two-day Powell Street Festival, which began in 1977. It is held every August, in the first weekend of the month, and is a community celebration of Japanese heritage as well as the alternative and street culture of the Downtown Eastside.

<text>Uncle Wiggily Longears is the main character of a series of children&#x27;s stories by American author Howard R. Garis. He began writing the stories for the &quot;Newark News&quot; in 1910. Garis penned an Uncle Wiggily story every day (except Sundays) for more than 52 years, and published 79 books in his lifetime. According to his obituary in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, a walk in the woods in Verona, New Jersey was his inspiration. The books featured work by several illustrators, notably Lansing Campbell. Other illustrators of the series included George L. Carlson, Louis Wisa, Elmer Rache, Edward Bloomfield, Lang Campbell, and Mary and Wallace Stover.
==Characters and stories==
Uncle Wiggily, an engaging elderly rabbit, is lame from rheumatism. Wherever he goes, he always relies on a red, white, and blue crutch—described as being &quot;striped like a barber-pole&quot;, or, in later episodes, &quot;his candy-striped walking cane&quot;, with spiral red-and-white striping like a peppermint candy stick.

Uncle Wiggily is only one of many recurring characters in the series. For example, the Pipsisewah is an unsavory bully who appears as a rhinoceros-like creature. His head has a snout with two small horns and large, snorting nostrils; he wears a black, conical cloth hat and patched scarlet trousers, is stout with a giraffe-skin body and bovine tail, and walks upright on two legs. As do the other characters, he has hands, but boar&#x27;s hooves for feet. He is normally accompanied by the crow-like Skeezicks, in his tall red cap and red-and-yellow-striped suit, and the two of them rarely engage in anything other than mischief harmless to the other characters in the storyline. The Bazumpus, the Crozokus, and the Scuttlemagoon appear less frequently, but are just as outlandish as the aforementioned &quot;Pip&quot; and &quot;Skee&quot;, and always require appropriate &quot;handling&quot; by Uncle Wiggily—often with the aid of his animal friends.

There are also several other &quot;bad chaps&quot; in the stories: the Woozy Wolf, Bushy Bear, Skillery Skallery Alligator and the fierce Bobcat, to name but a few. They all seem bent on nibbling the &quot;souse&quot; off Uncle Wiggily&#x27;s ears, but he always escapes. In shorter, more formulaic stories, his escape is generally enabled by some implement he has just purchased at the store—often while on an errand for his muskrat housekeeper, Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy. For example, Uncle Wiggily once used an umbrella to foil the Skillery Skallery Alligator by thrusting it into the creature&#x27;s mouth and opening it, thus preventing his biting the old gentleman rabbit.

Uncle Wiggily also encounters amicable animal characters from his neighborhood, such as Sammie and Susie Littletail (Uncle Wiggily&#x27;s young nephew and niece), Lulu, Alice, and Jimmie Wibblewobble (duck children), Dr. Possum (local physician), Uncle Butter (goat), Charlie and Arabella Chick, Jackie and Peetie Bow-Wow, Billie and Johnnie Bushytail (squirrel boys), Joie, Tommie, and Kittie Kat, Jennie Chipmunk, Munchie Trot (pony boy), Dottie and Willie Lambkin, Neddie and Beckie Stubtail (friendly bear cubs), as well as many others. In shorter stories, Uncle Wiggily is frequently found helping several of these friends out of some kind of predicament just before one of the bad chaps enters the picture, intent on obtaining &quot;ear-nibbles&quot; from their hapless victims. In longer stories, Uncle Wiggily often is off on a camping trip or other extended journey with one of his friends, fending off repeated incursions or baffling mean-spirited pranks from a lurking villain or two—not uncommonly with the aid of his crutch or a &quot;thing-a-ma-bob&quot; he happens to have brought along in his satchel.

==Board game==
The Uncle Wiggily Game has been manufactured for more than a century. In 1916 Milton Bradley began selling a board game that has players taking cards that show how far they can move their Uncle Wiggily figurines across the board. The game was modified in 1929, 1947 and 1955. In 1987 Parker Brothers bought the rights to the game, and made further changes. As of 2018 Winning Moves was manufacturing the Uncle Wiggily Game.

==In popular culture==
Uncle Wiggley was the name of a small skateboard company that operated from 1984 to 1990 and was known for using &quot;epoxyglass&quot; in their skateboard manufacturing. In addition to making their own products, they also made skateboards decks for Losi, Blockhead, SGI, Magnusson Designs and Steadham Designs, as well as early H-Street decks. Sponsored professionals included Tony Magnusson (who was a part-owner) and John Schultes.

Uncle Wiggly was a 1990s-era rock band.

Uncle Wiggly&#x27;s was also the name of a Baltimore-based chain of ice cream shops that was closed in January 2020.

A two-part song regarding Uncle Wiggily is on Tourniquet&#x27;s albums &quot;Pathogenic Ocular Dissonance&quot; (&quot;The Skeezix Dilemma&quot;) and &quot;Microscopic View of a Telescopic Realm&quot; (&quot;The Skeezix Dilemma Part II&quot;).

The book &quot;Uncle Wiggily and His Friends&quot; makes a brief appearance in the 1994 film &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;, being read by Jenny while Forrest &quot;dangles&quot;.

On the September 4, 2013 episode of &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot;, &quot;Uncle Wiggly&#x27;s Rheumatism&quot; book was featured on the &quot;Do Not Read List&quot; skit.

Uncle Wiggily appears as a reference between the two characters, Eloise and Walt, in &quot;Uncle Wiggily in Connecticut&quot; - one of the nine short stories in J.D. Salinger&#x27;s collection of short stories, &#x27;Nine Stories&#x27;. Specifically, the story&#x27;s title refers to an event recalled by Eloise in which she and Walt were running to catch a bus and she sprains her ankle. Walt then says, referring to her ankle in good humor, &quot;Poor Uncle Wiggily...&quot;.

Likewise, in the movie &quot;My Foolish Heart&quot;, based on &quot;Uncle Wiggily in Connecticut&quot;, the two characters bond over childhood memories of Uncle Wiggily when Eloise (Susan Hayward) cuts her finger while washing Walt&#x27;s (Dana Andrews) dishes. Walt, caring for her injured finger, says &quot;Poor Uncle Wiggily...&quot;, referencing the rabbit&#x27;s ears and then her ears, which ultimately leads to their first kiss.

In 1987, Uncle Wiggily was referred to in a &quot;rock music fable&quot; called &quot;Little Boy Goes to Hell&quot;, a four-record set by Mark Nichols, released on PopLlama Records. The song is titled &quot;Your Deepest Fear&quot;.

<text>The Great Seal of the [[State of North Dakota]] is the official seal of the U.S. state of North Dakota. 

==Description==
The seal is based on the description of the seal of the Territory of Dakota, enacted in 1862-3:

The current description is found in Article XI, Section 2 of the Constitution of North Dakota.

The current seal was designed by Lili Stewart of North Dakota in 1987.

<doc id="1028100" wikidata="Q609747" url="?curid=1028100" title="Sit-up">
<text>The sit-up is an abdominal endurance training exercise to strengthen, tighten and tone the abdominal muscles. It is similar to a curl-up (that targets the rectus abdominis and also works the external and internal obliques), but sit-ups have a fuller range of motion and condition additional muscles.

==Form==
Sit-ups begin with the practicing individual lying with their back on the floor. Typically, this is done with the arms across the chest or hands behind the head. The knees and toes are bent to reduce stress on the back muscles and spine. Both the upper and lower vertebrae are elevated from the floor until everything superior to the buttocks is not touching the ground. Some argue that sit-ups can be dangerous due to high compressive lumbar load and may be replaced with the crunch in exercise programs. Performing alternative abdominal exercises to sit-ups actually increases the ability to do sit-ups.

Performing sit-ups do not cause the spot reduction of fat at the waist. 
Gaining a &quot;six pack&quot; requires both abdominal muscle hypertrophy training and fat loss over the abdomen—which can only be done by losing fat from the body as a whole.

===Variations===
The movement can be made easier by placing the arms further down away from the head. Typical variations to this include crossing the arms to place the palms on the front of the shoulders and extending the arms down to the sides with palms on the floor. The &#x27;arms on shoulders&#x27; variation is also used to make the incline sit-up easier.

More intense movement is achieved by doing weighted sit-ups, incline sit-ups with arms behind neck and even harder by doing the weighted incline sit-up.

==Health risks==
With improper form, full sit-ups have been found to cause back pain and arching of the lower back, increasing the risk of back injury.

In 2015, it was revealed that every branch of the U.S. armed forces have begun to phase out sit-ups and crunches, due to the high rates of lower-back injury. They have been replaced by planks.

<doc id="1028101" wikidata="Q994845" url="?curid=1028101" title="Asiatic Exclusion League">
<text>The Asiatic Exclusion League (often abbreviated AEL) was an organization formed in the early 20th century in the United States and Canada that aimed to prevent immigration of people of Asian origin.

==United States==
In May 1905, a mass meeting was held in San Francisco, California to launch the Japanese and Korean Exclusion League. Among those attending the first meeting were labor leaders and European immigrants, Patrick Henry McCarthy of the Building Trades Council of San Francisco, Andrew Furuseth, and Walter Macarthur of the International Seamen&#x27;s Union.

Following the first meeting, the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; published a picture of laborers who collected at the meeting saying: &quot;Some present owned their own little homes; while a majority know what it is to sit with the good wife of an evening, figure on approaching rent day and make up the cash on hand to see if there is enough to carry the family over to the next day.&quot; The &quot;Chronicle&quot; also mentioned of resilience coming from the men attending the meeting, angrily ranting against the foreign men who were preventing them from owning homes and achieving a middle class life.

In December 1907, the organization was renamed the Asiatic Exclusion League to include the exclusion of Indian and Chinese immigrants in their agenda. Advocating for the &quot;white man&#x27;s country&quot; and the prohibition of Asian labor immigration, the AEL set up branches across the Pacific coast of North America, achieving transnational status and cross-border labor organization.
Once the league was started they immediately began working to prevent any increase of Asians along the Western coastlines. The league used strong-arm methods and violence against Asians to try to ensure the rigorous enforcement of the Chinese Exclusion Act and expand its provisions to other Asian immigrants. They moved quickly to broaden their goals and aimed to prevent immigration of all people of East Asian origin. Their collective aims were to spread false anti-Asian information and to sway legislation towards restricting immigration. In response to their efforts General Ulysses S. Webb, Attorney General for the state of California began to apply a markedly greater effort into enforcing laws that prohibited Asian ownership of property.

===Education===
AEL framed a campaign geared towards the San Francisco Board of Education to exclude Japanese and Koreans from public schools. The San Francisco school board ruled in October 1906, that all Japanese and Korean students would be forced to join their Chinese counterparts at the segregated Oriental School which was established some two decades earlier in 1884. Many Japanese Americans challenged the school board&#x27;s ruling by stating that the segregation of schools went against the Treaty of 1894. The Treaty did not address education; however, it did guarantee that equal rights be given to Japanese Americans. As part of the Japanese Americans&#x27; challenge, they secured the right to attend San Francisco public schools, but as part of the Gentlemen&#x27;s Agreement of 1907, the Japanese government agreed to stop issuing passports to Japanese laborers.

===Government===
Applying active pressure on Congress, in March 1907, Congress approved amending existing immigration legislation, thereby allowing President Theodore Roosevelt to issue Executive Order that ended migration by Japanese or Korean laborers from Mexico, Canada, and Hawaii to the continental United States. This was taken together with the Gentlemen&#x27;s Agreement (1907–1908) with Japan, in which the Japanese government agreed not to issue passports for those laborers seeking work in the United States. This ended the immigration of much-maligned Japanese laborers.

The league enhanced its activities by recruiting members, pledging political candidates to an exclusion law and by attempting to organize all of the western states in a concerted movement that would force Congress to grant their aspirations. For the forces against congress the AEL created a platform of five planks to bring forth to Congress:

&quot;(1) Extending Chinese Exclusion Laws to exclude Japanese and Koreans, except those exempt by the terms of the Chinese Exclusion Act, from the United States and its territories; (2) the members are to pledge not to employ or patronize Japanese or to patronize any person or form employing Japanese or dealing with products coming from such firms; (3) actions of the School Board to adopt a policy segregating Japanese from white children be approved; (4) a campaign calling the attention of the President and Congress to this &quot;menace&quot;, be taken over; (5) all labor and civic organizations in the state California are asked to contribute a fixed assessment to the cause.&quot;

On May 19, 1913 Governor Hiram Johnson signed the Webb–Haney Act, commonly recognized as Alien Land Law of 1913. These laws limited land leases by &quot;aliens ineligible to citizenship.&quot; Consecutive amendments followed Webb-Hartley, passed in 1919 and again in 1920, only further restricted the leasing of land. The latter amendment, represented the most demanding measures this far and was praised to close one and for all any and all loopholes that allowed for Asians to gain ownership. It passed overwhelmingly as a ballot initiative and went into effect on December 9, 1920.

==Canada==

A sister organization with the same name was formed in Vancouver, British Columbia, on 12 August 1907 under the auspices of the Trades and Labour Council. Its stated aim was &quot;to keep Oriental immigrants out of British Columbia.&quot;

On 7 September, riots erupted in Vancouver when League members besieged Chinatown after listening to inflammatory racist speeches at City Hall (then on Main Street near Georgia Street). 4,000 people shouting racist slogans, by the time the riot reached City Hall, it had reached 8,000 people. The crowd marched into Chinatown, vandalizing and causing thousands of dollars&#x27; worth of damage. The mob then rampaged through Japantown, where they were confronted by residents armed with clubs and bottles with which they fought back. The organization flourished immediately following the riots, but began to dwindle by the following year. The AEL resurfaced in the early 1920s, this time claiming a membership of 40,000 in the province in the period leading up to the passage of the &quot;Chinese Immigration Act&quot; of 1923, which ended virtually all Chinese immigration to Canada.

In August 1921, there was a meeting held by the AEL bringing together church leaders, businessmen and veterans from World War I as well as representatives from six trade unions and the Vancouver Trades and Labour Council. During this meeting the League issued a program that called for the abolition of all Oriental immigration which later led to a campaign resulting in the &quot;Oriental Exclusion Act of 1923&quot;.

Another important, albeit indirect, consequence of AEL activity was that the 1907 Vancouver riots led to the first drug law in Canada. The Minister of Labour (and future Prime Minister), William Lyon Mackenzie King, was sent to investigate the riots as well as victim claims for compensation. One claim was submitted by opium manufacturers, which sparked an investigation into the local drug scene by King. Particularly alarming to the minister was that opium consumption was apparently spreading to young white women. A federal law was soon passed &quot;prohibiting the manufacture, sale and importation of opium for other than medicinal purposes.&quot;

Both Asiatic Exclusion Leagues were the product of an overall atmosphere of white racism against Asians that prevailed in Canada and the United States from the 1800s on, culminating in the imposition of a head tax and other immigration policies designed to exclude Asians from Canada, as well as Japanese American internment and Japanese Canadian internment during World War II.

==Further references==
In 1908, the Asiatic Exclusion League reprinted the 1901 pamphlet &quot;Some reasons for Chinese exclusion. Meat vs. Rice. American Manhood against Asiatic Coolieism. Which shall survive?&quot; published by the American Federation of Labor, adding an introduction and appendices.

<text>Banana Fish (stylized in all caps) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Akimi Yoshida. It was originally serialized from May 1985 to April 1994 in &quot;Bessatsu Shōjo Comic&quot;, a manga magazine publishing manga (girls&#x27; manga). Set primarily in New York City in the 1980s, the series follows street gang leader Ash Lynx as he uncovers a criminal conspiracy involving &quot;banana fish&quot;, a mysterious drug that brainwashes its users. In the course of his investigation he encounters Eiji Okumura, a Japanese photographer&#x27;s assistant with whom he forms a close bond.

The visual and narrative style of &quot;Banana Fish&quot;, characterized by realist artwork and action-oriented storytelling, represented a significant break from then-established manga conventions of highly stylized illustration and romantic fantasy-focused stories. While the series was aimed at the audience of adolescent girls and young adult women, its mature themes and subject material attracted a substantial crossover audience of men and adult women. Its depictions of homoeroticism in this mature, action-oriented context were particularly influential on the boys&#x27; love (male-male romance) genre of manga. &quot;Banana Fish&quot; was acclaimed by critics, who offered praise for the series&#x27; plot, dialogue, and action scenes. It is Yoshida&#x27;s most commercially successful work, with over 12 million copies of collected volumes of the series in circulation as of 2018.

An English-language translation of the series was published by Viz Media, which also serialized &quot;Banana Fish&quot; in its manga magazines &quot;Pulp&quot; and &quot;Animerica Extra&quot; beginning in 1997, making &quot;Banana Fish&quot; one of the earliest manga series to reach a wide audience in the United States. The series has been adapted several times, notably in 2018 as a 24-episode anime television series directed by Hiroko Utsumi and produced by MAPPA. The anime adaptation aired on Fuji TV&#x27;s Noitamina programming block and is syndicated globally on Amazon Prime Video, which simulcast the series during its original broadcast run.

==Plot==


&quot;Banana Fish&quot; is set in the United States during the mid-1980s, primarily in New York City. Seventeen-year-old street gang leader Ash Lynx cares for his older brother Griffin, a Vietnam War veteran left in a vegetative state following a traumatic combat incident in which he fired on his own squadron and uttered the words &quot;banana fish&quot;. One night, Ash witnesses two of his gang members kill a man who instructs Ash to &quot;seek banana fish&quot; before dying. The two gang members tell Ash they were acting on orders from Dino Golzine, the head of the Corsican mafia in New York; Ash was formerly an enforcer and child sex slave to Golzine, having been groomed from a young age to become the eventual heir to his criminal enterprise.

Ash begins to investigate &quot;banana fish&quot; but is impeded in this endeavor by Golzine, leading him to turn on his former patron. Ash encounters multiple allies and enemies in the course of his dual efforts to uncover the meaning of &quot;banana fish&quot; and dismantle Golzine&#x27;s criminal empire: chief among his confidants is Eiji Okumura, a Japanese photographer&#x27;s assistant who has travelled to New York to complete a report on street gangs, and with whom Ash forms a close bond. It gradually transpires that &quot;banana fish&quot; is a drug developed by an American military doctor during the Vietnam War that brainwashes its users; early versions of the drug were tested on American soldiers, including Griffin, which drove them to insanity. Its perfected formula has been acquired by Golzine, who intends to sell the drug to factions within the United States government, who in turn seek to use it to overthrow communist governments in South America.

Ultimately, Golzine is killed in a climactic battle, his government co-conspirators are exposed as participants in his child sex trafficking ring, and all evidence of the banana fish project is destroyed. Ash comes to recognize the danger he exposes Eiji to, and reluctantly ceases all contact with him. Eiji returns to Japan, though prior to his departure, he writes Ash a letter in which he tells him that &quot;my soul is always with you.&quot; While distracted by the letter, Ash is fatally stabbed by a rival gang lieutenant. He staggers into the New York Public Library Main Branch where he dies, smiling and clutching Eiji&#x27;s letter.

==Production==
===Context===
manga (Japanese girls&#x27; comics) entered a period of significant creative development beginning in the 1970s, characterized by the emergence of new narrative and visual styles, and the ascendance of female manga artists into what had formerly been a category dominated by male creators. Manga such as &quot;The Rose of Versailles&quot; (1972–1973) by Riyoko Ikeda established non-Japanese settings and androgynous characters as a common motif for manga, while works by Moto Hagio, Keiko Takemiya, and other artists associated with the Year 24 Group originated (male-male romance) as a distinct subgenre of manga. Early Year 24 Group typically depicted romanticized European or historic Japanese settings, though works that depicted homosexuality by artists unassociated with the group such as &quot;Fire!&quot; (1969–1971) by Hideko Mizuno depicted unidealized American settings, and frequently included one or more Japanese characters that served as a point of reference and identification for Japanese readers.

&quot;Banana Fish&quot; creator Akimi Yoshida made her debut as a manga artist in 1977, having originally been inspired to pursue a career in manga after watching a revival screening of the 1969 film &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot; while in high school. The film, which depicts the relationship between a con man and a male hustler in New York City, had a profound impact on Yoshida, and influenced her to create works that replicated its themes of close spiritual and fraternal bonds between men. Yoshida would first explore these themes in her debut serial manga series &quot;California Story&quot; (1978–1981), which depicts themes of homoeroticism in a New York City setting, and which manga scholar Yukari Fujimoto regards as a narrative and thematic precursor to &quot;Banana Fish&quot;.

===Development===
Yoshida did not have a fixed composition for the plot of &quot;Banana Fish&quot; from its outset; while she had a general idea of the series&#x27; story, the particulars of plot and characters were developed throughout its serialization. Owing to the influence of &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot;, Yoshida sought to create &quot;Banana Fish&quot; as story focused on an emotionally intense relationship between two characters, who became Ash and Eiji. Originally, Ash was conceived as an upbeat character inspired by manga protagonists, as Yoshida sought to contrast the moody protagonists typical of her other works, while Eiji was originally conceived as a female character. In the latter case, Eiji was made male due the character&#x27;s largely passive role in the story, and Yoshida&#x27;s personal dislike of inert female deuteragonists in manga who exist solely as a source of conflict or romance for the male protagonist.

Yoshida&#x27;s style as a manga artist – as exemplified by &quot;Banana Fish&quot; – deviated significantly from typical manga of its era in terms of narrative, character, setting, mood, and visual style. Writer and translator Frederik L. Schodt notes that while Yoshida&#x27;s works adhere to certain conventions of manga as textual and subtextual homoeroticism, she at the same time adopts &quot;a completely masculine art style, eschewing flowers and bug eyes in favor of tight bold strokes, action scenes, and speed lines&quot;. She forgoed many of the conventions made popular by the Year 24 Group – highly stylized character designs, a focus on romance and fantasy, grandiloquent writing – in favor of artwork that was stripped-down and realistic, panels that focused on characters and actions over backgrounds and environments, and frequent action sequences. Her characters are drawn as realistically proportioned, contrasting both the &quot;willowy bodies&quot; typical of men in manga and the &quot;hyperdefined anatomy&quot; typical of men in manga (boys&#x27; manga). In contrast to the European settings popular in manga of the 1970s, Yoshida expressed a general disinterest in European culture and &quot;English types&quot;, preferring instead the &quot;carefree attitude&quot; of working-class American men.

The physical appearance of many of the characters in &quot;Banana Fish&quot; is based on real-life public figures: Ash&#x27;s appearance is based on tennis player Stefan Edberg in the earliest chapters of the series before shifting to a design based on actor River Phoenix, while Eiji is based on actor Hironobu Nomura. Yoshida likened this process of selecting real-life figures to depict as characters to casting a &quot;B-grade action movie&quot;. The author developed an interest in River Phoenix after watching his 1986 film &quot;The Mosquito Coast&quot; while visiting the United States; she was unaware Phoenix also appeared in the 1986 film &quot;Stand By Me&quot;, which she had previously seen, and became intrigued by Phoenix&#x27;s range as an actor given the differences between the two characters. Yoshida notes how as Ash&#x27;s design shifted from the Edberg to the Phoenix design his physicality shifts as well, from &quot;athletic and solidly-built&quot; to a &quot;slender pretty boy&quot;.

Despite her lack of fixed composition for the story, Yoshida intended from the earliest stages of the series&#x27; development to have &quot;Banana Fish&quot; conclude with Ash&#x27;s death. She briefly reconsidered this approach following Phoenix&#x27;s death in 1993 at the age of 23, as she did not wish the series to be perceived as making light of a real-life tragedy. In discussing her rationale for Ash&#x27;s death, Yoshida has indicated her fascination with people who live intensely and die young, describing Ash as a person who &quot;lived his full life in 17 years&quot;; further, Yoshida believed that as Ash had committed acts of violence and murder throughout the series, he needed to pay for these actions with his own life. The seeming ignominy of Ash&#x27;s death at the hands of a low-level gang member was intentional on Yoshida&#x27;s part; a protagonist who seems to die meaninglessly recurs as a motif in manga (such as &quot;Ashita no Joe&quot;), &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot;, and Yoshida&#x27;s own &quot;California Story&quot;.

The concept of the mind-controlling banana fish drug originated from Yoshida&#x27;s interest in Central Intelligence Agency research into mind control, such as MKUltra and Project ARTICHOKE, and her research into similar programs in the Soviet Union leading her to consider drugs as a tool for warfare. Yoshida has had an intellectual interest in drugs since high school, noting that her generation was influenced by and developed knowledge of drugs in a broad sense due to the influence of the drug culture of the era. The author has stated that depicting Cold War-era politics became more difficult as political realities changed over the course of &quot;Banana Fish&quot;″s nearly decade-long run – principally the dissolution of the Soviet Union mid-serialization – but that she ultimately did not strive for strict realism in her depiction of politics and current events.

===Release===
&quot;Banana Fish&quot; began serialization in the May 1985 issue of the manga magazine &quot;Bessatsu Shōjo Comic&quot;, a monthly supplement to the manga magazine &quot;Shōjo Comic&quot;, where it ran until its conclusion in the April 1994 issue. The total length of the series is roughly 3,400 pages. &quot;Bessatsu Shōjo Comic&quot; publisher Shogakukan also published &quot;Banana Fish&quot; as nineteen collected volumes under its Flower Comics imprint.

The series was released amid the so-called &quot;manga boom&quot; of the mid-1980s and 1990s, which saw the popularity of manga increase amid the emergence of new creators, series, genres, and magazines, as well as an increase in the popularity of manga in international markets. North American publisher Viz Media serialized an English-language translation of &quot;Banana Fish&quot; as a launch title for its manga magazine &quot;Pulp&quot; beginning in 1998. When &quot;Pulp&quot; folded in 2002, serialization of &quot;Banana Fish&quot; continued in &quot;Animerica Extra&quot;, which itself folded in 2004. Viz also published two editions of collected volumes of &quot;Banana Fish&quot;. The first, published from 1999 to 2002 and spanning the first seven volumes, features flipped artwork and censors some expletives. The second, published from 2004 to 2007 and spanning the full 19 volumes, is printed in the original right-to-left format and includes a re-translated script. The series was reprinted by Viz in 2018, shortly after the release of the anime adaptation of &quot;Banana Fish&quot;.

===Side stories===
In addition to the main manga series, Yoshida wrote and illustrated four one-shot (single-chapter manga) side stories:

* &quot;Fly Boy, In The Sky&quot;, a prequel to &quot;Banana Fish&quot;, originally published in the Winter 1984 issue of the manga magazine &quot;Bessatsu LaLa&quot;. The manga focuses on Ibe and Eiji&#x27;s first meeting, and the events that lead to Ibe taking on Eiji as his assistant.
* &quot;Angel Eyes&quot;, a prequel published in June 1994 issue of &quot;Bessatsu Shōjo Comic&quot;. It focuses on Ash and Shorter Wong&#x27;s first meeting while in juvenile prison together.
* , a postscript set seven years after the events &quot;Banana Fish&quot;, originally published in the August 1994 issue of &quot;Bessatsu Shōjo Comic&quot;. The story follows Akira Ibe, the niece of Shunichi Ibe, as she visits New York City and stays with Eiji, now an accomplished photographer living in Greenwich Village.
* &quot;Private Opinion&quot;, a side story published in the January 1995 issue of &quot;Bessatsu Shōjo Comic&quot;. The manga tells the story of Ash and Blanca&#x27;s first meeting after Golzine hires Blanca to train Ash in combat.

All four stories were encapsulated in &quot;Banana Fish: Another Story&quot;, a collected edition published by Shogakukan in 1997. The collection also includes , a comedic fourth wall-breaking story where Ash and Eiji discuss fan mail the series has received with Yoshida.

===Anime===

&quot;Banana Fish&quot; was adapted into a 24-episode anime series produced by MAPPA and directed by Hiroko Utsumi, which aired on Fuji TV&#x27;s Noitamina programming block and Amazon Prime Video from July 5 to December 20, 2018. The series was produced as a part of a commemoration project to mark the 40th anniversary of Yoshida&#x27;s debut as a manga artist. The adaptation revises the setting of the series from the 1980s to the 2010s, adding modern references such as smartphones and substituting the Vietnam War with the Iraq War.

===Other adaptations &amp; tie-ins===
A radio drama adaptation of &quot;Banana Fish&quot; was produced by NHK in 1994, with a cast that featured Tohru Furusawa as the voice of Ash and Kazuhiko Inoue as the voice of Eiji. The adaptation was later released on CD, and was re-broadcast in 2018. Two novelizations of &quot;Banana Fish&quot; have been published. The first, a four-volume series written by Akira Endō, was published by KSS Comic Novels in 1998. Titled , the series tells the story of the manga from Max&#x27;s perspective. The second, a three-volume series written by Miku Ogasawara based on the &quot;Banana Fish&quot; anime, was published by Shogakukan Bunko in 2018. Stage play adaptations of &quot;Banana Fish&quot; have been produced in 2005, 2009, 2012, and 2021. According to Yoshida, film rights for a live-action film adaptation of &quot;Banana Fish&quot; were at one point granted to Ryuichi Sakamoto, but no film was ever produced.

Shogakukan, which published the &quot;Banana Fish&quot; manga, has published several art books related to the series, including the art book &quot;Angel Eyes&quot; in 1994 and the companion book &quot;Rebirth: The Banana Fish Official Guidebook&quot; in 2001. The company also published &quot;New York Sense&quot; in 2001, an art book credited to &quot;Eiji Okumura&quot; and marketed as a book of photographs taken by the character.

==Themes and analysis==
===Homosexuality===
&quot;Banana Fish&quot; depicts homosexuality both in the text of the story through representations of male-male rape, and as subtext through the ambiguously homoerotic relationship between Ash and Eiji. Male homosexuality is a recurring motif in manga; while works created in the 1970s by artists associated with the Year 24 Group formalized manga featuring male homosexuality as a distinct subgenre known as , homoerotic themes and subjects had long been a feature of manga. &quot;Banana Fish&quot; would come to represent a shift for depictions of homosexuality in manga, towards older protagonists and realist writing and artwork, and away from the schoolboy romances and melodramas that had previously defined the genre. Some manga scholars such as Yukari Fujimoto consider &quot;Banana Fish&quot; as belonging to a continuous artistic canon that includes works by the Year 24 Group, while others such as James Welker argue that &quot;Banana Fish&quot; is narratively and stylistically closer to the boys&#x27; love genre of male-male romance manga that emerged in the 1990s.

Despite &quot;Banana Fish&quot;″s influence and prominence as a manga depicting homosexuality, the central relationship between Ash and Eiji is never rendered as overtly romantic or sexual. Critic Ted Anderson argues that a romantic dimension to Ash and Eiji&#x27;s bond can be readily inferred from the subtext of the story, writing that &quot;the astute reader understands the unspoken elements of Ash and Eiji&#x27;s relationship&quot;. Manga critic Jason Thompson similarly describes the series as a &quot;love story&quot; expressed &quot;so subtly as to be invisible&quot;, noting how &quot;the sensuality in this manga is in Ash teaching Eiji how to shoot a gun, or Ash and Eiji&#x27;s friendly, teasing, couple-like dialogue.&quot; Manga scholar Christina Parte argues that the non-physical nature of Ash and Eiji&#x27;s relationship mirrors typical manga romances, which commonly focus on a chaste relationship between a man and woman that is never physically consummated; Eiji&#x27;s sexual and romantic inexperience is similarly typical of a manga protagonist. Thompson considers several potential explanations for the largely subtextual nature of Ash and Eiji&#x27;s relationship, including Yoshida&#x27;s stated desire to focus on the emotional connection between the characters, that Yoshida did not wish to risk eroticizing the manga&#x27;s themes of rape by depicting a romantic or sexual relationship, and the potential influence of manga censorship codes in limiting displays of same-sex romance and sex.

===Gender===
While the cast of &quot;Banana Fish&quot; is almost entirely male, several characters – notably Ash and Eiji – are (literally &quot;beautiful boys&quot;), a term for visually androgynous male characters who blend masculine and feminine qualities. Scholars have considered how are regarded as desirable by a female audience not merely for their physical attractiveness, but because they allow this audience to vicariously experience romance, agency, and personal autonomy through a character that is unconstrained by patriarchy. While romance between is tolerated in some contexts in Japan and is thus not necessarily transgressive or subversive on its face, Parte argues that Ash and Eiji&#x27;s status as allows them to &quot;transgress Japanese gender norms&quot; by resisting gender roles typically associated with female Japanese adolescents.

Per Parte, Ash and Eiji express a degree of gender ambivalence by alternating between masculinized and feminized agency. Ash embodies typically masculine agency in his position as a leader of a street gang, but is frequently feminized though the rape he suffers at the hands of men. Conversely, Eiji possesses the typically feminine trait of nurturing domesticity – he soothes Ash when he is troubled, treats his wounds, and remains at home while Ash fights – but towards the end of the series, it is ultimately Eiji who takes up arms to free an emaciated Ash from Golzine&#x27;s clutches. Parte argues that despite the American setting of the series, Ash&#x27;s quest for self-determination ultimately represents a rejection of restrictive Japanese gender roles: both the &quot;good son&quot; (becoming Golzine&#x27;s heir) and the &quot;obedient wife&quot; (becoming Golzine&#x27;s sex slave). Thus, through Ash and Eiji&#x27;s struggles, the ostensibly female reader is able to &quot;escape from Japanese reality&quot; and &quot;resist the pressures of a highly hierarchical gender and sexual system&quot;.

===Occidentalism===

The release of &quot;Banana Fish&quot; in the late 1980s coincided with a period of fascination with New York City in Japanese popular culture. Schodt notes how the series reflects the Japanese perception of 1980s New York as a &quot;modern Wild West&quot; characterized by rampant crime, drug use, poverty, and racial tension that was &quot;a symbol of everything that was wrong with America&quot;, but which at the same time &quot;seemed symbolic of America&#x27;s raw energy and exciting individual freedoms&quot;. Within the New York of the story, Eiji functions as an intermediary for the Japanese reader, echoing earlier manga such as &quot;Fire!&quot; that used Japanese characters to link works in American settings to their Japanese readership. Parte argues that it is &quot;tempting to see in Eiji the personification of reverse orientalism&quot; as a Japanese character who is captivated by an American, but that his status as a representing a blending of male and female traits allows him to embody a &quot;female internationalist occidentalism&quot; wherein the female reader can vicariously experience an &quot;exotic American setting&quot; that has fewer limits on personal expression.

Beyond its American setting and characters, &quot;Banana Fish&quot; features frequent allusions to American literature: Blanca&#x27;s character arc is drawn from Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s &quot;Islands in the Stream&quot;, Ash compares his life to Hemingway&#x27;s &quot;The Snows of Kilimanjaro&quot;, and the title of the series itself is a reference to J. D. Salinger&#x27;s short story &quot;A Perfect Day for Bananafish&quot;. The &quot;bananafish&quot; of Salinger&#x27;s story are fish that eat to excess until they are unable to move, and the story ends with the sudden suicide of the protagonist. The symbolic meaning of the bananafish within &quot;A Perfect Day for Bananafish&quot; is the subject of debate, and the significance of manga&#x27;s title as an allusion to the story is similarly obscure, as there are few direct references to &quot;A Perfect Day for Bananafish&quot; within the manga. Anderson writes that &quot;there are perhaps connections to Golzine&#x27;s self-destructive greed and Ash’s seemingly suicidal tendencies, but these connections are tenuous at best.&quot; Thompson considers how &quot;both the manga and the story involve life&#x27;s cruelty, and traumatic experiences, and sudden death&quot;, while Parte considers the manga&#x27;s banana fish drug as symbolizing &quot;male greed, materialism, and destruction&quot;. Critic Hisayo Ogushi considers a less allegorical explanation, noting that the protagonist of Salinger&#x27;s story commits suicide after he envisions the bananafish, just as characters in the manga lose control of themselves after they are given the banana fish drug.

===Violence===
The action-oriented plot of &quot;Banana Fish&quot;, characterized by frequent fight scenes, multi-chapter action set pieces, and the extensive use of speed lines, represented a break from the typical visual and narrative conventions of manga. Yoshida has stated that her interest in action stems from childhood, specifically her desire to play active sports like soccer instead of typically feminine pursuits such as rhythmic dance, and that the preponderance of male characters in &quot;Banana Fish&quot; stemmed in part from her difficulty in imagining stereotypically passive girls in these active scenarios. Violence and its dehumanizing effects recur as a major theme throughout the series, as character struggle to reconcile their humanity with the violent acts they commit and endure. Ash represents the apex of this theme: a character whose traumatic past has left him resigned to a life of violence, and who faces the conflict between his desire for a &quot;normal&quot; life with Eiji, and his desire to &quot;protect Eiji from the horrors of his violent life&quot;.

Sexual violence also recurs throughout the series, with depictions of rape that Parte argues echo scenes of sexual abuse of women in erotic manga. Thompson notes how the series does not contain any explicit depictions sex or nudity, and how rape is depicted &quot;entirely as trauma and never as titillation&quot;, contrasting eroticized depictions of rape in BL manga.

==Reception and legacy==
By 2018, over 12 million copies of collected volumes of &quot;Banana Fish&quot; are in print. A 1998 reader&#x27;s poll in the Japanese magazine &quot;Comic Link&quot; ranked &quot;Banana Fish&quot; as the greatest manga of all time. In TV Asahi&#x27;s 2021 Manga Sōsenkyo, a ranking of the top 100 manga series calculated from a public vote of 150,000 people, &quot;Banana Fish&quot; ranked 26th.

While Yoshida had published several manga titles prior to &quot;Banana Fish&quot;, the series became her most critically and commercially successful work, and &quot;cemented her status as a great creator&quot;. Though &quot;Banana Fish&quot; was published and marketed as a manga, its dense plot, heavy dialogue, and extensive action sequences led it to attract a significant crossover audience of male and adult female readers; Schodt identifies the series as &quot;one of the few girls&#x27; manga a red-blooded Japanese male adult could admit to reading without blushing&quot;. The series was similarly praised &quot;as an example of mature, plot-driven comics&quot; when it was released in English, and became one of the earliest manga series to reach a wide audience in the United States. &quot;Banana Fish&quot; was particularly influential on the boys&#x27; love genre, inspiring a wave of action-centered boys&#x27; love manga which focused on older protagonists and realist artwork, including &quot;Fake&quot;, &quot;Yellow&quot;, and &quot;Togainu no Chi&quot;.

The series has been praised by critics, with Jason Thompson calling it &quot;one of the great manga epics&quot; and praising its &quot;consciously literary&quot; writing. Its artwork has received a mixed reception among critics: Frederik L. Schodt favorably compares Yoshida&#x27;s artwork to the &quot;clean-line realism&quot; of artist Katsuhiro Otomo; Thompson, conversely, calls Yoshida&#x27;s &quot;dull artwork&quot; the &quot;one weakness&quot; of the series, but nevertheless concludes that the &quot;worldview of &quot;Banana Fish&quot; is so fully realised that the art is almost redundant, and even when the panels are nothing but talking heads, we hang on every word&quot;. &quot;Banana Fish&quot; is the favorite manga of Japanese musician Gackt – the artist claims to have read the series over one hundred times – and inspired the song &quot;Asrun Dream&quot; on his debut album &quot;Mars&quot;.

The New York Public Library Main Branch, a prominently featured location in the series, has become a tourist attraction for fans of &quot;Banana Fish&quot;; the New York Public Library reported a significant increase in gift shop revenue in the 2019 fiscal year, which they attributed to popularity generated by &quot;Banana Fish&quot;. Japanese tourism company Kinki Nippon Tourist Kanto offered a New York City tour featuring stops at locations featured in the series and a guided audio tour narrated by Yuma Uchida and Kenji Nojima, who respectively voice Ash and Eiji in the anime adaptation of &quot;Banana Fish&quot;, performing in-character. In 2019, the tour was selected by the Japan Travel Industry Association to receive the Minister of Land, Infrastructure, Transport, and Tourism Award at the annual Tour Grand Prix, which honors tourism plans that benefit Japan&#x27;s travel industry.

<text>Appointment to the position of Crown Steward and Bailiff of the Chiltern Hundreds (or the Three Hundreds of Chiltern) is a procedural device to allow members of Parliament (MPs) to resign from the House of Commons of the United Kingdom. Since MPs are technically unable to resign their seats in the House of Commons, they must resort to a legal fiction. An appointment to an &quot;office of profit under The Crown&quot; disqualifies an individual from sitting as an MP. Although several offices were used in the past to allow MPs to resign, only the stewardships of the Chiltern Hundreds and the Manor of Northstead are in present use.

== Resignation ==

On 2 March 1624, a resolution was passed by the House of Commons making it illegal for an MP to quit or wilfully give up their seat. Believing that officers of the Crown could not remain impartial, the House passed a resolution on 30 December 1680 stating that an MP who &quot;shall accept any Office, or Place of Profit, from the Crown, without the Leave of this House ... shall be expelled [from] this House.&quot; However, MPs were able to hold Crown Stewardships until 1740, when Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn was deemed to have vacated his Commons seat after becoming Steward of the Lordship and Manor of Bromfield and Yale. The practice of leaving the house when appointed as a minister of crown would result in a ministerial by-election until the early 20th century when this requirement was removed for most substantive offices.

The Chiltern Hundreds last needed a Crown Steward in the 18th century. When John Pitt wished to vacate his seat for Wareham in order to stand for Dorchester, the Crown Stewardship of the Chiltern Hundreds was available for this purpose. Pitt was appointed Crown Steward on 25 January 1751.

A number of other offices were subsequently used for resignation, but only the Chiltern Hundreds and the Crown Steward and Bailiff of the Manor of Northstead are still in use. Appointees to the Chiltern Hundreds are alternated with the Manor of Northstead, allowing two MPs to resign at once. When more than two MPs resign, such as the 1985 walkout of Ulster Unionist MPs, appointees are dismissed after a few hours to allow other resigning MPs to take their place. The Parliamentary Information Office has produced a list of those appointed to the office of Steward of the Chiltern Hundreds since 1850.

<doc id="1028140" wikidata="Q7689400" url="?curid=1028140" title="Tax advantage">
<text>Tax advantage refers to the economic bonus which applies to certain accounts or investments that are, by statute, tax-reduced, tax-deferred, or tax-free. Examples of tax-advantaged accounts and investments include retirement plans, education savings accounts, medical savings accounts, and government bonds. Governments establish tax advantages to encourage private individuals to contribute money when it is considered to be in the public interest.

== Benefits ==
Tax advantages provide an incentive to engage in certain investments and accounts, functioning like a government subsidy. For example, individual retirement accounts are tax-advantaged since they are tax-deferred. By encouraging investment in these accounts, there is a reduced need for the government to support citizens later in life by spending money on welfare or other government expenses. Capital gains tax rate benefits may also spur investment.

== Types of tax-advantaged accounts and investments ==

=== Retirement plans ===

The most well-known example is retirement plans, which often offer tax advantages to incentivize saving for retirement.

In countries in which the average age of the population is increasing, tax advantages may put pressure on pension schemes. For example, where benefits are funded on a pay-as-you-go basis, the benefits paid to those receiving a pension come directly from the contributions of those of working age. If the proportion of pensioners to working-age people rises, the contributions needed from working people will also rise proportionately. In the United States, the rapid onset of Baby Boomer retirement is currently causing such a problem.

However, there are international limitations regarding tax advantages realized through pensions plans. If a person with dual citizen in the United States and in the United Kingdom, they may have tax liabilities to both. If this person is living in the United Kingdom, their pension could have tax advantages in the UK, for example, but not in the US. Even though a UK pension may be exempt from UK tax, it doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that it is exempt from US taxes. In short, a US Tax payer with dual citizenship may have to pay taxes on the gains from the UK pension to the United States government, but not the United Kingdom.

In order to reduce the burden on such schemes, many governments give privately funded retirement plans a tax advantaged status in order to encourage more people to contribute to such arrangements. Governments often exclude such contributions from an employee&#x27;s taxable income, while allowing employers to receive tax deductions for contributions to plan funds. Investment earnings in pension funds are almost universally excluded from income tax while accumulating, prior to payment. Payments to retirees and their beneficiaries also sometimes receive favorable tax treatment. In return for a pension scheme&#x27;s tax advantaged status, governments typically enact restrictions to discourage access to a pension fund&#x27;s assets before retirement.

In the United States, tax-advantaged retirement accounts include 401(k) plans, 403(b) plans, individual retirement accounts, and supplemental retirement accounts. These accounts have proliferated since they were introduced in 1978. As of 2015, they accounted for half of all long-term mutual fund assets.

==== Annuities ====

Investing in annuities may allow investors to realize tax advantages that are not realized through other tax-deferred retirement accounts, such as 401k and IRAs. One of the great advantages of annuities is they allow an investor to store away large amounts of cash and defer paying taxes. There is no yearly limit to contributions for annuities. This is especially useful for those approaching retirement age that may not have saved large sums throughout previous years. The total investment compounds annually without any federal taxes. This allows each dollar in the entire investment to accrue interest, which could potentially be an advantage compared to taxable investments. Additionally, upon cashing the annuity out, the investor can decide to receive a lump-sum payment, or develop a more spread out payout plan.

=== Education savings ===

Tax-advantaged savings accounts are designed to encourage saving for education expenses. In the United States, tax-advantaged savings vehicles include Coverdell education savings accounts and 529 plans.

=== Medical savings ===

In Singapore and other countries, medical savings accounts are tax-deferred.

=== Real estate ===

In order to encourage home ownership, there are tax deductions on mortgage payments.

In the United States, real estate investments yield considerable tax advantages. One benefit is the ability to regain the cost of income producing (for example, commercial real estate) properties through depreciation. When a property is bought in the United States, the cost of the building and land are capitalized. If the building is a commercial property or a rental property, used in a business, the cost of the building is depreciated over 39 years for non-residential buildings and 27.5 years for residential buildings using the straight-line depreciation method for tax purposes. The building&#x27;s cost is written off over the lifespan of the building by annual depreciation deductions. Thus, the building owner receives these depreciation deductions as tax advantages at their income tax rate. Upon the sale of a property, depreciation recapture is the part of the gains that the depreciation deductions are responsible for during the period of ownership. The following is an example to show the idea of depreciation in a clear manner. A building owner buys a building for $20 million. After 5 years the owner has taken $1 million of depreciation deductions. Now, the building owner&#x27;s basis in the building is $19 million. If the owner decides to sell the building for $25 million, the building owner will realize a gain of $6 million ($25 million less $19 million). Oftentimes people wrongly assume that this $6 million is taxed at a capital gains rate. However, this is a common misconception. In this example, $1 million of the gain would actually be taxed at the depreciation recapture rate, and the other $5 million at the capital gains rate.

In New Zealand, real estate investors receive a tax advantage. Investors can claim the mortgage interest they pay as a tax deduction, while homeowners cannot. This tax advantage subsidizes investors.

=== Life insurance ===

In the United States life insurance policies also have tax advantages. Income can grow in a life insurance policy that is tax deferred or tax-free. Additionally, there are certain advantages within certain life insurance policies that are excluded from estate and/or inheritance taxes.

=== Investments ===

==== Government bonds ====
In the United States, many government bonds (such as state bonds or municipal bonds) may also be exempt from certain taxes.

==== Investments in partnerships ====

Additionally, investments in partnerships and Limited Liability Companies also have tax advantages. For individual owners of businesses, the LLC is taxed as a sole proprietorship. This means that the entity is not taxed, but the income earned by the entity is taxed to the owner. The LLC has important tax advantages, such as the owners profits potentially being taxed at the owners lower marginal tax bracket. Furthermore, losses can offset the sole proprietor&#x27;s non-business income. If there are multiple owners of a Limited Liability Company, there is also tax advantages associated with it. They can choose to be taxed as a partnership, but they can also decide to be taxed as a corporate-entity. Partnerships are not taxed, but corporations are. For LLCs taxed as partnerships the income is taxed to the partners. For a corporation or an LLC taxed like a corporation, the entity is subject to tax and dividends on after tax income are also taxed to the shareholders of the corporation or the members of the LLC.

=== Charitable giving ===

To encourage charitable donations from high net-worth individuals, there are tax deductions on charitable donations greater than a specified amount.

<text>The British Rail Class 421 (4CIG) electric multiple units were built at BR&#x27;s Holgate Road carriage works between 1964 and 1972. Units were built in two batches, and were initially introduced on services on the Brighton Main Line. Later units were introduced on services to Portsmouth. These units replaced older Southern Railway-designed units, such as the 5Bel &quot;Brighton Belle&quot; units, and 4Cor units. The fleet&#x27;s lifespan was 46 years.

==Design==

===Standard units===
The standard units contained only passenger accommodation, and formed the bulk of the fleet. They were unusual in that all four traction motors were mounted on one non-driving motor coach. Units consisted of two driving trailers, sandwiching the non-driving motor coach and an intermediate trailer.

Units were built in two batches. &#x27;Phase 1&#x27; units were built from 1963 to 1966 for the Brighton Line, and were numbered 7301-7336. These were followed in 1970-72 by the &#x27;Phase 2&#x27; units, built primarily for the Portsmouth line, numbered 7337-7438.

===4Big units===
The 4Big units were similar to the standard units, but contained a buffet car in place of the intermediate trailer. They were also built in two batches - &#x27;Phase 1&#x27; units were built in 1965/66, and were numbered 7031-48; &#x27;Phase 2&#x27; units were built in 1970, and were numbered 7049-7058.

The 4Big fleet were initially classified as Class 420 by British Rail under the TOPS system introduced in 1968, and then Class 422.

==Refurbishment==
Units were facelifted between 1986 and 1993.

===8Mig units===
In 1983, two temporary 8Mig units, given the TOPS classification Class 482 and numbered 2601–2602, were formed while the 4Big fleet underwent asbestos removal. They were used on the Portsmouth Direct line. Therefore, four standard &#x27;Phase 2&#x27; 4Cig units, numbers 7401–7404, were reformed with a conventional locomotive-hauled miniature buffet carriage (RMB). Each 8Mig unit was formed by marshalling the RMB coach in between two units, one of which was reduced to three carriages, with the removal of the intermediate trailer (TSO). Thus in effect each 8Mig unit was effectively formed of 4Cig + RMB + 3Cig. The formations of the units are listed below:

These units were only used during the summer of 1983, after which enough asbestos-free 4Big units were available. The two 8Mig units were disbanded and the four 4Cig unit reformed. The 4Cig units have since been renumbered several times, as shown below:

===8Dig units===
In 1992 four 8Dig units, numbered 2001-2004, were formed by semi-permanently coupling a 4Cig and a 4Big unit. The units were dedicated to to express services, which were operated as the Capital–Coast Express. The 8Dig units were formed from four &#x27;Phase 2&#x27; 4Big units plus two &#x27;Phase 1&#x27; and two &#x27;Phase 2&#x27; 4Cig units. The &#x27;Phase 1&#x27; units, numbers 1901/02 (recently renumbered from 1715/16), were fitted with Mk.6 motor bogies. One of the &#x27;Phase 2&#x27; 4Cig units, no. 1875 (ex. 7404), had previously been part of 8Mig unit 2602. The units were disbanded in 1996, after replacement by dedicated Class 319/2 units. The various 4Cig and 4Big units were reformed and gained their original numbers, except unit 1875, which was renumbered to 1802.

==Final years of operation==

Two units had remained in service until 22 May 2010, 3Cig units nos. 1497 and 1498, which were used on the Lymington Branch Line. These two units were withdrawn from service on 22 May 2010 and replaced by Class 158 Diesel Multiple Units. Towards the end of their life, with the increasing use of newer trains which were equipped with sliding or plug doors, these trains were known commonly as &quot;slam-door trains&quot;. 1497 was initially preserved at The Mid Norfolk Railway, now on the Lavender Line and 1498 preserved on the Epping Ongar Railway until sold and exported to Ireland. The latter has had an extra carriage added to restore its original 4Cig formation.

After rail privatisation in the mid-1990s the different divisions of British Rail were divided up into different franchises. The three former SR division – South-Eastern, South Central and South-Western – all operated 4Cig units, and are dealt with separately here.

===South Eastern Trains===

South Eastern Trains (SET) operated a small fleet of three &#x27;Phase 1&#x27; and 22 &#x27;Phase 2&#x27; 4Cig units. The franchise was originally operated by Connex South Eastern.

All but one of the &#x27;Phase 2&#x27; units continued to carry the obsolete Network SouthEast livery. One unit, no. 1870, was repainted into Connex South Eastern yellow and white. The three &#x27;Phase 1&#x27; units were painted in white undercoat livery, since their use was originally only supposed to be short-term. However, despite this, the units remained in traffic for seven more years, from 1997 to 2004. They were popularly known as &quot;Ghosts&quot; by rail enthusiasts.

From 2003 units started to be withdrawn, having been replaced by the second batch of the new &quot;Electrostar&quot; units. The three &#x27;Phase 1&#x27; units had gone by mid-2004. The final unit, no. 1843, lingered on for several months longer than its classmates, eventually being withdrawn in mid-November 2004. All the SET units have been scrapped.

===South Central / Southern===
The South Central Division inherited the largest fleet of 4Cig units. Originally this included all remaining &#x27;Phase 1&#x27; units (though some were later transferred to South Eastern Trains), 35 &#x27;Phase 2&#x27; units, and the four 8Dig units. The remaining few 4Big units were also used on the former Central Division.

The South Central franchise was initially won by Connex South Central, which applied its yellow and white livery to most stock. In 2000 it lost the franchise to the Go-Ahead Group, which operated the franchise as South Central. In 2004 this was changed to Southern. Four &#x27;Phase 1&#x27; units (nos. 1735/38/40, 1908) and eight &#x27;Phase 2&#x27; units (nos. 1854/56-62) received Southern&#x27;s new green livery.

In 1997 the remaining 4Big units were withdrawn. Eight were transferred to South West Trains. The remaining eleven unit were heavily rebuilt at Eastleigh Works, with compartments removed and opened out, and the buffet carriages withdrawn. The modified units were reclassified as Class 421/7 and renumbered into the 1401–1411 range. The units were also known as 3Cop units, which denoted their intended use, i.e. dedicated to East Coastway and West Coastway services out of Brighton. Two units received names – a rarity for slam-door EMU stock.
*1408 - Littlehampton Progress 2000
*1409 - Operation Perseus
In 2004 some units were augmented to four carriages with the addition of a &#x27;Phase 1&#x27; intermediate trailer, and thus became 4Cop units.

From 2003 Southern started to replace its slam-door fleet with new Class 377 Electrostar units. In general the &#x27;Phase 1&#x27; units were withdrawn first due to their age, but as deliveries of the Electrostars increased some &#x27;Phase 2&#x27; units were also taken out of service. By late 2004 only a handful of &#x27;Phase 1&#x27; units and 4Cops remained in service. The final &#x27;Phase 1&#x27; units in traffic were nos. 1704/08/11/12/14/17/43 and 1901, with the final unit, no. 1704, being withdrawn in February 2005. The final 4Cop units, nos. 1404/10/11, were withdrawn in March 2005.

The &#x27;Phase 2&#x27; units lasted longer and two, nos. 1805 and 1866, were retained beyond August 2005, when slam-door trains lost all diagrammed work. They lasted until 19 November 2005, when they worked a farewell railtour, following which they were withdrawn.

===South West Trains===

South West Trains inherited a small fleet of twelve &#x27;Phase 2&#x27; 4Cig units, and the larger fleet of 22 &quot;Greyhound&quot; units which had been modified to cut several minutes from journey times on the Portsmouth Direct line with its 1 in 80 gradients by adding a second stage of field weakening to improve performance at higher speeds (17% at 54 mph, 30% at 90 mph).

In 1997 the fleet was augmented with the addition of eight 4Big units from Connex South Central. These operated with the counter in the buffet carriages locked out of use. By 1999 these units had been stored, but then eight additional &quot;Greyhound&quot; units were converted from the redundant 4Bigs. The units were reclassified as Class 421/8, and renumbered in the range 1392–1399. The modifications included the removal of the buffet carriages, which were replaced by spare intermediate trailers from mechanically similar 4Cep units. Most of these trailers came from 4Cep units to make 3Cep units, but a few came from withdrawn units. These trailers were immediately recognisable since although they had the same body profile as the rest of the unit the windows were different and they had InterCity70 seating. The buffet carriages were withdrawn, although many were saved for preservation.

In December 2004 unit no. 1394 was reduced to a three-car unit with the removal of its Cep trailer. It was reclassified as Class 421/7, renumbered 1499, and dedicated to the Lymington Branch Line service, where it replaced the previous incumbent unit, no. 1198.

Withdrawals of units started in mid-2004, when many new Class 444 and Class 450 &quot;Desiro&quot; units became available for service. By the end of 2004 just a handful of units remained in traffic. The final few units were withdrawn in May 2005, with the last in traffic being 1304/09/12/16, 1392/95/96/97/98, 1499 and 1881/90. The final slam-door service ran on 26 May from London Waterloo to Bournemouth using units 1396, 1398 and 4Vep 3536. Following withdrawal two units, nos. 1304 and 1881, were transferred to &quot;warm storage&quot; for use by Southern if required. Most of the other units were sent for scrap, with the exception of nos. 1392 and 1499.

Services on the Lymington Branch Line were operated as a &quot;heritage&quot; operation using one of two refurbished 3Cig units, nos. 1497 and 1498. The two units were launched into service on 12 May 2005 having been repainted into heritage liveries, 1497 in blue and grey and 1498 in the green that the units carried when built. However, in May 2010, the new timetable changes saw the units replaced for more modern stock to save maintenance on a non-standard fleet of two units. As stated in the relevant timetable, &quot;The slam door trains will be remembered with affection as they pass into history.&quot; The change took place on 22 May 2010 and the units have been replaced by a Class 158 on weekdays and a Class 450 Desiro at weekends. The class 421s have both been preserved due to historic significance. 

==Accidents and incidents==

*On 15 December 1971, a Cardiff to Portsmouth Harbour train hauled by Hymek diesel no. D7013 collided with unit 7303 on the high level section of Portsmouth and Southsea station, Hampshire. Sixteen passengers and railway staff were injured
*In summer 1974 (date unknown) unit 7346 ran away at Wimbledon Park and hit a flyover causing extensive damage to the cab of vehicle 76620.
*On 26 January 1985, unit 7395 formed a train with 4VEP units 7754 and 7703 which was halted by a landslip near Popham, Hampshire and was run into by Class 33 locomotive 33 104 due to the train crew failing to protect the stranded train. Twelve people were injured and the Class 33 was written off.
*On 6 November 1985, unit 7390 collided with 4VEP unit 7724 at Copyhold Junction, near , West Sussex due to poor rail conditions and a loss of braking. Forty people were injured.
*On 4 March 1989, unit Nos. 1280 and 1295 formed a passenger train that overran a signal and collided with another passenger train formed of 4VEP unit 3441 at , Surrey. Five people were killed, 8 were injured.
*On 6 April 1989, unit 1822 was derailed at whilst working a to service. There were no injuries.

*On 29 August 1990, unit 1221 was derailed at Ash Vale Junction whilst operating a to service.

==Withdrawal==
===Departmental service===

Following withdrawal from normal service several vehicles have seen further use in departmental service.
*3Cop unit 1401 was employed as depot shunter at Ashford Chart Leacon depot. However, it was made redundant when Chart Leacon stopped overhauls of slam-door stock and was sent for scrap in July 2005.
*MBS 62356 (ex-unit 1850) was converted into an ultrasonic test train vehicle for use by Network Rail. It has been renumbered 999606. 
*The rest of unit 1850, namely DTC 76629, TS 71036 and DTC 76789, were retained by Network Rail to provide spares for 999606 but have now been scrapped by C.F. Booth in Rotherham.
*One vehicle, no. 76112 from &#x27;Phase 1&#x27; 4Cig unit 1749, was rebuilt as the Class 424 &quot;Networker Classic&quot; prototype in 1997. It was displayed to the public at London Victoria, paired with unrebuilt driving trailer 76747 from 4Big unit 2256, for comparison purposes. The project was shelved and the vehicle was scrapped in early 2012.
* DTCSoL vehicles 76765 and 76836 (from 1882) plus 76775 and 76846 (from 1890) were released recently by HSBC from Shoeburyness for parts stripping at Derby RTC, after which they went to C.F. Booth.

<text>Edward Marczewski (15 November 1907 – 17 October 1976) was a Polish mathematician. He was born Szpilrajn but changed his name while hiding from Nazi persecution.

Marczewski was a member of the Warsaw School of Mathematics. His life and work after the Second World War were connected with Wrocław, where he was among the creators of the Polish scientific centre. He worked at the State Institute of Mathematics, which was incorporated into the Polish Academy of Sciences in 1952.

Marczewski&#x27;s main fields of interest were measure theory, descriptive set theory, general topology, probability theory and universal algebra. He also published papers on real and complex analysis, applied mathematics and mathematical logic.

Marczewski proved that the topological dimension, for arbitrary metrisable separable space &quot;X&quot;, coincides with the Hausdorff dimension under one of the metrics in &quot;X&quot; which induce the given topology of &quot;X&quot; (while otherwise the Hausdorff dimension is always greater or equal to the topological dimension). This is a fundamental theorem of fractal theory. (Certain contributions to this development were also made by Samuel Eilenberg, see: Witold Hurewicz and Henry Wallman, &quot;Dimension Theory&quot;, 1941, Chapter VII.)

<text>NZL 32, or Black Magic, is an International Americas Cup Class yacht which won the 1995 America&#x27;s Cup by defeating the American defender &quot;Young America&quot; in a 5–0 victory off San Diego, California.

==Design==
&quot;NZL 32&quot; was, in many ways, the complete opposite of her predecessor &quot;NZL 20&quot; which contested the 1992 edition of the Louis Vuitton Cup.

Instead of being the brainchild of one man (in the case of &quot;NZL 20&quot;, Bruce Farr) she was designed by a team of Tom Schnackenberg, Doug Peterson, Laurie Davidson, David Egan, Peter Jackson, Maury Leyland, David Alan-Williams, Anthony Lehmann, Richard Karn, Wayne Smith, Mike Drumond, Chris Mitchell and Neil Wilkinson. The idea was to produce a yacht that suited the crew, catering to their specific wants and needs. &quot;NZL 32&quot; was built of carbon fibre by the McMullen &amp; Wing yard, Auckland, in 1994.

Her sister yacht, &quot;NZL 38&quot;, or &quot;Black Magic II&quot;, was used in the initial stages of the Louis Vuitton Cup in San Diego winning all but one race. However, Team New Zealand believed &quot;NZL 32&quot; to be faster than &quot;NZL 38&quot; and so retired her early, before the Louis Vuitton Cup semi-finals. &quot;NZL 38&quot; became a trial horse for Team New Zealand&#x27;s 2000 defence of the America&#x27;s Cup in Auckland, and was purchased for the 2003 Cup by the Swedish Victory Challenge. She was eventually renamed &quot;Cristina&quot;.

==Career==

===Louis Vuitton Cup finals===
With &quot;NZL 38&quot; now retired, &quot;NZL 32&quot; was brought out for the final stages of the Louis Vuitton Cup. She proved to be faster than &quot;NZL 38&quot;, winning 9 of 11 races in the semi-finals and 5 out of 6 in the finals against &quot;oneAustralia&quot;. As the winner of the Louis Vuitton Cup, she now had the right to challenge for the America&#x27;s Cup itself.

===1995 America&#x27;s Cup===
By this stage, it was clear &quot;NZL 32&quot; was far superior to any of her rivals, including the winner of the defender series &quot;Stars &amp; Stripes&quot; (USA-34). With that knowledge, &quot;Stars &amp; Stripes&quot; skipper Dennis Conner swapped boats for the Cup matches, taking the helm of &quot;Young America&quot;. While &quot;Young America&quot; didn&#x27;t win the Defender&#x27;s Series, she was widely believed to be faster than &quot;Stars &amp; Stripes&quot;.

&quot;Young America&quot; was however no match for NZL 32. In what became known as a &quot;blackwash&quot;, &quot;Black Magic&quot; trounced &quot;Young America&quot; 5–0 in the Cup match, and thus remains unbeaten in an America&#x27;s Cup race.

===After the America&#x27;s Cup===

&quot;NZL 32&quot; was used as a trial boat for the 2003 challenge of Le Défi and China Team.

In July 2002, she was donated to the Museum of New Zealand, however there was much debate over how she should be displayed to the nation. The initial proposal was for a &#x27;glass case&#x27; with the yacht placed inside – a giant &quot;ship in a bottle&quot; – however this was likened to a &quot;glass coffin&quot; by many and as such was abandoned.

Eventually, following the murder of Team New Zealand&#x27;s inspirational leader Sir Peter Blake, it was decided &quot;NZL 32&quot; would form the centrepiece of a tribute to him. This was constructed at the National Maritime Museum in Auckland and was named &#x27;Blue Water Black Magic&#x27; – an interactive exhibit and tribute to Blake. &quot;NZL 32&quot; is suspended from the ceiling and can be viewed from all angles, with much of Blake&#x27;s yachting memorabilia exhibited around it.

<doc id="1028158" wikidata="Q1220611" url="?curid=1028158" title="Canonical basis">
<text>In mathematics, a canonical basis is a basis of an algebraic structure that is canonical in a sense that depends on the precise context:

* In a coordinate space, and more generally in a free module, it refers to the standard basis defined by the Kronecker delta.
* In a polynomial ring, it refers to its standard basis given by the monomials, formula_1.
* For finite extension fields, it means the polynomial basis.
* In linear algebra, it refers to a set of &quot;n&quot; linearly independent generalized eigenvectors of an &quot;n&quot;×&quot;n&quot; matrix formula_2, if the set is composed entirely of Jordan chains.
* In representation theory, it refers to the basis of the quantum groups introduced by Lusztig.

==Representation theory==
The canonical basis for the irreducible representations of a quantized enveloping algebra of
type formula_3 and also for the plus part of that algebra was introduced by Lusztig by
two methods: an algebraic one (using a braid group action and PBW bases) and a topological one
(using intersection cohomology). Specializing the parameter formula_4 to formula_5 yields a canonical basis for the irreducible representations of the corresponding simple Lie algebra, which was
not known earlier. Specializing the parameter formula_4 to formula_7 yields something like a shadow of a basis. This shadow (but not the basis itself) for the case of irreducible representations
was considered independently by Kashiwara; it is sometimes called the crystal basis.
The definition of the canonical basis was extended to the Kac-Moody setting by Kashiwara (by an algebraic method) and by Lusztig (by a topological method).

There is a general concept underlying these bases:

Consider the ring of integral Laurent polynomials formula_8 with its two subrings formula_9 and the automorphism formula_10 defined by formula_11.

A &quot;precanonical structure&quot; on a free formula_12-module formula_13 consists of
* A &quot;standard&quot; basis formula_14 of formula_13,
* An interval finite partial order on formula_16, that is, formula_17 is finite for all formula_18,
* A dualization operation, that is, a bijection formula_19 of order two that is formula_10-semilinear and will be denoted by formula_10 as well.

If a precanonical structure is given, then one can define the formula_22 submodule formula_23 of formula_13.

A &quot;canonical basis of the precanonical structure is then a formula_12-basis formula_26 of formula_13 that satisfies:
* formula_28 and
* formula_29
for all formula_18.

One can show that there exists at most one canonical basis for each precanonical structure. A sufficient condition for existence is that the polynomials formula_31 defined by formula_32 satisfy formula_33 and formula_34.

A canonical basis induces an isomorphism from formula_35 to formula_36.

=== Hecke algebras ===
Let formula_37 be a Coxeter group. The corresponding Iwahori-Hecke algebra formula_38 has the standard basis formula_39, the group is partially ordered by the Bruhat order which is interval finite and has a dualization operation defined by formula_40. This is a precanonical structure on formula_38 that satisfies the sufficient condition above and the corresponding canonical basis of formula_38 is the Kazhdan–Lusztig basis

: formula_43

with formula_44 being the Kazhdan–Lusztig polynomials.

==Linear algebra==
If we are given an &quot;n&quot; × &quot;n&quot; matrix formula_2 and wish to find a matrix formula_46 in Jordan normal form, similar to formula_2, we are interested only in sets of linearly independent generalized eigenvectors. A matrix in Jordan normal form is an &quot;almost diagonal matrix,&quot; that is, as close to diagonal as possible. A diagonal matrix formula_48 is a special case of a matrix in Jordan normal form. An ordinary eigenvector is a special case of a generalized eigenvector.

Every &quot;n&quot; × &quot;n&quot; matrix formula_2 possesses &quot;n&quot; linearly independent generalized eigenvectors. Generalized eigenvectors corresponding to distinct eigenvalues are linearly independent. If formula_50 is an eigenvalue of formula_2 of algebraic multiplicity formula_52, then formula_2 will have formula_52 linearly independent generalized eigenvectors corresponding to formula_50.

For any given &quot;n&quot; × &quot;n&quot; matrix formula_2, there are infinitely many ways to pick the &quot;n&quot; linearly independent generalized eigenvectors. If they are chosen in a particularly judicious manner, we can use these vectors to show that formula_2 is similar to a matrix in Jordan normal form. In particular,

Definition: A set of &quot;n&quot; linearly independent generalized eigenvectors is a canonical basis if it is composed entirely of Jordan chains.

Thus, once we have determined that a generalized eigenvector of rank &quot;m&quot; is in a canonical basis, it follows that the &quot;m&quot; − 1 vectors formula_58 that are in the Jordan chain generated by formula_59 are also in the canonical basis.

===Computation===
Let formula_60 be an eigenvalue of formula_2 of algebraic multiplicity formula_62. First, find the ranks (matrix ranks) of the matrices formula_63. The integer formula_64 is determined to be the &quot;first integer&quot; for which formula_65 has rank formula_66 (&quot;n&quot; being the number of rows or columns of formula_2, that is, formula_2 is &quot;n&quot; × &quot;n&quot;).

Now define

:formula_69

The variable formula_70 designates the number of linearly independent generalized eigenvectors of rank &quot;k&quot; (generalized eigenvector rank; see generalized eigenvector) corresponding to the eigenvalue formula_60 that will appear in a canonical basis for formula_2. Note that

:formula_73

Once we have determined the number of generalized eigenvectors of each rank that a canonical basis has, we can obtain the vectors explicitly (see generalized eigenvector).

===Example===
This example illustrates a canonical basis with two Jordan chains. Unfortunately, it is a little difficult to construct an interesting example of low order.
The matrix

:formula_74

has eigenvalues formula_75 and formula_76 with algebraic multiplicities formula_77 and formula_78, but geometric multiplicities formula_79 and formula_80.

For formula_81 we have formula_82

:formula_83 has rank 5,
:formula_84 has rank 4,
:formula_85 has rank 3,
:formula_86 has rank 2.

Therefore formula_87

:formula_88
:formula_89
:formula_90
:formula_91

Thus, a canonical basis for formula_2 will have, corresponding to formula_81 one generalized eigenvector each of ranks 4, 3, 2 and 1.

For formula_94 we have formula_95

:formula_96 has rank 5,
:formula_97 has rank 4.

Therefore formula_98

:formula_99
:formula_100

Thus, a canonical basis for formula_2 will have, corresponding to formula_94 one generalized eigenvector each of ranks 2 and 1.

A canonical basis for formula_2 is

:formula_104

formula_105 is the ordinary eigenvector associated with formula_106. 
formula_107 and formula_108 are generalized eigenvectors associated with formula_106. 
formula_110 is the ordinary eigenvector associated with formula_111. 
formula_112 is a generalized eigenvector associated with formula_111.

A matrix formula_46 in Jordan normal form, similar to formula_2 is obtained as follows:

:formula_116
:formula_117

where the matrix formula_118 is a generalized modal matrix for formula_2 and formula_120.

<text>Captal (Lat. capitalis, first, chief ), was a medieval feudal title in Gascony. According to Du Cange the designation was applied loosely to the more illustrious nobles of Aquitaine, counts, viscounts, etc., probably as capitales domini, principal lords, though he quotes more fanciful explanations.

As an actual title the word was used only by the lords of Trene, Puychagut, Epernon and Buch (a lordship being an amalgamation of two or more seigniories).

It is best known in connection with the famous soldier, Jean III de Grailly, captal de Buch KG (d. 1376), the captal de Buch par excellence, immortalized by Froissart as the confidant of the Black Prince and the champion of the English cause against France. His active part in the war began in 1364, when he ravaged the country between Paris and Rouen, but was beaten by Bertrand du Guesclin at Cocherel and taken prisoner. Released next year, he received the seigniory of Nemours and took the oath of fealty to the French king, Charles V, but soon resigned his new fief and returned to his allegiance to the English king. In 1367 he took part in the battle of Navarette, in which Du Guesclin was taken prisoner, the captal being entrusted with his safe-keeping. In 1371 Jean de Grailly was appointed constable of Aquitaine, but was taken prisoner next year and interned in the Temple at Paris where, resisting all the tempting offers of the French king, he remained till his death five years later.
