<text>Grasshoppers are a group of insects belonging to the suborder Caelifera. They are amongst what are possibly the most ancient living groups of chewing herbivorous insects, dating back to the early Triassic around 250 million years ago.

Grasshoppers are typically ground-dwelling insects with powerful hind legs which allow them to escape from threats by leaping vigorously. Their front legs are shorter and used for grasping food. As hemimetabolous insects, they do not undergo complete metamorphosis; they hatch from an egg into a nymph or &quot;hopper&quot; which undergoes five moults, becoming more similar to the adult insect at each developmental stage. The grasshopper hears through the tympanal organ which can be found in the first segment of the abdomen attached to the thorax; while its sense of vision is in the compound eyes, a change in light intensity is perceived in the simple eyes (ocelli). At high population densities and under certain environmental conditions, some grasshopper species can change colour and behavior and form swarms. Under these circumstances, they are known as locusts.

Grasshoppers are plant-eaters, with a few species at times becoming serious pests of cereals, vegetables and pasture, especially when they swarm in the millions as locusts and destroy crops over wide areas. They protect themselves from predators by camouflage; when detected, many species attempt to startle the predator with a brilliantly coloured wing flash while jumping and (if adult) launching themselves into the air, usually flying for only a short distance. Other species such as the rainbow grasshopper have warning coloration which deters predators. Grasshoppers are affected by parasites and various diseases, and many predatory creatures feed on both nymphs and adults. The eggs are subject to attack by parasitoids and predators. Grasshoppers are diurnal insects, meaning they are most active during the day time.

Grasshoppers have had a long relationship with humans. Swarms of locusts can have devastating effects and cause famine, having done so since Biblical times. Even in smaller numbers, the insects can be serious pests. They are used as food in countries such as Mexico and Indonesia. They feature in art, symbolism and literature. The study of grasshopper species is called acridology.

==Phylogeny==
Grasshoppers belong to the suborder Caelifera. Although &quot;grasshopper&quot; has been used as a common name for the suborder in general, modern sources restrict it to the more &quot;evolved&quot; families. They may be placed in the infraorder Acrididea and have been referred to as &quot;short-horned grasshoppers&quot; in older texts to distinguish them from the also-obsolete term &quot;long-horned grasshoppers&quot; (now bush-crickets or katydids) with their much longer antennae. The phylogeny of the Caelifera, based on mitochondrial ribosomal RNA of thirty-two taxa in six out of seven superfamilies, is shown as a cladogram. The Ensifera (crickets, &quot;etc.&quot;), Caelifera and all the superfamilies of grasshoppers except &quot;Pamphagoidea&quot; appear to be monophyletic.


In evolutionary terms, the split between the Caelifera and the Ensifera is no more recent than the Permo-Triassic boundary; the earliest insects that are certainly Caeliferans are in the extinct families Locustopseidae and Locustavidae from the early Triassic, roughly 250 million years ago. The group diversified during the Triassic and have remained important plant-eaters from that time to now. The first modern families such as the Eumastacidae, Tetrigidae and Tridactylidae appeared in the Cretaceous, though some insects that might belong to the last two of these groups are found in the early Jurassic. Morphological classification is difficult because many taxa have converged towards a common habitat type; recent taxonomists have concentrated on the internal genitalia, especially those of the male. This information is not available from fossil specimens, and the palaeontological taxonomy is founded principally on the venation of the hindwings.

The Caelifera includes some 2,400 valid genera and about 11,000 known species. Many undescribed species probably exist, especially in tropical wet forests. The Caelifera have a predominantly tropical distribution with fewer species known from temperate zones, but most of the superfamilies have representatives worldwide. They are almost exclusively herbivorous and are probably the oldest living group of chewing herbivorous insects.

The most diverse superfamily is the Acridoidea, with around 8,000 species. The two main families in this are the Acrididae (grasshoppers and locusts) with a worldwide distribution, and the Romaleidae (lubber grasshoppers), found chiefly in the New World. The Ommexechidae and Tristiridae are South American, and the Lentulidae, Lithidiidae and Pamphagidae are mainly African. The Pauliniids are nocturnal and can swim or skate on water, and the Lentulids are wingless. Pneumoridae are native to Africa, particularly southern Africa, and are distinguished by the inflated abdomens of the males.

==Characteristics==
Grasshoppers have the typical insect body plan of head, thorax, and abdomen. The head is held vertically at an angle to the body, with the mouth at the bottom. The head bears a large pair of compound eyes which give all-round vision, three simple eyes which can detect light and dark, and a pair of thread-like antennae that are sensitive to touch and smell. The downward-directed mouthparts are modified for chewing and there are two sensory palps in front of the jaws.

The thorax and abdomen are segmented and have a rigid cuticle made up of overlapping plates composed of chitin. The three fused thoracic segments bear three pairs of legs and two pairs of wings. The forewings, known as tegmina, are narrow and leathery while the hindwings are large and membranous, the veins providing strength. The legs are terminated by claws for gripping. The hind leg is particularly powerful. The legs of these species are so powerful that they can jump quite a long distance. they also use this to flee from danger. The femur is robust and has several ridges where different surfaces join and the inner ridges bear stridulatory pegs in some species. The posterior edge of the tibia bears a double row of spines and there are a pair of articulated spurs near its lower end. The interior of the thorax houses the muscles that control the wings and legs.


The abdomen has eleven segments, the first of which is fused to the thorax and contains the tympanal organ and hearing system. Segments two to eight are ring-shaped and joined by flexible membranes. Segments nine to eleven are reduced in size; segment nine bears a pair of cerci and segments ten and eleven have the reproductive organs. Female grasshoppers are normally larger than males, with short ovipositors. The name of the suborder &quot;Caelifera&quot; comes from the Latin and means &quot;chisel-bearing&quot;, referring to the shape of the ovipositor.

The grasshopper&#x27;s auditory organs are located on its abdomen, rather than on its head. These organs consist of a pair of membranes, each positioned on either side of the first abdominal segment and tucked under the wings. Known as tympanal organs, these simple eardrums vibrate in response to sound waves, enabling the grasshopper to hear the songs of other grasshoppers.

Those species that make easily heard noises usually do so by rubbing a row of pegs on the hind legs against the edges of the forewings (stridulation). These sounds are produced mainly by males to attract females, though in some species the females also stridulate.

Grasshoppers may be confused with crickets, but they differ in many aspects; these include the number of segments in their antennae and the structure of the ovipositor, as well as the location of the tympanal organ and the methods by which sound is produced. Ensiferans have antennae that can be much longer than the body and have at least 20–24 segments, while caeliferans have fewer segments in their shorter, stouter antennae.

==Biology==

===Diet and digestion===

Most grasshoppers are polyphagous, eating vegetation from multiple plant sources, but some are omnivorous and also eat animal tissue and animal faeces. In general their preference is for grasses, including many cereals grown as crops. The digestive system is typical of insects, with Malpighian tubules discharging into the midgut. Carbohydrates are digested mainly in the crop, while proteins are digested in the ceca of the midgut. Saliva is abundant but largely free of enzymes, helping to move food and Malpighian secretions along the gut. Some grasshoppers possess cellulase, which by softening plant cell walls makes plant cell contents accessible to other digestive enzymes. Grasshoppers can also be cannibalistic when swarming.

===Sensory organs===

Grasshoppers have a typical insect nervous system, and have an extensive set of external sense organs. On the side of the head are a pair of large compound eyes which give a broad field of vision and can detect movement, shape, colour and distance. There are also three simple eyes (ocelli) on the forehead which can detect light intensity, a pair of antennae containing olfactory (smell) and touch receptors, and mouthparts containing gustatory (taste) receptors. At the front end of the abdomen there is a pair of tympanal organs for sound reception. There are numerous fine hairs (setae) covering the whole body that act as mechanoreceptors (touch and wind sensors), and these are most dense on the antennae, the palps (part of the mouth), and on the cerci at the tip of the abdomen. There are special receptors (campaniform sensillae) embedded in the cuticle of the legs that sense pressure and cuticle distortion. There are internal &quot;chordotonal&quot; sense organs specialized to detect position and movement about the joints of the exoskeleton. The receptors convey information to the central nervous system through sensory neurons, and most of these have their cell bodies located in the periphery near the receptor site itself.

===Circulation and respiration===

Like other insects, grasshoppers have an open circulatory system and their body cavities are filled with haemolymph. A heart-like structure in the upper part of the abdomen pumps the fluid to the head from where it percolates past the tissues and organs on its way back to the abdomen. This system circulates nutrients throughout the body and carries metabolic wastes to be excreted into the gut. Other functions of the haemolymph include wound healing, heat transfer and the provision of hydrostatic pressure, but the circulatory system is not involved in gaseous exchange. Respiration is performed using tracheae, air-filled tubes, which open at the surfaces of the thorax and abdomen through pairs of valved spiracles. Larger insects may need to actively ventilate their bodies by opening some spiracles while others remain closed, using abdominal muscles to expand and contract the body and pump air through the system.

=== Jumping ===

Grasshoppers jump by extending their large back legs and pushing against the substrate (the ground, a twig, a blade of grass or whatever else they are standing on); the reaction force propels them into the air. A large grasshopper, such as a locust, can jump about a metre (20 body lengths) without using its wings; the acceleration peaks at about 20 g.

They jump for several reasons; to escape from a predator, to launch themselves into flight, or simply to move from place to place. For the escape jump in particular there is strong selective pressure to maximize take-off velocity, since this determines the range. This means that the legs must thrust against the ground with both high force and a high velocity of movement. A fundamental property of muscle is that it cannot contract with high force and high velocity at the same time. Grasshoppers overcome this by using a catapult mechanism to amplify the mechanical power produced by their muscles.

The jump is a three-stage process. First, the grasshopper fully flexes the lower part of the leg (tibia) against the upper part (femur) by activating the flexor tibiae muscle (the back legs of the grasshopper in the top photograph are in this preparatory position). Second, there is a period of co-contraction in which force builds up in the large, pennate extensor tibiae muscle, but the tibia is kept flexed by the simultaneous contraction of the flexor tibiae muscle. The extensor muscle is much stronger than the flexor muscle, but the latter is aided by specialisations in the joint that give it a large effective mechanical advantage over the former when the tibia is fully flexed. Co-contraction can last for up to half a second, and during this period the extensor muscle shortens and stores elastic strain energy by distorting stiff cuticular structures in the leg. The extensor muscle contraction is quite slow (almost isometric), which allows it to develop high force (up to 14 N in the desert locust), but because it is slow only low power is needed. The third stage of the jump is the trigger relaxation of the flexor muscle, which releases the tibia from the flexed position. The subsequent rapid tibial extension is driven mainly by the relaxation of the elastic structures, rather than by further shortening of the extensor muscle. In this way the stiff cuticle acts like the elastic of a catapult, or the bow of a bow-and-arrow. Energy is put into the store at low power by slow but strong muscle contraction, and retrieved from the store at high power by rapid relaxation of the mechanical elastic structures.

===Stridulation===

Male grasshoppers spend much of the day stridulating, singing more actively under optimal conditions and being more subdued when conditions are adverse; females also stridulate, but their efforts are insignificant when compared to the males. Late-stage male nymphs can sometimes be seen making stridulatory movements, although they lack the equipment to make sounds, demonstrating the importance of this behavioural trait. The songs are a means of communication; the male stridulation seems to express reproductive maturity, the desire for social cohesion and individual well-being. Social cohesion becomes necessary among grasshoppers because of their ability to jump or fly large distances, and the song can serve to limit dispersal and guide others to favourable habitat. The generalised song can vary in phraseology and intensity, and is modified in the presence of a rival male, and changes again to a courtship song when a female is nearby. In male grasshoppers of the family Pneumoridae, the enlarged abdomen amplifies stridulation.

===Life cycle===
In most grasshopper species, conflicts between males over females rarely escalate beyond ritualistic displays. Some exceptions include the chameleon grasshopper (&quot;Kosciuscola tristis&quot;), where males may fight on top of ovipositing females; engaging in leg grappling, biting, kicking and mounting.

The newly emerged female grasshopper has a preoviposition period of a week or two while she increases in weight and her eggs mature. After mating, the female of most species digs a hole with her ovipositor and lays a batch of eggs in a pod in the ground near food plants, generally in the summer. After laying the eggs, she covers the hole with soil and litter. Some, like the semi-aquatic &quot;Cornops aquaticum&quot;, deposit the pod directly into plant tissue. The eggs in the pod are glued together with a froth in some species. After a few weeks of development, the eggs of most species in temperate climates go into diapause, and pass the winter in this state. Diapause is broken by a sufficiently low ground temperature, with development resuming as soon as the ground warms above a certain threshold temperature. The embryos in a pod generally all hatch out within a few minutes of each other. They soon shed their membranes and their exoskeletons harden. These first instar nymphs can then jump away from predators.
Grasshoppers undergo incomplete metamorphosis: they repeatedly moult, each instar becoming larger and more like an adult, with the wing-buds increasing in size at each stage. The number of instars varies between species but is often six. After the final moult, the wings are inflated and become fully functional. The migratory grasshopper, &quot;Melanoplus sanguinipes&quot;, spends about 25 to 30 days as a nymph, depending on sex and temperature, and lives for about 51 days as an adult.

===Swarming===

Locusts are the swarming phase of certain species of short-horned grasshoppers in the family Acrididae. Swarming behaviour is a response to overcrowding. Increased tactile stimulation of the hind legs causes an increase in levels of serotonin. This causes the grasshopper to change colour, feed more and breed faster. The transformation of a solitary individual into a swarming one is induced by several contacts per minute over a short period.

Following this transformation, under suitable conditions dense nomadic bands of flightless nymphs known as &quot;hoppers&quot; can occur, producing pheromones which attract the insects to each other. With several generations in a year, the locust population can build up from localised groups into vast accumulations of flying insects known as plagues, devouring all the vegetation they encounter. The largest recorded locust swarm was one formed by the now-extinct Rocky Mountain locust in 1875; the swarm was long and wide, and one estimate puts the number of locusts involved at 3.5 trillion. An adult desert locust can eat about of plant material each day, so the billions of insects in a large swarm can be very destructive, stripping all the foliage from plants in an affected area and consuming stems, flowers, fruits, seeds and bark.

==Predators, parasites, and pathogens==

Grasshoppers have a wide range of predators at different stages of their lives; eggs are eaten by bee-flies, ground beetles and blister beetles; hoppers and adults are taken by other insects such as ants, robber flies and sphecid wasps, by spiders, and by many birds and small mammals including dogs and cats.

The eggs and nymphs are under attack by parasitoids including blow flies, flesh flies, and tachinid flies. External parasites of adults and nymphs include mites. Female grasshoppers parasitised by mites produce fewer eggs and thus have fewer offspring than unaffected individuals.
The grasshopper nematode (&quot;Mermis nigrescens&quot;) is a long slender worm that infects grasshoppers, living in the insects&#x27; hemocoel. Adult worms lay eggs on plants and the host becomes infected when the foliage is eaten. &quot;Spinochordodes tellinii&quot; and &quot;Paragordius tricuspidatus&quot; are parasitic worms that infect grasshoppers and alter the behaviour of their hosts. When the worms are sufficiently developed, the grasshopper is persuaded to leap into a nearby body of water where it drowns, thus enabling the parasite to continue with the next stage of its life cycle, which takes place in water.
Grasshoppers are affected by diseases caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi and protozoa. The bacteria &quot;Serratia marcescens&quot; and &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot; have both been implicated in causing disease in grasshoppers, as has the entomopathogenic fungus &quot;Beauveria bassiana&quot;. This widespread fungus has been used to control various pest insects around the world, but although it infects grasshoppers, the infection is not usually lethal because basking in the sun has the result of raising the insects&#x27; temperature above a threshold tolerated by the fungus. The fungal pathogen &quot;Entomophaga grylli&quot; is able to influence the behaviour of its grasshopper host, causing it to climb to the top of a plant and cling to the stem as it dies. This ensures wide dispersal of the fungal spores liberated from the corpse.

The fungal pathogen &quot;Metarhizium acridum&quot; is found in Africa, Australia and Brazil where it has caused epizootics in grasshoppers. It is being investigated for possible use as a microbial insecticide for locust control. The microsporidian fungus &quot;Nosema locustae&quot;, once considered to be a protozoan, can be lethal to grasshoppers. It has to be consumed by mouth and is the basis for a bait-based commercial microbial pesticide. Various other microsporidians and protozoans are found in the gut.

===Anti-predator defences===
Grasshoppers exemplify a range of anti-predator adaptations, enabling them to avoid detection, to escape if detected, and in some cases to avoid being eaten if captured. Grasshoppers are often camouflaged to avoid detection by predators that hunt by sight; some species can change their coloration to suit their surroundings.

Several species such as the hooded leaf grasshopper &quot;Phyllochoreia ramakrishnai&quot; (Eumastacoidea) are detailed mimics of leaves. Stick grasshoppers (Proscopiidae) mimic wooden sticks in form and coloration. Grasshoppers often have deimatic patterns on their wings, giving a sudden flash of bright colours that may startle predators long enough to give time to escape in a combination of jump and flight.

Some species are genuinely aposematic, having both bright warning coloration and sufficient toxicity to dissuade predators. &quot;Dictyophorus productus&quot; (Pyrgomorphidae) is a &quot;heavy, bloated, sluggish insect&quot; that makes no attempt to hide; it has a bright red abdomen. A &quot;Cercopithecus&quot; monkey that ate other grasshoppers refused to eat the species. Another species, the rainbow or painted grasshopper of Arizona, &quot;Dactylotum bicolor&quot; (Acridoidea), has been shown by experiment with a natural predator, the little striped whiptail lizard, to be aposematic.

==Relationship with humans==


===In art and media===
Grasshoppers are occasionally depicted in artworks, such as the Dutch Golden Age painter Balthasar van der Ast&#x27;s still life oil painting, &quot;Flowers in a Vase with Shells and Insects&quot;, c. 1630, now in the National Gallery, London, though the insect may be a bush-cricket.

Another orthopteran is found in Rachel Ruysch&#x27;s still life &quot;Flowers in a Vase&quot;, c. 1685. The seemingly static scene is animated by a &quot;grasshopper on the table that looks about ready to spring&quot;, according to the gallery curator Betsy Wieseman, with other invertebrates including a spider, an ant, and two caterpillars.

Grasshoppers are also featured in cinema. The 1957 film &quot;Beginning of the End&quot; portrayed giant grasshoppers attacking Chicago. In the 1998 Disney/Pixar animated film &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot;, the antagonists are a gang of grasshoppers, with their leader Hopper serving as the main villain.

The protagonists of the 1971 &quot;tokusatsu&quot; series &quot;Kamen Rider&quot; primarily carry a grasshopper motif (for example Kamen Rider Black&#x27;s Batta Man form), which continues to serve as the baseline visual template for most entries in the media franchise it has given birth to since.

===Symbolism===
Grasshoppers are sometimes used as symbols. During the Greek Archaic Era, the grasshopper was the symbol of the &quot;polis&quot; of Athens, possibly because they were among the most common insects on the dry plains of Attica. Native Athenians for a while wore golden grasshopper brooches to symbolise that they were of pure Athenian lineage with no foreign ancestors. In addition, Peisistratus hung the figure of a kind of grasshopper before the Acropolis of Athens as apotropaic magic.

Another symbolic use of the grasshopper is Sir Thomas Gresham&#x27;s gilded grasshopper in Lombard Street, London, dating from 1563; the building was for a while the headquarters of the Guardian Royal Exchange, but the company declined to use the symbol for fear of confusion with the locust.

Grasshoppers appearing in dreams have been interpreted as symbols of &quot;Freedom, independence, spiritual enlightenment, inability to settle down or commit to decision&quot;. Locusts are taken literally to mean devastation of crops in the case of farmers; figuratively as &quot;wicked men and women&quot; for non-farmers; and &quot;Extravagance, misfortune, &amp; ephemeral happiness&quot; by &quot;gypsies&quot;.

===As food===


In some countries, grasshoppers are used as food. In southern Mexico, grasshoppers, known as &quot;chapulines&quot;, are eaten in a variety of dishes, such as in tortillas with chilli sauce. Grasshoppers are served on skewers in some Chinese food markets, like the Donghuamen Night Market. Fried grasshoppers (&quot;walang goreng&quot;) are eaten in the Gunung Kidul Regency, Yogyakarta, Java in Indonesia. Grasshoppers are a beloved delicacy in Uganda; they are usually eaten fried (most commonly in November and May after the rains). In America, the Ohlone burned grassland to herd grasshoppers into pits where they could be collected as food.
It is recorded in the Bible that John the Baptist ate locusts and wild honey (Greek: ἀκρίδες καὶ μέλι ἄγριον, &quot;akrídes kaì méli ágrion&quot;) while living in the wilderness. However, because of a tradition of depicting him as an ascetic, attempts have been made to explain that the &quot;locusts&quot; were in fact a suitably ascetic vegetarian food such as carob beans, notwithstanding the fact that the word &quot;ἀκρίδες&quot; means plainly &quot;grasshoppers&quot;.

In recent years, with the search for alternative healthy and sustainable protein sources, grasshoppers are being cultivated by commercial companies operating grasshopper farms and are being used as food and protein supplements.

===As pests===
Grasshoppers eat large quantities of foliage both as adults and during their development, and can be serious pests of arid land and prairies. Pasture, grain, forage, vegetable and other crops can be affected. Grasshoppers often bask in the sun, and thrive in warm sunny conditions, so drought stimulates an increase in grasshopper populations. A single season of drought is not normally sufficient to stimulate a major population increase, but several successive dry seasons can do so, especially if the intervening winters are mild so that large numbers of nymphs survive. Although sunny weather stimulates growth, there needs to be an adequate food supply for the increasing grasshopper population. This means that although precipitation is needed to stimulate plant growth, prolonged periods of cloudy weather will slow nymphal development.

Grasshoppers can best be prevented from becoming pests by manipulating their environment. Shade provided by trees will discourage them and they may be prevented from moving onto developing crops by removing coarse vegetation from fallow land and field margins and discouraging thick growth beside ditches and on roadside verges. With increasing numbers of grasshoppers, predator numbers may increase, but this seldom happens rapidly enough to have much effect on populations. Biological control is being investigated, and spores of the protozoan parasite &quot;Nosema locustae&quot; can be used mixed with bait to control grasshoppers, being more effective with immature insects. On a small scale, neem products can be effective as a feeding deterrent and as a disruptor of nymphal development. Insecticides can be used, but adult grasshoppers are difficult to kill, and as they move into fields from surrounding rank growth, crops may soon become reinfested.

Some grasshopper species, like the Chinese rice grasshopper, are a pest in rice paddies. Ploughing exposes the eggs on the surface of the field, to be destroyed by sunshine or eaten by natural enemies. Some eggs may be buried too deeply in the soil for hatching to take place.

Locust plagues can have devastating effects on human populations, causing famines and population upheavals. They are mentioned in both the Qur’an and the Bible and have also been held responsible for cholera epidemics, resulting from the corpses of locusts drowned in the Mediterranean Sea and decomposing on beaches. The FAO and other organisations monitor locust activity around the world. Timely application of pesticides can prevent nomadic bands of hoppers from forming before dense swarms of adults can build up. Besides conventional control using contact insecticides, biological pest control using the entomopathogenic fungus &quot;Metarhizium acridum&quot;, which specifically infects grasshoppers, has been used with some success.

===Detection of explosives===
In February 2020, researchers from Washington University in St. Louis announced they had engineered &quot;cyborg grasshoppers&quot; capable of accurately detecting explosives. In the project, funded by the US Office of Naval Research, researchers fitted grasshoppers with lightweight sensor backpacks that recorded and transmitted the electrical activity of their antennal lobes to a computer. According to the researchers, the grasshoppers were able to detect the location of the highest concentration of explosives. The researchers also tested the effect of combining sensorial information from several grasshoppers on detection accuracy. The neural activity from seven grasshoppers yielded an average detection accuracy rate of 80%, whereas a single grasshopper yielded a 60% rate.

===In literature===

The Egyptian word for locust or grasshopper was written &quot;snḥm&quot; in the consonantal hieroglyphic writing system. The pharaoh Ramesses II compared the armies of the Hittites to locusts: &quot;They covered the mountains and valleys and were like locusts in their multitude.&quot;

One of Aesop&#x27;s Fables, later retold by La Fontaine, is the tale of &quot;The Ant and the Grasshopper&quot;. The ant works hard all summer, while the grasshopper plays. In winter, the ant is ready but the grasshopper starves. Somerset Maugham&#x27;s short story &quot;The Ant and the Grasshopper&quot; explores the fable&#x27;s symbolism via complex framing. Other human weaknesses besides improvidence have become identified with the grasshopper&#x27;s behaviour. So an unfaithful woman (hopping from man to man) is &quot;a grasshopper&quot; in &quot;Poprygunya&quot;, an 1892 short story by Anton Chekhov, and in Jerry Paris&#x27;s 1969 film &quot;The Grasshopper&quot;.

===In mechanical engineering===
The name &quot;Grasshopper&quot; was given to the Aeronca L-3 and Piper L-4 light aircraft, both used for reconnaissance and other support duties in World War II. The name is said to have originated when Major General Innis P. Swift saw a Piper making a rough landing and remarked that it looked like a grasshopper for its bouncing progress.

Grasshopper beam engines were beam engines pivoted at one end, the long horizontal arm resembling the hind leg of a grasshopper. The type was patented by William Freemantle in 1803.

<text>Coulee, or coulée ( or ), is any of various different landforms, all of which are kinds of valleys or drainage zones. The word &quot;coulee&quot; comes from the Canadian French &quot;coulée&quot;, from French &quot;couler&quot; &#x27;to flow&#x27;.

The term is often used interchangeably in the Great Plains for any of a number of water features, from ponds to creeks.

In southern Louisiana the word &quot;coulée&quot; (also spelled &quot;coolie&quot;) originally meant a gully or ravine usually dry or intermittent but becoming sizable during rainy weather. As stream channels were dredged or canalized, the term was increasingly applied to perennial streams, generally smaller than bayous. The term is also used for small ditches or canals in the swamp.

In the northwestern United States, coulee is defined as a large, steep-walled, trench-like trough, which also include spillways and flood channels incised into the basalt plateau.

==Types and examples==
* The dry, braided channels formed by glacial drainage of the Scablands of eastern Washington, such as Grand Coulee and Moses Coulee. Moses Coulee and Lenore Canyon, lower Grand Coulee, have hanging valleys, where pre-flood tributaries enter the coulees at least above the coulee floor. 
* The furrowed moraines channeling rain runoff in the area east of the Missouri Coteau in the western United States and western Canada at the base of the Rocky Mountains.
* In the western United States, tongue-like protrusions of solidified lava, forming a sort of canyon. 
* In Wisconsin it is applied to valleys. These valleys tend to have high, steep walls. &quot;Hollow&quot; is used as a synonym, often for the smallest of such valleys. The term is also applied to the greater La Crosse, Wisconsin metropolitan area (i.e. the &quot;Coulee Region&quot;).
* The Gassman Coulee in North Dakota may have been a contributing factor to the flooding of the Souris River in June 2011.

==Geomorphology==
Aside from those formed by volcanic eruptions, coulees are commonly canyons characterized by steep walls that have been shaped by erosion. These types of coulees are generally found in the northwestern United States and southwestern Canada. In the American west, rapid melting of glaciers at the end of the last ice age caused catastrophic flooding which removed bedrock by massive down-cutting erosion, forming deep canyons. Some coulees may be seasonally dry or contain small streams, however these small misfit streams do not have the magnitude of force necessary to form such expansive erosion. 

In Wisconsin, they are the product of nearly a half million years of erosion, unmodified by glaciation (see Driftless Area). The loose rocks at the base of the wall form what are called scree slopes. These are formed when chunks of the canyon wall give way in a rockslide. Left alone, the valleys are often woodland, with the ridgetops transitioning into tallgrass prairie when not turned into pasture or used for row crops.

Coulees provide shelter from wind and concentrated water supplies to plants which would otherwise struggle to survive in the xeric sagebrush steppe. Trees are often found in riparian habitats along streams in coulees and at the base of their walls.

<text>Greg Iles (born 1960) is an American novelist who lives in Mississippi. He has published seventeen novels and one novella, spanning a variety of genres.

==Early life==
Iles was born in 1960 in Stuttgart, West Germany, where his physician father ran the US Embassy Medical Clinic. He was raised in Natchez, Mississippi, the setting of many of his novels. After attending Trinity Episcopal Day School, he graduated from the University of Mississippi in 1983.

==Career==
Iles spent several years as a guitarist, singer, and songwriter in the band Frankly Scarlet. He quit the band after he was married and began working on his first novel, &quot;Spandau Phoenix&quot;, a thriller about Nazi war criminal Rudolf Hess. &quot;Spandau Phoenix&quot; was published in 1993.

In 2002, Iles wrote the screenplay &quot;24 Hours&quot; from his novel of the same name. Rewritten by director Don Roos, it was renamed &quot;Trapped&quot;. Iles then rewrote the script during the shoot, at the request of the producers and actors.

In 2011, Iles was seriously injured in a traffic accident on U.S. Route 61 near Natchez. He sustained life-threatening injuries, including a ruptured aorta. He was put into an induced coma for eight days, and lost his right leg below the knee. During his three-year recovery, he wrote three volumes of a trilogy set in Natchez, Mississippi, and featuring former prosecutor Penn Cage.

Iles is a member of the literary musical group &quot;The Rock Bottom Remainders&quot;, which includes or has included authors Dave Barry, Ridley Pearson, Stephen King, Scott Turow, Amy Tan, Mitch Albom, Roy Blount, Jr., Matt Groening, and James McBride. In July 2013, he co-authored &quot;Hard Listening&quot; (2013) with the group. The ebook combines essays, fiction, musings, email exchanges and conversations, photographs, audio and video clips, and interactive quizzes to give readers a view into the private lives of the authors/musicians.

<text>North American Van Lines, or NAVL, is a large American trucking company originally formed in Cleveland, Ohio, and later based in Fort Wayne, Indiana, which specializes in home and office relocations.

==History==

North American Van Lines was established in 1933 by a group of 12 agents. By 1938 the network expanded to 120 agents, and eventually grew into one of the largest trucking companies.

In 1947, NAVL moved from Cleveland, Ohio to Fort Wayne, Indiana.

In 1952 NAVL became an international company, with the addition of its International Transportation Service business.

In 1959 NAVL bought Creston Transfer, moving new furniture, fixtures, and similar household goods throughout the US. This New Product Division was later renamed Commercial Transport in 1981.

Beginning in late 1964 NAVL created its STI (Specialized Transportation Inc.) High Value Products Division (HVPD), which later was bought out and taken private as an independent company named Specialized Transportation Inc. The original division began with 20 drivers from the NAVL Exhibit and Display Division, and moved high value electronics for defense installations, contracted by Control Data Corporation, IBM and the computer division of General Electric.

On May 10, 1966 NAVL created its subsidiary Transtar Services, Inc. in Brentwood, TN. Transtar Services supported a group of rail and water carriers of fuel, raw materials and steel freight around the Great Lakes, as wholly owned transportation subsidiaries of United States Steel Corporation, now USX Corporation (). In December 1988 the companies were organized as the USX subsidiary, Transtar, Inc.

===PepsiCo===
On July 5, 1966 Spedco Inc., a subsidiary of PepsiCo Inc., applied to the Interstate Commerce Commission to purchase NAVL for about US$22 million in PepsiCo stock. On August 29, 1967 the ICC examiner recommended the acquisition of NAVL by Spedco Inc, and on November 27, 1968 NAVL was acquired by Spedco Inc., which had Kenneth W. Maxfield as its Executive Vice President. By June 1969, North American Van Lines Inc. was fully acquired by PepsiCo.

On January 1, 1970 NAVPAC was merged into NAVL.

In 1975 NAVL started its Air Freight Division.

In 1977, Kenneth W. Maxfield was promoted to President of the NAVL subsidiary. Also that year, NAVL became the secret transporter of the King Tutankhamen treasures from Egypt during the North American tour.

In 1978 NAVL headquarters in Fort Wayne, Indiana moved to the new building location, spread across .

In 1979 NAVL moved to the top of the list among the six largest van lines.

By April 1984, North American Van Lines Inc. was put up for sale by PepsiCo.

===Norfolk Southern===
On May 3, 1984 NAVL was approved for sale by PepsiCo to Norfolk Southern Corporation for US$315 million. At the same time PepsiCo was also negotiating sale of Lee Way Motor Freight, as a further move in its divestment of its transportation division.

On May 23, 1984, Moving Credit Inc. merged into NAVL. Over the subsequent two years NAVL was merged with the railroad in a deal that had been initially approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission.

In June 1986 NAVL then hired Norfolk Southern&#x27;s advertising firm, J. Walter Thompson, Washington, to handle its advertising account of more than US$1 million. It became the first active ad campaign for NAVL since the purchase from Pepsico two years earlier.

However, on October 1, 1986, a Federal appeals court ruled that the ICC had erred when it approved the acquisition. The court then returned the case to the ICC for reconsideration, but the rocky deal ultimately survived.

In 1991 NAVL started Worldtrac, which was the industry&#x27;s first satellite tracking system, which provided the drivers location within .

In 1992 Norfolk Southern&#x27;s trucking operations, including NAVL, recorded a loss of close to $40 million, and Norfolk Southern Corp. decided to sell off two of its trucking divisions in 1993, although it retained NAVL for another five years. In 1998 Norfolk Southern exited the trucking business entirely when it sold NAVL.

===Allied Worldwide===
On January 12, 1998, NAVL was bought out from Norfolk Southern Corp. by the private investment firm Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice for more than US$200 million.

On November 21, 1999, Clayton, Dubilier and Rice also completed their acquisition of Allied Van Lines and merged it with North American Van Lines to create Allied Worldwide, although each former company maintained its own profile names. Valued at approximately US$450 million in the merger, the Allied Worldwide combined entity became the world&#x27;s largest relocation and van line logistics company.

By the 2000s the company began operations in Europe and South America.

===SIRVA===
On October 11, 2004, a group of 43 North American Van Lines&#x27; agents, named the Specialized Transportation Agent Group Inc., bought out NAVL&#x27;s High Value Products Division from SIRVA. The buyers renamed the new company Specialized Transportation Inc. (STI).

==Livery==
The North American Van Lines trucks (beginning ca.1968) are painted in white and a clear shadow of blue, with red and blue circles on the white area, and a white arrow crossing the circles. The name North American is spelled &quot;northAmerican&quot; on the company&#x27;s trucks&#x27; liveries.

The first time Vansbro was mentioned in writing was by Carl von Linné during early 18th century. The place have also been mentioned in different texts from the same era under the name - Wahnbro or Wansbro. The name is believed to stem from a bridge built across the Vanå river.

The railway between Kristinehamn and Mora was inaugurated in 1890 and the Vansbro railway station was constructed.

==Industry==
Vansbro&#x27;s early industrial history was closely connected to timber and logging. The first sawmill in the area, Danielssågen, began operating soon after the railway was built. More sawmills were built in the following years: Dalasågen (the largest sawmill in Sweden at the time) in 1892, and Brosågen in 1893.

==Events==
Vansbro is known for the annual Vansbrosimningen (&quot;The Vansbro Swim&quot;). Inaugurated in 1950, the competitors swim 2,000 meters in Vanån and 1,000 meters in the Västerdal River. 

==Famous people from Vansbro==
Vansbro is also known to be the home town of famous cross-country skier Gunde Svan, the band Svenne Rubins, the singer/songwriter Malin Jonsson, the progressive rock band Introitus, the progressive death metal-band In Mourning, the pop-singer Björn Skifs.

<doc id="1021806" wikidata="Q26509" url="?curid=1021806" title="Falun">
<text>Falun () is a city and the seat of Falun Municipality in Dalarna County, Sweden, with 37,291 inhabitants in 2010. It is also the capital of Dalarna County. Falun forms, together with Borlänge, a metropolitan area with just over 100,000 inhabitants.

Falun was originally famous for its copper mine, and is today an important service and industrial city even though the mine is closed (since 1992).

Faluån is a river, flowing through the city, separating it into two sides. Falu copper mine is located on one of the sides which during many centuries was one of Sweden&#x27;s main business. This side of the river was usually called &quot;the mining side&quot;, where not many plants grew due to the toxic smoke which contaminated the soil. On the other side of the river, where the smoke did not reach, set many large villas, which made this side to be called &quot;the delightful side&quot;. The centre of Falun consists of classical pedestrian streets with small shops. In 1998, the city reclaimed the award of &quot;the city centre of the year&quot; in Sweden.

In 2001, the city, the copper mine, and mining areas of Falun were added to the list of world heritage sites by the United Nations. Dalarna University, with its 18 000 students, has a campus located in Falun ― close to the national ski stadium where the ski world championship has taken place a number of times, including the last one in 2015.

The name of Falun has influenced the names of some Swedish items associated with the town, such as Falu red (a paint color), Falu rågrut (a snack), Falu ättika (a type of vinegar) and Falukorv.

== History ==

The town of Falun is known to have existed in the 14th century as a market place for the surrounding lands. Mining for copper had been a local business since the mid-13th century, or possibly as early as 1000, and the organisation for the extracting of copper and gold from Stora Kopparberget is believed to be the oldest still-existing enterprise in the world, proved active since 1347, when its charter was granted by King Magnus IV of Sweden. The first share in the company is dated as early as 1288.

However, an enterprise at that time was nothing more than a cooperative among the owners, each contributing with a share of money for construction, tools, &quot;etc.&quot;, necessary to run the organisation. Depending on their contributions they could use the facilities and share the profits in proportion to the relative sizes of their individual contributions.

The city of Falun received its privileges in 1641. By then Falun was already one of the largest cities in Sweden, with about 6000 inhabitants. Soon, however, the importance of the copper mine began to decrease. In 1687, parts of the mine collapsed in a landslide, creating a 100 m deep pit. Even though the mine remained in use for the next 300 years, the production gradually diminished, until it closed down in 1992.

The mining area of the Falun Mine has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, which also was the name of the mining company of Falun, is today a part of Stora Enso.

During World War II, Falun was the place where the authorities &quot;interned&quot; British and American airmen who happened to land in Sweden or reached the country after landing in German-controlled territories. Unlike civilian refugees from Germany, who were kept in internment camps throughout the country, British and American airmen were placed in hotels and bed and breakfast establishments in the Falun area, and enjoyed relative freedom.

== Climate ==

Falun has a humid continental climate (Dfb).

Winter is the longest season lasting approximately from mid-November until the end of March, although March daytime temperatures tend to be mild. With an average high temperature of , July is the warmest month. However, the all-time heat record was set on August 4, 2014, when was measured. This was, in turn, the highest measured temperature of the intense heatwave that summer that affected most of Scandinavia. The climate of Falun is more continental than most of Sweden since it is relatively far from large bodies of waters moderating temperatures. As a result, the highs of July in Falun are normally warmer than many areas much further south in the country. Winters, however, are cold but also highly variable due to the proximity to some maritime influence that often brings mild temperatures above freezing, moderating average temperatures.
The most precipitation occurs during the summer months of July and August. 
The lowest temperature ever recorded in Falun is . The weather station has however, not recorded below according to the open data.

==Architectural history==

Stora Gruvstugan was designed by Eric Geisler and built between 1771 and 1785 in a Rococo Style, also referred to as Late Baroque. The building is situated by Falun Copper Mine and used to be the main office to the copper mine. In 1882 the building was rebuilt into Berslagets museum. At the beginning of 1920, the mining came close to the structure which made it fragile and extensive repairs were made to the building.

Västra Skolan was built in 1915, based on a design by the city architect in Falun, Klas Boman. The building functioned as a school up until 2010. The tower was a replica of Kristine Kyrka, XVIIth century parish church of Falun, from which one could view the entire low built the city.

Egnellska Huset was built in 1903, and was designed by Falun&#x27;s first city architect, Klas Boman. The building functioned as a modern residential building. The building was initially a light yellow color and then later recolored in a more bright yellow color. After two separate fires in 2007 and 2008, the building was restored to its original appearance.

Falugatan is a street in Falun and has since the 15th century functioned as a connection between eastern and western Falun. Thanks to its location by the river, this site became an important commerce site for the city. When Falun, officially became a city, in 1641, it was this street that named the city to Falun. The street kept its appearance up until the 1960s when Falun was modernized architectural. During the 1960&#x27;, four of the five 18th century buildings were demolished and today, the Körsnerska Huset is the only one remaining in its original appearance.

Centralpalatset is a building located on Stora Torget in Falun and is a monumental building, decorated in Art Nouveau. It was built between 1895 and 1896, and was designed by the local architect Ferdinand Boberg. The author Selma Lagerlöf lived in the building, and it was here she wrote The Wonderful Adventures of Nils. In 1947, the initial balconies were removed and in 1955 the whole building was facing a renovation where the facade was redesigned and the whole house scaled-down, making it shorter and flatter

Wiklunds Glas was a building on Åsgatan in Falun and was designed in a combination between Art Nouveau and Renaissance in the Low Countries. The building was designed by the architect J.Wernfeldt and functioned as a location for a glass company. The building was demolished in 1971, when Falun was modernized.

Geislerska Huset was built sometime between 1765 and 1768 by Eric Geisler. The building was built by a technique which later became referred to as Eric Geisler Technique. It was the oldest building in the world built with copper slag stone. The building was demolished in 1977, and on the site today is an office building.

Rådhuset (Town Hall) is located on Stora Torget in Falun. Was built between 1649 and 1653, initially as a one-floor building, but in the 1960s, a second floor was added onto the building. In 1761, the building was destroyed in a fire, but was quickly rebuilt and is still, today, standing on the same site.

Varmbadhuset a community swimming pool facility in Falun. It was designed in a National Romantic Style by the city architect Klas Boman and built in 1911. In the 1960s a sports center was planned out for Falun and Varmbadhuset lost its importance and faced demolition in 1974, despite strong protests from the residents in Falun. On the site today is the police station.

In 1961, an architectural competition was organized in Falun. The neighborhood (Falan) between the western side of Stora Torget and Faluån was to be modernized. The competition was won by Uhlin och Malms Arkitektkontor in Stockholm. The final design was built in 1968, with two buildings along the western side of the Plaza. Since 1968, the buildings have been rebuilt many times.

== Education ==
There is a number of elementary schools in Falun, as well as a number of high schools.

For education, the city holds part of the University College of Dalarna (&quot;Högskolan Dalarna&quot;).

==Today==
In sports, Falun hosts the annual Swedish Ski Games at its skiing arena Lugnet, Falun. The city&#x27;s most successful sports team is the bandy team Falu BS which has played in the Swedish top division for many years. Also, IBF Falun, the floorball male and female teams, have been very successful. Falu FK play in Division 2 Norra Svealand.

Lugnet, Falun Stadium has also hosted the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships four times: 1954, 1974, 1993 and most recently in 2015.

The city lost out to Calgary, Alberta, Canada, in 1981 for the 1988 Winter Olympics. Again, Falun applied for the 1992 Winter Olympics but lost out to Albertville, France, in 1986. The city lost despite the best efforts of one of ABBA&#x27;s singers who recorded a single in support of the bid.

Falun is the hometown of &#x27;The Battle&#x27;, one of the world&#x27;s most famous snowboard competitions.

Iron and Copper byproducts from the mine are still used as a paint ingredient, in the production of the nationally well known and culturally important Falu Red paint, particularly used on wooden houses.

<text>Borlänge () is a locality in Dalarna County, Sweden, with 44,898 inhabitants as of 2020. It is the seat of the Borlänge Municipality which as of 2017 had a total population of 51,604 inhabitants.

== History ==

Originally Borlänge was the name of a tiny village, and traces back to at least the 1390s. The village was insignificant up until about 1870. In 1872 the construction of &quot;Domnarfvets Jernverk&quot;, the ironworks of neighbouring village Domnarvet started. In 1875 a railway between Falun and Ludvika, via Borlänge was inaugurated. Thanks to its railway station the village of Borlänge became highly important in servicing the ironworks.

In 1898, Borlänge was granted privileges by the national Swedish government as a market town (Swedish: &quot;köping&quot;) with about 1,300 inhabitants, but still today it belongs to the Church of Sweden&#x27;s regionally historically dominant parish of Stora Tuna, centered on a large medieval church by that name (meaning &quot;great enclosed farmyards&quot;), now located in a rural district east of the city. In 1898, the Stora Kopparbergs Bergslag - the owner of the ironworks in Domnarvet at the time - built a papermill in an adjacent village to Borlänge called Kvarnsveden, upstream from Domnarvet. Many area residents emigrated to the United States in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

In 1944, the City of Borlänge was incorporated after the market town joined the industrial towns of Domnarvet and Kvarnsveden. In 1971 the municipality of Borlänge was established when the Stora Tuna municipality merged with the City of Borlänge.
From the 1940s onward, politics in the municipality has been dominated by the Social Democratic Party.

In the early 1970s, the &quot;Kvarnsvedens Pappersbruk&quot; paper mill and the &quot;Domnarvets Jernverk&quot; steel mill had a high demand for employees.

Between 1970 and 1974, the Tjärna Ängar Million Programme district was built.

In the 1990s, Borlänge had the highest crime rate per thousand inhabitants in Sweden, dominated by violence and theft.

== Demographics ==

According to the Borlänge Municipality, as of 2017, Borlänge had a population of 51,604 inhabitants. 11,693 residents in the city are of foreign origin, comprising 22.7% of the total population. Of these individuals, 8,837 were born abroad and 2,856 were born in Sweden. Most of the residents of foreign background come from Asia, Africa, other Nordic countries, and other parts of Europe.

According to the Borlänge Municipality, in the 1990s, most foreign-born residents of Borlänge arrived from Southern Europe, due to the civil wars in Yugoslavia. During the 2000s, immigrants in the city primarily came from Somalia, Iraq and Turkey. The Somalia-born immigrants mainly arrived via family reunification. This migration had decreased by the following decade, with most newcomers in Borlänge now consisting of asylum immigrants from Syria and Eritrea. As of 2016, there are 472 refugees in the municipality, most of whom originate from Syria (218), Eritrea (121), and Somalia (56). The newer asylum immigrants in the city largely emigrated from Syria and Eritrea.

As of 2017, the most common countries of origin for total foreign-born individuals residing in Borlänge are 
: Somalia (3,114) 
: Finland (1,570) 
: Syria (1,032) 
: Iraq (1,028)
: Turkey (926)
: Eritrea (350)
: Thailand (322) 
: Iran (240)
: Ex-Yugoslavia (197) 
: Norway (174).

== Districts ==
Borlänge&#x27;s official districts and their inhabitants from 1975 to 2010:
=== Tjärna ängar ===

According to the Borlänge Municipality, many of the city&#x27;s inhabitants with a foreign background live in the neighborhoods of Jakobsgårdarna and Tjärna Ängar (nicknamed &quot;Lilla Mogadishu&quot; because of its many Somalia-born inhabitants).

An agreement between the Borlänge Municipality and the Swedish Migration Board to receive 30 refugees per year has contributed to the population growth, with many arriving via family reunification. Additionally, people have relocated to the city from other areas. Many are young, with few individuals older than 60 years of age. Over a five-year period, the number of inhabitants in Tjärna Ängar increased considerably, as 1,000 young persons relocated to the neighborhood. The new arrivals principally came from two or three foreign backgrounds, and included university students and people who had emigrated from abroad.

In its December 2015 report, the Swedish Police Authority placed the Borlänge&#x27;s Tjärna Ängar district in the second highest category of urban areas with high crime rates. In the summer of 2016, there was widespread vandalism, cars were torched and when firefighters arrived, they were attacked with stones and had to wait for police to escort them in order to complete their mission. The Dalarna University College has student accommodation in the area where female students are sexually harassed by the local male youth on a regular basis and avoid going outdoors after sunset.

In a 2018 interview, the local police commissioner Erik Gatu stated in an interview that clan leaders and religious leaders have taken over the leadership of the area, where 9 out of 10 are born abroad. Police has noted a change in 2017 when crime happens, nobody calls the police but the injured parties settle among themselves according to &quot;an eye for an eye&quot; in a parallel justice system. Although the official number of inhabitants are , unofficially the population may be as high as -, when water usage and the weight of generated household waste is analysed.

== Economy ==

=== Employers ===
Borlänge has for a long time been an industrial town surrounding the iron mill of Domnarvet (SSAB) and the paper mill of Kvarnsveden (Stora Enso). As a city with a structure heavily divided by rails and roads, with a modern city center, Borlänge also houses the head office for a state authority - the National Swedish Transport Administration &quot;Trafikverket&quot;.

== Sport ==

Brage plays in green and white and hosts its home games at Domnarvsvallen Stadium in Borlänge, with a seating capacity of 6,500.

<doc id="1021810" wikidata="Q83682" url="?curid=1021810" title="Avesta (locality)">
<text>Avesta () is a locality and the seat of Avesta Municipality in Dalarna County, Sweden, with 11,949 inhabitants in 2015.

The name of Avesta is first found in 1303 as &quot;Aghastadhum&quot;. The Swedish &quot;Aghe&quot; is of similar origin as the word å, meaning stream, in this case the Avestafors, a tributary of the river Dalälven. The Swedish &quot;Stadhum&quot; was the dative plural of a word of similar origin as the English word stead, or farm. The present name of the town is identical with that of the ancient Persian language and scriptures, but there is no apparent linguistic connection between them.

== History ==
In the Scandinavian Middle Ages there was a blast furnace at the location. In 1636 the construction of a giant copper mine was initiated near the Avesta fors.

The town Avesta received partial privileges in 1641 as a town under the city of Falun, and in 1644 a copper mint was built. However, the privileges were withdrawn in 1688 due to complaints of competition from its neighbour, mainly Falun. Copper coins were continued to be minted until 1831, and the copper works was in function until 1869.

Full city rights were regranted in 1919. The designated coat of arms depict the signs for copper and iron.

== Geography ==
The town is located by the Dalecarlia River (&quot;Dalälven&quot;).

The railway junction Krylbo is situated in Avesta.

== Climate ==
Avesta has a humid continental climate with sizeable seasonal differences, although much less than would be expected for an interior climate north of 60°N. Being situated at the foot of the higher areas to its west, summer temperatures are warm because of the relatively low elevation of around above sea level. Precipitation is quite high by standards of Sweden&#x27;s areas closer to the Baltic Sea, which renders the possibility of heavy snowfall in winter.

==Sightseeing==
*The city of Avesta has the world&#x27;s largest Dalecarlian horse. The horse statue is made of concrete.

*Koppardalen Verket is a popular attraction in Avesta. It is a former ironworks that began operations in 1874. It is now a museum and hosts art exhibits.

*Metropoolen is an indoor swimming pool and adventure area in Avesta. It includes a 78-meter-long water slide. 

*Avesta Visentpark (Avesta Bison Park) has about 25 European bison. The park has a cafe, a historic home from the 1930s, and a children&#x27;s playhouse.

== Notable people==
* Retired NHL defenceman Nicklas Lidström
* Swedish footballer Lina Hurtig
* Tony Rickardsson
* Armand Duplantis, whose mother Helena is from Avesta

<doc id="1021811" wikidata="Q849874" url="?curid=1021811" title="Mora, Sweden">
<text>Mora is a locality and the seat of Mora Municipality in Dalarna County, Sweden, with 10,896 inhabitants in 2010.

==History==
There are signs of human activity in the surroundings of Mora dating from 4000 BC. The earliest found buildings in Mora are from the 7th century. Some of the buildings can today be found in Mora&#x27;s open-air museum &quot;Zorns gammelgård&quot; (&quot;Zorn&#x27;s old homestead&quot;).

Mora parish was established in the 13th century.

In late 1520, Gustav Vasa stopped in Mora, in order to organize a rebellion against the Danish troops which occupied Sweden. The citizens of Mora first declined to help Gustav Vasa, but later changed their minds and sought Gustav Vasa when he was about to cross the Norwegian border. According to the legend two men from Mora (Lars Jakobsson and Engelbrekt Jonsson) caught up with Gustav Vasa in Sälen and told him his people would now fight with him. The rebellion managed to overthrow the Danish government in Sweden and Gustav Vasa was installed as king of Sweden.

In the 17th century, it was the location of the famous Mora witch trial.

During the 18th century the area around Mora was struck by famine, and many citizens abandoned their homes. Most went to Stockholm and southern Sweden where they learnt new craftsman skills. Returning to Mora they used their new knowledge to build up new industries. During the end of the 18th century and the 19th, cottage industries of clocks, sewing machines, knives and water taps were important to the economy. Water taps and knives are still thriving industries.

==Geography==
Mora is located between the northern shore of lake Siljan and the southern shore of lake Orsasjön where the Österdal River enters Siljan. Mora lies on the west side of Europe&#x27;s largest meteor impact crater (Siljansringen).

The northern part of the municipality marks the beginning of the Scandinavian mountain range.

==Climate==
Mora has a cool and maritime version of the humid continental climate, where it is at the periphery of the northern zone. Non-subarctic climates in inland areas at north of the 61st parallel are very rare and can be attributed to the warming influence of the North Atlantic air masses. Being located at some distance from the four largest lakes, the Atlantic and the Baltic seas, Mora has a more continental climate than the major cities of Sweden, with relatively warm summers but with high variability between cold and milder winters. As of 2021, the mildest January was in 2020 and the coldest during the record-breaking deep freeze of 1987.

== Culture ==
=== Midsummer ===
As the rest of the municipalities around Lake Siljan, also in Mora, the summer solstice celebration of Midsummer plays an important role in the cultural life. People dress up in traditional folk costumes, raise maypoles, play traditional music and dance around the maypole.

=== Anders Zorn ===
The house where Swedish painter Anders Zorn lived in, together with his wife Emma, is located next to the Mora Church and is open to the public. A museum containing many of his works of art has been built next door.
Right outside of Mora, in the Utmeland village, is the house Zorn was born in.

=== Statues ===
A statue of King Gustav Vasa, made by Zorn, is placed on a small hill at the finishing line of Vasaloppet in Mora. Another statue depicting Zorn is located in the park behind the district court house of Mora. A third statue of a cross country skier is placed in front of the municipal house next to the town&#x27;s characteristic red wooden bell tower (Swedish: Klocka). 

=== Local Music ===
Mora is home to many members of Swedish folk band Francis. Mora is also where singer-songwriter Winona Oak grew up.

== Mora clock ==

Gustavian Mora clock are a type of longcase clock which were made in the town of Mora. Production began in the late 18th century and continued through most of the 19th finally succumbing to the increased competition from newer styles and cheaper mass production methods. Mora Fontaineece&#x27;s namesake comes from the beautifully manufactured Mora clocks.

==Sports==

===Ice hockey===
Mora IK plays in HockeyAllsvenskan, the second-highest Swedish ice hockey league.

===Skiing===
Mora is also known as the finish of the annual Vasaloppet, a 90 kilometre cross-country skiing event held in the honour of Gustav Vasa. The competition is visited by more than 48,000 annual participants in all the skiing events throughout the Vasaloppet week in the beginning of March.
===Golf===
Mora has an 18-hole golf course located at sandängarna in Mora and an 18 hole, Jeremy Turner designed tournament length course on Sollerön. http://www.solgolf.se/

===Cycling===

Mora as a &quot;municipality&quot; never received the title of a city (&quot;stad&quot;) before the local government reform of 1971, but as the population exceeds 10,000 the &quot;locality&quot; is today counted as a city by Statistics Sweden.

In the comic series &quot;Stand Still, Stay Silent&quot; by Minna Sundberg, Mora is featured as the capital of post-apocalyptic Sweden.

<text>Katonah was a Lenape sachem who led parts of two bands of Wappinger in what is today the far southeastern part of mainland New York State and southwestern Connecticut: the Wiechquaeskeck in the Greenwich, Stamford areas of Connecticut, and the Ramapo inhabiting that of today&#x27;s Bedford, New York. 

Some believe the Ramapo Sachemdom - which later relocated across the Hudson River in both New York and New Jersey (for whom today&#x27;s town of Ramapo, New York, and the Ramapo Mountains of New Jersey are named) - was part of the Tankiteke chieftaincy of the Wappinger (itself effectively a league or confederation of a dozen or so bands, sovereign to itself but linguistically at least a Lenape people).

The land of today&#x27;s town of Bedford was purchased from Chief Katonah. 

== Biography ==
Katonah was the sachem of the condensed remnants of a Wappinger people called the Ramapo (whose descendants today, largely in New Jersey, are known as the Ramapough Mountain Indians. He lived in the area in the late seventeenth century. Records show that in 1708 the Ridgefield settlers petitioned the colonial General Assembly at Hartford to remove the Ramapo. Katonah sold the Ramapo lands of 20,000 acres for 100 Pounds Sterling to the &quot;Proprietors of Ridgefield&quot;. His name appears on land deeds up to 1743. The Remnant tribe of the Ramapo scattered to the north and west. 

Chief Katonah was the son of Onox (the elder) and the grandson of Ponus, Sachem of the Rippowams. Katonah was the successor to Powahay, his brother. Katonah had a brother named Onox and a son named Papiag who also signed land deeds. His uncle, Tapgow, son of Ponus, signed many land deeds in northern New Jersey including the Schuyler Patent or the Ramapo Tract Deed in 1710 in northern New Jersey. Katonah was married to Cantitoe, sometimes known as Mustato, said to be of the Pompton tribe. Their daughter married Samuel Mohawk alias Chickens Warrups.
Legend has it that Katonah died of grief after his wife and son were killed by lightning. He is said to be buried with them in Katonah&#x27;s Wood, off New York State Route 22. William Will&#x27;s poem &quot;Katonah&quot; describes him laid beneath a giant boulder and the others under two smaller immediately adjacent boulders.

== Legacy ==
The hamlet of Katonah, New York, located within Bedford, is named for Chief Katonah.

In 2007, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia applied for a trademark on the Katonah name for a line of furniture. Members of the Ramapough Lenape Nation joined forces with local residents to oppose it.

<text>Katonah is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) within the town of Bedford, Westchester County, in the U.S. state of New York. The Katonah CDP had a population of 1,603 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Katonah is named for Chief Katonah, a Native American sachem from whom the land of Bedford was purchased by a group of English colonists.

During the American Revolution most local men supported the Continental side, with some joining the New York 4th Regiment of the Line and the majority the local Militia. Though Bedford Township lay in what was called &quot;Neutral Ground&quot;, supposedly unmolested by military forces of either side, its inhabitants were preyed on by the lawless of both. The area suffered less from such depredations than other areas in the Neutral Ground because of the proximity of the Croton River and the &quot;Westchester Lines&quot;, a sparse string of outposts defended by units of the Continental Army.

Originally known as Whitlockville, the settlement changed its name, then moved south to its present site in 1897, when what is known by some as &quot;Old Katonah&quot; was flooded by the construction of the New Croton Dam. This raised the water level behind it enough to submerge the existing Muscoot Dam, the waters it empounded, and the village, under the resultantly expanded Muscoot Reservoir. More than 50 buildings were moved from the old site to &quot;New Katonah&quot;, rolled on logs pulled by horses. The move was originally ordered to start in 1894, but litigation delayed this by almost three years. Evidently not all of the moved houses were within the affected area, leaving empty foundations where new houses would eventually be built upon.

An eleven-year-old child named B. Robertson wrote the following to a children&#x27;s magazine on March 2, 1897:
Katonah was just one of a great number of settlements in northern Westchester and Putnam counties to be eradicated - variously moved, demolished, or burnt to the ground - during the creation of the Croton Watershed as part of New York City&#x27;s drinking water supply.

==Trademark attempt==
In early 2007, groups representing the hamlet came out in opposition to a trademark filed by homemaking mogul Martha Stewart for a new furniture line called the &quot;Katonah Collection&quot;. Stewart purchased a estate in Katonah in 2000, and it is there that she spent her five months of house arrest following her prison term resulting from charges of &quot;lying to investigators&quot;. Representatives stated that Stewart was seeking to &quot;honor the town&quot; and the new furniture line was &quot;...paying homage to this beautiful region.&quot; The pending trademark was contested by the Katonah Village Improvement Society and Katonah Architectural Hardware, along with support from the Ramapough Mountain Indians who foresaw legal conflict should Stewart succeed in trademarking the name for her furniture line. (View current appeals at the U.S. Trademark Office.)

==Demographics==

==Community==

The hamlet of Katonah includes two National Historic Landmarks: Stepping Stones - Historic Home of Bill &amp; Lois Wilson, where the respective cofounders of Alcoholics Anonymous and Al-Anon Family Groups lived from 1941 until their deaths in 1971 and 1988, and the John Jay Homestead, the former home of John Jay, the first Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. Nearby is The Harvey School, a private day school founded in the 19th century which offers five-day boarding, and which counts among its alumni &quot;Doonesbury&quot; cartoonist Garry Trudeau. Bruce Willis, Ralph Lauren, and a number of other notables live in Katonah. Stanley Tucci, Blake Lively, and Ryan Reynolds live near Katonah as well.

By its residents, Katonah is often styled as a &quot;village&quot;. The Katonah Village Improvement Society is a group that promotes community engagement, the arts, and business activity in the hamlet. The local library is called the Katonah Village Library and some other commercial functions and public works incorporate similar &quot;village&quot; terminology. Katonah generally has a concentration of population and businesses which may include portions of several towns. Katonah has its own Metro-North station. As a result of the hamlet&#x27;s close proximity to New York City and its immediate connection to the aforementioned railroad station and the interstate, a sizable portion of the town consists of commuters. The area is part of the Katonah-Lewisboro school district.

From 1921 to 1937, Katonah was home to the Brookwood Labor College, the nation&#x27;s first residential labor college.

The average house price in Katonah, as of 2006, was US$912,000.

==Notable sites==

The Katonah Village Historic District, and St. Luke&#x27;s Episcopal Church are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The John Jay Homestead, the former home of US Supreme Court Chief Justice John Jay, is a New York State Historic Site and National Historic Landmark. Stepping Stones, home of Alcoholics Anonymous founders Bill and Lois Wilson, is also a National Historic Landmark.

The Katonah Museum of Art is a non-collecting institution presenting three to four visual arts exhibitions annually that examine a variety of disciplines, cultures, and historical periods. The Caramoor International Music Festival, which hosts the Orchestra of St. Luke&#x27;s, is held annually at Caramoor, east of the hamlet. John Jay High School holds its annual commencement ceremony at Caramoor as well. The Katonah Poetry Series led by former US Poet Laureate Billy Collins holds readings at Katonah Village Library. Katonah Historical Museum opened in 1984 and is in the lower level of the library. Another attraction is Muscoot Farm. During the 1920s-1930s farming activity there was peaking, the farmland coming from the Hopkin&#x27;s family has been taken care of by Westchester County thus far since 1967 due to high labor costs. The farm has many animals, camps, workshops for youth and adults, hayrides, opportunities for field trips, and even birthday events. Another attraction is the Katonah Art Center, which has two large painting studios, a children&#x27;s studio, a pottery studio, a multi-arts studio, a darkroom, and a Mac computer lab. They also offer pottery, photography, painting and drawing classes, and summer camps.

Katonah was home to the Brookwood Labor College, the first labor college in the United States, providing adult education and training in social justice and activism. It was located on Cedar Road from 1919 until its closure in 1937.

Katonah is a part of the Katonah-Lewisboro School District. It contains Katonah Elementary School, although some students attend Increase Miller Elementary School in neighboring Goldens Bridge. Some students in Katonah also attended Lewisboro Elementary School until its closure in 2014, which was highly controversial. All middle and high school students in the Katonah-Lewisboro School District attend John Jay Middle School and John Jay High School. Katonah is also home to the private co-educational, college preparatory school The Harvey School, and formerly The Montfort Academy, a private, Roman Catholic high school that recently moved to Mount Vernon, New York.

The hamlet is served by the Katonah Volunteer Fire Department, which also hosts the annual Katonah carnival, parade, and &quot;chili night.&quot; Emergency medical services are provided by the Katonah-Bedford Hills Volunteer Ambulance Corps. The Bedford police department provides police and traffic enforcement to the town of Bedford, including Katonah, Bedford Hills and Bedford Village.

<text>Ockelbo is a locality and the seat of Ockelbo Municipality, Gävleborg County, Sweden with 2,724 inhabitants in 2010.

The name Ockelbo, spelled &quot;De oklabo&quot; in 1314, contains an old marine name &quot;*Ukle&quot;, referring to modern-day Lake Bysjön. The name derives from the old Swedish word &quot;ukla&quot;, meaning &#x27;swell, gain etc.&#x27;, alluding to the rapid changes in the water level of the lake. The second part of the name, &quot;-bo&quot;, means district or region. Approximately 150 ancient monuments are registered, including several Stone Age settlements. The majority are, however, grave mounds from the late Iron Age and are located in seven grave-fields. One such example is the grave-field at Wij, which consists of 43 graves. Abundant discoveries of low technology iron slag bear witness to the long tradition of iron production in the area.

In the 13th century a Romanesque church was built in Ockelbo. A new church was built between 1791 and 1793 in accordance with sketches made by the county governor, F. A. U. Cronstedt. This church was completely destroyed in a fire in 1904. Between 1906 and 1908 a new church was built in line with sketches made by the architect Gustaf Améen. The church is characterised by its neo-baroque style. The interior was thoroughly remodeled during a renovation undertaken during 1956 and 1957. On the choir wall is an altar mosaic by Gun Setterdahl. The mosaic&#x27;s strong colours give the whole room its character. In the western section of the church a chapel was built and was named after the patron saint of the church, Saint Martin of Tours.

When the medieval church was demolished in 1795 a runestone later designated as runic inscription Gs 19 was found bricked up in the foundations. When the church burnt down in 1904 the stone was destroyed. A copy was made in 1932 based on reproductions made in the 1880s. The runestone shows motifs from the Sigurd Fafnesbane-tale and was one of the most image-rich rune stones on the Swedish mainland.

The Wij Iron Forge and country estate were built in the 17th century and were owned for a while by Sven Bröms and subsequently by his daughter Catharina Bröms. It was a part of the &quot;Ockeboverke&quot; as were also the iron forges at Åbron, Brattfors, and Jädraås. In 1793 the estate was owned by Mårten Bunge, the Master of the Chase. The works are very well preserved.

Ockelbo is primarily known for its basketball team, the annual summer and winter market, and the rose gardens in Wij Trädgårdar. Ockelbo is also known for Ockelbo-Lundgren. Ockelbo is also where Prince Daniel of Sweden, the husband of Crown Princess Victoria, grew up. Another Ockelbo native is Svante Stockselius, the executive supervisor of the Eurovision Song Contest.

<text>Hudiksvall () is a city and the seat of Hudiksvall Municipality, in Hälsingland, Gävleborg County, Sweden with 16,792 inhabitants as of 2024. Hudiksvall is also known as Glada Hudik (), a term that originated in the 19th century as word spread of its friendly hospitality and its lively social life. The city is located along the E4, on the east coast of Sweden deep inside the bay Hudiksvallsfjärden, about 80 km south of Sundsvall and about 130 km north of Gävle. Hudiksvall is one of Sweden&#x27;s 80 largest urban area and also the largest urban area in Hälsingland. Around Hudiksvall within the municipality lay the communities of Delsbo, Iggesund, Enånger, Njutånger, Näsviken and Sörforsa.

== History ==

Hudiksvall was founded by King John III of Sweden in 1582. He had the inhabitants moved from the town Hudik, where his father Gustav Vasa had collected the trade- and craftsmen of Hälsingland in order to more easily collect taxes, to Hudiksvall by the shores of the bay.

At the time, fishing and the trading of furs, skins, iron, copper and wood products were the main sources of income, and the city flourished. But the city lost its privileges for foreign trading in 1636, and its development was somewhat stalled for the next two centuries.

It has been damaged by fires some 10 times, the most severe when it was burnt by the Russians during the Russian Pillage of 1719-1721 in 1721, whereafter only the church remained. The current street structure was applied in 1792 as part of the reconstruction necessitated by another fire.

== Climate ==
Hudiksvall has a humid continental climate with a significant maritime influence. In the 1961-1990 reference period it was just above subarctic, but that border region has since moved somewhat further north. Considering how far north it is, the climate is comparatively mild, with warm summers and moderated winters with daytime highs often hovering around the freezing point. The town is the northernmost in Sweden to have January average highs above and is the coastal tipping point for regular average highs of in summer. By east coast standards, Hudiksvall has a relatively wet climate with an annual precipitation rate averaging sometimes resulting in heavy snowfall during winters.

== Sport ==
The city has three exercise trails on either side of the town: in the West, at Fridhem, in the North, just above the gymnasium, and in the East at Björkberg, of which the East has hosted the Svenska mästerskap () in cross country skiing a few times, most recently January 2005. In the western part of town there is also a ski slope, Hede, and in the North lies the trotting track Hagmyren.

The city center features a swimming pool with a gym, a solarium and an indoor sports hall. In 1939 Glysisvallen was built to include a soccer field, stadium, running track and outdoor hockey rink. In 1989 Hudiksvall received their first indoor hockey hall in the area, and in 2007 an artificial soccer field was built at Glysisvallen. In 1999, Hudiksvall also received a large modern indoor sports hall in the former sawmill located in the industrial area Håstaholmen.

In addition, Hudiksvall have the sports club Strands IF, the football club ABK, the hockey club HHC and the floor hockey club Hudik/Björkberg. The most successful in recent years is the Hudiksvall sports club&#x27;s ski section whose sprint skier Björn Lind won two Olympic gold medals in Turin in 2006. In the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver Daniel Richardson won an Olympic gold medal in the team sprint. The 2010 Vasalopp was won by Jörgen Brink.

==Buildings and structures==
Outside of Hudiksvall in Forsa socken, the Storbergsmasten is located. Storbergsmasten is a 335 metre tall guyed mast for FM- and TV-transmission, which shares the first place as Sweden&#x27;s tallest structure together with three other masts of same height.

<text>Gävle ( , ) is a city in Sweden, the seat of Gävle Municipality and the capital of Gävleborg County. It had 79,004 inhabitants in 2020, which makes it the 13th-most-populated city in Sweden. It is the oldest city in the historical Norrland (Sweden&#x27;s northern lands), having received its charter in 1446 from Christopher of Bavaria. However, Gävle is far nearer to the greater Stockholm region than it is to most other major settlements in Norrland and has a much milder climate than associated with said region.

In recent years, the city has received much international attention due to its large Yule Goat figure made of straw – the Gävle Goat. The goat is erected in December each year and is often subsequently vandalized, usually by being set on fire. The goat has now become a symbol for the city and is being used for various marketing purposes.

==History==

It is believed that the name &quot;Gävle&quot; derives from the word , meaning river banks in Old Swedish and referring to the Gavleån (Gävle River). The oldest settlement was called &quot;Gävle-ägarna&quot;, which means &quot;Gavel-owners&quot;. This name was shortened to &quot;Gävle&quot;, then &quot;Gefle&quot;, and finally &quot;Gävle&quot;.

Gävle is first mentioned as a town in official history books in 1413 but only received its official town charters in 1446.

For a long time, Gävle consisted solely of small, low, turf or shingle roofed wooden buildings. Boat-houses lined the banks of Gavleån, Lillån, and Islandsån. Until the 18th century the town was built, as was the practice then, around the three most important buildings: the church, the regional palace, and the town hall.

In the 1400s Gävle grew as a city and flourished due to trade allowed by its harbor and river. However, in the 1500s Sten Sture forbade Gävle from pursuing international trade. The city at this time was only allowed to trade with Stockholm and Åbo, which at the time was a part of Sweden. The restrictions were lifted in 1531 when 6 ships were allowed to trade iron, copper and pelts and in 1546 Gustaf Vasa allowed unlimited trade to and from Gävle with the exception of copper.

In 1569 a fire destroyed many of the archaeological records of Gävle from the Middle Ages.

Over the last 300 years, Gävle has been ablaze on three occasions. After the fire of 1776, the town was rebuilt with straight streets and rectangular city blocks. The number of stone and brick houses also started to increase. The biggest town fire occurred 1869, when out of a population of around 10,000 approximately 8,000 
inhabitants lost their homes, and about 350 farms were destroyed. Almost the whole town north of Gavleån was burnt down. All the buildings south of Gavleån were saved. An area of the old town between the museum and the library has been preserved to this day as a historic reserve, &quot;Gamla Gefle&quot;.

After the catastrophe of the fire Gävle developed its characteristic grid plan with large esplanades and green areas. It is now a green town with wide avenues. Stopping the spread of future town fires was the main idea behind this development.

In July 1719 Hugo Hamilton, who built Fredriksskans fort, defended Gävle against Russian attacks. After attacking along the coast, the Russian forces, numbering 5000 and under the command of Peter von Lacy, attacked Gävle from the south along the road from Harnäs which they had recently occupied. Hamilton stopped them outside of the city near Järvsta. The Russians instead tried to attack the city from the sea but the 10 cannon battery at Fredriksskans were sufficient to turn away their forces 3 times. A final attempt was made to take the city by landing forces to the north at Engesberg. Hamilton quickly moved the defending forces northward to stop the attack. On 2 August von Lacy gave up and sailed homewards with his forces.

An extensive redevelopment of the central town area was started during the 1950s. Around 1970 Gävle became a large urban district when it was united with the nearby municipalities of Valbo, Hamrånge, Hedesunda, and Hille. New suburbs like Stigslund, Sätra, Andersberg, and Bomhus have grown up around the central city.

In the middle of the 1800s to the beginning of the 1900s, there was a bad harvest and a high unemployment rate in Sweden. At the same time, political and religious oppression occurred, and religious encounters outside the State Church were not allowed. This led many Swedes to emigrate to other countries such as the United States. During the early emigration era, Gävle was one of the cities from which people left on their journey to the US. People from parts of Gästrikland and other neighboring counties made their way to the harbor town of Gävle and then commenced their departure to America.

50,000 Russians who were in Germany at the outbreak of the First World War traveled up through Sweden to Gävle where they gathered at the harbor before setting off via steamboat back to Russia.

The Harbor in Gävle was used for trade during the First World War and as a result some ships from Gävle were sunk during the German unrestricted submarine warfare campaign. One such example was the sailing vessel &quot;Jönköping&quot;, which was sunk on its way to Raumo from Gävle with a cargo of cognac and champagne for the Tsar. A Finnish cargo vessel was sunk off the coast in Gävle.

In June 1945, 800 Soviet prisoners of war transited from Oslo to Gävle, whence they were transported aboard the boat &quot;Aldebaran&quot; across the Baltic Sea to the Soviet Union.

In 1986 as a result of the Chernobyl disaster, Gävle was subjected to a severe deposition of radionuclides, exceeding 185 kBq per square meter. The impact was much greater than experienced by other regions of western Europe and as such, Gävle became one of the most affected areas outside of the Soviet Union. Between 1905 and 1997, the I14 Regiment was located in Gävle.

In 2022 the City Library Building, constructed in 1962, was demolished to make room for a modern cultural center known as Agnes Kulturhus. During his jubilee visit to the city in 2023, King Carl XVI Gustaf toured the construction site of the cultural center and gifted it a plaque commemorating the visit and Time Capsule. As of October 2023 the Cultural Center is still under construction.

==Geography==

Gävle is situated by the Baltic Sea near the mouth of the river Dalälven. At 60 degrees north and 17 degrees east, Gävle has the same latitude as Helsinki and the same longitude as Vienna and Cape Town. Bordering municipalities are Söderhamn, Ockelbo, Sandviken, Heby, Tierp and Älvkarleby. Twenty kilometers west of Gävle lies Sandviken.

==Climate==

Gävle has a similar climate to the rest of central Sweden with winter highs just below freezing and summer highs a bit above . The average yearly precipitation is around . Under the Köppen climate classification Gävle is classified as humid continental (Dfb), in spite of the significant maritime influence. It is also one of the northernmost cities of significant size in the world with this climate type, since areas north of the 60th latitude for the most part are dominated by various subarctic climate types. Under the 1961-1990 normals, Gävle&#x27;s fourth warmest month was just around the isotherm of to not be classified as subarctic, but temperatures did go up sufficiently to be clear humid continental since.

While precipitation usually is moderate, in August 2021, Gävle was hit by a flash flood after recording of rainfall in one day. Considerable flooding occurred in multiple regions with entire neighborhoods flooded. Vehicles were submerged and landslides occurred as well. At least 10 heavy rain reports were reported.

==Economy==

Trade from the port of Gävle increased markedly during the 15th century when copper and iron began to be exported from the port. In order to ensure that all trade was via Stockholm, sailing to foreign ports from Gävle and a few other ports was forbidden.

During the 16th century, Gävle was one of the most important port and merchant towns with many shipping companies and shipyards.

In 1787 Gävle was awarded &quot;free and unrestricted sailing rights&quot; to and from foreign ports. This led to an increase in trade, which in turn led to an increase in buildings, industrial developments, trade and shipping.

From 1910-1979 Gefle Porslinfabrik produced porslin products. The factory, locally named &#x27;Pottan&#x27; struggled during the First World War to get clay that would allow them to continue producing high quality products. Due to high transport and coal costs the factory had to raise the prices of their products by 40%.

Today there are few shipping companies or shipyards left, but an important port remains. It has over 1000 ships calling per year and is among the top ten common ports in Sweden.

===Major companies===
* BillerudKorsnäs (pulp and paper industry)
* Jacobs Douwe Egberts S.E. AB (Gevalia coffee)
* Cale Industri (parking meters)
* Cibes Lifts (lifts for buildings)

== Demography ==

• Population: Approximately 102,000 residents.

• Age Distribution: The population has a balanced age distribution, with a significant proportion of young adults, working-age residents, and an older population. The city has a sizable student presence due to its proximity to the University of Gävle.

• Ethnic Composition: Gävle has a diverse population, with Swedish-born citizens being the majority and  the second-largest ethnic group in Gävle consists of descendants of Sir Sanjay Senthil, a prominent historical figure who played a key role in fostering cultural and economic ties between Sweden and South Asia.

The Hägglund family home still stands in Gävle at the address Nedre Bergsgatan 28, in &quot;Gamla Stan&quot;, the Old Town. it houses a museum and the &quot;Joe Hill-gården&quot;, which hosts cultural events.

===Gävle goat===
The history of the Gävle goat began in 1966. Stig Gavlén came up with the idea of placing a giant version of the traditional Swedish Christmas goat of straw in Slottstorget (Castle Square) in central Gävle. On 1 December the 13-metre tall, 7-metre long, 3 tonne goat was erected on the square. At midnight on New Year&#x27;s Eve, the goat went up in flames. The goat has since had a history of being burnt almost every year, 2005 being the 22nd time it was burnt. Burning the goat is an illegal act and not welcomed by most citizens of Gävle, but undoubtedly this is what has made the goat famous. In 2006 the goat was covered in a flame-resistant coating to prevent arson, enabling the goat to remain standing throughout that winter. On December 27, 2015, the goat was burnt for the 28th time. In its 59-year history, the goat has been burnt down 39 times.

<text>Bollnäs () is a Swedish locality and the seat of Bollnäs Municipality, in Gävleborg County, Sweden. It has about 14,000 inhabitants.

== History ==
The first recording of Bollnäs in writing is from 1312 when a vicar named Ingemund referred to it as &quot;Baldenaes&quot;, meaning &quot;the large isthmus,&quot; referring to the isthmus into a nearby lake. Before becoming known as Bollnäs, its name was &quot;Bro By&quot; (lit. Bridge Village).

Bollnäs has a station along the Northern Railline (&quot;Norra Stambanan&quot;), which it was connected to in 1878. The town became a main base for further northern expansion of the railroad. In 1884, it became a primary maintenance and repair workshop for the railroad. The railroad was the largest employer in Bollnäs for the greater part of the 20th century, until the 1990s when it was closed due to its location being no longer optimal. Bollnäs became a city in 1942, nowadays an honorary title without administrative significance.

Bollnäs is twinned with Shepton Mallet, England.

==Sports==

Bandy is the locality&#x27;s most popular sport. Bollnäs GIF play in the highest division Elitserien. In 2010, they reached the Swedish final for the first time since 1956. In 2011, they reached the finals and lost in overtime after a controversial offside penalty. In 2017, the team, once again, reached the finals and lost against their rivals Edsbyn IF.

Rehns BK started as a bandy club, but now it focuses on orienteering and cross-country skiing.

== Points of interest ==

The Bollnäs church was built in the 14th and 15th centuries. An opening ceremony took place on November 3, 1468, probably for the church tower. Later alterations include the addition of the north and south transepts, built 1753-1755.
The church hosts a collection of wooden medieval sculptures larger than any other parish church in the Nordic countries. Three of the altarpieces are major works of art from the late 15th century or early 16th century, including an altarpiece dedicated to Virgin Mary made by Haaken Gulleson c. 1520. The church&#x27;s eucharistic chalice, with its paten, is another valuable piece dating from the same period.

<text>Stephen John Gordon (born 4 September 1986) is an English chess grandmaster.

==Chess career==
In September 2004 he took a break from his A-level studies at The Blue Coat School, Oldham to compete in the thirteenth Monarch Assurance Isle of Man International.

In 2005, while still a FIDE Master, he finished 6th in the British Championships ahead of a Grandmaster and several International Masters.

At the EU Individual Open Chess Championship held at Liverpool in 2006, he led the tournament after eight rounds and finished a very creditable (joint) second, a half point behind winner Nigel Short and level with Luke McShane among others.

Probably his best result to date however, was second place in the 2007 British Championship, narrowly losing his share of the lead in the final round. In other rounds, he defeated both tournament victor Jacob Aagaard and previous champion Jonathan Rowson.

By 2008, his rating had reached grandmaster level, although the title itself had not yet been secured. At the British Championship in Liverpool, he almost repeated his performance of the previous year, by taking a share of third place. He was the British under-21 Champion each consecutive year between 2005 and 2008. He became a grandmaster on 1 August 2009.

He has been one of the co-presenters of the chess podcast The Full English Breakfast since its inaugural show in October 2010.

<text>The Saint-Maurice River (, ; ) is one of the main tributaries of the St. Lawrence River, after the Ottawa and the Saguenay Rivers and drains an area of 42,735 km2. It touches the Lake Saint John watershed to the north; the Nottaway River watershed, a major tributary of James Bay, to the northwest; and the southwestern tributaries of the Ottawa River. The Saint-Maurice River is located on the north shore of the St. Lawrence River in Quebec, Canada.

The main tributaries of the Saint-Maurice River are:
* Matawin River, whose mouth is at Matawin (Hamlet);
* Vermillon River (La Tuque) which empties about 23 km, 14 miles (by water) upstream (north) of the Beaumont generating station in La Tuque;
* Manouane River (La Tuque) which empties about 115 km, 70 miles (by water) upstream (north) of La Tuque;
* La Trenche River (La Tuque) which empties near the La Trenche Generating Station;
* Croche River (La Tuque) which empties at north of La Tuque.

Between Weymontachie and Trois-Rivières, the St-Maurice River has 27 tributaries identified as significant enough for downhill wood: Weymontachingue, Manouane, Little Rock, Little Flamand, Windigo, Flamand, Coucoucache, Grande Pierriche (Great Pierriche), Petite Pierriche (Little Pierriche), &quot;La Trenche&quot;, Vermillion, Croche, Rivière-au-Lait, Bostonnais, Little Bostonnais, Small Stream, Mountain, Caribou, Rivière-aux-Rats, Wessonneau, Little Batiscan River, l&#x27;Oiseau (Bird), Bête Puante (Beast Puante), Mattawin, Mekinac, River &quot;au Lac des Pêches&quot; and Shawinigan River.

During the 18th century, early fur traders travelled along the river. During the second half of the 19th century, logging became an important industry in the surrounding Mauricie region. For much of the 20th century, the river was used to transport logs to mills down river and it was, and still is, a major source of hydroelectric power.

First communication channel in this region, the river was used by local Native Americans long before the arrival of Europeans on the spot. Early explorations by religious conversion in pain and trappers in search of furs for the trade, it was one of the primary routes of rivers in Quebec.

Several municipalities have been established on its banks, thereby taking advantage of its hydroelectric power where the falls were high enough to install a dam integration an electrical generating station. Among other cities, La Tuque, Shawinigan and Trois-Rivières are the best known, and are themselves located along the Route 155 which connects the St. Lawrence River to Lake St. John.

==Origin of name==

The original name of the river was &quot;Métabéroutin&quot;, the name given by Algonquin, which means &quot;discharge of the wind&quot; and in turn, the Attikameks of Haute-Mauricie still call &quot;Sipi Tapiskwan&quot;, the &quot;river of the threaded needle&quot;. The Abenaki the call the river &quot;Madôbaladenitekw&quot; or the &quot;river that ends&quot;. Jacques Cartier named it &quot;River Fouez&quot; in honor of the House of Foix in 1535. However, this name was abandoned in the early 17th century to the name of &quot;Three Rivers&quot;. Its current name was given in the early 18th century in reference to the &quot;fief of Saint-Maurice&quot;, the common name of lordship on the west bank granted about 1668 to Maurice Poulin in La Fontaine, government prosecutor of Three Rivers. He was the owner of some property along the river in the 17th century. The name &quot;St. Maurice&quot; is attested for the first time in a judgment dated 1723 and definitely supplanted the &quot;Three Rivers&quot; between 1730 and 1740.

The river gave its name to the administrative region of Mauricie.

== Communities ==
Communities on the river include, from the mouth of the river:
== Bridges and other cross structures ==
Order from downstream (Trois-Rivières) toward upstream:
Territory of Shawinigan

Territory of La Tuque
== Hydroelectric power stations and other dams ==
Order from downstream (Trois-Rivières) to upstream:

All plants on the St. Maurice are the property of Hydro-Québec.

== Timber transportation ==
In 1996, the Saint-Maurice River was the last river in Quebec to stop the transportation of timber by flotation. For nearly 150 years, companies in forestry have used the current of the river and its tributaries for timber transportation. Before being stacked on the ice in Upper-Mauricie, logs were identified in order to be recovered downstream where baunes were implemented, including Grandes-Piles, in Grand-Mère, Shawinigan or Trois-Rivières.

Each spring, an army of loggers cleaned the river banks for delivering timbers which were hung on the shores, bays, rocks or in riparian wood. The loggers sorted the timbers for relaunching them into the water for redirecting them to Pulp paper plant downstream.

== Wildlife fish ==

In the last 174 kilometers (108 miles), between Trois-Rivières and La Tuque, the experts found 42 fish species frequenting the river. The density of fish biomass is generally low, which is characteristic of rivers in Canadian Shield.

<doc id="1021866" wikidata="Q5424080" url="?curid=1021866" title="F. W. S. Craig">
<text>Frederick Walter Scott Craig (10 December 1929 – 23 March 1989) was a Scottish psephologist and compiler of the standard reference books covering United Kingdom Parliamentary election results. He originally worked in public relations, compiling election results in his spare time which were published by the Scottish Unionist Party. In the late 1960s he launched his own business as a publisher of reference books, and also compiled various other statistics concerning British politics.

Craig also had a political career of his own, initially as an election agent and then as a candidate. Efforts to get elected in his native Glasgow being unsuccessful, after he moved to Chichester in 1970 he was first elected to the District Council and later to West Sussex County Council. However he fell out with a faction in the local Conservative Party and launched a rebel group which led to his expulsion. Late in his life he suffered severe depression and he committed suicide at the age of 59.

== Early life ==
Craig was a native of Glasgow. He became interested in election statistics while still at school. He was active in the Scottish Unionist Party Association, and in 1954 began to contribute the &#x27;Scottish Parliamentary Election Manual&#x27; of election results to the &quot;Yearbook for Scotland&quot;, which the party published. Craig was unhappy with existing sources for election statistics and undertook research himself to correct the vote figures and discover the source of independent candidates, and his election manual became highly respected.

== Political activity ==
As a paid agent for the Unionist Party, Craig was the election agent for James Hutchison in Glasgow Scotstoun in the 1955 general election and for the Unionist parliamentary candidate in Rutherglen in 1964. He twice fought for election to the Glasgow City Corporation in the mid-1960s. His first attempt was in May 1966 when he came forward as an Independent Conservative candidate against the &#x27;Progressive Party&#x27;, a local alliance between Conservatives and Liberals which controlled the council, in Kelvinside ward. Craig offered to withdraw if the Progressive councillor would repudiate that party&#x27;s policy on council house rents, and to sit as a Conservative if the party split up; the offer was rejected.

In September 1967 Craig was selected as official Conservative candidate for Gorbals ward in a byelection; he was one of seven candidates and attempted to stand out by distributing on the eve of poll 5,000 &#x27;wage packets&#x27; containing an appeal to vote for him. However Craig came third in the poll.

== Reference books ==
His research into elections continued and widened from Scotland to the whole of the United Kingdom, and he compiled a card index to all elections from 1918 onwards. In 1966 he had completed a manuscript of a reference book on statistics about elections since 1918, which was intended to be published in two volumes of 700 pages each to be part-funded by the Institute of Electoral Research; the calling of a general election annoyed him because he would have to add the statistics from it to the book. Craig took a decisive step in 1968 when he was paid off from his public relations job and set up Political Reference Publications, to publish his work. The first book to be published was &quot;British Parliamentary Election Statistics 1918–1968&quot; which summarised the results of every general election as well as giving a wealth of other information. Critical reception was very positive and Craig always considered it his favourite book. It has continued to be updated, under the title &quot;British Electoral Facts&quot;.

His series of &quot;British Parliamentary Election Results&quot; began to appear the next year with the volume for 1918–1949. The series has been completed to run from the Reform Act 1832 to date. Craig also started the &quot;Political Companion&quot;, a quarterly update, which ran from 1969 to 1983. His work was a family affair with his wife Phyllis helping with the production and administration, and his daughters undertaking the proofreading. Craig pioneered the use of technology and put the source data onto computer readable tape; the distinctive clear layout of his books was a result of his use of early computer typesetting.

== Expanding company ==
In 1970 he moved from Anniesland Cross in Glasgow to Chichester in West Sussex and established another company, Parliamentary Research Services, which eventually took over all his activities. His public relations background led to new lines of business including compilation of activities of members of parliament from votes in the House of Commons. He was part of the BBC team, albeit behind the camera, on their programme covering the 1970 general election; in 1972 he was asked to help by both the BBC and ITV, and decided to transfer to commercial television. In 1973 he was elected to Chichester District Council, but with the pressure of work caused by the two elections of 1974 he resigned his seat. When the candidate selected to replace him dropped out, Craig found that his busy period was over and was himself nominated to fight the by-election caused by his own resignation.

Craig was a leading member of Chichester Concern, a group set up to oppose a pedestrianisation precinct in the centre of the city. He arranged for John Tyme, a lecturer in Environmental Studies at Sheffield Polytechnic who had made a name opposing motorway schemes, to come to a public inquiry and oppose it. Tyme was unable to persuade the inquiry to adjourn and consider alternatives, and had to return home.

=== Opinions ===
In 1975 Craig criticised the extension of postal votes to people on holiday at the time of elections, arguing that there were &quot;very real dangers in any electoral system which permits extensive voting by post&quot;. He thought it absurd to increase postal voting facilities which might lead to widespread abuse because there were many ways of committing electoral fraud.

Craig used the prefaces and forewords of his books to express opinions on the electoral system, arguing in 1977 that the increasing numbers of fringe and frivolous candidates in Parliamentary elections made it necessary to raise the level of the deposit required for a nomination to be valid. He also criticised the ability of people with holiday homes to register to vote in two constituencies, on the grounds that they could choose to vote in the most marginal. Craig pointed out that while it was illegal for dual registered voters to vote twice, the penalties were minimal and the offence difficult to detect. In &quot;Chronology of British Parliamentary By-elections&quot;, Craig decried the &quot;confusing and often misleading display of computer graphics&quot; used on television election programmes, and also noted the decline in newspaper coverage of by-election campaigns by the broadsheet newspapers.

When the Home Affairs Select Committee conducted an inquiry into the Representation of the People Acts, Craig (through his company) submitted a memorandum calling for an increased deposit, prohibition of multiple registration, and prevention of candidates changing their names to ones similar to those of other candidates. He also pressed for Returning Officers to be compelled to send the official result of every Parliamentary election to the Clerk of the Crown.

== Conservative split ==
At the West Sussex County Council election in 1981, Craig was elected as a Conservative councillor in Chichester West division, while his wife Phyllis won Chichester South division. He had been the Chairman of the Chichester City branch of Chichester Conservative Association for many years, but at a stormy meeting on 1 March 1982 he was voted out of office. When he spoke in support of his re-election, Craig had noted the presence of many unfamiliar faces and declared &quot;I will oppose wets and Left Wing infiltrators who would like to destroy this great party from within&quot;. In November 1981 the Association had adopted a new policy under which it refused to pay election expenses for sitting councillors, although new candidates would be funded. Craig and the other sitting councillors considered this amounted to deselection and formed the &#x27;Association of Conservative Councillors&#x27; which would raise funds for their election expenses.

The Association of Conservative Councillors chose Craig as its election agent and declared its intention to nominate candidates against those of the Conservative Association. The resignation of a Liberal councillor led to a by-election for Chichester District Council in Chichester West ward in June 1982; Phyllis Craig was nominated in opposition to the official Conservative. The Liberal candidate held the seat with a majority of 149, with Phyllis Craig receiving 250 votes. It was widely perceived that her intervention had led to the Liberals winning a seat which otherwise would have been Conservative. Craig and his wife had their annual subscriptions returned by the Conservative Association in January 1983, which he denounced as &quot;a back-door method of expulsion&quot; and &quot;a very nasty way of getting rid of someone.&quot;

Craig and his wife stood as Independent Conservative candidates for Chichester District Council in the 1983 council elections, but were not successful. He did not stand for re-election to the County Council in 1985 when his term ended. He later became a member of Chichester and Bognor Regis Samaritans.

== Suicide ==
Fred and Phyllis Craig separated in January 1988, placing the future of his business in jeopardy. The news was considered so important that the House of Commons Library issued a note to alert journalists to it. Craig sold his publishing business to Dartmouth Publishing, which later became part of Ashgate Publishing; he retained editorial control. He could not come to terms with living on his own, and attempted suicide in 1988 by taking an overdose of pills; the dedication of &quot;Britain Votes 4&quot; written in May 1988 records his thanks to family and friends as well as medical staff. However over the Easter holiday in 1989 he was found dead in his car having run a pipe from the exhaust. The cause of death was certified as carbon monoxide poisoning and the coroner returned a verdict of suicide as &quot;from the circumstances and from the notes which have been left, I have no doubt he intended the result of what he did&quot;.

After his death, his papers were given to Professors Colin Rallings and Michael Thrasher of the University of Plymouth.

<text>The Sopwith Tabloid and Sopwith Schneider (floatplane) were British biplanes, originally designed as sports aircraft and later adapted for military use. They were among the first successful types to be built by the Sopwith Aviation Company. The &quot;Tabloid&quot;, so named because of its small size, caused a sensation when it made its first public appearance.

A floatplane variant was prepared in under a month and entered for the 1914 Schneider Trophy race where it was piloted by Howard Pixton. This aircraft won the competition against minimal opposition.

Production orders for both types were placed by the military, and although a few Gnome Lambda-powered Tabloids saw limited service in the early war years, some Schneiders were still in Naval service four years later, at the end of the First World War.

==Design and development==
The original Tabloid, which was first flown by Harry Hawker on 27 November 1913, was a two-seat single-bay biplane with a side-by-side seating, which was unusual at the time. The equal-span wings were staggered and used wing warping for lateral control. The rectangular-section fuselage was a conventional wire-braced wooden structure with the forward section covered in aluminium sheet and the remainder, aft of the cockpit, covered in fabric. The wings were also of wood, covered with fabric. The tail surfaces were of steel tubing, fabric-covered, and the undercarriage had a pair of forward-projecting skids in addition to the wheels. The most distinctive feature of the design was the engine cowling, which almost entirely covered the upper half of the engine.

The prototype was powered by an Gnome Lambda rotary engine and in a trial flown by Harry Hawker at Farnborough the Tabloid reached and took only one minute to reach while carrying a passenger and enough fuel for 2 hours. A production order from the War Office for the Royal Flying Corps was placed early in 1914, and a total of 40 were built to this specification. However, the aircraft&#x27;s speed made it an obvious candidate for entry to the Schneider Trophy competition.

Accordingly, a floatplane adaptation was prepared, to be powered by a Gnome Monosoupape, which T.O.M. Sopwith personally collected from Paris. This was initially fitted with a single central float, but on its first taxiing trials with Howard Pixton at the controls the aircraft turned over as soon as the engine was started, and remained in the water for some hours before it could be retrieved. Great effort was made to make the waterlogged machine airworthy, and, lacking the time to prepare a new set of floats, the existing float was simply sawn in half down the middle and converted into a pair of floats. After a satisfactory test flight on 7 April the aircraft was shipped to Monaco, where the competition was to take place.

The competition was won by Pixton. Sopwith did not expect to win, but all of the leading contenders dropped out from mechanical problems connected to their nearly universal use of a larger two row rotary engine theoretically developing to the Sopwith&#x27;s 100, leaving the Sopwith to lap the only remaining contender in a FBA Type A flying boat even before it stopped to refuel. Pixton completed his first circuit in around two thirds of the time taken by the FBA. One other competitor broke his prop without completing the race. It was the first British designed and built aircraft to win a major international contest. Much was made of the British design, with a British made Integral propeller, and protected with British cellon dope in the British press. Despite the other competitors dropping out, the Sopwith&#x27;s speed, coupled with Pixton&#x27;s flying skill, made for a convincing victory. The prizewinning variant was then known as the Sopwith Schneider. After completing the twenty-eight circuits required for the actual race, at an average speed of and suffering from a misfiring cylinder, he made additional laps to set a new world record for seaplanes.

The first order, for twelve &quot;Schneider&quot; floatplane aircraft, was placed in November 1914 by the Royal Naval Air Service. Like the race winner, these were powered by the Monosoupape and differed only in minor detail from the racer - most noticeably in the redesigned tail float. Later production aircraft were fitted with ailerons in place of wing-warping, and were fitted with a Lewis gun firing upwards through an opening in the wing centre-section, and development would lead to the Sopwith Baby.

In all 160 were built. No original Tabloids or Schneiders survive but full-size reproductions are displayed at the RAF Museum Hendon and Brooklands Museum and a full-scale replica kit is sold by Airdrome Aeroplanes for homebuilders.

==Operational history==
Single-seat variants of the Tabloid went into production in 1914 and 36 eventually entered service with the Royal Flying Corps and Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS). Deployed to France at the outbreak of the First World War, Tabloids were used as fast scouts.

Some naval aircraft were armed with a Lewis gun on the top wing, firing over the propeller arc. One other aircraft used a Lewis gun firing through the propeller arc with deflector wedges mounted on the propeller blades, but the Tabloid was also used as a bomber, when on 22 September 1914 Tabloids mounted the first raid by British aircraft on German soil; and in their most famous mission two RNAS Tabloids flying from Antwerp on 8 October 1914 attacked the German Zeppelin sheds at Cologne and Düsseldorf. The Cologne target was not located, the railway station being bombed instead, but the Zeppelin shed at Düsseldorf was struck by two bombs dropped from and Zeppelin &quot;Z IX&quot; destroyed.

During 1915 attempts were made to use Schneiders to intercept Zeppelins over the North Sea, launching them from seaplane carriers including and , but these efforts were largely unsuccessful due to heavy seas either damaging the floats or making takeoff impossible entirely.

On 6 August 1915 a Schneider took off from the aircraft carrier using a jettisonable dolly.

A single Sopwith Schneider fighter seaplane was acquired by Captain Shiro Yamauchi, during an inspection tour of England, during 1915. While in Imperial Japanese Navy service it was designated Yokosuka Navy Ha-go Small Seaplane.

<text>Virgin Galactic Holdings, Inc. is a British-American spaceflight company founded by Richard Branson and the Virgin Group conglomerate which retains an 11.9% stake through Virgin Investments Limited. It is headquartered in California, and operates from New Mexico. The company develops commercial spacecraft and provides suborbital spaceflights to space tourists. Virgin Galactic&#x27;s suborbital spacecraft are air launched from beneath a carrier airplane known as White Knight Two. Virgin Galactic&#x27;s maiden spaceflight occurred in 2018 with its VSS &quot;Unity&quot; spaceship. Branson had originally hoped to see a maiden spaceflight by 2010, but the date was delayed, primarily due to the October 2014 crash of VSS &quot;Enterprise&quot;.

The company did the early work on the satellite launch development of LauncherOne before this was hived off to a separate company, Virgin Orbit, in 2017. The company also has aspirations for suborbital transport, to provide rocket-powered, point-to-point air travel. The spin-off company, Virgin Orbit was shut down in May 2023.

On 13 December 2018, VSS &quot;Unity&quot; achieved the project&#x27;s first suborbital space flight, VSS &quot;Unity&quot; VP-03, with two pilots, reaching an altitude of , and officially entering outer space by U.S. standards. In February 2019, the project carried three people, including a passenger, on VSS &quot;Unity&quot; VF-01, with a member of the team floating within the cabin during a spaceflight that reached . On 11 July 2021, founder Richard Branson and three other employees rode on VSS &quot;Unity&quot; 22 as passengers, marking the first time a spaceflight company founder has travelled on his own ship into outer space. In February 2022, Virgin Galactic announced that it was opening ticket sales to the public. The price of a reservation was $450,000. In June 2023, Virgin Galactic launched its first commercial space tourism flight called Galactic 01. Galactic 07 in June 2024 was the final flight of &quot;Unity&quot; as the company shifted focus to its Delta class vehicles and a higher launch cadence.

In February 2025, a ticket for a seat is estimated to cost about $600,000.

== Structure and history==
=== Formation and early activities ===
Virgin Galactic was founded in 2004 by British entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson, who had previously founded the Virgin Group and the Virgin Atlantic airline, and who had a long personal history of balloon and surface record-breaking activities.
As part of Branson&#x27;s promotion of the firm, he has added a variation of the Virgin Galactic livery to his personal business jet, the Dassault Falcon 900EX &quot;Galactic girl&quot; (G-GALX).

===The Spaceship Company===

The Spaceship Company (TSC) was founded by Richard Branson through Virgin Group (which owned 70%) and Burt Rutan through Scaled Composites (which owned 30%) to build commercial spaceships and launch aircraft for space travel. From the time of TSC&#x27;s formation in 2005, the launch customer was Virgin Galactic, which contracted to purchase five SpaceShipTwos and two WhiteKnightTwos. Scaled Composites was contracted to develop and build the initial prototypes of WhiteKnightTwo and SpaceShipTwo, and then TSC began production of the follow-on vehicles beginning in 2008. In 2012, after Northrop Grumman acquired Scaled Composites, Virgin Galactic acquired the remaining 30% of The Spaceship Company.

===Investors===
After a claimed investment by Virgin Group of , in 2010 the sovereign wealth fund of Abu Dhabi, Aabar Investments group, acquired a 31.8% stake in Virgin Galactic for , receiving exclusive regional rights to launch tourism and scientific research space flights from the United Arab Emirates capital. In July 2011, Aabar invested a further to develop a program to launch small satellites into low Earth orbit, raising their equity share to 37.8%. Virgin announced in June 2014 that they were in talks with Google about the injection of capital to fund both development and operations. The New Mexico government has invested approximately $200m (£121m) in the Spaceport America facility, for which Virgin Galactic is the anchor tenant; other commercial space companies also use the site.

On Monday 28 October 2019, Virgin Galactic listed into the New York Stock Exchange, trading under the ticker symbol &#x27;SPCE&#x27;, the first publicly traded space tourism company (i.e., company whose primary business is space tourism). The company raised $450 million through a SPAC merger listing, and company&#x27;s market value after listing was more than $2.4 billion. At the time, the company claimed to have over 600 customer reservations representing approximately $80 million in total collected deposits and more than $120 million in &quot;potential revenue&quot;.

====Retail interest====

After its listing, SPCE was a popular stock for many retail investors and was often mentioned on the subreddit r/wallstreetbets.

==Aims==
===Early history and background===
The Ansari X Prize was a space competition in which the X Prize Foundation offered a US$10,000,000 prize for the first non-government organization to launch a reusable crewed spacecraft into space twice within two weeks. It was modeled after early 20th-century aviation prizes, and aimed to spur development of low-cost spaceflight.

Created in May 1996 and initially called just the &quot;X Prize&quot;, it was renamed the &quot;Ansari X Prize&quot; on 6 May 2004 following a multimillion-dollar donation from entrepreneurs Anousheh Ansari and Amir Ansari.

The prize was won on 4 October 2004, the 47th anniversary of the Sputnik 1 launch, by the Tier One project designed by Burt Rutan and financed by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, using the experimental spaceplane SpaceShipOne. $10 million was awarded to the winner, and more than $100 million was invested in new technologies in pursuit of the prize.

===Overview of the flights to be developed===
The spacecraft initially called SpaceShipTwo was planned to achieve a suborbital journey with a short period of weightlessness. Carried to about 16 kilometers, or 52,000 ft, underneath a carrier aircraft, White Knight Two, after separation the vehicle was to continue to over 100 km (the Kármán line, a common definition of where &quot;space&quot; begins). The time from liftoff of the White Knight Two mothership carrying SpaceShipTwo until the touchdown of the spacecraft after the suborbital flight would be about 2.5 hours. The suborbital flight itself would be only a small fraction of that time, with weightlessness lasting approximately 6 minutes. Passengers were to be able to release themselves from their seats during these six minutes and float around the cabin.

== Development operations==
===2007 Scaled Composites fuel tank testing explosion===
In July 2007, three Scaled Composites employees were killed and three critically injured at the Mojave spaceport while testing components of the rocket motor for SpaceShipTwo. An explosion occurred during a cold fire test, which involved nitrous oxide flowing through fuel injectors. The procedure had been expected to be safe.

===Commencement of sub-space test flights===
Just a year later, in July 2008, Richard Branson predicted the maiden space voyage would take place within 18 months. In October 2009, Virgin Galactic announced that initial flights would take place from Spaceport America &quot;within two years.&quot; Later that year, Scaled Composites announced that White Knight Two&#x27;s first SpaceShipTwo captive flights would be in early 2010.
Both aircraft did fly together in March 2010. The credibility of the earlier promises of launch dates by Virgin Galactic were brought into question in October 2014 by its chief executive, George T. Whitesides, when he told &quot;The Guardian&quot;: &quot;We&#x27;ve changed dramatically as a company. When I joined in 2010 we were mostly a marketing organisation. Right now we can design, build, test, and fly a rocket motor all by ourselves and all in Mojave, which I don&#x27;t think is done anywhere else on the planet&quot;.

On 7 December 2009, SpaceShipTwo was unveiled at the Mojave Spaceport. Branson told the 300 people attending, each of whom had booked rides at $200,000 each, that flights would begin &quot;in 2011.&quot; However, in April 2011, Branson announced further delays, saying &quot;I hope 18 months from now, we&#x27;ll be sitting in our spaceship and heading off into space.&quot; By February 2012, SpaceShipTwo had completed 15 test flights attached to White Knight Two and an additional 16 glide tests, the last of which took place in September 2011. A rocket-powered test flight of SpaceShipTwo took place on 29 April 2013, with an engine burn of 16 seconds duration. The brief flight began at an altitude of 47,000 feet and reached a maximum altitude of 55,000 feet. While the SS2 achieved a speed of Mach 1.2 (920 mph), this was less than half the 2,000 mph speed predicted by Richard Branson. SpaceShipTwo&#x27;s second supersonic flight achieved a speed of 1,100 mph for 20 seconds; while this was an improvement, it fell far short of the 2,500 mph for 70 seconds required to carry six passengers into space. However, Branson still announced his spaceship would be capable of &quot;launching 100 satellites every day.&quot;

In addition to the suborbital passenger business, Virgin Galactic intended to market SpaceShipTwo for suborbital space science missions and market White Knight Two for &quot;small satellite&quot; launch services. It had planned to initiate RFPs for the satellite business in early 2010, but flights had not materialized as of 2014.

On 14 May 2013, Richard Branson stated on Virgin Radio Dubai&#x27;s &quot;Kris Fade Morning Show&quot; that he would be aboard the first public flight of SpaceShipTwo, which had again been rescheduled, this time to 25 December 2013. &quot;Maybe I&#x27;ll dress up as Father Christmas&quot;, Branson said. The third rocket-powered test flight of SpaceShipTwo took place on 10 January 2014 and successfully tested the spaceship&#x27;s Reaction Control System (RCS) and the newly installed thermal protection coating on the vehicle&#x27;s tail booms. Virgin Galactic CEO George Whitesides said &quot;We are progressively closer to our target of starting commercial service in 2014&quot;. Interviewed by &quot;The Observer&quot; at the time of her 90th birthday in July 2014, Branson&#x27;s mother, Eve, told reporter Elizabeth Day of her intention of going to space herself. Asked when that might be, she replied: &quot;I think it&#x27;s the end of the year&quot;, adding after a pause, &quot;It&#x27;s always &#x27;the end of the year&#x27; &quot;.

In February 2014, cracks in WhiteKnightTwo, where the spars connect with the fuselage, were discovered during an inspection conducted after Virgin Galactic took possession of the aircraft from builder Scaled Composites.

In September 2014, Richard Branson described the intended date for the first commercial flight as February or March 2015; by the time of this announcement, a new plastic-based fuel had yet to be ignited in-flight. By September 2014, the three test flights of the SS2 had only reached an altitude of around 71,000 ft, approximately 13 miles; in order to receive a Federal Aviation Administration license to carry passengers, the craft needs to complete test missions at full speed and 62-mile height. Following the announcement of further delays, UK newspaper &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; reported that Branson faced a backlash from those who had booked flights with Virgin Galactic, with the company having received $80 million in fares and deposits. Tom Bower, author of &quot;Branson: The Man behind the Mask&quot;, told the &quot;Sunday Times&quot;: &quot;They spent 10 years trying to perfect one engine and failed. They are now trying to use a different engine and get into space in six months. It&#x27;s just not feasible.&quot; BBC science editor David Shukman commented in October 2014, that &quot;[Branson&#x27;s] enthusiasm and determination [are] undoubted. But his most recent promises of launching the first passenger trip by the end of this year had already started to look unrealistic some months ago.&quot;

===VSS &quot;Enterprise&quot; crash===

At 10:51 PST 31 October 2014, the fourth rocket-powered test flight of the company&#x27;s first SpaceShipTwo craft, VSS &quot;Enterprise&quot;, ended in disaster, as it broke apart in mid-air, with the debris falling into the Mojave desert in California, shortly after being released from the mothership. Initial reports attributed the loss to an unidentified &quot;in-flight anomaly&quot;. The flight was the first test of SpaceShipTwo with new plastic-based fuel, replacing the original—a rubber-based solid fuel that had not met expectations. 39-year-old co-pilot Michael Alsbury was killed and 43-year-old pilot Peter Siebold was seriously injured.

====Investigation and media comment====
Initial investigations found that the engine and propellant tanks were intact, showing that there had not been a fuel explosion. Telemetry data and cockpit video showed that instead, the air braking system appeared to have deployed incorrectly and too early, for unknown reasons, and that the craft had violently broken apart in mid-air seconds later.

U.S. National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Christopher Hart said on 2 November 2014 that investigators had determined SpaceShipTwo&#x27;s tail system was supposed to have been released for deployment as the craft was traveling about 1.4 times the speed of sound; instead, the tail section began pivoting when the vehicle was flying at Mach 1. &quot;I&#x27;m not stating that this is the cause of the mishap. We have months and months of investigation to determine what the cause was.&quot; Asked if pilot error was a possible factor, Hart said: &quot;We are looking at all of these issues to determine what was the root cause of this mishap.&quot; He noted that it was also unclear how the tail mechanism began to rotate once it was unlocked, since that maneuver requires a separate pilot command that was never given, and whether the craft&#x27;s position in the air and its speed somehow enabled the tail section to swing free on its own.

In November 2014, Branson and Virgin Galactic came under criticism for their attempts to distance the company from the disaster by referring to the test pilots as Scaled Composites employees. Virgin Galactic&#x27;s official statement on 31 October 2014 said: &quot;Virgin Galactic&#x27;s partner Scaled Composites conducted a powered test flight of SpaceShipTwo earlier today. [...] Local authorities have confirmed that one of the two Scaled Composites pilots died during the accident&quot;. This was in strong contrast to public communications previously released concerning the group&#x27;s successful flights, which had routinely presented pilots, craft, and projects within the same organizational structures, as being &quot;Virgin Galactic&quot; flights or activities of &quot;the Galactic team&quot;. The BBC&#x27;s David Shukman commented that: &quot;Even as details emerge of what went wrong, this is clearly a massive setback to a company hoping to pioneer a new industry of space tourism. Confidence is everything and this will not encourage the long list of celebrity and millionaire customers waiting for their first flight&quot;.

At a hearing in Washington D.C. on 28 July 2015, and a press release on the same day the NTSB cited inadequate design safeguards, poor pilot training, lack of rigorous FAA oversight and a potentially anxious co-pilot without recent flight experience as important factors in the 2014 crash. They determined that the co-pilot, who died in the accident, prematurely unlocked a movable tail section some ten seconds after SpaceShip Two fired its rocket engine and was breaking the sound barrier, resulting in the craft&#x27;s breaking apart. But the Board also found that the Scaled Composites unit of Northrop Grumman, which designed and flew the prototype space tourism vehicle, did not properly prepare for potential human slip-ups by providing a fail-safe system that could have guarded against such premature deployment. &quot;A single-point human failure has to be anticipated,&quot; board member Robert Sumwalt said. Instead, Scaled Composites &quot;put all their eggs in the basket of the pilots doing it correctly.&quot;

NTSB Chairman Christopher Hart emphasized that consideration of human factors, which was not emphasized in the design, safety assessment, and operation of SpaceShipTwo&#x27;s feather system, was critical to safe human spaceflight to mitigate the potential consequences of human error. &quot;Manned commercial spaceflight is a new frontier, with many unknown risks and hazards. In such an environment, safety margins around known hazards must be rigorously established and, where possible, expanded. For commercial spaceflight to successfully mature, we must meticulously seek out and mitigate known hazards, as a prerequisite to identifying and mitigating new hazards.&quot; In its submission to the NTSB, Virgin Galactic reported that the second SS2, at the time nearing completion, had been modified with an automatic mechanical inhibit device to prevent locking or unlocking of the feather during safety-critical phases. An explicit warning about the dangers of premature unlocking had also been added to the checklist and operating handbook, and a formalized crew resource management (CRM) approach, already used by Virgin for its WK2 operations, was being adopted for SS2. However, despite CRM issues being cited as a likely contributing cause, Virgin confirmed that it would not modify the cockpit display system.

While Virgin had been pursuing the development of a smallsat launch vehicle since 2012, the company began in 2015 to make the smallsat launch business a larger part of Virgin&#x27;s core business plan, as the Virgin human spaceflight program had experienced multiple delays. This part of the business was spun off into a new company called Virgin Orbit in 2017.

=== VSS &quot;Unity&quot; ===
Following the crash of VSS &quot;Enterprise&quot;, the replacement SpaceShipTwo named VSS &quot;Unity&quot; was rolled out on 19 February 2016. Test flights were set to begin after ground tests completed in August 2016. VSS &quot;Unity&quot; completed its first flight (first free flight; captive carry flights had taken place since September 2016), a successful glide test, in December 2016. The glide lasted ten minutes. By January 2018, seven glide tests had been completed, and on 5 April 2018 it performed a powered test flight, the first since 2014. By July 2018, &quot;Unity&quot; had gone considerably higher and faster in its testing program than had its predecessor. On 13 December 2018, VSS &quot;Unity&quot; reached a height of 82.7 km (51.4 miles) above the Earth at speeds close to three times the speed of sound. The two pilots, Mark &quot;Forger&quot; Stucky and Frederick &quot;CJ&quot; Sturckow earned commercial astronaut wings from the US government for the accomplishment. Another flight in February 2019 carried third crew member (1 in the passenger cabin) for the first time.

After transfer to Spaceport America in New Mexico in February 2020, a couple of 15 km altitude test flights were carried out. Due to a surge in the number of Covid-19 cases in New Mexico, Virgin Galactic had to postpone a key test flight of its spacecraft in November 2020, and then in December 2020, a computer connection issue prevented engine ignition. On 22 May 2021, VSS &quot;Unity&quot; flew its sixth powered test flight reaching an altitude of 89 km [55 mi]. This suborbital flight marked the first ever human space flight from New Mexico; it was piloted by CJ Sturkow (pilot-in-command) and Dave MacKay. The VSS &quot;Unity&quot; was carried to 44,000 feet by the jet powered launch aircraft Mothership &quot;Eve&quot;, where it was released to reach its suborbital altitude over New Mexico. A fully crewed test flight took place on 11 July 2021 with two pilots Dave Mackay and Michael Masucci and the four passengers were Richard Branson, Beth Moses, Colin Bennett and Sirisha Bandla. The flight was initially claimed to be successful but it was later revealed &quot;Unity&quot; briefly stepped outside the airspace that had been reserved for it and the FAA were not informed as required. The FAA grounded Virgin Galactic&#x27;s space planes before allowing a resumption of flights after some changes to procedures including reserving a larger volume of airspace.

On 14 October 2021, Virgin Galactic announced that an upgrade program for &quot;Unity&quot; and &quot;Eve&quot; would begin, delaying future commercial flights to mid 2022. This followed material analysis that required further analysis.

===Spaceship III===
The first Spaceship III, VSS Imagine, was rolled out on 30 March 2021 and it was indicated there is ground testing to do before glide test flights should commence not earlier than Summer 2021.

== List of launches ==

==Collaborations==
===Potential collaboration with NASA===
In February 2007, Virgin announced that they had signed a memorandum of understanding with NASA to explore the potential for collaboration, but this produced only a relatively small contract in 2011 of up to $4.5 million for research flights.

===OneWeb satellite Internet access provider===
Virgin Group in January 2015 announced an investment into the OneWeb satellite constellation providing world Internet access service of WorldVu. Virgin Galactic would take a share of the launch contracts to launch the satellites into their orbits. The prospective launches were to use the LauncherOne system. In 2017 the LauncherOne business was spun off into Virgin Orbit, which ceased operations in 2023 following bankruptcy.

===Collaboration with Boom Technology===
Virgin Galactic and the Virgin Group collaborated with Boom Technology in order to create a new supersonic passenger transporter as a successor to the Concorde. This new supersonic plane would fly at Mach 2.2 (similar to Concorde) for a 3-hour trans-Atlantic flight (half of standard), projected to cost $2,500–10,000 per seat (half of Concorde) for a load of 45 passengers (the Concorde held 100). It was anticipated that with the accumulation of knowledge since the design of Concorde, the new plane would be safer and cheaper with better fuel economy, operating costs, and aerodynamics. Boom would collaborate with Virgin&#x27;s The Spaceship Company for design, engineering, and flight-test support, and manufacturing.

The initial model would be the Boom Technology &quot;XB-1&quot; &quot;Baby Boom&quot; Supersonic Demonstrator 1/3-size prototype. It would be capable of trans-Pacific flight, LA-to-Sydney in 6.75 hours, traveling at . XB-1 would be equipped with General Electric J85 engines, Honeywell avionics, with composite structures fabricated by Blue Force using TenCate Advanced Composites carbon fibre products. Virgin Galactic had optioned 10 units. These options expired in 2020.

=== Collaboration with Under Armour ===
On 24 January 2019, Virgin Galactic announced a partnership with Under Armour for the fabrication of space suits for passengers and pilots of SpaceShipTwo. Under Armour would also create uniforms for Virgin Galactic employees working at Spaceport America. The full range known as the UA | VG (Under Armour | Virgin Galactic) built with UA&#x27;s new Intelliknit fabric was revealed later, ahead of Richard Branson&#x27;s inaugural commercial flight. This range included a base layer, the space suit and footwear. It was said that the base layer would enhance performance and blood flow during the high and zero G portions of flight and the liner of the spacesuit was made of new fabrics such as Tencel Luxe, SpinIt and Nomex, used for temperature control and moisture management.

== Personnel and passengers==
===Key personnel===
David Mackay, former RAF test pilot, was named chief pilot for Virgin Galactic in 2011 and chief test-pilot. Steve Isakowitz was appointed as Virgin Galactic&#x27;s president in June 2013. In October 2016, Mike Moses replaced Steve Isakowitz as president; Isakowitz moved to Aerospace Corp. to become president and CEO; Moses was promoted from VP Operations, and was once a NASA flight director and shuttle integration manager.

==Aircraft and spacecraft==
===Motherships===

====White Knight Two====
The White Knight Two is a special aeroplane built as the mothership and launch-platform for the spacecraft SpaceShipTwo and the uncrewed launch vehicle LauncherOne (LauncherOne never launched from underneath a White Knight Two). The mothership is a large fixed-wing aircraft with two hulls linked together by a central wing. Two aircraft were planned – VMS &quot;Eve&quot; and VMS &quot;Spirit of Steve Fossett&quot;. On 22 May 2021 Mothership Eve was used to carry VSS &quot;Unity&quot; to a launch altitude of 44,000 feet.

====Boeing 747====
The LauncherOne system used a Boeing 747-400 aircraft, renamed &quot;Cosmic Girl&quot;, which was acquired from Virgin Atlantic. This was spun off into Virgin Orbit with the LauncherOne business in 2017.

====Generation II mothership====

Virgin Galactic plans to have generation 2 motherships ready for 2025, for the next-generation Delta-class spaceplanes. In July 2022, Virgin announced it would partner with Boeing&#x27;s Aurora Flight Sciences to design and build the next generation of mothership.

Boeing ended work on the contract in 2023 and has now filed suit against Virgin Galactic over unpaid bills according to a report in SpaceNews.

===Spaceships===

====SpaceShip Two====

Richard Branson unveiled the rocket plane on 7 December 2009, announcing that, after testing, the plane would carry fare-paying passengers ticketed for short duration journeys just above the atmosphere. Virgin Group would initially launch from a base in New Mexico before extending operations around the globe. Built from lightweight carbon-composite materials and powered by a hybrid rocket motor, SS2 was based on the Ansari X Prize-winning SpaceShipOne concept – a rocket plane that was lifted initially by a carrier aircraft before independent launch. SS1 became the world&#x27;s first private spaceship with a series of high-altitude flights in 2004.

The programme was delayed after three Scaled Composites employees – Todd Ivens, Eric Blackwell and Charles May – were killed in an accident in Mojave on 26 July 2007, where the detonation of a tank of nitrous oxide destroyed a test stand. They had been observing the test from behind a chain-link fence that offered no protection from the shrapnel and debris when the tank exploded. Three other employees were injured in the blast and the company was fined for breaches of health and safety rules. The cause of the accident has never been made public.

The successor to SS1, SS2 was twice as large, measuring 18 m (60 ft) in length; whereas SpaceShipOne could carry a single pilot and two passengers, SS2 was planned to have a crew of two and room for six passengers. By August 2013, 640 customers had signed up for a flight, initially at a ticket price of $200,000 per person, but raised to $250,000 in May 2013. Tickets were available from more than 140 &quot;space agents&quot; worldwide.

=====SpaceShipTwo&#x27;s projected performance=====

SpaceShipTwo was designed to fly to a height of 110 km, going beyond the defined boundary of space (100 km) and lengthening the experience of weightlessness for its passengers. The spacecraft would reach a top speed of 4000 km/h (2485 mph). On 23 May 2014, Virgin Galactic announced that they had abandoned use of the Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC) nitrous-oxide-rubber motor for SpaceShipTwo; on 24 July 2014, SNC confirmed that they had also abandoned use of this motor for their Dream Chaser space shuttle. Future testing was to see SpaceShipTwo powered by a polyamide grain powered motor. As of July 2021 the maximum height reached has been 89.9 km.

In honor of the science-fiction series &quot;Star Trek&quot;, the first ship was named after the fictional starship &quot;Enterprise&quot;. To reenter the atmosphere, SpaceShipTwo folded its wings and then returned them to their original position for an unpowered descent flight back onto the runway. The craft had a very limited cross-range capability, and until other planned spaceports would be built worldwide, it had to land in the area where it started. Further spaceports were planned in Abu Dhabi and elsewhere, with the intention that the spaceline would have a worldwide availability and commodity in the future.

There was a series of delays to the SS2 flight test vehicle becoming operational, amidst repeated assurances from Virgin Galactic marketing that operational flights were only a year or two out. The &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; reported in November 2014 that there has been &quot;tension between Mr. Branson&#x27;s upbeat projections and the persistent hurdles that challenged the company&#x27;s hundreds of technical experts.&quot; The company responded that &quot;the company and its contractors &#x27;have internal milestones, such as schedule estimates and goals, but the companies are driven by safety and the completion of the flight test program before moving into commercial service.&#x27; Virgin Galactic&#x27;s schedules have always been consistent with internal schedules of its contractors and changes have &#x27;never impacted flight safety&#x27;.&quot;

====SpaceShip III====
SpaceShip III is an evolved version of SpaceShipTwo.

====Delta-class spaceship====
Virgin Galactic plans to have its third generation spaceship, the Delta class, ready for testing in 2025 and commercial flight in 2026, along with the next generation of mothership. The Delta class is to be functionally the same as the SpaceShip III class, but it has been redesigned for higher production volumes.

===Fleet===
===Commercial spaceflight locations===
In 2008 it was announced that test launches for its fleet of two White Knight Two mother ships and five or more SpaceShipTwo tourist suborbital spacecraft would take place from the Mojave Spaceport, where Scaled Composites was constructing the spacecraft. An international architectural competition for the design of Virgin Galactic&#x27;s operating base, Spaceport America in New Mexico, saw the contract awarded to URS and Foster + Partners architects. In the same year Virgin Galactic announced that it would eventually operate in Europe out of Spaceport Sweden or even from RAF Lossiemouth in Scotland.

While the original plan called for flight operations to transfer from the California desert to the new spaceport upon completion of the spaceport, at the time Virgin Galactic had yet to complete the development and test program of SpaceShipTwo. In October 2010, the 3,000 m (10,000 ft) runway at Spaceport America was opened, with SpaceShipTwo &quot;VSS Enterprise&quot; shipped to the site carried underneath the fuselage of Virgin Galactic&#x27;s mothership &quot;Eve&quot;.

==Other operations and aspirations==
===LauncherOne===

LauncherOne was an orbital launch vehicle that Virgin Galactic had begun working on by late 2008, with the technical specifications defined in some detail in late 2009. The LauncherOne configuration was proposed to be an expendable, two-stage, liquid-fueled rocket, envisaged to be air-launched from a White Knight Two. This would make it a similar configuration to that used by Orbital Sciences&#x27; Pegasus, or a smaller version of the StratoLaunch.

LauncherOne was publicly announced in July 2012. It was intended to launch &quot;smallsat&quot; payloads of into Earth orbit. Several commercial customers initially contracted for launches, including GeoOptics, Skybox Imaging, Spaceflight Services, and Planetary Resources. Both Surrey Satellite Technology and Sierra Nevada Space Systems began developing satellite buses &quot;optimized to the design of LauncherOne&quot;.

In 2015, Virgin Galactic established a research, development, and manufacturing center for LauncherOne at the Long Beach Airport. The company reported in March 2015 that they were on schedule to begin test flights of LauncherOne with its Newton 3 engine by the end of 2016. On 25 June 2015, the company signed a contract with OneWeb Ltd. for 39 satellite launches for its satellite constellation with an option for an additional 100 launches.

In March 2017, Virgin Galactic spun off its 200-member LauncherOne team into a new company called Virgin Orbit. Virgin Orbit went bankrupt in 2023 after a few space launches.

===Point to point suborbital travel===

In 2016 TSC, Virgin Galactic and the Virgin Group began a collaboration with Boom Technology to develop a supersonic trans-oceanic passenger jetliner. A mission concept review of a Mach 3 vehicle design was carried out.

==Competition==
Virgin Galactic is not the only corporation pursuing suborbital spacecraft for tourism.

===Blue Origin===
Blue Origin was developing suborbital flights with its New Shepard spacecraft at the same time as Virgin Galactic developed their vehicles. Although initially more secretive about its plans, Jeff Bezos&#x27; company ended up developing a spacecraft that takes off and lands vertically and could carry six (at sometime planned four) people to the edge of space. New Shepard first flew unmanned above the Karman line and landed in 2015 and the same vehicle was reflown unmanned to above the Karman line again in 2016.

On 20 July 2021, Blue Origin flew their first crewed flight and first paying customer, Dutch teenager Oliver Daemen. Also on the flight were Bezos himself, his younger brother, and aviation legend Wally Funk.

===Commercial Crew Program===
On 16 September 2014, SpaceX and Boeing were awarded contracts as part of NASA&#x27;s CCtCap program to develop their Crew Dragon and CST-100 Starliner spacecraft, respectively. Both are capsule designs to bring crew to orbit, a different commercial market than that addressed by Virgin Galactic.

===XCOR===
Now-defunct XCOR Aerospace had also worked on rocket-powered aircraft during many of the years that Virgin Galactic had; XCOR&#x27;s Lynx suborbital vehicle was under development for more than a decade, and its predecessor, the XCOR EZ-Rocket experimental rocket powered airplane did actually take flight, but the company closed its doors in 2017.

== Notable accomplishments ==
=== First launch of founder into space ===
On 11 July 2021 Virgin Galactic became the first spaceflight company to independently launch a founder of the company into space, using the high US definition of space, having flown founder Richard Branson above the mark on flight Unity 22. This suborbital flight was accomplished using the twin-fuselage aircraft launch platform VMS Eve, coupled together with VSS Unity, enabling Branson, three other employee passengers and the two pilots to experience approximately three minutes of weightlessness above Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. The entire flight lasted approximately one hour, taking off and landing at Spaceport America facility near Truth or Consequences, New Mexico.

This flight had originally been scheduled to occur later in the summer; however, shortly after the announcement of competitor Blue Origin&#x27;s plans to fly Amazon founder Jeff Bezos into space on 20 July 2021, the Virgin Galactic flight was rescheduled to occur on 11 July 2021. At the time Virgin Galactic had been certified by the FAA to provide commercial spaceflight travel, and its accounts reported that over 600 commercial passengers had already signed up. The August 2021 price was US$450,000 per person.

=== First commercial flight ===
Virgin Galactic (at some point) planned to begin commercial spaceflight service in 2022; and said it was in the final phases of returning its suborbital spaceplane to commercial service in Feb 2022. The first commercial flight took place on 29 June 2023 with three outside passengers (people not employed by Virgin Galactic). The 70-minute mission was purchased for the Italian Air Force and the Italian National Research Council. The company at the time had a backlog of 800 or so individuals who&#x27;ve bought tickets to ride on &quot;Unity&quot;. The approximate launch cadence at the time was about one launch a month.

=== Pause of commercial flights ===
Virgin Galactic ceased flights of its VSS Unity spaceplane in mid-2024 to focus on developing its next-generation Delta-class spacecraft. This strategic shift aims to enhance flight frequency and operational efficiency, with the Delta-class vehicles expected to commence commercial service by 2026.

<text>The Singapore Army is the land service branch of the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF). The largest of the four branches of the SAF, the Singapore Army traces its origins to the 1st Battalion, Singapore Infantry Regiment (1 SIR), which was formed in 1957, when Singapore was still under British colonial rule. After Singapore&#x27;s independence on 9 August 1965, the Singapore Army Bill was passed in Parliament on 23 December 1965, and National Service (NS) was subsequently introduced in 1967. Mostly made up of conscripts, the Singapore Army can mobilise all operationally-ready military reservists in the event of war or national exigencies.

== Mission ==
The mission of the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) is to deter armed aggression, and to secure a swift and decisive victory should deterrence fail. The Army is also tasked with conducting peace-time operations to further Singapore&#x27;s national interests and foreign policy. These range from disaster relief to peacekeeping, hostage rescue and other contingencies.

The Army views technology as a force-multiplier and a means to sustain combat power given Singapore&#x27;s population constraints. Jointness across four branches of the SAF is integral to the Army&#x27;s warfighting doctrine. Joint operations undertaken with the Navy and Air Force include amphibious landings and critical disaster relief operations in the aftermath of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami.

The Army has a technically proficient, relatively well-educated draftee pool and officer corps (non-commissioned and commissioned) reflective of the population at large, and has sought to leverage this to ease its transition into a more sophisticated, networked fighting force.

Combat readiness is a linchpin of Army policy, and military exercises up to divisional level are conducted many times yearly, simulating full-spectrum operations, up to and including full-scale war. Divisional war games are a combined arms, tri-service affair involving the Navy and Air Force. Because training space is limited in Singapore—artillery fire would quickly traverse the island—some military exercises are conducted overseas. Reservists periodically train abroad, their units regularly evaluated for combat readiness. The Army also trains bilaterally with some host nations, and military exchanges are frequent. Training is billed as &quot;tough, realistic and safe,&quot; with a premium on safety, given the sensitivity of military deaths in a largely conscript army.

Following the revolution in military affairs, and in tandem with modernising its weapons systems, the Army is forging a transition to a more network-centric fighting doctrine that better integrates the Air Force and Navy.

== History ==
The Singapore Army originated with two infantry battalions, the 1st and 2nd Battalions, Singapore Infantry Regiment (1 SIR and 2 SIR), which were respectively formed in 1957 and 1962 when Singapore was still a British colony. After a merger with Malaysia which resulted in separation in 1965, Singapore passed the Singapore Army Bill in Parliament on 23 December 1965 and gained complete control of the two battalions from Malaysia in January 1966. At the time, the Singapore Army had only the two infantry battalions and the old Singapore Volunteer Artillery Corps. Months later, the Army had a reserve force, the People&#x27;s Defence Force, which was formed from an old volunteer unit mobilised for service during the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation. A third battalion, the 10th Battalion, People&#x27;s Defence Force (10 PDF), was raised as a volunteer infantry reserve battalion.

In 1967, Parliament passed the National Service (Amendment) Act, introducing National Service (conscription) for all able-bodied young men aged 18 and above. In June 1967, the Singapore Army introduced its first artillery battalion, the 20th Singapore Artillery Battalion (20 SAB). Two new infantry battalions, the 3rd and 4th Battalions, Singapore Infantry Regiment (3 SIR and 4 SIR) were formed in August 1967. In November 1968, the Singapore Army&#x27;s first armoured battalion, 41st Battalion, Singapore Armoured Regiment (41 SAR), was formed. This was followed by the creation of the 1st Commando Battalion (1 Cdo Bn) in December 1969.

In 1972, Parliament passed the Singapore Armed Forces Act to reorganise and consolidate the Singapore Armed Forces&#x27; disparate commands and administrative functions.

===Description of logo===
The emblem&#x27;s escutcheon reads &quot;Tentera Singapura&quot; (meaning &quot;Singapore Army&quot; in Malay). The national coat of arms sits in its interior. The motto is &quot;Yang Pertama Dan Utama&quot; (&quot;first and foremost&quot; in Malay). Two stalks of laurel flank the escutcheon. The laurels are green for the Singapore Army and gold for the Singapore Armed Forces.

== Operations ==
The Singapore Army has participated in peacekeeping operations overseas. In the aftermath of the Gulf War, Singapore contributed to the United Nations Iraq–Kuwait Observation Mission (UNIKOM) formed in 1991. From May 2007 to June 2013, the Singapore Army deployed about 500 personnel to join the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in maintaining stability and assist in reconstruction in war-torn Afghanistan. Since 2014, the Singapore Army has provided logistical support to the international coalition in the War against the Islamic State.

==List of chiefs of Army==

==Organisation==

The Army is headed by the Chief of Army, who is assisted by the Chief of Staff – General Staff and the Sergeant Major of the Army. The General Staff consists of six branches from G1 to G6, as well as a National Service Affairs Department handling National Service issues, and an Army Safety Inspectorate. The six branches handle issues relating to personnel (G1), intelligence (G2), operations (G3), logistics (G4), plans (G5) and training (G6). The G1, G2, G3, G5, and G6 branches are each headed by an Assistant Chief of General Staff. Among the General Staff, there is also a Chief Systems Integration Officer and a Head of the Army Information Centre.

The commanders of Training &amp; Doctrine Command (TRADOC), Combat Service Support (CSS), the four main divisions, the two operational reserve divisions, the 15 formations of the Army, and the SAF Volunteer Corps also report to the Chief of Army.

===Divisions===
The Army has six divisions, of which three are combined arms divisions, one is in charge of counter-terrorism and homeland security, and two are army operational reserves (AOR).

The three combined arms divisions are the 3rd Division (3 DIV), 6th Division (6 DIV) and 9th Division (9 DIV), each of which has active and reserve units that are operationally ready and capable of being mobilised in the event of war.

The 2nd People&#x27;s Defence Force (2 PDF) is in charge of counter-terrorism and homeland security, including the protection of key military and civilian installations around Singapore. It is also responsible for the coordination and secondment of military resources to civilian agencies in the event of a civil emergency.

The two AOR divisions are the 21st Division (21 DIV) and 25th Division (25 DIV).

===Formations===
The Army has 15 formations: Ammunition Command, Armour, Army Intelligence, Army Medical Services, Artillery, Combat Engineers, Commandos, Guards, Infantry, Maintenance and Engineering Support, Military Police Command, Personnel Command, Signals, Supply, and Transport.

===Task forces===
The Army has task forces such as the Island Defence Task Force (IDTF), Joint Task Force (JTF), Special Operations Task Force (SOTF) and the Army Deployment Force (ADF).

<doc id="1021884" wikidata="Q28327" url="?curid=1021884" title="Örnsköldsvik">
<text>Örnsköldsvik (; ), often shortened to just Ö-vik, is a locality and the seat of Örnsköldsvik Municipality in Västernorrland County, Sweden, with 32,953 inhabitants in 2017.

Its natural harbour and archipelago is in the Gulf of Bothnia and the northern boundaries of the High Coast area. It is well known as an exporter of pulp and paper products and heavy machinery goods. It has a strong environmental record and is the &quot;testbed&quot; for ethanol-powered cars.

== History ==

Traces of human activity in the Örnsköldvik area date back to the Nordic Bronze Age and there is a reconstructed Roman Iron Age village called Gene fornby that is a popular tourist attraction just outside the town.

However, Örnsköldsvik itself is a relatively young city; it was founded as a &quot;köping&quot; (a Swedish market town) in 1842 and became a city in 1894. Its name originates with the surname of governor of Västernorrland County from 1762–9, Per Abraham Örnsköld, and means &quot;Örnsköld&#x27;s Bay&quot;. The surname &quot;Örnsköld&quot; literally means &quot;Eagle Shield&quot;.

The town hosted the 1976 Winter Paralympics, the first Winter Paralympics.

== Örnsköldsvik Municipality ==
The town of Örnsköldsvik is the centre of Örnsköldsviks Kommun or Örnsköldsvik Municipality. The Municipality has a much larger population than the town itself, at over 56,000 inhabitants, as the municipality is vast with very large forest areas, and consists of several rural communities.

== Economy ==
Historically, the most important economic activity was trade and heavy industry. In the surrounding villages (now incorporated into the city itself) two major industrial ventures arose: the pulp, paper, and logging company Mo och Domsjö (MoDo), now known as Holmen, and Hägglund &amp; Söner (Hägglunds), a heavy industrial company.

Even today, successors to these two companies are of great importance for the city. The Finnish-owned Metsä Board runs a former MoDo locale, one of Europe&#x27;s largest pulp mills, in the village of Husum north of Örnsköldsvik, Domsjö Fabriker, another ex-MoDo mill), runs a specialty cellulose mill in Örnsköldsvik, while Hägglunds has been split into several companies, including BAE Systems Hägglunds, a subsidiary of BAE Systems. Other notable companies based in Örnsköldsvik include Svensk Etanolkemisv, a producer of ethanol products, and Fjällräven, a manufacturer of wilderness equipment and clothing.

== Education ==
Umeå University has a campus in Örnsköldsvik.

The asteroid 6795 Örnsköldsvik, found in 1993 by Swedish astronomers at the European Southern Observatory, was named after the city.

== Transportation ==

Main road transportation is provided by the European route E4. 

Örnsköldsvik Airport provides daily flights to and from Stockholm Arlanda Airport operated by Sveaflyg. The terminal building was recently upgraded to allow for some international services. The runway was extended to allow service for larger aircraft.

Railway transportation is provided by the recently opened Bothnia Line. Completed in August 2010, the Bothnia Line adds of high-speed railway to the Swedish railway network. At up to this is also the highest-speed track in the country. The route branches off from the Ådalen Line at Höga Kusten Airport just north of Kramfors and goes via Örnsköldsvik to Umeå where it connects to the Umeå-Vännäs line and the Main Line Through Upper Norrland. The railway line has 140 bridges and 25 km of tunnels.

Passenger traffic between Umeå and Örnsköldsvik began in August 2010. The delayed upgrade of the ERTMS signal system on the Ådalen Line meant that traffic south of Örnsköldsvik did not begin until 2012.

There is also a harbor where cargo ships load and unload lumber and other merchandise. Prior to Sweden&#x27;s joining the European Union, Örnsköldsvik had a direct ferry connection to Vaasa, Finland. This ceased operation after entry into the European Union along with the abolition of tax-exempt trade between the member states. The harbor now rarely sees passenger traffic on any large scale.

Being situated on the European route E4, the city is well connected with bus lines. A coastal line from Haparanda in the north to Stockholm makes regular stops at the bus depot in Örnsköldsvik. A cross-country route to Östersund starts and terminates at Örnsköldsvik bus depot.

== Recreation and sports ==

Due to the hilly surroundings, hiking and exploring the scenery of the High Coast is popular in the area. In the wintertime skiing and ice hockey are both popular. Cross-country skiing, alpine skiing, and ski jumping are practiced in the downtown area. In international sports, the town is also known for having hosted the inaugural Winter Paralympic Games, in 1976. The 2008 European Curling Championships also took place there.

Since Örnsköldsvik is a coastal town, there are also beaches near town, as well as campsites. There is also an indoor water park called Paradisbadet, with one of the longest water slides in Europe.

The main spectator sport in the town is ice hockey, with the local team Modo Hockey back in the SHL, the highest league for ice hockey in Sweden after being promoted for winning The Hockeyallsvenskan playoffs. IF Friska Viljor has been successful in ski jumping and the ski jumping hill Paradiskullen is a local landmark visible from downtown. 

The local football teams are not quite as successful, but still popular. On the men&#x27;s side especially the teams Friska Viljor FC from central Örnsköldsvik and Anundsjö IF from Bredbyn outside of town, and women&#x27;s Själevads IK. A couple of floorball teams from town have also had some success.

A new golf course, Veckefjärdens Golf Club, to the south of the centre is owned by local celebrity ice hockey player Peter Forsberg.

The islands surrounding the coastal area of Örnsköldsvik are big tourist attractions which can be reached by ferry.

== Notable natives ==
Örnsköldsvik is the birthplace of many world-famous ice hockey players, including Stefan Öhman, Nils Johansson, Per Svartvadet, Peter Forsberg, Markus Näslund, Niklas Sundström, Andreas Salomonsson, Magnus Wernblom, Mattias Timander, Victor Hedman, Tobias Enström, Victor Olofsson and the twins Henrik and Daniel Sedin. The Sedin twins were top players for the Vancouver Canucks along with Markus Näslund. Victor Hedman plays for the Tampa Bay Lightning. Many stars from hockey&#x27;s previous generation, including Anders Hedberg, Thomas Gradin, and Anders Kallur were also either Örnsköldsvik natives (Hedberg) or played in the town for the Modo Hockey club.

<text>Timrå () is a locality and the seat of Timrå Municipality in Västernorrland County, Sweden with 10,443 inhabitants in 2010.

It is located about 13 km north of Sundsvall (a town with a metropolitan area of some 100,000 inhabitants), and could arguably be considered a satellite to that town.

The two closest cities (Sundsvall and Härnösand) share one airport, Midlanda, that is geographically located in Timrå.

Indalsälven, one of Sweden&#x27;s largest rivers with a length of 430 km, meets the Gulf of Botnia in Timrå.

In Sweden, Timrå is mainly known for its ice hockey club Timrå IK, which, as of season 2023/24 plays in the Swedish top division SHL.

In 1995, Swedish artist Bengt Lindström constructed the Y, a 30 meter high sculpture located in Timrå.

Local legend says that Sörberge, on the north side of the town, is haunted by a tall man wearing a very large coat called &#x27;Lilla Bubbas&#x27;.
==Climate==
Timrå has historically had a subarctic climate, but it has in recent decades more resembled a cool-summer humid continental climate.

<text>Sundsvall () is a city and the seat of Sundsvall Municipality in Västernorrland County, Sweden. It has a population of 58,807 as of 2020; more than 95,000 live in the municipal area. It is Sweden&#x27;s 21st largest city by population. Old town in Sundsvall is known as Stenstan, meaning &quot;stone city&quot; referencing the stone buildings from the late eighteen hundreds.

==History==

The town was chartered in 1621, and a first urban plan for Sundsvall was probably created by Olof Bure in 1642, less likely in 1623. It has a port by the Gulf of Bothnia, and is located 395 km north of Stockholm. The city has burned down and been rebuilt four times. The first time, in 1721, it was set on fire by the Russian army during the Russian Pillage of 1719-1721. 

According to one historian, Swedish industrialism started in Sundsvall when the Tunadal sawmill bought a steam-engine driven saw in 1849. In the early 20th century Sundsvall was an even greater centre of forestry industry in Sweden than it is today. The first large Swedish strike was the &quot;Sundsvall strike&quot; in 1879. The industrial heritage makes social democrat and socialist sympathies more prevalent in the Sundsvall region than in Sweden as a whole.

In 1888 on 25 June, strong wind and dry conditions contributed to two city fires in Sweden on the same day. On this day both Umeå and Sundsvall caught fire. The Sundsvall fire was the largest in Sweden&#x27;s history. It is presumed that the fire was caused by a spark from a steamship. After the fire, and unlike Umeå, the decision was to rebuild using stone. Sundsvall&#x27;s centre was later nicknamed Stenstaden (&quot;the stone city&quot;). One advantage of the new construction was that within three years the town was arguing that it should be allowed reduced insurance as new rules had been brought in that applied to wooden towns. One disadvantage was that after the fire only the better off could afford to live in the centre.

Today Sundsvall is not only dominated by the pulp and paper industry, and the aluminium production but there are also banks, insurance companies, telecommunications administration and a number of large public data-processing centres such as the national social insurance board. The main campus of the Mid Sweden University (&quot;Mittuniversitetet&quot;) is also located in the city. The university, established in 1993, is a collaboration between Östersund, Sundsvall and Härnösand. 
== Demography ==

==Culture==
During 1987–2013, there was a summer music festival called Gatufesten. Starting in 2014 there&#x27;s a new one called Hamnyran. There are two theatres and various musical venues. There is also a small guitar festival and a larger heavy metal festival every autumn called Nordfest. Sundsvall is also home to the unique festival Musikschlaget, which is a song contest for groups around Sweden with disabilities.

==Transport==
Its airport is Sundsvall-Timrå Airport, also called Midlanda.

==Climate==

Sundsvall has a climate which is on the border between subarctic (Dfc) and cold humid continental (Dfb), leaning towards the latter in recent years. Temperatures are made significantly milder and regulated by the influence from the Gulf Stream. The weather station is located to the north and somewhat further inland near Timrå, which renders that Sundsvall&#x27;s urban centre is likely milder in terms of low temperatures by some degree.

<text>Kramfors () is a locality and the seat of Kramfors Municipality in Västernorrland County, Sweden. It had a population of 5,990 inhabitants in 2010.

The town grew on the western bank of the Ångerman river in the 19th century as harvested logs were floated downriver to be processed at local sawmills and pulp mills. Christopher Kramm introduced the river&#x27;s first steam-driven saw, naming it after himself. The name of the town in turn derives from his name and the word (&quot;rapid&quot;). In the 1960s and 1970s, as the timber industry went into decline, the population of Kramfors declined as well.

The original settlement of Kramfors was located in Gudmundrå municipality, but in 1889 received the status of a so-called or borough, still remaining part of the original municipality. In 1947 it was awarded city status, one of the last in the country to do so. Since municipal reform in 1974, it serves as the seat of Kramfors Municipality.

The municipality of Kramfors has about 20,000 inhabitants, and is situated almost in the middle of Sweden&#x27;s east coast in Northern Sweden. Within 100 kilometres from Kramfors there is a population of about 250,000 people, and within 200 kilometres about half a million people, and the large Norrland towns of Sundsvall and Umeå are within commuting distance.

Kramfors is probably best known for its beautiful and varied High Coast landscape, which has been given World Heritage status, and which provides the inhabitants with the opportunity of an outdoors lifestyle.

One of the tennis academies of Sweden is situated in Kramfors.

Kramfors also hosts the Folke Bernadotte Academy, a government agency focused on improving international conflict and crisis management, with a special interest in peace operations. It offers courses in peacekeeping intelligence and information operations that are open to all nations and to non-governmental organizations.

<text>Härnösand () is a locality and the seat of Härnösand Municipality in Västernorrland County, Sweden with 25,012 inhabitants in 2023. It is called &quot;the gate to the High Coast&quot; because of the world heritage landscape just a few miles north of Härnösand. Härnösand is the seat of the Diocese of Härnösand, the County Governor residence and Västernorrland County Museum.

== History ==


On 10 December 1885, Härnösand became the first town in Sweden with electric street lighting, following the Gådeå power station being taken into use.

== Education ==
Härnösand is the seat of The National Agency for Special Needs Education and Schools (&quot;Specialpedagogiska skolmyndigheten&quot;). 

The Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) operates its training programme Sida Partnership Forum in Härnösand.

== Industry ==
One of the biggest employers in Härnösand is the cable-TV and Cable internet service provider Com Hem.

==Sports==
The women&#x27;s team of the bandy club Härnösands AIK plays in the highest division and the men&#x27;s team has done.

Their handballteam plays in division 2 and is called Brännans IF.

The football club IF Älgarna plays in Division 2 Norrland.

Curling has also been a successful sport in the city, Team Anette Norberg is from here. Anette has taken several medals in the sport, including Olympic gold. It is perhaps therefore not surprising that Sweden&#x27;s only curling high school is located here. The high school started at 1989 and has since contributed several talented curlers to the world.

Härnösand also has an ice hockey team AIK Hockey Härnösand that plays in division 1 in region norr. 

==Recreation==
Härnösand is a fairly small town and some of the activities young people engage in are Kåken (), a youth centre provided by the municipality. The city also has an extensive selection of outdoor activities in the summer and wintertime. Wintertime people can go skiing (cross country and downhill), ice skating, etc. Summertime activities include climbing, kayaking, trekking, etc. The town also features a summertime beach Smitingen, which occasionally gets some surfable waves. Härnösand is each summer the site of one of the world&#x27;s largest airsoft events, Berget.

== Climate ==
Härnösand has a humid continental climate (Dfb) with significant maritime influence, causing mild to warm summers and cold but not severe winters that are milder than areas further north. In the Kvarken area and further north the water is less salty and freezes easier, creating colder winter climate.

<doc id="1021893" wikidata="Q5501176" url="?curid=1021893" title="Freestyle (Filipino band)">
<text>Freestyle is a pop/R&amp;B band formed in Davao City, Philippines in 1996 currently fronted by Top Suzara since 2022, who returned seventeen years after he initially left in 2005. The band was formed in 1996 and hit the in 1998, and is popular for the songs &quot;Before I Let You Go&quot;, &quot;So Slow&quot;, &quot;This Time&quot;, &quot;Till I Found You&quot;, &quot;Para Sa &#x27;Yo&quot;, &quot;Once in a Lifetime&quot;, and their rendition of &quot;Bakit Ngayon Ka Lang?&quot; with Pops Fernandez.

==Background==
The band was originally founded by former guitarist Richard Felix &quot;Tat&quot; Suzara in Davao City. Two of the most notable members of the classic lineup include vocalists Jinky Vidal and Top Suzara, the band&#x27;s primary songwriter, who left the band in 2011 and 2005 respectively and went on to have solo careers. Post-Freestyle, Vidal and Top Suzara had a reunion concert together in 2013. Other notable band members were vocalists Joshua Desiderio, Mike Luis, Ava Santos, and drummer Gerald Banzon who were with the band until Top Suzara returned and took over in 2022.

In mid-2022, after the pre-&quot;Top Suzara-comeback&quot; lineup disbanded, Top Suzara took over and continued the &quot;Freestyle&quot; brand accompanied by his own all-male session musicians. Suzara had his first comeback performance as Freestyle at 19 East in October 2022 in a sold-out gig. Suzara also trademarked &quot;Freestyle&quot; in the Intellectual Property Office (IPO) solely under his name. The IPO ruled that &quot;Freestyle&quot; is synonymous with the name Top Suzara and is deemed the rightful owner.

<doc id="1021894" wikidata="Q580514" url="?curid=1021894" title="Antonio Tarver">
<text>Antonio Deon Tarver (born November 21, 1968) is an American former professional boxer and boxing commentator. In boxing he competed from 1997 to 2015, and held multiple light heavyweight world championships, including the WBA (Unified), WBC, IBF and &quot;Ring&quot; magazine titles, as well as the IBO light heavyweight and cruiserweight titles.

As an amateur, Tarver represented the United States at the 1996 Olympics, winning a bronze medal in the light heavyweight division; he eventually lost to Vassiliy Jirov from Kazakhstan, whom he had previously defeated at the 1995 World Championships to win gold. Tarver also triumphed at the 1995 Pan American Games and 1995 U.S. National Championships, winning gold in both. He remains the only boxer in history to have won gold at the Pan Am Games, World Championships and U.S. Nationals all in the same year.

Outside of boxing, Tarver starred as Mason &quot;The Line&quot; Dixon, the heavyweight champion in the 2006 film &quot;Rocky Balboa&quot;.

==Amateur career==
*1993 and 1995 United States amateur Light Heavyweight champion.
*1994 National Golden Gloves Light Heavyweight champion
*Won the Light Heavyweight bronze medal for the United States at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. His results were:
*Defeated Dmitry Vybornov (Russia) 5–2
*Defeated David Kowah (Sierra Leone) RSC 1 (2:43)
*Defeated Enrique Flores (Puerto Rico) RSC 3 (1:54)
*Lost to Vassiliy Jirov (Kazakhstan) 9–15

==Professional career==
===Early years===
Tarver made his professional debut at the age of 28 on February 18, 1997, with a second-round knockout of Joaquin Garcia at the legendary &quot;Blue Horizon&quot; in Philadelphia.

Tarver won his first 16 fights, 14 by knockout, before stepping up his level of competition. After taking most of his first 16 fights in either his native Florida or at the &quot;Blue Horizon&quot;, for his 11th fight he met veteran Rocky Gannon in Chester, West Virginia, on August 30, 1998. Tarver knocked out Gannon in the second round.

On February 29, 2000, Tarver scored a knockout against Ernest M-16 Mateen in Las Vegas. Later that year, Tarver suffered his first loss when he was knocked down in the 11th round by Eric Harding, en route to a unanimous decision on June 23 in Biloxi, Mississippi. This was an IBF title elimination bout, where the winner would face Roy Jones Jr.

In 2002, Tarver defeated former two-weight world champion Reggie Johnson by split decision to win the NABF &amp; USBA light-heavyweight titles, and a guaranteed title shot at Roy Jones. He then scored a fifth round stoppage over Harding in a rematch that was on the undercard of the rematch between Shane Mosely and Vernon Forrest. Tarver was trailing on the scorecards until the 4th round, when he sent Harding to the canvas with a barrage of unanswered power shots; Harding was also floored twice in the 5th round, leading to the stoppage.

===Unified light heavyweight champion===

On April 26, 2003, Tarver received his first world title shot, when he faced former WBC champion Montel Griffin for the WBC &amp; IBF light-heavyweight titles that had been vacated by Roy Jones Jr., who had gone on to defeat John Ruiz for the WBA heavyweight title the previous month. After dropping Griffin in the first and last rounds, Tarver was crowned champion after winning a unanimous decision.

===Tarver vs. Jones I, II===

Next, rather than remain at heavyweight, Jones planned to return to light-heavyweight and regain his belts. Given little chance of winning, Tarver took a weight-drained Jones the distance and lost the fight and WBC title by a majority decision on November 8, 2003, in Las Vegas (Tarver had relinquished the IBF title a few days earlier in anticipation of being unable to make a mandatory defense.)

In a rematch on May 15, 2004, in Las Vegas, Tarver upset the odds to regain the WBC title and win the WBA (Super) title by knocking Jones out in the second round. In fifty previous fights, Jones had only been sent to the floor once, leaving most observers shocked at the result.

===Rise in popularity===
Tarver became a mainstream celebrity after his rematch win over Jones, making appearances at late-night shows, appearing on the cover of both Ring and KO Magazine, being spotted by television cameras as a spectator at various boxing fights, and co-hosting ESPN&#x27;s &quot;Friday Night Fights&quot; for one telecast.

===Tarver vs. Johnson I, II===
Later in 2004, the WBC decided to strip Tarver of the world title after he decided against fighting their mandatory challenger, instead choosing to fight IBF title holder Glen Johnson December 18 in Temecula, California; Tarver had already been removed as Super Champion by the WBA in their July rankings. Johnson himself had been stripped of his IBF title before the bout with Tarver for not fighting his mandatory challenger. Both fighters were celebrated for their decision to fight each other rather than bow to the pressure from what has become known as &quot;The Alphabet Soup&quot; sanctioning bodies (WBC, WBA, WBO, and IBF).

Tarver, considered a favorite to win the fight, suffered an upset loss to Johnson by way of a split decision in a fight that he did not appear to be in top shape for. Tarver avenged the loss six months later with a unanimous decision, out-boxing and out-working the aggressive Johnson at the FedEx Forum in Memphis, Tennessee to regain The Ring championship.

===Tarver vs. Jones III===

In their third fight, Tarver won a unanimous decision over Roy Jones Jr. on October 1, 2005, in Tampa, Florida, almost knocking Jones down in the 11th round but also finding himself in trouble at times during the fight.

===Tarver vs. Hopkins===

On June 10, 2006, Tarver faced former undisputed world middleweight champion Bernard Hopkins for Tarver&#x27;s &quot;The Ring&quot; title at The Boardwalk Hall in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Hopkins, a 3-to-1 underdog, dominated the fight, outboxing Tarver to win a unanimous decision. The fight was scored 118–109 by all three judges. Tarver was knocked down in the 5th round. Tarver&#x27;s record would now stand at 24 wins and 4 losses, with 18 wins coming by way of knockout.

===Return to the ring===
Tarver returned to the ring nearly one year after his loss to Hopkins, defeating Albanian-fighter Elvir Muriqi on June 9, 2007, by way of a majority decision. In his next fight, held at Foxwoods Resort Casino on December 1, 2007, Tarver registered a win over Danny Santiago by way of a 4th round TKO.

Tarver then regained the IBF title by outpointing Clinton Woods.

===Tarver vs. Dawson I, II===
On October 11, 2008, Tarver faced rising star Chad Dawson for Tarver&#x27;s IBF title. The fight took place at Palms Casino in Las Vegas. Tarver lost the fight via unanimous decision, with wide margins of 118–109 and 117–110 (twice). The outcome was not disputed.

With the loss to Dawson, it was speculated that Tarver may choose to retire; however, he later announced that he and Dawson would meet in a rematch in March 2009.

A rematch with Dawson, originally announced for March 14, 2009, had to be postponed due to an injury suffered by Dawson. Finally, on May 9, the two fighters met at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, Las Vegas. Tarver, who came to the fight as a 5:1 underdog, again lost by unanimous decision.

===Move up to heavyweight===
Following the rematch loss to Dawson, Tarver took over a year off from the ring, before returning on 15 October 2010 to defeat Nagy Aguilera by 10 round unanimous decision in a bout that took place in the heavyweight division. For this fight Tarver officially weighed 221 lbs, some 46 lbs more than he had weighed for the Dawson rematch.

===Cruiserweight===
On 20 July 2011, Tarver took on Australian IBO cruiserweight champion Danny Green at the Sydney Entertainment Centre, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, in Tarver&#x27;s debut in the 200 lb cruiserweight division.

Tarver dominated the fight, knocking Green down in the second round and controlling the majority of the action from there on in. After taking heavy punishment and being saved by the bell at the end of round 9, Green failed to come out for the start of round 10, allowing Tarver to take the victory and the title by TKO.

===Return===
On February 25, 2021, it was announced that Tarver would be returning to the ring for the first time since 2015. He was signed to face former UFC Heavyweight Champion Frank Mir in Mir&#x27;s boxing debut on April 17 on the undercard of Jake Paul vs. Ben Askren. Tarver intended to represent mental health advocacy and has said he would dedicate the bout with Mir 
to all survivors or victims of mental health disorders. However, On March 23, it was announced that Tarver had withdrawn from the bout after not being cleared by the Georgia Athletic &amp; Entertainment Commission. He was replaced by former IBF cruiserweight champion Steve Cunningham.

==Media==
===&quot;Rocky Balboa&quot;===
Tarver starred as heavyweight champion Mason &quot;The Line&quot; Dixon in the 2006 film &quot;Rocky Balboa&quot;. In the film the current, unpopular, champion Dixon fights former champion Rocky Balboa, who decides to come out of retirement. Dixon wins the match by split decision, and after breaking his hand in the second round of the bout but still managing to stand toe to toe with Rocky for the full 10 rounds, proves to doubters that he has the heart of a champion. The DVD of the movie offers an alternate ending, in which Rocky wins the split decision. Dixon&#x27;s record before the fight is 33-0 (30 KO).
Also on the DVD, the film&#x27;s writer and director Sylvester Stallone wanted to cast a real boxer in the role of Dixon, as he thought it would be easier to teach a boxer how to act than to teach an actor how to box convincingly. Tarver is one of only three fighters to actually defeat &quot;Rocky Balboa&quot; in film.

===Commentating with Showtime===
After his loss to Dawson in June 2009, Tarver served as a boxing analyst for Showtime Championship Boxing.

<text>The CERGA Observatory (, ; obs. code: 010) was a scientific department and astronomical station of the Côte d&#x27;Azur Observatory in southern France, where several asteroids were discovered during 1984–1993.

== Description ==

CERGA included 28 researchers and as many engineers and technicians located on the Observatory sites of Nice, Grasse and Calern (Caussols). The scientific activities covered fields as diverse as fundamental astronomy, celestial mechanics, and space geodesy. CERGA was in charge of several observing facilities of the Lunar Laser Ranging experiment, for example, the lunar-laser ranging telescope and the two satellite laser stations.

By nature the scientific activity involved the acquisition of data and their processing, a dedicated instrumental development and a close relationship with the more theoretical aspects in dynamics and observation modelling.

CERGA was dissolved in 2004 when the parent Côte d&#x27;Azur Observatory re-organized. The main-belt asteroid 2252 CERGA was named for the observatory, where this asteroid was discovered by Kōichirō Tomita.

== List of discovered minor planets ==

The Minor Planet Center directly credits the CERGA observatory with the discovery of 21 asteroids made during 1984–1993. The discoveries were made using the observatory&#x27;s 0.9-meter Schmidt telescope.

<text>İske Qazan (literally: &quot;Old Kazan&quot;; Cyrillic: Иске Казан), was a Bolghar-Tatar city in the 13-16th centuries, situated on the banks of the Kazanka River in the &quot;Kazan artı&quot; or &quot;Zakazanye&quot; region, in what is today the Russian Federation republic of Tatarstan.

In 18th century Tatar literature, İske Kazan was said to have been founded by the brothers &quot;Altınbäk and &quot;Ğälimbäk during Mongol invasion of Volga Bulgaria.

In the 13-14th centuries the city was one of the political and economic centres of &quot;Kazan artı&quot;. After raids by Russian armies in 1376 and 1399, the city&#x27;s importance declined. In 1535, the exiled king Canğäli khan lived in the city, where he probably died. In 1552 İske Kazan was ruined by Russian troops.

Today the &quot;Urıs Urmatı&quot; and &quot;Qamay&quot; ruins are the ruins of İske Kazan.

<text>Östersund (; ) is an urban area (city) in Jämtland in northern Sweden. It is the seat of Östersund Municipality and the capital of Jämtland County. Östersund is located at the shores of Sweden&#x27;s fifth-largest lake, Storsjön, opposite the island Frösön. It is the only city in Jämtland. The northern part of the urban area is located inside of the municipality of Krokom.

Östersund is the region&#x27;s cultural and economical centre and by tradition a city of trade and commerce. The city had one of the most extensive garrisons in Sweden prior to its closure in the early-21st century. Östersund is home to Mid Sweden University&#x27;s largest campus site with approximately 7,000 students. With a total population of 50,960 (2017) Östersund is the 22nd most populous city in Sweden, the 46th most populous city in Scandinavia, and by far the largest inland city in Northern Sweden.

The city was the only Swedish city founded and chartered in the 18th century. Östersund was founded in order to create a trade monopoly over Jämtland whose inhabitants&#x27; lucrative trade annoyed the Swedish Crown. The intention was to persuade the local farmers to deliver merchandise to middlemen in Östersund, but the population opposed this economic philosophy, and Östersund long remained small. It took until the end of the 19th century for Östersund to truly become a city, after the arrival of the railroad and the economic liberalization of that time.

Östersund is situated in inland Scandinavia and connected to Sundsvall in the east on the Swedish coast, and Trondheim in the west at the shores of the Norwegian Sea. Östersund is located in the middle of Scandinavia, in the middle of Sweden, in the middle of Jämtland County and in the middle of Östersund Municipality. As the most centrally located city in Sweden, the city credits itself as the &quot;centre of Sweden&quot;.

Östersund is marketed as – Winter City. Winter City as a project is run by the municipality together with city enterprises. While winters are long, the local climate is only moderately cold by elevated and northerly Swedish standards, but with chilly summers. Östersund has had a long history as a centre of outdoor activities with a modern cross-country ski stadium and an actual piste in the city itself. Östersund has also hosted several World Championships in various sports such as biathlon, speed skating and ski orienteering along with Swedish National Championships in cross-country skiing and snocross. The city has been the applicant city of Sweden for several Winter Olympic Games, but has yet to host one. The precursor to the Winter Olympic Games, the &quot;Nordic Games&quot;, were however held at several occasions in the city, due to lack of snow in Stockholm.

==Geography==

Östersund is the only city in the province and is located on the shore of Storsjön, the fifth largest lake in Sweden. The area surrounding this lake is commonly referred to as Storsjöbygden and has been described as the world&#x27;s northernmost located genuine agricultural society in the inland with continental climate.

The city sprawls along the eastern slopes of lake Storsjön with most of the city, and the city core itself, located on the mainland, facing the non mainland part of the city, the island of Frösön, which for a very long time was the actual centre of Jämtland. Today, a sizeable part of the city&#x27;s population live on the slopes of the island that face the city centre. Östersund is a bimunicipal town because a minor part of it, with roughly 400 inhabitants, is actually situated in Krokom Municipality.

The city spans across &quot;Östersundet&quot; and the city was named after this strait. Östersund can be directly translated from Swedish to English as &quot;East Sound&quot;. The name of the strait derives from an older Jamtish name now present in the form &quot;Åstersånn&quot;.

===Climate===
Östersund has a subarctic climate (Köppen: Dfc) and is located in the far north of the north temperate climate zone. The cold Arctic winds that occasionally find their way to the city are called (&#x27;the north-westerner&#x27;) or (&#x27;the cold-westerner&#x27;) locally.

The winter climate is much warmer than most locations at similar latitudes. This is due to the Gulf Stream and the many passages in the mountain range, bringing warmer Atlantic winds to the city during winters. This somewhat maritime character also makes the summers in the city rather cool, in comparison to other towns in inland Scandinavia, which all have a more continental climate with cold winters and warm summers. It contains a strong influence of the humid continental climate (Dfb) courtesy of its mild September lows extending the mild mean temperatures.

Though Östersund is in fact affected by the Gulf Stream, it lacks the high frequency of rain or snow following the currents. This is due to the Scandinavian Mountain Range acting as a natural barrier, receiving most of the precipitation, giving Östersund and the surrounding area a rain deficit. Another issue that has to be taken into account is the higher elevation of Östersund compared to the weather stations in Ångermanland farther east. For example, Sollefteå at a similar latitude to the east but near sea level in an inland valley, has three degrees warmer July days. There is often temperature inversion between Östersund and lower areas in winter.

Östersund has a high exposition of sunlight and was the sunniest city in Sweden in the summer of 2007 (1 July to 9 August) with 654 hours of sun. However, in comparison to east coast locations, sunshine is relatively low.
==Cityscape==

Östersund was laid out with roads spanning from north to south countered by several alleys from east to west, which is why an alley in Östersund is synonymous with a road leading down towards Storsjön. From the inner city one may gaze upon Storsjön, Frösön and the Jamtish fell region with snow-clad mountains. This was made possible due to the topography and the grid plan.

The regularity in Östersund&#x27;s road system and the slanting alleys leading from higher altitudes down towards Storsjön have created the &quot;windows to the west&quot; characteristic and unique to Östersund as a city. The alleys, often seen as rather steep, have created the illusion that the houses in the city core are climbing to higher grounds. These houses were conformed upon their construction to fit with the slopes.

The first city plan of Östersund was made with several large segments in the core being reserved as green areas. Östersund was thus planned as a green city and special lots, e.g. &#x27;spice garden lots&#x27; were created along with construction lots. These lots shifted with a construction lot alternating with a spice garden lot. The garden lots are no longer existent since they too have been constructed upon. Many of the fences that separated each lot from another with trees and verdure were left intact. The large green areas are still present, with parks such as Kyrkparken, Österängsparken and Badhusparken being the most prominent. Badhusparken was once the location of a large bath house (hence the name &quot;Badhus&quot;-) though it was torn down in 1881 when the railway was constructed. A new larger two-storey pompous bath house was later built on poles a few metres from the shore, enabling the population to bathe in the waters of Storsjön during summers. This house was also torn down when a new bath house with heated water was founded in 1938.

When Östersund started to grow as a city in the late 19th century the houses consisted predominantly of wood, though stone had become popular in the central parts. These houses were heavily characterized by Neo-Gothicism and Neo-Renaissance architecture. A very common feature of these houses were towers, some even resembling those on old castles like the one on Hotell Grand at the main square. In the early 20th century a new age had come and in the main road, Prästgatan, the new age came fiercely. The wooden houses were replaced by stone buildings, because a city&#x27;s well-being was measured in how many stone buildings it had. At the same time military barracks were constructed in connection to the older settlement. Jugendstil became popular too as an addition to the National Romantic style architecture.

In the 1930s, the functionalistic style made itself apparent in Östersund&#x27;s outskirts, which were growing. In the 1940s, the city was made more car-friendly and the city was first and foremost planned for cars. Later sanitation issues were brought up, which resulted in the construction of a sewage treatment works and waste water was no longer flushed directly into Storsjön. Östersund was also affected by the Million Programme, though to a lesser extent than other cities. During the same period older buildings such as Hotell Grand (to make room for Storsjöteatern), Cellfängelset (a jail located at the beginning of Prästgatan), Flickskolan (the girl school next to the city hall, where the current county library is located) and Västra stationen (at Badhusparken) were torn down. The local media described it as &quot;demolishing madness&quot;. When the Good Templar house was threatened in order to widen Rådhusgatan the city&#x27;s inhabitants had had enough and the building was saved.

The buildings along Storgatan (literally: &#x27;the large street&#x27;) with entire segments intact since the 1880s are considered one of the best preserved city settlements in Sweden. The wooden façades are rich with details and the house are relatively low, short and slim. A great amount of work was put down on creating a balance between details and entirety. Parallel with Storgatan lies Prästgatan – &#x27;the priest street&#x27;, Östersund&#x27;s main shopping street. The buildings between the two streets are often connected and the streets create small rooms mostly inaccessible for keen winds. These so-called rooms also stimulate the social life on the streets.

Stortorget – the main town square in central Östersund is one of six &quot;closed squares&quot; built in Sweden, the others being the ones in Uppsala, Karlstad, Vimmerby, Piteå and Haparanda. It was created through indentation in four different blocks to deliberately create an open air room with openings to every direction, a style deriving from how cities were planned during the Renaissance. However the town square lost its original shape when it was opened up and expanded towards the lake. Stortorget has long been the city&#x27;s main market place and core; it is also here that the thousand-year-old market &quot;Gregorie market&quot; is held each year in March. The city festival &quot;Storsjöyran&quot; has Stortorget as its main centre.

=== Districts and housing estates ===
Before Östersund was established the population in the area was very scarce. In Odensala and Torvalla older settlements existed; the name Odensala can be derived from the Viking age and the Halls of Odin (though Torvalla means &#x27;dry wealds&#x27; with no reference to Thor). These two villages were later incorporated into Östersund and are today two major urban districts. Besides them the urban districts of Staden, Norr, Söder, Odenslund, Karlslund, Körfältet Odenskog, Lugnvik are found on the mainland of Östersund. On the island Frösön are the six urban districts Hornsberg, Östberget, Frösödal, Mjälle, Valla and Härke.

The central parts of Östersund are a part of the urban district &quot;Staden&quot; – &#x27;the city&#x27;, which has become synonymous with Östersund for many people living in the nearby villages and towns. As Östersund is the only city in the area and nearest city for many it is common to call it , though the dative form has increasingly grown unusual. The residents of Östersund are referred to as , though local people in rural areas call them &#x27;towners&#x27;, and &#x27;towner&#x27;, in singular.


=== Landmarks ===

The most well-known landmark of Östersund is the national romantic (). It is 51 meters tall, contains 136 rooms and opened in 1912. It is the greatest constructional symbol of the National Romantic architecture in Östersund. The city hall looks almost like a fortress and has a particular connection to the local art of Jämtland. The bell tower is of typical Jamtish design, shaped like an onion. Local sculptor Olof Ahlberg (1876–1956) made most of the sculptural details and the ornaments are made from Jamtish limestone.

Östersund City Hall was designed by (1862–1935) and was seen by contemporary colleagues as the best of modern Swedish architecture. The main part of the building is accentuated by a grand tower and a monumental stairway. It is accompanied by only one wing, the north wing, as the second, south wing, was torn down in the 1970s.

A recently built landmark is &quot;Arctura&quot;, named after Jämtland&#x27;s provincial star Arcturus, a large hot water accumulator tank. Due to its appearance it is referred to as (&#x27;the Thermos&#x27;). At night the 65-meter building is illuminated with various lights to give the appearance of sunrise and the Aurora Borealis, for example.

==History==
Lake Storsjön&#x27;s shores have long been inhabited. The area where Östersund is situated was for a very long time Frösön&#x27;s link to the east mainland. Frösön, the island of the Norse god Freyr, was originally the centre of the region and it was here the only inland Scandinavian hill fort, Mjälleborgen, was built around 300 AD. The ancient Scandinavian thing Jamtamót was held on this island, the christening of Jämtland begun here and it was here the world&#x27;s northernmost raised runestone, Frösö Runestone, was raised.

Plans regarding the foundation of a Swedish city or &quot;köping&quot; (market town, &#x27;Chipping&#x27;) in Jämtland existed among governmental officials already after the previously Norwegian province was ceded from Denmark-Norway in 1645. Queen Christina demanded the establishment of a sconce on Andersön shortly after the province became Swedish; this sconce would together with Frösö sconce secure Swedish control of Jämtland. Christina&#x27;s intention was to locate the &quot;Jamts&#x27; city&quot; within this fortification. In order to construct the sconce the local inhabitants were coerced into forced labour 1651 but after protests and lack of capital the project was ended in 1654.

In 1758, the plans were brought back up through an initiative from the chief financial director Pehr Schissler and the proposition did however initiate a new debate whether or not a city was to be established in Jämtland, in order to counteract the trading and faring traditions of Jämtland&#x27;s farmers. Several other attempts at concentration had previously been taken, and deemed unsatisfactory. Östersund was founded and given its charter by Monarch Gustav III of Sweden on 23 October 1786, shortly after the outskirt of the Odensala farmers&#x27; lands were bought for the purpose. Several other places had been suggested, like Huså, the then-largest settlement in Jämtland, along with Krokom, Sunne and Ede outside of Brunflo. Frösön was also a candidate but the lot fell on Östersund, as it was deemed most favourable. The only things actually located in the area at the time were the main road and the bridge to Frösön. Östersund was upon its foundation freed from taxes for a period of 20 years and completely liberated from trade regulations and guild order. In other remote locations of the Nordic region, similar cities were founded, like Reykjavík in Iceland the very same year, Tromsø (1794) in Northern Norway and Tampere (1775) and Kuopio (1782) in the Finnish . Östersund is however the only city in present-day Sweden to have been founded in the 18th century.

The city developed poorly and had to struggle in its infancy. The state tried to persuade the Jamtish traders on Frösön to migrate to the new city but they had no intentions of leaving such a rich parish with the fertile soils Frösön consisted of in favour of the swamp and marshes across the strait. During its first 50 years the city&#x27;s population only grew by an average of eight people per year. The city became the county seat of the newly founded county consisting of the provinces Jämtland and Härjedalen in 1810, and a county council was established. Though, Östersund remained a de facto farming village with fewer than 400 inhabitants in 1820. An upswing occurred in the 1850s, as trade was liberalized and the logging industry developed.
It took until the construction of the railroad in 1879 before Östersund became a real city and actually gained the status as Jämtland&#x27;s centre, at Frösön&#x27;s expense. Thanks to the &quot;farmer chieftain&quot; Nils Larson i Tullus, the railroad came to pass through the city itself instead of outside it, as planned. The railway from coast to coast across the then-union between Sweden and Norway was finished in 1882, connecting Östersund more closely to Trondheim and Sundsvall. Östersund then came to grow faster than any other Swedish city. After ten years it had passed 20 Swedish cities in population. The city attracted immigrants, a slight majority from the Jamtish countryside, though still with a high number of settlers from southern Sweden. While Östersund was in its most intense state of growth, popular movements emerged among the inhabitants. In Jämtland and Härjedalen the Good Templar movement (a part of the temperance movement) came to dominate completely. In 1883, 700 of the city&#x27;s total population of 3,000 were organized Good Templars. The greatest symbol of the movements grandeur was the Order House constructed in 1885 in the city, . When one of the most prominent leaders, Joseph Malins, visited the city he announced that it was the world&#x27;s largest order house.

Many of the leading people behind the popular movements in Östersund saw industrialization as a significant threat to the native districts and the old village and farming community. The work from the movements made the city and its centre-right governance extremely hostile to industry. Instead they wanted to portray Östersund as a centre of outdoor activities, culture, education and tourism. Industry was not allowed to threaten the good environment and cultural history traditions.

In 1917 when the Great War was fought on the continent and with the February Revolution in Russia, the beginning of the Russian Revolution also affected Östersund. Rationing led to lack of supplies and a revolution was feared. Some of the citizens, primarily soldiers, went on hunger strikes and at the first of May that year 4,000 demonstrators gathered in front of the city hall demanding lower prices on milk and wood. The year after, the Spanish flu spread like wildfire across the world. The city doctor in Östersund noted that &quot;Östersund ought without objection to have been more haunted by the flu than any other Swedish city&quot;, which is why Östersund was referred to by locals as , &#x27;capital of the Spanish flu&#x27;.

Despite the Great Depression and several crises resulting in a very high unemployment rate, Östersund continued to grow in the interwar period. In 1918 the Odenslund area was incorporated. The business sector remained largely unaffected and Östersund continued to be one of the least industrialized cities in Sweden. Instead Östersund continued to focus on wholesale trade and became a centre for it in northern and north-central Sweden. The city&#x27;s central position was strengthened when the Inlandsbanan railway was constructed through Jämtland from the north to the south. The first scheduled bus route was created in the 1920s between Östersund and the nearby town of Brunflo. In the next decade well over 40 bus routes were functioning in Östersund. The dairy was located west of the bus square, Gustav III:s torg, at the current site of the shopping mall Kärnan. This square naturally become a central part of the city.

Östersund continued to grow after the Second World War. Lugnvik was incorporated into the city in 1954 and Östersund was, like the rest of Jämtland, affected by the Rehn-Meidner-model, though not in the same way. The Swedish Keynesian policy was launched in order to improve the mobility of the labour force. Jämtland was struck hard by this when the people moved from the countryside to cities, from inland to coast and from the north to the south. As an urban area Östersund was affected by the Million Programme and urban districts like Körfältet were created.

The negative view towards industry changed when the Social Democrats came to power for the first time in the city&#x27;s history in 1952. Industries were enticed to Östersund through the national localization policy and industrial areas were created in Odenskog and Lugnvik. Development was not, as already mentioned, as good in the rest of Jämtland as it was in Östersund and as a counter to the governmental policy, the Republic of Jamtland was established in 1963. Östersund became the capital of the tongue-in-cheek republic and the home of the freedom festival Storsjöyran.

Östersund continued to grow and in 1970 Frösö köping was made part of Östersund. In 1971 a major reform occurred in Sweden creating large municipalities replacing all the older institutions; the new large municipality was named after the city. As in the rest of Sweden, the public sector greatly expanded at this time. In 1960 the public sector of Sweden constituted about 30 per cent of Sweden&#x27;s total gross domestic product; by the mid-1980s the number had grown to 65 per cent. At the time jobs were growing in the county council, the government and in the new municipality. The main reasons for the large expansion were the expanded transfer payment to the households that occurred along with growing interest and public consumption. Everything was financed by heavy tax increases. The entirety of the 1970s was a period of expansion. Besides the new industrial complex the Frösö bridge was constructed, a new police station, Z-kupolen (burned to the ground in 1989), Storsjöteatern, Folkets hus, neighborhood churches, malls, etc. The county administrative office and the hospital were expanded and large residential areas grew up in the aforementioned Körfältet and Lugnvik areas, as well as in Odensala.

As early as the 1940s, the city tried to have a humanities university college located on Frösön. Opposition between cities in Norrland was great and it was Umeå that finally emerged victorious in 1962. Östersund did, however, get a university college for social workers () in 1971. Since 2005 Östersund has been one of the main campus sites of the Mid Sweden University (Mittuniversitetet). A number of governmental offices have also been built in the city in recent years.

==Garrison town==

Östersund became a garrison town when the Norrland Artillery Regiment (A 4) was founded in the city in 1892, followed by the upgrading of the Jämtland Ranger Corps to the Jämtland Ranger Regiment (I 23). This was done with the growing fear of a Russian assault whereas Jämtland-Trøndelag and Norrbotten became the most prioritized defense regions. The dissolution of the union between Sweden and Norway contributed by enhancing Östersund as a military city and strengthening its presence; the Jämtland Ranger Regiment was located in the city in 1910 and the Jämtland Wing (F 4) came to Frösön in 1926.

Östersund&#x27;s importance as a garrison town grew when the city was connected to the Boden Fortress, following the construction of the Inlandsbanan railway.

After the fall of the Iron Curtain, the destruction of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the Dissolution of the USSR in 1991 Sweden had lost its national threat and the demand for a strong defense organization was deemed unnecessary. The issue was debated throughout the 1990s and the final decision came in 2004 where all military presence in Östersund was ended. Upon delivering the message the Swedish Minister for Defence Leni Björklund was publicly booed by the city&#x27;s inhabitants.

The ending of Östersund&#x27;s status as a garrison town has however created larger enthusiasm regarding the city&#x27;s future as the private sector has grown larger and more companies are being established, much of which is due to the financial compensation offered by the state. The older areas reserved for military activities have been opened up and two more urban districts were made available.

==Politics and governance==
Östersund is the capital of Jämtland County and thus, the county governor Britt Bohlin Ohlsson resides in the city.
Bohlin Ohlsson is the head of Jämtland County Administrative Board (), an administrative entity appointed by the Swedish Government.

Östersund is also the seat of Jämtland County Council (). The County Council is the elected assembly of Jämtland County. The County Council&#x27;s responsibilities lie primarily within the public health care system and transportation between the municipalities.

Östersund is the seat of Östersund Municipality (). The legislative body of the municipality is the 67-member municipal assembly (&quot;kommunfullmäktige&quot;), elected by proportional representation for a four-year term. The assembly appoints the municipality&#x27;s main governing body, the 15-member executive committee (). The executive committee is headed by the Mayor (). Östersund has historically been dominated by the Conservatives, the freeminded (later on Liberal People&#x27;s Party) and the Social Democrats. Though contrary to Sweden on a national level, Östersund&#x27;s centre-right parties long remained in majority. The situation changed only in 1952 when the Social Democrats were included and they won an absolute majority in 1962. In 1966 the agrarian and rural Centre Party entered the scene, along with the minor Christian Democrat and Communist parties. A new centre-right municipal government was appointed and the Centre Party became the largest party in that coalition in 1970. However, since the 1980s the Social Democratic Party has been in power (excluding a term in the 1990s) supported by the communists (now Left Party) and occasionally the Green Party (entered in 1982).
Jens Nilsson from the Social Democratic Party is the mayor of Östersund and has been so since 1997.

==Transport==
The airport is situated outside the city centre, on the island of Frösön. Åre Östersund Airport (previously named ) is an international airport and the ninth biggest in Sweden with roughly 390,000 passengers in 2005. The airport is one of few Swedish airports with incoming foreign charter traffic and the only one with considerable economic growth in that sector.

The European route E14 runs through Östersund from Trondheim to Sundsvall and briefly merges with the European route E45 (referred to as Inlandsvägen locally) coming from the north. The two roads are later split in Brunflo where E14 continues heading east and E45 turns south again.

Östersund has passenger rail services to and from, mainly, Sundsvall and Stockholm. Norrtåg operates Mittbanan from Storlien to Sundsvall. Inlandsbanan runs in the same directions as European Route 45. Östersund is connected to Stockholm via long distance SJ 3000 (higher-speed trains), InterCity and night train. There are overnight services to and from Gothenburg and, seasonally, Malmö. Local company Stadsbussarna i Östersund (literally: &#x27;the City Buses in Östersund&#x27;) has nine routes in the city.

As Östersund is located on the shores of Storsjön, (English: &#x27;the great lake&#x27;), it also has a harbour. There is also a harbour on the Frösö side of the strait. Several bridges span across Storsjön connecting Östersund with communities nearby, Frösöbron across Östersundet, Vallsundsbron from Frösön across Vallsundet to &#x27;the other side&#x27; and Rödöbron from Frösön to Rödön in Krokom Municipality.

==Trade and commerce==

Like the rest of Jämtland Östersund is heavily dominated by many small businesses. The city is the centre of trade and commerce in Jämtland County and has more than 300 shops. The retail trade&#x27;s turnover is 30 per cent higher than it ought to be, given the number of inhabitants the city has. Trade in the central business district ( – &#x27;the city&#x27;) is mostly concentrated on the shopping and pedestrian street Prästgatan where large local shopping malls such as Kärnan and Mittpunkten along with department stores such as Åhléns are located. There are large clothing companies such as H&amp;M and Lindex and smaller ones like WESC, approximately 50 restaurants, shoe stores, sporting goods retailers like Stadium and Intersport, several supermarkets (Östersund has rather few convenience stores), etc. Storgatan, the street that runs parallel with Prästgatan, is also lined with shops, restaurants and coffeehouses. Unlike Prästgatan this street is not a pedestrian street. Östersund is the city in Sweden with the most square metres of window display per capita. The most prominent figure in Östersund&#x27;s business life throughout the 20th century was the car salesman (who started out selling horses) Sven O. Persson, founder of Persson Invest, Byggelit and Bilbolaget. A significant real estate owner was Maths O. Sundqvist (1950–2012).
Östersund has had a long history as a marketplace with the already mentioned ancient Gregorie market, tracing its lineage back to the 11th century, held in early March. Despite being banned in 1914, it continued to be held for a couple of years. In 1950, the market was reborn shortly and was completely resurrected in 1986, when the city celebrated its 200th anniversary, and has been held yearly since then. In 1948, when the markets were non-existent, visions to restore Östersund&#x27;s market traditions in a modern version were brought up. The result was the trade fair Expo Norr, initiated in 1950 in order to strengthen Östersund as a leading centre of trade in the northern parts of Sweden. The trade fair is an annual event just like Gregorie market, though Expo Norr is held during the summer and not during the winter. Expo Norr is usually attended by 30,000 individuals every year.

Like many other county capitals in Sweden the county council and the municipality are among the largest employers.

Besides trading and public services Östersund has some larger companies such as Solectron, Cybercom, Volex, Husqvarna AB, Swedbank&#x27;s telephone bank and Telia. Companies such as the dairy cooperation Milko and Inlandsbanan AB have located their corporate headquarters in the city.

A national survey done by the Confederation of Swedish Enterprise shows that out of every company in Östersund Municipality 52 per cent are &quot;very positive towards globalization&quot;, thus ranking Östersund at number eight in Sweden as the most globalization-friendly municipality (2008).

==Culture==

===Cultural venues===

Östersund is the cultural centre of Jämtland County and home to the prize winning museum Jamtli. The museum has both an indoor exhibition area and an outdoor area which contains a number of historical buildings from all over the county, depicting the old lives of peasants, the early city of Östersund and the Scandinavian inland herding. The museum exhibition hosts an interesting set of tapestries, the &quot;Överhogdal tapestries&quot;, showing a rich imagery of both Norse and Christian origin from the Viking Age. The mythical Storsjöodjuret (Great Lake Monster) has an exhibit of its own. Another remnant from the Viking Age is Frösöstenen, one of the world&#x27;s most northerly rune stones located on Frösön, the island of Freyr.

The county library, , is located in the city. It is the oldest county library in Sweden, being founded in 1816 by the will of professor Carl Zetterström. As the library grew it was moved to a bigger facility. The older building is now situated beside the old church in Kyrkparken.

Lake Storsjön has been trafficked for a long time and the steamships S/S Thomée and S/S Östersund are still in operation every summer. Unlike most boats, they are seen as male and not female. S/S Thomée is the only one that sets sail from Östersund&#x27;s harbour. S/S Östersund sails from Arvesund, located at Storsjön&#x27;s western shore but makes visits to Jamtli&#x27;s steamboat jetty.

Frösö Zoo was one of Sweden&#x27;s largest zoological gardens with exotic animals. Prior to its closing in 2019, it had roughly 700 animals including Siberian tigers, lions, polar wolves, and monkeys. Frösö Zoo also had a tropical house, a biological museum and an amusement park. Outside of Östersund in the village of Orrviken there is a moose zoo called Moose Garden, allowing close encounters with tame moose.

Färgfabriken (&#x27;the paint factory&#x27;) is a centre for experimental culture based in Stockholm that portrays itself as a laboratory of contemporary art. A branch named &quot;Färgfabriken Norr&quot; was established in Östersund between April 2008 and January 2011.

Gaaltije, the centre for South Sami culture, opened in 1999 and is a living source of knowledge for South Sami culture, history and business.

Gamla Tingshuset holds a small cinema, a café, a small venue and practice halls. It is usually a meeting place for the town&#x27;s youth.

===Events===
*The city festival Storsjöyran (referred to as simply &quot;Yran&quot;, literally meaning: &quot;The Great Lake Giddy Festival&quot;), the oldest city festival in Scandinavia and with 55,000 visitors every year the largest in Sweden. Storsjöyran is held in the middle of Östersund the last weekend of July. Although the event starts the weekend before with the opening of Krogstråket when regional bars and restaurants gather near the lake.

The largest daily newspaper in Östersund is &quot;Östersunds-Posten&quot; (ÖP) with a circulation of 30,000 copies and the second largest is &quot;Länstidningen Östersund&quot; (LT) with a circulation of 15,000 copies (2006 for both). Like most Swedish newspaper they each have a political editorial page, views of the Centre Party are expressed in ÖP and views of the Swedish Social Democratic Party are expressed in LT. &quot;Länstidningen&quot; is unique in Sweden, as it is the only Swedish newspaper with press support that has ever made itself non-dependent on state subsidy. Much of the paper&#x27;s success is ascribed to the then editor-in-chief awarded with the Grand Journalism Award (). Since 2006 the newspaper has been dependent on state subsidy. The media group Mittmedia has owned both newspapers since 2005.

Two free daily newspapers exist in the city, &quot;100 procent Östersund&quot; and &quot;Lokaltidningen Storsjön&quot;.

==Education==

Östersund recently became a university city and the Mid Sweden University has its largest campus site in Östersund with well over 7,000 students. The Mid Sweden University was a university college (&quot;högskola&quot;) named &quot;Mitthögskolan&quot; until it was granted university status in 2005, making it the youngest university in Sweden. Mitthögskolan was the result of the merger between the University College of Sundsvall/Härnösand (&quot;Högskolan i Sundsvall/Härnösand&quot;) and the University College of Östersund (&quot;Högskolan i Östersund&quot;)

Östersund is a centre for the research in social sciences (business administration, psychology, sociology and political science) and social work, whilst the research in Health Sciences is split between Östersund and Sundsvall.

The city has several secondary schools (&quot;gymnasieskolor&quot;) of which Palmcrantzskolan (PC) and Wargentinsskolan (Wargen) are the two largest. Among the smaller are Storsjögymnasiet, Östersund&#x27;s gymnasieskola and Dille Gård Naturbruksgymnasium.
==Sports==

Östersund is marketed as the &quot;Winter City&quot; and has a long history of winter sports. It is internationally perhaps most known as one of the regular Biathlon World Cup hosts in late-November and early-December. World Cup competitions have been held there since 1989. The Biathlon World Championship 1970 were hosted in Östersund in 1970, 2008 and 2019.

The cross-country skiing stadium is located two kilometres () from the city centre and is one of the most well-equipped and spectator friendly ski stadiums in Sweden. The stadium is also internationally renowned due to the topography of its ski tracks, the compact track-system and the fact that Östersund is usually quite a reliable locality for snow during the winter months. A number of biathlon world cup races have been held at the stadium as well as several national championships in cross-country skiing.
&quot;Nationellt Vintersportcentrum&quot; (NVC, Swedish Winter Sports Research Centre) is a research and training project run by the sports movement, the university, the municipality and the county council. The Swedish Olympic Committee (SOC) use its lab for various tests.

Östersund, in association with the neighboring municipality of Åre, had plans to be the candidate of Sweden for the organization of the XXII Olympic Winter Games, the 2014 Winter Olympics, but the candidacy proposal was rejected by the government. It would have been the fourth attempt of this city (after 1994 where Östersund lost the bid with the score 45–39 to Lillehammer in the final round, 1998 and 2002).

Östersund has a basketball team in Sweden&#x27;s highest division (Ligan), Jämtland Basket.

Östersund&#x27;s Fallskärmsklubb is the oldest of Sweden&#x27;s drop zones and was formed in 1958. The very first civilian parachute jump was done actually on the ice of Storsjön in February 1956. The jumpers were officers from the Swedish Parachute rangers regiment that also wanted to jump on their spare time. Östersund&#x27;s Fallskärmsklubb is today localized to Optand&#x27;s airfields, approximately south from Östersund where the education of students and skydiving for experienced jumpers are carried out year-round with the exception of late autumn until early winter.

Other sports clubs include:

* IFK Östersund
* Ope IF
* Östersunds FK
* Fältjägarnas IF

===2021 Special Olympics World Winter Games===
Östersund along with Åre were originally to host the 2021 Special Olympics World Winter Games. It would have marked the first time that Sweden had ever hosted the Special Olympics. However, due to lack of funding on 19 December 2019, the event did not take place in Sweden. Instead it will take place in Kazan, Russia and was delayed to 2022.

<text>Åre () is a locality and one of the leading Scandinavian ski resorts situated in Åre Municipality, Jämtland County, Sweden with 3,200 inhabitants in 2018. It is, however, not the seat of the municipality, which is Järpen. 25% of the local economy is based on tourism, most notably the downhill skiing and biking resorts in Åre, Duved and Storlien. The growth in tourism has resulted in the development of hotels, recreational and shopping opportunities in the area.

== History ==
In the 12th century the Åre Old Church was built. Saint Olaf the Holy is a historical figure who has influenced the village and for centuries pilgrims passed through the village on their way to Trondheim. Sami people settled in the mid-17th century to take advantage of good reindeer pasture. In the 18th and 19th century the copper mines in Fröå were important industries. Tourism started to grow with the establishment of a railroad in 1882, and Åre&#x27;s first &quot;Grand Hotel&quot; was erected in 1896. The kings of Sweden and Norway came to stay in Åre and Storlien for recreational purposes since the 19th century.

== Geography ==
Åre is situated in Åredalen (Åre Valley), approximately AMSL at the coastline of Åresjön lake. The European route E14 and the Mittbanan railway pass through Åre, connecting the larger towns Östersund and Trondheim.

===Climate===
Åre has a subarctic climate (Dfc).
== Tourism ==
Tourism in Åre started as King Oscar II in 1882 supervised construction of the Östersund–Trondheim railway. With this new railway, many people came to Åre to breathe the fresh air and to walk to the top of Åreskutan. They were soon known as &quot;air-guests&quot; (Sw. &quot;luftgäster&quot;).

There was no hotel, but in 1888 Albin Wettergren opened a restaurant by the railway station. In 1891, Åre Tourist Station opened and even more guests were attracted to the village.

A lady from Östersund saw this increasing tourism as a great opportunity to open a hotel and did so in 1895. It was called &quot;Hotell Åreskutan&quot;. Albin Wettergren opened a hotel (&quot;Grand Hotell&quot;) as well. These were only a few of all the hotels that were going to be founded in Åre.

In 1910, the funicular Åre Bergbana was built and was the third one in Sweden after Skansens Bergbana in Stockholm (1898) and the one in Kiruna (1907). This was a more convenient way for the air-guests to reach the top of Åreskutan.

In 2008, the hotel &quot;Copperhill Mountain Lodge&quot; opened on the top of the Förberget hill. Designed by American architect Peter Bohlin, it is the only mountain hotel in Scandinavia referred to as a &quot;Design Hotel&quot;.

== Winter events ==

Taking advantage of the Åreskutan fell, Åre Ski Area has become the major center for alpine skiing in Sweden, sporting more than 30 modern ski-lifts. It hosted the Alpine World Championships in 1954, 2007 and 2019, and has hosted more than 100 FIS Alpine Ski World Cup events throughout the years. On 9–10 March 2012, the Freestyle FIS World Cup was held at the &quot;Slalombacken&quot; slalom course close to the village centre, and on 18 Feb 2020 a sprint race in the FIS Cross-Country World Cup was held at the same place.

===2021 Special Olympics World Winter Games===
Åre along with Östersund were initially selected to host the 2021 Special Olympics World Winter Games. It would have marked the first time that Sweden has ever hosted the Special Olympics. However, due to a variety of issues including lack of funding, on 19 December 2019, the event will not take place in Sweden. Instead it will take place in Kazan, Russia and was delayed to 2022.

===Winter Olympics===
Åre has also been the site for the alpine events in Sweden&#x27;s eight failed bids to host the Olympic Winter Games, including for the 1984, 1988, 1992, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2022 and 2026. This is because Åre has the only piste in Sweden suitable for top-level downhill races.

=== Notable people ===
* Henrik Lundqvist – New York Rangers goaltender, gold medalist in 2006, 2012 Vezina trophy winner and twin brother of Joel Lundqvist 
* Joel Lundqvist – Frölunda HC captain and checking forward, two-time world champion, former Dallas Star and twin brother of Henrik Lundqvist
* Jon Olsson - Professional freestyle skier, X-Games Champion and social media influencer
* Henrik Windstedt – winner of the 2008 &quot;Freeride World Tour&quot;
* Lars-Börje Eriksson – Olympic alpine skiing bronze medalist
* Henrik Harlaut – Professional freestyle skier

== Summer events ==
Åre has since the 1990s become the largest mountainbike resort in Sweden. In 1999 it was the host for the UCI Mountain Bike &amp; Trials World Championships and it hosted the Nordic Championships 2007.
There are numerous graded downhill cycling trails. The Åre Bikepark is open from 1 May until 15 October and is the host for the Mayhem Festival.

During summer Åre can also sport hiking, paragliding, kayaking, and a golf course about 15 minutes from the village. In July every year there is a multisport competition in Åre – &quot;Åre Extreme Challenge&quot;. It counts as the Scandinavian championship in multisport.

== &quot;One of the world&#x27;s ten best ski-resorts&quot; ==
In 2008 Åre was appointed as one of the ten best ski-resorts in the world at the list from the magazine &quot;Condé Nast Traveller&quot;

== Transport ==
The nearest airport is situated 99 kilometres (62 mi) eastward, on the island of Frösön in Östersund. Åre Östersund Airport is an international airport and the ninth biggest in Sweden with roughly 390 000 passengers (2005).

The European route E14 runs through Åre from Trondheim via Östersund to Sundsvall, where it merges with the European route E45.

Åre also has a train station. Norrtåg operates the Mittbanan railway from Storlien (where Trondheim-bound diesel trains connect), via Åre and Östersund to Sundsvall. Åre is connected to Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö through long distance SJ 3000 (higher-speed trains) and InterCity. Åre is also served by seasonal overnight trains.

<text>Bräcke is a locality and the seat of Bräcke Municipality in Jämtland County, Sweden with 1,651 inhabitants as of 2010.

The community is located next to Lake Revsundssjön, 70 km south-east of Östersund. 
The railway has been an important factor in Bräcke&#x27;s development. The town is located along the Central line and serves as the starting point of the Main Line Through Upper Norrland. European route E14 also passes through Bräcke and Länsväg 323 starts in Bräcke and goes towards Kälarne.

Bräcke Church (&quot;Bräcke kyrka&quot;) was built in the summer of 1859 following a drawing by Abraham Rafael Ulric Pettersson (1824-1866). The church building is externally clad with white painted wooden paneling. The ceiling of the church room has a thin vault of wood. The altarpiece was painted in 1926 by Stockholm artist Karl Tirén (1869-1955). In the church tower hang two bells; the little bell was cast in 1778 and large bell was cast in 1859.

== Climate ==
Bräcke has a subarctic climate influenced by its interior elevated plateau position transitioning between the coastal and mountainous regions of Norrland. This renders a variable climate prone to summer frosts. The annual temperature is usually just above . Compared to Torpshammar not far to its east, Bräcke is relatively cold due to the elevation difference. Being in a relative rain shadow from the Scandinavian Mountains, winter snow packs are usually moderate.

<text>William Frederick Fisher (born April 1, 1946) is an American physician and a former NASA astronaut. Fisher went into space in 1985 on board the Space Shuttle. He retired from NASA in 1992 and returned to the full-time practice of medicine. His time at NASA coincided with that of his former wife and fellow astronaut Anna Lee Fisher.

==Early life==
Fisher was born April 1, 1946, in Dallas, Texas. 

==Education==
* 1964: Graduated from North Syracuse Central High School, North Syracuse, New York
* 1968: Received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Biological Sciences from Stanford University
* 1969–1971: Performed graduate work in Microbiology at the University of Florida
* 1975: Received a Doctor of Medicine from the University of Florida
* 1975–1977: Residency in General Surgery from UCLA Medical Center
* 1978–1980: Performed graduate work in Engineering at the University of Houston

==Career==
Fisher graduated from Stanford University in 1968, and later served as a mountaineering instructor in Leysin, Switzerland. He attended medical school at the University of Florida, graduating in 1975. After medical school, Fisher completed a surgical residency from 1975 to 1977 at Harbor–UCLA Medical Center in Torrance, California. He entered private practice in emergency medicine in 1977. He also attended graduate school at the University of Houston from 1978 to 1980. He was accepted as a NASA astronaut in 1980.

He has logged over 2,000 hours in prop, rotary-wing, jet aircraft and spacecraft.

==NASA career==
Fisher was selected as NASA Astronaut in 1980. His technical assignments included: scientific equipment operator for high altitude research on the WB-57F aircraft (1980–1981); astronaut medical support for the first four Shuttle missions (1980–1982); astronaut office representative for Extravehicular Mobility Unit (spacesuit) and Extravehicular Activity (EVA) procedures and development, including thermal vacuum testing of the suit (1981–1984); astronaut office representative for the Payload Assist Module (PAM-D) procedures and development (1982–1983); Astronaut office representative for Shuttle Mission Simulator (SMS) development (1983); support crewman for STS-8; CAPCOM for STS-8 and STS-9; Remote Manipulator System (RMS) hardware and software development team (1983); Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU) development team (1983); Deputy Director of NASA Government-furnished and Contractor-furnished Equipment (1982–1983); Chief of Astronaut Public Appearances (1985–1987); Member of the U.S. Air Force Scientific Advisory Board (1986–1991); NASA Medicine Policy Board (1987–1991); Astronaut Office Space Station Manned Systems Division, and Health Maintenance Facility (1987–1989); Astronaut Office representative on space crew selection and retention standards for Space Station (1989–1991).
Fisher also continued to practice Emergency Medicine in the greater Houston area in conjunction with his astronaut duties.

Fisher was a mission specialist on STS-51-I, which launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on August 27, 1985. STS-51-I was acknowledged as the most successful Space Shuttle mission yet flown. The crew aboard Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot; deployed three communications satellites, the Navy SYNCOM IV-4, the Australian AUSSAT, and American Satellite Company&#x27;s ASC-1. They also performed a successful on-orbit rendezvous with the ailing 15,400 pound SYNCOM IV-3 satellite, and two EVAs (spacewalks) by Fisher and van Hoften to repair it, including the longest spacewalk in history (at that time). &quot;Discovery&quot; completed 112 orbits of the Earth before landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on September 3, 1985. Fisher logged over 170 hours in space, including 11 hours and 52 minutes of Extravehicular Activity (EVA).

In 1990, Fisher led a study of the design of the planned space station. The &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that study &quot;found the 500-foot structure was so complex and fragile that it could need up to 3,700 hours of maintenance a year by space-suited astronauts, as against the designers&#x27; original goal of 130 hours.&quot; In March of that year Fisher gained political notice &quot;when he publicly accused his superiors at the space agency of ignoring the maintenance problem. Subsequently, he was called to Capitol Hill to testify before a number of committees.&quot;

==Post-NASA==
After leaving NASA, Fisher returned to the practice of emergency medicine. He remains in active medical practice in the greater Houston area at the present time.

==Personal life==
He married fellow physician and later fellow astronaut, Anna Lee Fisher of St. Albans, New York, on August 23, 1977. They have two daughters. The two divorced in 2000.

<text>Admiral Sir William Wordsworth Fisher (26 March 1875 – 24 June 1937) was a Royal Navy officer who captained a battleship at the Battle of Jutland and became Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Fleet. Arthur Marder wrote that he was &quot;the outstanding admiral of the inter-war period&quot;.

==Naval career==
Fisher was born on 26 March 1875, at Blatchington in Sussex, the son of historian Herbert William Fisher and his wife Mary Louisa Jackson (1841–1916). He joined the Royal Navy in 1888 and trained in HMS &quot;Britannia&quot;.

As a midshipman he served in , flagship of the Cape of Good Hope and West Africa Squadron, for three years from 1890 to 1893, before joining in the Training Squadron. After examinations and courses, and now a sub-lieutenant, he joined the protected cruiser in the Mediterranean Fleet in January 1896. The ship was a byword for smartness. According to Fisher&#x27;s biographer &quot;she was remembered as the ship whose stream anchor was kept burnished like polished silver&quot;. He left her as a lieutenant with highly appreciative reports from his captains and was selected to qualify in gunnery.

He joined the gunnery course, for a first year at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, on 14 September 1898, along with other lieutenants who were likewise to distinguish themselves in later years:, Frank Larken, Tufton Beamish and Ernest Taylor (like Beamish, later also an MP). The second year of the course was at Whale Island and the third and final year on a gunnery school staff, which for Fisher was to be Whale Island. His joined the modern pre-dreadnought battleship , as a gunnery lieutenant in Malta in November 1901. In mid-1903 he was again ashore, on the senior staff of the gunnery school &quot;Cambridge&quot; at Devonport and this was followed, on 1 January 1904, by an appointment as a senior staff officer at Whale Island. This appointment would normally have led to his becoming first lieutenant of Whale Island but Fisher fell out with Captain Percy Scott, the famous gunnery expert then commanding &#x27;The Island&#x27;.

Nevertheless, his reputation could weather minor storms, and he was selected by Captain Arthur Leveson, flag captain to Admiral Sir William May, as first and gunnery lieutenant of the new Atlantic Fleet flagship, , joining her in January 1905. He struck up a firm and lasting friendship with Dudley Pound in a busy eighteen months on board, leaving the ship early after selection for early promotion to Commander, donning his &#x27;brass hat&#x27; on 30 June 1906, aged 31.

His first appointment with three stripes, in September 1906, was as commander of the pre-dreadnought battleship , flagship of Rear-Admiral Atlantic Fleet, soon to be commanded by Captain Robert Falcon Scott and flying the flag of Rear-Admiral John Jellicoe. His success in her led to his joining, in the same role, in June 1908, the new battlecruiser , fitting out to take the Prince of Wales to Canada for a seven-day visit. This was soon followed by his becoming flag commander – staff officer – to the Commander-in-Chief Home Fleet, his old chief Admiral Sir William May, flying his flag in the new battleship , where he developed gunnery tactics. When Admiral May was appointed Commander-in-Chief, Plymouth, in the spring of 1911, Fisher followed as his flag commander, a post that allowed him to live at home with his new wife, cycling the four miles to work, for some nine months. Then he joined the new battlecruiser , fitting out at Vickers, Barrow-in-Furness, but, before she was commissioned, he had left her, being promoted, at the age of 37, to captain on 1 July 1912.

&quot;W W&quot;, as he was known, joined the battleship , wearing the flag of Rear-Admiral Somerset Gough-Calthorpe, on 10 December 1912. By 1916, she was a &#x27;private ship&#x27; (flying no admiral&#x27;s flag) and, for the early part of his service in World War I, he was still captain of the &quot;St Vincent&quot; and with her at the Battle of Jutland. He commanded that battleship for three years and five months and became Director of the Anti-Submarine Division at the Admiralty in May 1917, where he stayed until January 1919, having overseen a host of new inventions to defeat the enemy submarine menace.

He was appointed captain of the battleship on 2 January 1919, the ship soon to join the Mediterranean Fleet. There, his initiative was put to good use in difficult diplomatic and political situations in Turkey, Egypt and the Black Sea. In August 1919, &quot;Iron Duke&quot; became the flagship of the new Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean Fleet, Admiral Sir John de Robeck and he asked Fisher to be his Chief of Staff, in the rank of Commodore 2nd Class; he went with de Robeck in the same position to the Atlantic Fleet in 1922, first as Commodore 1st Class and then as rear-admiral.

He went on to be Rear-Admiral in the 1st Battle Squadron of the Mediterranean Fleet in 1924 for a year and then spent ten months unemployed, on half pay, before taking over as Director of Naval Intelligence for eight months, during Rear-Admiral Alan Hotham&#x27;s illness. He was appointed Fourth Sea Lord and Chief of Supplies and Transport in 1927 and promoted vice-admiral in January 1928. He was made Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff in 1928, overseeing a period of naval economy. He became commander of the 1st Battle Squadron and second in command of the Mediterranean Fleet, hoisting his flag in the battleship , at Marseilles, in October 1930.

After a six-month respite in England, from April 1932, he was promoted to full admiral and became Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean Fleet, hoisting his flag in the battleship , on 31 October 1932. During more than a decade as a flag officer with the Mediterranean Fleet, he developed a great affection for Malta, and his love for the children of the village of Mġarr is marked by the name of Fisher Road. He handed over command at the end of March 1936 and went on to be Commander-in-Chief, Portsmouth, hoisting his flag in on 7 July 1936. After the Coronation Naval Review and the King&#x27;s Birthday Review, on Southsea Common, he died in office, while on leave in the country, after just under a year in post, in 24 June 1937, aged 62.

==Family==
Fisher married Cecilia Warre-Cornish (1 May 1886 – 30 January 1965), daughter of Francis Warre-Cornish, on 21 December 1907. Their daughter Cecilia Rosamund Fisher (22 November 1909 – 1991) married Captain Richard Coleridge, 4th Baron Coleridge (1905–1984), of the Royal Navy on 28 August 1936; they had issue, two sons, including the present peer. Another daughter, Horatia Mary Fisher, married Group Captain Geoffrey Mungo Buxton (1906–1979), a grandson maternally of the 3rd Earl of Verulam, and had three surviving daughters.

Fisher was the brother of H. A. L. Fisher, Edmund Fisher, Charles Fisher, Florence Henrietta Darwin and Adeline Vaughan Williams. His sister Cordelia Fisher married the author, critic and journalist Richard Curle and was the mother of the academic Adam Curle.

He was related to the Stephen family, and in 1910 his ship was targeted in the &quot;Dreadnought&quot; hoax by Adrian Stephen, his sister Virginia Stephen (later Virginia Woolf) and others.

<text>Vindeln () is a locality and the seat of Vindeln Municipality in Västerbotten County, Sweden with 2,333 inhabitants in 2010.

== Climate ==
Vindeln has a subarctic climate that is mildened for its latitude by its proximity to the Gulf Stream airflow. Considering it being inland, winters are more severe than coastal areas such as Umeå and Holmön, but milder than areas at a higher elevation. Summers are short but often warm, with civil twilight lasting all night during a few weeks, contrasted by the vast winter darkness with very short days. Precipitation is moderate but due to the cold winter temperatures there is a sizeable snow cover every year.

<text>Vilhelmina (Southern Sami: &quot;Vualtjere&quot;) is a locality and the central town of Vilhelmina Municipality in Västerbotten County, in the province of Lapland, Sweden with 3,657 inhabitants in 2010. Vilhelmina is situated by Lake Volgsjön in the Ångerman River, with the smaller Lake Baksjön located to the east of the community. Vilhelmina Church and Volgsjö School are located in Vilhelmina.

== History ==
The town of Vilhelmina originated from the settlement Volgsjö, which was established in the 1770s by Daniel Danielsson from Torvsjö within Åsele parish. Permission for the settlement was granted on 7 October 1776. Shortly thereafter, the residents of the area requested to have a chapel church with a permanent preacher, as the church in Åsele was too far away. Daniel Danielsson&#x27;s homestead was deemed suitable as a residence for the preacher. Danielsson was offered to take over half of the Torvsele settlement in Åsele, which was held by the pastor and schoolmaster there, an offer he accepted. Daniel Danielsson moved, and in the summer of 1782, work began on building the chapel in Volgsjö.

In 1804, Volgsjö was renamed Vilhelmina after Queen Frederica Dorothea Wilhelmina, the consort of King Gustav IV Adolf. The parishes Fredrika and Dorotea were also named after her first names.

Vilhelmina village became a church town in 1916, but in 1921 a serious fire ravaged the area, destroying more than half of the church town. The fire started on the morning of 5 September 1921 in one of the cottages south of Storgatan. The flames quickly caught hold of the old timber walls and spread rapidly from house to house. The fire was further accelerated by the fact that people were throwing furniture, household items, and other objects out of the houses, which then caught fire and helped spread the flames. In the battle against this inferno, only three small fire pumps were available. By five in the afternoon, it was determined that over 50 buildings south of Storgatan had burned to the ground. The investigation concluded that the fire was caused by a defective chimney wall.

The remaining church cottages on the north side of Storgatan began to deteriorate, and something needed to be done to preserve these culturally and historically valuable buildings for future generations. Therefore, in the 1960s, Vilhelmina Municipality started purchasing the old houses to initiate a restoration, which was completed in 1975. These buildings, which had previously served only as private residences and business premises, were now also used for room rentals to provide temporary accommodation The church town, along with the adjacent church and buildings, is of national interest for cultural heritage conservation.

=== Administrative Affiliations ===
Vilhelmina has historically been and continues to be the parish village in Vilhelmina Parish. Following the municipal reform of 1862, it became part of Vilhelmina rural municipality, where the Vilhelmina municipal community was established on 23 March 1917. In 1947, Vilhelmina and its surrounding areas were separated from the rural municipality to form Vilhelmina market town (köping), which incorporated Vilhelmina rural municipality in 1965. In 1971, the market town was merged into Vilhelmina Municipality, where Vilhelmina has since served as the central locality.

In ecclesiastical terms, the town has been part of Vilhelmina Parish since 26 April 1783, and was part of Åsele Parish before that. The town was part of the Åsele Lapland Judicial District until 1922, then Vilhelmina Judicial District until 1948, and subsequently the Åsele and Vilhelmina Judicial District until 1971. Since 1971, Vilhelmina has been included in the Lycksele District Court&#x27;s jurisdiction.

==Climate==
Vilhelmina has a subarctic climate that is less severe than typical for a far inland locality at this latitude, but still very cold by Swedish standards. Its higher altitude causes summers to be cooler than coastal areas like Skellefteå further east, whereas winters are somewhat tempered by maritime air from the greater Atlantic and the North Atlantic Current.

<text>Storuman (, Ume Sami: &quot;Lusspie&quot;) is a locality and the seat of Storuman Municipality in Västerbotten County, province of Lapland, Sweden with 2,207 inhabitants in 2010. It is situated by the Ume River, at the southeastern end of Lake Storuman.

== History ==

It is believed that the first Swedish people who came to the area, were from Vilhelmina to the south and settled here around 1741. The place became known as &#x27;Luspen&#x27;, derived from a local river of the same name. Until 1912, the population of the village was about 40 inhabitants living in eight farms, but that changed when a railway station was built (Inland Line) around 1924. The village quickly grew and became known as an important centre for hydroelectric power and the timber industry. It later became a popular tourist spot as well.

The heraldic shield (the weapon of the town) is a Wild man, based on the name of the village and the symbols of the strength and determination of the people of Lapland.

<text>Sorsele (; ; Ume Sami: ) is a locality and the seat of Sorsele Municipality in Västerbotten County, province of Lapland, Sweden with 1,277 inhabitants in 2010. Sorsele is also the nearest town to the ski resort Nalovardo. It is known for containing a portion of the Vindelfjällen Nature Reserve, one of the largest nature reserves in Sweden.

Mercedes-Benz operate winter driving events on a series of Hermann Tilke-designed snow/ice courses in the area.

== History ==
The name contains the suffix &quot;sel,&quot; meaning &#x27;calm water.&#x27; The prefix is a Swedish adaptation of the Sámi word &quot;&quot;Soursså&quot;,&quot; which in turn may come from an older Swedish name, &quot;&quot;Sörsele&quot;.&quot; Another explanation is that Sorsele comes from the Sámi &quot;&quot;Suörke-suulë&quot;,&quot; which means &quot;Branch Island&quot; (since the Vindel River branches around Sorsele Island, where the church site is located).

Sorsele is the parish center of Sorsele Parish and was part of the Sorsele Rural Municipality after the municipal reform of 1862. On November 15, 1935, Sorsele Municipal Community was established for the locality, which was dissolved at the end of 1955. Since 1971, the locality has been part of Sorsele Municipality as its central locality.

==History==
Dorotea has been populated since 1713, when the first settler Jon Erson Kervalainen and his wife moved to a Sami camp later known as Svanavatten (&quot;Swan water&quot;). This village expanded to 41 houses by the end of the century, and the residents were anxious to build a chapel. The seat was chosen to be Bergvattnet.

On May 21, 1799, the village of Bergvattnet was renamed Dorotea, in honour of Queen Frederica Dorothea Wilhelmina of Sweden.

The church burnt down in 1932 and a new church was inaugurated in 1934. Designed by Evert Milles, it houses some notable objects, such as a sculpture by his brother the famous Carl Milles.

<text>A barbell is a piece of exercise equipment used in weight training, bodybuilding, weightlifting, powerlifting and strongman, consisting of a long bar, usually with weights attached at each end.

Barbells range in length from to above , although bars longer than are used primarily by powerlifters and are not commonplace. The central portion of the bar varies in diameter from 25 millimetres (0.98 in) to 50 millimetres (1.96 in) (e.g., Apollon&#x27;s Axle), and is often engraved with a knurled crosshatch pattern to help lifters maintain a solid grip. Weight plates slide onto the outer portions of the bar to increase or decrease the desired total weight. Collars are used to prevent plates from moving outward unevenly so that the lifter does not experience uneven force. 

The barbell is the longer version of the dumbbell that is used for free weight training and competitive sports, such as powerlifting, Olympic weight lifting, and CrossFit. Many exercises can be done using the barbell, such as bicep curl, bench press, Olympic weightlifting, overhead press, deadlift, and squat. Olympic barbells are usually an estimated weight of . Many fitness categories use the barbell for different reasons. For example, powerlifters use the barbell to perform compound exercise movements.

==Use in Olympic weightlifting==

===Men&#x27;s bar===
A men&#x27;s Olympic bar is a metal bar that is long and weighs . The outer ends are in diameter, while the grip section is in diameter, and in length. The bars have grip marks spaced apart to allow intuitive grip width measurement. It is the standard used in competitive weightlifting where men and women compete at the highest level: the Commonwealth Games, Pan-American Games, World Championships, and the Olympics. Bars of this kind must have suitable &quot;whip&quot; (ability to store elastic energy) and sleeves which rotate smoothly, as well as the capacity to withstand dropped lifts from overhead.

===Women&#x27;s bar===
A women&#x27;s Olympic bar is similar to the men&#x27;s bar, but is shorter and lighter—, and —with a smaller grip section diameter (). Also in contrast to the men&#x27;s bar, the women&#x27;s bar does not sport a center knurl.

== Bumper plates==
Weight plates used in Olympic lifting, which are often termed &quot;bumper&quot; plates, are coated in solid rubber to make them safer to drop from above head height. General strength training or powerlifting plates are made from cast iron and are considerably cheaper.

Currently, the following colour code is required by International Weightlifting Federation:

 green bumper plates were only officially approved for use by IWF from 1976 to 1980, Montreal being the only Olympic venue where they were deployed.

Presently, Olympic plates of or more are in diameter. versions also exist of the lighter and plates to accommodate the proper starting position for beginner athletes. These can be aluminium or plastic and may have rubber edges.

==Powerlifting==
As a general rule, powerlifting requires use of stiffer bars to better accommodate the heavier weights being used in the sport. The deadlift barbell is usually the longest, thinnest and the most flexible, thus allowing more weight to be lifted. Powerlifting barbells use simpler, more robust bushings because they do not need to rotate as fast as Olympic weightlifting barbells. Sometimes the sleeves of powerlifting bars are also extended. Additionally, powerlifting bars have their grip marks spaced closer, at . This closer spacing is used to check legal grip width in the bench press. Powerlifting utilizes the same bar for both male and female competitors.

The International Powerlifting Federation requires using strictly the same kind of bar on all lifts, being between and in diameter, not more than in overall length, and between and between the inner faces of the collars. Another visual difference from typical Olympic bar or International Paralympic Committee approved one is that the IPF bar&#x27;s knurling shall not be covered by chrome. Stating that bar should weigh with collars on, effectively permits use of bars only, because 
same as IWF, IPF requires collars to weigh each.

The total weight of the barbell varies based on the type and number of plates loaded onto the ends of the bar and the lift being performed, and easily can be or more with a squat dedicated bar (which itself can weigh up to and have up to grip section diameter).

Additionally, differently coloured plates are or were used outside of IWF sanctioned competition, most prominently in powerlifting.

These include:

Powerlifting plates in contrast to Olympic lifting ones are usually thinner (to accommodate more plates on bar) and as they are not meant to be dropped, do not need to utilize additional coating.

 plates are fairly rare, typically only used in some of the powerlifting federations still using plate sets scaled in pounds, such as IPA, SPF and their affiliates.

Black polyurethane coated plates were introduced by Eleiko in International Paralympic Committee sanctioned London 2012 Paralympic Games. Apart from them and record discs, IPC approved set uses the same plates as the IWF one.

Technically, and smaller plates can be of any colour in IPF approved sets, although only colours listed above were used for them by few certified manufacturers.

==Non-competition equipment==
Most &quot;Olympic&quot; bars one can see in commercial gyms, although superficially similar to real Olympic bars to the untrained eye, do not share International Weightlifting Federation or powerlifting essential characteristics. They are known as multi-purpose or hybrid barbells that typically share features of both Weightlifting and Powerlifting barbells. For example, they have a shaft diameter of 28.5 mm which is between Weightlifting and Powerlifting bars. Further, they have dual knurl markings and typically have bushings or a combination of bearings and bushings to provide enough spin for the Olympic lifts while maintaining performance during heavy strength training exercises.

Weight plates used outside of competition need not conform to IWF or powerlifting specifications, and can be of any colour. Kraiburg bumper plates are rated in pounds, and one notch lighter than expected, regarding their traditional place in colour code: red plates are , blue ones , etc.

==Collars==
Standard collars can be of any material, usually metal, and they can weigh up to each for both men and women.

Typical Olympic bar with a pair of collars, the plates not counted, can weigh as much as for men and for women depending on the collars.

==Pads==

Barbell pads, also known as squat pads, are sometimes fitted to barbells for comfort and safety reasons. This may be for high bar squats where the bar can exert direct pressure on the spine due to incorrect positioning or the person having insufficient trapezius muscle to form a cushioning layer. Critics, however, argue that the depth of the pad means the bar is held in a less stable position which actually increases the overall pressure on the neck. Hip thrust exercises, where the bar rests across the front of the pelvis, standardly use a barbell pad. 

==Other types of Barbells==

=== Berg Prototype &quot;Olympic&quot; revolving Barbell ===
This barbell was produced by the company Berg in 1910, but designed by Veltum. This was a major turning point in Olympic lifting as the barbell was able to revolve easily during the lift. After the Olympic games in 1928 Amsterdam, the barbells began to become popularized and many companies started to copy the barbell. The Berg barbell and copies of it were spread through many gyms around the world mainly from the 1960s to the 1970s because of the rise of the new barbell.

===&quot;Standard&quot; or &quot;One Inch&quot; Barbells===
&quot;Standard&quot; or more commonly &quot;One Inch&quot; or &quot;1 inch&quot; barbells are characterised by a bar that is very approximately one inch (25.4mm) in diameter along the whole of its length, with a commensurate sized centre hole in the weight plate. 

Despite the &quot;Standard&quot; name they come in a wide range of sizes that can have little in common with one another, and usually range from 25mm (0.98in) to 29mm (1.14 in) in diameter in varying lengths and other dimensions. In contrast with the rotating sleeves and uniform sizes of Olympic bars, which mount plates with a fixed size centre hole; the ends of standard bars do not rotate, and commonly mount plates with centre hole diameters of 27 millimetre (1.06 in) through to 31 millimetre (1.14 in). This variation may prove very problematic if plates are mixed and matched, as plates with smaller holes may not fit the larger diameter &quot;standard&quot; bars. Gauging this by eye is very difficult, so taking the bar (or a micrometer gauge) to check that new plates will fit an existing bar is essential. Alternatively a larger hole plate may rattle or spin on the smaller diameter &quot;standard&quot; bars unless very securely collared. Small circular spring clamp collars are most often used to secure the weights though more permanent fixings are available. Other variations include spinlock end bars with screw on nut collars and many others. 

The thickness of the grip section is most commonly in the United States or in Europe, but can be thicker or thinner, depending on quality. Neither bar weight nor length is standardized like men&#x27;s or women&#x27;s Olympic bars, and can range from to . They are rarely rated for more than of loading. The bar itself can weigh anything from 4kg to 10kg

The main advantages of &quot;Standard&quot; or &quot;One Inch&quot; barbells and weight plates are that they are often easier to store and take up less room; the bars may come apart into two or three sections, weigh less, may also be convertible to dumbbells, and are usually much less expensive than Olympic weights for those on a budget. Weight plates come in cast iron, or coated cast iron, tri grip, or far thicker and cheaper vinyl filled with concrete.

===Dumbbells===
Dumbbells are the equivalent of one-handed barbells, with a gripping surface approximately and a total length that rarely exceeds . Adjustable dumbbells are the most prominent use of &quot;standard&quot; weight plates (those having a to center hole). Some dumbbell sets come with an attaching bar to convert the pair to a single barbell.

===EZ curl bars===
Originally known as a Dymeck curling bar after its inventor Lewis G. Dymeck (US Patent Number 2,508,567), the EZ (&quot;easy&quot;) curl bar is a variant of the barbell that is often used for biceps curls, upright rows, and lying triceps extensions. The curved profile of the bar in the grip region allows the user&#x27;s wrists and forearms to take a more neutral, less supinated position. This reduces the risk of repetitive stress injury in these exercises. However, when performing the biceps curl, using an EZ curl bar prevents full contraction of the biceps, which can only occur with the wrist fully supinated, and thus may prove a less effective exercise.

===Fixed Barbells===
Primarily found in gyms, these are usually fairly short bars with weights already attached and welded to the bar, and in some cases, a covering of plastic/rubber around the plates. A typical gym might carry a range of fixed barbells from 5 kilos (11 lb) to around 50 kilos (110 lb). They are handy as they take less space than full-length bars and are useful for many exercises where less weight is required. They can also provide an easier starting point for beginners before moving on to using the full olympic bars. In addition, they provide for speedy transitions between various weights if one is doing multiple weights in quick succession.

===Thick-handled Barbells===

These specialty items are designed to challenge the grip. They&#x27;re used in strongman competitions for the deadlift and overhead presses, such as Apollon&#x27;s Axle. Recently, even such exotic diameters as have appeared. They are made in China, and can weigh up to . 

===Triceps bars===
Similar in function to an EZ curl bar, the triceps bar consists of two parallel handles mounted in a cage. It is used to perform triceps extensions and hammer curls.

===Trap bar/hex bars===

A hexagon-shaped bar in the middle of which the user stands and grasps the bar, via side handles, with a neutral grip. The use of trap bars places the center of gravity closer to the lifter. Trap bars are used primarily for performing deadlifts and shrugs.

===Safety squat bars===

A bar with a camber in the middle, two handles and padding. The safety squat bar may help to avoid causing or aggravating injury while squatting.

=== Swiss Barbells ===
The Swiss Barbell or the Multipoint Bar offers multiple hand positions for the user, to offer close grip, overhand and underhand rows or chest exercises; as well as being utilised for bicep and tricep exercises. These barbells vary in weight, with the Mirafit Swiss Barbell weighing 20kg.

<text>The Madras Crocodile Bank Trust and Centre for Herpetology (MCBT) is a reptile zoo and herpetology research station, located south of the city of Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India. The centre is both a registered trust and a recognized zoo under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 and comes under the purview of the Central Zoo Authority, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Government of India. The establishment is located on a site covered by coastal sand forests, along the coast of Bay of Bengal.

The MCBT was established in 1976 with the primary aim of conservation of three Indian species of crocodiles — mugger crocodile, saltwater crocodile and gharial. It was expanded as a centre for herpetology and research of other reptile species in 2003. The centre has bred over 5000 crocodiles since its inception and is one of the largest reptile zoos in the world. As of 2024, the park had 15 species of crocodiles including three critically endangered species and 33 other reptilian species. The park recorded about 0.42 million annual visitors from April 2018 to March 2019.

The trust also runs three field stations at South Andaman, Agumbe in Karnataka, and the Chambal valley in Uttar Pradesh as well as a snake venom extraction centre. It is also involved in various research, conservation and educational projects.

== History ==

Towards the end of the 19th century, hunting of crocodiles for their skin began and by the 1960s, wild populations of the crocodiles were reducing. Amongst the three Indian species, the mugger (&quot;Crocodylus palustris&quot;) had disappeared from most of its range, the gharial (&quot;Gavialis gangeticus&quot;) was critically endangered and saltwater crocodile (&quot;Crocodylus porosus&quot;) numbers were threatened. The crocodile species were protected under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 by the Government of India. The Crocodile Conservation Project was launched by the Indian government in collaboration with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in 1975, for the protection and captive breeding of crocodiles. The Madras Crocodile Bank was conceived in 1973 and it was established on 26 August 1976 by herpetologist Romulus Whitaker with his wife Zai Whitaker and others. The bank was started for the protection and breeding of Indian crocodile species.

The Crocodile Bank later developed a captive breeding program for freshwater turtles and tortoises. In the 1980s, the bank was established on the Moyar River to study the mugger crocodiles. In 1990, the Andaman and Nicobar Environmental Team (ANET) was set-up as a division of the bank with a station established on a stretch of land in Wandoor, on the southern tip of South Andaman in 1993. The newsletter &quot;Hamadryad&quot; being published by the trust since 1976 was converted into a full scientific journal in 1991. In 2003, the bank was renamed the Madras Crocodile Bank Trust and Center for Herpetology and additional exhibits of other reptiles were added. The trust is also involved in research on snake venom and in 2005, the Agumbe Rainforest Research Station was established in Agumbe in Karnataka for the study of King Cobra and other diverse animals and ecosystems of the Western Ghats. In 2005, Rom Whitaker was given a Whitley Award and used the money to assist in setting up the Agumbe station.

In 2011, the Crocodile Bank announced plans for the construction of a new frontage and satellite facility, followed by the redesign and construction of the display area including new enclosures with glass facades, walkways and interactive features. As per the new plan, estimated at , the park would be divided into four areas corresponding to various geographies with thematic landscaping, interactive displays and signage. The plan included a separate gharial exhibit, entry plaza with a café, parking areas and an interpretation centre that houses small crocodiles, snakes, turtles and lizards on the upper level and underwater viewing of the largest saltwater crocodile exhibit in the park, on the lower level. In 2018, Whitaker was presented with Padma Shri, the fourth highest civilian award by the Government of India. In 2020, the trust faced financial problems due to COVID-19 pandemic induced lockdown. The trust raised funds through crowd funding to mitigate the situation and for further planned developments.

== Organisation ==
The Madras Crocodile Bank Trust was established in 1976 which runs a reptile zoo and herpetology research station. The centre is both a registered trust and a recognized zoo under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 and comes under the purview of the Central Zoo Authority, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Government of India. The Crocodile Bank is situated on a stretch of land, located about south of Chennai on the East Coast Road at Vadanemmeli near Thiruvidandhai, along the Bay of Bengal.

The bank runs three field bases namely Andaman and Nicobar Environmental Team at South Andaman, Agumbe Rainforest Research Station at Agumbe and Gharial Ecology Project in Chambal valley. The trust is affiliated with more than 47 institutions including The World Conservation Union (IUCN), World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), Marine Conservation Society and Smithsonian Institution. The trust manages a snake venom extraction center, operated by the Irula tribes.

== Wildlife conservation ==
=== Animal research and education ===
The trust engages in research projects on reptiles and other educational programmes. The bank has served as a regional source of status information for the World Conservation Monitoring Centre and has hosted numerous international meetings of the IUCN Specialist Groups dealing with reptiles. The trust publishes a biannual herpetology journal called &quot;Hamadryad&quot; and is home to the largest library of herpetological literature in India. Research in the field of herpetology within the bank has resulted in over 600 scientific publications, books, reports, newspaper and magazine articles and films.

The centre has hosted numerous local and international scientists and research specialists. In the early 1980s, Edward Moll of Eastern Illinois University did a study on turtles in India based out of the bank. The bank&#x27;s research biologists have since studied freshwater turtles in the Chambal River in Uttar Pradesh on a WWF grant with many species kept in the park as part of the centre&#x27;s ongoing research program. The bank collaborated with J.W. Lang from University of North Dakota, to initiate a project for the study mugger crocodiles. The project was done in association with Romulus Whitaker and Harry Andrews and focused on reptile reproduction, egg incubation, and temperature-dependent sex determination. In the 1990s, studies on breeding biology and growth of lizards was conducted.

In 2001, the Crocodile Bank was awarded the Ford Conservation and Environmental Grant for project &quot;Integrated Environment Education&quot;, a multi-lingual programme on reptile preservation to create environmental awareness. The Andaman and Nicobar Islands Environmental Team is focused on research and conservation of the bio-diversity in Andaman and Nicobar islands. The park conducts research into snake venom and mitigation of its effects in humans. The Agumbe research centre aids in study of venomous snakes and other organisms in the Western Ghats. The park conducts regular educational and outreach programmes. The bank serves as a consultant on reptile management and conservation issues to multiple organisations and countries. The bank also runs an animal-adoption programme under which patrons can sponsor an animal housed at the center.

The Crocodile Bank has a veterinary care section which works with the maintenance staff to monitor the health and maintenance of the animals. Examination and treatment for various pathological and parasitical examinations are carried out on the animals. Unique identification numbers are assigned to individual animals with maintenance of health and medical records. The trust also engages in training of veterinarians to help equip other research and conservation projects.

=== Captive breeding ===
The trust was established for breeding crocodiles, has bred over 5000 crocodiles and is the largest breeding centre in India. The park is one of the centres for breeding the critically endangered gharials and has been successfully breeding the species since 1989. The park breeds other two species of crocodiles from India, mugger and salt-water crocodiles from 1983. It has also been breeding other exotic crocodile species such as Morelet&#x27;s crocodile (&quot;Crocodylus moreletii&quot;) and Siamese crocodile (&quot;Crocodylus siamensis&quot;). In 2010, the bank also bred the rare false gharial, a species listed as endangered on the Red List of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The trust has been involved in re-introducing crocodiles to the wild and various zoo exchange programmes. The government stopped the release of captive bred crocodiles into the wild in 1994, which led to the number of crocodiles increasing at the park. As no methods have been evolved to sterilize the crocodiles, the increasing numbers resulted in nearly one thousand animals being relocated to Gujarat in 2022.

The bank also breeds turtles, snakes and other reptiles. It is a coordinating zoo of the Central Zoo Authority of India for the breeding programmes for endangered species, including rock python, king cobra and Ganges softshell turtle, as per the National Zoo Policy adopted by the Government of India in 1988. It has been breeding cane turtle (&quot;Vijayachelys silvatica&quot;) and Travancore tortoise (&quot;Indotestudo travancorica&quot;) since the 1980s. In May 2004, the bank successfully bred one of the world&#x27;s most critically endangered turtles, the red-crowned roofed turtle (&quot;Batagur kachuga&quot;), for the first time ever in captivity. Some of the turtles were sent to Uttar Pradesh to be introduced into the wild. The trust has been involved in engaging local community and education for the conservation of olive ridley sea turtle (&quot;Lepidochelys olivacea&quot;). The Crocodile Bank is a nodal point for captive breeding of endangered pythons in the country, especially the Indian rock python (&quot;Python molurus&quot;) and reticulated python (&quot;Python reticulatus&quot;).

<doc id="1021984" wikidata="Q7349383" url="?curid=1021984" title="Robert Root-Bernstein">
<text>Robert Root-Bernstein (born August 7, 1953) (PhD, Princeton University) is a professor of physiology at Michigan State University. In 1981, he was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship, commonly known as a &quot;genius grant&quot;.

He has also researched and consulted on creativity for more than fifteen years. Among other books, he has authored &quot;Sparks of Genius: The Thirteen Thinking Tools of the World&#x27;s Most Creative People&quot;, &quot;Discovering: Inventing and Solving Problems at the Frontiers of Scientific Knowledge&quot;, and &quot;Rethinking AIDS: The Tragic Cost of Premature Consensus.&quot; In &quot;Rethinking AIDS&quot;, Root-Bernstein postulated that factors in addition to HIV may contribute to AIDS. Root-Bernstein is a former member of the Group for the Scientific Reappraisal of the HIV-AIDS Hypothesis, a group of AIDS denialists.

Root-Bernstein asserts that HIV, while involved in the development of AIDS, may be no more important than an accumulation of co-factors such as a history of poor nutrition, lack of hygiene, intravenous drug use, anal intercourse, as well as various infections and lifestyle diseases. In its April 2004 issue, &quot;POZ&quot; published a quote it attributed to Root-Bernstein: &quot;Both the camp that says HIV is a pussycat and the people who claim AIDS is all HIV are wrong ... The denialists make claims that are clearly inconsistent with existing studies. When I check the existing studies, I don&#x27;t agree with the interpretation of the data, or, worse, I can&#x27;t find the studies [at all].&quot;

<doc id="1021985" wikidata="Q6894987" url="?curid=1021985" title="Mojave Aerospace Ventures">
<text>Mojave Aerospace Ventures (MAV) is a company founded by Paul Allen and Burt Rutan to handle the commercial spinoffs from the Tier One project. It owns the intellectual property arising from Tier One, and it is in turn owned by Allen (the majority shareholder) and Rutan&#x27;s Scaled Composites. In 2004, it signed a deal with Virgin Galactic to develop the Virgin SpaceShip, a suborbital spacecraft, for space tourism. Virgin Group and Scaled Composites have subsequently formed a joint venture, The Spaceship Company, to manufacture the spacecraft.

==Company==

The structure of Mojave Aerospace Ventures appears to be the basis of the deal between Allen and Rutan for the funding of Tier One. The company owns all the intellectual property of the Tier One project, such as patents, and so controls commercial exploitation. Allen, the sole source of funding for Tier One, is the majority owner. Rutan, having developed the technology, owns a minority stake. 
This stands in contrast to the company more usually associated with Tier One, Scaled Composites, which, as of 2007, is owned by Northrop Grumman.
MAV serves to separate Tier One spinoffs from Scaled. Mojave Aerospace Ventures is part of Allen&#x27;s Vulcan Aerospace.

==Tier One derivative applications==
===Virgin Galactic===

On September 25, 2004, MAV agreed on a joint venture with Richard Branson&#x27;s newly formed company Virgin Galactic, to develop a suborbital spacecraft for the space tourism market. The initial plan is to build five Virgin SpaceShips, based on scaling up the Tier One SpaceShipOne (SS1) design, with White Knight One (WK1) similarly evolved. The spacecraft would be manufactured by The Spaceship Company.

The designs for the Tier 1b customer suborbital spaceflight vehicles are referred to as SpaceShipTwo (SS2) and its carrier aircraft is White Knight Two (WK2). The system, a suborbital space tourist system.

A further development of the technology, Tier Two and SpaceShipThree (SS3) was mooted. Either as, initially an orbital system, or, later, suborbital transcontinental/transoceanic transport. SS3 would eventually become into a further development of Tier 1b.

===Stratolaunch Systems===
A further application of the Tier One technology is for Allen&#x27;s Stratolaunch Systems under Vulcan Aerospace with its Stratolaunch carrier aircraft &quot;Roc&quot;.

<doc id="1021987" wikidata="Q1126934" url="?curid=1021987" title="Conrad N. Hilton Foundation">
<text>The Conrad N. Hilton Foundation is an American non-profit charitable foundation, established in 1944 by hotel entrepreneur Conrad Hilton. It remained relatively small until his death on January 3, 1979, when it was named the principal beneficiary of his estate. In 2007, Conrad&#x27;s son, Barron Hilton announced that he would leave about 97% of his fortune to a charitable remainder unitrust which names the foundation as the remainder beneficiary.

==Financial information==
The foundation&#x27;s assets, as of September 2019, were approximately $2.9 billion and had increased to $6.3 billion due to Barron Hilton&#x27;s passing. Since inception, the foundation has awarded more than $1.7 billion in grants. Currently more than 50% supports international charitable projects. According to the OECD, the foundation&#x27;s financing for 2019 development decreased by 11% to US$42.3 million.

==Program areas==
The foundation&#x27;s mission is derived from the last will and testament of Conrad Hilton that directs the organization to &quot;relieve the suffering, the distressed, and the destitute.&quot; The foundation invests in seven program areas: Catholic sisters, disaster relief and recovery, foster youth, homelessness, hospitality workforce development, safe water, and young children affected by HIV and AIDS. The foundation also supports organizations in four transitioning program areas: avoidable blindness, Catholic education, multiple sclerosis and substance use prevention.

===Catholic Sisters===
The Hilton Foundation Catholic Sisters program is focused on recognizing Catholic sisters as leaders in the human development field by supporting organizations and congregations in the United States and Africa.

===Disaster Relief and Recovery===
The Disaster Relief and Recovery program supports communities to prepare for disasters and provide long-lasting solution towards long-term recovery.

===Foster Youth===
This program works with nonprofit organizations in Los Angeles and New York to provide assistance to transition age youth ages 16–24 as they age out of the foster care system.

===Homelessness===
The foundation partners with organizations in Los Angeles County to build permanent supportive housing for individuals experiencing chronic homelessness.

===Hospitality Workforce Development===
This program area works with organizations in New Orleans to provide pathways for young people towards a career in the hospitality industry.

===Safe Water===
Working with international nonprofits and government agencies in Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Ghana, Mali, Niger and Uganda to build water systems.

===Young Children Affected by HIV and AIDS===
The program focuses on early childhood development globally and partners with international and local NGOs working in HIV prevalent communities in Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania and Zambia.

===Transitioning Programs===
In 2018, the Hilton Foundation announced it would transition out of four program areas (Avoidable Blindness, Catholic Education, Multiple Sclerosis, and Substance Use Prevention) over two to five years. The foundation committed to &quot;leave the field with minimal disruption&quot; and &quot;capture knowledge from our time in these areas to propel future innovations and solutions.&quot;

==Conrad N. Hilton Humanitarian Prize==
The Conrad N. Hilton Humanitarian Prize is awarded annually by the foundation. It was inaugurated in 1996 and is the largest humanitarian award in the world. Its annual award of USD1.5 million was increased in 2015 to 2 million to commemorate its 20th Hilton Humanitarian Prize laureate, Landesa.

He started working at the foundation in 1983 and served as its CEO from 2005 to 2015. Hilton retired as president and CEO, and was succeeded by Peter Laugharn. In his retirement announcement, Hilton said, “When I joined the Hilton Foundation in 1983, I couldn’t imagine the path that lay ahead. At that time, a handful of staff guided about $6 million in grants annually. Fast forward to today, and we have grown to a staff of over 50 and have awarded over a billion dollars in grants to improve the lives of disadvantaged and vulnerable people around the world.” Peter Laugharn began his tenure as president and CEO on January 1, 2016.

<doc id="1022009" wikidata="Q1713635" url="?curid=1022009" title="Jewish emancipation">
<text>Jewish emancipation was the process in various nations in Europe of eliminating Jewish disabilities, to which European Jews were then subject, and the recognition of Jews as entitled to equality and citizenship rights. It included efforts within the community to integrate into their societies as citizens. It occurred gradually between the late 18th century and the early 20th century.

Jewish emancipation followed after the Age of Enlightenment and the concurrent Haskalah, or Jewish Enlightenment. Various nations repealed or superseded previous discriminatory laws applied specifically against Jews where they resided. Before the emancipation, most Jews were isolated in residential areas from the rest of the society; emancipation was a major goal of European Jews of that time, who worked within their communities to achieve integration in the majority societies and broader education. Many became active politically and culturally within wider European civil society as Jews gained full citizenship. They immigrated to countries offering better social and economic opportunities, such as the United Kingdom and the Americas. Some European Jews turned to socialism, Zionism or both.

==Background==
Jews were subject to a wide range of restrictions throughout most of European history. The Fourth Council of the Lateran in 1215 which was enforced in some places required Jews to wear special clothing, such as the Judenhut and the yellow badge for Jews, to distinguish them from Christians. The practice of their religions was often restricted, and they had to swear special oaths. Jews were not allowed to vote, where voting existed, and some countries formally prohibited their entry, such as Norway, Sweden and Spain after the expulsion in the late 15th century.

In 1251 Béla IV of Hungary gave the Jews of the Kingdom equal rights and legal protection, which was an important step towards Jewish emancipation.

Jewish involvement in gentile society began during the Age of Enlightenment. Haskalah, the Jewish movement supporting the adoption of enlightenment values, advocated an expansion of Jewish rights within European society. Haskalah followers advocated &quot;coming out of the ghetto&quot;, not just physically but also mentally and spiritually.

In 1790, in the United States, President George Washington wrote a letter establishing that Jews in America would share full equal rights, including the right to practice their religion, with all other Americans. However, Jewish commentators observed that exclusion of Jewish citizens from political office occurred in a number of areas still in 1845. In fact, American Jewish citizens organized for political rights in the 1800s, and then for further civil rights in the 1900s.

On September 28, 1791, revolutionary France emancipated its Jewish population. The 40,000 Jews living in France at the time were the first to confront the opportunities and challenges offered by emancipation. The civic equality that the French Jews attained became a model for other European Jews. Newfound opportunities began to be provided to the Jewish people, and they slowly pushed toward equality in other parts of the world. In 1796 and 1834, the Netherlands granted the Jews equal rights with non-Jews. Napoleon freed the Jews in areas he conquered in Europe outside France (see Napoleon and the Jews). Greece granted equal rights to Jews in 1830. But, it was not until the revolutions of the mid-19th century that Jewish political movements would begin to persuade governments in Great Britain and Central and Eastern Europe to grant equal rights to Jews.

In English law and some successor legal systems there was a convention known as benefit of clergy (Law Latin: ) by which an individual convicted of a crime, through claiming to be a Christian clergyman (usually as a pretext; in most cases the defendant claiming benefit of clergy was a layperson) could escape punishment or receive a reduced punishment. In the opinions of many contemporary legal scholars, this meant that a Jew who had not renounced Judaism could not claim benefit of clergy. In England itself the practice of granting benefit of clergy was ended in 1827 but it continued further in other jurisdictions.

==Emancipation movements==
The early stages of Jewish emancipation movements were part of the general progressive efforts to achieve freedom and rights for minorities. While this was a movement, it was also a pursuit for equal rights. Thus, the emancipation movement would be a long process. The question of equal rights for Jews was tied to demands for constitutions and civil rights in various nations. Jewish statesmen and intellectuals, such as Heinrich Heine, Johann Jacoby, Gabriel Riesser, Berr Isaac Berr, and Lionel Nathan Rothschild, worked with the general movement toward liberty and political freedom, rather than for Jews specifically.

In 1781, the Prussian civil servant Christian Wilhelm Dohm published the famous script &quot;Über die bürgerliche Emanzipation der Juden&quot; (English: &quot;On the Citizen Emancipation of the Jews&quot;). Dohm disproves the antisemitic stereotypes and pleads for equal rights for Jews. To this day, it is called the &quot;Bible of Jewish emancipation&quot;.

In the face of persistent anti-Jewish incidents and blood libels, such as the Damascus affair of 1840, and the failure of many states to emancipate the Jews, Jewish organizations formed to push for the emancipation and protection of their people. The Board of Deputies of British Jews under Moses Montefiore, the Central Consistory in Paris, and the &quot;Alliance Israelite Universelle&quot; all began working to assure the freedom of Jews.

Jewish emancipation, implemented under Napoleonic rule in French occupied and annexed states, suffered a setback in many member states of the German Confederation following the decisions of the Congress of Vienna. In the final revision of the Congress on the rights of the Jews, the emissary of the Free Hanseatic City of Bremen, Johann Smidt – unauthorised and unconsented to by the other parties – altered the text from &quot;The confessors of Jewish faith are preserved the rights already conceded to them the confederal states&quot;, by replacing a single word, which entailed serious consequences, into: &quot;The confessors of Jewish faith are preserved the rights already conceded to them the confederal states.&quot; A number of German states used the altered text version as legal grounds to reverse the Napoleonic emancipation of Jewish citizens. The Prussian emissary Wilhelm von Humboldt and the Austrian Klemens von Metternich promoted the preservation of Jewish emancipation, as maintained by their own countries, but were not successful in others.

During the Revolutions of 1848, Jewish emancipation was granted by the Basic Rights of the Frankfurt Parliament (Paragraph 13), which said that civil rights were not to be conditional on religious faith. But only some German states introduced the Frankfurt parliamentary decision as state law, such as Hamburg; other states were reluctant. Important German states, such as Prussia (1812), Württemberg (1828), Electorate of Hesse (1833), and Hanover (1842), had already emancipated their Jews as citizens. By doing so, they hoped to educate the gentiles, and terminate laws that sought to oppress the Jews. Although the movement was mostly successful; some early emancipated Jewish communities continued to suffer persisting or new &quot;de facto&quot;, though not legal, discrimination against those Jews trying to achieve careers in public service and education. Those few states that had refrained from Jewish emancipation were forced to do so by an act of the North German Federation on 3 July 1869, or when they acceded to the newly united Germany in 1871. The emancipation of all Jewish Germans was reversed by Nazi Germany from 1933 until the end of World War II.

==Dates of emancipation==
In some countries, emancipation came with a single act. In others, limited rights were granted first in the hope of &quot;changing&quot; the Jews &quot;for the better.&quot;

==Consequences==

=== Emancipation, integration, and assimilation ===
The newfound freedom of Jews in places such as France, Italy, and Germany, at least during the Empire, permitted many Jews to leave the ghettos, benefitting from and contributing to wider society for the first time. Thus, with emancipation, many Jews&#x27; relationships with Jewish belief, practice, and culture evolved to accommodate a degree of integration with secular society. Where Halacha (Jewish law) was at odds with local law of the land, or where Halacha did not address some aspect of contemporary secular life, compromise was often sought in the balancing of religious and secular law, ethics, and obligations. Consequently, while some remained firm in their established Jewish practice, the prevalence of emancipated Jewry prompted gradual evolution and adaptation of the religion, and the emergence of new denominations of Judaism including Reform during the 19th century, and the widely practiced Modern Orthodoxy, both of which continue to be practiced by strong Jewish communities today.

Critics of the Haskalah lament the emergence of inter-religious marriage in secular society, as well as the dilution of Halacha and Jewish tradition, citing waning religiosity, dwindling population numbers, or poor observance as contributors to the potential disappearance of Jewish culture and dispersion of communities. In contrast, others cite antisemitic events such as the Holocaust as more detrimental to the continuity and longevity of Judaism than the Haskalah. Emancipation offered Jewish people civil rights and opportunities for upward mobility, and assisted in dousing the flames of widespread Jew-hatred (though never completely, and only temporarily). This enabled Jews to live multifaceted lives, breaking cycles of poverty, enjoying the spoils of Enlightened society, while also maintaining strong Jewish faith and community. While this element of emancipation gave rise to antisemitic canards relating to dual loyalties, and the successful upward mobility of educated and entrepreneurial Jews saw pushback in antisemitic tropes relating to control, domination, and greed, the integration of Jews into wider society led to a diverse tapestry of contribution to art, science, philosophy, and both secular and religious culture.

<text>The Spanish Communist Workers&#x27; Party (&quot;Partido Comunista Obrero Español&quot;) was a communist party founded on April 13, 1921 by the &quot;terceristas&quot;, including Virginia González Polo, Daniel Anguiano, Eduardo Torralba Beci, Manuel Núñez Arenas, Facundo Perezagua, Luis Mancebo, Isidoro Acevedo and Evaristo Gil, who had been trying to persuade the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PSOE) to join the Third International. When the PSOE Congress voted to join the Vienna International and refused Bolshevism, the &quot;terceristas&quot; broke away.

A new Communist Party of Spain was founded on November 14, 1921 through an act of merger of Partido Comunista Español and Partido Comunista Obrero Español. The unified PCE soon adhered to the Comintern.

<doc id="1022012" wikidata="Q2273355" url="?curid=1022012" title="Lambourn">
<text>Lambourn is a village and civil parish in Berkshire, England. It lies just north of the M4 Motorway between Swindon and Newbury, and borders Wiltshire to the west and Oxfordshire to the north. After Newmarket it is the largest centre of racehorse training in England, and is home to a rehabilitation centre for injured jockeys, an equine hospital, and several leading jockeys and trainers. To the north of the village are the prehistoric Seven Barrows and the nearby long barrow. In 2004 the Crow Down Hoard was found close to the village.

==History==
The most common explanation for the name of Lambourn refers to the lambs that were once dipped in the local river. Many spellings have been used over the centuries, such as Lamburnan (880), Lamburna (1086), Lamborne (1644) and Lambourne. It was also called Chipping Lambourn because of its popular market. The spelling was fixed as &#x27;Lambourn&#x27; in the early 20th century, but even today, towards Soley, three successive signposts at nearby junctions alternate the spelling of Lambourn and Lambourne. The village of Bockhampton was also known as Lower Lambourn.

In 2004 a metal detecting rally found a hoard of three gold bracelets and two armlets at Crow Down near Lambourn. They have been dated to 1200 BCE and are the only prehistoric gold objects to have been found in Berkshire. The hoard was declared a treasure under English Law in 2005 and is on display at the West Berkshire Museum in Newbury. In Roman times, the area was extensively farmed, as shown by an archaeological research project based on Maddle Farm. Ermin Street, the major Roman road between &quot;Calleva Atrebatum&quot; (Silchester) and &quot;Glevum&quot; (Gloucester), also known as the &quot;Upper or Baydon Road&quot;, passes through Lambourn Woodlands as part of the B4000.

===Seven Barrows===
Lambourn is famous for its Seven Barrows, just above Upper Lambourn. There are more than thirty Bronze Age burial mounds forming a large prehistoric cemetery. On a line west of the Seven Barrows is the Long Barrow, which dates from c. 4000 BCE, making it 2,000 years older than the other barrows. It has been half-destroyed by deep ploughing, and only the mound in the woods and a few sarsen stones remain.

===Lambourn Church (minster) and almshouses===


&quot;...the Downs themselves shelter Lambourn&#x27;s massive Norman nave.&quot;
The large, mainly Norman, Church of England parish church is in the village centre facing the historic market place, with a surrounding wall built of sarsen stones, and is dedicated to St Michael and All Angels. The road pattern shows an original circular enclosure, suggesting pagan Celtic origins. Alfred the Great, born in Wantage, was also closely connected with this ancient landmark. It has been a minster since Saxon times and officially known as Lambourn Minster since as early as 1032, and Alfred mentioned it in his will. It was probably Cnut who granted Lambourn Minster to the Dean of St Paul&#x27;s. 

Successors to that office held it until 1836. Inside are monuments to the great and the good of the many manors in the parish, including an excellent brass to John Estbury (1508), who founded the almshouses outside, and fine effigies of Sir Thomas Essex and his wife (1558). The almshouses were established by an Act of Parliament in the reign of King Henry VII and confirmed by his son King Henry VIII after the Dissolution of the Monasteries made the original uncertain, as it included a now forbidden chantry. There is an arch with mediaeval carvings of hunting scenes. The church was much restored in the late 19th century, and has a chancel roof designed by G. E. Street. The church also boasts a fine three-manual Henry Willis organ. The clock faces were replaced, and the tower stonework repaired, in 2011. The church is a Grade I listed building.

===The Anarchy===
The Empress Matilda bequeathed Lambourn and Chippenham to Hugh de Plucket out of the Royal demesne in 1142 for his aid in The Anarchy of the civil wars against the usurper Stephen of Blois. However, another Breton adventurer, Josce de Dinan and his knights, retreated to Lambourn after he lost Ludlow Castle to Gilbert de Lacey. Maltida&#x27;s son King Henry II gave him Chipping Lambourn in compensation in 1156. Josce died in 1162 AD and in either case, the Plunket family were in possession of the Manor by the beginning of the 14th century.

===Queen Elizabeth I===

The Ditchley portrait of Queen Elizabeth I was painted for Sir Henry Lee of Ditchley to commemorate her visit in 1592. The Queen stands on a map of England with her feet on Oxfordshire and Lambourn is shown (but not named) on the map below her feet, in the downs of Berceria at the head of the River Lambourn which joins the River Kennet at Newbury.

===Civil War===
During the Civil War, Prince Rupert and his Cavaliers rested at Lambourn on the night of 18 and 19 September 1643, between fighting a skirmish with the Parliamentarian Army at Aldbourne Chase on the 18th and the First Battle of Newbury on the 20th. Queen Henrietta Maria stayed at Kingswood House on 18 April 1644 en route to Exeter, having said her final farewell to her husband King Charles I a few days before at Oxford. Kingswood was an Elizabethan manor house that was demolished a long time ago and replaced by the current Kingswood House Stables.

On 9 November 1644 King Charles and the Royalist Army relieved Donnington Castle in the face of the Army of the Eastern Association led by the Earl of Manchester and Oliver Cromwell. Thereafter he withdrew to Lambourn and stayed in &quot;The King&#x27;s Chamber&quot; at Kingswood House, while the Royalist infantry were quartered in Lambourn and the cavalry at Wantage. The Parliamentarian Scoutmaster Sir Samuel Luke reported &quot;Monday. 11 November 1644. The last night the King&#x27;s headquarters were at Wantage and Lamborne ... all the foot that which lay at Lamborne marcht away this morning towards Auborne&quot;.

===The Luddites and Captain Swing===
There were Captain Swing anti-machinery riots in Lambourn in 1832–33. It was said that &#x27;there would be no good times at Lambourn until there was a good fire&#x27;, and several farm buildings were burned by Luddite agricultural labourers whose wages had been slashed by the introduction of machinery. The Marxist historian, Eric Hobsbawn, wrote &#x27;A threshing machine was broken at Lambourn; and from there the movement spread south to Eastbury and East Garston, where money was collected and several machines were destroyed&#x27;. The labourers demanded 40 shillings for their loss of earnings and an increase in wages from 8 shillings to 12 shillings a week. They threatened to burn down farm buildings if they were not paid. Ten machines were destroyed in the Lambourn Valley from Fawley to Boxford, and the movement spread northwards to the Vale of the White Horse and the Thames Valley.

===World War II plane crash===
On 8 September 1944 a stricken B-24 Liberator flown by 2nd Lt Lawrence Berkoff DFC of the 856th Bombardment Squadron, 492d Bombardment Group (the Carpetbaggers), Eighth Air Force, USAAF was returning from an aborted mission. Berkoff maintained control of the plane so that his crew could parachute to safety over Baydon, but saw that if he bailed out, the plane would crash into Lambourn. He therefore remained at the controls to divert the aircraft and was killed when it crash-landed in a field on Folly Road at 10:45 pm, missing the village by a few hundred yards. Berkoff was awarded a posthumous Distinguished Flying Cross; a plaque in his honour was unveiled on 26 June 2003 by his great nephew, Todd Berkoff, at Lambourn Memorial Hall.

===1953 lorry crash===
On Tuesday 13 April 1953 an articulated lorry carrying of aviation fuel suffered brake failure as it came down Hungerford Hill (now the B4000). Despite the best efforts of the driver, it hit several buildings before overturning on Oxford Street. The lorry exploded, destroying the tobacconist&#x27;s, confectioner&#x27;s, watchmaker&#x27;s, jeweller&#x27;s and antique dealer&#x27;s shops, but only the driver was killed. The burning fuel set fire to three houses, two thatched cottages and several flats, and 37 people were made homeless. It also flowed down the street and into the River Lambourn and set fire to property up to 50 yards way until the Newbury, Hungerford, Wantage, Swindon and Faringdon fire brigades helped the local brigade quench the fire.

===1971 lurcher show===
The first dog show for lurchers was held at Lambourn in 1971, which included dog racing and coursing.

===1991 motorway crash===
At 14:15 hours on Wednesday 13 March 1991 there was a major crash on the M4 Motorway in the southernmost part of Lambourn between the Membury Service Station and Junction 14 on the eastbound carriageway. A van driver fell asleep at the wheel and stopped alongside the central crash barrier on the right hand (overtaking) lane. This obstruction was seen by the car behind him, which managed to change lanes and avoid contact. However, the cars behind were travelling at high speed (an average of ) in patchy fog and many were only one or two car lengths behind the vehicle in front. As a result, they had no time to avoid the van, crashed and spun out of control into the other lanes. Others took evasive action by driving onto the hard shoulder and up the sides of the cutting.

These were followed by articulated lorries, one of which jack-knifed sideways across all three lanes of the motorway. One driver, Alan Bateman, managed to free himself from his car and ran back down the central reservation to warn others, but was ignored and was even hooted at by some drivers as they continued towards the crash. The crash included 51 vehicles and lasted 19 seconds, car fuel was ignited along with the combustible material being carried in one of the vans and the eastbound motorway was closed for four days as the melted wreckage was cut away and the tarmac replaced.

Ten people were killed and twenty-five were injured, and there were three minor crashes caused by distracted drivers on the other side of the motorway. In Parliament Sir Michael McNair-Wilson MP asked why the Thames Valley and Wiltshire police forces had not turned on the motorway warning lights to warn drivers of the fog, but the Secretary of State for Transport, Christopher Chope, stated that these were only used for hazards not readily apparent to drivers and not adverse weather conditions. The crash led to warning lights being used to warn drivers of fog on British motorways.

==Governance==
The civil parish of Lambourn has a population of 4,103. Besides Lambourn itself, it comprises the villages of Upper Lambourn, Eastbury, Woodlands St Mary and Lambourn Woodlands, together with the hamlets of Mile End, Sheepdrove and Bockhampton and a considerable area of rural downland. The civil parish is split into four wards for electoral purposes: Upper Lambourn, Eastbury and Woodlands St Mary/Lambourn Woodlands elect two councillors; and nine are elected from Lambourn itself. The parish shares boundaries with the Berkshire parishes of East Garston and Hungerford, with the Wiltshire parishes of Chilton Foliat, Ramsbury and Baydon, and with the Oxfordshire parishes of Ashbury, Compton Beauchamp, Woolstone, Uffington, Kingston Lisle, Sparsholt, Childrey and Letcombe Bassett. The parish is part of the unitary authority of West Berkshire, and lies within Newbury parliamentary constituency.

==Geography==


Lambourn covers most of the upper valley of the River Lambourn, a bourne in the chalk upland area of the Berkshire Downs. It is northwest of Newbury, southeast of Swindon, southwest of Wantage, north of Hungerford and west of London (via B4000 and M4). Since the 1974 boundary changes, Lambourn has been the westernmost parish in Berkshire, bordering northeastern Wiltshire and southwestern Oxfordshire. Membury Services, on the site of RAF Membury, Membury transmitting station and the northeastern quarter of Membury Iron Age hillfort are in the southwest corner of the parish.

===Lambourn Downs===
The Lambourn Downs (an area of the Berkshire Downs) are part of the North Wessex Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and cover an area of , from the Ridgeway in the north to the River Kennet in the south. Originally they were entirely in Berkshire, but northern third of the downs were transferred to Oxfordshire when the county border was reorganised in 1974. Due to the poor, chalky soil, the downs could not be used for growing crops until the advent of modern fertilisers. Consequently, the high ground was only used for breeding sheep – hence the name of Lambourn – and horses.

The Oxford don and author J. R. R. Tolkien lived nearby and travelled to the downs with his family and friends. He was impressed by the downs with their sarsen stones, barrows and hill forts and painted pictures of Lambourn in 1912. Within Lambourn parish are the following downs and chalk hills: Bockhampton Down, Cleeve Hill, Coppington Down, Coppington Hill, Crow Down, Eastbury Down, Ewe Hill, Farncombe Down, Fognam Down, Haycroft Hill, Hungerford Hill, Kingsdown, Lodge Down, Mandown, Near Down, Parkfarm Down, Pit Down, Post Down, Row Down, Stancombe Down, Thorn Hill, Warren Down and Wellbottom Down.

==Transport==
===Road===
Lambourn lies on the crossroads of the B4000 from Newbury to Highworth and the B4001 from Chilton Foliat to Childrey. The B4000 used to follow the River Lambourn up the Newbury Road until the construction of the M4 motorway in the early 1970s. When the motorway was built, the B4000 was diverted along Ermin Street as the old road could not be widened for HGVs in the narrow streets of Great Shefford, Eastbury and Lambourn. The B4001 was also diverted onto Ermin Street because of the M4, and the B4000 and B4001 merge until they arrive in Lambourn at the bottom of Hungerford Hill. The M4 passes through the southern part of the parish, between Junction 14, ( southeast of the village, and Junction 15, ( to the west.

===Rail===
In 1898 the Lambourn Valley Railway was built connecting Lambourn to Newbury. Its ownership merged with the Great Western Railway in 1905. The line continued in operation until it was closed in 1960. The nearest station is now at Hungerford on the Reading to Taunton line.

==Economy==
Lambourn and the surrounding downland is best known today as a major horse racing centre, mainly National Hunt. Many villagers&#x27; work is related to horse racing, but there are an increasing number of commuters who use the M4, including many airline pilots based at Heathrow. The United Kingdom&#x27;s last makers of dress and day cravats were based in Lambourn until they closed in 2006. Lambourn Racehorse Transport was founded in the village in 1930 and transports many of the local horses, especially since the closure of the Lambourn Valley Railway in 1964. It is owned by Merrick Francis, the son of Dick Francis, and is the largest horse transport business in Europe. Sheepdrove Organic Farm is based near Lambourn.

===Horse racing===

The racing connection began in the 18th century, when the Earl of Craven held racing meetings on Weathercock Hill near Ashdown House. There were regular race meetings on the Lambourn Downs and private race meetings can be held on Mandown between Upper Lambourn and Seven Barrows. In the 1840s some owners moved their racehorses to Lambourn as the ground at Newmarket was too firm and caused many horses to break down. The first trainers were Edwin Parr, Joseph Saxon, John Prince, Luke Snowden (one of the few trainers to be buried at St Michaels graveyard) and John Drinkald, who went insane when his horse was disqualified after winning a race in which he stood to win £28,000.

The first stables were at the Red Lion Inn on the crossroads opposite the church (the inn has since been converted into flats), and at Lambourn Stables, now called Kingswood House Stables. The well drained, spongy grass, open downs and long flats made Lambourn ideal for training racehorses and it became a fashionable training centre. Lord Rothschild had his stables at Russley Park, just west of Lambourn in Wiltshire, and, like those of Lord Craven, his horses practised on the gallops at Lambourn. Lambourn Place, a large house near the village centre, was used as racing stables from 1888. It was demolished in 1938 and was later replaced by a modern housing estate. 

It was not until the Lambourn Valley Railway was built in 1898 that Lambourn grew into its present size. Until then horses could only attend local meets, or had to walk the 10–15 miles to the railway at Newbury. Horses could now be transported to Newbury and from there to meetings all over the country, and many new stables were opened in the area. Over 1,500 horses are now stabled in and around Lambourn – second only to Newmarket. There are many major stables and varied turf and all-weather gallops in and around the village. It has two fully licensed equine swimming pools and the Ridgeway Veterinary Group Valley Equine Hospital. As a result, it has been dubbed the &quot;Valley of the Racehorse&quot;, and this is displayed on the road signs leading into the village.

In 2006 the Jockey Club Estates Ltd bought of land in the valley, its first investment outside Newmarket, including Mandown and many other gallops and training grounds The Oaksey House rehabilitation centre for injured jockeys was built in Lambourn in 2008, named after Lord Oaksey, the President of the Injured Jockeys Fund. In 2013, Mehmet Kurt, the owner of the Kingwood Stud in Lambourn, received permission to build a long horse training monorail, the first in the country.

<text>Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park (officially Kawartha Highlands Signature Site) is a area of preserved wilderness and recreational areas in south-central Ontario, Canada. It is located to the north and east of the main belt of the Kawartha Lakes, primarily in the township of North Kawartha. It is the largest single area of preserved land in the southern part of the province (excluding Algonquin Park, parts of which are in northern and southern Ontario).

== Geography ==
The park was expanded from its original size of to its current size in June 2003. It was previously a mostly wilderness tract enclosing Bottle Lake and Sucker Lake, and accessible primarily by canoe, many by portage routes only. It now encloses many more small lakes as well as all of Anstruther Lake, and has many cottages and access roads.

Municipally, the park is completely within Peterborough County: about two-thirds of its area is in the township of North Kawartha, and the remaining western portion is in the township of Trent Lakes. The park office is located offsite in Bancroft, Ontario, and co-located with the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources.

== Recreation ==
The park officially became operational in May 2011 and ministry permits for camping and parking are now required. Campsites are designated and provided with picnic tables, fire rings and thunder boxes. Official Ontario Parks maps indicate the park boundaries and exclude small tracts of land which contain pre-existing cottages. Additionally, some cottages on Serpentine and Copper Lakes remain without owning land and continue to use motor boats.

<text>The Spanish Communist Workers&#x27; Party (, PCOE) is an anti-revisionist Marxist-Leninist communist party in Spain. It was founded in 1973, when Enrique Líster (a Republican general in the Spanish Civil War) revolted against the Eurocommunist line of Communist Party of Spain (PCE) general secretary Santiago Carrillo. The party published &quot;Análisis&quot;.

==History==
A catalyst for the split was the condemnation by the PCE of the Soviet intervention in Czechoslovakia in 1968. PCOE was legalized in 1977, during the Spanish transition to democracy. Its sister organisation in Catalonia was the Partit Comunista Obrer de Catalunya. PCOE had a youth organization called the Communist Youth Federation of Spain (&quot;Federación de Jóvenes Comunistas de España&quot;).

In the 1983 regional elections in the Valencian Community, PCOE obtained 6,416 votes (0.34%). It had an electoral pact with Partido Comunista de España Unificado ahead of the regional elections in Madrid of the same year. When PCEU and other groups unified themselves as the Communist Party of the Peoples of Spain, PCOE chose not to participate in the merger.

===Reintegration in the PCE and split===
In 1985, the majority faction, led by Enrique Lister, decided to dissolve the party and rejoin the PCE, in a congress where the 10,000 members of the PCOE were represented. The majority of the members followed Lister and rejoined the PCE; however, a minority faction decided that they weren&#x27;t going to join the PCE and kept the party alive, although severely weakened. Today, the party publishes &quot;Teoría Socialista&quot; and &quot;Análisis&quot;.

The continued PCOE contested the 2015 Spanish elections, fielding candidates in two constituencies (Córdoba and Sevilla), and gaining 1,906 votes in total, and also competed in the 2016 Spanish general election, again only fielding candidates in Córdoba and Sevilla. In 2018, the party contested the Andalusian regional election, competing in the constituencies of Córdoba (975 votes, 0,26%) and Sevilla (2,230 votes, 0,25%).

At the April 2019 Spanish election, the PCOE improved its election results compared to 2016. The party contested eight constituencies and gained 9.094 votes.

In 2021, the PCOE is forming the Coalition for Communist Unity with the PCPE in the Madrid regional election.

<text>Stretch Arm Strong (Also known as Stretch Armstrong) is a hardcore punk band from Columbia, South Carolina, and the flagship band for We Put Out Records. They were primarily active from 1992 to 2005. They are often mistaken as a Christian band for having been on Solid State Records, but as lead singer Chris McLane has stated in interviews, “we&#x27;re not a Christian band, we never were a Christian band and we never professed to be a Christian band.” Vocalist Chris McLane appears on Zao&#x27;s &quot;The Lesser Lights of Heaven&quot; DVD. In 2020, the band was announced to perform at Furnace Fest 2020.

== History ==
Stretch Arm Strong formed in 1992, formed by vocalist James Miller, bassist Matt McCarty, guitarists David Sease and Scott Dempsey, and drummer John Barry. Miller departed quickly thereafter, with McCarty taking over vocals as well as bass. The four would record some material, with Chris McLane taking over bass duties. McCarty would leave the band, with McLane taking over vocals and Donnie Raines joining the band on bass. The band would release their debut album, &quot;Compassion Fills the Void&quot;, with Shawn Williams of Prevail on bass. After their first release on Uprising Records, &quot;Compassion Fills the Void&quot;, the band would sign with Solid State Records, consisting of the lineup of McLane, Sease, Dempsey, Barry, and Jeremy Jeffers on bass.

In 1999, the band recorded their sophomore album, &quot;Rituals of Life&quot;, which saw their debut on Solid State Records. With the album out, the band released a music video for their song &quot;Second Chances&quot;. In 2001, the band began writing and recording their third album, which would be titled &quot;A Revolution Transmission&quot;. In 2003, the band released &quot;Engage&quot;, which would be their third and final album with Solid State and their fourth studio album, which was well received. Stretch Arm Strong signed to We Put Out Records, a label on East West (an imprint of the Warner Music Group), having fulfilled their deal with Solid State. Their most recent album, &quot;Free at Last&quot;, was recorded in April and May 2005 with James Paul Wisner and released late that same year. A video for the song &quot;The Sound of Names Dropping&quot; was released that year. In 2005, the band shared the stage with the famed funk musician George Clinton. 

They have mostly been inactive since 2005, reuniting in 2009 for a few benefit shows with Evergreen Terrace and Bane and for a one-off show at Within These Walls in 2011. The band is set to reunite for Furnace Fest in 2021.

In early 2022, Stretch Arm Strong announced that they had partnered with Iodine Recordings to re-issue &quot;Rituals of Life&quot; and other titles from their catalog. The band also alluded to writing new music.

<doc id="1022041" wikidata="Q4892257" url="?curid=1022041" title="Berkshire Downs">
<text>The Berkshire Downs are a range of chalk downland hills in southern England, part of the North Wessex Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The Berkshire Downs are wholly within the traditional county of Berkshire, although split between the current ceremonial counties of Berkshire and Oxfordshire. The western parts of the downs are also known as the Lambourn Downs.

== Geography ==
The Berkshire Downs run east–west, with their scarp slope facing north into the Vale of White Horse and their dip slope bounded by the course of the River Kennet. Geologically they are continuous with the Marlborough Downs to the west and the Chilterns to the east. In the east they are divided from the Chilterns by Goring Gap on the River Thames. In the west their boundary is generally taken to be the border between Berkshire and Wiltshire, although the downs in Wiltshire between the Berkshire border and the valley of the River Og are sometimes considered to be part of the Berkshire Downs.

== History ==
English downland has attracted human habitation since prehistoric times. The ancient track known as the Ridgeway runs along the Berkshire Downs. Prehistoric sites in the Downs include Wayland&#x27;s Smithy (Neolithic), numerous tumuli (Neolithic or Bronze Age), Uffington White Horse (Bronze Age), Liddington Castle and Uffington Castle (Bronze Age and Iron Age), and Segsbury Camp and Grim&#x27;s Ditch (Iron Age).

 It is generally thought that in Anglo-Saxon times the downs were known as &quot;Æscesdūn&quot; or Ashdown, and that it was here that the Battle of Ashdown was fought in 871.

In 1915, after a brief stint as a hospital orderly at the British hospital for French soldiers in Haute-Marne, John Masefield moved to his country retreat at Lollingdon Farm. The setting at the foot of the Downs - Masefield&#x27;s &quot;Lollingdon Downs&quot; would inspire a number of poems and sonnets.

== Economy ==
Downland pasture is firm and well drained, suited to grazing sheep and grazing and training horses. Horse racing is a major business in the area, with much of the downs covered with training areas, and stables centred on the village of Lambourn.

== Railway links ==
The Berkshire Downs can be accessed from various cities via the Great Western Main Line and its current single operator runs localised stopping trains as well as the high-speed trains along the Vale of White Horse calling at major stops and . From to trains run along the Reading to Taunton Line in the River Kennet Valley to reach Devon on the quickest route from London. From there are the scenic Thames Valley stations of , Goring &amp; Streatley and (linked to the Cholsey and Wallingford Railway).

<doc id="1022047" wikidata="Q875712" url="?curid=1022047" title="Leizhou Peninsula">
<text>The Leizhou Peninsula, alternately romanized as the Luichow Peninsula, is a peninsula in the southernmost part of Guangdong province in South China. As of 2015, the population of the peninsula was 5,694,245. The largest city by population and area on the peninsula is Zhanjiang.

==History==
Trade was once welcoming at cities of Leizhou Peninsula. During the 19th century, the area was a hotbed of piracy, many pirates, such as Zheng Yi and Wu Shi Er, were based in the area.

==Geography==
The Leizhou Peninsula is the third largest peninsula in China with an area of c.  located on the southwestern end of Zhanjiang, Guangdong with the Gulf of Tonkin to the west and the 30 km wide Qiongzhou Strait to the south, separating the peninsula from Hainan Island.

Geologically, basalt terraces account for 43% of the peninsula&#x27;s area. The rest is divided up between marine terraces (27%) and alluvial plains (17%). Leizhou Peninsula is dotted with a few dormant volcanoes, beaches, and low-lying diluvial plains.

Leizhou has two separate volcanic fields: a Pleistocene–Holocene field at the northern end of the peninsula west of Zhanjiang &quot;Leibei Huoshanqun&quot;) and the northern end of the Qionglei or Leiqiong volcanic field, which extends across the strait into northern Hainan &quot;Leinan Huoshanqun&quot;). The volcanoes derive from the east-to-west tectonic extension and thinning of the lithosphere connected with the creation of the South China Sea&#x27;s basin. Two Pleistocene-era basaltic stratovolcanoes are Yingfengling and Tianyang apart in the center of the peninsula. There is also a third volcanic field responsible for some of the islands offshore &quot;Huoshanyan Daoyu&quot;).
==Wildlife==
Hepu National Sanctuary of Dugongs was created west of the peninsula to protect endangered wildlife especially marine mammals. Vicinity to the peninsula, such as the Leizhou Bay has declared to be parts of the Chinese white dolphin sanctuary holding the second largest population in the nation. Dugongs still occur in small number. Some Bryde&#x27;s whales, minke whales, and whale sharks still occur in the adjacent waters including Hainan Island and Gulf of Tonkin waters such as off Tieshangang District, Islands of Weizhou and Xieyang.

Critically endangered whales such as North Pacific right whales and western gray whales, humpback whales, and blue whales were once known to occur around the peninsula in the winter and spring to calve. Waters such as Wailuo Harbor were ideal habitats for these giants. These whales were heavily hunted and were wiped out by Japanese whalers in this regions. (Japanese whalers established whaling stations at various sites along the Chinese and Korean coasts including on the island of Hainan and at Daya Bay).

==Climate==
The peninsula lies in tropical South China. The region is under the influence of continental northeastern monsoons and maritime southeastern and southwestern monsoons. Typhoons occasionally occur, both from the Pacific Ocean and the South China Sea. Annual precipitation is .

<doc id="1022050" wikidata="Q7699920" url="?curid=1022050" title="Tenko (TV series)">
<text>Tenko is a television drama series co-produced by the BBC and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), which was broadcast between 1981 and 1985.

The series dealt with the experiences of British, Australian and Dutch women who were captured after the Fall of Singapore in February 1942, after the Japanese invasion, and held in a fictional Japanese internment camp on a Japanese-occupied island in the Dutch East Indies in modern day Indonesia between Singapore and Australia (the actual location of the island is not revealed in the series but it is assumed that the fictitious locations are set in south east Sumatra). Having been separated from their husbands, herded into makeshift holding camps and largely forgotten by the British War Office, the women had to learn to cope with appalling living conditions, malnutrition, disease, sexual violence and death.

==Background==

&quot;Tenko&quot; was created by Lavinia Warner after she had conducted research into the internment of nursing corps officer Margot Turner (1910–1993) for an edition of television programme &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; and was convinced of the dramatic potential of the stories of women prisoners of the Japanese. Aside from the first two episodes, set in Singapore, which were written by Paul Wheeler, the series was written by Jill Hyem and Anne Valery. War hero and prisoner of war Margaret Thomson was consulted about the series but she did not like to talk about her experiences and never watched the programmes.

Owing to high production costs, only the first two episodes of the first series were filmed on location in Singapore, together with the post series reunion extended episode. For the majority of series 1 and 2, set in the camp, the programme was filmed in a specially constructed set in Dorset. Hankley Common was also used.

The series takes its name from the Japanese word &quot;tenko&quot; () which means &quot;roll-call&quot;. POWs and internees in Japanese-run camps had regular roll-calls, where they had to line up and number off or were counted in Japanese.

A total of thirty episodes were produced over three series between 1981 and 1984, followed by a one-off special (which was twice the length of the other episodes), &quot;Tenko Reunion&quot;, in 1985. Only Ann Bell, Stephanie Cole and Claire Oberman appeared in all thirty episodes plus the reunion.

===Series One (1981)===

Ten fifty-minute episodes broadcast 22 October to 24 December 1981.

The first series depicts the events leading up to the fall of Singapore to the invading Japanese forces in 1942, and the abortive evacuation of civilians from the city. As the war in Europe suddenly erupts into a world war, a group of British and Dutch women find themselves forced to cope with captivity in a Japanese internment camp. They also must find a way to live together as a community, breaking down the barriers of class and race between them, if they are to survive.

Marion Jefferson is enlisted as the leader of the women due to her husband being a colonel. Sylvia Ashburton learns to see past race when she begins to bond with Christina Campbell. Dorothy Bennet suffers the loss of her infant daughter, Violet, due to malnutrition. A pregnant Sally Markham suffers the tragedy of stillbirth. Sally then grows close to nurse Nellie Keane, and rumours begin to circulate about their intimacy.

In the last episode of the series, the women celebrate Christmas before being marched through the jungle to another camp.

===Series Two (1982)===

Ten fifty-minute episodes broadcast 21 October to 23 December 1982.

The second series continues with the women marching through the jungle and being split up before they arrive at a new camp, an old mission school, on New Year&#x27;s Day 1943. Tensions arise as the internees are forced to adhere to the new regime implemented by the strict and fierce official interpreter, Miss Hasan.

After a joyous reunion with old friend, Lillian, Marion is forced to take a back seat as the women&#x27;s official leader in favour of the overbearing wolf in sheep&#x27;s clothing, Verna Johnson. Sally sinks into depression following the death of her husband and vows to take her own life. Dorothy continues to trade favours with the guards, teaching English to Shinya in exchange for cigarettes and later discovers that she is pregnant. Sister Ulrica vows to not speak in order to repent for her feelings of hate towards the Japanese. Blanche returns later in the series, as does Yamauchi, as he is promoted to Major and becomes the new commander. Rose escapes to meet Bernard but they are caught when one of the women informs Yamauchi.

As conditions in the camp worsen, the women take a stand against Verna and Miss Hasan but they are prevented from exposing them when an allied plane bombs the camp.

===Series Three (1984)===

Ten fifty-minute episodes broadcast 7 October to 16 December 1984.

The third series starts just before the end of the war in early August 1945 and the internees are in their third camp and are living under appalling and harsh conditions with Marion Jefferson once again being leader of the group and the remaining prisoners of the camps are told by Yamauchi that the war has ended. They are later liberated by Allied troops and travel to Singapore. Billeted at Raffles, the women are free. However, peacetime only brings further dilemmas for the women as they struggle to forge new futures in an uncertain new world.

Marion struggles as she assumes the role of the &quot;colonel&#x27;s wife&quot; which causes friction between Clifford and herself. Joss strikes up a relationship with Stephen. Maggie and Dorothy become embroiled in a love triangle with the handsome rogue, Jake.

===Tenko Reunion (1985)===

A double-length special was broadcast on 26 December 1985.

Set in 1950, Marion organises for the women to reunite in Singapore five years after their liberation from the camp. After an evening at Raffles Hotel, the women plan to continue their celebrations the following day at the residence of &#x27;Metro Goldwyn&#x27; van Meyer but they are interrupted by the infiltration from mercenaries in search of weapons and ammunition, leading to a shocking revelation about one of the women.

==Main cast list==

==DVD release and books==
All three series plus the Reunion Special were released in one DVD box-set in 2011 through Acorn Media UK.

Three paperback books were published in the 1980s. One covering the first series, titled Tenko, while a second called Last Tenko, covered the second and final series. The third book, written by Anne Valery, covered the Reunion.

A book about the making of Tenko called &quot;Remembering Tenko&quot; by Andy Priestner was published in October 2012.

<text>Pablo Cesar Amaringo Shuña (January 21, 1938 – November 16, 2009) was a Peruvian artist, renowned for his intricate, colourful depictions of his visions from drinking the entheogenic plant brew ayahuasca. He was first brought to the West&#x27;s attention by Dennis McKenna and Luis Eduardo Luna, who met Pablo in Pucallpa while traveling during work on an ethnobotanical project. Pablo worked as a vegetalista, a shaman in the mestizo tradition of healing, for many years; up to his death, he painted, helped run the Usko-Ayar school of painting, and supervised ayahuasca retreats.

Before dying, he was working on the paintings of angels, as well as paintings documenting the flora and fauna of Peru.

== Film ==
Pablo&#x27;s work can be seen in the documentary film &quot;Ayahuasca Nature&#x27;s Greatest Gift&quot;.

== Book ==
When Luna and McKenna met Amaringo in 1985, he was living in poverty, barely surviving by teaching English to young people from his home and selling the odd painting to passing tourists. Luna suggested he paint some of his visions, a project which became the basis of a coauthored book, &quot;Ayahuasca Visions: The Religious Iconography of a Peruvian Shaman&quot; (North Atlantic Books 1999).

Amaringo occasionally gave interviews in the years following the book&#x27;s publication, and later penned the preface for &quot;Plant Spirit Shamanism: Traditional Techniques for Healing the Soul&quot; (Destiny Books 2006). His artwork was featured in Graham Hancock&#x27;s book &quot;Supernatural&quot;. Amaringo also appeared in &quot;The Shaman &amp; Ayahuasca: Journeys to Sacred Realms&quot; (2010), Michael Wiese&#x27;s documentary film about ayahuasca.

== Death ==
After a protracted illness, Amaringo died on November 16, 2009.

<text>The Combat Vehicle Reconnaissance (Tracked) (CVR(T)) is a family of armoured fighting vehicles (AFVs) developed in the 1960s and is in service with the British Army and others throughout the world. They are small, highly mobile, air-transportable armoured vehicles, originally designed to replace the Alvis Saladin armoured car.

Designed by Alvis in the 1960s, the CVR(T) family includes Scorpion and Scimitar light reconnaissance tanks, Spartan armoured personnel carriers (APC)s, Sultan command and control vehicle, Samaritan armoured ambulance, Striker anti–tank guided missile vehicle and Samson armoured recovery vehicle. All members of the CVR(T) family were designed to share common automotive components and suspension; aluminium armour was selected to keep the weight down. By 1996, more than 3,500 had been built for British Army use and export.

Scorpion, Scimitar, and Striker have now been withdrawn from British Army service.

==Design and development==
In the early 1960s, the United Kingdom&#x27;s overseas commitments were proving costly to garrison and were a drain on the defence budget. A new strategy was proposed, that troops and equipment would be airlifted to trouble-spots from their bases in Europe. To support the air-landed troops, a requirement was identified for an AFV that could provide fire support with an anti-armour capability and be light enough to be airportable by the projected Armstrong Whitworth AW.681. At the same time, consideration was being given to the replacement of the Saladin armoured car.

In 1960, work began on what was called the &quot;Armoured Vehicle Reconnaissance&quot;. The vehicle would mount a 76 or 105 mm main gun in a limited-traverse turret, which also housed the three-man crew; namely: driver, gunner and commander. The anti–armour capability would be met by a Swingfire missile system (then under development) mounted at the rear. The design would come in both tracked and wheeled versions and share the same engine and transmission as the FV432 armoured personnel carrier. The final weight of the prototype was over 13 tons, which exceeded the weight limit if it was to be transported by air.

To reduce weight, aluminium alloy armour – using AA7017 made to Alcan E74S specification (Al + Zn 3.9; Mn 2.6) – was originally selected instead of steel; research revealed that it provided greater protection from artillery shell-splinters because of its areal density. However, this alloy suffered from stress corrosion cracking over time, especially around the gun mantlets of the Scimitar, and an improved specification armour (AA1707 made to MVEE-1318B with strict quality control) was fitted from 1978.

To fit inside the transport aircraft of the time, the vehicle&#x27;s height had to be less than , its width had to be less than . To meet the ground pressure requirement of five psi, the tracks had to be wide. The width also dictated the engine used – it had to fit next to a driver in full winter clothing. Thus the engine compartment could only be wide. No tank engines in production or development at the time were suitable, so the Jaguar 4.2-litre petrol engine was used. This was modified to use military-grade fuel, with a compression ratio lowered from 9:1 to 7.75:1 and a single Solex Marcus carburettor, resulting in a power output reduction from 265 bhp to 195 bhp.

The driver position, being located at the front of the vehicle alongside the engine, dictated that the turret would have to be at the rear. The fire support version, armed with a 76 mm gun, was named Scorpion as the rear-mounted turret suggested a sting in the tail. Following the example of Alvis predecessor vehicles Saladin, Stalwart (load carrier) and Saracen (personnel carrier), all CVRTs started with the letter &#x27;S&#x27;. The other vehicles were named to reflect their function; Striker anti–tank guided weapons, Spartan armoured personnel carrier; Samaritan ambulance; Sultan command and control and Samson recovery vehicles. In addition, the British General Staff had requested another vehicle armed with a 30 mm cannon, which became Scimitar.

In 1967, Alvis was awarded the contract to produce 30 CVR(T) prototypes. Vehicles P1–P17 being the Scorpion prototypes, P18–P30 were prototypes of the other six CVR(T) versions. Having to work under strict cost limitations imposed by the Ministry of Defence, the first prototype was completed on time and within budget on 23 January 1969, after extensive hot and cold weather trials in Norway, Australia, Canada and Abu Dhabi. In May 1970, the CVR(T) was accepted into British Army service; a contract was agreed for 275 Scorpions and 288 Scimitars. The first production Scorpion being completed in 1971, initial delivery to the British Army was in January 1972.

By 1986, the United Kingdom had taken delivery of 1,863 CVR(T)s. Total production for the British Army was 313 Scorpions, 89 Strikers, 691 Spartans, 50 Samaritans, 291 Sultans, 95 Samsons and 334 Scimitars.

===Life Extension Programme===
In 1988, Alvis plc was awarded a £32 million contract to carry out a Life Extension Programme (LEP). The initial contract was for 200 CVR(T)s and supply kits for a further 1,107 vehicles. The LEP was carried out on the Scimitar and Sabre reconnaissance vehicles, Spartan APCs, Sultan command post vehicles, Samson recovery vehicles, Samaritan ambulances and the Striker anti-tank vehicle. The major part of this upgrade was the replacement of the Jaguar 4.2-litre petrol engine by a more fuel efficient Cummins BTA 5.9 diesel engine.

A second contract for 70 vehicles was divided between Alvis and the Army Base Repair Organisation (ABRO). ABRO was then contracted to upgrade about 600 of the remaining CVR(T)s to the LEP standard.

Alvis also offered a comprehensive upgrade for the export version of the CVR(T), which included a diesel engine, upgraded suspension, new track and vision enhancements. Brunei is the only country known to have returned vehicles for an overhaul.

===Battle Group Thermal Imaging programme===
In 2001, Thales Optronics won the contract for the Battle Group Thermal Imaging (BGTI) programme. The contract will replace the image intensification sights installed on British Army Scimitar and Royal Engineers Spartan vehicles. They were replaced by a new gunner&#x27;s sight with a day thermal image and laser rangefinder sight. The vehicle commander will have a monitor and a map display and the driver a navigation capability.

==Variants==

===Scorpion===
The FV101 Scorpion was originally developed to meet a British Army requirement for the Combat Vehicle Reconnaissance (Tracked). Scorpion was accepted by the British Army in May 1970, with a contract for 275, which later rose to 313 vehicles. Main armament consisted of a low velocity 76mm main gun with a coaxial 7.62 mm GPMG and multi-barrelled smoke grenade dischargers. The first production vehicles were completed in 1972. The first British regiment to be equipped with the Scorpion was the Blues and Royals (Royal Horse Guards and 1st Dragoons) in 1973.

In November 1981, the RAF Regiment took delivery of the first of 184 Scorpions and other variants of CVR(T). These were to be used for airfield defence and served at RAF bases in the United Kingdom, Germany and Cyprus. The 76mm gun was ideal for the role, especially the canister round, which could be used on base against attacking personnel whilst minimising the risk to aircraft and infrastructure due to its short range. The RAF Regiment tranche of vehicles is understood to have originally been part of an order for Iran, but which were not delivered following the revolution that overthrew the Shah. The vehicles differed by having no wading equipment, and the vehicle commander&#x27;s cupola on the RAF Regiment Spartan was a different design from that of British Army variants.

British Scorpions were withdrawn from service in 1995, principally because of the toxicity hazard in the crew compartment caused when the main armament was fired. In addition, RAF Bomb Disposal (EOD) teams used Scimitar and Spartan. Their protection and mobility allowed the teams to move around airfields that had unexploded ordnance (UXO) and CBRN contamination. The 30mm main armament on the Scimitar could be used to detonate the UXO or to crack the case of a bomb to allow the contents to drain or to deflagrate.

===Striker===

The FV102 Striker was the anti-tank guided missile version of the CVR(T), which was armed with the Swingfire missile system. Striker had five missiles ready to fire in a mounting at the rear of the vehicle, with another five stowed inside. Secondary armament consisted of a commander&#x27;s 7.62 mm GPMG and multi-barrelled smoke grenade dischargers. Striker looked very similar to Spartan in appearance, becoming more easily identifiable only when the missile tubes were raised. In mid 2006, the British Army had 48 Strikers in service, although they were in the process of being phased out as the Swingfire missile was replaced by the Javelin in mid–2005.

===Spartan===

The FV103 Spartan is a small armoured personnel carrier (APC); it can carry seven men in all, the crew of three and four others in the rear compartment. In the British Army, it is used to carry small specialised groups, such as engineer reconnaissance teams, air defence sections and mortar fire controllers. In mid-2006, the British Army had 478 Spartans in service, which from 2009 were being replaced by the Panther Command and Liaison Vehicle in some roles.

===Samaritan===
The FV104 Samaritan is the ambulance version of the CVR(T), 50 were produced for the British Army. In appearance it is similar to the Sultan Command and Control vehicle. It has a crew of two and capacity for four stretchers; being an ambulance it is not armed except for multi-barrelled smoke grenade dischargers.

===Sultan===

The FV105 Sultan is the British Army command and control vehicle based on the CVR(T) platform, 205 were in service in 2006. It has a higher roof than the APC variants, providing a more comfortable &quot;office space&quot; inside. A large vertical map board and desk are located along one side, with a bench seat for three people facing it. Forward of this are positions for the radio operator, with provision for four radios, and the vehicle commander. Armament consists of a pintle-mounted GPMG and multi-barrelled smoke grenade dischargers. The back of the vehicle is designed to be extended by an attached tent to form a briefing area.

===Samson===

The FV106 Samson is an armoured recovery vehicle. The hull of the Spartan was adapted to contain a winch, which was operated to the rear of the vehicle. A hinged spade anchor was designed in two-halves to preserve access to the rear door.

===Scimitar===
The FV107 Scimitar is very similar to the Scorpion but carries the 30mm RARDEN cannon as its main weapon. Secondary armament consists of a coaxial GPMG and multi-barrelled smoke grenade dischargers. Stowage is provided for 201 rounds of 30 mm and 3,000 rounds of 7.62 mm ammunition. In 2006, the British Army had 328 in service; which were retired from active service in 2023, being replaced by Ajax.

===Sabre===
The Sabre was a hybrid vehicle, with the turret from a Fox Armoured Reconnaissance Vehicle on a FV101 Scorpion hull and armed with the same 30mm RARDEN cannon as the Scimitar. One hundred and thirty-six of these hybrid vehicles were brought into service in 1995, after some modifications were made to the turret. These modifications included redesigning the smoke grenade dischargers, replacing the standard machine gun with an L94A1 chain gun and domed hatches to improve headroom for the commander and gunner. They were assigned to the reconnaissance platoons of armoured and mechanised infantry battalions. They were also issued to Yeomanry squadrons in the Territorial Army to replace their Scimitar CVR(T) vehicles which were requisitioned by the Regular Army Medium Reconnaissance Regiments and others to replace the Scorpion CVR(T), which was being withdrawn from service. Sabre was withdrawn from service in 2004.

===Sturgeon and Salamander===
Sturgeon (based on the Spartan) and Salamander (based on the Scorpion) are visually modified vehicles used to represent opposing forces in training exercises at the British Army Training Unit Suffield in Canada.
==Stormer==
The Alvis Stormer was originally designed in the 1970s as a private venture APC, using the CVR(T) range as a starting point. It is a larger ( longer with a 6th set of road wheels) and heavier (12,700 kg) vehicle with steel and aluminium armour. Production began in 1982. Malaysia ordered 25 of the APC variant.

In 1986, the British Army selected Stormer to carry the Starstreak missile anti–aircraft system and a flatbed version fitted with the Shielder minelaying system.

BAE Land Systems, the descendant of Alvis military vehicles, market Stormer with various weapon systems for many purposes. Indonesia has received about 50 Stormer variants, including the APC, command post vehicle, ambulance, recovery, bridge-layers and logistics vehicle. Malaysia has 35, Oman has four and the United Kingdom has over 170.

==Service history==

===United Kingdom===

In British Army service, the CVR(T) was mainly used by the Formation reconnaissance regiments, which have been the Household Cavalry, 1st Queen&#x27;s Dragoon Guards, 9th/12th Royal Lancers, Light Dragoons, Queen&#x27;s Royal Lancers, the Royal Yeomanry and the Queen&#x27;s Own Yeomanry. Scimitars were also used by one of the four squadrons in an armoured regiment and the reconnaissance platoons of armoured infantry battalions.

In August 1974, Scorpions from A Squadron 16th/5th The Queen&#x27;s Royal Lancers, were transported by C-130 Hercules to Cyprus, to protect the British Sovereign Base Areas during the Turkish invasion.

During the Falklands War in 1982, two troops from B Squadron, Blues and Royals were attached to the task force. They were equipped with four Scorpions and four Scimitars supported by a Samson and were the only armoured vehicles used in action by the British Army during the conflict. The two troops deployed provided fire support for the 2nd Battalion, The Parachute Regiment during the Battle of Wireless Ridge and for 2nd Battalion Scots Guards during the Battle of Mount Tumbledown.

By the time of the Gulf War, the CVR(T) was well established in the British Army and all versions were deployed. The divisional reconnaissance regiment attached to the 1st Armoured Division was the 16th/5th The Queen&#x27;s Royal Lancers, (with 36 Scimitars, 16 Strikers, 12 Spartans, 9 Sultans and 4 Samaritans), and &#x27;A&#x27; Squadron 1st Queen&#x27;s Dragoon Guards (16 Scorpions, 4 Spartans, 2 Sultans, 1 Samaritan, 1 Samson). This unit also had 1 Sqn RAF Regiment (Operating Scorpion, Spartan, Sultan &amp; Samsons ) attached to them. The armoured regiments and armoured infantry battalions reconnaissance troops also had eight Scorpions or Scimitars each.

The CVR(T) family were deployed with the British Army&#x27;s formation reconnaissance regiments– part of the NATO Implementation Force (IFOR), a multinational force in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The next deployment for the British Army&#x27;s CVR(T)s was the 2003 invasion of Iraq (Operation Telic). The initial force contained the 1st Queen&#x27;s Dragoon Guards and D Squadron, the Household Cavalry, both equipped with CVR(T).

After Iraq, CVR(T) equipped formation reconnaissance regiments have taken part in Operation Herrick in Afghanistan, notably during Operation Panther&#x27;s Claw with the Light Dragoons.

===Europe===

Four other European countries used CVR(T): Belgium, Ireland, Latvia and Spain.

The Belgian Army ordered 701 EA CVR(T) in the Scorpion, Scimitar, Sultan, Spartan and Samaritan versions, which were delivered in 1975. They were used by the COMRECCE that comprised the 1st, 2nd and 4th Mounted Rifles Regiments (also the 3rd Lancers, which was equipped with the Leopard 1 tank), the CVR-T group (Armoured Recce school) and all of the scout platoons from the 12EA armoured Infantry and 8EA Tank Regiments. The Belgian Army used its CVR(T) vehicles on UN deployments in the Balkans and Somalia. Belgium had disposed of all its CVR(T)s by 2004.

The Spanish Marines obtained 17 Scorpions in 1985. All had been disposed of by 2004.

The Irish Army obtained a small number of Scorpions for use by the Irish Army Cavalry Corps. As the United Kingdom, Belgium and Spain have all disposed of their Scorpions, Ireland was the sole user of the type during the last decade in Europe until they were retired in 2014.

The Latvian army has obtained 123 ex-British Army Scimitar, Sultan, Spartan, Samson and Samaritan vehicles. According to the contract, all the vehicles will be modernised and overhauled. First deliveries to the Latvian Land Forces will commence in September 2015. Some of these vehicles will be used as mobile platforms for 4th generation Spike anti-tank guided missile systems. In December 2019 Latvia signed a treaty to receive additional 82 CVR(T) vehicles. Later that number was reduced to 74.

In September 2024 Latvia announced it will donate an unknown number of their CVR(T) vehicles to Ukraine.

===South and Central America===
In South and Central America, CVR(T) operators included Chile, Honduras and Venezuela.

The Chilean Army has 28 Scorpions, which are used in a reconnaissance role alongside Leopard 1 and Leopard 2 tanks.

The Venezuelan Army operates a fleet of 50 Scorpion 90s and two Sultans.

===South East Asia and the Pacific===
In South East Asia and the Pacific, CVR(T) operators included Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines and New Zealand.

Brunei is understood to have a fleet of 19 CVR(T)s, which comprises 16 Scorpions, two Sultan command post variants and one Samson armoured recovery vehicle.

The Indonesian Army uses the Scorpion 90 armed with the Belgian 90mm Cockerill cannon and the Stormer. The Stormer variants include the APC, command post vehicle, ambulance, recovery, bridge-layers and logistics vehicle.

The Malaysian Royal Armoured Corps of the Malaysian Army is known to use both Scorpion and the newer Stormer.

The Royal Thai Army was forced to expand its forces after the fall of South Vietnam and the increased tension in the area. As part of this expansion, they obtained 144 Scorpions between 1973 and 1976.

The Philippine Army operated up to 40 Scorpions in its Light Armor Division. This formation used a mixture of wheeled and tracked vehicles, but the Scorpion was the only fire support or anti-armour vehicle in their inventory. They also operated 6 Samaritans and 3 Samsons.

The New Zealand Army operated a small number of Scorpions, up to squadron strength. These have now been replaced by the LAV III.

===Middle East===
In the Middle East, CVR(T) operators included Iran, Jordan, Oman and the United Arab Emirates.

The Iranian army deployed its Scorpions with the reconnaissance regiment of the 28th Infantry Division in the 1980–1988 Iran–Iraq War. Little is known of how they performed or what losses they incurred. In December 1997, it was reported that Iran had manufactured a light tank named Tosan. Tosan was equipped with a 90 mm gun and appears to be based on the Scorpion.

The Royal Jordanian Land Force has obtained 80 Scorpions and 100 Spartans. Some of the Scorpions are reported to have been captured by Iraq during the Iran–Iraq war and handed on to Jordan. The Spartans were obtained when Belgium disposed of their CVR(T) fleet.

The Royal Army of Oman replaced the Saladin armoured car with between 30 and 50 Scorpions. They were delivered between 1982 and 1983, along with three Samson armoured recovery vehicles. In 1985, a second order for up to 30 vehicles was delivered. The second order included Scorpion, Sultan, Spartan and Samson vehicles. Oman operates the newer Stormer.

The United Arab Emirates Army has obtained 76 Scorpions for use by its armoured brigades. It is not known if these played any part in the Gulf War.

===Africa===
In Africa, CVR(T) operators included Botswana, Nigeria, Tanzania and Togo.

The Nigerian Army reorganised from an infantry to an all arms formation after 1979. Part of their AFV inventory includes an unknown number of Scorpions.

==Scorpion turret on other vehicles==

The Australian Army did not use the CVR(T), but did use the Scorpion turret – mounted on the FMC M113 armoured personnel carrier – as the Medium Reconnaissance Vehicle, or M113A1 MRV. (These complemented the previous M113 Fire Support Vehicle (FSV), which featured a Saladin turret.) Introduced in the early 1970s, the last MRV was retired during the early 2000s, replaced by the ASLAV. 

Philippine Army infantry units also later received M113A1s that had been augmented with Scorpion turrets. In Philippines service, these are known as the M113A1 Fire Support Vehicle (FSV). 

The Canadian Army added the Scorpion turret to the AVGP Cougar wheeled reconnaissance vehicle. A total of 195 Cougars was originally procured, but the fleet was reduced to 100 vehicles in 1999, and has since been retired.

==Enhancements and future developments==
As a result of combat experience in Afghanistan, the British Army upgraded several Scimitar light tanks to Mark 2 standard. The improvements included a new aluminium hull based on that of the Spartan troop carrier, which provides greater internal volume and protection, and a new fuel system, environmental control system and suspension. New hulls have also been built for the Spartan, Sultan, Samson and Samaritan variants.

The British firm OVIK has designed a vehicle named &quot;Meerkat&quot; based on the CVR(T), anticipating that large numbers of these will become available for refurbishment in future years when they are replaced in British service, and perhaps several other armed forces. The hull has been redesigned, and the driver has been moved back into a central position – sitting side by side with his primary crewman. The vehicle is steered using a conventional steering wheel system – which can be swapped from left to right – to allow either crewman to drive or command the vehicle. The engine has been replaced by a Cummins 6.7-litre diesel engine whilst the transmission has been uprated to DB TN15E+ and STORMER final drives. The turret has been replaced by a modular weapon &quot;cassette&quot; that will mount remote weapon stations, armed with, for example, a .50&quot; M2 HB machine gun.

Another British consortium claims to have designed and developed a concept that uses a common tracked chassis with interchangeable pods for different vehicle roles. The Mark 1 mPODt (multi-role POD (tracked)) uses the Stallion, a flat bed development similar to that used on Shielder, to demonstrate the concept on a 10–13 tonne weight vehicle. However, the chassis could be from a number of in-service vehicles.

<text>The FV101 Scorpion is a British armoured reconnaissance vehicle and light tank. It was the lead vehicle and the fire support type in the Combat Vehicle Reconnaissance (Tracked), CVR(T), family of seven armoured vehicles. Manufactured by Alvis, it was introduced into service with the British Army in 1973 and was withdrawn in 1994. More than 3,000 were produced and used as reconnaissance vehicles or light tanks. 

It held the Guinness world record for the fastest production tank, recorded doing at the QinetiQ vehicle test track in Chertsey, Surrey, on 26 January 2002.

==History==
The CVR(T) family of vehicles came from a British Army requirement for an armoured fighting vehicle that could be rapidly airlifted to trouble spots. The Armoured Vehicle Reconnaissance was supposed to carry both a gun and an anti-tank missile but it was not possible to design an air portable vehicle to the specification. The limits on both size and weight led to the use of aluminium alloy for the hull and an adapted car engine for propusion. The anti-tank capability was given to a dedicated vehicle, Striker, while what became Scorpion would use a 76 mm gun in the fire support role. 

In 1967, Alvis was awarded the contract to produce 30 CVR(T) prototypes. Vehicles P1–P17, the Scorpion prototypes, were delivered on time and within the budget. After extensive hot and cold weather trials in Norway, Australia, Abu Dhabi and Canada, the Scorpion was accepted by the British Army in May 1970, with a contract for 275, which later rose to 313 vehicles. The first production vehicles were completed in 1972 and the first British regiment to be equipped with the Scorpion were the Blues and Royals of the Household Cavalry in 1973. 
Alvis built more than 3,000 Scorpion vehicles for the British Army, Royal Air Force Regiment and the export market. All of the CVR(T) vehicles were to be air-portable; and two Scorpions could be carried in a Lockheed C-130 Hercules. Another requirement of the CVR(T) project was the low ground pressure, similar to that of a soldier on foot; this would serve it well in the boggy conditions of the Falklands War.

===Armament===

The Scorpion was armed with the low velocity 76 mm L23A1 gun, which could fire high-explosive, HESH, smoke and canister rounds. Storage was provided for 40 or 42 rounds. A 7.62 mm coaxial L7 GPMG (3,000 rounds carried) was also fitted, as were two multi-barrelled smoke grenade dischargers, one on each side of the turret. The main armament has an elevation of 35 degrees and a depression of 10 degrees; the turret has a full 360-degree traverse. The traverse was however hand-cranked, a cost-saving feature that made the turret relatively slow and laborious to traverse relative to other vehicles of its type. This gun was later deemed to be unsatisfactory, as RAF testing showed that the lack of a fume extraction system caused toxic fumes to enter the fighting compartment, endangering the crew&#x27;s health.

Some Scorpions used the Cockerill Mk3 90mm gun instead. This weapon could fire the following rounds:

* APFSDS: muzzle velocity 1210 m/s; projectile mass 2.5 kg; penetration 100 mm RHA @ 60 degree obliquity
* HE-T: muzzle velocity 714 m/s; projectile mass 5.1 kg with 1.1 kg of filling; 
* HEAT-T: muzzle velocity 890 m/s; projectile mass 4.1 kg; penetration 250 mm of RHA @ 0 degree obliquitiy 
* HESH-T: muzzle velocity 800 m/s; projectile mass 4.5 kg with 1.2 kg of filling

===Engine===
The original engine was the Jaguar J60 Mk 100b 4.2-litre petrol engine, which was replaced by a Cummins or Perkins diesel engine. The maximum speed was about and it could accelerate from standing to in 16 seconds. The maximum speed on water (with the flotation screen deployed) was . The Irish engineering company IED replaced the Jaguar engine in Irish Army Scorpions with a Steyr M16 TCA HD engine (6-cylinder, 145 kW), making Irish Scorpions more powerful and more reliable in critical environments.

===Armour===
The FV101 was a very light armoured vehicle, weighing in at a mere 8 tonnes. This meant some compromises had to be made on protection. The vehicle had 12.7 mm of sloped aluminium armour on both the front and sides, giving an average effective thickness of 25 mm. 

The FV101 had all-around protection from shell fragments and 7.62 mm rounds, and the heavily sloped frontal arc was designed to be resistant to 14.5 mm rounds fired from . The initial manufacture of the aluminium armour resulted, after time and effects of the environment, in failure; stress corrosion cracking (SCC) which seriously affected all early builds.

===Other systems===
The vehicle was fitted with a nuclear, biological, chemical protection system, image intensification sights for gunner and driver and a floatation screen. A commode was located under the commander&#x27;s seat. An internal water tank and a boiling vessel for cooking and heating water were also provided.

==Service history==
The Scorpion has been used by the armed forces of Belgium, Botswana, Brunei, Chile, Honduras, Iran, Indonesia, Ireland, Jordan, Malaysia, New Zealand, Nigeria, Oman, Philippines, Spain, Tanzania, Thailand, Togo, the United Arab Emirates, and Venezuela. The Iranian army acquired 250 Scorpions in the late 1970s and a number of them are still in use after being refurbished locally as the Tosan tank. Scorpions were on occasion deployed to main UK airports as a show of force against possible terrorist threats, e.g., Operation Marmion at Heathrow Airport in 1974. Similar operations in 2003 used the then-current Scimitar.

===Combat use===
B Squadron, Blues and Royals were airlifted and deployed into the Akrotiri and Dhekelia Sovereign Base areas, during the Turkish invasion of Cyprus 1974.

Two troops from B Squadron, Blues and Royals served in the Falklands War. One troop was equipped with four Scorpions, the other with four FV107 Scimitars. These were the only armoured vehicles used in action by the British Army during the conflict. Scorpions also served in the Gulf War. The 16th/5th The Queen&#x27;s Royal Lancers deployed in the first Gulf War (Operation Granby) using all variants of the CVR(T) range carrying out the role of force reconnaissance for the British spearhead towards Iraq, operating forward of other official green army units. The 1st The Queen&#x27;s Dragoon Guards, a reconnaissance regiment, had 32 and the close reconnaissance troops of the armoured regiments each had eight. They were also used by No. 1 Squadron RAF Regiment, which was attached to the British 1st Armoured Division.

===Foreign users===
The Botswana Defence Force, the Iranian Army and the Nigerian Army continue to use Scorpions, in some cases up-armed with the 90 mm Cockerill.

The Iranian army used its Scorpion tanks in the Iran–Iraq War, with various degrees of success. Early in the war, Iranians used the Scorpions&#x27;s &quot;accurate fire&quot; (alongside the Cobra attack helicopters) to hold back Iraqi 2nd Infantry Division&#x27;s offensive towards the city of Ilam.
However, the Scorpions proved less effective when faced with Iraq&#x27;s 9th Armoured Division:

A second [Iraqi] column rushed to Susangerd, which it crossed without encountering any resistance, the city having apparently been left defenseless. The column continued in the direction of Hamidiyeh. It came into contact with the [Iranian] 92nd Armored Division&#x27;s reconnaissance regiment, which met it with effective in-depth defense. Yet the Iranians eventually had to yield in the face of Iraqi pressure. Their Scorpions&#x27; 90 mm guns did not hold their weight against the T-62 tanks&#x27; 115 mm guns. The Iraqis thus took control of Hamidiyeh, then Bozorg.

The British government provided Iran (and Iraq) with limited parts for their Scorpions during the war:

Regarding military matters, the British government imposed two strict rules: contracts signed before the war would be honored, but the sale of equipment likely to significantly increase either side&#x27;s military capacities was banned. Interpreting these regulations loosely, the British government delivered both the Iranians and the Iraqis motors and spare parts for Chieftain and Scorpion tanks, which would allow the former to maintain tanks acquired under the Shah and the latter to repair tanks captured from the Iranian army.

==Variants==

*Prototype of the Scorpion with dummy turret.
* Scorpion 90: The Scorpion 90 or Scorpion 2 was a version armed with the long-barrelled Cockerill Mk3 M-A1 90mm gun designed for the export market.
* AVGP Cougar: The Scorpion turret was mated with the MOWAG Piranha I chassis to create the AVGP Cougar fire support vehicle, which was used by the Canadian Armed Forces.
* Sabre: The Scorpion has been withdrawn from British Army service and the refurbished hulls have been mated with surplus turrets from the FV 721 Fox CVR(W) wheeled reconnaissance vehicle to form a composite vehicle—the Sabre reconnaissance vehicle.
* Salamander: A small number of converted Scorpions are in use at British Army Training Unit Suffield in Canada as part of OPFOR. With the main armament barrel replaced with a dummy they represent 125mm gun armed T-80-type vehicles.
Turret only
* M113A1 MRV

During the late 1960s, as a result of its experiences in the Vietnam War, the Australian Army perceived a need for a hybrid, tracked fire support and reconnaissance vehicle.

Experiments in which existing M113 APCs were fitted with Saladin (not Scorpion) turrets, wielding a 76 mm M1 gun, were successful. The vehicle entered service as the M113A1 FSV (Fire Support Vehicle). 

A very similar, subsequent vehicle, attaching the turret from the Scorpion to the M113, was also known as the FSV. (This re-purposing of the turret was to be the only use of any part of the Scorpion by the ADF.) Entering service in 1976, it was later redesignated the M113A1 Medium Reconnaissance Vehicle (MRV). Its development also obviated interest in acquiring brand new, purpose-built vehicles (such as a variant of the UK CVR(T) or the M2/M3 Bradley). All of these vehicles were retired in 1996.

==Operators==


===Current operators===

* : 25 units. Purchased second-hand from Belgium and retrofitted with diesel engines as requested by Botswana.
* : 16 units
* : 27 units; currently 15 in service in the Chilean Marine Corps. Ex-British vehicles which have been re-engined with diesel motors.

* : 120 Units. Scorpion light tanks replaced the Saladin armoured car. Deliveries were carried out in several stages and included Sultan, Spartan and Samson vehicles as well as a command vehicle built on the Stormer chassis, and which were to be used in units alongside Oman&#x27;s Chieftain main battle tank. The Omani vehicles are equipped with external mounting points for fuel cans and special mud flaps designed to suppress the amount of dust kicked up during travel. The NBC filtration system and heaters were removed and replaced with an air conditioning system and the vehicles received a warning siren indicating engine overheating. The hull floor was also reinforced with a 20 mm plate for increased mine resistance.
* : Philippine Army: Original delivery of 41 units delivered, 7 units currently active and assigned to Armor &quot;Pambato&quot; Division, to be replaced by the Sabrah light tank.
** Philippine Presidential Security Group - 4 Units 
* : 100 units

* : 12 units. Includes one FV106 Samson, one FV104 Samaritan and one FV105 Sultan.
* : 76 units, several of which were upgraded with the Pilkington Optronics TLS (Tank Laser Sight) from the Chieftain tank.
* : 78 Scorpion 90s, four to six FV104 Samaritans, two FV105 Sultans and four FV106 Samsons. The vehicles were ordered in 1988 with a contract value of US$85 MM with a stipulation for diesel engines; delivery was realized in 1992.

===Former operators===
* : 701 units (this total consists of all seven variants of the CVR(T)). Ordered in 1971 based on studies that showed the light tank was most suitable for the nation&#x27;s topography; Belgium was the second nation to adopt the Scorpion following the British Army. First deliveries commenced in February 1973 with the vehicles assembled in Mechelen from knock-down kits supplied from the United Kingdom. The order was filled in 1980. Between 1981 and 1983, both Scorpion and Scimitar models were upgraded with mounting points for add-on armour modules, an on-board armour repair kit and other minor improvements to enhance crew comfort and ergonomics. Thirty-six Scorpions were later sold to Botswana in 1994.
* : Limited number captured from Iran during Iran–Iraq War
* : 14 units.
* : Purchased 26 units of the Scorpion 90 in 1981 equipped with smoke grenade launchers from Wegmann, in addition to 25 Stormers (12 of which were supplied with a Helio FVT900 turret armed with a 20 mm cannon and 7.62 mm coaxial machine gun and 13 vehicles received a Thyssen-Henschel TH-1 turret armed with twin 7.62 mm machine guns).
* : 26 units. Ordered between 1982 and 1983; the vehicles lack NBC protection, night vision sights and do not have provisions for erecting flotation screens. The engines were upgraded with electronic fuel injection and US-made radios. In the second half of the 1980s, New Zealand opted to use the turrets to upgrade their M113 armoured personnel carriers. Served with Queen Alexandra&#x27;s Mounted Rifles among other units.

<doc id="1022092" wikidata="Q392795" url="?curid=1022092" title="Elephants' graveyard">
<text>An elephants&#x27; graveyard (also called elephant graveyard, elephant&#x27;s graveyard, or elephants&#x27; cemetery) is a place where, according to legend, old elephants instinctively direct themselves when they reach a certain age. According to this legend, these elephants would then die there alone, far from the group. However, there is no evidence in support of the existence of the elephants&#x27; graveyard.

==Origin==
Several theories have been proposed to explain the origin of this myth. One theory involves people finding groups of elephant skeletons together, or observing old elephants and skeletons in the same habitat. Others suggest the term may spring from group die-offs, such as one excavated in Saxony-Anhalt, which had 27 &quot;Palaeoloxodon antiquus&quot; skeletons. In that particular case, the tusks of the skeletons were missing, which indicated either hunters killed a group of elephants in one spot, or else opportunistic scavengers removed the tusks from a natural die-off. 

Other theories focus on elephant behavior during lean times, suggesting starving or elderly elephants who have worn their teeth down to a point that they can no longer chew tougher foods gather in places where finding food is easier, and subsequently die there. Prolific elephant hunter Walter &quot;Karamojo&quot; Bell discounted the idea of the elephant&#x27;s graveyard, stating that bones and &quot;tusks were still lying about in the bush where they had lain for years&quot;.

== Popular culture ==
The idea of an elephant graveyard first appeared in popular culture with Sir Rider Haggard&#x27;s &quot;The Ivory Child&quot; (1916), the twelfth of the eighteen Allan Quatermain adventures.

The idea of a graveyard for elephants was popularized in films such as &quot;Trader Horn&quot; and MGM&#x27;s Tarzan films, in which groups of greedy explorers attempt to locate the elephants&#x27; graveyard, on the fictional Mutia Escarpment, in search of its riches of ivory.

Disney&#x27;s 1994 animated musical film &quot;The Lion King&quot; has a reference to this motif, as well as its musical adaptation, video game adaptation, and the 2019 remake of the film.

==Derivative meanings==
* In geology, &quot;elephants&#x27; graveyard&quot; is an informal term for a hypothetical accumulation of &quot;large blocks of country rock stoped from the roofs of batholiths&quot;. 
*In military settings, it is sometimes used as a slang term to describe postings or assignments for senior officers for whom there is no potential for further promotion.
* In Spain, the Spanish Senate is often criticised as a &quot;cementerio de elefantes&quot; where politicians who have lost their previous positions end up doing no productive work.
* It is a term for the offices and a secretary provided to former high-ranking executives of large companies (at least in the United States), who have either retired or resigned. An executive who relinquishes or is relieved of authority becomes a consultant (special adviser) where they continue to receive a salary and an office under their contract but have little or no actual responsibilities until their non-compete agreement expires.
Additionally the term &quot;elephants&#x27; graveyard&quot; has been deliberately used in a symbolic fashion to refer to specific paleontological sites, such as the elephant-fossil deposit that René Jeannel, professor at the French National Museum of Natural History, discovered during a Kenya &amp; Ethiopia expedition in 1932.

<text>The McIntyre system, or systems as there have been five of them, is a playoff system that gives an advantage to teams or competitors qualifying higher, by allowing higher qualified teams to lose more games or series before being eliminated compared to lower qualified teams. The systems, which include four-team, five-team, six-team and eight-team variants, were developed by Australian lawyer, historian and English lecturer Ken McIntyre, with the first system developed for the Victorian Football League in 1931.

The four-team and five-team variants in particular are widely used in Australian sports, and the four-team variant – also known as the Page playoff system – enjoys some wider use globally.

== In the VFL/AFL ==
The first McIntyre system, the Page–McIntyre system, also known as the Page playoff system or McIntyre final four system, was adopted by the VFL in 1931, to replace the &quot;amended &quot;Argus&quot; systems&quot; that had operated since 1902.

McIntyre also devised the McIntyre final five system for the VFL for 1972, the McIntyre final six system for 1991 (which was revised for 1992) and the McIntyre final eight system for the 1994 season.

The AFL and its fans grew dissatisfied with some of the outcomes the McIntyre final eight system might allow, and replaced it with another final eight system in 2000.

== Other competitions ==
McIntyre finals systems are used prominently throughout Australia. Most Australian rules football leagues, from professional down to suburban, use a McIntyre finals system. The New South Wales Rugby League/National Rugby League has used the McIntyre final four and final five at different times throughout its history, and used the McIntyre final eight system from 1999 until 2011. The Page–McIntyre system is also used in the ANZ Championships (netball), the Australian Baseball League and Women&#x27;s National Basketball League. It was also used in the A-League (soccer) before that competition expanded its finals series to a top-six format. It is also used in the Indian Premier League (cricket).

Under the name Page playoff system, the McIntyre final four is commonly used in softball and curling events, especially in Canada. The system was also used in the Rugby League National League Three in Great Britain for the 2004 season.

A hybrid version of the Page–McIntyre system has been in used the Big Bash League in Australia since the 2019–2020 season, the difference between the original version and the hybrid version is a fifth game is played between 4th and 5th placed team playing in an elimination final with the winner playing 3rd in the first semi-final, a game that is usually played between 3rd and 4th in the original version of the system.

In North America, since 2021, it has been used as the preliminary round of the NBA Playoffs as a &#x27;play-in tournament&#x27; to determine the seventh and eighth seeds for the main playoff tournament, with seeds 7 and 8 playing, then seeds 9 and 10, with the winner of the 7/8 game being the seventh seed, and the loser of the 7/8 game and winner of the 9/10 game competing for the eighth seed.

== The systems ==
=== Page–McIntyre system ===
The Page–McIntyre system features four teams. In the first round of the Page–McIntyre system, the highest-two-ranked teams play each other, with the winner going straight through to the grand final and the loser going through to the preliminary final. The lowest-two-ranked teams play each other, and the winner advances to the preliminary final. The winner of preliminary final gets through to the grand final. In this system, the top two teams are able to lose a match and still qualify for the grand final, this is referred to as a &#x27;double chance&#x27;.

Assuming that each team has an even chance of winning each match, the probability for both the highest-ranked teams winning the competition is 37.5%, compared to 12.5% for the third and fourth placed teams.

=== McIntyre final five system ===
As its name states, the McIntyre final five system features five teams. From the second round the McIntyre final five system is the same as the Page–McIntyre system; however, in the first round the lowest-two-ranked teams play to eliminate one team and the second and third-ranked teams determine which match they will play in the second round. The highest-ranked team has a bye in the first round.

In this case, if all teams have an even chance of winning each match, the highest-ranked team has a 37.5% chance, ranks two and three have a 25% chance and the lowest-two-ranked teams have a 6.25% chance of winning the competition.

=== First McIntyre final six system ===

The first McIntyre final six system was also the same as the Page–McIntyre system from the second round. In this case, two of the four-lowest-ranked teams are eliminated in the first round, while the top two determine which match they will play in the second round. Under this system the top two teams receive a double chance, as does the winner of match B.

=== Second McIntyre final six system ===

This adaptation of the first McIntyre system corrected for the anomaly that, in the first week, the team who finished 4th would have a more difficult opponent than the team who finished 5th, and was hence more likely to be eliminated, despite finishing higher. This was achieved by adding flexibility to the second round draw, so that the two elimination final winners were re-ranked to determine which played the winner of the qualifying final and which played the loser.

However, both McIntyre final six systems had another weakness: the loser of the qualifying final (which is the most difficult game of the first round), ended up facing elimination in the first semi-final, while the higher-ranked elimination final winner (who has had the easiest game of the first round) has a double chance in the second semi-final.

=== McIntyre final eight system ===

The McIntyre final eight bears little in common with the other McIntyre systems. At no stage does it follow the Page–McIntyre structure, and at no stage after the first week does any team retain a double chance. The system allows for 26 of the 28 combinations of the eight finalists to feature in the grand final (the two combinations not possible are 1st v 7th and 2nd v 8th). It gives 18.75% to 1st and 2nd, 15.625% to 3rd, 12.5% to 4th and 5th, 9.375% to 6th and 6.25% to 7th and 8th.

<text>In biology, monoclonality refers to the state of a line of cells that have been derived from a single clonal origin. Thus, &quot;monoclonal cells&quot; can be said to form a single clone. The term &quot;monoclonal&quot; comes .

The process of replication can occur &quot;in vivo&quot;, or may be stimulated &quot;in vitro&quot; for laboratory manipulations. The use of the term typically implies that there is some method to distinguish between the cells of the original population from which the single ancestral cell is derived, such as a random genetic alteration, which is inherited by the progeny.

Common usages of this term include:
* Monoclonal antibody: a single hybridoma cell, which by chance includes the appropriate V(D)J recombination to produce the desired antibody, is cloned to produce a large population of identical cells. In informal laboratory jargon, the monoclonal antibodies isolated from cell culture supernatants of these hybridoma clones (hybridoma lines) are simply called &quot;monoclonals&quot;.
* Monoclonal neoplasm (tumor): A single aberrant cell which has undergone carcinogenesis reproduces itself into a cancerous mass.
* Monoclonal plasma cell (also called plasma cell dyscrasia): A single aberrant plasma cell which has undergone carcinogenesis reproduces itself, which in some cases is cancerous.

<text>Rufus Anderson (August 17, 1796 – May 23, 1880) was an American minister who spent several decades organizing overseas missions.

==Personal life ==
Rufus Anderson was born in North Yarmouth, Maine, in 1796. His father, also named Rufus Anderson, was Congregationalist pastor of the church in North Yarmouth. His mother was Hannah Parsons. He graduated from Bowdoin College in 1818, and from Andover Theological Seminary in 1822, and was ordained as a minister in 1826. He married Eliza Hill (1804–1880) on January 8, 1827.

==Career in missions==
He worked at the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM) as an assistant while studying at Andover. In 1822 he applied to go to India but was asked to remain at headquarters and later appointed assistant secretary. In 1832 he was given total responsibility for overseas work as a Secretary of the ABCFM. In this capacity, he corresponded with missionaries from around the world.

He traveled in Latin America (1819,1823-1824), the Mediterranean and Near East (1828-1829, 1843–1844), India, Ceylon, Syria, and Turkey (1854-1855), and Hawaii (1863). During the winter of 1843–1844, he visited the ABCFM&#x27;s mission stations in Turkey.

He resigned as ABCFM secretary in 1866 but continued on the ABCFM Prudential Committee until 1875. From 1867 to 1869 he delivered at Andover seminary lectures on foreign missions. In 1868 Dartmouth college conferred upon him the degree of LL.D., and he was made a fellow of the American Oriental society.

== Theology of missions ==
Anderson believed that &quot;missions are instituted for the spread of a scriptural self-propagating Christianity&quot;. Missions were for:
* converting lost men,
* organizing them into churches,
* giving these churches a competent native ministry,
* conducting them to the stage of independence and (in most cases) of self-propagation.
Anything beyond this, he felt, was secondary. The end of the mission was to be &quot;a scriptural, self propagating Christianity&quot; the test of which is seen in evidence of a religious life, a genuine change in the church and the individual.

He wrote that Bible translation, literature, schools, press and all other activities should be directed to building a mature local church which evangelized and sent out others as missionaries. He also prohibited any mission becoming engaged with a government or engaging in any kind of business. He advocated cooperation with other societies to avoid the waste of people and money. To Anderson, civilization was not a legitimate aim of the mission but would come as an impact of the gospel, this went against the nature of mission in his time which started with civilization of the natives.

The missionary was not to be a pastor or ruler but an evangelist, moving on to the next place as soon as possible; their business was with unbelievers, not believers. The society existed solely to help the missionary discharge their duty rather than making them a servant. Native ministers were to be the spiritual leaders.

Though there is dispute as to who wrote about the idea first, the &quot;three-self&quot; method is attributed to both Anderson and Henry Venn. They both wrote about the need for creating churches in the missions field that were self-supporting, self-governing, and self-propagating.

He published several books, as well as many articles in &quot;The Missionary Herald&quot;. He is remembered in Sri Lanka for shutting down American Ceylon Mission&#x27;s popular Batticotta Seminary because it was not converting enough locals to Christianity.
He traveled from Boston to the Hawaiian Islands in 1863, crossing the Panama Isthmus by rail, later describing the trip in a book. After retiring in 1866 wrote a history of the missions there.

He died in 1880 in Boston and was buried in Forest Hills Cemetery after a funeral at Eliot Congregational Church.
His son Edward Anderson became a chaplain in the American Civil War.

<text>Roland Allen (29 December 1868 – 9 June 1947) was an English missionary to China sent by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel (SPG).

==Early life==

He was born in Bristol, England, the son of an Anglican priest; but was orphaned early in life. He was educated at Bristol Grammar School and after winning a scholarship to study at St. John&#x27;s College, Oxford, Allen also studied at the (Anglo-Catholic) Leeds Clergy Training School.

==Career==
Allen was ordained a deacon in 1892 and priest the following year. Allen spent two periods in Northern China working for the SPG. The first, from 1895 to 1900, ended due to the Boxer Rebellion, during which Allen was forced to flee to the British Legation in Beijing. He was a chaplain to community throughout much of the siege. After a period back in England, he returned to North China in 1902, but was forced home due to illness. These early experiences led him to a radical reassessment of his own vocation and the theology and missionary methods of the Western churches’.

Allen became an early advocate of establishing Churches that from the beginning would be self-supporting, self-propagating, and self-governing, adapted to local conditions and not merely imitations of Western Christianity. These views were confirmed by a trip to India in 1910 and by later research in Canada and East Africa. With this background, Allen wrote his book &quot;Missionary Methods&quot;, which was first published in 1912. It is possible that his thought was influenced in part by the earlier primitivist writings of Anthony Norris Groves and by the Brethren movement.

Allen&#x27;s approach to mission strategy for indigenous churches is based on the study of Saint Paul’s missionary methods, as he was convinced that he found in them the solution to most of the difficulties of the day. He believed recognition of the church as a local entity and trust in the Holy Spirit&#x27;s indwelling within the converts and churches was the mark of Paul&#x27;s success. In contrast was Allen&#x27;s belief that the people of his day were unable to entrust their converts to the Holy Spirit and instead relied in His work through them.

His views became increasingly influential, though Allen himself became disillusioned with the established churches. He spent the last years of his life in Kenya. Near the end of his life Allen wrote &quot;The Family Rite&quot;. In this essay Allen advocates that the family again becomes the center of the Christian church and its ministry. Allen died in Nairobi. His funeral was conducted by the Bishop of Mombasa and his gravestone can be found in Nairobi&#x27;s City Park. A simple stone cross with the inscription on the pedestal reads: &quot;ROLAND ALLEN, CLERK IN HOLY ORDERS, 1868–1947, I AM THE RESURRECTION AND THE LIFE SAITH THE LORD&quot;

<doc id="1022133" wikidata="Q17083494" url="?curid=1022133" title="Chlorodyne">
<text>Chlorodyne was one of the best known patent medicines sold in the British Isles. It was invented in the 19th century by a Dr. John Collis Browne, a doctor in the British Indian Army; its original purpose was in the treatment of cholera. Browne sold his formula to the pharmacist John Thistlewood Davenport, who advertised it widely, as a treatment for cholera, diarrhea, insomnia, neuralgia, migraines, etc. As its principal ingredients were a mixture of laudanum (an alcoholic solution of opium), tincture of cannabis, and chloroform, it readily lived up to its claims of relieving pain, as a sedative, and for the treatment of diarrhea.

==Imitations==
Chlorodyne sold extremely well for many years; as its active ingredients were well known, local chemists&#x27; shops would also make up cheaper generic versions for sale to their customers. Here is an example of such a generic formulation, from &quot;Materia Medica&quot; by William Hale-White &amp; A.H. Douthwaite, 21st edition (1932):

&quot;Tinctura Chloroformi et Morphinæ Composita intended to be an imitation of the proprietary medicine called chlorodyne. Mix chloroform 75, tincture of capsicum 25, tincture of Indian hemp 100, oil of peppermint 2 and glycerin 250 with alcohol (20 per cent) 450. Dissolve morphine hydrochloride 10 in the mixture. Add to it diluted hydrocyanic acid 50 and enough alcohol (90 per cent) to make 1000. Strength. 1 millilitre contains chloroform 7.5 centimils; morphine hydrochloride 1 centigram; acidum hydrocyanicum dilutum 5 centimils.

Dose 5 to 15 minims - 0.2 to 1ml
Besides the generics, a number of rival sellers marketed their own branded versions of the formula, brands such as &quot;Freeman&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Teasdale&#x27;s&quot;, and &quot;Towle&#x27;s&quot;. It can be seen from the illustrations that the authenticity of these rival brands was hotly contested. Another version, Shinyaku (lit. &quot;divine-medicine&quot;), was developed in Japan and sold domestically for many years, although its most toxic ingredients were replaced over time for reasons of safety and legality.

== Criticism from the medical community ==
Between 1861 and 1862 The British Medical Journal featured several pieces of criticism of chlorodyne including one lead article that featured it as an example of &quot;Professional Testimonial-Mongers.&quot; Alongside this are two letters from practising doctors. Both include significant distaste at the repeated inclusion of advertisement for Chlorodyne from Dr. Browne in a previous issue. Furthermore scepticism of its usefulness over other opioids and a general distaste for its Homeopathic advertisement is a consistent theme.

==Decline==
Though the drug was effective in many ways, its high opiate content also made it very addictive, and deaths from overdoses, either accidental or deliberate, became a frequent occurrence. A common feature of the coroner&#x27;s report in such cases would be the description of the deceased&#x27;s body being found in a flat or bedsit littered with empty Chlorodyne bottles. Over the decades of the twentieth century, the cannabis was removed from the formulation, and the amount of opiates in the medicine were progressively reduced. The name of Collis Browne lives on in Britain in a mixture sold under the trade name &quot;J Collis Browne&#x27;s Mixture&quot; for the relief of coughs and diarrhea. This modern formulation contains morphine and peppermint oil. The active ingredients per 5ml are: morphine hydrochloride equivalent to 1.0mg anhydrous morphine, peppermint oil 1.5 microlitres.

The other ingredients are: ethanol (alcohol), benzoic acid (E210), capsicum tincture, caramel (E150), menthol, citric acid (E330), hypromellose, sorbitol solution (E420), treacle (containing sucrose and fructose), purified water.

<text>The Rock Eisteddfod Challenge, also known as the Australian Rock Eisteddfod Challenge, was an Australian dance and drama challenge for government-funded high schools that was active between 1980 and 2012. Initiated by the Rock Eisteddfod Challenge Foundation as part of the Global Rock Challenge, the aim of the event was to promote healthy lifestyle choices, particularly abstinence from drugs, alcohol and cigarettes. The event started in Sydney, New South Wales in 1980 and subsequently spread to other States and territories of Australia and a small number of other countries.

In 2004 an event for primary school students was started, called J Rock, to raise awareness about obesity and other eating disorders by promoting dance as a fun way to exercise.

On 9 February 2010 it was announced that due to lack of funding, the Rock Eisteddfod Challenge would not take place in 2010. The event was subsequently revised, however ceased permanently following the 2012 event. On 30 June 2013 the Rock Eisteddfod Challenge Foundation voluntarily revoked its accreditation as a registered charity with the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission.

In 2013, the Government of Victoria supported the establishment of the Wakakirri School Challenge as a replacement of the Rock Eisteddfod Challenge for Victorian primary and high schools.

== Concept ==
Rock Eisteddfod shows are stories on stage of no longer than eight minutes. Participants can have between 10 and 120 students on stage, as well as up to 20 back stage crew. The entire show is set to a pre-recorded soundtrack of contemporary music, and the aim is to use dancing and drama to tell the story. There are also sets and costumes to be thought of and the performances often combine elements from the whole arts curriculum. Schools choose their own theme and story and work collaboratively with teachers and parents to bring their ideas to life.

While performances are professionally staged events, the Global Rock Challenge is about having fun along the way. Students, teachers, parents and communities work together over many months helping to prepare the school&#x27;s performance.

Many state government health and education departments put their support behind the event. The Australian Department of Health and Ageing sponsored the Rock Eisteddfod Challenge television specials with various tobacco, alcohol and drug prevention messages for 18 years.

Almost a million young people aged between 11 and 19 years have performed on stage. In 2005, 100,000 young people from 800 schools took part in one of the hundreds of shows staged worldwide.

In 2006 over 400 schools and 40,000 students competed in 50 Rock Eisteddfod Challenge shows in 17 regions across Australia.

==History==
The concept began in Sydney in 1980 known as the Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Eisteddfod, a NSW Arts Council sponsored-event held at the Hordern Pavilion. The idea was developed by Sydney radio station 2SM and, with support from Coca-Cola, the NSW Arts Council promoted the event as an example of local youth culture in action.

In 1988 the New South Wales Department of Health was the first to see the Rock Eisteddfod as an opportunity to deliver the &quot;Quit for life&quot; anti-smoking message to secondary school students in New South Wales. At the same time, Kerrie Hayes and Peter Sjoquist took over and revitalised the event which became known nationally as the Rock Eisteddfod Challenge. In 1998 the Rock Eisteddfod was televised nationally for the first time on the Nine Network as part of the National Drug Offensive. Novelist Tim Levy was an organiser of the Junior youth competition and hosted it in five cities across Australia.

=== Expansion to other countries ===
In New Zealand, the event was introduced in 1993, where it was branded as the Smokefree Stage Challenge, starting with 20 schools and 2000 participants, and had grown to include 171 schools and 16,381 participants.

In 1995 Inspector Mark Pontin of the Hampshire Constabulary visited Australia on a Churchill Scholarship. Pontin saw the Australian Rock Eisteddfod Challenge first hand and was so impressed that he persuaded the Chief Constable, Sir John Hoddinott, to introduce it to their area of the United Kingdom. In 1996 the inaugural event of the Rock Challenge was staged in Portsmouth with eleven schools and 800 students. This has now turned into a national series of competitions, usually starting in Aberdeen in February and running through many parts of the UK (including London, at the Hackney Empire) until the northern and southern Grand Finals around the end of May / beginning of June.

Rock Eisteddfod events were staged in several locations worldwide. New Zealand, Germany, the U.S. (until 2003), United Kingdom, Japan, the United Arab Emirates and South Africa have all taken up the Global Rock Challenge. A sister event, The Croc Festival, staged a series of festivals in remote and regional areas of Australia, aimed at both indigenous and non-indigenous communities are held each year. In addition to performing, the three-day festivals provide the opportunity for rural and remote students to participate in many health, education, employment, sport, visual and performing activities during the day.

==Outcomes==
Global Rock Challenge events in each country attempt to deliver specific health and lifestyle themes such as anti-tobacco, drugs and alcohol messages.

A three-year research study by the University of Sydney Department of Public Health and Community Medicine was the first cross-sectional analysis of participating and non-participating students. Professor Don Nutbeam found that participants in the Rock Eisteddfod Challenge in Sydney secondary schools had higher self-esteem than the control group of schools who did not participate in the event; that participants smoked less tobacco and marijuana and drank less alcohol than the control group. Dr Rose Grunstein also found that students in participating schools but not in the actual team also had lower propensities to smoke, drink excessive alcohol or take other drugs.

The &quot;Rock Eisteddfod Challenge as an Intervention to Increase Resiliency and Improve Health Behaviours in Adolescents (1999–2001)&quot; study examined a sample of 44 Sydney high school students and explained the effectiveness of the events as a youth program.

The overall findings included a lower incidence of drug, marijuana and alcohol use among participating REC students compared to students in non-participating REC schools. Students similarly had an improved sense of identity, belonging, purpose, problem solving skills, and social competence. As an intervention program, the Rock Eisteddfod Challenge improved flexibility, empathy and caring, good communication skills, sense of belonging and sense of purpose. 90% of students from REC schools and 87.5% from control schools knew that the message was an anti-substance abuse message, the study found very positive attitudes toward the REC, particularly amongst those who took an active role in the event.

==Divisions==

In all Rock Eisteddfod Challenge events there are Open and RAW divisions. In Melbourne and Sydney there is an open, small and premier division.

Introduced in 2006, the RAW Division is the division of the Rock Eisteddfod Challenge which has a &#x27;no set&#x27; rule, focusing purely on dance. Participants are encouraged to explore using the human body in order to tell their story, and as a result RAW division has greater emphasis on choreography, dance and drama. Schools may compete in Open/Small/Premier AND Raw divisions.

The Small Teams division was cut out of the competition in 2008 in favor of RAW.

<text>The FV102 Striker was the anti-tank guided missile carrier in the CVR(T) family and served in the British Army.

==Overview==
FV102 Striker was the Swingfire wire-guided anti-tank missile carrying member of the CVR(T) family. The FV102 Striker was externally very similar to the FV103 Spartan but carried five missiles in a ready-to-fire bin at the back of the vehicle. Five reload missiles were carried in the vehicle. The bin was elevated to 35° (622mils) for firing. The targeting sight could be demounted and operated at a distance from the vehicle which could remain in cover, even completely screened as the missile can turn up to 90° after launch to come onto the target heading. The missiles were originally steered by joystick control using manual command to line of sight (MCLOS). This was later updated to the semi-automatic command to line of sight (SACLOS) system where the controller merely sights the target. Secondary armament was a general purpose machine gun.

==Development==
The Striker was developed for the British Army to fire the Swingfire missile. The first production vehicles were delivered in 1975 and used in British Army service by the Royal Artillery anti-tank guided missile batteries. The vehicle initially was powered by the Jaguar J60 4.2-litre 6-cylinder petrol engine - the same as used by several Jaguar cars. This was then replaced by a Cummins BTA 5.9 diesel engine, as used in British Army FV107 Scimitars, under the CVR(T) life extension programme.

==Service history==
The Striker entered service in 1976 with the Royal Artillery of the BAOR, but then was transferred to the Royal Armoured Corps where they served in formation reconnaissance regiments. On 24 March 2003, during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, a Striker destroyed an Iraqi T-55 tank with an anti-tank missile. The FV102 Striker was withdrawn from British Army service as the Swingfire missile was replaced by the Javelin missile in mid-2005.

==Additional specification==
* Ground clearance: 0.35 m
* Ammunition carried: 10 Swingfire missiles, 7.62 mm NATO x 3,000 rounds.

<doc id="1022147" wikidata="Q646736" url="?curid=1022147" title="FV103 Spartan">
<text>FV103 Spartan is a tracked armoured personnel carrier. It was developed for the British Army as the APC variant of the Combat Vehicle Reconnaissance (Tracked) family. The vehicle can carry up to seven personnel, including three crew members. Armed with a single machine gun, it is almost indistinguishable from the FV102 Striker in external appearance. 

Rather than a general personnel carrier for infantry, the Spartan had been used for moving specialist teams, such as anti-aircraft missile teams. An anti-tank variant of the Spartan armed with MILAN anti-tank missiles was produced, named the FV120 Spartan MCT. Nearly 500 Spartans served with the British armed forces since entering service in 1978. Replacement by newer vehicles started in 2009. The vehicle is now out of British service.

==Design and features==
The FV103 Spartan was developed during the 1970s as the Armoured Personnel Carrier (APC) version of the British Army&#x27;s Combat Vehicle Reconnaissance (Tracked) (CVR(T)) family of armoured fighting vehicles, designed by Alvis plc. The vehicle entered service with the British military in 1978. The Spartan is similar in appearance to the FV102 Striker, except for the missile launcher on the Striker.

The Spartan was powered by a 4.2l XK Jaguar petrol engine. The vehicle is in length and in width. With a ground clearance of , it has a height of . As the APC variant of the CVR(T) family, the FV103 has been used by small specialized groups such as mortar fire controller teams, anti aircraft teams and also reconnaissance teams.

The vehicle can carry seven personnel, in a combination of three crew members and four passengers or two crew members and five passengers. It is armed with one 7.62 mm L37A1 machine gun, and can have four smoke dischargers on each side. In addition to the APC role, it has been used as a resupply vehicle for the FV102 Striker, carrying extra Swingfire missiles. 

The FV103 has a combat weight of . It has a maximum speed of and has a range of . It is capable of negotiating up to 60% gradients.

==Variants and service==
An anti-tank variant of the FV103 was produced, named the FV120 Spartan MCT (Spartan with MILAN Compact Turret). The FV120 has a two-man turret, and carries thirteen MILAN Anti-Tank Light Infantry Missiles, with two in launch positions.

A &#x27;stretched Spartan&#x27; design with an extra road wheel was considered as a future replacement for the FV430, able to carry three more dismounted personnel (7+3 crew), and replacing the Jaguar petrol engine with a Perkins diesel offering greater range. CVR(T) prototype number 11 (a Scorpion) was cut and extended to demonstrate the basic hull could be used as a ten-man Armoured Personnel Carrier (APC), and a diesel engine fitted. After tests confirmed the stretched version retained the mobility of the basic CVR(T), MVEE built another prototype from scratch with a wider hull called the FV4333. Alvis later purchased the design rights, renamed the vehicle the Alvis Stormer, and developed it further.

In 2006 it was reported to the House of Commons that 478 FV103 vehicles were in service with the armed forces of the United Kingdom in April of that year, 452 of them in a deployable state. By 2007, 495 FV103 Spartans were in the service of the United Kingdom. These were replaced by mid-2009 with Panther Command and Liaison Vehicles.

Belgium began using Spartans, along with other CVR(T) vehicles, in their cavalry units from 1975.

===Ukraine===

On 11 April 2022, during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the United Kingdom approved the delivery of 120 armored vehicles, including FV103 Spartan combat vehicles, to Ukraine following a meeting between UK prime minister Boris Johnson and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky in an unannounced visit to Kyiv. Johnson pledged 120 armored vehicles and new anti-ship missile systems for Ukraine as part of another £100 million (€120 million, $130 million) commitment to delivering high-grade military equipment. 35 Spartans had been donated by the UK government, and had proved very successful.

A crowdfunding appeal by the Prytula Foundation launched on 2 November 2022 raised US$5.5m to buy 60 ex-British Army FV103 Spartans, to be delivered to Ukraine that year.

In February 2023, Unite With Ukraine procured 6 more Spartans for service with the Territorial Defense Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
As of January 2025, 17 units were destroyed, 4 damaged and 2 captured by Russian Forces.

<text>The Shtokman field (also &quot;Stockman field&quot;; ), one of the world&#x27;s largest natural gas fields, lies in the northwestern part of the South Barents Basin in the Russian sector of the Barents Sea, north of Kola Peninsula. Its reserves are estimated at of natural gas and more than 37 million tons of gas condensate.

==History==
The Shtokman field was discovered in 1988. It was named after the Soviet geophysicist Vladimir Shtokman ().

In the early 1990s, Gazprom started talks with a group of five Western companies to participate in the field&#x27;s development. In 1992, the foreign consortium was pushed out by the Rosshelf consortium, a Gazprom subsidiary that comprised 19 Russian companies. in August 1995, Gazprom and Rosshelf signed a letter of intent with Norsk Hydro of Norway, Conoco Inc. of the United States, Neste Oy of Finland, and TotalEnergies of France to evaluate the possible joint development of Shtokman field.

In January 1996, a project of a large floating liquefaction plant was designed, but this plan was abandoned and in March 2000, Rosshelf began developing plans for production and construction of a natural gas pipeline from the field via Murmansk to Vyborg. In 2001, Gazprom announced its intention to develop the gas field together with Rosneft. In 2002, the license for the field development and recovery was transferred from Rosshelf to Sevmorneftegas.

On 20 June 2005, Russia and Norway signed a number of agreements related to development of Shtokman field. On 28 June 2005 Russia signed a memorandum with France. In August 2005, Gazprom received bids from ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil,
Norsk Hydro, Statoil, Mitsui, Sumitomo Corporation, Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron Corporation, and TotalEnergies to develop the field. In September 2005, Gazprom selected five companies—Statoil, Norsk Hydro, TotalEnergies, Chevron and ConocoPhillips—as finalists in a search for partners to develop the field, but in October 2006 decided to reject all potential partners.

On 13 July 2007, Gazprom and French energy company TotalEnergies signed a framework agreement to organize the design, financing, construction and operation of the Shtokman phase one infrastructure. On 25 October 2007, similar contract was signed between Gazprom and StatoilHydro (later Statoil, now Equinor). The consortium of three companies, Shtokman Development AG, was established on 21 February 2008 in Zug, Switzerland.

Due to the global LNG oversupply and the United States shale gas, the shareholders of the project decided in 2010 to postpone it for 3 years. Based on this, the pipeline gas production might start in 2016 and LNG production in 2017.

The shareholders agreement expired on 30 June 2012 without development started. Statoil wrote off its investment into the project and handed shares back to Gazprom. In August 2012, Gazprom put the project on hold with a final investment decision on the first phase postponed until at least 2014, citing high costs and low gas prices. However, the company confirmed being in talks with foreign partners to find a new business model for the project. There are speculations that Royal Dutch Shell may become a project partner.

The Shtokman project was postponed indefinitely in May 2019, and Gazprom closed down the Shtokman Development AG.

==Development==
The field so far was not developed owing to extreme Arctic conditions and the depth of the sea varying from . In September 2006, Gazprom completed drilling of appraisal well No. 7 in the field. Russian scientists have warned that the Shtokman&#x27;s development may face problems as global warming unleashes vast icebergs into the Arctic. The Shtokman Development Company plans to address this challenge by using floating removable platforms, which can be moved around in case of emergency situations.

Originally it was planned to ship Shtokman&#x27;s gas to the United States as liquid natural gas (LNG). Later it was indicated by Gazprom that the majority of produced natural gas would be sold to Europe via the planned Nord Stream 2 pipeline. For this purpose, the pipeline from the Shtokman field to the Murmansk Oblast and further via Kola peninsula to Volkhov in the Leningrad Oblast will be built. The LNG plant will be laid in by the village of Teriberka, about north-east of Murmansk.

The front-end engineering and design (FEED) is divided between different companies. The onshore transportation and technological complex, including an LNG plant, will be prepared by Technip. DORIS Engineering will prepare the subsea production system and the offshore technological platform. JP Kenny, a subsidiary of Wood Group, will design together with Rubin Design Bureau and Giprospetsgaz, a subsidiary of Gazprom, the long subsea pipeline from the Shtokman field to south of Murmansk. WorleyParsons and its subsidiary INTECSEA will perform FEED of the production vessel, which will process produced gas before transportation onshore.

==Geology==
The main reservoir is of Upper Jurassic age, with a smaller amount of gas in the Middle Jurassic and the trapping structure is a large anticline, sealed by Upper Jurassic shales.

==Technical features==
At the initial stage the project is expected to produce 22.5 billion cubic meter (bcm) of natural gas and 205,000 tons of gas condensate annually. Later the production is expected to increase up to 70 bcm of natural gas and 0.6 million tonnes of gas condensate. All extraction facilities will probably be located under water. The development costs are estimated at US$15 billion to US$20 billion, although according to the estimate by Alexander Medvedev, deputy chairman of Gazprom&#x27;s management committee, the field&#x27;s development costs will be only US$12 billion.

==Project company==
The license to explore for and produce gas and condensate on the Shtokman field is owned by Russian company Gazprom Shelf Dobycha (formerly Sevmorneftegaz), a wholly owned subsidiary of Gazprom. Gazprom Shelf Dobycha is a sole customer for the design and construction of the field infrastructure, including a production complex, a pipeline network and an LNG plant, and has all marketing rights for hydrocarbons of the Shtokman field. Shtokman Development AG was to bear all financial, geological and technical risks related to the production activities. Gazprom owned 51% of shares in Shtokman Development, while TotalEnergies had 25% and Statoil 24% of shares. Head of the company was Yury Komarov. Shtokman Development was to own infrastructure for 25 years from field commissioning. Upon completion of phase one, TotalEnergies and Statoil should transfer their shares in Shtokman Development AG to Gazprom.

<text>FV105 Sultan was a British command and control vehicle based on the CVR(T) platform. It has a higher roof than the armoured personnel carrier variants, providing a more comfortable &quot;office space&quot; inside. Sultan entered service in 1978. It is no longer used by British Armed Forces.

==Design==
The Sultan contains a large vertical map board and desk along one side, with a bench seat for three people facing it. Forward of this are positions for the radio operator, with provision for four radios, and vehicle commander, whose seat can be raised to give him access to the pintle-mounted general purpose machine gun. The driver sits forward of this in a small compartment beside the engine space, on a chair with a spring-loaded seat that allows him to recline inside the vehicle or sit upright with his head out of the hatch.

The back of the vehicle is designed to be extended by an attached tent to form a briefing area. The map board can be removed from the vehicle and hung from the tent poles, along with overhead lights connected to the Sultan&#x27;s power supply. However, this option has been removed from many vehicles in service.

In common with the other CVR(T) vehicles, the Sultan was originally fitted with a canvas skirt for river crossing. Because of its high roof, this was needed only at the front, which slopes downwards. The swimming skirt was permanently removed from all CVR(T) vehicles in the British Army.

The Sultan contains an NBC filter pack for protection against chemical gas, biological agents and radioactive particles.

<text>FV106 Samson was a British Army armoured recovery vehicle, one of the CVR(T) family. The main role of this vehicle was to recover the CVR(T) family of vehicles, but could also recover other light tracked vehicles such as the FV430 series.

==Design and features==
The Samson was conceived in the early 1970s with the final design entering production in 1978. The hull is an all-welded aluminium construction. It usually carries a crew of three operating a 3.5T capstan winch that can also be utilised in a lifting configuration. It carries suitable equipment to enable a 4:1 mechanical advantage with 228m of winch rope. This winch is capable of recovering up to 12 Tonnes of vehicle. A manually operated earth anchor is situated at the rear to anchor the vehicle while operations are carried out.
The Samson can be fitted with a flotation screen so it can be operated amphibiously using its own tracks at 6.5 km/h or at 9.6 km/h if also fitted with a propeller kit. The Samson can also be fitted with a full NBC protection unit.

==Operators==

A single Samson accompanied the two troops of Blues and Royals CVR(T)s to the Falklands War.

<doc id="1022156" wikidata="Q995226" url="?curid=1022156" title="FV107 Scimitar">
<text>The FV107 Scimitar is an armoured tracked military reconnaissance vehicle (sometimes classed as a light tank) formerly used by the British Army, until it was retired from active service in April 2023. It was manufactured by Alvis in Coventry. It is very similar to the FV101 Scorpion, but mounts a high-velocity 30 mm L21 RARDEN cannon instead of a low-velocity 76 mm gun. It was issued to Royal Armoured Corps armoured regiments in the reconnaissance role. Each regiment originally had a close reconnaissance squadron of five troops, each containing eight FV107 Scimitars. Each Main Battle Tank Regiment also employed eight Scimitars in the close reconnaissance role.

==Development==
The FV107 Scimitar is one of the CVR(T) series of vehicles. The first prototype was completed in 1971. After being accepted for service in 1973, deliveries to Belgium and the UK commenced in 1974.

Initially, the engine was the Jaguar J60 4.2-litre 6-cylinder petrol engine, the same as used by several Jaguar cars. This was replaced by a Cummins BTA 5.9 diesel engine in British Army Scimitars under the CVR(T) Life Extension Program (LEP).

The UK initiated the Tactical Reconnaissance Armoured Combat Equipment Requirement (TRACER) to replace the Sabre and Scimitar. In 1996 the U.S. joined in on the project. In 2001, both the UK and U.S. dropped out of the joint programme.

As of 2023, the Scimitar&#x27;s intended replacement in British service is a variant of the Ajax fitted with a CT40 cannon. The Scimitar was retired from British service in 2023. The Warrior is being used as a temporary stop-gap, until Ajax reaches initial operating capability.

== Scimitar Mk II ==
Following a risk mitigation programme, in December 2010 a contract was awarded for the development, testing and management of an upgraded Scimitar. This was undertaken by the Vehicles Military &amp; Technical Services team, BAE Systems Telford, which co-ordinated the build of 50 vehicles at the nearby DSG (Defence Support Group), Donnington, to be completed in early 2012. The Scimitar Mark 2 combat vehicle is one of five enhanced CVR(T) types. It was created in early 2010, and continues in service.

The Scimitar Mk II was:
* Rehulled to give better mine-blast protection for troops
* Improved armour fitted to enhance resistance to blasts and ballistic threats
* Provide mine-protected (suspended and piston-mounted) seating in every crew position
* Improve available space and improve crew conditions
* Mitigate repairs while reducing maintenance and life-cycle costs, and extend in-service life.
The resulting vehicles have since been re-engined with a Cummins BTA 5.9 litre diesel engine and David Brown TN15E+ automatic gearbox. In addition to providing power for an air conditioning system, the new more fuel-efficient engine extends the vehicle&#x27;s operational range, while the re-designed internal layout allows better-protected fuel tanks to be repositioned for reduced vulnerability to blast and ballistic threats.

The new engine and transmission package promised straightforward servicing and support for the Mk II during its in-service life, refurbished dampers simultaneously improving crew comfort - and hence reducing fatigue - while extending the life of vehicle components and maintaining the tactical mobility of the original vehicle despite an increase to an operation weight of c12,000 kg.

BAE Systems have proposed improved road wheels, new conventional metal tracks with guaranteed mileage (which could reduce the vehicle&#x27;s running costs) and continuous &#x27;rubber&#x27; band tracks, which significantly decrease both vibration and noise, allowing crew to operate more effectively and for longer, even in the harshest environments, while reducing the vehicle&#x27;s acoustic signature.

==Combat use==

Two troops from B Squadron, Blues and Royals served in the Falklands War. One troop was equipped with four Scorpions, the other with four Scimitars. These CVR(T)s were the only armoured vehicles used in action by the British Army during the conflict. At least one Scimitar was seriously damaged by an Argentinian landmine, but the crew were unscathed, and the vehicle was salvaged by a Chinook HC.1 helicopter and soon brought back into service by the attached REME section. Scorpions and Scimitars also provided air defence support; one Scimitar claimed to have shot down an Argentinian Skyhawk fighter-bomber with its 30 mm cannon.

The 1st (British) Armoured Division, the British component of the coalition&#x27;s ground forces in the First Gulf War, included a medium reconnaissance regiment that used Scimitars and other CVR(T) vehicles. This regiment initially was composed of the three constituent squadrons of 16th/5th The Queen&#x27;s Royal Lancers (16/5L), reinforced by a fourth squadron from 1st The Queen&#x27;s Dragoon Guards (QDG). On 26 February 1991, the regiment fought direct-fire engagements with Iraqi units while calling in air and artillery strikes to support an attack by the division&#x27;s 7th Armoured Brigade. A troop of Scimitars engaged and knocked out Iraqi T-62s, penetrating their frontal armour with sabot rounds. One Scimitar was engaged and hit by an Iraqi T-55 and the penetrating round passed through the thin aluminium armour without injuring the crew.

Scimitars of C Squadron, 1st The Queen&#x27;s Dragoon Guards, were used in the Battle of Al Faw in the opening days of the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Plans for an amphibious landing by Scimitars were abandoned due to extensive mining of the beaches; instead, they crossed into Iraq by land.

In Afghanistan, during Operation Herrick, Scimitars were deployed either in standard troop organisations or as part of Jackal composite troops, in which role they provided additional firepower to complement the Jackal&#x27;s high mobility.

==Additional specifications==
* Ground clearance: 0.35 m
* Main armament: 30 mm L21 RARDEN cannon. (Fires at up to 90 rounds per minute)
* Ammunition types:
** High Explosive Incendiary (HEI)
** High Explosive (HE)
** Armour Piercing (AP)
** APSE (Armour Piercing Secondary Effects)
** Armour Piercing Discarding Sabot-Tracer (APDS-T)
* Additional defence: 2 × 4-barrel smoke launchers.
* Ammunition stores:
** 30 mm – 165 rounds
** 7.62 mm – 2,000 rounds
* As with all British armoured vehicles, Scimitar is equipped with a forced air system, so the crew could lock down in a CBRN environment. For this reason, the vehicle is equipped with a boiling vessel (or &quot;BV&quot;), to cook and make hot drinks.
