<text>Sergeant Darrell Samuel Cole (July 20, 1920 – February 19, 1945) was a United States Marine who posthumously received the United States&#x27; highest military decoration, the Medal of Honor, for his conspicuous gallantry at the Battle of Iwo Jima during World War II.

Although he was originally assigned to play the bugle, Sergeant Cole repeatedly requested that his rating be changed from field musician to machine-gunner. Although rated as a bugler he fought as a machine-gunner in several major campaigns of World War II including Guadalcanal, Tinian, and Saipan.

On his fourth request to change his rating to machine-gunner the request was approved 4 months before he was sent into combat again on Iwo Jima. During the battle, Cole made a successful one-man attack against two gun emplacements impeding the advance of his company. Upon returning to his squad, he was killed by an enemy grenade.

In 1996 the United States Navy named , a destroyer, in his honor. This destroyer was damaged in a suicide attack in Yemen but subsequently repaired and is currently in service.

==Early life==
Darrell Cole was born July 20, 1920, in Esther (now part of Park Hills), Missouri. He attended high school in Esther, graduating in 1938. Before graduating, his main interests were sports; particularly basketball, hunting and photography. He also learned to play the french horn which later led to him being assigned as a bugler.

After graduating from high school, he joined the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), where he became an assistant forestry clerk and assistant educational advisor for his company. He left after one year and he went to Detroit, Michigan where he worked at a company that made engine gaskets.

==Military service==
On August 25, 1941, he enlisted in the Marine Corps. Following United States Marine Corps Recruit Training at MCRD Parris Island, South Carolina, he was appointed to the Field Music School for training as a Marine Corps Field Musician (a bugler). He was unhappy with being a field musician because he had joined the Marine Corps to fight. He applied for a change in rating to be a machine-gunner, but was refused due to the shortage of buglers. After completing field music school, he was transferred to the 1st Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division.

After completing his first overseas tour, he returned to the United States in February 1943 and was assigned to the First Battalion, 23rd Marines, 4th Marine Division at Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. When his unit moved to California he again asked for relief as a field musician; and for permission to perform line duties. Again, due to the shortage of buglers in the Marine Corps, his request was denied. Throughout the course of World War II, until his death on Iwo Jima, Cole participated in several battles and campaigns as a machine-gunner and was promoted to the rank of sergeant in 1944.

===Battle of Guadalcanal===
The Battle of Guadalcanal, was fought between August 7, 1942, and February 7, 1943, in the Pacific theatre of World War II and was the first major offensive launched by allied forces against the Empire of Japan. Cole arrived on Guadalcanal on August 7, 1942, for the first American offensive of World War II; and his first opportunity to fill in as a machine-gunner in the absence of the regular gunner.

===Battles of Kwajalein, Saipan and Tinian===
After Guadalcanal, Cole served in several more battles throughout the Pacific theatre, including the battles of Kwajalein, Saipan and Tinian. The United States launched an assault on the main islands of Kwajalein in the south and Roi-Namur in the north from January 31, 1944, to February 3, 1944. The Japanese defenders put up a stiff resistance though outnumbered and under-prepared. Although the United States won the battle the determined defenses of Roi-Namur left only 51 Japanese survivors of an original garrison of 3,500. During this engagement of the 4th Division Cole, again forsaking his bugle, stepped in as a machine-gunner.

When Cole was sent to fight with his unit in Saipan, he was assigned to a machine gun unit; and was designated as a machine gun section leader. During the battle his squad leader was killed and Cole, although wounded, assumed command of the entire squad. He was awarded the Bronze Star for &quot;…his resolute leadership, indomitable fighting spirit and tenacious determination in the face of terrific opposition.&quot; and was awarded the Purple Heart for the wounds he received.

When fighting began on the island of Tinian in the Mariana Islands from July 24 to August 1, 1944, Cole&#x27;s unit was sent in a few days after the battle began. Cole again led his squad ashore in the invasion and defeat of the neighboring islands of Tinian; and continued to build his reputation as &quot;The Fighting Field Musician.&quot;

===Mariana and Palau Islands campaign===
The Mariana and Palau Islands campaign was an offensive launched by United States forces against Imperial Japanese forces in the Mariana Islands and Palau in the Pacific Ocean, between June and November, 1944 during the Pacific War. It was after the Marianas campaign, that he submitted a request for a change of rating for the third time. Pointing out his experience and combat record, he stated that he felt he would be of more benefit to the Marine Corps performing line duties than those of field music. This time his request was approved and he was redesignated Corporal and subsequently promoted to Sergeant in November 1944.

===Battle of Iwo Jima===
The Battle of Iwo Jima was fought between the United States and the Japanese Empire, in February and March 1945 during the Pacific Campaign of World War II. Ground fighting on the island took place over approximately 36 days; lasting from the landings of February 17 to a final Japanese charge the morning of March 26, 1945. The U.S. invasion, known as Operation Detachment, was charged with the mission of capturing the island&#x27;s airfields. The Japanese positions on the island were heavily fortified, with vast bunkers, hidden artillery, and 18 kilometers (11 mi) of tunnels.

On February 19, Sergeant Cole led his machine gun section ashore in the D-Day assault of Iwo Jima. Moving forward with the initial assault wave, a hail of fire from two enemy emplacements halted his section&#x27;s advance. Sergeant Cole personally destroyed them with hand grenades. His unit continued to advance until pinned down for a second time by enemy fire from three Japanese gun emplacements. One of these emplacements was destroyed by a machine-gunner in Cole&#x27;s squad. When his machine guns jammed, armed only with a pistol and one hand grenade, Sergeant Cole made a one-man attack against the two remaining gun emplacements. Twice he returned to his own lines for additional grenades and continued the attack under fierce enemy fire until he had succeeded in destroying the enemy strong points.

Upon returning to his own squad, he was killed by an enemy grenade. As a result of his one-man attack, Sergeant Cole&#x27;s company could move forward against the fortifications and attain their ultimate objective. Sergeant Cole was initially buried in the 4th Marine Division Cemetery on Iwo Jima, but at the request of his father, his remains were returned to the United States to be buried in Parkview Cemetery, Farmington, Missouri.

==Honors and awards==

===Military decorations===
In addition to the Medal of Honor and Bronze Star Medal, Sergeant Cole was awarded the Purple Heart with Gold Star in lieu of a second award, the Presidential Unit Citation, American Defense Service Medal, Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal, and the World War II Victory Medal.

====Medal of Honor====
Cole was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor, which was presented to his widow on April 17, 1947. The citation reads as follows.

For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while serving as Leader of a Machine-gun Section of Company B, First Battalion, Twenty-Third Marines, Fourth Marine Division, in action against enemy Japanese forces during the assault on Iwo Jima in the Volcano Islands, 19 February 1945. Assailed by a tremendous volume of small-arms, mortar and artillery fire as he advanced with one squad of his section in the initial assault wave, Sergeant Cole boldly led his men up the sloping beach toward Airfield Number One despite the blanketing curtain of flying shrapnel and, personally destroying with hand grenades two hostile emplacements which menaced the progress of his unit, continued to move forward until a merciless barrage of fire emanating from three Japanese pillboxes halted the advance. Instantly placing his one remaining machine gun in action, he delivered a shattering fusillade and succeeded in silencing the nearest and most threatening emplacement before his weapon jammed and the enemy, reopening fire with knee mortars and grenades, pinned down his unit for the second time. Shrewdly gauging the tactical situation and evolving a daring plan of counterattack, Sergeant Cole, armed solely with a pistol and one grenade, coolly advanced alone to the hostile pillboxes. Hurling his one grenade at the enemy in sudden, swift attack, he quickly withdrew, returned to his own lines for additional grenades and again advanced, attacked, and withdrew. With enemy guns still active, he ran the gauntlet of slashing fire a third time to complete the total destruction of the Japanese strong point and the annihilation of the defending garrison in this final assault. Although instantly killed by an enemy grenade as he returned to his squad, Sergeant Cole had eliminated a formidable Japanese position, thereby enabling his company to storm the remaining fortifications, continue the advance and seize the objective. By his dauntless initiative, unfaltering courage and indomitable determination during a critical period of action, Sergeant Cole served as an inspiration to his comrades, and his stouthearted leadership in the face of almost certain death sustained and enhanced the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service. He gallantly gave his life for his country.

===Other honors===

The second , an Aegis-equipped guided missile destroyer was named for Sergeant Cole. &quot;Cole&quot; is homeported in NS Norfolk, Virginia. The ship was built by Ingalls Shipbuilding and delivered to the Navy on March 11, 1996. On October 12, 2000, &quot;Cole&quot; was damaged by a suicide attack in an act of terrorism while harbored in the Yemeni port of Aden.
The first , launched in 1919, was named for a Marine who was killed in World War I.

The Marine Corps Reserve training center in Camp Las Flores aboard Marine Corps base Camp Pendleton, California is also named in his honor.

The Sgt Darrell S. Cole Band Hall aboard Marine Corps Base Quantico is also named in his honor.

<doc id="1029774" wikidata="Q43846" url="?curid=1029774" title="Catlow">
<text>Catlow is a 1971 American Western film, based on a 1963 novel of the same name by Louis L&#x27;Amour. It stars Yul Brynner as a renegade outlaw determined to pull off a Confederate gold heist. It co-stars Richard Crenna and Leonard Nimoy. Nimoy mentioned this film in both of his autobiographies because it gave him a chance to break away from his role as Spock on &quot;Star Trek&quot;. He mentioned that the time he made the film was one of the happiest of his life, even though his part was rather brief. The film contains a lot of tongue-in-cheek and sardonic humor, especially between Brynner and Crenna&#x27;s characters.

== Plot ==
Jed Catlow and Ben Cowan served together in the Civil War and became friends, but now Catlow is a thief and Cowan a marshal tracking him down. Catlow is accused of rustling cattle, especially from the wealthy rancher Parkman. Parkman has hired a vicious gunfighter, Orville Miller, to kill Catlow. Offering to turn himself in, Catlow joins Cowan on a stagecoach to Fort Smith, but his men stage an ambush. Catlow heads for Hermosillo, Mexico, where a woman named Rosita is in love with him and a $2 million shipment of gold is arriving soon by mule train. The ranchers send Cowan after him along with Miller. Catlow gets the drop on Miller during a bath and hits him with a jug that shatters, cutting Miller&#x27;s vocal cords. After a later confrontation, Catlow tosses the bound marshal across a horse with a badge pinned on his backside and turns him loose.
He is later bushwhacked by Miller; and even later he rescues the nephew of a Mexican general who had been attacked by Apaches, then both are attacked by Apaches and Cowan barely avoids a plunge to his death off a cliff. Allowed to recover at General Calderon&#x27;s grand hacienda because he saved his nephew, Cowan becomes attracted to Christina, the general&#x27;s daughter. After stealing the army&#x27;s gold, Catlow flees toward the scorching desert and into dangerous Apache territory. He rejects Rosita, who angrily recruits men to go with her after Catlow and kill him. Cowan follows, as usual, but Miller shows up and shoots Cowan, wounding him. Catlow picks up Cowan&#x27;s gun and shoots Miller. Christina will take care of Cowan. Meantime, a smiling Catlow puts on his friend&#x27;s badge and gives an indication that he will turn to the right side of the law.

== Cast ==
== Production ==
The film was produced by Euan Lloyd, who had made a film of Louis L&#x27;Amour&#x27;s novel, &quot;Shalako&quot;. In June 1968 he announced he had bought the screen rights to another L&#x27;Amour novel, &quot;Catlow&quot;. The script was written by Scott Finch who had written &quot;Shalako&quot;.

In June 1970, L&#x27;Amour said the film would be the first of five made from his novels starring Stephen Boyd, the others being &quot;Down the Long Hills&quot;, &quot;Flint&quot;, &quot;Radigan&quot;, and &quot;Hanging Woman Creek&quot;.

Raising the finance for &quot;Shalako&quot; had been complicated but Lloyd managed to get the entire budget for &quot;Catlow&quot; from MGM.

The film was to have been directed by Peter Hunt. However Sam Wanamaker ended up doing the job. In March 1971 Yul Brynner signed to star. Within the month Richard Crenna, Leonard Nimoy and David Ladd had been cast.

Filming took place in Almería, Spain in August 1971. &quot;This picture has a sense of humour but that&#x27;s not the same as being a comedy Western,&quot; said Wanamaker.

== Reception ==
Lloyd ended up producing &quot;The Man Called Noon&quot;, also based on a L&#x27;Amour novel. He bought the rights to ten more for $1 million. However he produced no further L&#x27;Amour adaptations.

Quentin Tarantino called it &quot;along with Burt Kennedy&#x27;s Dirty Dingus Magee &amp; Andrew V. McLaglen&#x27;s Something Big... my nomination for worst studio western of the seventies&quot;, in which Brynner gives &quot;the worst performance of his career.&quot;

It grossed $159,500 in its first week from 29 theaters, finishing seventh for the week at the box office in the United States and Canada.

<text>Strider 2, released in Japan as , and then as , is a 1999 hack and slash game developed and published by Capcom for arcades. The game is a direct sequel to the original &quot;Strider&quot; and the second sequel to &quot;Strider&quot; produced, following U.S. Gold&#x27;s 1990 noncanonical &quot;Strider II&quot; (&quot;Journey from Darkness: Strider Returns&quot; in North America), a game with which Capcom was not directly involved. The Capcom-produced &quot;Strider 2&quot; makes no references to the Western-only &quot;Strider Returns&quot;/&quot;Strider II&quot;. The game was released for arcades in 1999 and was ported to the PlayStation in 2000.

==Development==
A Capcom artist known as Harumaru redesigned the character for &quot;Strider 2&quot;, inspired by American comics he had found at a bookshelf of the Design Office (among them DC Comics, Mike Mignola, Simon Bisley, and Spawn by Todd McFarlane). Hiryu&#x27;s redesign for this game first appeared in 1998 crossover fighting game &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes&quot;.

In 2014&#x27;s &quot;Strider&quot; Hiryu&#x27;s scarf serves as a visual cue for the Cypher upgrade the player is using (Reflect, Explosive, Cold, Magnetic), changing colors accordingly.

==Gameplay==
While the graphics in &quot;Strider 2&quot; now consist of 2D character sprites overlaid over 3D backgrounds, its gameplay remains similar to its 2D side-scrolling predecessor. The controls consists of an eight-way joystick and three action buttons. The playable character Strider Hiryu can now perform new actions in addition to the ones he had in the first game. Hiryu can walk, jump, crouch, slide, and climb walls and ceilings like he would in the original game, as well as dash by pushing the joystick left or right twice, do a double jump by pressing jump in mid-air, and do a backward somersault jump while sliding. When climbing a wall, Hiryu can perform a thrust jump by holding the joystick away from the wall and pressing the Jump button. Added to his regular sword attack, Hiryu can now do a &quot;Savage Slash&quot; technique in mid-air by pressing the joystick down and up in mid-air. In addition to the Attack and Jump buttons, the player can power-up their character by pressing the &quot;Boost&quot; button if they have at least one Boost item in stock. While in Boost mode, Hiryu can shoot Plasma Waves with his sword for a limited period until the Boost gauge under Hiryu&#x27;s life gauge runs out. Throughout the game, the player can pick up power-up items such as health replenishments and extensions, a cypher extension, and additional boosts. The player can obtain various miscellaneous point items based on other Capcom games, such as the Yashichi and the Sakichi symbols from &quot;Vulgus&quot; and the &quot;zenny&quot; coins from &quot;Black Tiger&quot; and &quot;Forgotten Worlds&quot;, that will increase the player&#x27;s score.

The coin-op version of &quot;Strider 2&quot; consists of five stages or missions, each with a different objective that is explained to the player beforehand. The first three missions can be played in any order the player wishes to undertake them, and are set in different locations on Earth (Hong Kong, Germany, Antarctica). The final two stages take place in the Flying Battleship Balrog and the space station Third Moon, both of which were locations in the original &quot;Strider&quot;.

==Plot==
Around 2000 years after his defeat in the original game, the mysterious Grandmaster has returned once again to finish his plans and claim total control over the world. However, Strider Hiryu, a Strider carrying the same codename of the man who slew the Grandmaster in the past, has also surfaced. According to Capcom, this version of Hiryu is a clone of the original Hiryu created by the Strider organization in order to reincarnate Hiryu back from the dead. As one of the last survivors after the Striders were wiped out, he carries the mission to destroy the Grandmaster once and for all.

==Home version==
A home version of &quot;Strider 2&quot; was released for the PlayStation in 2000 (a simple port, given the PlayStation&#x27;s similarity to the arcade&#x27;s Sony ZN-2 board), which was released as a 2-disc set, with a second disc devoted to a direct port of the original &quot;Strider&quot; coin-op. Due to a labeling error in the American release, the &quot;Strider 2&quot; discs were labeled as the original &quot;Strider&quot;, and vice versa.

Finishing both games and saving the achievements on the same memory card unlocks a secret level in &quot;Strider 2&quot;: &quot;Mission 00&quot;, a waterfall stage. Completion of all missions unlocks the former Strider Hien as a playable character, who wields two ranged cyphers; completion of the game using Hien unlocks the Boost skill for unlimited use in the game&#x27;s menu.

==Reception==
In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Strider 2&quot; on their March 1, 2000 issue as being the fifth most-successful arcade game of the month.

The PlayStation version of &quot;Strider 2&quot; received &quot;average&quot; reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. James Mielke, writing for GameSpot, called it &quot;a deliberate throwback to the arcade-dominant &#x27;80s&quot; and &quot;an excellent starter kit for the uninitiated, but for veterans of the series, it&#x27;s like dinner without the dessert.&quot; David Zydrko of IGN described it as &quot;a must-have package for fans of arcade-style action games&quot;, adding, &quot;if you don&#x27;t mind the fact that it&#x27;s a very short game, you owe it to yourself to add this game to your collection.&quot; In Japan, &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave it a score of 30 out of 40.

<text>The EO is an early commercial tablet computer that was created by Eo Inc. (later acquired by AT&amp;T Corporation), and released in April 1993. Eo (Latin for &quot;I go&quot;) was the hardware spin-out of GO Corporation. Officially named the AT&amp;T EO [[Personal Communicator]], it is similar to a large personal digital assistant with wireless communications, and competed against the Apple Newton. The unit was produced in conjunction with David Kelley Design, frog design, and the Matsushita, Olivetti and Marubeni corporations.

Among the EO customers AT&amp;T claimed were: New York Stock Exchange, Andersen Consulting, Lawrence Livermore Laboratories, FD Titus &amp; Sons and Woolworths.

Eo, Inc., 52 percent owned by AT&amp;T, shut down operations on July 29, 1994, after failing to meet its revenue targets and to secure the funding to continue. It was reported that 10,000 of the computers had been sold.

In 2012, PC Magazine called the AT&amp;T EO 440, &quot;the first true phablet&quot;.

==Product specifics==
Two models, the Communicator 440 and 880, were produced and measure about the size of a small clipboard. Both are powered by the AT&amp;T Hobbit chip, created by AT&amp;T specifically for running code written in the C programming language. They feature I/O ports such as modem, parallel, serial, VGA out and SCSI. The devices come with a wireless cellular network modem, a built-in microphone with speaker, and a free subscription to AT&amp;T EasyLink Mail for both fax and e-mail messages.

The operating system, PenPoint OS, was created by GO Corporation. Widely praised for its simplicity and ease of use, the OS did not gain widespread use. The applications suite, Perspective, was licensed to EO by Pensoft.

<text>Major, also called the [[Willingdon, East Sussex|Willingdon]] Beauty during showings, is the first major character described by George Orwell in his 1945 novella &quot;Animal Farm&quot;. An elderly Middle White boar, his &quot;purebred&quot; of pigs is a kind, grandfatherly philosopher of change.

Major proposes a solution to the animals&#x27; desperate plight on Manor Farm under the Jones administration and inspires thoughts of a rebellion. He does not specify a time for the rebellion; it could be tomorrow or several generations down the road. But when he dies three days after delivering his speech, the animals immediately set to work on bringing about the rebellion, driving Jones and the farmhands off the farm and removing many of the implements of his rule.

The Seven Commandments that Snowball transcribes, which are supposed to encompass Major&#x27;s general philosophy, are gradually altered and deformed under Napoleon until they have entirely different meanings from those originally intended. &quot;Beasts of England&quot;, the song that came to Major in his dream, is later banned on Animal Farm by Napoleon and replaced by &quot;Comrade Napoleon&quot;, a hymn composed by Minimus the pig that pledges allegiance to Animal Farm and to work to protect it.

Major&#x27;s skull is dug up and saluted by the animals every day, even after the rebellion, as a sign of respect that the animals remember their roots and the roots of the Rebellion. Later, after Napoleon decides to accept the humans and strike bargains with them, he announces that the remains are to be disposed of because they represent the old days when Animal Farm was &quot;violent and primitive&quot; toward humans; toward the end of the story, Napoleon announces that he has reburied the skull.

In both film adaptations, Major dies while provoking the animals into rebelling. In the 1954 adaption (voiced by Maurice Denham), he dies suddenly while the animals are singing. In the 1999 version (voiced by Peter Ustinov), Farmer Jones slips in mud while investigating the sounds coming from the barn, setting off his shotgun and indirectly hitting Major in his backside so that he staggers backward and falls from the top of the barn to his death.

Major is broadly based on Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin.

<text>Alexander Dmitrievich Zasyadko (; ; 1779 – ) was a Russian general of Cossack origin. A military engineer, he played an important role in the development of rocket artillery in Russia.

== Biography ==

Zasyadko was born into a Cossack (his father had been the head of artillery of the Zaporozhian Cossacks) family in the village of Lyutenka, in the Poltava Governorate. In 1797, Zasyadko graduated from the in Saint Petersburg (today the building of the Cadet Corps hosts the A.F. Mozhaysky Military-Space Academy). 

In 1815, Zasyadko began his work on military gunpowder rockets. He built rocket-launching platforms, which allowed to fire in salvos (6 rockets at a time), and gun-laying devices, and also developed a tactics for the military use of rocket weaponry. In 1820, Zasyadko was appointed head of the Petersburg Armory, the Okhtensky Powder Factory, a pyrotechnic laboratory, and the first Higher Artillery School in Russia. In 1826 he was appointed chief of staff of the Russian artillery. The following year he was in charge of the Artillery Headquarters of the Russian army and took part in the Russo-Turkish War of 1828-1829, in which his rockets played an important role during the sieges of Brăila and Varna.

Zasyadko organised the development and production of rockets in a specialised workshop, and created the first rocket sub-unit in the Russian Imperial Army. Promoted to lieutenant general in 1829, due to ill health he retired from active service in 1834, settling in the Kharkov area, where his wife&#x27;s estate was located. He passed away in 1837.

<text>Ants Antson (11 November 1938 – 31 October 2015) was an Estonian speed skater who competed for the Soviet Union.

==Biography==
Antson trained at the Kalev Voluntary Sports Society. Coached by former World, Olympic, and European Champion Boris Shilkov, Antson had his best year in 1964, when he became European Allround Champion, won the 1500 m event at the 1964 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck, and set a new world record in the 3000 m. For his achievements that year, he received the Oscar Mathisen Award.

The two gold medals Antson won in 1964 turned out to be his only international medals, although he did win some national medals at the Soviet Allround Championships – gold in 1967, silver in 1965 and 1968, and bronze in 1966. He participated in the 1500 m at the 1968 Winter Olympics in Grenoble, but despite skating a new personal record, he finished only twelfth.

He retired shortly after the 1968 Games and worked as a sports official, first in the Soviet Estonian Committee for Physical Culture and Sports, and later with the Estonian Olympic Committee. At the 1992 Winter Olympics he became the first flag bearer for Estonia after it became independent from the Soviet Union.

In 1965, Antson married Estonian film actress Eve Kivi, the couple would divorce in 1972. He later married Ene Antson and the couple remained married until his death; one week and four days before his 77th birthday.

<doc id="1029819" wikidata="Q7411513" url="?curid=1029819" title="Samuel Gorton">
<text>Samuel Gorton (1593–1677) was an early settler and civic leader of the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations and President of the towns of Providence and Warwick. He had strong religious beliefs which differed from Puritan theology and was very outspoken, and he became the leader of a small sect known as Gortonians, Gortonists, or Gortonites. As a result, he was frequently in trouble with the civil and church authorities in the New England colonies.

Gorton was baptized in 1593 in Manchester, Lancashire, England and received an education from tutors in languages and English law. In 1637, he emigrated from England, settling first in Plymouth Colony, where he was soon ousted for his religious opinions and his demeanor towards the magistrates and ministers. He settled next in Portsmouth where he met with a similar fate, being whipped for his insubordination towards the magistrates. He next went to Providence Plantations where he once again encountered adverse circumstances, until he and a group of others purchased land from the Narragansett people. They settled south of the Pawtuxet River in an area which they called Shawomet.

Gorton refused to answer a summons following the complaints of two Indian sachems about being unfairly treated in a land transaction. He and several of his followers were forcefully taken away to Massachusetts, where he was tried for his beliefs and writings rather than for the alleged land transaction. He was sentenced to prison in Charlestown, though all but three of the presiding magistrates voted to give him the death sentence.

After being released, Gorton and two of his associates sailed to England where they obtained an official order of protection for his colony from the Earl of Warwick. During his stay in England, he was also very active in the Puritan underground, preaching in churches and conventicles known for their extreme religious positions. Once back in New England, he changed the name of Shawomet to Warwick in gratitude to his patron in England. He became part of the very civil authority which he had previously rejected, serving as an assistant, commissioner, deputy, and president of the two towns of Providence and Warwick.

He wrote a number of books, two of them while in England and several others following his return. He was a man of great learning and great intellectual breadth, and he believed passionately in God, the King, and the individual man; but he was harshly critical of the magistrates and ministers who filled positions that he considered meaningless. His beliefs and demeanor brought him admiration from his followers but condemnation from those in positions of authority, and he was reviled for more than a century after his death. In more recent times, some historians and writers have looked upon him more favorably, and some now consider him to be one of the great colonial leaders of Rhode Island.

== Ancestry and early life ==

Samuel Gorton was baptized on February 12, 1592/3 in Manchester, Lancashire, England, the son of Thomas and Anne Gorton from the chapelry of Gorton, a part of Manchester. His grandfather and great-grandfather were both also likely named Thomas Gorton of the same place. They were members of an ancient family, found in Gorton as early as 1332. While Gorton would later style himself &quot;gentleman&quot; and boast about the antiquity of his family, his parents were in fact of very modest means. When Gorton&#x27;s father made his will in December 1610, he described himself as a &quot;husbandman&quot; (a small farmer, below the status of a yeoman) and the value of his father&#x27;s estate was subsequently valued at just over £25.

Gorton was educated by tutors and became an accomplished scholar, particularly in the area of languages and English law. His library contained volumes &quot;in which the ancient statutes of his country were written.&quot; Gorton entered the cloth trade, and by the late 1620s, he was living in London. Here, he was variously described as a &quot;clothier,&quot; &quot;merchant,&quot; and &quot;factor of Blackwell hall.&quot; During the 1630s, while living in the parish of St. Olave Old Jewry, London, Gorton fell into debt and became entangled in various lawsuits. St. Olave was also a hotbed of unorthodox religious opinion, and Gorton soon came to adopt his own, highly eccentric and controversial theology. 

=== Gorton&#x27;s theology ===

Gorton&#x27;s early development centered around religious themes, and he was inspired by the Puritan challenge to the established Anglican Church in early 17th century England. However, his ideas were not in the mainstream of English Puritan thought, and most authorities who wrote about him considered his theology to be radical. Three of his religious mentors were John Saltmarsh, William Dell, and William Erbury, the first two being chaplains in Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s New Model Army, and Erbury a Welsh Puritan. All three of these men were considered to be unorthodox by their fellow clergymen.

Gorton&#x27;s belief was that the Holy Spirit was present in all human beings, giving each person a divinity and obscuring any distinction between a saint and sinner. Religious conversion, then, was the willingness to follow the dictates of this inner divinity, even against human authority. Gorton felt that emphasizing external ordinances, as opposed to the inner Spirit, compelled people to live under the ordinances of man rather than of Christ. This theology was embraced by the Seeker and Ranter movements, and later by the Quaker movement—though Gorton never personally identified with any of these groups.

Gorton viewed the ordinances promoted by governments with deep suspicion. His ideology of anti-authoritarianism was based on his belief in the equality of all men, and he felt that both civil and religious hierarchical systems &quot;denied the true priesthood of all believers.&quot; He considered an educated, professional ministry to be a form of Anti-Christ, a view also shared by both Dell and Erbury. He wrote in &quot;New Englands Memoriall&quot; (1669): &quot;I would have you know that I hold my call to preach... not inferior to the call of any minister in the country.&quot;

== Plymouth, Portsmouth, and Providence ==

Gorton was living in London when he filed suit in a chancery case in February 1634/5. His reasons for leaving England and sailing to America were given in his many writings. One biographer summarized these: &quot;He yearned for a country where he could be free to worship God according to what the Bible taught him, as God enabled him to understand it.&quot; Another biographer noted that &quot;Gorton was one of the noble spirits who esteemed liberty more than life, and, counting no sacrifice too great for the maintenance of principal, could not dwell at ease in a land where the inalienable rights of humanity were not acknowledged or were mocked at.&quot; Gorton himself wrote, &quot;I left my native country to enjoy liberty of conscience in respect to faith toward God and for no other end.&quot;

In March 1637, he arrived in Boston from London with his wife and several children at the height of the Antinomian Controversy. He sensed the growing hostility towards those with unorthodox theological views, such as Anne Hutchinson, and his stay there was short. He soon went to Plymouth Colony where he rented part of a house, becoming active in the community by volunteering during the Pequot War, as did his older brother Thomas. He soon had differences of opinion on religion with his landlord, and he was summoned to court in December 1638 based on the landlord&#x27;s complaints. In court, Gorton &quot;carried himself so mutinously and seditiously&quot; towards both magistrates and ministers that he was sentenced to find sureties for his good behavior during the remainder of his tenure in Plymouth, and given 14 days to be gone from the colony. He left Plymouth shortly, but his wife and children were allowed to remain there while he proceeded to Portsmouth on Rhode Island (now called Aquidneck Island), arriving in late December 1638. Here he became a resident, and on the last day of April 1639 he and 28 others signed a compact calling themselves subjects of King Charles and forming a &quot;civil body politick.&quot;

Things were no better for Gorton in Portsmouth than they had been in Plymouth. In 1640, his servant maid assaulted a woman whose cow had trespassed on his land, and this servant was ordered to court. Gorton refused to allow her to appear and went in her place. With his hostile attitude towards the judges, he was indicted on 14 counts, some of which were calling the magistrates &quot;Just Asses&quot; and calling a freeman in open court &quot;saucy boy and Jack-an-Apes.&quot; Governor Coddington said, &quot;All you that own the King take away Gorton and carry him to prison,&quot; to which Gorton replied, &quot;All you that own the King take away Coddington and carry him to prison.&quot; Since he had previously been imprisoned, he was sentenced to be whipped, and soon left Portsmouth for Providence Plantations.

Trouble continued to follow Gorton to Providence, where his democratic ideas concerning church and state led to a division of sentiment in this town. On 8 March 1641, Roger Williams wrote to Massachusetts magistrate John Winthrop, &quot;Master Gorton having abused high and low at Aquidneck, is now bewitching and bemadding poor Providence, both with his unclean and his foul censures of all the ministers of this country (for which myself in Christ&#x27;s name have withstood him) and also denying all visible and external ordinances in depth of Familism.&quot; Gorton used his talent and energy to consolidate many discontented settlers into a destructive party in the otherwise peaceful settlement established by Williams. This group became known as the Gortonists or Gortonites.

Gorton was never received as an inhabitant in Providence because of his disorderly course. At this point, he moved once again to an area called Pawtuxet along the Pawtuxet River, about five miles south of the settlement at Providence (later the dividing line between the Rhode Island towns of Cranston and Warwick).

== Pawtuxet and Warwick ==

At Pawtuxet, there was immediate friction and a rift among the settlers, with a majority of them adhering to Gorton&#x27;s views. The original Pawtuxet settlers were deeply offended by Gorton&#x27;s conduct, notably William Arnold, his son Benedict Arnold, his son-in-law William Carpenter, and Robert Coles. 

On November 17, 1641, these men sent a letter to Massachusetts in which they complained of the &quot;insolent and riotous carriage of Samuel Gorton and his company,&quot; and they petitioned Massachusetts to &quot;lend us a neighborlike helping hand.&quot; With no formal government established in the area, these Pawtuxet settlers put themselves under the jurisdiction of the Massachusetts Bay Colony in an arrangement that lasted 16 years. By doing this, they cooperated with Massachusetts in its quest to gain territories that would give them direct access to the Narragansett Bay, and they fueled a border conflict between Massachusetts and Rhode Island which continued for nearly 100 years. The Arnolds and their Pawtuxet partners assisted Massachusetts in efforts to remove Gorton and his followers from the entire region. For decades, territorial claims made by Massachusetts in the Narragansett region were an issue of contention for Roger Williams, who wanted to consolidate all of the towns around the Narragansett Bay into a unified government.

In January 1643, Gorton and 11 others bought a large tract of land south of Pawtuxet from Narragansett tribal chief Miantonomi for 144 fathoms of wampum (864 feet or 263 meters), and they called the place Shawomet, using its Indian name. Here the settlers felt safe from the Massachusetts authorities and sent them at least two letters that were &quot;filled with invective,&quot; presenting religious views that were anathema to the Puritan orthodoxy held by the Bay colony.

Gorton and others of Shawomet were summoned to the Boston court to answer complaints filed by two minor Indian sachems concerning some &quot;unjust and injurious dealing&quot; towards them. The Shawomet men refused the summons, claiming that they were loyal subjects of the King of England and beyond the jurisdiction of Massachusetts. Soldiers were sent after them, their writings were confiscated, and the men were taken to Boston for trial. Once in court, however, the charges against Gorton and the others had nothing to do with the original complaints, but instead were about Gorton&#x27;s letters, conduct, and religious views. The following charge was made against him:

Upon much examination and serious consideration of your writing, with your answers about them, we do charge you to be a blasphemous enemy of the true religion of our Lord Jesus Christ and his Holy Ordinances, and also of all civil authority among the people of God and particularly in this jurisdiction.

The magistrates ordered that Gorton be confined to Charlestown, to be kept at labor, and to wear bolts or irons in order to prevent his escape. He would be sentenced to death, upon a conviction by a jury trial, if he were to break confinement or to maintain any of the &quot;blasphemies or abominable heresies wherewith he hath been charged&quot;. All but three of the ruling magistrates gave Gorton the death sentence, though a majority of the deputies refused to sanction this. The sentencing took place in November 1643, but Gorton and the others were released from prison in March 1644, being banished from both Massachusetts and from Shawomet (which was now claimed by Massachusetts). Gorton and his associates were restricted from their own lands, so they went instead to Rhode Island and were warmly greeted by a faction of residents who were opposed to Governor Coddington.

== England ==

Gorton, Randall Holden, and John Greene boarded a ship in New Amsterdam in 1644 and sailed back to England, where Gorton spent four years seeking justice for the wrongs committed against them. In 1646, he published one of his many writings entitled &quot;Simplicity&#x27;s Defence Against Seven Headed Policy&quot;, detailing the injustices against the Shawomet settlers. The Commissioner of Plantations, responsible for overseeing the activities of the colonies, issued an order to Massachusetts to allow the residents of Shawomet and other nearby lands to &quot;freely and quietly live and plant&quot; without being disquieted by external pressures.

Gorton remained in England while Holden returned to the American colonies in 1646 and presented the order to the Massachusetts authorities, who found it unacceptable. New England sent former Plymouth governor Edward Winslow to England as their agent to present a case against Gorton. Winslow asserted that Gorton&#x27;s unorthodox preaching and submission to an inner spirit offered one &quot;an inconceivable political liberty.&quot; Ultimately, however, Winslow&#x27;s efforts failed when the English commission ruled in favor of Gorton.

This success did not end Gorton&#x27;s time in England, however; he had been called to preach, and he found many favorable audiences for his religious views. He was now seeing profound changes in thinking concerning toleration, unlike when he left England in 1637. Such attitudes were being embraced by parliamentary leaders who were seeking broad support in their war against the king. During his time in England, Gorton had become a prominent part of the Puritan underground, centered mostly around London, where divergent sectarian views were being shared and embraced. He became a highly sought preacher and spent most of his time at Thomas Lamb&#x27;s church in London&#x27;s Bell Alley. 

Lamb was most often termed a &quot;General Baptist&quot;, and he entertained what were considered the most radical forms of Puritanism in his church. Gorton was described by one of his detractors as venting his &quot;desperate opinions,&quot; while another opponent heard him &quot;declare the irrelevance of church ordinances and officers.&quot; One of Gorton&#x27;s extreme positions was in crossing traditional gender lines, and he likely preached at the conventicle of a woman who has only been identified as Sister Stag. It was clear that he viewed women with &quot;a spiritual and social equality unusual for that time&quot;, as did other Puritan radicals, a position that was later embraced by the Quakers.

== Later life ==

Gorton returned to New England in 1648, landing in Boston that May. Massachusetts Bay authorities ordered his arrest, but he had a letter of protection from Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick which saw him safely back to his family. In honor of the Earl&#x27;s intercession on his behalf, he changed the name of Shawomet to Warwick.

Gorton&#x27;s views on the role of government had transformed markedly during his time in England. He became actively involved in roles that he had previously criticized, now that his settlement of Warwick was secured by royal decree. The separate settlements of Providence Plantations, Portsmouth, Newport, and now Warwick all came together under a fragile government, choosing John Coggeshall as its first President in 1647 and calling itself the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations. With his success in England, Gorton was seen as a leader in the colony and he was chosen as the Warwick assistant (magistrate) in 1649 under colonial President John Smith, also from Warwick. Both Gorton and Smith declined their positions but were fined for doing so; they both ultimately served and their fines were remitted.

William Coddington was in England during this time on a mission to remove the island towns of Newport and Portsmouth from the government with Providence and Warwick, hoping to set himself up as Governor for Life of Newport and Portsmouth. In 1651, Gorton was chosen as President of the colony, but Coddington had been successful in gaining his commission to put the island towns under his own authority, so Gorton presided only over the plantations of Providence and Warwick. In 1652, Smith was once again selected as president and Gorton was once again the assistant from Warwick. A remarkable statute during this administration was likely authored by Gorton, an act for the emancipation of slaves.

Following his brief time as a magistrate, Gorton remained active in the civil affairs of Warwick. He was chosen as a commissioner during a majority of the years from 1651 to 1663, and his name appears on a list of Warwick freemen in 1655. He was one of several prominent citizens named in Rhode Island&#x27;s Royal Charter of 1663. Also, he was the Warwick Deputy to the General Assembly for four years during the last half of the 1660s. He last served in a public capacity in 1670 when he was 78 years old.

In 1675, Gorton had received word that the Indians living in the Connecticut Colony intended to invade the Narragansett country, and later in the same year King Phillips War broke out in the New England colonies. The Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations took no active role in provoking the conflict, but its geographical location caused it to suffer more than any other colony. The people of Warwick were forced to flee their homes during the war and returned in the spring of 1677 to a barren wasteland and the task of rebuilding.

Gorton did not leave a will, but several deeds to his heirs on November 27, 1677, distributed his properties, and in one of these instruments he called himself &quot;professor of the mysteries of Christ.&quot; He was dead by December 10, though the exact date of his death was not recorded. He is buried in the Samuel Gorton Cemetery, Rhode Island Historic Cemetery, Warwick #67, at 422 Samuel Gorton Avenue in Warwick, and his grave is marked with a governor&#x27;s medallion and an uninscribed field stone.

== Beliefs, demonization, and restitution ==

Gorton left a comfortable life in England to enjoy liberty of conscience in the English colonies of America. According to Rhode Island historian Thomas Bicknell, he was a man of intense individualism who recognized three pillars of power: &quot;God, the Supreme One; the King, his vicegerent; and himself, the individual man. Between these he recognized no other source of authority. The freedom of the individual was only limited by the express will of God or the King.&quot; He and his followers held that &quot;by union with Christ, believers partook of the perfection of God, that Christ is both human and divine, and that Heaven and Hell exist only in the mind.&quot;

The following are some of the activities for which he and his followers were imprisoned, whipped, put to hard labor, and banished, and had their cattle, food, and property confiscated:
* teaching that heaven and hell were states existing in the hearts of men and women, rather than a material place where people reside in an afterlife 
* teaching that the baptism of infants would not save a baby&#x27;s soul, since babies had no capacity to understand or accept the concepts of Christianity (a position also held by Roger Williams and other Baptists)
* teaching that the ministers and magistrates should not be the sole or ultimate authorities of how biblical interpretations were enforced with criminal laws
* teaching that God is a unity rather than a trinity 
* objecting to the mandatory paying of tithes to a state church, and mandatory attendance, since salvation came through individual faith freely chosen, and not from conformity to denominational creeds and ritual

In his day, Gorton was largely reviled by those who were not his followers, and his insolence towards colonial leaders made him the butt of most early writers of Rhode Island&#x27;s colonial history. Nathaniel Morton was the keeper of the Plymouth records for years, and he published a &quot;libellous and scandalous&quot; book about Gorton while he was still alive. On June 30, 1669, Gorton wrote a lengthy letter of denial, refuting virtually every point made by Morton. More than a century later, however, Rhode Island Secretary of State Samuel Eddy wrote, &quot;In the case of Gorton... no one of the first settlers has received more unmerited reproach, nor any one suffered so much injustice. His opinions on religious subjects were probably somewhat singular, though certainly not more so than in any at this day. But that was &quot;his&quot; business; his opinions were &quot;his own&quot; and he had a &quot;right&quot; to them.&quot; Later, Rhode Island historian and Lieutenant Governor Samuel G. Arnold wrote of Gorton:

Gorton was described as being gentle and sympathetic in private intercourse, and generous and sympathetic in nature. He gave to others the same liberty of thought and expression that he claimed for himself. One of his biographers wrote that, after Roger Williams, no man was more instrumental in establishing the foundation of equal civil rights and liberty in Rhode Island. Puritan scholar Philip Gura sees him as &quot;not a dangerous and immoral troublemaker but rather a man who, more than any other New Englander, was in step with the religious politics of his times and whose history illuminates the complexity of the relationship of American to English Puritanism.&quot;

== Writings by and about Gorton ==

Gorton&#x27;s first book was &quot;Simplicities Defence&quot;. He wrote another book while in England entitled &quot;An Incorruptible Key composed of the CX. Psalms wherewith you may open the rest of the Scriptures&quot;. This book was published in 1647 and expanded the commentary on his radical beliefs. After returning to New England, he wrote &quot;Saltmarsh returned from the Dead&quot; (1655), inspired by the new model army chaplain John Saltmarsh who had died in 1647. The sequel to this was &quot;An Antidote against the Common Plague of the World&quot; (1656) which was dedicated to Oliver Cromwell. This volume centers on Matthew 23, in which the scribes and Pharisees are condemned for degrading God&#x27;s will and word. Gorton&#x27;s final published work was &quot;Antidote Against Pharisaical Teachers&quot; (1656), though he left behind an unpublished manuscript of several hundred pages entitled &quot;Exposition upon the Lord&#x27;s Prayer&quot;.

Two book-length biographical accounts of Gorton have been published. In 1896, Lewis G. Janes published &quot;Samuel Gorton: a forgotten Founder of our Liberties&quot;. Adelos Gorton published &quot;The Life and Times of Samuel Gorton&quot; in 1907, which includes an extensive account of Rhode Island&#x27;s earliest colonial records.

== Family and descendants ==

Samuel Gorton was married before January 11, 1629/30 to Mary Mayplet, the daughter of haberdasher John Mayplet. Mary was the granddaughter of the Reverend John Mayplet, Rector of Great Leighs Parish in Essex, Vicar of Northolt in Middlesex, and a writer on the topics of natural history and astrology. Her brother was Dr. John Mayplet, physician to King Charles II.

<text>John Thomas Yunits, Jr. (born January 24, 1952, in Brockton, Massachusetts) is the former mayor of Brockton, the 4th largest city in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

A city attorney and father of four, Yunits unseated a sitting incumbent in 1995, sweeping all of the city&#x27;s 28 precincts. He was re-elected in 1997, 1999, 2001, and 2003, becoming the city&#x27;s longest-serving mayor and the first in the city&#x27;s history to be elected to five terms.

Yunits was able to bring both business and civic leaders together for a number of exciting new developments including the construction of Campanelli Stadium and the Shaw&#x27;s Center. He profoundly influenced the landscape of Brockton by providing an atmosphere of cooperation and understanding to the myriad and complex problems that confront an older urban area. Under his leadership and guidance, dozens of new businesses moved to the city - creating and maintaining over 2500 jobs - and he continually supported the arts and the effort to beautify the downtown.

During his tenure, the city&#x27;s real estate value increased by over $3 billion in total value and the median price of a single family home rose from $81,500 in 1995 to over $234,000 in 2004. Nearly 38 miles of Brockton roads were either resurfaced or improved through water and sewer infrastructure upgrades. Brockton built three new schools, and the public school system was recognized by the State&#x27;s Department of Education for excellence in MCAS performance.

Yunits chose not to run for re-election in 2005, and was followed by James Harington.

A graduate of Boston College High School, Boston College, and the New England School of Law, Yunits later served as president of the Brockton Rox, a professional baseball team.

<text>São Pedro is a municipality in the state of São Paulo in Brazil. The population is of 35,980 (2020) in an area of .

== History ==
The brothers Joaquim, José and Luiz Teixeira de Barros, who came from Itu, bought the Pinheiros Sesmaria where São Pedro is today. They brought with them: slaves, employees and family members. The Picadão, a road that led from São Paulo to Cuiabá, passed through this same area and where the historic center is today was the so-called Pouso do Pidadão, which was looked after by the cattle driver Floriano de Costa Pereira, known as Florianão.

Of the Teixeira de Barros brothers, Joaquim was considered the “settler” and, as was customary, he built a small chapel whose patron saint was Saint Sebastian. Authorized by the Catholic Church, it was given the name Capela do Picadão. 

The name and patron saint did not please the population and it was soon changed to Capela de São Pedro. The fertility of the land attracted other families, and in 1864 the settlement was elevated to the status of Parish. In 1867, the first priest, Father Aurélio Votta, an Italian, arrived. In 1879, the Baron of Iguape, Captain Veríssimo Antônio da Silva Prado, who settled here as a farmer, managed to raise the status of a town. Later, in 1881, he managed to separate Piracicaba from the city and, in 1882, to the district, and the first judge, João Baptista Pinto de Toledo, arrived.

The Italian immigration period of 1890 and the production of coffee gave the municipality a boost.

The railroad branch arrived in 1893. During this coffee period, the Santa Casa de Misericórdia, cemetery, school, jail, city hall and chamber were established, in addition to the main church.

In the 1920s, the search for oil discovered water sources and the beginning of Termas de São Pedro, today Águas de São Pedro, which was emancipated in the 1940s. Around 1934, the then directors of Companhia Petróleos do Brasil, created by Monteiro Lobato in 1931, Ângelo Balloni and Vittorio Miglieta, coordinated the installation of the Balloni II well, which became a landmark for being considered the deepest drilled well reached in Brazil (1,815 m). The rig remains in place to this day.

<text>Robert Malise Bowyer Nichols (6 September 1893 – 17 December 1944) was an English writer, known as a war poet of the First World War, and a playwright.

==Life and career==
The son of the poet John Bowyer Buchanan Nichols, Robert Nichols was educated at Winchester College and Trinity College, Oxford. Commissioned into the Royal Field Artillery in 1914, Nichols served on the Western Front, including the Battle of Loos and the Battle of the Somme, until invalided home with shell shock in August 1916.

He began to give poetry readings, in 1917. In 1918 he was a member of an official British propaganda mission to the USA, where he also gave readings. One of his best known poems of the conflict is &quot;The Assault&quot;, which &quot;evokes the destructive havoc and the emotional turbulence of an attack in verse of unusual freedom and energy&quot;

After the war he moved in social circles in London. He was a protege of Edith Sitwell, Aldous Huxley became a long-term friend and correspondent, and Nichols wooed Nancy Cunard with sonnets, but married Norah Denny in 1922 at St Martin-in-the-Fields. He was Professor of English Literature at the University of Tokyo from 1921 to 1924, and later worked in the theatre and cinema. The play &quot;Wings over Europe&quot; (1928), with Maurice Browne, was a Broadway hit. Nichols wrote several prose fictions, including &quot;The Smile of the Sphinx&quot;, a fantasy set in the Middle East and &quot;Golgotha &amp; co.&quot;, a satirical fantasy featuring the Wandering Jew, the return of Christ and a future war. These fictions were collected in Nichols&#x27; book &quot;Fantastica&quot;.

He lived in Germany and Austria in 1933–34. He then settled in the south of France, leaving in June 1940. He died at the age of 51, and is buried at St Mary&#x27;s Church, Lawford, Essex, next to the family home, Lawford Hall.
On 11 November 1985, Nichols was among 16 Great War poets commemorated on a slate stone unveiled in Westminster Abbey&#x27;s Poet&#x27;s Corner. The inscription on the stone was taken from Wilfred Owen&#x27;s &quot;Preface&quot; to his poems and reads: &quot;My subject is War, and the pity of War. The Poetry is in the pity.&quot;

==Musical settings of plays and poetry==
In 1919, the English composer Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji wrote &quot;Music to &quot;The Rider by Night&quot;&quot; (not extant in full). Peter Warlock (a close friend) composed a choral setting of &quot;The Full Heart&quot; in 1916, and a song setting of &quot;The Water Lily&quot; in 1922, along with others, now lost. &quot;The Naiads&#x27; Music&quot; and &quot;The Pigeon Song&quot; were set by Arthur Bliss (also a friend) in his &quot;Pastoral: (Lie Strewn White Flocks)&quot; of 1928, and Bliss also used &quot;Dawn on the Somme&quot; in his choral symphony &quot;Morning Heroes&quot; of 1930. E. J. Moeran set &quot;Blue-eyed Spring&quot; for voice and piano in 1932 and used poetry from the unfinished play &quot;Don Juan Tenorio the Great&quot; for his &quot;Nocturne&quot; for baritone solo, chorus and orchestra of 1935. Christian Darnton set five poems by Nichols in his 1938 work &quot;Swansong&quot;, for soprano and orchestra.

<text>Raw was a comics anthology edited by Art Spiegelman and Françoise Mouly and published in the United States by Mouly from 1980 to 1991. It was a flagship publication of the 1980s alternative comics movement, serving as a more intellectual counterpoint to Robert Crumb&#x27;s visceral &quot;Weirdo&quot;, which followed squarely in the underground tradition of &quot;Zap&quot; and &quot;Arcade&quot;. Along with the more genre-oriented &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; it was also one of the main venues for European comics in the United States in its day.

== Publication history ==
===Origins===
Spiegelman has often described the reasoning and process that led Mouly to start the magazine. After the demise of &quot;Arcade&quot;, the &#x27;70s underground comix anthology he co-edited with Bill Griffith, and the general waning of the underground scene, Spiegelman despaired that comics for adults might fade away for good. He had sworn not to work on another magazine where he would be editing his peers because of the tension and jealousies involved, but Mouly had her own reasons for wanting to do just that. Having set up her small publishing company, Raw Books &amp; Graphics, in 1977, she envisioned a magazine encompassing the range of her graphic and literary interests as a more attractive prospect than publishing a series of books. Spiegelman finally agreed on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1979 to co-edit. The magazine was to provide an outlet for the kinds of comics that had difficulty finding a publisher in the US, in particular younger cartoonists who fit neither the superhero nor the underground mold, and European cartoonists who did not fit the sex-and-sci-fi appetites of &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; fans.

At the time, large-format, graphic punk and New Wave design magazines like &quot;Wet&quot; were distributed in independent bookstores. Mouly had earlier installed a printing press in her and Spiegelman&#x27;s fourth floor walk-up Soho loft and experimented with different bindings and printing techniques. Mouly&#x27;s approach was hands-on, and she gave great attention to every step of the printing process. She and Spiegelman eventually settled on a very bold, large-scale and upscale package. Calling &quot;Raw&quot; a &quot;graphix magazine&quot;, they hoped their unprecedented approach would bypass readers&#x27; prejudices against comics and force them to look at the work with new eyes.

=== Volume 1 ===
In the midst of a commercial and artistic fallow period in the American comics industry, the lavishly-printed, first issue of &quot;Raw&quot; appeared in July 1980. Its production values resulted in a $3.50 cover price, several times the going prices for comics, either mainstream or underground.

The first eight issues of &quot;Raw&quot; (Volume 1), published by Mouly and co-edited by Mouly and Spiegelman, were printed in black-and-white in an enormous, doormat-sized magazine format with a stapled binding. The physicality of &quot;Raw&quot; was evident in each issue: tipped-in plates, bubblegum cards, and torn covers were part of the aesthetic of the magazine, accomplished by hand by Mouly, Spiegelman, and friends at gatherings after the printing of a new issue.

For example, one issue came with &quot;City of Terror&quot; trading cards and gum; another issue contained a flexi disc with a sound collage made from excerpts of Ronald Reagan&#x27;s speeches; a third issue had a corner torn off the cover, with the missing corner from a &quot;different&quot; copy taped inside.

In 1987 Pantheon Books published a book collection of pieces from the first three issues titled &quot;Read Yourself Raw&quot;.

=== Volume 2 ===
The final three issues of &quot;Raw&quot; (Volume 2) were printed in a &quot;digest&quot; or &quot;paperback&quot; format with a mixture of full-color and black-and-white pages, some of which were printed on differing paper stock. They featured longer stories that focused more on narrative than bold graphic experiments. These issues were published by Penguin Books.

In 1991, Mouly and Spiegelman published the final issue of &quot;Raw&quot;, which was no longer a small, hands-on operation, nor was it something they still thought necessary, as the artists then had a range of publishing outlets that had not existed when &quot;Raw&quot; first saw the light of day.

==Contents==
Among the comics the first issue contained was the only strip Mouly herself was to produce, &quot;Industry News and Review No. 6&quot;, an autobiographical strip in which she contemplates her late-1970s anxieties and thoughts of suicide. Other strips in the eclectic anthology included an example of the early 20th-century newspaper strip &quot;Dream of the Rarebit Fiend&quot; by Winsor McCay, and an excerpt from &quot;Manhattan&quot; by contemporary French cartoonist Jacques Tardi.

As an editor, Mouly was hands-on, suggesting ideas and changes — an approach considered anathema to the editor-adverse underground spirit, but artists welcomed her input as in the end she did not interfere with their autonomy.

&quot;Raw&quot; featured a mix of American and European contributors (including some of Spiegelman&#x27;s students at the School of Visual Arts), as well as various contributors from other parts of the world, including the Argentine duo of José Antonio Muñoz and Carlos Sampayo, the Congolese painter Chéri Samba, and several Japanese cartoonists known for their work in &quot;Garo&quot;. Each issue contained a broad variety of styles linked by a common theme, be it urban despair, suicide, or a vision of America through foreign eyes.

To comics academic Jeet Heer, &quot;Raw&quot; was &quot;a singular mixture of visual diversity and thematic unity&quot;.

The best-known work to run in &quot;Raw&quot; was a serialization of Spiegelman&#x27;s (eventual) Pulitzer Prize–winning graphic novel &quot;Maus&quot;, which ran as an insert for the duration of the magazine from the December 1980 second issue.

Individual chapters were packaged as small comic books bound within each issue of &quot;Raw&quot; Volume 1; starting with &quot;Raw&quot; Volume 2 (a few color comics, such as Spiegelman&#x27;s &quot;Two-Fisted Painters: The Matisse Falcon&quot; and Yoshiharu Tsuge&#x27;s &quot;Red Flowers&quot;, were also packaged as inserts). By Volume 2 &quot;Raw&quot;″s own dimensions had shrunk to match those of &quot;Maus&quot;.

Although comics were the main focus, many issues included galleries of non-comics illustration and illustrated prose or non-fiction pieces; for example, &quot;Raw&quot; Volume 2, #2 featured one of the earliest published articles on Henry Darger, complete with fold-out color reproductions of his paintings and diaries. &quot;Raw&quot; also frequently reprinted public domain works by cartoonists and illustrators of historical significance such as George Herriman, Gustave Doré, and Winsor McCay.

== Reception ==
&quot;Raw&quot; had a strong critical reception, and also sold surprisingly well. It was also not without its critics, who charged it with being highbrow and elitist, or claimed it to be a one-man Spiegelman show.

Pioneer underground cartoonist Robert Crumb responded in 1981 with the magazine &quot;Weirdo&quot;, intended to remain free of editorial intrusion and stay true to comics&#x27; lowbrow roots.

==Spin-offs==
Several solo books by &quot;Raw&quot; contributors were published with the subtitle &quot;A &quot;Raw&quot; One-Shot&quot;. Other solo books were labeled &quot;A &quot;Raw&quot; Book&quot;.

In 2000, Mouly started a Raw Junior division and launched the &quot;Little Lit&quot; series. These hardcover anthologies of children&#x27;s comics were published by HarperCollins/Joanna Cotler Books, and featured work by some of &quot;Raw&quot;&#x27;s most famous contributors as well as established children&#x27;s book artists such as Maurice Sendak and Ian Falconer.

In the spring of 2008, Mouly&#x27;s Raw Junior division launched the first Toon Books. This collection of 6&quot; × 9&quot; hardcover comics for children claimed to be the first time anyone had published comics specifically for young children learning to read, and brought Mouly (together with Spiegelman, who was an advisor) full-circle back to her roots as a small publisher, confirming her as one of comics&#x27; most persistent groundbreakers.

<doc id="1029849" wikidata="Q7964088" url="?curid=1029849" title="Walt Willis">
<text>Walter Alexander Willis (1919–1999) was a well-known Irish science fiction fan, resident in Belfast.

==Work==
Willis was awarded a 1958 Hugo Award as &quot;Outstanding Actifan&quot; (active fan), which replaced the Best Fanzine category that year. He was nominated for a best fan writer Hugo in 1969 and two retro-Hugos in the same category (in 2001, 2004 for work in 1951, 1954). In 1959 and 1957 he was nominated in the fanzine category for &quot;Hyphen&quot;, and he received fanzine retro-Hugo nominations in 2004 for &quot;Slant&quot; and &quot;Hyphen&quot;. He shared a retro-Hugo for &quot;Slant&quot; with that fanzine&#x27;s art editor James White.

His best known single work is &quot;The Enchanted Duplicator&quot; (1954), co-written with Bob Shaw, an allegory of a fan&#x27;s quest to produce the perfect fanzine. This appeared to be closely modeled on The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress by John Bunyan (though Willis and Shaw denied having read it beforehand).

Along with White, Shaw, George Charters, Ian McAulay, and John Berry (an English policeman then with the Belfast force), Willis represented the influential Irish Fandom, also known as the Wheels of IF (named after the L. Sprague de Camp fantasy story and collection). Willis, White and Shaw were also referred to as the Belfast Triangle.

Willis was known for his droll, humorous writing, especially in a column &quot;The Harp That Once or Twice&quot; that began in the US fanzine &quot;Quandry&quot; edited by Lee Hoffman in 1951. This led to Willis&#x27;s fame in US science fiction fandom and to his attending the 1952 Worldcon in Chicago as a special guest, recipient of travel funds raised by fans, under the leadership of fan Shelby Vick, who called the fund-raising &quot;the Willis Campaign,&quot; with the slogan, &quot;WAW with the crew in &#x27;52!&quot; which led to the establishment of the annual TransAtlantic Fan Fund. Willis published the founding document for TAFF in &quot;Hyphen 4&quot; (October 1953) following a discussion with &quot;the available leaders of British fandom&quot; at that year&#x27;s Coroncon. This in turn inspired funds such as the Down Under Fan Fund between Australia and the United States and the Get Up and over Fan Fund (GUFF) between Britain and Australia. Willis&#x27;s humorous articles about his trip (later collected in a single volume as &quot;The Harp Stateside&quot; (1957)) established the tradition of fund-winners (and other fan travelers) writing trip reports, usually as separate chapters printed in different fanzines on both sides of the funded trip. The Willis Campaign was not the first attempt by fans to arrange such a visit, but its huge success in promoting international good will encouraged the regular fan funds and also various one-off individual travel funds.

From 1952 to 1959 Willis wrote the &quot;Fanorama&quot; column in the British science fiction magazine &quot;Nebula&quot;.

He attended the 1992 Worldcon in Orlando, Florida, as the Fan Guest of Honor.

He published one book professionally, under the pseudonym Walter Bryan: &quot;The Improbable Irish&quot; (1969), a linked sequence of mostly humorous essays about Ireland, its history and its people.

In 1980, Richard Bergeron, also a former publisher of Willis&#x27;s fan writing, produced a 600-page hardcover mimeographed fanzine, issue 28 of his fanzine &quot;Warhoon&quot;, devoted to collecting most of Willis&#x27;s fannish writings.

<text>; ) was an Italian jazz vocal quartet established during the early 1940s and active until 1988.

==Career==
The band was based on the Mills Brothers and started performing under the name Quartetto Egie from the initials of the singers&#x27; first names: Enrico Gentile, Giovanni Giacobetti, Iacopo Jacomelli, and Enrico De Angelis. Although they sang American songs such as &quot;Tiger Rag&quot;, they wrote songs and scatted in Italian. Quartetto Egie made its debut on 27 May 1940 at the Valle Theatre in Rome. They performed the song &quot;Bambina dall&#x27;abito blu&quot; (&quot;Little Girl in a Blue Dress&quot;). When Virgilio Savona replaced Iacopo Jacomelli, the band was renamed Quartetto Ritmo. Then in 1941, Felice Chiusano replaced Enrico Gentile and the group was renamed Quartetto Cetra and performed on the radio review &quot;Riepilogando&quot; in 1941

In October 1947, Enrico De Angelis left the group to join the Army and was replaced by singer Lucia Mannucci, the wife of Virgilio Savona. This group lasted for four decades. The first song they performed together was &quot;Dove siete stata nella notte del 3 giugno?&quot; (&quot;Where were you on the night of June 3?&quot;). In 1948 Quartetto Cetra dubbed the choruses for the Italian release of the Disney movie &quot;Dumbo&quot;. They received a complimentary note signed by Walt Disney. Afterwards they dubbed other movies in Italian, such as &quot;Make Mine Music&quot;, &quot;Melody Time&quot;, and &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;.

Quartetto Cetra made their stage debut in Pietro Garinei and Sandro Giovannini&#x27;s &quot;Gran Baldoria&quot; review in 1951 at Teatro Nuovo in Milan. This was the first of several musical comedies the group would be involved with. On stage, the Cetras worked with other Italian celebrities such Wanda Osiris and Alberto Sordi.

When Italian television started broadcasting in 1954, Quartetto Cetra made its first domestic television appearance on &quot;In quattro si viaggia meglio&quot; (&quot;You travel better when you&#x27;re four&quot;). They had appeared on British television in 1948 in &quot;Café Continental&quot;. With time the group worked on other TV programmes, including parodies of novels such as &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; and &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;.

The quartet&#x27;s early style resembled the Mills Brothers&#x27; with jazz and swing vocal arrangements. They collaborated with Franco Cerri and Gorni Kramer. The group then performed catchy tunes with funny lyrics and sophisticated arrangements that were performed in comedy acts. Commercial success encouraged Quartetto Cetra to perform on radio, stage, and television. The band&#x27;s repertoire included more than a thousand songs. Most were written by Giacobetti and Savona. These include &quot;Il Visconte di Castelfombrone&quot;, &quot;In un palco della Scala&quot;, &quot;Un disco dei Platters&quot;,&quot;&#x27;Nella vecchia fattoria&quot; (Italian version of Old MacDonald Had a Farm), &quot;Vecchia America&quot;, &quot;Che centrattacco&quot; (dedicated to footballer Virgilio Levratto), &quot;Un bacio a mezzanotte&quot; and &quot;I ricordi della sera&quot;. Their song &quot;Crapa Pelada (Testa Pelata)&quot; (&quot;Bald Head&quot;) was used on the American television series &quot;Breaking Bad&quot; in the final episode of the third season. Quartetto Cetra performed for the last time on 1 July 1988, in Bologna, Italy.

<text>Enrico Gentile (born 20 January 1921) is an Italian retired jazz and pop singer.

==Biography==
In 1940 he founded a vocal quartet named Quartetto Egie together with Tata Giacobetti, Iacopo Jacomelli, and Enrico De Angelis. They made their debut on 27 May 1940 at the Valle Theatre in Rome. They performed the song &quot;Bambina dall&#x27;abito blu&quot; (&quot;little girl in a blue dress&quot;). After a few months, De Angelis and Jacomelli left the group, which replaced them with Felice Chiusano and Virgilio Savona, and changed name to Quartetto Cetra.

In 1941 Enrico Gentile left the quartet. He was replaced by Savona&#x27;s wife, Lucia Mannucci.

After the Second World War he ventured on a solo career. Between 1946 and 1950 he had twelve songs in the Italian best-selling lists, including &quot;Eulalia Torricelli&quot;, &quot;Che musetto&quot;, &quot;I pompieri di Viggiù&quot;.

<doc id="1029866" wikidata="Q3539511" url="?curid=1029866" title="Wellington station (MBTA)">
<text>Wellington station is a Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) Orange Line rapid transit station in Medford, Massachusetts, near the border of Everett. It is located on the Revere Beach Parkway (Route 16), slightly east of its intersection with Route 28. Wellington functions as a park and ride with more than 1,300 spaces, and a bus hub with routes terminating at the station. The Station Landing development, connected to the station by an overhead walkway, includes residential and retail buildings and additional parking. Wellington Carhouse, the primary repair and maintenance facility for the Orange Line, is located adjacent to the station.

The Boston and Maine Railroad opened through the east part of what is now Medford in 1845, followed by the Medford Branch in 1847. Wellington station was soon opened near the junction; it closed with the end of passenger service on the branch in 1957. The modern station opened in September 1975 as part of the Haymarket North Extension. It was made accessible in the 1990s. An automated people mover to the adjacent development opened in 1997 and closed in 2006; it has since been replaced by a footbridge.

==Station layout==

Three Orange Line tracks run north–south through Wellington station. Only the west (southbound) and center (northbound) Orange Line tracks are used for revenue service; the unused east track, originally intended for express service, is only used for maintenance and testing. A pair of island platforms are located between the Orange Line tracks; the west platform serves trains in both directions, while the east platform serves only northbound trains. The single Haverhill Line track is located east of the Orange Line tracks. The fare mezzanine is located over the north end of the station.

Wellington Yard, the primary maintenance and storage facility for the Orange Line fleet, is located west of the station. A parking garage shared by the station and the Station Landing development is west of the yard. It is connected to the fare mezzanine with an -long enclosed walkway. Wellington station is fully accessible from both entrances, with elevators connecting the mezzanine to the platforms. A footbridge at the south end of the station connects only to the maintenance facility and is not in public use.

Wellington is a major MBTA bus transfer station, with service to Medford, Everett, Malden and other surrounding cities. Buses serve the station via a dedicated three-lane busway inside the parking lot on the eastern side of the station. Wellington is served by MBTA bus routes .
==History==
===Boston and Maine station===
The Boston and Maine Railroad&#x27;s Western Route main line was built through the east side of what is now Medford in 1845, and the Medford branch from Medford Junction to Medford Square opened in 1847. Wellington station, also called Medford Junction, was in use by 1852. Located between 5th Street and 6th Street about to the south of the junction, it served as the connection between the mainline and the Medford branch. The station was originally located in Everett; the east tract of Wellington Farm, including the station area, was annexed to Medford in 1875. By the 1920s, Wellington station was a two-story wooden building located on the west side of the tracks. The station building was abandoned around 1943, along with Glenwood and Park Street on the branch, to reduce the B&amp;M tax bill. The station served only Medford Branch local service by the 1940s; it closed with the end of passenger service on the branch on October 1, 1957.

===Modern station===
Unlike the Washington Street Elevated which was built at the same time with a similar design, the Charlestown El was located very near Boston Harbor and the Mystic River tidal estuary, and was thus continually exposed to accelerated corrosion caused by salt air. The elevated was also unpopular with many local residents, as it was noisy and blocked out sunlight to Main Street. In the 1960s, it was determined that a replacement elevated would not be wise to build, and that a full-length replacement tunnel would be too expensive.

Instead, the Haymarket North Extension project consisted of a tunnel segment from Haymarket near Boston&#x27;s downtown through a new underground stop at North Station, then under the Charles River to a portal near Community College. From there the extension was built along the Haverhill Line commuter rail right of way, lowering land acquisition difficulties.

When planning the line in the mid-1960s, the MBTA decided that the 40-acre Wellington Dump site, located south of the previous station sites, was the best location for a rapid transit stop to serve the east part of Medford. The new site provided ample room for parking and bus transfer areas, as well as a maintenance depot to replace the Sullivan Square shops (which were being torn down with the Elevated), plus easy access to Route 16 and Route 28.

Wellington Yard opened on July 15, 1975, followed by the station on September 6, as part of the second phase of the Haymarket North Extension. The building could hold three-and-a-half six-car trains. Wellington was the first station on the line to serve an area that had not previously had rapid transit, unlike Sullivan Square and Community College which approximately replaced former elevated stations. Wellington was the northern terminus of the Orange Line until Malden Center opened on December 27, 1975, and some trains terminated at Wellington until Oak Grove opened on March 20, 1977. From February 1 to December 16, 1981, Malden Center and Oak Grove stations were closed on Sundays as part of systemwide austerity program. Wellington was the northern terminus of the line on these days, with a bus shuttle run to the closed stations.

Wellington station was not originally accessible. Addition of elevators at Wellington and Sullivan Square began in 1991. The entire Orange Line, including Wellington station, was closed from August 19 to September 18, 2022, during maintenance work. The Encore Boston Harbor casino ran shuttles to Wellington from its June 2019 opening until July 2024.

===Development===
In 1969, Mayor and State Representative John McGlynn sponsored the first of two bills to permit air rights development over the station and Route 16. The same year, Medford received a letter of agreement from the MBTA to build a parking garage over the tracks and the planned maintenance facility to free up development space. Unlike most MBTA stations, air rights over the station are owned by the city of Medford rather than by the MBTA.

After city-done studies of population and land use, the Massachusetts Department of Public Works and the Federal Highway Administration held a study of several development options for Wellington, which would have involved air rights construction directly over the station. Options considered in this 1976 report included a minimum residential/transit deck, a moderate residential/transit garage, or a full-build shopping center, office, residential, nursing home, and transit garage. These plans also called for the 16/28 intersection to be partially grade separated, and a traffic circle to replace the blind underpass used for automobile and bus access to the station.

Based on this study, the city of Medford continued to pursue development at Wellington. The preferred alternative in the 1981 Final Environmental Impact Statement included a parking garage built above the carhouse and rail yard, additional parking and a retail mall between the yard and Route 28, hotel and office space over the original parking lots, and condominiums and elderly housing northeast of the 16/28 intersection. Route 16 would have been placed in an underpass at the intersection, the ramps from 16 to the station parking improved, and a full park built along the riverfront.

However, the planned developments were only partially built, and none of the planned interchange improvements came to fruition. The first new construction was several office buildings in the northeast parcel in the early 1990s, followed by the Wellington Garage west of the rail yard in 1997. The MBTA agreed to lease 950 spaces of the 1350-space, 9-level garage for 15 years, after which the MBTA took ownership of 600 of the spaces and the remainder reverted to the developer. The Station Landing complex, envisioned as new urbanist transit-oriented development, was constructed over much of that time period, finishing around 2012. The project included 600 condominiums in a 12-story complex, of retail space (with the possibility of over 1 million square feet at full build), and an expansion of the garage to 1900 spaces.

Some of the property fronting the Mystic River has been turned into parkland; the first three of four stages of the Wellington Greenway opened in November 2012. The trail, funded by the Massachusetts Environmental Trust and developers Preotle, Lane &amp; Associates, runs partially along the embankment of the Haverhill Line&#x27;s former Mystic River drawbridge.

In September 2022, the city requested proposals for development on two sites at the station: a parcel over the yard, station, and Orange Line tracks; and a parcel over the station parking lots. The development would have to accommodate an MBTA electric bus garage, which is expected to replace the existing Fellsway Garage by 2029. Eight developers submitted proposals.

===People mover===
In May 1996, construction began on an automated people mover to connect the station with the Mystic Center (later &quot;Station Landing&quot;) office complex and park and ride. Completed in October 1997 at a cost of $2.9 million, the &quot;horizontal elevator&quot; was designed to carry 1,000 commuters a day at speeds up to taking about 55 seconds to travel end to end.

Constructed by Poma-Otis Transportation Systems, a joint venture of Poma and the Otis Elevator Company, the people mover consisted of a pair of independent cable-hauled cars on two parallel tracks. Unlike other Otis-built people movers, which float on a cushion of air, the Wellington people mover was the first by Otis to run on steel rails. Each eight-seat glass sided car could carry up to 45 passengers or resulting in a maximum capacity of 1,600 people per hour per direction. Riders entered and exited from pairs of sliding doors on the ends of the carriages, with a third door providing access to the emergency walkway between the two tracks.

The people mover was plagued by mechanical problems, which resulted in both high maintenance costs and low reliability. The frequent breakdowns and service outages frustrated riders to such an extent that 91% of users preferred replacing the people mover with a walkway, according to a 2004 survey of 240 Wellington commuters conducted by National Development, owners of the Station Landing property.

In August 2006, less than ten years after it first opened, the people mover was demolished, and an above-ground covered walkway was constructed on top of the existing viaduct structure. Off-site fabrication of parts was used to speed construction of the enclosed walkway, while a temporary shuttle-bus connected commuters to the parking structure during the construction. The replacement walkway, named SkyWalk, cost $3 million to construct, and opened in March 2007.

=== Future===
Wellington was a proposed stop on the Urban Ring Project. The Urban Ring was to be a circumferential bus rapid transit (BRT) Line designed to connect the current radial MBTA rail lines to reduce overcrowding in the downtown stations; it was canceled in 2010. Under draft plans released in 2008, Urban Ring buses would have used dedicated bus lanes paralleling Route 16, with a BRT platform in the existing station busway.

The MBTA plans to extend the south footbridge to the east parking lot and open it as a public entrance. Three elevators will be added to the footbridge, with the two existing station elevators replaced. A design contract was awarded in April 2020. Design work reached 30% completion in 2021 and did not progress further by December 2022.

<text>The Preslav Literary School (), also known as the &quot;Pliska Literary School&quot; or &quot;Pliska-Preslav Literary school&quot; was the first literary school in the medieval First Bulgarian Empire. It was established by Boris I in 886 in Bulgaria&#x27;s capital, Pliska. In 893, Simeon I moved the seat of the school from the First Bulgarian capital Pliska to the new capital, Veliki Preslav. Preslav was captured and burnt by the Byzantine Emperor John I Tzimisces in 972 in the aftermath of Sviatoslav&#x27;s invasion of Bulgaria.

==History==

The Preslav Literary School was the most important literary and cultural centre of the Bulgarian Empire and of all Slavs. A number of prominent Bulgarian writers and scholars worked at the school, including Naum of Preslav until 893; Constantine of Preslav; Joan Ekzarh (also transcr. John the Exarch); and Chernorizets Hrabar, among others. The school was also a centre of translation, mostly of Byzantine authors. Finally, it was a centre of poetry, of painting, and of painted ceramics.

The school developed the Cyrillic script:
&quot;Unlike the Churchmen in Ohrid, Preslav scholars were much more dependent upon Greek models and quickly abandoned the Glagolitic scripts in favor of an adaptation of the Greek uncial to the needs of Slavic, which is now known as the Cyrillic alphabet.&quot;
The earliest datable Cyrillic inscriptions have been found in the area of Preslav. They have been found in the medieval city itself, and at nearby Patleina Monastery, both in present-day Shumen Province, in the Ravna Monastery and in the Varna Monastery.

In Ravna, an unusually large number of inscriptions in the form of 330 instances of graffiti were found, written in Old Slavonic and in other languages. Many were written by lay people, and some are obscene. Some were written in both Cyrillic and other alphabets, prompting Umberto Eco to label Ravna &quot;a 10th-century language laboratory&quot;. Another impressive body of 10th-century Cyrillic inscriptions has been found in the form of a number of leaden pendants, the bulk of which have also been found in an area in northeastern Bulgaria between Preslav and Varna but also extending north into present-day southeastern Romania.

The Preslav School scriptoria where works were created were scattered over much of present-day northeastern Bulgaria, including churches and monasteries at Preslav, where the remains of 25 churches have been found. Other locations include Pliska, Patleina, Khan Krum, and Chernoglavtsi which are all in present-day Shumen Province; Ravna, in Varna Province; and finally Murfatlar in Dobruja, now in Romania.

== Literature ==
In the book center of the school, literature in the Old Bulgarian language was created, effectually bringing to an end the so-called trilingual heresy. In the monasteries were also made translations of the Bible, the Slavonic Josephus, the Antiquities of the Jews, and the Alexander Romance.

<doc id="1029873" wikidata="Q5009101" url="?curid=1029873" title="CBHT-DT">
<text>CBHT-DT (channel 3) is a CBC Television station in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. The station&#x27;s studios are located on Chebucto Road in Halifax, and its transmitter is located on Washmill Lake Drive (near Bently Drive) on the city&#x27;s west side.

CBHT-DT serves as CBC&#x27;s Atlantic Time Zone flagship station. The station broadcasts the network&#x27;s schedule in local time, except during live events. CBHT also became Cape Breton Island&#x27;s CBC station, when CBIT-TV was closed in 2012 as part of the CBC&#x27;s digital transition.

==History==
CBHT started broadcasting on December 20, 1954, using temporary studios at College Street School. In October 1956, CBHT moved into a brand-new facility on Bell Road. It entered CBC&#x27;s microwave network in 1958, and began colour programming in 1966. CBHT eventually covered all of Nova Scotia with rebroadcast transmitters. The tower in the Halifax area on Geizer&#x27;s Hill (called the CBC tower) is also used by CTV&#x27;s CJCH-TV, Global&#x27;s CIHF-TV, most local FM broadcast radio stations and other services. On August 31, 2011, the transition to digital terrestrial over-the-air broadcasting was complete when the station&#x27;s analog transmitter was permanently shut down, ceasing broadcasts on analog VHF channel 3, and began broadcasting on digital UHF channel 39 (virtual 3.1).

In November 2014, CBHT moved to a new facility on Chebucto Road in Halifax, located inside a former Hudson&#x27;s Bay department store, joined by CBC&#x27;s Halifax radio stations, which had previously been located in the CBC Radio Building. Originally, plans called for the new facility to completely replace the larger Bell Road studios, which were to close at the end of the 2014–15 television season. Despite this, Studio 1 at Bell Road remained in operation for some time, accommodating productions which were too complex to be produced at Chebucto Road, particularly &quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes&quot;. The Bell Road Studio building was finally demolished in November 2020 as part of the Queen Elizabeth II Health Sciences Centre redevelopment project. 

===CBIT-TV===
On September 26, 1972, CBHT began broadcast operations for a branch station in Sydney, covering all of Cape Breton Island, and parts of eastern Nova Scotia, called CBIT-TV; its call sign meant &quot;Cape Breton Island Television&quot;. It was forced to start operating the new station when CHUM Limited purchased the original local station CJCB-TV, the first television station in Nova Scotia, and switched its affiliation to the CTV Television Network on that date. CBIT broadcast on terrestrial channel 5 and local cable channel 3. CBIT had its own newscast – &quot;Cape Breton Report&quot; – until December 1990. The CBC suffered major cutbacks at the time in terms of staff and funding that eliminated local suppertime news broadcasts in small markets across the country, turning CBIT into just a news bureau feeding the regional production hub in Halifax. &quot;Cape Breton Report&quot; was cancelled and replaced with CBHT&#x27;s &quot;First Edition&quot;. Since then, CBIT was CBHT&#x27;s full-time repeater station in the Cape Breton market. As part of the CBC&#x27;s transition to digital transmission, over 600 analogue transmitters were turned off across the country on July 31, 2012. CBIT was shut down on July 31, 2012 — along with the rest of CBHT&#x27;s repeaters — resulting in CBC Television abandoning over-the-air service in those Cape Breton and mainland Nova Scotia markets.

==Studios at Bell Road==
*Studio 1 – – Constructed in 1993, this was for many years the only dedicated non-news multi-camera television production studio in Atlantic Canada. The studio was also used for non-CBC productions, such as the sketch-comedy show &quot;That&#x27;s So Weird!&quot;. The studio was fully equipped for HD production using Hitachi SK-3200 cameras, and though originally scheduled to close at the conclusion of the 2014–15 television season, it remained in operation for several additional years, hosting &quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes&quot; during the main television season, and the multi-camera dramatic anthology series &quot;Studio Black!&quot; during the summer. The studio hosted its final event, the taping of the season finale of &quot;22 Minutes&quot;, in February 2020. Production of &quot;22 Minutes&quot; moved to a new multicamera production studio created as part of the Light House Arts Centre complex in downtown Halifax.
*Studio 2 – – This smaller studio was opened in 1956, and for decades was CBHT&#x27;s only production studio, used for drama, comedy, variety, and news programming. After the opening of Studio 1, it became a dedicated studio for CBHT&#x27;s news programming. It was closed in November 2014, when the news division moved to CBC Halifax&#x27;s new studios on Chebucto Road.

==Studios at Chebucto Road==
*Studio 50 – Used for CBHT&#x27;s television news broadcasts.
*Studio 51 – Used for CBHT&#x27;s television weather reports.
*Studio 60 – – Multipurpose television and radio production studio, capable of handling multi-camera television shows or radio productions. The nationally televised competition series &quot;Short Film Face Off&quot; is taped here, as well as several other local and national programs.

==Productions==
The station has been responsible for the production of numerous regional and national programs, including the long-running &quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes&quot; (1992–present). Other national programs produced at CBHT have included &quot;Don Messer&#x27;s Jubilee&quot;, &quot;Singalong Jubilee&quot;, &quot;Countrytime&quot;, &quot;Take Time With Noel Harrison&quot;, &quot;Street Cents&quot;, and &quot;Mary Walsh: Open Book&quot;. Notable regional programs have included &quot;Switchback&quot;, and &quot;Land and Sea&quot;.

===News programming===

News programming has been a major component of the station&#x27;s efforts since its founding. CBHT airs a 60-minute Nova Scotia newscast each weekday starting at 6 p.m. In addition, it airs regional (includes Cape Breton, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland and Labrador) newscasts at 11 p.m. on weeknights and Sundays, and at 7 p.m. on Saturday evenings.

In 2000, its local newscast, &quot;First Edition&quot;, was cancelled and replaced with &quot;Canada Now&quot;, anchored in Halifax by Norma Lee MacLeod. The latest version of the newscast for Nova Scotia is called &quot;CBC Nova Scotia News&quot;, hosted by Tom Murphy, Amy Smith and Ryan Snoddon.

===Former on-air staff===
*Peter Coade
*Sharon Dunn
*Ian Hanomansing
*Linden MacIntyre

==Transmitters==
CBHT had over 30 analog television rebroadcasters in several Nova Scotian communities such as Sydney and Truro. Due to federal funding reductions to the CBC, in April 2012, the CBC responded with substantial budget cuts, which included shutting down CBC&#x27;s and Radio-Canada&#x27;s remaining analog transmitters on July 31, 2012. None of CBC or Radio-Canada&#x27;s television rebroadcasters were converted to digital.

===Post-shutdown coverage in Newfoundland and Labrador===
As a result of the closedown of the repeater network, some cable systems in Newfoundland and Labrador owned by Eastlink replaced the province&#x27;s regional CBC outlet, CBNT-DT, with CBHT, due to what Eastlink claimed were &quot;technical issues&quot; involving CBNT.

<text>The Ohrid Literary School or Ohrid-[[Devol (Albania)|&quot;Devol&quot;]] Literary school was one of the two major cultural centres of the First Bulgarian Empire, along with the Preslav Literary School (Pliska Literary School). The school was established in Ohrid (in what is now North Macedonia). Another center was Devol (modern-day Albania) as well as Drembica, Glavinica and Velika with unknown location. All the school centers were located in a then Bulgarian province known as Kutmichevitsa. It was founded in 886 by Saint Clement of Ohrid on the order of Boris I of Bulgaria simultaneously or shortly after the establishment of the Preslav Literary School. After Clement was ordained bishop of Drembica, Velika (bishopric) in 893, the position of head of the school was assumed by Naum of Preslav. The Ohrid Literary School used the Glagolitic alphabet from its establishment until the 12th century and Cyrillic from the end of the 9th century onward. Between 990 and 1015, Ohrid was the capital of the Bulgarian Empire and simultaneously also the seat of the Bulgarian Patriarchate.

<text>God&#x27;s Army is a 2000 American independent film written, directed by and features Richard Dutcher.

==Plot==
&quot;God&#x27;s Army&quot; is about LDS missionaries as they struggle with their work and, almost inevitably, their faith. The movie focuses on a pair of missionaries, Elder Allen (Brown) and Elder Dalton (Dutcher) serving as missionaries in Los Angeles, California (&quot;elder&quot; is an office in the priesthood and a title male LDS missionaries use while serving missions). Dalton is a seasoned missionary and Allen is a new recruit paired with Dalton to be trained.

Allen questions his reason for being on a mission. He is a somewhat faithful member of the church, but his father was excommunicated from the church and his mother doesn&#x27;t attend anymore.

Dalton proves to be a demanding taskmaster and he demands much of Allen—almost too much in Allen&#x27;s eyes. Allen teeters on the brink of leaving his two-year mission almost as soon as it begins. Allen witnesses another missionary lose his faith and abandon his own mission. Allen changes his mind as he finds the sacrifices others have made to be on a mission, such as ostricization from family. His own companion, Elder Dalton, dropped out of medical school to serve a mission and is fighting a losing battle with brain cancer. After a trial of his faith and some earnest soul searching, Allen finds untapped courage and embraces his work as a messenger of God.

==Main cast==
*Matthew A. Brown as Elder Allen
*Richard Dutcher as Elder Dalton
*Jacque Gray as Sister Fronk
*Desean Terry as Elder Banks
*Michael Buster as Elder Kinegar
*Luis Robledo as Elder Sandoval &quot;the Lamanite&quot;
*Jeff Kelly as Elder Mangum
*John Pentecost as President Beecroft
*Lynne Carr as Sister Beecroft

==Production==
It was financed by private investors.

==Reception==
This movie was taken on a tour of North America for special engagements. It was primarily intended for members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) audiences, but non-LDS viewers were also welcome to showings. The film was well received by its target LDS audience but was met with some confusion by non-LDS viewers.

Many professional critics were pleased at Dutcher&#x27;s willingness to address some of the more sensitive issues of the LDS Church, such as its past policy that restricted most black members from ordination to priesthood offices. They also enjoyed the look into missionaries&#x27; struggles and the work they face. Despite this, some felt the film was too apologetic. It currently has a Metacritic score of 38/100, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable&quot; reviews, and holds a score of 54% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 13 reviews.

 the film&#x27;s box office sales ranked 67th all-time among Christian films.

<text>An adept is an individual identified as having attained a specific level of knowledge, skill, or aptitude in doctrines relevant to a particular occult discipline, such as alchemy or magic. 

According to magical tradition, adepts stand out from others due to their enhanced abilities. All human qualities are developed in them, including intelligence and spirituality. According to Theosophist Charles Webster Leadbeater, anyone can become an adept through spiritual development and self-improvement, though others insist that initiation or esoteric transmission into a magical organization or tradition is a necessary preliminary.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;adept&quot; is derived from Latin &quot;adeptus&quot; &#x27;one who has attained&#x27; (the secret of transmuting metals). A. E. Waite recounts the use of the term in alchemy in his 1926 book, &quot;The Secret Tradition of Alchemy&quot;.

==Theosophy==
===H. P. Blavatsky===
Madame Blavatsky makes liberal use of the term &quot;adept&quot; in her works to refer to their additional function as caretaker of ancient occult knowledge. She also mentions their great compassionate desire to help humanity and also documents other powers of the adept such as being able to take active control of elemental spirits as well as the physical and astral conditions of non-adepts.

===Alice Bailey===
In Alice Bailey&#x27;s body of writing she outlines a hierarchy of spiritual evolution and an initiatory path along which an individual may choose to advance. In her works an Adept is defined as a being who has taken five of the seven initiations.

==Western esotericism==

Those who practice esoteric arts such as theurgy and Kabbalah are familiar with the word &#x27;adept.&#x27; In the traditions of esoteric Christianity and ceremonial magic, an adept is one who is skilled or profound, but not a master in these arts. Various magical organizations have steps in which an initiate may ascend in their own system. Some call these steps degrees or grades.

===Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn===
In the initiatory system of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, an adept is one who has taken the oath of the 5–6 grade and has been granted the title Adeptus Minor. Symbolically this degree represents a spiritual aspirant who, having mastered the union of the four elements under an upright and balanced spirit, is allowed passage from the &quot;Portal of the Vault of the Adepti&quot; into the tomb of Christian Rosenkreutz in the center of the Rosicrucian Mountain of Initiation, Abiegnus, at the center of the universe. The grade of Adeptus Minor and subsequent grades, Adeptus Major, and Adeptus Exemptus form the Second Order of the Golden Dawn, also called the Rosæ Rubeæ et Aureæ Crucis (The Ruby Rose and Golden Cross). These grades correspond to the kabbalistic sephirah of Tiphereth, Geburah, and Chesed respectively.

The oath of the Adeptus Minor includes a provision to &quot;unite myself with my higher and Divine Genius&quot;, a process which is sometimes equated with &quot;Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel.&quot; To undertake this process the Adeptus Minor must reconfirm the work of earlier grades (Zelator through Philosophus) with their newfound knowledge before passing to the Adeptus Major degree, as a full-fledged adept.

===A∴A∴===
Aleister Crowley, who formed the A∴A∴, restructured the Golden Dawn system. This system still holds to three forms of adept.

*Student
*The Order of the Golden Dawn
**Probationer 
**Neophyte
**Zelator
**Practicus
**Philosophus
*The Order of the R. C. (Rose Cross)
**Dominus Liminis 
**Adeptus Minor
**Adeptus Major
**Adeptus Exemptus
*The Order of the S. S. (Silver Star)
**Babe of the Abyss 
**Magister Templi
**Magus
**Ipsissimus

<text>Moimenta da Beira () is a municipality in the northern part of Portugal, located in the district of Viseu. The population in 2011 was 10,212, in an area of 219.97 km2.

==History==
Moimenta&#x27;s history is fairly recent: Alfonso III of Asturias conquered Lamego from the Moors, when the first settlements along the Douro began by remnants of Visigothic tribes. &quot;And there they entered into power, becoming absolute masters of everything that the force of arms would take&quot;, from the writings of the Scribe Santa Rosa Viterbo.

These bands created rural villages and homes that received in their local dialects the names Leomil, Baldos, Alvite, Toitam, Milieu, Segões, Sever and Ariz. The inhabitants of the mountains and castros, such as Pêra, Caria and São Félix, began to descend into the valleys, abandoning the rudimentary and fragile fortifications to work in the towns for the signeurial masters.

During this epoch, one of these lands (actually insignificant), whose name was implied to the localities ceremonial and funerary importance; it served as a place of homage and worship of the dead, and its name &quot;Moimenta&quot; () was in reference to its mausoleum in honour of the dead.

By the 12th century all the civil parishes that now exist were already part of the Moimenta administration, although Leomil (&quot;Couto&quot;) and Caria (&quot;Honra&quot;) had their own magistrate until 1258.

One hundred years later, in the 14th century, the lands of the municipality of Moimenta da Beira, had three ecclesiastical parishes: Santa Maria de Caria, Santa Maria de Lobozaim and São Tiago de Leomil. Sever and Alvite were part of the &quot;Couto de São João de Tarouca&quot; (a military administration) created in 1140, while Vilar was part of the &quot;Honra de Fonte Arcada&quot; (an honorific title bestowed to nobility). After the 14th century, as the management of rural territories necessitated an administrative authority, eight municipalities were established in the region, which extended into the 19th century: Paçô; Nagosa e Castelo; Sever e Alvite; Pêra e Peravelha; Ariz e Peva; and Moimenta (then known as &quot;Moimenta de São João Baptista de Leomil&quot;), were formed at the expense of Leomil. Meanwhile, the parishes of Paradinha, Cabaços e Baldos, were separated from Leomil (resulting in this municipality only retaining the parishes of Sarzedo and Paraduça). Finally, the municipality of Caria, already a municipal seat with pillory in the &quot;Vila da Rua&quot;, included the small parishes of Arcozelos, Aldeia de Nacomba, Faia, Penso, Carregal, Lamosa, Quintela da Lapa and Segões.

The administrative reform of 1834 initiated a concentration of municipal authority in fewer administrative units: the small municipalities of Peravelha, Castelo, Nagosa and Arcos were extinguished and incorporated into the municipality of Moimenta da Beira; the municipality of Caria received the parishes of Arcozelos, Aldeia de Nacomba and Segões; and Leomil grew to include the municipalities of Paçô and Sever. In 1855 the municipality of Leomil was extinct and all its assets redistributed to Moimenta da Beira, which also received the parish of Vilar from the extinguished municipality of Sernancelhe.

On 21 May 1896, Caria and Rua were transferred from Sernancelhe to Moimenta da Beira. In the short span of 21 yeast, the small municipality of Moimenta, which included only Moimenta, Paradinha, Cabaços and Baldos, in 1834, grew to 19 by 1855. It was only in 1896 when the geographic limits were finally settled.

==Geography==

<text>The Hip Hop Hoodíos (from Spanish &quot;judíos&quot; = Jews) are a multilingual Latin hip-hop and alternative band. Founded in 2001 in Brooklyn, NY, the group is now bi-coastal and based in California and New York. They are composed of Josué Noriega (born Josh Norek), Abraham Vélez, and Federico Fong (former member of La Barranca, Jaguares and Caifanes).

Their 2002 debut EP &#x27;Raza Hoodía&#x27; contains three songs based on different Latin styles as well as rock en español (&quot;Ocho Kandelikas&quot; being co-written by Juan Manuel Caipo from Orixa) and rap music; and two more rap-oriented tracks, including &quot;Dicks &amp; Noses.&quot; The video for &quot;Ocho Kandelikas&quot; received heavy airplay on MTV Tr3s. The 2005 full-length &#x27;Agua Pa&#x27; La Gente&#x27; album features guest artists Frank London (The Klezmatics) and Paul Shapiro (Brooklyn Funk Essentials). Following the &#x27;Viva La Guantanamera&#x27; EP in 2007, Hip Hop Hoodíos released the compilation &#x27;Carne Masada: Quite Possibly The Very Best of Hip Hop Hoodíos,&#x27; which also featured three previously unreleased tracks. After a ten year retirement, Hip Hop Hoodíos resurfaced in 2019 as essentially a solo act led by Josh Norek in collaboration with prominent guests including Pato Machete of Control Machete, Mexican Institute of Sound, Santi Mostaffa and Hip Spanic Allstars.

The group has collaborated with several Grammy-winning artists, including members of Ozomatli, Jaguares and The Klezmatics. In 2022, Hip Hop Hoodíos&#x27; single &quot;Knishin&#x27; In the Mission&quot; was chosen by The Forward as one of &#x27;The 150 Greatest Jewish Pop Songs of All Time.&quot; 1

Hip Hop Hoodíos&#x27; music has been featured in television shows, movies and video games. Most recently the song &quot;Times Square (1989)&quot; was included in &quot;Only Murders in the Building&quot; (season 4, episode 1) and the motocross game &quot;Riders Republic.&quot;

<text>&quot;The Rhyming Poem&quot;, also written as &quot;The Riming Poem&quot;, is a poem of 87 lines found in the Exeter Book, a tenth-century collection of Old English poetry. It is remarkable for being no later than the 10th century, in Old English, and written in rhyming couplets. Rhyme is otherwise virtually unknown among Anglo-Saxon literature, which used alliterative verse instead.

The poem is found on folios 94r-95v, in the third booklet of the Exeter Book, which may, or may not, be an indication of composition. Many scholarly attempts have been made to decipher the collation of the Exeter Book and to determine if works were placed in the manuscript by date or theme. Unlike the &quot;Monstrarum Librum&quot; of the &quot;Beowulf&quot; manuscript, the Exeter Book appears to be a self-consciously archival collection.

The poem concerns the troubles and transience of life. It contrasts the life of a ruler, from the time of his birth to his prosperous rule and life at court (lines 1-42), with his life after his fall, the subsequent rise of hostilities (lines 43-69) and his death (lines 70-79), ending with a reflection on the eternal glories of Heaven and the necessity of penance (lines 80-87). The poet may have taken the Book of Job, chapters 29 and 30, as its inspiration.

<text>Joseph Trumbull (March 11, 1737 – July 23, 1778), son of Governor Jonathan Trumbull of Connecticut, was the first commissary general of the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War.

==Biography==
Trumbull was born in Lebanon, Connecticut. He graduated from Harvard in 1756, the same year his brother, artist John Trumbull, was born, and worked in his father&#x27;s mercantile business. He served in the Connecticut House of Representatives from 1767 to 1773. He joined the Connecticut Committee of Correspondence at the outset of the American Revolution. He was elected as an alternate delegate to the First Continental Congress in 1774, but did not attend any sessions.

After Lexington and Concord in April 1775, the Connecticut Assembly appointed Trumbull as commissary general in charge of supplying food for the Connecticut troops who had joined the siege of Boston. At Boston, General George Washington was impressed with Trumbull&#x27;s efforts, and recommended him for the same job in the newly created Continental Army. On 19 July 1775, Congress appointed Trumbull as Commissary General of Stores and Provisions, with the rank of colonel.

Trumbull struggled to meet the needs of the army, and was strongly criticized by some congressmen. He got into a dispute with General Philip Schuyler, who wanted to appoint his nephew Walter Livingston as commissary for Schuyler&#x27;s Northern Department. Trumbull was charged with corruption but an official inquiry cleared him of wrongdoing in December 1775. Trumbull resigned in 1777 when Congress took away some of his duties.

Congress then appointed him to the Board of War, and he served from August 1777 until his resignation in April 1778 due to sickness. He died three months later in Lebanon and was buried in the East Cemetery.

<text>John Rich (1692–26 November 1761) was an important director and theatre manager in 18th-century London. He opened The New Theatre at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields in 1714, which he managed until he built the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden in 1732. He managed Covent Garden until 1761, putting on ever more lavish productions. He popularised pantomime on the English stage and played a dancing and mute Harlequin himself from 1717 to 1760 under the stage name of &quot;Lun.&quot; Rich&#x27;s version of the servant character, Arlecchino, moved away from the poor, dishevelled, loud, and crude character, to a colourfully-dressed, silent Harlequin, performing fanciful tricks, dances and magic. Rich&#x27;s decision to be a silent character was influenced by his unappealing voice, of which he was well aware, and the British idea of the Harlequin character was heavily inspired by Rich&#x27;s performances. 

==Biography==

Rich as theatre manager

The exact date of John Rich&#x27;s birth has not been established. He was baptised on 19 May 1692 at St Andrew, Holborn, the eldest son of the theatre manager Christopher Rich, who died on 4 November 1714, and his wife Sarah (née Bewley).

Christopher Rich left his eldest son three-quarters of his share in the Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields theatre, and its associated patent, in his will. John Rich&#x27;s younger brother, Christopher Mosyer Rich (1693-1774) received the remaining quarter. At that time, the theatre was still under re-construction, and performances did not start until 14 December 1714. The two brothers undertook the management of the theatre together at the outset but, over the years, Christopher Mosyer gradually withdrew from active involvement. 

Rich&#x27;s theatre came to specialize in what contemporaries called &quot;spectacle.&quot; Today we might call them &quot;special effects.&quot; His stagings would endeavour to present actual cannon shots, animals, and multiple illusions of battle. In particular, John Rich exaggerated the theatricality of the Restoration spectacular by creating a new form of hireling drama designed strictly to generate opulent stagecraft. Rich&#x27;s work was heavily criticised by some, with open letters being published, accusing his work of causing decay in the culture and morality of the stage. 

When Alexander Pope wrote the first version of &quot;The Dunciad&quot;, and even more in the second and third editions, Rich appears as a prime symptom of the disease of the age and debasement of taste. In his &quot;Dunciad Variorum&quot; of 1732, he makes John Rich the angel of the goddess Dulness:
Immortal Rich! how calm he sits at ease
Mid snows of paper, and fierce hail of pease;
And proud his mistress&#x27; orders to perform,
Rides in the whirlwind, and directs the storm.&quot; (III l. 257–260)
During his time as producer and director, Rich had multiple battles with his rival managers, including Colley Cibber. Pope summarizes the battle between Cibber&#x27;s Drury Lane and Rich&#x27;s Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields as,
&quot;Here shouts all Drury, there all Lincoln&#x27;s-Inn;
Contending Theatres our (Dulness&#x27;s) empire raise,
Alike their labours, and alike their praise.&quot;
1728 was the year that Rich produced John Gay&#x27;s &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera.&quot; The play ran so successfully, with 62 performances, that it was famously said the play &quot;made Gay rich and Rich gay.&quot; John Gay was a long-time friend of Pope&#x27;s and a frequent collaborator of his. 

A couple of years after the success of &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot;, Rich moved his company from Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields to a new theatre in Covent Garden. It is still a common misconception that Rich built Covent Garden Theatre with the profits from &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot;. The true facts have been readily available since at least 1906, when Henry Saxe Wyndham&#x27;s history of the theatre was published. Rich did what any entrepreneur might do - he advertised for investors, raised the money, and with it built the theatre. A complete paper-trail showing these events still exists: a copy of his &quot;Proposals&quot;, which all the prospective investors signed, is in the British Library. The subsequent share allocation for each investor is entered in the Middlesex Deeds Register at the London Metropolitan Archives, and the records of Hoare’s Bank in Fleet Street show when the money was received. These facts can now be found elsewhere, in a variety of sources, and show that the profits from &quot;The Beggar’s Opera&quot; were not involved in any way. The &quot;Survey of London&quot; even includes an Appendix giving the names of all the investors. Rich&#x27;s theatre opened in 1732 and was the first of three theatres on the site, now known as the Royal Opera House. Rich commissioned some of the great landscape artists of his day to paint scenery for the Theatre, including George Lambert.

Rich&#x27;s Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, and then Covent Garden, theatres were in competition throughout his lifetime with Cibber&#x27;s Drury Lane. Indeed, the two theatres twice put on the same play on the same night, with &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; and &quot;King Lear&quot; in 1756–57. Rich&#x27;s company also staged a number of Shakespearean plays that are rarely seen today, among them &quot;Cymbeline&quot;. In Cibber&#x27;s &quot;Apology,&quot; he blames the degradation and skyrocketing costs of play productions on Rich. The general opinion of satirists was that Cibber was thoroughly as guilty as Rich.

Though he may have been portrayed poorly by his rivals, Rich earned a reputation for being a good manager among other players, for good business practices, as well as supporting actors who had left the stage.

Around 1735, John Rich founded the Beefsteak Club along with his scenic artist, George Lambert, that met on Saturdays at a room in Covent Garden theatre.

George Frideric Handel 

In 1734, Rich began an association with George Frideric Handel, allowing performances of his operas and oratorios at his new Covent Garden theatre.
However, the operas were now out of fashion, and had lost their popularity. Performances were discontinued after a couple of years. On the other hand, the oratorio performances proved to be extremely successful. They were performed on those days in Lent when theatrical performances were forbidden by the Lord Chamberlain, and conveniently filled a niche in the theatrical calendar. The performances became an annual event, and continued long after the deaths of both Handel and Rich.

Rich as performer

Rich began his work as &quot;Lun&quot; the Harlequin character in 1717, wearing a leotard with diamond-shaped patches and a mask, encouraging the silence that became normal for the pantomime character. By 1728, Rich was synonymous with lavish (and successful) productions. He performed multiple roles as the &quot;Harlequin&quot; character while the Manager at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields, including &quot;Harlequin Doctor Faustus.&quot; He was praised for his movement style, allowing each limb to tell a story, such as in &quot;Harlequin Sorcerer&quot; where he portrayed the harlequin being hatched from an egg. According to Soame Jenyns in &quot;The Art of Dancing&quot;, Rich was a fine dancer, noted for his elevation:
That Pindar &quot;Rich&quot; despises Vulgar Roads,
And soars an Eagle’s height among the Clouds,
Whilst humbler Dancers, fearful how they climb,
But buzz below amidst the flow’ry Thyme:
Now soft and slow he bends the circling Round,
Now rises high upon the spritely Bound,
Now springs aloft, too swift for Mortal sight,
Now falls unhurt from some stupendous Height;
Like &quot;Proteus&quot;, in a thousand Forms is seen,
Sometimes a &quot;God&quot;, sometimes an &quot;Harlequin&quot;.
After Rich&#x27;s death on 26 November 1761, pantomime was criticised for losing the artistry he exhibited with his performances, relying instead more on spectacle and choral numbers. It wasn&#x27;t until after his death, that many of his rivals, David Garrick included, would recognize his work. Garrick even said his pantomime performances were unmatched in his time.


Private life

John Rich married Henrietta Brerewood on 7 February 1717 at St Clement Danes; they had a son who died in infancy. Henrietta died in September 1725, and Rich then formed a relationship with one of the actresses in his company, Amy Smithies. Her name is quoted in the dispute over the delay in finalising probate on Rich&#x27;s will in 1779. They had four daughters who survived into adulthood: Henrietta (1727), Charlotte (c.1727?), Mary (1730) and Sarah (1733). Rich considered them to be his legitimate children, although no marriage has yet been found. Amy died in November 1737, and was buried as &#x27;Amie, wife of Mr J Rich&#x27; on 1st December in the family tomb in Hillingdon. During this period Rich also had two children with another of his actresses, Ann Benson - Charles Rich was born in 1729, but nothing further is known about him; and he was followed by Catherine Benson c. 1730. Rich acknowledged Catherine as his &#x27;natural daughter&#x27; in his will, and left her a bequest. Finally, in 1744, Rich married Priscilla Wilford, who used the stage name, Mrs Stevens. She survived him, and Rich&#x27;s estate was eventually distributed equally between her and the four daughters.

Rich&#x27;s niece, by Priscilla Wilford, was Mary Bulkley, who trained and performed at Covent Garden Theatre during his lifetime.

<text>The Egyptian plover (Pluvianus aegyptius), also known as the crocodile bird, is a wader, the only member of the genus Pluvianus. It occurs in a band across Sub-Saharan Africa from Senegal in the west to Ethiopia in the east and south to parts of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It no longer occurs in Egypt. The species was formerly placed with the pratincoles and coursers in the family, Glareolidae, but is now regarded as the sole member of its own monotypic family Pluvianidae.

The species is one of several plovers doubtfully associated with the &quot;trochilus&quot; bird mentioned by the Greek historian Herodotus in a supposed cleaning symbiosis with the Nile crocodile.

==Taxonomy==
The Egyptian plover was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it in the genus &quot;Charadrius&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Charadrius aegyptius&quot;. Linnaeus based his account on the description by the Swedish naturalist Fredrik Hasselqvist that had been published in 1757. The Egyptian plover is now the only species placed in the genus &quot;Pluvianus&quot; that was introduced in 1816 by the French ornithologist Louis Vieillot. The species was formerly placed with the pratincoles and coursers in the family Glareolidae but beginning in 2007 molecular phylogenetic studies showed that it is not closely related to these species. It was therefore moved to its own family Pluvianidae that had been proposed (as Pluvianinae) in 1848 by the German naturalist Ludwig Reichenbach. The genus name &quot;Pluvianus&quot; is from the French &quot;pluvier&quot; meaning plover. This was based on the assumed close relationship with the plovers in the family Charadriidae. Edme-Louis Daubenton used the French name, &quot;Pluvian du Sénégal&quot;&#x27; for the species in his &quot;Planches Enluminées D&#x27;Histoire Naturelle&quot; that was published between 1765 and 1783. The species is considered to be monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

==Description==
The Egyptian plover is a striking and unmistakable species. The long adult has a black crown, back, eye-mask and breast band. The rest of the head is white. The remaining upperpart plumage is blue-grey, and the underparts are buff. The longish legs are blue-grey. The sexes are similar but juveniles are duller and the black marking are intermixed with brown. There is no seasonal variation.

In flight the black crown and back contrast with the grey of the upperparts and wings. The flight feathers are brilliant white crossed by a black bar. From below, the flying bird is entirely white, apart from the buff belly and black wing bar. The end of the tail has a white band. After landing, members of a pair greet each other by raising their wings in an elaborate ceremony that shows off the black and white markings.

The most frequent vocalisation is a high-pitched &quot;krrr-krrr-krrr&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==
The Egyptian plover is a localised resident in tropical Sub-Saharan Africa from Senegal in the west to Ethiopia in the east and south to parts of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It breeds on sandbars in large rivers and avoids forested areas. Despite its vernacular and scientific names, it is not present in modern-day Egypt.

==Behaviour and ecology==
This is relatively tame bird that is found in pairs or small groups near water.

===Breeding===
Breeding takes place between early January and the end of March. The nest is a scrape in loose sand on a riverine island. The clutch is usually 3 to 4 eggs which are light yellow-brown with red-brown to grey spots and measure around . The eggs are incubated by both sexes and hatch after 28–31 days. The parent covers the eggs with sand when it leaves the nest. During the hot period of the day the parents wet the feathers of their underparts and then use this water to soak the eggs and the associated covering layer of sand. The chicks are precocial and nidifugous. They are cared for by both parents and can feed themselves independently when around 1 week of age. The fledging period is around 35 days.

===Food and feeding===
The Egyptian plover mainly eats invertebrates such as worms, molluscs, aquatic insects and small flies. It picks food from the surface as well as probing with its bill in damp sand. Insects are sometimes caught in the air.

==Supposed relationship with crocodiles==

The bird is sometimes referred to as the &quot;crocodile bird&quot; based on the belief that the species had a symbiotic relationship with crocodiles. According to Herodotus, the crocodiles lie on the shore with their mouths open and a bird called &quot;Trochilus&quot; flies into the crocodiles&#x27; mouths so as to feed on decaying meat lodged between the crocodiles&#x27; teeth. The identification of the Trochilus with any particular plover is doubtful and the cleaning symbiosis itself has never been documented by video or photographic evidence.

<text>2001 Einstein (&quot;prov. designation&quot;: ) is a bright Hungaria asteroid from the innermost region of the asteroid belt. It was discovered by Swiss astronomer Paul Wild at Zimmerwald Observatory near Bern, Switzerland, on 5 March 1973. The X-type asteroid (Xe) has a rotation period of 5.5 hours and measures approximately in diameter. It is named after physicist Albert Einstein (1879–1955).

== Orbit and classification ==

&quot;Einstein&quot; is a member of the Hungaria family, which form the innermost dense concentration of asteroids in the Solar System. It orbits the Sun in the inner main-belt at a distance of 1.7–2.1 AU once every 2 years and 8 months (982 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.10 and an inclination of 23° with respect to the ecliptic. As no precoveries were taken, the asteroid&#x27;s observation arc begins with its discovery in 1973.

== Naming ==

This minor planet was named in honour of the German-born, Swiss–American physicist and Nobelist Albert Einstein (1879–1955). It is considered suitable, that the body discovered at Bern is named after the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics laureate, since it was the place where he had his golden years while working as a clerk at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern. He is also honored by the lunar crater &quot;Einstein&quot;. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 15 October 1977 (). Arthur C. Clarke joked in the postscript of his novel &quot;3001: The Final Odyssey&quot; that he was hoping asteroid 2001 would be named after him, but it was named for Einstein first. Asteroid 3001 was named 3001 Michelangelo. Clarke was later honoured with asteroid 4923 Clarke, named together with 5020 Asimov.

== Physical characteristics ==

The Tholen classification, &quot;Einstein&quot; is an X-type asteroid, while in the SMASS classification, it is an Xe-subtype which transitions from the X-type to the very bright E-type asteroid.

=== Rotation period ===

Several rotational lightcurves for this asteroid were obtained from photometric observations. In December 2004, the first lightcurve by American astronomer Brian Warner at his Palmer Divide Observatory (PDS) in Colorado, gave a rotation period of hours with a brightness variation of in magnitude (). Between 2008 and 2012, three additional lightcurves at the PDS gave an almost identical period of 5.485 hours with an amplitude of 0.67, 0.74 and 1.02, respectively (). Other lightcurves were obtained by Hanuš at the French CNES and other institutions, which gave a period of hours (), and by Italian astronomer Federico Manzini at SAS observatory in Novara, Jean Strajnic and Raoul Behrend from December 2012, which rendered a period of hours with an amplitude of 0.66 in magnitude ().

=== Diameter and albedo ===

According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA&#x27;s space-based Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), the asteroid measures 4.0 km in diameter and its surface has an exceptionally high albedo of 0.81, for which WISE assigns an E-type. The &quot;Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link&quot; assumes a lower, yet still high albedo of 0.40 and hence calculates a larger diameter of 5.7 kilometers, as the lower the albedo, the larger the body&#x27;s diameter for a constant absolute magnitude.

<doc id="1029949" wikidata="Q7245280" url="?curid=1029949" title="Printed circuit board milling">
<text>Printed circuit board milling (also: isolation milling) is the milling process used for removing areas of copper from a sheet of printed circuit board (PCB) material to recreate the pads, signal traces and structures according to patterns from a digital circuit board plan known as a &quot;layout file&quot;. Similar to the more common and well known chemical PCB etch process, the PCB milling process is subtractive: material is removed to create the electrical isolation and ground planes required. However, unlike the chemical etch process, PCB milling is typically a non-chemical process and as such it can be completed in a typical office or lab environment without exposure to hazardous chemicals. High quality circuit boards can be produced using either process. In the case of PCB milling, the quality of a circuit board is chiefly determined by the system&#x27;s true, or weighted, milling accuracy and control as well as the condition (sharpness, temper) of the milling bits and their respective feed/rotational speeds. By contrast, in the chemical etch process, the quality of a circuit board depends on the accuracy and/or quality of the mask used to protect the copper from the chemicals and the state of the etching chemicals.

== Advantages ==
PCB milling has advantages for both prototyping and some special PCB designs. The biggest benefit is that one does not have to use chemicals to produce PCBs.

When creating a prototype, outsourcing a board takes time. An alternative is to make a PCB in-house. Using the wet process, in-house production presents problems with chemicals and disposing thereof. High-resolution boards using the wet process are hard to achieve and still, when done, one still has to drill and eventually cut out the PCB from the base material.

CNC machine prototyping can provide a fast-turnaround board production process without the need for wet processing. If a CNC machine is already used for drilling, this single machine could carry out both parts of the process, drilling and milling. A CNC machine is used to process drilling, milling and cutting.

Many boards that are simple for milling would be very difficult to process by wet etching and manual drilling afterward in a laboratory environment without using top-of-the-line systems that usually cost many times more than CNC milling machines.

In mass production, milling is unlikely to replace etching although the use of CNC is already standard practice for drilling the boards.

==Hardware==

A PCB milling system is a single machine that can perform all of the required actions to create a prototype board, with the exception of inserting &quot;vias&quot; and &quot;through hole plating&quot;. Most of these machines require only a standard AC mains outlet and a shop-type vacuum cleaner for operation.

== Software ==
Software for milling PCBs is usually delivered by the CNC machine manufacturer. Most of the packages can be split in two main categories – raster and vector.

Software that produces tool paths using raster calculation method tends to have lower resolution of processing than the vector based software since it relies on the raster information it receives.

==Mechanical system==
The mechanics behind a PCB milling machine are fairly straightforward and have their roots in CNC milling technology. A PCB milling system is similar to a miniature and highly accurate NC milling table. For machine control, positioning information and machine control commands are sent from the controlling software via a serial port or parallel port connection to the milling machine&#x27;s on-board controller. The controller is then responsible for driving and monitoring the various positioning components which move the milling head and gantry and control the spindle speed. Spindle speeds can range from 30,000 RPM to 100,000 RPM depending on the milling system, with higher spindle speeds equating to better accuracy, in a nutshell the smaller the tool diameter the higher RPM you need. Typically this drive system comprises non-monitored stepper motors for the X/Y axis, an on-off non-monitored solenoid, pneumatic piston or lead screw for the Z-axis, and a DC motor control circuit for spindle speed, none of which provide positional feedback. More advanced systems provide a monitored stepper motor Z-axis drive for greater control during milling and drilling as well as more advanced RF spindle motor control circuits that provide better control over a wider range of speeds.

===X and Y-axis control===
For the X and Y-axis drive systems most PCB milling machines use stepper motors that drive a precision lead screw. The lead screw is in turn linked to the gantry or milling head by a special precision machined connection assembly. To maintain correct alignment during milling, the gantry or milling head&#x27;s direction of travel is guided along using linear or dovetailed bearing(s). Most X/Y drive systems provide user control, via software, of the milling speed, which determines how fast the stepper motors drive their respective axes.

===Z-axis control===
Z-axis drive and control are handled in several ways. The first and most common is a simple solenoid that pushes against a spring. When the solenoid is energized it pushes the milling head down against a spring stop that limits the downward travel. The rate of descent as well as the amount of force exerted on the spring stop must be manually set by mechanically adjusting the position of the solenoid&#x27;s plunger.

The second type of Z-axis control is through the use of a pneumatic cylinder and a software-driven gate valve. Due to the small cylinder size and the amount of air pressure used to drive it there is little range of control between the up and down stops. Both the solenoid and pneumatic system cannot position the head anywhere other than the endpoints, and are therefore useful for only simple &#x27;up/down&#x27; milling tasks. The final type of Z-axis control uses a stepper motor that allows the milling head to be moved in small accurate steps up or down. Further, the speed of these steps can be adjusted to allow tool bits to be eased into the board material rather than hammered into it. The depth (number of steps required) as well as the downward/upward speed is under user control via the controlling software.

One of the major challenges with milling PCBs is handling variations in flatness. Since conventional etching techniques rely on optical masks that sit right on the copper layer they can conform to any slight bends in the material so all features are replicated faithfully.

When milling PCBs however, any minute height variations encountered when milling will cause conical bits to either sink deeper (creating a wider cut) or rise off the surface, leaving an uncut section. Before cutting some systems perform height mapping probes across the board to measure height variations and adjust the Z values in the G-code beforehand.

===Tooling===
PCBs may be machined with conventional endmills, conical d-bit cutters, and spade mills. D-bits and spade mills are cheap and as they have a small point allow the traces to be close together. Taylor&#x27;s equation, Vc Tn = C, can predict tool life for a given surface speed.

<doc id="1029953" wikidata="Q27971" url="?curid=1029953" title="Tunisia national football team">
<text>The Tunisia national football team, controlled by the Tunisian Football Federation (TFF), represents Tunisia in men&#x27;s international association football competitions. On a continental level, the team competes under the Confederation of African Football (CAF). It is also affiliated with FIFA for global competitions. Additionally, the team is a member of the Union of North African Football (UNAF) and the Union of Arab Football Associations (UAFA). The team is colloquially known as &quot;Eagles of Carthage&quot; by fans and the media, with the bald eagle serving as its symbol. Their home kit is primarily white and their away kit is red, which is a reference to the national flag of the country. The team has qualified six times for the FIFA World Cup and twenty-one times for the Africa Cup of Nations. It has competed in four editions of Summer Olympics and participated once in the FIFA Confederation Cup. Since 2001, Tunisia&#x27;s home stadium is the Hammadi Agrebi Stadium in Radès, Tunis.

Tunisia&#x27;s first match after independence was against Libya, which they won 4–2. Periods of regular Tunisian representation at the highest international level, from 1962 to 1978, from 1994 to 2008 and again from 2014 onwards. The team qualified for the FIFA World Cup for the first time in 1978, and became the first African and Arab team to win a world cup match by beating Mexico 3–1 in the first match, they have since qualified six times and never making it past the group stage. The team qualified for the Africa Cup of Nations 22 times, the first time was in 1962 and won the title in 2004 when they hosted the event after beating Morocco in the final. Tunisia qualified for the FIFA Confederations Cup in 2005 and was eliminated in the group stage. The team won the African Nations Championship in 2011 by beating Angola in the final and the FIFA Arab Cup in 1963, eventually winning with 8 points on their first participation.

Radhi Jaïdi, with 105 international matches, holds the record for the number of matches played on the Tunisian national team while Issam Jemâa, with 36 goals, is their all-time highest scorer. The highest rank reached by the team in the FIFA Men&#x27;s World Ranking is 14th in April and May 2018, while their lowest rank is 65th in July 2010. Tunisia holds the record for most African Cup of Nations attended, appearing at seventeen consecutive tournaments. They have not been absent from the competition since the 1994 edition.

==History==
=== 1928–56: French protectorate of Tunisia and beginning ===

Before independence, an unofficial team was formed in 1928, comprising the best Tunisian players from the Tunisian League. The team&#x27;s first match was on 11 March 1928, against the France national football B team; Tunisia lost 8–2. Their next friendlies, against the same team on 23 March 1930 and 26 March 1933, also resulted in heavy defeats: 0–5 and 1–6 respectively. Tunisia had to wait until 1932 for their first match win: a 1–0 victory over French Algeria. Most of the matches that Tunisia played in the 30s and 40s were against French teams, whether it was French Algeria, the French military team or the France B team, in addition to a match against the France national team in 1941. Most of these matches were played at the Stade Vélodrome in Tunis.

=== 1956–62: Post independence, First international participation ===

Tunisia gained independence from France on 20 March 1956. The Tunisian Football Federation was founded on 29 March 1957 and the Tunisian team played a match with Austrian club FC Admira Wacker Mödling on 30 December of the same year, winning 4–1. Tunisia became affiliated with FIFA and the Confederation of African Football in 1960. The independent Tunisia played their first match against Algeria on 1 June 1957, in the midst of the Algerian War, in which Tunisia lost 2–1. They played their first official match at the 1957 Arab Games where they won against Libya 4–3 after scoring the first Tunisian goal in an official competition by Farzit. They won against Iraq 4–2 and Lebanon 4–2 before losing in the final against Syria 3–1. In 1960, Yugoslavian Milan Kristić became the first foreign manager. The national team qualified for the 1960 Summer Olympics, their first international event after beating Malta, Morocco and Sudan. In the Olympic Games, the team suffered three defeats: against Poland 6–1, Argentina 2–1, and Denmark 3–1. Frane Matošić was appointed as the second Yugoslav coach of Tunisia after Kristić led Tunisia to qualify for the Olympics.

=== 1962–78: Golden generation, First World Cup participation ===
In 1962, Tunisia entered the African Cup of Nations qualifiers for the first time. The team qualified for the tournament after beating Morocco and Nigeria, and went on to finish third after beating Uganda in the third-place match. The team won the 1963 Arab Cup, after winning against Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, and Kuwait. Tunisia also qualified for the 1963 Africa Cup of Nations, and CAF decided that Tunisia would host the 1965 AFCON, making the final after beating Ethiopia 4–0 in the opening match in Stade Chedly Zouiten, losing 3–2 to Ghana in extra-time of the final. Despite this early success, Tunisia did not enter the Cup of Nations again until 1976, and did not qualify until 1978. In 1973, the team entered the Palestine Cup of Nations and won in dominant fashion, winning all six of their matches overcoming Syria, Egypt, Palestine, Yemen and Iraq, scoring 19 goals. In February 1975, after a short stint with Hungarian manager André Nagy, Abdelmajid Chetali was hired. Tunisia qualified for their FIFA World Cup debut in 1978. Tunisia defeated Mexico 3–1, but were defeated by Poland 1–0, and drew scoreless against defending champion West Germany.

=== 1978–94: Decline and Missing six editions of the AFCON ===
After their inaugural World Cup, Tunisia experienced a decline. Between 1980 and 1992, the team managed to qualify for only two tournaments: the 1982 African Cup of Nations, and the 1988 Summer Olympics. In both, they were knocked out in the first round. They, however, reached the last round of the 1986 World Cup qualifiers by beating Nigeria before being defeated by Algeria. Former Cameroon manager Jean Vincent was hired but the team was unable to qualify for the 1988 African Cup in Morocco after a defeat against Algeria.

The team experienced poor results in the African Games with defeats against Cameroon, Madagascar and Kenya. Taoufik Ben Othman, assistant manager in 1978, improved Tunisia&#x27;s results, as they qualified for the Olympic Games after surpassing Morocco and Egypt in the qualifiers. However, he was removed days before the start of the competition after poor results in the 1988 Arab Cup and failure to win in their matches against Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Egypt and Iraq, as well as friendlies against Malta, Finland and East Germany. Polish manager Antoni Piechniczek was temporarily appointed and supervised the team in the first round of 1990 World Cup qualifiers and also in the finals of the Olympic Games; in the latter, Tunisia tied China 0–0 and Sweden 2–2 and lost to West Germany 4–1. Mokhtar Tlili was appointed manager, however, he still missed the African Cup in 1990 after a defeat to Senegal. Piechniczek returned but still failed to qualify for the 1990 World Cup. Despite missing the 1992 African Cup, the federation renewed confidence in him because of the respectable performance he had given in the qualifiers; an early exit from the World Cup qualifiers for 1994 contributed to his dismissal after a draw with Morocco. Youssef Zouaoui replaced him; Tunisia hosted the 1994 African Cup of Nations replacing original hosts Zaire, but finished at the bottom of the group, after a 2–0 loss to Mali and a draw with Zaire.

=== 1994–2002: Beginning of Resurgence, 1996 AFCON runners-up ===
Henryk Kasperczak became the new manager after Tunisia hosted the 1994 African Cup of Nations. Tunisia qualified for the 1996 AFCON and finished second in their group, putting them through to the quarter-finals. Tunisia went on to beat Gabon in the quarter-finals and Zambia in the semi-finals, to reach their first major final in 31 years, but lost to host country South Africa 2–0. Tunisia reached the quarter-finals of the 1998 African Cup of Nations in the lead of the group with a win over DR Congo, Togo and a defeat from Ghana, where they were eliminated in a penalty shootout by host country Burkina Faso. The team also qualified for that year&#x27;s World Cup after a 20-year absence: they again failed to advance from the group stages, losing 2–0 to England and 1–0 to Colombia, and drawing 1–1 with Romania. Kasperczak was sacked and replaced with Francesco Scoglio, who guided the team to the 2000 African Cup of Nations, where they finished in fourth place after losing to Cameroon in the semi-finals. The following year, Scoglio departed to rejoin Genoa CFC, sparking a period of severe instability. Eckhard Krautzun initially took over and guided the team to a second World Cup appearance, but then resigned, citing interference from the Tunisian FA with his coaching. Henri Michel replaced him, but was sacked when Tunisia crashed out of the 2002 African Cup of Nations without scoring a single goal after scoreless draws with Senegal and Zambia and a defeat from Egypt. Finally, Ammar Souayah took over in time for the 2002 World Cup; the team drew in friendlies with Norway and South Korea and were defeated by Denmark and Slovenia. In the finals, Tunisia exited the tournament in the group stage, drawing 1–1 with Belgium, losing 2–0 to Russia and co-hosts Japan, prompting a search for a new manager.

=== 2002–08: Roger Lemerre era, 2004 AFCON champions ===

In September 2002, the Tunisian Football Federation announced that it was finalizing a contract with former France manager Roger Lemerre. Tunisia hosted the 2004 African Cup of Nations, winning the group. They defeated Senegal in the quarter-finals, and Nigeria in the semi-finals. Tunisia built a 1–0 lead after four minutes with Mehdi Nafti&#x27;s concentration pushed by Francileudo Santos, before Morocco levelled. Tunisia restored their lead, giving them their first African Cup of Nations title. They also won the CAF&#x27;s African National Team of the Year award. Lemerre became the first manager to win two different continental tournaments, having previously won Euro 2000 with France. As a result, Tunisia qualified for the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup in Germany, playing the hosts, Argentina and Australia. The only points they would win was a victory over Australia. Before their 2006 World Cup appearance, Lemerre took the Tunisians to a training camp in Switzerland, where they played international friendlies against Swiss clubs. Tunisia would only record one draw in Germany, against Saudi Arabia, losing against Spain and Ukraine. Hatem Trabelsi announced his retirement from international football after eight years, and Lemerre led Tunisia to the 2008 African Cup of Nations. Tunisia won their 2008 AFCON group after a draw in the opening match against Senegal 2–2, a 3–1 victory over South Africa, and a goalless draw against Angola. They then lost against Cameroon 3–2 in extra time.

=== 2008–14: Disappointments and missing the World Cup ===
Portuguese Humberto Coelho was appointed as the new manager on 3 June 2008. Coelho would fail to qualify for the 2010 World Cup. Faouzi Benzarti was appointed as the new manager, and was also sacked after Tunisia were eliminated from the group stage in the 2010 Africa Cup of Nations. In June 2010, Bertrand Marchand was appointed manager for a two-year contract. After a series of horrendous results, Tunisia fell to 65th in the FIFA World Rankings, the worst in its history. Sami Trabelsi was appointed, and the team qualified for the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations, where they were eliminated in the quarter-finals after a defeat by Ghana.

In the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations, Tunisia snatched a late winner against Algeria, before a defeat by Ivory Coast, 3–0. The last match ended with a 1–1 draw against Togo. In February 2013, Nabil Maâloul replaced Sami Trabelsi; in their first two 2014 World Cup qualification matches, Tunisia beat Sierra Leone 2–1 and clinched a 2–2 draw in Freetown. On 16 June, during the fifth round of the group stage, Tunisia tied 1–1 against Equatorial Guinea. A 2–0 loss to Cape Verde on 7 September all but eliminated Tunisia; however, Tunisia advanced after FIFA disqualified Cape Verde for cheating. They would then be knocked out by Cameroon.

=== 2014–22: Renaissance and two World Cup participations ===

Belgian manager Georges Leekens was appointed in early 2014; early results included a 1–1 draw against Colombia and a 1–0 win over South Korea, both in friendly matches. Under Leekens, the team climbed from 49th to 22nd in the FIFA rankings. Tunisia qualified for the 2015 African Cup of Nations, and topped their group for the first time since 2008, winning against Zambia and drawing with Cape Verde and DR Congo. They were eliminated in the quarter-finals after a defeat to host Equatorial Guinea. In July 2015, Henryk Kasperczak returned as manager after 17 years. He managed to qualify the team for the 2017 African Cup, and reached the quarter-finals of the competition after beating Algeria and Zimbabwe, before losing again in this round, this time against Burkina Faso.

On 27 April 2017, Nabil Maâloul returned as manager despite the disapproval of the Tunisian supporters following the failure at the 2014 World Cup qualifiers, but this time he qualified Tunisia for the 2018 World Cup in Russia. Tunisia&#x27;s qualification for the World Cup and its results in friendlies against Iran and Costa Rica, led to its rise to 14th place in the FIFA World Rankings, their best ever. Before the World Cup, Tunisia drew with Turkey and Portugal, in addition to a narrow defeat against Spain 1–0. Despite this, in the World Cup, Tunisia were once again eliminated from the group stage. In the first match, England won 2–1. Belgium defeated the North Africans 5–2, and in Tunisia&#x27;s last game against Panama, the Arab nation won 2–1. Tunisia qualified for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations with new manager Alain Giresse; the new manager would only record three ties, against Angola, Mali, and Mauritania to qualify for the round 16. They eventually would win against Ghana, and Madagascar 3–0 in the quarter-finals, to qualify for the semi-finals for the first time in 15 years, losing to Senegal 1–0 in extra time. In September 2021, the national team began its 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign with three consecutive victories against Equatorial Guinea, Zambia, and Mauritania; they would then draw Mauritania 0–0 and lose against Equatorial Guinea 1–0, to advance for the third round on the top of the group.

Qatar hosted the 2021 FIFA Arab Cup; Tunisia started with a 5–1 win against Mauritania. They then suffered an unexpected defeat to Syria, before winning against the United Arab Emirates. In the quarter-finals Tunisia won against Oman 2–1, and scored a 95th minute winner against Egypt in the semi-finals. Tunisia faced Algeria in the final, losing 2–0. The 2021 Africa Cup of Nations was postponed to early 2022; in the group stage, Tunisia began with a 1–0 defeat against Mali, with Zambian referee Janny Sikazwe ending the match in the 85th minute. In the second match, the team achieved a 4–0 victory over Mauritania, and lost against Gambia in the last group match. Tunisia defeated Nigeria in the round of 16, and were eliminated by Burkina Faso. In March, Tunisia qualified for their sixth World Cup, the 2022 tournament in Qatar, the first hosted by an Arab nation, after beating Mali 1–0 on aggregate, taking revenge for the earlier loss in the AFCON. They then defeated Chile and Japan to win the 2022 Kirin Cup Soccer title for the first time, and Ferjani Sassi was named the best player of the tournament while his compatriot Issam Jebali finished as the top scorer with two goals. Tunisia played two pre-World Cup friendlies in France in September 2022, defeating Comoros 1−0 in Croissy-sur-Seine and losing 5−1 to Brazil at the Parc des Princes in Paris. With the exception of Brazil, Tunisia&#x27;s relatively good forms increased confidence on the side to break the knockout stage taboo as Tunisia found themselves grouped with world champions France, European dark horse Denmark and Asian minnows Australia. In Group D, Tunisia drew Euro 2020 semi-finalists Denmark 0−0 in a rather decent display by the African side. But a 0−1 loss against Australia followed, severely hampering Tunisia&#x27;s odds to progress. A 1−0 victory over France courtesy of a goal from Wahbi Khazri was not enough to seal Tunisia&#x27;s place in the last 16 as Australia&#x27;s Mathew Leckie goal against Denmark meant the Asian representative placed second.

==Home stadium==
From 1956 to 2001, the national stadium was Chedly Zouiten Stadium, with a capacity of 18,000. It hosted the Africa Cup of Nations in 1965 and 1994 and the 1977 FIFA World Youth Championship before it was replaced after the construction of El Menzah Stadium in 1967 for the 1967 Mediterranean Games. Tunisia&#x27;s first match at the stadium was played on 8 September 1967 against Libya. It hosted the 1977 FIFA World Youth Championship and was completely renovated for the 1994 African Cup of Nations. It also hosted the 2004 edition.

In 2001, Hammadi Agrebi Stadium was inaugurated as Tunisia&#x27;s national stadium ahead of the 2001 Mediterranean Games. Located in Radès, Tunis. The stadium has an all-seater capacity of 60,000. The first match at the stadium was played on 7 July 2001 between Étoile du Sahel and CS Hammam-Lif for the Tunisian Cup final. Tunisia have used the stadium for almost every major home game, including the 2004 African Cup of Nations final. The Tunisians often host their matches at the Mustapha Ben Jannet Stadium in Monastir which has a capacity of 20,000. In addition, there are many other venues that host games, such as the Sousse Olympic Stadium, which hosted a friendly match between Tunisia and Switzerland in November 2012 and also hosted a match in the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations qualification.

==Rivalries==
Tunisia&#x27;s main football rivals are its neighbours Algeria, Morocco, and Egypt, with which it shares close cultural and political relations. Tunisia have played 45 games against Algeria. After the independence of Algeria, a friendly match took place at the Stade Chedly Zouiten. The teams also met three times in the qualifying phase of the World Cup in 1970, 1978 and 1986.

<doc id="1029958" wikidata="Q2527958" url="?curid=1029958" title="Humphrey de Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford">
<text>Humphrey (VII) de Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford ( 1276 – 16 March 1322) was a member of a powerful Anglo-Norman family of the Welsh Marches and was one of the Ordainers who opposed Edward II&#x27;s excesses.

==Family background ==
Humphrey de Bohun&#x27;s birth year is uncertain although several contemporary sources indicate that it was 1276. His father was Humphrey de Bohun, 3rd Earl of Hereford and his mother was Maud de Fiennes, daughter of Enguerrand II de Fiennes, chevalier, seigneur of Fiennes. He was born at Pleshey Castle, Essex.

Humphrey (VII) de Bohun succeeded his father in 1298 as Earl of Hereford and Earl of Essex, and Constable of England (later called Lord High Constable). Humphrey held the title of Bearer of the Swan Badge, a heraldic device passed down in the Bohun family. This device did not appear on their coat of arms, (az, a bend ar cotised or, between 6 lioncels or) nor their crest (gu, doubled erm, a lion gardant crowned), but it does appear on Humphrey&#x27;s personal seal (&quot;illustration&quot;).

== Scotland ==
Humphrey was one of several earls and barons under Edward I who laid siege to Caerlaverock Castle in Scotland in 1300 and later took part in many campaigns in Scotland. He also loved tourneying and gained a reputation as an &quot;elegant&quot; fop. 

In one of the campaigns in Scotland Humphrey evidently grew bored and departed for England to take part in a tournament along with Piers Gaveston and other young barons and knights. On return, all of them fell under Edward I&#x27;s wrath for desertion, but were forgiven. It is probable that Gaveston&#x27;s friend, the future Edward II, had given them permission to depart. Later Humphrey became one of Gaveston&#x27;s and Edward II&#x27;s bitterest opponents.

He would also have been associating with young Robert Bruce during the early campaigns in Scotland, since Bruce, like many other Scots and Border men, he eventually submitted to English allegiance. Robert Bruce is closely connected to the Bohuns. Between the time that he swore his last fealty to Edward I in 1302 and his defection four years later, Bruce stayed for the most part in Annandale, rebuilding his castle of Lochmaben in stone, making use of its natural moat. 

Rebelling and taking the crown of Scotland in February 1306, Bruce was fighting a war against England which went poorly for him at first, and he was forced into hiding. By 1307, the war had begun to turn in his favour. His properties in England and Scotland were confiscated and three of his brothers were executed.

Humphrey de Bohun received many of Robert Bruce&#x27;s forfeited properties. It is unknown whether Humphrey was a long-time friend or enemy of Robert Bruce, but they were nearly the same age and the lands of the two families in Essex and Middlesex lay very close to each other. After Bruce&#x27;s defeats, Humphrey took Lochmaben, and Edward I awarded him Annandale and the castle. 

Lochmaben was retaken by the Scots in 1312 and remained in Scottish hands until 1333 when it was once more seized by the English. It remained in the hands of Humphrey&#x27;s son William, Earl of Northampton, who held and defended it until his death in 1360. 

The Scots retook Lochmaben again in 1385. Some Bohuns remained in Scotland, where they became known as the Bounds.

== Battle of Bannockburn ==
At the Battle of Bannockburn (23–24 June 1314), Humphrey de Bohun should have been given command of the army because that was his responsibility as Constable of England. However, since the execution of Piers Gaveston in 1312, Humphrey had been out of favour with Edward II, who gave the Constableship for the 1314 campaign to the youthful and inexperienced Earl of Gloucester, Gilbert de Clare. 

Nevertheless, on the first day, Bohun insisted on being one of the first to lead the cavalry charge. In the melee and cavalry rout between the Bannock Burn and the Scots&#x27; camp, he was not injured although his rash young cousin Henry de Bohun, who could have been no older than about 22, charged alone at Robert Bruce and was killed by Bruce&#x27;s axe.

On the second day, Gloucester was killed at the start of the battle. Hereford fought throughout the day, leading a large company of Welsh and English knights and archers. The archers who might have had success at breaking up the Scots &quot;schiltrons&quot; were attacked and overrun by the Scots cavalry. 

When the battle was lost, Bohun retreated with the Earl of Angus and several other barons, knights and men to Bothwell Castle, seeking a safe haven. However, all the refugees who entered the castle were taken prisoner by its formerly pro-English governor, Walter fitz Gilbert, who, like many Lowland knights, declared for Bruce as soon as word came of the Scottish King&#x27;s victory. 

Humphrey de Bohun was ransomed by Edward II, his brother-in-law, on the pleading of Edward&#x27;s wife Isabella. This was one of the most interesting ransoms in English history. The Earl was traded for Bruce&#x27;s queen, Elizabeth de Burgh and daughter, Marjorie Bruce, two bishops among other important Scots captives in England. Isabella MacDuff, Countess of Buchan, who had crowned Robert Bruce in 1306 and for years had been locked in a cage outside Berwick, was not included; presumably, she had died in captivity.

==Ordainer==

Like his father, grandfather, and great-great-grandfather, this Humphrey de Bohun was careful to insist that the king obey Magna Carta and other baronially established safeguards against monarchic tyranny. He was a leader of the reform movements that promulgated the Ordinances of 1311 and fought to insure their execution.

The subsequent revival of royal authority and the growing ascendancy of the Despensers (Hugh the elder and younger) led Bohun and other barons to rebel against the king again in 1322. Bohun had a special reason for opposing the Despensers, for he had lost some of his estates in the Welsh Marches to their rapacity and he felt they had besmirched his honour. In 1316 Bohun had been ordered to lead the suppression of the revolt of Llywelyn Bren in Glamorgan which he did successfully. When Llewelyn surrendered to him the Earl promised to intercede for him and fought to have him pardoned. Instead Hugh the younger Despenser had Llewelyn executed without a proper trial. Hereford and the other marcher lords used Llywelyn Bren&#x27;s death as a symbol of Despenser tyranny.

==Death at Boroughbridge==

The rebel forces were halted by loyalist troops at the wooden bridge at Boroughbridge, Yorkshire, where Humphrey de Bohun, leading an attempt to storm the bridge, met his death on 16 March 1322.

Although the details have been called into question by a few historians, his death may have been particularly gory. As recounted by Ian Mortimer:
:&quot;&quot;[The 4th Earl of] Hereford led the fight on the bridge, but he and his men were caught in the arrow fire. Then one of de Harclay&#x27;s pikemen, concealed beneath the bridge, thrust upwards between the planks and skewered the Earl of Hereford...twisting the head of the iron pike into his intestines. His dying screams turned the advance into a panic.&quot;&#x27;

Humphrey de Bohun may have contributed to the failure of the reformers&#x27; aims. There is evidence that he suffered for some years, especially after his countess&#x27;s death in 1316, from clinical depression.

== Marriage and children==
His marriage to Elizabeth of Rhuddlan daughter of King Edward I of England and his first wife, Eleanor of Castile, on 14 November 1302, at Westminster gained him the lands of Berkshire.

Elizabeth had an unknown number of children, probably eleven, by Humphrey de Bohun.
Until the earl&#x27;s death the boys of the family, and possibly the girls, were given a classical education under the tutelage of a Sicilian Greek, Master &quot;Digines&quot; (Diogenes), who may have been Humphrey de Bohun&#x27;s boyhood tutor. He was evidently well educated, a book collector and scholar, interests his son Humphrey and daughter Margaret (Courtenay) inherited.

<doc id="1029959" wikidata="Q802101" url="?curid=1029959" title="Elliott Highway">
<text>The Elliott Highway is a highway in the U.S. state of Alaska that extends 152 miles (245 km) from Fox, about 10 miles (16 km) north of Fairbanks, to Manley Hot Springs. It was completed in 1959 and is part of Alaska Route 2.

==Route description==
The highway is paved and in generally good condition year-round between Fairbanks and the junction with the Dalton Highway, but reverts to an unpaved road for the final to Manley Hot Springs. This portion of the road, particularly in winter, can be very challenging to navigate due to overflow of ice and water on the road, high-wind areas, and drifting snow. There is no cellular telephone service available on the Elliott Highway north of Wickersham Dome, though there is fuel available in Minto, and traffic, particularly past the Dalton Highway cutoff, can be extremely sparse.

Travelers are advised to check road conditions before traveling this road through the state transportation hotline, and to carry emergency supplies and fuel enough for .

Near Manley Hot Springs there is a 50-mile side road to Tanana over Tofty. This road was built 2014-2016 for a cost of $13 million.
The road ends on the south side of the Yukon River, so a boat trip or an ice road is also needed to reach Tanana.

Minto is also served by a side road off the main highway called the Minto Road. The Dalton Highway begins 73 miles (118 km) north of Fox at its junction with the Elliott Highway.

==Future==
A road project (Manley Hot Springs–Nome) is being discussed in Alaska. It has been estimated (in 2010) to cost $2.3–2.7 billion, or approximately $5 million per mile.

The road to Nome has received hesitation because of the cost. Former governor Sean Parnell wanted, as a beginning, to build a road from Manley Hot Springs to Tanana, around 35 miles length, and the road to Tanana was opened in 2016, ending at the Yukon River. The last 12 miles is private property, and belongs to the village corporation Tozitna Limited. The parking lot by the river is for residents, shareholders and tribal members only. During winters an ice road is made on the river ice, enabling road access for a few months; weather depending. Any continuation would require a fairly expensive bridge to be built. A ferry is an option also, but then the river would be impassable when the ice is too weak for driving but too thick for a ferry.

<doc id="1029962" wikidata="Q7799163" url="?curid=1029962" title="Thundering herd problem">
<text>In computer science, the thundering herd problem occurs when a large number of processes or threads waiting for an event are awakened when that event occurs, but only one process is able to handle the event. When the processes wake up, they will each try to handle the event, but only one will win. All processes will compete for resources, possibly freezing the computer, until the herd is calmed down again.

== Mitigation ==
The Linux kernel serializes responses for requests to a single file descriptor, so only one thread or process is woken up. For epoll() in version 4.5 of the Linux kernel, the EPOLLEXCLUSIVE flag was added. Thus several epoll sets (different threads or different processes) may wait on the same resource and only one set will be woken up. For certain workloads this flag can give significant processing time reduction.

Similarly in Microsoft Windows, I/O completion ports can mitigate the thundering herd problem, as they can be configured such that only one of the threads waiting on the completion port is woken up when an event occurs.

In systems that rely on a backoff mechanism (e.g. exponential backoff), the clients will retry failed calls by waiting a specific amount of time between consecutive retries. In order to avoid the thundering herd problem, jitter can be purposefully introduced in order to break the synchronization across the clients, thereby avoiding collisions. In this approach, randomness is added to the wait intervals between retries, so that clients are no longer synchronized.

<doc id="1029965" wikidata="Q3735885" url="?curid=1029965" title="The Examiner (1808–1886)">
<text>The Examiner was a weekly paper founded by Leigh and John Hunt in 1808. For the first fifty years it was a leading intellectual journal expounding radical principles, but from 1865 it repeatedly changed hands and political allegiance, resulting in a rapid decline in readership and loss of purpose. The paper ceased publication in 1886.

==Early history==
While &quot;The Examiner&quot; was in the hands of John and Leigh Hunt, the sub-title was &quot;A Sunday paper, on politics, domestic economy, and theatricals&quot;, and the newspaper devoted itself to providing independent reports on each of these areas. It consistently published leading writers of the day, including Lord Byron, Mary Shelley, Percy Bysshe Shelley, John Keats and William Hazlitt. The Hunt brothers failed in their initial aspiration to refuse advertisements in an effort to increase impartiality. In the first edition, the editor claimed &quot;The Examiner&quot; would pursue &quot;truth for its sole object&quot;; the paper&#x27;s radical reformist principles resulted in a series of high-profile prosecutions of the editors. A tradition of publishing accurate news and witty criticisms of domestic and foreign politics was continued by Albany Fonblanque, who took over the paper in 1828.

Until Fonblanque sold &quot;The Examiner&quot; in the mid-1860s, the newspaper took the form of a sixteen-page journal priced at 6d, designed to be kept and repeatedly referred to.

==Later times==
Albany Fonblanque, the journal&#x27;s political commentator since 1826, took over &quot;The Examiner&quot; in 1830, serving as editor until 1847. He brought in such contributors as John Stuart Mill, John Forster, William Makepeace Thackeray, and most notably Charles Dickens. Fonblanque also wrote the first notice of &quot;Sketches by Boz&quot; (28 February 1836) and of &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot; (4 September 1836). Forster became the magazine&#x27;s literary editor in 1835, and succeeded Fonblanque as editor from 1847 to 1855. Forster himself was succeeded by Marmion Savage.

&quot;The Examiner&quot;″s reputation was undermined when the new owner, William McCullagh Torrens, halved the price of the publication in 1867. Although its tradition of radical intellectual commentaries was revived in the 1870s under the editorship of William Minto, &quot;The Examiner&quot; was repeatedly sold until the final edition appeared in February 1881.

The magazine ceased publication in 1886.

<doc id="1029967" wikidata="Q178483" url="?curid=1029967" title="Hypernucleus">
<text>A hypernucleus is similar to a conventional atomic nucleus, but contains at least one hyperon in addition to the normal protons and neutrons. Hyperons are a category of baryon particles that carry non-zero strangeness quantum number, which is conserved by the strong and electromagnetic interactions.

A variety of reactions give access to depositing one or more units of strangeness in a nucleus. Hypernuclei containing the lightest hyperon, the lambda (Λ), tend to be more tightly bound than normal nuclei, though they can decay via the weak force with a mean lifetime of around . Sigma (Σ) hypernuclei have been sought, as have doubly-strange nuclei containing xi baryons (Ξ) or two Λ&#x27;s.

== Nomenclature ==
Hypernuclei are named in terms of their atomic number and baryon number, as in normal nuclei, plus the hyperon(s) which are listed in a left subscript of the symbol, with the caveat that atomic number is interpreted as the total charge of the hypernucleus, including charged hyperons such as the xi minus (Ξ−) as well as protons. For example, the hypernucleus contains 8 protons, 7 neutrons, and one Λ (which carries no charge).

== History ==
The first was discovered by Marian Danysz and Jerzy Pniewski in 1952 using a nuclear emulsion plate exposed to cosmic rays, based on their energetic but delayed decay. This event was inferred to be due to a nuclear fragment containing a Λ baryon. Experiments until the 1970s would continue to study hypernuclei produced in emulsions using cosmic rays, and later using pion (π) and kaon (K) beams from particle accelerators.

Since the 1980s, more efficient production methods using pion and kaon beams have allowed further investigation at various accelerator facilities, including CERN, Brookhaven National Laboratory, KEK, DAφNE, and JPARC. In the 2010s, heavy ion experiments such as ALICE and STAR first allowed the production and measurement of light hypernuclei formed through hadronization from quark–gluon plasma.

== Properties ==
Hypernuclear physics differs from that of normal nuclei because a hyperon is distinguishable from the four nucleon spin and isospin. That is, a single hyperon is not restricted by the Pauli exclusion principle, and can sink to the lowest energy level. As such, hypernuclei are often smaller and more tightly bound than normal nuclei; for example, the lithium hypernucleus is 19% smaller than the normal nucleus 6Li. However, the hyperons can decay via the weak force; the mean lifetime of a free Λ is , and that of a Λ hypernucleus is usually slightly shorter.

A generalized mass formula developed for both the non-strange normal nuclei and strange hypernuclei can estimate masses of hypernuclei containing Λ, ΛΛ, Σ, and Ξ hyperon(s). The neutron and proton driplines for hypernuclei are predicted and existence of some exotic hypernuclei beyond the normal neutron and proton driplines are suggested. This generalized mass formula was named the &quot;Samanta formula&quot; by Botvina and Pochodzalla and used to predict relative yields of hypernuclei in heavy-ion collisions.

== Types ==
=== Λ hypernuclei ===
The simplest, and most well understood, type of hypernucleus includes only the lightest hyperon, the Λ.
While two nucleons can interact through the nuclear force mediated by a virtual pion, the Λ becomes a Σ baryon upon emitting a pion, so the Λ–nucleon interaction is mediated solely by more massive mesons such as the η and ω mesons, or through the simultaneous exchange of two or more mesons. This means that the Λ–nucleon interaction is weaker and has a shorter range than the standard nuclear force, and the potential well of a Λ in the nucleus is shallower than that of a nucleon; in hypernuclei, the depth of the Λ potential is approximately 30 MeV. However, one-pion exchange in the Λ–nucleon interaction does cause quantum-mechanical mixing of the Λ and Σ baryons in hypernuclei (which does not happen in free space), especially in neutron-rich hypernuclei. Additionally, the three-body force between a Λ and two nucleons is expected to be more important than the three-body interaction in nuclei, since the Λ can exchange two pions with a virtual Σ intermediate, while the equivalent process in nucleons requires a relatively heavy delta baryon (Δ) intermediate.

Like all hyperons, Λ hypernuclei can decay through the weak interaction, which changes it to a lighter baryon and emits a meson or a lepton–antilepton pair. In free space, the Λ usually decays via the weak force to a proton and a π– meson, or a neutron and a π0, with a total half-life of . A nucleon in the hypernucleus can cause the Λ to decay via the weak force without emitting a pion; this process becomes dominant in heavy hypernuclei, due to suppression of the pion-emitting decay mode. The half-life of the Λ in a hypernucleus is considerably shorter, plateauing to about near , but some empirical measurements substantially disagree with each other or with theoretical predictions.

===Hypertriton===
The simplest hypernucleus is the hypertriton (), which consists of one proton, one neutron, and one Λ hyperon. The Λ in this system is very loosely bound, having a separation energy of 130 keV and a large radius of 10.6 fm, compared to about for the deuteron.

This loose binding would imply a lifetime similar to a free Λ. However, the measured hypertriton lifetime averaged across all experiments (about ) is substantially shorter than predicted by theory, as the non-mesonic decay mode is expected to be relatively minor; some experimental results are substantially shorter or longer than this average.

=== Σ hypernuclei ===
The existence of hypernuclei containing a Σ baryon is less clear. Several experiments in the early 1980s reported bound hypernuclear states above the Λ separation energy and presumed to contain one of the slightly heavier Σ baryons, but experiments later in the decade ruled out the existence of such states. Results from exotic atoms containing a Σ− bound to a nucleus by the electromagnetic force have found a net repulsive Σ–nucleon interaction in medium-sized and large hypernuclei, which means that no Σ hypernuclei exist in such mass range. However, an experiment in 1998 definitively observed the light Σ hypernucleus .

=== ΛΛ and Ξ hypernuclei ===
Hypernuclei containing two Λ baryons have been made. However, such hypernuclei are much harder to produce due to containing two strange quarks, and , only seven candidate ΛΛ hypernuclei have been observed. Like the Λ–nucleon interaction, empirical and theoretical models predict that the Λ–Λ interaction is mildly attractive.

Hypernuclei containing a Ξ baryon are known. Empirical studies and theoretical models indicate that the Ξ––proton interaction is attractive, but weaker than the Λ–nucleon interaction. Like the Σ– and other negatively charged particles, the Ξ– can also form an exotic atom. When a Ξ– is bound in an exotic atom or a hypernucleus, it quickly decays to a ΛΛ hypernucleus or to two Λ hypernuclei by exchanging a strange quark with a proton, which releases about 29 MeV of energy in free space:
:Ξ− + p → Λ + Λ

=== Ω hypernuclei ===
Hypernuclei containing the omega baryon (Ω) were predicted using lattice QCD in 2018; in particular, the proton–Ω and Ω–Ω dibaryons (bound systems containing two baryons) are expected to be stable. , no such hypernuclei have been observed under any conditions, but the lightest such species could be produced in heavy-ion collisions, and measurements by the STAR experiment are consistent with the existence of the proton–Ω dibaryon.

=== Hypernuclei with higher strangeness ===
Since the Λ is electrically neutral and its nuclear force interactions are attractive, there are predicted to be arbitrarily large hypernuclei with high strangeness and small net charge, including species with no nucleons. Binding energy per baryon in multi-strange hypernuclei can reach up to 21 MeV/&quot;A&quot; under certain conditions, compared to 8.80 MeV/&quot;A&quot; for the ordinary nucleus 62Ni. Additionally, formation of Ξ baryons should quickly become energetically favorable, unlike when there are no Λ&#x27;s, because the exchange of strangeness with a nucleon would be impossible due to the Pauli exclusion principle.

== Production ==
Several modes of production have been devised to make hypernuclei through bombardment of normal nuclei.

===Strangeness exchange and production===
One method of producing a K− meson exchanges a strange quark with a nucleon and changes it to a Λ:
:p + K− → Λ + π0
:n + K− → Λ + π−
The cross section for the formation of a hypernucleus is maximized when the momentum of the kaon beam is approximately 500 MeV/&quot;c&quot;. Several variants of this setup exist, including ones where the incident kaons are either brought to rest before colliding with a nucleus.

In rare cases, the incoming K− can instead produce a Ξ hypernucleus via the reaction:
:p + K− → Ξ− + K+

The equivalent strangeness production reaction involves a π+ meson reacts with a neutron to change it to a Λ:
:n + π+ → Λ + K+
This reaction has a maximum cross section at a beam momentum of 1.05 GeV/&quot;c&quot;, and is the most efficient production route for Λ hypernuclei, but requires larger targets than strangeness exchange methods.

===Elastic scattering===
Electron scattering off of a proton can change it to a Λ and produce a K+:
:p + e− → Λ + e− + K+
where the prime symbol denotes a scattered electron. The energy of an electron beam can be more easily tuned than pion or kaon beams, making it easier to measure and calibrate hypernuclear energy levels. Initially theoretically predicted in the 1980s, this method was first used experimentally in the early 2000s.

===Hyperon capture===
The capture of a Ξ− baryon by a nucleus can make a Ξ− exotic atom or hypernucleus. Upon capture, it changes to a ΛΛ hypernucleus or two Λ hypernuclei. The disadvantage is that the Ξ− baryon is harder to make into a beam than singly strange hadrons. However, an experiment at J-PARC begun in 2020 will compile data on Ξ and ΛΛ hypernuclei using a similar, non-beam setup where scattered Ξ− baryons rain onto an emulsion target.

===Heavy-ion collisions===
== Similar species ==
===Kaonic nuclei===
The K– meson can orbit a nucleus in an exotic atom, such as in kaonic hydrogen. Although the K–-proton strong interaction in kaonic hydrogen is repulsive, the K––nucleus interaction is attractive for larger systems, so this meson can enter a strongly bound state closely related to a hypernucleus; in particular, the K––proton–proton system is experimentally known and more tightly bound than a normal nucleus.

===Charmed hypernuclei===
Nuclei containing a charm quark have been predicted theoretically since 1977, and are described as charmed hypernuclei despite the possible absence of strange quarks. In particular, the lightest charmed baryons, the Λc and Σc baryons, are predicted to exist in bound states in charmed hypernuclei, and could be created in processes analogous to those used to make hypernuclei. The depth of the Λc potential in nuclear matter is predicted to be 58 MeV, but unlike Λ hypernuclei, larger hypernuclei containing the positively charged Λc would be less stable than the corresponding Λ hypernuclei due to Coulomb repulsion. The mass difference between the Λc and the is too large for appreciable mixing of these baryons to occur in hypernuclei. Weak decays of charmed hypernuclei have strong relativistic corrections compared to those in ordinary hypernuclei, as the energy released in the decay process is comparable to the mass of the Λ baryon.

=== Antihypernuclei ===
In August 2024 the STAR Collaboration reported the observation of the heaviest antimatter nucleus known, antihyperhydrogen-4 formula_1 consisting of one antiproton, two antineutrons and an antihyperon. 

The anti-lambda hyperon formula_2 and the antihypertriton formula_3 have also been previously observed.

<text>Joseph Trumbull (December 7, 1782 – August 4, 1861) was a U.S. lawyer, banker, and politician from Connecticut. He represented Connecticut in the U.S. Congress from 1834 to 1835, then again from 1839 to 1843. He later served as the 35th governor of Connecticut from 1849 to 1850.

==Early life==
Joseph Trumbull was born in Lebanon, Connecticut, on December 7, 1782. He graduated from Yale University in 1801, and studied law with his cousin William Trumbull Williams. In 1802 he moved to the Connecticut Western Reserve (now Trumbull County, Ohio) and was admitted to the bar. Shortly thereafter he moved back to Connecticut, establishing a law practice in Hartford.

==Career==
In addition to a successful law practice, Trumbull was active in several businesses. From 1828 to 1839 he was president of the Hartford Bank, and he served as president of the Providence, Hartford &amp; Fishkill Railroad.

Originally a national Republican, and later a Whig, Trumbull began his political career with election to the Connecticut House of Representatives in 1832.

He was sent to the U.S. Congress in December 1834 to complete the term of William W. Ellsworth who had resigned, and was elected as a Whig to the Twenty-sixth and Twenty-seventh Congresses (March 4, 1839 – March 3, 1843).

Trumbull served as Governor of Connecticut in 1849 and 1850.

In 1849 he received the honorary degree of LL.D. from Yale. In 1851 he served again in the Connecticut House of Representatives.

==Death and burial==
He died Hartford on August 4, 1861, as the result of typhoid fever. He was buried at Old North Cemetery in Hartford. Two days later, his second wife Eliza also died.

Within a year of his death ten of his close relatives died, including his sister Abigail, his wife Eliza, his brother-in-law William L. Storrs, Joseph and Eliza&#x27;s daughter Eliza, their son-in-law Lucius Robinson and Lucius&#x27; father David Robinson.

==Family==
Joseph Trumbull was born into an influential and politically active family. His grandfather, Jonathan Trumbull, was a colonial Connecticut governor and was the first governor of the State of Connecticut, serving a total of fourteen one year terms. His uncle, Jonathan Trumbull Jr. served as governor for ten terms. Another uncle, John Trumbull, served as a personal aide to George Washington during the Revolutionary War and became a famous painter. Several of his paintings are hanging in the Capitol Rotunda in Washington, D.C. His aunt Mary Trumbull married William Williams, a political activist and signer of the Declaration of Independence.

His first wife, Harriet Champion, was the daughter of Henry Champion, a general in the Revolutionary War. His second wife was the sister of William L. Storrs, a U.S. Congressman and later the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Connecticut.

Joseph Trumbull was born to David Trumbull and his wife &quot;née&quot; Sarah Backus in Lebanon, Connecticut. He lived in the family home known as Redwood, on the Lebanon green.

David and Sarah had five children. Joseph&#x27;s siblings were:
* Sarah Trumbull (1779–1839), who married William Trumbull Williams (1779–1839), her cousin
* Abigail Trumbull (1781–1861), who married Peter Lanman (1771–1854)
* John Trumbull (1784–1859), who married Anne Gibbons (1789–1823), Hanna Wallace Tunis (1800–1823) and Eliza Bruen (1793–1857)
* Jonathan G. W. Trumbull (about 1790–1853), who married Jane Eliza Lathrop (1795–1843)

Harriet died in 1823 and Joseph married Eliza Storrs (1784–1861), sister of William L. Storrs, on December 1 of the following year. With his second wife he was the father of a daughter, Eliza Storrs Trumbull (1826–1862).

<doc id="1029981" wikidata="Q208705" url="?curid=1029981" title="Cynodon dactylon">
<text>Cynodon dactylon, commonly known as Bermuda grass, also known as couch grass in Australia and New Zealand, is a grass found worldwide. It is native to Europe, Africa, Australia and much of Asia. It has been introduced to the Americas. Contrary to its common name, it is not native to Bermuda and is in fact an abundant invasive species there. In Bermuda it has been known as &quot;crab grass&quot; (also a name for &quot;Digitaria sanguinalis&quot;). Other names are &quot;Dhoob&quot;, &quot;dūrvā&quot; grass, &quot;ethana&quot; grass, &quot;dubo&quot;, dog grass, dog&#x27;s tooth grass, Bahama grass, crab grass, devil&#x27;s grass, couch grass, Indian &quot;doab&quot;, &quot;arugampul&quot;, grama, wiregrass and scutch grass.

==Description==

The blades are a grey-green colour and are short, usually long with rough edges. The erect stems can grow tall. The stems are slightly flattened, often tinged purple in colour.

The seed heads are produced in a cluster of two to six spikes together at the top of the stem, each spike long.

It has a deep root system; in drought situations with penetrable soil, the root system can grow to over deep, though most of the root mass is less than under the surface. The grass creeps along the ground with its stolons, and roots wherever a node touches the ground, forming a dense mat. &quot;C. dactylon&quot; reproduces through seeds, stolons, and rhizomes. Growth begins at temperatures above with optimum growth between ; in winter or in the dry season, the grass becomes dormant and turns brown. Growth is promoted by full sun and retarded by full shade, e.g., close to tree trunks.

==Cultivation==
&quot;Cynodon dactylon&quot; is widely cultivated in warm climates all over the world between about 30° S and 30° N latitude, and that get between of rainfall a year (or less, if irrigation is available). For example, in the United States, it is grown mostly in the southern half of the country.

===Cultivars===
Hundreds of cultivars have been created specifically for environmental tolerance and stakeholder requirements. New cultivars are released yearly.

==Uses==
===Religious===
Commonly known as &quot;durva&quot; or dūrvāyugma in India, this grass is used in the Ayurveda system of medicine. Performing a rite called &quot;the consecration of Rudra (Sanskrit &quot;Rudrabhisheka&quot;) described in the Purāṇas (Sanskrit &quot;purāṇokta&quot;) while offering durva 11 times bestows long life. In Hinduism, it is considered important in the worship of Lord Ganesha. A clump of 21 shoots of this grass is usually offered during puja (worship). It has been a part of Hindu rituals since Vedic times. A unique festival called Durga Ashtami, dedicated to this grass, is celebrated on the eighth day of Shukla Paksha of Bhadra month of the Hindu calendar.

It is known as &quot;Arugampul&quot; in Tamil and &quot;Karuka&quot; in Malayalam and is part of the Dashapushpam (Ten sacred flowers) in Kerala.

In Nepal, the grass is known as &quot;dubo&quot; and is used by the Hindus. According to Nepalese Hindus, the grass symbolises long life. The grass is an essential item for the Naga Panchami festival as well as the Gaura festival. In a Nepalese Hindu wedding, a garland made of this grass is worn by both bride and groom.

This grass is a Yoruba herb used for Esu or Elegba in the Ifá system of orishas.

===Medicinal value===
The rhizomes are reported to act as a diuretic in humans and the grass juice can act as an astringent.

It has been observed that &quot;Cynodon dactylon&quot; may be selectively eaten by dogs to swiftly induce vomiting when they have gastrointestinal problems. The effect may be due to irritation caused by bristles on the leaf margin.

===Other===
It is fast-growing and tough, making it popular and useful for sports fields, as when damaged it will recover quickly. It is a highly desirable turf grass in warm temperate climates, particularly for those regions where its tolerance to heat and drought enable it to survive where few other grasses do. This combination makes it a frequent choice for golf courses in the southern and southeastern United States and South Africa. It has a relatively coarse-bladed form with numerous cultivars selected for different turf requirements.

Bermuda grass has been cultivated in saline soils in California&#x27;s Central Valley, which are too salt-damaged to support agricultural crops; it was successfully irrigated with saline water and used to graze cattle.

==Professional sports==
===National Football League===
The following National Football League teams use it as the playing surface in their home stadiums:

*Arizona Cardinals (State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona) (Tifway 419 Hybrid Bermudagrass)
*Baltimore Ravens (M&amp;T Bank Stadium in Baltimore) (Tifway 419 Bermuda grass)
*Chicago Bears (Soldier Field in Chicago) (Tahoma 31 Bermuda grass)
*Jacksonville Jaguars (TIAA Bank Field in Jacksonville, Florida) (Tifway 419 Bermuda grass)
*Kansas City Chiefs (Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri) (Latitude 36 Bermuda grass)
*Las Vegas Raiders (Allegiant Stadium in Paradise, Nevada) 
*Miami Dolphins (Hard Rock Stadium in Miami) (Tifway 419 Bermuda grass)
*Philadelphia Eagles (Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia (Tahoma 31 Bermuda grass)
*San Francisco 49ers (Levi&#x27;s Stadium in Santa Clara, California) (Tifway II Bermuda grass)
*Tampa Bay Buccaneers (Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida) (Tifway 419 Bermudagrass)
*Tennessee Titans (Nissan Stadium in Nashville, Tennessee) (Tifsport Bermuda sod)
*Washington Commanders (FedEx Field in Landover, Maryland) (Latitude 36 Bermuda grass)

===Major League Baseball===
The following Major League Baseball teams use it as the playing surface in their home stadiums:

*Los Angeles Angels (Angel Stadium in Anaheim, California) (Tifway 419 Bermudagrass)
*Los Angeles Dodgers (Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles) (Santa Ana Bermudagrass)
*Oakland Athletics (Oakland Coliseum in Oakland, California) (Tifway II Bermuda Grass)
*San Diego Padres (Petco Park in San Diego) (BullsEye Bermuda Grass)
*San Francisco Giants (Oracle Park in San Francisco) (Tifway 419 Bermudagrass)

==Ecology==

===Invasive species===
It is a highly aggressive invasive species, crowding out most other grasses and invading other habitats, and has become a hard-to-eradicate weed in some areas (it can be controlled somewhat with Triclopyr, Mesotrione, Fluazifop-P-butyl, and Glyphosate). This weedy nature leads some gardeners to give it the name of &quot;devil grass&quot;. Bermuda grass is incredibly difficult to control in flower beds and most herbicides do not work. However, Ornamec, Ornamec 170, Turflon ester (tricyclopyr), and Imazapyr have shown some effectiveness. All of these items are difficult to find in retail stores, as they are primarily marketed to professional landscapers.

The hybrid variety Tifton 85, like some other grasses (e.g. sorghum), produces cyanide under certain conditions, and has been implicated in several livestock deaths.

<text>The Plain Truth was a free-of-charge monthly magazine, first published in 1934 by Herbert W. Armstrong, founder of The Radio Church of God, which he later named The Worldwide Church of God (WCG). The magazine, subtitled as The Plain Truth: a magazine of understanding, gradually developed into an international, free-of-charge news magazine, sponsored by the WCG church membership. The magazine&#x27;s messages often centered on the pseudo-scientific doctrine of British Israelism, the belief that the early inhabitants of the British Isles, and hence their descendants, were actually descendants of the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel.

By 1986, &quot;The Plain Truth&quot; was published in seven languages. The magazine&#x27;s monthly circulation was roughly 8.2 million; in contrast, &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s 1986 monthly circulation was 5.9 million. 
After Armstrong&#x27;s death in 1986, new WCG leadership sought to change the core principles of WCG doctrine, quashed publication of Armstrong&#x27;s writings, sold off most of the church&#x27;s holdings, and began offering magazine subscriptions for sale. WCG leadership eventually changed the name of the organization and embraced positions closer to those of mainstream Protestantism.

After Joseph W. Tkach took over, leading to a major doctrinal transformation of the Worldwide Church of God, the circulation of &quot;The Plain Truth&quot;, distributed free by subscription and via newsstand distribution around the globe, fell from a peak of 8 million to less than 100,000 before it switched to a paid subscription status. Eventually the magazine was spun off into a separate, independent, evangelical ministry as Plain Truth Ministries.

==Plain Truth Ministries==
With &quot;The Plain Truth&quot; being ceded to Plain Truth Ministries, the traditional magazine has changed its format and replaced by two distinct publications:

*Plain Truth dropping &quot;The&quot; from the title. It is an 8-page online publication in a newsletter format published 6 times annually (once every two months), with issues in January, March, May, July, September and November of each year. Digital copies are available to subscribers.
*CWR magazine (standing for Christianity without the Religion magazine). It is a 16-page publication in magazine format, published 6 times annually (once every two months), with issues in February, April, June, August, October and December of each year. Printed hard copies are sent by mail as per subscription.

Plain Truth Ministries also publishes a monthly newsletter &quot;CWR/PTM Monthly Letter&quot;, a CWR Blog, a Daily Radio Show, a Weekly Audio Teaching Ministry.

<doc id="1029985" wikidata="Q1070290" url="?curid=1029985" title="Prisoner-of-war camp">
<text>A prisoner-of-war camp (often abbreviated as POW camp) is a site for the containment of enemy fighters captured as prisoners of war by a belligerent power in time of war.

There are significant differences among POW camps, internment camps, and military prisons. Purpose-built prisoner-of-war camps appeared at Norman Cross in England in 1797 during the French Revolutionary Wars and HM Prison Dartmoor, constructed during the Napoleonic Wars, and they have been in use in all the main conflicts of the last 200 years. The main camps are used for marines, sailors, soldiers, and more recently, airmen of an enemy power who have been captured by a belligerent power during or immediately after an armed conflict. Civilians, such as merchant mariners and war correspondents, have also been imprisoned in some conflicts. Per the 1929 Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War, later superseded by the Third Geneva Convention, such camps have been required to be open to inspection by representatives of a neutral power, but this hasn&#x27;t always been consistently applied.

==Detention of prisoners of war before the development of camps==
Before the Peace of Westphalia, enemy fighters captured by belligerent forces were usually executed, enslaved, or held for ransom. This, coupled with the relatively small size of armies, meant there was little need for any form of camp to hold prisoners of war. The Peace of Westphalia, a series of treaties signed between May and October 1648 that ended the Thirty Years&#x27; War and the Eighty Years&#x27; War, contained a provision that all prisoners should be released without ransom. This is generally considered to mark the point where captured enemy fighters would be reasonably treated before being released at the end of the conflict or under a parole not to take up arms. The practice of paroling enemy fighters had begun thousands of years earlier, at least as early as the time of Carthage but became normal practice in Europe from 1648 onwards. The consequent increase in the number of prisoners was to lead eventually to the development of the prisoner of war camps.

==Development of temporary camps==

Following General John Burgoyne&#x27;s surrender at the Battle of Saratoga in 1777, several thousand British and German (Hessian and Brunswick) troops were marched to Cambridge, Massachusetts. For various reasons, the Continental Congress desired to move them south. For this purpose, one of the congressmen offered his land outside of Charlottesville, Virginia. The remaining soldiers (some 2,000 British, upwards of 1,900 German, and roughly 300 women and children) marched south in late 1778—arriving at the site (near Ivy Creek) in January 1779. Since the barracks were barely sufficient in construction, the officers were paroled to live as far away as Richmond and Staunton. The camp was never adequately provisioned, but the prisoners built a theater on the site. Hundreds escaped Albemarle Barracks because of the shortage of guards. As the British Army moved northward from the Carolinas in late 1780, the remaining prisoners were moved to Frederick, Maryland; Winchester, Virginia; and perhaps elsewhere. No remains of the encampment site are left.

==First purpose-built camp==

The earliest known purpose-built prisoner-of-war camp was established by the Kingdom of Great Britain at Norman Cross, in 1797 to house the increasing number of prisoners from the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars. The prison operated until 1814 and held between 3,300 and 6,272 men.

==American Civil War camps==
Lacking a means for dealing with large numbers of captured troops early in the American Civil War, the Union and Confederate governments relied on the traditional European system of parole and exchange of prisoners. While awaiting exchange, prisoners were confined to permanent camps.

Neither Union or Confederate prison camps were always well run, and it was common for prisoners to die of starvation or disease. It is estimated that about 56,000 soldiers died in prisons during the war; almost 10% of all Civil War fatalities. During a period of 14 months in Camp Sumter, located near Andersonville, Georgia, 13,000 (28%) of the 45,000 Union soldiers confined there died. At Camp Douglas in Chicago, Illinois, 10% of its Confederate prisoners died during one cold winter month; and the 25% death rate at Elmira Prison in New York State very nearly equaled that of Andersonville&#x27;s.

==Boer War==
During the Second Boer War, the British government established prisoner-of-war camps (to hold captured Boer belligerents or fighters) and concentration camps (to hold Boer civilians). In total, six prisoner-of-war camps were erected in South Africa and around 31 in overseas British colonies to hold Boer prisoners of war. The majority of Boer prisoners of war were sent overseas (25,630 out of the 28,000 Boer men captured during the fighting). After an initial settling-in period, these prisoner-of-war camps were generally well administered.

The number of concentration camps, all located in South Africa, was much higher and a total of 109 of these camps had been constructed by the end of the war - 45 camps for Boer civilians and 64 camps for black Africans. The vast majority of Boers held in the concentration camps were women and children. The concentration camps were generally poorly administered, the food rations were insufficient to maintain health, standards of hygiene were low, and overcrowding was chronic. Due to these conditions, thousands perished in the 109 concentration camps. Of the Boer women and children held in captivity, over 26,000 died during the war.

===Boer War camps===
==World War I==

The first international convention on prisoners of war was signed at the Hague Peace Conference of 1899. It was widened by the Hague Convention of 1907. The main combatant nations engaged in World War I abided by the convention and treatment of prisoners was generally good. The situation on the eastern front was significantly worse than the western front, with prisoners in Russia at risk from starvation and disease. In total during the war about eight million men were held in prisoner of war camps, with 2.5 million prisoners in German custody, 2.9 million held by the Russian Empire, and about 720,000 held by Britain and France.

Permanent camps did not exist at the beginning of the war. The unexpectedly large number of prisoners captured in the first days of the war by the German army created an immediate problem. By September 1914, the German army had captured over 200,000 enemy combatants. These first prisoners were held in temporary camps until 1915, by which time the prisoner population had increased to 652,000 living in unsatisfactory conditions. In response, the government began constructing permanent camps both in Germany and the occupied territories. The number of prisoners increased significantly during the war, exceeding one million by August 1915 and 1,625,000 by August 1916, and reaching 2,415,000 by the end of the war.

===Geneva Conference===
The International Committee of the Red Cross held a conference in Geneva, Switzerland in September 1917. The conference addressed the war, and the Red Cross addressed the conditions that the civilians were living under, which resembled those of soldiers in prisoner of war camps, as well as &quot;barbed wire disease&quot; (symptoms of mental illness) suffered by prisoners in France and Germany. It was agreed at the conference that the Red Cross would provide prisoners of war with mail, food parcels, clothes, and medical supplies and that prisoners in France and Germany suffering from &quot;barbed wire disease&quot; should be interned in Switzerland, a neutral country.

A few countries were not on the same terms as Germany and Austria. For example, Hungary believed that harsh conditions would reduce the number of traitors.

The countries in the east continued their fight to help the Red Cross provide support to POWs. At the end of the war, a Franco-German agreement was made that both countries would exchange their prisoners, but the French kept a small number while the Germans released all French prisoners.

===Krasnoyarsk===
Krasnoyarsk in Siberia, Russia, was used after the Russian defeat to the Japanese in the Russo-Japanese war, as a base for military camps to train for future wars. Conditions there were dire and the detainees could be conscripted for war while they lived in concentration camps and prisons. Over 50,000 camp tenants were used for transportation, agriculture, mining and machinery production.

Throughout World War I, captured prisoners of war were sent to various camps including the one in Krasnoyarsk. There was a point where a large mix of nationalities was together in Krasnoyarsk which included Bulgarians, Czechs, Germans, and Poles. Many prisoners were nationalists, which led to violence within the camp. Militants would be forced to put down the instigators and keep the camp running.

==Polish–Soviet War==

From autumn 1920, thousands of captured Red Army soldiers and guards had been placed in the Tuchola internment camp, in Pomerania. These prisoners lived in dugouts, and many died of hunger, cold, and infectious diseases. According to historians Zbigniew Karpus and Waldemar Rezmer, up to 2000 prisoners died in the camp during its operation.

In a joint work by Polish and Russian historians, Karpus and Rezmer estimate the total death toll in all Polish POW camps during the war at 16,000–17,000, while the Russian historian Matvejev estimates it at 18,000–20,000.

On the other side of the frontline about 20,000 out of about 51,000 Polish POWs died in Soviet and Lithuanian camps

While the conditions for Soviet prisoners were clearly exposed by the free press in Poland, no corresponding fact-finding about Soviet camps for Polish POWs could be expected from the tightly controlled Soviet press of the time. Available data shows many cases of mistreatment of Polish prisoners. There have been also cases of Polish POWs&#x27; being executed by the Soviet army, when no POW facilities were available.

==World War II==
The 1929 Geneva Convention on the Prisoners of War established certain provisions relative to the treatment of prisoners of war. One requirement was that POW camps were to be open to inspection by authorised representatives of a neutral power.
* Article 10 required that POWs should be lodged in adequately heated and lighted buildings where conditions were the same as their own troops.
* Articles 27–32 detailed the conditions of labour. Enlisted ranks were required to perform whatever labour they were asked and able to do, so long as it was not dangerous and did not support the captor&#x27;s war effort. Senior Non-commissioned officers (sergeants and above) were required to work only in a supervisory role. Commissioned officers were unrequired to work, although they could volunteer. The work performed was largely agricultural or industrial, ranging from coal or potash mining, stone quarrying, or work in saw mills, breweries, factories, railway yards, and forests. POWs hired out to military and civilian contractors and were paid $.80 per day in scrip in U.S. camps. The workers were also supposed to get at least one day of rest per week.
* Article 76 ensured that POWs who died in captivity were to be honourably interred in marked graves.

Not all combatants applied the provisions of the convention. In particular the Empire of Japan, which had signed but never ratified the convention, was notorious for its treatment of prisoners of war; this poor treatment occurred in part because the Japanese viewed surrender as dishonourable. Prisoners from all nations were subject to forced labour, beatings, torture, murder, and even medical experimentation. Rations fell short of the minimum required to sustain life, and many were forced into labour. After March 20, 1943, the Imperial Navy was under orders to execute all prisoners taken at sea. Japanese POW camps are found throughout south-east Asia and the Japanese conquered territories.

===Escapes===
The Great Escape from Stalag Luft III, on the night of March 24, 1944, involved the escape of 76 Allied servicemen, although only three were able to avoid recapture.

The Cowra breakout, on August 5, 1944, is believed to be the largest escape of POWs in recorded history and possibly the largest prison breakout ever. At least 545 Japanese POWs attempted to escape from a camp near Cowra, New South Wales, Australia. Most sources say that 234 POWs were killed or committed suicide. The remainder were recaptured.

The Great Papago Escape, on December 23, 1944, was the largest POW escape to occur from an American facility. Over 25 German POWs tunneled out of Camp Papago Park, near Phoenix, Arizona, and fled into the surrounding desert. Over the next few weeks all were recaptured.

The escape of Felice Benuzzi, Giovanni (&#x27;Giuàn&#x27;) Balletto, and Vincenzo (&#x27;Enzo&#x27;) Barsotti from Camp 354 in Nanyuki, Kenya, on a lark to climb Mount Kenya is of particular note. The account is recorded by Benuzzi in No Picnic on Mount Kenya. After their attempt to climb Mount Kenya, the trio &quot;escaped&quot; back into Camp 354.

===Role of the Red Cross===
After World War I, when around 40 million civilians and prisoners could not be saved, the Red Cross was entrusted with more rights and responsibilities. In the course of World War II, it provided millions of Red Cross parcels to Allied POWs in Axis prison camps; most of these contained food and personal hygiene items, while others held medical kits. A special &quot;release kit&quot; parcel was also provided to some newly released POWs at the war&#x27;s end. During the United States&#x27; call for war on Japan, the Red Cross stepped up to provide services for the soldiers overseas. A large number of provisions were needed for the soldiers in World War II over the 4 years that the Americans were involved. The American Red Cross and thirteen million volunteers had donated in the country with an average weekly donation of 111,000 pints of blood. Nurses, doctors, and volunteer workers worked on the front lines overseas to provide for the wounded and the needy. This program saved thousands of lives as plasma donations were delivered to the camps and bases. However, the Red Cross only accepted donations from white Americans and excluded those of Japanese, Italian, German and African Americans. To combat this, activists tried to fight such segregation back home with arguments that blood of Whites and blood of Blacks is the same.

===Conditions in Japanese camps===
In the lead up to the Second World War, Japan had engaged in several conflicts aimed at expanding its empire, most notably the Second Sino-Japanese War. Although maintaining its neutrality at the outbreak of war in Europe, in 1941 the Japanese military launched surprise attacks on Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand, the Philippines, and Pearl Harbor, which had brought the United States into the war on the side of the Allies. In 1942, after they had captured Hong Kong from the British, the Japanese established several prisoner-of-war camps in Kowloon to house Allied prisoners of war.

Believing it was shameful to be captured alive in combat, the Japanese ran their prisoner-of-war camps brutally, with many Allied prisoners of war dying in them. The Japanese field army code included a &quot;warrior spirit&quot;, which stated that an individual must calmly face death. Those who disobeyed orders would be sentenced to death via decapitation, usually carried out by the katana of Japanese officers. The sword was seen as a symbol of wisdom and perseverance to the Japanese, and they perceived that it was an honor to die by it.

Allied prisoners-of-war in Japanese camps were forced to engage in physical labour such as building bridges, erecting forts, and digging defence trenches. These prisoners received limited food, and once their military uniforms wore out, no replacements were given. Some brutal prison guards would answer requests for water with their beatings or rifle butts. Prisoners who were seen as no use, physically weak, or rebellious, would often be killed. At the end of the war, when the camp inmates were released, many had lost body parts, and many were starved and faced extreme emaciation. Some prisoners feared execution by the Japanese in response to American bombing. The brutality of the guards caused traumatized prisoners to suffer mental illnesses that persisted for decades afterward. In many cases, survivors of camps were traumatized or ended up living with a disability. Many survivors went home or to other areas of the world to have a successful life as a businessman, or they would devote themselves to helping poor people or people in the camps who were in need of support. A former PoW, Lieutenant Colonel Philip Toosey, stated that the Japanese committed brutal atrocities. Some of these included filling a prisoner&#x27;s nose with water while the guards tied them with barbed wire, then they would stand on the prisoners, stepping on the wires. Or the guards would tie a prisoner on a tree by their thumbs, with their toes barely touching the ground, and leave them there for two days without food or water. After the two days of torture, the prisoner would be jailed prior to execution, after which their corpses would later be burnt.

Life in the POW camps was recorded at great risk to themselves by artists such as Jack Bridger Chalker, Philip Meninsky, John Mennie, Ashley George Old, and Ronald Searle. Human hair was often used for brushes, plant juices and blood for paint, and toilet paper as the &quot;canvas&quot;. Some of their works were used as evidence in the trials of Japanese war criminals. Many are now held by the Australian War Memorial, State Library of Victoria, and the Imperial War Museum in London. The State Library of Victoria exhibited many of these works under the title &quot;The Major Arthur Moon Collection&quot;, in 1995.

In 2016, war historian Antony Beevor (who had recently completed his book &quot;The Second World War&quot;), said that the UK government had recently declassified information that some British POWs in some Japanese POW camps were subjected to being fattened, then cannibalised. Apparently, Winston Churchill had been aware of this atrocity, but kept the information secret; families would have been too distressed to learn that their sons had been the victims of cannibalism rather than killed in action.

More deaths occurred in Japanese POW camps than in any others. The Red Cross were not able to drop parcels into these camps because they were too well defended to fly over.

===Canadian camps===
The Second World War was mainly fought in Europe and western Russia, East Asia, and the Pacific; there were no invasions of Canada. The few prisoners of war sent to Canada included Japanese and German soldiers, captured U-boat crews, and prisoners from raids such as Dieppe and Normandy.

The camps meant for German POWs were smaller than those meant for Japanese prisoners of war and were far less brutal. German prisoners generally benefitted from good food. However, the hardest part was surviving the Canadian winters. Most camps were isolated and located in the far north. Death and sickness caused by the elements was common.

Many camps were only lightly watched, and as such, many Germans attempted escape. Tunnelling was the most common method. Peter Krug, an escapee from a prison located in Bowmanville, Ontario, managed to escape along the railroads, using forests as cover. He made his way to Toronto, where he then travelled to Texas.

Fighting, sometimes to the death, was somewhat common in the camps. Punishments for major infractions could include death by hanging. German POWs wore shirts with a large red dot painted on the back, an easily identifiable mark outside the camps. Therefore, escapees could be easily found and recaptured.
; Japanese in Canada
In the wake of the Japanese attacking Hong Kong, the Philippines and Pearl Harbor in which 2000 Canadians were involved, Canadians put a large focus onto Japanese-Canadians even though innocent. Japan seemed to be able to attack along the Pacific and Canada could potentially be next. Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King implemented the &quot;War Measures Act&quot; and the &quot;Defence of Canada Regulations&quot;; therefore, they could not get involved with Canadian services along with the Italians and Germans. The Nikkei (Canadians and Immigrants of Japanese origin) were stripped of possessions, which were later auctioned off without consent. The intense cold winters made it hard to live as the Nikkei were placed in camps; these campers were made of Japanese immigrants and Japanese-Canadians. They lived in barns and stables which were used for animals, therefore unsanitary. It took 5 years after the war for the Nikkei to gain their rights. Compensation was given but was not enough to cover the loss of properties. Over 22,000 Nikkei were put into these camps.

===Cigarettes as currency===
In many POW camps, cigarettes were widely used as currency known as &#x27;commodity money&#x27;. They performed the functions of money as a medium of exchange because they were generally accepted among the prisoners for settling payments or debts, and the function of money as a unit of account, because prices of other goods were expressed in terms of cigarettes. Compared with other goods, the supply of cigarettes was more stable, as they were rationed in the POW camps, and cigarettes were more divisible, portable, and homogeneous.

==Korean War==
===U.N. camps===
The International Red Cross visited United Nations-run POW camps, often unannounced, noting prisoner hygiene, quality of medical care, variety of diet, and weight gain. They talked to the prisoners and asked for their comments on conditions, as well as providing them with copies of the Geneva Convention. The IRC delegates dispersed boots, soap, and other requested goods.

A prison camp was established on the island of Koje-do, where over 170,000 communist and non-communist prisoners were held from December 1950 until June 1952. Throughout 1951 and early 1952, upper-level communist agents infiltrated and conquered much of Koje section-by-section by uniting fellow communists; bending dissenters to their will through staged trials and public executions; and exporting allegations of abuse to the international community to benefit the communist negotiation team. In May 1952, Chinese and North Korean prisoners rioted and took Brigadier General Francis T. Dodd captive.

In 1952 the camp&#x27;s administration were afraid that the prisoners would riot and demonstrate on May Day (a day honoring Communism) and so United States Navy ships (such as the USS &quot;Gunston Hall&quot;) removed 15,000 North Korean and Chinese prisoners from the island and moved them to prison facilities at Ulsan and Cheju-do. These ships also participated in Operation Big Switch in September 1953 when prisoners were exchanged at the end of the war.

===Communist camps===
The Chinese operated three types of POW camps during the Korean war. &quot;Peace camps&quot; housed POWs who were sympathetic to communism, &quot;reform camps&quot; were intended for skilled POWs who were to be indoctrinated in communist ideologies and the third type was the &quot;normal POW camps&quot;. Chinese policy did not allow for the exchange of prisoners in the first two camp types.

While these POW camps were designated numerically by the communists, the POWs often gave the camps a colloquial name.

==Vietnam War==
===South Vietnamese Army camps in South Vietnam===
By the end of 1965, Viet Cong suspects, prisoners of war, and even juvenile delinquents were mixed together in South Vietnamese jails and prisons. After June 1965, the prison population steadily rose, and by early 1966, there was no space to accommodate additional prisoners in the existing jails and prisons. In 1965, plans were made to construct five POW camps, each with an initial capacity of 1,000 prisoners and to be staffed by the South Vietnamese military police, with U.S. military policemen as a prisoner of war advisers assigned to each stockade.

==Afghanistan and Iraq wars==

The United States of America refused to grant prisoner-of-war status to many prisoners captured during its War in Afghanistan (2001–2021) and 2003 invasion of Iraq. This was mainly because it classed them as insurgents or terrorists, which did not meet the requirements laid down by the Third Geneva Convention of 1949 such as being part of a chain of command, wearing a &quot;fixed distinctive marking, visible from a distance&quot;, bearing arms openly, and conducting military operations in accordance with the laws and customs of war.

The legality of this refusal has been questioned and cases are pending in the U.S. courts. In the &quot;Hamdan v. Rumsfeld&quot; court case, on June 29, 2006, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the captives at Guantanamo Bay detention camp were entitled to the minimal protections listed under Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions. Other captives, including Saddam Hussein, have been accorded POW status. The International Red Cross has been permitted to visit at least some sites. Many prisoners were held in secret locations (black sites) around the world. The identified sites are listed below:

*Abu Ghraib prison – 32 km west of Baghdad, Iraq
*Bagram Air Base – near Charikar in Parvan, Afghanistan
*Camp Bucca – near Umm Qasr, Iraq
*Camp Delta – Guantanamo Bay, Cuba

==Biography==
Broadfoot&#x27;s first job at 17 years old was as a cub reporter who had to go to the homes of men killed in action in World War II and obtain photographs to run along with their death notices. At 18, he joined the Canadian Army and spent the next two years in the infantry.

Broadfoot&#x27;s historical research consisted of interviewing subjects, generally from across Canada, about their memories of their lives during specific historical periods such as the Great Depression and World War II. &quot;Ten Lost Years&quot;, his first in this series of books, published in 1973, was an oral history of the experiences of people during the Great Depression. He collected the experiences, via taped interviews, during the course of travelling across Canada four times, subsequent to leaving his position with the Vancouver Sun in 1971. The collected interviews became the basis of &quot;Ten Lost Years&quot;, a play written by Jack Winter, with music by Cedric Smith. The play, directed by George Luscombe, premiered in Toronto, toured Canada in 1974 and continues to be performed.

In 1997, he was made a Member of the Order of Canada, Canada&#x27;s highest civilian honour.

In 1998, Broadfoot suffered a stroke, which blinded him and impaired his memory. He died in Nanaimo, British Columbia, on November 28, 2003.

<doc id="1029993" wikidata="Q7764940" url="?curid=1029993" title="The Smoking Room">
<text>The Smoking Room is a British television sitcom written by Brian Dooley, who won a BAFTA for the series in 2005. The first series, consisting of eight episodes, was originally transmitted on BBC Three between 29 June and 17 August 2004. The Christmas Special was first transmitted on 21 December 2004. A second series of eight episodes began airing on 26 July 2005.

The first series, including the Christmas Special, was released on DVD by the BBC on 6 February 2006 and on CD in a four-disc set on 4 April 2005 (without the Christmas Special). The second series was released on 16 October 2006; a boxed set containing both series was released on the same date.

A third series was not commissioned; in an interview for the BBC News website on 30 November 2006, Robert Webb (who played Robin) said in passing, &quot;...there is no more &quot;Smoking Room&quot;&quot;. England&#x27;s smoking ban, which prohibits indoor smoking in workplaces, came into force on 1 October 2006, as a result of which internal smoking rooms, like the one in which the series is set, became illegal.

==Plot and analysis==

At the time the series was made, smoking was prohibited in the offices of most British companies, but there was often a room in the building that smokers could use during work hours.

The series is entirely set in the smoking room (Room B209, although, in the second series, the sign on one door says B211) in the basement of the offices of a fictitious company. Most of the people seen in the smoking room are workers in the building.

Room B209 is L-shaped and contains office-style tables and chairs, and a hot drinks machine which often malfunctions. It has two doors that lead to the same corridor and is drably decorated in a dull yellow with signs of water damage on one wall. Company related notices adorn the walls, and old furniture and office equipment is stacked in the corner. Only occasional glimpses of the outside world are seen through the room&#x27;s misted glass.

Although each episode contains a distinct storyline, the series is fundamentally character and dialogue-driven. Each episode&#x27;s story is generally self-contained, though there are some ongoing story threads, such as the gradual revelation of Robin&#x27;s sexuality to the other characters and his unrequited infatuation with Ben from the post room.

==Theme music==
The theme music for the programme is two different versions of &quot;Close to Me&quot; by The Cure, used without the vocals. This theme was not used in episodes screened in New Zealand and Australia on UK.TV

==Main characters==
There are ten main characters though not all appear in each episode. Most of the characters are somewhat disaffected with their lives and jobs. The smoking room is an oasis where they can relax, indulge and shut out the rest of the world. Due to a rule devised by Clint, discussion of work-related matters (&quot;shop talk&quot;) is forbidden in the smoking room, though there are some brief work-related discussions. Some characters spend long stretches in the room, with some present for most or all of a thirty-minute episode. The occasional non-smoker also drops by the room.

There is a general camaraderie between several of the smokers.

===Annie (Debbie Chazen)===

Annie is 29 and works in the graphics department. She considers herself rather &#x27;New Age&#x27; and sometimes talks about past-life experiences. She will accept theories from anywhere, including a souvenir mug with a picture of Vishnu on it, and a self-help CD she listened to, but didn&#x27;t buy, in the middle of HMV. She can be very overemotional and attention-seeking and is always telling dramatic stories about herself which seem unlikely, although when Sally challenges her about her claim to have been trapped in a photo booth for three hours Annie is easily able to provide photographic evidence.

She is constantly looking for a boyfriend and is prepared to go to extreme lengths to retain one (including dressing as the male police officer who directed the Fred West case). She seems to have the busiest sex life of anyone in the room but hasn&#x27;t managed to find love. Her choice of men is misguided. One married man she dated sent private photographs he took of her to a pornographic magazine; it is implied that Barry saw these pictures. She had a liaison with Clint at Lucy Wu&#x27;s party, which we learn about in Episode Three, and in Episode Five she buys him some chocolates for Valentine&#x27;s Day, but this appears to be a passing fancy. She flirts outrageously with Janet&#x27;s nephew, Dominic, in Episode Ten.

Annie is always sponging cigarettes, change for the drinks machine and food from the other characters, occasionally using emotional blackmail to increase her chances of success. She is prepared to eat almost anything, including a half-eaten salad dusted with cigarette ash and a mauled unwrapped Toffo. Despite the fact that she smokes somebody&#x27;s cigarettes in every episode, usually Sally&#x27;s, she doesn&#x27;t regard herself as a smoker.

She considers herself to be an artist and, although she says that she became a graphic designer because she likes designing posters, she finds her job unfulfilling. In Episode Ten she arrives with a collection of homemade ashtrays which she tries to sell to her colleagues, despite the fact that the paint is highly flammable.

===Barry (Jeremy Swift)===

Barry is divorced and approaching 40. He is neurotic and obsessive (to the point of hoarding used matches), suffering from many phobias some verging on the ridiculous, although he is oddly unfazed by a real crisis. He seems bumbling and insecure, though his portrait from 1987 shows him as somewhat fashionable and confident. We learn that he joined the company as a graduate of Oxford Polytechnic and that Sharon was his secretary. They had a tentative romance which foundered when Barry got the venue of a date wrong; it takes them twenty years to discuss the misunderstanding. Sharon and Barry remain barbed and confrontational with each other.

Barry blames circumstance and others for his lack of career progression, but there is evidence he is not very attentive to his job. He dislikes children – including his own nieces – and family life in general, and makes little attempt to hide this. He has nothing good to say about his first wife, Pamela, and whenever we hear of his attempts to seduce other women they are always failures.

Barry is usually seen attempting to solve the day&#x27;s crossword, and although he considers himself something of a crossword expert his answers are often ludicrous and Robin solves many of the (sometimes very easy) clues for him.

===Clint (Fraser Ayres)===

Clint is the 23-year-old maintenance man. Although he genuinely loves his job, which he considers to be the most important one in the company, he spends most of his time thinking about other things, like whether or not dogs who have jobs get jealous of pets.

He has a very relaxed approach to life, even to the point of suspending his attempt to repair a lift full of people in order to smoke a roll-up. He doesn&#x27;t seem to be much good at his job when he does get around to it. He has a tendency to lose ladders, one of which trips up and nearly kills someone. We also learn that his neglect of a loose floor tile in the smoking room has put one of his colleagues into a coma. He is constantly thwarted in his attempts to fix the drinks machine and has consequently become highly emotional in his dealings with it. On one occasion it is fixed easily by Monique by removing a squashed cup from the mechanism.

He often uses street slang and does an Ali G-style &#x27;snap&#x27; when something amuses or impresses him. He is a fan of conspiracy theories as well as admitting to smoking marijuana.

He is generally concerned for the other characters&#x27; well-being, often telling them to &#x27;chill&#x27; or hugging them when something bad happens. He is the friendliest towards Sharon of all the smokers, even calling her &#x27;Shazza&#x27;. He tends to see the good in everyone, to the extent that he was once sexually molested in a park and believed the man&#x27;s story that he was holding his penis in order to tell his fortune.

Clint slept with Annie once, sent Lucy Wu into spasms by kissing her, and his biggest ambition is to have a threesome before he is 25. He seems to later be dating Lucy Wu for most of the second series, and she has a pregnancy scare, where it is revealed that Clint&#x27;s father ran away when he was born. We don&#x27;t know if Clint stays with Lucy after the scare.

===Gordon (Mike Walling)===

Gordon debuts in episode six and features in a further four episodes. Initially a non-smoker who never knew the smoking room existed (even though he&#x27;s worked for the company for about twenty years) he is an unwelcome and disliked colleague prone to be lecherous, aggressive, insecure and overly-ambitious. Gordon&#x27;s unpopularity is exemplified when his health takes a turn for the worse in the penultimate episode and his colleagues generally react with indifference, self-interest and a dithering lack of concern, as demonstrated by Sally; &quot;God knows what we&#x27;d do in a &quot;real&quot; emergency&quot;.

===Heidi (Emma Kennedy)===

Heidi debuts in episode five, when she returns from maternity leave. She is 35, married to Keith (previously married and somewhat older at 58; she virtually worships him) and mother to baby Dane (about whom she obsesses).

Heidi is very &#x27;mumsy&#x27; and constantly refers to her seemingly idyllic domestic situation, to the near-universal annoyance of the other characters. It is clear that her home life is not as perfect as she believes. She repeats highly critical comments Keith has made about her as though they were kindly although she occasionally seems doubtful about his more extreme political views. He hates foreigners, is homophobic, thinks the police should be armed with laser guns that can paralyse and believes Heidi is more than enough female influence for his son. He also encourages Heidi to act out his bizarre sexual fantasies to make their sex life more interesting for himself.

Heidi is a non-smoker and her visits to the smoking room are motivated by her desire to tell everyone about the latest developments in her life, yet she takes very little interest in anyone else&#x27;s, often having a smug, patronising air about her when she does interact in conversations with the others. However, she is desperate for friends and in episode ten we learn that her imaginary friend, Buttercup, was cruel to her and soon went off to be imaginary friends with another child. Heidi didn&#x27;t have the imagination to invent another one. This early disappointment might explain why she is oblivious to the rudeness of others and why she is determined to have company at any cost.

In episode seventeen, she reveals that she is pregnant with her second child, to the slight annoyance of Janet (because it overshadowed her announcement of her engagement) and Sharon (because of her maternity rights), although the other characters express their joy at her news when they realise it will mean another lengthy maternity absence.

===Janet (Selina Griffiths)===

Janet is 34 and the personal assistant to Sharon. She is very prudish, dresses old for her age, rarely swears and does not smoke. Once she takes a drag of Robin&#x27;s cigarette, only to immediately extinguish it in a cup of coffee, thereby depriving Robin and Clint of their only means of ignition. She is constantly put-upon by Sharon and is terrified of her (although she occasionally tries to stand up for herself). She normally enters the smoking room on company-related matters such as to inform the occupants of Sharon&#x27;s latest diktat.

She takes a very dim view of some of the other characters&#x27; slacking, herself being very diligent and obedient. However, she is not really interested in climbing the career ladder, her stated goal being, &#x27;...to find a nice man, and settle down&#x27;.

Little is mentioned of her love life; in episode six, she says that she has a date and is reluctant to go out into the driving rain and fetch Sharon&#x27;s lunch in case it messes up her new hairdo. She later mentions having met a new man at church, followed by her sudden announcement of her engagement to boyfriend Noel.

She is very fond of her family, who include an aunt who suffered from a cerebral aneurysm, a sister, Nicola, an epileptic brother, Stuart, and her nephew Dominic, whom we meet in episode ten. We also learn that Janet was a &#x27;late baby&#x27; whose mother always told her she was a &#x27;mistake&#x27;.

===Len (Leslie Schofield)===

Len is a security guard, is 59 and is widowed. He used to be in the armed forces, although it isn&#x27;t specified which branch, and only took his current job because of the points on his driving licence which meant he couldn&#x27;t become a taxi driver. He has a cantankerous personality but is soft beneath the gruff exterior. He has a strange love for the works of Walt Disney, being overjoyed at the thought of holidaying in Walt Disney World in episode seven, although he isn&#x27;t keen on Minnie Mouse, whom he describes as &#x27;that bitch&#x27;. He is also afraid of ducks, claiming he accidentally provoked one into &quot;biting&quot; him on the face.

He raised his two sons on his own following the early death of his beloved wife, Diana, and is very fond of his grandsons. He remains devoted to Diana&#x27;s memory. He mentions her whenever he can and never shows any interest in other women. In episode twelve we learn that her death hit him so hard that the only thing which could cheer him up was to get a perm. He can be soft and caring to the others on occasion too. He is the one who hurries to comfort Annie when she is crying in episode two and is the only one who is concerned that Lilian should enjoy her birthday in episode eight. He and Lilian have a good friendship, having worked together for so long, but there is never any suggestion of romance between them.

Len swears constantly, even in the middle of words. The other smokers tolerate his quirks, not even batting an eye when he becomes high on glue and hallucinates in episode ten. Janet is the only one to comment on his constant swearing, which offends her prim nature – although on the one occasion when she&#x27;s driven to strong language, in Episode Nine, he is quick to criticise her for it.

Len can be extremely gullible; for example, he fails to realise that his superior Ranjit is stealing from him and is happy to accept Ranjit&#x27;s outrageous explanations of how his property keeps disappearing. On the other hand, he can be very incisive and worldly-wise, such as in Episode Two when he muses about the brevity of life. Age is becoming a source of concern for him. He is upset to see a picture of his younger self in episode twelve and complains that he is now falling apart.

===Lilian (Paula Wilcox)===

Lilian is 53 and divorced. Her ex-husband, Greg, was an alcoholic and there are suggestions that their marriage was unhappy. She thinks her terrible taste in men means she has a lot in common with Whitney Houston (with whom Lilian shares a birthday). It is explained she spent much of the eighties as a dowdy, overweight mum who put all her energy into raising her daughters (Laura and Julia) and forgot about herself. She lives alone and since her divorce is enjoying a new lease of life. When she agrees to appear in the firm&#x27;s Christmas pantomime, she chooses to sing Cher&#x27;s &quot;Believe&quot; and this could easily be her motto.

Lilian dresses young and revealingly and is quite unreserved, fun-loving, optimistic and outspoken. She seems keen to find a man and will seize on virtually any suitable target. She is always bubbly and happy on the surface but this seems to mask a real sadness which she sometimes lets show, like when she admits she doesn&#x27;t like living alone.

She is a confirmed smoker, which is illustrated by her attempt to obtain an un-stubbed-out cigarette from the street outside and her near-revulsion when she thinks that Barry is giving up. At the Cigzowt conference, designed to help the smokers quit, she tells how cigarettes have supported her through all the highs and lows in her life and have been her only constant companion. Sadly, the fact that she smokes wrecks any chance of a new romance with the Cigzowt representative, Derek.

===Robin (Robert Webb)===

Robin is the closest to the series&#x27; central character and is present in the smoking room for almost all of every episode. He is in his early thirties. His job is never specified but he says he works in an office on his own, which he describes as &#x27;solitary confinement&#x27; and that his tasks include filing old photographs for the company brochure. He attempts to give Sharon the impression he is hard-working, usually stubbing out his cigarette and making for the door whenever she enters. He is obviously intelligent although not particularly ambitious. He is generally cynical and a little melancholy. The happiest we usually see him is when he encounters or talks about Ben from the Post Room.

His sexuality and attitude towards Ben (from the Post Room) is the subject of an ongoing story thread. There are many hints that Robin is gay and infatuated with Ben, but no outright admission on his part. Robin seems uncomfortable with his sexuality and is keen for everyone to know that the temp, Miranda, was once his girlfriend. The truth is finally discussed openly in the final episode, where it is apparent all his fellow smokers long realised Robin was gay (apart from Barry, who doesn&#x27;t understand how Robin can be gay when he&#x27;s &#x27;so good at crosswords&#x27;) and had no problem with it. He misses out on a chance with Ben who it turns out is gay too but has a new boyfriend by the time Robin comes out.

===Sally (Nadine Marshall)===

Sally is 27 and works in the graphics department with Annie. She claims to be Annie&#x27;s best friend (and constantly beckons Annie with the phrase, &quot;Come on, missus...&quot;), although this statement may have been motivated by Annie having just won two tickets to &#x27;DanceFest UK&#x27;. Normally, her relationship with Annie is bitchy and competitive. She often gossips about Annie behind her back, but she will always reluctantly provide a shoulder for Annie to cry on. She seems to have the liveliest social life of all the smokers. She has a very bad hangover when we first meet her in Episode One and in Episode Eleven, when everyone is snowed in after work, is so determined to drink the bottle of vodka she has bought that she mixes it with the only thing available, a jar of pasta sauce. Despite her smoking and drinking, she is health conscious, being a vegetarian (why she could never eat human flesh) and a devotee of &#x27;boxercise&#x27;.

She has little time for the nonsense the others talk, particularly Annie&#x27;s new age interests. She quickly realises the truth behind Robin&#x27;s preoccupation with Ben.

Sally tends to speak her mind and isn&#x27;t afraid of offending people. As a little girl she claims she punched the glove puppet Spit the dog in the face at a Christmas pantomime, breaking Bob Carolgees&#x27; hand, because he dared to ask her name. She also says that one man who criticised her had his tyres slashed, although she quickly, and unconvincingly, qualifies that &quot;she&quot; didn&#x27;t slash them. She can be thoughtful at times, once agreeing to go to the pub with a lonely Janet, even though they have nothing in common, rather than disappoint her.

===Sharon (Siobhan Redmond)===

Sharon is the head of the branch, having worked her way up from being secretary, although she remains answerable to Head Office. Sharon is a cold, condescending, ladder-climbing career woman. She rates herself very highly and virtually everyone else as slacking, inadequate minions. Although a smoker, she spends much less time in the smoking room due to her attitude to work; the other characters feel nervous and intimidated whenever she enters. She constantly bullies Janet and relies on her for almost everything. She also appears to be unable to understand basic social behaviour, remarking once &#x27;Why are there jokes? [Do they] make you feel happy and productive?&#x27;

Sharon has probably achieved her position more from her tenacity, forceful personality and compatibility with management culture than her actual ability. For example, in episode two, she makes some shocking assumptions about the poorly written words in Martin&#x27;s letter thanking the company for his retirement party, insisting the word &#x27;party&#x27; is &#x27;pasty&#x27;. She is obviously focused and ambitious. It is only when photographs from the company brochure of 1987 are found that we learn that she joined the firm as Barry&#x27;s secretary. They were firm friends then, according to Barry, but Sharon insists it was only because the other workers all were freaks. They even went on what sounds like a date to Kew Gardens but Barry bungled the follow-up, waiting at West Ham tube station while Sharon waited, correctly, at West Hampstead. It is suggested that, in those early days, there might have been a chance of romance for the pair but the misunderstanding was never broached and now there is only antagonism.

In episode nine we learn that most of her family are dead. Sharon now lives alone with a cat, which she hasn&#x27;t bothered to name and to which she only speaks to tell it to get off the sofa. Her cold exterior melts only once, when she is passionately kissed by a kissogram who is taking a break in the smoking room after visiting the woman he is actually there to see. She disappears &#x27;stage left&#x27; after him, with Janet remarking, &quot;That&#x27;s not love – that&#x27;s pure naked lust!&quot;

===Monique Coyne (Sunetra Sarker)===

A career driven, dynamic woman whose only vice seemed to be smoking. She was introduced in episode one as an external candidate for manager, in competition with Barry. Monique was chosen over Barry and was shown to be good at &#x27;the game,&#x27; interacting with Sharon seemingly as equals. Her aptitude frightened Barry when she fixed the coffee machine following Clint&#x27;s failed attempt.

Monique&#x27;s only other appearance was in episode eight at Lilian&#x27;s birthday party, where she confused and was condescending to Barry. In the final episode, Monique is mentioned to have been poached and leaving for another firm in New York, which only confirms Barry&#x27;s suspicions that she was a disloyal ladder-climber.

Monique would not be considered a main character as she only appeared physically in two episodes. However, she could not be classified as &#x27;unseen,&#x27; therefore existing as one of the rare characters in the series to appear more than once, yet not belonging to the core ten actors.

==Unseen characters==
The series frequently derives humour from references to unseen characters, partly due to its single location structure:

===Ben &#x27;from the Post Room&#x27;===
The unwitting object of Robin&#x27;s lust who, in Robin&#x27;s eyes, is clearly a closeted gay man, despite having a girlfriend (later his fiancée). A running joke is made of the fact that his face is never seen on screen (e.g. his appearance in a snowman costume, and Lilian accidentally cutting his head off in a photograph), although his voice is heard once, when he is played by series writer Brian Dooley. It is revealed in the final episode that Robin&#x27;s suspicions were correct; however, Ben was fooled by Robin&#x27;s over-compensation, and believes him to be homophobic.

===Tess Pownall===
Lilian&#x27;s co-worker and close friend. She is recently widowed but does not seem overly upset by this, planning a holiday with Lilian and even organising a disco and bouncy castle for her husband&#x27;s wake, though later admitting that this was a mistake. Whilst on holiday with Lilian she insisted on sunbathing topless. However, in the photos Heidi questions why she is holding &quot;two wizened yams&quot;.

===Lucy Wu===
A girl whose provocative dancing at the office party attracts Clint (despite the fact she was actually in anaphylaxis after accidentally eating a nut). She later has a pregnancy scare, and according to Heidi has already had at least one terminal illness.

===Martin===
Barry&#x27;s boss who retires in episode one, only to collapse with a fatal stroke in Asda the day after his leaving party. According to Lilian and Sally he was something of an office groper, leaving Annie offended that he never tried anything with her. He is also revealed to be the source of a large amount of pornographic emails clogging the company email system. Despite despising golf he was bought as set of clubs to mark the end of his 37 years at the company. His widow is called Pat, who mistook his stroke as being the result of an exceptionally cold freezer at Asda.

===Ranjit===
Len&#x27;s workshy boss. Despite being Head of Security, he frequently steals valuables from a clueless Len.

===Gerry Lyndop===
Gerry has a twitch. This developed after having to witness his wife being repeatedly mounted by a runaway horse.

===Keith===
Heidi&#x27;s husband, whom she appears to worship, despite his obvious cruelty towards her, such as telling her he was leaving her as an April fool and only revealing the truth when she lies down in front of the car to stop him going. He is racist, sexist and homophobic, but none of this seems to put Heidi off.

===Shreela===
An obese woman dubbed &quot;Shrinking Shreela&quot; after she falls foul of one of Clint&#x27;s botched repairs and ends up in a coma. Lilian comments on the irony, stating &quot;all those years at Weight Watchers... she doesn&#x27;t know she&#x27;s finally thin&quot;.

<doc id="1029998" wikidata="Q2489987" url="?curid=1029998" title="Jean MacArthur">
<text>Jean Marie MacArthur ( Faircloth; December 28, 1898 – January 22, 2000) was the second wife of U.S. Army General of the Army Douglas MacArthur.

== Early life and education ==
Born Jean Marie Faircloth in Nashville, Tennessee, she was the daughter of Edward C. Faircloth, a banker. After her parents divorced when she was eight, her mother took her to live with her grandparents in Murfreesboro. Her grandfather, a former captain in the Confederate army, instilled in her a love of uniforms. She attended Ward-Belmont College in Nashville, but graduated from Soule College in Murfreesboro. Jean and her father can be found later listed on a passenger manifest of the , which arrived in the Port of Los Angeles on December 29, 1927, from Balboa, Panama Canal Zone. When her father died, she inherited a large fortune and travelled extensively.

== Marriage ==
On a trip she intended to be to Shanghai, in 1935, she met General MacArthur aboard the , which was to stop first in Manila, where MacArthur would disembark. Despite the age difference — she was nearly nineteen years younger than he — they began a permanent relationship in Manila, and married in New York City on April 30, 1937, during Gen. MacArthur&#x27;s trip home to build support for the defense of the Philippines. This was to be Gen. MacArthur&#x27;s last trip to the mainland United States for the next 14 years, when he was relieved from duty by President Truman. His only other visits to U.S. soil between 1937 and 1951 were a 1944 strategy meeting in Honolulu, Hawaii with President Roosevelt and Admiral Nimitz and a 1950 meeting with President Truman on Wake Island.

Jean was MacArthur&#x27;s second wife and he described her as his &quot;constant friend, sweetheart, and devoted support.&quot; They had one son, Arthur MacArthur IV (1938–), and were married until Douglas&#x27; death in 1964.

== Wartime ==
Jean MacArthur was with her husband when the Japanese attacked the Philippines and went with him to the island of Corregidor in Manila&#x27;s harbor. Even when the island was attacked, she refused to leave her husband. Only when President Roosevelt ordered the MacArthurs to leave they went to Australia.

== Charity work ==
After her husband&#x27;s death she helped with the Metropolitan Opera and other charities. In her later years, she often gave speeches on her late husband&#x27;s military career. President Ronald Reagan awarded her the Medal of Freedom in 1988 and the Philippine government gave her its Legion of Merit in 1993.

== Death ==
Mrs. MacArthur died of natural causes in Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan at age 101. She is entombed with her husband in the rotunda of the MacArthur Memorial in Norfolk, Virginia, the hometown of Gen. MacArthur&#x27;s mother.

<doc id="1030000" wikidata="Q2558308" url="?curid=1030000" title="Chapbook">
<text>A chapbook is a type of small printed booklet that was a popular medium for street literature throughout early modern Europe. Chapbooks were usually produced cheaply, illustrated with crude woodcuts and printed on a single sheet folded into 8, 12, 16, or 24 pages, sometimes bound with a saddle stitch. Printers provided chapbooks on credit to chapmen, who sold them both from door to door and at markets and fairs, then paying for the stock they sold. The tradition of chapbooks emerged during the 16th century as printed books were becoming affordable, with the medium ultimately reaching its height of popularity during the 17th and 18th centuries. Various ephemera and popular or folk literature were published as chapbooks, such as almanacs, children&#x27;s literature, folklore, ballads, nursery rhymes, pamphlets, poetry, and political and religious tracts. The term &quot;chapbook&quot; remains in use by publishers to refer to short, inexpensive booklets.

==Terminology==
&quot;Chapbook&quot; is first attested in English in 1824, and seemingly derives from &quot;chapman&quot;, the word for the itinerant salesmen who would sell such books. The first element of &quot;chapman&quot; comes in turn from Old English &#x27;barter&#x27;, &#x27;business&#x27;, &#x27;dealing&#x27;, from which the modern adjective &quot;cheap&quot; was ultimately derived.

Chapbooks correspond to Spanish Cordel literature, and to French &#x27;blue library&#x27; literature, because they were often wrapped in cheap blue paper that was usually reserved as a wrapping for sugar. Chapbooks are called &#x27;people&#x27;s book&#x27; in German, and as &#x27;loose sheets&#x27; in Spanish, with the latter name referring to their method of assembly. &quot;Lubok&quot; books are the Russian equivalent.

==History==

Broadside ballads were popular songs, sold for a penny or halfpenny in the streets of towns and villages around Britain between the 16th and the early 20th centuries. They preceded chapbooks but had similar content, marketing, and distribution systems. There are records from Cambridgeshire as early as in 1553 of a man offering a scurrilous ballad &quot;maistres mass&quot; at an alehouse, and a pedlar selling &quot;lytle books&quot; to people, including a patcher of old clothes in 1578. These sales are probably characteristic of the market for chapbooks.

The form factor originated in Britain, but was also used in North America. Chapbooks gradually disappeared from the mid-19th century in the face of competition from cheap newspapers and, especially in Scotland, from tract societies that regarded them as ungodly.

Chapbooks were generally aimed at buyers who did not maintain libraries, and due to their flimsy construction they rarely survive as individual items. In an era when paper was expensive, chapbooks were sometimes used for wrapping, baking, or as toilet paper. Many of the surviving chapbooks come from the collections of Samuel Pepys between 1661 and 1688 which are now held at Magdalene College, Cambridge. The antiquary Anthony Wood also collected 65 chapbooks, including 20 from before 1660, which are now in the Bodleian Library. There are also significant Scottish collections, such as those held by the University of Glasgow and the National Library of Scotland.

Modern collectors such as Peter Opie, have chiefly a scholarly interest in the form. Modern small literary presses, such as Louffa Press, Black Lawrence Press and Ugly Duckling Presse, continue to issue several small editions of chapbooks a year, updated in technique and materials, often to high fabrication standards, such as letterpress.

==Production and distribution==
Chapbooks were cheap, anonymous publications that were the usual reading material for lower-class people who could not afford books. Members of the upper classes occasionally owned chapbooks, and sometimes bound them in leather. Printers typically tailored their texts for the popular market. Chapbooks were usually between four and twenty-four pages long, and produced on rough paper with crude, frequently recycled, woodcut illustrations. Millions of chapbooks were sold each year. After 1696, English chapbook peddlers had to be licensed, and 2,500 of them were then authorized, 500 in London alone. In France, there were 3,500 licensed colporteurs by 1848, and they sold 40 million books annually.

The centre of the chapbook and ballad production was London, and until the Great Fire of London in 1666 the printers were based around London Bridge. However, a feature of chapbooks is the proliferation of provincial printers, especially in Scotland and Newcastle upon Tyne. The first Scottish publication was the tale of &quot;Tom Thumb,&quot; in 1682.

==Content==

Chapbooks were an important medium for the dissemination of popular culture to the common people, especially in rural areas. They were a medium of entertainment and information. Though the content of chapbooks has been criticized as unsophisticated narratives which were heavily loaded with repetition and emphasized adventure through mostly anecdotal structures, they are valued as a record of popular culture, preserving cultural artefacts that may not survive in any other form.

Chapbooks were priced for sales to workers, although their market was not limited to the working classes. Broadside ballads were sold for a halfpenny, or a few pence. Prices of chapbooks were from 2d. to 6d., when agricultural labourers&#x27; wages were 12d. per day. The literacy rate in England in the 1640s was around 30 percent for males and rose to 60 percent in the mid-18th century. Many working people were readers, if not writers, and pre-industrial working patterns provided periods during which they could read. 

Chapbooks were used for reading to family groups or groups in alehouses. They contributed to the development of literacy, and there is evidence of their use by autodidacts. In the 1660s, as many as 400,000 almanacs were printed annually, enough for one family in three in England. One 17th-century publisher of chapbooks in London stocked one book for every 15 families in the country. In the 1520s the Oxford bookseller John Dorne noted in his day-book selling up to 190 ballads a day at a halfpenny each. The probate inventory of the stock of Charles Tias, of &quot;The sign of the Three Bibles&quot; on London Bridge, in 1664 included books and printed sheets to make approximately 90,000 chapbooks (including 400 reams of paper) and 37,500 ballad sheets. This was not regarded as an outstanding figure in the trade. The inventory of Josiah Blare, of &quot;The Sign of the Looking Glass&quot; on London Bridge, in 1707 listed 31,000 books, plus 257 reams of printed sheets. A conservative estimate of sales in Scotland alone in the second half of the 18th century was over 200,000 per year.

Printers provided chapbooks on credit to chapmen, who sold them both from door to door and at markets and fairs, then paying for the stock they sold. This facilitated wide distribution and large sales with minimum outlay, and also provided the printers with feedback about what titles were most popular. Popular works were reprinted, pirated, edited, and produced in different editions.

Publishers also issued catalogues, and chapbooks are found in the libraries of provincial yeomen and gentry. John Whiting, a Quaker yeoman imprisoned at Ilchester, Somerset, in the 1680s had books sent by carrier from London, and left for him at an inn.

Samuel Pepys had a collection of ballads bound into volumes, under the following classifications, into which could fit the subject matter of most chapbooks: 
# Devotion and Morality
# History – true and fabulous
# Tragedy: viz. Murders, executions, and judgments of God
# State and Times
# Love – pleasant
# Ditto – unpleasant
# Marriage, Cuckoldry, &amp;c.
# Sea – love, gallantry &amp; actions
# Drinking and good fellowship
# Humour, frollicks and mixt.

Stories in many chapbooks have much earlier origins. &quot;Bevis of Hampton&quot; was an Anglo-Norman romance of the 13th century, which probably drew on earlier themes. The structure of &quot;The Seven Sages of Rome&quot; was of Eastern origin, and was used by Geoffrey Chaucer. Many jests about ignorant and greedy clergy in chapbooks were taken from &quot;The Friar and the Boy&quot; printed about 1500 by Wynkyn de Worde, and &quot;The Sackfull of News&quot; (1557).

Historical stories set in a mythical and fantastical past were popular, while many significant historical figures and events appear rarely or not at all: in the Pepys collection, Charles I, and Oliver Cromwell do not appear as historical figures, The Wars of the Roses and the English Civil War do not appear at all, Elizabeth I appears only once, and Henry VIII and Henry II appear in disguise, with cobblers and millers and then inviting them to court and rewarding them. There was a pattern of high born heroes overcoming reduced circumstances by valour, such as Saint George, Guy of Warwick, Robin Hood, and heroes of low birth who achieve status through force of arms, such as Clim of Clough, and William of Cloudesley. Clergy often appear as figures of fun, and foolish countrymen were also popular (e.g., &quot;The Wise Men of Gotham&quot;). Other works were aimed at regional and rural audience (e.g., &quot;The Country Mouse and the Town Mouse&quot;).

From 1597, works were published that were aimed at specific trades, such as cloth merchants, weavers and shoemakers. The latter were commonly literate. Thomas Deloney, a weaver, wrote &quot;Thomas of Reading&quot;, about six clothiers from Reading, Gloucester, Worcester, Exeter, Salisbury and Southampton, traveling together and meeting at Basingstoke their fellows from Kendal, Manchester and Halifax. In his &quot;Jack of Newbury&quot;, set during Henry VIII&#x27;s reign, an apprentice to a broadcloth weaver takes over his business and marries his widow on his death. On achieving success, he is liberal to the poor and refuses a knighthood for his substantial services to the king.

Other examples from the Pepys collection include &quot;The Countryman&#x27;s Counsellor, or Everyman his own Lawyer&quot;, and &quot;Sports and Pastimes&quot;, written for schoolboys, including magic tricks, like how to &quot;fetch a shilling out of a handkerchief&quot;, write invisibly, make roses out of paper, snare wild duck, and make a maid-servant fart uncontrollably.

The provinces and Scotland had their own local heroes. Robert Burns commented that one of the first two books he read in private was &quot;the history of Sir William Wallace ... poured a Scottish prejudice in my veins which will boil along there till the flood-gates of life shut in eternal rest&quot;.

==Influence==
Chapbooks had a wide and continuing influence. Eighty percent of English folk songs collected by early-20th-century collectors have been linked to printed broadsides, including over 90 of which could only be derived from those printed before 1700. It has been suggested the majority of surviving ballads can be traced to 1550–1600 by internal evidence.

One of the most popular and influential chapbooks was Richard Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Seven Champions of Christendom&quot; (1596), believed to be the source for the introduction of Saint George into English folk plays.

Robert Greene&#x27;s 1588 novel &quot;Dorastus and Fawnia&quot;, the basis of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;, was still being published in cheap editions in the 1680s. Some stories were still being published in the 19th century, (e.g., &quot;Jack of Newbury&quot;, &quot;Friar Bacon&quot;, &quot;Dr Faustus&quot; and &quot;The Seven Champions of Christendom&quot;).

==Later production==

&quot;Chapbook&quot; is also a term currently used to denote publications of up to about 40 pages, usually poetry bound with some form of saddle stitch, though many are perfect bound, folded, or wrapped. These publications range from low-cost productions to finely produced, hand-made editions that may sell to collectors for hundreds of dollars. More recently, the popularity of fiction and non-fiction chapbooks has also increased. In the UK they are more often referred to as pamphlets.

The genre has been revitalized in the past 40 years by the widespread availability of first mimeograph technology, then low-cost copy centres and digital printing, and by the cultural revolutions spurred by both zines and poetry slams, the latter generating hundreds upon hundreds of self-published chapbooks that are used to fund tours. The Center for the Humanities at the City University of New York Graduate Center has held the NYC/CUNY Chapbook Festival, focused on &quot;the chapbook as a work of art, and as a medium for alternative and emerging writers and publishers&quot;.

<doc id="1030012" wikidata="Q267259" url="?curid=1030012" title="LaTasha Colander">
<text>LaTasha Colander (born August 23, 1976, in Portsmouth, Virginia) is a retired track and field sprinter who competed internationally for the United States. In 1994, on athletic scholarship, Colander enrolled at, and later graduated from, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

In 1994, in the 100 m hurdles, Colander was the USA Juniors champion, and placed second in the World Junior Champs. Yet soon, she switched to sprints. In 2000 and 2001, she was the U.S. champion in the 400 m. In April 2000, her team set the women&#x27;s world record in the 4 × 200 m relay, a record standing over 15 years onward.

In the 2000 Olympics, Colander won a gold medal in the 4 × 400 m relay. Upon her teammate Marion Jones&#x27;s 2007 admission of illegal doping, the International Olympic Committee stripped the whole team&#x27;s medals; in 2010, however, by a successful appeal, all team members except Jones had their medals restored.

Colander missed the 2001 World Championships because of a quadriceps injury. In 2003, she switched concentration to the 100 m, and won the 2004 US Olympic Trials in this shorter event. At the 2005 World Championships, she placed fifth in the 200 meters.

In 2000, Colander had established the LC Treasures Within Foundation, its mission to strengthen kids, families, and the world through education, sports, and spirituality.

In 2014, Colander was inducted into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame.

<text>Ascot () is a town in the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead in Berkshire, England. It is south of Windsor, east of Bracknell and west of London.

It is most notable as the location of Ascot Racecourse, home of the Royal Ascot meeting. Its average house price of £1,019,451 as of June 2021 makes it the 13th most expensive town in England. It is also among the ten most expensive towns in Britain to rent a property. The town comprises three areas: Ascot itself, North Ascot and South Ascot. It is in the civil parish of Sunninghill and Ascot.

==Etymology==
The name &#x27;Ascot&#x27; derives from the Old English (east) and (cottage). Ascott in Buckinghamshire, Eastcote in London and Eastcott in Wiltshire have the same etymology.

==Governance==
Ascot is in the district administered by the unitary authority of the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead. Ascot, South Ascot and a small part of North Ascot are in the civil parish of Sunninghill and Ascot, although most of North Ascot is in the civil parish of Winkfield.

==Churches==
===Church of England===
The Church of England parish church of All Saints, Ascot Heath is a red-brick Gothic Revival building designed by Thomas Rushforth and built in 1864. It has a richly decorated interior. The east window of its chancel is a Jesse window with stained glass made by C.E. Kempe &amp; Co in 1907. Above it is a rose window by Hardman &amp; Co. The Church of England parish church of All Souls, South Ascot is another red-brick Gothic Revival building. It was designed by John Loughborough Pearson and built in 1896–97. It has a central tower with a pyramidal roof. Its nave has aisles of four bays. The ceilings of the chancel, baptistry and the crossing under the tower are rib vaulted. All Souls&#x27; is a Grade II* listed building. Ascot Priory was founded in 1861 for the Society of the Most Holy Trinity. It has buildings designed by the architects Charles Buckeridge, William Butterfield, George Gilbert Scott and Leonard Stokes.

===Roman Catholic===
The Roman Catholic church of St Francis is also a red-brick Gothic Revival building. It was designed by the Roman Catholic priest and architect Alexander Scoles, built in 1889 and has an apsidal chancel.

==Local schools==
Independent senior schools in the area include Heathfield School (an all-girls boarding school), The Marist School (a private Catholic girls school 2–18 with mixed nursery), St George&#x27;s School (a private girls senior school recently attended by Princess Beatrice of York), St Mary&#x27;s School, a Catholic all-girls boarding school (which Princess Caroline of Monaco attended), located in South Ascot and LVS Ascot, which is located down the road from Ascot Racecourse. Papplewick is also based in Ascot. The local state secondary school in the Ascot area is Charters School in nearby Sunningdale.

==Amenities==
Facilities tend to be geared towards the racecourse, but there is a small range of shops in the wide High Street. Most of the expected facilities one would expect to find in a small town are here, including a supermarket, petrol station and many cafes, a Subway, Tesco Express and Sainsbury&#x27;s Local). Most buildings are post-war with flats above the ground floor retail space. Heatherwood Hospital (filming location for &quot;Carry On Matron&quot;) was at the western edge of the town. Ascot station is on a junction of the railway line from London Waterloo to Reading, Bagshot, Aldershot and Guildford, originally built by the London and South Western Railway and now operated by South Western Railway. As a consequence of the frequent service on this line, Ascot is now a commuter centre in both directions (westwards to Reading and eastwards to London).

==Royal Ascot week==
The centrepiece of Ascot&#x27;s year is held in June: Royal Ascot is arguably the world&#x27;s most famous race meeting, dating back to 1711. The British royal family attend the meeting, arriving each day in a procession of horse-drawn carriages from Windsor Castle through Windsor Great Park and the village of Cheapside. It is a major event in the British social calendar. The course is still owned by the Crown.

==Economy==
Ascot Racecourse employs over 70 full-time staff, which increases temporarily to 6,000 during Royal Ascot week. The village has a variety of businesses located at the Ascot Business Park, opened in 2008, including the UK headquarters of global toy manufacturer Jakks Pacific, in addition to numerous small and medium enterprises. The Chartered Institute of Building, a professional body for those working in the construction industry and built environment, is also based in Ascot.

==Sport and leisure==
Ascot has a non-League football club, Ascot United F.C., and the Royal Ascot Cricket Club which play at the racecourse. Royal Ascot Golf Club is located next to the racecourse.

==Army Cadet Force==
Ascot has an Army Cadet Force unit: 4 Platoon Ascot. The unit, being badged as Irish Guards (due to the unit belonging to A Company, Berkshire ACF; the company currently badged to the Household Division), means that the unit regularly sees Irish Guards events such as the Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day Parade, and even has the privilege of taking part in an Irish Guards ACF skills competition, run by the battalion. It actively recruits from the local and surrounding area. The unit used to parade at Ascot Racecourse, however, they were evicted due to an appeal made by the racecourse owners. They now temporarily parade at Sunningdale Parish Hall, Broomhill Lane.

<doc id="1030025" wikidata="Q474102" url="?curid=1030025" title="Night Driver (video game)">
<text>Night Driver is an arcade video game developed by Atari, Inc. and released in the United States in October 1976. It&#x27;s one of the earliest first-person racing video games and is commonly believed to be one of the first published video games to feature real-time first-person graphics. &quot;Night Driver&quot; has a black and white display with the hood of the player&#x27;s car painted on a plastic overlay. The road is rendered as scaled rectangles representing &quot;pylons&quot; that line the edges.

Two arcade cabinet styles were manufactured: upright and sit-down. The upright version has a blacklight installed inside the cabinet which illuminated the bezel.

Atari published a color version for the Atari Video Computer System in 1980.

==Gameplay==
The player controls a car which must be driven along a road at nighttime without crashing into the sides of the road as indicated by road side reflectors. The game is controlled with a single pedal for the accelerator, a wheel for steering and a four-selection lever for gear shifting. The coin-operated game had a choice of three difficulties (novice, pro and expert), which the player could select at game start. The turns were sharper and more frequent on the more difficult tracks. As play progresses, the road gets narrower and more winding.

The game length is 50, 75, 100 or 125 seconds based on an internal setting. After 300 points, a player is awarded bonus time equal to game time, but the score wraps around back to zero at 1000 points, so it is possible to reach 300 points more than once. Due to the additional points received for more difficult play, playing on the expert setting is actually the easiest to achieve extra time once a player has mastered the game.

The car the player is driving is not actually drawn in the game, but is printed on plastic insert in front of the monitor.

==Development==
When he began working on video games, Atari founder Nolan Bushnell had originally planned to develop a driving video game inspired by &quot;Speedway&quot; (1969), a first-person driving electro-mechanical game manufactured by Chicago Coin, in turn a licensed version of Kasco&#x27;s &quot;Indy 500&quot; (1968). However, Bushnell had concerns that a driving video game might be too complicated for Al Alcorn&#x27;s first game, so they instead decided to develop a simpler game, &quot;Pong&quot; (1972). &quot;Night Driver&quot; has similarities to arcade driving electro-mechanical games, which had a scrolling road rather than a fixed view.

The development of &quot;Night Driver&quot; was led by Dave Shepperd at Atari, who was given an assignment to develop a first-person driving video game. Shepperd said that he &quot;was given a piece of paper with a picture of a game cabinet that had a small portion of the screen visible&quot; which he recalls being possibly &quot;a German game&quot; but &quot;never saw the game play&quot; other than &quot;that there were a few little white squares showing&quot;. Shepperd used that concept to develop &quot;Night Driver&quot;. That the car is driving at night provided an excuse for the minimal graphics, as most features (like the street and buildings) aren&#x27;t visible in the dark. While he did not know the title of the German game at the time, it was later identified as the coin-op &quot;Nürburgring 1&quot;, a first-person driving video game released earlier in 1976.

Atari used some of the leftover arcade cabinets from &quot;Hi-way&quot; (1975), a top-down vertically scrolling racing game, for &quot;Night Driver&quot;.

==Release==
The arcade game began production in October 1976. Atari demonstrated the game at the AMOA show in November 1976, where it was one of several driving games demonstrated by Atari along with &quot;Sprint 2&quot; and Namco&#x27;s electro-mechanical &quot;F-1&quot;; the most talked-about driving game at the show was &quot;F-1&quot;. &quot;Night Driver&quot; also drew comparisons to Midway Manufacturing&#x27;s &quot;Midnight Racer&quot; (later re-branded &quot;Datsun 280 ZZZAP&quot;) at the same show and an earlier German night driving video game (&quot;Nürburgring 1&quot;) demonstrated at the German IMA show in Spring 1976.

===Ports===

Atari released a port for the Atari VCS (later renamed to the Atari 2600) in 1980. It was programmed by Rob Fulop, who added color, displaying the player vehicle, additional vehicles the player must avoid, and showing houses and trees along the sides of the road. The paddle controller steers the vehicle; holding the button accelerates. It is not possible to shift gears in this version. There are eight variations, some of which are timed and the player tries to score as much as they can in 90 seconds.

Commodore published a version for the Commodore 64 in 1982.

==Reception==
In Japan, it was the tenth highest-grossing arcade video game of 1976.

In the United States, according to &quot;Play Meter&quot; magazine, &quot;Night Driver&quot; was the sixth highest-earning arcade video game of 1977. According to &quot;RePlay&quot; magazine, it was the seventh highest-earning arcade video game of 1977. &quot;Play Meter&quot; later listed it as the ninth highest-grossing arcade game of 1978, and the eleventh highest arcade video game of 1979.

The Atari VCS version sold 161,352 copies in 1980, becoming one of the top five best-selling Atari VCS games that year, and went on to sell over 1.9 million copies by 1983. &quot;Video Games Player&quot; magazine reviewed the Atari VCS version, rating the graphics and sound a B, while giving the game an overall A− rating. In 1995, Flux magazine ranked the arcade version 59th on their &quot;Top 100 Video Games&quot; list.

==Legacy==

Two other first-person racing games were released shortly afterwards: Midway&#x27;s &quot;Midnight Racer&quot; in November 1976 (later branded as &quot;Datsun 280 ZZZAP&quot; in March 1977) and Micronetics&#x27; &quot;Night Racer&quot; in March 1977.

Bill Budge wrote a &quot;Night Driver&quot; clone for the Apple II using the same name as the original.

<text>Savatheda Fynes Coke (born October 17, 1974) is a track and field sprint athlete, competing internationally for Bahamas. She is an Olympic gold medalist in the 4 x 100 meter relay race. Some sources spell her first name &quot;Sevatheda&quot;.

==Career==

She graduated Physiology and Exercise Science at Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan, USA.
She missed the 2001 World Championships due to injury. She had a minor car accident prior to the 2000 Olympic trials, which limited her training. At the World Championships in 1999 she was eliminated in semifinals due to an injured hip flexor. In 1996 a hamstring injury kept her out of the 100m at the Atlanta Games.

She was a member of the Bahamas 4x100m relay team that won gold at the 1999 World Championships. After that performance the team of Fynes, Pauline Davis-Thompson, Debbie Ferguson, Chandra Sturrup and Eldece Clark-Lewis were dubbed the Golden Girls. When they won the relay again at the Sydney Olympics they showed the world why they had earned that name.
The girls returned home from Sydney to a six-day fanfare of festivities in their honor, from receptions and parades to monetary awards and land grants. Central Bank has even been commissioned to mint a commemorative gold coin to honour their victory.

She earned an athletic scholarship to Southern University at New Orleans, but later transferred to Eastern Michigan University and then to Michigan State University.

She was forced to sit out the 1996 season because she was a transfer. She attended an indoor meet that year and stayed in a hotel room paid for by Michigan State. That being a violation, she lost her final season of eligibility in 1998, and her coach lost her job.

==Coaching career==
In 2010, Fynes Coke worked as an assistant coach for the NJIT Highlanders track and field team.

<doc id="1030030" wikidata="Q651860" url="?curid=1030030" title="Embu das Artes">
<text>Embu das Artes, previously and commonly known simply as Embu, is a Brazilian municipality in the State of São Paulo. It is part of the Metropolitan Region of São Paulo. The population is 276,535 (2020 est.) in an area of 70.40 km2.

Its history brought it an unexpected specialization as a city for artists. This has paid tourism dividends to the city.

==History==
The history of Embu began in 1554, with the arrival of a group of Jesuits of the aldeamento or settlement of Bohi, later M&#x27;Boy, halfway between the sea and the São Paulo hinterlands. As the Jesuit missions in the interior of Brazil, the primary objective was to convert the native population to Roman Catholicism, in an attempt to use them as farm workers in the region.

In 1607 the lands of the village passed to the hands of Fernão Dias (uncle of the bandeirante Fernão Dias, the emerald hunter), In 1690, the priest Belchior de Pontes initiated the construction of the Igreja do Rosário (the Church of the Rosary), when it transferred at the same time to the nucleus of the original village. In 1760, by order of the Portuguese Crown, the Jesuits were expelled from Brazil because they interfered in colonist affairs, such as protecting converted natives from the Bandeiras, which sought to enslave them.

The artistic vocation of the city started to project itself in 1937, when Cássio M&#x27;Boy, &quot;santeiro&quot; – sculptor of religious images – in Embu, gained first prize at the Exposition Internationel d&#x27;Arts Techniques du Paris. Before that, Cássio had been the professor of some renowned artists and received illustrious representatives of the Modernismo movement of 1922, including Anita Malfatti, Tarsila do Amaral, Oswald de Andrade, Menotti Del Picchia, Volpi and Yoshio Takaoka.

One of Cássio M&#x27;Boy&#x27;s most successful disciples was Sakai de Embu, internationally known and one of the greatest Brazilian ceramist-sculptors. In 1962, Sakai formed the Solano Trindade group of plastic artists, highly influenced by African-Brazilian art and the religious tradition of the Yoruba orishahs. This group included Solano Trindade and later his daughter Raquel Trindade.

The artistic tradition of Embu is an institution with projects and events done both in Brazil and abroad since 1964. The Feira de Artes and Artesanato do Embu (&quot;Arts and Handicraft of Embu&quot;) was launched in the late 1960s and it has been attracting tourists and revenues to the city ever since.

One of the top Nazi torturers, Josef Mengele was buried in the Nossa Senhora do Rosario cemetery in Embu under his false identity, Wolfgang Gerhard, as the southern region of the city of São Paulo and its borders are known for a sizable German-Brazilian population.

== Media ==
In telecommunications, the city was served by Companhia Telefônica Brasileira until 1973, when it began to be served by Telecomunicações de São Paulo. In July 1998, this company was acquired by Telefónica, which adopted the Vivo brand in 2012.

The company is currently an operator of cell phones, fixed lines, internet (fiber optics/4G) and television (satellite and cable).

<doc id="1030038" wikidata="Q538082" url="?curid=1030038" title="Dasharatha Maurya">
<text>Dasharatha Maurya () was the 4th Mauryan emperor from 232 to 224 BCE. He was a grandson of Ashoka the Great and is commonly held to have succeeded him as the Emperor of Magadha. Dasharatha presided over a declining imperium and several territories of the empire broke away from central rule during his reign. He had continued the religious and social policies of Ashoka. Dasharatha was the last Mauryan emperor to have issued imperial inscriptions—thus the last Mauryan emperor to be known from epigraphical sources.

Dasharatha died in 224 BCE and was succeeded by his cousin Samprati.

==Background==
Dasharatha was a grandson of the Mauryan emperor Ashoka. He is commonly held to have succeeded his grandfather as Emperor of Magadha although some sources including the Vayu Purana have given different names and numbers of Maurya Emperors after Ashoka. Of the grandsons of Ashoka, the two most frequently mentioned are Samprati and Dasharatha. The latter is described in the Vishnu Purana as the son and imperial successor of Suyashas (a son of Ashoka). It has been suggested that Suyash was an alternative name of Ashoka&#x27;s son and presumptive heir Kunala.

==Administration==
Historians Vincent Smith and Romila Thapar advanced the popular theory of a division of the Mauryan Empire amongst Kunala and Dasharatha after the death of Ashoka. In some of the sources the division is recorded as having been between Samprati and Dasharatha, the latter holding the eastern parts with the capital at Pataliputra and the former the western imperium with the capital at Ujjain. However, Smith also wrote that &quot;there is no clear evidence to support [the] hypothesis.&quot;

The Vayu and Brahmanda Puranas mention three Mauryan rulers—Bandhupalita, Indrapalita and Dasona—whose identification is rather difficult. It has been suggested that they may have been members of a branch line of the Maurya dynasty whom Dasharatha had appointed as viceroys for the convenience of administration.

The political unity of the Mauryan Empire did not long survive Ashoka&#x27;s death. One of Dasharatha&#x27;s uncles, Jalauka, set up an independent kingdom in Kashmir. According to Taranatha, another Mauryan prince, Virasena declared himself king in Gandhara. Vidarbha also seceded. Evidence from Greek sources confirm the loss of the north-western provinces which was then ruled by the Mauryan ruler Sophagasenus (Subhagasena, probably a successor of Virasena). There is also much modern speculation about a possible east–west division of the empire involving Dasharatha and another Mauryan ruler. Epigraphic evidence indicates that Dasharatha retained imperial power in Magadha. 

Various dynasties of the south including the Satavahana had been vassals of the Mauryan Empire. These kingdoms are mentioned in Ashoka&#x27;s edicts (256 BCE) and were considered part of the outer circle of the imperium—subject to the rule of the Mauryan Emperor, although doubtless enjoying a considerable degree of autonomy under their local rulers. The death of Ashoka began the decline of imperial power in the south. Dasharatha was able to maintain some command of the home provinces, but the distant governments, including areas in the south, broke away from imperial rule and reasserted their independence. The Mahameghavahana dynasty of Kalinga in central-eastern India also broke away from imperial rule after the death of Ashoka.

According to a Jain text, the provinces of Saurashtra, Maharashtra, Andhra and Mysore broke away from the empire shortly after Ashoka&#x27;s death, but were reconquered by Dasharatha&#x27;s successor, Samprati (who supposedly deployed soldiers disguised as Jain monks).

==Religion==

Ashoka had displayed divine support in his inscriptions; although a Buddhist ruler, he was called Devanampriya, which means &quot;Beloved of the Gods&quot; in Pali. The title of Devanampiya and religious adherence of the Mauryan ruler to Buddhism was continued by Dasharatha.

Dasharatha is known to have dedicated three caves in the Nagarjuni Hills to the Ajivikas. Three inscriptions at the caves refer to him as &quot;Devanampiya&quot; and state that the caves were dedicated by him shortly after his accession.

===Nagarjuni caves inscriptions by Dasaratha Maurya===

Dasaratha Maurya, Ashoka&#x27;s grandson and regnal successor, wrote dedicatory inscriptions in the three forming the Nagarjuni group (Gopika, Vadathi and Vapiya caves) of the Barabar Caves. It is generally considered that their construction dates from his reign.

The three caves were offered to the Ajivikas upon the accession to the throne of Dasaratha, confirming that these were still active around 230 BCE, and that Buddhism was not the exclusive religion of the Mauryas at that time.

The three caves are also characterized by an extremely advanced finish of the granite walls inside, which again confirms that the technique of &quot;Mauryan polish&quot; did not die out with the reign of Ashoka.

==Succession==
Samprati, who succeeded Dasharatha, was according to the Hindu Puranas, the latter&#x27;s son and according to the Buddhist and Jain sources, Kunala&#x27;s son (making him possibly a brother of Dasharatha). The familial relationship between the two is thus not clear although evidently they were closely related members of the imperial family.

<doc id="1030039" wikidata="Q6066208" url="?curid=1030039" title="Ira Rennert">
<text>Ira Leon Rennert (born May 31, 1934) is an American billionaire businessman, and the chairman and CEO of Renco Group. As of November 2024, &quot;Forbes&quot; estimated his net worth at US$3.8 billion.

==Early life==
Rennert&#x27;s parents were immigrants from Poland and Romania. He graduated from Brooklyn College in 1954, and earned his master&#x27;s degree from New York University Stern School of Business in 1956, where he later was on the board of overseers.

==Early career==
Rennert started his career as a credit analyst on Wall Street in 1956. He also was a partner at Rubin, Rennert &amp; Co. before launching his own business, I. L. Rennert &amp; Co., in 1962. At this time he was censured by the National Association of Securities Dealers for operating with insufficient capital. It occurred again in 1963, and as a result, his license was revoked on November 29, 1964, effectively banning him from the securities industry. According to a company spokesman, Jon Goldberg: &quot;Due to market conditions, the firm found itself in violation of the net capital rule and Rennert raised capital and put it into the firm to bring it into compliance. However, the firm once more fell beneath the net-capital requirements and he shut the company down.&quot;

==Junk bond financing==
Michael Milken—as a bond trader for Drexel Burnham Lambert—was successful in selling high-risk, high-yield bonds issued by struggling or undercapitalized companies. Integrated Resources raised $2 billion in junk bonds financed by Milken but ultimately collapsed amid scandal and defaulted on $1 billion of bond debt in May 1989 (see the 1991 book &quot;Den of Thieves&quot; about the junk bond scandal). As an outside board member, Rennert was not dragged down by the collapse and began to raise junk bonds on his own behalf to finance acquisitions for the Renco Group.

Rennert&#x27;s strategy for building Renco was to acquire all the shares of struggling companies and to finance the acquisition by issuing junk bonds. Along the way, he paid substantial dividends out of the business to himself. In a series of junk bond issues since 1995, Renco&#x27;s subsidiaries have borrowed an estimated $1.1 billion and transferred $322 million (29 percent) to Renco Group, according to documents filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Backed by blue-chip mutual funds and hedge funds such as John Hancock Funds LLC and Putnam Investment Management LLC, Rennert now didn&#x27;t have to invest much of his own money. His purchase of AM General in 1992 was bought with a down payment of just $10 million. In 1994, Fluor Corp. of Los Angeles sold the Doe Run Company to Renco, with the latter paying $52 million in cash, and approximately $60 million in debt payable over an eight-year period. In 1997, Doe Run went on to pay $247 million for a similarly environmentally troubled lead smelting complex from the Peruvian government, as well as borrowing more money to service its Fluor Corporation debt. And in 1998, Doe Run sold $305 million in junk bonds for financing its Peruvian acquisition as well as more lead mines in Missouri (according to Doe Run filings with the SEC). Since 1998 most Renco financings have been bank debt.

==Transactions and subsidiaries==
===WCI Steel===
In 1988, Renco bought a Warren (Ohio) steel company from its bankrupt parent, LTV Steel Co., for a price tag of $140 million. This company then became WCI Steel Inc., and Rennert was able to ultimately sell bonds totaling $300 million, paying $108 million of the proceeds as a dividend to Renco. In 1998, Renco Steel Holdings Inc. was created to serve as a holding company for WCI. The holding company then sold $120 million in junk bonds, this time paying an additional $100 million dividend to Renco.

At the time of the bankruptcy, if the pension plan had been terminated, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation calculated a $117 million shortfall. Despite losing the company, Renco agreed to assume responsibility for the existing pension plan, with ongoing support from WCI. Newspaper reports speculated that the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation had threatened to put a lien on Rennert&#x27;s personal estate in order to ensure the steelworkers&#x27; benefits. Harbinger sold the business to Severstal, a steelmaker based in Russia.

===MagCorp/US Magnesium===
In 1989, Renco acquired the U.S.&#x27;s largest magnesium producer in Utah. Removing minerals from the water of the Great Salt Lake, Magnesium Corp. uses chemicals to refine the magnesium used in products ranging from bombs to bicycles. In 1996, Renco established Renco Metals, Inc. as a holding company for Magnesium Corp. and issued $150 million in bonds. Just like WCI, the company paid Renco $90 million in dividends by the year end.

In 2001, the Department of Justice filed suit against Magnesium Corp. for multiple violations of hazardous waste law, and also it cited Rennert&#x27;s removal of money from Magnesium Corp. through the bond issue, &quot;leaving the companies insolvent and unable to pay their bills&quot;. The suit went on until 2007, when a judge ruled in favor of Renco and against the DOJ.

On August 17, 2010, a 10th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling overturned a District Court judge&#x27;s October 17, 2007, decision that the U.S. Magnesium facility in Rowley, Utah was not illegally disposing five wastes. The initial lawsuit DOJ filed on behalf of EPA in 2001 claimed U.S. Magnesium was not following regulations promulgated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, which dictates how waste byproducts must be disposed. Renco continues to operate the business under the name US Magnesium. At this point, US Magnesium is the only magnesium producer in the United States.

The EPA published its proposal to place the US Magnesium facility on the National Priorities List (NPL, a &quot;Superfund site&quot; under CERCLA) in the &quot;Federal Register&quot; on September 3, 2008. The National Priorities List (NPL) is a list of places, commonly known as &quot;superfund sites,&quot; considered national priorities for environmental remediation because of known or threatened releases of hazardous substances.USM filed its petition for review of the listing in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on November 5, 2009. On January 14, 2011, the United States Court of Appeals sided with the EPA and upheld placing the site on the National Priority List.

===AM General===
In 1993, Renco acquired AM General from the LTV Corporation to help LTV emerge from bankruptcy. Terms included a $67.5 million cash payment with the remainder to be paid in various forms over a 10-year period. AM General produced vehicles for industrial, military and government use, including the Humvee. On August 20, 2004, it was announced that Ronald Perelman&#x27;s MacAndrews &amp; Forbes Holdings company would buy 70% of AM General from Renco. The deal reportedly cost close to US$1 billion.

==Environmental track record==
===United States===
The Renco Group&#x27;s environmental record in the U.S. related to Doe Run provides a good example of this development. In 1998, the EPA placed Renco Group business holdings 10th on the nation&#x27;s largest polluter list primarily because of emissions from US Magnesium in Utah (formerly MagCorp). (US Magnesium was purchased by Renco in 1989 in the year in which its emissions peaked at 119,000 tons per year.) By 1998, the year the Renco was placed on the EPA list, it had reduced emissions at US Magnesium by 50%. By 2005, the most recent year of data released by the EPA, emissions had been reduced 97%.

In 2001, the Justice Department and EPA filed suit against Renco. They demanded nearly $1 billion in fines, alleging MagCorp (a Renco Metals Inc. subsidiary) dumped toxic waste in ditches and ponds on the Great Salt Lake. The suit claimed PCB-laced sludge and dust choked the plant&#x27;s plumbing, wastewater ponds, landfill and ditches, where contaminants were 12 times the allowed limit for accidental release. MagCorp maintained it was exempt from the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, which requires companies to monitor certain kinds of hazardous waste. Magcorp declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy shortly after the lawsuit began and a federal judge allowed Rennert to restructure MagCorp—now U.S. Magnesium—which exempted it from previous legal liability. The EPA suit, however, remained outstanding until October 2007 when a federal judge ruled against the EPA and the Justice Department and in favor of Renco and MagCorp / US Magnesium.

Today, US Magnesium is the third-largest magnesium producer in the world. Its environmental improvements and recent track record have been substantial and include a reduction of emissions by 90% since 2000 (97% since 1989). The EPA data recognizes this as the single largest reduction in air emissions in the category of hazardous air pollutants since the TRI began in 1987 at any single facility. The energy improvements in US Magnesium&#x27;s manufacturing process have also caused a net reduction of 100,000 tons per year of carbon dioxide emissions. US Magnesium was the recipient of a 2004 Climate Protection Award from the EPA and won an MEP award in 2006 for Environmental Consciousness.

Another US unit of Renco also faced environmental issues in Herculaneum, Missouri and has made substantial improvements. Locals in Herculaneum claimed their children were suffering from lead poisoning traceable to toxic emissions coming from Renco&#x27;s Doe Run lead smelting plant, which had been in operations locally since 1892. In 2000, the EPA and the Missouri Department of Natural Resources tested area lead levels and ordered Doe Run to clean up locations where lead levels exceeded EPA standards. A 2002 study showed more than half of the children living within a quarter mile of the smelter had high blood-lead levels. Doe Run agreed to buy 160 homes in the contaminated area around the smelter at a cost of more than $10 million. An EPA fact sheet noted the following: &quot;Since 2001, EPA, MDNR and The Doe Run Company have addressed lead contamination in Herculaneum through a series of actions which have included residential soil replacements, home interior cleanups, and a voluntary residential buyout program. EPA and MDNR continue to work with Doe Run to address stabilization, erosion control, flood protection, stormwater collection and treatment, and wetland mitigation related to the slag pile area at the site. EPA and MDNR are also working with Doe Run to address soil recontamination of residences near the smelter and contamination along city haul routes.&quot; In the first quarter of 2007, Doe Run met all of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). By 2008, the conditional approval proposed, which covered air dispersion model selection as well as meteorological and emissions inventory data, among others, for the operation of the smelter was incorporated to the 2007 Consent Judgment between the company and the state of Missouri. In 2013, Doe Run shut down its lead smelter, entirely discontinuing emissions in Missouri.
===Peru===
Doe Run, Peru, (a Renco Group holding) operated a smelting plant in La Oroya, Peru until 2010, that had similar types of environmental challenges to those faced in Herculaneum, but on a larger scale. The La Oroya smelter began operations in 1922 and was operated for many years by Centromin, a Peruvian government agency, without any environmental controls.

The smelter was sold to Doe Run in 1997 primarily because the Peruvian government passed a law that required environmental improvement at the business. This improvement was beyond the economic and technical capability of Centromin. As part of the sale to Renco, Centromin agreed to pay to remediate pre-existing (pre-1997) environmental problems and Doe Run Peru agreed to make substantial environmental investments. These investments were estimated to be approximately $100 million at the time of the deal.

In the end, Doe Run ended up investing more than $300 million in environmental remediation during its ownership and was not able to clean up the site to achieve the standards required by Peruvian law. La Oroya was and remains a very polluted site. The Blacksmith Institute placed La Oroya on its list of ten most polluted places in the world, along with Chernobyl, Ukraine. In August 2007, it was reported that air levels of arsenic levels were 85 times more than the &quot;safe&quot; level, cadmium 41 times, and lead 13 times more. A study by St. Louis University scientists found that 97 percent of children in La Oroya suffer from mental and physical deficiencies related to their exposure to polluted air.

Ultimately, Doe Run Peru was a bad investment for Renco on many counts. Renco received substantial negative publicity regarding its ownership and the environmental problems in La Oroya. The environmental problems were not solved despite huge investment by Renco, and Renco never made any financial profit from its investment.

Doe Run Peru is currently in a dispute with the Peruvian government which in part relates to Doe Run&#x27;s claims that Centromin did not live up to its obligations with regard to cleaning up the pre-existing pollution.

==Philanthropy==
Ira Rennert ranks #818 on &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the world&#x27;s billionaires. He also ranks #29 on &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot; list of the World&#x27;s 50 Richest Jews.

Rennert and his wife Ingeborg have made many charitable donations to various organizations. They donated $5 million to establish the Wiesel Center at Boston University and $250,000 to the Lincoln Center. They also gave over $1 million to the World Trade Center Memorial and established the Rennert Entrepreneurial Institute of Sy Syms School of Business at Yeshiva University. They have endowed chairs at several different universities, including a chair in Jewish studies at Barnard College, a chair in Aging Research at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, a chair in Stem Cell Biology at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, and the Ira Rennert Professorship of Business at Columbia University. They also established the Ira Leon Rennert Professor of Entrepreneurial Finance at New York University and founded the Ingeborg Rennert Center for Jerusalem Studies at Bar-Ilan University.

The Rennerts also helped to fund the construction of The Western Wall Heritage Foundation in Jerusalem (the visitor&#x27;s center is called The Ingeborg and Ira Leon Rennert Hall of Light). Rennert&#x27;s wife and children are named as the donors of The Jonas Mendel (Yonah Menachem Ben Mendel) Rennert Memorial Chapel at the Center for Jewish History. The Rennerts are known to have donated to Rabbi Aharon Bina&#x27;s new yeshiva in Israel, Yeshivat Netiv Aryeh, and are additionally honored with a plaque as well as their family upon entrance into the building. They also donated hundreds of Torah scrolls to communities in Israel.
The family also funded the construction for a new mikvah at the Fifth Avenue Synagogue, which was completed in May 2010.

==Political activity==
Rennert is a major Republican donor. He has contributed money to John McCain, Rudy Giuliani and other candidates.

Together with his spouse, Rennert contributed $900,000 to Donald Trump&#x27;s 2020 presidential campaign.

==Personal life==
===Family===
Rennert is married to Ingeborg Hanna Rennert, a former airline ticket agent who is a convert to Judaism. She serves as the Director of Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, Inc. They have three children:
*Tamara Rennert Winn, married to Randall Winn, co-founder of Capital IQ (now S&amp;P Capital IQ)
*Yonina Rennert Davidson
*Ari Rennert

Rennert is a member of the Fifth Avenue Synagogue, an Orthodox synagogue where he is also honorary chairman.

===Houses===
Rennert caused controversy among his neighbors by building a beach front home in Sagaponack, New York, considered one of the largest occupied residential compounds in the United States. The house outraged locals, who claimed Rennert originally planned to use it as a spa, a hotel, or a religious retreat. He denied such allegations, and the local paper later issued an apology.
He named his home after the adjoining body of water, Fairfield Pond.

The house faces the Atlantic Ocean and its grounds measure . The buildings, which total over , including the main house, have an Italianate facade, 29 bedrooms, and 39 bathrooms. The house has a dozen chimneys and a Mediterranean-style tile roof as well as a long formal dining room, a basketball court, a bowling alley, two tennis courts, two squash courts, a carousel, a large swimming pool, a large round kiddie pool, and a $150,000 hot tub, surrounded by another pool. Its property taxes in 2007 were $397,559.00. Based on these taxes, the home is currently valued at $198 million, making it the most valuable home in the United States. Besides his house in Sagaponack, Rennert owns a duplex apartment on Manhattan&#x27;s Park Avenue, and a home in Israel. He previously lived in Atlantic Beach, NY.

<text>Andrew North is an English journalist and writer. For several years, heh was the BBC&#x27;s South Asia correspondent. North has been covering Afghanistan since 2001, and was based in Kabul for the BBC for many years. He has also worked in conflicts in Iraq, Libya, and Georgia. From 2021, he has written about the Taliban&#x27;s return to power for a wide range of international publications, with repeated trips to the region. His work has appeared in &quot;Nikkei Asia&quot;, &quot;The Economist&quot;, Tortoise, &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot;, and &quot;The Guardian&quot;, and various other outlets.

North was nominated for the RTS Foreign Reporter of the Year award for his coverage of the 2008 Georgia-Russia war, for a Webby for his multi-media web story &quot;The Big Draw: Selling the Soviet Past&quot; on markets of left-over relics of the Soviet period in Georgia. Some of his work uses a mix of reportage and drawing. In 2022, North was also nominated for a Foreign Press Association (London) award, for &quot;Afghanistan nightmare: a humanitarian crisis that threatens to dwarf all others&quot;, for &quot;Nikkei Asia&quot;, with Paula Bronstein.

North has been a speaker at various journalism festivals. His analysis has been cited in various books and articles, including on the culture of foreign correspondents and their relationship with fixers, and on the use of mobile phones by insurgents to spread their messaging.

North was the subject of wide coverage when he was detained by the Taliban in Kabul in February 2022, while working on an assignment for the United Nations. After being detained for several days, North was released and allowed to leave the country. His arrest was widely covered in international media. The Committee to Protect Journalists described his detention as a &quot;a sad reflection of the overall decline of press freedom and increasing attacks on journalists under Taliban rule.&quot; In 2012, North had described a looming tipping point for the presence of foreign troops in Afghanistan, and a drastic change in the mood of the country.

North is the author of the 2024 book &quot;War &amp; Peace &amp; War: Twenty Years in Afghanistan&quot;, an account of Taliban resurgence over two decades, told through the lives of five Afghans.

<text>Meteor is a 1979 American science fiction disaster film directed by Ronald Neame and starring Sean Connery and Natalie Wood. The film&#x27;s premise, which follows a group of scientists struggling with Cold War politics after an asteroid is detected to be on a collision course with Earth, was inspired by a 1967 MIT report, &quot;Project Icarus&quot;. The screenplay was written by Oscar winner Edmund H. North and Stanley Mann.

The international cast also includes Karl Malden, Brian Keith, Martin Landau, Trevor Howard, Joseph Campanella, Richard Dysart and Henry Fonda. The film was a box-office flop and received negative reviews, but it was nonetheless nominated for the Academy Award for Best Sound.

==Plot==
After the asteroid Orpheus in the Asteroid Belt is hit by a comet, dozens of asteroid fragments are sent on a collision course with Earth, along with a five-mile-wide fragment that will cause an extinction-level event. While the United States government engages in political maneuvering, the smaller asteroid fragments preceding the main body wreak havoc on the planet, revealing the threat. The United States has a secret orbiting nuclear missile platform satellite named &quot;Hercules&quot; that was designed by Dr. Paul Bradley. It was intended to defend Earth against a threat like Orpheus, but instead was commandeered by the U.S. Armed Forces to become an orbiting weapon now aimed at the Soviet Union. After many calculations, it is determined that the fourteen nuclear missiles on board &quot;Hercules&quot; are not enough to stop the asteroid.

The United States has known that the Soviet Union also has a similar weapons satellite in orbit called &quot;Peter the Great&quot;, with its sixteen nuclear warheads pointed at the United States. Needing the additional firepower to stop Orpheus, the President goes on national television and reveals the existence of &quot;Hercules&quot;, explaining it was created to meet the threat that Orpheus represents. He also offers the Soviets a chance to save face by announcing that they had the same program and their own satellite weapon. To coordinate the counter-effort between the two countries, Bradley requests a Soviet scientist named Dr. Alexei Dubov.

Bradley and Harry Sherwood of NASA meet at the control center for &quot;Hercules&quot;, located beneath 195 Broadway in Lower Manhattan. Major General Adlon is the commander of the facility. Dubov and his interpreter Tatiana Donskaya arrive, and Bradley gets to work on breaking the ice between them. Since Dubov cannot admit the existence of the Soviet device, he agrees to Bradley&#x27;s proposal that they work on the &quot;theoretical application&quot; of how a &quot;theoretical&quot; Soviet space platform&#x27;s weapons would be coordinated with the American platform.

Meanwhile, more meteorite fragments strike Earth (one inside Siberia), and the Soviets finally agree to join in the effort. Both satellites are coordinated and turned toward the incoming large asteroid as smaller fragments continue to strike the planet, causing great damage, including a deadly avalanche in the Swiss Alps and a tsunami that devastates Hong Kong. With hours remaining until Orpheus&#x27; impact, &quot;Peter the Great&quot;″s missiles are launched first as planned because of its relative position to the asteroid, with &quot;Hercules&quot;″s missiles timed to be fired forty minutes later.

Immediately prior to &quot;Hercules&quot;″s missiles being launched, a splinter fragment is discovered to be heading toward the command center in New York City. If the center is destroyed, &quot;Hercules&quot; will not be able to launch. With seconds to spare, &quot;Hercules&quot; receives the signal to fire from the command center and launches its missiles. The splinter impacts the city, destroying the top half of the World Trade Center twin towers in a direct hit, and creating a large crater in Central Park. Several workers inside the control center are killed when the facility is partially destroyed by the collapse of the building above, and the survivors are forced to work their way out of the control center by going through the New York subway system, which becomes a trap due to water from the East River flooding the tunnels. Meanwhile, the two flights of missiles link up into three successively larger waves. The &quot;Hercules&quot; crew reaches a crowded subway station and waits while others try to dig them out.

Eventually, the missiles reach the meteoroid. The first wave of missiles strikes the rock, causing a small explosion; the second wave follows with a larger blast, and the third wave creates an enormous explosion. When the dust clears, the asteroid appears obliterated. In New York City, the radios broadcast the good news: Orpheus is no longer a danger to Earth. Just then, the subway station occupants are rescued.

Later, at an airport, Dubov, Tatiana, Bradley and others exchange goodbyes before Dubov and Tatiana depart on a plane for the Soviet Union.

==Cast==
==Production==
Theodore R. Parvin received the idea for the story from a &quot;Saturday Review&quot; article by Isaac Asimov about a meteor hitting a major city in the United States. Parvin hired Edmund H. North to write the screenplay, and North took further inspiration from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology&#x27;s Project Icarus. However, Ronald Neame and Sean Connery disliked both North&#x27;s script and a rewrite by Steven Bach, so Stanley Mann was hired to completely re-write the screenplay. This led to a Writers Guild of America dispute over whether North should be credited as a co-writer.

During the writing of North&#x27;s first draft, Parvin secured financing and investment from the Shaw Brothers Studio, Warner Bros. Pictures, Nippon Herald Films and American International Pictures. The film was an American International Pictures co-production with the Shaw Brothers Studio in British Hong Kong. $2.7 million of the budget came from AIP.

Neame cast Natalie Wood as Tatiana because she was the daughter of Russian immigrants, and she worked with George Rubinstein to perfect a Leningrad accent. Alec Guinness, Yul Brynner, Rod Steiger, Maximilian Schell, Peter Ustinov, Eli Wallach, Telly Savalas, Theodore Bikel, Richard Burton and Orson Welles were each considered for the role of Dr. Dubov. Donald Pleasence was cast for the role and filmed a few scenes as the character. However, he departed the production to work on the film &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;. He was replaced by Brian Keith, who had been cast as General Adlon. Keith was replaced in that role by Martin Landau. Another reason why Brian Keith was chosen to play the role of Dr. Dubov was that he could speak fluent Russian.

Principal photography took place from October 31, 1977, to January 27, 1978, mainly at MGM Studios in Culver City, California, with some location filming in Washington, D.C., St. Moritz, Switzerland, and Hong Kong. The release date was scheduled for June 15, 1979, but it was pushed back to October 19 due to special effects reshoots after special effects director Frank Van der Veer was fired.

===Special effects===
With most of the special effects budget already expended by Van de Veer (whose work was not usable and was subsequently discarded), William Cruise and Margo Anderson were hired to reshoot as many special effects as possible with what money remained. They were also fired and replaced by Paul Kassler and Rob Balack, who were asked to complete the special effects, again with what money remained in the budget (and just two months before the film&#x27;s release). To complete the film on time, Kassler and Balack reused footage from the 1978 disaster film &quot;Avalanche&quot;, filmed the Hong Kong &quot;tidal wave&quot; scene in Los Angeles in an improvised water tank using cardboard cutouts of buildings, and used 22-inch-long nuclear missile satellite miniatures that were far too small for effective filming.

Prop designer John Zabrucky, who had previously worked only in television, provided props for the film.

===Music===
The film was originally supposed to receive a score by John Williams, but he was forced to leave the project after delays on the film&#x27;s production conflicted with his commitments to Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;1941&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;Meteor&quot; was received poorly by critics. In her review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Janet Maslin called the film &quot;standard disaster fare&quot;, adding that &quot;the suspense is sludgy and the character development nil&quot;.

Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film 1½ stars out of 4 and wrote, &quot;Let&#x27;s face it, the bottom line on a disaster film is how special are its special effects. With &#x27;Meteor,&#x27; the answer is not very. The big meteor in the picture, hurtling toward Earth at 30,000 miles an hour, looks like something I recently found at the bottom of my refrigerator — green bread.&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot; called the acting &quot;uniformly good&quot;, but the &quot;principals mostly stand around waiting for the next calamity to happen ... What really matters to audiences for this kind of film, of course, is not the acting, but the visuals, and here, &#x27;Meteor&#x27; gets good, but not great, grades.&quot;

Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that &quot;against its own odds, it is—for what it intends to be—uninspired but competent, efficient, commercial and entertaining, with some random moments that are very nice indeed.&quot;

Judith Martin of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called it &quot;your standard &#x27;My God — here it comes!&#x27; job, for those that like that sort of thing&quot;.

John Pym of &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote, &quot;As effects go, and effects rather than surprises (or any real plotline) are what the producers have banked on, &quot;Meteor&quot; looks decidedly old-fashioned and second-hand.&quot;

&quot;TV Guide&quot; wrote: &quot;An $18 million, star-studded disaster film, which in itself is a major disaster.&quot;

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 5% based on 19 reviews, with the site&#x27;s consensus being: &quot;&quot;Meteor&quot; is a flimsy flick with too much boring dialogue and not enough destruction. At least the pinball game is decent.&quot;

Marvel Comics published a comic book adaptation of the film by writer Ralph Macchio and artists Gene Colan and Tom Palmer in &quot;Marvel Super Special&quot; #14.

Samuel Z. Arkoff called &quot;Meteor&quot; the most difficult production ever undertaken by American International Pictures due to the high production, special effects and marketing costs. After the film flopped, the studio was forced to enter negotiations for a buyout from Filmways.

==Accolades==
At the 52nd Academy Awards in 1980, the film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Sound (William McCaughey, Aaron Rochin, Michael J. Kohut and Jack Solomon). It lost to &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;.

==Scientific basis==
A voiceover at the end of the film mentions &quot;Project Icarus&quot;, a report on the concept to use missiles to deflect an earthbound asteroid. The original &quot;Project Icarus&quot; was a student project at M.I.T., in a systems engineering class led by Professor Paul Sandorff in spring 1967. It examined methodologies that could deflect an Apollo asteroid named 1566 Icarus if it were found to be on a collision course with Earth. &quot;Time&quot; published an article about the research in June 1967. The results of the student reports were published in a book the following year.

<doc id="1030083" wikidata="Q233273" url="?curid=1030083" title="Christine Arron">
<text>Christine Arron (born 13 September 1973) is a former track and field sprinter, who competed internationally for France in the 60 metres, 100 metres, 200 metres and the 4 × 100 metres relay. She is one of the ten fastest female 100 metres sprinter of all time with 10.73 seconds which is still the European record. She set the record when winning at the 1998 European Championships, where she also won a gold medal in the 4 × 100 m relay. Also in the relay, she is a 2003 World Championship gold medallist and a 2004 Olympic bronze medallist.

==Running career==
Born in Les Abymes, Guadeloupe, Arron arrived in Metropolitan France in 1990 and first trained with Fernand Urtebise, who also coached the former 400 metres hurdles and 4 × 400 metres relay world champion Stephane Diagana.

On 19 Aug 1998, Arron won the 100 metres gold medal at the 1998 European Championships in Budapest by finishing the final in a new European record time of 10.73 seconds. Her time of 10.73 seconds made her then the world&#x27;s second-fastest ever, female 100 metres sprinter, behind Florence Griffith-Joyner (10.49 seconds, set in 1988). She also won the 4 × 100 metres relay gold medal at the same championships. She was named the 1998 European Women&#x27;s Athlete of the Year.

In 2001, after a heavy training period in the US with John Smith and the HSI group, Arron quit training for a year, saying she was physically exhausted from the experience. &quot;&quot;It was hell. Every morning I wondered how I was going to put up with the burden of training&quot;.&quot; She had a hip injury which kept her out of the 2001 World Championships.

Arron was also the anchor runner of the French 4 × 100 relay team which upset the heavy favourites the US to win the gold medal at the 2003 World Championships in Paris. She recovered from 3 m behind the newly crowned, 100 m 2003 World Champion, Torri Edwards, to give the home crowd at the Stade de France an unexpected joy.

Arron won her only Olympic medal, a bronze medal, in the 4 × 100 m relay at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, Greece.

In August 2005, Arron won a bronze medal in the 100 metres and 
200 metres at the 2005 World Championships.

At the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, Arron competed in the 100 metres event. In her first round heat, she placed first in front of Lauryn Williams and Tahesia Harrigan in a time of 11.37 sec to advance to the second round. But in the second round, she failed to advance to the semi-finals as her time of 11.36 sec was only the fourth fastest time of her heat, behind Debbie Ferguson, Oludamola Osayomi and Vida Anim, causing her elimination from the event.

As of September 2023, Arron is the world&#x27;s ninth-fastest, female 100 metres sprinter (10.73 sec) of all time. Considering the controversy surrounding the performances of the world record-holder (10.49 sec, set in 1988), Florence Griffith-Joyner, many considered Arron&#x27;s time of 10.73 sec. set during the 1998 European Championships to be the &#x27;true&#x27; world record. Besides Griffith-Joyner, only Marion Jones, Carmelita Jeter, Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, Elaine Thompson-Herah, Shericka Jackson, Marie-Josée Ta Lou and Sha&#x27;Carri Richardson have run faster than Arron in the 100 metres.

In December 2012, Arron announced her retirement from athletics. She was expecting her second child then. She did not rule out the possibility of returning to athletics competition after the birth of her second child.
On 9 October 2013, Arron was awarded the Chevalier de la Légion d&#x27;honneur by French President François Hollande in the Élysée Palace.

==Views on doping==
Arron has voiced her annoyance with Marion Jones, her fiercest rival during her career: &quot;She has lied for years [...] She treated everyone as idiots. I&#x27;m not shocked she is going to jail. Many people criticised me because I was always the one who lost in the Jones-Arron battle, even if I had very good results. We started running together in 1997. She has stolen my best years. Everything could have been different for me.&quot;

==Family==
In 2002, Arron gave birth to her first child, a son by the name of Ethan. On 16 May 2013, Arron gave birth to her second child, a daughter by the name of Cassandre. Cassandre&#x27;s father Benjamin Compaoré, a French triple jumper, became Arron&#x27;s companion in 2009. -

<text>High-altitude balloons or stratostats are usually uncrewed balloons typically filled with helium or hydrogen and released into the stratosphere, generally attaining between above sea level. In 2013, a balloon named BS 13-08 reached a record altitude of .

The most common type of high-altitude balloons are weather balloons. Other purposes include use as a platform for experiments in the upper atmosphere. Modern balloons generally contain electronic equipment such as radio transmitters, cameras, or satellite navigation systems, such as GPS receivers. Hobbyists frequently purchase weather balloons because of their ease of use, low price point, and widespread commoditisation.

These balloons are launched into what is defined as &quot;near space&quot;, defined as the area of Earth&#x27;s atmosphere between the Armstrong limit ( above sea level), where pressure falls to the point that a human being cannot survive without a pressurised suit, and the Kármán line ( above sea level), where astrodynamics must take over from aerodynamics in order to maintain flight.

Due to the low cost of GPS and communications equipment, high-altitude ballooning is a popular hobby, with organizations such as UKHAS assisting the development of payloads.

==History==

===The first hydrogen balloon===
In France during 1783, the first public experiment with hydrogen-filled balloons involved Jacques Charles, a French professor of physics, and the Robert brothers, renowned constructors of physics instruments.

Charles provided large quantities of hydrogen, which had only been produced in small quantities previously, by mixing of iron and of sulfuric acid. The balloon took 5 days to fill and was launched from Champ de Mars in Paris where 300,000 people gathered to watch the spectacle. The balloon was launched and rose through the clouds. The expansion of the gas caused the balloon to tear and it descended 45 minutes later away from Paris.

===Crewed high-altitude balloons===
Crewed high-altitude balloons have been used since the 1930s for research and in seeking flight altitude records, including Auguste Piccard&#x27;s flights up to , the Soviet Osoaviakhim-1 at , and the American Explorer II at .

Notable crewed high altitude balloon flights include three records set for highest skydive:

*the first set by Joseph Kittinger in 1960 at for Project Excelsior
*followed by Felix Baumgartner in 2012 at for Red Bull Stratos
*most recently Alan Eustace in 2014 at 

==Uses==
Uncrewed high-altitude balloons are used as research balloons, for educational purposes, and by hobbyists. Common uses include meteorology, atmospheric and climate research, collection of imagery from near space, amateur radio applications, and submillimetre astronomy.

High-altitude balloons have been considered for use in telecommunications and space tourism. Private companies such as Zero 2 Infinity, Space Perspective, Zephalto, and World View Enterprises are developing both crewed and uncrewed high-altitude balloons for scientific research, commercial purposes, and space tourism. High-altitude platform stations have been proposed for applications such as communications relays.

==Amateur high-altitude ballooning==

In many countries, the bureaucratic overhead required for high altitude balloon launches is minimal when the payload is below a certain weight threshold, typically on the order of a few kilograms. This makes the process of launching these small HABs accessible to many students and amateur groups. Despite their smaller size, these HABs still often ascend to (and past) altitudes on the order of , providing easy stratospheric access for scientific and educational purposes. These amateur balloon flights are often informed in their operations by the use of a path predictor. Before launch, weather forecasts containing predicted wind vectors are used to numerically propagate a simulated HAB along a trajectory, predicting where the actual balloon will travel.

===Amateur radio high-altitude ballooning===
Testing radio range is often a large component of these hobbies. Amateur radio is often used with packet radio to communicate with 1200 baud, using a system called Automatic Packet Reporting System back to the ground station. Smaller packages called &quot;micro&quot; or &quot;pico&quot; trackers are also built and run under smaller balloons. These smaller trackers have used Morse code, Field Hell, and RTTY to transmit their locations and other data.

The first recorded amateur radio high-altitude balloon launches took place in Finland by the Ilmari program on May 28, 1967, and in Germany in 1964.

====ARHAB program====

Amateur radio high-altitude ballooning (ARHAB) is the application of analog and digital amateur radio to weather balloons and was the name suggested by Ralph Wallio (amateur radio callsign W0RPK) for this hobby. Often referred to as &quot;The Poor Man&#x27;s Space Program&quot;, ARHAB allows amateurs to design functioning models of spacecraft and launch them into a space-like environment. Bill Brown (amateur radio callsign WB8ELK) is considered to have begun the modern ARHAB movement with his first launch of a balloon carrying an amateur radio transmitter on 15 August 1987.

An ARHAB flight consists of a balloon, a recovery parachute, and a payload of one or more packages. The payload normally contains an amateur radio transmitter that permits tracking of the flight to its landing for recovery. Most flights use an Automatic Packet Reporting System (APRS) tracker which gets its position from a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver and converts it to a digital radio transmission. Other flights may use an analog beacon and are tracked using radio direction finding techniques. Long duration flights frequently must use high frequency custom-built transmitters and slow data protocols such as radioteletype (RTTY), Hellschreiber, Morse code, and PSK31, to transmit data over great distances using little battery power. The use of amateur radio transmitters on an ARHAB flight requires an amateur radio license, but non-amateur radio transmitters are possible to use without a license.

In addition to the tracking equipment, other payload components may include sensors, data loggers, cameras, amateur television (ATV) transmitters or other scientific instruments. Some ARHAB flights carry a simplified payload package called BalloonSat.

A typical ARHAB flight uses a standard latex weather balloon, lasts around 2–3 hours, and reaches in altitude. Experiments with zero-pressure balloons, superpressure balloons, and valved latex balloons have extended flight times to more than 24 hours. A zero-pressure flight by the Spirit of Knoxville Balloon Program in March 2008 lasted over 40 hours and landed off the coast of Ireland, over from its launch point. On December 11, 2011, the California Near Space Project flight number CNSP-11 with the call sign K6RPT-11 launched a record-breaking flight traveling from San Jose, California, to a splashdown in the Mediterranean Sea. The flight lasted 57 hours and 2 minutes. It became the first successful U.S. transcontinental and the first successful transatlantic amateur radio high-altitude balloon. Since that time, a number of flights have circumnavigated the Earth using superpressure plastic film balloons.

Each year in the United States, the Great Plains Super Launch (GPSL) hosts a large gathering of ARHAB groups.

====BEAR program====
Balloon Experiments with Amateur Radio (BEAR) is a series of Canadian-based high-altitude balloon experiments by a group of Amateur Radio operators and experimenters from Sherwood Park and Edmonton, Alberta. The experiments started in the year 2000 and continued with BEAR-9 in 2012, reaching . The balloons are made of latex filled with either helium or hydrogen. All of the BEAR payloads carry a tracking system comprising a GPS receiver, an APRS encoder, and a radio transmitter module. Other experimental payload modules include an Amateur Radio crossband repeater, and a digital camera, all of which is contained within an insulated foam box suspended below the balloon.

===BalloonSat===

A BalloonSat is a simple package designed to carry lightweight experiments into near space. They are a popular introduction to engineering principles in some high school and college courses. BalloonSats are carried as secondary payloads on ARHAB flights. One reason BalloonSats are simple is that they do not require the inclusion of tracking equipment; as secondary payloads, they already are being carried by tracking capsules.

Space Grant started the BalloonSat program in August 2000. It was created as a hands-on way to introduce new science and engineering students interested in space studies to some fundamental engineering techniques, team working skills and the basics of space and Earth science. The BalloonSat program is part of a course taught by Space Grant at the University of Colorado at Boulder.

Often the design of a BalloonSat is under weight and volume constraints. This encourages good engineering practices, introduces a challenge, and allows for the inclusion of many BalloonSats on an ARHAB flight. The airframe material is usually Styrofoam or Foamcore, as they are lightweight, easy to machine, and provide reasonably good insulation.

Most carry sensors, data loggers and small cameras operated by timer circuits. Popular sensors include air temperature, relative humidity, tilt, and acceleration. Experiments carried inside BalloonSats have included such things as captive insects and food items.

Before launch, most BalloonSats are required to undergo testing. These tests are designed to ensure the BalloonSat will function properly and return science results. The tests include a cold soak, drop test, function test, and weighing. The cold soak test simulates the intense cold temperatures the BalloonSat will experience during its mission. A launch and landing can be traumatic, therefore the drop test requires the BalloonSat to hold together and still function after an abrupt drop. The function test verifies the BalloonSat crew can prepare the BalloonSat at the launch site.

=== Variety payloads ===
Besides conducting scientific activities, schools, influencers and other individuals have launched a wide variety of novelty payloads to the stratosphere with high-altitude balloons. These have included teddy bears, LEGO figurines, hamburgers, pizza, Cornish pasties, garlic bread, bacon and cans of beer. Japanese electronics manufacturer Toshiba attempted to record an advertisement in near space with an armchair and cameras tethered to a high-altitude balloon.

==Geostationary balloon satellite==

Geostationary balloon satellites (GBS) are proposed high-altitude balloons that would float in the mid-stratosphere ( above sea level) at a fixed point over the Earth&#x27;s surface and thereby act as an atmospheric satellite. At those altitudes, air density is around 1/15 to 1/20 of what it is at sea level. The average wind speed at these levels is less than that at the surface. A propulsion system would allow the balloon to move into and maintain its position. The GBS would be powered with solar panels.

A GBS could be used to provide broadband Internet access over a large area. Laser broadband would connect the GBS to the network, which could then provide a large area of coverage because of its wider line of sight over the curvature of the Earth and unimpeded Fresnel zone.

===Arizona space balloon port===
World View Enterprises built and operates a balloon spaceport (high-altitude balloon port) in Pima County, Arizona.

<text>Monique Marie Henderson (born February 18, 1983, in San Diego, California) is an American track and field athlete, who specializes in the 400-meter dash. Henderson was a gold medalist in both the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, Greece and the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, China as a member of the American 4×400-meter relay squad.

As a young runner, she set the still standing American record for 9-10-year-old girls in the 400 meters.

Henderson prepped at Morse High School in San Diego &#x27;01. She is the only four-time 400 meters California State Champion in the state&#x27;s history from 98–01. In 1999 while in high school, age 16, she won the 400m at the World Youth Championship in Bydgoszcz, Poland. At age 17, she set a US junior class, as well as high school national record (since broken), at 50.74 in the 400 m at the CIF California State Meet. In 2000, still in high school, she was named to the US Olympic track and field team. Selected as an alternate (Pool) for the 4 × 400 m squad but did not run. That year she was named the national Girl&#x27;s &quot;High School Athlete of the Year&quot; by &quot;Track and Field News&quot;.

After graduating from high school in 2001 she accepted a scholarship to attend UCLA. While at UCLA in 2002, she place 1st in the 400m at the World Junior Championship held in Kingston Jamaica. Also at UCLA she went on to be a five-time Pac-10 champion. In 2004, she placed second at the NCAA championships at 400 m. The next year she became the 2005 NCAA outdoor champion at 400 m, establishing a new NCAA record (50.10). In 2005, she won the Honda Award as the nation&#x27;s best female collegiate track and field athlete.

Since 2010, the gold medal at the Athens Olympics in 2004 has been in doubt as Crystal Cox, who ran for the team in a preliminary round, admitted to doping. However, as of 2012 the original result still stands.

She holds a master&#x27;s degree in kinesiology and worked as a professor in the exercise science department at San Diego Mesa College until 2015 when she became the head coach at Golden West College in Summer 2015.

==Honors==
Monique Henderson was nominated and inducted into the San Diego County Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 2009 hosted by Women&#x27;s Museum of California, Commission on the Status of Women, University of California, San Diego Women&#x27;s Center, and San Diego State University Women&#x27;s Studies.

<text>Wiener Neustadt (; [i.e. Lower Austria]; , ) is a city located south of Vienna, in the state of Lower Austria, in northeast Austria. It is a self-governed city and the seat of the district administration of Wiener Neustadt-Land District. The city is the site of one of the world&#x27;s oldest military academies, the Theresian Military Academy, which was established by Empress Maria Theresa of Austria in 1751 to train officers for the Austrian army.

==History==

The area once belonged to the County of Pitten, which had been inherited by Margrave Ottokar III of Styria in 1158. After the dynasty of the Otakars became extinct with the death of his son Ottokar IV, the Duchy of Styria passed to the Austrian House of Babenberg according to the Georgenberg Pact. Duke Leopold V of Austria established the town called Neustadt in 1194 and financed the construction of a fortress close to the Hungarian border with the ransom paid for the English king Richard the Lionheart, whom he had previously captured and held as a hostage at Dürnstein Castle. In 1241, a small Mongol squadron raided Neustadt during the Mongol incursions in the Holy Roman Empire but was later repulsed by Duke Friederich and his knights. In 1246 it was the scene of a victory of the Hungarians over the Austrians.

Neustadt gained important privileges that enabled the city to prosper. It remained a part of Styria, which after the 1278 Battle on the Marchfeld fell to the House of Habsburg and in 1379 became a constituent duchy of Inner Austria. In the 15th century, Wiener Neustadt experienced a population boom, when Emperor Frederick III of Habsburg took up a residence here and established the Diocese of Wiener Neustadt in 1469. His wife, Eleanor of Portugal, died in Wiener Neustadt in 1467. The late Gothic church of the old Cistercian abbey contains a monument to her memory. The &quot;Wappenwand&quot; (coat-of-arms wall) at the local castle displays the coats of arms of his possessions in the middle. His son Maximilian I maintained his court in Wiener Neustadt and is buried here at St. George&#x27;s Cathedral. The town then also had a significant Jewish commune with Rabbi Israel Isserlin as its most notable member, until all Jews were expelled by order of Emperor Maximilian I in 1496.

Habsburg&#x27;s long-time rival King Matthias Corvinus of Hungary conquered the city in August 1487 after having laid siege to it for two years. According to legend he dedicated the magnificent Corvinus Cup to the inhabitants after his victory. Maximilian I managed to reconquer his native city in 1490. During the 16th century, Wiener Neustadt lost its status as imperial residence and much of its importance. However, it still fulfilled its function as bulwark against the Turks and the Kuruc.

It was at Neustadt that the emperor Rudolf II granted to the Bohemian Protestants, in 1609, the , or patent of equal rights. The revocation of this patent helped to precipitate the Thirty Years&#x27; War.

In 1751 the city received greater attention when Empress Maria Theresa of Austria decided to dedicate the First Military Academy, worldwide, inside the imperial castle. In 1752, the Theresian Military Academy took up its operations, which have continued to this day with only a few interruptions (Erwin Rommel was appointed commandant after the Austrian &quot;Anschluss&quot; in 1938). In 1768, Wiener Neustadt was destroyed by an earthquake that damaged the castle, which was rebuilt using plans made by the architect Nicolò Pacassi. In 1785, Emperor Joseph II of Habsburg transferred the see of the Wiener Neustadt diocese to Sankt Pölten.

In the 19th century the city, which was almost entirely rebuilt after a destructive fire in 1834, became an industrial town, especially after the opening of the Austrian Southern Railway in 1841. In 1909, the &quot;first official Austrian airfield&quot; was inaugurated north of the city. It served as a training ground for the flight pioneers Igo Etrich, Karl Illner and Adolf Warchalowski, who conducted their tests there.

The Austro-Hungarian strike of January 1918 was started in Wiener Neustadt by workers from the Austro-Daimler factory, which was engaged in arms production, and inspired by the Bolshevik seizure of power to take strike action to oppose the war. A key factor in the strike was the halving of the flour ration. Porsche met the workers and agreed to drive to Vienna to speak to the Minister of Food. However his plea to the workers to return to work was ignored and they marched on the Town Hall. Here they were joined by other workers from the locomotive factory, the radiator works, the aircraft factory and local ammunition plants of G. Rath and the Lichtenwörther. On 14 January over 10,000 workers gathered outside the town hall to complain about the halving of the flour ration. Inspired by the Russian Revolution the workers set up Workers Councils.

During World War II, strategic targets in Wiener Neustadt, including the marshalling yards, the Wiener Neustädter Flugzeugwerke (WNF) factory, and two Raxwerke plants which used forced laborers imprisoned at Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp, were repeatedly bombed. Bombing operations such as Operation Pointblank left only 18 of 4,000 buildings undamaged.

<doc id="1030104" wikidata="Q1166273" url="?curid=1030104" title="Darknet">
<text>A darknet or dark net is an overlay network within the Internet that can only be accessed with specific software, configurations, or authorization, and often uses a unique customized communication protocol. Two typical darknet types are social networks (usually used for file hosting with a peer-to-peer connection), and anonymity proxy networks such as Tor via an anonymized series of connections.

The term &quot;darknet&quot; was popularized by major news outlets and was associated with Tor Onion services when the infamous drug bazaar Silk Road used it, despite the terminology being unofficial. Technology such as Tor, I2P, and Freenet are intended to defend digital rights by providing security, anonymity, or censorship resistance and are used for both illegal and legitimate reasons. Anonymous communication between whistle-blowers, activists, journalists and news organisations is also facilitated by darknets through use of applications such as SecureDrop.

== Terminology ==
The term originally described computers on ARPANET that were hidden, programmed to receive messages but not respond to or acknowledge anything, thus remaining invisible and in the dark.

Since ARPANET, the usage of dark net has expanded to include friend-to-friend networks (usually used for file sharing with a peer-to-peer connection) and privacy networks such as Tor. The reciprocal term for a darknet is a clearnet or the surface web when referring to content indexable by search engines.

The term &quot;darknet&quot; is often used interchangeably with &quot;dark web&quot; because of the quantity of hidden services on Tor&#x27;s darknet. Additionally, the term is often inaccurately used interchangeably with the deep web because of Tor&#x27;s history as a platform that could not be search-indexed. Mixing uses of both these terms has been described as inaccurate, with some commentators recommending the terms be used in distinct fashions.

==Origins==
&quot;Darknet&quot; was coined in the 1970s to designate networks isolated from ARPANET (the government-founded military/academical network which evolved into the Internet), for security purposes. Darknet addresses could receive data from ARPANET but did not appear in the network lists and would not answer pings or other inquiries.

The term gained public acceptance following publication of &quot;The Darknet and the Future of Content Distribution&quot;, a 2002 paper by Peter Biddle, Paul England, Marcus Peinado, and Bryan Willman, four employees of Microsoft who argued the presence of the darknet was the primary hindrance to the development of workable digital rights management (DRM) technologies and made copyright infringement inevitable. This paper described &quot;darknet&quot; more generally as any type of parallel network that is encrypted or requires a specific protocol to allow a user to connect to it.

=== Sub-cultures ===
Journalist J. D. Lasica, in his 2005 book &quot;Darknet: Hollywood&#x27;s War Against the Digital Generation&quot;, described the darknet&#x27;s reach encompassing file sharing networks. Subsequently, in 2014, journalist Jamie Bartlett in his book &quot;The Dark Net&quot; used the term to describe a range of underground and emergent subcultures, including camgirls, cryptoanarchists, darknet drug markets, self harm communities, social media racists, and transhumanists.

== Uses ==
Darknets in general may be used for various reasons, such as:
* To better protect the privacy rights of citizens from targeted and mass surveillance
* Computer crime (cracking, file corruption, etc.)
* Protecting dissidents from political reprisal
* File sharing (warez, personal files, pornography, confidential files, illegal or counterfeit software, etc.)
* Sale of restricted goods on darknet markets
* Whistleblowing and news leaks
* Purchase or sale of illicit or illegal goods or services
* Circumventing network censorship and content-filtering systems, or bypassing restrictive firewall policies

==Software==
All darknets require specific software installed or network configurations made to access them, such as Tor, which can be accessed via a customized browser from Vidalia (aka the Tor browser bundle), or alternatively via a proxy configured to perform the same function.

===Active===
Tor is the most popular instance of a darknet, and it is often mistakenly thought to be the only online tool that facilitates access to darknets. Alphabetical list:

*anoNet is a decentralized friend-to-friend network built using VPN and software BGP routers.
*Decentralized network 42 (not for anonymity but research purposes).
*Freenet is a popular DHT file hosting darknet platform. It supports friend-to-friend and opennet modes.
*GNUnet can be utilized as a darknet if the &quot;F2F (network) topology&quot; option is enabled.
*I2P (Invisible Internet Project) is an overlay proxy network that features hidden services called &quot;Eepsites&quot;. 
*IPFS has a browser extension that may backup popular webpages.
*RetroShare is a friend-to-friend messenger communication and file transfer platform. It may be used as a darknet if DHT and Discovery features are disabled.
*Riffle is a government, client-server darknet system that simultaneously provides secure anonymity (as long as at least one server remains uncompromised), efficient computation, and minimal bandwidth burden.
*Secure Scuttlebutt is a peer-to peer communication protocol, mesh network, and self-hosted social media ecosystem
*Syndie is software used to publish distributed forums over the anonymous networks of I2P, Tor and Freenet.
*Tor (The onion router) is an anonymity network that also features a darknet – via its onion services. 
*Tribler is an anonymous BitTorrent client with built in search engine, and non-web, worldwide publishing through channels.
*Urbit is a federated system of personal servers in a peer-to-peer overlay network.
*Zeronet is a DHT Web 2.0 hosting with Tor users.

<text>Sanya Richards-Ross (née Richards; born February 26, 1985) is a retired American track and field athlete who competed internationally for the United States in the 400-meter sprint. Her notable accolades in this event include being the 2012 Olympic champion, 2009 world champion, 2008 Olympic bronze medalist, and 2005 world silver medalist. With her victory in 2012, she became the second American woman to win the 400 meters at the Olympic Games and the first American woman to earn multiple global 400-meter titles. At this distance, Richards-Ross is also a six-time U.S. national champion (2003, 2005, 2006, 2008, 2009, and 2012).

A formidable competitor throughout her career, Richards-Ross ranked number one in the world from 2005 to 2009 and again in 2012 in the 400 meters. She set the American 400-meter record of 48.70 seconds in 2006 and was named the IAAF 2006 Female World Athlete of the Year, an honor she received again in 2009. Richards-Ross also holds the record for the most sub-50 second sprints in the history of the event, with a career total of 49 times. In addition to her individual achievements, she won three consecutive Olympic gold medals in the 4 × 400 meters relay at the 2004, 2008, and 2012 Summer Olympics, as well as five total relay medals from multiple World Athletics Championships.

Following an injury at the 2016 U.S. Olympic trials, Richards-Ross retired from the sport and subsequently joined the NBC broadcasting team as a track and field analyst. She published her memoir &quot;Chasing Grace: What the Quarter Mile has Taught Me about God and Life&quot; in 2017.

In October 2021, Bravo announced that Richards-Ross was joining the fourteenth season of &quot;The Real Housewives of Atlanta&quot;.

==Early life==
Richards-Ross was born on February 26, 1985, in Kingston, Jamaica to Archie and Sharon Richards. She began running at the age of seven and represented her school Vaz Prep in annual youth championships. When Richards-Ross was twelve years old, her family immigrated to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, so that she could attend an American high school, increasing her chances of obtaining an athletic scholarship to an American university. Richards-Ross was a 2002 graduate of St. Thomas Aquinas High School, where she finished with a cumulative 4.0 GPA and was pegged the 2002 Gatorade National High School Girls Track and Field Athlete of the Year and also the USA Track and Field Youth Athlete of the Year. At Aquinas, she was a nine-time individual state champion with four 100-meter titles, three 200-meter titles, one 400-meter title and one long jump title.

Richards-Ross attended the University of Texas, Austin from 2002 to 2005, majoring in business and starring on the women&#x27;s track and field team.

==Career==

===2003–2005===
Representing the University of Texas in 2003, Richards-Ross became the first freshman to win the NCAA national championship in the 400 meters and the 4 × 400 meters relay. Her victory in 400 meters set the then American U20 record of 50.58 seconds. Later that June, at eighteen years old, the freshman Longhorn claimed her first senior national title by winning the 400 meters in 51.01 seconds at the 2003 U.S. national championships and qualified for the 2003 Paris World Championships. In Paris, she finished fourth in her 400 meters semi-final and did not move on to the final. However, Richards-Ross still came home with a gold medal in the 4 × 400 meters relay after anchoring Team USA to a victory.

Richards-Ross qualified for her first Olympic team by running 49.89 seconds to place second in the 400 meters at the 2004 U.S. Olympic trials. In the 2004 Olympic 400 meters final, Richards-Ross finished sixth with a time of 50.19 seconds, behind her two American compatriots DeeDee Trotter and Monique Hennagan, who both missed the podium as well. The American women sought redemption from their disappointing run by winning gold in the 4 × 400 meters relay, days later. After leaving Athens, Richards-Ross forwent her college eligibility at Texas, competing as a Nike-sponsored athlete and training under the then head track and field coach of Baylor University, Clyde Hart.

At the 2005 Helsinki World Championships, 20-year-old Richards-Ross failed to maintain the lead coming off the second curve in the 400 meters final and was passed by the 2004 Olympic champion Tonique Williams-Darling of the Bahamas, who won with a season&#x27;s best of 49.55 seconds. Richards-Ross attributed the difficult loss to her inexperience as a young professional athlete, fixating on beating her main competitor before the final 100 meters instead of trusting her established race strategy. Reverting to her predetermined race plan, she dipped under 49 seconds for the first time with a personal best of 48.92 seconds, the fastest time in the world that year, in Zürich, a race that also featured the newly crowned world champion Williams-Darling.

===2006–2008===
Pursuit of the American 400 meters record, set at 48.83 seconds by Valerie Brisco-Hooks, became Richards-Ross&#x27; goal of the 2006 season. Leading into the World Cup race in Athens, the American woman was on a dominant win-streak and held the world-leading time of 49.05 seconds. She finished the World Cup race in 48.70 seconds, replacing Brisco-Hooks as the new American record holder in the 400 meters. At the time, this personal best ranked her as the seventh-fastest woman ever at the distance. Richards-Ross and her training partner Jeremy Wariner were awarded the 2006 Jesse Owens Award by USA Track and Field after both were undefeated for the entire season and each won their $250,000 portion of the IAAF Golden League. Athletes who win all six Golden League meets in an event claim a share of the $1 million jackpot.

For the 2007 season, Richards-Ross decided to expand her résumé, racing more 200-meter sprints and testing her ability to possibly pursue the rare 200–400 meters double Olympic victory in Beijing the following year. Only a handful of athletes have ever achieved such a feat, including Michael Johnson, her coach Clyde Hart&#x27;s world-record-setting pupil. Things strayed from her plan, as she finished fourth in the 400 meters event at the 2007 U.S. national championships, only qualifying for the 2007 Osaka World Championships by placing second in the 200 meters, behind reigning 200 meters world champion Allyson Felix. In Osaka, Richards-Ross ran 22.70 seconds to finish fifth, as teammate Felix successfully defended her title from two years prior. Both American women reunited for the women&#x27;s 4 × 400 meters relay, helping Team USA win gold, ahead of the Jamaican team and the British team, which featured the new 400 meters world champion Christine Ohuruogu and 400 meters silver medalist Nicola Sanders. Despite failing to qualify in her signature event at the national championships and leaving Osaka with only a spectator&#x27;s memory of the individual race, the 23-year-old American woman still finished the year undefeated in the six Golden League 400-meter races and with the number one world ranking. Reflecting on her season, she admitted that losing focus on the quarter-mile race was the reason for her defeat, after constantly shifting mindsets and strategies to race the 100, 200, and 400 meters throughout the season.

Coming into 2008, despite being among the most prolific sub-50 second 400-meter sprinters of the decade, Richards-Ross had yet to win any individual world or Olympic title. Up until then, she had run a total of 27 races below the 50-second barrier. After winning the 2008 U.S. Olympic trials, Richards-Ross was favored to win gold at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. However, in Beijing, Richards-Ross faltered, coming off the curve with a significant lead and having nothing left to come home. She held on for the bronze medal as Christine Ohuruogu of Great Britain and Shericka Williams of Jamaica surged ahead. Richards-Ross later avenged her individual loss by making up a ten-meter deficit in the women&#x27;s 4 × 400 meters relay and catching the Russian sprinter on the anchor leg right before the finish line, allowing the United States to win by a 0.28-second margin.

Throughout her career, Richards-Ross answered questions regarding the 2008 Olympic 400 meters race with self-described half-truths, attributing her loss to a sudden right hamstring injury, lack of sleep, or fate. In her 2017 memoir &quot;Chasing Grace: What the Quarter Mile Taught Me about God and Life&quot;, she finally revealed the underlying reason for her disappointing loss at the 2008 Olympics; one month before the games, Richards-Ross discovered that she was pregnant and decided to terminate the pregnancy the day before leaving for Beijing. A devout Christian woman and a world-class athlete at the prime of her career, she endured much physical and emotional turmoil following her difficult decision, even into the 2008 Olympics, as explicated in the book: &quot;I made a decision that broke me, and one from which I would not immediately heal from. Abortion would now forever be a part of my life. A scarlet letter I never thought I&#x27;d wear.&quot;

===2009–2011===

With the echoes of her Beijing loss still lingering into 2009, Richards-Ross began working with a sports psychologist, at the urging of coach Clyde Hart, to overcome her bouts of anxiety and emotional anguish. Her efforts on the track coupled with her mental preparation made a difference as the 2009 season became her most successful to date. Richards-Ross won the 400 meters U.S. national title in 50.05 seconds, 0.74 seconds over second-place finisher Debbie Dunn, and qualified for the 2009 Berlin World Championships. In Berlin, she won her first global 400 meters title by dominating the 400 meters final from start to finish, winning in 49.00 seconds and proving to her critics that she could perform on the sport&#x27;s biggest stages. The newly crowned world champion then anchored Team USA to a gold medal in the women&#x27;s 4 × 400 meters relay. The winning time of 3.17.83 minutes was the sixth-fastest time in history, up until then, with Richards-Ross unofficially splitting 48.43 seconds on her anchor leg. 

Upon leaving Berlin, Richards-Ross returned to the track to continue her 2009 IAAF Golden League win streak. In addition to winning the Berlin meet in 49.57 seconds, Oslo in 49.23 seconds, Rome in 49.46 seconds, and Paris in 49.34 seconds, all before the world championships, she claimed victory again in the last two Golden League meets in Zürich and Brussels, with times of 48.94 seconds and 48.83 seconds, respectively. This was her third time sweeping the IAAF Golden League meets, a feat she accomplished in 2006 and 2007 as well, allowing her to once again earn a share of the $1 million jackpot. After a 49.95-second win in the 400 meters IAAF World Athletics Final meet, she broke Marita Koch&#x27;s record for the most career sub-50 second performances, surpassing Koch&#x27;s total of 35 with her own total of 41. Her only defeat this season, in any event, was to the now three-time defending 200-meter world champion Allyson Felix at the IAAF World Athletics Final in the 200 meters, with the victor discerned via photo finish and Richards-Ross declared second in an identical time of 22.29 seconds. To cap off the successful season, the 24-year-old American woman, along with Usain Bolt, were named the 2009 IAAF World Athlete of Year.

The next two outdoor seasons, however, proved to be difficult and disappointing for the defending world champion. A quad injury right before the 2010 Penn Relays forced Richards-Ross to prematurely end her 2010 season to rest and regroup. She bounced back in 2011 to run a 49.66-second 400 meters race at the London Diamond League meet, just prior to the 2011 Daegu World Championships, sparking some optimism of rounding back into top form in time for the major competition. In Daegu, Richards-Ross struggled to find her rhythm as she narrowly qualified for the 400 meters final and then wounded up seventh in a time of 51.32 seconds. She later returned in the 4 × 400 meters relay, this time running the lead-off leg in 49.1 seconds and setting the U.S. women up for victory.

===2012===
====Road to London====
Healthy and well-rested, Richards-Ross began her 2012 quest for the coveted individual Olympic gold medal by racing a full indoor schedule to warm up for her outdoor debut. With four wins in four indoor races under her belt coming into the 2012 IAAF World Indoor Championships, she secured a resounding 400-meter victory in Istanbul with a time of 50.79 seconds, 0.97 seconds ahead of the Russian runner-up. Her first indoor world title ushered in some much-needed confidence as the outdoor season began. Richards-Ross decisively won the 400-meter final at the 2012 U.S. Olympic trials, tying the Olympic trials record of 49.28 seconds and earning a berth to her third consecutive Olympics. Longtime teammate DeeDee Trotter and the 2011 world bronze medalist Francena McCorory finished second and third, respectively, and joined her on the 400 meters team. Later at the trials, Richards-Ross also finished third in the 200-meter sprint in 22.22 seconds, allowing her to attempt the rare 200 meter-400 meter double at the 2012 London Olympics.

Once again, heading into the Olympic Games as the 400-meter favorite, she shouldered the same pressure and expectations, but this time, Richards-Ross was prepared to maintain her serenity amidst the vortex. Stiff competition lined up for the 400 meters final in London, including the defending 2008 Olympic champion Christine Ohuruogu of Great Britain, 2011 world champion Amantle Montsho of Botswana, and Antonina Krivoshapka of Russia, who held the world-leading time of 49.16 seconds. From the sound of the gun, Richards-Ross executed a race opposite of the one four years ago, pushing hard out of the blocks before relaxing into a comfortable stride down the backstretch and entering the homestretch in the third position, behind Krivoshapka and DeeDee Trotter. The U.S. champion willed her legs to pull ahead of the field with fifty meters left of the race and in the final moments, which almost mirrored the 2008 race in Beijing as Ohuruogu closed down quickly on the leading American, Richards-Ross held on to win in 49.55 seconds, finally earning the gold medal that had long eluded her. This victory became the first time an American woman had won the event in 28 years, since Valerie Brisco-Hooks in 1984. Despite a fifth-place finish later in the 200 meters final, the newly crowned Olympic champion concluded the Games by running 49.1 seconds on the anchor leg of the victorious U.S. women&#x27;s 4 × 400 meters relay team and left London with two gold medals.

====Opposition to Rule 40====

Throughout the Olympic season, Richards-Ross had appeared at the forefront of an athlete-driven &quot;#WeDemandChange&quot; movement advocating against the International Olympic Committee&#x27;s (IOC) controversial Rule 40, a regulation that forbids Olympic athletes and coaches from acknowledging personal, non-Olympic sponsors by name, wearing additional logos on apparel, or promoting them on social media two weeks before or during the Olympic Games. The rule strived to prevent ambush marketing and concentrate viewer attention on messages from official Olympic sponsors, such as Coca-Cola and Visa, which had paid a hefty amount for exclusive partnerships with the Games, although none of the multi-billion dollar revenue trickled into athletes&#x27; pockets. Prior to the London Olympics, she sparked a discussion on the topic, tweeting, &quot;With $6 billion exchanging hands during the Olympics why do the athletes compete for free?!? &quot;#QuestionsThatNeedAnswers&quot; &quot;#WeDemandChange&quot;.&quot; Since track and field professionals earn the vast majority of their income through sponsorship deals, Rule 40 prevents them from thanking personal sponsors for their endorsement and also dissuades potential non-Olympic sponsors from investing in these athletes when the sport is receiving the most attention.

Starting on July 29, 2012, a group of U.S. track and field athletes, including Trey Hardee, Bernard Lagat, Nick Symmonds, and Dawn Harper-Nelson, coordinated a Twitter campaign to criticize the restriction on athletes&#x27; rights, posting messages with hashtags &quot;#WeDemandChange&quot;, &quot;#Rule40&quot;, and &quot;#WeDemandChange2012&quot;. Richards-Ross spoke at a news conference regarding the &quot;#WeDemandChange&quot; campaign on the following day and explained that although she was fortunate to have secured major sponsorships to continue her training and treatment, many athletes have to work two or three jobs to be able to afford to stay in the sport. Answering conference reporters, she said, &quot;I’ve been very fortunate to do very well around the Olympics, but so many of my peers struggle in the sport, and I think it&#x27;s unjust that they&#x27;re not being considered, that athletes are not part of the conversation.&quot; At the Olympic Village in London, Richards-Ross helped organize a group of track and field athletes to share their concerns, further their message to the IOC, and discuss potential regulation amendments to accommodate the athletes, with several options including permission to post sponsors on social media, clearance to wear non-Olympic sponsor logos, and IOC-funded prize money. Efforts by these track and field athletes, along with later campaigns voicing Olympic athletes&#x27; discontent, finally pushed to the IOC to slightly amend Rule 40 for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, allowing athletes to promote personal sponsors and appear in their advertisements during the Games, within specific guidelines.

===2015–Retirement===
Following two surgeries to correct a persistent toe problem, Richards-Ross injured her calf muscle right before the 2015 U.S. national championships, which lead her to finish fifth in her semi-final and prevent her from qualifying for the 2015 Beijing World Championships. Despite not making the individual team, the track veteran was still selected to be on the women&#x27;s 4 × 400 meters relay in Beijing. There, she ran a 51.5-second leg to help the United States team win silver. Richards-Ross admitted later that overtraining, as she was approaching the closing stages of her career, might have contributed to the rapid decline in the latter part of the season.

2016 began with the official announcement of her retirement by the end of the track season. Still in recovery from a third toe surgery, the reigning 400-meter Olympic champion suffered an injury to her right hamstring at the 2016 U.S. Olympic trials, prompting her to discontinue the race and salute the Hayward Field crowd one last time. Shortly after retiring, Richards-Ross joined the NBC broadcasting team as a track and field analyst for major events, such as the 2016, 2020, and 2024 Summer Olympics.

==Personal life==
While attending the University of Texas, Richards-Ross began dating Longhorn football cornerback Aaron Ross, who later won two Super Bowls with the New York Giants of the NFL. The two were engaged in 2007 and married in 2010. Their wedding was featured on an episode of &quot;Platinum Weddings&quot;. The pair welcomed their first child, Aaron Jermaine Ross II, in 2017, and announced in July 2023 that they were expecting their second child, later revealed to be a boy in September 2023. In February 23, 2025, the couple expecting their third child together.

For five years, Richards-Ross suffered from severe onsets of mouth ulcers, joint aches, and full-body skin lesions, which in 2007, doctors initially thought were caused by a rare, chronic disease involving the inflammation of blood vessels called Behçet&#x27;s disease. She began donning compression arm sleeves in competition to hide her ulcerated skin, but as a fashion enthusiast, later embraced the extra garment as part of her trademark look.

Exploring new opportunities off the track, in 2013, Richards-Ross premiered her WE tv reality TV show &quot;Glam and Gold&quot;, a docu-series that followed her as she juggled appearances, ran businesses, trained for the track season, and balanced life with her husband and family. Primarily shot at their home in Austin, the series also visited Florida, New York, and Jamaica, where she took Team SRR for an Olympic victory lap and celebration.

<text>Guido Ulrich Buchwald (pronounced &#x27;Buckwild&#x27;) (born 24 January 1961) is a German former professional football player. Throughout his career he played as a defender. He is currently director of football of Stuttgarter Kickers.

The best game of Buchwald&#x27;s career was the final of the 1990 FIFA World Cup victory for West Germany against Argentina where he effectively marked Diego Maradona for almost the entire match, earning him the nickname &quot;Diego&quot;. His other nickname, &#x27;Bucky&#x27; is due to his unconventional name. He was also part of Germany&#x27;s disappointing 1994 FIFA World Cup campaign and collected in his career 76 caps.

==Career==
Buchwald began his professional football career in 1983 with VfB Stuttgart. He played 325 games in the German Bundesliga for this club, scoring 28 goals. The low-point of his career was in 1986 when coach Franz Beckenbauer did not include him in his team for the World Cup in Mexico. He was however part of the squad which won the World Cup in Italy four years later.

The same year Stuttgart lost the final of the German Cup against Bayern Munich and in 1989 the final of the UEFA Cup was also lost, but they managed to win two German championships (1984, 1992).

His personal highlight in his Bundesliga career was on the last day of play in the 1991–92 season, when he scored the deciding goal against Bayer Leverkusen that won Stuttgart the match and the Championship – just six minutes before the games&#x27; end.

In 1994, he signed with the Japanese team Urawa Red Diamonds before returning to Germany in 1998 to help Karlsruher SC avoid relegation. He could not save the team and after one more season playing in the second division he retired but stayed with the club as a director of sports.

==After retirement==
After a stop with the Stuttgarter Kickers (again as director of sports) he went back to Japan where he was managing his old club. He led his team to the &quot;closing&quot; championship.
In 2005, won the title on Emperor&#x27;s Cup.
In 2006, he won the title on both J-League and Emperor&#x27;s Cup.

Buchwald then returned to Germany to become manager of Alemannia Aachen.
After five months on duty he was fired by club management on 26 November 2007.

On 1 November 2010, Buchwald returned to the Stuttgarter Kickers as a member of the board responsible for the first team. He took over as interim manager in November 2012 after the sacking of Dirk Schuster, before relinquishing this duty a month later when Gerd Dais was appointed.

<doc id="1030123" wikidata="Q5552828" url="?curid=1030123" title="Green Hill Zone">
<text>is the first level of the platform game &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;, which released for the Sega Genesis in 1991. The level is grassy and lush, with environmental features such as palm trees, vertical loops and cliffs, and is the home of numerous forest animals. Like the game&#x27;s other levels, Green Hill Zone comprises three acts; in the third, Sonic fights antagonist Doctor Eggman before moving to the second level, Marble Zone. It was constructed by level designer Hirokazu Yasuhara with its musical theme by Masato Nakamura.

Green Hill Zone is considered to be a classic video game level, akin to the first stage of &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;, World 1-1. The level and its music have also received positive opinions from critics. It has appeared in other games in the series, such as &quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot;, &quot;Sonic Generations&quot;, &quot;Sonic Mania&quot;, &quot;Sonic Forces&quot;, and &quot;Sonic Frontiers&quot;. Critics have noted a Green Hill Zone-like aesthetic in levels of other games.

==Description==
Green Hill Zone is the first level of &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;. Located on South Island, it is a lush, grassy stage with unique features like droopy palm trees and crumbling cliffs. In addition, as with later levels in the game, Green Hill Zone has environmental features and obstacles like ramps, vertical loops, tunnels, spring-boards, spikes, and checkpoints. It is normally populated by woodland creatures, but antagonist Doctor Eggman imprisons them inside robots known as Badniks prior to the events of the game, so the player must destroy them to free the animals. Green Hill Zone consists of three acts, and the end of Act 3 features a boss battle with Robotnik. After beating Robotnik, Sonic moves on to the second level, the lava-themed Marble Zone.

== Development ==

&quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; was created by the newly formed Sonic Team, a 15-member Sega subsidiary formed to create a character that could compete with Nintendo&#x27;s Mario. The game&#x27;s level design was handled by Hirokazu Yasuhara, and the musical theme was composed by Masato Nakamura, bassist from the J-pop band Dreams Come True. In designing Green Hill Zone, Yasuhara was inspired by the U.S. state of California, while the game&#x27;s color scheme in general was influenced by the work of pop artist Eizin Suzuki.

The game&#x27;s programmer, Yuji Naka, stated that it took him almost a year to create Green Hill Zone and that it was created and destroyed multiple times before arriving at the final version.

== Appearances ==

While the original game was a 2D side-scroller, Green Hill Zone was remade in full 3D as a secret level in the 2001 game &quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot;; the player unlocks it after collecting all 180 of the emblems found by completing the game&#x27;s many objectives. The 2011 game &quot;Sonic Generations&quot;, a title that revisits past entries in the &quot;Sonic&quot; series, features both 2D (&quot;Classic&quot;) and 3D (&quot;Modern&quot;) versions of Green Hill Zone, as well as of numerous other &quot;Sonic&quot; levels. A reinterpretation of the level appears in the 2017 title &quot;Sonic Mania&quot;. Green Hill Zone reappears in &quot;Sonic Forces&quot;, having partially turned to desert due to resource depletion by Eggman&#x27;s industries. Digital recreations of Green Hill Zone appear in the 2022 game &quot;Sonic Frontiers&quot; as part of the game&#x27;s Cyber Space levels.

In addition, Green Hill Zone appears as a stage in the 2.5D fighting game &quot;Sonic Battle&quot;, in the tennis video game &quot;Sega Superstars Tennis&quot;, in the sports video game &quot;Mario &amp; Sonic at the Sochi 2014 Olympic Winter Games&quot;, in the mobile title &quot;Sonic Dash&quot;, in the crossover adventure game &quot;Lego Dimensions&quot;, and in the crossover fighting games &quot;Dengeki Bunko: Fighting Climax&quot; and the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series. In the 2020 live-action film adaptation &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;, Green Hill Zone is depicted as Sonic&#x27;s original home. The film series also features Sonic and friends living in a small town in Montana named Green Hills.

== Merchandise ==
A Lego Ideas set based on the level was released on January 1, 2022. It received mixed reception from Alice Clarke of &quot;Kotaku&quot;, who called it &quot;not the most thrilling build&quot;, remarking that its price was high, but that &quot;Sonic&quot; fans would love it.

==Reception==
Green Hill Zone has been recognized by critics as a classic, well-known video game level. It has been described as &quot;classic&quot; by Samit Sarkar of &quot;Polygon&quot; and by Jim Sterling and Chris Carter of &quot;Destructoid&quot;. Comparably, Joe Skrebels of &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot; called it &quot;nostalgic&quot;, while Christopher Grant from &quot;Joystiq&quot; considered it to have a place &quot;in the center of your retro-gaming shrine&quot;. Kevin Wong of &quot;Complex&quot; stated that the game&#x27;s and level&#x27;s popularity were such that &quot;even if you didn&#x27;t have a Genesis, this was the level you played at the department store while your parents went shopping.&quot; Craig Snyder at &quot;MakeUseOf&quot; named the level as one of the five best levels in video games, calling it &quot;a great way to prepare for what’s to come&quot;. 

The level&#x27;s background music was particularly noted as memorable. Andy Kelly from &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; called the Green Hill theme a &quot;monumental slice of Sega nostalgia&quot;, and &quot;GamesRadar&quot; writer Justin Towell also referred to it as classic. &quot;Game Informer&quot;″s Tim Turi found the level&#x27;s music &quot;catchy&quot;, and Wong ranked it as the thirteenth greatest piece of gaming music from the 16-bit era.

== Legacy ==
Later &quot;Sonic&quot; games often included callbacks to Green Hill Zone. Turi noted that Emerald Hill Zone from &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&quot;, Mushroom Hill Zone from &quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot;, and Seaside Hill Zone from &quot;Sonic Heroes&quot; all fit the same general mold as Green Hill Zone, claiming that &quot;gamers have played Green Hill Zone dozens of times.&quot; However, he opined that the &quot;Sonic Generations&quot; version of the original Green Hill Zone &quot;trounces them all&quot; in both its 2D and 3D incarnations. Justin Baker of &quot;Nintendo World Report&quot; and Skrebels both analogized Windy Hill Zone from &quot;Sonic Lost World&quot; to Green Hill Zone, while Carter thought similarly of &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; downloadable content levels. The decision to include Green Hill Zone in other games in the series, such as &quot;Sonic Forces&quot;, has been a source of debate among some fans, who believe that Sega has overused the stage since its debut.

The version of Green Hill Zone featured in &quot;Sonic Mania&quot; became one of that game&#x27;s most &quot;hotly contested&quot; speedrun courses due to its added complexity in comparison to the original. The fastest route through the level was noted as constantly shifting between the top, middle, or bottom segments as speedrunners further optimized the path. Trihex, a notable speedrunner, called the level &quot;a monster&quot; due to its difficulty, including timed platforms.

To mark Sonic&#x27;s fifteenth anniversary in 2006, Sega released a papercraft version of Green Hill Zone as a PDF on its website. In 2011, not long after the release of &quot;Sonic Generations&quot;, Sega held a contest inviting gamers to upload YouTube video playthroughs of the game&#x27;s 3D version of Green Hill Zone completed in less than one minute and fifty seconds; winners were eligible for &quot;Sonic&quot; merchandise.

During the 30th anniversary of &quot;Sonic&quot;, Nakamura and Dreams Come True released &quot;Tsugi no Se~no! De - On The Green Hill - DCT version&quot;, a single of the Green Hill Zone theme which introduced lyrics to the theme for the first time was released on July 7, 2021. A music video followed just a few months after the single&#x27;s release in September of that year. An alternate version of the track with more Genesis/Megadrive sounding instruments was released sometime after the single and was titled the &quot;Masado &amp; Miwasco version&quot;.

<doc id="1030125" wikidata="Q334092" url="?curid=1030125" title="Gerard Lake, 1st Viscount Lake">
<text>Gerard Lake, 1st Viscount Lake (27 July 1744 – 20 February 1808) was a British general. He commanded British forces during the Irish Rebellion of 1798 and later served as Commander-in-Chief of the military in British India.

==Background==
He was the son of Lancelot Charles Lake (d. 1751) of Harrow-on-the-Hill and his wife Letitia Gumley, daughter of John Gumley. He was educated at Eton College.

Lake entered the foot guards in 1758, becoming lieutenant (captain in the army) in 1762, captain (lieutenant-colonel) in 1776, major in 1784, and lieutenant colonel in 1792, by which time he was a general officer in the army. He served with his regiment in Germany between 1760 and 1762, and with a composite battalion in the Battle of Yorktown of 1781. After this he was equerry to the Prince of Wales, afterwards George IV. His younger brother Warwick served as a groom of the bedchamber for the Prince, and later oversaw his stables of racehorses.

In 1790, he became a major-general, and in 1793 was appointed to command the Guards Brigade in the Duke of York and Albany&#x27;s army in Flanders during the French Revolutionary Wars. He was in command at the successful Battle of Lincelles on 18 August 1793, and served on the continent (except for a short time when seriously ill) until April 1794. He later sold his lieutenant-colonelcy in the guards, and became colonel of the 53rd Regiment of Foot and governor of Limerick in Ireland. In 1797, he was promoted to lieutenant-general.

==American War of Independence==
As lieutenant-colonel Lake went out with drafts to America in the spring of 1781, made the campaign in North Carolina under Lord Cornwallis, and commanded the grenadiers of the guards and of the old 80th royal Edinburgh regiment in a sortie, under Colonel Robert Abercromby, from the British lines at York Town, which inflicted heavy loss on the French and American besiegers, on 11 October. After the surrender of Cornwallis&#x27;s force on 19 October 1781, Lake remained prisoner on parole until the end of the war. Hugh Wodehouse Pearse reports that &quot;Lake was one of the three field officers selected by lot to take charge of the troops in captivity, but, as he was anxious for private reasons to proceed to England, Major Gordon of the 76th [80th] Regiment generously volunteered to take his place. Major, then Lieut.-Colonel, Gordon died in captivity.

== 1798 rebellion in Ireland ==
In December 1796, he was appointed commander in Ulster and issued a proclamation ordering the surrender of all arms by the civil population, during which time he was &#x27;untroubled by legal restraints or by his troops&#x27; violent actions&#x27;. Historians have generally seen Lake&#x27;s &quot;Dragooning of Ulster&quot; in 1797 as effective in disarming and crippling the Society of United Irishmen in that province, although his effectiveness has been questioned. Lake succeeded Sir Ralph Abercromby as Commander-in-Chief, Ireland in April 1798 and turned his attention to Leinster, where &#x27;public floggings and torture of suspected rebels became widespread and added to the general atmosphere of terror&#x27;. Rather than cowing the province into submission, &#x27;his crude methods probably contributed to the outbreak of insurrection&#x27; in May 1798. Lake continued to deal harshly with opposition, and issued orders to take no prisoners during the rebellion.

In May, Lake commanded troops in County Kildare, and, after the unsuccessful rebel attack on Naas on 24 May, he assisted General Ralph Dundas in ensuring the rebel surrender after the Battle of Kilcullen, which Dundas arranged on humane terms. Another rebel force on the nearby Curragh were also persuaded to surrender, but while this was being arranged by Lake the rebels were mistakenly attacked by separate government forces coming from the opposite direction, resulting in the Gibbet Rath executions on 29 May. As a result, central Kildare remained quiet for the rest of 1798.

Lake then took overall command of a force of some 20,000 troops to crush the Wexford rebels and defeated the main rebel army at Vinegar Hill (near Enniscorthy, County Wexford) on 21 June. His harsh treatment towards Irish rebels found bearing arms brought him into conflict with Lord Cornwallis who was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in June 1798 and instituted an amnesty act to encourage rebels to lay down their arms.

Cornwallis sent Lake to oppose a French expedition of 1,000 troops which had landed at Killala Bay, County Mayo on 23 August. On 29 August, Lake arrived at Castlebar with a force of 1,700 (composed of mainly of militia, fencibles and yeomanry) and witnessed the rout of his troops under General Hely-Hutchinson (afterwards 2nd Earl of Donoughmore) at the Battle of Castlebar. Lake failed to rally his largely inexperienced troops and was forced to retreat to Tuam; the speed of which (and abandonment of material, artillery and Lake&#x27;s personal baggage) led the rout to become known as the &#x27;Races of Castlebar&#x27;. Hely-Hutchinson shouldered much of the blame, but it was accepted that Lake&#x27;s troops were inexperienced and a head-on battle with the seasoned French force was probably to be avoided. However, rumours also abounded that Lake had been drinking heavily the night before the battle and was only woken with difficulty while the French were already attacking.

He defeated the French at the Battle of Ballinamuck on 8 September.

== Indian campaigns ==
In 1799, Lake returned to England, and soon afterwards travelled to British India where he was appointed Commander-in-Chief. He took up his duties at Calcutta in July 1801, and applied himself to the improvement of the East India Company army, especially in the direction of making all arms, infantry, cavalry and artillery, more mobile and more manageable. In 1802 he was made a full general.

On the outbreak the Second Anglo-Maratha War in 1803 General Lake took the field against Daulat Scindia, and within two months defeated the Marathas at Kol (now called Aligarh), after storming Aligarh Fort during the Battle of Ally Ghur (1 September 1803). He then took Delhi (11September) and Agra (10October), and won a victory at the Battle of Laswari (1 November), where the power of Scindia was completely broken with the loss of 31 disciplined battalions, trained and officered by Frenchmen, and 426 pieces of ordnance. This defeat, followed a few days later by Major-General Arthur Wellesley&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Argaon, compelled Scindia to come to terms, and a treaty was signed in December 1803.

Operations continued against Yashwantrao Holkar, who, on 17 November 1804, defeated Lake at the Battle of Farrukhabad. Lake was now very frustrated by the Jats and Yashwantrao Holker at Bharatpur which held out against five assaults early in 1805. Cornwallis succeeded Lord Wellesley as Governor-General of India in July of that year – superseding Lake at the same time as commander-in-chief – and determined to put an end to the war. Cornwallis, however, died in October of the same year and Lake pursued Holkar into the Punjab. However, after seeing the stronger position of Holkar and his effort to gather all Indian princes under one flag against the British, the British East India Company signed a peace treaty with Holkar which returned to him all his territory and promised no further interference from the Company.

Lord Wellesley in a despatch attributed much of the success of the war to Lake&#x27;s matchless energy, ability and valour. For his services, Lake received the thanks of Parliament, and, in September 1804, was rewarded by being created Baron Lake of Delhi and Laswary and of Aston Clinton in the County of Buckingham. From 1801 to 1805 Lake was Commander-in-Chief, India, then again from 1805 to 1807 as his successor John Graves Simcoe had died before heading off to India. At the conclusion of the war he returned to England, and in 1807 he was created Viscount Lake of Delhi and Laswary and of Aston Clinton in the County of Buckingham.

One of his sons Major George Augustus Frederick Lake accompanied him in Ireland and then India, acting as his aide-de-camp and military secretary during the campaign: at one stage offering his mount when the elder Lake&#x27;s horse had been shot from under him at an engagement near the village of Mohaulpoor. Minutes after seeing his father mounted Major Lake was seriously wounded in the presence of his father. Lake recovered from his wound and went on to command the 29th Regiment of Foot during the Peninsular Campaign. He was killed in action at the Battle of Roliça, Portugal on 17 August 1808.

== Parliamentary career ==
Lake pursued both a parliamentary and military career. He represented Aylesbury in the British House of Commons from 1790 to 1802, and he also was brought into the Irish House of Commons by the government as member for Armagh Borough in 1799 to vote for the Act of Union.

== Later years ==
Lake was recorded as being an inveterate gambler who lost most of his family&#x27;s fortune. He died in London on 20 February 1808 leaving his children with little or no inheritance. This was seen by many at court and the then prime minister the Duke of Portland, as a sad end for such a stalwart of Empire and his children. Portland made a special request to King George III to remedy the situation, particularly with respect to the unmarried Lake daughters.

<text>The German Air Force (, ) is the aerial warfare branch of the , the armed forces of Germany. The German Air Force (as part of the ) was founded in 1956 during the era of the Cold War as the aerial warfare branch of the armed forces of West Germany. After the reunification of West and East Germany in 1990, it integrated parts of the air force of the former German Democratic Republic, which itself had been founded in 1956 as part of the National People&#x27;s Army. There is no organizational continuity between the current German Air Force and the former Luftwaffe of the Wehrmacht founded in 1935, which was completely disbanded in 1945/46 after World War II. The term that is used for both the historic and the current German air force is the German-language generic designation of any air force.

The commander of the German Air Force is Lieutenant General Ingo Gerhartz. As of 2015, the German Air Force uses eleven air bases, two of which host no flying units. Furthermore, the Air Force has a presence at three civil airports. In 2012, the German Air Force had an authorized strength of 28,475 active airmen and 4,914 reservists.

==History==
After World War II, German aviation was severely curtailed, and military aviation was completely forbidden after the Allied Control Commission disbanded the Nazi-era in August 1946. This changed in 1955 when West Germany joined NATO, as the Western Allies believed that Germany was needed to counter the increasing military threat posed by the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies. Therefore, on 9 January 1956, a new German Air Force called was founded as a branch of the new .

Many well-known fighter pilots of the ″s joined the new post-war air force and underwent refresher training in the US before returning to West Germany to upgrade on the latest U.S.-supplied hardware. These included Erich Hartmann, Gerhard Barkhorn, Günther Rall and Johannes Steinhoff. Steinhoff became commander-in-chief of the , with Rall as his immediate successor. Another pilot of World War II, Josef Kammhuber, also made a significant career in the post-war , retiring in 1962 as Chief Inspector of the Air Force ().

Despite the partial reliance of the new air force on airmen who had served in the ″s air arm, there was no organizational continuity between the old and the new . This is in line with the policy of the on the whole, which does not consider itself a successor of the and does not follow the traditions of any other previous German military organization.

===First years===
The first volunteers of the arrived at the Nörvenich Air Base in January 1956. In the same year, the was given with its first aircraft, the US-made Republic F-84 Thunderstreak. At first, the was divided into two operational commands, one in Northern Germany, aligned with the British-led Second Allied Tactical Air Force, and the other in Southern Germany, aligned with the American-led Fourth Allied Tactical Air Force.

In 1957, the took command of the Army Air Defence Troops located in Rendsburg and began the expansion of its own air defense missile capabilities. The first squadron to be declared operational was the Air Transport Wing 61 at Erding Air Base, followed by the 31st Fighter-Bomber Squadron at Büchel Air Base. In 1958, the received its first conscripts. In 1959, the declared the 11th Missile Group in Kaufbeuren armed with MGM-1 Matador surface-to-surface tactical nuclear cruise missiles operational. The same year Fighter Wing 71 () equipped with Canadair CL-13 fighters became operational at Ahlhorner Heide Air Base. All aircraft sported—and continue to sport—the Iron Cross on the fuselage, harking back to the pre-March 1918 days of World War I, while the national flag of West Germany is displayed on the tail.

===Cold War===

In 1963, the saw its first major reorganization. The two operational Air Force Group Commands – Command North and Command South were both split into two mixed Air Force divisions containing flying and air defense units and one Support division. Additionally, a 7th Air Force division was raised in Schleswig-Holstein containing flying units, missile units, support units, and the German Navy&#x27;s naval aviation and placed under command of Allied Forces Baltic Approaches.

In 1960, the received its first Lockheed F-104 Starfighter jets. The Starfighter remained in service for the entire duration of the Cold War, with the last being taken out of service in 1991. The received 916 Starfighters, 292 of which crashed, resulting in the deaths of 116 pilots. The disastrous service record of the Starfighter led to the Starfighter crisis in 1966 as a reaction to 27 Starfighter crashes with 17 casualties in 1965 alone. The West German public referred to the Starfighter as the (widow-maker), (flying coffin), (falling fighter) and (tent peg, literally &quot;ground nail&quot;).

On 25 August 1966, the German Defence Minister Kai-Uwe von Hassel relieved the Chief Inspector of the Air Force &quot;Generalleutnant&quot; Werner Panitzki, and transferred Colonel Erich Hartmann, commanding officer of the 71st Fighter Squadron, as both had publicly criticized the acquisition of the Starfighter as a &quot;purely political decision&quot;. On 2 September 1966, Johannes Steinhoff, with Günther Rall as deputy, became the new Chief Inspector of the Air Force. Steinhoff and his deputy Günther Rall noted that the non-German F-104s proved much safer. The Americans blamed the high loss rate of the F-104s on the extremely low-level and aggressive flying of German pilots rather than any faults in the aircraft. Steinhoff and Rall went to America to learn to fly the Starfighter under Lockheed instruction and noted some specifics in the training (a lack of mountain and foggy-weather training), combined with handling capabilities (rapidly initiated, high G turns) of the aircraft that could cause accidents. Steinhoff and Rall, therefore, changed the training regimen for the F-104 pilots, and the accident rates fell to those comparable or better than other air forces. They also brought about the high level of training and professionalism seen today throughout the , and the start of a strategic direction for pilots to engage in tactical and combat training outside of Germany. However, the F-104 never lived down its reputation as a &quot;widow-maker&quot;, and was replaced by the with the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II fighter and the Panavia Tornado fighter-bomber in many units much earlier than in other national air forces.

On Steinhoff&#x27;s initiative, the opened the German Air Force Command USA/Canada () in Fort Bliss, where the trained its missile and air defense troops, and pilots received their basic training. At the same time, the opened a Tactical Training Command in Beja, Portugal, where pilots were trained in Close Air Support missions.

Between 1967 and 1970, the undertook a major reorganization of its forces. The two operational commands were disbanded and the four mixed Air Force divisions were divided into two flying divisions and two air defense divisions. The remainder of the units were divided into functional commands:
* Air Force Operation Command (), with the signal regiments, the radar, and the signals intelligence units
* Air Force Training Command (), with the schools and training regiments
* Air Force Support Command (), with all logistical, maintenance, and repair units, and the Material Office of the Air Force
* Air Force Transport Command (), with the air transport squadrons.

Over the next decade, the received large amounts of new equipment, including in 1968 the first C-160 Transall transport planes, in 1974 the F-4 Phantom II fighter-bombers, in 1978 the first Alpha Jet Version A light attack jets and in 1979 the first of 212 Panavia Tornado fighters.

In 1986, the air defense forces began to replace their Nike Hercules missile systems with state-of-the-art surface-to-air missile systems: first to arrive was the MIM-104 Patriot system, followed one year later by Roland short-range missile system.

==== Nuclear sharing ====
Germany is participating in NATO&#x27;s nuclear sharing concept. Nuclear sharing is a concept that involves member countries without nuclear weapons of their own in the planning for the use of nuclear weapons by NATO, and in particular, provides for the armed forces of these countries to be involved in delivering these weapons in the event of their use.

Soon after its founding, the German Air Force began to train with the US Seventeenth Air Force in handling, arming, and delivering nuclear weapons. At first, the F-104 Starfighter was intended to be used solely as a nuclear delivery platform, armed with nuclear air-to-air and air-to-surface missiles, as well as nuclear bombs. The Tornado was the second air force plane fielded that was capable of delivering nuclear ammunition, although it was limited to delivering B61 nuclear bombs.

From 1965 through 1970, Missile Wings 1 and 2 fielded 16 Pershing 1 missile systems with nuclear warheads under U.S. Army custody. In 1970, the system was upgraded to Pershing 1a with 72 missiles. Although not directly affected by the 1988 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, the unilaterally removed the Pershing 1a missiles from its inventory in 1991, and the missiles were destroyed. At the end of the Cold War, more than 100,000 soldiers served in the .

The United States still lends nuclear weapons for hypothetical use by the under the nuclear sharing agreement. In 2007, 22 B61 nuclear bombs were still kept in Germany, stored at the Büchel Air Base for use with Tornado IDS fighter-bombers of the Tactical Air Force Wing 33. The American nuclear weapons formerly stored at Nörvenich Air Base, Ramstein Air Base, and Memmingen Air Base were all withdrawn from Germany during the mid-and-late-1990s.

By international treaties between Germany and the &quot;Big Four&quot; powers in Europe (that formerly occupied Germany), East Germany was a nuclear-free zone. The Big Four powers are the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom, and France, and the latter three have no nuclear weapons in Germany anymore.

===Reunification===

After German reunification in October 1990, the aircraft and personnel of the former GDR air force, the were taken. The remnants of the East German Air Force were placed under the newly formed 5th Air Force Division () in Strausberg. In 1993, the division was renamed 3rd Air Force Division (), moved to Gatow in Berlin and in 1995 assigned to NATO. By 1990, the East German plane markings had been replaced by the Air Force Iron Cross, the first time Soviet-built aircraft had served in a NATO air force. However, as the &quot;Luftstreitkräfte der NVA&quot; were supplied exclusively with Eastern Bloc-produced aircraft, such as the Sukhoi Su-17, MiG-21, MiG-23 and MiG-29 fighters, most of the equipment was not compatible with the West German NATO equipment and therefore taken out of service and sold or given to new members of NATO in Eastern Europe, such as Poland and the Baltic states.

An exception to this was the Fighter Wing 3 &quot;Vladimir Komarov &quot; () in Preschen Air Base. The Fighter Wing 3 flew brand new MiG-29 fighters. On 1 June 1993, the wing was renamed Fighter Wing 73 () and on 1 October 1994 completed its move to its new home at Laage Air Base. The pilots of JG 73 were some of the most experienced MiG-29 pilots in the world. One of their primary duties was to serve as aggressor pilots, training other pilots in dissimilar combat tactics. The United States sent a group of fighter pilots to Germany during the &quot;Red October&quot; exercise to practise tactics against the aircraft they were most likely to meet in real combat. The MiG-29s of JG 73 were fully integrated into the ″s air defence structure and the first Soviet Bloc aircraft to be declared operational within NATO. With the introduction of the Eurofighter Typhoon imminent, the decision was taken to withdraw the MiG-29. All German MiG-29s, save one, were sold to Poland for the symbolic price of €1 apiece. On 9 August 2004, the last MiG-29s landed in Poland where they continue to serve in the 41st Tactical Squadron of the Polish Air Force.

===Operations in the Balkans===

The experienced combat action for the first time since World War II during September 1995 in the course of Operation Deliberate Force, when six IDS Tornado fighter-bombers, equipped with forward looking infrared devices, and escorted by eight ECR Tornados, supported NATO&#x27;s artillery missions on positions of the Bosnian Serbs around Sarajevo, Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina.

In March 1999, the became involved in a direct combat role as part of the Kosovo War along with the other NATO powers. This event was noted as significant in the British press with &quot;The Sun&quot; running the headline &quot; and the RAF into battle side by side&quot;. The sent in Fighter Bomber Wing 32, equipped with ECR Tornados, which flew missions to suppress enemy air defenses in and around Kosovo.

These fighter-bombers were equipped with an electronic countermeasures pod, one AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missile for self-defence, and an AGM-88 HARM air-to-ground missile (anti-radar). The bomber wing flew 2108 hours and 446 sorties, firing 236 HARM missiles at hostile targets. No manned planes were lost in combat during this campaign.

===2000s===
In 2005 and 2008, F-4F &quot;Phantom II&quot; fighter planes took part in the Baltic Air Policing operation (of NATO), and these fighters were supplemented in 2009 by units flying the &quot;Typhoon&quot;.

In 2006, to support military operations in Afghanistan, the sent over several Panavia Tornado reconnaissance planes from the 51st Reconnaissance Wing &quot;Immelmann&quot; (), stationed in Mazar-i-Sharif, Northern Afghanistan.
There have also been assorted German Army helicopters flying from the Air Base in Mazar-i-Sharif. Also, C-160 Transall have flown transport plane missions in and around Afghanistan.

Since the 1970s, the West German (and, post-reunification, German) (as well as many other European air forces) has actively pursued the construction of European internationally made warplanes, such as the Panavia Tornado and the Eurofighter Typhoon introduced into the in 2006.

On 13 January 2004, the Minister of Defence, Peter Struck, announced major changes in the future of the German armed forces. A major part of this announcement was a plan to cut the number of fighter planes from 426 in early 2004, to 265 by 2015. Assuming that the plans to order 180 Typhoons is carried out in full, and all of the F-4 Phantoms are removed from service, this would cut the number of Tornado fighter-bombers down to just 85.

In the past, the Bundesmarine&#x27;s naval air wing () received 112 Tornado IDS planes. However, in late 2004, the last unit of Bundesmarine Tornados was disbanded. The entire maritime combat role was assigned to the , one unit of which has had its Tornado fighters equipped to carry Kormoran II missiles and American HARM missiles.

===2010s===

As of 2014, a significant proportion of Germany&#x27;s military aircraft was reported to be unserviceable. It was reported that around half of the Eurofighters and Tornados were not currently airworthy and that the aging C-160 fleet remained in limited service while awaiting the introduction of the Airbus A400M, the first of which was delivered in December 2014. Ursula von der Leyen admitted that, due to the poor state of the ″s equipment, Germany was no longer able to fulfill its NATO commitments.

The German Air Force was one of the founding members of the European Air Transport Command headquartered in Eindhoven - The Netherlands and most of the Transport &amp; Tanker assets have been transferred under EATC management. The replacement of four Airbus A310 MRTT by the Airbus A330 MRTT was approved in 2018 by joining the acquisition of four by the Royal Netherlands Air Force.

Future plans are the replacement of the aging Sikorsky CH-53 Sea Stallion, which was acquired in the 1970s, by Boeing CH-47 Chinook or Sikorsky CH-53K King Stallion. A bid for a heavy transport helicopter program or STH () was initiated in 2018. However, the award was suspended in 2020 due to the high price tag on both helicopters.

The participated in the Israeli Air Force exercise &quot;Blue Flag&quot;, the country&#x27;s largest international air combat exercise, designed to simulate extreme combat scenarios. The German Air Force&#x27;s six Eurofighter Typhoon fighter jets were from Tactical Air Force Squadron 73 Steinhoff from Rostock. It is the first German participation in the Blue Flag exercise.

In 2018, the Air Force issued a request for information from manufacturers about four potential aircraft to replace the aging Panavia Tornados - the Eurofighter Typhoon, F-15 Advanced Eagle, F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and F-35 Lightning. In January 2019, it was announced that the F-35 Lightning had been dropped from the shortlist, with the Eurofighter Typhoon and Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet under consideration.

The German Air Force will acquire three C-130J Super Hercules Transport and three KC-130J Tanker Aircraft (delivery planned 2020–2021), which will be jointly operated with the French Air Force&#x27;s two C-130J and two KC-130J Aircraft (delivery planned 2018–2019).

===2020s===
In April 2020, the German government announced its intention to gain approval for the purchase of 30 Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornets, 15 EA-18G Growlers, and 55 Eurofighter Typhoons as replacements for the Tornado fleet. However, as of the same month such approval was unlikely to occur before 2022. The Super Hornet was selected due to its compatibility with nuclear weapons and availability of an electronic attack version. As of March 2022, the Super Hornet has not been certified for the B61 Mod 12 nuclear bombs, but Dan Gillian, head of Boeing&#x27;s Super Hornet program, previously stated that &quot;We certainly think that we, working with the U.S. government, can meet the German requirements there on the [German&#x27;s] timeline.&quot;

In December 2021, Air Transport Wing 63 in Hohn Air Base and with it, the last remaining German C-160 Transalls were disbanded, with the A400M and C-130J serving as the German tactical transport aircraft in the future.

In March 2022, German Minister of Defence Christine Lambrecht announced that Germany intends to buy 35 Lockheed Martin F-35A Lightning II fighter jets instead of Super Hornets to replace the Tornado, the only aircraft Germany possess capable of carrying US nuclear weapons. Another ten may be added to the initial order. Germany intends to also order 15 Eurofighter Typhoon electronic warfare aircraft in place of Growlers.

In April 2022, as a continuation of the STH program, Germany has chosen the CH-47F Chinook to replace its aging fleet of Sikorsky CH-53 Sea Stallion. According to Reuters report, Germany will purchase 60 CH-47Fs with a contract worth around ().

In August 2022, Germany sent six Eurofighter Typhoon fighter jets, three Airbus A330 MRTT tankers and four Airbus A400M Atlas transports to take part in Exercise Pitch Black in Australia, in the air force&#x27;s largest peacetime deployment.

From June 12 to June 23, 2023, the German Air Force hosted Air Defender 23, the largest exercise of NATO air forces since its creation with 25 nations and up to 10,000 troops participating.

==Structure==

The current commander of the German Air Force is Lieutenant General Ingo Gerhartz. The Inspector of the Air Force () is the commander of Air Force Command (), a body created in 2013 by the merger of the Air Force Office (), German Air Staff (), and Air Force Forces Command (). Similar to the Air Staff of the United States Air Force, the German Air Force Command is a force-providing command, not an operational command. The Air Force Command is tasked with ensuring the combat readiness of the German Air Force combat units, which during operations would either be commanded by a NATO command or the Joint Operations Command of the . The Air Force command directly controls three higher commands.

The creation of the Air Force Command was part of a reorganization of the as a whole, announced by Thomas de Maizière in 2011, which also involved the Air Force shrinking to 23,000 soldiers and thus undergoing major restructuring at all levels. In addition to the higher command authorities, the three air divisions, the Air Force Training Command, and Air Force Weapon Systems Command were disbanded. The three surface-to-air missile units will merge into a single wing in Husum in Northern Germany. The wing fields 14 MIM-104 Patriot and 4 MANTIS systems. The three air transport wings will be merged into a single wing based at Wunstorf Air Base, which will field 40 A400M Atlas transport planes. The will field three Multirole Eurofighter Wings, each with two squadrons for a total of 143 Eurofighter Typhoon. A fighter-bomber wing fielding Panavia Tornado IDS planes remains in service at Büchel Air Base. The Reconnaissance Wing 51 will remain in service at Schleswig Air Base and add one drone squadron to its Panavia Tornado ECR squadron.

The has two main elements subordinate to it:
* Air Operations Command (), responsible for providing command and control to air operations

===North American training centers===

In light of the destroyed infrastructure of West Germany post–World War II, the restrictions on aircraft production placed on Germany and the later restrictive flying zones available for training pilots, the reconstructed trained most of its pilots tactically away from Germany, mainly in the United States and Canada where most of its aircraft were sourced.

During the 1960s and 1970s, a very large number of jet crashes—the suffered a 36 percent crash rate for F-84F Thunderstreaks and an almost 30 percent loss of F-104 Starfighters—created considerable public demand for moving combat training centers away from Germany.

As a result, the set up two tactical training centers: one, like those of many of the NATO forces, at the Royal Canadian Air Force base at Goose Bay; and the second in a unique partnership with the United States Air Force at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico (F-104 pilots had already been trained at Luke Air Force Base, Arizona, since 1964). Both facilities provide access to large unpopulated areas, where tactical and combat training can take place without danger to large populations.
On 1 May 1996, the established the German Air Force Tactical Training Center (TTC) in concert with the United States Air Force 20th Fighter Squadron at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico, which provides aircrew training in the F-4F Phantom II. The TTC served as the parent command for two German aircrew training squadrons. The F-4 Training Squadron oversaw all German F-4 student personnel affairs and provided German instructor pilots to cooperate in the contracted F-4 training program provided by the U.S. Air Force (20th Fighter Squadron). A second TTC unit, the Tornado Training Squadron, provided academic and tactical flying training, by German air force instructors, for German Tornado aircrews.

The first contingent of Tornado aircraft arrived at Holloman in March 1996. More than 300 German air force personnel were permanently assigned at Holloman to the TTC, the only unit of its kind in the United States. The German Air Force Flying Training Center was activated on 31 March 1996, with German Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Portz and U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Michael Ryan present. The had stationed up to 800 personnel at Holloman for training exercises, due to limited training space in Europe.

In September 2004, the announced a reduction in its training program by about 20%. By the end of 2006, 650 personnel and 25 Tornado aircraft were assigned to Holloman.

On 12 April 2016, the Ministry of Defence decided to close the TTC by 2019 to consolidate the reduced operation of remaining Tornado aircraft in Germany. Approximately 450 personnel and 14 Tornado aircraft were stationed Holloman at the time. Training for the Tornado transitioned to the Tactical Air Force Wing 51 &quot;Immelmann&quot; at Schleswig Air Base and the remaining Air Force Tactical Training Command USA relocated to Sheppard Air Force Base by December 2019.

==Air bases==
In 2020, the Air Force uses 12 air bases, four of which host no flying units. Furthermore, the Air Force has a presence at three civilian airports incl. the Airport Berlin Tegel which has been closed in November 2020:

==Personnel==
In 2012, the Air Force had an authorized strength of 44,565 active airmen/women and 4,914 reservists. The civil personnel within the Air Force is being reduced to 5,950 officials and employees. Most of the civilian employees work in maintenance and the Air Force Fire Department. On 20 September 2011 defense minister Thomas de Maizière announced that the Air Force would shrink to 23,000 airmen/women.
=== Training ===
The has set up a total of 5 training institutions, namely the , , , and , for training catering both personnel in active service and civilians willing to enter the .

==Symbols, emblems and uniform==

===Roundel and serial number===
Originally German Air Force aircraft carried an Iron Cross—appearing to be closely modeled on that used by the 1916–17 era Imperial German through the spring of 1918, but no longer have the white border around the crosses&#x27; &quot;ends&quot; (thusly resembling the orthogonal white &quot;flanks&quot; of the earlier, 1918–1945 era national marking)—as an identifying feature on all four wing positions and on both sides on the rear of the fuselage and a small tricolor German flag painted on the vertical stabilizer. Each aircraft also carried a serial number consisting of two letters, which identified the service and combat wing, followed by three numbers identifying the squadron and the number of the plane within the squadron, almost graphically resembling the USAF&#x27;s own buzz numbers of the same period.

This system was changed in 1968. The large Iron Cross and serial numbers have since been replaced on all aircraft by a four-digit registration code, marked on the aircraft somewhat in the manner of the earlier alphanumeric combat wing code characters used by their World War II predecessor—separated by an Iron Cross in the middle: the first pair of numbers identify the type of aircraft and the second pair are sequential for each type. For example, the Tornado IDS of the Air Force are numbered from 4301 to 4622, while the Tornado ECR of the Air Force is numbered from 4623 to 4657 and the numbers from 3001 to 3399 are being used for the Eurofighter. The 4-digit serial number is often portrayed in print with a &quot;+&quot; between the two pairs of numbers as a placeholder to indicate where the Iron Cross would separate the numbers when painted on the aircraft, for example the new A350 fleet (1001 to 1003) can be written as &quot;10+01&quot;, etc.

=== Uniform ===
The ranks of the Air Force are identical to the ranks of the German Army. The Air Force field dress is the same as the army field dress. The dress uniform of the Air Force is dark blue with gold-yellow wings as collar patches. As headdress a dark blue side cap or dark blue peaked cap can be worn. Members of the German Air Force Regiment wear a dark blue beret.

===Ranks===
====Commissioned officer ranks====
The rank insignia of commissioned officers.
====Other ranks====
The rank insignia of non-commissioned officers and enlisted personnel.
==Equipment==
=== Aircraft ===

NOTE: Germany is participating in the MRTT program for their aerial refueling needs, along with contracting Noordzee Helikopters Vlaanderen to provide H145 rotorcraft training

===Air defence===
=== Radars ===
The Air Force has several radar types under its command including the Ground Master 406F a RRP 117 system, a Hensoldt ASR-S radar and the Italian made Selex RAT-31DL radar which provides a 3D picture of controlled airspace.

<text>The Poás Volcano (), is an active stratovolcano in central Costa Rica and is located within Poas Volcano National Park. It has erupted 40 times since 1828, with a strong eruption on April 2017—causing the evacuation of visitors and residents. The volcano and surrounding park were closed for nearly 17 months, with a 2.5 kilometer safety perimeter established around the erupting crater. On September 1, 2018, the park was reopened to the public only with limited access to the crater observation area. They have started to require a reservation on the National Park Website before visitation. Adjacent trails to Lake Botos, and the museum at the visitor center remained closed. The volcano erupted briefly twice in September 2019.

== Crater lakes ==
There are two crater lakes near the summit. The northern lake is known as the &quot;Laguna Caliente&quot; (&quot;hot lagoon&quot;) and is located at a height of 2,300 m in a crater approximately 0.3 km wide and 30 m deep. It is one of the world&#x27;s most acidic lakes. The acidity varies after rain and changes in volcanic activity, sometimes reaching a pH of almost 0. The bottom of this lake is covered with a layer of liquid sulfur. Acidity, lake temperature fluctuations, and a complex, toxic sulfur and iron chemistry (conjectured to be like conditions on early Earth and Mars) limits aquatic life to a specially-adapted &quot;Acidiphilium&quot; bacteria. Above ground, acid gases create acid rain and acid fog, causing damage to surrounding ecosystems and often irritation of eyes and lungs.

Lake Botos, the southern lake, fills an inactive crater, with the latest eruption in 7500 BC. It is cold and clear, and is surrounded by a cloud forest within the National Park boundaries.

== Eruptive history ==

On May 17, 1953, an eruption occurred that started a cycle and lasted until 1956. At least two people were reported missing in this incident.

Poás was near the epicenter of a 6.1-magnitude earthquake in January 2009 that killed at least forty people and affected Fraijanes, Vara Blanca, Cinchona (the most affected area), the capital San José, and the Central Valley region of Costa Rica.

There was also an eruptive activity in 2009 involving minor phreatic eruptions and landslides within the northern active crater. Poás eruptions often include geyser-like ejections of crater-lake water.

On February 25, 2014, a webcam from the Volcanological and Seismological Observatory of Costa Rica (OVSICORI) captured the moment a dark cloud exploded about 1,000 feet in the air from a massive crater of the Poás Volcano. This volcano remains active today.
Poás is one of the 9 volcanoes currently monitored by the Deep Earth Carbon Degassing Project. The project is collecting data on the carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide emission rates from subaerial volcanoes.

=== 2017 Activity ===

On April 9, 2017, National Park officials placed restrictions on visitors at Poas due to an increased volume of toxic gases at the summit crater. An explosion on April 12 caused the decision to close the park for visitors for a &quot;temporary” time. Some nearby residents were also evacuated because of the activity.

On April 14, 2017, two eruptions at 07:39 and 07:57 created an over three kilometer ash and vapor column. Further explosions occurred after 2 days, on April 16.

Following a substantial blast on April 22, that sent incandescent rocks over a large area which damaged park buildings and infrastructure, Costa Rica President Luis Guillermo Solis toured the surrounding towns the following two days. Business owners described the negative financial impacts the volcano park closure were causing, and Solis released a video in Spanish and English urging potential tourists to visit the nearby community shops and restaurants. He also promised emergency agencies would continue to make updated reports on the eruption. As of September 1, 2018, the National Park has re-opened with limited access and revised regulations. Visitors are required to make an online reservation to enter the park and the number of visitors and time allowed at the crater is limited. Only the main crater observation area is open as of September 2018. As of April 2023, while some adjacent trails remain closed, the trail to the Lake Botos is open.

=== 2019 Activity ===
* February 11, 2019: According to the Volcanological and Seismological Observatory of Costa Rica (OVSICORI), the eruption began at 1:50 a.m. Monday and sent a column of ash 200 meters above the crater.
* September 30, 2019, 05:41: Eruption of ash and solid material, with a 2 kilometer column, in contrast of previous water vapor activities on September 23, 2019.

===IUGS geological heritage site===
In respect of it being &#x27;an iconic and type example of an arc shield-like massive stratovolcano and type example of an active crater lake complex&#x27;, the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) included &#x27;The Poás volcano&#x27; in its assemblage of 100 &#x27;geological heritage sites&#x27; around the world in a listing published in October 2022. The organisation defines an IUGS Geological Heritage Site as &#x27;a key place with geological elements and/or processes of international scientific relevance, used as a reference, and/or with a substantial contribution to the development of geological sciences through history.&#x27;

<doc id="1030136" wikidata="Q6011585" url="?curid=1030136" title="In flight">
<text>In baseball, the rules state that a batted ball is considered in flight when it has not yet touched any object other than a fielder or his equipment. Such a ball can be caught by a fielder to put the batter out. 

Once a batted ball touches the ground, a fence or wall, a foul pole, a base, the pitcher&#x27;s rubber, an umpire, or a baserunner, it is no longer &quot;in flight&quot;. A batted ball that passes entirely out of the playing field ceases to be &quot;in flight&quot; when that occurs; if it was between the foul poles at that moment, then it is a home run which entitles the batter (and any other runners on base) to score.

A special rule exists in covered baseball facilities (retractable or fixed roofed), where a batted ball striking the roof, roof supporting structure, or objects suspended from the roof (e.g., speakers) while in fair territory is still considered to be in flight. Rules for batted balls striking any of those objects in foul territory differ between ballparks, with most considering such a ball to still be in flight, and some considering it to be a foul ball and dead from the time it strikes.

==Fly out==

If a batted ball (other than a foul tip, with less than 2 strikes) is caught in flight, the batter is out—called a fly out—and all runners must tag up, meaning that they are out if a fielder with possession of the ball touches their starting base (time-of-pitch base) before they do. A batted ball cannot be ruled foul or fair while in flight; a batted ball that is past first or third base will be called foul or fair based on where it ceases to be in flight, or where it is first touched by a fielder, whichever occurs first. A fly out on a ball in foul territory is also called a foul out. A foul tip, which by definition is always caught in flight, is a strike by special rule, and not an out, unless caught as a 3rd strike.

==Home run==
If a batted ball passes out of the playing field in flight and is fair, it is an automatic home run, entitling the batter and all runners to score without liability to be put out. However, if the fence or other barrier is less than 250 feet from home plate, a ball hit past that fence in flight and fair shall be ruled an automatic double. In the United States, such short fences are very rare even in the lowest-level amateur ballfields. Fields with short fences can be commonplace in some countries where baseball is less popular; often, soccer fields have to be used, resulting in a very short left or right field.

The shortest fair fences in Major League Baseball are both in Boston&#x27;s Fenway Park; the shortest fence that is nearly perpendicular to the foul line is the Green Monster. The left foul pole, renamed &quot;Fisk&#x27;s Pole&quot; in honor of Carlton Fisk&#x27;s famous home run in the 1975 World Series, stands 310 feet away from home plate. The right field foul pole, known as Pesky&#x27;s Pole, is 302 feet down the right field line, although the wall there is nearly parallel to the foul line as it curves back to the distant right field wall at 380 feet. From 1958 through 1961, the Los Angeles Dodgers played home games in Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, a stadium built for track and field; without the ability to move any of the permanent stadium structure, the Dodgers configured the field to result in a 251-foot left field foul line distance.

<text>Cajarc () is a commune in the Lot department, Occitania, France.

It is a stopping place on the Via podiensis, the medieval pilgrimage route from Le Puy-en-Velay to Santiago de Compostela, but also attracts tourists on account of its medieval town centre, its &quot;plan d&#x27;eau&quot;, a 4 km-long dammed section of the river Lot, and its beautiful setting in the Lot valley and the surrounding limestone plains (&quot;le causse&quot;). Its major cultural event is &quot;Africajarc&quot;, a four-day festival of contemporary African music and culture which runs in the last week of July each year; in 2008 it celebrated its tenth anniversary.

==Notable people==
Cajarc was the birthplace of playwright, novelist and screenwriter Françoise Sagan (1935–2004) born Françoise Quoirez.

President of France Georges Pompidou was an MP for the area in the National Assembly.

<doc id="1030177" wikidata="Q2281914" url="?curid=1030177" title="Sidney Frank">
<text>Sidney E. Frank (October 2, 1919 – January 10, 2006) was an American businessman and philanthropist. He became a billionaire through his promotion of Grey Goose vodka and Jägermeister.

==Early life, family, education==
Frank was born to a Jewish family in Montville, Connecticut. His father and mother were Abraham and Sarah Frank. He grew up in Norwich, Connecticut, and graduated from the Norwich Free Academy in 1937. He attended Brown University (class of 1942) but left because he could only afford one year of tuition. He later made enormous gifts to the university to help ensure that no student would ever be forced to leave Brown because of inability to pay tuition. During World War II, Frank worked for Pratt and Whitney as a manufacturer&#x27;s representative in India exploring ways to improve engine performance enabling aircraft to deal with the high altitudes encountered in the CBI theater. This was particularly important in improving the performance of transport aircraft flying supplies into China. The use of alcohol injection for aircraft engines was one of the approaches taken.

==Career==

Frank&#x27;s first wife, Louise &quot;Skippy&quot; Rosenstiel, was the daughter of Lewis Rosenstiel, founder of Schenley Industries, one of the largest American distillers and spirit importers. Frank joined Schenley after his marriage and rose to the company presidency, but was forced out in a family dispute in 1970.

In 1973 his wife died and he started his own company, Sidney Frank Importing Company, where he served as chairman and chief executive officer. The company is based in New Rochelle, New York, where Frank lived (he had a home in Rancho Santa Fe, California, as well).

In 1973, he secured the importing rights to Jägermeister, a traditional German digestif.

Frank&#x27;s first big success with his own company was with Jacques Cardin brandy, a brand he purchased from Seagram in 1979.

In the 1980s, Jägermeister became popular with college students in Louisiana and Frank promoted it heavily, turning a specialty brand developed to help with digestion into a mainstream success widely drunk in ice cold shots and used in Jello shooters.

In 1997, he developed Grey Goose vodka, made in France by François Thibault, and was so successful in promoting it that he sold the brand to Bacardi for $2 billion in June 2004. In the last years of his life, Frank bought the &quot;Travel Savvy&quot; and &quot;Business Traveler&quot; magazine titles for $4 million.

==Philanthropy==
Frank gave large bonuses to his employees and made a $12 million donation to The Norwich Free Academy in 2005. In October 2005, Frank donated £500,000 and a statue by sculptor Stephen Kettle to Bletchley Park Trust to fund a new Science Center dedicated to Alan Turing and, as a great supporter of the Supermarine Spitfire, commissioned a life-size statue of its designer, R. J. Mitchell, and funded a website dedicated to Mitchell&#x27;s life: RJ Mitchell. A life in aviation.

He gave a donation of $5 million to the New York Medical College psychiatry department, leading to the creation of the Sidney Frank fellowship which gives medical students early exposure to the field of psychiatry.

His foundation has been a supporter of the Israel Olympic Committee and has helped to offer scholarships in several Israeli sports.

In 2004, Frank gave $100 million to his alma mater Brown University, at the time the largest single contribution in the university&#x27;s history and still tied with two other gifts for that distinction. The gift provided for the Sidney E. Frank Scholarship which funds tuition for around 130 undergraduate students from low income families each year. In 2005, Frank donated $5 million to Brown to help with its Hurricane Katrina relief efforts. In 2006, Brown University named its Life Sciences building (the largest capital project to date) after Frank, in recognition of a $20 million gift to support its construction. Frank is the single most generous donor in the university&#x27;s history.

==Personal life, death and aftermath==
Frank married twice. His first wife, Louise &quot;Skippy&quot; Rosenstiel, was the daughter of Lewis Rosenstiel; she died in 1973, at the age of 50. They had two children: Matthew Frank and Cathy Frank Finkelstein Halstead, who was married and divorced from James A. Finkelstein, a son of Jerry Finkelstein&#x27;s. In 1975, he married Marian Elinor Ombres.

Frank died January 10, 2006, on a private plane in flight between San Diego, California, and Vancouver, British Columbia, at the age of 86 from heart failure. He was declared dead in San Francisco, California. On his plane were several nurses and medical doctors as well as a defibrillator, but he could not be revived. Services were held at Riverside Memorial Chapel. He is buried in the Rosenstiel family plot at United Jewish Cemeteries in Cincinnati. His daughter Cathy Frank Halstead is currently chairwoman of Sidney Frank Importing Company. She is also an artist and a co-founder of the Tippet Rise Art Center in Montana.

Daughter Cathy Frank figured prominently in a highly publicized case regarding her grandfather&#x27;s will that led to the disbarment of the controversial lawyer Roy Cohn. In 1975, Cohn had entered the hospital room of a dying and comatose Rosenstiel, forced a pen to his hand, and lifted it to the will in an attempt to make himself and Cathy Frank beneficiaries. The resulting marks were determined in court to be indecipherable and in no way a valid signature. In 1986, Cohn was disbarred for unethical and unprofessional conduct in the case, as well as for misappropriation of clients&#x27; funds and lying on a bar application.

Sidney Frank, and his son Matthew Frank, also sued the Rosenstiel estate, each in a separate action.

Jägermeister bought the entire company and Cathy Frank is no longer an officer in the Jägermeister owned company.

Sidney Frank Importing Company (SFIC) changed its name to Mast-Jägermeister US after its takeover by the German herbal liqueur producer in 2015.

<doc id="1030178" wikidata="Q6238597" url="?curid=1030178" title="John Hely-Hutchinson (secretary of state)">
<text>John Hely later Hely-Hutchinson (13 June 1724 – 4 September 1794) was an Anglo-Irish lawyer, politician, and academic who served as the 21st Provost of Trinity College Dublin from 1774 to 1794. He also served as Principal Secretary of State for Ireland from 1766 to 1794. He was a member of the Irish House of Commons from 1759 to 1794.

==Early life==
He was born at Gortroe, Mallow, County Cork in 1724. He was the son of Francis Hely, a gentleman of County Cork, was educated at Trinity College Dublin (BA 1744), and was called to the Irish bar in 1748. He took the additional name of Hutchinson on his marriage in 1751 to Christiana Nixon, heiress of her uncle, Richard Hutchinson.

==Career==
He was elected member of the Irish House of Commons for the borough of Lanesborough in 1759, but from 1761 to 1790, he represented Cork City. He at first attached himself to the patriotic party in opposition to the government, and although he afterwards joined the administration he never abandoned his advocacy of popular measures.

It was around this time that Hely-Hutchinson sold Frescati House in Blackrock, Dublin, now the site of the Frescati shopping Centre.

He was a man of brilliant and versatile ability, whom Lord Townshend, the Lord Lieutenant, described as by far the most powerful man in parliament. William Gerard Hamilton said of him that Ireland never bred a more able, nor any country a more honest man. Hely-Hutchinson was, however, an inveterate place-hunter, and there was a point in Lord North&#x27;s witticism that if you were to give him the whole of Great Britain and Ireland for an estate, he would ask the Isle of Man for a potato garden.

After a session or two in parliament, he was made a privy councillor and prime Serjeant-at-law; and from this time he gave a general, though by no means invariable support to the government. In 1767, the ministry contemplated an increase of the army establishment in Ireland from 12,000 to 15,000 men, but the &quot;Augmentation Bill&quot; met with strenuous opposition, not only from Flood, Ponsonby and the habitual opponents of the government, but from the Undertakers, or proprietors of boroughs, on whom the government had hitherto relied to secure them a majority in the House of Commons.

It therefore became necessary for Lord Townshend to turn to other methods for procuring support. Early in 1768, an English Act was passed for the increase of the army, and a message from the king setting forth the necessity for the measure was laid before the House of Commons in Dublin. An address favourable to the government policy was, however, rejected; and Hely-Hutchinson, together with the speaker and the attorney-general, did their utmost both in public and private to obstruct the bill. Parliament was dissolved in May 1768, and the lord lieutenant set about the task of purchasing or otherwise securing a majority in the new parliament. Peerages, pensions, and places were bestowed lavishly on those whose support could be thus secured; Hely-Hutchinson was won over by the concession that the Irish army should be established by the authority of an Irish act of parliament instead of an English one.

The &quot;Augmentation Bill&quot; was carried out in the session of 1769 by a large majority. Hely-Hutchinson&#x27;s support had been so valuable that he received as a reward an addition of £1,000 a year to the salary of his sinecure of alnager, a major&#x27;s commission in a cavalry regiment, and a promise of the Secretaryship of State. He was at this time one of the most brilliant debaters in the Irish parliament, and he was enjoying an exceedingly lucrative practice at the bar. This income, however, together with his well-salaried sinecure, and his place as prime serjeant, he surrendered in 1774, to become provost of Trinity College, although the statute requiring the provost to be in holy orders had to be dispensed with in his favour.

For this great academic position Hely-Hutchinson was in no way qualified, and his appointment to it for purely political service to the government was justly criticised with much asperity. His conduct in using his position as provost to secure the parliamentary representation of the university for his eldest son brought him into conflict with Duigenan, who attacked him in &quot;Lacrymae academicae&quot;, and involved him in a duel with a Mr Doyle; while a similar attempt on behalf of his second son in 1790 led to his being accused before a select committee of the House of Commons of impropriety as returning officer. But although without scholarship Hely-Hutchinson was an efficient provost, during whose rule material benefits were conferred on Trinity College.

He continued to occupy a prominent place in parliament, where he advocated free trade, the relief of the Catholics from penal legislation, and the reform of parliament. He was one of the very earliest politicians to recognise the soundness of Adam Smith&#x27;s views on trade; and he quoted from the &quot;Wealth of Nations&quot;, adopting some of its principles, in his &quot;Commercial Restraints of Ireland&quot;, published in 1779, which Lecky pronounces one of the best specimens of political literature produced in Ireland in the latter half of the 18th century.

In the same year, the economic condition of Ireland being the cause of great anxiety, the government solicited from several leading politicians their opinions on the state of the country with suggestions for a remedy. Hely-Hutchinson&#x27;s response was a remarkably able state paper (manuscript in the Record Office), which also showed clear traces of the influence of Adam Smith. The &quot;Commercial Restraints&quot;, condemned by the authorities as seditious, went far to restore Hely-Hutchinson&#x27;s popularity which had been damaged by his greed for office. Not less enlightened were his views on the Catholic question. In a speech in parliament on Catholic education in 1782 the provost declared that Catholic students were in fact to be found at Trinity College, but that he desired their presence thereto be legalised on the largest scale. &quot;My opinion&quot;, he said,
:&quot;is strongly against sending Roman Catholics abroad for education, nor would establish Popish colleges at home. The advantage of being admitted into the university of Dublin will be very great to Catholics; they need not be obliged to attend the divinity professor, they may have one of their own; and would have a part of the public money applied to their use, to the support of several poor lads as sizars, and to provide premiums for persons of merit, for I would have them go into examinations and make no distinction between them and the Protestants but such as merit might claim&quot;.

After sketching a scheme for increasing the number of diocesan schools where Roman Catholics might receive free education, he went on to urge that
:&quot;It is certainly a matter of importance that the education of their priests should be as perfect as possible, and that if they have any prejudices they should be prejudiced in favour of their own country. The Roman Catholics should receive the best education in the established university at the public expense; but by no means should Popish colleges be allowed, for by them we should again have the press groaning with themes of controversy, and subjects of religious disputation that have long slept in oblivion would again awake, and awaken with them all the worst passions of the human mind&quot;.

In 1777, Hely-Hutchinson became Secretary of State. When Henry Grattan in 1782 moved an address to the king containing a declaration of Irish legislative independence, Hely-Hutchinson supported the attorney-general&#x27;s motion postponing the question; but on 16 April, after the Easter recess, he read a message from the Lord Lieutenant, the Duke of Portland, giving the king&#x27;s permission for the House to consider the matter, and he expressed his sympathy with the popular cause which Grattan on the same day brought to a triumphant issue. Hely-Hutchinson supported the opposition on the regency question in 1788, and one of his last votes in the House was in favour of parliamentary reform. In 1790 he exchanged the constituency of Cork for that of Taghmon in County Wexford, for which borough he remained a member until his death at Buxton, Derbyshire on 4 September 1794.

In March 1794, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.

==Family==
In 1783, his wife Christiana had been created Baroness Donoughmore and on her death in 1788, his eldest son Richard (1756–1825) succeeded to the title. Richard, an ardent advocate of Catholic emancipation, was created Viscount Donoughmore in 1797, and in 1800 (having voted for the Union, hoping to secure Catholic emancipation from the united parliament) he was further created Earl of Donoughmore of Knocklofty, being succeeded first by his brother John Hely-Hutchinson (1757–1832) and then by his nephew John, 3rd Earl (1787–1851), from whom the title descended.

<doc id="1030181" wikidata="Q1554155" url="?curid=1030181" title="Guisarme">
<text>A guisarme (sometimes gisarme, giserne or bisarme) is a polearm used in Europe primarily between 1000 and 1400. Its origin is likely Germanic, from the Old High German , literally &quot;weeding iron&quot;. Like many medieval polearms, the exact early form of the weapon is hard to define from literary references, and the identification of surviving weapons can be speculative.

==Possible interpretations of form==

Two main modern schools of thought exist:
# Like most polearms the guisarme was developed by peasants by combining hand tools with long poles: in this case by putting a pruning hook onto a spear shaft. According to Sir Guy Francis Laking, among the polearms, the guisarme was second only to the spear in importance for the medieval soldier class. In fact, it was so effective by the 13th century there was active support for its banishment from the battlefield. While early designs were simply a hook on the end of a long pole, later designs implemented a small reverse spike on the back of the blade. Eventually weapon makers incorporated the usefulness of the hook in a variety of different polearms, and &quot;guisarme&quot; became a catch-all for any weapon that included a hook on the blade. This is exemplified by the terms bill-guisarmes, voulge-guisarmes, and glaive-guisarmes.
# An alternative definition is given by Ewart Oakeshott in his book &quot;European Weapons and Armour&quot;. He sees the guisarme as a &quot;crescent shaped double socketed axe&quot; on a long shaft. His primary reason is the use of the term &quot;giserne&quot; and axe interchangeably for the same weapon in the poem Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. This interpretation is also favoured by John Waldmann.

===Illustrations and textual evidence===
Supporting the second interpretation are the illustrations in the original manuscript of the Gawain poem which clearly show Sir Gawain with a long crescent shaped axe (see right). However, other texts from the same period draw a distinction from the axe and guisarme (Such as in Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Romaunt of the Rose&quot;: &quot;With swerd, or sparth (axe) or gysarme&quot; and &quot;Mandeville&#x27;s Travels&quot;: &quot;with swerds drawen and gysarmez and axes&quot;) and the use in the epic poem &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot; may have been poetic license. Olivier de la Marche, writing in the 15th century, describes the guisarme as &quot;hafted combination of a dagger and a battle axe&quot; and describes the weapon being of &quot;great antiquity&quot;.

In his novel &quot;Knight in Anarchy&quot;, George Shipway describes the process of training for a judicial duel using the guisarme, where he favours the double-socketed axe interpretation of the weapon.

<text>Pirate radio stations have operated in various countries of Asia, often putting over political or nationalist points of view. Offshore stations have attempted to reach China or overseas Chinese residents. Citizens&#x27; Radio is an unlicensed Hong Kong pro-democracy station. In Taiwan, what are known as &quot;underground radio&quot; stations have broadcast both pro- and anti-government opinions. Large numbers of unlicensed stations have functioned in the Philippines, of which 107.9 U-Radio (2006–2013) is among the best known. Finally, Radio First Termer was briefly operated by and for U.S. troops in Vietnam in 1971.

==China==
In mainland China, setting up a private radio or TV station will not be permitted, broadcasting stations can only be set by local government. However, everyone can easily purchase a portable FM transmitter for special application. So that someone is going to sell drugs via private FM transmission called Black Radio, which means illegal radio broadcasting in China. Some illegal stations make a lot of jamming to public stations and airplanes&#x27; communications.

A number of offshore radio stations have reportedly operated from the South China Sea, mainly for political purposes and these include Voice of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army; Radio Flash; The October Storm; Rediffusion Central; Popular of Peking. In 1990–1991, two other offshore radio stations intended for a Chinese audience made news in the world&#x27;s press.

One of them was Radio Tiananmen, a station that was to be based aboard the MV &quot;Sarah&quot; (&quot;Lichfield I&quot;) to be renamed &quot;Liberty&quot; that had been the former home of Radio Newyork International that broadcast briefly during two consecutive years in late 1980s from an anchorage off Jones Beach, New York. The idea was to anchor the ship in international waters off the Northeast coastline of the US and to broadcast on behalf of the thousands of Chinese students studying in the US in support of their fellow students who had demonstrated in Tiananmen Square. The idea faltered when the backers were told that the United States government would oppose an independent political station of this type.

The other station was created in France and sponsored by , a French magazine and The Face, a British magazine together with support from contributors in Hong Kong. The group called themselves &quot;Federation for Democracy in China&quot; and they bought a ship, which they renamed, &quot;Goddess of Democracy&quot;, which was also the name of the proposed station. When the vessel sailed from La Rochelle, France it was intended for the ship to dock and that is where studios, transmitters and radio antenna would be installed. However, the project was abandoned after political and financial problems.

==Hong Kong==
In 2006, Citizens&#x27; Radio was founded by a group of pro-democracy activists, including Tsang Kin-shing and legislator Leung Kwok-hung, also known as &quot;Long Hair&quot;. It broadcast on weeknights from Chai Wan on 102.8 MHz FM.

On 30 November 2009, FM101, a station based in Kwun Tong commenced broadcasting, according to the South China Morning Post (1 December 2009). It was heard in the east of Kowloon and the east of Hong Kong Island. The station&#x27;s founders include Leung King-wai, Tsang Chun-Ying and Kwok Yiu-Cheong. The latter two were formerly presenters for Citizens&#x27; Radio, but Citizens&#x27; Radio was not involved in its foundation, according to founder Tsang Kin-Shing.

==India==

==Taiwan==
In reference to unlicensed land-based stations, the term &quot;underground radio&quot; is in common usage in Taiwan. The World United Formosans for Independence reportedly studied the possibility of broadcasting from the Philippines, but no concrete action materialised.

The underground radio movement began in the liberalising political milieu following the lifting of the decades-long martial law. Historically, most of the stations have opposed, in some manner, the political establishment represented by the Chinese Nationalist Party (Kuomintang) and the Republic of China (ROC) framework, in favour of the then opposition movement broadly consisting of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and allied social movements. These so-called pan-green radio stations are mostly based in central and southern Taiwan with most listeners being hard-core pan-green supporters who despise Kuomintang rule and the potential for Chinese unification. A few stations positioned themselves on the opposing end of the political spectrum, generally favouring the ROC status quo advocated by the New Party and &quot;non-mainstream factions&quot; within the Nationalist Party. With the DPP formerly in power, and ultimate Taiwan independence and sovereignty is the stance taken by most underground radio stations, Taiwan was one of the rare examples in the world of underground radio stations being pro-government.

Programming generally is of a vertical blocking format, with live call-ins taking up a good portion of air time. On some stations, slots are allocated to local community and activist groups. The most prominent segment of the audience comes from rural working class, males usually middle-aged and beyond. Taiwanese Hokkien is by far the most commonly used language on the air, although Mandarin and, much less frequently, Hakka are also used. Underground radio stations cover their expenses by selling unorthodox drugs or medicine in a humorous and entertaining manner to keep the listeners hooked between actual programming.

Most if not all underground stations favour a mechanism to gain legal status but many balk at the costly requirements, which they believe to favour corporate and Nationalist-owned broadcasters. Government policy has always treated underground radio as an illegal enterprise, even after the DPP came to power. Official responses have been more varied, alternating between levying fines and confiscating equipment to tolerating their presence. Most stations are able to set up backup broadcast points within days of government raids. Commercial stations are known to file official complaints against pirate stations, whose signals are said to interfere with legal broadcasts.

==Philippines==
Licensed radio operations in the country are supervised by the National Telecommunications Commission and the same agency (along with the Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster ng Pilipinas) has been involved in raids cracking down unlicensed stations. Despite the proliferation of pirate radio in various times and the agency&#x27;s proper counteractions, the most documented notorious hub of unlicensed operators have been predominantly within Metro Manila while others are from Pampanga, Cebu and in some parts of Mindanao.

===1986: Radyo Bandido===
Radyo Bandido, a clandestine radio station led by former Radyo Veritas 846 kHz personnel, Jesuit priest James Reuter and disk jockey June Keithley, played a vital role in the 1986 EDSA Revolution that resulted to the ouster of President Ferdinand Marcos.

Seventeen people, led by Keithley, gathered secretly to open a station atop the shuttered Jacinto-Tanco building—then housing the facility of DZRJ-AM 810 kHz—in Santa Mesa, Manila, shortly after the government shut down all opposition broadcast stations including the Catholic-run &quot;Veritas&quot;, at that time one of the few covering the revolution, on the early morning of February 23. The station, manned by the team from &quot;Veritas&quot; with the guidance of then-Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile, was operational from the 23rd until the fall of the Marcos administration on the 25th. The president once attempted to prevent their operation, ordering one of his crack teams led by Bobby Ortega, but later failed.

At present, the station continues to legally operate as DZRJ-AM, adapting the name &quot;Radyo Bandido&quot;.

===2005-2023: Channel A Radio===
Channel A Radio was started in 2005 under the callsign DWCA-FM on 100.0 MHz with facilities located at #28, Poblacion, Arayat, Pampanga. In 2008, it was transferred to 100.7 MHz, until moving again to 98.5 MHz in 2011. 

In 2017, Channel A Radio and Bandera News Philippines struck a joint venture agreement, serving as a network affiliate. But in May 2023, it was forced off air due to the lack of a legislative broadcast franchise and mayor&#x27;s permit, coinciding with the expiration of its affiliation contract with Radyo Bandera, it nonetheless continued broadcasting online until 2024.

===2006-2013: 107.9 U-Radio===
The most known unregulated radio station was 107.9 U-Radio. It began its broadcast in 2006, succeeding Power 108 FM, that shut down on August 31, 2003, on claims that the former station was unlicensed. The station started broadcasting in Metro Manila at 107.9 MHz with the power of 100 watts, playing non-stop dance music, with no call sign and disc jockeys, and a stinger of a recorded female voiceover mentioning a mobile phone number that served as a request line in between queues. With hundreds of text messages being received daily, the station was a hot topic at dozens of blogs and forums over the internet.

In April 2007, they temporarily ceased transmission so they could obtain all the necessary broadcast permits from the National Telecommunications Commission to legitimize the station. In June 2007, U Radio returned on air under the temporary license of a community-based radio station and started broadcasting with the power of 500 watts.

Recently, on April 20, 2013, 107.9 U-Radio ceased its operation, due to the claims of the Professional Regulations Commission and the National Telecommunications Commission that it was a pirate station, and its expired license. However, it continued its broadcast online.

===2015-present: Post-107.9 U-Radio===
====98.3 Radyo Kontra Droga====
The Filipino hip-hop and rap formatted station was founded in late 2015 by two-way radio dealer and proprietor Ron Flores Cruz at a Paco, Manila studio in time for then-candidate for President Rodrigo Duterte&#x27;s campaign, initially as a limited-time nightly operation that later expanded to as much as 18 hours daily. At the onset of operations, the station positioned itself first on 88.7 FM before moving to what was formerly occupied legitimately by DZMC, the Polytechnic University of the Philippines&#x27; campus radio until it went on hiatus in November 2008. Its 50-watt signal covered parts of the immediate Manila area.

Listeners contended that the station was pirate due to the then-perceived absence of an immediate public concern over a massive crackdown on illegal drugs and the political propaganda.

In July 2018, the Polytechnic University of the Philippines resumed test broadcasts on the same frequency until recommencing full-time services by September, forming a currently unresolved broadcasting conflict. Owing to the proximity of both Paco and Santa Mesa, Manila where the campus station is located, both have significantly interfered with each other.

In October 2018, Radyo Kontra Droga temporarily went off the air to accommodate Cruz&#x27;s campaign for a seat in the Manila City Council representing the city&#x27;s 5th district in the 2019 local and national midterm elections, but lost. The station resumed operations in November of the same year, competing with both DZMC and another pirate station on the frequency.

====DHub Online Radio====
The station was first detected by authorities in mid-2019. The firm is reportedly operated by a Malolos, Bulacan-based herbal medicine group but was reportedly transmitting from atop a condominium in the vicinity of SM North EDSA using a portable transmitter. According to intelligence reports it had utilized two frequencies, but mostly transmitted on 98.3 FM.

On February 14, 2020 the station moved to 87.9 FM, a frequency legitimately assigned to, and operated by Ateneo de Manila University&#x27;s Radyo Katipunan, causing both stations to significantly jam each other. It lasted for three weeks before moving back to 98.3 FM. So far, no punitive actions against the station from the NTC have been undertaken yet, adding up to the still-unresolved conflict between the Polytechnic University&#x27;s DZMC and Radyo Kontra Droga.

====Radyo Kontra Weeaboo====
The multiplexed pirate network of stations are heavily J-pop formatted outlets promoting itself as &quot;edgy radio stations&quot; in the whole of Metro Manila that target a niche segment of anime lovers especially cosplayers. The whole venture was started on May 31, 2017, playing J-pop, anime and tokusatsu soundtracks and a series of Morse codes in between songs that read &quot;RKW&quot;. It is reportedly run by a group led by an amateur radio operator. 
The stations are respectively broadcasting on 107.1 FM as RKW-1 Southern Metro Manila and 89.5 FM as RKW-2 Northern Metro Manila, housed in Pasay and Quezon City while maintaining the main studio located in Cavite City. The outlet later started simulcasting online.

Prior to commencement of operations, the 89.5 FM spot was last legally operated as De La Salle University&#x27;s Green Giant FM upon its launch in 2008 until the station migrated exclusively online. Since 2013, the frequency, however, has a presence in southern Metro Manila through Santo Tomas, Batangas-based Apollo Broadcast Investors O&amp;O DWEG 89.5. The 107.1 spot had previously been a dormant position since 2010, lastly occupied by Z-107 (DWYZ), a low-power hip-hop formatted station that ceased operations after failing to secure a renewed permit from the NTC.

Complaints about the stations have been levelled due to its expletive-riddled and copyright infringed station ID that is using an altered version of Super Radyo DZBB 594&#x27;s 2017 jingle. The stations have reportedly been illegally reusing callsigns, the first being DZTT at 89.5 (pronounced D-Z-double-T, a parody of the DZBB-AM calls and also a play on the Filipino word for the male genitalia) and DWBU at 107.1. The latter calls, however, are legally held by the Bicol University&#x27;s campus radio. Furthermore, the stations have earned the ire of a non-profit group composed of broadcasters and radio enthusiasts.

So far, no documented actions by the National Telecommunications Commission against the stations have been released.

====2017-2018: Pathway Radio Cebu====
Pathway Radio 100.7, started its operation in Cebu around January 2017, broadcasting a religious format and operated at a very low power of 100 watts. The station was promoted as a member of Community Broadcasters Association of the Philippines (CBAP), an organization that consists of other community broadcasters across the Philippines and has no affiliation to the KBP. In July 2018, Pathway Radio 100.7 ceased broadcasting, due to technical difficulties, absence of broadcast permits from the National Telecommunications Commission, as well as frequency spacing regulations.

===Others===
====Negros Oriental====
In January 2016, the &quot;Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster ng Pilipinas&quot;–Negros Oriental chapter filed a complaint with the provincial office of the NTC against at least 14 alleged illegally-operating FM radio stations in the province. Based on their monitoring, these stations aired commercials and blocktime programs while not paying taxes to the government, and lacked locally-issued permits; while some were reportedly owned by politicians seeking media mileage during the election period. By June 2022, six of them have been formally licensed by the NTC:
* Bais: DYDB 88.9 &quot;Beat FM&quot;; DYEL 104.7 &quot;Like Radio&quot;
* Dumaguete: DYFL 90.5 &quot;Like Radio&quot;
* Bayawan: DYLN 107.5 &quot;Magic FM&quot;
* Siaton: DYSW 94.5, formerly &quot;Radyo ni Juan&quot;
* Guihulngan: DYJL 94.5 &quot;Like Radio&quot; 

Other stations included:
* Tanjay: 98.3 FM; 103.8 FM; 101.9 FM; and 102.5 &quot;Connect FM&quot;.
* Tayasan: 98.1 &quot;Muews Radio&quot;
* Valencia: 102.3 DYPW
* Jimalalud: 90.5 &quot;Mabuhay Radio&quot;

Meanwhile, by late 2021, the (Central Visayas) identified 16 illegal FM radio station operators in the province; the commission called for their compliance with the government requirements, summoning all of them for mediation proceedings.

====Mindanao====
In the first half of 2018, the monitored the operations of at least 35 illegal radio stations in Davao Region, with five of them allgedly set up prior to the 2018 Barangay and Sangguniang Kabataan elections (BSKE). As a cease and desist order was recommended for almost all stations, it was only given to six of them, all located in Davao and Digos cities, and Bansalan and Lupon towns. It was reported that stations were hijacking frequencies from the legal ones, for instance, a few illegal operators from Mati, Davao Oriental utilized FM allocations reserved for Davao City; a station in the province was reportedly owned by a member of the House; and that stations usually utilized an allegedly homemade portable transmitter. The commission admitted that most of these stations were instrumental in the presidential campaign of Rodrigo Duterte in 2016. The number of such stations reportedly increased, mostly being installed by politicians for their campaign and operating in houses or establishments, particularly prior to the local elections of 2019 and of 2022 when it reached 50, with some voluntarily shutting down after the elections, but as the commission admitted, these were expected to be operational in time for the (later-postponed) Barangay and Sangguniang Kabataan elections (BSKE).

On the other hand, in October 2024, the launched an operation against unlicensed radio stations in Northern Mindanao that broadcast fake news and questionable political commentaries, as well as legitimate stations with expired franchises. In a surprise inspection, at least 17 stations, found to be unlicensed or lacking permits despite having a legislative franchise, were closed as they were given cease and desist and show cause orders from the NTC central office. The commission&#x27;s investigation showed that these unlicensed stations, in order to reach target audiences particularly in the hinterland barangays, are using equipment which had been bought through online selling platforms; and some secretly setting up their transmitters on trees and elevated areas. They also noticed that the subject stations, along with others, are operational during the height of election campaigns.

==Vietnam==
Radio First Termer was a pirate radio station which operated in January 1971 in Saigon during the Vietnam War.

The station was hosted by a United States Air Force sergeant (born August 15, 1948) calling himself &quot;Dave Rabbit&quot;. The two other members of the crew were known as &quot;Pete Sadler&quot; and &quot;Nguyen&quot;. Their real names were Don Wade and Roma, a WLS team.

After three tours in Vietnam, &quot;Dave Rabbit&quot; and his friends launched Radio First Termer from a secret studio in a Saigon brothel. The station broadcast for 63 hours over 21 nights (between 1 January 1971 and 21 January 1971).

The station played &quot;hard acid rock&quot; such as Steppenwolf, Bloodrock, Three Dog Night, Led Zeppelin, Sugarloaf, the James Gang, and Iron Butterfly, bands which were popular among the troops but largely ignored by the American Forces Vietnam Network. The music was mixed with antiwar commentary, skits poking fun at the U.S. Air Force and Lyndon B. Johnson, and raunchy sex and drug oriented jokes.

During the mid-1990s, sound clips from a Radio First Termer broadcast posted on the internet renewed interest in the station. In February 2006, &quot;Dave Rabbit&quot; came forward and told his story. He also did an interview for a bonus feature on the DVD release of &quot;Sir! No Sir!&quot;, a film about G.I. counterculture during the Vietnam era.

Although the frequency was always announced as FM69, in reality, the show was broadcast over numerous frequencies, in addition to 69 MHz as selected by the Radio Relay troops across Vietnam. It was also broadcast over AM frequencies, including 690 AM.

In February 2008 audio clips of this underground radio show made their way into the hands Opie &amp; Anthony and 3rd mic Jim Norton. They played some of the audio of these shows over the air at both their terrestrial radio show and their XM Satellite radio show and were impressed with the skills of Dave Rabbit back in &quot;the &#x27;Nam&quot; which led to renewed interest on such sites as Google.

<text>This is an incomplete list of [[Prisoner-of-war camp|Prisoner of War (POW) Camp]]s located in the [[United Kingdom]] during [[World War II]].

German POWs in England were graded as follows: &quot;Grade A (white) were considered anti-Nazi; Grade B (grey) had less clear feelings and were considered not as reliable as the &#x27;whites&#x27;; Grade C (black) had probable Nazi leanings; Grade C+ (also Black) were deemed ardent Nazis.&quot;

Some camps were classed as General Processing Camps (abbreviated GPC in the table).

There was a large amount of renaming, renumbering and reuse of camp numbers during World War II. The reason for this is unknown but speculation has it that it was to confuse the Axis powers in the event of any attempted breakouts after any potential Paratrooper attack or invasion. Examples:&lt;br&gt;No. 286 Purfleet Camp, Beacon Hill, Purfleet, Essex&lt;br&gt;No. 654 Purfleet Camp, No.4 Transit Camp, Beacon Hill, Purfleet, Essex&lt;br&gt;No. 655 Purfleet Camp, No.1 Transit Camp, Beacon Hill, Purfleet, Essex

<text>Patrick Duigenan, [[Privy Council of Ireland|PC (I)]] [[King&#x27;s Counsel|KC]], FTCD (1735–11 April 1816), Irish lawyer and politician, was the son of a Leitrim Catholic farmer surnamed Ó Duibhgeannáin.

Through the tuition of the local Protestant clergyman, who was interested in the boy, he got a scholarship in 1756 at Trinity College, Dublin, and subsequently became a fellow. At some point he joined the Anglican faith. He studied law at the Middle Temple, was called to the Irish bar in 1767 and obtained a rich practice, mainly in the area of law relating to tithes. At that time tithes were levied from the majority Roman Catholic population for the benefit of the minority Church of Ireland, and were consequently unpopular. In spite of his Anglican convictions, he provided his Catholic wife with a chapel at their home and arranged for a priest to say Mass for her on Sundays. He opposed the Maynooth Grant and was appointed Grand Secretary of the Orange Order in 1801.

He is remembered, however, mainly as a politician, on account of his opposition to Grattan, his support of the Union, and his violent antagonism to Catholic emancipation, both in the Irish House of Commons and in pamphlets. As a Member of Parliament (MP), he represented Old Leighlin one of the Bishop’s boroughs of the Irish Parliament between 1791 and 1798 and subsequently Armagh Borough until 1801. He sat then for Armagh City in the first Parliament of the United Kingdom. He was a member of the Privy Counsel of Ireland from 1808 and a well-known character at Westminster until he died on 11 April 1816.

He had married twice; firstly around 1782, to Angelina, daughter of Thomas Berry of Eglish Castle, King&#x27;s County, and secondly, on 2 October 1807, Hester Watson, the widow of George Heppenstall, solicitor to the Dublin police, of Sandymount. He had no children by either marriage.
