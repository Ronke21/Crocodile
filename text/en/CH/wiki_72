<text>Dermod O&#x27;Meara (; fl. 1610–46) was an Irish physician and poet, author of the first medical work printed in Dublin in 1619. He was the father of Edmund O&#x27;Meara.

==Biography==

He was a son of Domhnaill O&#x27;Meara, lord of the Ó Meadhra lineage and foster-father to Thomas Butler. His family were hereditary physicians and poets to the Earls of Ormond.

O&#x27;Meara&#x27;s first published work—also the first book of Latin verse published in Ireland—was &quot;Ormonius&quot;, published in 1614. It is a praise poem in the epic style about the life of Thomas Butler. In it, O&#x27;Meara describes himself as one of the vates, and claims that Thomas was suckled as a baby by Áine, an Irish goddess.

Subsequently, O&#x27;Meara studied medicine at, and graduated from, Reims University. He returned To Ireland and wrote &quot;De Moribus: Pathologia Hereditaria Generalis&quot;, a text on hereditary diseases. In It, he claims that some diseases as well as other traits are inherited, that there are two sets of hereditary information, one from the mother and one from the father, and that weak traits may be masked by strong traits.

In later life, O&#x27;Meara and his family broke with the house of Ormond during the Confederation of Kilkenny, in which they favored a complete break with England. Dermod was reported to have gone to the court of King Charles I. He was indicted in Ireland for high treason, but apparently never apprehended.

<text>The Opel Speedster is a mid-engined, targa-topped, two-seat sports car produced by German automaker Opel from July 2000 to July 2005. It was built in both RHD and LHD versions at the Lotus Cars plant in Hethel, Norfolk, England. It was presented at the Geneva Motor Show in March 1999 and went into full production the following year.

It was sold by Vauxhall as the VX220 in the United Kingdom and shared much in common with the Lotus Elise, although Opel claimed few parts were interchangeable.

==Design and development==

Due to changes in European crash safety regulations for the 2000 model year, Lotus needed to replace the original Elise. In October 1999, a deal was made between Lotus and General Motors in order for the former to gain sufficient funds to develop a new Elise. As part of the deal, Lotus agreed to develop and produce the Opel Speedster and Vauxhall VX220 on a variation of its new Series 2 Elise chassis, having a 30mm longer wheelbase and lower door sills compared to its Lotus counterpart. The first Speedster concept car was shown at the 1999 Geneva Motor Show.

Whilst the new Elise would use a Toyota ZZ engine, similar to that found in the Toyota Celica, the Speedster was designed to use a GM Ecotec engine from the Opel Astra. Neither engine had been used in the original Elise, which was fitted with a 1.8-litre Rover K-Series engine.

In order to accommodate the production of the new cars, Lotus expanded its Hethel factory to a capacity of 10,000 cars, with around 3,500 slots allocated towards the Speedster. Production of the Speedster commenced in March 2001.

The Speedster utilized an aluminium frame that weighed only , and bodywork made entirely of fibreglass. The entire car weighed , making it roughly lighter than the similarly sized Toyota MR2. The Speedster&#x27;s all-aluminium alloy 2.2 L Z22SE engine produced , making the Speedster considerably more powerful than the Series 2 Elise was at launch.

==Production==
As an answer to calls for a more powerful version of the Speedster, Opel introduced a new two-litre turbocharged version of the Ecotec engine, which produced , but also weighed slightly more at .

In 2004, a limited run of sixty track-focused Speedsters were produced for the United Kingdom. The Vauxhall VXR220 was equipped with larger brakes, upgraded tyres and lowered suspension, and tuned to produce . Other features included further performance-oriented seats and unique Speedline alloy wheels. The wheels were 16 inches at the front and 17 inches at the rear, the same as on the Elise. Calypso Red was the only available exterior colour.

The turbocharged Speedster was able to reach a top speed of and accelerate from 0 to in 4.7 seconds.

In 2005, General Motors introduced a Daewoo badged Vauxhall VX220 at Incheon International Airport in South Korea at the GM Daewoo showroom. However, only one was built for marketing purposes while the car was sold as an Opel Speedster.

In April 2001, comedian Griff Rhys Jones was dismissed by Vauxhall following an advert for the VX220 the previous year that drew negative attention, with Vauxhall stating that they wanted to move in a different direction. The advert was also voted “Worst of the Year” by an industry magazine.

Production ended on 22 July 2005, after five years, with no direct successor. It was not until February 2007, when GM Europe adopted the Pontiac Solstice/Saturn Sky into the Opel GT, that GM Europe had a replacement sector product, albeit with no RHD version for the United Kingdom. The final production number of the Speedster was only 7,207.

==Opel ECO Speedster==
The Opel ECO Speedster is a concept car made by Opel in 2002. Related to the production Opel Speedster, it is a two-door coupe with two seats, gullwing doors, and no wing mirrors. It was displayed at the 2002 Paris Motor Show.

<doc id="1032574" wikidata="Q1637563" url="?curid=1032574" title="Hundi">
<text>A hundi or hundee is a financial instrument that was developed in Medieval India for use in trade and credit transactions. Hundis are used as a form of remittance instrument to transfer money from place to place, as a form of credit instrument or IOU to borrow money and as a bill of exchange in trade transactions. The Reserve Bank of India describes the hundi as &quot;an unconditional order in writing made by a person directing another to pay a certain sum of money to a person named in the order.&quot;

==History==

Hundis have a very long history in India. Written records show their use at least as far back as the Twelfth century. The merchant Banarasi Das Belonging to the Digambara Jain Sect, born 1586, received a hundi for 200 rupees from his father to enable him to borrow money to start trading.

During the colonial era, the British government regarded the hundi system as indigenous or traditional, but not informal. They were reluctant to interfere with it as it formed such an important part of the Indian economy and they also wished to tax the transactions taking place within the system. Official hundi forms were produced incorporating revenue stamps bearing the image of British monarchs, including Queen Victoria, and disputes between merchants often entered the court system, so in no way was the system an underground one even though it did not take place through normal banking channels.

==Types of hundi==
*Sahyog Hundi: This is drawn by one merchant on another, asking the latter to pay the amount to a third merchant. In this case the merchant on whom the hundi is drawn is of some &#x27;credit worthiness&#x27; in the market and is known in the bazaar. A sahyog hundi passes from one hand to another until it reaches the final recipient, who, after reasonable enquiries, presents it to the drawee for acceptance of the payment. Sahyog means co-operation in Hindi and Gujrati, the predominant languages of traders. The hundi is so named because it required the co-operation of multiple parties to ensure that the hundi has an acceptable risk and fairly good likelihood of being paid, in the absence of a formalized credit monitoring and reporting framework.
*Darshani Hundi: This is a hundi payable on sight. It must be presented for payment within a reasonable time after its receipt by the holder. Thus, it is similar to a demand bill.
*Muddati Hundi: A muddati or miadi hundi is payable after a specified period of time. This is similar to a time bill.

There are few other varieties; the Nam-jog hundi, Dhani-jog hundi, Jawabee hundi, Jokhami hundi, Firman-jog hundi, etc.

* Nam-jog hundi - such a hundi is payable only to the person whose name is mentioned on the Hundi. Such a hundi cannot be endorsed in favour of any other person and is akin to a bill on which a restrictive endorsement has been made.
* Furman-jog Hundi - such a hundi can be paid either to the person whose name is mentioned in the hundi or to any person so ordered by him. Such a hundi is similar to a cheque payable on order and no endorsement is required on such a hundi.
* Dhani-jog Hundi - when the hundi is payable to the holder or bearer, it is known as a dhani jog hundi. It is similar to an instrument payable to bearer.
* Jokhim-Hundi - normally a hundi is unconditional but a jokhim hundi is conditional in the sense that the drawer promises to pay the amount of the hundi only on the satisfaction of a certain condition. Such a hundi is not negotiable, and the prevalence of such hundis is very rare these days because banks and insurance companies refuse to accept such hundis.
* Jawabi Hundi - if money is transferred from one place to another through the hundi and the person receiving the payment on is to give an acknowledgement (jawab) for same, then such a hundi is known as a Jawabi Hundi.
* Khaka Hundi - a hundi which has already been paid is known as a Khaka Hundi.
* Khoti Hundi - In case there is any kind of defect in the hundi or in case the hundi has been forged, then such a hundi is known as a khoti hundi.

<doc id="1032576" wikidata="Q452525" url="?curid=1032576" title="Vauxhall Belmont">
<text>The Vauxhall Belmont is a saloon car sold in Great Britain by Vauxhall between January 1986 and September 1991. It is a rebadged version of the Opel Kadett E saloon, with this bodystyle launched in September 1985. The other body styles of the Kadett E were marketed in the United Kingdom as Vauxhall Astra. The Belmont won praise for its huge boot compared to other rivals of the time.

With hatchbacks becoming firmly established as the preferred bodystyle in small European family cars, fewer saloons were on offer. During the 1980s, in order to enable them to position saloons as a slight cut above their hatchback counterparts, many manufacturers marketed them with different nameplates. 

Ford of Europe&#x27;s saloon version of the Ford Escort hatchback was badged the Ford Orion, and the Volkswagen Golf based saloon was sold as the Volkswagen Jetta.

However, when GM launched a saloon version of the Vauxhall Astra/Opel Kadett, only British customers received it with a different badge. The Belmont went on sale in January 1986. While sold as a Kadett in the rest of Europe, in South Africa, it was called the Opel Monza (not to be confused with the large Senator based coupé sold in Europe) along with a convertible. This replaced the Opel Ascona.

When the Astra II was replaced in September 1991, the Belmont nameplate was shelved, the car never having never lived up to Vauxhall&#x27;s claim that it was &quot;not just a booted Astra&quot;.

In December 2004, it was revealed that the Belmont was the most stolen car in the United Kingdom in terms of ratio stolen, with 1,978 vehicles stolen in 2003, which amounted to around 1 out of every 10 Belmonts registered. At this time, an estimated 20,000 Belmonts remained on the road. The car also topped a similar list for 2005, this list being published in December 2006.

As of 2019, according to records by the DVLA, only twenty three Belmonts remain on the roads, with a further sixty nine on SORN. This has made it a very rare car on British roads.

== End of the Belmont ==
Vauxhall deleted the Belmont nametag with the launch of the Mark 3 Astra in September 1991, and the Astra nameplate was used on all body styles. For later variant of the Astra, see the Opel Astra. Sales of the Astra badged saloon were not as strong as those achieved by the Belmont, as saloons of this size continued to fall in popularity throughout the 1990s.

Later Astra saloons were also sold as an Opel, unlike the Belmont, which in the United Kingdom was only sold as a Vauxhall. The saloon version was dropped altogether in March 2004, upon the launch of the MK V Astra, although right hand drive saloons with Opel badges have continued to be sold in Ireland.

<text>Kutchi (; કચ્છી, , ڪڇّي) or Kachhi is a dialect of Sindhi spoken in the Kutch region of Gujarat, and some parts of Rajasthan, India and Sindh, Pakistan.

== Influences from other languages ==
Some scholars have considered Kutchi to be a dialect of Sindhi, but the two languages are quite distinct from one another. Over time, it has borrowed vocabulary from Gujarati. The variety of Kutchi spoken in Sindh and in the Banni region of Kutch is more similar to the Lari dialect of Sindhi, whereas the Kutchi spoken in the eastern parts of Kutch has more Gujarati influence, and is slowly becoming more similar to Gujarati.

Most Kutchis living in India are bilingual or trilingual, due to exposure to closely related neighbouring languages such as Gujarati. Many Pakistani Kutchis are also bilingual or trilingual; many residents of Karachi speak Kutchi. Its differences from neighbouring languages are more pronounced in its spoken varieties, but it has many loans from Gujarati, Marwari (a major western Rajasthani language) and Hindi-Urdu as well. Kutchi-speakers are often part of the Charans, Jadeja, Bhanushalis, Lohanas, Brahmins (Rajgor), Meghwals, Visa Oswal and Dasa Osval (Oshwal) Jains, Ismaili Khojas and followers of the Satpanth, Bhatias, Rabaris, Muslim Kutchi Khatris, the Muslim Rajput-Rayma, or Kutchi Memons.

During the British reign, many traders and families of the Kutchi communities left the Indian subcontinent and settled in regions of East Africa such as Kenya, Somalia, Tanzania, Uganda, Zaire/Congo, and even as far south as South Africa. The landing point of entry into Africa was in Zanzibar, a trading post of goods between India and East Africa in the late 1800s. Kutchi communities in this region often integrated Swahili words and phrases into their language, producing a creole language called Kutchi-Swahili.

== Common words and phrases ==
There are distinct regional accents and variations in grammar. As in many languages spoken along Asian trade routes. Many Kutchi speakers also speak Gujarati as a separate language, especially as it is the language in which Kutchi speakers customarily write. Kutchi speakers&#x27; Gujarati accent and usage tends towards standard forms that any Gujarati speaker would be able to understand.

The following words are commonly used by Hindu individuals descending from the Kutch rural area of Gujarat, India, who, especially if in east Africa, reject Kutchi. These are colloquial forms of general Gujarati phrases that are often used in daily conversation in villages, particularly of Kutchi predominance, and are Gujaratisized versions of Kutchi words. Kutchi is also very close to Sindhi and Gujarati due to historical, cultural and geographic influences. These relationships are evident in the following examples:

== Writing system ==
Kutchi is normally written using a modified version of the Gujarati script. Many books and magazines are published in the language using the modified Gujarati script, including &quot;Vadhod&quot; (&quot;Inquiry&quot;). In parts of Pakistan, the modified Perso-Arabic script is used instead. In earlier times it was written in the Khudabadi and Khojki scripts, the latter of which is now extinct. Additionally, there may have been a Kutchi script, samples of which may be in the Kutch Museum. Below is a table of how different Kutchi words can be written in different scripts:

One of the issues confronting research into the Kutchi is the inaccessibility of information about the language. The Kutchi Language Online website (now archived) maintains a list of Kutchi vocabulary words, which can be accessed through their website. Dr Rajul Shah, an ayurvedic doctor, psychologist and a graphologist has created a script to use for the language.

<doc id="1032581" wikidata="Q672763" url="?curid=1032581" title="Old Crow, Yukon">
<text>Old Crow is a community in the Canadian territory of Yukon.

Located in a periglacial environment, the community is situated on the Porcupine River in the far northern part of the territory. Old Crow is the only Yukon community that cannot be reached by motor vehicle, requiring visitors to fly in to Old Crow Airport. It is a dry community. Old Crow is also the northernmost non-Inuit indigenous community in North America, and one of only a few such communities north of the Arctic Circle outside of Eurasia.

== History ==

A large number of apparently human modified animal bones have been discovered in the Old Crow area, notably at Bluefish Caves, about south, and the Old Crow Flats, located about south, that have been dated to 25,000–40,000 years ago by carbon dating, several thousand years earlier than generally accepted human habitation of North America.

An Indigenous chief named Deetru` K`avihdik, literally &quot;Crow-May-I-Walk&quot;, helped settle a community here around the 1870s and the town was named after him. The village was founded around muskrat trapping, which continues to provide basic income.

The people of Old Crow are dependent on the Porcupine caribou herd for food and clothing. The Porcupine caribou herd migrates to the coastal plain in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) in Alaska to give birth to their young. Many citizens of Old Crow believe the herd is being seriously threatened by oil-drilling in the ANWR and have been heavily involved in lobbying to prevent it.

Fiddling and dances are important to the local culture. The first fiddle was brought to the community over 100 years ago after being introduced by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. Fiddler Benjamin Boyd noted that many fiddlers would learn tunes at the dances, and due to the isolation of the community, the fiddle style in Old Crow is unique. In 2024, Old Crow was inducted into the Canadian Fiddle Hall of Honour at the Canadian Grand Masters held in Whitehorse, Yukon. 

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Canadian census conducted by Statistics Canada, Old Crow had a population of 236 living in 116 of its 168 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 221. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

Most of its population are Gwichʼin, a First Nations people who belong to the Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation.

== Infrastructure ==
=== Transportation ===
Old Crow Airport provides year-round transportation to other communities. During winter time, a temporary winter road is sometimes built from Eagle Plains to transport freight into Old Crow; it is not annual, but only when a significant need arises such as a major building project.

=== Energy supply ===
Electric energy is supplied by three diesel generators (170 kW, 330 kW and 600 kW), operated by ATCO Electric Yukon. As the community has no road access, diesel fuel needs to be flown in.

In 2019, the microgrid was extended by a PV plant which generates electricity in the summer season, thus saving about 190.000 litres of diesel per year (~$400,000 /a). The plant has been built in a back-to-back configuration to receive a mostly continuous solar harvest during the day. Consequently, the DC capacity of the PV panels (in sum 940 kWpeak) is partly orientated westwards and partly eastwards; the AC capacity of the PV inverter is 480 kW. A battery energy storage system (BESS) has been added with an energy capacity of 350 kWh, balancing out smaller cloud fluctuations and avoiding rapid start stop cycles of the diesel gensets. The whole PV-BESS plant is $6.5 million and shall last for at least 25 years.

By May 2021, the solar plant had begun producing electricity, projected to be fully operational by July and capable of letting the community turn off their diesel generators on sunny days.

=== Communications ===
Old Crow is served by Northwestel since 1971. The long-distance connection originally relied on a microwave relay at Rat Pass near the Yukon/NWT border, which also provide a radio-telephone base station along the Dempster Highway, but it was frequently out of service in winter when weather conditions made helicopter access hazardous. In the late 1980s, a satellite ground station was installed in Old Crow, providing more reliable service.

The long-distance connection is noteworthy for two minor incidents. In 1985, the Yukon territorial election was covered by live television coverage for the first time, sent by satellite to Toronto for switching into the network stations in Yukon; however, results from Old Crow were unavailable due to the microwave failure. On 11 September 2001, the satellite connection went out of service, and an aircraft bringing a technician to repair it was challenged by Canadian Forces aircraft for violating the closure of airspace throughout North America.

The community operated its own television transmitter to carry CBC television signals from satellite. The current status of this transmitter is unknown since the CBC in 2012 closed down analog transmitters it owned. The community has APTN television, as well as CHON-FM and CKRW transmitters and a community-owned transmitter picking up CBC station CHAK-AM in Inuvik.

== Geography ==
=== Climate ===
Old Crow has a subarctic climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfc&quot;) with mild summers and severely cold winters. Average annual temperature is . Old Crow experiences annual temperature average daily highs of in July and average daily lows of in January. Record high temperature was on August 30, 1976, and the lowest was on January 5, 1975. Precipitation is very low, but is somewhat higher in the summer. Average annual snowfall is and rainfall is .

As Old Crow is located north of the Arctic Circle, it experiences polar day or midnight sun in summer and polar night in winter.
The midnight sun is typically between May 5 and August 8 inclusive, while the polar night usually starts around December 14 and ends by December 29.

It was a form of unanimity voting rule that allowed any member of the Sejm (legislature) to force an immediate end to the current session and to nullify any legislation that had already been passed at the session by shouting either &quot;Sisto activitatem!&quot; (Latin: &quot;I stop the activity!&quot;) or &quot;Nie pozwalam!&quot; (Polish: &quot;I do not allow!&quot;). The rule was in place from the mid-17th century to the late 18th century in the Sejm&#x27;s parliamentary deliberations. It was based on the premise that since all of the Polish–Lithuanian noblemen were equal, every measure that came before the Sejm had to be passed unanimously. The &quot;liberum veto&quot; was a key part of the political system of the Commonwealth, strengthening democratic elements and checking royal power and went against the European-wide trend of having a strong executive (absolute monarchy).

Many historians hold that the &quot;liberum veto&quot; was a major cause of the deterioration of the Commonwealth political system, particularly in the 18th century, when foreign powers bribed Sejm members to paralyze its proceedings, causing foreign occupation, dominance and manipulation of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and its eventual destruction in the partitions. Piotr Stefan Wandycz wrote that the &quot;&quot;liberum veto&quot; had become the sinister symbol of old Polish anarchy&quot;. In the period of 1573–1763, about 150 sejms were held, about a third failing to pass any legislation, mostly because of the &quot;liberum veto&quot;. The expression &quot;Polish parliament&quot; in many European languages originated from the apparent paralysis.

==Origin==
The rule evolved from the principle of unanimous consent, which derived from the traditions of decision making in the Kingdom of Poland, and it developed under the federative character of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Each deputy represented a region in the Sejm, himself being elected at a sejmik (the local &quot;sejm&quot; of a region). He thus assumed responsibility to his sejmik for all decisions taken at the Sejm. Since all noblemen were considered equal, a decision taken by a majority against the will of a minority (even if only one sejmik) was considered a violation of the principle of political equality.

At first, the dissenting deputies were often convinced or cowed back to withdraw their objections. Also, at first, the rule was used to strike down only individual laws, not to dissolve the chamber and throw out all measures passed. For example, as historian Władysław Czapliński describes in the Sejm of 1611 context, some resolutions were struck down, but others passed. From the mid-17th century onward, however, an objection to any item of Sejm legislation from a deputy or senator automatically caused other, earlier adopted legislation to be rejected. That was because all legislation that was adopted by a given Sejm formed a whole.

It is commonly and erroneously believed that a Sejm was first disrupted by the &quot;liberum veto&quot; by a Trakai deputy, Władysław Siciński, in 1652. In reality, he vetoed only the continuation of the Sejm&#x27;s deliberations beyond the statutory time limit. He had, however, set up a dangerous precedent. Over the proceedings of the next few sejms, the veto was still occasionally overruled, but it became gradually more accepted. Before 20 years had passed, in 1669 in Kraków, the entire Sejm was prematurely disrupted on the strength of the &quot;liberum veto&quot; before it had finished its deliberations by the Kyiv deputy, Adam Olizar. The practice spiraled out of control, and in 1688, the Sejm was dissolved even before the proceedings had begun or the Marshal of the Sejm was elected.

==Zenith==
During the reign of John III Sobieski (1674–1696), half of Sejm proceedings were scuttled by the veto. The practice also spread from the national Sejm to local sejmik proceedings. In the first half of the 18th century, it became increasingly common for Sejm sessions to be broken up by the &quot;liberum veto&quot;, as the Commonwealth&#x27;s neighbours, chiefly Russia and Prussia, found it to be a useful tool to frustrate attempts at reforming and strengthening the Commonwealth. By bribing deputies to exercise their vetoes, Poland–Lithuania&#x27;s neighbours could derail any measures not to their liking. The Commonwealth deteriorated from a European power into a state of anarchy. Only a few Sejms were able to meet during the reign of the House of Saxony in Poland (1696–1763), the last one in 1736. Only 8 out of the 18 Sejm sessions during the reign of Augustus II (1697–1733) passed legislation. For a period of 30 years around the reign of Augustus III, only one session was able to pass legislation (1734–1763). The government was near collapse, giving rise to the term &quot;Polish anarchy&quot;, and the country was managed by provincial assemblies and magnates.

Disruption of the Commonwealth governance caused by the liberum veto was highly significant. From 1573 to 1763, about 150 Sejms were held, of which 53 failed to pass any legislation. Historian Jacek Jędruch notes that out of the 53 disrupted Sejms, 32 were disrupted by the &quot;liberum veto&quot;.

==Final years==
The 18th century saw an institution known as a &quot;confederated sejm&quot; evolve. It was a parliament session that operated under the rules of a confederation. Its primary purpose was to avoid disruption by the &quot;liberum veto&quot;, unlike the national Sejm, which was being paralyzed by the veto. On some occasions, a confederated sejm was formed of the whole membership of the national Sejm so that the &quot;liberum veto&quot; would not operate.

The second half of the 18th century, marking the age of the Polish Enlightenment, also witnessed an increased trend aiming at the reform of the Commonwealth&#x27;s inefficient governance. Reforms of 1764–1766 improved the Sejm&#x27;s proceedings. Majority voting for non-crucial items, including most economic and tax matters, was introduced, with binding instructions from sejmiks being outlawed. The road to reform was not easy, as conservatives, supported by foreign powers, opposed most of the changes and attempted to defend the &quot;liberum veto&quot; and other elements perpetuating the inefficient governance, most notably by the Cardinal Laws of 1768.

The &quot;liberum veto&quot; was finally abolished by the Constitution of 3 May 1791, adopted by a confederated sejm, which permanently established the principle of majority rule. The achievements of that constitution, however, which historian Norman Davies called &quot;the first constitution of its kind in Europe&quot;, were undone by another confederated sejm, meeting at Grodno in 1793. That Sejm, under duress from Russia and Prussia, ratified the Second Partition, anticipating the Third Partition, the final dissolution of the Polish-Lithuanian state, just two years later.

==Significance==
Harvard political scientist Grzegorz Ekiert, assessing the history of the &quot;liberum veto&quot; in Poland–Lithuania, concludes:
: The principle of the liberum veto preserved the feudal features of Poland&#x27;s political system, weakened the role of the monarchy, led to anarchy in political life, and contributed to the economic and political decline of the Polish state. Such a situation made the country vulnerable to foreign invasions and ultimately led to its collapse.

Political scientist Dalibor Roháč noted that the &quot;principle of &quot;liberum veto&quot; played an important role in [the] emergence of the unique Polish form of constitutionalism&quot; and acted as a significant constraint on the powers of the monarch by making the &quot;rule of law, religious tolerance and limited constitutional government... the norm in Poland in times when the rest of Europe was being devastated by religious hatred and despotism.&quot; 

It was seen as one of the key principles of the Commonwealth political system and culture, the Golden Liberty.

At the same time, historians hold that the principle of &quot;liberum veto&quot; was a major cause of the deterioration of the Commonwealth political system and Commonwealth&#x27;s eventual downfall. Deputies bribed by magnates or foreign powers, or simply content to believe they were living in some kind of &quot;Golden Age&quot;, for over a century paralysed the Commonwealth&#x27;s government, stemming any attempts at reform. Piotr Stefan Wandycz wrote that the &quot;&quot;liberum veto&quot; had become the sinister symbol of old Polish anarchy.&quot; Wagner echoed him thus: &quot;Certainly, there was no other institution of old Poland which has been more sharply criticized in more recent times than this one.&quot;.

==Modern parallels and popular culture==

=== References in popular culture ===
A 2004 Polish collectible card game, &quot;Veto&quot;, set in the background of a royal election during an election sejm, is named after this procedure.

In the Netflix series &quot;1670&quot;, Jan Paweł uses &quot;liberum veto&quot; to &quot;win&quot; an assembly.

=== Modern parallels ===
Until the early 1990s, IBM had a decision-making process called &quot;non-concur&quot; in which any department head could veto a company-wide strategy if it did not fit in with their own department&#x27;s outlook, the disagreements being then sent to the superiors in the hierarchy, often taking several months. This effectively turned IBM into several independent fiefdoms. &quot;Non-concur&quot; was eliminated by CEO Louis Gerstner, who was brought in to revive the declining company.

Dispositions of the European Union law requiring unanimity between states have been compared to the &quot;liberum veto&quot; by some commenters. Wallonia vetoing Belgium&#x27;s signature of the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) with Canada brought comparisons to this rule.

Decisions made by the United Nations can be dropped if a single one of the permanent members casts a negative vote regarding agenda items. In the UN Security Council, veteoes were and are frequently used by both the USSR/Russian Federation and the United States for geopolitical gains.

<text>Ladder 49 is a 2004 American disaster thriller film directed by Jay Russell and written by Lewis Colick. The film follows Baltimore firefighter Jack Morrison, who is trapped inside a warehouse fire, and his recollection of the events that got him to that point. The film stars Joaquin Phoenix and John Travolta, and was released on October 1, 2004. It received mixed reviews and grossed $102 million worldwide on $60 million budget.

==Plot==
Baltimore City firefighter Jack Morrison saves a man&#x27;s life in a massive four-alarm fire in a 20-story concrete grain elevator/warehouse in the Canton waterfront neighborhood of Baltimore, Maryland. However, the grain stored in the warehouse explodes, causing Jack to fall through several floors and break his leg. The film follows the efforts of the other men in his unit, &quot;Ladder Company 49&quot;, led by the commands of Deputy Chief Mike Kennedy, Jack&#x27;s mentor, to rescue him while Morrison tries to reach a safe area of the burning structure. Interspersed with the rescue efforts are a series of flashbacks showing how Jack joined the fire department, his first meeting (at a supermarket) with the woman who would eventually become his wife, his relationship with his children, and the bonds he formed and the trials and tribulations he endured with his fellow firefighters.

After graduating from the fire academy, Jack is sent to work on Baltimore City Fire Department (BCFD) Engine Company 33, in the busiest firehouse in the city. Quartered with Engine 33 is Ladder Company 49. On Engine 33, Jack learns the ropes of firefighting. He quickly becomes close friends with his fellow firefighters, including Mike, his Captain at the time. Jack&#x27;s first fire takes place at a burning vacant rowhouse. Engine 33 and Ladder 49 respond and are the first companies on the scene. Jack and Mike enter the building with a hose line and tackle the blaze, with Jack on the nozzle of the hose. They quickly and triumphantly extinguish it.

After some time working on Engine 33, Jack arrives at the scene of another vacant rowhouse fire, where a fellow firefighter from Ladder 49, Dennis Gauquin dies after falling through the roof of a building. After a quarrel between the firefighters, the Captain tells them to stick together. Later, numerous firefighters attend Dennis&#x27;s funeral. Jack decides, although it is more dangerous, to take his late friend&#x27;s position as a &quot;truckie&quot;, a search and rescue member on Ladder 49 by transferring to the Truck.

As the years go by, Jack suffers traumatic experiences from rescuing a man from the ledge of a burning high-rise building in Downtown Baltimore, and witnessing another friend and fellow firefighter from Ladder 49, Tommy Drake suffer severe burns following a steam explosion at an industrial building. He finds the work rewarding, but his wife worries about his safety and opposes the change. However, she eventually accepts his new role and even talks him out of taking an administrative position that Mike, who has become a Deputy Chief, offers him.

One Christmas Eve, Jack and the members of Engine 33 and Ladder 49 respond to a burning apartment building. Jack is able to rescue a young girl trapped in an engulfed apartment, but is briefly trapped himself before being rescued by a fellow Firefighter from Ladder 49, Leonard &quot;Lenny&quot; Richter. Both men receive the department&#x27;s Medal of Valor for their actions.

Back at the grain building fire that opened the film, Jack&#x27;s fellow firefighters are determined to rescue him, and Jack does his best to reach the only possible safe area, to which Mike directs him. However, upon reaching that room he sees that the only exit is cut off by raging flames. Out of air and with the heat intensifying, Jack realizes that his situation is hopeless. He radios Mike to pull his men back so that no one else gets killed or hurt while trying to rescue him, and accepts his fate. A devastated Mike reluctantly agrees and commands all rescue units to evacuate the building.

At Jack&#x27;s funeral, Mike delivers an emotional eulogy in celebration of Jack&#x27;s life, which inspires a standing ovation from friends and family in attendance. Jack&#x27;s body is then borne to its resting place with full honors, on the back of Engine 33 in a classic fireman&#x27;s funeral procession. The final scene has Mike and company en route to a call while he flashes back to Jack and his companion firefighters rushing to fires, then the final shot of Mike and Jack emerging from Jack&#x27;s first ever burning building in triumph.

==Release==
===Home media===
&quot;Ladder 49&quot; was released on VHS and DVD on March 8, 2005 by Buena Vista Home Entertainment (under the Touchstone Home Entertainment label). A Blu-ray version was released on February 13, 2007.

==Reception==
&quot;Ladder 49 &quot;grossed $74,463,263 at the US box office and $102,332,848 worldwide.

===Critical response===
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 41% based on 164 reviews, and an average rating of 5.35/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Instead of humanizing the firemen, the movie idolizes them, and thus renders them into cardboard characters.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 47 out of 100, based on 32 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

It received a rating of 3.5 out of 4 stars from Roger Ebert, who wrote: &quot;The movie is not about a dying man whose life passes before his eyes, but about a man who saved a life and put himself in danger, and how he got to that place in his life, and what his life and family mean to him. Because it is attentive to these human elements, &quot;Ladder 49&quot; draws from the action scenes instead of depending on them.&quot;

==Use in &quot;The Ricky Gervais Show&quot;==
The film later became a running gag on &quot;The Ricky Gervais Show&quot;. A DVD copy of &quot;Ladder 49&quot; frequently appears as a prize for winners of the quiz segment &quot;Rockbusters&quot; hosted by Karl Pilkington. The abundance of DVD copies and their unfavourability as rewards became a recurring joke on the program, as co-host Stephen Merchant often remarked there were many copies &quot;lying around the office&quot;.

<text>==Major events==
The second administrative reform of 1719 was carried out by Peter the Great in order to fix the deficiencies of the original system. On June 9 (May 29 in the Julian calendar), 1719 Peter issued an ukase (edict) that abolished the division of the governorates into &quot;lots&quot; (). Instead, most of the Governorates were divided into &quot;provinces&quot; (провинции), and provinces were further subdivided into &quot;districts&quot; (дистрикты). Provinces were governed by &quot;voyevodas&quot;. The idea of the subdivision of governorates into province was borrowed from the administrative division system of Sweden and other European countries. Districts were introduced to replace the old system of subdivision into &quot;uyezds&quot;; however, the borders of the new districts did not match those of the old &quot;uyezds&quot;. The purpose of the districts was also different from that of the &quot;uyezds&quot;—population of each district was taxed to support military units assigned to it.

*June 9 (May 29), 1719—Nizhny Novgorod Governorate was re-established.
*June 9 (May 29), 1719—Revel Governorate was formed on the newly acquired Baltic lands.

<doc id="1032599" wikidata="Q3740933" url="?curid=1032599" title="Dino Mech Gaiking">
<text>is a Japanese Super Robot mecha anime series produced by Toei Animation. For distribution purposes, Toei refers to this television series as Dino Mech Gaiking.

It ran from April 1976 through January 1977 and consisted of 44 episodes of 25 minutes each. &quot;Gaiking&quot; was notable for being one of the few super robot series to take place in real places outside Japan, and for being the first Super Robot series to have a mobile carrier for the chief robots. In the US, &quot;Gaiking&quot; was part of Mattel&#x27;s popular Shogun Warriors import toy line of the late 1970s and Jim Terry&#x27;s Force Five anthology series. In 2005, a re-imagining titled &quot;&quot; was produced.

==Plot==
The story chronicled the battle between the crew of the semi-transformable carrier Daikū Maryū and the Super Robot Gaiking invented by Dr. Daimonji against an invading race of aliens called the Dark Horror Army. This army hails from the planet Zela whose home planet is facing destruction by their star, Sigma, turning into a black hole as their population starts to become extinct. Notable aspects of the series include the dinosaur-based designs of the Daikū Maryū and its support machines and the use of part of the carrier to form the main robot. The robot Gaiking was piloted by former baseball star named Sanshiro Tsuwabuki who was drafted for the job because his latent psychic powers made him the only one capable of doing so, all other similarly empowered candidates having been assassinated by alien agents with he himself having been injured in an attack that ended his sports career. Gaiking is most easily distinguished from other mecha by its skull-shaped golden torso formed from the head of the Daikū Maryū and its golden horns.

The leader of the Dark Horror Army was a robot scientist named Darius The Great and all of their ships and mecha were fish-shaped, which most likely inspired the Darius series of video games. He uses four giant robotic leaders called the Death Cross Generals composed of Dr. Dankel, General Asimov, General Killer, and General Desmont. These generals used bomber-like spaceships called Grotectors to create artificial black hole vortexes to travel to Earth and back. Throughout the series the Death Cross Generals and Darius note that natives of Zela originally came to Earth for research purposes before slowly colonizing the planet and using it to hide various dark monsters with the rise of humanity, as far back as one million years before the start of the series until the twelfth century AD. For their military natives of Zela were brainwashed and genetically altered into birdmen called the dark avians with elite individuals becoming dark knights.

==Mecha==
===Gaiking===
A mecha defender robot consisting of three separate components: the Dino-Mecha&#x27;s head, an arm unit, and a leg unit (the arm and leg units are stored inside the Dino-Mecha and exit from a gateway located below the Dragon&#x27;s head). These three launch from the Dino-Mecha and combine, while in flight, to form Gaiking. Dino-Mecha&#x27;s head forms Gaiking&#x27;s core (i.e., chest and back) and contains Gaiking&#x27;s own head. Gaiking is operated by baseball star Sanshiro Tsuwabuki.

===Daikū Maryū / Dino-Mecha===
A gigantic dragon-shaped robot that defends Earth from invaders from the planet Zela. It possesses numerous weapons and houses the sections of the Gaiking robot. Both Gaiking and the Daiku Maryu are composed of the super alloy Zolmanium Steel which was later reinforced with iron deposits from the Moon.

===Nesser===
A small tank-like robot resembling a Plesiosaur, Nesser is used for scouting missions in water. Its weaponry includes lasers emitting from its eyes, a flamethrower emitting from its mouth, and three mortar cannons located on its chest.

===Skylar===
A small jet-like robot resembling a Pterodactyl, Skylar is used for scouting missions in the air. Its weaponry includes machine guns and missiles.

===Bazolar===
A small, but very fast, tank-like robot resembling a Triceratops, Bazolar is used for scouting missions on land. Its weaponry includes laser canons, a drill, and a mortar cannon.

==Production and release notes==
&quot;Gaiking&quot; was Toei Animation&#x27;s first super robot series not based on an existing manga (the company&#x27;s previous super robot anime &quot;Mazinger Z&quot;, &quot;Getter Robo&quot;, etc. were based on manga series by manga artists and writers Go Nagai and Ken Ishikawa respectively).

The program was shown in English internationally as part of Jim Terry&#x27;s &quot;Force Five&quot; lineup, and was also broadcast in Latin America as &quot;El Gladiador&quot; as part of a 4 anime mecha show called &quot;El Festival de los Robots&quot; (with the other 3 being &quot;Starzinger&quot;, &quot;Magne Robo Gakeen&quot; and &quot;Kotetsu Jeeg&quot;, known as &quot;El Galactico&quot;, &quot;Supermagnetron&quot; and &quot;El Vengador&quot;, respectively). The Jim Terry dub was released on video in the UK by Krypton Force under the name &quot;The Protectors&quot;, though the first volume of their &quot;Formators&quot; series actually contained &quot;Gaiking&quot; episodes instead of episodes from Jim Terry&#x27;s &quot;Starvengers&quot;. Another dub was produced in the late-70s by M&amp;M Productions in Hawaii, who also dubbed &quot;Mazinger Z&quot; for Toei as a potential test for a US release. Isao Sasaki did the English versions of opening and ending songs for this dub. Of this dub, only the eleventh episode survives.

The first 26 episodes of &quot;Gaiking&quot; were also aired in Italy during the Japanese super robot craze of the late 70s/early 80s, under the name &quot;Gaiking&quot;. In the late 1990s the whole series was released in Italy in dubbed DVD boxes. Two episodes from Jim Terry&#x27;s &quot;Force Five Gaiking&quot; series would be redubbed as an episode of &quot;Robo Formers&quot;.

Discotek Media acquired the rights for the entire television series and released it in a complete box set, in Japanese with English subtitles, in June 2016. Reception for the release was mostly positive, but was noted for minor translation issues with the word &quot;Ankoku&quot;, most notably renaming the Dark Horror Army and Dark Monsters to Black Horror Army and Black Monsters, respectively.

In 2009, William Winckler Productions produced three all-new English dubbed film versions edited from the original series. William Winckler, known for &quot;Tekkaman the Space Knight&quot;, wrote, produced and directed the English films, which are seen on broadband in Japan and released on DVD in North America by Shout! Factory in 2013.

==Legal controversy==
Toei Animation credited the show as being based on an original idea by Kunio Nakatani, Akio Sugino and Dan Kobayashi, but in reality the original idea was of Go Nagai. Toei deliberately took Nagai out of the credits in order to avoid the payment of royalties. Because of that, Nagai sued Toei and stopped further collaborations with Toei for a long time.&lt;ref name=&quot;INTERVISTA A: Federico Colpi - (direttore d/visual Incorporated)&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The legal battle lasted more than 10 years. Nagai himself confirmed that he was the creator of &quot;Gaiking&quot; at Comicon 2007 in Naples, Italy.

==Game appearances==
The original Gaiking first appeared in &quot;Shin Super Robot Wars&quot; for the PlayStation and later in &quot;2nd Super Robot Wars Alpha&quot; and &quot;3rd Super Robot Wars Alpha&quot;, both for the PlayStation 2.

==Hollywood remake==
* A live-action film based on the series, entitled &quot;Gaiking&quot;, was announced at the 2010 Tokyo Animation Fair and was to be helmed by American filmmakers Jules Urbach and Matthew Gratzner, who created the trailer for the film&#x27;s public reveal. In 2012 Toei was teaming with &quot;The Walking Dead&quot; producer Valhalla Entertainment for the live-action adaptation of the show, but no further developments since then have been noted.

<text>Donald Arthur Scott (born August 5, 1948) is a former politician from Manitoba, Canada. He was the New Democratic Party of Manitoba (NDP) member of the Manitoba legislature from 1981 to 1988.

The son of Donald Alexander Scott and Mary Enid, he was raised in Liverpool, Nova Scotia, and attended a number of higher-learning institutions, including St. Francis Xavier University in Antigonish, Nova Scotia, Carleton University in Ottawa, Ontario, the University of Winnipeg and the University of Manitoba. He worked as a financial-government analyst, and at one stage worked for the Auditor General of Canada. Scott also held membership in a number of environmentally-oriented groups, including the &quot;Naturalists Society&quot; and the &quot;Solar Energy Society of Canada&quot;.

Scott was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the Manitoba general election of 1981, in the riding of Inkster. This particular riding was notable for having been held by Sidney Green, a prominent cabinet minister in the government of NDP Premier Edward Schreyer, since 1966. Green had left the NDP in 1979, and was seeking re-election as a member of the Progressive Party of Manitoba.

At first, the NDP wanted Roland Penner to challenge Green; Scott, a relative unknown, was drafted only after Penner declined. Nevertheless, he was elected in Inkster with a clear majority, receiving 6283 votes, as Green placed third with only 783. Following this election, the Progressive Party was no longer taken seriously as a political force.

Scott was re-elected without difficulty in the provincial election of 1986, defeating his nearest competitor by almost 4000 votes. In the 1988 election, however, he was upset by Liberal Kevin Lamoureux, who outpolled him by 4466 votes to 4098. The 1988 election was called after NDP backbencher Jim Walding voted against his own party&#x27;s budget, causing the government to fall two years before an election would normally have been called. Scott was one of several NDP members defeated in the following campaign; his loss in a seat previously regarded as safe for the party came as a particular surprise.

Scott later moved to Victoria, British Columbia. Following the Manitoba election of 2003, he wrote an op-ed piece for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, acknowledging the centrist approach of Gary Doer&#x27;s government while also encouraging it to invest more in social programs.

<doc id="1032603" wikidata="Q215857" url="?curid=1032603" title="Bookcase">
<text>A bookcase, or bookshelf, is a piece of furniture with horizontal shelves, often in a cabinet, used to store books or other printed materials. Bookcases are used in private homes, public and university libraries, offices, schools, and bookstores. Bookcases range from small, low models the height of a table to high models reaching up to ceiling height. Shelves may be fixed or adjustable to different positions in the case. In rooms entirely devoted to the storage of books, such as libraries, they may be permanently fixed to the walls and/or floor.

A bookcase may be fitted with glass doors that can be closed to protect the books from dust or moisture. Bookcase doors are almost always glazed with glass, so as to allow the spines of the books to be read. Especially valuable rare books may be kept in locked cases with wooden or glazed doors. A small bookshelf may also stand on some other piece of furniture, such as a desk or chest. Larger books are more likely to be kept in horizontal piles and very large books flat on wide shelves or on coffee tables.

In Latin and Greek, the idea of bookcase is represented by and (), derivatives of which mean &quot;library&quot; in many modern languages. A bookcase is also known as a &quot;bookshelf&quot;, &quot;bookstand&quot;, cupboard and &quot;bookrack&quot;. In a library, large bookshelves are called &quot;stacks.&quot;

== History ==

=== East Asia ===
Revolving bookcases, known as &quot;zhuanlunzang&quot; (), have been documented in imperial China, and its invention is credited to Fu Xi in 544. Descriptions of revolving bookcases have been found in 8th- and 9th-century Chinese texts. Revolving bookcases were popularized in Buddhist monasteries during the Song dynasty under the reign of Emperor Taizu, who ordered the mass printing of the Buddhist Tripiṭaka scriptures. An illustration of a revolving bookcase is depicted in Li Jie&#x27;s architectural treatise the &quot;Yingzao Fashi&quot;.

=== Europe ===
Private libraries appeared during the late Roman republic: Seneca inveighed against libraries fitted out for show by illiterate owners who scarcely read their titles in the course of a lifetime, but displayed the scrolls in bookcases (&quot;armaria&quot;) of citrus wood inlaid with ivory that ran right to the ceiling: &quot;by now, like bathrooms and hot water, a library is got up as standard equipment for a fine house&quot; (&quot;domus&quot;).

When books were written by hand and were not produced in great quantities, they were kept in small boxes or chests which owners (usually the wealthy aristocrats or clergy) carried with them. As manuscript volumes accumulated in religious houses or in homes of the wealthy, they were stored on shelves or in cupboards. These cupboards are the predecessors of today&#x27;s bookcases. Later the doors were removed, and the evolution of the bookcase proceeded. Even then, however, the volumes were not arranged in the modern fashion. They were either placed in piles upon their sides, or if upright, were ranged with their backs to the wall and their edges outwards. The band of leather, vellum or parchment which closed the book was often used for the inscription of the title, which was thus on the fore-edge instead of on the spine. Titles were also commonly written onto the fore-edge.

It was not until the invention of printing had greatly reduced the cost of books, thus allowing many more people access to owning books, that it became the practice to write the title on the spine and shelve books with the spine outwards. (This was possible because the books were now in the form of a codex rather than a scroll.) Early bookcases were usually of oak, which is still deemed by some to be the most appropriate wood for an elegant library. The oldest bookcases in England are those in the Bodleian Library at Oxford University, which were placed in position in the last year or two of the sixteenth century; in that library are the earliest extant examples of shelved galleries over the flat wall-cases. Long ranges of book-shelves are somewhat severe in appearance, and many attempts have been made by means of carved cornices and pilasters to give them a less austere appearance. These attempts were most successful as in the hands of the English cabinetmakers of the second half of the eighteenth century.

== Designers and manufacturers ==
Both Chippendale and Sheraton made or designed many bookcases, mostly glazed with little lozenges encased in fretwork frames, often of great charm and elegance. In the eyes of some, the grace of some of Sheraton&#x27;s satinwood bookcases has rarely been equalled. The French cabinetmakers of the same period were also highly successful with small ornamental cases. Mahogany, rosewood satinwood and even choicer exotic timbers were used; they were often inlaid with marquetry and mounted with chased and gilded bronze. Dwarf bookcases were frequently finished with a slab of choice marble at the top.

In 1876, John Danner of Canton, Ohio, invented a revolving bookcase with a patented &quot;pivot and post&quot; design. The ingenuity of his work resided in the economy of space it provided. Thirty-two volumes of the American Cyclopedia could be stored in a compact space, and readily available for perusal at the touch of a finger. Danner&#x27;s bookcase appeared in the 1894 Montgomery Ward catalog. In 1878 he exhibited his bookcases at the Paris International Exhibition and won a gold medal. The John Danner Manufacturing Company was known for honorable workmanship and affordability. The woods were oak, black walnut, western ash, and Philippine mahogany. Viewed as a progressive businessman, Danner was credited with drawing a large trade and business to the city of Canton.

== Library shelving ==
In the great public libraries of the twentieth century, multilevel stacks often served as both structure and shelving, of iron, as in the British Museum where the shelves are covered with cowhide; or steel, as in the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C.; or of slate, as in the Fitzwilliam Library at Cambridge.

=== Systems of arrangement ===
There are three common ways of arranging stationary bookcases: flat against the wall; in stacks or ranges parallel to each other with merely enough space between to allow for the passage of a librarian; or in bays or alcoves, where cases jut out into the room at right angles to the wall-cases. The stack system is suitable only for public libraries where economy of space is essential; the bay system is not only handsome but utilizes the space to great advantage. The library of the City of London at the Guildhall is a peculiarly effective example of the bay arrangement.

For libraries where space is extremely tight there is yet another system, usually called mobile aisle shelving. In such systems rows of bookcases are mounted on wheels and packed tightly together with only one or more aisles between them. It is possible then to visit only two bookcase sides at a time, all the others being pressed close together. A gearing mechanism allows users to move the bookcases and open the aisle in the desired location. Because of the danger of tripping on the floor-mounted rails or being crushed between bookcases, these systems may have electronic sensors and/or recessed track, or may be reserved for closed stacks where access is restricted.

== Barrister&#x27;s bookcase ==

A barrister requires the use of many law books and would formerly travel on circuit with a judge&#x27;s court. A specialised form of portable bookcase was developed to meet their needs. It consists of several separate shelf units that may be stacked together to form a cabinet. An additional plinth and hood complete the piece. When moving chambers, each shelf is carried separately without needing to remove its contents, and becomes a carrying-case full of books.

They were, and are, also marketed as &quot;extensible bookcases&quot;.

To help retain the books when being carried, a barrister&#x27;s bookcase has glazed doors. As the shelves must still separate, the usual hinged doors opening sideways cannot be used; instead there is an &quot;up and over&quot; mechanism on each shelf, like an overhead door. The better quality cases use a metal scissor mechanism inside the shelves to ensure that the ends of the doors move in parallel without skewing and jamming. Many of this style, exported worldwide, were made by the Skandia Furniture Co. of Rockford, Illinois around the beginning of the 20th century.

This style of bookcase was either made in the Dickensian period, or harkens back to the style of such times, so they are most commonly glazed with a leaded light and small panes of glass.

Each shelf of a true barrister&#x27;s bookcase must be portable with a heavy load of books. The more robust examples have folding handles at the ends of each shelf. Modern &quot;decorator&quot; copies of these may &quot;look&quot; the same, but are often too lightly constructed to be carried whilst loaded, or may even be simply a single fixed case like a normal bookcase, but with separate doors to each shelf to give the appearance of a barrister&#x27;s bookcase.

=== Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s book boxes ===
Similar to the Barrister&#x27;s bookcase is Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s book boxes. When the British burned down the capitol in 1814, Congress went into negotiations with Thomas Jefferson to purchase his personal library of about 6,700 books. The book collection would be the foundation of the Library of Congress, and it had its own specially designed shelves designed to help transport the books with ease from Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s home at Monticello.

The book boxes or (&quot;book presses&quot; as they are sometimes called) were made of pine with backs and shelves, but no fronts. They were designed to be three-tiered, stacked on top of each other. When fully assembled, the boxes stood about 9 feet high. Each shelf had a different depth, however, ranging from 13 inches to 5.75 inches deep. The shelves had about ¾ inch on the front where boards could be nailed on for transportation. Scrap paper was used to stuff between the books as a way of protecting them during their journey. When it was time to transport the books, the individual shelves could be removed then reassembled once they made it to their final location.

There is no documentation that Thomas Jefferson actually designed them himself, but the amount of detail that went into their construction suggests that they were his idea. There are no surviving original book boxes, but officials at Monticello were able to recreate six of these bookcases in 1959. This was achieved through experts compiling all written evidence of the book boxes as well as taking measurements of the remaining volumes from the Jefferson Library at the Library of Congress.

== Writing ==
;Practical
*The construction and arrangement of bookcases was learnedly discussed in the light of experience by W. E. Gladstone in the &quot;Nineteenth Century&quot; for March 1890, entitled &quot;On Books and the Housing of Them&quot;. An early type of mobile shelving made of steel is sometimes said to have been invented by Gladstone.
*&quot;The Book on the Bookshelf&quot; by Henry Petroski (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1999) also discusses the shelving of books in some detail.
*&quot;Living with Books&quot; by Alan Powers (London: Mitchell Beazley, 1999) deals with accommodating books at home.
*&quot;Lunacy &amp; the Arrangement of Books&quot; by Terry Belanger (New Castle, Del.: Oak Knoll Press, 2003) also deals with the subject.
*&quot;The Pictorial Catalogue; mural decoration in libraries: the Lyell Lectures, Oxford 1972-1973&quot; by André Masson (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1981) deals with the systems used in early modern European libraries.
*See also:
**Sympson the Joiner and the early glazed bookcases made for Samuel Pepys
**The Cottonian Library where each bookcase was named after a prominent figure in ancient Rome whose bust stood on the top.

;Literature and film
*In several stories, a secret area is hidden behind a bookcase built into the wall. The entrance is typically opened when a particular book on the shelf is pulled off or uses a switch in a statue, usually under the head. One particularly humorous example is found in the film &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot;, when Doctor Frankenstein&#x27;s laboratory is opened via a bookcase triggered by a candle.
*H. C. Bunner wrote a comic poem &quot;Shake, Mulleary and Go-ethe&quot; &quot;I have a bookcase which is what / Many much better men have not / There are no books inside, for books / I am afraid might spoil its looks, etc.&quot;
*In this passage from Lucy Maud Montgomery&#x27;s novel &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot;, the author refers to a bookcase; &quot;Thomas she had a bookcase in her sitting room with glass doors.&quot;
*Beatrix Potter referred to a bookcase in her children&#x27;s tales &quot;The Original Peter Rabbit Books&quot; in this passage; &quot;The bookcase and the bird-cage refused to go into the mouse-hole.&quot;

<text>In geometry, focuses or foci (; : focus) are special points with reference to which any of a variety of curves is constructed. For example, one or two foci can be used in defining conic sections, the four types of which are the circle, ellipse, parabola, and hyperbola. In addition, two foci are used to define the Cassini oval and the Cartesian oval, and more than two foci are used in defining an &quot;n&quot;-ellipse.

==Conic sections==
===Defining conics in terms of two foci===

An ellipse can be defined as the locus of points for which the sum of the distances to two given foci is constant.

A circle is the special case of an ellipse in which the two foci coincide with each other. Thus, a circle can be more simply defined as the locus of points each of which is a fixed distance from a single given focus. A circle can also be defined as the circle of Apollonius, in terms of two different foci, as the locus of points having a fixed ratio of distances to the two foci.

A parabola is a limiting case of an ellipse in which one of the foci is a point at infinity.

A hyperbola can be defined as the locus of points for which the absolute value of the difference between the distances to two given foci is constant.

===Defining conics in terms of a focus and a directrix===
It is also possible to describe all conic sections in terms of a single focus and a single directrix, which is a given line not containing the focus. A conic is defined as the locus of points for each of which the distance to the focus divided by the distance to the directrix is a fixed positive constant, called the eccentricity . If the conic is an ellipse, if the conic is a parabola, and if the conic is a hyperbola. If the distance to the focus is fixed and the directrix is a line at infinity, so the eccentricity is zero, then the conic is a circle.

===Defining conics in terms of a focus and a directrix circle===
It is also possible to describe all the conic sections as loci of points that are equidistant from a single focus and a single, circular directrix. For the ellipse, both the focus and the center of the directrix circle have finite coordinates and the radius of the directrix circle is greater than the distance between the center of this circle and the focus; thus, the focus is inside the directrix circle. The ellipse thus generated has its second focus at the center of the directrix circle, and the ellipse lies entirely within the circle.

For the parabola, the center of the directrix moves to the point at infinity (see Projective geometry). The directrix &quot;circle&quot; becomes a curve with zero curvature, indistinguishable from a straight line. The two arms of the parabola become increasingly parallel as they extend, and &quot;at infinity&quot; become parallel; using the principles of projective geometry, the two parallels intersect at the point at infinity and the parabola becomes a closed curve (elliptical projection).

To generate a hyperbola, the radius of the directrix circle is chosen to be less than the distance between the center of this circle and the focus; thus, the focus is outside the directrix circle. The arms of the hyperbola approach asymptotic lines and the &quot;right-hand&quot; arm of one branch of a hyperbola meets the &quot;left-hand&quot; arm of the other branch of a hyperbola at the point at infinity; this is based on the principle that, in projective geometry, a single line meets itself at a point at infinity. The two branches of a hyperbola are thus the two (twisted) halves of a curve closed over infinity.

In projective geometry, all conics are equivalent in the sense that every theorem that can be stated for one can be stated for the others.

===Astronomical significance===
In the gravitational two-body problem, the orbits of the two bodies about each other are described by two overlapping conic sections with one of the foci of one being coincident with one of the foci of the other at the center of mass (barycenter) of the two bodies.

Thus, for instance, the minor planet Pluto&#x27;s largest moon Charon has an elliptical orbit which has one focus at the Pluto-Charon system&#x27;s barycenter, which is a point that is in space between the two bodies; and Pluto also moves in an ellipse with one of its foci at that same barycenter between the bodies. Pluto&#x27;s ellipse is entirely inside Charon&#x27;s ellipse, as shown in this animation of the system.

By comparison, the Earth&#x27;s Moon moves in an ellipse with one of its foci at the barycenter of the Moon and the Earth, this barycenter being within the Earth itself, while the Earth (more precisely, its center) moves in an ellipse with one focus at that same barycenter within the Earth. The barycenter is about three-quarters of the distance from Earth&#x27;s center to its surface.

Moreover, the Pluto-Charon system moves in an ellipse around its barycenter with the Sun, as does the Earth-Moon system (and every other planet-moon system or moonless planet in the solar system). In both cases the barycenter is well within the body of the Sun.

Two binary stars also move in ellipses sharing a focus at their barycenter; for an animation, see here.

==Cartesian and Cassini ovals==
A Cartesian oval is the set of points for each of which the weighted sum of the distances to two given foci is constant. If the weights are equal, the special case of an ellipse results.

A Cassini oval is the set of points for each of which the product of the distances to two given foci is constant.

==Generalizations==
An &quot;n&quot;-ellipse is the set of points all having the same sum of distances to foci (the case being the conventional ellipse).

The concept of a focus can be generalized to arbitrary algebraic curves. Let be a curve of class and let and denote the circular points at infinity. Draw the tangents to through each of and . There are two sets of lines which will have points of intersection, with exceptions in some cases due to singularities, etc. These points of intersection are the defined to be the foci of . In other words, a point is a focus if both and are tangent to . When is a real curve, only the intersections of conjugate pairs are real, so there are in a real foci and imaginary foci. When is a conic, the real foci defined this way are exactly the foci which can be used in the geometric construction of .

==Confocal curves==
Let be given as foci of a curve of class . Let be the product of the tangential equations of these points and the product of the tangential equations of the circular points at infinity. Then all the lines which are common tangents to both and are tangent to . So, by the AF+BG theorem, the tangential equation of has the form . Since has class , must be a constant and but have degree less than or equal to . The case can be eliminated as degenerate, so the tangential equation of can be written as where is an arbitrary polynomial of degree .

For example, let , , and . The tangential equations are 
:formula_1
so . The tangential equations for the circular points at infinity are 
:formula_2
so . Therefore, the tangential equation for a conic with the given foci is 
:formula_3
or 
:formula_4 
where is an arbitrary constant. In point coordinates this becomes
:formula_5

<text>In geometrical optics, a focus, also called an image point, is a point where light rays originating from a point on the object converge. Although the focus is conceptually a point, physically the focus has a spatial extent, called the blur circle. This non-ideal focusing may be caused by aberrations of the imaging optics. Even in the absence of aberrations, the smallest possible blur circle is the Airy disc caused by diffraction from the optical system&#x27;s aperture; diffraction is the ultimate limit to the light focusing ability of any optical system. Aberrations tend to worsen as the aperture diameter increases, while the Airy circle is smallest for large apertures.

An image, or image point or region, is in focus if light from object points is converged almost as much as possible in the image, and out of focus if light is not well converged. The border between these is sometimes defined using a &quot;circle of confusion&quot; criterion.

A principal focus or focal point is a special focus:
* For a lens, or a spherical or parabolic mirror, it is a point onto which collimated light parallel to the axis is focused. Since light can pass through a lens in either direction, a lens has two focal points – one on each side. The distance in air from the lens or mirror&#x27;s principal plane to the focus is called the &quot;focal length&quot;.
* Elliptical mirrors have two focal points: light that passes through one of these before striking the mirror is reflected such that it passes through the other.
* The focus of a hyperbolic mirror is either of two points which have the property that light from one is reflected as if it came from the other.

Diverging (negative) lenses and convex mirrors do not focus a collimated beam to a point. Instead, the focus is the point from which the light appears to be emanating, after it travels through the lens or reflects from the mirror. A convex parabolic mirror will reflect a beam of collimated light to make it appear as if it were radiating from the focal point, or conversely, reflect rays directed toward the focus as a collimated beam. A convex elliptical mirror will reflect light directed towards one focus as if it were radiating from the other focus, both of which are behind the mirror. A convex hyperbolic mirror will reflect rays emanating from the focal point in front of the mirror as if they were emanating from the focal point behind the mirror. Conversely, it can focus rays directed at the focal point that is behind the mirror towards the focal point that is in front of the mirror as in a Cassegrain telescope.

<text>Admaston/Bromley is an incorporated township in Renfrew County, Eastern Ontario, Canada. It was formed on January 1, 2000, when Admaston and Bromley Townships were amalgamated. It takes part of its name from Admaston, Staffordshire, a small English hamlet.

==Communities==

The township comprises the communities of Admaston, Balsam Hill, Belangers Corners, Bromley, Bulgers Corners, Connaught, Douglas, Ferguslea, Fremo Corners, Kellys Corner, Martins Corner, McDougall, Moores Lake, Mount St. Patrick, Northcote, Oakgrove, Osceola, Payne, Pine Valley, Renfrew Junction, Rosebank, Shamrock, and Wolftown.

===Admaston===
The community, as well as the township, were named for the little village of Admaston, Staffordshire, the native home of Sir Charles Bagot, second Governor General of the Province of Canada .

===Bromley===
The community, as well as the township, took its name from Bagot&#x27;s Bromley in Staffordshire, England, home of the Bagot family.

===Douglas===
When the post office was established in 1854, Scottish settlers chose the name Douglas after a town in Lanarkshire, Scotland.
The town of Douglas is the third of five chutes along the Bonnechere River. The others being Castleford, Renfrew, Fourth Chute and Eganville. The chutes were used for moving timber past rapids and waterfalls; Douglas had a 21-foot (3.4 m) waterfall over which log drivers had to shepherd their timber.

===Mount St. Patrick===
The community was most likely first settled in the 1830&#x27;s by squatters on the land, as there was no land registry until the 1850&#x27;s. The settlers, almost solely Irish Catholics, named the village after Croagh Patrick, in County Mayo, Ireland.

==Demographics==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Admaston/Bromley had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

<text>Theodor Schwann (; 7 December 181011 January 1882) was a German physician and physiologist. His most significant contribution to biology is considered to be the extension of cell theory to animals. Other contributions include the discovery of Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system, the discovery and study of pepsin, the discovery of the organic nature of yeast, and the invention of the term &quot;metabolism&quot;.

== Early life and education ==
Theodor Schwann was born in Neuss on 7 December 1810 to Leonard Schwann and Elisabeth Rottels. Leonard Schwann was a goldsmith and later a printer. Theodor Schwann studied at the Dreikönigsgymnasium (also known as the Tricoronatum or Three Kings School), a Jesuit school in Cologne. Schwann was a devout Roman Catholic. In Cologne his religious instructor , a priest and novelist, emphasized the individuality of the human soul and the importance of free will.

In 1829, Schwann enrolled at the University of Bonn in the premedical curriculum. He received a bachelor of philosophy in 1831. While at Bonn, Schwann met and worked with physiologist Johannes Peter Müller. Müller is considered to have founded scientific medicine in Germany, publishing his &quot;Handbuch der Physiologie des Menschen für Vorlesungen&quot; in 1837–1840. It was translated into English as &quot;Elements of Physiology&quot; in 1837–1843 and became the leading physiology textbook of the 1800s.

In 1831, Schwann moved to the University of Würzburg for clinical training in medicine. In 1833, he went to the University of Berlin, where Müller was now Professor of Anatomy and Physiology. Schwann graduated with an M.D. degree in medicine from the University of Berlin in 1834. He did his thesis work in 1833–1834, with Müller as his advisor. Schwann&#x27;s thesis involved a careful study of the necessity for oxygen during the embryonic development of the chicken. To carry it out, he designed and built an apparatus that enabled him to pump the gases oxygen and hydrogen out of the incubation chamber at specific times. This enabled him to establish the critical period in which the eggs needed oxygen.

Schwann passed the state examination to practice medicine in the summer of 1834, but he chose to continue to work with Müller, doing research rather than practicing medicine. He could afford to do so, at least in the short term, because of a family inheritance. His salary as an assistant was only 120 taler. For the next five years, Schwann would pay the other three-quarters of his expenses out of his inheritance. As a long-term strategy, it was not sustainable.

== Career ==
From 1834 to 1839, Schwann worked as an assistant to Müller in at the Anatomisch-zootomische Museum at the University of Berlin. Schwann carried out a series of microscopic and physiological experiments focused on studying the structure and function of nerves, muscles and blood vessels. In addition to performing experiments in preparation for Müller&#x27;s book on physiology, Schwann did research of his own. Many of his important contributions were made during the time that he worked with Müller in Berlin.

Schwann used newly powerful microscopes to examine animal tissues. This enabled him to observe animal cells and note their different properties. His work complemented that of Matthias Jakob Schleiden in plants and was informed by it; the two were close friends.

Described as quiet and serious, Schwann was particularly gifted in the construction and use of apparatus for his experiments. He was also able to identify important scientific questions and design experiments to systematically test them. His writing has been described as accessible, and his logic as a &quot;clear progression&quot;. He identified the question that he wanted to answer and communicated the importance of his findings effectively to others. His co-worker Jakob Henle spoke of him as having an &quot;inborn drive&quot; to experiment.

By 1838, Schwann needed a position with a more substantial salary. He hoped to return to Bonn, a Catholic city. He attempted to gain a professorship there in 1838 and again in 1846, but was disappointed. Instead, in 1839, Schwann accepted the chair of anatomy at the Université Catholique de Louvain in Leuven, Belgium, another Catholic city.

Schwann proved to be a dedicated and conscientious professor. With his new teaching duties, he had less time for new scientific work. He spent considerable time perfecting experimental techniques and instruments for use in experiments. He produced few papers. One exception was a paper in 1844 that reported on a series of experiments on dogs and established the importance of bile in digestion.

In examining processes such as muscle contraction, fermentation, digestion, and putrefaction, Schwann sought to show that living phenomena were the result of physical causes rather than &quot;some immaterial vital force&quot;. Nonetheless, he still sought to reconcile &quot;an organic nature&quot; with &quot;a divine plan.&quot; Some writers have suggested that Schwann&#x27;s move in 1838, and his decreased scientific productivity after that, reflect religious concerns and perhaps even a crisis relating to the theoretical implications of his work on cell theory. However, other authors regard this as misrepresenting his thinking, and reject the idea that Schwann went through an existential crisis or a mystical phase. Ohad Parnes uses Schwann&#x27;s laboratory notebooks and other unpublished sources along with his publications to reconstruct his research as a unified progression. Florence Vienne draws on unpublished writings to discuss the ways in which cell theory, as a &quot;unifying principle of organic development&quot;, related to the philosophical, religious, and political ideas of various proponents including Schwann.

In 1848, Schwann&#x27;s compatriot Antoine Frédéric Spring convinced him to transfer to the University of Liège, also in Belgium. At Liège, Schwann continued to follow the latest advances in anatomy and physiology but did not himself make major new discoveries. He became something of an inventor. One of his projects was a portable respirator, designed as a closed system to support human life in environments where the surroundings cannot be breathed. By 1858 he was serving as professor of physiology, general anatomy and embryology. In 1863, the American Philosophical Society elected him an international member. As of 1872, he ceased to teach general anatomy, and as of 1877, embryology. He retired fully in 1879.

Schwann was deeply respected by his peers. In 1878, a festival was held to celebrate his years of teaching and his many contributions. He was presented with a unique gift: a book containing 263 autographed photographic portraits of scientists from various countries, each of them sent by the scientist to be part of the gift for Schwann. The volume was dedicated &quot;To the creator of the cell theory, the contemporary biologists.&quot;

Three years after retiring, Schwann died in Cologne, on 11 January 1882. He was buried in the family tomb in Cologne&#x27;s Melaten Cemetery.

== Contributions ==
When viewed in the context of his unpublished writings and laboratory notes, Schwann&#x27;s research can be seen as &quot;a coherent and systematic research programme&quot; in which biological processes are described in terms of material objects or &quot;agents&quot;, and the causal dependencies between the forces that they exert, and their measurable effects. Schwann&#x27;s idea of the cell as a fundamental, active unit then can be seen as foundational to the development of microbiology as &quot;a rigorously lawful science&quot;.

=== Muscle tissue ===
Some of Schwann&#x27;s earliest work in 1835 involved muscle contraction, which he saw as a starting point for &quot;the introduction of calculation to physiology&quot;. He developed and described an experimental method to calculate the contraction force of the muscle, by controlling and measuring the other variables involved. His measurement technique was developed and used later by Emil du Bois-Reymond and others. Schwann&#x27;s notes suggest that he hoped to discover regularities and laws of physiological processes.

=== Pepsin ===
In 1835, relatively little was known about digestive processes. William Prout had reported in 1824 that the digestive juices of animals contained hydrochloric acid. Schwann realized that other substances in digestive juices might also help to break down food. 
At the beginning of 1836, Schwann began to study digestive processes. He conceptualized digestion as the action of a physiological agent, which, though not immediately visible or measurable, could be characterized experimentally as a &quot;peculiar specific substance&quot;.

Eventually Schwann found the enzyme pepsin, which he successfully isolated from the stomach lining and named in 1836. Schwann coined its name from the Greek word &quot;pepsis&quot;, meaning &quot;digestion&quot; (from &quot;peptein&quot; &quot;to digest&quot;).
Pepsin was the first enzyme to be isolated from animal tissue.
He demonstrated that it could break down the albumin from egg-white into peptones.

Even more importantly, Schwann wrote, by carrying through such analyses one could eventually &quot;explain the whole developmental process of life in all organized bodies.&quot; During the next year, he studied both decomposition and respiration, constructing apparatus that he would later adapt for the study of yeast.

=== Yeast, fermentation, and spontaneous generation ===
Next Schwann studied yeast and fermentation. His work on yeast was independent of work done by Charles Cagniard de la Tour and Friedrich Traugott Kützing, all of whom published work in 1837.
By 1836, Schwann had carried out numerous experiments on alcohol fermentation. Powerful microscopes made it possible for him to observe yeast cells in detail and recognize that they were tiny organisms whose structures resembled those of plants.

Schwann went beyond others who simply had noted the multiplication of yeast during alcoholic fermentation, first by assigning yeast the role of a primary causal factor, and then by claiming it was alive. Schwann used the microscope to carry out a carefully planned series of experiments that contraindicated two popular theories of fermentation in yeast. First he controlled the temperature of fluid from fermenting beer in a closed vessel in the presence of oxygen. Once heated, the liquid could no longer ferment. This disproved Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac&#x27;s speculation that oxygen caused fermentation. It suggested that some sort of microorganism was necessary for the process to happen. Next, Schwann tested the effects of purified air and unpurified air. He sterilized the air by passing it through heated glass bulbs. Fermentation did not occur in the presence of purified air. It did occur in the presence of unpurified air, suggesting that something in the air started the process. This was strong evidence against the theory of spontaneous generation, the idea that living organisms could develop out of nonliving matter.

Schwann had demonstrated that fermentation required the presence of yeasts to start, and stopped when the yeasts stopped growing. He concluded that sugar was converted to alcohol as part of an organic biological process based on the action of a living substance, the yeast. He demonstrated that fermentation was not an inorganic chemical process like sugar oxidation. Living yeast was necessary for the reaction that would produce more yeast.

Although Schwann was correct, his ideas were ahead of most of his peers. They were strongly opposed by Justus von Liebig and Friedrich Wöhler, both of whom saw his emphasis on the importance of a living organism as supporting vitalism. Liebig, in contrast, saw fermentation as a series of purely chemical events, without involving living matter. Ironically, Schwann&#x27;s work was later seen as being a first step away from vitalism. Schwann was the first of Müller&#x27;s pupils to work towards a physico-chemical explanation of life. Schwann&#x27;s view furthered a conceptualization of living things in terms of the biological reactions of organic chemistry, while Liebig sought to reduce biological reactions to purely inorganic chemistry.

The value of Schwann&#x27;s work on fermentation eventually would be recognized by Louis Pasteur, ten years later. Pasteur would begin his fermentation research in 1857 by repeating and confirming Schwann&#x27;s work, accepting that yeast were alive, and then taking fermentation research further. Pasteur, not Schwann, would challenge Liebig&#x27;s views in the Liebig–Pasteur dispute. In retrospect, the germ theory of Pasteur, as well as its antiseptic applications by Lister, can be traced to Schwann&#x27;s influence.

=== Cell theory ===
In 1837, Matthias Jakob Schleiden viewed and stated that new plant cells formed from the nuclei of old plant cells. Dining with Schwann one day, their conversation turned on the nuclei of plant and animal cells. Schwann remembered seeing similar structures in the cells of the notochord (as had been shown by Müller) and instantly realized the importance of connecting the two phenomena. The resemblance was confirmed without delay by both observers. In further experiments, Schwann examined notochordal tissue and cartilage from toad larvae, as well as tissues from pig embryos, establishing that animal tissues are composed of cells, each of which has a nucleus.

Schwann published his observations in 1838 in the &quot;Neue notisen geb. nat.-heilk&quot;. This was followed in 1839 by the publication of his book &quot;Mikroskopische Untersuchungen über die Uebereinstimmung in der Struktur und dem Wachsthum der Thiere und Pflanzen&quot; (Microscopic investigations on the similarity of structure and growth of animals and plants). It is considered a landmark work, foundational to modern biology.

In it Schwann declared that &quot;All living things are composed of cells and cell products&quot;. 
He drew three further conclusions about cells, which formed his cell theory or cell doctrine. The first two were correct:
# The cell is the unit of structure, physiology, and organization in living things.
# The cell retains a dual existence as a distinct entity and a building block in the construction of organisms.
By the 1860s, these tenets were the accepted basis of cell theory, used to describe the elementary anatomical composition of plants and animals.

Schwann&#x27;s theory and observations created a foundation for modern histology. Schwann claimed that &quot;there is one universal principle of development for the elementary parts of organisms, however different, and this principle is the formation of cells.&quot; Schwann supported this claim by examining adult animal tissues and showing that all tissues could be classified in terms of five types of highly differentiated cellular tissues.

# cells that are independent and separate, e.g. blood cells
# cells that are independent but compacted together in layers, e.g. skin, fingernails, feathers
# cells whose connecting walls have coalesced, e.g. cartilage, bones, and tooth enamel
# elongated cells forming fibers, e.g. tendons and ligaments
# cells formed by the fusion of walls and cavities, e.g. muscles, tendons and nerves

His observation that the single-celled ovum eventually becomes a complete organism, established one of the basic principles of embryology.

Schwann&#x27;s third tenet, speculating on the formation of cells, was later disproven. Schwann hypothesized that living cells formed in ways similar to the formation of crystals. Biologists would eventually accept the view of pathologist Rudolf Virchow, who popularized the maxim &quot;Omnis cellula e cellula&quot;—that every cell arises from another cell—in 1857. The epigram was originally put forth by François-Vincent Raspail in 1825, but Raspail&#x27;s writings were unpopular, partly due to his republican sentiments. There is no evidence to suggest that Schwann and Raspail were aware of each other&#x27;s work.

=== Specialized cells ===
Schwann was particularly interested in nervous and muscular tissues. As part of his efforts to classify bodily tissues in terms of their cellular nature, he discovered the cells that envelope the nerve fibers, which are now called Schwann cells in his honor. How the fatty myelin sheaths of peripheral nerves were formed was a matter of debate that could not be answered until the electron microscope was invented. All axons in the peripheral nervous system are now known to be wrapped in Schwann cells. Their mechanisms continue to be studied.

Schwann also discovered that muscle tissue in the upper esophagus was striated. He speculated that the muscular nature of the esophagus enabled it to act as a pipe, moving food between the mouth and the stomach.

In examining teeth, Schwann was the first to notice &quot;cylindrical cells&quot; connected to both the inner surface of the enamel and the pulp. He also identified fibrils in the dentinal tubes, which later became known as &quot;Tomes&#x27;s fibers&quot;. He speculated on the possible structural and functional significance of the tubes and fibrils.

=== Metabolism ===
In his &quot;Microscopical researches&quot;, Schwann introduced the term &quot;metabolism&quot;, which he first used in the German adjectival form &quot;metabolische&quot; to describe the chemical action of cells. French texts in the 1860s began to use &quot;le métabolisme&quot;. &quot;Metabolism&quot; was introduced into English by Michael Foster in his &quot;Textbook of Physiology&quot; in 1878.

<doc id="1032620" wikidata="Q1426248" url="?curid=1032620" title="Honey, I Shrunk the Kids">
<text>Honey, I Shrunk the Kids is a 1989 American science fiction comedy film. It is the first installment of a film franchise and served as the directorial debut of Joe Johnston. The film stars Rick Moranis, Matt Frewer, Marcia Strassman, and Kristine Sutherland. In the film, a struggling inventor accidentally shrinks his and his neighbors&#x27; children to a height of a quarter of an inch. After being accidentally thrown out with the trash, the children must work together and venture their way back through a backyard wilderness filled with dangerous insects and man-made hazards.

&quot;Honey, I Shrunk the Kids&quot; was released theatrically in the United States on June 23, 1989, and distributed by Buena Vista Pictures Distribution. It was an unexpected box office success, grossing $222 million worldwide (equivalent to $ million in ) becoming the highest-grossing live-action Disney film of all time, a record it held for five years, and the seventh-highest grossing film of 1989 worldwide. Its success led to two sequels, beginning with &quot;Honey, I Blew Up the Kid&quot; in 1992, as well as a television series and several theme-park attractions. An animated short film, &quot;Tummy Trouble&quot; starring Roger Rabbit, was shown in theatres with the film during its box office run.

==Plot==

Scientist and inventor Wayne Szalinski has been designing an energy-projecting machine capable of shrinking and growing objects, but cannot get it to work properly. His obsession with the machine worries his hardworking wife Diane, teenage daughter Amy, and aspiring inventor son Nick. Next door, Big Russ Thompson, his wife Mae, and their younger son Ron are preparing for a fishing trip. Their elder son, Little Russ, is less than enthusiastic, as his interests often clash with his father&#x27;s.

Shortly after Wayne leaves for a conference, Ron accidentally hits a baseball through the Szalinskis&#x27; attic window and into the machine, turning it on and blocking its targeting laser. Caught by his brother, Ron is forced to confess to Amy and Nick. Ron and Nick enter the attic to retrieve the ball, and the activated machine shrinks them. Amy and Little Russ later suffer the same fate when they go searching for their siblings.

At his conference, Wayne is laughed off the stage for failing to provide proof that his machine works. He enters the attic upon returning home; the shrunken children try to get his attention, but their voices are only loud enough to be heard by the family dog, Quark. Already frustrated, Wayne discovers the broken window and snaps, repeatedly striking the machine. He sweeps the debris, along with the kids, into a dust pan and trash bag. The four manage to escape, only to discover that the trash bag is now at the curb; they make their way back home through the Szalinskis&#x27; overgrown yard. While trying to get back they have a harrowing encounter with a bee, which separates them.

Meanwhile, the Thompson and Szalinski parents become uneasy at their children&#x27;s absence. Mae and Big Russ cancel their fishing trip and file a missing persons report with the police. Wayne eventually pieces together what happened, but accidentally activates some sprinklers while inspecting the yard. As a result, Amy nearly drowns in a mud puddle, but Little Russ dives in to pull her out and revive her with rescue breaths. Wayne eventually reveals the truth to Diane, and she joins in the search. Later, she convinces Wayne to share the information with the Thompsons, but they remain skeptical.

The kids feast on one of Nick&#x27;s discarded Oatmeal Creme Pie cookies, and use a crumb to capture a friendly forager ant, naming it &quot;Antie&quot; and riding it toward the house. As night falls, the group takes shelter in a Lego piece. Amy and Little Russ begin to express feelings for one another, and share a kiss. The kids are later attacked by a scorpion, but Antie dies attempting to rescue them from it.

The next morning, Nick&#x27;s friend Tommy arrives to mow the lawn. The kids are forced to seek shelter in an earthworm tunnel, barely escaping the vortex caused by the mower, which Wayne and Diane shut off just in time. The kids hitch a ride on Quark, and enter the house, but Nick falls into a bowl of Cheerios and is nearly eaten by his own father. Quark bites Wayne&#x27;s ankle to get his attention; Wayne discovers the kids&#x27; presence, and works to repair the machine.

Both families meet in the attic, and the kids use charades to inform Wayne that the baseball blocked the laser, which previously overheated targets and caused them to explode. Wayne corrects the problem, and Big Russ volunteers as a test subject; the test is successful, and he and the kids are later restored to their original sizes.

Months later at Thanksgiving, the Szalinskis and Thompsons have become good friends and are toasting over an enlarged turkey, while Quark feasts on a giant dog biscuit.

==Cast==
==Production==
The project was originally brought to Disney Studios by Stuart Gordon and Brian Yuzna. Gordon was hired to direct the film and Yuzna to produce. The film was written as &quot;Teeny Weenies&quot; by Gordon, Ed Naha, and Yuzna. Tom Schulman was later added as a screenwriter. Gordon originally prepped the film but had to drop out as director shortly before filming began due to illness. Joe Johnston was brought in to replace him while Penny Finkleman Cox replaced Yuzna as producer.

As the title &quot;Teeny Weenies&quot; seemed to appeal more to a child demographic, the name was changed to &quot;Grounded&quot; to appeal to a more mature audience. That name was later rejected in favor of &quot;The Big Backyard&quot;. &quot;Honey, I Shrunk the Kids&quot;, based on a line of dialogue from the film, ultimately became its title. (The title was later criticized for its grammar, as the past tense of &quot;shrink&quot; is normally &quot;shrank&quot;.)

The film was heavily influenced by 1950s fare, such as &quot;The Incredible Shrinking Man&quot;.

=== Casting ===
Judy Taylor, Mike Fenton, and Lynda Gordon were the casting directors. Before Rick Moranis was cast as Wayne Szalinski, the script was written with Chevy Chase in mind because of his popularity in &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Vacation&quot;. He was filming the second sequel, &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Christmas Vacation&quot;, and was too busy to portray Wayne.

John Candy was also considered for the role of Wayne. He declined, but suggested to Johnston that his friend (and costar of &quot;SCTV&quot;, &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot; and &quot;Spaceballs&quot;), Rick Moranis, would be a good choice. Marcia Strassman portrays Wayne&#x27;s wife, Diane, who is having marital troubles with him.

The film needed four teenagers to play the leads. Russ Jr., portrayed by Thomas Wilson Brown, seems to be interested in Amy, and less in football, while Ron, Jared Rushton, appears to be more straightforward and a bully toward Nick, although he warms towards him. Rushton has quoted that he took the role after thinking that the script was &quot;appealing&quot; and he thought his character had progressed throughout the film with his personality.

Amy O&#x27;Neill and Robert Oliveri were cast as Amy and Nick Szalinski, Wayne and Diane&#x27;s kids. Oliveri commented that he was in awe about watching his stunt double do his stunts. He later starred as Kevin Boggs in Tim Burton&#x27;s &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot;. O&#x27;Neill thought the film was a fun experience and that doing off-set activities, such as swimming or playing cards, was fun to do with the other younger cast members. She accepted the role because it was a &quot;Disney movie&quot;.

===Direction===
Johnston was selected to direct the film for his directorial debut, having been mostly working on films as an effects illustrator and art director. It was filmed at the backlot of Churubusco Studios in Mexico City. Gregg Fonseca was the production designer and was in charge of managing several different sets for the scenes in it.

Some filming took place in the streets of Mexico City. In the scene where Diane walks out of the mall to the pay phone, a sign says &quot;Beverly Hills Mall&quot;, but is in fact Plaza Inn, a mall in Mexico City.

Special effects were heavily used for the film, such as the electronically controlled ants and bees. For the most part, the production team tried to use practical effects that would work in camera. For the scene where Wayne lands in the Thompsons&#x27; pool, Moranis jumped off a flying board in the form of a teeter-totter on a swing set. A stuntman pushed the board, sending him flying through the air and landing on a mat. Other visual effects utilized on stop-motion animation, puppetry, trick camera shots and different lenses. Numerous storyboards were used for the film, particularly in the sprinkler and bee scenes. Scale models were also used for the bee scene, with miniature Russ Jr. and Nick plastic figures attached. Forced perspective was used in the giant cookie scene, to make it seem bigger. The child actors were strapped in for the scene with the broom. The bristles were actually pieces of foam that were carved and tied to a rig system.

== Reception ==
===Box office===
The film opened on June 23, 1989, in 1,371 theatres. It opened at number 2 in the United States behind &quot;Batman&quot;, with a weekend gross of $14,262,961, Buena Vista&#x27;s biggest 3-day weekend of all time. It earned $130,724,172 domestic and $92,000,000 in other territories, earning a grand total of $222,724,172. Attached to it was Disney and Amblin Entertainment&#x27;s first Roger Rabbit short, &quot;Tummy Trouble&quot;, executively produced by Steven Spielberg, produced by Don Hahn, directed by Rob Minkoff, and also composed by James Horner.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes &quot;Honey, I Shrunk the Kids&quot; has an approval rating of 76% based on reviews from 37 critics, with an average rating of 6.30/10. The consensus reads, &quot;Even as its special effects take center stage, &quot;Honey, I Shrunk the Kids&quot; still offers a charming, high-spirited sense of adventure for the whole family.&quot; Metacritic gave the film a score of 63 based on 11 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Caryn James, of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, gave a positive review, saying: &quot;As sweet, funny, and straightforward as its title.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; gave another positive review stating, &quot;[It&#x27;s] in the best tradition of Disney – and even better than that, because it is not so juvenile that adults won&#x27;t be thoroughly entertained.&quot; A rare negative review came from Roger Ebert, of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, who stated: &quot;The special effects are all there, nicely in place, and the production values are sound, but the movie is dead in the water.&quot;

The film was also mentioned in the British sitcom &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; in the episode titled &quot;Rodney Come Home&quot;.

===Awards===
James Horner won an ASCAP Award for Top Box Office Films and was also nominated for a Saturn Award. The film was also nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film. Thomas Wilson Brown, Jared Rushton, Robert Oliveri and the Special Effects Crew were also nominated for a Saturn Award. The Special Effects Crew won a BAFTA Award for Best Special Visual Effects. Amy O&#x27;Neill and Jared Rushton were each nominated for a Young Artist Award and director Joe Johnston was nominated for a Fantasporto Award.

The film was presented in the &quot;100 Greatest Family Films&quot;, in which Amy O&#x27;Neill and Thomas Wilson Brown talked about it for MTV.

==Soundtrack==
After going years unreleased, James Horner&#x27;s soundtrack to the film was made available by Intrada Records on March 6, 2009. The song that Amy dances to in the kitchen is &quot;Turn It Up&quot; by Nick Kamen, written by Jeffrey Pescetto and Patrick DeRemer.

The soundtrack was limited to a 3,000-copy release. Horner&#x27;s main title music incorporates cues from the score by Nino Rota from Federico Fellini&#x27;s film &quot;Amarcord&quot; (1973) and Raymond Scott&#x27;s piece &quot;Powerhouse B&quot; (1937), the latter often referenced in Carl Stalling&#x27;s Warner Bros. cartoon scores. Scott&#x27;s piece was used without payment or credit, leading his estate to threaten legal action against Disney. Disney paid an undisclosed sum in an out-of-court settlement and changed the film&#x27;s cue sheets to credit Scott. Horner&#x27;s main title music underscores all the major moments involving Szalinski&#x27;s technology.

With 15 tracks, Horner produced the record with longtime engineer Simon Rhodes while it was originally performed by the London Symphony Orchestra.

==Disney Parks incorporation==
===Studio Backlot Tour===
Following the film&#x27;s success, one of its special effects was recreated by park guests on the Walking Tour portion of the Studio Backlot Tour at Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios (then-known as Disney-MGM Studios) throughout the 1990s.

Two children from the tour would volunteer to be strapped to the side of a giant prop bee in front of a green screen and be videotaped acting distressed by the simulated flight of the bee. Using a robotic camera and chroma key technology, footage from &quot;Honey, I Shrunk the Kids&quot; would be incorporated into the finished video and displayed immediately afterward on television screens mounted throughout the room. The video then transitioned into a scripted segment recorded by film critics Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert (on the set of their syndicated television series &quot;Siskel &amp; Ebert&quot;) critiquing the special effects but giving &quot;Two thumbs up for the kids!&quot;

===Honey, I Shrunk the Kids: Movie Set Adventure===

From 1990 until 2016, a playground at Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios recreated the overgrown backyard set of the film for park guests to explore.

===Honey, I Shrunk the Audience===

A three-dimensional film called &quot;Honey, I Shrunk the Audience!&quot; complete with physical effects such as wind and water was created as an attraction at Walt Disney World&#x27;s Epcot in 1994, and later made its way to Disneyland, Tokyo Disneyland, and Disneyland Paris with all four parks featuring the attraction by 1999. The film was a replacement for the Michael Jackson film &quot;Captain EO&quot;, a musical film launched in 1986. The film was phased out of the Disney Parks in 2010.

==Sequels==
===&quot;Honey, I Blew Up the Kid&quot;===
In 1992, Disney released the first sequel, &quot;Honey, I Blew Up the Kid&quot;, with Moranis, Strassman, O&#x27;Neill, and Oliveri reprising their roles as Wayne, Diane, Amy and Nick Szalinski. As the title suggests, Wayne succeeds in enlarging his two-year-old son, Adam, to gigantic proportions as one of his size-changing experiments goes awry.

===&quot;Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves&quot;===
In 1997, Disney produced the second sequel, &quot;Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves&quot;, as a direct to video release. Rick Moranis was the only actor to reprise his role. The characters of Diane and Adam were recast, with Amy and Nick only being briefly mentioned in passing. Many new characters were added, including Wayne&#x27;s brother Gordon and his family. This time, the parents are shrunk and need to be rescued by their kids.

===TV series===
The last incarnation of the franchise was the television program &quot;Honey, I Shrunk the Kids: The TV Show&quot;. Peter Scolari took over as Wayne and Nick and Amy both returned as characters, roughly the same age as in the original film, and played by new actors. Its plots involved other wacky Szalinski inventions (rarely the shrinking machine) that do not work quite as expected and land the family in some type of humorous mixed-up adventure.

===Future===
On February 21, 2018, it was announced that live-action remakes of several films are in development as exclusive content for Disney+, with one of those named in the announcement as being &quot;Honey, I Shrunk the Kids&quot;. It was later confirmed that a &quot;legacy-sequel&quot; film titled &quot;Shrunk&quot; is in development to be released theatrically, with a plot that centers around Nick Szalinski as an adult scientist. Josh Gad will star as Nick in the film. On December 5, 2019, it was reported that Joe Johnston is in talks to return as director. On February 12, 2020, it was reported that Rick Moranis will come out of his long semi-retirement to reprise his role as Wayne Szalinski and that Johnston is now confirmed to direct. The plot will center around an adult Nick accidentally shrinking his two daughters and son to five inches tall and them coping with their new sizes while he gets his estranged father Wayne to help him fix his machine. Julia Butters has been rumored to play Nick&#x27;s daughter Sara. Robyn Adele Anderson has been reportedly cast as a babysitter named Teresa who also ends up getting shrunk.

In January 2020, Rick Moranis entered early negotiations to come out of his acting retirement, and reprise his role as Wayne Szalinski. Johnston was confirmed to direct, with Todd Rosenberg set to write the script, from an original story by Gad, Ryan Dixon, Ian Helfer, and Jay Reiss. By February, Moranis had officially signed onto the project to reprise his role. David Hoberman and Todd Lieberman will serve as producers. The film will be a joint-venture production between Walt Disney Pictures and Mandeville Films, with Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures as the distributing company. Principal photography was scheduled to begin in early 2020, with filming taking place in Toronto, as well as Atlanta, Georgia. In March of the same year, filming on all Disney projects were halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic and industry restrictions worldwide. In November, Disney CEO Bob Chapek announced that filming on all movies that had been postponed by the coronavirus had resumed. In June 2021, Gad stated that filming had not yet started and that he was hoping the shoot would begin in early 2022. In January 2022, Gad stated that he and Moranis had once again started collaborating in preparation for the sequel. In June 2023, Gad revealed on Twitter that the project has been put on hold indefinitely, although he expressed hope that production would resume in the near future.

<text>Aluminerie Alouette is an aluminum manufacturing company based in Sept-Îles, Quebec, Canada, on the North Shore of the Gulf of St. Lawrence.
==History==
In 2005, the Alouette Aluminum Smelter, at 550,000 metric tonnes capacity per year, became the largest primary aluminum smelter in the Americas.

The construction of an aluminum smelter at Sept-Îles was made possible with the completion of the Churchill Falls Hydro Electric project in Labrador in 1972. Electrical transmission lines from Churchill Falls, carrying power to the Hydro-Québec power grid, pass close to the city of Sept-Îles, with Hydro-Québec&#x27;s Arnaud substation built on the outskirts of the city.

In 1989, attracted by Hydro-Québec&#x27;s low power costs and the seaport facilities at Sept-Îles, Alouette built a 215,000 tonne per year smelter on Pointe-Noire, Quebec, located on the southern side of Sept-Îles Bay. The smelter was funded by an international consortium, consisting of Austria Metall AG (AMAG), Kobe Aluminum and Marubeni of Japan, Koninklijke Hoogovens of the Netherlands, Société générale de financement (SGF), and VAW of Germany.

In 2002, plans were approved to expand the smelter by more than double its original capacity. This phase 2 project was completed in September 2005. Since 2011, the Alouette Smelter uses 930 MW electricity at maximum production capacity.

Aluminerie Alouette is certified ISO 9001 (quality), ISO 17025 (laboratory quality and environmental analysis), ISO 14001 (environment) and OHSAS 18001 (health and safety).

<text>Hardy Murfree (June 5, 1752 – April 6, 1809) was a lieutenant colonel from North Carolina during the American Revolutionary War.

==Early life==
Murfree was born on June 5, 1752, at Murfree&#x27;s Landing, North Carolina, later renamed Murfreesboro. His parents were William Murfree and Mary Moore.

==Military career==
Murfree, a lieutenant in the Hertford County militia when the Revolutionary War began, was commissioned on September 1, 1775, as a captain in the 2nd North Carolina Regiment of the Continental Army. The regiment was commanded by Colonel Robert Howe, who was later a major general. Murfree saw action at the Battle of Monmouth on June 28, 1778, and achieved his greatest renown for leading a successful diversionary attack against British defenses in the Battle of Stony Point on July 15, 1779. He was then a major serving under General Anthony Wayne, and was soon thereafter promoted to lieutenant colonel.

On July 17, 1781, British forces led by Banastre Tarleton and the British Legion attacked Maney&#x27;s Neck on the Meherrin River near Murfree&#x27;s Landing. Murfree led the militia that repulsed the attack at Skinner&#x27;s Bridge.

Around 1807, Murfree migrated to Williamson County, Tennessee, living on land granted to him after the American Revolution, and remained there until his death in 1809.

Murfree was a member of the North Carolina chapter of the Society of the Cincinnati. He was a Freemason for all of his adult life, active in both North Carolina and Tennessee.

==Personal life==
Murfree married Sally Brickell on February 17, 1780. They had seven children: William Hardy Murfree (1781), Fanny Noailles Murfree (1783), Mary Moore Murfree (1786), Matthias Brickell Murfree (1788), Sally Murfree (1793), Lavinia Bembury Murfree (1795-1881), and Martha Long Ann Coakley Murfree (1801). Their great-granddaughter was the noted Tennessee writer Mary Noailles Murfree (1850–1922). His wife Sally died on March 29, 1802.

==Death and legacy==
Murfree died on April 6, 1809. In 1811 the Tennessee State Legislature renamed the town of Cannonsburgh to Murfreesborough (later shortened to Murfreesboro) in his honor.

<text>Religion in Africa is multifaceted and has been a major influence on art, culture and philosophy. Today, the continent&#x27;s various populations and individuals are mostly adherents of Christianity, Islam, and to a lesser extent several traditional African religions. In Christian or Islamic communities, religious beliefs are also sometimes characterized with syncretism with the beliefs and practices of traditional religions.

==Traditional African religions==


Africa encompasses a wide variety of traditional beliefs. Although religious customs are sometimes shared by many local societies, they are usually unique to specific populations or geographic regions. All traditional African religions are united by a shared animistic core with special importance to ancestor worship.

According to Dr J Omosade Awolalu, The &quot;olden&quot; in this context means indigenous, that which is foundational, handed down from generation to generation, meant as to be upheld and practised today and forevermore. A heritage from the past, yet not treated as a thing of the past but that which connects the past with the present and the present with eternity.

Though often referred to in singular terms, Africa is a vast continent with many nations, each possessing complex cultures, numerous languages, and various dialects.

===West African===
The essence of this school of thought is based mainly on oral transmission; that which is written in people&#x27;s hearts, minds, oral history, customs, temples and religious functions. It has no founders or leaders like Gautama Buddha, Jesus, or Muhammed. It has no missionaries or the intent to propagate or to proselytise. Some of the African traditional religions are those of the Serer of Senegal, the Yoruba of Nigeria, and the Akan of Ghana and the Ivory Coast, and the Bono of Ghana and Ivory Coast. The western coast is also consisted of the Yoruba and Anglican religion of syncretism. The religion of the Gbe peoples (mostly the Ewe and Fon) of Benin, Togo and Ghana is called Vodun and is the main source for similarly named religions in the diaspora, such as Louisiana Voodoo, Haitian Vodou, Cuban Vodú, Dominican Vudú and Brazilian Vodum.

Some distinctions between West African and East or Hornn religion often includes considering the supernatural and natural or tangible as being one and the same, and using this stance to incorporate divination. Clergymen from this region who would historically catechize to the masses was often referred to as &quot;waganga&quot;. Another distinction of East African and Horners is the greater prevalence of prophets within the oral traditionas and other forms of generational transmissions of traditional African religion.

The most prominent indigenous deity among Cushitic &quot;Horners&quot; is Waaq, which continues to be manifested into the modern era with religions such as Waaqeffanna and Waaqism. According to the author Lugira, the Traditional African religions are the only religions &quot;that can claim to have originated in Africa. Other religions found in Africa have their origins in other parts of the world.&quot;

==Abrahamic religions==
The majority of Africans are adherents of Christianity or Islam. African people often combine the practice of their traditional belief with the practice of Abrahamic religions. Abrahamic religions are widespread throughout Africa. They have both spread and replaced indigenous African religions, but are often adapted to African cultural contexts and belief systems. The World Book Encyclopedia has estimated that in 2002 Christians formed 45% of the continent&#x27;s population, with Muslims forming 40%. It was also estimated in 2002 that Christians form 45% of Africa&#x27;s population, with Muslims forming 40.6%.

===Christianity===
Christianity is the most widely practiced religions along with Islam and is the largest religion in Sub-Saharan Africa. Several syncretistic and messianic sects have formed throughout much of the continent, including the Nazareth Baptist Church in South Africa and the Aladura churches in Nigeria. There is also fairly widespread populations of Seventh-day Adventists and Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses. The oldest Christian denominations in Africa are the Eastern Orthodox Church of Alexandria, the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, and the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church and Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church (which rose to prominence in the fourth century AD after King Ezana the Great made Ethiopia one of the first Christian nations.)

In the first few centuries of Christianity, Africa produced many figures who had a major influence outside the continent, including St Augustine of Hippo, St Maurice, Origen, Tertullian, and three Roman Catholic popes (Victor I, Miltiades and Gelasius I), as well as the Biblical characters Simon of Cyrene and the Ethiopian eunuch baptised by Philip the Evangelist. Christianity existed in Ethiopia before the rule of King Ezana the Great of the Kingdom of Axum, but the religion grasped a strong foothold when it was declared a state religion in 330 AD, becoming one of the first Christian nations.

The earliest and best known reference to the introduction of Christianity to Africa is mentioned in the Christian Bible&#x27;s Acts of the Apostles, and pertains to the evangelist Phillip&#x27;s conversion of an Ethiopian traveller in the 1st century AD. Although the Bible refers to them as Ethiopians, scholars have argued that Ethiopia was a common term encompassing the area South-Southeast of Egypt.

Other traditions have the convert as a Jew who was a steward in the Queen&#x27;s court. All accounts do agree on the fact that the traveller was a member of the royal court who succeeded in converting the Queen, which in turn caused a church to be built. Tyrannius Rufinus, a noted church historian, also recorded a personal account as do other church historians such as Socrates and Sozemius.

Some experts predict the shift of Christianity&#x27;s center from the European industrialized nations to Africa and Asia in modern times. Yale University historian Lamin Sanneh stated, that &quot;African Christianity was not just an exotic, curious phenomenon in an obscure part of the world, but that African Christianity might be the shape of things to come.&quot; The statistics from the World Christian Encyclopedia (David Barrett) illustrate the emerging trend of dramatic Christian growth on the continent and supposes, that in 2025 there will be 633 million Christians in Africa.

A 2015 study estimates 2,161,000 Christian believers from a Muslim background in Africa, most of them belonging to some form of Protestantism.

===Islam===


Islam is the other major religion in Africa alongside Christianity, with over 40% of the population being Muslim, accounting for about one fourth of the world&#x27;s Muslim population. The faith&#x27;s historic roots on the continent stem from the time of Muhammad, whose early disciples migrated to Abyssinia (hijira) in fear of persecution from the pagan Arabs.

The spread of Islam in North Africa came with the expansion of Arab empire under Caliph Umar, through the Sinai Peninsula. The spread of Islam in West Africa was through Islamic traders and sailors. The religion had also began influencing Harla Kingdom in the Horn of Africa early on.

Islam is the dominant religion in North Africa and the Horn of Africa. It has also become the predominant religion on the Swahili Coast as well as the West African seaboard and parts of the interior. There have been several Muslim empires in Western Africa which exerted considerable influence, notably the Mali Empire, which flourished for several centuries and the Songhai Empire, under the leadership of Mansa Musa, Sunni Ali and Askia Mohammed.
The vast majority of Muslims in Africa are followers of Sunni Islam. There are also small minorities of other sects.

===Judaism===

Adherents of Judaism can be found scattered in a number of countries across Africa; including North Africa, Ethiopia, Uganda, Kenya, Cameroon, Gabon, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Mali, and Southern Africa.

===Baháʼí Faith===
The Baháʼí Faith in Africa has a diverse history. It especially had wide-scale growth in the 1950s which extended further in the 1960s. The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying on World Christian Encyclopedia) lists many large and smaller populations of Baháʼís in Africa with Kenya (#3: 512,900), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (#5: 282,900), South Africa (#8: 238,500) and Zambia (#10: 190,400) among the top ten numerical populations of Baháʼís in the world in 2010, and Mauritius (#4: 1.8% of population) joining Zambia (#3: 1.8%) and Kenya (#10: 1.0%) in the top ten in terms of percentage of the national population.

All three individual heads of the religion, Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh, `Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá, and Shoghi Effendi, were in Africa at various times. More recently the roughly 2000 Baháʼís of Egypt have been embroiled in the Egyptian identification card controversy from 2006 through 2009. Since then there have been homes burned down and families driven out of towns. On the other hand, Sub-Saharan Baháʼís were able to mobilize for nine regional conferences called for by the Universal House of Justice 20 October 2008 to celebrate recent achievements in grassroots community-building and to plan their next steps in organizing in their home areas.

==Hinduism==


Hinduism has existed in Africa mainly since the late 19th century. There are an estimated 2-2.5 million adherents of Hinduism in Africa. It is the largest religion in Mauritius, and several other countries have Hindu temples.
Hindus came to South Africa as indentured laborers in the 19th century. The young M.K. Gandhi lived and worked among the Indian community in South Africa for twenty years before returning to India to participate in India&#x27;s freedom movement.

==Buddhism and folk religions==
Buddhism is a tiny religion in Africa with around 250,000 practicing adherents, and up to nearly 400,000 if combined with Taoism and Chinese Folk Religion as a common traditional religion of mostly new Chinese migrants (significant minority in Mauritius, Réunion, and South Africa). About half of African Buddhists are now living in South Africa, while Mauritius has the highest Buddhist percentage in the continent, between 1.5% to 2% of the total population.

==Other religions==
Other faiths are practiced in Africa, including Sikhism, Jainism, Zoroastrianism and Rastafari among others.

==Irreligion==
A Gallup poll found that the irreligious comprise 20% in South Africa, 16% in Botswana, 13% in Mozambique, 13% in Togo, 12% in Ivory Coast, 10% in Ethiopia and Angola, 9% in Sudan, Zimbabwe and Algeria, 8% in Namibia and 7% in Madagascar.

==Syncretism==
Syncretism is the combining of different (often contradictory) beliefs, often while melding practices of various schools of thought. In the commonwealth of Africa syncretism with indigenous beliefs is practiced throughout the region. It is believed by some to explain religious tolerance between different groups. Kwesi Yankah and John Mbiti argue that many African peoples today have a &#x27;mixed&#x27; religious heritage to try to reconcile traditional religions with Abrahamic faiths.

Jesse Mugambi claims that the Christianity taught to Africans by missionaries had a fear of syncretism, which was carried on by current African Christian leadership in an attempt to keep Christianity &quot;pure.&quot; Syncretism in Africa is said by others to be overstated, and due to a misunderstanding of the abilities of local populations to form their own orthodoxies and also confusion over what is culture and what is religion. Others state that the term syncretism is a vague one, since it can be applied to refer to substitution or modification of the central elements of Christianity or Islam with beliefs or practices from somewhere else.

The consequences under this definition, according to missiologist Keith Ferdinando, are a fatal compromise of the religion&#x27;s integrity. However, communities in Africa (e.g. Afro-Asiatic) have many common practices which are also found in Abrahamic faiths, and thus these traditions do not fall under the category of some definitions of syncretism.

<doc id="1032628" wikidata="Q640517" url="?curid=1032628" title="Rock DJ">
<text>&quot;Rock DJ&quot; is a song by English singer and songwriter Robbie Williams, featured on his third studio album, &quot;Sing When You&#x27;re Winning&quot; (2000). The song was released on 31 July 2000 as the lead single from the album. It samples Barry White&#x27;s song &quot;It&#x27;s Ecstasy When You Lay Down Next to Me&quot;, &quot;Can I Kick It?&quot; by A Tribe Called Quest and has a quote from &quot;La Di Da Di&quot; by Slick Rick and Doug E. Fresh.

&quot;Rock DJ&quot; reached number one in Costa Rica, Iceland, Ireland, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom whilst reaching the top 10 in Australia, Austria, Germany, Italy, Norway, Spain, and Switzerland. It was the fourth-best-selling song of 2000 in the UK. In the U.S, it peaked at number 23 on the Billboard Dance Club Songs chart. The music video features Williams trying to impress a female DJ by stripping naked and eventually resorting to removing his skin and muscles, ending up as a skeleton. The song won British Single of the Year, and the video won British Video of the Year at the 2001 Brit Awards.

In his 2023 Netflix series, Williams jokingly stated that he was trying to write “Karma Police” and ended up writing “Karma Chameleon”.

==Chart performance==
The song became Robbie Williams&#x27; third number-one solo single in the United Kingdom, going on to sell over 1.2 million copies and being certified 2× platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). The song also became a hit around Europe, charting inside the top 10 in several countries and becoming his first number-one single in New Zealand. The song also became a top-five hit in Australia, where it went on to sell over 70,000 copies, being certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA). In the United States, the track reached number 24 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance Club Play chart. &quot;Rock DJ&quot; was named the Best Song of 2000 at the MTV Europe Music Awards and Best Single and Best Video at the Brit Awards 2001.

==Music videos==
The accompanying music video for &quot;Rock DJ&quot; was directed by Vaughan Arnell. It was released on 6 July 2000. It begins with Williams dancing on a roller disco with women skating around him. He wants to get the attention of the female DJ (played by Lauren Gold) standing above the stage, so he begins taking off his clothes. She ignores him at first, but after she finally notices he is completely naked, he proceeds with stripping off his skin, muscles and organs, until the only thing left of him are his bones, which is performed by special effects. In the end, the DJ dances with his skeleton. The video ends with the note, &quot;No Robbies were Harmed During the Making of this Video&quot;, a jocular take on the &quot;No animals were harmed&quot; note. The skinless Robbie also appears on the single&#x27;s cover art, as well as on the cover of the DVD release of &quot;In and Out of Consciousness: Greatest Hits 1990–2010&quot; in 2010.

The video&#x27;s ending (beginning with Williams taking off his skin) was cut by most music channels around Europe, including VIVA, MCM, The Box and VH1 Europe. However, in the recent years, some of the music channels in Europe (including MTV Classic and VH1 Europe) airs the &quot;studio recording&quot; version of the music video, even on late night, which made the edited version of the music video fall into obscurity. Examples of TV stations that still play the full video are Bulgarian channel MM, former German located channel B.TV (often in daytime) and Canadian channel MusiquePlus, some channels ran the edited video during the day and the unedited one overnight, while The Hits played a version which cut from Williams dancing in his underwear to dancing as a skeleton, filling the gap by repeating previous footage. This is the version that is currently played on channels owned by The Box Plus Network. In 2001, &quot;Rock DJ&quot; won the MTV Video Music Award for Best Special Effects. In 2006, it was voted by viewers as the seventh Most Groundbreaking Video Ever on MTV and in 2007 it was ranked at number 48 on MuchMusic&#x27;s 50 Most Controversial Videos. The video was banned in Dominican Republic due to allegations of Satanism.

The video has been shown numerous times on Fuse&#x27;s &quot;Pants-Off Dance-Off&quot;, despite its gory content. Toward the end of the dancer&#x27;s dancing/stripping to it when the video is shown in the background like any other, they only show Williams, briefly, ripping and throwing his skin, and dancing in muscle form before cutting to the hostess of the show. The video appears as an instance of the re-use of the motif of &quot;dancing with the dead&quot; in a book about medieval images of death and dying in art and literature.

A second video shows Williams in a studio while recording the song.

<doc id="1032631" wikidata="Q1088136" url="?curid=1032631" title="Mazinger">
<text>is a long-running series of manga and anime featuring giant robots or mecha created by Go Nagai in 1972. It introduced the concept of mecha as robots which are ridden by humans and controlled like vehicles to Japanese science fiction (previous depictions of human-controlled giant robots in Japan, such as in &quot;Tetsujin 28-go&quot;, depicted the robot as remote-controlled, rather than vehicle-like); it would thereby be a primary source of inspiration for the Super Robot sub-genre, particularly throughout the 1970s.

==Series==
The series in order:
&quot;God Mazinger&quot; is related by name only and &quot;Mazinkaiser&quot; is an OVA retelling of earlier &quot;Mazinger&quot; stories, based partly on designs created by Nagai for the &quot;Super Robot Wars&quot; series of video games and also on Nagai&#x27;s original &quot;Mazinger&quot; manga stories.

Mazinger-Z also featured in a video game for the Genesis/Mega Drive. It went by several names like &quot;MazinWars&quot; and &quot;MazinSaga&quot;.

==Anime series staff==
* NOTE: Not including parodies and crossovers series/films.

==Common elements==
Throughout the storylines, common characters and traits tie the series together.

===Body structure &amp; colouring scheme===
Except God Mazinger, the other mazingers share a very distinctive physiognomy, though the proportions and overall presence is modified in each one.

Mazinger Z usually looks shorter and wider compared to Great Mazinger, who has a more slender physique. This is mainly due to the &quot;helmets&quot;, which is how one can tell them apart. The helmet of Great Mazinger is pointed while the top of Mazinger Z&#x27;s is &quot;flat-topped&quot;. MazinKaiser looks more heavily built than either of them, and sports the typical over-detailed (more ornate) style of more modern mechas (consider there&#x27;s a 30-year gap between the first two and him). MazinKaiser is also the bigger/taller of the three.

The main colours are always black (torso, hips, shoulders, sometimes limbs), white (&quot;steel colored&quot;) (waist and limbs, with slight variations towards light shades of yellow and blue tones depending on the version), very dark blue or almost black, depending on the depiction (face, limbs) and red (chest plate and flying devices). The head is usually steel/grey, with a cavity for the ship that controls the mecha.

This cavity becomes increasingly complex in each incarnation. Mazingers have characteristic horns at each side of the head where the ears would go on a human head, always coloured yellow, the eyes are yellow with the exception of Mazinkaiser SKL which has blue eyes. The face is completed with a mouthplate with several narrow apertures on it.

Even though Grendizer strays a bit from these guidelines, the resemblance to the other Mazingers is obvious.

===Weaponry===
Each Mazinger builds on the previous one by enhancing the power of an attack that already existed, plus adding some new ones. Weapons like Rust Hurricane (or &quot;Booster Hurricane&quot;), Rocket Punch, and Breast Fire are shared by Mazinger Z, Great Mazinger and MazinKaiser; Mazinkaiser comprises the weapons of the two previous Mazingers and adds a factor of uncontrollable energy associated to them (for example, sometimes it&#x27;s hard for Koji to keep the mecha stable when using the two attacks previously mentioned). All Mazingers, except God Mazinger, have &quot;Rocket Punch&quot; attacks, in which they launch their arms as projectiles, which return after being shot towards the enemy.

Grendizer has few similar weapons, but it even expands its arsenal with several large ships that give him different capabilities, such as the Spaizer, Double Spaizer, Drill Spaizer, Marine Spaizer and other related machines. (These are also called &quot;Spacer&quot;)

===Hover Pilder===
Traditionally, Mazingers are controlled thanks to a flying vehicle that docks on the mecha&#x27;s head and activates it.

The first one, built for Mazinger Z, was the Hover Pilder, a small hovercraft, later replaced by the Jet Pilder. In Great Mazinger, this device takes the form of Brain Condor, and in Mazinkaiser it&#x27;s called the Kaiser Pilder, which resembles Brain Condor more closely due to its sharp shape (in contrast to Mazinger Z&#x27;s Pilder, that had a more bulbous shape) and the way it rests on Kaiser&#x27;s head, leaving one of its fins standing vertically like the crest of a rooster.

These aircraft are always red, except in the &quot;Mazinkaiser OVA&quot; version of &quot;Mazinger Z&quot;, where the Hover Pilder is white. Grendizer doesn&#x27;t have a small aircraft, instead the robot itself is fitted inside a larger ship called the spazer for aerial attacks and the robot can launch from it when ever there is a need for a ground battle. Some times Grendizer can stand on top of the spaizer and use it to fly so it can have more freedom in aerial battles.

===Jet Scrander / Jet Scrambler===
Mazinger Z wasn&#x27;t conceived as a flying robot, and hence he is later equipped with Jet Scrander (or &quot;Jet Scrambler&quot;), a detachable device that allows him to face aerial monsters. This machine also had razor-sharp wings that could be used to cut enemies while in flight.

Great Mazinger has an incorporated Scramble Dash, that can retract itself when not needed. However, he is also given Great Booster, a very powerful device that attached itself to Great&#x27;s body pretty much the same way Jet Scrander did to Z&#x27;s and allowed him to fly at higher speeds.

Mazinkaiser has Kaiser Scrander (or &quot;Kaiser Scrambler&quot;), which is very similar to Jet Scrander in its colour scheme (red and yellow) and the fact that it&#x27;s not part of the mecha but connects to it when required. Notably, since Kaiser can&#x27;t use his chest plate as boomerang (a Great Mazinger gimmick) he uses Kaiser Scrander in a similar fashion, due to its sharp wings.

The Shin Mazinger incarnation presents the God Scrander (&quot;God Scrambler&quot;), which appears on the first chapters and in the latter part of the series. It also allows Mazinger to use a new attack, the Big Bang Punch, which consists in Shin combining with the God Scrander and transforming into a gigantic hand, and later making a fist that immediately turns golden-coloured, and is used as a scaled-up Rocket Punch. During the transformation, the God Scrander would compose three of the &quot;fingers&quot;, and Mazinger uses his arms as the other two.

===Female mecha===
Mazinger pioneered the concept of female mechas that, while not nearly as powerful as the main robot (with the probable exception of Minerva X, as she was designed to be a direct counterpart to Mazinger Z), play a significant role in the battle against the enemy.

Their most noticeable characteristic is their main weapon, the &quot;Oppai Missiles&quot;, missiles posing as breasts placed on the mecha&#x27;s chest. Again, Minerva doesn&#x27;t follow this canon completely since her breast fire is identical to the male Mazingers, and she wasn&#x27;t controlled by a human being (until her appearance in the &quot;Mazinger Angels&quot; series).

No female mechas were included in &quot;Grendizer&quot;, but characters like Hikaru and Maria prove to be helpful and brave in battle. They are (in order of appearance): Aphrodite A, Minerva X, Diana A, and Venus A.

Notably, in &quot;Mazinger Angels&quot;, Minerva has a special berserker mode, the &quot;Sirene Mode&quot;, in which she takes a form similar to that of Silene, a character from Nagai&#x27;s &quot;Devilman&quot;.

===Shared characters===
Many characters appear in different points of each plot;
*Kouji Kabuto: The original Mazinger Z pilot reappears towards the ending of the &quot;Great Mazinger&quot; series, again piloting Mazinger Z. He then appears in &quot;Grendizer&quot;, but this time he does not pilot a mecha but a spaceship, and later the Double Spaizer. Koji becomes the pilot of MazinKaiser in the most recent incarnation of the series. Sayaka Yumi also appears in the three main &quot;Mazinger&quot; sagas.
*Dr. Hell: Mazinger Z&#x27;s nemesis, this evil scientist dies at the end of that storyline, but is brought back to life as the Great Marshall of Hell in &quot;Great Mazinger&quot;. He reappears in &quot;Mazinkaiser&quot; and &quot;Shin Mazinger Z-Hen&quot;.
*Shiro Kabuto: Koji&#x27;s little brother, appears in &quot;Mazinger Z&quot; and &quot;Great Mazinger&quot;, where he learns that Kenzo Kabuto is his father, thought to be dead in the previous series.
*Archduke Gorgon: In &quot;Mazinger Z&quot; he plays a treacherous role as Hell&#x27;s collaborator, when in reality he is a messenger from the Mikene Empire, who are using Hell to their own profit. Only in &quot;Great Mazinger&quot; his true hierarchy among the Mikenese armies is revealed.
*Hikaru Makiba and Maria Fleed: two female characters from &quot;Grendizer&quot;, pilots of Marine Spaizer and Drill Spaizer respectively, appear as pilots in &quot;Mazinger Angels&quot;, Hikaru piloting Diana and Maria piloting Minerva.

===Villains===
Mazinger villains tend to be bizarre, having a dual nature or bodies that are made of disparate parts:
*Baron Ashura&#x27;s body is half male and half female, he/she resulted from a bizarre experiment of Dr. Hell who stitched together incomplete parts of two ancient mummies and then revived the resulting body &#x27;à-la-Frankenstein&#x27;.
*Count Blocken was a German Waffen-SS officer who, gravely wounded, was given to the unearthly cares of Dr. Hell, a Nazi collaborator during the second World War. He managed to save his life by keeping alive his severed head, which can float on its own and never rests on his shoulders.
*Viscount Pigman has the body of a large tribal warrior and where the head should be there&#x27;s a mannequin-like upper body of a pygmy shaman.
*Archduke Gorgon&#x27;s trunk is placed on the back of a sabretooth tiger.
*Marquis Janus can twist her neck 180 degrees, shifting from the face of a beautiful woman to that of a haggard witch.
*The Seven Generals of Mikene are composed of different parts of animals grouped together, like mammals, birds, humanoids, etc.
*General Gandal, of the Vegan empire, shares the same body with Lady Gandal; at first his face would split to show a feminine figure from the inside; later her face alternatively replaces Gandal&#x27;s, often taking control of the body. This is a similar masculine-feminine duality to the one seen in Baron Ashura.

===Evil mecha armies===
One of the main attributes of the &quot;Mazinger&quot; series is the existence of a large amount of evil mechas, which are incredibly varied in shape and weapons and serve as monsters of the week. Dr. Hell&#x27;s Mechanical Beasts, the Mikene Empire Warrior Beasts and the Vegan Empire Spacial Monsters usually have nightmarish appearances, and though they are never as powerful as the hero robot, they are quite capable of putting him against the ropes.

<text>Cecilia of Sweden (Swedish: &quot;Cecilia Gustavsdotter Vasa&quot;; 16 November 1540 – 27 January 1627), was Princess of Sweden as the daughter of King Gustav I and his second wife, Margaret Leijonhufvud, and Margravine of Baden-Rodemachern as the wife of Christopher II, Margrave of Baden-Rodemachern. She is the most famous daughter of Gustav I, known for a courtship scandal in connection with a sister&#x27;s wedding and for a lengthy stay in England under Elizabeth I where her first child was born.

== Biography ==

===Early life===
Cecilia was described as the most beautiful of the daughters of Gustav I, and was frequently mentioned because of her beauty. She has been referred to as somewhat of a Black Sheep of the family, because of the scandals she was involved in. During her early childhood, she, as well as her siblings in the royal nursery, were primarily under the care of her mother&#x27;s trusted nurse, Brigitta Lars Anderssons, her mother&#x27;s cousin Lady Margareta and the noble widow Ingrid Amundsdotter. After the death of her mother in 1551, she as well as her siblings were placed in the care of Christina Gyllenstierna and then under her aunts Brita and Martha Leijonhufvud before her father&#x27;s marriage to Catherine Stenbock. They were then under the responsibility of their stepmother and, more precisely, the head lady-in-waiting Anna Hogenskild.

In 1556, she and her sisters were given a dowry of 100.000 daler, had their portraits painted and their personal qualities described in Latin by the court poet Henricus Mollerus and presented on the dynastic marriage market. The same year, her father presented Ostfriesland (East Frisia) with a trading treaty and a marriage alliance. Ostfriesland was chosen because it was strategically placed toward Denmark, and because the Calvinistic Emden was a rival to Lubeck and a treaty could break the domination of the Hanseatic league in Sweden. In 1557, the trading treaty was completed, and in 1558, Edzard II, ruler of East Frisia visited Sweden to meet Cecilia and her sister Catherine Vasa and chose one of them to complete the marriage treaty, and Edzard chose Catherine.

The wedding between Catherine and Edzard took place in Stockholm 1 October 1559. In November, Catherine and Edzard left for Ostfriesland. Upon their journey through Sweden, they were accompanied by Cecilia and the brother of Edzard, John II of Ostfriesland. While staying at the residence of Prince Magnus in Vadstena Castle on the way, a great scandal erupted when John was discovered in Cecilia&#x27;s chamber without his trousers. The scandal became famous under the name &quot;Vadstenabullret&quot; (Vadstena Rumble). The king had been reluctant to let Cecilia follow, as there were at the time negotiations of a marriage between her and George John of Palatine Veldenz, and asked for her to return early: he also asked Catherine and Edzard to remain in Sweden for the winter, so he asked Magnus to delay their departure. 

Several nights in a row, the palace guards observed a man climbing in through the window of Cecilia&#x27;s bedroom. After this had happened four times a row, they informed her brother Prince Eric, who asked his brother Magnus and his courtiers to advise him. They decided to keep Cecilia&#x27;s window under guard, so that the man in question could not be in a position to deny the matter if he was caught. When the same thing happened the night of 13–14 December, Eric sent Charles de Mornay with some guards to arrest the man, and when they entered Cecilia&#x27;s bedroom, they found the brother of the groom, John II of Ostfriesland, in Cecilia&#x27;s bedroom without any hose (pants) on. Eric had John imprisoned, held interrogations then sent John to the king, who imprisoned him in Örbyhus Castle. The 17 December, Catherine and Edzard were sent to Västerås Castle and placed under house arrest, while Eric and Cecilia were both recalled to Stockholm.

Cecilia accused her father of having beaten her and ripped her hair off. The king is said to have cried when he told the story to his wife. He accused Catherine and Erik for not having restrained Cecilia as they should, he had Charles de Mornay arrested and reprimanded Erik for having caused the scandal by his way of handling the whole affair by not having dealt with it in secret but instead exposed it in public. Catherine was allowed to see the king in June 1560: she acted as mediator and tried to issue John&#x27;s, her own and her consort&#x27;s release, protested against the confiscation of Cecilia&#x27;s jewelry and asked the queen, Catherine Stenbock to speak for her, which it seems as the queen did. The mother of John had several foreign powers send ambassadors to Sweden to speak for John&#x27;s release. Erik suggested that Cecilia and John be forced to marry each other, but the king did not like the idea and it is unknown whether the suggestion was ever presented to the two. In the summer of 1560, John was released after having been forced to swear before the monarch and the royal council that nothing sexual had taken place between him and Cecilia. The brothers of Cecilia stamped a coin which pictured her as Susanna in the bath, indicating that she was as innocent as the legendary Susanna of the Bible.

In 1563, Eric XIV discovered Cecilia and her sister having a party in their rooms in the middle of the night. This led to an argument between Cecilia and Eric. It is presumed that it was because of this incident, as well as the Vadstena scandal, that Eric issued a new protocol for the royal court, in which his sisters were to be placed under more a strict observation to prevent them from damaging their reputation, such as leaving the palace at night or early morning or accepting guests at night or letters without permission. This was particularly in regard to Cecilia, as Eric accused her of mixing with questionable people. The rules also banned the princesses from receiving supplicants and meddle in politics on their behalf, or to in any way interfere in affairs of state: the same year, Cecilia, Anna and Sophia had sent a letter of protest to Eric regarding his imprisonment of their brother John, something he had a very negative reaction to. Cecilia had protested openly toward these regulations.

Cecilia and her sister Anna were long supposed to be married to Louis of Palatine-Simmern, George John of Palatine-Veldenz or Poppo of Henneberg. The purpose was to make the Vasa Dynasty related to the more influential German families. The negotiation with Georg John was advanced when he chose Anna over her after the Vadstena scandal. In 1561, she was proposed to by Henry, the earl of Arundel. She was willing to accept, but Eric does not seem to have given it much consideration. In 1562, she was proposed by the Polish magnate count Johan (Jan) Tenczynski. Eric liked the idea, and according to Cecilia, he forced her to agree, but the plans did not materialize.

Cecilia married Christopher II, Margrave of Baden-Rodemachern (1537–1575), in June 1564 in Stockholm. It is noted that the wedding was far less luxurious than that of her sister Anna, and that it seem to have taken place without much negotiation: the first contract had been signed as late as March the same year. Neither does there seem to have been any political purpose behind the marriage.

=== English journey ===
Immediately after the wedding, she traveled to England on an official state visit. She arrived in the autumn of 1565 after traveling some 400 miles by water and 750 miles on ice and snow. Cecilia had been engaged in a correspondence with Elizabeth for several years and seems to have felt admiration for her on a personal level. She successfully asked Elizabeth for an invitation to England already in 1562, and learned to speak English from English people in Sweden. Cecilia traveled to England through Estonia, Prussia, Poland and Germany (without visiting the home of her consort) to Antwerp in the Spanish Netherlands. She managed to meet her imprisoned brother John before her departure, and when she arrived in Swedish Estonia, Eric asked his governor in Reval to keep her under supervision, as he suspected her to be more loyal to their brother John than to him. In the Duchy of Prussia, she successfully asked the duke to work with the Danish monarch to free her brother John. During her stay with her sister Catherine in East Frisia, she is believed to have discussed the imprisonment of John, as Catherine soon after sent Eric a furious letter about his imprisonment of John.

Cecilia left for England from Calais in September 1565. She was given Bedford House in London as her residence, where she was welcomed by the Countess of Sussex and the wife of William Cecil. After a couple of days rest, Cecilia made her formal entrance to London on 11 September, dressed in black velvet trimmed with silver and surrounded by her ladies-in-waiting dressed in red. After this, Elizabeth visited Cecilia in Bedford House. According to the Spanish ambassador to England, Cecilia and Elizabeth got along very nicely. They visited weddings and dinners together, at Christmas 1565, Cecilia received communion directly after Elizabeth, and her consort was given an allowance as long as he allowed Cecilia to remain in England. While there she delivered her first child, Edward, who was carried to his christening by Elizabeth. One of her maids-of-honor was Helena Snakenborg (later Marchioness of Northampton), who was to stay at the English court when Cecilia left in May 1566.

Cecilia&#x27;s visit to England was part of an attempt to convince Queen Elizabeth I to marry her half-brother King Eric XIV. She was also to recruit English pirates to attack hostile Danish, German and Polish ships on the Baltic Sea. In January 1566, Eric also gave her the task of negotiating an alliance between Sweden and England to assist Sweden in its attempt to have peace in the war between Sweden and Denmark. There are conflicting reports as to how she managed these negotiations. As for the marriage question, some reports claim that she tried to go through the Earl of Leicester. However, Cecilia had her own agenda, and also tried to make Elizabeth interfere in the matter of her brother John&#x27;s imprisonment, and in October, Elizabeth wrote to Eric and asked him to release John. She upheld a contact with the Duke of Prussia regarding her attempts to free John. She was also in close contact with the Spanish ambassador at the English court, because the lands of her consort were partially placed in Spanish Luxembourg.

The relationship between Cecilia and Elizabeth was damaged because of Cecilia&#x27;s close contact with the Spanish ambassador, and because of the scandals caused by her debts. Cecilia acquired enormous debts because of the style she felt was necessary to live according to her status at court. In November 1566, her consort was forced to leave for Germany in an attempt to borrow money for her. Her greatest creditors were George North and John Diamond (also called Dymoch): she also used the doctor Cornelius Alnetanus who borrowed her money and pawned things for her. Alnetanus was previously exiled from court by Elizabeth for trying to convince her that he could make gold, and Elizabeth imprisoned him after he violated her order not to have anything to do with Cecilia. In March, Christopher returned to England in secret and tried to abduct Cecilia from her creditors, but was discovered and put in prison by his creditors. Elizabeth had him freed, but this definitely ended the friendship between Cecilia and the queen. In April 1566, Cecilia pawned her jewelry and wardrobe to finance their trip to Baden. In Dover, however, they were stopped and most of their luggage was confiscated in the names of their creditors North and Diamond. However, not only was Cecilia&#x27;s and Christopher&#x27;s luggage confiscated, but also that of Cecilia&#x27;s Swedish ladies-in-waiting (who had no debts), and Cecilia and her courtiers regarded themselves to have been subjected to theft. She was pregnant at this point, and when she finally reached Rodemachern (now Rodemack) her son was born handicapped, for which she blamed her creditors for the rest of her life.

=== Countess of Arboga ===
In August 1566, Cecilia arrived to Baden-Rodemachern, where she stayed for five years. The religious war in the Netherlands was ongoing and the troops of the Duke of Alba moved around the territory of her residence and occupied her dower lands, which caused her economic distress. In 1569, the second half of Baden, Baden-Baden, was inherited by the underage nephew of her consort and placed under the rule of his Catholic relative Albert V of Bavaria, who treated the Protestants with brutality. Cecilia wrote to her brother John III of Sweden and stated that she feared for their safety, and asked for permission to return to Sweden.

Upon their arrival in Kalmar in Sweden in 1571, she was informed of the arrival of an English merchant, John Dymosh (also called John Diamond), with a fleet of 50 ships. This was her former creditor, who had confiscated her property in lieu of debts upon her departure. Cecilia was given permission from John to arrest Dymosh, whose fleet was confiscated – he was to spend five years in prison. Christopher left Sweden soon after to fulfill his promise to John in exchange for his permission to live in Sweden: to provide Sweden with mercenaries upon the ongoing war with Russia. He never returned. 
In Sweden, Cecilia was granted the city of Arboga as her personal fief, and styled herself Countess of Arboga. Cecilia had the authority to manage the trading policy and the legal system and see to it that the royal laws were respected, and she also managed certain taxation on import and export. In addition to earning income on mining and farming, Cecilia was also active within piracy. One of her missions in Sweden was to have her dowry finally paid to her. John III could not afford to do so. Cecilia was given a fleet of ships from John as partial payment of her dowry, and used this fleet to attack ships on the Baltic Sea. John had several licences issued to pirates on the Baltic Sea with permission to attack ships on their way to Russia, often English and Dutch, to disturb Russian trade during the war between Sweden and Russia. Cecilia, however, also came in conflict with John because she violated her permission by also attacking ships from friendly nations, such as Danish, which created tension between Sweden and Denmark.

In the autumn of 1573, the Mornay plot was prepared to assassinate John III. The plot was led by Charles de Mornay, who was in contact with Christina of Denmark and the French ambassador in Copenhagen Charles Dancay. John III was to be killed during a swords dance performed by Scottish mercenaries at the party which was to be given in October that year before the Scottish mercenaries departure to the Baltic. After the assassination, Duke Charles was to be placed upon the throne. Charles de Mornay, who had previously been the favorite of Eric XIV, promised that he knew the location of Eric&#x27;s alleged hidden gold reserve, which he would reveal after the coup in exchange for better conditions for Eric in prison. However, the plot did not materialize because at the party, de Mornay never dared to give the sign to the mercenaries to take action. In September 1574, the plot was revealed and Charles de Mornay was arrested, interrogated and executed. It was never made clear who participated in the plot. However, it is noted, that the suspected conspirators Hogenskild Bielke, Gustaf Banér and Pontus De la Gardie often gathered at meetings in the apartment of Princess Elizabeth, meetings where Princess Cecilia had also frequently been seen, and the two sisters and their brother Charles were somewhat compromised though they were never accused. It seem that John III suspected her to have prepared a rebellion against him: in 1573, he gave order that Cecilia was not to be allowed in the Stockholm Castle during his absence, and in 1574, after the plot had been exposed, he gave orders to the governors in Östergötland to keep Cecilia under watch and not to let her have access to any royal castle.

On 2 August 1575, her absent consort Christopher died, and her under age son Edvard Fortunatus formally succeeded him as Margrave of Baden-Rodemarchern, albeit in his absence with her in Sweden. According to the marriage contract, Cecilia was secured the right to be regent should her son succeed while still minor. However, upon the death of Christopher, her former in-laws had the documents which secured her rights confiscated and took control over her dower lands as well as the rule of the entire Baden-Rodemarchern officially as the guardians and regents of her son. When Cecilia sent representatives to Baden to secure her rights in 1576, they were turned away and her authority as regent was not acknowledged. Cecilia converted to Catholicism as a way to secure her and her sons rights to the domains of her late spouse. Her conversion likely took place in connection to the visit of the papal legate Antonio Possevino to Sweden in 1577.

In the summer of 1578, a Spanish ambassador, Francisco de Eraso, arrived to Sweden. John III wished to make an alliance with Spain to prevent Denmark and Poland to interfere with the Swedish war against Russia. He also wished Spanish assistance to secure the Italian lands which he had the right to after his mother-in-law Bona Sforza. John III suggested that Cecilia, being a Catholic, could be made governor in one of the Spanish lands in Europe, preferably Luxembourg. Cecilia invited Eraso to Arboga and issued her own negotiations with him. She supported the plans of making her Spanish governor and offered her own pirate fleet to serve in the Spanish war in the Netherlands. This caused a conflict with her Protestant brother Charles, who begun to attack her fleet with his own. According to Eraso&#x27;s reports, Cecilia acted as a valuable informer to Spain. When John&#x27;s negotiations with Spain failed, he became suspicious of Cecilia&#x27;s dealings with Eraso. John had Eraso placed in house arrest and banned him from any contact with Cecilia. In the night of 17–18 June 1579, Cecilia bribed her way in to Stockholm in secret and attempted to see Eraso. The alarm rang, and Cecilia and her retinue was captured by the guard and brought to John, which caused a great scene between the siblings. Shortly after, Cecilia returned to Germany, followed by the exiled Francisco de Eraso.

=== Baden ===

Upon her return to Baden in 1579, Cecilia sought to take control over her dower lands and of Baden-Rodemachen from the relatives of her late consort in name of her son. Francisco de Eraso and Cecilia lived together in Baden for a time before Eraso continued on his way to Spain. During this time, she gave birth to a daughter, which caused a scandal as she had by that time been a widow for four years. The daughter, who was fathered by Eraso, was placed in the convent of Liethentahl by Edvard Fortunatus against Cecilia&#x27;s will, and she was not allowed to see her again until 1622: she took the vows as an adult and is known only by her name as a nun, Charitas.

In her struggle against the family of her late consort, she was supported by the papal legate Antonio Possevino, Eraso and John III: her other brother Charles IX, however, broke with her after the birth of Charitas. She also had her sons placed in care of the Jesuits. Her alliance with Spain, however, eventually made her lose the support of John as well, who in 1581 refused her to return to Sweden. Cecilia lived on the income of her Swedish estate, but this was confiscated by John in 1585 after her opposition to his marriage with Gunilla Bielke.

In 1588, her son Edvard Fortunatus took control of Baden-Rodemachen. He confiscated Cecilia&#x27;s dower lands, and as both he and Cecilia amounted huge debts. Cecilia became a known diplomat when she courted various Catholic power holders on behalf of herself and her son in economical and political matters on constant journeys. This became even more necessary in 1596, when her son was deposed by the Protestant line of the Baden dynasty after his unequal 1593 marriage to Maria van Eicken. She is described as a talented diplomat with a great wit and verbal talent. She courted her nephew the Polish monarch, the German Roman Emperor and the Pope. As margravine within the Holy Roman Empire, she had the right to a seat at the empirical German-Roman assembly, a right she also used: in 1613, she addressed the Imperial German Roman Assembly in Regensburg in favor of her second son, who had been imprisoned by the Protestant line of Baden. She was often successful as she secured favorable sentences in her favor at the Imperial Court, but as the sentences could not be carried out in territories which was de jure but not de facto controlled by the Emperor, they were of little practical value. Cecilia was a target of Protestant propaganda for her conversion to Catholicism and political activity. The perhaps most known slander against her was a story by Everhard van Reyd: he claimed that she hosted a brothel in Antwerp, and that her son had to drag her from it in her hair (1590). She was also compared to Empress Messalina.

Cecilia lived in a difficult situation, as she was forced to support herself by loans due to her lack of income and was often hunted by her creditors. In 1618, her estate was taken and she fled by carriage to make contact with the archbishop of Trier in Luxembourg: to escape her persecutors, she was forced to abandon her carriage and jump over the border to Lorraine. Upon the outbreak of the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the Protestant line of the Baden dynasty was deposed by the Imperial army and her grandson was as a Catholic allowed to take control over the entire territory of Baden. Cecilia was able to return to her estate in Rodemachen and spend her last years in comfort.

<text>Nihil novi nisi commune consensu (&quot;Nothing new without the common consent&quot;) is the original Latin title of a 1505 act or constitution adopted by the Polish &quot;Sejm&quot; (parliament), meeting in the royal castle at Radom.

== Etymology ==
The Latin expression, &quot;nihil novi&quot; (&quot;nothing new&quot;), had previously appeared in the Vulgate Bible phrase, &quot;nihil novi sub sole&quot; (&quot;there is nothing new under the sun&quot;), in &quot;Ecclesiastes&quot; 1:9.

&quot;Nihil novi&quot; in this political sense, is interpreted in the vernacular as &quot;Nothing about us without us&quot; (in Polish, &quot;Nic o nas bez nas&quot;).

==History==

&quot;Nihil novi&quot; effectively established &quot;nobles&#x27; democracy&quot; in what came to be known as the Polish &quot;Commonwealth [or Republic] of the Nobility&quot;. It was a major component of the evolution and eventual dominant position of the Polish parliament (Sejm).

== &quot;Nihil novi&quot; ==
The act of &quot;Nihil novi&quot; was passed in 1505 during a Sejm session in Radom () that lasted from 30 March to 31 May and was held at the . It was signed by King Alexander Jagiellon on 31 March and adopted by the Sejm on 30 May.

The Sejm&quot;&quot;&#x27;s 1505 Act of &quot;Nihil novi nisi commune consensu&quot; marked an important victory for Poland&#x27;s nobility over her kings. It forbade the king to issue laws without the consent of the nobility, represented by the &quot;Senat&quot; and Chamber of Deputies, except for laws governing royal cities, crown lands (&quot;królewszczyzny&quot;), mines, fiefdoms, royal peasants, and Jews.

&quot;Nihil novi&quot; invalidated the Privilege of Mielnik, which had strengthened only the magnates, and it thus tipped the balance of power in favor of the Chamber of Deputies (the formally lower chamber of the Parliament), where the ordinary nobility held sway. &quot;Nihil novi&quot; is often regarded as initiating the period in Polish history known as &quot;Nobles&#x27; Democracy,&quot; which was but a limited democracy as only male nobility (&quot;szlachta&quot;) were able to participate (the nobility constituting some ten percent of the Republic&#x27;s population, still a higher eligible percentage than in much of Europe).

That same year, the nobility further expanded their power by abrogating most cities&#x27; voting rights in the Sejm and by forbidding peasants to leave their lands without permission from their feudal lords, thereby firmly establishing a &quot;second serfdom&quot; in Poland.

<doc id="1032641" wikidata="Q1212285" url="?curid=1032641" title="Sentimental Education">
<text>Sentimental Education (French: &quot;L&#x27;éducation sentimentale&quot;, 1869) is a novel by Gustave Flaubert. The story focuses on the romantic life of a young man named Frédéric Moreau at the time of the French Revolution of 1848 and the founding of the Second French Empire. It describes Moreau&#x27;s love for an older woman, a character based on the wife of the music publisher Maurice Schlesinger, who is portrayed in the book as Jacques Arnoux. The novel&#x27;s tone is by turns ironic and pessimistic; it occasionally lampoons French society. The main character often gives himself over to romantic flights of fancy.

Considered one of the most influential novels of the 19th century, it was praised by contemporaries such as George Sand and Émile Zola, but criticised by Henry James.

== Background ==
Flaubert based many of the protagonist&#x27;s experiences, including the romantic passion, on his own life. He wrote of the work in 1864: &quot;I want to write the moral history of the men of my generation—or, more accurately, the history of their feelings. It&#x27;s a book about love, about passion; but passion such as can exist nowadays—that is to say, inactive.&quot;

==Plot summary==

===Part 1===
Frédéric Moreau renews his acquaintance with a childhood friend, Deslauriers, who advises him to meet with Dambreuse, a rich Parisian banker. Frédéric leaves for Paris, armed with a letter of recommendation from his neighbour M. Roque, who works for Dambreuse. Despite this, his introduction to Dambreuse is not very successful. In Paris, Frédéric stumbles across a shop belonging to M. Arnoux, whose wife he developed a fascination for when he met her briefly at the start of the novel. However, he does not act on his discovery, and lives idly in Paris for some months. A little more than a year after the start of the story, Frédéric is at a student protest and meets Hussonnet, who works at M. Arnoux&#x27;s shop. Frédéric becomes one of the friends of M. Arnoux who meet at the shop. Eventually, he is invited to dinner with M. and Mme Arnoux. At the same time, his old friend Deslauriers comes to Paris. Frédéric becomes obsessed with Mme. Arnoux. Deslauriers tries to distract him by taking him to a cabaret, where they encounter M. Arnoux and his mistress Mlle Vatnaz. Later, Frédéric is persuaded to return home to his mother, who is having financial difficulties. At home, he meets Louise, the daughter of his neighbour M. Roque. His financial worries are eased by the chance death of an uncle, and he leaves again for Paris.

===Part 2===
Returning to Paris, Frédéric finds that M. and Mme Arnoux no longer live at their previous address. He searches the city, eventually meeting Regimbart, one of his group of friends. He learns that Arnoux has financial problems and is now a pottery merchant. Arnoux introduces Frédéric to another of his mistresses, Rosanette. Frédéric likes Rosanette, and has Pellerin paint him a portrait of her. Mme Arnoux learns of her husband&#x27;s infidelity. Frédéric has promised money to Deslauriers, but lends it to Arnoux instead, who is unable to repay him. Deslauriers and Frédéric fall out. In an attempt to resolve the financial situation, Frédéric returns to Dambreuse, who this time offers him a position. However, Frédéric fails to keep his appointment, instead visiting Mme Arnoux at the pottery factory. She is unresponsive to his advances, and on his return to Paris he instead pursues Rosanette. His difficulties mount and eventually he meets again with Deslauriers, who advises him to return home. At home, Frédéric falls in love with and becomes engaged to Louise, his neighbour&#x27;s daughter. Deslauriers conveys this news to Mme Arnoux, who is upset. Frédéric says he has business to complete in Paris. While there, he meets Mme Arnoux, and they admit their love for each other.

===Part 3===
In the midst of the revolution, Frédéric&#x27;s political writings win him the renewed respect of his friends and of M. Dambreuse. Frédéric, living with Rosanette, becomes jealous of her continued friendship with M. Arnoux, and persuades her to leave with him for the countryside. On his return, Frédéric dines at the Dambreuses&#x27; house with Louise and her father, who have come to Paris to find him. Louise learns of Frédéric&#x27;s relationship with Rosanette. Frédéric meets with Mme Arnoux, who explains why she missed their arranged meeting. During this encounter, Rosanette appears and reveals she is pregnant. Frédéric decides to seduce Mme Dambreuse in order to gain social standing. He is successful, and soon afterwards M. Dambreuse dies. Rosanette&#x27;s newborn child becomes severely ill and lives only a short time. Meanwhile, M. Arnoux has finally been overtaken by his financial difficulties and is preparing to flee the country. Unable to face the loss of Mme Arnoux, Frédéric asks for money from Mme Dambreuse, but is too late to stop M. and Mme Arnoux from leaving. Mme Dambreuse meanwhile discovers his motive for borrowing the money. Frédéric returns to his childhood home, hoping to find Louise there, but discovers that she has given up on him and married Deslauriers instead. Frédéric returns to Paris. Many years later, he briefly meets Mme Arnoux again, swearing his eternal love for her. After another interlude, he encounters Deslauriers and the novel ends the way it began, with the pair swapping stories of the past.

==Characters==
The characters of &quot;Sentimental Education&quot; are marked by capriciousness and self-interest. Frédéric, the main character, is originally infatuated with Madame Arnoux, but throughout the novel falls in and out of love with her. Furthermore, he is unable to decide on a profession and instead lives on his uncle&#x27;s inheritance. Other characters, such as Mr. Arnoux, are as capricious with business as Frédéric is with love. Without their materialism and &quot;instinctive worship of power&quot;, almost the entire cast would be completely rootless. Such was Flaubert&#x27;s judgment of his times, and the continuing applicability of that cynicism goes a long way in explaining the novel&#x27;s enduring appeal.

===Sequence of appearances===
* Frédéric Moreau, the central character, a young man from provincial France, who begins and ends as a member of the middle class.
*Jacques Arnoux, publisher, faience manufacturer; also a speculator and a womanizer, &quot;ill nearly all the time and [looks] like an old man&quot; towards the end of the novel, and eventually dies a year before the novel&#x27;s end.
*Mme Marie (Angèle) Arnoux, his wife, mother of two children, platonic affair with Frédéric, moves to Rome by the end of the novel. Always virtuous and honorable, completely devoted to her two children. 
*Marthe Arnoux, their daughter
*M. Roque, land-owner and M. Dambreuse&#x27;s unsavoury agent; father of Louise Roque.
*Louise (Elisabeth-Olympe-Louise) Roque, his red-headed daughter, a country girl; is passionately in love with Frédéric for a time, marries Deslauriers, leaves him for a singer.
*Charles Deslauriers, law student, close friend of Frederic, a lawyer by the end of the novel. Extremely ambitious but unable to realize his ambitions, he has a jealous, competitive and somewhat parasitical relationship with the more prosperous Frédéric. 
*M. Dambreuse, banker, aristocratic politician, timeserver, financier. Dead in the third part of the novel.
*Mme Dambreuse, his much-younger, very determined, exquisite wife, with whom Frédéric has an affair and almost marries; after Frédéric breaks with her, toward the novel&#x27;s end, she marries an Englishman.
*Baptiste Martinon, law student, a rich farmer&#x27;s son, a reasonably hard-working careerist who ends up a senator by the end of the novel.
*Marquis de Cisy, nobleman and law student, a dapper youth, father of eight by the end of the novel.
*Sénécal, math teacher and uncompromising, puritanical, dogmatic Republican; supposedly dead by the end of the novel.
*Dussardier, a simple and honest shop worker. A committed Republican, he is an active participant in the protests and revolts throughout the book. He dies in the last of these protests we see, run through by Sénécal with his sword.
*Hussonnet, journalist, drama critic, clown, ends up controlling all the theatres and the whole press.
*Regimbart, &quot;The Citizen&quot;, a boozy revolutionary chauvinist; becomes a ghost of a man.
*Pellerin, painter with more theories than talent; becomes a photographer.
*Mlle Vatnaz, actress, courtesan, frustrated feminist with literary pretensions; vanishes by the end of the novel.
*Dittmer, frequent guest of Arnoux
*Delmas or Delmar, actor, singer, showman (may also be the singer introduced in Chapter 1)
*M. and Mme Oudry, guests of the Arnoux
*Catherine, housekeeper for M. Roque
*Eléonore, mother of Louise Roque
*Uncle Barthélemy, wealthy uncle of Frédéric
*Eugène Arnoux, son of the Arnoux
*Rosanette (Rose-Annette) Bron, &quot;The Marshal&quot;, courtesan with many lovers, e.g. M. Oudry; for a time Jacques Arnoux; later she has a lengthy affair with Frédéric. Their little son falls ill and dies in the third part of the novel.
*Clémence, Deslauriers&#x27; mistress
*Marquis Aulnays, Cisy&#x27;s godfather; M. de Forchambeaux, his friend; Baron de Comaing, another friend; M. Vezou, his tutor
*Cécile, officially the &quot;niece&quot; of the Dambreuses, in reality M. Dambreuse&#x27;s illegitimate daughter. Towards the end of the novel she is married to Martinon. Hated by Madame Dambreuse, but favored by her father, she inherits his fortune after his death (much to Mme&#x27;s outrage).
*Another &quot;character&quot;: Mme Arnoux&#x27;s Renaissance silver casket, first noted at her house, then at Rosanette&#x27;s, finally bought at auction by Mme Dambreuse
==Allusions==
Early in the novel, Frédéric compares himself to several popular romantic protagonists of late 18th-century and early 19th-century literature: Young Werther (1774) by Goethe, René (1802) by Chateaubriand, &quot;Lara&quot; (1824) by Byron, Lélia (1833/1839) by George Sand and Frank of &quot;La Coupe et les Lèvres&quot; (1832) by Alfred de Musset. His friend Deslauriers also asks Frédéric to &quot;remember&quot; Rastignac from Balzac&#x27;s &quot;Comédie humaine&quot;, and Frédéric asks Mlle. Louise Roque if she still has her copy of &quot;Don Quixote&quot;.

==Literary significance and reception==
Henry James, an early and passionate admirer of Flaubert, considered the book a large step down from its famous predecessor. &quot;Here the form and method are the same as in &quot;Madame Bovary&quot;; the studied skill, the science, the accumulation of material, are even more striking; but the book is in a single word a &quot;dead&quot; one. &quot;Madame Bovary&quot; was spontaneous and sincere; but to read its successor is, to the finer sense, like masticating ashes and sawdust. &quot;L&#x27;Education Sentimentale&quot; is elaborately and massively dreary. That a novel should have a certain charm seems to us the most rudimentary of principles, and there is no more charm in this laborious monument to a treacherous ideal than there is interest in a heap of gravel.&quot;

György Lukács in his 1971 &quot;Theory of the Novel&quot; found &quot;L&#x27;Education Sentimentale&quot; quintessentially modern in its handling of time as passing in the world and as perceived by the characters.

In 2008, American literary critic James Wood dedicated two chapters of his book &quot;How Fiction Works&quot; to Flaubert&#x27;s significance. The first chapter, &quot;Flaubert and the Modern Narrative&quot;, begins: &quot;Novelists should thank Flaubert the way poets thank spring: it all begins again with him. There really is a time before Flaubert and a time after him. Flaubert established, for good or ill, what most readers think of as modern realist narration, and his influence is almost too familiar to be visible. We hardly remarked of good prose that it favors the telling and a brilliant detail; that it privileges a high degree of visual noticing; that it maintains an unsentimental composure and knows how to withdraw, like a good valet, from superfluous commentary; that it judges good and bad neutrally; that it seeks out the truth, even at the cost of repelling us; and that the author&#x27;s fingerprints on all this are, paradoxically, traceable but not visible. You can find some of this in Defoe or Austen or Balzac, but not all of it until Flaubert.&quot;

French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu made a map of the novel&#x27;s social spaces, linking social organization to literary space.

<text>My Boyfriend&#x27;s Back is a 1993 American zombie horror comedy film directed by Bob Balaban which tells the story of Johnny Dingle (Andrew Lowery), a teenage boy who returns from the dead as a zombie to meet Missy McCloud (Traci Lind), the girl he&#x27;s in love with, for a date. The film received negative reviews.

The film&#x27;s title is a reference to the 1963 song of the same name by The Angels (which is used in the promotional trailers, but not featured in the film itself). The original title of the film, &quot;Johnny Zombie&quot;, was changed shortly before the film&#x27;s theatrical release. Philip Seymour Hoffman, Matthew McConaughey, and Matthew Fox appear in small roles in the film.

==Plot==
Johnny Dingle has been in love with Missy McCloud since they were kids. In his senior year of high school, he decides to fake a robbery at Missy&#x27;s job with his best friend, Eddie. He hopes that by stopping the &quot;robbery&quot; he will impress her and she will go to the prom with him.

During the &quot;robbery&quot; a real robber holds Johnny and Missy at gunpoint. Thinking that the robber is Eddie, Johnny dies taking a bullet meant for Missy. After the funeral, Johnny rises from the grave. He is greeted by Murray the gravedigger, who warns him that he can&#x27;t leave the cemetery. Johnny ignores him and goes back to his home.

Missy is hesitant to be around Johnny, but changes her mind when her boyfriend Buck and his dim-witted friend Chuck discriminate against him for being a Zombie. They go on a date, which goes well until Missy accidentally rips Johnny&#x27;s ear off.

Johnny goes to the town doctor, Dr. Bronson, who refers him to a woman named Maggie, the widow of a zombie. She tells Johnny that he needs to eat the flesh of the living to stop decaying.

Johnny and Missy meet up at the library, where he&#x27;s attacked by Buck and Chuck. Chuck accidentally hits himself in the head with an ax and dies. Johnny eats Chuck&#x27;s body, invoking the wrath of Chuck&#x27;s father, Big Chuck.

Missy&#x27;s father, the town sheriff, tells Johnny to leave town for his own safety. Johnny doesn&#x27;t listen and returns to Missy at night, but leaves when he bites her arm. He&#x27;s captured by Dr. Bronson, who attempts to dissect Johnny and create a youth formula from his zombie cells. Johnny escapes when Big Chuck leads a mob to kill him, with Missy and Eddie helping him. He flees to the cemetery, where Murray, his parents, Eddie, and Missy defend him, earning him the town and the sheriff&#x27;s acceptance. Johnny and Missy dance, but Johnny begins to decay and dies.

In Heaven, he&#x27;s told by the gatekeeper that he was not meant to die in the robbery (which is why he came back as a zombie), and he is sent back to the moment before the robber entered. The events replay but Johnny survives this time due to the bullet hitting Missy&#x27;s locket. Johnny and Missy go to the prom as a couple, with Johnny&#x27;s voiceover explaining that the only thing he would have changed about the whole experience was that he would have eaten Buck.

==Production==
A script, initially consisting mainly of comic sketches about a teenage boy transforming into a zombie, was presented to writer Dean Lorey by a friend, who asked him to develop a cohesive story. In September 1992, Touchstone Pictures initiated development on the project, then titled &quot;Johnny Zombie&quot;. Actor-director Bob Balaban became involved in October 1992 after receiving the script in August 1992, giving him only a few weeks to prepare for production. Balaban enlisted several actors from his previous collaborations, including Austin Pendleton, Mary Beth Hurt, Cloris Leachman, and Jules Feiffer. The film marked the cinematic debuts of Matthew Fox and Matthew McConaughey. Renée Zellweger&#x27;s only scene was cut from the film.

Principal photography commenced on November 2, 1992, in the Hill Country region of central Texas, encompassing locations such as Austin, the Georgetown town square, and the C. D. Fulkes Middle School in Round Rock. The eight-week shoot used a budget of less than $10 million. Shortly before its theatrical release, the title was altered to &quot;My Boyfriend’s Back&quot;, contributing to a trend of recent films adopting titles from popular songs.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 13% of 23 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating was 3.4/10. &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;an idiotic offbeat comedy&quot; that &quot;repeats ideas and jokes more effectively used in his 1989 &quot;Parents&quot;.&quot; Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;If &quot;My Boyfriend&#x27;s Back&quot; is an irredeemably silly movie, it has an engaging lightness of tone and uniformly impeccable performances by a cast that maintains just the right attitude of deadpan parody.&quot; Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it &quot;an awful teen horror comedy&quot; and said it &quot;has a disastrous tone of sunny sitcom jauntiness&quot; when it should have focused on dark satire. Mark Caro of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; wrote, &quot;The movie is full of nonsensical plot twists, embarrassingly broad performances and unappealing characters.&quot; Caro criticized the casting of Lowery, calling his character &quot;perhaps the least interesting movie zombie ever&quot;. Jeff Shannon of the &quot;Seattle Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Simply put, absolutely none of it works. The movie utterly fails to set a foundation for its dark fantasy, effectively turning every character into a moron.&quot; Ty Burr of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; rated it &quot;D&quot; and compared it negatively to &quot;Heathers&quot;. Academic Peter Dendle called it the best of the zombie romantic comedy films of the late 1980s and early 1990s but criticized its use of family-friendly themes as &quot;cheesy&quot; and &quot;saccharine&quot;.

===Themes===
Peter Dendle identifies the themes of the film as being standard teen film tropes. Dingle&#x27;s urges to eat his date are a metaphor for teenage sexual activity, and his fear of decomposition is teenage anxiety over acne. As a zombie, Dingle is discriminated against and ostracized, which is meant to show zombies as outsiders.

<doc id="1032659" wikidata="Q898256" url="?curid=1032659" title="Firebreak">
<text>A firebreak or double track (also called a fire line, fuel break, fireroad and firetrail in Australia) is a gap in vegetation or other combustible material that acts as a barrier to slow or stop the progress of a bushfire or wildfire. A firebreak may occur naturally where there is an absence of vegetation or &quot;fuel&quot;, such as a river, lake or canyon. Firebreaks may also be man-made, and many of these also serve as roads, such as logging roads, four-wheel drive trails, secondary roads, or highways.

==Overview==
In the construction of a firebreak, the primary goal is to remove deadwood and undergrowth down to mineral soil. Various methods may be used to accomplish this initially and to maintain this condition. Ideally, the firebreak will be constructed and maintained according to the established practices of sustainable forestry and fire protection engineering, also known as best management practices (BMP). The general goals are to maximize the effectiveness of the firebreak at slowing the spread of wildfire, and, by using firebreaks of sufficient size and density, to reduce the ultimate size of wildfires. Additional goals are to maintain the ecology of the forest and to reduce the impact of wildfires on air pollution and the global climate, and to balance the costs and benefits of the various projects.

These goals can be achieved through the use of appropriate operating practices, many of which can be potentially mutually beneficial to all. In many cases, it may be useful for firebreak upkeep to be maintained along with the harvesting of forestry products, such as lumber and biomass fuel, since the objectives are fundamentally related, in that the basic goals are to remove material from the forest. Furthermore, if done properly, the value of these products can significantly offset the cost of maintaining the firebreak. In addition, these commercial industries and small businesses are helped by a reduction in the property damages caused by wildfires, and reduced risk of investment. The biomass material that is not suitable for dimensioned lumber is suitable to make woodchips for the paper industry and the energy industry. Larger trees are sometimes left in place within some types of firebreaks, to shade the forest floor and reduce the rate of fuel accumulation, and to enhance the landscaping in recreational and inhabited locations.

===Prevalence===
Forested areas often contain vast networks of firebreaks. Some communities are also using firebreaks as part of their city planning strategy. An example is the city of Revelstoke, British Columbia, which includes firebreaks in their Community Wildfire Protection Plan.

===Effectiveness===

Depending on the environmental conditions, and the relative effectiveness of a given firebreak, firebreaks often have to be backed up with other firefighting efforts. Even then, it is still sometimes possible for fire to spread across a seemingly impenetrable divide. For example, during the Cedar Fire of 2003, strong Santa Ana winds had blown enough burning embers across a 10-lane section of Interstate 15 to ignite the vegetation on the other side. During the 1988 fires in Yellowstone National Park, hot embers managed to cross the Lewis Canyon, a natural canyon up to a mile wide and 600 feet (180 m) deep. In Australia, firebreaks are less effective against eucalyptus forest fires, since intense fires in tinder-dry eucalyptus forest spread through flying embers, which can be carried by the winds to trigger new blazes several kilometres away. In 2019, goats deployed to graze the nearby flammable vegetation and create a firebreak helped save the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum and Getty Museum from California wildfires.

== Green firebreak ==
Green firebreaks are lines of low flammability vegetation, planted to retard fire. Among their advantages are lower cost, biodiversity and reduced erosion.

==History==
Due to a lack of a standardized firefighting force at the time, the Great Fire of London in 1666 instead saw the Tower of London garrison using gunpowder and fire hooks in a widespread, ad-hoc firebreaking campaign across Central London. Historians believe this to have been one of the major contributing factors to the eventual defeat of the inferno.

The world&#x27;s most expensive firebreak was created when part of Van Ness Avenue in San Francisco was dynamited to stop the spread of fire resulting from the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Firefighting after an earthquake can be especially challenging, because an earthquake can cause water mains to rupture, resulting in a complete loss of water pressure.

<text>Spello (in Antiquity: Hispellum) is an ancient town and &quot;comune&quot; (township) of Italy, in the province of Perugia in eastern-central Umbria, on the lower southern flank of Monte Subasio. It is 6 km (4 mi) NNW of Foligno and 10 km (6 mi) SSE of Assisi. It is one of I Borghi più belli d&#x27;Italia (&quot;The most beautiful villages of Italy&quot;).

The old walled town lies on a regularly NW-SE sloping ridge that eventually meets the plain. From the top of the ridge, Spello commands a good view of the Umbrian plain towards Perugia; at the bottom of the ridge, the town spills out of its walls into a small modern section (or &quot;borgo&quot;) served by the rail line from Rome to Florence via Perugia.

==History==

Populated in ancient times by the Umbri, it became a Roman colony in the 1st century BC. Under the reign of Constantine the Great it was called &quot;Flavia Constans&quot;, as attested by a document preserved in the local Communal Palace.

==Main sights==

The densely inhabited town, built with stone, retains its medieval aspect; the town is enclosed in a circuit of medieval walls built on Roman foundations, including three Roman Late Antique gates (&quot;Porta Consolare&quot;, &quot;Porta di Venere&quot; and the &quot;Arch of Augustus&quot;) and traces of three more. The town incorporated the remains of an amphitheater. 

Among the churches of interest in the town are:
*&quot;Santa Maria Maggiore&quot; (known from 1159): The Church was probably built over an ancient temple dedicated to Juno and Vesta. The façade has a Romanesque portal and a 13th-century bell tower, while the pilasters next to the apse have frescoes by Perugino (1512) as well as the later Spello Pietà by the same artist. The most prominent artwork are the Pinturicchio frescoes in the Baglioni Chapel. The Umbrian artist was called to paint it around 1500 by Troilo Baglioni, after he had just finished the Borgia Apartment&#x27;s decoration. The cycle include an &quot;Annunciation&quot;, a &quot;Nativity&quot; and a &quot;Dispute with the Doctors&quot;, plus four &quot;Sibyls&quot; in the vault. 
*&quot;Sant&#x27;Andrea&quot; (known from 1025). Church with 14th-century frescoes and an altarpiece by Pinturicchio.
*&quot;San Lorenzo&quot; (12th century): Church where San Bernardino da Siena began his sermons in 1438.
*&quot;San Claudio&quot; (11th century or earlier), an elegant example of Romanesque architecture with a rose window on the asymmetrical façade. The interior has 14th century votive frescoes from the Umbrian school. It is said to have been built on the remains of a Paleo-Christian cemetery.
*Tega Chapel (14th century), with Umbrian school 15th-century frescoes, including a &quot;Crucifixion&quot; attributed to Nicolò Alunno.

Other points of interest include:
*&quot;Palazzo Comunale Vecchio&quot; (&quot;Old Town Hall&quot;, built in 1270 and enlarged after the end of the Baglioni seigniory, in 1567–1575). It has some frescoed halls, one attributed to the Zuccari brothers. It is faced by a 16th-century fountain.
*&quot;Palazzo dei Canonici&quot; - Priory annexed to the church of Santa Maria Maggiore, it now houses the Town&#x27;s Art Gallery (Pinacoteca Civica). Among the artists featured are the Maestro dell&#x27;Assunta di Amelia, Cola Petruccioli, Zaccaria di Filippo Mazzola (brother of Parmigianino), Andrea d&#x27;Assisi also called Ingegno, and a &quot;Madonna and Child&quot; by Pinturicchio.
*&quot;Palazzo Cruciali&quot;, built in the early 17th century.
*&quot;Palazzo Baglioni&quot;, erected as a fortified mansion around 1359. The Governor&#x27;s Hall has frescoes from the 16th century.
*Arch of Augustus (1st century BC-1st century AD).

An ancient Roman temple, dating to the 4th century AD, was discovered by researchers in 2023 underneath a carpark in Spello. According to Professor Douglas Boin, who announced the discovery at an Archaeological Society of America meeting in early 2024, the temple dates to Constantine&#x27;s period and marks the transition of the Roman Empire to Christianity.

In the plain, near San Claudio, are the remains of a semi-excavated Roman amphitheater; and a small valley to the east of the town is remarkable for its traces of Roman centuriation.

Beyond the town proper, the &quot;comune&quot;&#x27;s chief monuments are the church of &quot;San Silvestro&quot; at Collepino, and the church of the &quot;Madonna della Spella&quot; with late-medieval votive frescoes and graffiti.

==Festivals==
*The &quot;Infiorate&quot; include a whole night of work to create over sixty flower carpets on the Corpus Domini feast.

==Twin towns==
* Alfonsine, Italy, since 1974

Since 2008 Spello has also a pact of friendship with Accadia, Italy.

<text>The California Raisins were a fictional rhythm and blues animated musical group as well as advertising and merchandising characters composed of anthropomorphized raisins. Lead vocals were sung by musician Buddy Miles. The California Raisins were popular from 1986 to 1994 through claymation TV commercials and animated specials, winning an Emmy Award and one nomination.

==History==
The concept was created by advertising firm Foote, Cone &amp; Belding (FCB) for a 1986 Sun-Maid commercial on behalf of the California Raisin Advisory Board when one of the writers, Seth Werner (at the time with FCB in San Francisco) came up with an idea for the new raisin commercial, saying, &quot;We have tried everything but dancing raisins singing &#x27;I Heard It Through the Grapevine&#x27;&quot; (the 1968 song popularized separately by Marvin Gaye, Gladys Knight and the Pips and Creedence Clearwater Revival). To their surprise, the commercial became wildly popular, paving the way for several future commercials and opportunities through other media. The commercials were produced by Vinton Studios using their claymation technique, with character designs by Michael Brunsfeld. The following year, the Raisins appeared in the Emmy Award-winning &quot;A Claymation Christmas Celebration&quot;, singing the Christmas carol &quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot;.

The California Raisins released four studio albums in 1987 and 1988, and their signature song, &quot;I Heard It Through the Grapevine&quot;, landed on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and peaked at number 84. For three of the four albums the group issued, they were a consistent vocal group, with Buddy Miles handling most of the lead vocals; Ellis Hall and Niki Haris sang occasional leads, and backing vocals were by Howard McCrary, Howard Smith, and Leslie Smith. (One album, &quot;Meet The Raisins!&quot;, featured completely different vocal performers.) However, the Raisins would continue to make their strongest impression through animated endeavors, and the characters proved popular enough that they were used to endorse Post Raisin Bran cereal.

On November 4, 1988, CBS aired a primetime television special called &quot;Meet the Raisins!&quot; The musical mockumentary was again created by Vinton Studios, and was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award. It also gave the band members individual names and roles: A.C. (vocals), Beebop (drums), Stretch (bass), and Red (guitar/piano).

A Saturday morning cartoon series, &quot;The California Raisin Show&quot;, debuted the following year, but lasted only 13 episodes. While cel animated by Murakami-Wolf-Swenson, it maintained Will Vinton&#x27;s creative direction. A sequel to the original CBS special aired in 1990 under the title &quot;The Raisins: Sold Out! - The California Raisins II&quot;. This special saw the Raisins hiring a new manager with the goal of making a comeback before &quot;The California Raisins 2000&quot;.

The Raisins were initially discontinued July 31, 1994, with the collapse of the California Raisin Advisory Board; members of the grape farming industry were growing alarmed at the increased fees, driven by an ever-escalating amount of money being spent on the California Raisins campaign. The structure of the campaign had resulted in all of the profits from the campaign being funneled back to Foote, Cone &amp; Belding for more commercials and merchandise, creating a vicious cycle. Following the closure, the Raisins trademarks and copyrights became property of the state of California, who beginning in 1998 licensed them to a newly formed successor organization, the California Raisin Marketing Board.

==Merchandise==
Many of the items created for the campaign have become part of the permanent collection of the Smithsonian Institution. Merchandise sales included toys and Raisins images on nearly every conceivable medium: lunch boxes, notebooks, clothing, posters, bedsheets, and even a Halloween costume, just to name a few. A California Raisins Fan Club began in 1987, which included a &quot;Grapevine Gazette&quot; newsletter and various memorabilia. Blackthorne Publishing also released a six-issue comic book series entitled &quot;The California Raisins 3-D&quot; which included 3D glasses; these would later be re-released in the &quot;Ultimate Collection&quot; trade paperback.

Several California Raisins music albums were also released, featuring classic Motown and rock standards. These albums were included in the Smithsonian collection and were illustrated and art-directed by Helane Freeman, who later became famous for her work on &quot;Hannah Montana&quot; and &quot;The Suite Life of Zack &amp; Cody&quot;, among other Disney programs.

Perhaps the most memorable piece of California Raisins merchandise, however, came in the form of small, non-poseable California Raisins figures. The Hardee&#x27;s restaurant chain offered these as part of a promotion for its Cinnamon &#x27;N&#x27; Raisin biscuits. Different collections were produced in 1987, 1988, 1991, and finally in 2001 (the latter adding Carl&#x27;s Jr. due to their late &#x27;90s acquisition of Hardee&#x27;s) for their new stylization. This latest incarnation can still be seen on the California Raisin Marketing Board website.

In the early 1990s, Capcom produced a video game for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) titled &quot;The California Raisins: The Grape Escape&quot;, in which the player controlled a California Raisin through five side-scrolling levels battling various evil fruit and vegetable characters that have stolen the Raisins&#x27; music. The game was completed and several video game critics reviewed it, but it was never released on the open market.

Box Office Software produced a different, unrelated California Raisins computer game in 1988 for the Apple II, Commodore 64, and PC compatibles. The plot of the game involved Tiny Goodbite having to rescue his friends who have been kidnapped and held in a cereal factory.

==Post-popularity and legacy==
On March 28, 1997, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; published &quot;The 50 Best Commercials of All Time&quot; as its cover story. The article ranked The California Raisins&#x27; premiere advertisement, &quot;Lunchbox&quot;, at #15 with comments by ad agency executive Claude Jacques and described the Raisins as &quot;The coolest wrinkled musicians this side of the Stones.&quot;

The vast amount of California Raisins merchandise has made for a substantial collectors&#x27; market. It even led to an unauthorized collectibles guide published in 1998, cataloging the many items based on the clay characters.

In 2002, the Food Network program &quot;Unwrapped&quot; featured a segment on The California Raisins featuring interviews with Will Vinton, David Altschul, and Mark Gustafson of Vinton Studios. Concept illustrations of the Raisins were also featured as interviewees discussed the characters&#x27; creation.

An article published by AnimateClay.com in the late 2000s details the whereabouts of the original claymation sculptures used by Vinton Studios. The figures were kept in a box for several years and headed for the trash before being obtained by Webster Colcord, a former employee of Vinton. Several photos were taken providing a close look at the Raisins&#x27; internal armatures and detailing their extremely poor condition, including the absence of the A.C. puppet&#x27;s head.

In 2015, it was announced that a live-action/CGI reboot of the California Raisins would be produced, with president of The Actors Hall of Fame Foundation, Rusty Citron, as one of the people behind the project.

<text>Chef Boyardee is an American brand of canned pasta products sold internationally by Conagra Brands. The company was founded by Italian immigrant Ettore Boiardi in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1928.

==History==

After leaving his position as head chef at the Plaza Hotel in New York City, Ettore Boiardi opened a restaurant called Il Giardino d&#x27;Italia (&quot;The Garden of Italy&quot;) in 1924 at East 9th Street and Woodland Avenue in Cleveland, Ohio. The idea for Chef Boiardi came about when restaurant customers began asking Boiardi for his spaghetti sauce, which he began to distribute in milk bottles. In 1928, Boiardi met Maurice and Eva Weiner, who were patrons of his restaurant and owners of a local self-service grocery store chain. The Weiners helped the Boiardi brothers develop a process for canning the food at scale in Cleveland. They also procured distribution across the United States through their grocery&#x27;s wholesale partners. He decided to anglicize the name of his product to &quot;Boy-Ar-Dee&quot; to help Americans pronounce his name correctly. The first product to be sold was a &quot;ready-to-heat spaghetti kit&quot; in 1928. The kit included uncooked pasta, tomato sauce, and a container of grated cheese. By 1938, the company had outgrown its Ohio facility, and production was moved to Milton, Pennsylvania, where they could grow their own mushrooms and there was a ready supply of tomatoes.
The U.S. military commissioned the company during World War II for the production of army rations, requiring the factory to run 24 hours a day. At its peak, the company employed approximately 5,000 workers and produced 250,000 cans per day. After the war, production was scaled down and many of the wartime hires became expendable. Rather than lay them off, he sold the company to American Home Foods in 1946 for nearly $6 million. Boiardi remained as a spokesman and consultant for the brand until 1978. American Home Foods turned its food division into International Home Foods in 1996. Four years later, International Home Foods was purchased by ConAgra Foods, which continues to produce Chef Boyardee canned pastas bearing Boiardi&#x27;s likeness.

==Advertising==
Chef Boyardee is one of the few brands to request to be removed from an episode of &quot;Seinfeld&quot;. In the 1996 episode &quot;The Rye&quot;, Kramer is allowed to operate a Hansom cab for a week, and feeds the horse excess cans of Beefaroni, which causes frequent and foul smelling flatulence. As a result of the request, the name was changed to &quot;Beef-a-reeno&quot;.

In 2005, Chef Boyardee was shown in MasterCard&#x27;s &quot;Icons&quot; commercial during Super Bowl XXXIX, which depicts advertising mascots having dinner together.

In 2018, Barbara Lippert of &quot;Advertising Age&quot; compared the 1966 Young &amp; Rubicam ad for Beefaroni to &quot;The 400 Blows&quot; and running of the bulls. The ad features a large group of children running through Venice singing, &quot;Hooray...for Beefaroni!&quot; Lippert believed the ad influenced other famous commercials such as Prince Spaghetti (known for &quot;Anthony! Anthony!&quot;) and &quot;Hilltop&quot; for Coca-Cola.

<text>was an admiral in the Imperial Japanese Navy in World War II who went on to become an accountant and a namesake of the global auditing firm Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, today the world&#x27;s largest professional services company.

== Biography ==
Born in Tomioka city, Gunma Prefecture, Tohmatsu graduated from the 6th class of the Imperial Japanese Naval Paymaster Academy in 1917. He was ranked 4th out of a class of 21 cadets. As a midshipman, he served on the battleship &quot;Fusō&quot; and cruiser &quot;Asama&quot;. Once commissioned as an ensign, he was assigned to the battleship &quot;Hyūga&quot; and cruisers &quot;Izumo&quot;, and &quot;Mogami&quot;, followed by &quot;Shiretoko&quot;.

In 1922, he left maritime duty to take up a paymaster position at Sasebo Naval Arsenal; he later (as lieutenant commander) served as an ordnance accountant in both the Shipbuilding and Naval Air Commands. In 1934, he was designated naval attaché to the United Kingdom, where he served until 1936. While in London, he had the honor of being invited to King George V&#x27;s silver wedding anniversary at Buckingham Palace.

During World War II, Tohmatsu achieved the rank of captain and served as chief of several bureaus in the Navy, including the Bureau of Supply and Bureau of Accounting. He was also briefly a member of the Bureau of Naval Affairs. In May 1945, he became a rear admiral: following Japan&#x27;s surrender later that year, he assisted Allied occupation officials in accounting for and removing ordnance supplies throughout the country. He resigned from the Navy in August 1946.

Tohmatsu became a certified public accountant in 1952 and joined a Western-owned accounting firm in Tokyo, during an era when locally owned Japanese businesses were still small. Tōmatsu became well-known, partly due to the large number of Japanese accountants who had studied under him during the 1930s and 1940s. He became president of the Japanese CPA Association in 1967.

Around that time, the Japanese government began an initiative to establish subsidized domestic accounting firms. Tohmatsu seized the opportunity and joined accountant Iwao Tomita, one of his former students who had gone on to attend the Wharton School, to form the firm of Tohmatsu &amp; Co. in 1968. Tohmatsu grew along with Japan&#x27;s economy, and by Tohmatsu&#x27;s death in 1980 it had become one of the world&#x27;s largest auditors. In 1975, it merged into Touche Ross, which later became Deloitte &amp; Touche in 1990, and Tōmatsu&#x27;s name was appended in 1995 to change the name of the firm to “Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu”.

<text>MechAssault is a video game released for the Xbox notable for being one of the first games to support Xbox Live online multiplayer. Developed by Day 1 Studios and FASA Studio and published by Microsoft, &quot;MechAssault&quot; was initiated when Denny Thorley of Day 1 Studios approached Jon Kimmich of Microsoft about developing an original BattleTech game built from the ground up to support console play. &quot;MechAssault&quot; was released in November 2002. A sequel, &quot;MechAssault 2: Lone Wolf&quot;, was released on December 28, 2004. Both games are set in the BattleTech fictional universe.

==Plot==
&quot;MechAssault&quot; takes place in the BattleTech universe, a science-fiction universe that often revolves around pitched battles between human-piloted walking, heavily armed and armored machines, called BattleMechs. The plot of the game centers on an inhabited planet called Helios in the dominion of the Inner Sphere, a powerful coalition of feuding factions in control of large areas of space. The player is a BattleMech pilot (referred to throughout the game as simply &quot;Captain&quot; or, &quot;MechWarrior&quot;) in the employment of an elite mercenary organization called Wolf&#x27;s Dragoons. The player&#x27;s ship is hired to investigate the cessation of communications from the planet Helios. The Dragoons&#x27; ship, the &quot;Icarus&quot; arrives at the planet and is shot down upon entering the atmosphere, causing the ship to crash-land on the surface of Helios. It is later discovered by the player that a rogue technology-worshipping cult known as the Word of Blake has invaded and conquered Helios, and is under the rule of an iron-fisted fanatic called Commander Strader. The game follows the player as, commanded by elite officer Major Natalia and assisted by inept techie Lieutenant Foster, they fight the military forces of the cult, assist in the liberation of the planet from Word of Blake rule, and assassinate Commander Strader.

==Multiplayer==
&quot;MechAssault&quot; was one of the first games on the Xbox to feature the ability to be played on the Xbox Live service. &quot;MechAssault&quot; included many of the basic Live services that are now considered standard on any Live-enabled video game. These features included options for finding and creating online matches, such as the common &quot;Quick Match&quot;, which enables a player to find an online match quickly regardless of qualifications. For players who wanted to join a specific type of online session of &quot;MechAssault&quot; hosted by another player, &quot;Optimatch&quot; allowed the player to specify the criteria for the session they want to join. The player could also create and host an online session of &quot;MechAssault&quot;. Once the player defined all the characteristics of a game, they could invite other players from their friends list or leave slots open for any online player to join the battle. Online modes were available via Xbox Live until April 15, 2010. &quot;Mechassault&quot; is now playable online again on the replacement Xbox Live servers called Insignia.

&quot;MechAssault&quot; had several modes of combat in which players could engage, often based around by-now-common forms of online competitive gaming. In &quot;Grinder&quot; mode (local play only), the player tries to survive as more and more &#x27;Mechs are spawned into the battle. This mode can be played with one or two players. In &quot;Destruction&quot; mode, the player can choose a &#x27;Mech and fight to the death in deathmatch or team deathmatch. The player or team with the most kills wins. &quot;Last Man Standing&quot; is a free-for-all with no respawning as a mech. Once a player dies, they respawn as an unarmed infantryman. Gameplay can be either deathmatch or team deathmatch. &quot;Capture the flag&quot; is a team based game where the opposing team spawn on opposite ends of the map and try to &quot;Capture&quot; the enemy flag without giving up their own.

A fairly common metagame during the height of online popularity was known as &quot;Elemental&quot;. A Last Man Standing match, &quot;Elemental&quot; saw only one player choose a Mech while all others chose the Elemental mobile armor, a much smaller and weaker playable class. This was decided by players in voice chat prior to the start of the game. It was later released as an official game type known as &quot;Giant Killers&quot;.

==Reception==
The game received &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot; according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Jeff Gerstmann of &quot;GameSpot&quot; said, &quot;If you&#x27;re going to buy one game with your Xbox Live starter kit, &quot;MechAssault&quot; is the one to get.&quot; In Japan, where the game was ported for release on June 12, 2003, &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave it a score of all four sevens for a total of 28 out of 40. &quot;GamePro&quot; called it &quot;a blitzkrieg of metal-mauling combat and strategy, purely for stick jockeys. It&#x27;s no sim, but it&#x27;s not simple either.&quot;

&quot;GameSpot&quot; named it the best Xbox game of November 2002, and later presented it with the annual awards for &quot;Best Online Game on Xbox&quot;, &quot;Best Shooter on Xbox&quot;, and overall &quot;Game of the Year on Xbox&quot;. It was a runner-up in the publication&#x27;s &quot;Best Sound&quot; and &quot;Best Graphics (Technical)&quot; categories. The game won the awards for &quot;Best Online Xbox Game&quot; and &quot;Best Online Console Game&quot; at &quot;The Electric Playground&quot;″s 2002 Blister Awards, and was nominated for &quot;Best Graphics in a Console Game&quot;, &quot;Best Console Shooter&quot; and &quot;Xbox Game of the Year&quot;, but lost to &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Splinter Cell&quot; (Graphics, Xbox Game of the Year) and &quot;Metroid Prime&quot;, respectively.

By July 2006, the game had sold 750,000 units and earned $26 million in the U.S. &quot;NextGen&quot; ranked it as the 85th highest-selling game launched for the PlayStation 2, Xbox or GameCube between October 2000 and July 2006 in that country. Combined sales of the &quot;MechAssault&quot; series reached 1.1 million units.

==Attractions==
* The town&#x27;s most prominent feature is a thermometer, dubbed &quot;the world&#x27;s tallest thermometer&quot;. Its height commemorates the hottest temperature ever recorded on Earth, , in nearby Death Valley on July 10, 1913. It was created by Willis Herron, who owned many businesses in Baker and, at one point, was said to have employed half of Baker&#x27;s population. Hoping to draw more visitors into Baker, Herron partnered with Young Electric Sign Co. in 1991 to build the monument. It originally cost $750,000 to build and was blown over by high winds before it was officially lit. It was quickly rebuilt with a sturdier design. In 2005, Herron sold several of his businesses to Matt Pike in 2005 before passing away in 2007. Visible for miles, Pike temporarily stopped its operation in 2012 due to expensive electric bills of $8,000/month and inaccurate temperature readings. When Herron&#x27;s widow Barbara learned that the beloved landmark was being considered for demolition, she repurchased and refurbished it. The thermometer was relighted following restoration on July 10, 2014. 
** The thermometer was featured on the television show &quot;Strange Inheritance&quot; season 1 episode 13 on the Fox Business Network.
* Alien Fresh Jerky, a quirky store selling various types of jerky and alien-themed merchandise. The store is itself a tourist attraction with statues of aliens and architecture resembling galactic ships. Billboards on I-15 commonly feature the store. In 2020, the store came under fire for controversial racist remarks against Asians. 
* Abandoned structures, such as the tiki-inspired Arnie&#x27;s Royal Hawaiian Motel (opened in 1957, closed in 2009, formerly known as Grace&#x27;s Oasis) and Bun Boy Restaurant and Motel (opened in 1926, closed in 2013), are popular amongst urban explorers. 
* Dumont Dunes Off-Highway Vehicle Area, a popular area for ATV riders.
* Just a few miles to the west along I-15 lies the exit for Zzyzx Road. This dirt road leads to Soda Springs, the site of the health resort established by Curtis Springer in the late 1940s and now the Desert Study Center maintained by the California State University.
* A yearly race is held called &quot;The Challenge Cup Relay: Baker to Vegas&quot; or commonly referred as &quot;Baker to Vegas&quot; where law enforcement do a relay running race from Baker, CA to Las Vegas, NV. It attracts law enforcement agencies including LAPD, national, and international agencies to participate annually.

==In popular culture==

* In the video game &quot;&quot;, the fictional town of Novac is located in the Mojave desert near the real-world location of Baker, and features as a main attraction the world&#x27;s second-largest thermometer.
* The second season of the &quot;Fallout&quot; TV series utilized Baker as a filming location for scenes set in Novac.

<doc id="1032688" wikidata="Q5439384" url="?curid=1032688" title="Fear of a Black Hat">
<text>Fear of a Black Hat is a 1993 American mockumentary film on the evolution and state of American hip hop music. Written and directed by Rusty Cundieff in his directorial debut, the film stars Cundieff, Larry B. Scott and Mark Christopher Lawrence. &quot;Fear of a Black Hat&quot; is similar in format to the satirical film about early 1980s heavy metal, &quot;This is Spinal Tap&quot;. It is told from the point of view of a graduate student who is documenting the hip hop group N.W.H. (which stands for &quot;Niggaz With Hats&quot;, a reference to N.W.A.) for a year as part of her thesis.

The title is derived from the 1990 Public Enemy album &quot;Fear of a Black Planet&quot;. The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 24, 1993, and was later theatrically released on June 3, 1994. While critically acclaimed, it was a box office bomb. Its stature has grown in the years since its release and the film has acquired a cult following.

==Plot==
Nina Blackburn, a sociologist who analyzes hip hop as a form of communication, chooses to make a documentary on the hardcore gangsta rap group called N.W.H. (&quot;Niggaz With Hats&quot;) for her graduate thesis. The N.W.H. members are Ice Cold, the main rapper and the intelligent and vulgar backbone of the group; Tasty Taste, the ultra-violent secondary rapper who always seems to be armed with a variety of dangerous assault weaponry; and Tone Def, an esoteric DJ who is talented enough to scratch with his buttocks and his penis (the latter is not shown directly, but humorously implied).

As Nina documents N.W.H. for a year, she becomes familiar with the band members, their beliefs, and their often strange behavior. The members wear outrageous headwear during their performances, because according to N.W.H., hats are a symbol of resistance and revolution since their hatless slave ancestors were too tired from working all day in the sun to revolt. This is a typical example of the bizarre logic the group uses to explain the deeper meanings behind their otherwise crude and base music and images.

A running joke is N.W.H.&#x27;s use of over-the-top graphic language (e.g. sex, violence and rantings against the police), which their detractors see as a cheap means to sell records, but in their eyes is essential to conveying a &quot;socially relevant message&quot;. They offer jaw-dropping explanations on why songs such as &quot;Booty Juice&quot; and &quot;Come and Pet the P.U.S.S.Y.&quot; are in fact deep and socially significant, and that critics obviously do not truly understand the &quot;real meaning&quot;. Throughout the movie, it is difficult to tell if the members of N.W.H. truly believe what they are saying, or are just portraying an image.

A lot of time also goes into describing N.W.H.&#x27;s feud with another rap group, the Jam Boys. The groups constantly insult and discredit each other, sometimes resulting in the brandishing of weapons. At one point, N.W.H. brings to light evidence that the Jam Boys&#x27; lead rapper attended a prep school, directly threatening his street credibility. A macabre running gag involves their white managers dying under mysterious circumstances (the group originally insist that they &quot;wasn&#x27;t in town when the shit happened&quot;). They explain to Nina that their first few managers were black—in fact, were their relatives—and that they decided switching to white managers would be better for their families and the black community.

N.W.H.&#x27;s internal matters turn sour when Ice Cold wants to break away from the group because of his desire to participate in a film, and Cheryl C., a groupie, hooks up with Tasty-Taste. Although she is clearly more interested in his money than in him, Tasty lets her take over his life. When Tasty finds Cheryl and Ice Cold in bed, the group has an argument that leads to the dissolution of N.W.H., with each member launching a solo career. Ice dedicates himself to house music; Tasty makes a in which he curses Ice; and Tone Def becomes a hippie (with obvious references to &quot;flower rappers&quot;, such as P.M. Dawn). None of the guys sees much success until they ultimately reunite for a triumphant comeback in which their differences have been set aside, at least for the time being.

==Cast==
==Characters==
Along with the film&#x27;s title and its central characters, there are other characters seen briefly who are parodies of real-life prominent figures in hip-hop:

* Jike Spingleton: a portmanteau of filmmakers John Singleton and Spike Lee (the character criticizes both filmmakers for &quot;stealing&quot; his look and cinematic styles)
* M.C. Slammer: M.C. Hammer
* Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme: Salt-N-Pepa
* Vanilla Sherbet: Vanilla Ice
* Yo Highness: Queen Latifah
* Ice Tray, Ice Box, Ice Coffee, Ice Berg, etc.: variations of the name &quot;Ice&quot; and the overuse of it in general in the rap industry. 
* The Jam Boys: The Fat Boys
* Marty Rabinow: N.W.H.&#x27;s manager; his name is similar to Rainbow, which is a joke on Jewish names containing colors (e.g. Goldman, Goldberg, Greenberg, Silverberg); he is also a parody of stereotypical Jewish managers of African-American performers, such as N.W.A&#x27;s manager Jerry Heller. Rabinow is portrayed as a decent man whom N.W.H. likes and who provides them with sound, honest management. However, like those who preceded him, Marty dies—as a result of a self-inflicted gunshot under very bizarre comedic circumstances.

==Music==

===Songs===
* &quot;Booty Juice&quot;: The song&#x27;s video spoofs the prototypical hip hop &quot;pool scene&quot; found in many videos, with N.W.H. surrounded by a bevy of scantily clad girls.
* &quot;Come and Pet the P.U.S.S.Y.&quot;: A solo track from Ice Cold&#x27;s post-N.W.H. group, The Ice Plant. It is based on &quot;Everybody Dance Now&quot; by C&amp;C Music Factory. The main joke is that a petite Asian girl lip-syncs the powerful voice of a heavy-set African-American woman without the latter getting credit for it, a reference to the conflict Martha Wash had with C&amp;CMF in the track &quot;Everybody Dance Now&quot;.
* &quot;Fuck the Security Guards&quot;: A send-up of &quot;Fuck Tha Police&quot; by N.W.A.
* &quot;A Gangsta&#x27;s Life Ain&#x27;t Fun&quot;: Based on &quot;New Jack Hustler (Nino&#x27;s Theme)&quot; by Ice-T, spoofing its thinly-veiled admiration for sex, crime, and drugs. This is also mirrored in the title, because the video implies that a gangsta&#x27;s life &quot;is&quot; fun. The song is not found on the soundtrack album, as the &quot;Gangsta&#x27;s Life&quot; segment was only inserted into the VHS and DVD releases of the film. 
* &quot;Guerillas in the Midst&quot;: Based on &quot;Guerillas in tha Mist&quot; by Da Lench Mob, the song&#x27;s backdrop is centered on the 1992 Los Angeles riots.
* &quot;Grab Yo Stuff&quot;: The episode draws upon the 1990 arrest of three members of 2 Live Crew in Broward County, Florida for performing songs from their album &quot;As Nasty as They Wanna Be&quot;; the group had been warned that performances of certain songs would lead to arrest. N.W.H. sacrifices its artistic integrity/gangsta attitude in order to avoid trouble, changing the song &quot;Grab Yo Dick&quot; into &quot;Grab Yo Stuff&quot; when police threaten to arrest N.W.H. The group is arrested after Ice Cold accidentally hits himself in the groin while on stage and blurts out &quot;My dick.&quot;
* &quot;Granny Said Kick Yo Ass&quot;: Tasty Taste&#x27;s solo single, based on &quot;Mama Said Knock You Out&quot; by LL Cool J.
* &quot;Ice Froggy Frog&quot;: A parody of &quot;Who Am I (What&#x27;s My Name)?&quot; by Snoop Dogg.
* &quot;I&#x27;m Just a Human&quot;: Performed by Tone Def&#x27;s post-N.W.H. group New Human Formantics, and based on &quot;Set Adrift on Memory Bliss&quot; by P.M. Dawn.
* &quot;Kill Whitey&quot;: Not actually played in the movie, but discussed with Nina Blackburn in an interview regarding N.W.H.&#x27;s highly controversial lyrics. The group explains that the title &quot;Kill Whitey&quot; does not actually refer to violence against whites, but instead is a reference to their former manager Whitey DeLuca, who allegedly scammed the band out of a sum of money. He later ended up dead, but the group &quot;wasn&#x27;t in town when the shit happened.&quot; Whitey DeLuca was not actually white, he was &quot;olive-complected&quot;, according to Ice Cold.
* &quot;My Peanuts&quot;&#x27;: An early Ice Cold solo song based on &quot;My Penis&quot; by Ice Cube and Dr. Dre, which itself is a parody of &quot;My Adidas&quot; by Run-D.M.C.
* &quot;Wear Yo Hat (Buried and Bald)&quot;: Based on Public Enemy songs such as &quot;Don&#x27;t Believe the Hype&quot; and &quot;Bring the Noise&quot;, with Ice Cold and Tasty Taste vocally mimicking Public Enemy&#x27;s Chuck D. and Flavor Flav.
* &quot;White Cops on Dope&quot;: Only available on the motion picture soundtrack and DVD bonus features. The song is a musical parody of the Tubes&#x27; &quot;White Punks on Dope&quot;, and is based on the trend of rappers working with rock bands (such as the Run-D.M.C./Aerosmith version of &quot;Walk This Way&quot;) in an effort to cross over to mainstream audiences. Ric Ocasek of the Cars is featured on the track.
* &quot;Santa Claus Is Coming&quot;: The only song title mentioned from the group&#x27;s Christmas album &quot;Ho Ho Hoe&#x27;s&quot;. It is intimated that the title is a sexual double entendre rather than a cover of &quot;Santa Claus Is Comin&#x27; to Town&quot;.

===Albums===
* &quot;P.U.S.S. Why?&quot;
* &quot;Straight Outta Da Butt&quot; - A parody of N.W.A&#x27;s &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot;
* &quot;Kill Whitey&quot;
* &quot;Garden Hoe&#x27;s&quot;
* &quot;Ho Ho Hoe&#x27;s&quot; - a Christmas album
* &quot;Guerillas in the Midst&quot; - A parody of Da Lench Mob&#x27;s &quot;Guerillas in tha Mist&quot;

==Release==
&quot;Fear of a Black Hat&quot; debuted at the 1993 Sundance Film Festival to strong critical reception. However, &quot;CB4&quot;, a film that similarly parodies the hip hop world and starred Chris Rock, was released in March of that year to moderate box office success. A deal to distribute &quot;Fear of a Black Hat&quot; fell through, delaying the film&#x27;s release. The film premiered in limited theatrical release on June 3, 1994, more than a year after its Sundance debut. Its worldwide box office take totaled $233,824, making the film a financial flop.

==Critical reception==
Despite the film&#x27;s poor box office performance, it was lauded by critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a rating of 83% based on 24 reviews, with an average rating of 6.9/10. On Metacritic, the film has a score of 62 out of 100 based on 20 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote:

Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film a B− grade, opining that although it &quot;never achieves the dizzying cinema verite swirl that made &quot;Spinal Tap&quot; such a timeless satire [...] Cundieff has what nearly every commentator on the rap scene has lacked: a first-class bull detector.&quot;

In a three-star review, Roger Ebert wrote the film &quot;is not as fearless and sharp-edged as it could be—but it provides a lot of laughs, and barbecues a few sacred cows.&quot; He added:

A decidedly more mixed review came from Peter Rainer of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, who wrote that &quot;the idea is so funny that for a long time the film coasts on our good will. But it should be funnier than it is. Writer-director Rusty Cundieff, who also stars, along with Larry B. Scott and Mark Christopher Lawrence, as one of the three members of the rap group N.W.H., has a loose-limbed comic sense, and there are hilarious bits poking through the tedium. What the movie lacks is any kind of smart, sociological sense. It&#x27;s a defanged spoof.&quot;

The film&#x27;s reputation has grown since its release, and it has gained a cult following. In August 2023, The Criterion Channel included &quot;Fear of a Black Hat&quot; as part of its film series celebrating 50 years of hip hop.

==Year-end lists==
* Honorable mention – Glenn Lovell, &quot;San Jose Mercury News&quot;
* Honorable mention – Howie Movshovitz, &quot;The Denver Post&quot;
* Honorable mention – Michael MacCambridge, &quot;Austin American-Statesman&quot;

<doc id="1032703" wikidata="Q5176236" url="?curid=1032703" title="Council House, Birmingham">
<text>Birmingham City Council House in Birmingham, England, is the home of Birmingham City Council, and thus the seat of local government for the city. It provides office accommodation for both employed council officers, including the Chief Executive, and elected council members, plus the council chamber, Lord Mayor&#x27;s Suite, committee rooms and a large and ornate banqueting suite, complete with minstrel&#x27;s gallery. The first-floor&#x27;s exterior balcony is used by visiting dignitaries and victorious sports teams, to address crowds assembled below. The Council House, which has its own postcode, B1 1BB, is located in Victoria Square in the city centre and is a Grade II* listed building.

The side of the building that faces Chamberlain Square is the entrance and façade of the Museum and Art Gallery, which is partly housed within the same building.

==History==
In 1852, Birmingham Town Council had inherited the old Public Office on Moor Street, from their predecessors the Street Commissioners, which the council used as their meeting place. It soon became apparent that this building dating from 1807 was not adequate for the needs of the growing town (which became a city in 1889) and that larger premises would be needed.
===Planning===
The land on which the Council House and adjacent Museum and Art Gallery are located was purchased in 1853. This land consisted of Ann Street which was home to properties such as the &quot;Cabinet of Curiosities&quot;, a clothes shop advertised as &quot;An exhibition for the curious observer of natural phenomena&quot;. The building had a clock tower topped with a flagpole. The top was castellated and the walls were whitewashed and adorned in advertisements and messages. The last tenants of the building were the Suffield family, ancestors of J. R. R. Tolkien.

The land was earmarked for development, however constant financial difficulties put all development on hold until 1871 when the council finally agreed to build offices on the site. A design competition was established and the council received 29 entries, which was disappointing in comparison to the 179 entries Sheffield and Birmingham received. However a decision was delayed by further financial difficulties. The council was then split over the Gothic entry by Martin &amp; Chamberlain and the classical entry by Yeoville Thomason.

===Construction and extensions===

Thomason&#x27;s design was chosen; his design featured a central section with a huge hexastyle Corinthian order porte-cochere carrying a balcony with an arch and tympanum high above, flanked by piers and columns which in turn carried a large carved pediment. However, amendments to the art gallery entrance and clock tower were made. The clock and tower are known locally as &quot;Big Brum&quot;. Construction commenced on the building in 1874 when the first stone was laid by the then mayor Joseph Chamberlain. The building was completed in 1879 and cost £163,000 (). A debate was held to decide the name of the building: the options were the Municipal Hall, Council House and Guildhall.

The Council House was extended almost immediately, in 1881–85. The architect was again Yeoville Thomason. This was a combined art gallery, museum, and the home of the corporation&#x27;s Gas Department, whose budget subsidised the building, as legislation limited the expenditure of ratepayers&#x27; taxes on the arts.

Above the main entrance, which faces Victoria Square, the tympanum contains a mosaic by Salviati Burke and Co. of Venice. Above that, the pediment shows Britannia receiving the manufacturers of Birmingham. Victoria Square itself was once occupied by Christ Church, a building which was demolished in 1899.

On 9 August 1902, the Council House, along with the Town Hall, was illuminated in celebration of the coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra.

The Council House was extended a second time in 1911–19 (by architects Ashley &amp; Newman) with a new block to the north and connected to the original building by an intricately designed archway (internally a corridor). The archway or bridge slightly resembles The Bridge of Sighs in Venice. The extension contains the Feeney Art Galleries.

==Architectural details==
== Memorials ==
Many memorials are housed within the Council House. Most are not available for viewing by the public except upon request. Memorials within the Council House are:

*To the citizens of Birmingham from the Belgian exiles during World War I.
*To the staff of the Board of Guardians who served and died in World War I.
*To Captain Ronald Wilkinson who died trying to defuse an IRA bomb in Edgbaston on 17 September 1973.
*To the staff of the City Treasurers who served in World War I and to the City Treasurers who served in World War II.
*To the staff of the Electric Supply Department who died during World War I.
*To the staff of the Public Works &amp; Town Planning Department Memorial who died in both world wars.
*To the staff of the Veterinary Department who died during World War I.
*To John Skirrow Wright, who died in the building.
*A Blue Plaque commemorating the five consecutive generations of the Martineau family who served as (Lord) Mayors

== Use in films ==
The foyer featured in the Cliff Richard film &quot;Take Me High&quot;, made to appear as a hotel lobby. The glass corridor, banqueting suite and other parts also doubled as a hotel in Stephen Poliakoff&#x27;s &quot;Dancing on the Edge&quot;.

In the centre of the military cemetery are the tombs of the unknown soldier and Marshal C. G. E. Mannerheim, commander-in-chief of the Finnish Defence Forces during World War II, and the sixth president of Finland (1944–1946). Other notable sections of the cemetery are the cemetery of the Finnish Guard, the Artist&#x27;s Hill and the Statesmen&#x27;s Grove. There are two Lutheran funerary chapels and a crematorium at the area.

&quot;Hietaniemi&quot; means &quot;sand cape&quot; and is a headland located centrally in Helsinki.

==Description==
The cemetery is partly located at a promontory, and partly directly adjacent to the Hietaniemi Beach.

The cemetery is a popular tourist attraction, especially amongst Finns visiting the graves of relatives fallen in wars or the graves of the many famous Finns buried there since the 1820s. 

Four other cemeteries are also located at the greater cemetery district of Hietaniemi: the Helsinki Jewish cemetery, the Helsinki Islamic cemetery, the Helsinki Orthodox cemetery and the cemetery of the St. Nicholas Orthodox Parish.

In the 2010s, it was confirmed that an extensive catacomb network was located beneath the Orthodox cemetery.

<doc id="1032714" wikidata="Q5455327" url="?curid=1032714" title="Fist of Fun">
<text>Fist of Fun was a British comedy show, initially a BBC Radio 1 series in 1993 and then a BBC2 television series in 1995. It was written by and starred the comedians Stewart Lee and Richard Herring. Each episode of &quot;Fist of Fun&quot; consisted of disparate sketches, stand-up comedy segments, dialogues, and situations.

It was broadcast at 9:00 p.m. on Tuesday nights and was popular but not a major ratings-winner. The second series was aired on Friday nights and although its ratings were relatively good, the show suffered from network interference and poor promotion. The show was not given a third series but Lee and Herring went on to create &quot;This Morning with Richard Not Judy&quot;, for BBC2.

Many other comedians who appeared in the series went on to fame themselves, including the actor Kevin Eldon, Peter Baynham, Ronni Ancona, Alistair McGowan, Al Murray, Ant &amp; Dec, John Thomson, Rebecca Front, Mel Giedroyc, Sue Perkins, Ben Moor and Sally Phillips.

* Simon Quinlank, a self-proclaimed &quot;Hobby Lion&quot; and &quot;King of All Hobbies&quot; and &quot;Duke of Hobby&quot;, played by the actor Kevin Eldon. In each episode, he presents a slot (filmed on camcorder by an unseen assistant) related to his latest invented hobby. He is known for his maniacal laughter, frequent cries of &quot;&quot;Answer&quot; me!&quot; and loathing for never-seen rival Neil Petark. He also has a fondness for &quot;weak lemon drink&quot;. The character reappeared in Lee and Herring&#x27;s later show &quot;This Morning with Richard Not Judy&quot;.
* &quot;Rod Hull&quot;, a recurring character who claims to be the genuine Rod Hull but is in fact an obvious fraud. He has an obsession with jelly (possibly the reason for his attempted imitation is a belief that the real Rod Hull would receive gifts of jelly), and has a false arm. He persistently claims that the false arm is real despite the fact that he has an actual real arm tucked inside his shirt. This climaxed with the impostor confronted by the real Rod Hull, making a guest appearance. This entire sketch appears to have been based on a real life incident where Kiss drummer Peter Criss confronted his own impostor on the Phil Donahue show. Also played by the actor Kevin Eldon.
* Peter, a 31-year-old Welsh virgin from Balham who provides lifestyle tips from his unique perspective, usually cheap (and revolting) alternatives to well known recipes. Played (and written) by Peter Baynham.

==DVD release==
The series was never released by the BBC on either VHS or DVD but in May 2011 Stewart Lee announced that the rights to the show had been purchased by independent distributor Go Faster Stripe with an eye to release. The first series was released in early December 2011 and the second series in November 2012 albeit with slight edits made for editorial reasons at the request of the BBC. This included material regarding Princess Diana and Morris Mitchener, whose parents attempted to sue the West Yorkshire playhouse after a production of Peter Pan scared the infant Mitchener. Ironically the material excised from the otherwise complete episodes is included as part of the unedited studio sessions presented elsewhere on the DVD set.

<doc id="1032733" wikidata="Q254979" url="?curid=1032733" title="Cinnamon roll">
<text>A cinnamon roll (also known as cinnamon bun, cinnamon swirl, cinnamon Danish and cinnamon snail) is a sweet roll commonly served in Northern Europe (mainly in Nordic countries, but also in Austria, Estonia, The Netherlands and Germany) and North America. In Denmark it is known as &quot;kanelsnegl&quot;, in Sweden it is called &quot;kanelbulle&quot;, in Norway it is known as &quot;kanelbolle&quot;, &quot;skillingsbolle&quot;, &quot;kanelsnurr&quot;, or &quot;kanel i svingene&quot;, in Finland it is known as &quot;korvapuusti&quot;, in Iceland it is known as &quot;kanilsnúður&quot;, and in Estonia it is known as &quot;kaneelirull&quot;. In Austria and Germany, it is called &quot;Zimtschnecke&quot;. In Slovakia and the Czech Republic, it is called &quot;škoricové slimáky&quot;/&quot;skořicoví šneci&quot; (meaning &#x27;cinnamon snails&#x27;).

==Pastry==

A cinnamon roll consists of a rolled sheet of yeast-leavened dough onto which a cinnamon and sugar mixture (and brown sugar, raisins or other ingredients in some cases) is sprinkled over a thin coat of butter. The dough is then rolled, cut into individual portions and baked. The deep fried version is cinnamon roll or cinnamon bun doughnut. Its main ingredients are flour, cinnamon, sugar, and butter, which provide a robust and sweet flavor. 

==Origins==
Roman spice traders introduced the Sri Lankan cinnamon spice to Europe.

The spice later began to be used in Swedish pastries, with the modern &quot;kanelbulle&quot; () being created after the first world war. Since 1999, October 4 has been promoted as Cinnamon Roll Day (&quot;Kanelbullens dag&quot;), a national theme day, acknowledged by a significant portion of the Swedish population. Swedish kanelbulle dough typically also contains cardamom (powder or buds), giving it a distinctive flavour.

The size of a cinnamon roll varies from place to place, but many vendors supply a smaller size about in diameter and a larger size about to a side. The larger variety can be found in Finland, called &quot;korvapuusti&quot; (, &quot;pulling someone&#x27;s ear for disciplining&quot;), where it can be up to in diameter and weigh up to .

Haga, a district in Gothenburg, Sweden, is well known for its very large cinnamon rolls. These cinnamon rolls are called &quot;hagabullar&quot; or &quot;Queen of the Kitchen&quot;. &quot;Hagabullar&quot; are usually or more in diameter and are, despite their size, not considered a communal roll.

==National variations==
The Swedish &quot;Butterkaka&quot; and Finnish &quot;bostonkakku&quot; (&quot;Boston cake&quot;) is a cake made by baking cinnamon rolls in a round cake pan instead of baking them separately, so that they stick together to form a large, round cake.

A German variety, which closely follows the form of the Scandinavian pastry, originating in Hamburg and its surroundings is the &quot;Franzbrötchen&quot;, a cinnamon pastry inspired by the non-cinnamon French croissant.

American cinnamon rolls are frequently large, baked in a pan and topped with icing (usually confectioners&#x27; sugar-based) and are sometimes fried, finished with glaze, and served as a variation of a raised donut. There are also regional combinations: in the American Midwest, especially Nebraska and Kansas, cinnamon rolls are commonly eaten with chili.

In Canada, they are known as cinnamon rolls or cinnamon buns. They are usually self-glazed and not iced, nor do they usually have raisins. They can have so much cinnamon that they are spicy and hot to the taste.

In Austria and Germany, they are widely available at supermarkets and bakeries. Along with Topfengolatsche, Buttercroissant and Faschingskrapfen they are a typical pastry to have with afternoon coffee.

In Slovakia, these pastries are usually shaped into small, round forms resembling beehives or wasps&#x27; nests. In the Czech Republic, they can also be found in a conical spiral shape. It is most often filled with cinnamon filling, or it may have nut, cocoa or vanilla pudding. Typical ingredients include wheat flour, milk, butter, sugar, eggs and yeast.

In Asian cultures, cinnamon rolls may be made using a yeast bread technique called tangzhong. The technique is closely associated with Japanese milk bread since it gives it a soft, feathery texture. By heating flour at exactly 65°C or 149°F, the starches within the flour will pre-gelatinize, causing it to thicken more than average. Tangzhong allows the starches to retain moisture for longer periods of time, resulting in a longer shelf life.

==Cinnamon roll traditions==
In Sweden and Finland, cinnamon rolls are traditionally enjoyed during a get-together, including the consumption of coffee and or baked goods. In Sweden, the get-together is known as a &quot;fika&quot;, typically held in the afternoon, by coworkers during a break, by friends or by family. National Cinnamon Bun Day (&quot;Kanelbullens dag&quot;) is observed on October 4 in Sweden and Finland.

In Denmark, cinnamon buns are especially popular on Wednesdays, where an extra large variant called the Wednesday snail is sold. This tradition was specially invented during the 1990s where the national football team usually played their games on Wednesdays.

In North America, it is commonly eaten for breakfast or dessert. When eaten for breakfast in the U.S., it may be served with cream cheese frosting.

Cinnamon buns are particularly popular during the Christmas season in both Slovakia and the Czech Republic. They form part of the traditional Christmas baking repertoire in many households, alongside other festive treats like vanilla crescents (vanilkové rožteky) and linzer cookies.

<doc id="1032750" wikidata="Q1416975" url="?curid=1032750" title="Pleasant Dreams">
<text>Pleasant Dreams is the sixth studio album by the American punk rock band Ramones, released on July 20, 1981, through Sire Records. While the band members wanted Steve Lillywhite to produce, Sire chose Graham Gouldman in an attempt to gain popularity through a well-known producer. The recording process brought about many conflicts between band members, most notably the strife between Joey Ramone and Johnny Ramone, due to Johnny starting a relationship with Joey&#x27;s girlfriend. There were also disputes about the overall direction of the album, with Johnny leaning towards hard rock and Joey towards pop punk. Ultimately, the album incorporated high production values and varying musical styles, straying from traditional punk rock on songs such as &quot;We Want the Airwaves&quot;, &quot;She&#x27;s a Sensation&quot; and &quot;Come On Now&quot;. It is the first Ramones album not to feature any cover songs.

Despite Sire&#x27;s efforts to broaden the band&#x27;s appeal by enlisting Gouldman to produce, the album was not commercially successful, peaking at No. 58 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and only charting outside of the US in Sweden. The album also met with mixed critical reception.

==Conception==
The writing process for &quot;Pleasant Dreams&quot; began in January 1981. With Sire Records management being insistent on allowing a celebrity record producer to work on the album, they hired Graham Gouldman—songwriter and musician for the British band 10cc—to produce the album. Prior to working with Gouldman, the Ramones had recorded demos for the album with audio engineer Ed Stasium, and while the band had intended for Steve Lillywhite to produce the album, this decision was rejected by Sire. The studio recording process began on March 30, 1981, and initiated several conflicts between band members. This tension was partially due to Dee Dee Ramone&#x27;s drug addiction, as well as Marky Ramone and Joey Ramone developing problems with alcohol, resulting in the frustration of Johnny Ramone. These conflicts and differences became evident in the songwriting as, for the first time on a Ramones album, each song was now credited to individual members rather than multiple members. However, Gouldman was unaware of these tensions during the recording of the album, describing the sessions as &quot;very punctual and professional&quot;.

The time period of recording was a high-point in musical style for both Joey and Johnny, though they directed their sound towards different styles of music: Joey&#x27;s inspiration from pop music became evident in his writing, while Johnny&#x27;s keenness of hard-rock guitar riffs are apparent in much of his performing on the album. Johnny thought that this did not result well for the band&#x27;s sound, saying: &quot;I knew going in that this was not going to be the type of album I wanted. It really could have used another two of three punk songs ... All I want to do is keep our fans happy and not sell out. I&#x27;m fighting within the band. They are trying to go lighter, looking for ways to be more commercial. I&#x27;m against the band for doing that.&quot; Joey countered by explaining: &quot;By &quot;Road to Ruin&quot; [and] &quot;End of the Century&quot;, I was doing the majority of the songwriting. I started feeling that the Ramones were faceless; there were no individual identities in the band.&quot; Joey went on to say that, while this method had worked well in the beginning of their career, it began to annoy him, since &quot;everything [he] wrote, the band would take credit for.&quot;

Even though he expressed dissatisfaction with the album, working with Graham Gouldman, Johnny admitted, &quot;was easy—he was always a gentleman. He changed a lot of the songs: &quot;Here&#x27;s a nice chord for the bridge, you should be playing a minor chord instead of a major chord,&quot; things like that.&quot; Gouldman also had ideas for vocal harmonies, guitar overdubs, and melodic basslines. If he suggested a guitar part, it had to sound like it came from Johnny, &quot;or he wouldn&#x27;t play it,&quot; Gouldman said. Gouldman also revealed that there were certain tracks he actually played guitar on. &quot;I&#x27;d show [Johnny] and he&#x27;d say, &quot;You play it,&quot; but I had to play very restrictive, nothing fancy at all.&quot; He went on to say that there wasn&#x27;t much work to do with the songs. &quot;We changed arrangements slightly, but it was basic stuff, like, &quot;Let&#x27;s put an end on this song rather than fade it, let&#x27;s double up on the chorus at the end.&quot; Dee Dee recalled that &quot;Graham really produced. He put something into the album, some harmony ideas.&quot; In a 2025 interview Gouldman stated that whilst the band (and Johnny in particular) disliked the album, &quot;they never said anything while we were recording and we got on well&quot;.

During early stages of the album&#x27;s development, Joey was dating Linda Daniele. After the album was released, however, Daniele left Joey and became Johnny&#x27;s girlfriend. Ramones&#x27; road manager Monte Melnick relates: &quot;Joey was devastated. It affected him deeply. Johnny knew it was bad and kept Linda totally hidden from that point on. She didn&#x27;t come to many shows and if she did he&#x27;d hide her in the back; she wouldn&#x27;t come backstage. He&#x27;d run out to meet her and leave as soon as they were done.&quot; While Johnny would eventually marry Linda, Joey held a strong grudge against them both, and, though they continued to perform and tour together, the two rarely talked to each other. Joey explained that Johnny had &quot;crossed the line&quot; once he started dating Daniele, and noted that &quot;he destroyed the relationship and the band right there&quot;. Johnny defended himself by stating that had Daniele not left Joey for him, &quot;he wouldn&#x27;t have even been talking about her and saying how much he loved her because he wouldn&#x27;t have been obsessed about it.&quot;

==Composition and lyrics==
The album opens with &quot;We Want the Airwaves&quot;, which has instrumentation that strays from traditional punk rock and more towards hard rock. Music journalist Chuck Eddy described the song as &quot;a sort of Black Sabbath punk rock&quot;. &quot;Record World&quot; described &quot;We Want the Airwaves&quot; as a &quot;brash rocker&quot; that &quot;[avoids] any subtlety.&quot; Though it was long rumored that the album&#x27;s third track, &quot;The KKK Took My Baby Away&quot;, was written about Johnny stealing Joey&#x27;s girlfriend, the song was reportedly written some time before Joey had found out about this. Joey&#x27;s brother Mickey Leigh relates: &quot;The fluky connection between Johnny and the KKK raised a specter that keeps friends and fans speculating to this day. At the time, though, it had to be an unusual situation for him being that, as often happens with song lyrics, his words now took on a whole new meaning.&quot; The following track, &quot;Don&#x27;t Go&quot;, was described in &quot;Musician, Player, and Listener&quot; as &quot;Spector-ish&quot;, likening the song&#x27;s production values to those of music producer Phil Spector, the infamous producer of the band&#x27;s previous record, &quot;End of the Century&quot;. According to the magazine, the lyrics detail &quot;an archivist&#x27;s sense of young love by the book and how innocent rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll is supposed to sound.&quot; Everett True, author of &quot;Hey Ho Let&#x27;s Go: The Story of the Ramones&quot; (2005), explains that the album&#x27;s fifth track, Dee Dee&#x27;s &quot;You Sound Like You&#x27;re Sick&quot;, &quot;returns to the bassist&#x27;s traditional institutionalised theme.&quot; Side A ends with &quot;It&#x27;s Not My Place (In the 9 to 5 World)&quot;, which was described by music critic David Fricke as &quot;driven home&quot; by drummer Marky&#x27;s &quot;feisty, Bo Diddley-style&quot; drum beat, noting that it borrows the middle eight (of thirty-two-bar form) from the Who song &quot;Whiskey Man&quot;.

Side B of the album begins with &quot;She&#x27;s a Sensation&quot;, which was said by author Dave Thompson to have a 1960s melody which &quot;melts through the hard rock&quot;. The next song, &quot;7-11&quot;, deals with dating at a young age, where the couple goes on dates to places like convenience stores and record swaps. The lyrics follow a boy who meets a girl by a Space Invaders arcade machine, who eventually has to let her go after she dies in a car crash. True relates: &quot;You can lose your heart within the singer&#x27;s torched &#x27;7-11&#x27;. Joey details in time-honoured girl group fashion the beauty of young love that takes place among the most mundane, humdrum of surroundings.&quot; &quot;You Didn&#x27;t Mean Anything to Me&quot;, written by Dee Dee, reflects the desolation and vacillation that the bassist was feeling in his personal life, as well as within the band. This is evident through lines like &quot;Every dinner was crummy/Even the ones for free.&quot; The pop-oriented song &quot;Come On Now&quot; was described by True as a &quot;sparkling rush of blood to the head from the &#x27;comic book boy&#x27;,&quot; with True adding that it was comparable to songs by The Dave Clark Five and 1910 Fruitgum Company. The eleventh track on the album, &quot;This Business Is Killing Me&quot;, was written by Joey about how everyone expects him to please others but how he simply cannot please everyone all the time. &quot;Pleasant Dreams&quot; concludes with &quot;Sitting in My Room&quot;, which David Fricke quoted in the conclusion of his review of the album, saying: &quot;&#x27;It&#x27;s us against them,&#x27; sneers Joey ... &#x27;They just wanna worry ... /They just wanna be so lame/Maybe they should try and sniff some glue.&#x27; Or put &quot;Pleasant Dreams&quot; on the box and crank it up to ten.&quot;

==Reception==
Released on July 20, 1981, the album was not commercially successful, failing to spawn a single hit. Though Sire Records had merged with Warner Bros. Records, none of the singles from &quot;Pleasant Dreams&quot; were released in the US. Sire had insisted that the album be produced by a celebrity producer, hiring Graham Gouldman to the job expecting this to help expand the band&#x27;s fan base. Joey relates: &quot;The record company told us the album would bomb if we didn&#x27;t use Graham Gouldman, so we worked with Graham--and the album bombed anyway.&quot; The album would only chart in the US and Sweden, peaking at 58 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and 35 on the Sverigetopplistan chart, with the singles released from the album failing to chart.

&quot;Pleasant Dreams&quot; received mixed reviews from critics, with many pointing out that the high quality sound production made the band stray from their roots even more so than the change in style. Stephen Thomas Erlewine, senior editor for AllMusic, noted that Gouldman steers the band&#x27;s style away from &quot;bubblegum, British invasion, and surf fetishes&quot; and toward &quot;acid rock and heavy metal&quot;. He went on to say that the sound quality was &quot;too clean to qualify as punk&quot; and that the music on the album had &quot;lost sight of the infectious qualities that made their earlier records such fun&quot;. The &quot;Spin Alternative Record Guide&quot; panned the &quot;halfhearted metal moves.&quot;

Music critic Robert Christgau said that the album &quot;comes off corny&quot; compared to the band&#x27;s first four releases, which he described as &quot;aural rush and conceptual punch&quot;. While he felt that the songs featured on the album were better than those on &quot;End of the Century&quot;, he claimed the album was &quot;less focused&quot; compared to &quot;Leave Home&quot;, but &quot;fun anyway&quot;. David Fricke of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; began his review by writing &quot;Pity the poor Ramones&quot;, and went on to give it a mixed review of four out of five stars. He stated that the Ramones are a “comic relief,” not shrinking away from real life. Fricke noted &quot;studio sleight of hand: fortified vocal harmonies, an occasional dash of keyboards, a certain production gimmickry. But the ironically titled Pleasant Dreams is actually the Ramones‘ state-of-the-union message, an impassioned display of irrepressible optimism and high-amp defiance laced with bitterness over what they see as corporate sabotage of their rock &amp; roll fantasies.“

&quot;The New York Times&quot; concluded that &quot;the Ramones have made a record that sounds like a New York version of the Beach Boys... The tempos are considerably faster, but so is life in the big city.&quot; &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; praised Gouldman&#x27;s &quot;intelligent, balanced production, in contrast with Phil Spector&#x27;s stultifying barrier of sound on the band&#x27;s last album.&quot;

<text>Little Round Top is the smaller of two rocky hills south of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania—the companion to the adjacent, taller hill named Big Round Top. It was the site of an unsuccessful assault by Confederate troops against the Union left flank on July 2, 1863, the second day of the Battle of Gettysburg, during the American Civil War.

Little Round Top was successfully defended by a brigade under Colonel Strong Vincent, who was mortally wounded during the fighting and died five days later. The 20th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment, commanded by Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, fought its most famous engagement there, culminating in a dramatic downhill bayonet charge. The battle at Little Round Top subsequently became one of the most well-known actions at Gettysburg, and of the entire war.

==Geography==

Little Round Top is a large diabase spur of Big Round Top with an oval crest that forms a short ridgeline with a summit of prominence above the saddle point to Big Round Top to the south. It is located in Cumberland Township, approximately two miles (3 km) south of Gettysburg, with a rugged, steep slope rising above nearby Plum Run to the west and strewn with large boulders. The summit is a total of above sea level. Historically, the western slope was generally free of vegetation, while the summit and eastern and southern slopes were lightly wooded. Directly to the south is Big Round Top, higher and densely wooded.

The igneous landform was created 200 million years ago when the &quot;outcrop of the Gettysburg sill&quot; intruded through the Triassic &quot;Gettysburg plain&quot;. Subsequent periglacial frost wedging during the Pleistocene formed the hill&#x27;s extensive boulders.

There is no evidence that the name &quot;Little Round Top&quot; was used by soldiers or civilians during the battle, although Col. Franklin A. Haskell, writing to his brother on July 16, 1863, calls it so. Although the larger hill was known before the battle as Round Top, Round Top Mountain, and sometimes Round Hill, accounts written in 1863 referred to the smaller hill with a variety of names: Rock Hill, High Knob, Sugar Loaf Hill, Broad Top Summit, and granite spur of Round Top. Historian John B. Bachelder, who had an enormous influence on the preservation of the Gettysburg battlefield, personally favored the name &quot;Weed&#x27;s Hill&quot;, in honor of Brigadier General Stephen H. Weed, who was mortally wounded on Little Round Top. Bachelder abandoned that name by 1873. One of the first public uses of &quot;Little Round Top&quot; was by Edward Everett in his oration at the dedication of the Soldiers&#x27; National Cemetery on November 19, 1863.

==Battle of Gettysburg==


On the second day of the Battle of Gettysburg, July 2, 1863, at about 4 PM, Confederate Lt. Gen. James Longstreet&#x27;s First Corps began an attack ordered by General Robert E. Lee that was intended to drive northeast up the Emmitsburg Road in the direction of Cemetery Hill, rolling up the Union left flank. Maj. Gen. John Bell Hood&#x27;s division was assigned to attack up the eastern side of the road, Maj. Gen. Lafayette McLaws&#x27;s division the western side. Hood&#x27;s division stepped off first, but instead of guiding on the road, elements began to swing directly to the east in the direction of the Round Tops. Instead of driving the entire division up the spine of Houck&#x27;s Ridge (the boulder-strewn area known to the soldiers as the Devil&#x27;s Den), parts of Hood&#x27;s division detoured over Round Top and approached the southern slope of Little Round Top.
There were four probable reasons for the deviation in the division&#x27;s direction: first, regiments from the Union III Corps were unexpectedly in the Devil&#x27;s Den area and they would threaten Hood&#x27;s right flank if they were not dealt with; second, fire from the 2nd U.S. Sharpshooters at Slyder&#x27;s farm drew the attention of lead elements of Brig. Gen. Evander M. Law&#x27;s brigade, moving in pursuit and drawing his brigade to the right; third, the terrain was rough and units naturally lost their parade-ground alignments; finally, Hood&#x27;s senior subordinate, General Law, was unaware that Hood had been wounded and he was now in command of the division, so he did not exercise control.

In the meantime, Little Round Top was undefended by Union troops. Maj. Gen. George Meade, commander of the Army of the Potomac, had ordered Maj. Gen. Daniel Sickles&#x27; III Corps to defend the southern end of Cemetery Ridge, which would have just included Little Round Top. Sickles, defying Meade&#x27;s orders, moved his corps a few hundred yards west to the Emmitsburg Road and the Peach Orchard. This caused a large salient in the line, which was also too long to defend properly. His left flank was anchored in Devil&#x27;s Den.

When Meade discovered this situation, he dispatched his chief engineer, Brig. Gen. Gouverneur K. Warren, to attempt to deal with the situation south of Sickles&#x27; position. Climbing Little Round Top, Warren found only a small Signal Corps station there. He saw the glint of bayonets in the sun to the southwest and realized that a Confederate assault into the Union flank was imminent. He hurriedly sent staff officers, including Washington Roebling, to find help from any available units in the vicinity.

The response to this request for help came from Maj. Gen. George Sykes, commander of the Union V Corps. Sykes quickly dispatched a messenger to order his 1st Division, commanded by Brig. Gen. James Barnes, to Little Round Top. Before the messenger could reach Barnes, he encountered Col. Strong Vincent, commander of the 3rd Brigade, who seized the initiative and directed his four regiments to Little Round Top without waiting for permission from Barnes. He and Oliver W. Norton, the brigade bugler, galloped ahead to reconnoiter and guide his four regiments into position.

Upon arrival on Little Round Top, Vincent and Norton received fire from Confederate batteries almost immediately. On the western slope, he placed the 16th Michigan, and then proceeding counterclockwise were the 44th New York, the 83rd Pennsylvania, and finally, at the end of the line on the southern slope, the 20th Maine. Arriving only ten minutes before the Confederates, Vincent ordered his brigade to take cover and wait, and he ordered Col. Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, commander of the 20th Maine, to hold his position, the extreme left of the Army of the Potomac, at all costs. Chamberlain and his 385 men waited for what was to come.

===Battle of Little Round Top===

The approaching Confederates were the Alabama Brigade of Hood&#x27;s Division, commanded by Brig. Gen. Evander M. Law. (As the battle progressed and Law realized he was in command of the division, Col. James L. Sheffield was eventually notified to assume brigade command.) Dispatching the 4th, 15th, and 47th Alabama, and the 4th and 5th Texas to Little Round Top, Law ordered his men to take the hill. The men were exhausted, having marched more than 20 miles (32 km) that day to reach this point. The day was hot and their canteens were empty; Law&#x27;s order to move out reached them before they could refill their water. Approaching the Union line on the crest of the hill, Law&#x27;s men were thrown back by the first Union volley and withdrew briefly to regroup. The 15th Alabama, commanded by Col. William C. Oates, repositioned further right and attempted to find the Union left flank.

The left flank consisted of the 386 officers and men of the 20th Maine regiment and the 83rd Pennsylvania. Seeing the Confederates shifting around his flank, Chamberlain first stretched his line to the point where his men were in a single-file line, then ordered the southernmost half of his line to swing back during a lull following another Confederate charge. It was there that they &quot;refused the line&quot;—formed an angle to the main line in an attempt to prevent the Confederate flanking maneuver. Despite heavy losses, the 20th Maine held through two subsequent charges by the 15th Alabama and other Confederate regiments for a total of ninety minutes.

Chamberlain (knowing that his men were out of ammunition, his numbers were being depleted, and his men would not be able to repulse another Confederate charge) ordered his men to equip bayonets and counterattack. He ordered his left flank, which had been pulled back, to advance in a &#x27;right-wheel forward&#x27; maneuver. As soon as they were in line with the rest of the regiment, the remainder of the regiment would charge akin to a door swinging shut. This simultaneous frontal assault and flanking maneuver halted and captured a good portion of the 15th Alabama. While Chamberlain ordered the advance, Lieutenant Holman Melcher spontaneously and separate to Chamberlain&#x27;s command initiated a charge from the center of the line that further aided the regiment&#x27;s efforts.
During their retreat, the Confederates were subjected to a volley of rifle fire from Company B of the 20th Maine, commanded by Captain Walter G. Morrill, and a few of the 2nd U.S. Sharpshooters, who had been placed by Chamberlain behind a stone wall 150 yards to the east, hoping to guard against an envelopment. This group, who had been hidden from sight, caused considerable confusion in the Confederate ranks.

Thirty years later, Chamberlain received a Medal of Honor for his conduct in the defense of Little Round Top. The citation read that it was awarded for &quot;daring heroism and great tenacity in holding his position on the Little Round Top against repeated assaults, and ordering the advance position on the Great Round Top.&quot;
Despite this victory, the rest of the Union regiments on the hill were in dire straits. While the Alabamians had pressed their attacks on the Union left, the 4th and 5th Texas were attacking Vincent&#x27;s 16th Michigan on the Union right. Rallying the crumbling regiment (the smallest in his brigade, with only 263 men) several times, Vincent was mortally wounded during one Texas charge and was succeeded by Colonel James C. Rice. Vincent died on July 7, but not before receiving a deathbed promotion to brigadier general.

Before the Michiganders could be demoralized, reinforcements summoned by Warren—who had continued on to find more troops to defend the hill—had arrived in the form of the 140th New York and a battery of four guns—Battery D, 5th U.S. Artillery, commanded by Lt. Charles E. Hazlett. (Simply maneuvering these guns by hand up the steep and rocky slope of the hill was an amazing achievement. However, this effort had little effect on the action of July 2. The artillerymen were exposed to constant sniper fire and could not work effectively. More significantly, however, they could not depress their barrels sufficiently to defend against incoming infantry attacks.)

The 140th charged into the fray, driving the Texans back and securing victory for the Union forces on the hill. Col. Patrick &quot;Paddy&quot; O&#x27;Rorke, who personally led his regiment in the charge, was killed. Reinforced further by Stephen Weed&#x27;s brigade of the V Corps, Union forces held the hill throughout the rest of the battle, enduring persistent fire from Confederate sharpshooters stationed around Devil&#x27;s Den. General Weed was among the victims, and as his old friend Charles Hazlett leaned over to comfort Weed, the artilleryman was also shot dead.

===Evening and July 3===

Later that day, Little Round Top was the site of constant skirmishing. It was fortified by Weed&#x27;s brigade, five regiments of the Pennsylvania Reserves, and an Ohio battery of six guns. Most of the stone breastworks that are currently visible on the hill were constructed by these troops after the fighting stopped. Troops of the II, V, VI, and XII Corps passed through the area and also occupied Round Top.

Little Round Top was the starting point for a Union counterattack at dusk on July 2, conducted by the 3rd Division of the V Corps (the Pennsylvania Reserves) under Brig. Gen. Samuel W. Crawford, launched to the west in the direction of the Wheatfield.

On July 3, Hazlett&#x27;s battery (six 10-pounder Parrott rifles, now under the command of Lt. Benjamin F. Rittenhouse) fired into the flank of the Confederate assault known as Pickett&#x27;s Charge. Near the end of that engagement, General Meade observed from Little Round Top and contemplated his options for a possible counterattack against Lee.

===Impact===
Of the 2,996 Union troops engaged at Little Round Top, there were 565 casualties (134 killed, 402 wounded, 29 missing); Confederate losses of 4,864 engaged were 1,185 (279 killed, 868 wounded, 219 missing).

While agreeing that the fighting on Little Round Top was extremely fierce and soldiers on both sides fought valiantly, historians disagree as to the impact of this particular engagement on the overall outcome of the Battle of Gettysburg. The traditional view—one that emerged in the 1880s—is that the left flank of the Union Army was a crucial position. An example of this view is from 1900: &quot;If the Confederates had seized [Little Round Top] and dragged some of their artillery up there, as they easily could have done, they would have enfiladed Meade&#x27;s entire line and made it too unhealthy for him to remain there.&quot;

An alternative claim is that the hill&#x27;s terrain offered a poor platform for artillery, and that had Longstreet secured the hill, the Union Army would have been forced back to a better defensive position, making the attack on the hill a distraction from the Confederates&#x27; true objective. This latter theory is supported by General Lee&#x27;s writings, in which he appears to have considered Little Round Top irrelevant. In Lee&#x27;s report after the Gettysburg Campaign, he stated in part, &quot;General Longstreet was delayed by a force occupying the high, rocky hills on the enemy&#x27;s extreme left, from which his troops could be attacked in reverse as they advanced&quot;, suggesting Longstreet was ordered on a course intended to bypass Little Round Top—had the hill been a key objective of the assault, Lee would not have used the phrase &quot;delayed by&quot; in describing the effects of the engagement.

Garry Adelman has countered the argument that a Confederate capture of Little Round Top would have badly hurt the Union effort. Examining the number of troops available in the vicinity in the late afternoon, he determined that at most 2,650 Confederates could have been available to defend the hill after capturing it, and that these men would have been exhausted from combat and short on ammunition. In contrast, 11,600 fresh Union reinforcements were available within a mile, primarily from Maj. Gen. John Sedgwick&#x27;s VI Corps. In addition, the value of Little Round Top as an artillery position has been overstated—the shape of the crest of the hill forces guns to be placed one behind the other, limiting their effectiveness when engaging targets directly to the north, such as the Union line on Cemetery Ridge.

While Chamberlain and the 20th Maine have gained popularity in the American national consciousness, other historical figures such as Strong Vincent, Patrick O&#x27;Rourke, and Charles Hazlett arguably played equal roles in the Union success at Little Round Top. Their deaths at the scene, however, did not allow their personal stories to be told.

==Postbellum history==
During visits by 13 generals in 1865, points were identified on Little Round Top at which markers were subsequently erected, and a observatory was built by 1886, before a stone monument with observation deck was dedicated to the 44th New York in 1892. In the late 1880s, the 20th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment monument on Little Round Top was dedicated with a speech by Joshua Chamberlain.

In 1935, two &quot;hairpin curves&quot; of the avenue on Little Round Top were removed by the Continental Contracting Company to create a &quot;by-pass, a stretch of .399 mile,&quot; from the Round Top Museum southward to north of the guard station on the south slope at Sykes Avenue and Chamberlain Avenue was subsequently closed. The summit parking lot was also created at this time.


==In popular culture==
The battle for Little Round Top is a key plot point of Ward Moore&#x27;s 1953 alternate history novel &quot;Bring the Jubilee&quot;. The 1974 novel &quot;The Killer Angels&quot;, and its 1993 film adaptation, &quot;Gettysburg&quot;, depicted a portion of this battle. Filmmaker Ken Burns praised Chamberlain in his PBS documentary &quot;The Civil War&quot; and in subsequent interviews for possibly saving the Union with his actions during the engagement.

In the 2016 song &quot;Ballad of the 20th of Maine&quot; by Maine folk group The Ghost of Paul Revere, the famous bayonet charge and Andrew Tozier&#x27;s defiant stand is chronicled:

<doc id="1032780" wikidata="Q1773974" url="?curid=1032780" title="Preventive healthcare">
<text>Preventive healthcare, or prophylaxis, is the application of healthcare measures to prevent diseases. Disease and disability are affected by environmental factors, genetic predisposition, disease agents, and lifestyle choices, and are dynamic processes that begin before individuals realize they are affected. Disease prevention relies on anticipatory actions that can be categorized as primal, primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention.

Each year, millions of people die of preventable causes. A 2004 study showed that about half of all deaths in the United States in 2000 were due to preventable behaviors and exposures. Leading causes included cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, unintentional injuries, diabetes, and certain infectious diseases. This same study estimates that 400,000 people die each year in the United States due to poor diet and a sedentary lifestyle. According to estimates made by the World Health Organization (WHO), about 55 million people died worldwide in 2011, and two-thirds of these died from non-communicable diseases, including cancer, diabetes, and chronic cardiovascular and lung diseases. This is an increase from the year 2000, during which 60% of deaths were attributed to these diseases.)

Preventive healthcare is especially important given the worldwide rise in the prevalence of chronic diseases and deaths from these diseases. There are many methods for prevention of disease. One of them is prevention of teenage smoking through information giving. It is recommended that adults and children aim to visit their doctor for regular check-ups, even if they feel healthy, to perform disease screening, identify risk factors for disease, discuss tips for a healthy and balanced lifestyle, stay up to date with immunizations and boosters, and maintain a good relationship with a healthcare provider. In pediatrics, some common examples of primary prevention are encouraging parents to turn down the temperature of their home water heater in order to avoid scalding burns, encouraging children to wear bicycle helmets, and suggesting that people use the air quality index (AQI) to check the level of pollution in the outside air before engaging in sporting activities. Some common disease screenings include checking for hypertension (high blood pressure), hyperglycemia (high blood sugar, a risk factor for diabetes mellitus), hypercholesterolemia (high blood cholesterol), screening for colon cancer, depression, HIV and other common types of sexually transmitted disease such as chlamydia, syphilis, and gonorrhea, mammography (to screen for breast cancer), colorectal cancer screening, a Pap test (to check for cervical cancer), and screening for osteoporosis. Genetic testing can also be performed to screen for mutations that cause genetic disorders or predisposition to certain diseases such as breast or ovarian cancer. However, these measures are not affordable for every individual and the cost effectiveness of preventive healthcare is still a topic of debate.
==Overview==
Preventive healthcare strategies are described as taking place at the primal, primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention levels.
Although advocated as preventive medicine in the early twentieth century by Sara Josephine Baker, in the 1940s, Hugh R. Leavell and E. Gurney Clark coined the term primary prevention. They worked at the Harvard and Columbia University Schools of Public Health, respectively, and later expanded the levels to include secondary and tertiary prevention. Goldston (1987) notes that these levels might be better described as &quot;prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation&quot;, although the terms primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention are still in use today. The concept of primal prevention has been created much more recently, in relation to the new developments in molecular biology over the last fifty years, more particularly in epigenetics, which point to the paramount importance of environmental conditions, both physical and affective, on the organism during its fetal and newborn life, or so-called primal period of life.

===Primal and primordial preventions===

Primal prevention is health promotion &quot;par excellence&quot;. New knowledge in molecular biology, in particular epigenetics, points to how much affective as well as physical environment during fetal and newborn life may determine adult health. This way of promoting health consists mainly in providing future parents with pertinent, unbiased information on primal health and supporting them during their child&#x27;s primal period of life (i.e., &quot;from conception to first anniversary&quot; according to definition by the Primal Health Research Centre, London). This includes adequate parental leave, ideally for both parents, with kin caregiving and financial help where needed.

Primordial prevention refers to all measures designed to prevent the development of risk factors in the first place, early in life, and even preconception, as Ruth A. Etzel has described it &quot;all population-level actions and measures that inhibit the emergence and establishment of adverse environmental, economic, and social conditions&quot;. This could be reducing air pollution or prohibiting endocrine-disrupting chemicals in food-handling equipment and food contact materials.

===Primary prevention===
Primary prevention consists of traditional health promotion and &quot;specific protection&quot;. Health promotion activities include prevention strategies such as health education and lifestyle medicine, and are current, non-clinical life choices such as eating nutritious meals and exercising often, that prevent lifestyle-related medical conditions, improve the quality of life, and create a sense of overall well-being. Preventing disease and creating overall well-being prolongs life expectancy. Health-promotional activities do not target a specific disease or condition but rather promote health and well-being on a very general level. On the other hand, specific protection targets a type or group of diseases and complements the goals of health promotion.

====Food====
Food is the most basic tool in preventive health care. Poor nutrition is linked to various chronic illnesses. Because of this, having a healthy diet and proper nutrition can be used to prevent illnesses.

===== Access =====
The 2011 National Health Interview Survey performed by the Centers for Disease Control was the first national survey to include questions about ability to pay for food. Difficulty with paying for food, medicine, or both is a problem facing 1 out of 3 Americans. If better food options were available through food banks, soup kitchens, and other resources for low-income people, obesity and the chronic conditions that come along with it would be better controlled. A food desert is an area with restricted access to healthy foods due to a lack of supermarkets within a reasonable distance. These are often low-income neighborhoods with the majority of residents lacking transportation. There have been several grassroots movements since 1995 to encourage urban gardening, using vacant lots to grow food cultivated by local residents. Mobile fresh markets are another resource for residents in a &quot;food desert&quot;, which are specially outfitted buses bringing affordable fresh fruits and vegetables to low-income neighborhoods.

===== Food education and guidance =====
It has been proposed that healthy longevity diets are included in standard healthcare as switching from a &quot;typical Western diet&quot; could often extend life by a decade.

==== Protective measures ====

Specific protective measures such as water purification, sewage treatment, and the development of personal hygienic routines, such as regular hand-washing, safe sex to prevent sexually transmitted infections, became mainstream upon the discovery of infectious disease agents and have decreased the rates of communicable diseases which are spread in unsanitary conditions.

Scientific advancements in genetics have contributed to the knowledge of hereditary diseases and have facilitated progress in specific protective measures in individuals who are carriers of a disease gene or have an increased predisposition to a specific disease. Genetic testing has allowed physicians to make quicker and more accurate diagnoses and has allowed for tailored treatments or personalized medicine.

Food safety has a significant impact on human health and food quality monitoring has increased.
Water, including drinking water, is also monitored in many cases for securing health. There also is some monitoring of air pollution. In many cases, environmental standards such as via maximum pollution levels, regulation of chemicals, occupational hygiene requirements or consumer protection regulations establish some protection in combination with the monitoring.

Preventive measures like vaccines and medical screenings are also important. Using PPE properly and getting the recommended vaccines and screenings can help decrease the spread of respiratory diseases, protecting the healthcare workers as well as their patients.

===Secondary prevention===
Secondary prevention deals with latent diseases and attempts to prevent an asymptomatic disease from progressing to symptomatic disease. Certain diseases can be classified as primary or secondary. This depends on definitions of what constitutes a disease, though, in general, primary prevention addresses the root cause of a disease or injury whereas secondary prevention aims to detect and treat a disease early on. Secondary prevention consists of &quot;early diagnosis and prompt treatment&quot; to contain the disease and prevent its spread to other individuals, and &quot;disability limitation&quot; to prevent potential future complications and disabilities from the disease. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment for a syphilis patient would include a course of antibiotics to destroy the pathogen and screening and treatment of any infants born to syphilitic mothers. Disability limitation for syphilitic patients includes continued check-ups on the heart, cerebrospinal fluid, and central nervous system of patients to curb any damaging effects such as blindness or paralysis.

===Tertiary prevention===
Finally, tertiary prevention attempts to reduce the damage caused by symptomatic disease by focusing on mental, physical, and social rehabilitation. Unlike secondary prevention, which aims to prevent disability, the objective of tertiary prevention is to maximize the remaining capabilities and functions of an already disabled patient. Goals of tertiary prevention include: preventing pain and damage, halting progression and complications from disease, and restoring the health and functions of the individuals affected by disease. For syphilitic patients, rehabilitation includes measures to prevent complete disability from the disease, such as implementing work-place adjustments for the blind and paralyzed or providing counseling to restore normal daily functions to the greatest extent possible.

The general use of machinery that has adequate ventilation and airflow is suggested for these patients in order to halt progression and complications of disease. A study conducted in nursing homes to prevent diseases concluded that the use of evaporative humidifiers to maintain the indoor humidity within the range 40–60% can reduce respiratory risk. Certain diseases thrive in different humidities, so the use of the humidifiers can help kill the particles of diseases.

==Leading causes of preventable death==
===United States===
The leading preventable cause of death in the United States is tobacco; however, poor diet and lack of exercise may soon surpass tobacco as a leading cause of death. These behaviors are modifiable and public health and prevention efforts could make a difference to reduce these deaths.

===Worldwide===
The leading causes of preventable death worldwide share similar trends to the United States. There are a few differences between the two, such as malnutrition, pollution, and unsafe sanitation, that reflect health disparities between the developing and developed world.

However, several of the leading causes of death – or underlying contributors to earlier death – may not be included as &quot;preventable&quot; causes of death. A study concluded that pollution was &quot;responsible for approximately 9 million deaths per year&quot; in 2019. And another study concluded that the global mean loss of life expectancy (a measure similar to years of potential life lost) from air pollution in 2015 was 2.9 years, substantially more than, for example, 0.3 years from all forms of direct violence, albeit a significant fraction of the LLE is considered to be unavoidable (such as pollution from some natural wildfires).&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1093/cvr/cvaa025&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

A landmark study conducted by the World Health Organization and the International Labour Organization found that exposure to long working hours is the occupational risk factor with the largest attributable burden of disease, i.e. an estimated 745,000 fatalities from ischemic heart disease and stroke events in 2016. With this study, prevention of exposure to long working hours has emerged as a priority for prevention healthcare in workplace settings.

==Child mortality==
In 2010, 7.6 million children died before reaching the age of 5. While this is a decrease from 9.6 million in 2000, it was still far from the fourth Millennium Development Goal to decrease child mortality by two-thirds by 2015. Of these deaths, about 64% were due to infection including diarrhea, pneumonia, and malaria. About 40% of these deaths occurred in neonates (children ages 1–28 days) due to pre-term birth complications. The highest number of child deaths occurred in Africa and Southeast Asia. As of 2015 in Africa, almost no progress has been made in reducing neonatal death since 1990. In 2010, India, Nigeria, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Pakistan, and China contributed to almost 50% of global child deaths. Targeting efforts in these countries is essential to reducing the global child death rate.

Child mortality is caused by factors including poverty, environmental hazards, and lack of maternal education. In 2003, the World Health Organization created a list of interventions in the following table that were judged economically and operationally &quot;feasible,&quot; based on the healthcare resources and infrastructure in 42 nations that contribute to 90% of all infant and child deaths. The table indicates how many infant and child deaths could have been prevented in 2000, assuming universal healthcare coverage.

==Preventive methods==
===Obesity===
Obesity is a major risk factor for a wide variety of conditions including cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, certain cancers, and type 2 diabetes. In order to prevent obesity, it is recommended that individuals adhere to a consistent exercise regimen as well as a nutritious and balanced diet. A healthy individual should aim for acquiring 10% of their energy from proteins, 15-20% from fat, and over 50% from complex carbohydrates, while avoiding alcohol as well as foods high in fat, salt, and sugar. Sedentary adults should aim for at least half an hour of moderate-level daily physical activity and eventually increase to include at least 20 minutes of intense exercise, three times a week. Preventive health care offers many benefits to those that chose to participate in taking an active role in the culture. The medical system in our society is geared toward curing acute symptoms of disease after the fact that they have brought us into the emergency room. An ongoing epidemic within American culture is the prevalence of obesity. Healthy eating and regular exercise play a significant role in reducing an individual&#x27;s risk for type 2 diabetes. A 2008 study concluded that about 23.6 million people in the United States had diabetes, including 5.7 million that had not been diagnosed. 90 to 95 percent of people with diabetes have type 2 diabetes. Diabetes is the main cause of kidney failure, limb amputation, and new-onset blindness in American adults.

===Sexually transmitted infections===

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs), such as syphilis and HIV, are common but preventable with safe-sex practices. STIs can be asymptomatic, or cause a range of symptoms. Preventive measures for STIs are called prophylactics. The term especially applies to the use of condoms, which are highly effective at preventing disease, but also to other devices meant to prevent STIs, such as dental dams and latex gloves. Other means for preventing STIs include education on how to use condoms or other such barrier devices, testing partners before having unprotected sex, receiving regular STI screenings, to both receive treatment and prevent spreading STIs to partners, and, specifically for HIV, regularly taking prophylactic antiretroviral drugs, such as Truvada. Post-exposure prophylaxis, started within 72 hours (optimally less than 1 hour) after exposure to high-risk fluids, can also protect against HIV transmission.

===Malaria prevention using genetic modification===
Genetically modified mosquitoes are being used in developing countries to control malaria. This approach has been subject to objections and controversy.

===Thrombosis===

Thrombosis is a serious circulatory disease affecting thousands, usually older persons undergoing surgical procedures, women taking oral contraceptives and travelers. The consequences of thrombosis can be heart attacks and strokes. Prevention can include exercise, anti-embolism stockings, pneumatic devices, and pharmacological treatments.

===Cancer===

In recent years, cancer has become a global problem. Low and middle income countries share a majority of the cancer burden largely due to exposure to carcinogens resulting from industrialization and globalization. However, primary prevention of cancer and knowledge of cancer risk factors can reduce over one third of all cancer cases. Primary prevention of cancer can also prevent other diseases, both communicable and non-communicable, that share common risk factors with cancer.

====Lung cancer====

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States and Europe and is a major cause of death in other countries. Tobacco is an environmental carcinogen and the major underlying cause of lung cancer. Between 25% and 40% of all cancer deaths and about 90% of lung cancer cases are associated with tobacco use. Other carcinogens include asbestos and radioactive materials. Both smoking and second-hand exposure from other smokers can lead to lung cancer and eventually death.

Prevention of tobacco use is paramount to prevention of lung cancer. Individual, community, and statewide interventions can prevent or cease tobacco use. 90% of adults in the U.S. who have ever smoked did so prior to the age of 20. In-school prevention/educational programs, as well as counseling resources, can help prevent and cease adolescent smoking. Other cessation techniques include group support programs, nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), hypnosis, and self-motivated behavioral change. Studies have shown long term success rates (&gt;1 year) of 20% for hypnosis and 10%-20% for group therapy.

Cancer screening programs serve as effective sources of secondary prevention. The Mayo Clinic, Johns Hopkins, and Memorial Sloan-Kettering hospitals conducted annual x-ray screenings and sputum cytology tests and found that lung cancer was detected at higher rates, earlier stages, and had more favorable treatment outcomes, which supports widespread investment in such programs.

Legislation can also affect smoking prevention and cessation. In 1992, Massachusetts (United States) voters passed a bill adding an extra 25 cent tax to each pack of cigarettes, despite intense lobbying and $7.3 million spent by the tobacco industry to oppose this bill. Tax revenue goes toward tobacco education and control programs and has led to a decline of tobacco use in the state.

Lung cancer and tobacco smoking are increasing worldwide, especially in China. China is responsible for about one-third of the global consumption and production of tobacco products. Tobacco control policies have been ineffective as China is home to 350 million regular smokers and 750 million passive smokers and the annual death toll is over 1 million. Recommended actions to reduce tobacco use include decreasing tobacco supply, increasing tobacco taxes, widespread educational campaigns, decreasing advertising from the tobacco industry, and increasing tobacco cessation support resources. In Wuhan, China, a 1998 school-based program implemented an anti-tobacco curriculum for adolescents and reduced the number of regular smokers, though it did not significantly decrease the number of adolescents who initiated smoking. This program was therefore effective in secondary but not primary prevention and shows that school-based programs have the potential to reduce tobacco use.

====Skin cancer====

Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the United States. The most lethal form of skin cancer, melanoma, leads to over 50,000 annual deaths in the United States. Childhood prevention is particularly important because a significant portion of ultraviolet radiation exposure from the sun occurs during childhood and adolescence and can subsequently lead to skin cancer in adulthood. Furthermore, childhood prevention can lead to the development of healthy habits that continue to prevent cancer for a lifetime.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends several primary prevention methods including: limiting sun exposure between 10 AM and 4 PM, when the sun is strongest, wearing tighter-weave natural cotton clothing, wide-brim hats, and sunglasses as protective covers, using sunscreens that protect against both UV-A and UV-B rays, and avoiding tanning salons. Sunscreen should be reapplied after sweating, exposure to water (through swimming for example) or after several hours of sun exposure. Since skin cancer is very preventable, the CDC recommends school-level prevention programs including preventive curricula, family involvement, participation and support from the school&#x27;s health services, and partnership with community, state, and national agencies and organizations to keep children away from excessive UV radiation exposure.

Most skin cancer and sun protection data comes from Australia and the United States. An international study reported that Australians tended to demonstrate higher knowledge of sun protection and skin cancer knowledge, compared to other countries. Of children, adolescents, and adults, sunscreen was the most commonly used skin protection. However, many adolescents purposely used sunscreen with a low sun protection factor (SPF) in order to get a tan. Various Australian studies have shown that many adults failed to use sunscreen correctly; many applied sunscreen well after their initial sun exposure and/or failed to reapply when necessary. A 2002 case-control study in Brazil showed that only 3% of case participants and 11% of control participants used sunscreen with SPF &gt;15.

====Cervical cancer====

Cervical cancer ranks among the top three most common cancers among women in Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa, and parts of Asia. Cervical cytology screening aims to detect abnormal lesions in the cervix so that women can undergo treatment prior to the development of cancer. Given that high quality screening and follow-up care has been shown to reduce cervical cancer rates by up to 80%, most developed countries now encourage sexually active women to undergo a Pap test every 3–5 years. Finland and Iceland have developed effective organized programs with routine monitoring and have managed to significantly reduce cervical cancer mortality while using fewer resources than unorganized, opportunistic programs such as those in the United States or Canada.

In developing nations in Latin America, such as Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, and Cuba, both public and privately organized programs have offered women routine cytological screening since the 1970s. However, these efforts have not resulted in a significant change in cervical cancer incidence or mortality in these nations. This is likely due to low quality, inefficient testing. However, Puerto Rico, which has offered early screening since the 1960s, has witnessed almost a 50% decline in cervical cancer incidence and almost a four-fold decrease in mortality between 1950 and 1990. Brazil, Peru, India, and several high-risk nations in sub-Saharan Africa which lack organized screening programs, have a high incidence of cervical cancer.

====Colorectal cancer====
Colorectal cancer is globally the second most common cancer in women and the third-most common in men, and the fourth most common cause of cancer death after lung, stomach, and liver cancer, having caused 715,000 deaths in 2010.

It is also highly preventable; about 80 percent of colorectal cancers begin as benign growths, commonly called polyps, which can be easily detected and removed during a colonoscopy. Other methods of screening for polyps and cancers include fecal occult blood testing. Lifestyle changes that may reduce the risk of colorectal cancer include increasing consumption of whole grains, fruits and vegetables, and reducing consumption of red meat.

=== Dementia ===
==Health disparities and barriers to accessing care==

Access to healthcare and preventive health services is unequal, as is the quality of care received. A study conducted by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) revealed health disparities in the United States. In the United States, elderly adults (&gt;65 years old) received worse care and had less access to care than their younger counterparts. The same trends are seen when comparing all racial minorities (black, Hispanic, Asian) to white patients, and low-income people to high-income people. Common barriers to accessing and utilizing healthcare resources included lack of income and education, language barriers, and lack of health insurance. Minorities were less likely than whites to possess health insurance, as were individuals who completed less education. These disparities made it more difficult for the disadvantaged groups to have regular access to a primary care provider, receive immunizations, or receive other types of medical care. Additionally, uninsured people tend to not seek care until their diseases progress to chronic and serious states and they are also more likely to forgo necessary tests, treatments, and filling prescription medications.

These sorts of disparities and barriers exist worldwide as well. Often, there are decades of gaps in life expectancy between developing and developed countries. For example, Japan has an average life expectancy that is 36 years greater than that in Malawi. Low-income countries also tend to have fewer physicians than high-income countries. In Nigeria and Myanmar, there are fewer than 4 physicians per 100,000 people while Norway and Switzerland have a ratio that is ten-fold higher. Common barriers worldwide include lack of availability of health services and healthcare providers in the region, great physical distance between the home and health service facilities, high transportation costs, high treatment costs, and social norms and stigma toward accessing certain health services.

== Economics of lifestyle-based prevention ==
With lifestyle factors such as diet and exercise rising to the top of preventable death statistics, the economics of healthy lifestyle is a growing concern. There is little question that positive lifestyle choices provide an investment in health throughout life. To gauge success, traditional measures such as the quality years of life method (QALY), show great value. However, that method does not account for the cost of chronic conditions or future lost earnings because of poor health.

Developing future economic models that would guide both private and public investments as well as drive future policy to evaluate the efficacy of positive lifestyle choices on health is a major topic for economists globally. Americans spend over three trillion a year on health care but have a higher rate of infant mortality, shorter life expectancies, and a higher rate of diabetes than other high-income nations because of negative lifestyle choices. Despite these large costs, very little is spent on prevention for lifestyle-caused conditions in comparison. In 2016, the &quot;Journal of the American Medical Association&quot; estimated that $101 billion was spent in 2013 on the preventable disease of diabetes, and another $88 billion was spent on heart disease. In an effort to encourage healthy lifestyle choices, as of 2010 workplace wellness programs were on the rise but the economics and effectiveness data were continuing to evolve and develop.

Health insurance coverage impacts lifestyle choices, even intermittent loss of coverage had negative effects on healthy choices in the U.S. The repeal of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) could significantly impact coverage for many Americans as well as &quot;The Prevention and Public Health Fund&quot; which is the U.S. first and only mandatory funding stream dedicated to improving public health including counseling on lifestyle prevention issues, such as weight management, alcohol use, and treatment for depression.

Because in the U.S. chronic illnesses predominate as a cause of death and pathways for treating chronic illnesses are complex and multifaceted, prevention is a best practice approach to chronic disease when possible. In many cases, prevention requires mapping complex pathways to determine the ideal point for intervention. Cost-effectiveness of prevention is achievable, but impacted by the length of time it takes to see effects/outcomes of intervention. This makes prevention efforts difficult to fund—particularly in strained financial contexts. Prevention potentially creates other costs as well, due to extending the lifespan and thereby increasing opportunities for illness. In order to assess the cost-effectiveness of prevention, the cost of the preventive measure, savings from avoiding morbidity, and the cost from extending the lifespan need to be considered. Life extension costs become smaller when accounting for savings from postponing the last year of life, which makes up a large fraction of lifetime medical expenditures and becomes cheaper with age. Prevention leads to savings only if the cost of the preventive measure is less than the savings from avoiding morbidity net of the cost of extending the life span. In order to establish reliable economics of prevention for illnesses that are complicated in origin, knowing how best to assess prevention efforts, i.e. developing useful measures and appropriate scope, is required.

==Effectiveness==
There is no general consensus as to whether or not preventive healthcare measures are cost-effective, but they increase the quality of life dramatically. There are varying views on what constitutes a &quot;good investment.&quot; Some argue that preventive health measures should save more money than they cost, when factoring in treatment costs in the absence of such measures. Others have argued in favor of &quot;good value&quot; or conferring significant health benefits even if the measures do not save money. Furthermore, preventive health services are often described as one entity though they comprise a myriad of different services, each of which can individually lead to net costs, savings, or neither. Greater differentiation of these services is necessary to fully understand both the financial and health effects.

A 2010 study reported that in the United States, vaccinating children, cessation of smoking, daily prophylactic use of aspirin, and screening of breast and colorectal cancers had the most potential to prevent premature death. Preventive health measures that resulted in savings included vaccinating children and adults, smoking cessation, daily use of aspirin, and screening for issues with alcoholism, obesity, and vision failure. These authors estimated that if usage of these services in the United States increased to 90% of the population, there would be net savings of $3.7 billion, which comprised only about -0.2% of the total 2006 United States healthcare expenditure. Despite the potential for decreasing healthcare spending, utilization of healthcare resources in the United States still remains low, especially among Latinos and African-Americans. Overall, preventive services are difficult to implement because healthcare providers have limited time with patients and must integrate a variety of preventive health measures from different sources.

While these specific services bring about small net savings, not every preventive health measure saves more than it costs. A 1970s study showed that preventing heart attacks by treating hypertension early on with drugs actually did not save money in the long run. The money saved by evading treatment from heart attack and stroke only amounted to about a quarter of the cost of the drugs. Similarly, it was found that the cost of drugs or dietary changes to decrease high blood cholesterol exceeded the cost of subsequent heart disease treatment. Due to these findings, some argue that rather than focusing healthcare reform efforts exclusively on preventive care, the interventions that bring about the highest level of health should be prioritized.

In 2008, Cohen &quot;et al.&quot; outlined a few arguments made by skeptics of preventive healthcare. Many argue that preventive measures only cost less than future treatment when the proportion of the population that would become ill in the absence of prevention is fairly large. The Diabetes Prevention Program Research Group conducted a 2012 study evaluating the costs and benefits in quality-adjusted life-years or QALYs of lifestyle changes versus taking the drug metformin. They found that neither method brought about financial savings, but were cost-effective nonetheless because they brought about an increase in QALYs. In addition to scrutinizing costs, preventive healthcare skeptics also examine efficiency of interventions. They argue that while many treatments of existing diseases involve use of advanced equipment and technology, in some cases, this is a more efficient use of resources than attempts to prevent the disease. Cohen suggested that the preventive measures most worth exploring and investing in are those that could benefit a large portion of the population to bring about cumulative and widespread health benefits at a reasonable cost.

===Cost-effectiveness of childhood obesity interventions===
There are at least four nationally implemented childhood obesity interventions in the United States: the Sugar-Sweetened Beverage excise tax (SSB), the TV AD program, active physical education (Active PE) policies, and early care and education (ECE) policies. They each have similar goals of reducing childhood obesity. The effects of these interventions on BMI have been studied, and the cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) has led to a better understanding of projected cost reductions and improved health outcomes. The Childhood Obesity Intervention Cost-Effectiveness Study (CHOICES) was conducted to evaluate and compare the CEA of these four interventions.

Gortmaker, S.L. &quot;et al.&quot; (2015) states: &quot;The four initial interventions were selected by the investigators to represent a broad range of nationally scalable strategies to reduce childhood obesity using a mix of both policy and programmatic strategies... 1. an excise tax of $0.01 per ounce of sweetened beverages, applied nationally and administered at the state level (SSB), 2. elimination of the tax deductibility of advertising costs of TV advertisements for &quot;nutritionally poor&quot; foods and beverages seen by children and adolescents (TV AD), 3. state policy requiring all public elementary schools in which physical education (PE) is currently provided to devote ≥50% of PE class time to moderate and vigorous physical activity (Active PE), and 4. state policy to make early child educational settings healthier by increasing physical activity, improving nutrition, and reducing screen time (ECE).&quot; The CHOICES found that SSB, TV AD, and ECE led to net cost savings. Both SSB and TV AD increased quality adjusted life years and produced yearly tax revenue of 12.5 billion U.S. dollars and 80 million U.S. dollars, respectively.

Some challenges with evaluating the effectiveness of child obesity interventions include:
# The economic consequences of childhood obesity are both short and long term. In the short term, obesity impairs cognitive achievement and academic performance. Some believe this is secondary to negative effects on mood or energy, but others suggest there may be physiological factors involved. Furthermore, obese children have increased health care expenses (e.g. medications, acute care visits). In the long term, obese children tend to become obese adults with associated increased risk for a chronic condition such as diabetes or hypertension. Any effect on their cognitive development may also affect their contributions to society and socioeconomic status.
# In the CHOICES, it was noted that translating the effects of these interventions may in fact differ among communities throughout the nation. In addition it was suggested that limited outcomes are studied and these interventions may have an additional effect that is not fully appreciated.
# Modeling outcomes in such interventions in children over the long term is challenging because advances in medicine and medical technology are unpredictable. The projections from cost-effective analysis may need to be reassessed more frequently.

===Economics of U.S. preventive care===
As of 2009, the cost-effectiveness of preventive care is a highly debated topic. While some economists argue that preventive care is valuable and potentially cost saving, others believe it is an inefficient waste of resources. Preventive care is composed of a variety of clinical services and programs including annual doctor&#x27;s check-ups, annual immunizations, and wellness programs; recent models show that these simple interventions can have significant economic impacts.

===Clinical preventive services and programs===
Research on preventive care addresses the question of whether it is cost saving or cost effective and whether there is an economics evidence base for health promotion and disease prevention. The need for and interest in preventive care is driven by the imperative to reduce health care costs while improving quality of care and the patient experience. Preventive care can lead to improved health outcomes and cost savings potential. Services such as health assessments/screenings, prenatal care, and telehealth and telemedicine can reduce morbidity or mortality with low cost or cost savings. Specifically, health assessments/screenings have cost savings potential, with varied cost-effectiveness based on screening and assessment type. Inadequate prenatal care can lead to an increased risk of prematurity, stillbirth, and infant death. Time is the ultimate resource and preventive care can help mitigate the time costs. Telehealth and telemedicine is one option that has gained consumer interest, acceptance, and confidence and can improve quality of care and patient satisfaction.

===Economics for investment===
There are benefits and trade-offs when considering investment in preventive care versus other types of clinical services. Preventive care can be a good investment as supported by the evidence base and can drive population health management objectives. The concepts of cost saving and cost-effectiveness are different and both are relevant to preventive care. Preventive care that may not save money may still provide health benefits; thus, there is a need to compare interventions relative to impact on health and cost.

Preventive care transcends demographics and is applicable to people of every age. The Health Capital Theory underpins the importance of preventive care across the lifecycle and provides a framework for understanding the variances in health and health care that are experienced. It treats health as a stock that provides direct utility. Health depreciates with age and the aging process can be countered through health investments. The theory further supports that individuals demand good health, that the demand for health investment is a derived demand (i.e. investment is health is due to the underlying demand for good health), and the efficiency of the health investment process increases with knowledge (i.e. it is assumed that the more educated are more efficient consumers and producers of health).

The prevalence elasticity of demand for prevention can also provide insights into the economics. Demand for preventive care can alter the prevalence rate of a given disease and further reduce or even reverse any further growth of prevalence. Reduction in prevalence subsequently leads to reduction in costs. There are a number of organizations and policy actions that are relevant when discussing the economics of preventive care services. The evidence base, viewpoints, and policy briefs from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and efforts by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) all provide examples that improve the health and well-being of populations (e.g. preventive health assessments/screenings, prenatal care, and telehealth/telemedicine). The Affordable Care Act (ACA) has major influence on the provision of preventive care services, although it is currently under heavy scrutiny and review by the new administration. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the ACA makes preventive care affordable and accessible through mandatory coverage of preventive services without a deductible, copayment, coinsurance, or other cost sharing.

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), a panel of national experts in prevention and evidence-based medicine, works to improve health of Americans by making evidence-based recommendations about clinical preventive services. They do not consider the cost of a preventive service when determining a recommendation. Each year, the organization delivers a report to Congress that identifies critical evidence gaps in research and recommends priority areas for further review.

The National Network of Perinatal Quality Collaboratives (NNPQC), sponsored by the CDC, supports state-based perinatal quality collaboratives (PQCs) in measuring and improving upon health care and health outcomes for mothers and babies. These PQCs have contributed to improvements such as reduction in deliveries before 39 weeks, reductions in healthcare associated bloodstream infections, and improvements in the utilization of antenatal corticosteroids.

Telehealth and telemedicine has realized significant growth and development recently. The Center for Connected Health Policy (The National Telehealth Policy Resource Center) has produced multiple reports and policy briefs on the topic of Telehealth and Telemedicine and how they contribute to preventive services. Policy actions and provision of preventive services do not guarantee utilization. Reimbursement has remained a significant barrier to adoption due to variances in payer and state level reimbursement policies and guidelines through government and commercial payers. Americans use preventive services at about half the recommended rate and cost-sharing, such as deductibles, co-insurance, or copayments, also reduce the likelihood that preventive services will be used. Despite the ACA&#x27;s enhancement of Medicare benefits and preventive services, there were no effects on preventive service utilization, calling out the fact that other fundamental barriers exist.

====Affordable Care Act and preventive healthcare====
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as just the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare, was passed and became law in the United States on March 23, 2010. The finalized and newly ratified law was to address many issues in the U.S. healthcare system, which included expansion of coverage, insurance market reforms, better quality, and the forecast of efficiency and costs. Under the insurance market reforms the act required that insurance companies no longer exclude people with pre-existing conditions, allow for children to be covered on their parents&#x27; plan until the age of 26, and expand appeals that dealt with reimbursement denials. The Affordable Care Act also banned the limited coverage imposed by health insurances, and insurance companies were to include coverage for preventive health care services. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force has categorized and rated preventive health services as either A or B, as to which insurance companies must comply and present full coverage. Not only has the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force provided graded preventive health services that are appropriate for coverage, they have also provided many recommendations to clinicians and insurers to promote better preventive care to ultimately provide better quality of care and lower the burden of costs.

===Health insurance===
Healthcare insurance companies are willing to pay for preventive care despite the fact that patients are not acutely sick in hope that it will prevent them from developing a chronic disease later on in life. Today, health insurance plans offered through the Marketplace, mandated by the Affordable Care Act are required to provide certain preventive care services free of charge to patients. Section 2713 of the Affordable Care Act, specifies that all private Marketplace and all employer-sponsored private plans (except those grandfathered in) are required to cover preventive care services that are ranked A or B by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force free of charge to patients. UnitedHealthcare insurance company has published patient guidelines at the beginning of the year explaining their preventive care coverage.

===Evaluating incremental benefits===
Evaluating the incremental benefits of preventive care requires a longer period of time when compared to acutely ill patients. Inputs into the model such as discounting rate and time horizon can have significant effects on the results. One controversial subject is use of a 10-year time frame to assess cost effectiveness of diabetes preventive services by the Congressional Budget Office.

Preventive care services mainly focus on chronic disease. The Congressional Budget Office has provided guidance that further research is needed in the area of the economic impacts of obesity in the U.S. before the CBO can estimate budgetary consequences. A bipartisan report published in May 2015 recognizes the potential of preventive care to improve patients&#x27; health at individual and population levels while decreasing the healthcare expenditure.

===Economic case===
====Mortality from modifiable risk factors====
Chronic diseases such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes, obesity and cancer have become the most common and costly health problems in the United States. In 2014, it was projected that by 2023 that the number of chronic disease cases would increase by 42%, resulting in $4.2 trillion in treatment and lost economic output. They are also among the top ten leading causes of mortality. Chronic diseases are driven by risk factors that are largely preventable. Sub-analysis performed on all deaths in the United States in 2000 revealed that almost half were attributed to preventable behaviors including tobacco, poor diet, physical inactivity and alcohol consumption. More recent analysis reveals that heart disease and cancer alone accounted for nearly 46% of all deaths. Modifiable risk factors are also responsible for a large morbidity burden, resulting in poor quality of life in the present and loss of future life earning years. It is further estimated that by 2023, focused efforts on the prevention and treatment of chronic disease may result in 40 million fewer chronic disease cases, potentially reducing treatment costs by $220 billion.

====Childhood vaccinations====
Childhood immunizations are largely responsible for the increase in life expectancy in the 20th century. From an economic standpoint, childhood vaccines demonstrate a very high return on investment. According to Healthy People 2020, for every birth cohort that receives the routine childhood vaccination schedule, direct health care costs are reduced by $9.9 billion and society saves $33.4 billion in indirect costs. The economic benefits of childhood vaccination extend beyond individual patients to insurance plans and vaccine manufacturers, all while improving the health of the population.

====Health capital theory====
The burden of preventable illness extends beyond the healthcare sector, incurring costs related to lost productivity among workers in the workforce. Indirect costs related to poor health behaviors and associated chronic disease costs U.S. employers billions of dollars each year.

According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA), medical costs for employees with diabetes are twice as high as for workers without diabetes and are caused by work-related absenteeism ($5 billion), reduced productivity at work ($20.8 billion), inability to work due to illness-related disability ($21.6 billion), and premature mortality ($18.5 billion). Reported estimates of the cost burden due to increasingly high levels of overweight and obese members in the workforce vary, with best estimates suggesting 450 million more missed work days, resulting in $153 billion each year in lost productivity, according to the CDC Healthy Workforce.

The health capital model explains how individual investments in health can increase earnings by &quot;increasing the number of healthy days available to work and to earn income.&quot; In this context, health can be treated both as a consumption good, wherein individuals desire health because it improves quality of life in the present, and as an investment good because of its potential to increase attendance and workplace productivity over time. Preventive health behaviors such as healthful diet, regular exercise, access to and use of well-care, avoiding tobacco, and limiting alcohol can be viewed as health inputs that result in both a healthier workforce and substantial cost savings.

====Quality-adjusted life years====
Health benefits of preventive care measures can be described in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) saved. A QALY takes into account length and quality of life, and is used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of medical and preventive interventions. Classically, one year of perfect health is defined as 1 QALY and a year with any degree of less than perfect health is assigned a value between 0 and 1 QALY. As an economic weighting system, the QALY can be used to inform personal decisions, to evaluate preventive interventions and to set priorities for future preventive efforts.

Cost-saving and cost-effective benefits of preventive care measures are well established. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation evaluated the prevention cost-effectiveness literature, and found that many preventive measures meet the benchmark of &lt;$100,000 per QALY and are considered to be favorably cost-effective. These include screenings for HIV and chlamydia, cancers of the colon, breast and cervix, vision screening, and screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms in men &gt;60 in certain populations. Alcohol and tobacco screening were found to be cost-saving in some reviews and cost-effective in others. According to the RWJF analysis, two preventive interventions were found to save costs in all reviews: childhood immunizations and counseling adults on the use of aspirin.

====Minority populations====
Health disparities are increasing in the United States for chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular disease. Populations at heightened risk for health inequities are the growing proportion of racial and ethnic minorities, including African Americans, American Indians, Hispanics/Latinos, Asian Americans, Alaska Natives and Pacific Islanders.

According to the Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health (REACH), a national CDC program, non-Hispanic blacks currently have the highest rates of obesity (48%), and risk of newly diagnosed diabetes is 77% higher among non-Hispanic blacks, 66% higher among Hispanics/Latinos and 18% higher among Asian Americans compared to non-Hispanic whites. Current U.S. population projections predict that more than half of Americans will belong to a minority group by 2044. Without targeted preventive interventions, medical costs from chronic disease inequities will become unsustainable. Broadening health policies designed to improve delivery of preventive services for minority populations may help reduce substantial medical costs caused by inequities in health care, resulting in a return on investment.

====Policies====

Chronic disease is a population level issue that requires population health level efforts and national and state level public policy to effectively prevent, rather than individual level efforts. The United States currently employs many public health policy efforts aligned with the preventive health efforts discussed above. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention support initiatives such as Health in All Policies and HI-5 (Health Impact in 5 Years), and collaborative efforts that aim to consider prevention across sectors and address social determinants of health as a method of primary prevention for chronic disease.

====Obesity====
Policies that address the obesity epidemic should be proactive and far-reaching, including a variety of stakeholders both in healthcare and in other sectors. Recommendations from the Institute of Medicine in 2012 suggest that &quot;concerted action be taken across and within five environments (physical activity (PA), food and beverage, marketing and messaging, healthcare and worksites, and schools) and all sectors of society (including government, business and industry, schools, child care, urban planning, recreation, transportation, media, public health, agriculture, communities, and home) in order for obesity prevention efforts to truly be successful.&quot;

There are dozens of current policies acting at either (or all of) the federal, state, local and school levels. Most states employ a physical education requirement of 150 minutes of physical education per week at school, a policy of the National Association of Sport and Physical Education. In some cities, including Philadelphia, a sugary food tax is employed. This is a part of an amendment to Title 19 of the Philadelphia Code, &quot;Finance, Taxes and Collections&quot;, Chapter 19-4100, Sugar-Sweetened Beverage Tax that was approved 2016, which establishes an excise tax of $0.015 per fluid ounce on distributors of beverages sweetened with both caloric and non-caloric sweeteners. Distributors are required to file a return with the department, and the department can collect taxes, among other responsibilities. These policies can be a source of tax credits. Under the Philadelphia policy, businesses can apply for tax credits with the revenue department on a first-come, first-served basis. This applies until the total amount of credits for a particular year reaches one million dollars.

Recently, advertisements for food and beverages directed at children have received much attention. The Children&#x27;s Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative (CFBAI) is a self-regulatory program of the food industry. Each participating company makes a public pledge that details its commitment to advertise only foods that meet certain nutritional criteria to children under 12 years old. This is a self-regulated program with policies written by the Council of Better Business Bureaus. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation funded research to test the efficacy of the CFBAI. The results showed progress in terms of decreased advertising of food products that target children and adolescents.

====Childhood immunization policies====
Despite nationwide controversies over childhood vaccination and immunization, there are policies and programs at the federal, state, local and school levels outlining vaccination requirements. All states require children to be vaccinated against certain communicable diseases as a condition for school attendance. However, only 18 states allow exemptions for &quot;philosophical or moral reasons.&quot; Diseases for which vaccinations form part of the standard ACIP vaccination schedule are diphtheria tetanus pertussis (whooping cough), poliomyelitis (polio), measles, mumps, rubella, haemophilus influenzae type b, hepatitis B, influenza, and pneumococcal infections. The CDC website maintains such schedules.

The CDC website describes a federally funded program, Vaccines for Children (VFC), which provides vaccines at no cost to children who might not otherwise be vaccinated because of inability to pay. Additionally, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) is an expert vaccination advisory board that informs vaccination policy and guides on-going recommendations to the CDC, incorporating the most up-to-date cost-effectiveness and risk-benefit evidence in its recommendations.

==Chess career==

=== Early years ===
Svidler learned to play chess when he was six years old. His first trainer was Viacheslav Stjazhkin. He made his tournament debut in 1989, scoring 5 points from 11 games at the USSR Junior Championship in Pinsk. He scored 7/11 for tied eighth place in the USSR Juniors in 1990 and 5/9 in Oakland. He became an International Master in 1991 and the following year tied for first place with Ragim Gasimov and Vadim Zvjaginsev in the last USSR Junior Championship in Yurmala, scoring 8/11.

Svidler twice attended the Botvinnik–Kasparov School. One of those sessions was during the Baleares Open in Mallorca in December 1989. He transferred to the Dvoretsky–Yusupov School upon the former&#x27;s closure. Mark Dvoretsky said that Svidler had to get written consent from Kasparov&#x27;s mother in order to avoid accusations of taking students from that school.

In 1993, he started work with coach and International Master Andrei Lukin. In a 2011 question &amp; answer session, Svidler said of Lukin, &quot;The real breakthrough, however, coincided very closely with the moment I started to work with Andrey Mikhailovich Lukin – without him I really might have come to nothing.&quot;

1994 was his breakout year, winning the Russian Championship held in Elista with 8/11, winning the under-18 section of the World Youth Championship in Szeged, debuting for Russia at the Chess Olympiad in Moscow, scoring 5.5/8 on second reserve board, and gaining his three Grandmaster norms. Svidler also won the Linares Anibal Open, running alongside the invitational event and tied for first with four other players at the St Petersberg Chigorin Memorial. The short-lived Professional Chess Association in October 1994 ranked him world number 165, rated 2542.

In January 1995, Svidler broke into the top 100 players rated by Fédération Internationale des Échecs (FIDE) at number 86 with a rating of 2585. He started with 0/3 at the Vidra Memorial in Haifa but recovered to 6/11 for tied fourth, shared second with 7/9 in April&#x27;s New York Open, then won the St Petersburg Championship in April. At the Novgorod Open in May–June he scored 6/9 for eighth place on tiebreak. He tied for first place with three players at Novosibirsk. A last round victory against Alexander Morozevich secured his second consecutive Russian Championship on tiebreak from five players with 7.5/11. Svidler rounded off his year placing fourth with 6.5/11 at the strong Groningen Invitational. His success pushed him to 33rd in the world rankings and third strongest junior and 2635 rating.

In 1996, Svidler scored 2.5/5 for fourth place at the Kloosters event in Ter Apel, failed to qualify for the quarter finals of the PCA Rapidplay in April, came fourth with 6.5/11 at Yerevan in May and fifth on tiebreaks with 3.5/7 at Vidra Memorial. At the Tal Blitz Memorial just before the Olympiad, he was mid-table with 9.5/18. His 8.5/11 contribution, including wins in his first four games for Russia, helped win team gold as well as individual bronze on board four at the 32nd Chess Olympiad, but at Fontys Tilburg a couple of losses saw him drop to tenth place on tiebreak with 4.5/11. At Groningen in November, he scored 5.5/11 for seventh place.

Svidler won the Torshavn Open in February 1997, half a point ahead of Ivan Sokolov with 7.5/9, and in March was sixth on tiebreak, with Vladimir Epishin and Valery Loginov scoring 5.5/9 in the St Petersburg Championship, before slipping to eighth place with 5/11 at a closed event in the same city. He came back with team silver and board-three bronze medals at the European Team Championships, England, victorious on tiebreaks. His form continued into the Russian Championship (held as a knockout format) where he won his third title after a long match against Evgeny Bareev, decided after a third pair of tiebreak games. Along the way he defeated Vladimir Malakhov, Ruslan Sherbakov, Semen Dvoirys and Alexey Dreev in the semi-finals. In July–August he tied for second place with 5.5/9 in Bad Homburg.

Svidler was a signatory of a letter published in September which protested the decision of FIDE President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov to change the format of the World Championship. Under the proposals, Anatoly Karpov and Garry Kasparov would be seeded directly to the semi-finals of the FIDE World Chess Championship 1998, Kasparov&#x27;s refusal to participate meant that Karpov was seeded to the final. The letter also complained about the proposed schedule.

At Fontys Tilburg in October 1997, Svidler&#x27;s last round win against Alexander Onischuk enabled him to tie for first with Vladimir Kramnik and Kasparov, scoring 8/11. He also defeated an overly ambitious Kasparov—who had started with 5.5/6—in their individual game. This results propelled him to 9th in the PCA rankings. In October at the World Team Championship in Lucerne, Svidler claimed board two gold with 4.5/7 for the gold medallists Russia. At the World Championship in December, Svidler defeated both Utut Adianto and Epishin 1.5–0.5, before taking Michael Adams to rapid tiebreaks in the third round, where he would lose the last three games to crash out of the event. His successes over the past year saw him given fourth place in the Chess Oscars voting, ahead of Karpov but behind winner Anand, Kasparov and Kramnik.

=== Entering FIDE top 10 ===

Svidler entered the FIDE top 10 for the first time in January 1998, at ninth with a rating of 2690. At Linares, supported by Nigel Short, he showed he could compete at that level of competition with a solid 5.5/12, then came second in Madrid with 5.5/9 in May, a point behind Viswanathan Anand. He lost an exhibition internet blitz match against Kasparov 2–0 immediately after. It was revealed that Kasparov had accidentally played him two days before in a training match online, Kasparov winning 3–1.

He won his last two games to share victory at Dortmund with 6/9. During the tournament it was confirmed that Svidler&#x27;s rating had risen above 2700 for the first time to 2710. In June he finished a point behind Viktor Korchnoi at Bad Homburg with 6/9 and finished second on tiebreak at the Russian Championship behind Morozevich with 7.5/11. Svidler led Russia to gold at the 33rd Chess Olympiad, winning the event in the last round with a 3.5–0.5 defeat of the Netherlands, pushing the United States into silver. Soon after he finished eighth at Tilburg with 5/11, then came third at the Wydra Memorial Rapid, well behind Anand and Judit Polgar.

In January 1999 Svidler tied for sixth with 6.5/13 in the blitz and 6.5/13 for ninth place in the Group A main event at Hoogovens. In a dip in form he lost five games in Linares to finish a disappointing seventh with 5.5/13, then scored 3.5/9 for ninth on tiebreak at Dos Hermanas in April. In early June, Nigel Short introduced Svidler to cricket, a sport for which Svidler is an avid fan, supporting England.

At Frankfurt in June–July, Svidler came fourth in the West Masters with 7.5/14 and fifteenth on tiebreak in the Ordix Open (both rapid events). Seeded to round two, he defeated Alexej Alexandrov 1.5–0.5 but lost to Kiril Georgiev by the same score. In November, he drew an internet rapid match with Morozevich 1–1. Svidler rounded off his year with third place at the St. Petersburg Blitz Championship.

Svidler placed tenth on tiebreak at the World Blitz Cup with 16.5/22 in January 2000, came third on tiebreak at the Wydra Rapidplay with 9/14, before being beaten by Jeroen Piket 1.5–0.5 in the semi-final of the Kasparovchess Grand Prix. he came third at the Ordix Open with 11.5/15, scored 15/16 in a simul in Mainz and shared first scoring 6.5/9 with Mikhail Gurevich at July&#x27;s North Sea Open, Svidler dominated at Biel Chess Festival, finishing two points ahead of joint runners-up Loek van Wely and Ruslan Ponomariov, followed by Boris Gelfand, before his form collapsed with 3.5/9 at Polanica Zdroj, Rubinstein Memorial in August (Gelfand won). After tying for second place in the C group of the preliminary stage of the 1st FIDE World Cup, held in Shenyang, Svidler was eliminated after losing a sudden death tiebreak game against Movsesian. He won the Abihome rapid with 9.5/10 in October, before joining Kramnik&#x27;s team facing Kasparov at the Classical World Championship match in London. He scored 4.5/8 on board three for the gold-medallist Olympiad team in Istanbul, then competed at the FIDE World Championship, eliminated in rapid tiebreaks by Michael Adams in the third round. He finished second with 4.5/7 at December&#x27;s Keres Memorial Rapid, a point behind Jan Timman.

At the Rapid World Cup in March 2001 Svidler was eliminated at the group stage, finishing fourth in Group A, qualified from the group stage of the Viktor Korchnoi 70th Anniversary Tournament but was knocked out in the quarter finals by Piket. He came 11th with 8.5/11 in the Ordix Open, second at Biel, half a point behind Korchnoi, second at Moscow&#x27;s Lightning event, competed in the China-Russia Summit and won team silver and board one bronze at the World Team Championship. Svidler reached the semifinals of the World Championship 2002, after defeating along the way Alejandro Hoffman, Sarunas Sulkis, Vadim Milov, Michael Adams and Boris Gelfand. He was eliminated by eventual winner Ruslan Ponomariov after losing the third game.

After Svidler played in the World Cup (a rapid knockout event) and Eurotel Knockout, an open letter was published with Svidler&#x27;s signature decrying the proposed &quot;Prague Agreement&quot; in which it argued &quot;most of the top chess professionals will have no opportunity to take part in the World Championship until 2005&quot; and called for the establishment of a Grandmasters&#x27; Committee as previously agreed. He then competed at the Moscow (rapid) Grand Prix, tied for second at the Ordix Open, won the Chess960 section and won a two-game handicap match against Junior 7 and Eckhard Freise, and tied for third at the Moscow Blitz Championship. In the &quot;Match of the New Century&quot; between Russia and Rest of the World he scored 5/9, losing to Anand and Teimour Radjabov, He took in a tied Moscow–Saint Petersburg match before competing in the Chess Olympiad scoring 6/9 for team gold. He tied for second, half a point behind Igor Khenkin, at Santo Domingo in December with 7/9.

In January 2003, Svidler finished second behind Giovanni Vescovi with 7.5/11 at the Bermuda A Group before tying for first at Aeroflot, the invitation to Dortmund going to tiebreak winner Victor Bologan. He won the 4th Karpov tournament in Poikovsky on tiebreak with Joel Lautier with 6/9. He defeated Konstantin Chernyshov 2.5-1.5 in a standard match and 3–1 in a rapid match in Voronezh. Svidler&#x27;s surge in form saw him climb to 8th place in the FIDE rankings. At the Mainz Chess Classic in August, he won an eight-game Chess960 match against Peter Leko 4.5–3.5. Svidler claimed his fourth Russian Championship in September on tiebreak over Morozevich, scoring 7/9 and scored 5/8 for Russia winning the European Team Championship, ahead of Israel.

<text>Heather Erxleben (born 1966) is a former Canadian Forces soldier who was the first female to graduate from a Regular Force infantry trades training course. She graduated from the PPCLI Battle School in CFB Wainwright, Alberta on January 19, 1989. Other women had attempted to pass the 16-week training course, but she was the first to succeed.

Her first assignment after training was to 3rd Battalion Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry, at that time stationed in BC. She was in the military for three years, and left the services after her initial commitment was completed.

Before her time in the Canadian Forces, Erxleben drove a truck for a lumber company. As of 2006, Heather Erxleben is a nurse in British Columbia.

<text>Franco-American is a brand name of the Campbell Soup Company. Founded by Alphonse Biardot as Franco-American Food Company, it sells gravy and condensed soups; it was formerly used for SpaghettiOs and other pasta products until 2004 when it was replaced with the main Campbell&#x27;s brand. 

==History==

The company was founded as Franco-American Food Company by Alphonse Biardot, who immigrated to the United States from France in 1880. In 1886, he and his two sons opened a commercial kitchen in Jersey City, New Jersey, featuring the foods of his native country. The company proved a success, particularly with its line of canned soup and pasta, and it was acquired by Campbell&#x27;s in 1915.
The Franco-American name was phased out over the next two decades for soup products and in the late 1990s for pasta products. However their product line was still sufficient to continue advertising well into the 1970s, with Barry Manilow performing their jingle &quot;Who Can? Franco Ameri-Can&quot;. On November 18, 2004, Campbell&#x27;s announced it was discontinuing the name for pasta products in favor of its own &quot;to boost sales of what had been Franco-American&#x27;s canned SpaghettiOs, RavioliOs, Macaroni and Cheese, and regular spaghetti, along with beef, chicken and turkey gravy varieties sold in cans and jars&quot;.

As of 2023, the Campbell Soup Company continues to sell gravy products under the Franco-American name, along with a small line of condensed soups that are similar to soups sold under the Campbell&#x27;s brand.
Their logo can still be found on the back of SpaghettiOs cans, next to the copyright.

<text>Major-General Edward James Montagu-Stuart-Wortley, (31 July 1857 – 19 March 1934) was a senior British Army officer. He saw extensive active service in many parts of world, including Afghanistan, South Africa, Egypt, the Ottoman Empire, Malta, Sudan, France and Ireland. He was the source of the &quot;interview&quot; with Kaiser Wilhelm II that was the basis of the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; Affair that weakened the Kaiser&#x27;s political power in Germany. During the First World War he commanded the 46th (North Midland) Division and was controversially dismissed from the command of his division after the Battle of the Somme in 1916 due to the failure of his division&#x27;s diversionary attack.

==Early life==
Wortley was born in London on 31 July 1857, the second son of Francis Dudley Montagu-Stuart-Wortley, grandson of John Stuart-Wortley-Mackenzie, 2nd Baron Wharncliffe, and nephew of Edward Montagu-Stuart-Wortley-Mackenzie, 1st Earl of Wharncliffe.

He attended Eton College from 1866 and gained a commission in the King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps (60th Foot) on 13 October 1877.

==Imperial wars==
Montagu-Stuart-Wortley served as Superintendent of Army Signalling for the Kurram Valley Field Force during the Second Anglo–Afghan War (1878–80). After the First Boer War broke out in December 1880, with the Boer Commandos in the Transvaal besieging British garrisons there, the Governor of Natal Sir George Pomeroy Colley raised the Natal Field Force; Montagu-Stuart-Wortley served with the Natal Field Force in the actions at Laing&#x27;s Nek, Schuinshoogte and Majuba Hill.

In 1881 he acted as a Military Secretary to General Valentine Baker who at that time was in command of the Egyptian police and then, during the Anglo-Egyptian War, was aide-de-camp to Major General Sir Evelyn Wood. In 1884–85 he took part in the Nile Expedition to relieve General Gordon who was besieged in Khartoum and took part in the Abu Klea on 17 January 1885. In 1885 he accompanied Conservative politician Sir Henry Drummond Wolff to Constantinople as a military attaché. Later that year he was appointed as Deputy Assistant Adjutant General to Sir Francis Grenfell as he led his division at the Battle of Ginnis. He was promoted to captain in March 1886 and to the brevet rank of major in the same month.

After attending the Staff College, Camberley in 1889 he became a brigade major, serving in Malta from 1893 to 1896. He was promoted to the substantive rank of major 4 April 1894, and was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1896. Lord Kitchener led a second Nile Campaign from 1896 where Stuart-Wortley was second in command of a gunboat flotilla and later led a band of Arab irregulars who secured the east bank of the Nile in the battle of Omdurman. For his services in this campaign he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) in November 1898.

During the Second Boer War, Stuart-Wortley, after having served as an assistant adjutant general (AAG) from December 1899 to March 1900, commanded a composite battalion of the KRRC and the Rifle Brigade (The Prince Consort&#x27;s Own) at the Battle of the Tugela Heights, assisting in the Relief of Ladysmith. In July 1901, he received the promotion to lieutenant colonel, and was appointed a military attaché to Paris, a post he would hold for three years, during which time he was promoted to brevet colonel in March 1904. He then went on a period of half-pay from July 1904. In June 1906 he was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in the 1906 Birthday Honours, and was promoted to full colonel in February 1907.

In the summer of 1907 the German Emperor, Kaiser Wilhelm, rented Stuart-Wortley&#x27;s home Highcliffe Castle whilst he recovered from an acute throat trouble. In return for his hospitality Edward was given two stained glass windows for the castle and invited to visit the German Army&#x27;s manoeuvres at Alsace the next year. Stuart-Wortley had several conversations with the Kaiser, during which Wilhelm II explained that he desired and had always worked towards, positive relations with Britain. Stuart-Wortley, believing the Kaiser, decided that publicizing these views would counteract the anti-German sentiment in Britain that was rising during the Anglo-German naval arms race. He thus wrote up his notes from his meetings and handed them over to a journalist from &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; in September 1908. Although the transcript had first been submitted to the Kaiser&#x27;s staff for approval, the text was not properly checked by German officials, and the publication of the notes as an &quot;interview&quot; with the Kaiser resulted in the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; Affair that infuriated the British public and weakened the political power of the Kaiser within Germany.

In April 1908 Stuart-Wortley was removed from the half-pay list, promoted to the temporary rank of brigadier general, and succeeded Colonel Samuel Lomax in command of the 10th Infantry Brigade, which was then based at Shorncliffe Army Camp. After relinquishing command of the brigade he again went on half-pay in April 1912. He was promoted to major general in March 1913.

==First World War==
On 1 June 1914, shortly before the outbreak of the First World War, Major General Montagu-Stuart-Wortley became GOC of the 46th (North Midland) Division, a Territorial Force (TF) division, in succession to Major General Hubert Hamilton.

In October 1915, the division saw action in France, where it had been since March, during the Battle of Loos when it made a costly attack against the Hohenzollern Redoubt and Fosse 8. Wortley proposed a bombing attack, but was overruled and ordered to go ahead with a frontal attack by Lieutenant General Richard Haking (his corps commander). In the event, the attack was a disastrous failure and the division lost 180 officers and 3,583 men killed, wounded or missing. The action was described in the Official History as a &quot;tragic waste of infantry&quot;.

Despite his reputation as an excellent trainer of troops, the perceived poor performance and high casualty rates of the 46th Division at the Hohenzollern Redoubt and again at Gommecourt, would result in Stuart-Wortley being made a scapegoat for failure. Woods argues that, as there is no evidence to suggest Stuart-Wortley lacked competence or failed in his duties at the Hohenzollern attack and that these charges are largely unfair.

Stuart-Wortley had argued for a limited and methodical attack: using the &#x27;bite and hold&#x27; tactic which had emerged at Neuve Chapelle. This was especially important because of the limited resources available to him: the number of artillery pieces, artillery planning, counter-battery spotting, the quantity, type and efficiency of shells, the quantity and use of gas and smoke and a uniform issue of effective, standard bombs. To his credit, the twenty-two critical and useful tactical points Stuart-Wortley formed from his analysis of the Battle of Loos suggests he was an open-minded commander keen to learn and develop from past experiences.

Accusations against planners and commanders followed the attack. Lieutenant Colonel Josiah Wedgwood, MP for Staffordshire, wrote directly to Prime Minister H. H. Asquith with a report summarising his discussions with survivors and wounded of 137th Brigade. He argued that a change in general would restore morale and asked why over-confident objectives had been set. Asquith immediately sent the letter to Haig, who rejected most of Wedgwood&#x27;s findings laying the blame on the ineffectual fighting quality and lack of courage of the Territorial troops and on Stuart-Wortley, their commander. Haig&#x27;s evidence came from a gas officer who alleged that when the gas was released &quot;for nearly an hour ... there was no hostile fire in the ground ... Yet the Territorials in question only advanced to our old trench line and held!&quot;, and that &quot;the attack was made by officers and NCOs, but few rank and file followed them.&quot; Lord Cavan, commanding the Guards Division informed Haig: &quot;that the companies of the 46th Division who had been ordered to attack towards the line of the Dump-Quarries did not go forward 40 yards&quot;.

Haig concluded that there was a &quot;want of discipline in the 46th Division and general ignorance of war conditions&quot;.

Woods argues that Haig&#x27;s criticism of 46th Division is unfair and based on doubtful evidence. &quot;The comments from the unnamed gas officer can easily be explained by the hour between the gas being released (1pm) and the commencement of the infantry attack (2pm). The artillery plan directed the intense two-hour barrage toward more rear-ward targets from 1pm, to allow the gas to be directed toward the first line of enemy trenches&quot;.

Woods&#x27; analysis of the battalion, brigade and divisional War Diaries clearly shows that the assault formations left their own trenches and advanced at their allotted time. It wasn&#x27;t the &quot;want of discipline&quot; that restricted 137th Brigade&#x27;s advance but the dreadful casualties suffered in their limited advance against unbroken German defences. Woods suggests that both morale and discipline were high in 46th Division. Indeed, the War Diaries suggest that many soldiers were forced to retire from positions beyond Cavan&#x27;s 40 yards.

Despite both Haig and Haking approving Divisional plans, Haig reserved particular criticism for Stuart-Wortley. Haig wrote: &quot;I do not think much of Major-General Stuart-Wortley as a Divisional Commander and have already spoken to the GOC XI Corps on the subject&quot;. Stuart-Wortley appears to have follow the plans to the best of his limited options. Woods suggests that it may have been that Stuart-Wortley&#x27;s original idea – of a series of limited, step-by-step attacks – was seen as unambitious, over-cautious and indicative of a man lacking in &#x27;offensive spirit&#x27;. 

Though Gary Sheffield, in his biography of Haig, is largely supportive of his performance in the First World War, he describes Haig as &quot;ungenerous&quot; and &quot;unfair&quot; in his blame of Stuart-Wortley for the failure at the Hohenzollern Redoubt.

Woods concludes that Stuart-Wortley was likely unaware that he was a pawn in a bigger game of personal politics being played out in the most senior ranks of the British Army, twelve days before Haig succeeded French.

Wortley incurred Haig&#x27;s displeasure by writing regularly to King George V about the activities of the 46th Division (despite having the permission of Sir John French to do so). This, and the disagreement with Haking about the Hohenzollern Redoubt attack, left Wortley as a &quot;marked man&quot; against whom Haig conspired&quot;. At the time of the opening of the Somme, he was a few weeks short of his 59th birthday, but in ill-health, suffering from sciatica. Despite his experience, he was &quot;past his fighting best&quot; and his fitness for operational command was questionable. One officer later described him in 1916 as: &quot;a worn-out man, who never visited his front line and was incapable of inspiring any enthusiasm.&quot;

===Gommecourt===
As part of Lieutenant-General Sir Edmund Allenby&#x27;s British Third Army, the 46th Division was involved in the diversionary Attack on the Gommecourt Salient on the first day of the Battle of the Somme, on 1 July 1916.
The initial attack by the Division launched from trenches located at the village of Foncquevillers at 7.30 A.M. failed within a half an hour of its commencement with heavy casualties from enemy fire, most of the Division&#x27;s troops seeking cover and becoming entrapped in its own assembly trenches.
Montagu-Stuart-Wortley was ordered to renew the attack at midday as the neighbouring 56th (1/1st London) Division – a fellow Territorial Force Division – on its right had made good progress but was in need of support as it came under increasing counter-attack from numerically-superior rallying German forces besetting it on three sides simultaneously, another British attack to the immediate south at Serre also having failed. The 46th Divisional infantry force by this time however had become incapable of doing this due a chaotic situation in its own trenches, and was unable to seriously re-engage for the rest of the day.
After continual failed attempts to organize a renewed attack by his troops throughout the morning and early afternoon, it was clear to Montagu Stuart-Wortley that there was no prospect of success, but at 3.30 P.M. under pressure from senior command&#x27;s exhortations he ordered a token effort to be made by two rifle companies of men, only one platoon of 20 men actually going over-the-top on the receipt of the order, with only 2 men of it surviving the attempt unscathed.

In the evening the 56th Division was forced back out of the enemy trenches after 13 hours of continuous heavy fighting within the German position on its own, having sustained very heavy losses, sealing the defeat of the overall operation at Gommecourt. Thus the 46th Division&#x27;s attack failed completely, and it further had the distinction of suffering the lowest casualties in 2 455 killed, wounded and missing of 13 British divisions engaged that day. It was subsequently judged responsible for the failure of the Gommecourt action in having left its fellow Territorials from London to fight alone in an impossible tactical situation, and was thereafter dogged by a reputation for being a poor quality military formation, a reputation that it would not come out from under the shadow of until its spectacular victory in the crossing of the St. Quentin Canal in 1918.

Reporting on the attack after its failure VII Corps commander, Lieutenant-General Thomas D&#x27;Oyly Snow, stated in official correspondence:
Snow ordered a Court of Inquiry on 4 July 1916 into the actions of the 46th Division during the attack, but before it delivered its findings General Haig as Commander-in-Chief ordered Montagu-Stuart-Wortley to leave the field and return to England.

Given that Montagu Stuart-Wortley&#x27;s orders prior to the attack had been &quot;to occupy the ground that is won by the artillery&quot; his dismissal remains a subject of controversy. According to Alan MacDonald, &quot;the Division and its General were made scapegoats for the failure of a fatally flawed concept dreamt up by higher authority – the diversionary attack at Gommecourt&quot;.

==Later life==
Upon his return home he was appointed to the backwater command of the 65th (2nd Lowland) Division in Ireland until March 1919. He retired from the British Army on 31 July 1919. Post-war, Wortley made several protests to the Government about the perceived injustice that he had suffered at its hands, particularly with regard to not having received the customary honours issued to commanders of Divisional rank in the war, but to no avail. He died 19 March 1934 at age 76.

==Personal life==

Edward married Violet Hunter Guthrie on 5 February 1891; she was the daughter of James Alexander Guthrie, 4th Baron of Craigie and her sister Rose Ellinor Guthrie was married to General the Hon Sir Cecil Edward Bingham. They had three children Major Nicholas Rothesay Stuart-Wortley (1892–1926), Louise Violet Beatrice Montagu-Stuart-Wortley (1893–1970) and Elizabeth Valetta Montagu-Stuart-Wortley (1896–1978).

Edward&#x27;s older brother, the Hon Sir Francis Montagu-Stuart-Wortley-Mackenzie, succeeded to the Earldom of Wharncliffe and his younger brother, the Hon Sir Alan Richard Montagu-Stuart-Wortley, became a lieutenant general in the British Army serving throughout the First World War.

Stuart-Wortley was granted the precedence of the son of an earl in 1900.

<doc id="1032804" wikidata="Q7840003" url="?curid=1032804" title="Trial of the Pyx">
<text>The Trial of the Pyx () is a judicial ceremony in the United Kingdom to ensure that newly minted coins from the Royal Mint conform to their required dimensional and fineness specifications. Although coin quality is now tested throughout the year under laboratory conditions, the event has become an annual historic tradition. Each year, thousands of coins are put on trial, consisting of both those struck for circulation and non-circulating commemorative coins.

First held in the 12th century, the event takes place in the hall of the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths in London, where the Deputy Master of the Mint (Chief Executive of the Royal Mint) is in effect put on trial before a High Court judge as metallurgical assayers and selected leaders from the financial world sample coins from the mint&#x27;s output. The boxes in which coins are stored form the ceremony&#x27;s namesake: the word &quot;pyx&quot; derives from the Greek meaning &#x27;wooden box&#x27;.

== History ==
According to records from the Dialogus de Scaccario, in 1179 the weight and fineness of coinage received by England&#x27;s Exchequer was examined for regulatory purposes under the supervision of the Baron of the Exchequer. At this time the Master of the Mint was ordered to put aside one coin for every ten pounds of silver minted so that they might be tested every three months. Found in the Red Book of the Exchequer, a section thought to be written in May 1279 titled (&quot;A new form of currency&quot;) set forth procedures for a regular series of trials whereby the Master of the Mint became liable for failings in the currency standards. Coins were to be put into a box with two keys, each held by the master and warden and its contents tested four times a year.

In 1282, in the reign of Edward I, a writ was issued ordering barons to carry out pyx trials throughout the realm. The current statutory basis for the Trial of the Pyx is the Coinage Act 1971, the latest in a long series of similarly named Acts of Parliament. Specific procedures are established by Order in Council, the most recent being the Trial of the Pyx Order 1998, which was amended in 2005, 2012 and 2016. It is not required for a new Order to be issued for each Trial: this is required only to implement regulatory revision.

Prior to the Coinage Act 1870 trials took place at the Palace of Westminster and coins were stored in Westminster Abbey&#x27;s Pyx Chapel. The Act moved the venue for the trial to Goldsmiths&#x27; Hall, the headquarters of the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths who carry out the testing.

== Procedure ==
Every year around February, the event begins with a meeting held in Goldsmiths&#x27; Hall. Attending the gathering are the Prime Warden of the Goldsmiths&#x27; Company, three of their supporting Wardens, the Head of the Assay Office, Liverymen, The Deputy Master of the Mint and the King&#x27;s Remembrancer. The presiding judge is the King&#x27;s Remembrancer (or Queen&#x27;s Remembrancer when the sitting monarch is female), the Senior Master of the King&#x27;s Bench. It is his or her responsibility to ensure that the trial be held in accordance with the law and to deliver the jury&#x27;s final verdict to His Majesty&#x27;s Treasury. Where and when a trial is to take place is at the Treasury&#x27;s discretion, though there must be a trial in any year during which the Royal Mint issues coins.

Coins to be tested are drawn from the regular production of the Royal Mint. The Deputy Master of the Mint must, throughout the year, randomly select several thousand sample coins and place them aside for the Trial. These must be in a certain fixed proportion to the number of coins produced. For example, for every 5,000 bimetallic coins issued, one must be set aside, whereas for silver Maundy money the proportion is one in 150.

The jury is composed of at least six assayers from the Company of Goldsmiths. They have two months to test the provided coins, and decide whether they have been properly minted. Criteria are given for diameter, chemical composition and weight for each class of coinage. Depending on the number of coins being assayed there are a varying number of jurors needed. Sitting along a table, the jurors are handed packets of up to 50 coins, by a Royal Mint official, which they must count. Each juror selects one coin from the pile, places it in a copper bowl and it is then sent to be assayed. The remaining coins are either sent to be weighed or weighed at the table. Smaller denomination coins that are more numerous are counted by machine.

At the company&#x27;s assay office, the coins which were placed in the copper bowls are melted down and formed into plates where their fineness and weight can be compared against a corresponding trial plate which acts as a benchmark. After three months of testing, a ceremony presided over by the King&#x27;s Remembrancer is held, when the final verdict is given. Attending the event and receiving the verdict under the capacity as Master of the Mint is the Chancellor of the Exchequer or her Deputy Master, the Chief Executive of the Royal Mint.

If the coinage is found to be substandard, the trial carries a punishment for the Master of the Mint of a fine, removal from office, or imprisonment. The last master of the mint to be punished was Isaac Newton in 1696, though he later showed that the mistake originated in a faulty reference.

== List of trials ==
Prior to the Coinage Act 1971 which ordered a trial to be held at least once a year, trials were carried out in no particular order and often covered the coinage of multiple years.

=== Trials ===
=== Trials during the reign of Elizabeth II ===
Trials were held in every calendar year of the reign of Elizabeth II, starting in 1952.

<text>Östergötlands storregemente or Landsregementet i Östergötland (Östergötland Grand Regiment, Regiment of the Land in Östergötland) was one of the nine grand regiments organized by Gustavus Adolphus in the late 1610s and split into smaller regiments in the 1620s.

== History ==

Raised in Götaland from smaller units of 500 men called &quot;fänikor&quot;, more specifically from the province of Östergötland and in the county of Jönköping, in 1618 and counting 3,000 men (at the time, it counted 2,176 men). The grand regiment was in turn organized into three field regiments (&quot;fältregementen&quot;) and a cavalry regiment, thus actually being more like a brigade in spite of the name.

The regiment did not take part in any campaign during its short lifetime. The grand regiments of Sweden where reorganized during the early 1620s to consist of three field regiments, each of eight companies of 150 men, thus making the total number 3,600 soldiers per grand regiment. It is unsure whether or not the cavalry regiment was included in the total number.

In 1623, the regiment was split into three smaller regiments, Östergötland Infantry Regiment, Jönköping Regiment and Östergötland Cavalry Regiment.

== Campaigns ==
*None.

== Organization ==
Before being split, the regiment was organized as follows:

* &quot;1:a fältregementet&quot; (1st Field Regiment)
** 6 companies from Östergötland
** 2 companies from Jönköping County
* &quot;2:a fältregementet&quot; (2nd Field Regiment)
** 8 companies from Jönköping County
* &quot;3:e fältregementet&quot; (3rd Field Regiment)
** 3 companies from Östergötland
** 1 company from Jönköping County
** 1 company from Västergötland
** 3 companies &quot;Vacant&quot;
* &quot;Kavalleriregementet&quot; (Cavalry Regiment)
** 8 companies from Östergötland

<text>Super Black Market Clash is a 1993 compilation album released by the English punk rock band The Clash. It contains B-sides and rare tracks not available on the group&#x27;s regular studio albums. The album is an expanded repackaging of the 1980 release Black Market Clash, a 10-inch EP containing nine songs. The man in the foreground of the front cover art on both releases is Don Letts, who worked with The Clash on several projects and later was a founding member of Big Audio Dynamite.

==&quot;Black Market Clash&quot;==
Black Market Clash was released in October 1980, only in the US and Canada, in between &quot;London Calling&quot; and &quot;Sandinista!&quot;. It compiled recordings which were then unavailable in the US except as imports. The disc was one in the series of &quot;Nu-Disk&quot; 10-inch records from Epic. Other artists in the series included New Musik and Cheap Trick.

&quot;The Prisoner,&quot; the cover of &quot;Pressure Drop&quot; by Toots and the Maytals, &quot;City of the Dead,&quot; and &quot;Armagideon Time&quot; had all been UK b-sides from the period 1977–79, respectively of &quot;White Man in Hammersmith Palais,&quot; &quot;English Civil War,&quot; &quot;Complete Control,&quot; and &quot;London Calling.&quot; &quot;Pressure Drop&quot; is presented here in a remix by Bill Price.

At the time of release, this was the only record that featured the cover of the &quot;Time Is Tight&quot; instrumental by Booker T &amp; the MGs. &quot;Capital Radio&quot; was extremely rare in the UK. Rather than re-issue the original the group recorded a new version for &quot;The Cost of Living&quot; as &quot;Capital Radio Two.&quot; &quot;Cheat&quot; is from their UK debut album but had been left off the US version.

&quot;Bankrobber&quot; had been a UK A-side. &quot;Robber Dub&quot; was originally intended for the b-side of an unreleased &quot;Bankrobber&quot; 12&quot; dance club single. The two tracks appear here in a combined edit that is unique to &quot;Black Market Clash&quot;. &quot;Justice Tonight/Kick It Over&quot;, the dub version of &quot;Armagideon Time&quot;, is the last track. This was previously available as the B-side to the 12-inch &quot;London Calling&quot; club single. The full length version of &quot;Justice Tonight/Kick It Over&quot; is 8:54 and the 7:00 edited version is also unique to &quot;Black Market Clash&quot;.

Black Market Clash was reissued in the 1980s on 12-inch vinyl and cassette, with the same track listing as the 10-inch. It was re-released on compact disc in 1991, but discontinued when Super Black Market Clash replaced it. It was available again for a short period of time in 2006 in a few countries. It was reissued on 10-inch vinyl again in 2011.

Black Market Clash was issued in Japan in 1992, with liner notes in Japanese.

==&quot;Super Black Market Clash&quot;==
Super Black Market Clash is a compilation album released by The Clash in 1993, containing B-sides and rare tracks not available on their studio albums. It is an expanded repackaging of the 1980 Black Market Clash EP, a single 10&quot; record with nine songs. The cover art follows the design of the original but is rendered in different colors.

Super Black Market Clash was released on CD and in a 3x10&quot; vinyl edition, but does not contain the tracks &quot;Capital Radio One&quot;, &quot;Cheat&quot;, &quot;Bankrobber/Robber Dub&quot; or &quot;Armagideon Time&quot; found on the original EP. At the time of re-release, &quot;Capital Radio One&quot;, &quot;Bankrobber&quot; and &quot;Armagideon Time&quot; had recently been included on the compilations &quot;The Story of the Clash, Volume 1&quot; and &quot;Clash on Broadway&quot;, so omitting the tracks did not affect their availability. The extended release also replaces the version of &quot;Pressure Drop&quot; that appeared on &quot;Black Market Clash&quot; with the B-side mix, and &quot;Justice Tonight/Kick It Over&quot; is a longer version than the track on &quot;Black Market Clash&quot;.

With 21 tracks, &quot;Super Black Market Clash&quot; does not fully compile the Clash&#x27;s B-sides and rarities. It does however contain important songs, such as three from &quot;The Cost of Living&quot; EP and several B-sides previously unavailable on CD including &quot;The Cool Out&quot; (a remix of &quot;The Call Up&quot;) and &quot;Long Time Jerk&quot; (although in a shorter version than appeared as the B-side to &quot;Rock the Casbah&quot;).

The artwork for the remaster corrects an error in the track listing on the original (&quot;Pressure Drop&quot; was listed as track 5 and &quot;The Prisoner&quot; as track 6 when they actually play in the opposite sequence). The original version of the revised artwork also introduced a new error by listing &quot;Radio Clash&quot; as &quot;This Is Radio Clash&quot; (the former song, which appears on the album, is the B-side to the latter song which does not), corrected on later pressings.

The Clash&#x27;s entire catalog, including this album, was remastered and re-released in January 2000.

===Track listing===
===Personnel===
* Joe Strummer – lead vocals, rhythm guitar, piano
* Mick Jones – lead guitar, vocals, piano
* Paul Simonon – bass, vocals
* Terry Chimes – drums on &quot;1977&quot; and &quot;Listen&quot;
* Topper Headon – drums, percussion on all other tracks

Additional musicians
* Gary Barnacle – saxophone on &quot;1–2 Crush on You&quot; and &quot;Time Is Tight&quot;

<text>Västergötlands storregemente or Landsregementet i Västergötland (Västergötland Grand Regiment, Regiment of the Land in Västergötland) was one of the nine grand regiments organized by Gustavus Adolphus in the late 1610s and split into smaller regiments in the 1620s.

== History ==

Raised in Götaland from smaller units of 500 men called &quot;fänikor&quot;, more specifically from the provinces of Västergötland and Dalsland and the counties of Skaraborg and Älvsborg, in 1613 and counting 3,000 men. The grand regiment was in turn organized into three field regiments (&quot;fältregementen&quot;) and a cavalry regiment, thus actually being more like a brigade in spite of the name.

The regiment did not take part in any campaign during its short lifetime. The grand regiments of Sweden where reorganized during the early 1620s to consist of three field regiments, each of eight companies of 150 men, thus making the total number 3,600 soldiers per grand regiment. It is unsure whether or not the cavalry regiment was included in the total number.

Between 1621 and 1624, the regiment was split into four smaller regiments, Skaraborg Regiment, Älvsborg Regiment, Västergötland-Dalsland Regiment and Västergötland Cavalry Regiment.

== Campaigns ==
*None.

== Organization ==
Before being split, the regiment was organized as follows:

* &quot;1:a fältregementet&quot; (1st Field Regiment)
** 5 companies from Skaraborg County
** 3 companies from Älvsborg County
* &quot;2:a fältregementet&quot; (2nd Field Regiment)
** 5 companies from Älvsborg County
** 3 companies from Skaraborg County
* &quot;3:e fältregementet&quot; (3rd Field Regiment)
** 4 companies from Älvsborg County
** 4 companies from Dalsland
* &quot;Kavalleriregementet&quot; (Cavalry Regiment)
** 8 companies from Västergötland

<doc id="1032819" wikidata="Q4638341" url="?curid=1032819" title="46th (North Midland) Division">
<text>The 46th (North Midland) Division was an infantry division of the British Army, part of the Territorial Force, that saw service in the First World War. At the outbreak of the war in 1914, the 46th Division was commanded by Major-General Hon. Hon. E. J. Montagu-Stuart-Wortley. Originally called the North Midland Division, it was redesignated as the 46th Division in May 1915.

==Formation==
The Territorial Force (TF) was formed on 1 April 1908 following the enactment of the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 (7 Edw.7, c.9) which combined and re-organised the old Volunteer Force, the Honourable Artillery Company and the Yeomanry. On formation, the TF contained 14 infantry divisions and 14 mounted yeomanry brigades. One of the divisions was the North Midland Division.

The North Midland Division was created by combining two existing Volunteer Infantry brigades, the Staffordshire Brigade and the North Midland Brigade. The Staffordshire Brigade was composed of battalions of the South Staffordshire Regiment and the Prince of Wales&#x27;s (North Staffordshire Regiment). The North Midland Brigade was split into two, one, the Lincoln and Leicester Brigade, composed of battalions of the Lincolnshire and Leicestershire Regiments, the other, the Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Brigade, comprising the four TF battalions of the Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Regiment (later the Sherwood Foresters). In peacetime, the divisional headquarters was in Lichfield.

==History==
The North Midland Division was sent to France in February 1915 and served on the Western Front for the duration of the First World War. On 12 May 1915 the division was numbered 46th (North Midland) Division and the brigades were also numbered. During the Battle of Loos the 46th Division was decimated in an attack on the Hohenzollern Redoubt on 13 October 1915.

It was later involved in the Battle of the Somme in July 1916, where in the opening phase as part of VII Corps, the southernmost corps of the British Third Army, the Division took part in the diversionary attack at Gommecourt on the first day on the Somme, 1 July 1916, which was a catastrophic failure resulting in heavy losses.

The event dogged the division afterwards with a poor reputation until 29 September 1918, during the Hundred Days Offensive, when it re-established its name at the Battle of St. Quentin Canal where, utilising life-belts and collapsible boats, it crossed the formidable obstacle of the canal and used scaling ladders to surmount the steep gradient of the opposite bank and captured multiple fortified machine-gun posts.

The total losses for the Division between February 1915 and 11 November 1918 were: Officers, 275 killed, 1,104 wounded and 123 missing; Other Ranks, 3,475 killed, 21,285 wounded and 3,307 missing.

During the war, it served in the First, Second, Third and Fifth Armies, and in the I, II, III, V, VII, XI, XIII, XIV, XVII and XVIII Corps.

<doc id="1032821" wikidata="Q4799484" url="?curid=1032821" title="Arthur Lehman Goodhart">
<text>Arthur Lehman Goodhart (1 March 1891 – 10 November 1978) was an American-born academic jurist and lawyer; he was Professor of Jurisprudence at the University of Oxford, 1931–51, when he was also a Fellow of University College, Oxford. He was the first American to be the Master of an Oxford college, and was a significant benefactor to the college.

==Early life and education==
Arthur Goodhart was born to a Jewish family in New York City, the youngest of three children born to Harriet &quot;Hattie&quot; (née Lehman) and Philip Julius Goodhart. His siblings were Howard Lehman Goodhart and Helen Goodhart Altschul (married to Frank Altschul). His maternal grandfather was Mayer Lehman, one of three brothers who co-founded the investment banking firm Lehman Brothers. Goodhart was educated at the Hotchkiss School, Yale University and Trinity College, Cambridge. At Yale, he was an editor of campus humor magazine &quot;The Yale Record&quot;. After returning to the United States, he practised law until World War I. Following the war, he started to pursue an academic career in law, initially at Cambridge University and later at Oxford University where he became Professor of Jurisprudence and subsequently the Master of University College. He was editor of the &quot;Law Quarterly Review&quot; for fifty years.

==Career==
Rejected for service with British forces in World War I, in 1914, Goodhart became a member of the U.S. forces when the U.S. joined the war in 1917; he became counsel to the U.S. mission to Poland, in 1919.

Goodhart was called to the bar by the Inner Temple 1919, and became a fellow of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, and university lecturer in jurisprudence; he edited the &quot;Cambridge Law Journal&quot;, 1921–5, and the &quot;Law Quarterly Review&quot;, 1926. In 1931 he moved to Oxford to become professor of jurisprudence. During WWII, he helped Giles Alington as coordinator of the wartime Short Leave Courses at Balliol College, Oxford. He gave up that chair when he became Master of University College, Oxford, 1951–63. Subsequently, he was an Honorary Fellow of the college until his death in 1978. In 1952 he delivered the Hamlyn Lectures.

As a member of the Law Revision Committee, Goodhart helped to promote improvements in various branches of the law.

==Personal life==
Arthur Goodhart was married to Cecily Goodhart (née Carter), a devout Anglican. They had three children: Sir Philip Goodhart; William Goodhart, Lord Goodhart of Youlbury; and Charles Goodhart (after whom Goodhart&#x27;s law is named).

==Legacy==
Students during Goodhart&#x27;s Mastership of University College included Bob Hawke, matriculated 1953, who was later Prime Minister of Australia.

The Goodhart Quad and the Goodhart Building (to the east, overlooking the quad and used for student accommodation) at University College, Oxford, off Logic Lane, are named in his memory. The largest lecture theatre in the Sir David Williams Building, which houses the Faculty of Law at the University of Cambridge, is also named &quot;The Arthur Goodhart Lecture Theatre&quot; after him. Cecily&#x27;s Court, a small open area containing a fountain, located between the Goodhart Building and 83–85 High Street, is named in memory of Goodhart&#x27;s wife.

==Honours and titles==
* 1938 Honorary bencher, Lincoln&#x27;s Inn
* 1943, King&#x27;s Counsel
* 1948, Honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE). As a US citizen, an honorary knighthood, and name not prefixed &quot;Sir&quot;
* 1952, Fellow of the British Academy
* He received honorary degrees from twenty universities
* Honorary Fellow, Trinity College, Cambridge
* Honorary Fellow, University College, Oxford

<doc id="1032830" wikidata="Q4385116" url="?curid=1032830" title="Bell D-188A">
<text>The Bell D-188A (unofficial military designations XF-109/XF3L) was a proposed eight-engine Mach 2–capable vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) tiltjet fighter that never proceeded past the mock-up stage.

==Development==
In 1955, Bell Aircraft was requested by both the USAF and the US Navy to develop a VTOL/STOVL supersonic, all-weather fighter-bomber and defence interceptor. The project was highly ambitious and was designed to fulfill a multitude of roles for two different services. The aircraft was designated the Model 2000, and was offered in two different versions – the D-188 for the Navy and the D-188A for the Air Force. Bell had rather optimistically called the Navy version the XF3L-1 and the Air Force version the XF-109, although neither of these designations were official. In 1959, Bell teamed with Convair to form a joint weapon systems management team in order to push the XF-109 program. On 5 December 1960, Bell publicly showed off the design as the XF-109 – the Air Force version, as the Navy had lost interest the year earlier, however in the spring of 1961, the US Air Force canceled the program and no examples were built.

===Designation===
The military designations were not official and were speculative on the part of Bell. The Navy&#x27;s XF3L-1 was not assigned, but would have been the D-188&#x27;s designation had the aircraft been built, as this was the next in the US Navy&#x27;s number series. The Air Force XF-109 designation had previously been assigned to a proposed Convair F-106B variant, however, had subsequently been left blank and Bell assumed – if the D-188A had been built – that this would have been assigned to the aircraft. Many reference works refer to the D-188A by its assumed experimental series number, but in fact the XF-109 designator was never assigned.

==Design==
The aircraft was unconventional, and consisted of a long, thin, area ruled fuselage with a large fin and all-moving stabilators in the tail. The single seat cockpit was in the extreme nose and the small-span wing was mounted high on the fuselage. At the ends of each wing were pods that contained two turbojets each. These pods were designed to swivel through an arc of 100° (horizontal to 10° past vertical) to allow for both horizontal and vertical flight. To take off vertically, the pods were rotated to direct the engine&#x27;s thrust downward, while for horizontal flight the pods were rotated back to the horizontal. The pods were capable of directing thrust slightly forward as well for enhanced landing maneuvers. In addition to the four wing engines, four engines were also mounted in the fuselage – two in the rear directed out of two separate tail ducts, and two liftjets directly aft of the cockpit and positioned vertically to aid in VTOL operation, exhausting out of two ventral ducts. The D-188A featured an engine bleed system to assist in vertical lift and maneuvering. Bleed air from the fuselage engine compressors would have been directed to a pair of thrusters in the nose and two more in the tail to aid in pitch, roll and yaw movements.

Armament would have consisted of two 20mm cannon in the fuselage, an internal weapons bay and eight wing hard points for missiles and other ordnance.

<text>Smålands storregemente or Landsregementet i Småland (Småland Grand Regiment, Regiment of the Land in Småland) was one of the nine grand regiments organized by Gustavus Adolphus in the late 1610s and split into smaller regiments in the 1620s.

== History ==

Raised in Götaland from smaller units of 500 men called &quot;fänikor&quot;, more specifically from the province of Småland and the counties of Kalmar and Kronoberg, in 1616 and counting 3,000 men. The regiment had seven &quot;fänikor&quot; and 2,478 men in 1618 under the command of Herman Wrangel. The grand regiment was in turn organized into three field regiments (&quot;fältregementen&quot;) and a cavalry regiment, thus actually being more like a brigade in spite of the name.

The regiment did not take part in any campaign during its short lifetime. The grand regiments of Sweden where reorganized during the early 1620s to consist of three field regiments, each of eight companies of 150 men, thus making the total number 3,600 soldiers per grand regiment. It is unsure whether or not the cavalry regiment was included in the total number.

In 1623, the regiment was split into three smaller regiments, Kronoberg Regiment, Kalmar Regiment and Småland Cavalry Regiment.

== Campaigns ==
* None.

== Organization ==
Before being split, the regiment was organized as follows:

* &quot;1:a fältregementet&quot; (1st Field Regiment)
** 8 companies from Kalmar County
* &quot;2:a fältregementet&quot; (2nd Field Regiment)
** 8 companies from Kronoberg County
* &quot;3:e fältregementet&quot; (3rd Field Regiment)
** 4 companies from Kalmar County
** 4 companies from Kronoberg County
* &quot;Kavalleriregementet&quot; (Cavalry Regiment)
** 8 companies from Småland

<doc id="1032851" wikidata="Q464739" url="?curid=1032851" title="Brian Ching">
<text>Brian Ching (born May 24, 1978) is an American former professional soccer player who played for twelve years in Major League Soccer and represented the U.S. national team for eight years.

Ching&#x27;s professional career began when he was the 16th pick overall by the Los Angeles Galaxy in the 2001 MLS SuperDraft, making him the first Gonzaga player and the first player from his native Hawaii selected in the MLS draft. After winning the U.S. Open Cup with Los Angeles, Ching was released from the team and played with the second division Seattle Sounders. He returned to first division soccer when the San Jose Earthquakes acquired him in the 2003 MLS supplemental draft. He won an MLS Cup and Supporters&#x27; Shield with the Earthquakes, collected the MLS Comeback Player of the Year Award, the MLS Golden Boot, and was named to the MLS Best XI.

In 2006, Ching relocated to Houston when the Earthquakes became the Houston Dynamo. He led the team to back-to-back MLS Cup Championships in 2006 and 2007 and four MLS finals overall. A six-time MLS All-Star, Ching retired from professional soccer in 2013 as Houston Dynamo&#x27;s all-time leading scorer.

Ching made his international debut May 26, 2003, becoming the first Hawaiian-born player to represent the United States. He became the first Hawaiian to be named to the U.S. roster for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, although he did not see any playing time. His only international silverware is the 2007 Gold Cup. Off the field, Ching is a pillar in the Houston community where he is partnered with Habitat for Humanity to build homes for underprivileged families in the Houston area through fundraising efforts under his program &quot;The House that Ching Built&quot;.

==Early life==
Ching lost his father, Francis, to cancer on December 25, 1992, when he was 14 years old. Stephanie Whalen, Ching&#x27;s mother, raised him and his two brothers as a single parent. Ching did not play soccer until he was seven years old, agreeing to only if his mother would coach.

Ching attended Kamehameha Schools Kapālama High School in Honolulu and played in the soccer team in his junior and senior year. He was named as the Interscholastic League of Honolulu&#x27;s MVP during his senior year with 14 goals and six assists. His junior year he was a second team All-ILH selection.

During his last year of high school Ching played with the Honolulu Bulls Soccer Club, a club team, and traveled to tournaments on the mainland where he was noticed by the Gonzaga coaching staff. He went on to play for the Gonzaga Bulldogs men&#x27;s soccer program under head coach Einar Thorarinsson, whom Ching credits &quot;for believing in him and providing him the skills to grow and mature to be able to compete at the next level.&quot;

During his collegiate career, Ching played for the Spokane Shadow of the Premier Development Soccer League (where Gonzaga coach Einar Thorarinsson was also the coach of the Shadow) and set a total of 21 goals during his stint in the 1998 and 1999 seasons. Ching was named the PDSL rookie of the year in 1998.

===Collegiate career===
Ching joined the Bulldogs for the 1996 season, and as a freshman played in 18 matches with five starts. He finished second on the team in scoring with 12 points on three goals and six assists. As a sophomore, he appeared in 16 matches with 14 starts and was second on the team behind West Coast Conference Player of the Year and teammate Jeff McAllister with 10 goals and 23 points, ranking fifth in the WCC in both categories. The 10 goals were second on the all-time Gonzaga single-season list and his 23 points were third on the all-time GU list. He earned All-WCC second-team honors.

His junior season was cut short by a knee injury suffered in the season opener, then re-injured in the next match, and received a medical redshirt year. Ching missed the entire 1998 season after surgery to repair injured meniscus in right knee.

The injury bug continued to plague Ching in the summer of 1999 when he was kicked in the cheek and eye while playing for the Spokane Shadow of the USL, the injury requiring surgery. Despite that injury, Ching was ready for the Bulldogs season opener and went on to start 17 of 18 matches. He scored 13 goals and had 8 assists for 34 points. The 13 goals were third on the all-time GU single-season list, the 34 points second. He scored his first goal of the season in a 2–2 tie against 11th-ranked Washington Huskies, got the insurance goal in a 3–1 victory over 7th-ranked Stanford and had a pair of goals against 4th-ranked University of San Diego in 4–2 home victory. He earned All-WCC first-team honors.

His final season of 2000, Ching missed three matches with an injury but still scored eight goals and recorded 22 points. He was named All-WCC first team and earned All-Far West Region first-team honors. Ching finished his Gonzaga career with 34 goals, which still ties him third on the all-time GU list, and his 23 assists are a Gonzaga career record. Ching&#x27;s 91 career points are still tied for second on the Gonzaga charts. With Ching, the Bulldogs were back-to-back co-champions of the West Coast Conference in 1997 and 1998. Ching majored in accounting.

==Club career==

===Los Angeles Galaxy (2001) and Seattle Sounders (2001–2002)===
Ching began his professional career when the Los Angeles Galaxy drafted him as the 16th overall pick of the 2001 MLS SuperDraft. Los Angeles chose midfielder Brian Mullan and forward Isaias Bardales Jr. in the first round, 9th and 11th respectively, before picking Ching with their fourth pick in the second round. Ching was the first ever Hawaiian selected in the MLS draft.

Ching joined a roster that included U.S. Soccer Hall of Fame players Cobi Jones, Alexi Lalas, and Paul Caligiuri, Mexico&#x27;s top World Cup scorer Luis Hernández, Mauricio Cienfuegos, Ezra Hendrickson, Danny Califf, Kevin Hartman and was coached by Sigi Schmid. Ching wore the number 9 jersey with Los Angeles. Ching made his MLS debut against San Jose on April 7, 2001, as a member of the starting lineup. During the 2001 season, Ching appeared in eight games (starting one) and recorded one goal and one assist.

Ching started and played the full match in his U.S. Open Cup debut, a 5–0 victory over the Nashville Metros at Titan Stadium on June 27, 2001, in the second round. Ching went the full 90 again in Los Angeles&#x27; 3–1 victory over the Seattle Sounders Select where he provided the assist to Isaias Bardales&#x27; 81st-minute goal, the Galaxy&#x27;s third of the match. Those would be Ching&#x27;s only appearances in the 2001 tournament as the Los Angeles Galaxy went on to win their first U.S. Open Cup trophy in franchise history.

Ching made his MLS Cup Playoffs debut in a 4–1 loss in Game 2 of the quarterfinals against the New York-New Jersey MetroStars on September 27, 2001, after coming on as an 88th minute substitution for Cobi Jones. Ching appeared for a second time in the playoffs in the Galaxy&#x27;s 1–0 overtime win in Game 2 of the MLS semifinal series against the Chicago Fire on October 14, 2001, entering the game in the 91st minute for Sasha Victorine. The Galaxy advanced to the 2001 MLS Cup final and tied 1–1 with the San Jose Earthquakes in regulation before Dwayne De Rosario&#x27;s golden goal in the 96th minute ended the match.

After signing Carlos Ruiz, the Galaxy waived Ching on February 13, 2002, to comply with the MLS roster limits. One month later, he signed with the Seattle Sounders of the A-League where scored four goals and provided one assist in seven games the previous year when he was on loan from Los Angeles. Ching finished the 2002 season second in the A-League in scoring with 16 goals and eight assists, and was selected as a member of the A-League All-League first team.

===San Jose Earthquakes (2003–2005)===
The first time the Earthquakes coaching staff got a good look at Brian Ching was facing him in the July 17, 2002, third round match of the U.S. Open Cup when San Jose defeated the Seattle Sounders 4–3 after sudden death extra time. Kinnear, assistant coach at the time, and head coach Frank Yallop were impressed with how Ching matched up with Earthquakes defender Eddie Robinson, considered one of the best defenders in MLS at the time. Ching began training with the Earthquakes the following January. On February 11, 2003, San Jose traded Devin Barclay to D.C. United in exchange for the first overall pick in the 2003 MLS supplemental draft and on February 28, 2013, they used that pick to draft Ching.

Ching made his official Earthquakes debut in Guatemala City on March 16, 2003, playing a full match in a 4–2 Champions&#x27; Cup loss to C.S.D. Municipal. He played his first Earthquakes home game in the second leg against Municipal where he scored the first goal in the 35th minute. Ching made his first Earthquakes start in the MLS regular season on April 12, 2003, at Colorado Rapids and scored 53 seconds into the game. He would miss five games due to a right hamstring strain before returning to the starting lineup to score two goals for his first multi-goal game in MLS on July 2, 2003, at the MetroStars. He played 90 minutes in his first encounter against his old club Seattle Sounders on August 5 but the 1–0 loss eliminated San Jose from the 2003 Open Cup.

Ching left the August 16, 2003, game at New England Revolution with a ruptured right Achilles tendon. He underwent surgery on August 19 and missed the rest of the 2003 season as the San Jose Earthquakes went on to win the 2003 MLS Cup. Ching scored a then-career-high six goals and two assists during 2003. He was named to the MLS Team of the Week for April 12 and May 3, 2003.

Ching returned from injury in the 2004 Champions&#x27; Cup as a sub in both legs against eventual champion L.D. Alajuelense. Ching made his first start of the season on May 1 vs. D.C. United. Ching finished with a career-high 12 goals in MLS, sharing the MLS Golden Boot with Eddie Johnson. He was named to the MLS Best XI and recognized as the MLS Comeback Player of the Year. He also finished as the Earthquakes scoring champion and Most Valuable Player for the 2004 season.

In 2005, Ching scored seven goals in 16 games and tallied a career-high five assists in MLS play. He registered a goal or an assist in five straight games before missing 15 matches with a hamstring injury. He ended the regular season having recorded a goal or assist in six straight games. The San Jose Earthquakes finished the 2005 season with the best regular season record, clinching the Supporters&#x27; Shield. After the most successful regular season in team history with an 18–4–10 record and 64 points, the Earthquakes were placed on hiatus on December 15, 2005, with the franchise moving to Houston.

===Houston Dynamo (2006–2013)===
Along with the rest of his Earthquakes teammates, Ching moved to Houston for the 2006 season. He scored four goals in Houston&#x27;s first-ever game on April 2, 2006, against the Colorado Rapids, becoming the seventh player in MLS history to score four goals in a single game. Ching found out he had been selected to U.S. world cup team on May 2 and celebrated with a game-deciding goal the following MLS fixture, May 6, against rival club FC Dallas. Ching missed six MLS games while he was with the U.S. national team at the 2006 FIFA World Cup. His bicycle kick on September 30 vs. D.C. United, which would later be awarded the MLS Goal of the Year Award, was the deciding goal in a 1–0 win that secured Houston&#x27;s first ever MLS playoff spot.

In the 2006 MLS Cup Playoffs, Ching scored the series-winning goal with a header in stoppage time of the 2–0 win vs. Chivas USA in the second leg of the Western Conference semifinals. He was named MVP of the MLS Cup 2006 after scoring the tying goal in the 114th minute, less than one minute after New England Revolution had taken a 1–0 lead, and scoring the winning penalty kick in the penalty kick shootout.

In 2007, Ching ended the season tied for the team lead with seven goals despite missing 10 games entirely due to injuries and national-team call-ups. He contributed in the 2007 MLS Cup Playoffs with two playoff goals but sat out the 2007 MLS Cup final after straining his calf in the Western Conference final. He led Houston&#x27;s comeback from a 2–0 aggregate deficit in the second leg of the Western Conference semifinal vs. FC Dallas on November 2, setting up Stuart Holden&#x27;s goal in the 67th minute and then scoring himself from a Dwayne De Rosario through ball in the 72nd minute to tie the series. In extra time, of that game, he scored from close range in the 97th minute to give Houston the lead for good.

Ching was a staple in the Dynamo lineup during international competition. In the 2007 CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup he set up the series-winning goal against Puntarenas F.C. when his header hit the post and Kelly Gray scored on the rebound. Ching scored the opening goal in the semifinal first leg vs. C.F. Pachuca on March 15, heading in a Craig Waibel cross. In the semifinal second leg at Estadio Hidalgo on April 5, he set up the first Houston goal by keeping the ball in on the sideline, leading to Brian Mullan&#x27;s goal and later scored in the 79th minute to give Houston a 4–3 aggregate lead before Pachuca rallied to win in extra time. Ching also participated in the 2007 Superliga, playing in all three group stage matches. He set up goal just 11 seconds into match vs. Monarcas Morelia on July 29, passing to Joseph Ngwenya for the fastest goal in Dynamo history. Ching scored the only goal in 1–0 win vs. D.C. United on August 1 and hit the post with the fourth penalty kick in the Dynamo&#x27;s semifinal shootout loss vs. Pachuca on August 14.

During the 2008 season, Ching established team and personal records with 13 goals in the regular season and five assists in 25 games. Ching ranked fifth in the league in goals. In the team&#x27;s second visit to San Jose since relocating to Houston, Ching scored a game-tying goal in second half and celebrated by pointing to the Dynamo crest in front of San Jose fans. In the final CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup he set up two of Houston&#x27;s three goals in the quarterfinal second leg vs. CSD Municipal. In the 2008 Superliga he appeared in three games, starting the semifinal vs. Pachuca and the championship game at New England Revolution. In the inaugural CONCACAF Champions League, Ching appeared as a substitute at San Francisco F.C. and started vs. C.D. Luis Ángel Firpo, scoring the game&#x27;s only goal to help Dynamo reach the quarterfinals.

Ching&#x27;s performance during the 2009 season earned him Dynamo&#x27;s Golden Boot for the third straight year with eight goals and three assists. He became seventh Dynamo player to make 100th starts for the club in all competitions and assisted on Cam Weaver&#x27;s game-tying goal in the 80th minute of a 2–1 loss at Columbus Crew on September 13. In the 2008–09 CONCACAF Champions League Ching played all 90 minutes of both legs of the quarterfinal series vs. C.F. Atlante. He appeared in five games of the 2009–10 CONCACAF Champions League, making three starts. In the 2009 MLS Cup Playoffs, he netted the game-winning goal in 95th minute of a 1–0 overtime win vs. Seattle, swiveling to volley a shot into the left side netting for his 50th Dynamo goal in all competitions.

Ching ran into disciplinary trouble during the 2009 campaign. In July 2009, Ching was fined $500 by MLS for his comments regarding the officiating of the Dynamo&#x27;s 2–1 loss to Seattle Sounders FC (a game Ching did not play in due to participation in the 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup). On his Twitter page, Ching referred to the referee as &quot;a joke&quot; and &quot;a cheat&quot; for calling a Fredy Montero shot cleared off the line a goal. Ching scored the opening goal from a Brad Davis free kick in 3–2 win vs. Real Salt Lake on August 19 but was ejected in the 82nd minute for hard foul, the first red card in the 162 games of his MLS career. He was ejected again in next MLS game, a 0–0 tie vs. Los Angeles Galaxy on October 18, for raising his hand to the face of an opponent.

In 2010, Ching shrugged off injuries and national team disappointment to score seven goals and add three assists in 20 games, making 16 starts, to win the team&#x27;s Golden Boot for the fourth straight year. His August 21 bicycle kick against Chicago was named ESPNSoccernet.com&#x27;s MLS Goal of the Year and Dynamo Goal of the Year. He took over as the Dynamo team captain after the retirement of Wade Barrett. He was named as Don Garber&#x27;s Commissioner&#x27;s Pick for the 2010 MLS All-Star Game in Houston, a game where he came on as second-half substitute and scored with a header to cut the deficit to 2-1 vs. Manchester United F.C. The Dynamo missed the playoffs in 2010.

Ching was limited to 1,242 minutes in 20 appearances due to injury in 2011, the lowest minute total of his Houston career, but still tied for team lead with five goals. He started all four matches the Dynamo took part in the 2011 MLS Cup Playoffs, scoring a goal and adding an assist, to help lead the Dynamo back to the MLS Cup final. He started and set up the game-winning goal with left-footed through ball in 2–1 first-leg win at Philadelphia Union and scored the game-winning goal with header from a Brad Davis free kick in a 1–0 win the second-leg, scoring the final MLS goal at Robertson Stadium. Ching started the Eastern Conference championship match at Sporting Kansas City and closed the night by hoisting the trophy as team captain after the 2–0 win. He made his second career start in an MLS Cup final at Los Angeles, who denied the Dynamo the title with a narrow 1–0 victory.

====Montreal Impact, return to Houston and retirement (2011–2013)====
Ching was left exposed by Houston in the 2011 MLS expansion draft and was selected by expansion side Montreal Impact less than a week after playing in the MLS Cup final. Ching was traded back to Houston on February 16, 2012, for a first-round draft pick in the 2013 MLS SuperDraft, after training with Montreal for about a month, coincidentally playing a preseason game against the Houston Dynamo.

Ching started opening day on for the Dynamo for the sixth time in seven years and nearly scored at Chivas USA when his first-touch volley off a long cross from Brad Davis hit inside of post and caromed away for near goal. Ching made his 200th MLS appearance (136th with Dynamo) in 3–1 loss to Vancouver Whitecaps FC on June 10. Ching made his 150th Dynamo start in all competitions against D.C. United on April 28, the 4th Dynamo to reach this milestone. Ching drew and converted a penalty in the 83rd minute on June 30 vs. Philadelphia, his second goal of the year and first at BBVA Compass Stadium. The goal against Philadelphia was his 20th career game-winning goal. He would go on to set a career-high with 30 games in 2012 regular season, tying his career-high of five assists.

Ching signed a deal in early 2013 to return to the Dynamo as a player-coach and later announced his retirement effective at the end of the 2013 season. Ching officially announced his intention to retire at the end of the 2013 Major League Soccer season on September 24, 2013, although he played his final professional minutes in a 4–1 loss to the New York Red Bulls on Sunday, September 8, 2013. He made two more appearances on the match day squad, his last being in a CONCACAF Champions League game on September 25, 2013, but was an unused substitution.

Ching did not feature in the Dynamo&#x27;s 2013 MLS Cup Playoffs run as he was not called up to the matchday squad for any of the playoff games. The Dynamo were eliminated by Sporting Kansas City in the Eastern Conference championship game on November 23, 2013, thus bringing an official end to Ching&#x27;s 12-year MLS career.

==International career==

Although having a Chinese background, and being contacted by the Chinese Football Association to play for the Chinese team, Ching still earned his first cap with the U.S. national team on May 26, 2003, as a substitute in a friendly match against Wales at Spartan Stadium (home stadium of Ching&#x27;s club at the time, San Jose Earthquakes). He is the first Hawaiian and the second Chinese-American (after Mark Chung) to play for the United States. Ching scored his first international goal, an equalizer in the 88th minute, in a World Cup qualifier 1–1 tie against Jamaica in Kingston on August 18, 2004.

On May 2, 2006, Ching was named to the U.S. men&#x27;s squad for the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany but did not make an appearance in the tournament.

He scored a goal in a 2–0 US CONCACAF Gold Cup victory over Trinidad and Tobago on June 9, 2007. He drew a penalty in the box of the second half of the Gold Cup Final against Mexico. Landon Donovan converted the penalty, tying the game at one. The USA won 2–1 after Benny Feilhaber&#x27;s game winner.

Ching was called in to the USA side to face Barbados in the first round of CONCACAF World cup Qualifying for the 2010 World Cup. He then scored two goals in the US team&#x27;s largest victory ever, 8–0.

On May 11, 2010, Ching was named to the preliminary U.S. men&#x27;s squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa but did not make the final 23-man roster.

==Management career==
The Houston Dynamo re-signed Ching in March 2013 to serve as a player/coach in this his last year playing. Under his last contract with the MLS club, Ching served the title of assistant coach.

On December 23, 2013, the Houston Dash named Ching as the inaugural managing director the NWSL franchise. Ching manages the day-to-day duties on both the business and technical sides under the supervision of Dash and Dynamo team president Chris Canetti. The role shares similar responsibilities as the general manager tag, with the addition of branding Ching as &quot;the face of the team&quot; so that he can gin up sales and awareness by making himself publicly available as the face of the organization. While his focus will be primarily with the Dash, Ching will also advise Canetti and head coach Dominic Kinnear as needed on the technical side with the Dynamo.

Each fall since 2012, Ching and Kroger honored members of the Houston community who were chosen as &quot;Ching&#x27;s Champions.&quot; The Ching&#x27;s Champions initiative was started by Ching and Kroger as a way to pay tribute to those members of the Houston community who perform selfless acts for others. Each of the winners gets to take part in a shopping spree with Ching at a Houston-area Kroger.

Eight champions were selected in 2012 from the group of nominees and each winner received a Ching&#x27;s Champions medal and a four-minute shopping spree at Kroger. The 2012 winners collected over $7,700 worth of groceries. In 2013, the five &quot;champions&quot; were able to secure over $9,000 of groceries and merchandise during the 250-second shopping spree.

====The House that Ching Built====
In 2009, Ching made a commitment to give back to his adopted community by raising money to build an affordable home through Houston Habitat for Humanity. With the support of Dynamo Charities and MLS W.O.R.K.S., Ching has raised $75,000 to sponsor the build through personal appearances, events, individual giving and corporate partnerships.

The funds raised exceeded Ching&#x27;s initial goal and allowed Houston Habitat to upgrade the home with green features, including solar panels and a solar hot water heater through a grant from Green Mountain Energy. The Milby Park build was completed in 2010 and welcomed the Urbano family with a home dedication in May 2011.

Along with the announcement of the testimonial match to be played in honor of his retirement at the end of the 2013 season, Ching committed to fundraise $85,000 to build a &quot;green&quot; house for another local Houston family in need. Almost half of the donations for the 2013 project were provided by Dynamo owners Anschutz Entertainment Group, Brenner Sports &amp; Entertainment and Golden Boy Sports &amp; Entertainment.

===Endorsements===

On March 8, 2012, BBVA Compass announced Ching as their social-media ambassador to promote causes important to Ching, his team and the bank. Among other things like charity work and appearances, Ching uses Facebook and Twitter to encourage his followers to contribute to &quot;Building a Better Houston&quot;, BBVA Compass&#x27; community-service initiative with the Dynamo.

PLEX is the performance center of Ching and other athletes like fellow Dynamo alumni Stuart Holden, NFL quarterback and Katy product Andy Dalton, and NFL defensive end Julius Peppers.

PUMA was the official match boots provider for Ching. As one of PUMA&#x27;s sponsored Major League Soccer players, Ching kicked off Breast Cancer Awareness Month 2011 in limited-edition Project Pink v1.11 boots, showing support for his female counterparts during the Dynamo&#x27;s home game on October 1 versus the Chicago Fire.

===Television===
Ching hosted his own sports segment on KHOU, &quot;Kickin&#x27; It with Brian Ching&quot;, on which he offered up advice on everything soccer from becoming a professional soccer player to befriending the StairMaster.&quot;

<text>Greebles, also greeblies (singular: greebly), or &quot;nurnies&quot;, are parts harvested from plastic modeling kits to be applied to an original model as a detail element. The practice of using parts in this manner is called &quot;kitbashing&quot;.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;greeblies&quot; was first used by effects artists at Industrial Light &amp; Magic in the 1970s to refer to small details added to models. According to model designer and fabricator Adam Savage, George Lucas, Industrial Light &amp; Magic&#x27;s founder, coined the term &quot;greeblies&quot;. 

Ron Thornton is widely believed to have coined the term &quot;nurnies&quot; referring to CGI technical detail that his company Foundation Imaging produced for the &quot;Babylon 5&quot; series, while the model-making team of &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; referred to them as &quot;wiggets&quot;.

<text>Hans-Gunnar Liljenwall (born 9 July 1941) is a former Swedish modern pentathlete who caused the disqualification of the Swedish team at the 1968 Summer Olympics for alcohol use.

==Career==
Liljenwall was the first athlete to be disqualified at the Olympics for drug use, following the introduction of anti-doping regulations by the International Olympic Committee in 1967. Liljenwall reportedly had &quot;two beers&quot; to calm his nerves before the pistol shooting event. The Swedish team eventually had to return their bronze medals.

Alcohol was not on the list of restricted substances released by the International Olympic Committee for the 1968 Summer Olympics.

Liljenwall also participated in the 1964 and 1972 Olympics. In 1964 he finished 11th individually and fourth with the team, and in 1972 he placed 25th and fifth, respectively.

<text>Valery Yakovlevich Bryusov (; – 9 October 1924) was a Russian poet, prose writer, dramatist, translator, critic and historian. He was one of the principal members of the Russian Symbolist movement.

== Background ==
Valery Bryusov was born on 13 December 1873 (1 December 1873 according to the old Julian calendar) into a merchant&#x27;s family in Moscow. His parents were educated for their class and had some literary associations, but had little to do with his upbringing, leaving the boy largely to himself. He spent a great deal of time reading &quot;everything that fell into [his] hands&quot;, including the works of Charles Darwin and Jules Verne, as well as various materialistic and scientific essays. The future poet received an excellent education, studying in two private Moscow gymnasia between 1885 and 1893.

==Career==
Bryusov began his literary career in the early 1890s while still a student at Moscow State University with his translations of the poetry of the French Symbolists (Paul Verlaine, Maurice Maeterlinck, and Stéphane Mallarmé) as well at that of Edgar Allan Poe. Bryusov also began to publish his own poems, which were very much influenced by the Decadent and Symbolist movements of his contemporary Europe. During this time Bryusov came under the influence of the philosopher Nikolai Fyodorovich Fyodorov and the scientist Konstantin Tsiolkovsky.

At the time, Russian Symbolism was still mainly a set of theories and had few notable practitioners. Therefore, in order to represent Symbolism as a movement of formidable following, Bryusov adopted numerous pen names and published three volumes of his own verse, entitled &quot;Russian Symbolists. An Anthology&quot; (1894–95). Bryusov&#x27;s mystification proved successful – several young poets were attracted to Symbolism as the latest fashion in Russian letters.

With the appearance of &quot;Tertia Vigilia&quot; in 1900, he came to be revered by other Symbolists as an authority in matters of art. In 1904 he became the editor of the influential literary magazine &quot;Vesy&quot; (&quot;The Balance&quot;), which consolidated his position in the Russian literary world. Bryusov&#x27;s mature works were notable for their celebration of sensual pleasures as well as their mastery of a wide range of poetic forms, from the acrostic to the carmina figurata.

By the 1910s, Bryusov&#x27;s poetry had begun to seem cold and strained to many of his contemporaries. As a result, his reputation gradually declined and, with it, his power in the Russian literary world. He was adamantly opposed to the efforts of Georgy Chulkov and Vyacheslav Ivanov to move Symbolism in the direction of Mystical Anarchism.

Though many of his fellow Symbolists fled Russia after the Russian Revolution of 1917, Bryusov remained until his death in 1924. He supported the Bolshevik government and received a position in the cultural ministry of the new Soviet state. Shortly before his death he was involved with Otto Schmidt in drawing up the proposal for the Great Soviet Encyclopedia.

In 1924, shortly before his death, Bryusov posed for the young sculptor Nina Niss-Goldman (1893–1990). Now the portrait is in the Russian Museum of St. Petersburg in a collection of the work of Russian avant-garde artists.

==Literature==
Alongside Adelina Adalis (1900–1969) and Nikolay Gumilev (1886–1921), he was influenced by the Malaysian literature from the XIX and XX century.

===Prose===

Bryusov&#x27;s most famous prose works are the historical novels &quot;The Altar of Victory&quot; (depicting life in Ancient Rome) and &quot;The Fiery Angel&quot; (depicting the psychological climate of 16th century Germany). The latter tells the story of a knight&#x27;s attempts to win the love of a young woman whose spiritual integrity is seriously undermined by her participation in occult practices and her dealings with unclean forces. It served as the basis for Sergei Prokofiev&#x27;s opera &quot;The Fiery Angel&quot;.

Bryusov also wrote some science fiction stories, under the influence of Poe, H. G. Wells and Camille Flammarion. Several of these, including the title story, were assembled in his collection &quot;The Republic of the Southern Cross&quot;.

===Translation===

As a translator, Bryusov was the first to render the works of the Belgian poet Emile Verhaeren and the lyrics of Armenian ashugh Sayat-Nova accessible to Russian readers. He was one of the major translators of Paul Verlaine&#x27;s poetry.

His most famous translations are of Edgar Allan Poe, Romain Rolland, Maurice Maeterlinck, Victor Hugo, Jean Racine, Ausonius, Molière, Byron, and Oscar Wilde. Bryusov also translated Johann Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot; and Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;.

==Legacy==
For his Russian translation of the Armenian folk epic “David of Sasun,” Bryusov was designated People&#x27;s Poet of Armenia in 1923. Yerevan Brusov State University of Languages and Social Sciences, a public university in the capital of Armenia, has been named after Valery Bryusov since 1962.

Ukrainian composer Inna Abramovna Zhvanetskaya used Bryusov&#x27;s text for at least one of the songs in her vocal collection &quot;Romances&quot;.

<doc id="1032876" wikidata="Q1958087" url="?curid=1032876" title="Faceless Killers">
<text>Faceless Killers (Swedish: &quot;Mördare utan ansikte&quot;) is a 1991 crime novel by the Swedish writer Henning Mankell, and the first in his acclaimed Wallander series. The English translation by Steven T. Murray was published in 1997.

In 1992, &quot;Faceless Killers&quot; won the first ever Glass Key award, given to crime writers from the Nordic countries.

==Synopsis==
Inside an almost isolated Skåne farmhouse in Lunnarp, an old man, Johannes Lövgren, is tortured to death and his wife Maria savagely beaten and left for dead with a noose around her neck. Inspector Kurt Wallander, a forty-two-year-old Ystad police detective, is put on the case with his team: Rydberg, an aging detective with rheumatism; Martinsson, a 29-year-old rookie; Naslund, a thirty-year veteran; Svedberg, a balding, forty-something-year-old detective; Hansson and Peters. Maria Lovgren is taken to hospital, but dies anyway. Her last word: &quot;foreign&quot;.

Rydberg has been examining the noose around Mrs Lovgren&#x27;s neck and &quot;has never seen one like it before&quot;. He thinks that Mrs Lovgren&#x27;s last word is accurate, and that the murderers are foreign. But his conclusion leads to several racially-motivated attacks after the information is leaked to the press.

==Overview==
The novel focuses on Sweden&#x27;s liberal attitude regarding immigration, and explores themes of racism and national identity in the wake of the refugee controversy in Sjöbo and numerous controversial hate crimes, including the growth of skinhead and Neo-Nazi movements, and the rise of the populist New Democracy party. It only describes the situation in the country without any challenge or criticism.

== Adaptations ==
The novel was adapted into a four-episode television miniseries, &quot;Wallander&quot;, by the Swedish public broadcaster Sveriges Television in 1994. Wallander is played by Rolf Lassgård.

&quot;Faceless Killers&quot; has also been adapted into a 90-minute television episode for the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Wallander&quot; series starring Kenneth Branagh as Wallander. It was first broadcast on 3 January 2010. Fredrik Gunnarsson, who played Svartman in the Swedish TV series, had a cameo in this episode. Notably, in the episode, the ethnicity of the killers was changed from Yugoslav to Arab, possibly due to the decreased actuality of the Yugoslav wars and in recognition of later refugee currents from the Iraq War, which was notable in Swedish political debate already in the 2000s. 

The novel has also been broadcast on BBC Radio 7, read by the English actor David Warner, who plays Wallander&#x27;s father in the British television adaptation of Wallander.

<text>The Mollweide projection is an equal-area, pseudocylindrical map projection generally used for maps of the world or celestial sphere. It is also known as the Babinet projection, homalographic projection, homolographic projection, and elliptical projection. The projection trades accuracy of angle and shape for accuracy of proportions in area, and as such is used where that property is needed, such as maps depicting global distributions.

The projection was first published by mathematician and astronomer Karl (or Carl) Brandan Mollweide (1774–1825) of Leipzig in 1805. It was reinvented and popularized in 1857 by Jacques Babinet, who gave it the name homalographic projection. The variation homolographic arose from frequent nineteenth-century usage in star atlases.

==Properties==
The Mollweide is a pseudocylindrical projection in which the equator is represented as a straight horizontal line perpendicular to a central meridian that is one-half the equator&#x27;s length. The other parallels compress near the poles, while the other meridians are equally spaced at the equator. The meridians at 90 degrees east and west form a perfect circle, and the whole earth is depicted in a proportional 2:1 ellipse. The proportion of the area of the ellipse between any given parallel and the equator is the same as the proportion of the area on the globe between that parallel and the equator, but at the expense of shape distortion, which is significant at the perimeter of the ellipse, although not as severe as in the sinusoidal projection.

Shape distortion may be diminished by using an &quot;interrupted&quot; version. A &quot;sinusoidal interrupted&quot; Mollweide projection discards the central meridian in favor of alternating half-meridians which terminate at right angles to the equator. This has the effect of dividing the globe into lobes. In contrast, a &quot;parallel interrupted&quot; Mollweide projection uses multiple disjoint central meridians, giving the effect of multiple ellipses joined at the equator. More rarely, the projection can be drawn obliquely to shift the areas of distortion to the oceans, allowing the continents to remain truer to form.

The Mollweide, or its properties, has inspired the creation of several other projections, including the Goode&#x27;s homolosine, van der Grinten and the Boggs eumorphic.

==Mathematical formulation==
The projection transforms from latitude and longitude to map coordinates &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; via the following equations:

:formula_1

where &quot;θ&quot; is an auxiliary angle defined by

:formula_2

and &quot;λ&quot; is the longitude, &quot;λ&quot; is the central meridian, &quot;φ&quot; is the latitude, and &quot;R&quot; is the radius of the globe to be projected. The map has area 4&quot;R&quot;, conforming to the surface area of the generating globe. The &quot;x&quot;-coordinate has a range of [−2&quot;R&quot;, 2&quot;R&quot;], and the &quot;y&quot;-coordinate has a range of [−&quot;R&quot;, &quot;R&quot;].

Equation (1) may be solved with rapid convergence (but slow near the poles) using Newton–Raphson iteration:

:formula_3
If &quot;φ&quot; = ±, then also &quot;θ&quot; = ±. In that case the iteration should be bypassed; otherwise, division by zero may result.

There exists a closed-form inverse transformation:

:formula_4

where &quot;θ&quot; can be found by the relation

:formula_5

The inverse transformations allow one to find the latitude and longitude corresponding to the map coordinates &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;.

<doc id="1032897" wikidata="Q1393800" url="?curid=1032897" title="Théo Sarapo">
<text>Theophanis Lamboukas (Greek: Θεοφάνης Λαμπουκάς; 26 January 1936 – 28 August 1970), professionally known as Théo Sarapo (), was a French singer and actor, the second husband of Édith Piaf. Formerly a hairdresser, he was 26 years old when he married the 46-year-old Piaf. He was introduced to her by Claude Figus, Piaf&#x27;s secretary.

==Biography==
Sarapo was born in Paris to Greek parents. He scored a hit with Piaf in 1962 with the song &quot;À quoi ça sert l&#x27;amour?&quot; (What Good Is Love?) and solo hits with &quot;La maison qui ne chante plus&quot; (The House Which No Longer Sings), and &quot;Ce jour viendra&quot; (That Day Will Come); its English-language version, &quot;Our Day Will Come&quot;, was covered by Ruby &amp; the Romantics and others.

When he began singing with Piaf, Sarapo&#x27;s voice was rather nasal, but over the next few years his tone mellowed. His other hits included &quot;La Ronde&quot; (The Round) and &quot;Nous n&#x27;étions pas pareils&quot; (We Weren&#x27;t Alike).

As an actor, Sarapo&#x27;s best- known film was &quot;Judex&quot;, directed by Georges Franju, which was being filmed at the time of Piaf&#x27;s death.

Upon Piaf&#x27;s death, French law transferred her seven million francs&#x27; worth of debts directly to Sarapo. This led to his eviction on Christmas Day 1963 from the apartment they shared on Boulevard Lannes.

Sarapo, who was 34 at the time, died in a hospital in Limoges, France, after an automobile accident on 28 August 1970 in the nearby town of Panazol on road RN 141. He is buried with Piaf and her daughter Marcelle (the child Piaf had with Louis Dupont, her onetime lover), in Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris. The inscription on their tomb translates as &quot;Love Conquers All&quot;. Édith&#x27;s father, Louis Alphonse Gassion, is also buried there. His name is engraved on the right side of the tombstone along with Édith&#x27;s and Théo&#x27;s. Daughter Marcelle&#x27;s name appears on the opposite side. Etched at the foot of the tomb are the words &quot;Famille (Family) Gassion-Piaf.&quot;

==Édith Piaf ==
Sarapo was the last in a long line of Piaf discoveries (including Yves Montand, Les Compagnons de la chanson, Georges Moustaki, Charles Aznavour, etc.). Sarapo often recorded and performed in concert with Piaf during their marriage.

==Stage name ==
His stage name &quot;Sarapo&quot;, as pronounced in French, is Greek for &quot;I love you&quot; (Σ&#x27;αγαπώ, &quot;s&#x27;agapo&quot;) and was chosen by Piaf herself.

<text>Ohagamiut () is an abandoned village along the Kuskokwim River in the Bethel Census Area of the southwestern part of the U.S. state of Alaska, located between Crow Village and Kalskag. It was abandoned in the 1940s as residents relocated to Kalskag, Aniak, Bethel and other towns. The village site is located just 3 miles east of Upper Kalskag.

Ohagamiut is sometimes confused with another Yup&#x27;ik village on the Yukon River called Ohogamiut, which is presently an Alaska Native Village Statistical Area (ANVSA).

== History ==

Ohagamiut has also been called &quot;Okhogamute&quot;. The first reference to the village comes from Russian explorers who traveled down the Kuskokwim River in 1818. The first Roman Catholic mission in western Alaska was established at Ohagamiut in 1892. The first census of Alaska completed in 1884 by Ivan Petrof showed Okhogamute having a population of 130.

==Demographics==

Ohagamiut first reported on the 1880 U.S. Census as the unincorporated Yup&#x27;ik village of &quot;Okhogamute&quot;, with 130 residents (127 Inuit and 3 Creole (Mixed Russian and Native)). It returned in 1890 as &quot;Oh-hagamiut&quot;, with 36 residents (all Native). It last appeared on the 1920 census as &quot;Ohagamute&quot;, with 92 residents. Although it never appeared on the census again, it would later appear on maps as &quot;Oknagamut.&quot;

<doc id="1032907" wikidata="Q138377" url="?curid=1032907" title="Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness of the English Stage">
<text>In March 1698, Jeremy Collier published his anti-theatre pamphlet, A Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness of the English Stage; in the pamphlet, Collier attacks a number of playwrights: William Wycherley, John Dryden, William Congreve, John Vanbrugh, and Thomas D&#x27;Urfey. Collier attacks rather recent, rather popular comedies from the London stage; he accuses the playwrights of profanity, blasphemy, indecency, and undermining public morality through the sympathetic depiction of vice.

==Description==
Collier begins his pamphlet with this conclusion: &quot;[N]othing has gone farther in Debauching the Age than the Stage Poets, and Play-House&quot; (Collier A2). He goes on, in great detail—despite the title—to give his evidence. For Collier, the immorality of the title stems from Restoration comedy&#x27;s lack of poetic justice. With his exhaustively thorough readings—in a sense, pre-close reading close readings—he condemns the characters of Restoration comedies as impious and wicked and he condemned their creators (the playwrights) for failing to punish the playwrights&#x27; wicked &quot;favorites&quot;. As the title suggests, Collier also charges the playwrights with profaneness, supporting his allegations with a number quotations from the plays (i.e. &quot;The Provoked Wife&quot;, &quot;The Relapse&quot;, et cetera). However, most of these charges are rather mild (at least according to the standards of most modern readers). Collier is, of course, unable to give examples of blatant blasphemy, for at the time, they were neither allowed on stage nor in print. However, Collier&#x27;s strategy was innovative for his time (not to mention effective). Before &quot;A Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness of the English Stage&quot;, most anti-theatre pamphlets were merely nondescript diatribes (e.g. William Prynne&#x27;s &quot;Histriomastix&quot; (1633)), but with his innovative techniques, Collier comprehensively indicted the entire Restoration stage (see also Antitheatricality#Restoration theatre).

==Reaction==
Due to its publication, a pamphlet war ensued (for and against Collier&#x27;s case), lasting sporadically until about 1726. In 1698, John Dennis wrote a pamphlet entitled: &quot;The Usefulness of the Stage&quot;. John Vanbrugh wrote a jestful retort, &quot;A Short Vindication of The Relapse and The Provok&#x27;d Wife From Immorality and Prophaneness&quot; (1698). In his pamphlet, Vanbrugh accuses Collier of being more upset by the unflattering depictions of clergymen than actual blasphemy. William Congreve, on the other hand, took the attacks on his plays quite seriously and refuted Collier&#x27;s allegations in his &quot;Amendments of Mr. Collier&#x27;s False and Imperfect Citations&quot; (1698). Other playwrights (like Thomas D&#x27;Urfey) preferred to give their reply on the stage. D&#x27;Urfey&#x27;s play &quot;Campaigners&quot; (1698) comments on Collier&#x27;s strictures. Collier would later fire back with his &quot;Defence of the Short View&quot; in 1699 and Edward Filmer would go on to defend Restoration theatre in 1707 with &quot;A Defence of Plays&quot;.

==Analysis==
By the end of the 17th century, the Restoration comic style had already collapsed: the satiric presentation of English life gave way to the sentimental portrait (beginning in 1696 with Colley Cibber&#x27;s &quot;Love&#x27;s Last Shift&quot;) (Bernbaum 72). &quot;A Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness of the English Stage&quot; only signaled the swelling of public opposition to the real or imposed indecency of the plays staged over the last three decades. Collier writes in the introduction: &quot;The business of plays is to recommend Vertue, and discountenance Vice&quot; (Collier 1). However, the Restoration playwright rarely saw their function within Collier&#x27;s strictures; in Congreve&#x27;s dedication to &quot;The Double-Dealer&quot; (1693), he writes, &quot;It is the business of a comic poet to paint the vices and follies of humankind&quot; (Congreve 174). Congreve implies that the purpose of the comic playwright was to portray the vices and follies of society in order to correct them. Collier, instead, preferred his restrictions imposed on comedy (e.g. his rigid Neoclassical notions of dramatic decorum) and in doing so he followed a logic similar to what is found in the work of other critics who had imposed the law of poetic justice on tragedy (e.g. Thomas Rymer and his &quot;A Short View of Tragedy&quot; (1693)).

==Legacy==
&quot;A Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness of the English Stage&quot; is often credited with turning the tide against the sexually explicit nature of Restoration comedy, but the tide had already begun turning; Collier&#x27;s pamphlet was only swimming with the tide of public opinion. The truth was that Restoration comedy was over; it had been worn down by external factors, such as the Glorious Revolution and William III of England and Mary II of England&#x27;s dislike of the theatre. Perhaps the most obvious sign of Restoration theatre&#x27;s death came with the &quot;nolle prosequi&quot; (immunity from prosecution for earlier offences) granted to Collier by William III (for &quot;A Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness of the English Stage&quot;).

<text>Scarisbrick () is a village and civil parish in West Lancashire, England. The A570, the main road between Ormskirk and Southport, runs through Scarisbrick, and much of the village lies along it. As a result, it does not have a traditional village centre, though the junction with the A5147 is close to the geographic centre.

==Toponymy==
Scarisbrick literally means &quot;Skar&#x27;s slope&quot; and comes from the Old Norse &quot;Skar&quot; (a personal name) + &quot;-es&quot; (possessive) + &quot;brekka&quot; (&quot;slope&quot;). It is thought that the personal name is Danish, though the second element suggests Norwegian settlement. The &quot;slope&quot; may refer to a slight incline between two streams near the site of Scarisbrick Hall. The name was recorded as &quot;Scharisbrec&quot; c.1200, &quot;Skaresbrek&quot; in 1238, and finally &quot;Scarisbrick&quot; c.1240.

==History==

In its early history, travellers tended to avoid Scarisbrick parish. Martin Mere, a large lake with associated marshlands and peat bogs, made the immediate area quite difficult to cross. Much of the flat land between Southport and Liverpool is polder reclaimed from marshes and the lake. The modern-day hamlets of Barrison Green, Bescar, Carr Cross, Drummersdale, Hurlston, Pinfold, and Snape Green were formed from the early farms and settlements that did arise in the area.

Scarisbrick still contains many structures and artefacts from its past. The Old School House, constructed in 1809, has served several roles in its history and now contains two residences. A pillbox constructed during World War II can be found near a bridge over the Leeds and Liverpool Canal. It was from Pinfold, where the canal is closest to Southport, that William Sutton picked up waterway passengers for transport to his &quot;Original Hotel&quot;, known better as &quot;Duke&#x27;s Folly&quot; - the foundation of Southport. The canal now is used for recreational purposes. The only Catholic church there, St Elizabeth&#x27;s, was founded by the Marquis of Casteja and was named after his wife. There are many other churches there as well.

&quot;Wheelwrights House&quot;, a former workshop located on Southport Road, is another of the many listed buildings in Scarisbrick.

==Demography==
According to the United Kingdom Census 2011, Scarisbrick parish had a population of 3,554 people living in 1,505 households, with an almost even distribution between males and females. The parish covers an area of , giving a population density of . The increase in population from 3,204 in 2001 represents a growth rate of over ten years.

A majority of of residents were born in the United Kingdom, and identified as being of &quot;White British&quot; ethnicity. Religion was recorded as Christian, with of residents being of no religion, and declining to state; only belonged to an alternative religion. Of the 2,695 residents aged between 16 and 74, were regarded as economically active, and of those were unemployed.

==Transport==

Scarisbrick is on the A570 road, which runs northwest through it between Ormskirk and Southport for . The A5147 road, which runs north from Maghull through Halsall, terminates at its junction with the A570 at Scarisbrick. There are also two B roads, the B5242 which leads towards Burscough, and the B5243 which provides an alternative route into Southport. The nearest motorway links are junction 3 of the M58, to the southeast at Bickerstaffe, and junction 27 of the M6, east at Wrightington.

Arriva North West operate several bus services in Scarisbrick. The 385 and 375 are hourly services from Southport to Wigan which both follow similar routes; the 385 crosses Scarisbrick directly along the A570, while the 375 takes a diversion along the B5242 through the more rural parts of the parish, before rejoining the A570 at Ormskirk. The half-hourly 300 service from Southport to Liverpool also passes through Scarisbrick.

Bescar Lane railway station, which opened in 1855, is managed by Northern Trains on the Manchester to Southport Line. As of May 2015, trains generally operate eight times a day Monday–Saturday in each direction, travelling westbound to Southport (12–15 minutes) and eastbound to Manchester Oxford Road via Wigan Wallgate (65–70 minutes). There are no train services at Bescar Lane on Sundays. During the 2013–14 financial year, the station was used by an estimated 3,146 passengers.

Heathey Lane Halt, a station on the Barton branch of the Lancashire &amp; Yorkshire Railway, was on the boundary between Scarisbrick and Halsall, just to the north of the B5243 road bridge. The station was in operation between 1907 and 1938, and the line itself closed in 1952.

<text>Brzeziński (feminine: Brzezińska, plural: Brzezińscy) is a Polish surname.

==History==
The surname is derived from the root word &quot;brzoza&quot; (&quot;brzez-&quot; in some compound words), meaning &quot;birch&quot;. The adjective suffix &quot;-ski&quot; means &quot;being like&quot; or &quot;belonging to&quot;, so Brzeziński refers to a person from one of the localities named for a concentration of birch trees, such as Brzezina, (a small village in Western Pomerania). In Polish, Brzeziński has a diacritic over the letter &quot;ń&quot;, and the Polish pronunciation is &quot;bzhe-ZEEGN-ski&quot; (where GN sounds like the NI of &quot;onion&quot;).

The Brzeziński surname was originally borne only by the szlachta, the Polish noble class, who took their names from their estates, but it later spread to the working and peasant classes as well. It is known to be associated with at least nine different coats of arms:

*Dołęga coat of arms (originating in eastern Poland)
*Doliwa coat of arms (originating in Łęczyca)
*Gryf coat of arms (borne by the two Brzeziński families ennobled by the Tsar in his role as &quot;King of Poland&quot; in the 19th century) 
*Kościesza coat of arms 
*Łabędź coat of arms (originating in Sandomierz)
*Lubicz coat of arms (originating in Płock)
*Prus III coat of arms 
*Trąby coat of arms (originating in Kraków)
*Zabawa coat of arms

There were 25,361 persons with the name Brzeziński in Poland in 1990. The name has been borne by many notable Poles and persons of Polish descent, including:

<doc id="1032924" wikidata="Q3866925" url="?curid=1032924" title="Bombing of Frampol">
<text>The Bombing of Frampol occurred during the German invasion of Poland in 1939. On 13 September, the town of Frampol with a population of 4,000 was bombed by the German bombers of Luftwaffe&#x27;s 8th Air Corps, under General Wolfram Freiherr von Richthofen. The town had no military value, and the bombing was seen as a practice run for future missions.

==The bombardment==
According to Polish journalist Pawel Puzio and local historian Ryszard Jasinski no units of the Polish army were stationed in Frampol and the town did not have any military facilities. The Luftwaffe likely selected Frampol for an experimental bombing since the town had an extensive market square with a grid plan, making it appear as a large bullseye, and there were no anti-aircraft units located at Frampol. In his 1968 book, &quot;Augen am Himmel&quot; (&quot;Eyes on the Sky&quot;), German writer Wolfgang Schreyer wrote: &quot;Frampol was chosen as an experimental object, because test bombers, flying at low speed, weren&#x27;t endangered by AA fire. Also, the centrally placed town hall was an ideal orientation point for the crews. We watched possibility of orientation after visible signs, and also the size of village, what guaranteed that bombs nevertheless fall down on Frampol. From one side it should make easier the note of probe, from second side it should confirm the efficiency of used bombs.&quot; British historian Norman Davies writes in &quot;Europe at War 1939–1945: No Simple Victory&quot;: &quot;Frampol was chosen partly because it was completely defenceless, and partly because its baroque street plan presented a perfect geometric grid for calculations and measurements.&quot;

The first German reconnaissance plane appeared over Frampol on 9 September 1939 taking reconnaissance photographs of the location then on 11 and 12 September the town was bombed. The first raids did not cause any significant damage, but the subsequent bombing on 13 September completely destroyed the town. According to Davies, 125 bombers dropped 700 tons of explosives during bombing, which lasted for several hours. Furthermore, German fighter pilots trained strafing techniques on refugees who were trying to flee from the city.

==Aftermath==
After the bombing, on 18 September, a German reconnaissance plane again appeared over Frampol to take photographs of the destruction.

According to Davies, Frampol lost 90% of its buildings and 50% of the population became casualties. Only two streets remained untouched, including some houses on the outskirts. Today Frampol&#x27;s population is still much lower at about 1.400 people.

==In popular culture==
The bombing of Frampol plays an important part in the short story &quot;The Little Shoemakers&quot; by Isaac Bashevis Singer.

Isaac Bashevis Singer also wrote &quot;The Tale of Three Wishes&quot; in which artist Irene Lieblich beautifully illustrates the Market Of Frampol, a direct reflection of her memories of Frampol.

<doc id="1032930" wikidata="Q7278621" url="?curid=1032930" title="Rabbit Test (film)">
<text>Rabbit Test is a 1978 American comedy film about the world&#x27;s first pregnant man, directed and co-written by Joan Rivers and starring Billy Crystal in his film debut.

This was the only directing effort by Joan Rivers, who also plays a nurse in a brief scene, while her daughter Melissa Rivers also has a bit part. Rivers&#x27; husband, Edgar Rosenberg, was producer. It was the only theatrical feature to be scored by the team of Mike Post and Pete Carpenter. Michael Keaton made his feature film debut in a small non-speaking role.

The title is a reference to the Friedman test, commonly known as the rabbit test, a medical procedure used for several decades in the 20th century to determine pregnancy.

==Plot==
Lionel Carpenter (Billy Crystal) is a night-school teacher who has bad luck with women. He remains a virgin until his brash cousin Danny (Alex Rocco) sets him up with a one-night stand. Soon after, Lionel starts feeling nauseated and vomits, eventually doing so onto Segoynia Savaka (Joan Prather), one of his immigrant students. This turns out to be a blessing in disguise, as it gives him an excuse to ask her out on a date, and a romance develops.

When Lionel meets Segoynia&#x27;s fortune-telling grandmother (played by Roddy McDowall in drag), she intuits that he is the world&#x27;s first pregnant man. This results in a series of gags relating to his pregnancy and people&#x27;s reactions to it. One side plot has Lionel being pursued by the Army because the President of the United States is afraid of what effect the widespread ability of men to conceive will have on population growth.

In the ending sequence, which is patterned after the Nativity, Lionel finally goes into labor. The camera rises to Heaven, where God announces to the viewers the successful delivery: &quot;Oh my god... It&#x27;s a girl!&quot;

==Cast==
The main cast includes the following:
==Production==
When all the major studios turned Rivers down for funding, she raised about half the film&#x27;s $997,000 budget by remortgaging her home and convincing her father to do the same, and raised the other half with a series of investment deals. Rivers explained how she got so many cameos on a tiny budget: &quot;We had no money to spare. I made up a letter: &#x27;Dear so-and-so, we&#x27;d love to have you be in a part; there is no money, no point in arguing, etc.&#x27;&quot; All involved did stints for scale ($185), with a bonus if the film made over $18 million. Another $1 million was allotted for promotion and publicity.

==Release==
The film opened in pre-release on February 17, 1978, in six cities (Nashville, Rochester, Columbus, Houston, Denver and Portland) before an official opening in Los Angeles on April 7.

==Reception==
&quot;Rabbit Test&quot; drew negative reviews from the majority of critics.
* Roger Ebert rated the film 1 star out of 4 and wrote that it &quot;is not a funny movie. It really isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s jammed from wall to wall with eccentric characters and throwaway one-liners and would-be funny signs (&#x27;The Christian Science Memorial Hospital&#x27;), but it&#x27;s just not funny. And I know it&#x27;s not, because I would have laughed if it had been.&quot;
* Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film 1.5 stars out of 4 and called it a &quot;trivial and tasteless little movie ... It&#x27;s nothing more than a series of tired ethnic insults and vulgar sex jokes.&quot;
* Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Miss Rivers has turned to directing without paying much heed to whether a whole movie constructed from one-liners is worth even the sum of its parts. In her case, it&#x27;s not—and the one-liners weren&#x27;t all that sparkling to begin with. When it winds up on television, which is where a movie this visually crude belonged in the first place, &quot;Rabbit Test&quot; may improve slightly: Constant commercial interruptions may help distract attention from the movie&#x27;s continuity problems, which are severe. And the coarseness of its comedy may not seem so insufferable to an audience willing to sit still for &quot;Laverne and Shirley&quot;.&quot;
* &quot;Variety&quot; stated that &quot;Rivers has taken a slim concept ... and come up with a generally slim feature. To be sure, it contains a few yocks, but the humor—from one liner to one liner—never emerges; it&#x27;s 84 minutes of forced setups.&quot;
* Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Ostensibly this film, sure to be among the year&#x27;s worst, is a comedy, but it&#x27;s really a mystery, the mystery being how a lady as witty and talented as Miss Rivers, who showed such flair with her script for the TV movie &quot;The Girl Most Likely To...&quot;, could come up with something so crass and unfunny.&quot;
* Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called the film a &quot;tiresome farce&quot; full of jokes &quot;which fall flat with dreadful consistency.&quot;

Joan Rivers heavily promoted the film by visiting theaters in Chicago showing the film. When she visited the Portage Theater on Chicago&#x27;s northwest side, she arrived in a limo, told jokes, signed autographs, took photos with fans, and received a standing ovation from theater patrons during her visit.

The film received a 1.7/10 by the judges at its 2018 screening at The Secret Cinema, surpassing &quot;Wild Rovers&quot; (2.3/10) to become the lowest-rated film to be shown there.

Despite the negative reviews the film received, &quot;Rabbit Test&quot; was a box office hit, grossing over $12 million in its first four months of release.

<text>Douglas William Bradley (born 7 September 1954) is an English actor and author, best known for his role as the lead Cenobite &quot;Pinhead&quot; in the &quot;Hellraiser&quot; film series and for narration on various Cradle of Filth albums.

==Early life==
Bradley was born in Liverpool and attended Quarry Bank High School.

==Career==
Bradley is best known for playing the role of Pinhead, the lead Cenobite, in the first eight &quot;Hellraiser&quot; films, as well as Captain Elliot Spencer in two of the films, &quot;&quot; (1988) and &quot;Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth&quot; (1992). He is one of only six actors to play the same horror character at least six consecutive times, the others being Christopher Lee (who portrayed Count Dracula), Robert Englund (who portrayed Freddy Krueger), Warwick Davis (who portrayed the Leprechaun), Brad Dourif (who portrayed Chucky) and Tobin Bell (who portrayed John Kramer/&quot;Jigsaw&quot;). Due to his eventual skill at application and removal of the Pinhead appliances and costume, he has been credited in some of the &quot;Hellraiser&quot; films as an assistant make-up artist named Bill Bradley, using his middle name.

Bradley appeared as a gym teacher in an advertisement for Direct Line insurance in the UK. He has performed narrations on several songs by Cradle of Filth, an English extreme metal band. The first was 2000&#x27;s &quot;Her Ghost in the Fog&quot;, as well as &quot;Death Magick for Adepts&quot; and &quot;Tortured Soul Asylum&quot;, from the album &quot;Midian&quot;. However, he could not appear in the music video and was replaced by actor David McEwen.

Bradley also appeared on &quot;Swansong for a Raven&quot; and &quot;Satyriasis&quot; from the band&#x27;s 2004 album, &quot;Nymphetamine&quot;. In 2006, he lent his narrations to &quot;Rise of the Pentagram&quot; and &quot;Tonight in Flames&quot; from the album &quot;Thornography&quot;. Continuing in this vein, Bradley has contributed guest vocals to Cradle of Filth&#x27;s 2008 album &quot;Godspeed on the Devil&#x27;s Thunder&quot;, on all songs except &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot;. He returned for their 2021 album, &quot;Existence&quot; &quot;is&quot; &quot;Futile&quot;, on the songs &quot;Sisters of the Mist&quot; and &quot;Suffer Our Dominian&quot;.

Bradley has appeared in many short horror films, such as &quot;Red Lines&quot; and &quot;On Edge&quot;. He is a member of the UK animation company Renga Media, makers of the independent &quot;Dominator&quot; films and shorts, dividing job roles between producer and voice actor. He voiced the Loc-Nar in the short animated crossover &quot;Heavy Metal vs. Dominator&quot;, in which characters from the &quot;Dominator&quot; universe meet and fight with characters from the film &quot;Heavy Metal 2000&quot;.

After his roles in the &quot;Hellraiser&quot; films and the 1990 horror film &quot;Nightbreed&quot;, 2006 saw Bradley star in &quot;&quot; and 2008 saw Bradley once again returning to Clive Barker&#x27;s cinematic universe by way of a featured appearance in &quot;Book of Blood&quot;. He had a small guest star appearance in the 2008 black comic horror &quot;The Cottage&quot;. In 2010, he starred in the Anglo-Spanish horror film &quot;Exorcismus&quot;, and he joined the Nazi zombie horror &quot;The 4th Reich&quot; in March 2010.

In 2011, he played a man called the Doctor in the British film noir &quot;Jack Falls&quot;. In June 2011, it was announced that Bradley would be providing a voice-over for an independent film called &quot;Lucifer&#x27;s Unholy Desire&quot;, as well as performing in the film &quot;The Reverend&quot;. In 2012, he played &quot;Maynard&quot; in the fifth film of the &quot;Wrong Turn&quot; series, &quot;Wrong Turn 5: Bloodlines&quot;. In 2013, he performed in the indie film &quot;Scream Park&quot;.

Bradley voiced the Sith Emperor for the massively multiplayer online role-playing game &quot;Star Wars: The Old Republic&quot;, based in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe.

In 2018, Bradley joined Blackcraft Wrestling as “The Preacher”, a cult leader who acts as a General Manager type figure to the promotion.

In 2020, he created a YouTube channel on which he reads books and poems out loud. He returned on Cradle of Filth&#x27;s 2021 album &quot;Existence Is Futile&quot;, providing narration for the track &quot;Suffer Our Dominion&quot; and the bonus track &quot;Sisters of the Mist&quot;.

In 2022, Bradley voiced the character Goayre Heddagh alongside actor Tim Curry in the animated horror film &quot;Dagon Troll World Chronicles&quot;.

In 2023 Bradley played Batman villain Joe Chill in the CW television show &quot;Gotham Knights&quot;. The portrayal was different than other live action versions. The episode he was introduced in was titled &quot;A Chill over Gotham&quot;.

===Writing===
Bradley is the author of &quot;Sacred Monsters: Behind the Mask of the Horror Actor&quot;, which explores the history of masks in society and their applications in horror films.

==Personal life==
Bradley is a longtime close friend of novelist Clive Barker, the two having met when they attended secondary school. He has worked with Barker in various projects since the early 1970s, most notably &quot;Hellraiser&quot;, which is adapted from Barker&#x27;s novella &quot;The Hellbound Heart&quot;. He lives in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and is married to Steph Sciullo.

<doc id="1032936" wikidata="Q745545" url="?curid=1032936" title="Anti-radiation missile">
<text>An anti-radiation missile (ARM) is a missile designed to detect and home in on an enemy radio emission source. Typically, these are designed for use against an enemy radar, although jammers and even radios used for communications can also be targeted in this manner.

The earliest known anti-radiation weapon is a variant of the Blohm &amp; Voss BV 246 radar guided bomb.

== Home-on-jam ==

As jammers proliferated, a number of existing ARMs such as the AGM-88 HARM was modified to also target jammers as the source of radiation. Jammers also led to the addition of a feature to missiles that usually use a different targeting mode (e.g. active radar homing, semi-active radar homing, GPS), allowing them to switch to an anti-radiation targeting mode when radar deteriorates too much. Some examples are:
* JDAM and JDAM-ER, air-to-surface GPS bomb
* AMRAAM, active radar homing air-to-air missile
* R-77, active radar homing air-to-air missile

Unlike radar, anti-radiation guidance does not provide range information.

== Air-to-surface ==

Most ARM designs to date have been intended for use against ground-based radars. Commonly carried by specialist aircraft in the Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) role (known to United States Air Force as &quot;Wild Weasels&quot;), the primary purpose of this type of missile is to degrade enemy air defenses in the first period of a conflict in order to increase the chance of survival for the following waves of strike aircraft. They can also be used to quickly shut down unexpected surface-to-air missile (SAM) sites during an air raid. Often, SEAD escort aircraft also carry cluster bombs, which can be used to ensure that, after the ARM disables the SAM system&#x27;s radar, the command post, missile launchers, and other components or equipment are also destroyed to guarantee that the SAM site stays down.

Early ARMs, such as the AGM-45 Shrike, were not particularly intelligent; they would simply home in on the source of radiation and explode when they got near it. SAM operators learned to turn their radar off when an ARM was fired at them, then turn it back on later, greatly reducing the missile&#x27;s effectiveness. This led to the development of more advanced ARMs such as the AGM-78 Standard ARM, AGM-122 Sidearm, and AGM-88 HARM missiles, which have inertial guidance systems (INS) built-in. This allows them to remember the radar&#x27;s direction if it is turned off and continue to fly towards it. ARMs are less likely to hit the radar if the radar is turned off shortly after the missile is launched, as the longer the radar is off (and assuming it never turns back on), the more error is introduced into the missile&#x27;s course. The ALARM has an added loiter mode, with a built-in parachute, enabling it to descend slowly until the radar activates, whereupon the rocket motor will re-ignite. Even a temporary shut down of the enemy&#x27;s missile guidance radar can be of a great advantage to friendly aircraft during battle.

== Surface-to-surface ==

Several surface-to-surface missiles, like the P-700 Granit, P-500 Bazalt, MM40 Exocet, B-611MR, and Otomat, include a capability wherein the receiver component of their active radar homing is used to home in on enemy radar, ECM or communications. This makes these missiles significantly harder to defeat with ECM and distraction countermeasures, and makes the use of semi-active missiles against them dangerous. Surface launched anti-radiation missiles also found application in the Israeli defense forces, such as an AGM-45 shrike variant which could be fitted on an M4 Sherman tank chassis.

== Surface-to-air ==

Due to experiences with jamming by US-built aircraft in Vietnam and during Middle Eastern wars in the late 1960s, the Soviet Union designed an alternative tracking mode for their S-75 (SA-2) missiles, which allowed them to track a jamming target without needing to actively send out any radar signals. This was achieved by the SAM site&#x27;s radar receiver locking on to radio noise emissions generated by an aircraft&#x27;s jamming pod. In cases of heavy jamming, missiles were often launched exclusively in this mode; this passive tracking meant that SAM sites could track targets without needing to emit any radar signals, and so American anti-radiation missiles could not be fired back in retaliation. Recently, the People&#x27;s Republic of China developed the FT-2000 system to counter AEW and AWACS targets. This system is based on the HQ-9, which is in turn based on the S-300PMU. These anti-radiation missile systems have been marketed to Pakistan and various other countries.

== Air-to-air ==

More recently, air-to-air ARM designs have begun to appear, notably the Russian Vympel R-27EP. Such missiles have several advantages over other missile guidance techniques: they do not trigger radar warning receivers (conferring a measure of surprise) and they can have a longer range.

In the 1970s, Hughes Aerospace had a project called BRAZO (Spanish for arm). Based on a Raytheon AIM-7 Sparrow, it was meant to offer an air-to-air capability against proposed Soviet AWACS types and also some other types with extremely powerful radar sets, such as the MiG-25. The project did not proceed.

<doc id="1032944" wikidata="Q2737789" url="?curid=1032944" title="Eagles Live">
<text>Eagles Live is the first live album by the American rock band Eagles, a two-LP set released on November 7, 1980. Although the Eagles were already in the process of breaking up, the band owed Elektra/Asylum Records one more album and fulfilled that contractual obligation with a release of performances from the &quot;Hotel California&quot; and &quot;The Long Run&quot; tours.

&quot;Eagles Live&quot; was mixed by Glenn Frey and Don Henley on opposite coasts in Los Angeles and Miami, respectively, and as producer Bill Szymczyk put it, the record&#x27;s harmony and instrument fixes were made &quot;courtesy of Federal Express.&quot; The 1983 &quot;Rolling Stone Record Guide&quot; said it is &quot;perhaps the most heavily overdubbed [live album] in history.&quot; &quot;Seven Bridges Road,&quot; a Steve Young cover, was released as a single and became a top-40 hit.

== Recording ==
Five of the tracks were recorded in October 1976, during three performances at The Forum in Inglewood, California. The other ten tracks were recorded in July 1980, from three shows at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium and one at the Long Beach Arena in California. The band had different line-ups in 1976 and 1980; Timothy B. Schmit joined in 1978, replacing original bassist Randy Meisner. Five lead singers are featured in the 14 vocal songs on the album [excluding the brief musical interlude of &quot;Doolin Dalton (Reprise II)&quot;]: Henley, Frey, Joe Walsh, Meisner and Schmit. Songs from each Eagles studio album except one (&quot;On the Border&quot;) are included, as well as two Walsh solo tracks and one cover song: the acoustic harmony-laden &quot;Seven Bridges Road.&quot;

Plagued for years by internal strife, the band had reached a breaking point by July 31, 1980, when &quot;The Long Run&quot; tour concluded with a concert in Long Beach, California, that served as a fund-raiser for then-Senator Alan Cranston&#x27;s campaign. The version of &quot;All Night Long&quot; for &quot;Eagles Live&quot; was recorded at this show, which was most notable for a dispute between bandmates Frey and Don Felder that culminated backstage, when they nearly came to blows. Frey then refused to even speak to the other band members, let alone join them to record overdubs for &quot;Eagles Live&quot;; therefore, the recording was done piecemeal. Frey was in Los Angeles while the rest of the band was in Miami, with Henley overseeing the post-production sessions. Tapes were sent back and forth between the two locations until the album was completed. Szymczyk said: &quot;I had my assistant in Los Angeles with Glenn, and I had the rest of the band fly to Miami. We were fixing three-part harmonies courtesy of Federal Express.&quot; Five different lawyers were thanked in the liner notes.

The Eagles rejected a $2 million offer from the label to record two new songs for the album. The only previously unreleased song in the album is a version of &quot;Seven Bridges Road&quot;. The song was a showcase for the band&#x27;s close harmony singing, as the verses of the song feature a cappella vocals from all five members.
==Cover==
The album cover is the image of a band-equipment storage chest used during a concert tour. It includes the number 86 on both sides and &quot;MIA&quot; written on air-freight stickers on the back.

The record labels were custom, showing a bird&#x27;s nest filled with eggs and hand grenades.

Original pressings of the vinyl double-album had text engraved in the run-out grooves on each side, as had been the band&#x27;s tradition since their 1975 album &quot;One of These Nights&quot;. Side 1: &quot;Is it illegal to yell &quot;Movie!&quot; in a firehouse?&quot;; &quot;Side 2: &quot;Hello, Federal? ... Ship it!&quot;; Side 3: &quot;Not Tonight, thanks ...&quot; ; Side 4: &quot;... I&#x27;ve gotta rest up for my monster&quot;.

<doc id="1032951" wikidata="Q24155" url="?curid=1032951" title="Pamela Des Barres">
<text>Pamela Des Barres (; born Pamela Ann Miller; September 9, 1948) is an American rock and roll groupie, writer, musician, and actress. She is best known for her 1987 memoir, &quot;I&#x27;m with the Band: Confessions of a Groupie&quot;, which details her experiences in the Los Angeles rock music scene of the 1960s and 1970s. She is also a former member of the experimental Frank Zappa-produced music group the GTOs.

== Early life ==
Des Barres&#x27; parents were from Kentucky. Just before she was born, her father moved the family to the Los Angeles, California area, where Des Barres resides to this day. Her mother was a homemaker; her father worked for Anheuser-Busch and was occasionally a gold miner. Des Barres idolized Elvis Presley as a child and the Beatles as a teenager, and she fantasized about meeting and dating her favorite Beatle, Paul McCartney. Later, upon discovering the Rolling Stones, she daydreamed of Mick Jagger.&lt;ref name=&quot;I&#x27;m w/t band&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rock music groupie ==
A high school acquaintance, Victor Hayden, introduced Des Barres to his cousin Don Van Vliet, better known as Captain Beefheart, a musician and friend of Frank Zappa. Van Vliet, in turn, introduced her to Charlie Watts and Bill Wyman of the Rolling Stones, which drew her to the rock music scene on the Sunset Strip in Los Angeles. She started to spend her time with the Byrds and other bands, and when she graduated from high school in 1966, she took various jobs that would allow her to live near the Sunset Strip and take part in the rock music scene. She famously went on to form friendships with many of the great musical artists of that era, and became romantically linked with various notable artists such as Mick Jagger, Jimmy Page, Keith Moon, Noel Redding, Chris Hillman, Gram Parsons, Brandon deWilde, and Don Johnson.

== Music career ==
Des Barres was also a member of the GTOs, an all-female music and performance art group sponsored by Frank Zappa. The GTOs had only one performance under that name along with the Mothers of Invention, Alice Cooper, Wild Man Fischer and Easy Chair at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, on December 6–7, 1968. The entire concert lasted for six hours. The group dissolved just a month after the release of their first and only album, &quot;Permanent Damage&quot;, due to some of its other members being arrested and detained for drug possession.

== Acting career ==
During the 1970s, Des Barres pursued a career as an actress, appearing in movies (including Zappa&#x27;s &quot;200 Motels&quot;), doing commercials, and playing a recurring role on the soap opera &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot; throughout 1974. She continued to work as a nanny/babysitter for Zappa, who urged her to continue writing the diary she had begun in high school, in which she had faithfully recorded the important details of her life. When her acting career stalled, she continued to work for the Zappa family as a nanny for Zappa&#x27;s children, Dweezil and Moon Unit.

== Family life ==
On October 29, 1977, she married Michael Des Barres, who had been lead singer first with Silverhead (signed in 1972 to Deep Purple&#x27;s record label Purple Records) and later for Detective (signed to Led Zeppelin&#x27;s Swan Song Records label), and who, in 1985, was tour vocalist for the Power Station. They have a son, Nicholas Dean Des Barres (&quot;GameFan&quot; magazine&#x27;s Nick Rox). The couple divorced in the summer of 1991.

== Memoirs and other endeavors ==
Des Barres wrote two memoirs about her experience as a groupie, &quot;I&#x27;m with the Band: Confessions of a Groupie&quot; (1987) and &quot;Take Another Little Piece of My Heart: A Groupie Grows Up&quot; (1993). It is widely believed that Cameron Crowe drew from these memoirs to create the groupie character Penny Lane for his film &quot;Almost Famous.&quot; Crowe has stated that the character was actually a composite of various women he knew during his time as a teenage rock journalist, including one named Pennie Trumbull who went by Pennie Lane. The memoirs by Des Barres have another connection to the film: actress Kate Hudson read them for inspiration as she portrayed Penny Lane.

The March 1989 issue of &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine featured Des Barres in a nude layout, published together with an article the author herself wrote for the magazine&quot;.&quot; In the captions, she was quoted as saying, &quot;I wanted to be in &quot;Playboy&quot; when I was younger, but my breasts did not precede me. But now I have semicelebrity tits, so they don&#x27;t have to be as big.&quot;

In addition to her memoirs, Des Barres has written three non-fiction books: &quot;Rock Bottom: Dark Moments in Music Babylon&quot; (1996); &quot;Let&#x27;s Spend the Night Together: Backstage Secrets of Rock Muses and Supergroupies&quot; (2007); and &quot;Let It Bleed: How to Write a Rockin&#x27; Memoir&quot; (2017). An updated edition of &quot;I&#x27;m with the Band&quot; was released in 2005.

Today, Pamela Des Barres continues to author books, contribute to others&#x27; works as an editor and consultant, and pen articles for online and print publications. She writes a regular column for &quot;Please Kill Me&quot;, in which she confessed that she once kissed murderer and former Manson Family member Bobby Beausoleil in Golden Gate Park during his pre-Manson days. In addition to her work as a writer, Des Barres also teaches creative writing classes in Los Angeles, as well as in several other cities throughout the U.S. and internationally. She affectionately refers to her writing class members as her &quot;dolls&quot;.

<doc id="1032955" wikidata="Q712930" url="?curid=1032955" title="Thomas Percy (bishop of Dromore)">
<text>Thomas Percy (13 April 1729 – 30 September 1811) was Bishop of Dromore, County Down, Ireland. Before being made bishop, he was chaplain to George III of the United Kingdom. Percy&#x27;s greatest contribution is considered to be his &quot;Reliques of Ancient English Poetry&quot; (1765), the first of the great ballad collections, which was the one work most responsible for the ballad revival in English poetry that was a significant part of the Romantic movement.

==Life==
He was born as Thomas Percy in Bridgnorth, Shropshire, the son of Arthur Lowe Percy a grocer and farmer at Shifnal who sent Thomas to Christ Church, Oxford in 1746 following an education firstly at Bridgnorth Grammar School followed by nearby Adams&#x27; Grammar School in Newport. He graduated in 1750 and proceeded M.A. in 1753. He was ordained deacon in 1751, and preached at several churches in the Bridgnorth area before becoming priest in 1753, when he was appointed to the vicarage of Easton Maudit, Northamptonshire, and three years later was instituted to the rectory of Wilby in the same county, benefices which he retained until 1782. In 1759 he married Anne, daughter of Barton Gutterridge.

Dr Percy&#x27;s first work, &quot;Hau Kiou Choaan, or The Pleasing History&quot;, was published in 1761. This is a heavily revised and annotated version of a manuscript translation of the &quot;Haoqiu zhuan&quot; (好逑傳), and is the first full publication in English of a Chinese novel. The following year, he published a two-volume collection of sinological essays (mostly translations) entitled &#x27;Miscellaneous Pieces Relating to the Chinese.&#x27; In 1763, he published &quot;Five Pieces of Runic Poetry&quot;, translated from the Icelandic. The same year, he also edited the Earl of Surrey&#x27;s poems with an essay on early blank verse, translated the Song of Solomon, and published a key to the New Testament. His &quot;Northern Antiquities&quot; (1770) is a translation from the French of Paul Henri Mallet. His edition of the &#x27;Household Book&#x27; of the Earl of Northumberland (1770) (&quot;The Regulations and Establishment of the Household of Henry Algernon Percy, the Fifth Earl of Northumberland, at his Castles of Wresill and Lekinfield in Yorkshire. Begun anno domini M.DXII&quot;) is of the greatest value for the illustrations of domestic life in England at that period.

These works are of little estimation when compared with the &quot;Reliques of Ancient English Poetry&quot; (1765). In the 1760s, he obtained a manuscript of ballads (the Percy Folio) from a source in Northumberland. He had in mind the idea of writing a history of the Percy family of the peerage (the Dukes of Northumberland), and he had sought materials of local interest. He had sought out old tales from near Alnwick, the ancestral home of the Northumberland Percy family, and he had come across many ballad tales.

In 1763, Percy, aiming for the market that &quot;Ossian&quot; had opened for &quot;ancient poetry&quot; (see James MacPherson), published &quot;Five Pieces of Runic Poetry&quot; from Icelandic, which he translated and &quot;improved.&quot;

Percy was a friend of Samuel Johnson, Joseph and Thomas Warton, and James Boswell. In 1764, Dr Johnson and others encouraged Percy to preserve the poetry he was finding at home. Percy therefore took the &quot;ballad&quot; material he had from his folio and began searching for more ballads, in particular. He wanted to collect material from the border areas, near Scotland. In 1765, he published the &quot;Reliques&quot; to great success.

Appointed a chaplain to the king in 1769, Percy was formally admitted to Emmanuel College, Cambridge that year, and received a doctorate of divinity from Cambridge in 1770.

Still not having secured an adequate living, Thomas Percy continued with his project of commemorating the Alnwick area, and so he composed his own ballad poem on Warkworth Castle, then a ruin, which the Dukes of Northumberland controlled and which the Duchess of Northumberland favored for its sublime views. Combining the vogue for the &quot;Churchyard Poets&quot; and the ballad vogue that he himself had set in motion, Thomas Percy wrote &quot;The Hermit of Warkworth&quot; in 1771. Samuel Johnson famously composed three ex tempore parodies of this verse in the 1780s. When an admirer too often told Johnson of the beautiful &quot;simplicity&quot; of the ballad verse form, Johnson pointed out that the line between simplicity and simple mindedness is narrow: just remove the sense. He then demonstrated:
:&quot;The tender infant meek and mild
::Fell down upon a stone;
:The nurse took up the squealing child
::But yet the child squeal&#x27;d on.&quot;
Thomas Percy was angered by the parody, but Hester Thrale says that he soon came to his senses and realized that Johnson was satirizing the form, and not the poem.

Soon after, he said, 

:&quot;I put my hat upon my head
::And went into the Strand.
:There I met another man
::Whose hat was in his hand.&quot;
This extemporized parody was written down by Boswell and others. It may have been aimed less at Percy than at the ballads that were then appearing nearly daily on every subject.

Percy carried out most of the literary work for which he is now remembered at Easton Maudit. When he became famous, he was made domestic chaplain to the Duke and Duchess of Northumberland, and was tempted into the belief that he belonged to the illustrious house of Percy. Through his patron&#x27;s influence he became Dean of Carlisle Cathedral in 1778 and was ordained as Bishop of Dromore in County Down in 1782.

His wife died before him in 1806; the bishop, blind but otherwise in sound health, lived another five years. Both were buried in the transept which Percy had added to Dromore Cathedral.

==Literary work==
The &quot;Reliques of Ancient English Poetry&quot; set the stage not only for Robert Burns, but also for Wordsworth and Coleridge&#x27;s &quot;Lyrical Ballads.&quot;
The book is based on an old manuscript collection of poetry, which Percy claimed to have rescued in Humphrey Pitt&#x27;s house at Shifnal, Shropshire, &quot;from the hands of the housemaid who was about to light the fire with it.&quot; The manuscript was edited in its complete form by JW Hales and FJ Furnivall in 1867–1868. This manuscript provides the core of the work but many other ballads were found and included, some by Percy&#x27;s friends Johnson, William Shenstone, Thomas Warton, and some from a similar collection made by Samuel Pepys.

Percy &quot;improved&quot; 35 of the 46 ballads he took from the Folio. In the case of The Beggar&#x27;s daughter of Bednal Green (Bethnal Green), he added the historical character of Simon de Montfort, Earl of Evesham (&quot;sic&quot;). In this version the ballad became so popular that it was used in two plays, an anonymous novel, operas by Thomas Arne and Geoffrey Bush, and Carl Loewe&#x27;s ballad &quot;Der Bettlers Tochter von Bednall Green&quot;. A fuller account of the history of the ballad can be found in &quot;The Green&quot; by A. J. Robinson and D. H. B. Chesshyre.

== Collections ==

Percy&#x27;s collection of c.120 volumes were kept by his daughters on his death and were presented to the Bodleian Libraries in 1933 by his great granddaughter, Miss Constance Meade.

These were mainly literary works of the 17th-19th centuries, including annotated copies of Goldsmith, Johnson and other 18th century authors. Additionally, the collection includes a set of The Rambler (1756) with MS notes by Percy, and a set of The Idler (1761) with MS notes by Percy and Johnson.

Printed ephemera, which had also been passed into the Meade family alongside Percy&#x27;s books and papers, was given to John Johnson&#x27;s collection of printed ephemera at the University Press in 1930. This is now part of the John Johnson collection at the Bodleian Library.

The Percy Society (1840-1852) was founded to publish ballads with their accompanying music. Edward Francis Rimbault and William Chappell were among the members.

<text>The First Anglo-Maratha War (1775–1782) was the first of three Anglo-Maratha Wars fought between the British East India Company and Maratha Confederacy in India. The war began with the Treaty of Surat and ended with the Treaty of Salbai in this it is said that
 neither British nor marathas will fight each other for 20 years. The war, fought in between Surat and Poona, saw British defeat and restoration of positions of both the parties before the war. Warren Hastings, the first Governor-General of Bengal decided not to attack Pune directly.

==Background ==
After the death of Madhavrao Peshwa in 1772, his brother Narayanrao became peshwa (prime minister) of the Maratha Empire. His palace guards murdered Narayanrao in August 1773, and his uncle Raghunathrao (Raghoba) became Peshwa. However, Narayanrao&#x27;s wife, Gangabai, gave birth to a posthumous son, who was the legal heir to the throne. The newborn infant was named &#x27;Sawai&#x27; Madhavrao (Sawai means &quot;One and a Quarter&quot;). Twelve Maratha chiefs, known as the Baarbhai and led by Nana Phadnavis, directed an effort to install the infant as the new Peshwa and to rule in his name as regents.

Raghunathrao, unwilling to give up his position of power, sought help from the British at Bombay and signed the Treaty of Surat on 6 March 1775. According to the treaty, Raghunathrao ceded the territories of Salsette and Bassein (Vasai) to the British, along with part of the revenues from Surat and Bharuch districts. In return, the British promised to provide Raghunathrao with 2,500 soldiers.

At the same time, the Marathas tried to form a military alliance with the French. Two Frenchmen, Saint-Lubin and M. Montigny acted as intermediaries between the France and the Poona Regency. However, the alliance proposals reached nowhere, while the British suspicions of a global anti-British front increased, since the American War of Independence was also going up around this same period.

The British Calcutta Council condemned the Treaty of Surat, sending Colonel Upton to Pune to annul it and make a new treaty with the regency. The Treaty of Purandhar (1 March 1776) annulled that of Surat, Raghunathrao was pensioned and his cause abandoned, but the revenues of Salsette and Bharuch districts were retained by the British. The Bombay government rejected this new treaty and gave refuge to Raghunathrao. In 1777, Nana Phadnavis violated his treaty with the Calcutta Council by granting the French a port on the West coast. The English retaliated by sending a force towards Pune.

==Initial stage and Treaty of Purandar (1774–1775)==
British troops under the command of Colonel Keating, left Surat on 15 March 1775, for Pune. But they were checked by Haripant Phadke at Adas and were totally defeated on 18 May 1775. Casualties for Keating&#x27;s force, accompanied by Raghunathrao, included 96 killed. The Marathas casualties in the Battle of Adas (Gujarat) included 150 killed.

Warren Hastings estimated that direct actions against Pune would be detrimental. Therefore, the Supreme Council of Bengal condemned the Treaty of Surat, sending Colonel Upton to Pune to annul it and make a new treaty with the regency. An agreement between Upton and the ministers of Pune called Treaty of Purandar was signed on 1 March 1776.

The Treaty of Purandar (or Treaty of Purandhar) was a doctrine signed on 1 March 1776 by the peshwa of the Maratha Empire and the British East India Company&#x27;s Supreme Council of Bengal in Calcutta. Based on the terms of the accord, the British were able to secure Salsette.
Treaty was signed between the then Governor General Warren Hasting who sent Colonel Upton and Nana Fadnavis of Peshwa in which British accepted Sawai Madhav Rao as a new Peshwa and Maratha accepted not to recognise existence of French in India.

The Treaty of Purandhar (1 March 1776) annulled that of Surat, Raghunath Rao was pensioned and his cause abandoned, but the revenues of Salsette and Broach districts were retained by the British.

==Battle of Wadgaon==


Following a treaty between France and the Poona Government in 1776, the Bombay Government decided to invade and reinstate Raghoba. They sent a force under Col. Egerton reached Khopoli and made its way through the Western Ghats at Bhor Ghat and onwards toward Karla, which was reached on 4 January 1779 while under Maratha attacks. Finally the British were forced to retreat back to Wadgaon, but were soon surrounded. The British surrendered and were forced to sign the Treaty of Wadgaon on 16 January 1779, a victory for the Marathas.

Reinforcements from northern India, commanded by Colonel (later General) Thomas Wyndham Goddard, arrived too late to save the Bombay force. The British Governor-General in Bengal, Warren Hastings, rejected the treaty on the grounds that the Bombay officials had no legal power to sign it, and ordered Goddard to secure British interests in the area.

Goddard with 6,000 troops stormed Bhadra Fort and captured Ahmedabad on 15 February 1779. There was a garrison of 6,000 Arab and Sindhi infantry and 2,000 horses. Losses in the fight totalled 108, including two British. Goddard also captured Bassein on 11 December 1780. Another Bengal detachment led by Captain Popham and assisted by the Rana of Gohad, captured Gwalior on 4 August 1780, before Mahadji Scindia could make preparations. Skirmishes took place between Mahadji Scindia and General Goddard in Gujarat, but indecisively. Hastings sent yet another force to harass Mahadji Shinde, commanded by Major Camac.

== Central India and the Deccan ==

After capturing Bassein, Goddard marched towards Pune. But he was routed in the Battle of Bhor Ghat in April 1781 by Parshurambha, Haripant Phadke and Tukoji Holkar.

In central India, Mahadji stationed himself at Malwa to challenge Camac. Initially, Mahadji had an upper hand and British forces under Camac, being harassed and reduced, had to retreat to Hadur.

In February 1781, the British beat Shinde to the town of Sipri, but every move they made after that was shadowed by his much larger army, and their supplies were cut off, until they made a desperate night raid in late March, capturing not only supplies, but even guns and elephants. Thereafter, the military threat from Shinde&#x27;s forces to the British was much reduced.

The contest was equally balanced now. Where Mahadji scored a significant victory over Camac at Sironj, the British avenged the loss through the Battle of Durdah on 24 March 1781.

Colonel Murre arrived with fresh forces in April 1781 to assist Popham and Camac. After his defeat at Sipri, Mahadji Shinde got alarmed. Therefore, Shinde proposed a new treaty
between the Peshwas and the British which came to be known as &quot;Treaty of Salbai&quot;.

==Treaty of Salbai==

This treaty, known as the Treaty of Salbai, was signed on 17 May 1782, and was ratified by Hastings in June 1782 and by Nana Phadnavis in February 1783. The treaty ended the First Anglo-Maratha War, restored the status quo, and established peace between the two parties for 20 years until the Second Anglo-Maratha War.

==In popular culture==

The 2013 Hollywood film titled &quot;The Lovers&quot; is based on the backdrop of this war.
